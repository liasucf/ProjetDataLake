    "text": "Senate House, the University of Cambridge. As of October 2020, 121 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university. This list of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge comprehensively shows the alumni, faculty members as well as researchers of the University of Cambridge who were awarded the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes, established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, are awarded to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. An associated prize, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics), was instituted by Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in 1968 and first awarded in 1969. , 121 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University of Cambridge, and 110 of them are officially listed as \"Cambridge's Nobel Laureates\" by the university for being \"alumni; academics who carried out research at the University in postdoctoral or faculty positions; and official appointments (visiting fellowships, lectureships, etc.)\". Among the 121 laureates, 71 are Cambridge alumni (graduates and attendees), and 45 have been long-term academic members of the university faculty or Cambridge- affiliated research organisations. Subject-wise, 37 laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physics, more than any other subject. In particular, Frederick Sanger received two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, in 1958 and in 1980; since this is a list of laureates, not prizes, he is counted only once. == Inclusion criteria == === General rules === The University of Cambridge The university affiliations in this list are all official academic affiliations such as degree programs and official academic employment. Non-academic affiliations such as advisory committee and administrative staff are generally excluded. The official academic affiliations fall into three categories: 1) Alumni (graduates and attendees), 2) Long-term Academic Staff, and 3) Short-term Academic Staff. Graduates are defined as those who hold Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate, or equivalent degrees from the University of Cambridge, while attendees are those who formally enrolled in a degree program at Cambridge but did not complete the program; thus, honorary degrees, posthumous degrees, summer attendees, exchange students, and auditing students are excluded. The category of \"Long-term Academic Staff\" consists of tenure/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of \"Short-term Academic Staff\" consists of lecturers (without tenure), postdoctoral researchers (postdocs), visiting professors/scholars (visitors), and equivalent academic positions. At University of Cambridge, the specific academic title solely determines the type of affiliation, regardless of the actual time the position was held by a laureate. Further explanations on \"visitors\" under \"Short-term Academic Staff\" are presented as follows. 1) All informal or personal visits are excluded from the list; 2) all employment-based visiting positions, which carry teaching/research duties, are included as affiliations in the list; 3) as for award/honor-based visiting positions, to minimise controversy this list takes a conservative view and includes the positions as affiliations only if the laureates were required to assume employment-level duty (teaching/research) or the laureates specifically classified the visiting positions as \"affiliation\" or similar in reliable sources such as their curriculum vita. In particular, attending meetings and giving public lectures, talks or non-curricular seminars at University of Cambridge is not a form of employment-level duty. Finally, summer visitors are generally excluded from the list unless summer work yielded significant end products such as research publications and components of Nobel-winning work, since summer terms are not part of formal academic years. The official Fellows at various Colleges of Cambridge University are long-term academic staff with teaching/research duties. They are thus included in this list. On the contrary, the \"Overseas Fellowship\" in Churchill College and other similar visiting/honorary fellowships at the Colleges are award/honor-based visiting positions without employment-level duty, which are generally excluded from the list. === Affiliated organisations === This list does not include Nobel-winning organisations or any individuals affiliated with those organisations. It also doesn't include affiliates of institutions that later merged and became part of the University of Cambridge. * The Cavendish Laboratory is a part of the University of Cambridge, and thus its official academic affiliated Nobel laureates are included in the list. * The Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB) traces its root to a research unit within the Cavendish Laboratory of University of Cambridge. On 28 May 1962, however, the research unit officially moved out of the Cavendish lab to become a relatively independent department from the university. Thus, affiliates of MRC LMB are generally not counted as affiliates of the university starting 28 May 1962. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Some of the Nobel Laureates of MRC LMB (but not of the university) !Name !Noble Prize !Year !Affiliation with MRC LMB |- |Arieh Warshel |Chemistry |2013 |EMBO Fellow (1974\u20131975) |- |Roger Kornberg |Chemistry |2006 |Postdoctoral Researcher (1972\u20131975) |- |Andrew Fire |Physiology or Medicine |2006 |Postdoctoral Researcher (1983\u20131986) |- |Robert Horvitz |Physiology or Medicine |2002 |Postdoctoral Researcher (1974\u20131978) |- |Michael Smith |Chemistry |1993 |Visiting Researcher (1975\u20131976) |- |Sidney Altman |Chemistry |1989 |Visiting Researcher (1969\u20131971) |- |Georges K\u00f6hler |Physiology or Medicine |1984 |EMBO Fellow (1974\u20131976) |} == Summary == In the following list, the number following a person's name is the year they received the prize; in particular, a number with asterisk (*) means the person received the award while they were working at the University of Cambridge (including emeritus staff). _A name underlined_ implies that this person has already been listed in a previous category (i.e., multiple affiliations). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Category !Alumni !Long-term academic staff !Short-term academic staff |- |Total: 121 |71 |45 |55 |- |Physics (37) | #Roger Penrose - 2020 #David Thouless - 2016 #John M.
