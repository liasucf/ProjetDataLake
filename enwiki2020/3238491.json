    "text": "The Pacific Islands Political Studies Association (PIPSA) is an unincorporated association established in Hawaii in 1987 at a meeting of scholars of the Pacific Islands who recognised the need to stimulate and coordinate research and other academic activities to develop our knowledge and understanding of the region. In its early years PIPSA was associated with Brigham Young University in Hawai'i, then the University of Guam, Monash University, the University of Canterbury, Christchurch NZ, and the University of the Sunshine Coast. There has been a commitment from the start for PIPSA to serve the countries and peoples of the region by providing political, economic and social analysis of contemporary issues. PIPSA is now a leading international academic body devoted to the study of the Pacific Islands states and territories; their societies, politics and systems of government, and international relations. While the majority of PIPSA\u2019s members are academics, members also come from the ranks of aid workers, business people, the clergy, military officers, politicians and public servants. PIPSA\u2019s principal activity is a biennial conference held at different locations around the Pacific. PIPSA Conferences have so far been held in Hawai'i, Australia, the Cook Islands, Guam, Palau, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Samoa, Tahiti and Niue. As of 2018, PIPSA\u2019s membership stood at approximately 100. The current executive is: President: Professor Stephanie Lawson, Politics and International Relations, Macquarie University.
