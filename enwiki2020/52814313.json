    "text": "Remaining moat at Suwa Kuruwa was a Japanese castle located in Koga, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. During the Muromachi period, Koga was the seat of the Kant\u014d kub\u014d, under the Ashikaga clan. At the end of the Edo period, Koga Castle was the administrative center of Koga Domain, which was held by a large number of fudai daimy\u014d clans, spending the longest time under the control of the Doi clan (1633-1681, 1762-1871). == History == The fortification at Koga may date to the late Heian period or early Kamakura period, and the Azuma Kagami refers to a fortification in Koga built by Shimokobe Yukihira before 1180, although it is not certain if it was in this location. After the Battle of Uji (1180), the head of Minamoto Yorimasa was brought to Koga by the Shomokobe clan. A Shinto shrine to Minamoto Yorimasa still exists at the present Koga Castle site. In 1455, the Kant\u014d kub\u014d Ashikaga Shigeuji relocated his seat from Kamakura to Koga. His descendants ruled to 1583, when the castle was taken by the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan, in the same year Ashikaga Ujinohime took the title Koga kub\u014d. The area was awarded to Tokugawa Ieyasu after the defeat of the H\u014dj\u014d at the Siege of Odawara (1590) and subsequently became the center of Koga Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Edo period, much of the castle remained as reconstructed by Doi Toshikatsu in 1633. Following the Meiji restoration, the structures of the castle were dismantled in 1873. Due to changes in the flow of the Watarase River and flood control work from 1910, almost nothing remains of the castle today. == Description == Plan of Koga Castle Koga Castle was a flatland-style castle built on a long, narrow peninsula in the middle of the Watarase River, with the river itself and wetlands to the east and south forming part of its natural defences. The central bailey Honmaru (\u672c\u4e38) had three-story donjon with a similar size and style as the donjon at Matsue Castle, which was officially styled as a yagura. The Honmaru was protected by the Ni-no-Maru (\u4e8c\u306e\u4e38) to the west and the San-no- Maru (\u4e09\u306e\u4e38) to the north. Further north were two large forecourts: the Marunouchi Kuruwa ( \u4e38\u306e\u5185\u66f2\u8f2a ) and Kannonji Kuruwa ( \u89b3\u97f3\u5bfa\u66f2\u8f2a ) and to the east as the long and narrow Higashiobi Kuruwa ( \u6771\u5e2f\u66f2\u8f2a), and in the south the Yorimasa Kuruwa ( \u983c\u653f\u66f2\u8f2a) and the Tatsuzaki Kuruwa ( \u8fb0\u5d0e\u66f2\u8f2a ). An additional forecourt, the Suwa Kuruwa (\u8acf\u8a2a\u8f2a ) occupied a small area on the opposite bank of the river. Remaining today are the Yorimasa Jinja shrine on the site of the Yorimasa Kuruwa, and the Koga History Museum on the site of the Suwa Kuruwa, which preserves a fragment of the original moat. == Literature == * * * * ==External links== *- Koga Castle- Castle disappeared into embankment Category:Castles in Ibaraki Prefecture Category:Ruined castles in Japan Category:Fujii-Matsudaira clan Category:Honda clan Category:Hotta clan Category:Matsui-Matsudaira clan Category:Ogasawara clan Category:\u014ck\u014dchi-Matsudaira clan Category:Okudaira clan Category:Toda-Matsudaira clan ",
