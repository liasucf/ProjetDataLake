    "text": "Simon J. \"Bobby\" Engram III (born January 7, 1973) is a retired American football wide receiver and current Tight Ends coach for the Baltimore Ravens. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 1996 NFL Draft. He played college football at Penn State. Engram also played for the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs. ==Early years== Engram was born to Simon and Dorothy Engram. He attended Camden High School in Camden, South Carolina, where he was a three-time All-State selection at wide receiver. In 1991, Engram's father died in an automobile accident. ==College career== As a college junior, Engram was the go-to receiver on Penn State's undefeated 1994 team. Wearing #10, he was quarterback Kerry Collins' favorite target. He garnered All-American honors and won the first-ever Biletnikoff Award, recognizing the nation's best wide receiver. Engram was the Nittany Lions' career receptions leader until 2008, when Deon Butler passed his mark of 167. He is still the all-time leader in yards and touchdowns with 3,026 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also racked up 786 career punt return yards for the Nittany Lions, ranking him second in school history. Engram missed the 1992 season as punishment from head-coach Joe Paterno, when he was charged with being involved in a college apartment burglary with teammate Ricky Sayles. Sayles and Engram went into an apartment and removed a stereo. However, the police investigation assumed that Sayles was the instigator behind the burglary and Engram may have been led to believe that he and Sayles were authorized to take the stereo. Consequently, Engram was allowed to complete a pre-trial diversionary program and the charges were later dropped. Sayles, on the other hand, was permanently dismissed from the team. He earned a Bachelor of Science in exercise science from Penn State in 1995. ==NFL career== ===Chicago Bears=== Engram was drafted in the 2nd round of the 1996 NFL Draft, 52nd overall to the Chicago Bears.
