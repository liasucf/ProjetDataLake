    "text": "The Akron Zips are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio, United States. The Zips compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) East division. Akron sponsors 17 varsity teams across six men's, 10 women's, and one coed NCAA sanctioned sports. The football team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest level of competition for college football. ==Nickname & mascot== The Zips name comes from \"zippers\", rubber overshoes made by the BF Goodrich Company of Akron that were popular in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1925, a campus- wide contest had been conducted to choose a nickname for the university's athletic teams. Suggestions submitted by students, faculty, and alumni included Golden Blue Devils, Tip Toppers, Rubbernecks, Hillbillies, Kangaroos, and Cheveliers. The winner, freshman Margaret Hamlin, received a prize of $10 for \"Zippers\". Athletic director Kenneth Cochrane officially shortened the nickname to Zips in 1950. The university's mascot is \"Zippy\", a female kangaroo. Zippy is one of only eight female college mascots in the United States. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- | Baseball || Basketball |- | Basketball || Cross country |- | Football || Golf |- | Soccer || Lacrosse |- | Track and field\u2020 || Soccer |- | || Softball |- | || Swimming & diving |- | || Track and field\u2020 |- | || Volleyball |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"; text-align:center\" | Co-ed sports |- style=\"text-align:center\" | colspan=\"2\"| Rifle |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} Akron is a member of the Mid-American Conference ===Men's soccer=== The Akron Zips men's soccer team, ranked number one throughout the 2009 regular season, went undefeated, making it to the NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship, but lost in penalty kicks to the Virginia Cavaliers.
