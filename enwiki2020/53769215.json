The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages with the exception of the time trials: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2017 Giro d'Italia Femminile, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a cyclamen jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage, and unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages \u2013 with the exception of the team time trial, which awarded no points towards the classification \u2013 were awarded the same number of points. For winning a stage, a rider earned 15 points, with 12 for second, 10 for third, 8 for fourth, 6 for fifth with a point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th place. {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 7 || 5 ||rowspan=2| 3 ||rowspan=2| 2 ||rowspan=2| 1 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 5 || 4 |} There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either second, or third-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs; however on both categories, the top five riders were awarded points. The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1995 were eligible to be ranked in the classification. The fifth and final jersey represented the classification for Italian riders, marked by a blue jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born in Italy were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. The daily team leaders wore red dossards in the following stage. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background-color: #efefef;\" ! width=\"2%\"| Stage ! width=\"14%\"| Winner ! width=\"14%\"| General classification 25px ! width=\"14%\"| Points classification 25px ! width=\"14%\"| Mountains classification 25px ! width=\"14%\"| Young rider classification 25px ! width=\"14%\"| Italian rider classification 25px ! width=\"14%\"| Teams classification 25px |- |scope=row| 1 | |style=\"background:pink;\"| Karol-Ann Canuel |style=\"background:violet;\"| Not awarded |style=\"background:#9CE97B;\"| Not awarded |style=\"background:offwhite;\"| Amalie Dideriksen |style=\"background:lightblue;\" rowspan=10| Elisa Longo Borghini |style=\"background:#FFCD5F;\" rowspan=10| |- |scope=row| 2 | Annemiek van Vleuten |style=\"background:pink;\" rowspan=9| Anna van der Breggen |style=\"background:violet;\" rowspan=2| Annemiek van Vleuten |style=\"background:#9CE97B;\" rowspan=9| Annemiek van Vleuten |style=\"background:offwhite;\" rowspan=6| Floortje Mackaij |- |scope=row| 3 | Hannah Barnes |- |scope=row| 4 | Jolien D'Hoore |style=\"background:violet;\"| Hannah Barnes |- |scope=row| 5 | Annemiek van Vleuten |style=\"background:violet;\" rowspan=6| Annemiek van Vleuten |- |scope=row| 6 | Lotta Lepist\u00f6 |- |scope=row| 7 | Sheyla Guti\u00e9rrez |- |scope=row| 8 | Lucinda Brand |style=\"background:offwhite;\" rowspan=3| Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig |- |scope=row| 9 | Marta Bastianelli |- |scope=row| 10 | Megan Guarnier |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Final !style=\"background:#F660AB;\"| Anna van der Breggen !style=\"background:#B93B8F;| Annemiek van Vleuten !style=\"background:#46E800;\"| Annemiek van Vleuten !style=\"background:offwhite;\"| Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig !style=\"background:dodgerblue;\"| Elisa Longo Borghini !style=\"background:#FF8C00;\"| |} ==See also== * 2017 in women's road cycling ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 UCI Women's World Tour 2017 Category:2017 in Italian sport ",
