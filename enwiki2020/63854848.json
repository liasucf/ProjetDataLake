Sudip Sharma began writing Paatal Lok in the beginning of 2017. For Sharma it was his maiden attempt at writing in long-form. The writing team also consisted of Hardik Mehta, Gunjit Chopra, Sagar Haveli who were also beginners in writing a series. Sharma wrote the first and last three episodes, while the remaining five were written by the other writers. All the writers did field research visiting places in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The show has two directors, Prosit Roy and Avinash Arun Dhaware, both directing different portions of the series. The series has been shot in 110 cities in India. == Styles and themes == === Mythological Tropes === Socio- economic divisions in India are metaphorically compared with the mythological Indian concepts of Svarga, Dharti and Paatal (heaven, earth and the hell). Delhi is used as the story-telling playground where Lutyens Delhi is heaven, Vasant Vihar and Noida is the earth while Jamna Paar in East Delhi is hell. The climax of the story is also based on the mythological fable of Yudhisthira's dog from the Mahabharata. === Didactic themes === The show gives an insight into various forms of discrimination in India. Religion and caste are also visible in the show. Cheeni's story brings out the issues of child abuse and discrimination against transgenders. Hathoda Tyagi's background gives insight into the abysmal state of women safety in rural India. ==Reception== Paatal Lok opened to rave reviews, with many calling it India's best Hindi-language series. The day the series was released, Anurag Kashyap tweeted that Paatal Lok is \"the best crime thriller to come out of this country,\" adding that \"It comes from the understanding of Real India. The dark heart of India, the communal and casteist India.\" Filmstars Manoj Bajpayee and Alia Bhatt both took to Twitter to praise the show and the acting. Saibal Chatterjee gave the series 4 stars and wrote in his NDTV review, \"Is Paatal Lok Amazon Prime's Sacred Games? No. It is more.\" Jaideep Ahlawat, Neeraj Kabi and Swastika Mukherjee were praised for their performances. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu wrote that the performances are \"powerful all around\", adding that on display are \"the pent up prejudices against Muslims, the dehumanisation of the lower castes and the rage and angst of the have-nots against the haves.\" In a review in the Film Companion, Anupama Chopra praised Anushka Sharma for producing the series, writing \"Paatal Lok is a tightly knit thriller [...] our perception of the characters shifts as the story unravels so that it becomes impossible to decide the good, bad and ugly.\" ===Controversies=== The series garnered controversy over the use of the slur \"Nepali randi\" in the second episode. Indra Hang Subba, a Member of Parliament from Sikkim, wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting about the matter. A complaint was filed by \"All Arunachal Pradesh Gorkha Youth Association (AAPGYA)\" to the National Human Rights Commission while a legal notice was also sent by the Lawyers Guild. Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Nand Kishore Gurjar filed a complaint related to \"unauthorised use of his likeness\" in the show as well as accused the show of being \"anti-national\" in numerous ways. == References == ==External links== * Category:Prime Video original programming Category:2020 Indian television series debuts Category:2020s Indian television series Category:Indian crime television series Category:Fictional portrayals of the Delhi Police Category:Hindi-language web series ",
