The track \"Givin' U All That I've Got\" had previously been included on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Space Jam. From Now On remains the last studio album by Robin S. to date. ==Critical reception== In a review for AllMusic, Leo Stanley gave the album four out of five stars and commented that \"From Now On is nearly as accomplished as her debut Show Me Love, thanks to her wonderful voice and the sleek, disco-styled production.\" He went on to say that \"the songs can tend to sound a little similar to each other\", but that the album \"is infectious and irresistible when at its best.\" ==Track listing== #\"It Must Be Love\" (John Footman, Judy Wieder) #\"Been So Long\" (Andrea Martin, Greg Smith) #\"You Know How to Love Me\" (Reggie Lucas, James Mtume) #\"Midnight\" (Alison Moyet) #\"There Is a Need\" (Darin Whittington) #\"Givin' U All That I've Got\" (Robin S., Todd Terry) #\"Shine on Me\" (Robin S., Michael O'Hara) #\"It's Not Enough\" (Steve Dubin, Andrea Martin) #\"24 Hour Love\" (Wayne Cohen, Sheppard Solomon) #\"All I Do\" (Stevie Wonder, Morris Broadnax, Clarence Paul) #\"We're in This Together\" (Michael O'Hara, Stephen Nikolas, Brendon Sibley) #\"It Must Be Love\" (Johnick Henry St. Mix) #\"It Must Be Love\" (Fitch Bros.
