    "text": "Arms of Cobham of Cobham and Cooling Arms of Brooke, Baron Cobham of Kent The title Baron Cobham has been created numerous times in the Peerage of England; often multiple creations have been extant simultaneously, especially in the fourteenth century. The earliest creation was in 1313 for Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham, lord of the manors of Cobham and of Cooling, both in the county of Kent. The de Cobham family died out in the male line in 1408, with the death of the 3rd Baron Cobham, but the title continued via a female line to the Brooke family (anciently \"de la Brook\" or \"At-Brook\"), which originated at the estate of \"la Brook\"Collinson, Rev. John, History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset, Vol.3, Bath, 1791, pp.302-4 near Ilchester in Somerset, and which later resided at Holditch in the parish of Thorncombe and at Weycroft in the parish of Axminster, both in Devon, both fortified manor houses. Following their inheritance, the Brooke family resided at Cobham Hall and Cooling Castle in Kent. Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, was attainted in 1603, when the peerage became abeyant instead of becoming extinct. In 1916, the attainder was removed and the abeyance terminated in favor of the fifteenth baron. The twelfth to fourteenth barons never actually held the title. This creation became abeyant again in 1951. The second creation was in 1324, when Sir Ralph de Cobham was summoned to parliament as Baron Cobham. The history of this creation is unknown following the death of the 2nd baron in or after 1378. The third creation was in 1326, when Sir Stephen de Cobham of Rundale, in the parish of Shorne in Kent (adjacent to Cobham) was summoned to parliament, again as Baron Cobham. Sir Stephen de Cobham was a cousin of Henry de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham of Cobham.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, n.s., vol.III This creation became abeyant no later than 1429. The fourth creation was in 1342, when Reginald de Cobham was summoned to parliament. However, this creation became extinct on the death of the second baron in 1403. The fifth creation was in 1645, when John Brooke was created Baron Cobham, but this title became extinct upon his death in 1660. There was a sixth creation in 1714, in the Peerage of Great Britain, for Sir Richard Temple, 4th Baronet. Since he had no children, there was a seventh creation for him in 1718, when he was created Baron Cobham again and Viscount Cobham (both titles with a special remainder), and the latter two titles are extant. He was grandson of Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet and his wife Christian, daughter of Sir John Leveson and his wife Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Sondes and his wife Margaret, daughter of William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham. ==Barons Cobham (of (Cobham, in) Kent); First Creation (1313)== * Henry Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham (1260\u20131339) * John de Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham (d. 1355) * John Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham (d. 1408) * Joan de la Pole, suo jure 4th Baroness Cobham (d. 1434), grand-daughter of the 3rd Baron (daughter of Joan Cobham and Sir John de la Pole) **John Oldcastle, jure uxoris Baron Cobham (d. 1417), the 4th of the 5 husbands of Joan de la Pole, 4th Baroness Cobham * Joan Braybrooke, suo jure 5th Baroness Cobham (d. 1442), the 4th Baroness's daughter by her second husband Sir Reynold Braybrooke * Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham (d. 1464), son of the 5th Baroness by her husband Sir Thomas Brooke (d.1439) of Holdich, Devon * John Brooke, 7th Baron Cobham (d. 1512) * Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham (d. 1529) * George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham (1497\u20131558) * William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (1527\u20131597) * Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham (1564\u20131619) (attainted 1603) * William Brooke (MP, died 1643) (1601\u20131643) (heir but for the attainder - abeyant on death) * William Boothby (1721\u20131787) (became heir to the peerage, but for the attainder, in 1747) * Mary Disney (1716\u20131789) (heiress but for the attainder - abeyant on death) * Gervase Disney Alexander, 15th Baron Cobham (1880\u20131933) (abeyance and attainder terminated in 1916) (abeyant on death) * Robert Disney Leith Alexander, 16th Baron Cobham (1885\u20131951) (abeyance terminated 1951, abeyant again on death) On the death of the 16th Baron Cobham in 1951 the title again fell into abeyancy; the senior co-heir to the barony is Simon Rhys Shaw, a writer and great-nephew of the last Baron. ==Barons Cobham; Second Creation (1324)== * Ralph Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham (d. 1326) * John Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham (1324/1325-aft. 1378) (extinct?) ==Barons Cobham (of Rundale); Third Creation (1326)== * Stephen Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham of Rundale (d. 1332); neither of his descendants were summoned to parliament * John Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham of Rundale de jure (1319\u20131362) * Thomas Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham of Rundale de jure (1343\u20131394) * Reynold Cobham, 4th Baron Cobham of Rundale de jure (d. 1405) * Thomas Cobham, 5th Baron Cobham of Rundale de jure (d. 1429) (abeyant on death) ==Barons Cobham (of Sterborough); Fourth Creation (1347)== * Reynold Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham of Sterborough (c. 1295\u20131361) * Reynold Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham of Sterborough (1348\u20131403) * Reynold Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham of Sterborough de jure (1381-aft. 1446) * Margaret Cobham, 4th Baroness Cobham of Sterborough de jure (d. 1466-1471) * Thomas Cobham, 5th Baron Cobham de jure (d. 1471) (abeyant on death) * Anne Cobham, 6th Baroness of Cobham (d. 1526) ==Barons Cobham; Fifth Creation (1645)== * John Brooke, 1st Baron Cobham (1575\u20131660) (extinct) ==Barons Cobham; Sixth Creation (1714)== * Richard Temple, 1st Baron Cobham (1675\u20131749) (extinct) ==Barons Cobham; Seventh Creation (1718)== * Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham (1675\u20131749) * see Viscount Cobham ==Arms== The arms of Cobham of Cobham and Cooling, both in Kent, Barons Cobham \"of Kent\" are Gules, on a chevron or three lions rampant sable.
