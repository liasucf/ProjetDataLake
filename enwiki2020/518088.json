    "text": "Kenneth Donovan \"Ken\" Clark (June 4, 1927 - June 1, 2009) was an American B movie actor. He appeared in movies in the United States and Europe, including the Secret Agent 077 trilogy, South Pacific, and a number of Spaghetti Westerns. ==Early years== Clark was born in Neffs, Ohio. He enlisted in the Navy when he was 17, and after being honorably discharged, he sought a career as an actor. When that effort was unsuccessful, he found employment as a model and as a construction worker. He also worked as a coal miner in the mid 1950s near Cadiz Ohio. ==Acting career== ===Early career=== Clark was originally contracted to 20th Century Fox. While working for that studio, he acquired a reputation as a \u201cbeefcake\u201d actor similar to Richard Egan. He appeared in a variety of genres of film, including crime (Six Bridges to Cross), Western (The Last Wagon), and musical (South Pacific). Additionally, in one of his final roles for Fox, he appeared in Elvis Presley\u2019s debut motion picture, Love Me Tender. Fox dropped Clark following that picture, and his roles in the following years were often in lower-budget films. Clark's most prominent role in American film came in 1958, when he was cast as Stewpot in South Pacific, an adaptation of the Broadway musical. His vocals were dubbed by Thurl Ravenscroft. Following the film\u2019s premiere, the New York Times described Clark\u2019s character as a \u201craffish gob.\u201d During this period, Clark made many guest star appearances on a variety of American TV shows, including four appearances on Alfred Hitchcock Presents.Ken Clark Filmography at IMDb In 1959, he made an unsold private investigator TV pilot for a William Campbell Gault-inspired mystery series entitled Brock Callahan, directed by Don Siegel and written by Stirling Silliphant. That same year, he made a guest appearance in an episode of Western TV series Colt .45. During this period Clark had the lead in Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and 12 to the Moon (1960). The former is regarded by some as Clark\u2019s \u201cmost memorable film.\u201d ===1960s: Agent 077=== During the 1960s and 1970s, like many other American actors Clark went to Italy appearing in several sword and sandal films, spaghetti westerns and Eurospy films, including the Hercules film The Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness, starring fellow American actor Dan Vadis, in 1963. In 1965, Clark originated the role of Secret Agent Dick Mallory in the Agent 077 trilogy modeled on James Bond. In one of the pictures from that trilogy, From the East with Fury, Mallory seeks to rescue a kidnapped nuclear scientist. ===1970s: Westerns=== In 1971, Clark appeared alongside James Garner in Un Uomo Chiamo Slitta (translated as A Man Called Sledge). == Personal life and death == Clark was married to Bette Blatt, whom he met when they were in high school. They had three children and were divorced in 1980. According to fellow actor Robert Woods, Mr. Clark died of a heart attack in Rome, Italy on June 1, 2009 shortly after a taping for a program on the mid 1960s Eurospy genre on the TV series Stracult. ==Partial filmography== Adapted from IMDB and TV Guide. *On the Threshold of Space (1956) - Sgt.
