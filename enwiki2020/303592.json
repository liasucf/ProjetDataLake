The design of the 42nd GRAMMY AWARDS logo, also known as the Millennium Logo (because it was the first music awards for the incoming 21st century), was commissioned to Mark Deitch and Associates. The actual design was conceived and executed by Raoul Pascual. Michael Green of the Recording Academy stipulated that the logo should encompass all forms of musical genre and (whatever the design) the GRAMMY logo had to be prominently featured. Raoul's concept was to represent music with some of its major instruments: the clarinet for woodwinds, the piano for percussion, the guitar for strings plus a microphone: \"I imagined all the instruments emanating from behind the logo. My problem was how to translate that into a visual. I designed black and white icons of the instruments using a vector program. I was working overtime and I was getting desperate. I was moving the different icons around the GRAMMY logo but none of the combinations seemed to work. As I picked up the guitar icon, I decided to pray and make a deal with God. I said 'if you bless me with a winning design, I will give you the glory every time I share how I designed the GRAMMY logo.' Suddenly, I inadvertently released my hold of the icon and it fell on top of the GRAMMY logo. I stared at the image on my screen and I saw my solution. I added the other icons and curved them to suggest movement from behind. Eureka! That was it!\" With suggestions from the staff and the people at the Recording Academy in the course of several weeks, the design underwent an evolution from a 2 dimensional rendering into 3D. ==References== 042 Category:2000 in American music Category:2000 in California Category:2000 music awards Category:2000 in Los Angeles Category:2000 awards in the United States Category:February 2000 events in the United States ",
