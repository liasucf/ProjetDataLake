However, William McCaslin died in 1858 by falling from a barn, and construction stalled. In 1861, Lucinda hired a contractor named Dick Gibbons for $1,000 to finish the home. ==Description== The William Henry and Lucinda McCaslin Farm House is a two-story frame structure built in an L-shaped configuration.
