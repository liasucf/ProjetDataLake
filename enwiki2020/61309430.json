    "text": "Santos Dumont Museum House (), better known as The Enchanted (), is a museum located in the municipality of Petr\u00f3polis, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The house of Santos Dumont in Petr\u00f3polis is a picturesque residence embedded in a steep town in the city, built in 1918. The street chosen today is called Enchanted Street and in Petr\u00f3polis, the house was nicknamed \"The Enchanted\". It was built with the help of engineer Eduardo Pederneiras. The house has some peculiarities, as one of his latest inventions is the shower with hot water, the only one of Brazil at that time, being heated with alcohol, and also the external staircase where you can only start climbing with the right leg, and the internal one where one can only start to climb with the left leg, and the very architecture of the house where no partitions are used between the rooms. In the house there is no kitchen and Santos-Dumont called the restaurant Palace Hotel to deliver his food. Today there is the Catholic University of Petr\u00f3polis where there was the restaurant. The house has three floors, plus an observatory, over the roof. The second book of the Aviator, the work What I Saw, What We're Going to See, was written in that house in 1918. After the death of Santos-Dumont, the house was donated to the City Hall of Petr\u00f3polis by his nephews so that \"an institution was installed that would maintain his memory.\" On July 14, 1952, the house was registered by IPHAN and today it is part of the National Historical and Artistic Heritage. ==References== Category:Alberto Santos-Dumont Category:Biographical museums in Brazil Category:Houses in Brazil Category:Literary museums in Brazil Category:Historic house museums in Brazil ",
