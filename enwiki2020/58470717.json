    "text": "Joys of the Youth () is a Soviet drama film of 1987. ==Plot== In order to get a credit for physical education, which they skipped, the company of students of the technical school persuaded classmate (Zudina) to fall in love with the physical education teacher (Lyubshin) and persuade him. The girl begins to hunt for an unapproachable bachelor teacher. Unexpectedly for all, he falls in love with a student. Moreover, the girl understands that she herself is not indifferent to the teacher. History, conceived as a rally, becomes a drama for its participants. ==Cast== *Stanislav Lyubshin as Anton Mikhailovich Gorshkov *Marina Zudina as Svetlana Bobylyova * Aleksei Serebryakov as Pan * Natalia Nazarova as Marya Gavrilovna * Valentina Telichkina as Nina Vasilievna * Viktor Pavlov as Svetlana's father * Vyacheslav Nevinny as Shustrick == Criticism == Director Yevgeny Gerasimov is not suspected of blind love for the younger generation. In the very title of his picture there is an ironic warning to those who are delighted with the youth looseness of the late eighties, and their own concern about the spiritual lack of spirituality of the younger generation.\u041d\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e Lyubshin played a physical education teacher so that you can fall in love with him. A really good picture, a love story in which problems and realities are depicted, but not an end in itself. A good love story is always interesting.\u041e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0435 \u00ab\u0417\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044b\u0445\u00bb ==References== ==External links== * * 35 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0432 Category:Soviet drama films Category:Soviet films Category:1987 drama films Category:Gorky Film Studio films ",
