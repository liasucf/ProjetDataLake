The ship began her sea trials on 9 March 1868 and was put into reserve at Brest in 1869. She was commissioned on 12 April 1870, shortly before the Franco-Prussian War began, and assigned to the Northern Squadron.de Balincourt and Vincent-Br\u00e9chignac 1976, p. 29 On 24 July 1870 she departed Cherbourg in company with the rest of the Northern Squadron and they cruised off the Danish port of Frederikshavn between 28 July and 2 August until they entered the Baltic Sea. The squadron, now renamed the Baltic Squadron, remained in the Baltic, attempting to blockade Prussian ports on the Baltic until ordered to return to Cherbourg on 16 September.de Balincourt and Vincent-Br\u00e9chignac 1975, p. 30 On 1 August 1873 Jeanne d'Arc was in M\u00e1laga, Spain and departed later that day bound for Cadiz.Ward, Vol. 76 On 21 July 1875, Jeanne d'Arc was participating in a naval exercise involving six ironclads \u2013 the broadside ironclad , operating as the flagship, and five central battery ironclads including Jeanne d\u2032Arc \u2013 and a number of smaller ships in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the east coast of Corsica . The ironclads were steaming in beautiful weather at in two parallel columns, with Magenta leading one column, followed by Jeanne d\u2032Arc and , and leading the other, followed by and , when at 12:00 noon the admiral commanding the squadron ordered the screw corvette , operating as a dispatch vessel, to pass astern of Magenta to receive orders. Attempting to place his ship in the column between Magenta and Jeanne d\u2032Arc, the commanding officer of Forfait misjudged his turn, and Jeanne d\u2032Arc collided with Forfait. The impact was barely noticeable aboard Jeanne d\u2032Arc, but her ram bow tore into Forfaits side. Forfait sank 14 minutes later, her crew of 160 taking safely to her boats; her commanding officer floated free from the bridge as Forfait sank beneath him, but also was rescued.Rockwell, p. 146dawlishchronicles.blogspot.com The ramming of the Forfait by the Jeanne d\u2019Arc, 1875 On 3 December 1875, Jeanne d\u2032Arc became the flagship of Rear Admiral Bonie, but she was placed in reserve on 1 January 1876 at Brest, France.
