    "text": "World Youth Day 2019 () was the 16th World Youth Day, an international event organized by the Catholic Church and focused on faith and youth. Taking place 22\u201327 January in Panama City, Panama, it was the first of its kind celebrated in Central America. Pope Francis announced plans for the event at the end of the closing Mass of World Youth Day 2016 in Brzegi near Krak\u00f3w, Poland, on 31 July 2016. ==Theme== On 22 November 2016, Pope Francis announced the theme for World Youth Day 2019: I am the servant of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word (Lk 1:38). The theme coincided with the goals of the XV Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on youth, faith and vocational discernment, held in 2018. ==Logo and Hymn== On 14 May 2017, the WYD 2019 logo was revealed during a Eucharistic meeting. The design was chosen from 103 proposals submitted to the Archdiocese of Panama in a contest that was won by Ambar Calvo, an architecture student. The Panama Canal appears as a symbol of the journey that pilgrims travel to Jesus guided by Mary. The pilgrim's cross also appears. The points mean two things: they are the crown of the Virgin, but also the pilgrims who are on their way to travel the continents. Like the logo, the creation and edition of the official anthem was submitted to a contest, where several proposals were presented to the Archdiocese of Panama, which was conquered by Abdiel Gonz\u00e1lez. On 3 July, during the XLVII Bread and Wine Dinner held at the ATLAPA Convention Center, it was presented to around 3,000 people, in the presence of Panamanian bishops and President Juan Carlos Varela. The Archbishop of Panama, Jos\u00e9 Domingo Ulloa Mendieta, said that \"this hymn expresses the mission to which we are called adisciples and missionaries in these times, following the example of the Virgin Mary\". The hymn of the event was named Be It Done to Me, according to Your Word, and was launched by Archbishop Mendieta of Panama on 3 July 2017, in the Panamanian capital. ==Announcement== Pope Francis announced plans for the upcoming event at World Youth Day in Krak\u00f3w on 31 July 2016. The president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, accompanied the announcement. Francis also said that he did not know if he would be on this journey as St. Peter's successor: \"I do not know if I will be in Panama, but Peter will be.\" ==Journey== The main event center of this journey was Campo Santa Maria La Antigua.

A country that made every effort to have each of you have an encounter with Jesus Christ: the Way, Truth and Life.\" The archbishop recalled that Panama was the first diocese on the mainland of the Americas, where the Gospel was spread to the rest of the American continent, and spoke of gratitude to God for hosting this WYD: \"Our people are ready to receive you, to share their traditions, multiethnic and pluricultural wealth, but in a very special way, share the joy of faith in a God who is acting among us in our personal and community history.\" ===Second Day (23 January)=== ====Catechesis==== The first day of pilgrims' catecheses with the bishops took place. ====Pope's arrival to Panama==== Participants awaiting the arrival of Pope Francis at the Tocumen International Airport Pope Francis departed from Rome on 23 January, landing at Panama City Airport at 4:30 pm local time after a trip that included traveling 9,500 km over 10 countries during 13 hours' flying time.g1.globo.com/mundo/ The Supreme Pontiff was received by the Panamanian President Varela, local bishops and about two thousand young people, who sang the well-known phrase in Spanish \"This is the Pope's youth\".

He emphasized the Gospel of Luke (Luke 15: 2) in the homily when the Pharisees and scribes attempted to condemn Christ for sitting at the table with those who were considered sinners. After the Penitential Liturgy, some of the young people deprived of their liberty were able to confess to the Holy Father and to some bishops.

The theme chosen for this moment was \"reality of the young and the Martyr Church\". Young people of Latin America prayed the 14 stations that portray the journey of Christ to Calvary, remembering the sufferings present today throughout the world. The young people of Brazil, for example, performed for the eighth station the passage of the Gospel of Mark 15:21 on Simon of Cyrene, embellished with the message \"May the cross of others be our cross. Let us be united and take with love the immense cross of the world\", and that young people who feel defeated should not lose hope. In his reflection, the Pontiff said: The conclusion of the beautiful speech of the Pope was: \"We want to be a Church that supports and accompanies, who knows how to say 'I am here', in the lives and crosses of so many Christians who walk beside us.\" ===Fifth day (January 26)=== ====Basilica==== Pope Francis presided at the morning the Mass consecrating the altar of the Cathedral Basilica of Santa Maria la Antigua. The priests, consecrated men, and lay movements of Panama participated in the Mass. During the celebration, the Pope performed the rite of dedication of the altar of the cathedral, where relics of three Latin American saints were placed: Rose of Lima, \u00d3scar Romero, Martin of Porres, and a Polish saint, John Paul II. With this liturgical act, this became the first cathedral of America whose altar was consecrated by a pontiff. ====Lunch==== In the afternoon the Holy Father had a private lunch in the Major Seminary of St. Joseph with a group of 10 young people who participated in WYD, 5 boys and 5 girls, of different nationalities representing the 5 continents. ====Vigil==== After that, at night time, ending the day, the Pope presided over the vigil with about 600,000 young people in Campo S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Paulo II. The pilgrim image of Our Lady of Fatima was present throughout the event. The crowd was invited to listen to three testimonies: the first was that of Erika de Bucktron, mother of four children, and the youngest has Down syndrome, and it was recommended to her to perform an abortion of the latter. The second testimony was Alfredo Mart\u00ednez Andri\u00f3n, 20, who was a choirboy in his childhood, but the poverty of his family forced him to leave school to work. He fell into drugs and was arrested, but found help at the St. John Paul II Foundation. Finally came the testimony of 26-year-old Nirmeen Odeh of Palestine, who recognized that although she was baptized because of where she lived, she thought it better to be away from Christianity. However, at World Youth Day 2016, she discovered the love of Jesus. Later, through books like The Confessions of St. Augustine, she strengthened his faith. After the testimonies, Francis gave a speech, assuring the youth: \"Mary shows the power of God. With a few words, she knew how to say yes, trusting in the love and promises of God, the only force capable of making all things new.\" ===Sixth day (27 January)=== ====Closing Mass==== Pope Francis began his day with the closing Mass of WYD. At the beginning of the celebration, the Pope was addressed by Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Domingo Ulloa Mendieta, who thanked the opportunity given to the country to organize this edition of WYD: The Pontiff invited the young people to take up their \"missionary call now, and not in the future, following the example of Mary who said, 'Let it be done to me according to your word.' \" About 720,000 pilgrims were present at the Campo S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Paulo II \u2013 Metro Park. The passage from the Gospel that initiates the public life of Jesus was reflected in the homily reference to the synagogue where Isaiah's prophecy had been fulfilled: \"Jesus reveals the now of God, who comes to meet us, to call us also to take part in his now 'to proclaim the Good News'.\" At the end of the Mass, the Pope prayed to Our Lady, entrusting to her the young people of the whole world, and said goodbye to the pilgrims, announcing the site of the next WYD in 2022, in Lisbon, Portugal: Present at this Mass were the presidents of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela; of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado; of Colombia, Iv\u00e1n Duque; of Guatemala, Jimmy Morales; of El Salvador, Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n; and Honduras, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez. ====House of the Good Samaritan==== After Mass, the Pope went to the Good Samaritan House, presenting the place with an image of the Good Shepherd. ====Meeting with volunteers and farewell==== In his last appearance in Panama, before the 19,500 volunteers of the Journey, the Pope made a speech with which he concluded his visit. Three of these young people made a brief address to the Pope, expressing their experiences of volunteering and participating in WYD.
