    "text": "The 2000 United States Senate election in Delaware was held on November 7, 2000, in conjunction with the 2000 U.S. presidential election, other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives, and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator William Roth ran for re-election to a sixth term, but was defeated by Democratic Governor Tom Carper. Tom Carper became the 1st Democrat to hold this seat since 1947. == Major candidates == === Democratic === * Tom Carper, Governor of Delaware and former U.S. Representative === Republican === * William Roth, Incumbent U.S. Senator first elected in 1970 == Campaign == For 16 years, the same four people had held the four major statewide positions. Because of term limits on the Governor's position, Tom Carper could not run again. Both he and U.S. Representative Michael Castle wanted to be U.S. Senator. Roth would not retire, and fellow Republican Castle decided against a primary. Roth, 79, was in the U.S. Senate for 30 years. He was the Chairman of the Finance Committee. Carper, 53, was a popular Governor and former U.S. Congressman of Delaware's At-large congressional district, who announced his major candidacy against Roth back in September 1999. Both candidates were moderates. Roth was one of the few Republicans to vote for the Brady Bill. Although Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand.https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/62928651.html?dids=62928651:62928651&FMT;=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:FT&type;=current&date;=Oct+26%2C+2000&author;=Curtis+Wilkie%2C+Globe+Correspondent&pub;=Boston+Globe&desc;=IN+TIGHT+RACE%2C+HEALTH+ISSUES+DOG+DELAWARE%27S+ROTH&pqatl;=google In a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the issue seemed to be Roth's age versus Carper's relative youth. Carper defeated Roth by over ten points. Roth received more votes than Presidential candidate George W. Bush, suggesting the strength of the Democratic turnout was a boon to Carper's candidacy. Some consider Roth's defeat to be due to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once in the middle of a television interview and once during a campaign event.http://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s;_site=philly&p;_multi=PI&p;_theme=realcities&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=0EB7368E419B47F9&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=10&p;_sort=YMD_date:D&s;_trackval=GooglePMhttp://www.sussexcountyonline.com/campaign2000/results/ussenate.htmlhttp://cache.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/In_tight_race_health_issues_dog_Delaware_s_Roth+.shtmlhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s;_site=philly&p;_multi=PI&p;_theme=realcities&p;_action=search&p;_maxdocs=200&p;_topdoc=1&p;_text_direct-0=0EB7368E419B47F9&p;_field_direct-0=document_id&p;_perpage=10&p;_sort=YMD_date:D&s;_trackval=GooglePM ===Debates=== *Complete video of debate, October 15, 2000 == Results == == See also == * United States Senate elections, 2000 == References == 2000 Delaware Category:2000 Delaware elections ",
