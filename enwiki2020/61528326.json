Here Dr. Ung-Kyu Pak says follows, As a church historian, Dr. Sang Gyoo Lee accomplished a prolific career. His publications included 25 books, co-authorship of 26 books, edit of 5 books, translation of 5 books and 168 articles during his professorship at Kosin University from 1983 to 2017. In quantity and quality, his publications had tremendous impact in the area of church history. With an integrative approach to history, the topics of his writings encompassed the history and theology of the Western and Korean Christianity, studies of historic figures, history of missions, and many more. He also pioneered research on the histories of missions and local churches in South Kyung province. Especially, stemming from his interest in Early Christianity, he sought to promote understanding of the New Testament from a multidimensional perspective. Thus, his writings are ecclesiastically rooted on the biblical view of the church which holds many valuable applications for the present Korean churches. In sum, Dr. Lee can be regarded as one of great church historians for the church. In 2012, he was selected as the theologian of the year at the 500th Anniversary of John Calvin's birth and received an academic award from the Korean Evangelical Theological Society on October 27, 2018.\uace0\uc2e0\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc774\uc0c1\uaddc \uba85\uc608\uad50\uc218, \ud55c\uad6d\ubcf5\uc74c\uc8fc\uc758\uc2e0\ud559\ud68c \ud559\uc220\uc0c1 \uc218\uc0c1, \ubd80\uc0b0\uc77c\ubcf4, 2018-10-30 He served as president of the Korea Presbyterian Theological Society\ud55c\uad6d \uc131\uacbd\uc8fc\uc11d \ubbf8\ub798, \u2018\uc601\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc798 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83, christiantoday, 2014.11.22 and president of the Reformed Theological Society.\u2018\ub9cc\uc778\uc774 \uc81c\uc0ac\uc7a5\u2019\uc774\uba74 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc131\ub3c4\uc640 \ubaa9\uc0ac\ub294 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978\uac00, christiantoday, 2016.10.10 He is one of the editors of the International Theological Journal, Unio cum Christo.Journal editors Since March 2019, he has been a chair professor at Baekseok University. == Career == He studied at Kosin University, Presbyterian Theological College, and Australian College of Theology (Doctor of Theology).
