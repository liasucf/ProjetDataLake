    "text": "Charlie Walker (born 8 March 1990) is an English semi-professional footballer who plays as a striker for club Eastbourne Borough. ==Career== ===Early career=== Walker was born in Brighton, East Sussex. He was spotted playing in the Brighton, Hove & District League by the Sussex County Football Association chairman in 2010, who later became chairman of Sussex County Football League Division One club Shoreham and recommended Walker to the manager. After scoring 15 goals for Shoreham by December 2011, he signed for Lancing, for whom he netted a further 21 goals to help them finish second in the table, which earned him a move to Isthmian League Premier Division club Whitehawk. Walker subsequently signed for neighbours Peacehaven & Telscombe, and finished 2013\u201314 with 43 goals, as the club won the Isthmian League Division One South title and the Sussex Senior Challenge Cup. ===Luton Town=== Walker signed for League Two club Luton Town from Peacehaven & Telscombe on 19 July 2014, after being recommended by his former Whitehawk manager Darren Freeman. He debuted in a 2\u20131 win away to Stevenage on 4 October and made five further appearances for the club. However, it was announced in May 2015 that Walker's contract would not be renewed. ====Loan to Boreham Wood==== On 20 February 2015, Walker signed for Conference South club Boreham Wood on loan until the end of 2014\u201315. He scored on his debut a day later with the fourth goal in a 4\u20131 victory away to Weston-super-Mare. Walker completed the loan spell with one goal from 13 appearances, as the club won promotion to the National League for the first time in their history with a 2\u20131 victory over his former club Whitehawk in the Conference South play-off final after extra time, in which he was introduced as a substitute for Junior Morais. ===Aldershot Town=== On 19 June 2015, Walker signed for National League club Aldershot Town on a one-year contract. He debuted on the opening day of 2015\u201316 in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Gateshead and scored his first goal on 29 August in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Eastleigh. Walker then scored five goals in four appearances in September to help Aldershot win four out of five matches. A further three goals in five appearances in October took his tally for the season to nine goals. Walker finished his first season at Aldershot as the club's top scorer with 14 goals from 44 appearances, as they finished 15th in the National League. After the end of the season, he signed a new one-year contract. Walker suffered ankle ligament damage in pre-season ahead of 2016\u201317, which kept him out for six weeks. He made his first appearance of the season after being introduced as a 71st-minute substitute in a 1\u20131 draw away to former loan club Boreham Wood on 13 September 2016. His first goal of the season came with the third goal in a 3\u20130 win at home to Gateshead on 24 September. However, Walker made only four starts for Aldershot and was released by mutual consent on 21 December to find a club where he would play regularly in the first-team. ===St Albans City=== Walker signed for National League South club St Albans City on a one-and-a- half-year contract on 4 January 2017. After signing, assistant manager Lee Allinson said \"He's the all-round striker. Strong, fast, can score great goals and on his day is pretty much unplayable.\" He debuted three days later in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Maidenhead United. ===Eastbourne Borough=== Walker signed for fellow National League South club Eastbourne Borough on 5 June 2018. ==Personal life== Prior to becoming a professional footballer with Luton Town, Walker was a self-employed builder. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Luton Town |2014\u201315 |League Two |3||0||2||0||0||0||1||0||6||0 |- |Boreham Wood (loan) |2014\u201315 |Conference South |9||1||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||4||0||13||1 |- |rowspan=3|Aldershot Town |2015\u201316 |National League |40||14||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||44||14 |- |2016\u201317 |National League |13||2||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||1||15||3 |- !colspan=2|Total !53!!16!!4!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!2!!1!!59!!17 |- |rowspan=3|St Albans City |2016\u201317 |National League South |18||7||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||20||7 |- |2017\u201318 |National League South |37||7||3||1||colspan=2|\u2014||7||1||47||9 |- !colspan=2|Total !55!!14!!3!!1!!colspan=2|\u2014!!9!!1!!67!!16 |- |rowspan=4|Eastbourne Borough |2018\u201319For FA Cup second qualifying round: For FA Cup third qualifying round: For Sussex Senior Cup second round: For FA Trophy third qualifying round: For FA Trophy third qualifying round replay: For Sussex Senior Cup third round: For Sussex Senior Cup quarter-final: |National League South |35||11||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||6||1||44||12 |- |2019\u201320 |National League South |29||7||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||5||35||12 |- |2020\u201321 |National League South |3||1||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||5||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !67!!19!!6!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!11!!6!!84!!25 |- !colspan=3|Career total !187!!50!!15!!1!!0!!0!!27!!8!!229!!59 |} ==Honours== Peacehaven & Telscombe *Sussex Senior Challenge Cup: 2013\u201314 *Isthmian League Division One South: 2013\u201314 Boreham Wood *Conference South play-offs: 2014\u201315 ==References== ==External links== *Charlie Walker profile at the Eastbourne Borough F.C. website * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Brighton Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Shoreham F.C. players Category:Lancing F.C. players Category:Whitehawk F.C. players Category:Peacehaven & Telscombe F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Boreham Wood F.C. players Category:Aldershot Town F.C. players Category:St Albans City F.C. players Category:Eastbourne Borough F.C. players Category:Isthmian League players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ",
