    "text": "{| |} The Yakovlev Yak-130 (NATO reporting name: Mitten) is a subsonic two- seat advanced jet trainer and light fighter originally developed by Yakovlev and Aermacchi as the \"Yakovlev-Aermacchi Yak-130/AEM-130\". It has also been marketed as a potential light attack aircraft. Development of the aircraft began in 1991 and the maiden flight was conducted on 25 April 1996. In 2002, it won a Russian government tender for training aircraft and in 2009 the aircraft entered service with the Russian Air Force. As an advanced training aircraft, the Yak-130 is able to replicate the characteristics of several 4+ generation fighters as well as the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57. It can also perform light-attack and reconnaissance duties, carrying a combat load of 3,000 kg. ==Development== Yak-130 at the Zhukovsky Airfield, 1999 In the early 1990s, the Soviet government asked the industry to develop a new aircraft to replace the Czech-made Aero L-29 Delf\u00edn and Aero L-39 Albatros jet trainers. Five design bureaus put forward proposals. Among them were the Sukhoi S-54, Myasishchev M-200, Mikoyan MiG-AT, and Yakovlev Yak-UTS. In 1991, the other proposals were dropped and only the MiG-AT and Yak-UTS remained. The air forces of the newly independent Russia estimated that its requirement would be about 1,000 aircraft. Development of Yak-UTS started in 1991 and the design was completed in September 1993. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, Yakovlev was compelled to look for a foreign partner. After having entered discussions in 1992, in 1993 it agreed with the Italian company Aermacchi to jointly develop the plane, which now became Yak/AEM-130; Aermacchi would be responsible for the project's financial and technical support. The first prototype, dubbed Yak-130D, was built by Sokol at Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, and was publicly unveiled in June 1995. The aircraft made its first flight on 25 April 1996 from Zhukovsky Airport at the hands of Yakovlev chief test pilot Andrey Sinitsyn. In 2000, differences in priorities between the two firms had brought about an end to the partnership, with each developing the aircraft independently. The Italian version was named M-346; Yakovlev received US$77 million for technical documents of the aircraft. Yakovlev would be able to sell the aircraft to countries such those in the Commonwealth of Independent States, India, Slovakia and Algeria. Aermacchi would be able to sell to NATO countries, among others. In March 2002, Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Mikhailov said that the Yak-130 and the MiG-AT had been chosen as the Russian Air Force's new trainers. The Yak-130, however, was said to be superior as it could serve the dual role of a trainer and combat jet. On 10 April 2002, it was announced that Yak-130 had been chosen as the winner of the tender for trainer aircraft for basic and advanced pilot training, beating the MiG-AT. By then, the Russian Air Force had ordered 10 Yak-130s, and the total cost of research and development, which included the construction and testing of the four pre-production aircraft, had amounted to some $200 million, 84% of which was financed by Yakovlev and the rest by the Russian government. However, it was reported that as much as $500 million had been spent in as early as 1996. Plans to develop a light-attack aircraft based on the Yak-130 came to a halt in the late 2011. Dubbed Yak-131, the aircraft failed to meet critical pilot safety requirements put forward by the Russian Air Force. The air force had instead shifted focus to a replacement based on the Sukhoi Su-25, which was slated to enter service by 2020. ==Design== The underside of a Yak-130 Yak-130 is an advanced pilot training aircraft, able to replicate characteristics of Russian 4th and 5th generation fighters. This is possible through the use of open architecture digital avionics compliant with a 1553 Databus, a full digital glass cockpit, four-channel digital Fly-By-Wire System (FBWS) and Instructor controlled and variable FBWS handling characteristics and embedded simulation. The type also has a Head-up display (HUD) and a Helmet-Mounted-Sighting-System (HMSS), with a double GPS/GLONASS receiver updating an Inertial Reference System (IRS) for highly accurate navigation and precision targeting. The developer estimates that the plane can cover up to 80% of the entire pilot flight training program. flares In addition to its training role, the aircraft is capable of fulfilling Light Attack and Reconnaissance duties. It can carry a combat load of , consisting of various guided and un-guided weapons, auxiliary fuel tanks and electronic pods. According to its chief designer Konstantin Popovich, during a testing phase that ended in December 2009, the plane was tested with \"all airborne weapons with a weight of up to 500 kg that are in service in the Russian Air Force\". Yak-130 has nine hard points: two wingtip, six under-wing and one under-fuselage. Yak-130 at MAKS 2005 air show The aircraft's twin engines are mounted under extended wing roots, which reach as far forward as the windscreen. Two Ivchenko Progress AI-222-25 Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) produce a combined total of 49 kilonewtons (11,000 pound- force) of thrust. An upgraded, \"-28\" engine is also on offer, increasing the thrust to . At a normal Take-Off Weight of , a Thrust-to-Weight ratio of 0.70 is achieved with the \"-25\", or 0.77 with the \"-28\" engines. This compares with 0.65 for the BAE Systems Hawk 128 and 0.49 for the Aero Vodochody L-159B. Maximum internal fuel capacity is . With two external combat fuel tanks the figure increases to . Maximum true airspeed is Mach 0.93 (572 knots), service ceiling is 12,500 metres (41,000 feet) and load factors are from \u22123 to +9 g. Typical Take-Off speed and distance in a \"clean\" configuration are and 550 m (1,800 ft), whilst landing figures are and , respectively. Cross wind limit is . The Yakovlev Yak-130 is equipped with the FBWS controlled engine intake blanking doors, in order to prevent the aircraft's engines from sustaining Foreign object damage when operating from unpaved runways and grass strips. The large canopies are sideways hinged. Combat training suite on the Yak-130 includes simulated and real firing systems with air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, bomb dropping, gun firing and on-board self-protection systems. ==Operational history== Yak-130 at MAKS-2011 Yak-130 prototype completed its maiden flight, registered as RA-43130, on 25 April 1996 at Zhukovsky airfield. On 30 April 2004, the first pre-series Yak-130, assembled at the Sokol plant in Nizhny Novgorod, performed its maiden flight. The plane was put on display for the first time at the Paris Air Show in June 2005. It was followed by three more pre-series aircraft. In December 2009, the aircraft completed state trials and was accepted for service in the Russian Air Force. === Accidents and incidents === * 26 June 2006: A Yak-130 prototype crashed in the Ryazan region.

The Russian Air Force intends to buy at least 72 Yak-130s, enough to equip four training regiments.Author: Marcel van Leeuwen Commander-in- Chief, Colonel General Aleksandr Zelin, announced on 8 November 2011, that the Russian Defence Ministry was to sign a contract within two weeks with Irkut Corporation for 65 additional aircraft \u2013 55 firm orders plus 10 options. Zelin stated that deliveries were expected to be completed by 2017. The first serial aircraft was handed to a training center in Lipetsk on 19 February 2010. Once the 2005 contract for 12 Sokol plant-made Yak-130s for the Russian Defence Ministry was fulfilled in June 2011, a decision was made that all subsequent Yak-130 orders, both domestic and export ones, would be handled by the Irkutsk Aviation Plant of the Irkut Corporation.Author:Mikhail Suntsov Cadets learning to fly on Yak-130 journal Take-off, 12 April 2013 However, the Russian Air Force only took delivery of the first Yak-130 by the Irkutsk in October 2012. \"The first batch of Yak-130 combat trainers flew from the Irkut plant to the Borisoglebsk airfield, after an extensive flight testing program\", stated Colonel Andrei Bobrun. In February 2014 Irkut Corporation revealed a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) to supply additional Yakovlev Yak-130 advanced jet trainer aircraft to the National Air Force. According to Irkut president Oleg Demchenko, the company in December signed a contract with the Defense Ministry on the delivery of 12 Yak-130 aircraft to form a new aerobatics team. At the same time, second contract occurred to be signed for 10 more aircraft, for the Russian Naval Aviation.
