The name (Old Swedish: Dis\u00e6\u00feingThe article Disatinget, in the encyclopedia Nordisk familjebok. or Disa\u00feingThe article Distingen, in the encyclopedia Nationalencyklopedin.) originally referred to the great assembly called the Thing of all Swedes, and it is derived from the fact that both the market and the thing were held in conjunction with the D\u00edsabl\u00f3t, the great bl\u00f3ts (sacrifices) for female powers called d\u00edsir (they include the NornsThe article Dis in Nordisk familjebok (1907). and the ValkyriesThe article Diser in Nationalencyklopedin (1991).) at the Temple at Uppsala. They were all originally held at the end of February or in early March. The Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, who was well- informed of Swedish matters and visited the country in 1219,[http://www.foteviken.se/historia/ynglinga/yng_start.htm The article Snorres Ynglingasaga at the site of the Foteviken Museum, Sweden. explained in the Heimskringla (1225): > In SvithjodAn obsolete name for Sweden, or more specifically the old > territory which today is named Svealand.

In 1611, the first play in the Swedish language named Disa by Johannes Messenius was enacted at the Disting showing a late medieval legend explaining the origins of the Disting, as the pagan origins had been forgotten.The article Disa, in the encyclopedia Nordisk familjebok. Instead of being held in honour of female powers, it was held in honour of a heroic girl who had prevailed on the king and the assembly to stop a great massacre of the weak and elderly to hinder overpopulation. The market was officially abolished in 1895, but continued informally, and it still held in early February. It is one of the most traditional Swedish markets. ==References and notes== Category:Annual fairs Category:Uppsala Category:Retail markets in Sweden Category:Tourist attractions in Uppsala County Category:History of Uppsala ",
