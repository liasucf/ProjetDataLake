    "text": "Integrin alpha-V is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ITGAV gene. == Function == ITGAV encodes integrin alpha chain V. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. Alpha V undergoes post-translational cleavage to yield disulfide-linked heavy and light chains, that combine with multiple integrin beta chains to form different integrins. Among the known associating beta chains (beta chains 1,3,5,6, and 8; 'ITGB1', 'ITGB3', 'ITGB5', 'ITGB6', and 'ITGB8'), each can interact with extracellular matrix ligands; the alpha V beta 3 integrin, perhaps the most studied of these, is referred to as the Vitronectin receptor (VNR). In addition to adhesion, many integrins are known to facilitate signal transduction. ==Alpha V class integrins== In mammals the integrins that include alpha-V are : {| class=\"wikitable\" | Name || Synonyms || Distribution || Ligands |- | alpha-v beta-1|\u03b1V\u03b21 || || ocular melanoma; neurological tumors || vitronectin; fibrinogen |- | \u03b1V\u03b23 || vitronectin receptor || activated endothelial cells, melanoma, glioblastoma|| vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, osteopontin, Cyr61 |- | \u03b1V\u03b25 || || widespread, esp. fibroblasts, epithelial cells || vitronectin and adenovirus |- | alpha-v beta-6|\u03b1V\u03b26 || || proliferating epithelia, esp. lung and mammary gland || fibronectin; TGF\u03b21+3 |- | alpha-v beta-8|\u03b1V\u03b28 || || neural tissue; peripheral nerve || fibronectin; TGF\u03b21+3 |} ==Clinical significance== Overexpression of the ITGAV gene is associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer. ==As a drug target== The mAbs intetumumab, and abituzumab target this protein which is found on some tumour cells. == See also == * Cluster of differentiation == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * == External links == * *ITGAV Info with links in the Cell Migration Gateway Category:Clusters of differentiation Category:Integrins ",
