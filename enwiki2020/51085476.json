The second piece was performed on 22 November 1911 in Berlin, conducted by John Petersen. The three Ch\u00f6re were recorded in 2009 in a collection of Reger's choral works, along with the Hebbel Requiem, among others, by the chamber choir Consortium and the pianist Christopher Glynn, conducted by Andrew-John Smith. == Autograph == The autograph of the work was acquired in 2014 by the Max-Reger-Institute from the dissolved archive of the Schott Verlag in Mainz. Susanne Popp, a Reger scholar and the director of the institute, notes that in Opus 6, Reger noticed reading the proofs from the publisher that his handwriting was a problem because of many dynamic markings in addition to many notes, and that he therefore began to write the dynamics in red, a habit he kept for life. The autograph was presented in an exhibition of the Baden State Library in 2015, in preparation for the Reger Year 2016. == References == == Bibliography == * * * * Category:Choral compositions Category:Compositions by Max Reger ",
