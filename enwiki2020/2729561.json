    "text": "Carson City is a 1952 American Western Warnercolor film directed by Andre DeToth and starring Randolph Scott, Lucille Norman, and Raymond Massey. Based on a story by Sloan Nibley, the film is about a railroad construction engineer whose plans to build a railroad line between Nevada's Carson City and Virginia City are met with hostility by the locals, who feel the trains will attract outlaws. Filmed on location at Iverson Ranch, Bell Ranch, and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park, Carson City was Warner Bros.' first film shot in WarnerColor. ==Plot== Mine owner William Sharon (Larry Keating) keeps having his gold shipments held up by a gang of bandits. Sharon hires banker Charles Crocker (Thurston Hall), who happens to have connections in the Central Pacific Railroad, to build a spur line from Virginia City to Carson City, so that the gold can be shipped by rail. Silent Jeff Kincaid (Randolph Scott) is the railroad engineer. However, there is opposition to the railroad, chiefly from another mine owner, Big Jack Davis (Raymond Massey). He doesn\u2019t own a working mine; he finds it easier to rob from the other owners. Davis is the brains behind the gang holding up Sharon\u2019s shipments. The technique is to hold up the stagecoach and then provide food and champagne for the passengers, who then don\u2019t care that the gold is robbed. Kincaid vows to rid Carson City of the bandits, but they frame him on a murder charge. In the climax, Kincaid has to contend with a suspicious landslide which kills some of his workers, trapping others, and a gold bullion heist. ==Cast== * Randolph Scott as Silent Jeff Kincaid * Lucille Norman as Susan Mitchell * Raymond Massey as A.

One branch of the real-world railroad ran from Carson City to Virginia City. The railroad as a whole was built to serve the silver mines of Nevada, primarily Virginia City's Comstock Lode. The section that ran from Carson City to Virginia City was restored and reopened in 2009, as a heritage railroad. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1952 films Category:1952 Western (genre) films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:English-language films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films directed by Andre DeToth Category:Films scored by David Buttolph Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Rail transport films ",
