The network's flagship station is XEIPN-TDT channel 11 in Mexico City. It broadcasts across Mexico through nearly 40 TV transmitters and is required carriage on all Mexican cable and satellite providers. The network also operates an international feed which is available in the United States via satellite from DirecTV, via online from VEMOX and also on various cable outlets, on \"Latino\" or \"Spanish\" tiers. Most of its programs are also webcast through the Internet, though its programming is not the same as the actual broadcasters or satellite signal. ==History== The network began broadcasting on March 2, 1959, when its flagship station became the first non-profit educational and cultural television station in Mexico, owned and operated by a Mexican institution of higher education. The television channel was conceived by Alejo Peralta y D\u00edaz, the director of the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional between 1956 and 1959, and supported by his successor Eugenio M\u00e9ndez Docurro, as well as Secretary of Communications and Transportation Walter Cross Buchanan and Jaime Torres Bodet, Secretary of Public Education. Its first broadcast was a mathematics class transmitted from a small television studio located at the Casco de Santo Tom\u00e1s, in the northern part of Mexico City. In 1969, Canal Once was the first Mexico City TV station to relocate its transmitter to Cerro del Chiquihuite, in order to improve its signal. It would later be joined on the mountain by most of Mexico City's other television stations as well as several radio broadcasters. Around this time, Canal Once converted to color. By the 1980s, it already had four of its own studios. In the 1990s and 2000s, Once TV (as the network had been renamed in 1997) embarked on a two-pronged expansion strategy. The IPN built transmitters in cities such as Cuernavaca and Tijuana in the late 1990s, and in the 2000s and early 2010s, it expanded to build in the states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. It also allied with state networks, such as those of Guerrero, Nayarit and Quintana Roo, providing them with Once TV programs. The launch of the Organismo Promotor de Medios Audiovisuales, now the Sistema P\u00fablico de Radiodifusi\u00f3n del Estado Mexicano (SPR), in 2010 marked the beginning of a second expansion, which finally brought Once TV to such large cities as Guadalajara, Monterrey and Puebla. Logo used from 2011 to 2013. The SPR operates 26 transmitters to the IPN's 13, and all of them (with the exception of Mexico City) carry Canal Once as one of their subchannels. In 2013, Once TV M\u00e9xico returned to its original name of Canal Once as part of a branding refresh.La televisora del IPN retoma el nombre de Canal 11, Notimex 14 November 2013 In 2015, the IPN launched Once Ni\u00f1os, a subchannel of Canal Once featuring children's programming, which is available on all Canal Once transmitters operated by the IPN as well as on all Mexican cable systems.
