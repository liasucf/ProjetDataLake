It rises in the highlands to the south of Mount Erymanthus; it flows at first through a narrow ravine, and, anciently flowed into the Peneius, but now flows into the Pineios reservoir, a man-made lake created by the Peneus Dam. The river is called the Selleeis (\u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) by Homer. ==References== Category:Rivers of Greece Category:Landforms of Elis Category:Geography of ancient Elis Category:Locations in the Iliad ",
