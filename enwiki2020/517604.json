In restaurants, \u00e0 la carte is the practice of ordering individual dishes from a menu in a restaurant, as opposed to table d'h\u00f4te, where a set menu is offered. It is an early 19th century loan from French meaning \"according to the menu\".Oxford English Dictionary The individual dishes to be ordered may include side dishes, or the side dishes may be offered separately, in which case, they are also considered \u00e0 la carte. ==History== The earliest examples of \u00e0 la carte are from 1816 for the adjectival use (\"\u00e0 la carte meal\", for example) and from 1821 for the adverbial use (\"meals were served \u00e0 la carte\"). These pre-date the use of the word menu, which came into English in the 1830s.Richard Bailey, Eating Words, Michigan Today, 13 May 2008. \"Menu\", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th edition, Houghton Mifflin == See also == * Omakase * Table d'h\u00f4te, the opposite of \u00e0 la carte * Buffet * List of French words and phrases used by English speakers * Pro rata, a method of billing or other calculation based on proportional usage * * == References == ==Bibliography== * * Committee on Nutrition Standards for Foods in Schools, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine (2007).
