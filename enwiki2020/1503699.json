    "text": "The Bajaj Chetak was a popular Indian-made motor scooter produced by the Bajaj Auto company. The Chetak is named after Chetak, the legendary horse of Indian warrior Maharana Pratap. ==History== Originally based on Italian Vespa Sprint, Chetak was an affordable means of transportation for millions of Indian families for decades and is lovingly called Hamara Bajaj (Our Bajaj). Around 1980, the Vespa-licensed design was replaced with an all-new in-house design that shared the same general appearance and style. During its heyday its chief competitor was LML NV made by LML India as a licensed copy of the Vespa PX 150. In the face of rising competition from bikes and cars, Chetak lost ground in India, and production was discontinued in 2005 as Bajaj Auto stopped manufacturing scooters altogether. == Chetak Electric == On 16 October 2019, Bajaj Auto re-entered the scooter space by unveiling a new electric version of their Chetak scooter under the Urbanite EV sub-brand. The production of the Chetak Electric started on September 25, 2019 at the Chakan plant of Bajaj Auto. It is being launched initially in Pune (4 dealerships) and Bangalore (13 dealerships) in January 2020 and will be sold through select KTM dealerships. == References == == External links == * Category:Motor scooters Chetak Category:Indian motor scooters ",
