    "text": "Unfun is the debut studio album by American band Jawbreaker. It was first released on Shredder Records in 1990 on CD, LP and cassette formats. In October 2008, it was announced that the album was being remastered for release through drummer Adam Pfahler's label, Blackball Records. Pfahler said that there were \"'flutters' in that first pass, which is a techie way of saying that gummy leader tape splices between the songs made the beginnings and endings sound like they had been drinking, which is a longwinded way of saying that it was fucked up.\" This edition was released on March 30, 2010, adding the 7\" mix of \"Busy\". ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1990 albums Category:Jawbreaker (band) albums ",
