Szklarski admits that King is another \"urban whodunit\" but that it goes about it from a distinctively female point of view. Eric Volmers of the Calgary Herald found the fallibility of the character Derek Spears to be \"what promises to give King its continued dramatic tension.\" Bill Harris of Quebecor Media found King is \"not a cookie-cutter police procedural\" in that DS King's personal life is a significant part of the show. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * *King on Facebook - official facebook page * King on TV1 Australia Category:2011 Canadian television series debuts Category:2012 Canadian television series endings Category:Showcase (Canadian TV channel) original programming Category:Television series produced in Toronto Category:Television shows set in Toronto Category:2010s Canadian crime drama television series Category:Canadian police procedural television series Category:Television series by Corus Entertainment ",
