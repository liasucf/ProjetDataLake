This single-portion dish is quick to prepare, and can be eaten at any time of the day, from breakfast to a lunch or supper meal or snack. The name \"rolex\" comes from its method of preparation, with the chapati and the omelette rolled together (\"rolled eggs\"). This idea originated from a chapati seller's creativity in the Busoga region \"the basoga\" then the idea spread to Wandegeya next to Makerere University in Uganda, fueled by students who needed a quick meal because of time and budget limitations. A \"Rolex\" merchant frying chapatis The delicacy soon spread throughout Uganda. It became a popular food choice for its combination of convenience, low cost, and taste. Other terms and variations related to rolex include: * \"Titanic\": two or more chapatis used together in rolling the portion. * \"Kikomando\": the chapati is sliced and mixed with beans.
