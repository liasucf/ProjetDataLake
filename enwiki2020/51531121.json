All of Oklahoma's executive officers were up for election as well as the state's five seats in the United States House of Representatives, half of the 48 seats in the Oklahoma Senate and all 101 seats in the Oklahoma House, and five offices in each of Oklahoma's 77 counties. Voter turnout was 42.5% of the eligible population, a 12.6% increase over the 2014 midterms but still the third lowest in the nation.https://www.nonprofitvote.org/documents/2019/03/america-goes- polls-2018.pdf/ Due to Gary Johnson's results in the 2016 presidential election, the Oklahoma Libertarian Party had ballot status to run candidates in 2018. This was the first time an alternative party has been able to participate in mid-term elections in the state since 1998. Five Independents, led in a loosely coordinated effort by former Oklahoma Democratic Party chair Ivan Holmes, were candidates for statewide executive offices.https://newsok.com/article/5606704/state-office-independents-running- as-a-team-on-open-government The ballot order was determined by random drawing for placement of candidates by party. Results of the drawing on July 12 were that Libertarian candidates would be placed first, Republicans second, and Democrats third.http://ballot-access.org/2018/07/15/oklahoma-ballot-order- lottery-puts-libertarian-party-on-top-line-in-november-2018-election/ By statute, Independents are always listed after partisan candidates. ==State Constitutional Officers== {| class=wikitable ! style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9\" align=center rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Parties ! style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9\" align=center colspan=5 | Seats |- bgcolor=#E9E9E9 ! 2016 ! 2018 ! +/- !
