Its founding name was the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference with the final word changed to Council years later. The Council brings together leading thinkers, and decision makers from government and business in an informal setting to discuss and formulate ideas on the most significant challenges facing the Asia Pacific. It regularly develops and advocates regional policy initiatives to aid in the stable economic development of the region. PECC\u2019s regional community building efforts led to the establishment of the official APEC process in 1989, the Council is one of the three official observers of the APEC process. Participation in the PECC Process depends on a commitment to economic cooperation in the Pacific. PECC participants, seek to achieve increased, open regional economic cooperation and interaction, while recognizing both the realities of, and the benefits accruing from, global interdependence and continuing to encourage increased economic cooperation and interaction with other nations and regions. PECC organizes an annual General Meeting to develop strategic perspectives to promote the Pacific Community. Participants in the PECC General Meeting are delegates from PECC member committees and observers. There is a Standing Committee, the PECC's governing body, which consists of all of the full member committees, and two institutional members and invited associate member committees in a limited capacity. this SC meets once a year.PECC SC http://www.pecc.org/resources/doc_download/593-annex-4-pecc-standing- committee-members The Co-chairs are elected for 3-year terms, Dr Charles E.

It was held in conjunction with Canada-Asia 2013 and organized by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. The opening plenary session, 'Key Trends Shaping the Asia-Pacific\" examined the latest economic, political, and social trends in the Asia-Pacific, identifying the emerging opportunities and uncertainties in the region. Will slower economic growth be the norm in Asia over the next few years and how will this affect both the regional and global economy? What will be the impact of a rapidly growing urban population\u2014particularly one with an increasing middle class with evolving needs and expectations? Given the two on-going regional trade negotiations, what will be the future of trade in the Asia Pacific? The opening plenary session was followed by concurrent breakout sessions which covered diverse topics including: infrastructure deficit in the Asia-Pacific, creativity and innovation in Asia, promoting inclusive growth and resilient societies in Asia, green growth, and risks to growth in the Asia-Pacific. Later plenary sessions covered Canada's Asia strategy and how economies are responding to the rise of Asia. Thereafter, breakout sessions addressed Canada's contribution to sustainable growth in the Asia-Pacific, and preparation of Canada's next generation to compete in an international environment increasingly influenced by developments in Asia. The last time PECC GM was held in Vancouver was in November 1986 when Mr. Eric Trigg served as the International Chair of PECC. PECC General Meetings are open to the wider public and attended also by youth delegates who have been selected by their respective PECC member committees.Upcoming Official Schedule http://www.pecc.org/images/stories/events/2013/PECC_GM_Program_22Mar2013.pdf ==References== ==External links== * Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Official website * Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation * Asia pacific Category:International economic organizations Category:Mass media companies Category:Companies established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in Singapore Category:1980 in politics Category:Singaporean companies established in 1980 ",
