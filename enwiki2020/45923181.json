The rappers are allowed to initiate or respond to pre-game diss battles. === One- take video mission === The first mission in all seasons of Unpretty Rapstar was contestants collaborating with judges, producers, and fellow contestants to create a music video for an original rap song. The video is mostly filmed in one unedited take, and the rappers must also write and arrange the song. After the filming of the music video for the song is complete, the rappers vote for who did the best and worst, in a fully disclosed process. The winner of the mission receives an advantage for the next challenge or the next part of the track missions. Whoever is voted last by their fellow rappers receives a penalty of being excluded from the next mission, or from the song that was produced through the one-take mission. === Diss Battles === A series of one- on-one rap battles where the contestants put one another down through diss rap. Unlike rap battles in Show Me the Money, these are closed events with no MCs. ==Discography== == See also == * Unpretty Rapstar 2 * Unpretty Rapstar 3 ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 South Korean television series debuts Category:2015 South Korean television series endings Category:Korean-language television shows Category:South Korean music television shows Category:Music competitions in South Korea Category:Mnet (TV channel) original programming Category:Rapping Category:South Korean female rappers Category:Hip hop television ",
