    "text": "Henri-Eug\u00e8ne-Adrien Farcot (20 February 1830 in Sainville \u2013 14 March 1896 in Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s) was a French clock-maker, industrialist, inventor, mechanical-engineer, aeronaut, occasional writer and one of the most celebrated conical pendulum clock makers. In 1853 he established the Manufacture d\u2019horlogerie E. Farcot with headquarters, from 1855 (previously in rue Vieille-du-Temple, 75, Paris), in rue des Trois-Bornes, 39, Paris, wherein he worked until his retirement in the late 1880s, same as the successors, his son-in-law the Belgian Henri-Charles Wandenberg, or Vandenberg, until December 1903 and Paul Grenon (Wandenberg's nephew) until 1914. Between October 1855-March 1856 the company's name changed to Farcot et Cie, and in 1887 it was renamed Farcot et Wandenberg, although the partnership was officially constituted in April 1890.Juan F. D\u00e9niz, \u201cEl tiempo hecho arte: Los relojes monumentales de E. Farcot\", Estuco (2016): pp. 87-88. Farcot museum in Sainville. Throughout his career path, Eug\u00e8ne Farcot was awarded with one honorable mention and four medals in the following expositions: Besan\u00e7on 1860 (bronze), London 1862 (honorable mention), Paris (1863 bronze, 1867 bronze & 1878 silver), as well as Henri Wandenberg, both with a silver medal in Paris 1889 and a gold medal in Paris 1900.Juan F. D\u00e9niz, \u201cEl tiempo hecho arte: Los relojes monumentales de E. Farcot\", Estuco (2016): p. 88. In addition to clock-making, he was a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a\u00e9rostatique et m\u00e9t\u00e9orologique de France and the also defunct Chambre syndicale d'horlogerie de Paris. The Mus\u00e9e Farcot, in Sainville, preserves memories of his life, travels and work. == Patents == Of the nineteen patents registered to his name between 1855 and 1886, 16 are linked to horology.

This reputed, multi-awarded French firm provided the pedestal for the timepieces. Both the clock making company and the stone carver-supplier marketed the product. Drawing by D. Lancelot. In the section devoted to the French horology at the 1867 Paris world fair is seen another version of the statue by Carrier- Belleuse. Drawing by Lamy. A class of its own among the conical pendulum clocks are the monumental timepieces commercialized between 1862 and 1878. When this model debuted at the London International Exhibition of 1862, it was presented as the first application of the conical pendulum to statuary.Charles Gallaud, \u201cPremi\u00e8re Visite \u00e0 l\u2019Exposition des Arts Appliqu\u00e9s.

In addition to the British capital, it was also displayed in the Paris Exposition des beaux-arts appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019industrie (1863), as well as in the major world's fairs held in Paris (1867 & 1878) and Philadelphia (1876).Juan F. D\u00e9niz, \u201cEl tiempo hecho arte: Los relojes monumentales de E. Farcot\", Estuco (2016): p. 77. In his own words, Eug\u00e8ne Farcot explained the origins of his idea during the 1867 Paris universal exposition (translated from the French): Each mystery clock of this one-of-a- kind series was individually made and therefore, no two are alike. They are distinguished for their artistic/horological excellence where foremost, award- winning people from various arts, crafts and sciences, created a masterpiece of Second Empire decorative arts. Besides a remarkable precision in timekeeping, one of their most distinctive characteristics is the slow continual circular motion at a constant speed (instead of the conventional side to side swinging motion) of the noiseless pendulum, tracing a conical trajectory in space, hence its name. === List of units === It is unknown the total number of units crafted, so far 13 have been found. It is unclear if the company used a separate serial number for its large-scale conical pendulum clocks, although probably no more than twenty were ever made.

File:Cliffecastlemus 006.jpg|SN#25, exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1878). == The largest conical pendulum clock == The piece at the Galerie d'I\u00e9na, one of the main exhibition pavilions in the Palais du Champ- de-Mars at the Paris world fair of 1878. The artefact epitomizes the alliance between art and industry promoted back then and also the golden age of the conical pendulum clock (second half of the 19th century). Drawing depicting the grand vestibule of the Galerie d'I\u00e9na, both the clock and ceiling height have been magnified. In 1878, the largest conical pendulum clock ever built was erected in the missing Palais du Champ-de-Mars on the occasion of the Paris Exposition universelle internationale. It was his ultimate contribution to the conical pendulum clock, a type of timepiece not invented by the Frenchman, but that he brought to a new level of sophistication and engineering. Not to mention that he also helped to its popularization offering affordable mantel models, some with a patent of invention. The mechanical marvel was reviewed in several publications, next are included three of them: == During the Siege of Paris == The Louis Blanc over the clouds. Nadar shakes Farcot's hand, before taking off at 9:00 am from the Place Saint-Pierre in Montmartre. The Louis Blanc was the 10th balloon mail of 66 sent during the siege. Farcot and Traclet suffered a turbulent, risky landing in Belgium. While Farcot experienced with a light engine built for him for aerostats, caught his right thumb in the gears and had to be amputated,Wilfrid de Fonvielle, \"Eug\u00e8ne Farcot\", L\u2019A\u00e9ronaute, 29e ann\u00e9e, n.\u00ba 4, avril (1896): p. 76. expressing later when the Franco-Prussian War (translated from the French): This, however, did not impede him, during the Siege of Paris (1870\u201371), to leave the city on 12 October 1870 piloting the ballon mont\u00e9 (balloon mail) Louis Blanc, circumventing the siege and the Prussian shootings in order to transport the mail, government dispatches and eight carrier pigeons. He, and Auguste Traclet from the Association Colombophile de Paris, arrived in B\u00e9clers (Belgium) three hours later, becoming the first French aeronaut in Belgium.Wilfrid de Fonvielle, \"Eug\u00e8ne Farcot\", L\u2019A\u00e9ronaute, 29e ann\u00e9e, n.\u00ba 4, avril (1896): pp. 76-78. Despite bearing the name of the politician Louis Blanc, this, who was present at the departure, had refused to fly in a balloon mail when Wilfrid de Fonvielle asked him.Wilfrid de Fonvielle, \"Eug\u00e8ne Farcot\", L\u2019A\u00e9ronaute, 29e ann\u00e9e, n.\u00ba 4, avril (1896): p. 79. == Funereal discourse == Discourse pronounced before the tomb of the horologist by Paul Garnier, vice-president of the Chambre syndicale d'horlogerie de Paris (translated from the French): == Publications == * La navigation atmosph\u00e9rique, 1859. * Un voyage a\u00e9rien dans cinquante ans (unpublished), 1864. * Invention et contrefa\u00e7on.
