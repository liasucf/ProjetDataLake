    "text": "The Adelaide Times was an early newspaper founded by James Allen and printed in Adelaide, the capital of the then colony of South Australia. It was published between 2 October 1848 and 8 May 1858, and evolved through a series of names and publication frequencies, and closed due to uncertainty surrounding Allen's bankruptcy. == History == The Adelaide Times was established by James Allen, an experienced newspaper man who had just visited England in 1845-1848, in partnership with John Brown and William Barlow Gilbert. Allen had also previously worked on other local newspapers Southern Australian and South Australian Register, and periodicals such as South Australian Magazine and Monthly Almanac and Illustrated Commentator. The newspaper's original format and masthead was copied from The London Times. It was published weekly from October 1848; semiweekly from October 1849; three times a week from March 1850; and, daily from April 1850. As was common for the time, it also evolved through various titles, such as The Adelaide Times and General Commercial Advertiser (15 January 1849 \u2013 10 September 1849) and The Times (6 March 1850 \u2013 16 November 1853). In November 1853 Allen sold the newspaper to a consortium, including Richard Hanson, Robert Torrens, George Stevenson, John Brown, and Edward Gwynne. The Adelaide Times was then later sold to Allen's former partner, Gilbert, but in 1855 Gilbert went bankrupt and the newspaper was re-purchased by Allen, who himself went bankrupt in early 1858. Shortly afterwards, Reverend John Henry Barrow, a former editor of the South Australian Register founded the morning newspaper The South Australian Advertiser and a companion weekly The South Australian Weekly Chronicle. Gilbert, who was a nephew of Thomas Gilbert, later moved to Victoria, where he worked for The Argus and became a reporter for the Victorian Hansard. He next returned to Adelaide, where he held various Government positions. He died on 13 March 1893. == References == == External links == Category:1848 establishments in Australia Category:Defunct newspapers published in Adelaide Category:Newspapers on Trove ",
