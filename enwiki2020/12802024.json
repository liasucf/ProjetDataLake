He was also appointed Treasurer of Llandaff Cathedral. He was involved in theological debates with Socinians and Antinomians, publishing A Preservative against Socinianism (in four parts, between 1693 and 1703) and A Vindication of the Doctrine of Original Sin from the exceptions of Dr. Daniel Whitby (1711).
