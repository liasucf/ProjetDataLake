On 16 March 2020, Cricket South Africa suspended all cricket in the country for 60 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 24 March 2020, Easterns and KwaZulu-Natal were named as the joint-winners of the tournament. KwaZulu-Natal finished top of group B, with Easterns named joint-winners despite not topping their group, but played one match fewer than other teams, with their victory coming via an average points calculation. This was following the recommendations made by Graeme Smith, the acting Director of Cricket. The competition was played between the thirteen South African provincial teams. In previous editions of the competition, Namibia had also competed, but they withdrew ahead of the start of the previous tournament, citing issues around costs and logistics. Unlike its counterpart, the CSA Franchise 4-Day Cup, the matches were three days in length instead of four. The tournament was played in parallel with the 2019\u201320 CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge, a List A competition which featured the same teams. Eastern Province and Northerns were the defending champions, after the title was shared. On 17 October 2019, in the match between Gauteng and Boland, Lauren Agenbag became the first woman to stand as an on-field umpire in a first-class cricket match in South Africa. In January 2020, Andrea Agathangelou and Yaseen Valli made an opening partnership of 485 runs for Easterns against Boland, breaking the previous record in a first-class match in South Africa of 424 runs set in the 1926\u201327 season. ==Points table== Pool A {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! style=\"width:200px\"|Team !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| |- style=\"background:#cfc\" | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Eastern Province | 10 || 3 || 1 || 6 || 0 || 153.66 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Easterns | 9 || 2 || 0 || 7 || 0 || 138.46 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Free State | 9 || 2 || 1 || 5 || 1 || 125.86 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gauteng | 9 || 1 || 1 || 7 || 0 || 119.90 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| KwaZulu-Natal Inland | 10 || 1 || 1 || 7 || 1 || 107.18 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Boland | 9 || 1 || 3 || 5 || 0 || 93.66 |} Pool B {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! style=\"width:200px\"|Team !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| |- style=\"background:#cfc\" | style=\"text- align:left;\"| KwaZulu-Natal | 9 || 5 || 2 || 1 || 1 || 145.42 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Northerns | 9 || 2 || 0 || 7 || 0 || 138.13 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Northern Cape | 9 || 3 || 1 || 4 || 1 || 132.96 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Western Province | 9 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 0 || 124.22 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| North West | 9 || 2 || 2 || 5 || 0 || 114.44 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| South Western Districts | 10 || 1 || 6 || 3 || 0 || 87.80 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Border | 9 || 0 || 6 || 3 || 0 || 45.04 |} ==Fixtures== ===October 2019=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===November 2019=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===December 2019=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===January 2020=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===February 2020=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===March 2020=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Final== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:South African domestic cricket competitions CSA 3-Day Provincial Cup Category:2019\u201320 South African cricket season CSA 3-Day Provincial Cup CSA 3-Day Provincial Cup ",
