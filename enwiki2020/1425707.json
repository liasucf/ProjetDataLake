    "text": "Parazi\u021bii (Romanian for \"The Parasites\", ) is a Romanian three-man rap and hip hop group founded in 1994. It is widely regarded as one of the seminal acts of rap in Romania. It consists of Cheloo (C\u0103t\u0103lin \u0218tefan Ion), Ombladon (Bogdan Ionu\u021b P\u0103stac\u0103), and FreakaDaDisk (Petre Urda). == History == The group was subject to multiple restrictions by the Romanian National Audiovisual Council, due to explicit language. Romanian television and radio stations were repeatedly fined for playing some of their videos/songs and two videos were banned outright. This motivated their song \"Jos cenzura!\" (\"Down with Censorship!\") which criticized the Social Democratic government and was released shortly before the local elections in June 2004; the music video includes a monologue of Larry Flynt blasting Romania's government for its censorship practices. Ombladon, member of the group, won the Best Romanian Act Award at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004 with the song \"Egali din na\u0219tere\" (Born Equal). In 2003 they established their own label, \"20CM Records\", providing launch pads for Romanian hip hop artists such as Spike and Guess Who. Their first recorded track, \"\u00cen jur\" (\"Around\" - a pun on \u00cenjur - I curse), dated September 13, 1994, represented Parazi\u021bii's breakthrough. At the \"Nici o problem\u0103\" (No Problem) album release concert, a big fight started due to the La Familia-R.A.C.L.A. musical war. Parazi\u021bii first performed out of Romania in 2000 by participating at the \"Summer Hits\" festival in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, along with the groups BUG Mafia and Zdob \u0219i Zdub. In 2002 and 2003 the group performed in tours in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the group lost the opportunity to perform in a Canada-USA tour. The most important event remains the act at the Wuppertal Rap-Attack festival (2004) when Parazi\u021bii were the only group to perform before the well known rap/hip-hop artist Grandmaster Flash. Parazi\u021bii were part of major campaigns like \"Playback\" / \"Shoot Yourself\" (2001), in which they took a firm position against lip synching, or \"Instigare la cultur\u0103\" (Instigation To Culture) (2004) against ignorance among Romania's youth. Parazi\u021bii tracks were featured on movie soundtracks like \"Nordrand\" (Austria), \"Visul lui Liviu\" (Liviu's Dream), \"Milionari de weekend\" (Weekend Millionaires) or \"Marfa \u0219i banii\" (The Goods and The Money). ==Discography== *1995 - Poezii pentru pere\u021bi (Poetry For The Walls) *1996 - Nimic normal (Nothing Normal) *1997 - Suta (The Hundred) *1999 - Nici o problem\u0103 (No Problem) *2000 - Iart\u0103-m\u0103 (Forgive Me) *2001 - Categoria grea (Heavyweight) *2001 - \u00cempu\u0219c\u0103-te (Shoot Yourself) (maxi single) *2002 - \u00cen focuri (In Flames) (maxi single) *2002 - Bad Joke (maxi single) *2002 - Irefutabil (Irefutable) *2004 - Jos cenzura (Down with Censorship) (maxi single) *2004 - Best of... primii 10 ani (Best of...
