    "text": "\"Kissing a Fool\" is a song written and performed by George Michael and released by Columbia Records in 1988. A ballad with minimal instrumentation and a jazz feel, the song was written about Michael's insecurities as a soulmate and partner because of the baggage and reputation with which he came. According to Michael, the vocals were recorded in a cappella in one take. \"Kissing a Fool\" was the working-title for the album, which later was renamed to Faith. Aside from Michael's vocals, the song employs piano, guitar, bass, drums, and a brass section. It was the seventh and final single to be released from the album Faith. It was also the least successful, making number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and becoming the first single in five not to make number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. However, it reached number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and became a number 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining a fan favourite and being regarded critically as one of his most accessible and honest recordings. \"Kissing a Fool\" was Michael's last single for almost two years in the United Kingdom. It was later covered by Michael Bubl\u00e9 on his self-titled album and released as a single in the United States and reached number 29 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. ==Track listing== ===7\": UK / Epic EMU 7=== # \"Kissing a Fool\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Kissing a Fool\" [Instrumental] \u2013 4:34 ===12\": UK / Epic EMU T7=== # \"Kissing a Fool\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Kissing a Fool\" [Instrumental] \u2013 4:34 # \"A Last Request (I Want Your Sex Part III)\" \u2013 3:48 ===CD: UK / Epic CD EMU 7=== # \"Kissing a Fool\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Kissing a Fool\" [Instrumental] \u2013 4:34 # \"A Last Request (I Want Your Sex Part III)\" \u2013 3:48 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== ;George Michael {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1988\u201389) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |55 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada (The Record's Retail Singles Chart) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) |41 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Spain (PROMUSICAE Top 40 Radio) |28 |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|4 |} ;Michael Buble {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (2003) !Peak position |- |US Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1988) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canadahttp://hitsofalldecades.com/chart_hits/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=175&Itemid;=49 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|61 |- |US Billboard Hot 100http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1988.htm | style=\"text- align:center;\"|91 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1987 songs Category:1988 singles Category:2003 singles Category:George Michael songs Category:Michael Bubl\u00e9 songs Category:Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Songs written by George Michael Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:Sophisti-pop songs Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Pop ballads ",
