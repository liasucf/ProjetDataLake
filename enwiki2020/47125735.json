In addition the committee imposed the following revisions: 1) the sequences in which the prostitute Franca appears half-dressed will be shortened as much as possible without disrupting the plot; 2) the scenes in which she takes on alluring poses and behaviors typical of her trade will be definitely deleted; 3) the scenes in which the priest is begging and in which the priest is speaking to Memmo (the latter to be shortened as much as possible) will be deleted. The first two scenes mentioned are considered immoral and offensive to decency, the other ones are considered offensive to religion.Italia Taglia Database of the documents produced by the Committee for the Theatrical Review of The Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, from 1944 to 2000.
