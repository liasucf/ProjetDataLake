Once Prague's principal airport, it is now used mainly as a military base for the Czech Air Force. It is very close to Let\u0148any Airport, located to the northwest, which has two green runways and is used these days as a venue for air shows and other events. Kbely airfield is no longer used as a front- line Czech Air Force base, but it is utilised by military transport aircraft of the Czech Air Force, and the VIP aircraft which are used to transport Czech politicians. Prague Aviation Museum is also located at this airport, with a collection that includes 275 aircraft. == History == Kbely Airport was built in 1918 and was Prague's only airport until the construction of Ruzyn\u011b Airport in 1937, on the northwest side of the city. It was the first Czechoslovak military airfield, and during the inter-war period was the venue for several major public air shows. Between 1918 and 1937, it served commercial aviation and was home base of Czechoslovak Airline (\u010cLS) and Czechoslovak Airlines (\u010cSA; now Czech Airlines). The first scheduled flight operated by Czechoslovak Airlines departed from Kbely for Bratislava in October 1923. == See also == * Prague Aviation Museum ==References== Kbely Kbely Airport Category:Buildings and structures in Prague Category:Airports established in 1918 Category:1918 establishments in Czechoslovakia Category:Military airbases ",
