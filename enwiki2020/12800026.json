Willis Sr. through Willis Broadcasting CompanyThe Founder of AM1260 WTJH with license holder Christian Broadcasting of East Point, Inc. In 2004, WTJH's owner Levi E. Willis Sr. and Willis Broadcasting had been in violation of a number of technical and public safety rules enforced by the Federal Communications Commission.http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2004/DA-04-1694A1.html The dispute was eventually settled in 2004 through sale of property held by the company. In December 2009 and again in March 2010, the station filed letters and applications to the Federal Communications Commission for the station to go silent. The FCC approved the request but the station was required to come back on the air by November 30, 2010 or the broadcast license would be revoked. On July 24, 2014, the FCC notified the owners that the station's license was deemed to be expired as of November 29, 2010, due to the station being remaining silent for well in excess of twelve months. ==References== ==External links== TJH Category:Radio stations established in 1965 Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2010 Category:Defunct religious radio stations in the United States Category:1965 establishments in Alabama Category:2010 disestablishments in Alabama TJH Category:East Point, Georgia ",
