Sun-Pat products were made in the United Kingdom by H S Whiteside, a family run firm, from their factory in Parkhouse Street, Camberwell, SE5. Whitesides produced a great variety of sweets, jellies, nut and chocolate products including nougat, chocolate brazils, slabs of toffee and chocolate, Lifesavers, and Elizabeth Shaw chocolates. Sun-Pat had a factory in Peckham, South London, which was bombed on 15 October 1940, during the blitz. Several girls were killed and many injured. Sun-Pat having already sold salted peanuts, produced the product for which they became most well-known, peanut butter in 1946. In 1958, H S Whiteside acquired Maconochie Brothers, and production was moved up to their factory in Hadfield, near Manchester. In 1965, Whitesides overstretched themselves financially, and the company was bought by Rowntrees in 1967. Rowntrees, in turn, was taken over by Nestl\u00e9 in June 1988. In the beginning of the 1990s, a range of cheese spreads were also produced under the Sun-Pat brand, but were later discontinued. In May 2002, after its acquisition of Nestl\u00e9's ambient food business, Premier Foods acquired Sun-Pat.Premier Foods history Retrieved on 15 June 2007 The factory in Hadfield was closed down in 2004, and production then moved to Histon, Cambridgeshire.Premier Foods plc Interim Results 2004 In October 2012, after its acquisition of Premier Foods' spreads and jellies business, Sun-Pat is currently owned by Hain Celestial Group.Hain Celestial Completes Strategic Acquisition In The United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * * Grace\u2019s Guide Category:Peanut butter brands Category:Premier Foods brands ",
