    "text": "The Cheshire Bowl is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organized by the Cheshire Rugby Football Union, and was introduced during the 2009\u201310 season with Winnington Park being the first ever winners. The Bowl is currently a stand-alone competition that is open to club sides based in Cheshire, Merseyside or the Isle of Man that are ranked at tier 8 (South Lancs/Cheshire 2) of the English league system - although some teams may be invited from outside the official leagues. It is the third most important competition organized by the Cheshire RFU behind the Cheshire Vase (2nd) and Cheshire Cup (1st). The present format is as a knock-out cup with a semi-final and final which is held at a neutral venue during the latter stages of the season (March\u2013May). At present Cheshire Bowl finals are held at the same date and venue as the Cheshire Vase final. ==Cheshire Bowl winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- |colspan=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"| {| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| | style=\"border:0;\"|Cheshire Bowl Finals | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| |} |- ! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Season ! style=\"background:#efefef\"|Winner ! style=\"background:#efefef\"|Score ! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Runners\u2013up ! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Venue |- align=left |- | 2009-10 || Winnington Park || 19-14 || Anselmians || Hartsfield, Moreton |- | 2010-11 || Winnington Park || 29-22 || Dukinfield || Crouchley Lane, Lymm |- | 2011-12 || Sale FC || 24-3 || Ashton-on-Mersey || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2012-13 || colspan=\"4\"| No Competition |- | 2013-14 || Bowdon || 32-27 || Oswestry || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2014-15 || Southern Nomads || 12-11 || Ashton- on-Mersey || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2015-16 || Hoylake || 29-22 || Dukinfield || Memorial Ground, Clatterbridge |- | 2016-17 || Hoylake || 25-20 || Winnington Park || The Vagrants Ground, Nantwich |- | 2017-18 || Winnington Park || 38-21 || New Brighton FC || Upper Park, Birkenhead |- | 2018-19 || Crewe & Nantwich || 21-8 || Winnington Park || Hartsfield, Moreton |- |} ==Number of wins== *Winnington Park (3) *Hoylake (2) *Bowdon (1) *Sale (1) *Southern Nomads (1) *Crewe & Nantwich (1) ==See also== * Cheshire RFU * Cheshire Cup * Cheshire Vase * Cheshire Plate * English rugby union system * Rugby union in England ==References== ==External links== *Cheshire RFU Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in England Category:Rugby union cup competitions in England Category:Rugby union in Cheshire ",
