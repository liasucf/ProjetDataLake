Originally a black metal band, they transitioned to a post- rock-influenced style on their second album Masterpiece of Bitterness. ==History== S\u00f3lstafir was formed in 1995 by guitarist/singer A\u00f0albj\u00f6rn Tryggvason, bassist Halld\u00f3r Einarsson, and drummer Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3li P\u00e1lmason. The band's name is the Icelandic word for sun beams (crepuscular rays). They soon recorded the demos \u00cd Nor\u00f0ri and Til Valhallar. Halld\u00f3r then left the band, and A\u00f0albj\u00f6rn and Gu\u00f0mundur recorded a promo tape as a duo in 1997. During this period, Svavar Austmann joined as the new bassist and the band began recording their debut full-length album, \u00cd Bl\u00f3\u00f0i og Anda. The album was not released until 2002 due to various recording delays and label disputes. Shortly after that album was completed, second guitarist S\u00e6\u00fe\u00f3r Mar\u00edus S\u00e6\u00fe\u00f3rsson joined the band and made his debut on the 2002 demo Black Death. The band began playing live in Iceland in 2002. After shopping around a three-track demo of new songs, S\u00f3lstafir signed with Spinefarm Records in 2005. Their second album Masterpiece of Bitterness was released by Spinefarm later that year. The album received positive reviews, with Metal Storm stating \"the perfect mix of non- Metal elements with metal ones makes it a necessary album for any Metalhead looking for something that breaks the mold of pre-established genres.\" Their third album K\u00f6ld was recorded in Sweden and released in 2009. Reviewers compared the band's sound to Enslaved and Neurosis, among others, while noting their unique post-black metal sound. The album was also noted for its addition of atmospheric passages. S\u00f3lstafir began to tour Europe regularly in 2010 and made their first of many open-air appearances at the Roskilde Festival that year. S\u00f3lstafir's fourth full-length album, Svartir Sandar, was released by Season of Mist in 2011. This album was the band's first chart placement, reaching no. 7 in Iceland and no. 11 in Finland. The song \"Fjara \" also entered the single charts and reached no. 1 in Iceland.. In 2013, \"Fjara\" remained in Iceland's top 100 songs of 20 years. This album signaled S\u00f3lstafir's retreat from black metal and move toward experimental atmospherics of the type practiced by fellow Icelanders Sigur R\u00f3s. Their fifth album \u00d3tta was released by Season of Mist in 2014, and was noted for its additional experimental elements like strings and piano. Three official music videos were released and the band performed Iceland's national television channel, R\u00daV's St\u00fadio \u00c1. In January 2015, the band announced that longtime drummer Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3li P\u00e1lmason had left the band for \"personal reasons\". Gu\u00f0mundur replied immediately via the band's Twitter account, explaining that he'd been \"stonewalled by ex-bandmates\" and forced out of the band by A\u00f0albj\u00f6rn Tryggvason. Gu\u00f0mundur was replaced by Hallgr\u00edmur J\u00f3n Hallgr\u00edmsson. After his departure from the band Gu\u00f0mundur formed post metal band Katla. S\u00f3lstafir released their sixth full-length album, Berdreyminn, in May 2017 on Season of Mist.Solstafir's 'Berdreyminn' Exposes the Dark Side of Utopia Upon its release Berdreyminn entered international charts, mostly top 50, across Europe. ==Members== A\u00f0albj\u00f6rn Tryggvason on the Barge to Hell 2012 ===Current=== * A\u00f0albj\u00f6rn \"Addi\" Tryggvason \u2013 guitar, vocals * Svavar \"Svabbi\" Austmann \u2013 bass * S\u00e6\u00fe\u00f3r Mar\u00edus \"Pj\u00faddi\" S\u00e6\u00fe\u00f3rsson \u2013 guitar * Hallgr\u00edmur J\u00f3n \"Grimsi\" Hallgr\u00edmsson \u2013 drums ===Former=== * Halld\u00f3r Einarsson \u2013 bass * Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3li P\u00e1lmason \u2013 drums === Timeline === ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * \u00cd Bl\u00f3\u00f0i og Anda, 2002 (Ars Metalli) * Masterpiece of Bitterness, 2005 (Spinefarm Records) * K\u00f6ld, 2009 (Spinefarm Records) * Svartir Sandar, 2011 (Season of Mist) * \u00d3tta, 2014 (Season of Mist) * Berdreyminn, 2017 (Season of Mist) * Endless Twilight of Codependent Love, 2020 (Season of Mist) ===EPs=== * Til Valhallar (EP), 1996 * Black Death (EP), 2002 * \u00d3tta (Radio Edit) + Til Valhallar (EP), 2014 * \u00d3tta Sampler EP / Bonus: Live at Hellfest 2014 (EP), 2014 * Tilberi (EP), 2016 * Silfur-Refur (EP), 2017 ===Demos=== * \u00cd Nor\u00f0ri (demo), 1995 * Promo Tape September 1997 (demo), 1997 * Black Death (demo), 2001 * Promo 2004 (demo), 2004 ===Singles=== * 2011: \"Fjara\" * 2012: \"\u00c6ra\" * 2013: \"\u00de\u00edn or\u00f0\" * 2014: \"\u00d3tta\" ===Splits/compilations=== * \"Fire & Ice - An Icelandic Metal Compilation\" (Compilation), 1997 * \"Fjara/Runaway Train\" (Split with Legend), 2014 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Icelandic black metal musical groups Category:Icelandic post-rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Musical quartets Category:Viking metal musical groups Category:Post-metal musical groups Category:Season of Mist artists ",
