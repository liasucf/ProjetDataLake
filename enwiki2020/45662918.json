    "text": "The 2015\u201316 season was Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol's 112th season in existence and the club's 85th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. It covered a period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016. ==Season overview== ===Pre-season=== \"La D\u00e9cima\" winning coach Carlo Ancelotti was sacked on 25 May 2015, after failing to guide the club to a major trophy the previous season. He was then replaced by Rafael Ben\u00edtez on 3 June 2015. Brazilian duo Casemiro and Danilo were bought from Porto for a fee of \u20ac7.5 million and \u20ac31.5 million respectively. Both signed long-term deals with the club, with Casemiro returning after Real Madrid exercised their buy-back clause option on the player. Spanish wingers Marco Asensio and Lucas V\u00e1zquez also joined the club, while Sami Khedira signed for Juventus after his contract was not renewed by the club. Javier Hern\u00e1ndez soon departed back to Manchester United after Madrid did not make his season-long loan from the last campaign permanent. The contracts of Dani Carvajal, Marcelo and Sergio Ramos were renewed for another six years and were set to expire in the summer of 2020. Pepe extended his contract until 2017. Casemiro's contract was extended to 2021. Iker Casillas left the club on 11 July 2015 and was transferred to Porto after 15 years with Los Blancos. Kiko Casilla was signed as the replacement on 17 July 2015. The schedule of the season was announced on 14 July 2015. On 18 August 2015, Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 was signed from Internazionale, while Marco Asensio was loaned to Espanyol. ===August=== Madrid started off their 2015\u201316 campaign with a goalless draw at Sporting de Gij\u00f3n. Asier Illarramendi was sold to Real Sociedad on 26 August 2015, while F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o was loaned to Monaco and Lucas Silva to Marseille. Madrid thrashed Real Betis in their home opener by a score of 5\u20130 after braces from Gareth Bale and James Rodr\u00edguez and a goal from Karim Benzema. ===September=== Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals and had an assist for Benzema in a 6\u20130 away win at Espanyol. With the five goals, Ronaldo set his Spanish league goal tally to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing Ra\u00fal's record of 228 goals in 550 games for Real Madrid in La Liga, becoming the all- time top scorer for Real Madrid in the Spanish league. Real started the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League season with a 4\u20130 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk. Benzema scored the opener and Ronaldo had yet another hat trick just four days after his last. A lone goal by Benzema lifted Madrid over Granada to maintain their winning streak. Benzema scored another brace to help Real record another victory at Athletic Bilbao. Against M\u00e1laga, Madrid came up with a goalless draw. ===October=== Real visited Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the first Madrid Derby of the season. Benzema gave Real the lead, but the game ended eventually in a 1\u20131 draw. Ronaldo became the all-time top goalscorer for Real Madrid with a goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Levante.

The lone goal was scored by Nacho. Goals from Sergio Ramos and James Rodr\u00edguez were not enough to get by Sevilla, as Real lost the game 2\u20133 and the lead position of the table.
