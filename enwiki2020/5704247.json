By 1947, the Cooks had moved to the United States, and settled in Laguna Beach, California. In 1953, Cook showed that he had talent in basketball and won the California Interscholastic Federation basketball player of the year award. He was awarded athletics scholarships to 13 different major universities but instead chose to go to Biola College. He earned a Bachelor's degree in Bible from Biola in 1957, and later received both a Master of Divinity degree and a Master of Theology degree from Talbot School of Theology. He spent several years working at Biola as both a coach and the school's athletic director. From 1963 to 1967, Cook and his wife Anna Belle served as missionaries in Cebu, Philippines with Overseas Crusades (founded by Dick Hillis). During this time, Cook traveled to 72 different countries doing various missions related activities and representing the College. Returning to Biola in 1967 as an Assistant Professor of Missions, Cook was then appointed Director of Intercultural Studies and Missions and helped to develop Biola's program in cross-cultural education. He earned his Doctor of Missiology (D.Miss.) in 1974 from Fuller Theological Seminary. Called to the presidency of O.C.
