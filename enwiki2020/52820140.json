    "text": "Pr\u00e8 (pron. ) is a neighbourhood in the old town of the Italian city of Genoa. It was one of the six sestieri of ancient Genoa. At present it is part of the Genoa's city I Municipio (Centro Est). Located close to the old harbour, it is likely the best-known neighbourhood of the old town of Genoa. == Etymology == Pr\u00e8 takes its name from the Latin word pr\u00e6dia (fields), because in origin this was a rural zone. The use of this term is documented since 1131.History of Pr\u00e8 in www.fosca.unige.it == Demographics == On 31 December 2015 there were 7,586 people living in Pr\u00e8, with a population density of 16,858 people per km\u00b2.Comune di Genova \u2013 Statistical Bulletin \u2013 February 2016, page 16 Map of Pr\u00e8 == Geography == Pr\u00e8 is located north west in the old town of Genoa, between two circles of city walls, the older Barbarossa walls (12th century) and the 14th century city walls, but includes also a small portion of old town inside the Barbarossa walls, with via del Campo. The neighbourhood occupies the semi-plain area between the port and the rear hill. The central and most characteristic area of the neighborhood is that of Via Pr\u00e8 and Via del Campo, with its narrow alleys (the typical Genoese \"caruggi\"), upstream of which is Via Balbi with its noble palaces. ==History== The first settlements in the area date back to the second half of 12th century, when outside of the \"Saint Faith Gate\" (now called \"Vacca's Gate\") of the \"Barbarossa\" walls some buildings were built to assist travelers along the road leading from the city to the west. Included were several hospitals, founded by religious orders to offer accommodation and assistance to Crusaders, pilgrims, and merchants who were traveling from the port of Genoa to the Holy Land and the East. The best known of these was the Commandery of St. John of Pr\u00e8, of the Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, or Knights Hospitaller, built in 1180.Corinna Praga, \"A proposito di antica viabilit\u00e0 genovese\" (\"About ancient Genoese roads\"), 2008 Fratelli Frilli Editori In the same period, dockyards for repairing ships were built in the near port, in the same place where two centuries later would be established the main base of the Genoese Navy.Touring Club Italiano, Guida d'Italia \u2013 Liguria, Milan, 2009 This first port terminal gave an economic boost to the development of the neighbourhood. In 1347, the whole neighborhood was enclosed into the city walls, by building a new section of walls on the north-west side. During the 17th century the noble families of Balbi and Durazzo built, upstream the neighbourhood some luxurious palaces along a new wide street, Strada Balbi. In the 19th century another important road was opened, Carlo Alberto road, suitable for transit of wagons coming to and from the port and in 1860 the Genoa Principe railway station was completed in the north west area of Pr\u00e8. In the 20th century, when the business centre of Genoa moved from the old town to De Ferrari Square, a period of decline began for Pr\u00e8, and after World War II some areas were populated by petty criminals who earned their living by cigarette smuggling, prostitution and receiving stolen goods.A. Dal Lago ed E. Quadrelli, La citt\u00e0 e le ombre: crimini, criminali, cittadini (The city and the shadows: crimes, criminals, citizens), Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore, Milan, 2003, During the seventies the alleys of Pr\u00e8 became a centre of narcotics smuggling, managed before by Italian mafias and later by non-EU immigrants, causing the abandonment by most of the original inhabitants and the consequent degradation of buildings.Article (in Italian) in www.casadellalegalita.infoVia Pr\u00e8 history in guide.travelitalia.com Today, after many years of decline also these areas of the neighbourhood are showing signs of recovery. == Architecture == === Palazzi dei Rolli === The \"Rolli di Genova\" were, at the time of the Republic of Genoa, an official list of public lodging palaces of eminent Genoese families which aspired to host, by draw, foreign notable people visiting Genoa. Most of these buildings still exist, and in 2006 forty-two of them were inscribed by UNESCO in the list of World Heritage Site. In Pr\u00e8 are 20 of these palaces (11 of which included in the list of World Heritage Site).

When he died, in 1932, the castle was donated to the city of Genoa, along with the collections he had gathered in his travels, that make up the original nucleus of the Museum of World Cultures, housed in the castle. === Vacca's Gate === Vacca's GateSt. Faith Gate, known as Vacca's Gate, was part of the \"Barbarossa\" city walls and was built in the 12th century.
