The Cambridge History of Japan was Toyotomi Hideyoshi's nephew (later adopted) and a Japanese samurai of the Sengoku period. He was the lord of Gifu Castle between 1591-1592. He was the second son of Hideyoshi's sister, Tomo, with Miyoshi Kazumichi. His childhood name was Kokichi and given that he is often confused with Hashiba Hidekatsu (fourth son of the Oda Nobunaga and also adopted son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi), historians refer to him as Kokichi Hidekatsu for convenience. He married Oeyo, daughter of Oichi and Azai Nagamasa and the sister of Yodo-dono. In 1592, he participated in the Japanese invasions of Korea launched by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, where he died of illness at Karashima (Kyosaito) [called Geoje Island, Korea]. His daughter Sadako married the regent Kuj\u014d Yukiie. == See also == * G\u014d, the Japanese Taiga drama that aired in 2011 == Notes == == References == * Hall, John Whitney, McClain, James L. and Jansen, Marius B.
