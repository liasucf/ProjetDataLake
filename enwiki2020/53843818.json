The single is taken from the debut album, Gravity and is sung by lead vocalist Linn Engstr\u00f6m, who also wrote the lyrics with Gibril Jobe. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that the song \"chugs with a synth-happy, reggae-spiced beat and a bit of throat-ravaging toasting by Gibril \"Mr. Gee\" Jobe.\" He noted that \"the focal point of the track, however, is singer Linn Engstrom, who has a reedy voice and an icy-cool delivery.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1995 singles Category:1995 songs Category:Sonic Dream Collective songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:English-language Swedish songs ",
