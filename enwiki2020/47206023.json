The mound is thought to date from c. AD 1 (mid-Iron Age), with the rath being added about AD 600.\"Longstone\" on Megalithomania According to Prof. Peter Danaher, Carrowkeel-style bowls from the complex site at Longstone seem to indicate a transitory camp of passage- tomb folk, and the hilltop was also used by Beaker, Food Vessel and Urn peoples, indicating that the site was a \"halting site\" for many thousands of years before the longstone and rath were made.Survey of the Megalithic Tombs of Ireland, Volume IV (1986), page 111. ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Tipperary ",
