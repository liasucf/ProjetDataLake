    "text": "Opanci with flat end, from North Macedonia. Opinca from Romania. Opanci are traditional peasant shoes worn in Southeastern Europe (specifically Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia, and also Romania and Albania). The attributes of the opanci (name in plural) are a construction of leather, lack of laces, durable, and various endings on toes. In Serbia, the design of the horn-like ending on toes indicates the region of origin. The opanci are considered a national symbol of Serbia, and the traditional peasant footwear for people in the Balkan region. ==Etymology== Serbo-Croatian \u00f2panak/\u043e\u0300\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a, as well as Bulgarian and Macedonian opinok/\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a, ultimately derive from Proto-Slavic word *op\u044cn\u044ak\u044a. Proto-Slavic *op\u044cn\u044ak\u044a is composed from the following parts: * the preposition/prefix *o(b)- \"around, on, etc.\" with final *b assimilated and the resulting geminated consonant cluster *pp simplified to *p * *-p\u044cn-, yielding Serbo-Croatian -pan- with strong jer *\u044c vocalized to /a/. *p\u044cn- is the ablaut form of the root of the verb *p\u0119ti (from earlier *pen-ti), originally meaning \"to extend, stretch, strain\" (cf. modern standard Serbo-Croatian verbs conveying the same notion such as n\u00e0p\u0113ti/\u043d\u0430\u0300\u043f\u0435\u0304\u0442\u0438, pr\u00f2p\u0113ti/\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0300\u043f\u0435\u0304\u0442\u0438, r\u00e0sp\u0113ti/\u0440\u0430\u0300\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0304\u0442\u0438, p\u00f2p\u0113ti/\u043f\u043e\u0300\u043f\u0435\u0304\u0442\u0438..), but subsequently coming to mean \"to climb\" (whence the meaning of modern standard Serbo-Croatian p\u0207ti/\u043f\u0435\u0311\u0442\u0438, p\u00e8njati/\u043f\u0450\u045a\u0430\u0442\u0438). * *-\u044ak\u044a, a Slavic suffix So literally, \u00f2panak would roughly mean \"climbing footwear\" or \"footwear made from stretched (animal hide)\". ==History== Archeologists found footprints of leather shoes worn by Geto-Dacians dating to 2500 BC. Trajan's Column in Rome features Dacians wearing this type of leather shoes. Archeological findings show that the local population was hunting wild game: foxes, deer, badgers, wolves, bears, whose skins were later manufactured. The nobility would wear game skin shoes, the poorer ones would wear calf or swine skin. In the past the traditional shoes were handcrafted out of leather processed at home. The piece of leather had to be larger than the sole, with holes on the side so that a thin string of leather can be filled in and it wraps the piece of leather around the foot, giving it the form of some footwear. The puckered form gave it a sharp tip. They would be worn over wool stockings or white pieces of clothing. Nowadays they are often used as part of the traditional costume by folk dance groups and folk artists. Dacian moccasins as seen in a statue at Museum Capitolini. Until 50 years ago, they were usually worn in rural areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania and Serbia.Eliznik.org.uk, South East Europe costume, peasant sandals Nowadays, they are only used in folk costume, for folkloric dance ensembles, festivals, feast days or other cultural events.
