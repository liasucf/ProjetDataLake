He served as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Surrey-Tynehead from May 2001 to May 2013. Hayer is an Indo-Canadian who is the son of assassinated journalist, Tara Singh Hayer. == Politics == After defeating Doug McCallum, the Mayor of Surrey, for the BC Liberal party nomination, Hayer competed for and was elected as the first Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the riding of Surrey-Tynehead. The riding includes Guildford, Fraser Heights, Fleetwood, Port Kells and Tynehead areas. Hayer was first elected in the 2001 provincial general election and was re-elected in 2005 and 2009. Hayer served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Multiculturalism and Immigration from 2005 to 2011. http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/arc_oic/0427_2008/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:(Dave%20Hayer)?5#hit2 Hayer was noted as a voice for moderate Sikhs in Greater Vancouver and as a consistent critic of terrorism and Sikh extremism. In 2010, an official with the Dashmesh Darbar Gurdwara (Sikh temple) that is extremely vocal in their support for the Khalistani separatist movement, advised Hayer and moderate Federal Sikh politician Ujjal Dosanjh that their attendance at an annual Sikh religious parade would be at their own risk; this prompted a police investigation, and prompted then-Premier Gordon Campbell to ask temple officials to apologize and Surrey mayor Dianne Watts to consider a review of the status of the following year\u2019s parade. On July 7, 2012, Hayer announced that he would not seek re-election in the May 2013 provincial election. \"Part of that decision was that if re-elected as MLA in May 2013, and then leave to run as an MP in 2015, it would have triggered an expensive by-election which would be costly for my constituents & that would have been the wrong thing to do for my community,\" noted Hayer. In 2013, Hayer criticized the Liberal government's Quick Wins ethnic outreach scandal.
