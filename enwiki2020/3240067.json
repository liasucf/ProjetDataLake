This passerine bird is generally found in chaparral, sagebrush, arid scrublands, and brushy hillsides, breeding in the southwestern United States (western Texas to southern California), and migrating in winter to north-central Mexico and Baja California Sur. There is also a non-migratory population in central Mexico. ==References== ==Further reading== ===Book=== * Tenney, C. R. 1997. Black-chinned Sparrow (Spizella atrogularis).
