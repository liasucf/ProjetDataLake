The platform was launched with the common interest of the family members of the victims of enforced disappearance in Bangladesh to learn the fate of their beloved one, who went missing after men in plainclothes posing as law enforcers picked them up from various places of the country. The platform, largely consists of the family members of Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders since most of the victims had political affiliation with the party, observes the \u201cInternational Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances\u201d every year in Bangladesh. According to local rights groups, more than 500 people disappeared after being picked up by government agencies since 2009 in Bangladesh. Human Rights Watch published a report on the victims of enforced disappearance in Bangladesh that stated that they have recorded at least 90 cases of enforced disappearance only in 2016. Mayer Daak is similar to that of Argentina's Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo which was founded by Argentine mothers whose children \"disappeared\" during the state terrorism of the military dictatorship, between 1976 and 1983. ==Background== Bangladesh Awami League came to power after winning the national election of December 2008 against the backdrop of a turmoil political condition after two consecutive regimes of BNP (2001\u20132006) and military-backed civil government (2007\u20132008) who were largely criticized for promoting extrajudicial killing with a view to reducing crime. Prior to the election, Awami League promised to put an end to the spate of extrajudicial killing by government agencies and custodial deaths. However, this practice never ended. In 2010, due to the former Prime Minister and BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia\u2019s eviction from her house, BNP started taking streets while on the other hand, their ally Jamaat- e-Islami supporters started demanding the release of their leaders who were involved in war-crime during Liberation War of Bangladesh. In this context, the government started taking repressive measures against the opposition groups and a few opposition leaders and their activists started disappearing under mysterious situation. The first victim to be recorded was a Dhaka City Corporation councilor Mohammad Chowdhury Alam who was also a member of BNP\u2019s central committee. He was abducted on June 25, 2010. After Chowdhury Alam, many other disappeared after being picked up by Police, RAB or DB, including a former minister, and many former Member of Parliament. Remarkably, a series of incidents of enforced disappearance occurred just before the national election of January 2014. ==History== The families of the victims of enforced disappearance started gathering together to ask the whereabouts of their loved ones from 2014 and have been observing the \u201cInternational Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances\u201d in Bangladesh. VOA) The name \u201cMayer Daak\u201d started being visible on local and international media from 2016, after it was founded on 12 March of the same year. The Human Rights Watch report on Bangladesh's enforced disappearance \u201cWe don\u2019t have them\u201d and \u201cJoint NGO Alternative Report to the UN Human Rights Committee on Bangladesh\u201d published in 2017 cited the name of this platform and the ordeals of the families. The first major gathering by the platform was a discussion organized on December 4, 2016 where family members of 20 enforced disappearance victims attended and narrated how their family members were picked up and never returned. ==Programmes and Activity== Mayer Daak has been observing the UN declared International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance and International Human Rights Day in Bangladesh since 2016. The platform is also credited for bringing the incidents of enforced disappearance, which is often taken lightly by the government, to the forefront of Bangladesh's politics. They observed International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance on August 29 in 2017 by organizing a discussion at the National Press Club of Bangladesh. 29 families came to join the hearing in presence of the noted citizens including Professor Asif Nazrul. To mark the International Day of Human Rights in 2017, Mayer Daak called for a gathering on December 10 of the year. Members of 24 families came together. By the April 2018, the platform managed to mobilize 85 families of the victims who disappeared during Awami League rule, between 2010 and 2017, and organized a mass-hearing on April 21 of the year where they detailed their ordeals and demanded the government to let them know what happened to their family members. On August 30, 2018, the platform organized a programme attended by at least 90 families. ==Reactions== Amid repeated calls and outcry, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh also the chief of Bangladesh Awami League, Sheikh Hasina opened up at the parliament in November 2017. She said: \u201cAs per statistics of 2009, 275,000 British citizens disappeared. Of them, the whereabouts of 20,000 is not known. If you consider America, the situation is even worse.\u201d In response to that, Bangladesh's major opposition group Bangladesh Nationalist Party's General Secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said: \u201cThe remarks about enforced disappearance that the prime minister made is her admission to the fact that they [the government] are involved in the incidents of enforced disappearance.\u201d Bangladesh's Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said the allegation that the government is pursuing a policy of enforced disappearance is totally baseless. He added: \u201cMany businessmen went into hiding failing to repay their loans in this country. Some people went missing after developing extramarital relationship.\u201d United Nations human rights experts have called on Bangladesh to act now to halt an increasing number of enforced disappearances in the country, in February 2017. In July 2017, New York-based rights defender group Human Rights Watch published a report on the enforced disappearance of Bangladeshis. Referring to the incidents, Brad Adams, the Asia Director of the organization said: \u201cThe Bangladesh government is making a habit of complete disregard for human rights, human life, and the rule of law.\u201d On July 28, 2018, The New York Times published an opinion piece titled: \u201cThe Opposition disappears in Bangladesh\u201d on the incidents of enforced disappearance in Bangladesh. ==References== Category:Forced disappearances in Bangladesh Category:Organisations based in Dhaka Category:2016 establishments in Bangladesh Category:Human rights in Bangladesh ",
