    "text": "Kevin Kelly (born 1 October 1993) is an Irish hurler who plays as a full- forward for the Kilkenny senior team. Born in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, Kelly first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Heywood Community School. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 and intermediate sides. He joined the senior panel during the 2015 league. At club level, Kelly is a one-time All-Ireland medallist in the junior grade with St. Patrick's Ballyragget. In addition to this, he has also won one Leinster medal and one championship medal in the same grade. ==Playing career== ===Minor and under-21=== Kelly first played for Kilkenny in 2010 when he joined the minor side. He won his sole Leinster medal on the field of play that year following a 1-20 to 0-10 trouncing of Dublin. The subsequent All- Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against Clare. \"The Cats\" were made to work hard before securing a narrow 2-10 to 0-14 victory, giving Kelly an All- Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. He was also named man of the match. Two years later Kelly was a key member of the Kilkenny under-21 team. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 4-24 to 1-13 trouncing of Laois. Kilkenny later faced Clare in the All-Ireland decider. A powerful second-half display, in which they outscored Kilkenny 1-10 to 0-4, saw Clare take their second-ever All-Ireland under-21 crown. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !colspan=\"3\"|National League !colspan=\"2\"|Leinster !colspan=\"2\"|All-Ireland !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Kilkenny |2015 |rowspan=\"5\"|Division 1A |3||1-09||1||0-01||0||0-00||4||1-10 |- |2016 |4||2-01||1||0-00||2||1-02||7||3-03 |- |2017 |1||0-00||1||0-00||2||0-03||4||0-03 |- |2018 |0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00 |- |2019 |2||1-19||0||0-00||0||0-00||2||1-19 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total |10||4-19||3||0-01||4||1-05||17||5-35 |} ==Honours== ===Team=== ;St. Patrick's *Kilkenny Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 2017 *All-Ireland Junior Club Hurling Championship (1): 2012 *Leinster Junior Club Hurling Championship (1): 2012 *Kilkenny Junior Hurling Championship (1): 2011 ;Kilkenny *Leinster Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 2012 *Leinster Under-21 Hurling Championship (1): 2012 *All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship (1): 2010 *Leinster Minor Hurling Championship (1): 2010 ===Individual=== ;Honours *All- Ireland Minor Hurling Final Man of the Match (1): 2010 ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:St. Patrick's hurlers (Kilkenny) Category:Kilkenny inter-county hurlers ",
