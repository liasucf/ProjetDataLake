He played ten seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and led the league in assists in four of those seasons. Born and raised in Chicago, Porter graduated from DuSable High School, then played point guard at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania. He played ten seasons (1972\u20131981; 1982\u20131983) in the NBA as a member of the Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets, Detroit Pistons, and New Jersey Nets. One of the most talented passers in league history, Porter led the league in both assists per game and total assists four times during his career. ==Career== In the 1972 NBA draft, Porter was the 39th overall pick, selected by the Baltimore Bullets in the third round. In his second year, he led the league in personal fouls with 319. While he received 320 the next year, he won his first of four assist titles (with 8.0 per game) in 1975. The Bullets reached the NBA Finals, but were swept by the underdog Golden State Warriors. In late August 1975, Porter was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Dave Bing and a first round draft pick used to select Tree Rollins. Porter suffered a knee injury in his second season with Detroit and appeared in only nineteen games. In the early start of his third season with the Pistons, he was traded with Howard Porter and cash to the New Jersey Nets for Al Skinner, a 1978 2nd round draft pick (used to select Terry Tyler) and a 1979 2nd round draft pick (used to select Tony Price). On February 24, 1978, Porter had 29 assists in a game against the Rockets while with the Nets. He also had 14 points and 5 rebounds in a season the led to his 2nd assist title, with 10.2 per game. The record would stand until Scott Skiles tallied 30 assists on December 30, 1990. After the season, he was traded back to the Pistons for Eric Money. In that season, he won his third assist title, with 13.4 per game. He had a 30 point-25 assist game, on March 9, 1979.Boston Celtics at Detroit Pistons Box Score, March 9, 1979 | Basketball-Reference.com Additionally he was the first player to record over 1,000 assists in a single season. It would be five years before another player would record over 1,000 assists. After that season, he signed as a veteran free agent with the Washington Bullets. The Detroit Pistons received a first round draft pick in 1980 (which ended up with Golden State, who selected Rickey Brown with that pick) and a 1982 first round pick (Used to select John Bagley) as compensation for his departure. Porter appeared in two playoff games that year and garnered nine assists as the Bullets fell in the first round. The following year, he had 9.1 assists per game, which was enough to win his final assist title.
