    "text": "Sean-n\u00f3s dance ( ; , ) is an older style of traditional solo Irish dance. It is a casual dance form, as opposed to the more formal and competition-oriented form of Irish stepdance. Sean n\u00f3s in Irish means \"old style\", and is applied to the dance form as well as sean-n\u00f3s song. These now less-common forms of Irish dance and traditional Irish singing have been documented in Irish history and by ethnomusicologists, but are still alive in parts of the Irish music scene. == Characteristics == Sean-n\u00f3s dance is characterised by its \"low to the ground\" footwork, improvised steps, free movement of the arms, and an emphasis upon a \"batter\" (which sounds out more loudly the accented beat of the music). It is counted in beats of 8. It is traditionally a solo dance form. Because sean-n\u00f3s dancing is improvisational, it is not necessary for a pre-arranged routine or choreography to be decided upon by the dancer. Spontaneous expression is highly valued. Therefore, it is less common to see groups performing synchronised sean-n\u00f3s dance (which requires choreography in advance). Instead, the dancers may dance in turns, playing off the energy of the other. == Contrasted with stepdance == Sean-n\u00f3s dancing is similar to the more formal, competition oriented stepdance, but is more freeform in its expression. Stepdancing is recognisable by its stylised dance clothing, high kicks, and arms kept rigidly to the side. In comparison, the sean-n\u00f3s dancers generally wear street clothing and their arms usually move with the natural rhythm of the dance or are kept loosely at their side. Some dancers incorporate large arm movements in their dance. Personal style is highly valued in sean-n\u00f3s dancing. Competition oriented stepdancing can be danced with a soft or a hard shoe, depending on the type of dance. Sean-n\u00f3s dancing is done with any available street shoe that is to the liking of the individual dancer. The sound of a sean-n\u00f3s dancer's footwork has a rhythmic quality. Many dancers prefer a shoe that is capable of percussive sound. Traditional sean- n\u00f3s dance surfaces include a standard wooden dance floor, a door that has been taken off the hinges, a table, a barrel, or even the top of a stool. In those cases, the skill of the dancer is shown by how well s/he can produce the various steps within the narrow bounds of the dance surface. > The good dancer danced, as it were underneath himself, trapping each note of > music on the floor, and the use of the half-door and table for solo > performances indicates the limited area in which he was expected to perform. > \u2013 Folk Music & Dances of Ireland, Brendan BreathnachFolk Music & Dances of > Ireland, Brendan Breathnach > They used to say, 'A good dancer could dance on a silver tray, and a really > excellent dancer could dance on a sixpence.'

CelticCafe.com == Varying styles == The roots of this form of dancing pre-date modern records. Differences in style exist in different regions of Ireland. Prior to modern communication every region had its own style which was influenced over time. Notable events in Irish history can be seen through the dance, like the steps of Ulster influenced by Scottish dancing and the low steps of the west coast influenced by the Spanish flamenco.

The popularization of old style dancing through competitions, stage shows and copycat teaching/learning methods has created \"standard\" old style steps, counter to the ideology of an improvisational, personal form of Irish dancing. Standard steps can be seen multiple times in any competition and standard tunes have emerged also, such as McCleod's reel and New Mown Meadows. Tap dancing shoes have been adopted by many prominent dancers, changing not only the sound, but also the style of the dancing. Old style dancing may be subdivided further; * Improvisational dancing \u2013 completely improvisational, using known movements but no predefined step sequences. * Improvisational step dancing \u2013 a mix of improvisation and use of personal steps in an order decided on the spot. * Step dancing \u2013 fully choreographed dance. With the increasing popularity of competitions in old style dancing and the desire for a polished performance, many dancers opt for fully choreographed dances. == In the Irish diaspora == As the Irish peoples emigrated, they took sean-n\u00f3s dance with them. This form of dance has influenced various other forms of traditional solo dance extant around the world, e.g. Tap Dance or American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing. Sean-n\u00f3s dance in America may differ from how it is practiced in Ireland, because it in turn has been influenced by other cultures' dance styles there. Sean-n\u00f3s dancing in America and Canada is most commonly seen at folk festivals and informal Irish music sessions, possibly mixed in with casual Irish Stepdancing and other regional styles. However, some dance workshops in America are beginning to introduce the style more widely. == Minimalist preservation == The practice of sean-n\u00f3s dance and song, lilting (\"mouth music\"), and playing \"the bones\" (a simple percussion instrument convenient to carry in a pocket) represented a minimalist means of preserving musical and dance heritage; one which anyone could take part in with a minimum of experience and expenditure but which had the possibility for developing considerable levels of skill with further practice.Irish Step Dancing \u2013 A Brief History, Don Haurin & Ann Richens == Sean N\u00f3s flash mob == On Saturday 5 October 2013 a group of up to fifty sean n\u00f3s dancers took over Shop street, Galway in the form of a sean n\u00f3s flash mob. As many as fifty dancers, in a wide range of age groups, wowed the gathering crowd with their display. The flash mob was organised by the yearly festival known as Oireachtas na Samhna. The idea was to promote the 116th Oireachtas Festival. With music by Johnny \u00d3g Connolly Connemara, the first step was performed by R\u00f3is\u00edn Seoighe Connemara in her trademark red shoes before she was joined by up to 60 dancers at the pedestrian crossroads, aged between 5 and 80. The dancing lasted about eight minutes before the group dispersed as quickly as they had begun. == See also == *Sean-n\u00f3s dance in United States *Irish dance *Solo dance *American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing *Step dance *Stepping (African-American) == References == == External links == * \u2013 Sean n\u00f3s flash Mob * Com\u00f3rtas Damhsa Ch\u00f3il\u00edn She\u00e1in Dharach\u2013 A dance competition and workshop held annually in Ros Muc, Conamara. * Sean-n\u00f3s Northwest \u2013 An American festival celebrating sean-n\u00f3s dancing and sean-n\u00f3s singing. * RTE Radio Documentary: Heel Up \u2013 Damhsa ar an sean-n\u00f3s * Video: Johnny Connolly \u2013 A documentary about Johnny Connolly featuring sean-n\u00f3s dancing. * dance notes Category:Irish dances Category:Uses of shoes ",
