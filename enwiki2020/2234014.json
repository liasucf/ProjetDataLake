    "text": "\"Bringing in the Sheaves\" is a popular American Gospel song used almost exclusively by Protestant Christians (though the content is not specifically Protestant in nature). The lyrics were written in 1874 by Knowles Shaw, who was inspired by Psalm 126:6, \"He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\" Shaw also wrote music for these words, but they are now usually set to a tune by George Minor, written in 1880. ==Lyrics== Knowles Shaw :Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness, :Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve; :Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping, :We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves. :Refrain: :Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves, :We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves, :Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves, :We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves. :Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows, :Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze; :By and by the harvest, and the labor ended, :We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves. :Refrain :Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master, :Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves; :When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome, :We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves. :Refrain ==In popular culture== Charles Ives used fragments of this and other 19th century American secular and spiritual songs in his 2nd Symphony, often to intentionally raucous and discordant effect. This hymn was sung in several episodes of the TV show Little House on the Prairie.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0633054/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd The hymn was sung in an episode of the 1960's Sally Field sitcom The Flying Nun.
