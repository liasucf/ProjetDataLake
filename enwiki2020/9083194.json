    "text": "The Quara\u00ed or Cuareim River (Portuguese Rio Quara\u00ed, Spanish R\u00edo Cuareim) is a tributary of the Uruguay River. ==Location== The river originates in the Coxilha de Santana (Spanish Cuchilla de Santa Ana), an area of low-lying hills, and runs westward to join the Uruguay River. It forms the boundary between Uruguay on the south and Rio Grande do Sul state of Brazil on the north. ==Border dispute== There is a long-standing and unresolved border dispute between Uruguay and Brazil along part of Quara\u00ed River. However, this is not seen as a politically disturbing issue between the two countries, which have close and friendly diplomatic relations and strong economic ties. So far, the disputed areas have been effectively under Brazilian control. ==See also== * List of rivers of Uruguay * List of rivers of Rio Grande do Sul *Brazilian Island * Masoller#Uruguayan-Brazilian border dispute * Geography of Uruguay#Topography and hydrography * 1851 Boundary Treaty (Brazil\u2013Uruguay) ==References== Category:Rivers of Rio Grande do Sul Category:Rivers of Uruguay Category:Brazil\u2013Uruguay border Category:Territorial disputes of Brazil Category:Territorial disputes of Uruguay Category:International rivers of South America Category:Rivers of Artigas Department ",
