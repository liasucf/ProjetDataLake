Dull, flat colors. Yellow, black AKA gun placed in the center of the photo. Pink flowers surrounding the gun, with black lines representing the stems and outlining the flowers. This oil painting by Daphne Arthur is an auctioned art piece created for Trayron Martin, who was a junior at Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, who was fatally shot when he was visiting his father's fianc\u00e9e and her son at their town home in Sanford, Florida. Arthur created this in response to news of the gun that killed the 17 year old being auctioned off, and planned on using the money for teen services. Daphne and partner, whose name is not explicitly said on the auction page, decided that painting a gun that has not been used to kill an innocent child should be auctioned and sold for a good cause. === Installations and Sculptures === ==== El Juego del Tra Tra (2009) ==== Medium: Wall Piece, 53\"x54.5\"x31\" - canvas, wax, latex, oil, paint, spray paint, wire mesh, fur, plastic, white cloth, nails This art piece by Daphne Arthur stretches from the wall to the floor, there is a person stretching out or climbing out of the wall and reaching for the floor. The piece on the floor does not have a set shape. The overall color palette is overall flat colors and there are many different art mediums put together. Daphne Arthur uses ideas of the human form's futility, impermanence, and ethereality as the embodiment of this art piece. According to the gallery of Young Latina Artists Exhibition, this art piece is meant to be \"about life and its incapacity to exist without the consequence or existent of death and decay.\" === Smoke Drawings === ==== Catching Butterflies (2017) ==== Medium: Painting, 51.75\"x42\" - smoke and pastel on paper This smoke drawing by Daphne Arthur illuminates a feeling of apocalyptic desolation through this piece, as the scene depicted includes blurred image of the tree stretching from the outside inside the building and the broken glass on the window. The blur of the smoke creates a haunting and abandoned feeling. == Exhibitions == === One Person Exhibitions === * 2015 - Broken Walls, Harbor Gallery, University of Massachusetts Boston, MD * 2014 - Pancorum Hominum, Rare Gallery, NY * 2012 - Poetics of Reverie, Rare Gallery, NY * 2010 - Beyond Boundaries, Rare Gallery, NY === Selected Group Exhibitions === * 2018 - GLOBAL RADICAL RELEVANCES CONFERENCE, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland *2017 - BODIES Up For Grabs, Judson Memorial, NY I Remember, Curtiss Jacobs, NY * 2016 - Views from There, Honfleur Gallery, Washington, DC Mixed Bag: An International Small Works Exhibition Contemporary Art, 59 Rivoli Gallery, Paris, France * 2014 -Young Latina Artists 19: Y, Qu\u00e9?, Mexic-Arte Museum in Austin, TX * 2013 - Land of Tomorrow, Louisville, KY Edge Art: Black-Latino(a) Artists, An Inter-Caribbean Dialogue, City College of New York, NY * 2012 ** Even Gravity Has Its Ups and Downs, Arena1, Santa Monica, CA ** Go Tell It on the Mountain, California African American Museum, Los Angeles, CA ** Caribe Now, Caribbean: Crossroads of the World, Nathan Cummings Foundation New York, NY African-American Fine Art, Swann Galleries, New York, New York * 2011 ** Florence Biennale VIII, Florence, Italy ** A Postcard Exhibition, Rush Arts Gallery, New York, NY ** Dialogo 365, Crane Arts, Philadelphia, PA ** Synesthesia LAB, Crane Arts, Philadelphia, PA * 2009 - OutsideIn, Laviolabank - Gallery, NY * 2007 - \u201cWill Happiness Find Me?\u201d, Marvelli Gallery, NY * 2008 - Generations, South Side Art Center, Chicago, IL * 2005 **Tradition/ Tradici\u00f3n, Gallery X, Chicago, IL ** Some of Our Own, Cleary & Gottlieb, New York, NY **William and Florence Schmidt Art Center at Southwestern Illinois College, Belleville, IL == Honors and Awards == * 2009 - Al Held Affiliate Fellowship * 2007 - Lalla Anne Critz Zanzi Scholarship, School of Art, Institute of Chicago * 2005 - Federation of Independent Illinois Colleges and Universities Award == Publications == === Illustrator === In the year of 2017, Daphne Arthur illustrated the graphic novel and designed the set in The Bench, A Homeless Love Story.
