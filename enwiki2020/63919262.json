Ohio voters elected state senators in the 17 odd-numbered Ohio Senate districts. State senators elected in 2018 are eligible to serve a four-year term beginning January 2019 and ending December 2022. These elections coincided with elections for Ohio Governor, the Ohio House, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and other statewide offices. Despite a moderate statewide swing that allowed the Democrats to win the popular vote, the Republicans retained their supermajority of 24 seats in the Senate, compared to the Democrats' 9 seats. == Statewide results == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right;\" ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party ! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidates ! colspan=\"3\" |Votes ! colspan=\"3\" |Seats Won |- !No. !% !+/\u2013 !No. !+/\u2013 !% |- | style=\"background:;\" | | align=\"left\" |Republican Party |17 |1,032,867 |47.26 | style=\"color:red;\" |7.17 |10 |0 |58.82 |- | style=\"background:;\" | | align=\"left\" |Democratic Party |17 |1,145,439 |52.41 | style=\"color:green;\" |6.84 |7 |0 |41.18 |- | style=\"background:;\" | | align=\"left\" |Libertarian Party |1 |4,037 |0.18 | style=\"color:green;\" |0.18 |0 |0 |0.00 |- | style=\"background:;\" | | align=\"left\" |Green Party |1 |3,041 |0.14 | style=\"color:green;\" |0.14 |0 |0 |0.00 |- style=\"font-weight:bold\" | colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" |Total |36 | |100.00 | |17 | |100.00 |} == Results by district == === Overview === |} === Detailed results === {| class=\"toc\" summary=\"Contents\" id=\"toc\" | align=\"center\" |District 1 \u2022 District 3 \u2022 District 5 \u2022 District 7 \u2022 District 9 \u2022 District 11 \u2022 District 13 \u2022 District 15 \u2022 District 17 \u2022 District 19 \u2022 District 21 \u2022 District 23 \u2022 District 25 \u2022 District 27 \u2022 District 29 \u2022 District 31 \u2022 District 33 __NOTOC__ |} ==== District 1 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 3 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 5 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 7 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 9 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 11 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 13 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 15 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 17 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 19 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 21 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 23 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 25 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 27 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 29 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 31 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== ==== District 33 ==== ===== Primary results ===== ===== General election results ===== == Notes == == References == Ohio Senate Category:2018 Ohio elections ",
