Many of the mills of the area were formerly blade mills used for sharpening them, after a scythesmith had forged them from iron, with a thin strip of steel along the cutting edge. From the late 18th century until about 1870, the Waldron family of Field House Clent were the leading manufacturers. They were succeeded by Isaac Nash, whose business finally closed in about 1970. Scythes were formerly not just made in Belbroughton, but also several adjacent parishes, including Chaddesley Corbett. At the crossroads in the nearby hamlet of Bell Heath, there is a boulder that was brought by glacial process from Arenig Fawr in Snowdonia in Merionethshire. A plaque reads \"Boulder from Arenig Mountain in N. Wales, Brought here by the Welsh Ice-Sheet in the Glacial Period\".belbroughtonandfairfield-pc.info ==Facilities== Facilities in the village include a village shop, \"Dillons ... Newsagents ...

The rising water was held back by a seven-foot wall but the pressure of the water caused it to break. The surge of water tore through the village sweeping away cars and causing severe water damage (and in some cases structural damage) to many properties.\"while in Belbroughton, near Stourbridge, a water-logged cottage collapsed\" The current was so strong, it made tarmac ripple. ==References== ==External links== *Belbroughton Net (This site utilises Flash 8 Player) * Belbroughton scarecrows come out to play BBC 25 September 2003 Category:Villages in Worcestershire ",
