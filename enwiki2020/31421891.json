Scanlan in 1970 and sold in the form of plans for amateur construction.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 18. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 ==Design and development== The SG-1 was conceived as a very simple and economical aircraft that could be built with modest construction skills and very little financial investment. The prototype was completed in 1970 for US$400 and subsequent aircraft were built for under US$1000. The SG-1 is constructed with a welded steel fuselage and tail surfaces and covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wing is made from an aluminium structure, covered in aluminum sheet and features upper-surface spoilers and a modified G\u00f6 549 airfoil. The landing gear is a monowheel with the forward fuselage protected by a skid. The airframe was static tested to 9g without failing. With a very low stall speed of , pilots who have flown the aircraft claim that the SG-1 can fly a thermal inside a Schweizer SGS 1-26. ==Operational history== In April 2011 there was one SG-1 and one SG-1A on the Federal Aviation Administration registry. ==Variants== ;SG-1 :Prototype design, with V-struts and a constant-chord wing. One built. ;SG-1A : Improved model, with double- tapered wings and single wing struts. About four built. ==Aircraft on display== *US Southwest Soaring Museum ==Specifications (SG-1A) == ==See also== ==References== Category:1970s United States sailplanes Category:Homebuilt aircraft ",
