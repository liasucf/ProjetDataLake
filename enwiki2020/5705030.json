Kingsessing: Swedish Settlement to Urban Blight (University Archives and Records Center. University of Pennsylvania. 10 October 2005) http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/upwphil/day_kingsessing.pdf The township of Kingsessing was created not long after control of the colony was transferred to William Penn. The township and village were incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the Act of Consolidation, 1854. For the 18th and most of the 19th centuries Kingessing was a rural township with farms, orchards and market gardens. A major botanic and horticultural garden, Bartram's Garden was located in Kingessing Township, and was frequently called the \"Kingsess Garden.\" By the middle of the 19th century, Kingessing was a major center for the nursery and florist gardens in Philadelphia County. The name Kingsessing or Chinsessing comes from the Lenape word for \"a place where there is a meadow\". The origins of Kingsessing are found in the village of the same name that roughly occupied the same site as the current neighborhood. Kingsessing became the name of the township in which the original Lenape and Swedish village stood. ==Population== More than 80,000 people live in Southwest Philadelphia. It is approximately 60% black, 36% white, and 4% Asian.Neighborhoods of Philadelphia Until the late 1960s, Southwest Philadelphia was considered an Irish-American neighborhood until Vietnamese refugees settled in the area along with African-Americans from nearby West Philadelphia.
