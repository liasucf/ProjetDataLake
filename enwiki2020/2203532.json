    "text": "This page contains a timeline of significant events regarding same-sex marriage and legal recognition of same-sex couples worldwide. It begins with the history of same-sex unions during ancient times, which consisted of unions ranging from informal and temporary relationships to highly ritualized unions, and continues to modern-day state-recognized same-sex marriage. Events concerning same-sex marriages becoming legal in a country or in a country's state are listed in bold. ==Ancient times (10000 BC \u2013 100)== Various types of same-sex marriages have existed, ranging from informal, unsanctioned relationships to highly ritualized unions. Cicero mentions the marriage (using the Latin verb for \"to marry\", i.e. nubere) of the son of Curio the Elder, but he does it in a metaphorical form to criticize his enemy Antonius. Cicero states thus that the younger Curio was \"united in a stable and permanent marriage\" to Antonius.Cicero Philippic 18 February, 2.45 See old translation at: http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi- bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0021&layout;=&loc;=18 February, 2.45 Martial also mentions a number of same-sex marriages, but always in derisory terms against people whom he wants to mock.Martial 12.42, 1.35, 3.93, 12.95.

(1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. pp. 35\u201336. The first Roman emperor to have married a man was Nero, who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions. First with one of his freedmen, Pythagoras, to whom Nero took the role of the bride, and later as a groom Nero married a young boy, who resembled one of his concubines,Nero missed her so greatly after her death that on learning of a woman who resembled her he at first sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus,...\"he formally \"married\" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;\" q.v., Suetonius Nero 28; Dio Cassius Epitome 62.28 Old Translation of passage at: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html named Sporus. Adolescent emperor Elagabalus referred to his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles, as his husband.Cassius Dio, Roman History LXXIX.30 He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens.Dio Cassius Epitome 80.5, 80.14, 80.15, 80.16; Herodian Roman History 5.6.1\u20135.6.2 Old Translation of passage at: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/herodian_05_book5.htm These same-sex marriages continued until Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. A law in the Theodosian Code (C. Th. 9.7.3) was issued in 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans. This law prohibited same-sex marriage in ancient Rome and ordered that those who were so married were to be executed. In the Middle Ages, a same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro D\u00edaz and Mu\u00f1o Vandilaz in the Galician municipality of Rairiz de Veiga in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova. The Siwa Oasis in Egypt had an historical acceptance of male homosexuality and even rituals of same-sex marriage\u2014traditions that Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century. The German egyptologist George Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that homosexual relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage. ==1970s== ===1970=== James Michael McConnell, librarian,The Board of Regents revoked an offer mailed by the University Librarian to McConnell. * 1967: McConnell insisted, on Baker's 25th Birthday, that he would accept Baker's offer if, and only if, the relationship would eventually be recognized as a \"legal\" marriage. * 1970: The Board accepted the recommendation of its Executive Committee \"That the appointment of Mr. J.
