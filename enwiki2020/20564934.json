It was certified Gold by the RIAA and sold 600,000 copies domestically. Internationally, \"I Wish\" reached number 15 in the UK, and number 4 in Sweden and Norway. Most of the song's instruments are sampled from \"Spinnin'\" by Bernard Wright, and the song features a vocal sample of people shouting from the track \"Buffalo Gals\" by Malcolm McLaren. The song was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards but lost to \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by Coolio. Blender listed \"I Wish\" as number 359 on its list of \"Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". The music video, directed by Marty Thomas, was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards including \"Best New Artist Music Video\" and \"Maximum Vision Clip of the Year\".Billboard Music Video Awards Nominations Confirmation - Billboard Magazine November 4, 1995 page 20 ==Overview== The song's lyrics are self-deprecating, with Skee-Lo lamenting a variety of personal shortcomings that he says are to blame for his unsuccessful love life. He wishes he were of taller stature (\"like 6'9\") and a basketball player (\"a baller\"). He wishes for a better car, specifically a '64 Impala, instead of his 1974 Ford Pinto with \"an 8-Track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat!\" The lyrics also mention the Los Angeles neighborhood of Crenshaw, and a signpost featuring the street name appears in the background of the music video. Additionally, the song references Buffalo Springfield's \"For What It's Worth\" in the lyrics \"Hey, you, what's that sound?/ Everybody look what's going down\". ==Critical reception== Manila Standard called the song \"a true rarity \u2014 a rap song that dares to express vulnerable sentiments while retaining a funky edge.\" Will Ashon from Muzik described it as \"a ludicrous, dayglo, superfly wish-list from the self- depreciating and immediately likeable Skee-Lo.\" James Hunter from Vibe wrote in his review, \"Dreaming of girls, cars, and height, his \"I Wish\" is a most excellent pop-rap hit. Prom-night celebrity, that's his aspiration, and nobody's articulated it better in years. Skee-Lo wins because he doesn't try to sound like anything he's not.\" ==In other media== *The Secret Handshake did a cover of this song on Punk Goes Crunk. *In As Heard on Radio Soulwax, Pt. 2, 2manydjs superimposed the vocals of \"I Wish\" over Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\", then The Breeders' \"Cannonball\" . *Far East Movement did a cover of this song for the 2008 film Ping Pong Playa. *\"I Wish\" is also featured as one of the lyrical tracks from Girl Talk's album All Day, on the track \"Jump on Stage\". *Rapper MC Lars parodied the chorus of this song on his 2007 track \"White Kids Aren't Hyphy\"https://genius.com/Mc-lars-white-kids-arent-hyphy- lyrics *Skee-Lo appeared with Cher Lloyd on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in November 2013, performing portions of \"I Wish\" along with her single \"I Wish\". *Kevin Hart and Ice Cube released a remix of this song with NBA players Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Andre Iguodala, and Kobe Bryant appearing in the video to advertise Hart and Cube's movie Ride Along.
