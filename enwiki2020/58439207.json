    "text": "Albert Guillon (1801 in Meaux \u2013 April 1854 in Venice) was a French composer. Guillon had lessons at the school of the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris with Pierre Desvignes, before he joined the Conservatoire de Paris to study counterpoint with Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis and musical composition with Henri Montan Berton. At the same time he was double bassist at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. In 1824 he won the premier Second Grand Prix de Rome with the cantata Agn\u00e8s Sorel. After his stay in the Villa Medici in Rome 1826-27 he settled in Venice. There he composed the opera Maria di Brabante, which was performed 1830 at the Teatro La Fenice with great success. Later he gave up his musical career and turned to agriculture and silkworm breeding. At Treviso he built a factory for processing caterpillar cocoons. His innovations found the attention of Italian agricultural societies and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 imp\u00e9riale et centrale d'agriculture. == External links == * Albert Guillion; life and catalogue Category:1801 births Category:1854 deaths Category:People from Meaux Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:French Romantic composers Category:French opera composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:French male composers Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:19th-century male musicians ",
