Nakatsuka is represented with LDH. == Early life == Yuta Nakatsuka was born on January 7, 1993, in Osaka, Japan. Yuta got interested in dancing due to his mother's love for American music, especially Black music. With his mother's influence he grew up listening to artists such as Stevie Wonder, Babyface and Eric Clapton, but no Japanese music at all. She even took him to live shows of Earth Wind & Fire and other artists. At the age of 6, Yuta decided to become a dancer and started attending the dance school \"Dance Studio BOOM\" in Ibaraki, Osaka, which was recommended by his parents. There, he met his first dance teachers, the choreographer duo Hilty & Bosch. They taught an acrobatics class and also inspired Yuta to start Locking. Despite being the youngest in their class, Yuta stood out as one of the best students. At the same dance school, Yuta also took classes of other instructors such as Boo (the owner of the dance school), Cherry from Wild Cherry, Rei (the father of You from Hilty & Bosch), Yuki (boss of Osaka dancer) and Skeeter Rabbit (member of The Electric Boogaloos) because he was interested to try out all kinds of dance styles. When he was 16, Yuta started attending EXPG Osaka, LDH's talent school, after he was scouted by the company during a dance event from Dance Studio BOOM. He was chosen to become an instructor there in the same year due to the high level of his skills. His most notable former student at EXPG Osaka is Twice's Sana. When Yuta was 18 years old, he moved to Tokyo. At that time, he had troubles deciding what his future as a dancer should look like. While he was part of the Popping crew Yuki Dojo from his former dancing instructor Yuki at Dance Studio BOOM, they won 2nd place at the JAPAN DANCE DELIGHT vol.18 dance tournament. This experience had a major impact on Yuta's life since he was selected as a support member for Generations in 2011. Yuki then sent him off with the best wishes to find his path for the future and the promise that he can return to Yuki's crew any time, which motivated Yuta to do his best in his career as an artist. == Career == In 2012, and just before the group's major debut, he became an official member after Keita Machida's withdrawal. In March 2014, he participated in Exile Performer Battle Audition and made it to the finals but wasn't selected to join EXILE. In October 2019, he made his acting debut in the movie \"High & Low The Worst\". == Works == === Choreography === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Group !Notes |- |2013 |Love You More | rowspan=\"5\" |Generations from Exile Tribe | |- |2014 |Never Let You Go | rowspan=\"3\" |Alongside Reo Sano |- |2015 |All for You |- |2016 |Rainy Room |- |2017 |Big City Rodeo |Peek-a-boo dance (inai inai ba dance) |- |2019 |Supersonic |Generations vs Fantastics |MV version; alongside Sekai |} == Filmography == === Movies === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Role !Ref. |- |2019 |High & Low The Worst |Shinya Orochi | |} === TV Dramas === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Network !Notes |- |2016 |Night Hero Naoto |TV Tokyo |Ending Dance |} === TV Shows === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Network |- |2016-2017 |Dancer's Pride |Abema TV |} === Live === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Artist !Title !Notes |- |2008 | rowspan=\"2\" |EXILE |EXILE LIVE DOME TOUR 2008 Osaka performance | rowspan=\"5\" |As a dancer |- |2009 |EXILE LIVE TOUR 2009 MONSTER |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2010 |Doberman Inc. |DOBERMAN INC.
