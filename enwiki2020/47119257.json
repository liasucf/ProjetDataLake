    "text": "tinyBuild LLC is an American video game publisher and developer. Based in Bellevue, Washington, with development offices in Utrecht, Netherlands, Boise, Idaho, and Riga, Latvia, the company was founded by Alex Nichiporchik, Luke Burtis and Tom Brien. Having found success with digital games No Time to Explain and SpeedRunners, the latter of which was developed by DoubleDutch Games, the company has moved into video game publishing, and has helped third- party studios release titles across PC, mobile and video game consoles. Following the success of No Time to Explain, the company began working with DoubleDutch Games on SpeedRunners. This co-development experiment proved fruitful, and since March 2015, SpeedRunners has sold over 600,000 copies. As a result, tinyBuild made the decision to begin publishing titles from third- party developers, starting with Not the Robots in 2013. tinyBuild has continued to work with third-party studios and has published titles across Steam, iOS, Android and various video game consoles. tinyBuild has also worked with student teams to help bring their first games to market. tinyBuild acquired the development team behind Hello Neighbor from Dynamic Pixels in July 2020 for an undisclosed sum to establish a new studio Eerie Guest Studios based in Hilversum, Netherlands, as well as investment more than into the Hello Neighbor franchise. == Games developed == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
