    "text": "Uke-Hunt is a ukulele-based cover band fronted by Spike Slawson from Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Although both this and the Gimmes are cover bands, they have very different approaches. While the Gimmes generally pick non-rock songs and rock them out and speed them up to turn them into punk music, while in this band, the songs picked are generally upbeat songs that are then slowed down and mellowed out. ==History== The band's origins start with Slawson learning to play ukulele when Me First and the Gimme Gimmes would perform their cover of R. Kelly's \"I Believe I Can Fly\" live. Slawson would then learn different songs on ukulele which led to this band. The band initially played on the San Francisco Wharf under the name Uke Hammer. The band was initially made up of Slawson on ukulele and vocals, Randy Burk on percussion and vocals and Jamin Barton on various instruments, including saxophone, melodica and harmonica. The band first appeared on the 2013 Fat Music for Fest People III compilation before releasing their debut single, \"The Prettiest Star\", in April 2014, followed by their debut, self-titled album in June 2014. The following year, the band went on their first national tour. ==Members== *Spike Slawson \u2013 lead vocals *Jamin Barton - saw, saxophone *Randy Burk - percussion *Joe Raposo - bass ==Discography== ===\"The Prettiest Star\" 7\" (2014)=== \"The Prettiest Star\" was the first release by the band.
