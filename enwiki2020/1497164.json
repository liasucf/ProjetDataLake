The suburb was bypassed by traffic from Melbourne coming from the Princes Freeway by the creation of the Geelong Ring Road, which was complete in 2009. At the , Geelong North had a population of 2,966. It is often referred to as North Geelong The head office of Australian department store, Target, founded in Geelong in 1925 is located on Thompson Road, next door to the former Geelong Golf Club. Target no longer there. The suburb has an Australian rules football team competing in the Geelong & District Football League and a Croatian association football team North Geelong Warriors FC that are currently competing in the National Premier Leagues Victoria ==History== From 1858 to 1971 a gasworks was operated by the Geelong Gas Company on a site on Victoria and Douro Streets with a connecting rail to the Geelong Ports. The current Post Office opened in 1987. An earlier office dating from 1886 was replaced by Rippleside in 1986. Osborne House was built on the shores of Corio Bay in 1858 as a private residence, later being used by the Royal Australian Navy, local council officers, and is currently the home of the Geelong Maritime Museum. In the 1950s through to the early 1970s the suburb saw a drastic increase in housing construction, in part fuelled by Geelong's growing industries and manufacturing sector. In 1973, the Victoria Street level crossing adjacent to the southern end of the station was replaced by a road overpass, known as the Margaret Street overpass, and a pedestrian underpass. In 1976, both platforms were extended by over 60 metres. The main station building on Platform 1 was replaced on 8 August 1990, and in 2008 the smaller building on Platform 2 was replaced by a metal shelter. In 1998 hotel owner Paul Ramia erected a 15m-high polystyrene replica of the Great Sphinx of Giza atop his hotel, known as the Sphinx Hotel. In Fyansford Cement Works Railway, originally opened in 1918, was removed in the early 2000s after the cement works closure in 2000.

Prior to its removal, a bike and pedestrian path, known as Linear Park, was constructed in the 1980s alongside the rail line. In 2012, a part of North Geelong was redistributed. This included businesses and houses on the eastern side of Melbourne Road and around St. Helens Park, between Victoria Street to Swinburne Street. Initially residents hoped to become their own suburb called 'St. Helens', though the name was unavailable and instead joined neighbouring Rippleside.

Their new facility is currently being constructed at Williams Landing opposite the rail station of the same name in Melbourne's west. ==Geelong Arena== The Geelong Arena includes an indoor pool, basketball court capable of hosting 2000 people.

In late 2013 construction of the Geelong Golf Club Residential Estate began on the golf club site, with plans for 350 new homes, parks and 9-hole golf course included as a part of the redevelopment. ==Geelong Saleyards== The early Geelong Town Corporation bought land for the saleyards in 1867 and opened the facility in 1869.
