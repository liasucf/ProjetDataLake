It opened in 1989 to replace the older Norristown High Speed Line (Route 100) terminus one block away at Main and Swede Streets, and integrated the former Reading Company DeKalb Street Norristown railroad station (built 1933) into its structure. A plaque embedded in the sidewalk (between the bus lane and Lafayette Streets) commemorates the location of one of the columns of the dismantled segment of the Philadelphia and Western Railroad (P&W;) trestle. ==Regional rail service== thumb The Norristown Transportation Center is a stop on the Manayunk/Norristown Regional Rail Line which offers service to Center City Philadelphia via Conshohocken and Manayunk. In FY 2013, the regional rail service at Norristown Transportation Center had a weekday average of 848 boardings and 799 alightings. ==Norristown High Speed Line== thumb Norristown Transportation Center is the final stop on the Norristown High Speed Line which runs from 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby to Norristown. ==Bus routes== In addition to rail service, NTC serves as the center of the Frontier District of SEPTA's Suburban Division bus routes, particularly the routes operating in Montgomery County. Bus routes serving NTC operate with a \"timed transfer\"; for the most part, buses leave at the same time, to maximize possible transfers between routes. These routes serve areas of Norristown and other areas in Montgomery County. SEPTA Frontier District routes that serve Norristown Transportation Center are: * - to Plymouth Meeting Mall via Penn Square * - to Graterford State Prison via Eagleville (Saturdays only) * - to Charles W. Dickinson Transportation Center in Pottstown via Collegeville and Philadelphia Premium Outlets * - to Lansdale via Montgomery Mall and North Wales * - to Chestnut Hill via Barren Hill and Conshohocken * - to Plymouth Meeting Mall via Blue Bell * - to Phoenixville via King of Prussia Transit Center at King of Prussia mall, Audubon and Oaks * - to Audubon and Valley Forge Corporate Complex via Jeffersonville Norristown Transportation Center is served by theconnector shuttle bus operated by the King of Prussia District, which connects Manayunk/Norristown Line trains at the station to the business parks in King of Prussia during peak weekday hours. Old Norristown station configuration. The Lehigh Valley Transit Company's Liberty Bell High Speed Line was a continuation of the existing Norristown High Speed Line along Swede Road and then E. Airy Street before turning onto Markley Street where it meets up with the existing Manayunk/Norristown Line. The current Manayunk/Norristown Line continued to Valley Forge instead of going to Main Street along Lafayette Street. NTC is located at DeKalb & Lafayette Streets near the banks of the Schuylkill River and boasts a parking garage (built in 2008). Along with the opening of the new garage, intercity bus service by Bieber Transportation Group, Greyhound, and Martz Trailways was introduced to Norristown.Thanks to Bieber, buses rolling again in NorristownNew Norristown Transportation Center Bus Terminal Open For Business Bieber Transportation Group ended service to Norristown on April 1, 2018 while Martz Trailways service ended May 31, 2018. Additionally, Norristown Transportation Center was formerly an important transfer point between electric and Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDCs) service to points north, such as Valley Forge, Phoenixville, Pottstown, Reading and Pottsville. RDC service was eliminated in 1981 due to budget cuts. Proposals for service restoration to Reading, dubbed the Schuylkill Valley Metro, have been floated around since the late 1990s, but nothing has gone past the discussion phase. ==Station layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |- |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray\" rowspan=4 width=75|High Speed Line platforms |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Inbound |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| toward 69th Street (Bridgeport) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- top:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the left or right |- |Inbound | toward 69th Street (Bridgeport) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=5 width=50|Regional Rail platforms |style=\"border-bottom:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |- |Inbound |\u2190 toward 30th Street or Penn Medicine (Conshohocken) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Outbound |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| toward Elm Street \u2013 Norristown (Main Street \u2013 Norristown) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |} ==References== == External links == *SEPTA - Norristown Transportation Center **Regional Rail **Route 100 (NHSL) **NTC Map * Norristown Transportation Center (The Subway Nut) * DeKalb Street entrance from Google Maps Street View Category:SEPTA Regional Rail stations Category:SEPTA Norristown High Speed Line stations Category:SEPTA stations and terminals Transport Center Category:Former Reading Company stations Category:Railway stations in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
