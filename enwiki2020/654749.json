As a child, his family moved to Freeport (now Conesus), Livingston County, New York, where his parents operated an inn. He had only basic schooling but by self-study acquired an education in the classics which enabled him to qualify as a schoolteacher, after which he taught in Livonia, New York. He later studied law with Augustus A. Bennett of East Avon, New York, and Anbrose Bennett of Geneseo, New York. Young was admitted to the bar in 1829, and began a practice in Geneseo. Among the prospective attorneys who later studied under Young was his brother in law James Wood, and Young and Wood later formed a partnership. ==Start of career== He entered politics as a Jacksonian Democrat, but shortly afterward joined the Anti-Masonic Party. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1832. Young was elected as a Whig to the 24th United States Congress, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Philo C. Fuller, holding office from November 1836 to March 3, 1837. In 1840 he was elected to the 27th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843. He was again a member of the Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1845 and 1846. ==Governor of New York== In 1846 Young was the Whig nominee for governor. He defeated incumbent Silas Wright and served one term, January 1847 to December 1848.

He also pardoned farmers who had been imprisoned for participating in the Anti-Rent War. In 1848 Young was defeated for the Whig nomination for governor by Hamilton Fish, who went on to win the general election. ==Later career== In 1848 Young was a delegate to the 1848 national convention.
