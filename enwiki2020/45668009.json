The father of India's capital markets took Nathwani under his wings at a time when Reliance was planning the world's the largest single location greenfield refinery at Moti Khavdi near Jamnagar. Nathwani helped in realizing Dhirubhai's dream, literally. He played a pivotal role in removing hurdles in land acquisition and facilitated setting up of the refinery.

But, Nathwani worked round the clock in rural areas of Jamnagar, dealing with farmers, developing personal rapport with each of them to help Reliance acquire 10,000 acres land. The most important thing was that the land was acquired with consent of all the farmers. Having tested his potential in Jamnagar, Reliance bosses relocated Nathwani at Ahmedabad and entrusted bigger responsibilities and assignment to operate on a bigger canvas in 1997.
