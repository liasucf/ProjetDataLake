    "text": "Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) was a German satellite launched July 15, 2000 from Plesetsk, Russia and was used for atmospheric and ionospheric research, as well as other geoscientific applications, such as GPS radio occultation. CHAMP was managed by GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam (GFZ). The spacecraft is the first application of Astrium's \"Flexbus\" platform; GRACE was the second. A heavily modified version flew as the GOCE mission. CHAMP completed its mission and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 19 September 2010 after 10 years (design life: five years). The mission was judged as being successful by the involved scientists. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *NASA website Category:Spacecraft launched in 2000 Category:Satellites of Germany Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2010 Category:Geodetic satellites ",
