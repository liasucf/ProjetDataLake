    "text": "The Seasons\u2019 Difference is the second novel of American author and theologian, Frederick Buechner. It was published in 1952 by Alfred A. Knopf. == Plot == The rarefied, bucolic lives of Sam and Sarah Dunn are disturbed by the uncanny pronouncements of their cousin, Peter Cowley. Sara, a sophisticated sculptress, and the languorous Samuel, whose wealth and lifestyle have driven him to a state of perpetual ennui, are caught off-guard by their young relative's report of an ecstatic, mystical vision. Cowley, who has been invited to run a small vacation school for children in the spacious grounds of their substantial summer home, claims to have experienced the vision on a hillside nearby. His pronouncement is the cause of much discussion and consternation among the adults present: Julie McMoon, a neighbour of the Dunns who is grieving the recent suicide of her husband, and whose children are attending the summer school; the cynical pianist, Richard Lundrigan, who will spend much of the novel attempting to convince Cowley that his vision was a fantasy; and Thomas Lavender, a highly enthusiastic, if not slightly crazed, minister, who has joined the vacation in his capacity as Cowley's spiritual director, and is convinced of the veracity of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's mystical experience. Also party to Cowley's mysterious claims are his students, Ellie Sonntag, Daisy and Timmy McMoon, George Bundle, Fendall Dunn, Rufus Este, and Harry Fogg. The two oldest of the children, Harry and Rufus, separate themselves from both the adults and their classmates by designating themselves as \u2018the Uglies\u2019, a nickname representative of their adolescent sense of discomfort and lack of belonging. This angst is further expressed through their close observation and discussion of those around them, their overt demonstrations of their own intelligence in Cowley's classroom, and their composition of poetry. When Cowley takes the children to a local carnival and they pile into a tent to watch a \u2018freak show\u2019 the Uglies laugh at, but also feel a deep sense of kinship with, the performers. The excursion ends awkwardly when a dwarf interrupts the performance to challenge the attitude of one of the children, who immediately begins to cry. Convinced of the significance of his vision, both for himself and for the rest of the adults at the house, Cowley encourages them to return with him to the hillside in the hope that the phenomena will repeat itself. Upon arriving at the spot, the group are momentarily caught unawares by the appearance of a shimmering angelic assembly. The vision, however, is revealed to be the children, who, on overhearing that the adults intend to seek the miraculous, have decided to play a trick on them, enlisting the help of Sara's model, Mollie Purdue, and dressing themselves in white sheets. Lavender is convinced that the children are endowed with a purity and joy that the adults have foolishly exchanged for a cynical and narrow view of the world. At the close of the novel the ageing minister's desire to partake of that innocence manifests itself in ways both strange and tragic, first in his performance of a bizarre marriage ceremony, wedding the children to one another, and then in his fatal fall from their tree house. == Characters == * Peter Cowley: a relative of the Dunn family, Cowley is a saint-like, though also somewhat comic figure, who shares the innocence of the children he is employed to tutor. Dale Brown comments that Cowley is \u2018vulnerable to life in a fragile, frightening way\u2019, positing him as somewhere between a \u2018saint\u2019 and a \u2018madman\u2019. * Samuel Dunn: Seventeenth and eighteenth-century literature and art are the main pastime for the listless and apathetic Samuel, whose wealth and privilege have rendered him irredeemably passive \u2013 so much so that, at the climax of the novel, he falls asleep. * Sara Dunn: A talented sculptor, Sarah is likewise effected by the ennui brought by wealth and status, though, unlike her husband, she is not reduced to passivity. Rather, she engages passionately both in the discussion around Cowley's vision and in her work. * Julie McMoon: A wealthy neighbour of the Dunn family, Julie is labouring under the grief of her husband's suicide, the effects of which have left such a severe impact that she is often timid and passive throughout. She refuses to join Cowley on the hillside, in his attempt to recreate his vision, for fear both that it might repeat itself and that it might not. * Richard Lundrigan: Cynical, combative, and often sardonic, Lundrigan provides the foil for Cowley, persistently and loudly making his doubts regarding the tutor's vision known. Brown calls him a \u2018representative of realism\u2019, who \u2018lives on within the walls of his own limitations, acting only upon what he can see and touch\u2019. * Thomas Lavender: An ageing, \u2018God-haunted lunatic of a minister\u2019,Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 43. Lavender is the antithesis of Lundrigan. Spiritual adviser to Cowley, Lavender is convinced of the truth of his ward's vision, and of what it demands: a recapturing of the innocence and moral purity of the children. * Rufus Este: red-haired, bespectacled, \u2018short and a little fat\u2019,Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 18. Rufus is a clever fourteen-year-old boy. Both he and Harry like to compose poetry, and their friendship leads them to form an inclusive group, \u2018the Uglies\u2019, through which the two boys can express their adolescent sense of loneliness. Brown suggests that they are \u2018characters in transition\u2019, who \u2018illustrate the gradual loss of spontaneous joyfulness and wondrous expectation.\u2019Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 59. * Harry Fogg: a tall boy with \u2018dark hair and some pimples\u2019,Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 18. is similarly intelligent, and, like Rufus Este, struggling to come to terms with his growing sense of estrangement in the world. Upon seeing Mollie Purdue posing nude for Sara Dunn, Rufus experiences his first ever infatuation, falling painfully and awkwardly in love with her. * The other children: Timmy and Daisy McMoon are the young children of the bereaved Julie McMoon, and they are joined at the summer school by Ellie Sonntag, a conscientious and calm member of the group, often seen with her thick spectacles in hand. George Bundle is the first child we meet in the novel. Often preferring his own company to that of the other children, George listens intently to a conversation between Sara and Samuel Dunn regarding Cowley's vision while fishing in the pond. The only child of Samuel and Sara Dunn, Fendall Dunn is \u2018plump\u2019, \u2018dark\u2019 in complexion,Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 21. and twelve years old. * Mollie Purdue: a beautiful model for Sara's sculpting projects, Mollie journeys to the house from her home in \u2018the city\u2019. In her early twenties, she is endowed with the \u2018certain power of being observed\u2019, and, indeed, it is by observing her that Harry falls helplessly in love with her. == Composition == Following the publication of The Season\u2019s Difference Buechner moved to New York City, there to pursue a career as a full-time writer. The young author began the composition of his second novel, however, while residing in New Jersey, where he had returned to teach English at his alma mater, Lawrenceville School. The majority of the manuscript, however, was composed while Buechner was on leave from Lawrenceville in Europe, \u2018mostly in England\u2019. == Themes == Like Buechner's first novel, A Long Day\u2019s Dying, his second is commonly considered to be broadly modernist in its style. The theme of suicide, present in A Long Day\u2019s Dying, is also in view here through the grief of Julie McMoon. Similar also is the focus of The Seasons\u2019 Difference around the wearied sophistication of the leisure classes \u2013 a common modernist trope. Into this modernism, however, Buechner weaves pastoral themes, included in which is the depiction of nature as a mysterious, liminal space. Death, innocence, and the attempt to recapture youth are also central to the novel, as are the theological questions that would become so vital to Buechner's later work. Indeed, critic Dale Brown writes that the novel posits the question, \u2018what are sophisticated folk to do with this claim of miracle?\u2019Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 47. Brown adds, however, that \u2018the action of this novel as, as it was in A Long Day\u2019s Dying, interior \u2013 inside the minds of the various characters, even the cloudy and tentative minds of the children.\u2019Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 44. == Critical reception == Though often cited as Buechner's least-fated novel, The Seasons' Difference received a significant amount of praise from a variety of literary critics. Following its publication, the novel drew the following comment from Caspar Weinberger (later, in an article written for the San Francisco Chronicle: \u2018It is not too much to say that among America\u2019s current novelists his abilities are the most obvious and his ultimate place is with the best we have produced\u2019.Caspar W. Weinberger, \u2018Reviews of Six Recent Novels\u2019, San Francisco Chronicle, January 13, 1952, 17. quoted in Brown, p.42 A review in Punch, written by Francis Bickley, labelled the work \u2018a brilliant book\u2019,Francis Bickley, \u2018A Second and Two Firsts\u2019, Punch, August 13, 1952, p.241, quoted in Brown p.41. while Tangye Lean wrote in The Spectator that it was \u2018one of the most distinguished novels that has recently come out of America\u2019.Tangye Lean, \u2018Fiction\u2019, Spectator, July 25, 1952, p.142, quoted in Brown p.41 In his review written for the New Statesman, J.D. Scott wrote favourably of Buechner's portrayal of the children in The Seasons\u2019 Difference, concluding that it was \u2018true and touching\u2019.J.D. Scott, \u2018New Novels\u2019, New Statesman and Nation, August 23, 1952, quoted in Brown, p.51. == References == Category:1952 novels Category:Modernist novels ",
