Retchin sentenced Magbie, a first-time offender, to ten days in jail despite the prosecution, as part of a plea bargain with the defense, agreeing not to oppose probation. Magbie, who required a ventilator to breathe at night (something the jail did not have), subsequently died four days into his sentence after being transferred to a hospital.Del Quentin Wilbur, \"City Settles in Death Of Paralyzed Inmate\", Washington Post, 2 December 2008 The case provoked a series of op-ed pieces in the Washington Post by columnist Colbert I. King.Colbert I. King, \"For Jonathan Magbie, a Catalogue of Injustice\", Washington Post, 5 December 2008 A report by the Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure concluded that Retchin had erred but cleared her of judicial misconduct.
