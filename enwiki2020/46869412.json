In 2005, he shared with Silber and with Elizabeth Vargas a Mongerson Prize for Investigative Reporting on the News Award of Distinction from the Medill School of Journalism for work done for ABC's 20/20. He is an alumnus of the Film Residency at the Ucross Foundation. ==Career== Jimenez directed and produced for WTXF-TV the 1995 documentary Yearbook: The Class of '65, documenting Philadelphia's Thomas Edison High School graduating class of 1965, which is believed to have suffered an unusually high number of casualties in the Vietnam war. He is a co-founder of the advocacy group New Yorkers Against Hidden Predators. The group seeks for the \"Child Victims Act\" to be passed which Jimenez has promoted for over ten years. Jimenez is a trustee of the Ucross Foundation. He has written for Daily Beast, Medium, the New York Post, Byliner and Out. ==The Book of Matt== In 2013 Jimenez published The Book of Matt, an analysis of the murder of Matthew Shephard. Jimenez first visited Laramie shortly after the murder, planning to write a screenplay and believing that the murder was a straightforward homophobic killing. Jimenez spent 13 years researching the murder, and came to the conclusion that Matthew and one of the men convicted of his murder were involved in the illegal trade in crystal meth. Jimenez has said his motivation for writing the book as a desire to show that \"the popular narrative (of homophobic murder) served a purpose, but it\u2019s only one thread of a bigger, richer, more challenging story whose lessons we have barely learned. To avoid topics of addiction, including how crystal meth ravaged the queer community (and Matt\u2019s life), is not helpful to anyone.\" == References == Category:American male journalists Category:Living people Category:Georgetown University alumni Category:People from Brooklyn Category:LGBT journalists from the United States Category:Gay writers Category:Television producers from New York City Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
