Nigeria signed the Extradition Treaty with the United States on December 22, 1931 and entered into force on June 24, 1935. Since then Nigeria has extradited several persons to the United States for various reasons ranging from drug, advance fee fraud, and terrorism related offenses. On August 28, 2013 a court in Nigeria on the request of the U.S. Embassy ordered the extradition to the US one Lawal Olaniyi Babafemi's on a federal indictment charging him for providing support to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula by recruiting members to train in Yemen.

A U.S. State Department official told The Associated Press that the department does not comment on law enforcement matters. There is no public record showing the extradition of United States citizens to Nigeria since the treaty became effective in 1935. Despite being the party benefiting more from the treaty, the State Department in a 2009 report described Nigeria's extradition practices and procedures as an obstacle to anti-crime efforts. The report states that the US has several extradition requests pending in Nigeria for years. =United Kingdom= The Hon.
