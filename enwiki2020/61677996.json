But ultimately the human story of this scrappy and magnetic man keeps the doc on track.\" Steve Newall of the New Zealand Herald gave it 3 out of 5 stars, writing that the film \"should hold differing types of appeal to various generations. For older viewers it'll be the retelling of a familiar story of one of their fallen heroes, whereas others may gravitate to the mid-20th-century motorsport environment\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it 2 out of 5 stars, calling it a \"motor- racing film only for petrolheads\" that \"does not tell us why we should be interested in its subject\" because it \"makes no serious attempt at reaching out beyond its fanbase, connecting with non-petrolheads, or gaining any perspective on the sometimes scary and dysfunctional world of motor racing\". John Nugent of Empire gave it 2 stars, writing that the film is \"assembled in such a way that can only appeal to the target Top Gear demographic. Non- petrolheads need not apply.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:Documentary films about auto racing Category:English-language films Category:2017 documentary films Category:Films directed by Roger Donaldson Category:Films set in New Zealand Category:Films shot in New Zealand Category:New Zealand films Category:New Zealand documentary films ",
