    "text": "Michael James Holmes (born August 3, 1963) is a Canadian builder/contractor, businessman, investor, television host, and philanthropist. In his first television series, Holmes on Homes, he rescues homeowners from renovations gone wrong. He usually discovers more serious problems, such as dangerous wiring, asbestos, mold, inadequate insulation, structural damage and more, concealed behind pristine surfaces. He and his team promise to \"Make It Right,\" even if it means stripping a house down to its bones. He has continued in several successor TV series; the most recent one is Holmes and Holmes. ==Background== Mike Holmes learned his craft from his father, who started teaching him construction work when he was 6 years old. By the time he was 19, Holmes had started his first contracting company with a crew of 13 employees. At 21, Holmes founded his own renovation company. He has run two companies during his 20-year contracting career. He has three children: Amanda, Sherry, and Mike Jr., who have all appeared and worked on his shows. In 2006, Holmes started The Holmes Foundation after seeing a renovation that was so poorly done that he felt it was necessary for him to tear the house down and start again rather than try to repair the damage. The purpose of The Holmes Foundation is to encourage young people to enter the building trades as well as to assist those who have been impoverished by bad renovations. Holmes works with SOS Children's Villages. In 2006, Mike Holmes was recognized in the House of Commons of Canada for his promotion of skilled trades and for his advocacy for improved building standards. He was acknowledged as an \"extraordinary craftsperson\" and \"an accomplished master builder with a social conscience\". Holmes is the author of two successful books: the national bestseller Home Renovation with Canada\u2019s Most Trusted Contractor () and Holmes Inspection: Everything you Need to Know Before You Buy or Sell Your Home (), as well as a weekly newspaper column. He is the national spokesperson for Skills/Comp\u00e9tences Canada and for WorldSkills Calgary 2009, and is often invited to speak by professional organizations, such as the Canadian Safety Association of Ontario, the Ontario Building Inspectors Association, and the Canadian Association of Home & Property Inspectors.
