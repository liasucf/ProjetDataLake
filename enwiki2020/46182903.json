He is most remembered for his salon compositions for piano. ==Biography== Wachs was the son of the French composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Wachs (born 1825, died 1899). He was a student at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he was taught by multiple teachers, including Victor Mass\u00e9, Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel and C\u00e9sar Franck. After his days of study, he became the second organist at the Church of Saint- Sulpice. In 1874, he left this position to be the choirmaster at the Church of Saint-Merri. This position had been held by famous composer Camille Saint- Sa\u00ebns. He held this position until 1896. In 1908, Wachs bought a large property, which he named Les Myrtles after one of his pieces. He lived here with his family until he died on 6 July 1915.
