    "text": "Hola\u0161ovice (, o Holschowitz) is a small historic village located in the south of the Czech Republic, 16 kilometres west of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice. Village belongs to the municipality Jankov. To the south lies the protected landscape area of Blansk\u00fd Forest. The village was deserted after the Second World War, allowing its medieval plan and vernacular buildings in the South Bohemian Folk or Rural Baroque style to remain intact. It was restored and repopulated from 1990, and it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. ==History== Hola\u0161ovice is first mentioned in 1263. In 1292, King Wenceslaus II gave the village and several others to the Cistercian monastery of Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod. It remained the property of the monastery until 1848. left Between 1520 and 1525, Hola\u0161ovice was nearly wiped out by the bubonic plague. Only two of its inhabitants survived. A column erected over the plague grave at the north end of the village commemorates this event. The monastery gradually repopulated the village with settlers from Bavaria and Austria. By 1530, the population had risen to 17, according to the monastery's records, and it had become a mainly German-speaking enclave within the Czech language area. By 1900, there were 163 inhabitants of German ethnic origin and 1 of Czech ethnic origin. After the displacement of German residents at the end of the Second World War, many farms in the village were deserted and fell into disrepair. Hola\u0161ovice became a desolate and abandoned place under the Czech post-war Communist regime. From 1990, the village was lavishly restored and inhabited once more. It now has a population of around 140. ==Buildings== Hola\u0161ovice is a typical Bohemian village for the Hlubock\u00e1 Blatsk\u00e1 area around \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice. It consists of 23 brick farmyards containing 120 buildings, each with their gable end facing a central broad village green, with a fish pond and chapel. The buildings date from the 18th to 20th century, with most of them built in the second half of the 19th century. They are constructed in the South Bohemian Folk Baroque style. The chapel of St. John of Nepomuk in the village green was built in 1755. ==Gallery== File:Hola\u0161ovice Historic Village-112776.jpg|Village with door File:Hola\u0161ovice Historic Village-112757.jpg|Village with stream File:Hola\u0161ovice Historic Village-112759.jpg|Village with tree File:Hola\u0161ovice Historic Village-112761.jpg|View of bell steeple File:Hola\u0161ovice Historic Village-112755.jpg|Village with facades ==References== ==External links== *Pruvodce.com *Entry on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites *Holasovice.eu *Virtual show Category:World Heritage Sites in the Czech Republic Category:Villages in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice District ",
