He was the pastor of the non-denominational Church of the Strangers in New York City from 1868 to 1893. ==Early life== Deems was born in Baltimore, Maryland. As a child, he delivered lectures on temperance and on Sunday schools before he was fourteen years old. He graduated from Dickinson College in 1839. ==Career== Deems taught and preached in New York City for a few months, and in 1840 took charge of the Methodist Episcopal church at Asbury, New Jersey, and removed in the next year to North Carolina, where he was General Agent for the American Bible Society. Deems was professor of logic and rhetoric at the University of North Carolina from 1842 to 1847, and professor of natural sciences at Randolph Macon College (then at Boydton, Virginia) in 1847\u20131848, and after two years of preaching at New Bern, North Carolina, he held for four years (1850\u20131854) the presidency of Greensboro, N.

He continued as a Methodist Episcopal clergyman at various pastorates in North Carolina from 1854 to 1865, for the last seven years being a presiding elder and from 1859 to 1863 being the proprietor of St Austins Institute, Wilson.

He was influential in securing from Vanderbilt the endowment of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
