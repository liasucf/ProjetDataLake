His multiple collaborations (Leonard Bernstein, Seiji Ozawa...) associated with his real desire to transmit to young artists gave rise to vocations, such as those of choral conductors Michel Lapl\u00e9nie, Laurence Equilbey, and Denis Rouger. In February 2009, he was made a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.
