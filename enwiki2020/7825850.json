It is a tourist destination in the Alps, both because of the local wine and because it was the setting of the story Heidi. == History == Schloss Brandis with vineyards in the foreground Maienfeld lies along a key route through the Rhine Valley in the Alps. Prehistoric Bronze work and a pre-Roman cellar have been found in the city and on St. Luzisteig hill. A 3rd-century Roman station or settlement has been found along the old Roman Road. The 4th or 5th century Tabula Peutingeriana map shows a place called Magia near modern Maienfeld. The village is first mentioned in 831 and was known as Lupinis at that time. The name of the village changed several times over the following centuries and included; Magenza, Lopine, Maging and Magen zu Luppinis. Finally, in 1295 the name Maienvelt was used, which eventually became Maienfeld.(German) City of Maienfeld From the mid 10th century until the mid 12th century, the counts of Bregenz ruled Maienfeld. Their castle at Maienfeld was destroyed in 1079 by Henry IV, HRE during the Investiture Controversy. The current Schloss Brandis was initially built in 1270\u201375 by the von den Aspermont family and later by Friedrich VII, count of Toggenburg. In 1465 it was rebuilt and expanded by the Baron von Brandis. The town was also fortified in the 13th century. A tall and thick section of wall is still standing today. The town walls enclosed an area of about . The walls were thickened and raised to in the 14th century and then, in a third phase, topped with thick crenallations and raised to . St. Luzisteig pass Maienfeld is first mentioned as a town in 1346, however it seems to have lacked a town government (until 1437) or guilds. In 1388 Maienfeld acquired the rights to charge a toll on the Roman Road that led from Chur over the St. Luzisteig to the north. Maienfeld also had a market, though the neighboring city of Malans had the market right. Following the death of the Toggenburger line, Maienfeld joined the League of the Ten Jurisdictions in 1436. In 1438 the city reached an agreement with the von Brandis and von Aarburg (inheritors of some Toggenburg lands) families. The agreement gave Maienfeld a set of rights and gave the city the right to Low Justice over the communities of Malans and Jenins. During the 14th century the Walser moved into the Maienfeld area and founded settlements that eventually became the Walser part of town. However, it would take several centuries until the Walser were granted full citizen rights. Maienfeld had been fully Romansh before this time, but during the Germanic-speaking Walser immigration Maienfeld became Germanized. By the 16th century the region was nearly completely Germanic. Aerial view from 400 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1924) In 1458 the town was devastated by a fire. During the 1499 Swabian War Maienfeld was forced to open its gates to the invading Austrian army. After the Austrians left the area, it was attacked by Three Leagues troops who plundered the town. In 1509 the Three Leagues bought Maienfeld from the von Brandis and put the city under the Protectorate of the Three Leagues. This led to an unusual situation where Maienfeld, as a voting member of the League of the Ten Jurisdictions and therefore a voting member of the Three Leagues, was also under the protection and control of the Three Leagues. Maienfeld indirectly set policy for managing Maienfeld. In 1529 the Tardis bridge was built over the Rhine river, shifting trade routes away from Maienfeld. In 1622 and again in 1720 the town was heavily damaged due to fire. It was the home of the scholar Hortensia von Moos (1659\u20131715) who is known for her writings on the status of women. == Description == Chur Rhein valley, (l to r) Landquart, Maienfeld, Jenins and Malans.
