He attended night classes and earned an MBA from Michigan State University in 1970 and later received an honorary doctorate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Stempel was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Engineering Society of Detroit. He was the first chairman of the American Quality Foundation, developed by the American Society for Quality Control.

Stempel subsequently worked on the team that developed the 1966 Toronado, the first modern American front- wheel-drive car. According to a GM biography, Stempel designed the Toronado's front suspension and its engine and transmission mounting system. Stempel joined the engineering department of the Chevrolet Division as chief engineer in 1974 and was named Chevrolet's director of engineering in 1975. In 1978, Stempel was appointed general manager of the Pontiac Motor Division where he worked on the Fiero - which used a plastic-body/space frame technology that became integral to GM's subsequent minivans and the Saturn lineup. In 1980, he was moved into the Managing Director position at Adam Opel AG, the German subsidiary of GM. In 1982, he returned to Detroit as General Manager of Chevrolet. In January 1984, he was promoted to the dual responsibility of Vice President and Group Executive in Charge of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group.

Stempel was named chairman in 1995. Shortly after Stempel became chairman, ECD partnered engineered and provided the nickel-metal hydride batteries powered the EV-1. In 1999, ECD partnered with Intel in a joint-venture called Ovonyx which developed nonsilicon-based memory for electronic devices for Intel, Samsung Electronics and BAE Systems. Subsequently, ECD formed joint ventures with Texaco Energy Systems Inc., GE Plastics and Belgium-based N.V. Bekaert S.A. The promising technologies were unfortunately met with losses. Before retiring in 2007, Stempel was chairman of Energy Conversion for almost 12 years. Ovshinsky called Stempel \"a visionary who saw the need for the U.S. to be independent of foreign oil.\" Before retiring in 2007, Stempel was chairman of Energy Conversion for almost 12 years.
