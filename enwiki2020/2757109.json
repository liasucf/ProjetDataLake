    "text": "Neny Fjord is a fjord which is long in an east\u2013west direction and wide, between Red Rock Ridge and Roman Four Promontory on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. == History == This coast was first explored in 1909 by Jean- Baptiste Charcot who, it appears, gave this name to a feature somewhat north of the bay described. The British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) made a detailed survey of this area in 1936\u20131937, and in correlating their work with that of Charcot applied the name Neny Fjord to the bay between Red Rock Ridge and Roman Four Promontory. The name has become established in this latter position through international acceptance and use. == Further reading == \u2022 Damien Gildea, Antarctic Peninsula - Mountaineering in Antarctica: Travel Guide == External links == * Neny Fjord on USGS website * Neny Fjord on SCAR website * Neny Fjord area satellite image ==References== *A Holocene Paleoclimatic history from Neny Fjord, Antarctic Peninsula at Harvard.edu *Neny, Seno at Australian Antarctic Data Centre Category:Fjords of Antarctica Category:Bodies of water of Graham Land Category:Falli\u00e8res Coast ",
