ESPN writer Brian Campbell said this about \"Bringing Alpha\", \"While 'Bringing The Alpha' is far from a concept album, there's a context of unity to each track that binds the music together. With a total run time of just over 30 minutes, part of the album's charm is that it doesn't belabor or linger; instead it leaves you wanting more \u2013 not just from each one of the album's standout tracks, but from the songwriter himself.\" Eric Heemsoth of National Rock Review gave his opinion on the band's second album, \"As impressive as their debut album, Bringing Alpha and Seventy-One trips Around the Sun are masterpieces of songwriting, instrumentation, overall recording, producing, mixing and mastering. Not sure if credit goes to the recording studio, the producer, the mixer, or even just to the band themselves, but Seventy-One Trips has so many layers to it waiting to be peeled away. Each song is like a beautiful plump head of lettuce; each time you listen to it, you peel away a layer discovering a new one in its place.\" ==Sound Vapors== In March 2018, Marz started the Sound Vapors website. The music site includes interviews with artists, industry professionals and album reviews. In November 2018, he started a music interview podcast. Past episodes include interviews with Kenny Wayne Shepherd, William DuVall of Alice In Chains, Wes Scantlin of Puddle of Mudd, Chris Shiflett of Foo Fighters, Black Stone Cherry, Theory of a Deadman and Tiffany. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Musicians from Detroit Category:American singer-songwriters Category:21st-century American musicians Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American rock singers ",
