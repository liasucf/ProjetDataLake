Bauraha khola, which generally carries mud, boulders and much debris due to steep slope, sweeps the fertile land of Banghushree each year. It ends its presence by mixing with West Rapti River near at Banghushree. Both Damodar road and Dulaiya road cross Bauraha khola to connect Banghushree with Badahara village.
