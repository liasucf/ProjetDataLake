In May 2020, Tokta\u015f admitted to murdering his five-year-old son by suffocating him with a pillow while in the hospital. ==Career== Tokta\u015f made his professional debut for Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi OFTA\u015e in the S\u00fcper Lig on 2 March 2008, coming on as a substitute in the 89th minute for Serkan Atak in the away match against \u00c7aykur Rizespor, which finished as a 0\u20130 draw. In total, he made seven appearances for Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi OFTA\u015e/Hacettepe in the S\u00fcper Lig. ==Murder of son== On 23 April 2020, Tokta\u015f's son Kas\u0131m, aged five, was brought to Dortcelik Children's Hospital in Bursa with a high fever, breathing difficulties, and coughing. This was thought to be caused by COVID-19. Later that day, Kas\u0131m died while in the ICU, which was believed to have been caused by the disease. However, Tokta\u015f went to the police eleven days later on 4 May to confess he had murdered his son while alone in the hospital room. Tokta\u015f admitted to suffocating his son with a pillow over the head for fifteen minutes until he died, before calling a doctor into the room. Tokta\u015f, who said he did not disclose the crime with his family, was subsequently arrested while awaiting trial. In the police report, he stated that he had never loved his son, but that he had no mental issues. He later confessed after feeling remorse. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Malatya Category:Turkish footballers Category:Association football central defenders Category:Bursaspor footballers Category:Hacettepe S.K. footballers Category:Kahramanmara\u015fspor footballers Category:Tarsus Idman Yurdu footballers Category:Siirtspor footballers Category:Ad\u0131yamanspor footballers Category:S\u00fcper Lig players Category:TFF First League players Category:TFF Second League players Category:TFF Third League players Category:Turkish murderers of children Category:Male murderers ",
