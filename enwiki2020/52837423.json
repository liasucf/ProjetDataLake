Botfield's 1828 patent seems to have anticipated most of the elements of the blast furnace as it was used in the 1830s and 1840s. His father was Thomas Botfield (1738\u20131801) who acquired a fortune from collieries and iron manufacture. Thomas Botfield, the younger, was educated at the endowed school of Cleobury Mortimer. He worked as a colliery manager and married in 1800.
