    "text": "The Premier Lacrosse League All-Star Game is a field lacrosse game played between the best players on two teams representing the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). The inaugural game took place on Sunday, July 22, during the 2019 season, at Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles, California. There was also an All-Star Skills Competition that took place on Saturday, July 21 that was streamed on NBC Sports Gold. ==Selection process== The PLL's inaugural All-Star Game featured the league's top 50 players selected by fans. Once the players were selected earlier this season, the PLL held an All-Star Draft on July 9 for team captains Trevor Baptiste of Atlas and Matt Rambo of the Whipsnakes, who both received the most fan votes, to select their 21 teammates. ==Broadcast== The game was broadcast on NBCSN. Analysts Brendan Burke and Ryan Boyle were the play-by-play commentators, along with sideline reporter Chantel McCabe who conducted in-game interviews. Players from each team were mic'd up for \"under-the-helmet\" interviews with analyst Ryan Boyle up in the booth. They were Paul Rabil, Justin Guterding and Jarrod Neumann of Team Baptiste, as well as, opposing team captain Matt Rambo. Syracuse Lacrosse player, Lacrosse Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Jim Brown joined the analysts in the booth during halftime and also gave an opening speech to all the players before the game. Also, Chantel McCabe interviewed legendary lacrosse player Gary Gait during the second quarter. ==Rules== The standard PLL face-off rules were modified for the All-Star Game. (All quarters start with a face-off). *1st Quarter: Same as regular season with Lacrosse face-off. *2nd Quarter: Goalie begins play again after each goal scored. *3rd Quarter: \"Hockey-style\" face-off (like a puck-drop) is in effect. *4th Quarter/Overtime: Same rules as regular season. ==Teams== Team Rambo (captain Matt Rambo, wearing black/gray tie-dye uniforms) vs. Team Baptiste (captain Trevor Baptiste, wearing white/rainbow-colored tie-dye uniforms). All uniforms had name plates with the player's (@) Instagram profile names on the back of their jerseys. ==Outcome== Winners: The score was 17\u201316, Team Baptiste over Team Rambo with a second half comeback, scoring 9 of the final 13 goals of the game. The All-Star game MVP award (presented by Mike Rabil) went to goalie Jack Concannon who had 13 saves with only 5 goals allowed in the second half. The attendance was 8,189. ==Rosters== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; width: 70%\" |- |colspan=5 bgcolor=green style=\"color:white\"|Team Baptise |- ! No. ! Name ! Team !
