    "text": "Moderate is an ideological category which designates a rejection of radical or extreme views, especially in regard to politics and religion. A moderate is considered someone occupying any mainstream position avoiding extreme views and major social change. In United States politics, a moderate is considered someone occupying a centre position on the left\u2013right political spectrum. == History == Aristotle favoured conciliatory politics dominated by the centre rather than the extremes of great wealth and poverty or the special interests of oligarchs and tyrants. == Political position == In recent years, the term political moderates has gained traction as a buzzword. The existence of the ideal moderate is disputed because of a lack of a moderate political ideology. Voters who describe themselves as centrist often mean that they are moderate in their political views, advocating neither extreme left-wing politics nor extreme right-wing politics. Gallup polling has shown American voters identifying themselves as moderate between 35\u201338% of the time over the last 20 years. Voters may identify with moderation for a number of reasons: pragmatic, ideological or otherwise. It has even been suggested that individuals vote for centrist parties for purely statistical reasons. == Religious position == In religion, the moderate position is centered and opposed to liberalism or conservatism. Peter Clarke, The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of Religion, Oxford University Press, UK, 2011, p. 512 For Christianity, moderates in evangelicalism would oppose the ideas of Christian right and Christian fundamentalism, against same-sex marriage but oppose discrimination based on sexual orientation, as well as liberal Christians oppose the idea of Christian left. For Islam, moderates oppose the extreme views of Islamic extremism and Islamic fundamentalism. == See also == * Centrism * Centre-left politics * Centre-right politics * Independent voter * Moderate Democrats * Moderate Islam * Moderate Party (disambiguation) * Moderate Republican * The Establishment == References == * Category:Centrism Category:Political terminology ",
