    "text": "The Linwood Springs Research Station (LSRS) is a raptor research station located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Each fall, the station conducts studies on migrant Northern Saw-Whet Owls are to gain information about their migration routes, molt patterns, mortality rates, and winter and summer ranges. The station also studies Red-shouldered and Sharp-shinned Hawks. These are nesting ecology studies that are conducted annually to determine productivity, reoccupancy, natal dispersal, and nest site fidelity. Additionally, each summer and fall a five-day raptor workshop is offered for those interested in gaining valuable field experience working with many of the techniques used in raptor studies. ==External links== * LSRS Official Site Category:Raptor organizations Category:Biological stations Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Stevens Point, Wisconsin ",
