    "text": "A gin and tea is a two-ingredient cocktail made from gin and tea. One advantage of this cocktail is that herbs and juniper berries are used to flavor gin during the distilling process, while the tea has floral or citrus botanical flavours to play against. For example, a gin with citrus notes can be paired with Earl Grey tea, which has bergamot overtones; and a gin with fruitier notes could be mixed with green tea or a light oolong tea. Floral teas are also sometimes used. Isle of Harris produces gin and tea that can be used together. English breakfast tea can also be mixed with dry gin and lemon juice. ==References== Category:Two-ingredient cocktails Category:Cocktails with gin Category:Cocktails with tea ",
