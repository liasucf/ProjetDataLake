The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine, before released as a hardcover album in 1983. ==Story== In The Black Box, Fantasio opened the mysterious box that Jefferson, Boris and Karl left them (see La ceinture du grand froid), and discovers plans within for thousands of inventions. When he tests one in company of Spirou, it draws the attention of Commander Alexander, who retrieves the box with Kalloway. Spirou must exchange the black box with them for Fantasio's release. Thanks to Jefferson, they discover that the gangsters are hiding in a stronghold in the Sahara, where they are protected by natives. Spirou and Fantasio travel there and succeed in taking the box back from Alexander and Kalloway, while making themselves pass for dead. ==References== * Cauvin publications in Spirou and Nic Broca publications in Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es ==External links== *Spirou official site album index Category:Spirou et Fantasio albums Category:Works originally published in Spirou (magazine) Category:Literature first published in serial form Category:1983 books Category:1978 in comics Category:Comics set in Africa ",
