    "text": "James Allen Cox (born June 1, 1977) better known by the ring name James Storm, is an American professional wrestler who is best known for his time with Impact Wrestling, where is a former TNA World Heavyweight Champion. He is currently one half of the NWA World Tag Team Champions. During his time with Impact Wrestling, Storm became a one-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion, one- time TNA King of the Mountain Champion, a record eight time NWA World Tag Team Champion (7 times as a member of America's Most Wanted with Chris Harris and once with Eli Drake) a record seven-time TNA World Tag Team Champion, (five as a member of Beer Money, Inc. with Bobby Roode and once each with Abyss and Gunner). Storm has held a total of 16 championships in Impact Wrestling. == Early life == James Allen Cox was an amateur wrestler while in high school. In addition, he was a talented basketball player, and was awarded a scholarship to Austin Peay State University (which he was forced to relinquish after injuring his shoulder). == Professional wrestling career == === Early career (1997\u20132002) === Cox's professional wrestling career began when he was trained by Wolfie D, a veteran tag team wrestler, in 1995. His training was hampered by a broken shoulder, and Cox eventually dropped out of Slash's training school. He resumed training with Shane Morton after his shoulder had healed. Cox toured the south-east independent circuit before being signed to a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) developmental deal in 2000. Cox made several appearances for World Championship Wrestling on WCW Worldwide and WCW Saturday Night in 2000 as an enhancement talent, where he assumed the ring name \"James Storm\". Storm returned to the independent circuit after WCW was sold to the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001. === Total Nonstop Action Wrestling === ==== America's Most Wanted (2002\u20132006) ==== Storm wrestled his future tag team partner, Chris Harris, on a \"Legends Night\" show on June 1, 2002. As a result of the match, both wrestlers were hired by the upstart Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. The pair were expected to wrestle as singles wrestlers, but were instead placed into a tag team. They named themselves \"America's Most Wanted\" (AMW) because, according to Storm the name was a reference to his \"little trouble with the law\". On the inaugural TNA pay-per- view on June 19, 2002, Storm and Harris were in two different matches in their TNA debuts (Storm teamed up with Psicosis against The Johnsons, while Harris took part in the Gauntlet for the Gold battle royal for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The pair wrestled together for the first time on the second ever TNA pay-per-view a week later. Storm and Harris quickly became mainstays of the promotion and teamed regularly over the next few years. Splits were teased in early 2003 and again in 2004, but nothing came of them. America's Most Wanted turned heel in late 2005 by helping Jeff Jarrett defeat Raven for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. They went on to join Jarrett's Army, acquiring the managerial skills of Gail Kim in the process. At Bound for Glory, AMW successfully retained their titles against The Naturals. Storm's penchant for wearing cowboy hats resulted in the team often being jeered as \"Brokeback Mountain\", a reference to the movie about homosexual cowboys, during their heel run. In mid-2006, they again teased their split due to miscommunication during their matches, most notably when Harris accidentally hit Storm with a garbage can during a No Disqualification match against Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon). During their run as a team, the duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championship six times. On the December 14, 2006 episode of Impact!, America's Most Wanted came to an end after a feud- ending match with The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez) when Storm hit Harris with a beer bottle, temporarily \"blinding\" Harris's right eye. Storm went on to feud with Petey Williams before turning on Gail Kim and aligning himself with the returning Jacqueline Moore. He then went on a huge winning streak, coming out victorious in matches against Petey Williams, Eric Young, and former partner Chris Harris in his return match, among several others. At the Sacrifice pay-per view, Storm was defeated by Harris in a Texas Death Match, which ended his long-running winning streak. The two faced each other again in a King of the Mountain qualifying match, in which both men hit each other with weapons and caused each other to bleed from the head. Harris speared Storm through the tunnel and both men were counted out. ==== Singles competition (2006\u20132008) ==== Storm wearing his signature cowboy hat After this, he teamed with Robert Roode to defeat Eric Young and Rhino. He and Jacqueline celebrated a tag team victory against Rhino by pouring beer into his mouth, which set off Rhino due to the instant reminder of a history of alcohol abuse that he overcame, thus sparking a feud between them. As the weeks continued, Storm taunted Rhino about \"knowing he likes alcohol\" every chance he got, and continue to try and pour beer in Rhino's mouth any time he defeated him. Storm was able to defeat Rhino at the Victory Road 2007 after hitting Rhino with a beer bottle. Their feud continued with Storm again defeating Rhino in a Bar Room Brawl at Hard Justice. For several weeks, Storm would be included in vignettes where he would try to find Rhino at local bars. Rhino then challenged Storm to a match at No Surrender. Rhino defeated Storm by pinfall after he gored Storm through a table. At Bound for Glory, James Storm took part at the Reverse Battle Royal, which was won by Eric Young. After Rhino was injured, Storm started a feud with Eric Young over who was the better drinker. Young won Storm's World Beer Drinking Championship (a title unrecognised by TNA, actually a WWE Championship toy belt decorated with beer bottles) and held it for two months before losing it back to Storm in a ladder match. Following this, Rhino made his return from injury and proceeded to deliver a Gore to Storm, challenging him to an Elevation X match. As the ladder match with Eric Young had demonstrated, Storm had a (kayfabe) fear of heights, a major disadvantage in Elevation-X. After teasing a walk-out Storm did in fact compete in the match and after attempting to hide inside of the scaffold structure, Storm ended up losing the match and falling through a table in the ring below. Following a couple of weeks off to (kayfabe) heal his injuries, Storm returned on the live March 27 episode of Impact! and attacked Sting with a beer bottle. On the April 4 episode of Impact!, Matt Morgan allowed Storm to join Team Tomko making it a five on four match (until Matt Morgan himself joined Team Cage). At Lockdown, Storm, along with Team Tomko lost their match against Team Cage. Storm was then announced as one of the \"Egotistical Eight\" to participate in the Deuces Wild Tournament, and he would have to team up with a random partner, who was later to be revealed as his bitter rival, Sting. Storm then faced Sting in a \"No Disqualification\" match that Sting won. At Sacrifice, Sting and Storm lost to Team 3D. ==== Beer Money, Inc. (2008\u20132011) ==== TNA World Tag Team Champions On the June 12 episode of Impact, Storm, alongside Robert Roode, challenged LAX for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Storm and Roode were successful in winning the match following a Last Call from Storm to Hernandez with a belt wrapped around his boot. Hector Guerrero (LAX's manager), who was at ringside however, informed the referee about what happened and the match was restarted. LAX ended up retaining the titles following a Border Toss from Hernandez to Storm. After the match, Storm, Roode and Jacqueline handcuffed LAX to the ring posts, and then proceeded to whip them with leather belts. The next week on Impact!, LAX challenged Storm and Roode to a Fan's Revenge Match at Victory Road for the titles. The team of Storm and Roode (now known as \"Beer Money\") lost to The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) in one match and Samoa Joe and Kevin Nash in another match later in the July 3 episode of Impact!. At Victory Road, LAX retained the titles. At Hard Justice, Beer Money defeated LAX after Storm hit Homicide with a beer bottle and won the TNA World Tag Team Championship for the first time individually and as a team. At No Surrender Beer Money, Inc. defeated LAX to retain the titles and two weeks later on Impact! they defeated LAX in a six-person tag team match and as a result Hector Guerrero was forced to leave LAX. At Bound for Glory IV, Beer Money, Inc. won the Monster's Ball Match against Matt Morgan and Abyss, Team 3D and LAX to retain the titles. On the January 8 episode of Impact! they lost the titles to Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed, after Lethal cashed in his \"Feast or Fired\" briefcase. At Genesis Beer Money Inc. won back the TNA World Tag Team Championships when James Storm and Robert Roode defeated Matt Morgan and Abyss and Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed in a 3-way match. Beer Money, Inc. faced Creed and Jay Lethal at Against All Odds, after Lethal and Creed won a number one contenders match against Matt Morgan and Abyss. Eventually Beer Money retained the title after Storm hit the Last Call on Lethal. At Lockdown 2009, Beer Money lost the TNA Tag Team titles to Team 3D in a Philadelphia Street Fight, where Team 3D's IWGP Tag Team Titles were also on the line. Beer Money; Storm (left) and Roode On May 15, 2009, Jeremy Borash announced that Cox had signed a new multi-year deal with TNA the previous day. That same month, Beer Money entered the Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament, during which they turned face. At Sacrifice, Beer Money defeated The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) to win the tournament and earn the right to challenge Team 3D for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. At Slammiversary, Beer Money defeated Team 3D to win the World Tag Team Title for the third time. The following month at Victory Road, Beer Money lost the titles to Booker T and Scott Steiner of The Main Event Mafia. The two teams would see their feud intervene with that of Team 3D and The British Invasion, causing a four-way war that would last the next three months. Beer Money would go on to lose to the British Invasion in an IWGP Tag Team Championship match at Hard Justice, win a Lethal Lockdown match at No Surrender (teaming with Team 3D against the Mafia and the Invasion), and lose a four-way Full Metal Mayhem match at Bound for Glory for both the TNA and IWGP Tag Team Championships, with Team 3D winning the IWGP Tag Team Title and the British Invasion winning the TNA World Tag Team Title. Beer Money were permitted one last title shot the following Impact!, where they fought the British Invasion in a Six Sides of Steel match. Brutus Magnus would have his team disqualified by punching the referee, causing him and Doug Williams to retain the championship. On the November 12 episode of Impact! Beer Money defeated the British Invasion in a non-title match to join the Motor City Machineguns in the Tag Team Title match at Turning Point. At the Pay-Per-View The British Invasion managed to retain their titles after Kevin Nash nailed Storm with the TNA Global Championship belt. At Genesis Storm and Roode scored an upset victory over The Band of Kevin Nash and Syxx-Pac. Fortune: (from left to right) Kazarian, Robert Roode, A.J. Styles, and Storm With Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff taking over TNA at the beginning of 2010, Beer Money's TV time was significantly reduced. Upon their return to Impact!, Beer Money turned heel on the March 8 episode of Impact! by first volunteering to face Jeff Jarrett in a handicap match and then defeating him after a low blow and the DWI, claiming it was the only way they were going to get noticed by the new management. Storm and Roode have since acted as Bischoff's henchmen, taking on wrestlers he's had problems with, often in two-on-one situations. At Destination X Beer Money challenged Matt Morgan and Hernandez for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, but were unable to dethrone the defending champions. At Lockdown Beer Money, along with Sting and Desmond Wolfe, represented Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). They then started a feud with the newly formed team of Jeff Hardy and Mr. Anderson, known collectively as The Enigmatic Assholes, who would go on to defeat them at Slammiversary VIII. On the following episode of Impact! Ric Flair, who had aligned himself with Storm, Roode, A.J. Styles, Desmond Wolfe and Kazarian, announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , stating that each of them would have to earn their spots in the group and that in order for Storm and Roode to earn their spots, they needed to become the Ole Anderson and Tully Blanchard of the group. After the TNA World Tag Team Championship was vacated in June, Beer Money entered a four\u2013team, two\u2013week- long tournament to decide who would get to face The Motor City Machine Guns for the titles at Victory Road. Beer Money advanced to the title match at the pay-per-view by defeating Team 3D and Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore). At Victory Road Beer Money was defeated by the Motor City Machine Guns in the match for the World Tag Team Championship.

On the August 12 episode of Impact! Beer Money, Inc. was defeated in a Two Out of Three Falls match and as a result lost the Best of Five Series 2\u20133. Later that night Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan were added to , as the stable attacked EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former Extreme Championship Wrestling performers. In the weeks leading to Bound for Glory, the stable's name was tweaked to Fortune to represent the expansion in the number of members in the group. At Bound for Glory Storm, Roode, Styles, Kazarian and Morgan were defeated in a Lethal Lockdown match by EV 2.0 members Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Sabu and Stevie Richards. On the following episode of Impact! Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan's and Eric Bischoff's new stable, Immortal.

On the February 3 episode of Impact!, Fortune turned face by attacking Immortal, when they interfered in a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Mr. Anderson and Jeff Hardy. Ric Flair, who did not take part in Fortune's turn due being out with a torn rotator cuff, returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of Impact!, turning on Fortune and jumping to Immortal. On April 17 at Lockdown, Storm, Roode, Kazarian and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J.

He then referenced Storm's daughter to make it \"personal.\" .. Roode said there's no way because he's done with Storm after fighting him for the last year...unless Storm is man up enough to put up the #1 contender spot. Storm thought it over, then told Roode no because he's worked too hard to earn that spot. Roode then told Storm to have his daughter call him when she turns 18-years-old and he'll show him what a real man looks like. Storm had enough and decided to put his #1 contender status on the line On December 9 at Final Resolution, Storm defeated Kazarian in a singles match, and again on the January 3, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling, beginning a rivalry with him and Christopher Daniels.

Following Sanada's loss of the X Division Championship to Austin Aries, Storm would confront Sanada backstage, berate Sanada's mentor The Great Muta, while slapping him in the face as a way to break Sanada down, multiple weeks in a row. On the July 24, 2014 edition of Impact, Storm would confront The Great Muta, calling him a fraud, and proclaim himself to be \"The Legend\" (which in the following weeks replaced his longtime nickname of \"The Cowboy\"). After spitting beer in Muta's face, Sanada would run Storm out of the ring, before attacking Muta himself with a steel chair, and bowing to Storm, revealing an unknown alliance between them. The following week Storm would proclaim himself as Sanada's new mentor, and master. In the following weeks, TNA would air vignettes of Storm having a cult like hold over Sanada, portraying Storm having him tied up, breaking him down physically and mentally, and proclaiming that \"The Revolution is coming\". On the August 27 Impact Wrestling, Sanada accompanied by Storm debuted the new ring name \"The Great Sanada\" and a look inspired by The Great Muta, before defeating Austin Aries with help from Storm. On the September 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm and Sanada abducted former X Division Champion Manik following his loss in a 6-man #1 Contendership match for the X Division Championship. On the following Impact, Storm was shown initiating Manik, much like he did Sanada into his new faction. On the September 17, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling, Storm and The Great Sanada attacked X Division Champion Samoa Joe, and were joined by Manik, now sporting an all new look, joining Storm's group. On the October 8, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling it was announced that James Storm and The Great Sanada would battle The Great Muta and Tajiri in the main event of Bound for Glory.

At Bound For Glory, Storm and The Great Sanada were defeated by Tajiri and The Great Muta. After the match Manik joined in attacking Muta until Team 3D made the save. Following Bound For Glory, the stable, now known as The Revolution began to recruit members of the TNA roster, beginning with one half of the World Tag Team Champions Davey Richards. After teasing tension between Richards and his partner Eddie Edwards, on the November 12, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling, The Revolution demanded Davey's decision. When Davey turned down the Revolution's offer to join, they would attack The Wolves, leaving them vulnerable for Storm to bring out his forgotten Feast or Fired Briefcase, guaranteeing him a Tag Team Championship opportunity, anytime, anyplace. In a further twist, Abyss would reveal himself as Storm's partner, and the newest pledge to The Revolution, subsequently defeating The Wolves for the TNA World Tag Team Championships, making Storm a record six-time champion. At Lockdown, The Revolution successfully retained their titles against The Hardys. On January 30, 2015, The Revolution lost the titles against The Wolves. On April 3, 2015, Storm seemingly broke character and confronted Bram when he attempted to attack Mickie James with a steel chair during Bram's match against Magnus, hinting a possible face turn. However, Magnus and Mickie James confronted Storm after the match, to which Storm replied he was merely looking out for an old friend, hinting he was still a heel. However, this all turned out to be a ruse, as Storm wanted Mickie James to join his Revolution stable. She refused, and security cameras recorded him nudging her onto train tracks, causing a concussion, and fully retaining his status as a heel. Storm defeated Magnus at Slammiversary in a non-sanctioned match. On the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm revealed the new member of The Revolution, who was Serena Deeb. However, Storm and Serena were defeated by Magnus and Mickie James.

The following week, he lost the King of the Mountain Championship in a Title vs. Title match against Lashley. On the August 18 episode of Impact Wrestling, Storm called the official for that match Brian Hebner to the ring to show him how he missed a three-count on Lashley that should have amounted to Storm winning all the titles instead, while complaining to Hebner, TNA President Billy Corgan came down to the ring and interjected himself into the discussion with Storm. Corgan insulted Storm and suggested that Storm \"may not be able to win the big one.\" This set Storm off and he confronted and cornered Corgan, threatening to use Corgan to satisfy his bucket list goal of \"kicking a rockstar's ass\". Storm then left the ring and on the way up the ramp, Corgan yelled \"James Storm is suspended indefinitely\". ==== Death Crew Council (2016-2017) ==== In October, Storm turned heel when he was revealed as one of the masked wrestlers of the newest group known as Death Crew Council (DCC), with Bram and Kingston. Death Crew Council made their debut on the October 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, when they attacked The Tribunal, following the latter's loss to TNA World Tag Team Champions, The Broken Hardys.
