She begins a clandestine affair with the priest, Ingvar Hagson. == Cast == * Viveca Lindfors as Eva \u00d6rn * Georg Rydeberg as Ingvar Hagson * Arnold Sj\u00f6strand as Knut Knutsson of Sj\u00f6valla * Nils Lundell as Albert Sundstr\u00f6m * Anna Lindahl as Greta Knutsson * Gudrun Brost as Helga Persson of Mon * Sven Bergvall as Persson of Mon == Controversy and reception == The novel by Ester Lindin which forms the basis of the film was already very controversial, and when it was announced that it would be adapted for the screen, a delegation of priests petitioned the film company Luxfilm and demanded that filming be stopped. The chief executive officer issued an unofficial warning. Despite this, the film was made and became one of the greatest successes of the 1940s. One reviewer at the time wrote: \"Since her novel was released [Ester Lindin] has had the questionable pleasure of getting pilloried in cheap cabarets and causeries as the amorality priestess number one. The film gives all these moral busybodies an answer that should sting \u2013 never before has moral hypocrisy and the false idyll of the philistine been exposed to such a mighty attack.\" == References == == External links == * https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034329/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast * http://www.svenskfilmdatabas.se/sv/item/?type=film&itemid;=3965 * https://www.filminstitutet.se/sv/fa-kunskap-om-film/ta-del-av- filmsamlingarna/filmer/tank-om-jag-gifter-mig-med-prasten/ * https://www.nt.se/kultur-noje/med-och-om-ester-lindin-om4360046.aspx Category:Swedish films ",
