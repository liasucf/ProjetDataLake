    "text": "Ferritic stainless steel forms one of the four stainless steel families, the other three being austenitic, martensitic and duplex stainless steels == History == Ferritic stainless steels were discovered early but it was only in the 1980s that the conditions were met for their growth: *It was possible to obtain very low carbon levels at the steelmaking stage. *Weldable grades were developed. *Themomechanical processing solved the problems of \"roping\" and \"ridging\" that led to inhomogenous deformation during deep drawing and to textured surfaces. *End-user markets (such as that of domestic appliances) demanded less expensive grades with a more stable price at a time when there were large variations of the price of nickel . Ferritic stainless steel grades became attractive for some applications such as houseware. == Metallurgy == Fe - Cr Phase diagram To qualify as stainless steel, Fe-base alloys must contain at least 10.5%Cr. The Iron-Chromium phase diagram shows that up to about 13%Cr, the steel undergoes successive transformations upon cooling from the liquid phase from ferritic \u03b1 phase to austenitic \u03b3 phase and back to \u03b1. When some carbon is present, and if cooling occurs quickly, some of the austenite will transform into martensite.Tempering/annealing will transform the martensitic structure into ferrite and carbides. Above about 17%Cr the steel will have a ferritic structure at all temperatures. Above 25%Cr the Sigma phase may appear for relatively long times at temperature and induce room temperature embrittlement. == Chemical compositions of a few grades (main alloying elements) == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Chemical compositions (Balance: Fe) ! rowspan=\"2\" |AISI / ASTM ! rowspan=\"2\" |EN ! colspan=\"2\" |Weight % |- !Cr !Other elements |- |405 |1.4000 |12.0 - 14.0 | - |- |409L |1.4512 |10.5 - 12.5 |6(C+N)3 !Electrical Resistance \u03bc\u03a9.m !Thermal Conductivity at 20 \u00b0C W/(m.\u00b0K) !Specific Heat 0 - 100 \u00b0C J/(Kg.\u00b0K) !Themal expansion 0 - 600 \u00b0C 10\u22126/\u00b0K !Young's Modulus GPa |- |409 / 410 |7.7 |0.58 |25 |460 |12 |220 |- |430 |7.7 |0.60 |25 |460 |11.5 |220 |- |430Ti / 439 / 441 |7.7 |0.60 |25 |460 |11.5 |220 |- |434 / 436 / 444 |7.7 |0.60 |23 |460 |11.5 |220 |- |447 |7.7 |0.62 |17 |460 |11 |220 |} Compared to austenitic stainless steels, they offer a better thermal conductivity, a plus for applications such as heat exchangers The thermal expansion coefficient, close to that of carbon steel, facilitates the welding to carbon steels == Mechanical properties == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Mechanical properties (Cold Rolled) ! colspan=\"4\" |ASTM A240 ! colspan=\"4\" |EN 10088-2 |- ! !UTS MPa, min !0.2% Yield Stress MPa, min !Elongation %, min ! !UTS MPa !0.2% Yield Stress MPa, min !Elongation %, min |- |409 |390 |170 |20 |1.4512 |380 - 560 |220 |25 |- |410 |415 |205 |20 |1.4003 |450 - 650 |320 |20 |- |430 |450 |205 |22 |1.4016 |450 - 600 |280 |18 |- |439 |415 |205 |22 |1.4510 |420 - 600 |240 |23 |- |441 |415 |205 |22 |1.4509 |430 - 630 |250 |18 |- |434 |450 |240 |22 |1.4113 |450 - 630 |280 |18 |- |436 |450 |240 |22 |1.4526 |480 -560 |300 |25 |- |444 |415 |275 |20 |1.4521 |420 - 640 |320 |20 |} == Applications == * Lower-cost or recent-production kitchenware * White goods * Solar heaters * Slate hooks * Coins ==References== Category:Stainless steel ",
