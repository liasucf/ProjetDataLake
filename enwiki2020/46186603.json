    "text": "Hybrid Theory World Tour was the first concert tour by American nu metal band Linkin Park. It was launched in support of Linkin Park's debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000). The tour started on July 22, 2000 in St. Petersburg (Florida) and ended on December 9, 2001 in Universal City (California). The duration of the tour was almost half year. The tour consisted of four legs which made a total of 57 shows. The promotion for the album was done by various other tours like Deftones' \"Back To School\" Tour, \"Ozzfest\", \"Family Values Tour\", \"Countdown To Revolution Tour\" and \"Projekt Revolution\" which the band headlined or acted as a supporting act. == Background == The tour was never officially announced. But in an article by MTV named as Hybrid Odyssey in honour of the album, the dates of all the shows by Linkin Park were included. The same was announced in a documentary with the same name.Linkin Park - A Hybrid Odyssey Full Video (Hybrid Theory Documentary) YouTube September 12, 2012. Retrieved March 21, 2015. === Early shows === The band started their tour as a support band. They first supported The Union Underground in their An Education in Rebellion Tour, then supported Kottonmouth Kings on their Ridin' High Tour (although three shows of this leg were cancelled), then P.O.D. on their Kings of the Game Tour and finally Papa Roach on their Master Bay Tour. The band also performed headlining shows and radio showcases when they had occasion. === Hybrid Theory European Promo Tour === The band's first headlining tour was named \"Hybrid Theory European Promo Tour\". It consisted of only five shows. All the shows in the leg were in Europe. The concert was played in France, Germany and England. The duration of the first leg was just four days. The leg was played for various events like \"Nulle Part Ailleurs\" and \"BBC Radio One Evening Session\". The first show in the tour was a promo show for Rock Sound Magazine. The second show by the band was Linkin Park's first TV appearance. The show by the band in London was aired by BBC. The song \"Papercut\" recorded while the show was made available as a special edition with the album. === Street Soldiers Tour === The \"Street Soldiers Tour\" acted as the first fully headlining North American leg for the tour. The tour started in January 2001, and ended in February 2001. Taproot and Styles of Beyond were included as special guests in the tour. Later Alien Ant Farm replaced Styles of Beyond as Special guests. Whereas Stephen Richards gave a special appearance for a few shows in the tour besides he was with his own band \"Taproot\". The first show was played for 107.7 The End 'Endsession' which was the first ever headlining show for the band. The duration of the leg was a month and it included 20 shows across the United States. During the show at San Bernardino, B-Real from Cypress Hill introduced Linkin Park to the stage. The Dragon festival consisted of two stages, each inside a separate hangar at the Events Center - Jade Chamber and Crimson Chamber. Between the two hangars many booths were set up promoting various radio stations and selling food, drink, and products ranging from T-shirts to CDs to water pipes. Bands that played in the Jade Chamber consisted mainly of electronica and turntablists, while groups in the Crimson Chamber consisted of live bands and hip-hop bands. \"Crawling\" was released in a multi-angle video on the \"Frat Party at the Pankake Festival\" DVD with the studio version overdubbed, but with the crowd noise mixed in. After the show at Minnesota, Mike Shinoda wrote in the tour diary as, === Back to School Tour === This was the first full European tour of the band. They opened for Deftones, with Taproot being the opening band. === US-To-Europe Tour === The first show was played in support for Boarding for Breast Cancer. The duration of the leg was three months and it included 21 shows across the United States, Asia, Australia and Europe. This leg was a compact world tour in support of the album. Mike wrote on internet as tour diary as, === Hybrid Theory European Tour === As the band played around with their touring schedule in September 2001, originally they were to take a break after Ozzfest and then kick off an eleven show headlining tour of Europe in September. This show in Stockholm was the first show of the tour. Stockholm and Frederiksberg were cancelled just before the tour began for an unknown reason. The first three shows were cancelled due to various reasons. The reason for cancelling the second show was given as \"Because of the \"restructuring\" of their U.S. tour has Linkin Park decided to cancel their concert in KB Hallen 9 September. Since there is no immediate prospect of a replacement concert, the tickets will be refunded where they were purchased until 15 October.\" The third show was cancelled due to the September 11 attacks. Addressing to the fans Mike said, === Countdown to Revolution Tour === The final leg of their tour took place after the band participated on the Family Values Tour, as a warm-up leg before the inaugural Projekt Revolution festival tour in early 2002. == Set list == This set list is representative of the average set list throughout tour. # \"With You\" # \"Runaway\" # \"Papercut\" # \"By Myself\" # \"Points of Authority\" # \"High Voltage\" # \"Crawling\" # \"Pushing Me Away\" # \"And One\" # \"In the End\" # \"A Place for My Head\" # \"Forgotten\" # \"One Step Closer\" ;Note *
