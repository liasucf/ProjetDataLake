    "text": "An artist's illustration showing WASP-76b during its night hours. WASP-76b is a hot Jupiter exoplanet discovered during 2013 which can be found in the constellation Pisces. It orbits a F-type star BD+01 316 (WASP-76) and has a size 0.92 that of Jupiter's mass. In March 2020, it was speculated what as the temperature on the planet reaches 2,400C on hot side, this appears to be hot enough to vaporize neutral iron. If the night side of WASP-76b have temperatures down to at least 1,400C, the iron may condense then rain down as hot liquid iron on its surface. The planet equilibrium temperature is 2190 K, yet measured dayside temperature is still hotter at 2500 K. Study shows that WASP-76b seems to be the only planet in its solar system. In May 2020, it was discovered what the previously HST-taken spectra of WASP-76b were distorted by the light from the suspected stellar companion. Therefore, updated atmospheric model is cloudy hydrogen-helium envelope, **non-detection of alternatively reported neutral iron** (including \"iron rain\"), and only upper limits on oxides of titanium and vanadium. Combination of data from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes have allowed to detect titanium oxide and traces of water in atmosphere of WASP-76b though. The atmosphere of WASP-76b is cloudy and mostly grey, with a significant amount of thermal incandescence. ==See also== *WASP-7b *WASP-12b *WASP-121b ==References== Category:Exoplanets discovered by WASP Category:Hot Jupiters Category:Giant planets ",
