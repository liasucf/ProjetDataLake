    "text": "Painting of Maria Prado de Bellido, Artist unknown Mar\u00eda Parado de Bellido (5 July 1777 \u2013 11 May 1822) was an indigenous Peruvian revolutionary during the struggle for independence from Spain. ==Life== She was born in Ayacucho, also known as Huamanga. She married Mariano Bellido when she was 15 years old. Her husband and one of her sons were fighting for independence, and she passed on information about Spanish troop movements, dictating and signing her letters as she was illiterate. After one of her letters was intercepted by the Spanish she was captured and interrogated, but said she would rather die than betray her country: \"no estoy aqu\u00ed para informar a ustedes, sino para sacrificarme por la causa de la libertad\". She was shot by the Spanish on 11 May 1822. She is considered a Peruvian heroine, and oral tradition has created several myths about her. It is said that General Carratala, in an attempt to persuade her to talk, ordered soldiers to burn down her home where her daughters lived, but that they were saved because local people warned them to escape; that she paused outside the church of Santo Domingo, on the way to her execution, to kneel and pray to the Virgin Mary; and that after her execution a priest claimed her body and buried it in consecrated ground at the church of La Merced. It has been said that \"Bellido has become a figure of near mythical proportions deeply interwoven with the Peruvian sense of nationhood\". She is commemorated in the name of Mar\u00eda Parado de Bellido District in Callao Province of Peru. The painting Fusilamiento de Mar\u00eda Parado de Bellido (The Shooting of ...) by Consuelo Cisnero (1929) is held in the National Museum of the Archaeology. In 1975 a Peruvian postage stamp bore her portrait as part of a set of stamps for \"Year of Peruvian Women\". 340x340px ==References== Category:1777 births Category:1822 deaths Category:18th-century Peruvian women Category:Executed Peruvian women Category:Peruvian people of indigenous peoples descent Category:Peruvian revolutionaries Category:People from Ayacucho ",
