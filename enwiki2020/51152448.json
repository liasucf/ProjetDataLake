The Annals of Connacht 1338 state- Tadc son of Ruaidri son of Cathal Ruad O Conchobair, who was called Bratach Righin, was taken prisoner by Tomas Mag Samradain and many of his followers were killed.

The capture of Thomas and his release are preserved in Glangevlin folklore, which states- A story six centuries old is told by Thomas McGovern, a chief of Tullyhaw. It is said that he made a prisoner of the great Teighe O Connor of Connaught better known as Bratach Fighinn (of the firm standard). The ambitious McGovern refused to liberate the chieftain until he received from him a documentary agreement for the hand of his daughter in marriage together with a dowry befitting a king's daughter. In due course the Chieftain of Tullyhaw sallied forth across the 'Grey Ridge County' for his bride, but the winsome Una O'Connor, who was already plighted refused, to marry McGovern. He persisted but the Clan Murtagh O'Connor of Sligo and the Muintir Eolus of Leitrim took McGovern and never dropped him until they landed in his native Derrynananta, Glangevlin and on the way they subjected him to frequent 'possings' in the ditches. This has given rise to the popular saying on threat in the district 'I'll poss you like Tom McGovern'.

The Annals of Ulster for 1337 state- Brian Mag Samradhain junior was killed by the Tellach-Dunchadha.

It attracted poets from all over Ireland and even as far away as Scotland. A poet would leave his own house, where he often ran a poet's school, and set off on circuit. When arriving at a lord's castle he would be given free food and board in exchange for entertaining the lord and his guests. If the lord agreed, then the poet would compose a praise poem in the chief's honour which would then be recited in front of the assembled guests and afterwards transcribed into the chief's family poem book or Duanaire, along with the poems of previous poets. In return the chief would pay the poet with cattle or a horse or gold. The poet would then leave and visit another lord's castle on the circuit, eventually returning to his own home laden with gifts. The McGovern Duanaire or Book of Magauran is the oldest such Duanaire still surviving. The earliest poem in the book was composed in honour of Brian \u2018Breaghach\u2019 M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in c.1290 and the latest poem is in honour of Niall M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in, the son of Tom\u00e1s, composed about 1362. The majority of poems in the book are dedicated to Tom\u00e1s who was regarded as a generous patron of poets, poems 10, 12, 18 to 27, 29 and 31, mainly praising him for his generosity and all the cattle-raids he led on neighbouring chiefs. They were composed by the following poets who visited the castle during his reign- Maoilinn \u00d3g, Maol P\u00e1draig Mac Naimhin (or Cn\u00e1imh\u00edn), Aonghus \u00d3'hEoghusa (d.1350), Maol Seachlainn \u00d3'hEoghusa, \u00c1dhamh \u00d3'Fial\u00e1n and three poets from the noted poetic O'Higgins family, Raghnall \u00d3'hUiginn (d.1325), Niall \u00d3'hUiginn (d.1340) and Giolla na Naomh \u00d3'hUiginn (d.1349). When visiting Tom\u00e1s the poets slept on couches made of bright woven straw. ==Personal Appearance== According to the Book of Magauran, Tom\u00e1s had long curly blonde hair, which was braided. He had fair skin, dark bushy eyebrows and dark eyelashes. He had blue-green eyes, red lips, white teeth and a smooth clean-shaven ruddy face with a tendency to blush. He wore rings on his fingers. His sword had a gold hilt. He loved playing with his hounds. His wife Nualaidh also had curly blond hair which was braided. She did embroidery. Tom\u00e1s had an army of 700 horsemen armed with spears made of red shafts of ash- wood having blued-steel points, to which were attached bright satin pennants. They wore thin tunics instead of armour and had long swords strapped to their waists and white shields strapped to their backs. He also had a troop of bowmen. His army consisted of his tribesmen and also of hired mercenaries from all over Ireland. Their war-cry was Cenn Cruaich in honour of their local god Crom Cruach. The castle had three food-cauldrons, one for the chief's own household, one for the army and one for his wife and her ladies. ==Death== Tom\u00e1s died in 1340 (in his bed at Coologe according to the Book of Magauran) but some annals give a later date. The Annals of Ulster for 1340 state- Thomas Mag Samradhain, unique choice of the chiefs of Ireland, died. The Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1343 state- Thomas Magauran, chief of Teallach Eachdhach Tullyhaw, died.

The Annals of Loch C\u00e9 for 1343 state- Thomas Mac Samhradhain, dux of Tellach-Echach, quievit. ==Family== Tom\u00e1s married Nualaidh, the daughter of the Maguire chief and Maguire's wife \u00c9adaoin \u00d3\u2019Ceallaigh. Their sons were Tighearn\u00e1n, Brian (d. 1337), Niall M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in who succeeded Tom\u00e1s as chief and died in 1359, Aedh (d. 1351), S\u00e9an, Conchobhar, Fearghal M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in who also became chief and died in 1393, Maghnus 'Ruadh' M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in who also became chief and died in 1408, Giolla na Naomh, Tadhg Buidhe (d.1367), Maghnus Buidhe (d.1354) and Matha (d.1356). ==References== Category:1340 deaths Category:Irish lords Category:People from County Cavan Category:14th-century Irish people ",
