    "text": "Perfect one day and heaven the next, this is the Philippines. The Philippine Hobie Challenge is a long distance race using the Hobie 16 sailing catamaran manufactured by the Hobie Cat Company. The event, organized by the Philippine Inter-island Sailing Foundation, Inc. (PHINSAF), consists of two race series: Inshore and Challenge Series. The Inshore Series consists of five short races of approximately 40 minutes each, where competitors sail around course marks anchored close inshore. In the Challenge Series, competitors will spend between five and eight hours a day sailing, all depending on their respective skills, the sea conditions and the prevailing wind, over 200 nautical miles, through the course of five daily passages along a route selected by the organizers. The team with the lowest elapsed time from the origin to the destination flies home at the end of the week with the prestigious Philippine Hobie Challenge trophy. In between the race legs, the participants take part in reaching out to the communities along the coastal villages, making donations of school supplies and basic medicines. The Philippine Hobie Challenge is a unique way of gathering sailing enthusiasts and providing them an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of the Philippine islands, thereby creating awareness on caring for the environment and supporting the communities that inhabit these areas. The Fossil Cup is an awards category founded by one of the most ardent supporters of the Challenge, and which uses a handicapping system that rewards sailors who improved the most during the week-long race, also had its share of the spotlight. ==History== The First Challenge Sometime late 1999, a small group of international Hobie 16 catamaran sailors envisioned an extreme sailing event that will take them to different islands in the Philippines; six days in the open seas and camping in rustic areas. Thus, the Philippine Hobie Challenge had its relatively modest start in March 2001 with five (5) regional teams making the 190 nautical-mile passage from Lucena, Quezon down to Boracay. Michael Scantlebury, who was in the group that conceptualized the event, eventually took the honours of winning the first Challenge. Warm waters, flat water and lots of sun are the normal. Dreaming the Impossible The highly successful inaugural event proved the concept of long distance racing in Hobie 16 catamarans to be workable and the Challenge had its repeat in March 2001. This time, entries had more than doubled to twelve (12), including teams flying in from HK, Australia and Europe. Using experience gained during the first event, the organizers scheduled a 5-race inshore series and the Challenge series with 5 consecutive daily passages, taking the teams 154 nautical miles from the Batangas resort of Maya-Maya down to Maricaban Bay in Northern Palawan. The team from Down Under, Andrew Keag and Naomi Angwin, bested the rest of the fleet to win the 2nd Philippine Hobie Challenge. In 2002, the Challenge went Northwest, taking fifteen (15) teams from Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur down to Subic Bay, Zambales. Blood Red, the team of Chris Steilberg, Dave Harris and Krishan George took honors in this 230 nautical mile race. Challenge 14 competitors Subsequent Challenges In 2003 the offshore Challenge series started from the whale shark capital of the Philippines, Donsol, and ended down in Cebu. Peter Davies, with David Harris, finished first, and with 1 win at Donsol and 2 in Alegre, Haswell and Heider made up for their relatively poor offshore performance by garnering a first in the Inshore series. 2004 marked the 5th Hobie Challenge one of the best challenges ever, taking the sailors from the icing sugar sands of Boracay all the way across to Palawan. This marked the largest fleet of Hobies yet - 27 teams from all over the globe. This trip included a visit to Amanpulo and even an African style safari on Calauit Island. Dancers at the challenge 15 Presentation night A great success Now firmly cemented into the Hobie Sailing schedules, organizers of The Philippine Hobie Challenge are pointing their sails towards new and exciting routes. Set on promoting sailing as a means to see the eco and adventure tourism destination that is the Philippines, they can only promise another superb event. Indeed, the Philippine Hobie Challenge is fast growing to be one of the most exciting and anticipated sailing events in Southeast Asia. ===Previous Challenges=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !title=\"Year\"| Challenge and Year !title=\"starting location\"| To !title=\"ending location\"| From |- | HC1 2000 | Lucena | Boracay |- | HC2 2001 | Maya Maya | Maricaban |- | HC3 2002 | Vigan | Subic Bay |- | HC4 2003 | Donsol, Sorsogon | Maricaban |- | HC5 2004 | Vigan | Club Paradise, Palawan |- | HC6 2005 | Malapascua Island, Cebu | Panglao Island |- | HC7 2006 | San Jose | Boracay |- | HC8 2007 | Hermana Major | Club Paradise |- | HC9 2008 | Sorsogon | Surigao |- | HC10 2010 | Laiya | Boracay |- | HC11 2011 | Lucena | Boracay |- | HC12 2012 | Coron, Palawan | El Nido, Palawan |- | HC13 2013 | Dawal Resort (Candelaria, Zambales) | Anvaya Cove Resort (Morong, Bataan) |- | HC14 2014 | Malapascua_Island, Cebu | Anhawan Resort (Oton, Iloilo) |- | HC15 2015 | La Luz resort, Laiya, Batangas | Canyon De Borocay Resort, Canyon Cove, Nasugbu |- |HC16 2016 |Mactan, Cebu |San Juan, Siquijor |} ==Past Winners== ===Past Challenge Series Winners=== PHC 1 2000 1st Mike Scantlebury (GBR) and Douglas Hansen-Luke (HKG), 2nd Tony Robinson (AUS) and Jill Novera / Carol Pablo / Gia Veloso (PHI), 3rd Mark Haswell (GBR) / Rex Puentespina (PHI) & Jill Novera (PHI) / Rannie Lavina (PHI).

A school destroyed by a Typhoon receives help from the Outreach program The Outreach Program provides the following aid to the beneficiaries: Renewable Energy Enterprises Foundation of Oakland, California (REEF) provides SOLAR LAMPS- The remote areas where the challenge ventures rarely have electricity and the outreach program provides solar lamps that provide up to 8 hours of lighting for children to study by. Since it can eliminate the use kerosene lamps, the solar lanterns improve family's indoor air quality. The result children are less often missing school, the lanterns save family's 30 % of their income, and provide evening light for families. The solar lanterns are free to families and last five years. EDUCATIONAL SUPPLIES- Giving children these materials will help them continue learning and reduce the cost to their parents. MEDICAL SUPPLIES- These contributions will greatly help community health centers to provide for basic health needs and first aid treatments. ==Hobie 16== File:Philippines hobie challenge hobie.jpg The 16 is the most popular Hobie Cat, both for recreational and racing purposes and as a one-design racer. The boat is 16'7\" long, 7'11\" wide, and has a mast 26'6\" tall, but only weighs 320 pounds. As with the 14, it is intended to be sailed from the beach through the surf, and to be surfed back in on the waves to the beach. Instead of daggerboards or centreboards, the 16 has asymmetrical hulls which act like foils and keep the boat from crabbing, or slipping sideways from the force of the wind. Both jib and main sails are fully battened and total . A trapeze is usually used by the crew and helmsman. While sailing a 16-foot boat offshore may sound fool hardy the Hobie 16 is the most ideal vessel for offshore sailing because its sail plan is low tech and allows the boat to be sailed up to 30 knots of wind by a person with reasonable skills while its strong hull and no centre board allows it to sail over shallow water and contact reefs with only very minor damage. ==Other Challenges== There are racing classes all around the world for a range of Hobie Sailboats. These include the Fiji Hobie Challenge which is an annual race held over a similar format and the Tanzacat Challenge and Zanzibar Raid held in Tanzania, East Africa. ==See also== * List of multihulls ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Endnotes=== ==External links== * Hobie Cat sailing models * Hobie Sailing * Hobie Class of North America * International Hobie Class * Category:Catamarans ",
