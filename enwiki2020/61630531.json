Tuition was initially set at $60 per year for the Collegiate Department. After holding classes at Ayer College for two years, it planned to relocate to Piedmont Mesa north of Pomona, but was instead offered the site of an unfinished hotel in Claremont, California, a few miles away. The trustees chose to accept the offer, and the college relocated there in 1889 but kept its name. The hotel building would eventually become Sumner Hall, the current location of the college's admissions office. The college\u2019s first graduating class, in 1894, had ten members. Pomona College founders\u2019 values led to the college\u2019s belief in educational equity. Like other Congregationalist-founded colleges such as Harvard, Dartmouth, Middlebury, and Bowdoin, Pomona received its own governing board, ensuring its independence. The board of trustees was originally composed of graduates of Williams, Dartmouth, Bates and Yale, among others. Pomona College went on to become the founding member of the Claremont Colleges consortium in the 1920s. Today, it is fully nonsectarian, and is widely considered the premier liberal arts college on the West Coast. == Marker== The marker on the site of Pomona College's first home The marker on the site reads: :On this site, September 12, 1888, was held the first session of Pomona College. 1937 by Historical Society of Pomona Valley.
