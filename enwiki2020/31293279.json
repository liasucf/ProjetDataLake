    "text": "Kongjian Yu (1963) is a Chinese ecological urbanist, urban planner and landscape architect, professor of landscape architecture at Peking University (PKU) and the founder of the planning and design office Turenscape in Beijing. ==Career== Kongjian Yu received his Doctor of Design Degree at The Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1995, with the dissertation, \"Security Patterns in Landscape Planning: With a Case in South China\" with Carl Steinitz, Richard Forman and Stephen Ervin as his advisors. He went back to China after worked as landscape planner and architect at SWA Group] in Laguna Beach for two years in 1997. He has been a professor of urban and regional planning at Peking University since 1997, is the founder and Dean of the Graduate School of Landscape Architecture at PKU, and is now at the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture. He founded Turenscape in 1998, an internationally awarded firm with about 600 professionals. Yu and Turenscape's practice covers architecture, landscape architecture, and urbanism across scales. Yu defines landscape architecture as the art of survival, and tries to protect and reconstruct ecological infrastructurehttp://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GHSI200106002.htm] as holistic nature-based solutions to provide ecosystems services for cities, and to define a new aesthetics, the \"big feet aethetic\" based on environmental ethic. His pioneering research on \"ecological security patterns\".Negative Planning and \"sponge cities\" have been adopted by the Chinese government as a guiding theory for national land use planning, eco-city campaign, and urban ecological restoration. A native of China's Zhejiang Province, his guiding design principles are the appreciation of the ordinary, such as rural agricultural landscapes, and a deep embracing of nature, even in its potentially destructive aspects, such as urban flooding. He is a designed ecologist and he practices design as scientific experiments. He got inspirations from his farming experience and the ancient wisdom of water and waste management to design and test a series of nature-based solutions, such as constructed wetland for water cleansing, green sponge for storm water management, ecosystems services oriented design for brown field remediation, etc. He has made these solutions to become replicable ecological engineering modules to be implemented at large scale to solve ecological problems, such as flood, draught, water and soil pollution and habitat rehibiliation,thorugh which landscape in deep form---as oppostite to shallow form or fake form\u2014can be created. Yu's ecological approach to urbanism has been implemented in over 200 cities in China and abroad. He has won numerous international awards for his ecologically and culturally sensitive projects, including 12 American Society of Landscape Architects Excellence and Honor Awards,ASLA Excellence and Honor Awards an ULI Global Award for Excellence in 2009, and 5 WAF Landscape of the year Awards at the World Architecture Festival (2009, 2010, 2011,2015 and 2017). === Published works === Yu has published over 20 books and 300 articles.
