    "text": "Transdev, formerly Veolia Transdev, is a French-based international private public transport operator, with operations in 20 countries as of March 2019. ==History== Lancashire United Wright Renown bodied Volvo B10BLE in Preston in May 2013 The group was formed by the merger of Veolia Transport and Transdev on 3 April 2011. Veolia Environnement and Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations (CDC) had 50% shareholdings. It was initially planned for the company to be sold by an initial public offering, potentially accompanied by a rebranding, within 12 months of the merger. On 6 December 2011 Veolia Environment, seeking to reduce debt and focus on its core businesses of water, waste and energy, announced a \u20ac5 bn divestment program over 2012/13 that would include a sale of its share in Veolia Transdev within two years. At the time of the announcement, Veolia Transdev declared its intention to concentrate on four main markets (France, the Netherlands, Germany, United States), to develop UK, Asia and Australia and to divest from other countries and other activities amounting to about 9-10% of global revenue in 2012/13. After this announcement, the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, for its part, officially reiterated its commitment to Veolia Transdev and its continued support as a shareholder to the group's development. In early 2012 it was reported that Cube Infrastructure, a fund controlled by the French bank Natixis (Groupe BPCE), was likely to acquire about half of Veolia's stake in Transdev. The Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts would take over the other half. This was later changed in October 2012 to Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts acquiring 10% of the shares from Veolia. This however was not implemented. Following the sale of Transdev subsidiary SNCM in late 2015, CDC and Veolia continued talks about selling Veolia's stake in the joint venture. In December 2016, CDC finally bought 20% shares from Veolia. As a result, Veolia's share became 30% while CDC's share became 70%. In October 2018, Veolia announced its intention to sell its remaining 30% shareholding to the Rethmann Group.Veolia to sell Transdev stake to Rethmann Group Metro Report International 2 October 2018 The transaction was completed in January 2019, with Rethmann increasing its shareholding to 34% by adding its Rhenus Veniro subsidiary to the Transdev portfolio.Veolia out of transport as Rethmann acquires Transdev stake Railway Gazette International 11 January 2019 ===Operational History=== At the time of merger, Transdev operated in the following 27 countries.
