They are sometimes given the name Muscida, which can also refer to \u03bf Ursae Majoris. The two stars, Pi\u00b9 and Pi\u00b2 together, are considered an optical double star. They are not a binary star, in that they are not gravitationally linked, but they are close to each other as seen in the sky, and so are optically associated.
