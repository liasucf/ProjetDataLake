For a time from 2006 to 2012, it broadcast a Regional Mexican format as La Maquina Musical 1060 (translates to The Musical Machine, possibly referring to a juke box). The station had been silent since March 23, 2012. On November 30, 2015, KRUZ changed its call sign to KJQS. On December 8, 2015, Cumulus Media surrendered KJQS' license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the FCC cancelled the license and deleted the KJQS call sign the same day. ==External links== Category:Regional Mexican radio stations in the United States JQS Category:Cumulus Media radio stations Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2015 Category:2015 disestablishments in Arkansas JQS JQS JQS ",
