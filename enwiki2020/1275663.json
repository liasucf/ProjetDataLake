    "text": "John Harden Allen (1847 - May 14, 1930)Michael Barkun, Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement, (1994), pg. 20. was an American minister. He was associated with the Church of God (Holiness), and is also heavily associated with British Israelism. He came from Illinois, later moving to Missouri in 1879. Originally a pastor in the Methodist Episcopal Church, he later became a pastor in the Wesleyan Methodist Church in California. He was one of the co-founders of the Church of God (Holiness) in 1883.Charles Edwin Jones, \"Anti-ordanance: A Proto-Pentecostal Phenomenon?\"* He \"evangelized throughout the West and eventually moved to Pasadena, California, where he died\".Barkun, pg. 20. Around 1917 he produced a publication entitled Stone Kingdom Herald.Jones, footnote 16. ==Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright ( 1902 )== Allen is best known for his book titled Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright, which many have claimed formed the foundation for the teachings on British-Israelism of Herbert W. Armstrong.Ambassador Report 15, March 31, 1981, \"Armstrong's Doctrines Unique?\"*Ralph G. Orr, \"How Anglo-Israelism Entered Seventh-day Churches of God a history of the doctrine from John Wilson to Joseph W. Tkach\", revised April 1999, Gavin Rumney, Ambassador Watch, \"Plagiarism, Flurry and Fraulein Kraus\", January 14, 2007, . While the works of Allen and Armstrong are by no means identical, with Allen's work being much earlier, much longer and in hard-back book format, the core of Allen's work does appear to have served as inspiration for Armstrong, and Allen's book was not unknown to Armstrong's students at Ambassador College. There are many similarities between the two works, and in some places they are nearly word-for-word the same.Armstrong Plagiarism Research ==Original 1902 review== Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright states that it is: \"An Analysis of the Prophecies of the Scriptures in regard to the Royal Family of Judah and the Many Nations of Israel, the Lost Ten Tribes.\" A review in the Baptist Messenger reported: :This is one of the most interesting volumes we have read in many a day and we confess that the arguments produced by Mr. Allen seem to be unanswerable. It is more thrilling than Western fiction. The description of the scarlet thread, the royal remnant, and the part played by Jeremiah in the preservation of the ruler for David's throne, will cause you to lose sleep rather than go to bed without knowing the outcome. ==Overview of publication== When this book first appeared, Britannia still ruled the waves and the sun was shining on the British Empire, which is why many came to believe that the British were \"God's People\" and an introduction to the book claimed that: :A notable and immensely significant sign of the times is the revival of interest in Old Testament prophecy that is beginning to be strongly felt in Anglo-Saxon countries. This book presents facts and considerations which everyone must sometime take into account, for they are destined to become important factors in world affairs. ===Contents=== Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright is divided into three parts: Part one addresses the claim that God made a promise to Abraham that his descendants would become many nations.
