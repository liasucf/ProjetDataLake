This failure is still fresh in his mind when he meets Abel who has become a scrap thief and plunders construction sites with a small band of hoodlums around Nanterre. Max plans to encourage them to commit something big and catch them on the spot. Posing as a client, he meets Lily (Romy Schneider), a young German-born prostitute who is the companion of Abel. He pretends to be the director of a small bank branch which receives significant amounts of money at regular intervals. He ensures the support of his police commissioner. Max fails however to reveal his role as instigator. Gradually, some feeling arises between Max and Lily. But Max keeps a reserved attitude and merely influences the scrap through her. Finally, guessing the band ready for action, he communicates an ideal date to commit robbery. On the scheduled day, the police await them and they are arrested. Later in the police station, Rosinsky (the top cop in the bank's district) reveals to Max that he wants all collaborators brought to justice, including Lily. Distraught, Max tries to save her and ends up threatening Rosinsky. In an argument, Max pulls out his gun and kills him. == Cast == Romy Schneider, during the filming in Issy-les-Moulineaux * Michel Piccoli as Max * Romy Schneider as Lily * Georges Wilson as Chief Inspector * Bernard Fresson as Abel Maresco * Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier as Rosinsky * Boby Lapointe as P'tit Lu * Michel Creton as Robert Saidani * Henri-Jacques Huet as Dromadaire * Jacques Canselier as Jean-Jean * Alain Grellier as Guy Laronget * Maurice Auzel as Tony * Philippe L\u00e9otard as Losfeld * Robert Favart as Loiselle * Dominique Zardi as Baraduch * Albert Augier as a client of Lily * Betty Beckers as Maria ==U.S. release== The film had its belated U.S. theatrical premiere in New York in August 2012. ==References== == External links == * Category:1971 films Category:1971 crime drama films Category:1970s psychological thriller films Category:Films about prostitution in France Category:Films directed by Claude Sautet Category:Films scored by Philippe Sarde Category:French crime drama films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:Italian films Category:Police detective films Category:French neo-noir films Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Loup Dabadie Category:1971 drama films ",
