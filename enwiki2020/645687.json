The band became prominent in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Mainland China, and Overseas Chinese communities.HKheadline.com. \"HKheadline.com.\" Beyond \u4e00\u4ee3\u6416\u6efe\u73ed\u9738. Retrieved on 27 December 2010. The band is widely considered as the most successful and influential Cantopop band from Hong Kong. In 1993, leader Wong Ka Kui, died at the age of 31 after an accident during the filming of a show at Fuji Television in Tokyo. Beyond continued to perform and record after Wong Ka Kui's death. In 2005, the remaining members Paul Wong, Wong Ka Keung and Yip Sai Wing decided to pursue their own solo careers, and Beyond officially disbanded. == History == === Early years === In the early 1980s, lead vocalist Wong Ka Kui and drummer Yip Sai Wing started out as young musicians and both had interests in Pink Floyd's progressive rock.Big5.china.com.cn. \"Big5.china.com.cn .\" Beyond. Retrieved on 27 December 2010. In 1983, they decided to join a music contest for \"Guitar magazine\" and they decided to form a band with lead guitarist William Tang (\u9127\u7152\u8b19) and bassist Lee Wing Chiu (\u674e\u69ae\u6f6e). Tang wished the band's name to convey a feeling of surpassing or going beyond themselves, so the name \"Beyond\" was chosen. However, the band name was not definite at the time. The band's musical style was still experimental. Wong Ka Kui and Tai Chi lead guitarist Joey Tang formed a temporary band called NASA band that did art rock style of music with English pop. In 1984, Wong's younger brother Wong Ka Keung joined the band as bassist. At the time, the band consisted of Wong Ka Kui, Yip Sai Wing, Wong Ka Keung and new lead guitarist Chan Sze On (\u9673\u6642\u5b89). Chan soon had to leave for a foreign country, leaving the band without lead guitarist. In 1985 Paul Wong joined the band to replace him. In the early years, time was difficult for the band. They had to do everything themselves, including organising its finance, selling tickets, performing and buying their own equipment. They rented out Caritas Hong Kong for a mini concert called \"Forever waiting concert\" and invited people. Not a single record company showed up, and the audience was indifferent to the band. Someone stepped in as their manager to help them raise HK$16,000, but the band was soon left with only HK$1000. In 1986, the band rented a studio to record the album Goodbye Ideal (\u518d\u898b\u7406\u60f3). Lau Chi Yuen (\u5289\u5fd7\u9060) then joined Beyond as lead guitarist and keyboardist. At the time Small island, Tat Ming Pair and Beyond made a recording together. Small island was scheduled to go to a July 1986 Pan-Asian Music Festival in Taipei, and Beyond was added to the schedule. Beyond was well liked and they joined another festival that same year. They would then sign with Kinn's Music record company. === Commercial success === In 1987, Beyond produced the second album. The album Arabian Dancing Girls (\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8df3\u821e\u5973\u90ce) was one of the band's first commercial hits. They soon were in a new music underground trend along with a few number of bands, such as Tai Chi, Cocos and Raidas. Lau Chi Yuen left the band in 1988, leaving the band with four members only. In 1989, Beyond became the first Hong Kong band to perform in Beijing at the Capital Indoor Stadium. Since Beyond's songs were in Cantonese (instead of Mandarin), the performance was not well received by the audience. Before the stadium was filled, half the people had already left. However, they still considered the concert a success. After a couple of flops, Beyond started to gain popularity following the release of the hit song \"Great Land\" (\u5927\u5730). They would soon win their first musical awards, the 1988 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation and 1989 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. In 1990, they released one of their signature songs, \"Glorious Years\" (\u5149\u8f1d\u6b72\u6708). The song was about racism and the struggle of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.Arts.cultural-china.com. \"Arts.cultural-china.com .\" Arts. Retrieved on 22 December 2010. The song was a huge hit, and had a fresh sound that stood out from the sea of love songs that dominated the Cantopop scene in Hong Kong. The song was from the band's album Party of Fate (\u547d\u904b\u6d3e\u5c0d), which sold extremely well, achieving triple platinum. In 1991, Beyond released another critically acclaimed song \"Amani\" from the album Hesitation (\u7336\u8c6b). The song was written during Beyond's trip to Tanzania.http://www.greenpeace.org. \"www.greenpeace.org.\" \u96cd\u5bb9 \u653f\u5e9c\u8207\u516c\u5171\u4e8b\u52d9\u4e3b\u4efb. Retrieved on 27 December 2010. As suggested by the title, which means \"peace\" in Swahili, the song is about the plight of war-ravaged Africa and the yearning for world peace. Part of the song's lyrics were written in Swahili. The song is still often used by Hong Kong's human rights bands to spread the message of peace. In the same year, Beyond made their first appearance on Japan's NHK station. They immediately signed with record company Amuse. Beyond started to become a more international band, and began to focus more time in Japan and Taiwan. The album Continue the Revolution (\u7e7c\u7e8c\u9769\u547d) achieved commercial and critical success. In May 1993, Beyond released the album Rock and Roll (\u6a02\u8207\u6012) which included the song \"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\" (\u6d77\u95ca\u5929\u7a7a). That song would become Wong Ka Kui's last song with the band. === Death of Wong Ka Kui === On 24 June 1993, Beyond appeared at a Tokyo Fuji Television game show Ucchan-nanchan no Yarunara Yaraneba (\u30a6\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30ca\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u306e\u3084\u308b\u306a\u3089\u3084\u3089\u306d\u3070!).

Retrieved on 27 December 2010. Wong was sent to the Tokyo Women's Medical University hospital. He fell into a coma and died one week later at aged 31. The death occurred at the prime of the band's career, with the tremendous success of the song \"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\" released around the time. His funeral procession caused traffic in various major streets in Hong Kong to come to a standstill, and many top Hong Kong Cantopop singers of the time attended and paid tribute at the funeral. Criticisms followed that the Japanese were having too many late night shows of this type, and the TV station crews were overworked. === Post Ka Kui era === There was debate as to whether the remaining three members should continue to record and perform as Beyond. Eventually, they reappeared on 30 November 1993 in Hong Kong at the Composer's Tribute Night concert.Beyondmusic.net. \"Beyondmusic.net .\" Beyond. Retrieved on 27 December 2010. In the new era their albums have a more alternative rock feel, unlike the progressive rock sound of previous albums. Beyond's first album in the post Ka Kui era was 2nd Floor Back Suite (\u4e8c\u6a13\u5f8c\u5ea7). In 1997 the album Please Let Go of Your Hands also made a reference to Hong Kong's cultural changes after the handover of Hong Kong to China.Music.douban.com. \"Music.douban.com.\" album review.

In 2003 for the band's 20th anniversary, they came out to embark on a world tour. The tour included stops in Toronto Canada, and various cities in mainland China. In 2005, they played their last tour (The Story Live 2005) under the name Beyond and announced their disbandment at their last stop in Singapore. For the first time in three years, the three remaining members of Beyond reunited to play \"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\" for the Wong Ka Kui Memorial Concert. The concert was organised by Wong Ka Keung as a birthday tribute to his brother 15 years after his death which featured covers of Ka Kui's songs by bands and artists such as Kolor, Tai Chi, Soler and at17. Yip Sai Wing and Paul Wong held a concert called \"Beyond Next Stage Live 2008\" on 11 Oct 2008 in Genting Highlands, Malaysia and later on 8 November 2008 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
