It was opened in 1795 during the reign of Selim III and continued functioning until 1928, until the opening of the High Engineering School (). It was formed as an important institution in the Nizam-I Cedid reforms and was formed with the expansion of the Imperial Naval Engineering School (M\u00fchendish\u00e2ne-i Bahr\u00ee-i H\u00fcm\u00e2yun), which had been the first modern engineering school of the Ottoman Empire and the only one to precede the Imperial School of Military Engineering. The location was chosen its Hask\u00f6y due to its remoteness at the time to prevent students, along with humbarac\u0131s and la\u011f\u0131mc\u0131s that were to be located adjacent to the school from coming into contact with the Janissaries in Constantinople. The construction work began on 14 July 1793 and ended in September 1795. The initial policy had been not to include any foreigners in the staff, which led to the four scholars, H\u00fcseyin R\u0131fk\u0131 Tamani, \u0130br\u00e2him K\u00e2mi, H\u00e2f\u0131z Seyyid \u0130br\u00e2him Edhem and Elhac H\u00e2f\u0131z Abdullah be the only ones to teach at the institution under Abdurrahman Efendi, a scholar of geometry and algebra until 1801, when a scholar of English origin was employed. Later, under head instructor (Ba\u015fhoca) Ishak Efendi, who was an 1815 graduate of the school and had been appointed the deputy principal of the then-principal H\u00fcseyin R\u0131fk\u0131 Tamani in 1816, and who oversaw the school between 1830 until his death in 1836, the school saw great improvement and an attempt to apply the curriculum of French schools of engineering. Despite its being a military school, civilians were also allowed to enroll. Selim III worked to provide all necessary facilities to the school, including the import of equipment from Europe and the establishment of a printing press. The school consisted of four years. In the first year, the students studied calligraphy, spelling, painting, Arabic, French, numbers and an introduction to geometry. In the second year, they studied arithmetic, advanced geometry, Arabic, French and geography. In the third year, they studied geography, planar trigonometry, algebra, surveying and military history. In the fourth year, they studied cross-sections of cones, differentiation, integration, mechanics, ballistics, astronomy, fortifications and shooting practice. The fourth year curriculum required knowledge of advanced mathematics. Mining as a part of the military (la\u011f\u0131mc\u0131l\u0131k), map drawing and artillery were among other areas studied. Istanbul Technical University, itself a successor of the High Engineering School, is a direct successor of the M\u00fchendish\u00e2ne-i Berr\u00ee-i. == References == Category:Istanbul Technical University Category:Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire Category:Education in the Ottoman Empire Category:1795 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Military education and training in the Ottoman Empire ",
