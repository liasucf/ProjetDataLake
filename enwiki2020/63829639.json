Its factory complex on Rolighedsvej in Frederiksberg was in the late 19th century the largest factory of its kind in Denmark as well as the largest employer of women. The factory was demolished in the 1940s and has now been replaced by Hostrups Have, a Functionalist housing estate arranged around a central greenspace. ==History== Kronprinsessegade 8 seen on J. H.

His father had established a calico printing workshop in 1780. Ruben was articled to his father and continued the business after his death on a new concession from 1810. He also moved into dyeing and treatment of textiles, introducing steam power in 1844.

The company had towards the end of the century grown to the largest textile company in the country as well as the largest employer of women. Ruben's son Bernhard Harald Ruben (1829\u201396) became a partner in the company in 1862 and continued it alone after his father's death. The factory was rebuilt after a fire in 1876. He expanded it with a bleaching plant in 1877. Bernhard Tuben's widow Ida Ruben (n\u00e9e Coppel, 1845\u20131913) continued the operations from 1896. It was in 1901 ceded to their son Carl Ruben (1876\u20131967). The company was in 1907 converted into a limited company under the name Nordisk Tekstil Aktieselskab. It was in 1918 sold to Fredericia-based Bloch & Andresen. The new owner closed the factory on Rolighedsvej in connection with a reconstruction in 1926. ==References== ==External links== * Source Category:Defunct textile companies of Denmark Category:Companies based in Frederiksberg Municipality Category:Danish companies established in 1810 ",
