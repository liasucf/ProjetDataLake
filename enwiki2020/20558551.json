VT 108 is long. ==Route description== \"End VT 108 Scenic\" assembly on VT 108 southbound south of Smugglers Notch VT 108 passes through the area of the Mount Mansfield State Forest. It starts in Stowe and goes through Smugglers' Notch to Jeffersonville. The road cuts through Mount Mansfield. The road is very steep and winding, making it impossible to plow in the winter, so the road is closed usually from late October until May. Tractor-trailers are barred from this section, though several trucks per year attempt traveling through the route and wind up gettting stuck.. Large straight trucks, buses and RVs are strongly encouraged to find other routes year-round. However, skiers come from alternate routes to cross-country, downhill ski, and snow mobile in the Smuggler's Notch Resort. Along the road, there are small parking areas where rock climbing and hiking are popular. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== 108 Category:Transportation in Franklin County, Vermont Category:Transportation in Lamoille County, Vermont ",
