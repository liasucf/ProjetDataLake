    "text": "Fran\u00e7oise Sagan (born Fran\u00e7oise Quoirez; 21 June 1935 \u2013 24 September 2004) was a French playwright, novelist, and screenwriter. Sagan was known for works with strong romantic themes involving wealthy and disillusioned bourgeois characters. Her best-known novel was her first \u2013 Bonjour Tristesse (1954) \u2013 which was written when she was a teenager. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Sagan was born on 21 June 1935 in Cajarc (Lot) and spent her early childhood in Lot, surrounded by animals, a passion that stayed with her throughout her life. Nicknamed 'Kiki', she was the youngest child of bourgeois parents \u2013 her father a company director, and her mother the daughter of landowners. Her family spent World War II (1939\u20131945) in the Dauphin\u00e9, then in the Vercors.Paris Match 2889 29 Sep 2004 Her paternal great-grandmother was Russian from Saint Petersburg. The family had a home in the prosperous 17th arrondissement of Paris, to which they returned after the war. Sagan was expelled from her first school, a convent, for \"lack of deep spirituality\". She was expelled from the Louise-de-Bettignies School because she had \"hanged a bust of Moli\u00e8re with a piece of string\". She obtained her baccalaur\u00e9at on the second attempt, at the cours Hattemer, and was admitted to the Sorbonne in the fall of 1952. She was an indifferent student, and did not graduate. The pseudonym \"Sagan\" was taken from a character () in Marcel Proust's \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time). Sagan's first novel, Bonjour Tristesse (Hello Sadness), was published in 1954, when she was 18 years old. It was an immediate international success. The novel concerns the life of a pleasure-driven 17-year-old named C\u00e9cile and her relationship with her boyfriend and her adulterous, playboy father. Sagan's characters, which became something of an icon for disillusioned teenagers, are in some ways similar to those of J.D. Salinger. During a literary career lasting until 1998, Sagan produced dozens of works, many of which have been filmed. She maintained the austere style of the French psychological novel even while the nouveau roman was in vogue. The conversations between her characters are often considered to contain existential undertones. In addition to novels, plays, and an autobiography, she wrote song lyrics and screenplays. In the 1960s, Sagan became more devoted to writing plays, which, though lauded for excellent dialogue, were only moderately successful. Afterward, she concentrated on her career as a novelist. ===Personal life=== Sagan was married twice. On 13 March 1958, she married her first husband, Guy Schoeller, an editor with Hachette, who was 20 years older than Sagan. The couple divorced in June, 1960. In 1962, she married Bob Westhoff, a young American playboy and would-be ceramicist. The couple divorced in 1963; their son Denis Westhoff was born in June 1962.Paris Match 2889 29 Sep 2004 She then had a long-term relationship with fashion stylist Peggy Roche. She also had a male lover, Bernard Frank, a married essayist obsessed with reading and eating. She added to her self- styled \"family\" by beginning a long-term affair with the French Playboy editor Annick Geille, after Geille approached Sagan for an article for her magazine.Campbell, Matthew, \"Lesbian love triangle stirs Paris literati\", The Sunday Times, 26 December 2007 Fond of traveling in the United States, she often was seen with Truman Capote and Ava Gardner. On 14 April 1957, while driving her Aston Martin sports car at speed, she was involved in an accident that left her in a coma for some time. She also loved driving her Jaguar automobile to Monte Carlo for gambling sessions. In the 1990s, Sagan was charged with and convicted of possession of cocaine. At various times of her life, Sagan was addicted to a number of drugs. She was a long-term user of prescription pills, amphetamines, cocaine, morphine, and alcohol. When the police came for an inspection of her house, her dog Banko showed cocaine to them, and also licked the cocaine. Sagan told the police, \"Look! He likes it too.\" In 2010, her son Denis established the Prix Fran\u00e7oise Sagan. ===Death=== Her health was reported to be poor in the 2000s. In 2002, she was unable to appear at a trial that convicted her of tax fraud in a case involving the former French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and she received a suspended sentence. Sagan died of a pulmonary embolism in Honfleur, Calvados on 24 September 2004 at the age of 69.\"French literary icon Sagan dies\", BBC, 25 September 2004 At her own request she was buried in Seuzac (Lot), close to her beloved birthplace, Cajarc. In his memorial statement, the French President Jacques Chirac said: \"With her death, France loses one of its most brilliant and sensitive writers \u2013 an eminent figure of our literary life.\" She wrote her own obituary for the Dictionary of Authors compiled by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garcin: \"Appeared in 1954 with a slender novel, Bonjour tristesse, which created a scandal worldwide. Her death, after a life and a body of work that were equally pleasant and botched, was a scandal only for herself.\" ==Film== Sagan's life was dramatized in a biographical film, Sagan, directed by Diane Kurys, released in France on 11 June 2008. The French actress Sylvie Testud played the title role. ==Works== ===Novels=== *Bonjour Tristesse (1954, (Hello Sadness), translated 1955) *Un certain sourire (1955, A Certain Smile, translated 1956) *Dans un mois, dans un an (1957, Those Without Shadows, translated by Frances Frenaye, 1957) *Aimez-vous Brahms?
