    "text": "Backstreet Records was an MCA Records subsidiary label founded in 1979 by Danny Bramson, who was executive director of MCA's Universal Amphitheatre. The name was derived from the Bruce Springsteen song \"Backstreets\". The label's first releases were Robbie Patton's Do You Wanna Tonight and the self-titled debut album by Tears in August 1979. The first major signing to the label was Tom Petty, ending a legal battle between Petty and MCA over his recording contract which was acquired when MCA purchased ABC Records. The label's roster of artists also included J.J. Cale, Keith Sykes, Nils Lofgren, Men Without Hats, and Walter Egan. The label's last release was in 1983, after which it was absorbed into MCA Records. Backstreet also released rock-oriented soundtrack albums to several films produced by its parent company Universal Studios, including Where the Buffalo Roam, Nighthawks, The Border, Cat People and Doctor Detroit. ==Partial discography== * 1979: Do You Wanna Tonight \u2013 Robbie Patton (MCA-3169) * 1979: Tears \u2013 Tears (MCA-3172) * 1979: Damn the Torpedoes \u2013 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (MCA-5105) * 1980: Where The Buffalo Roam soundtrack (MCA-5126) * 1981: Hard Promises \u2013 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (BSR-5160) * 1981: Nighthawks \u2013 Keith Emerson: Nighthawks soundtrack (BSR-5196) * 1981: Night Fades Away \u2013 Nils Lofgren (BSR-5251) * 1981: It Don't Hurt To Flirt\u2013 Keith Sykes (BSR-5277) * 1982: Counting the Beat \u2013 The Swingers (BSR-5328) * 1982: Long After Dark \u2013 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (BSR-5360) * 1982: The Border \u2013 Ry Cooder (BSR-6105) * 1982: Cat People soundtrack \u2013 Giorgio Moroder (BSR-6107) * 1983: Wild Exhibitions \u2013 Walter Egan (BSR-5400) * 1983: Wonderland \u2013 Nils Lofgren (BSR-5421) * 1983: Rhythm of Youth \u2013 Men Without Hats (BSR-5436) * 1983: Doctor Detroit soundtrack (BSR-6120) * 1983: Hardchoir \u2013 Hardchoir (BSR-39009) Category:American record labels Category:Rock and roll record labels Category:MCA Records Category:Record labels based in California ",
