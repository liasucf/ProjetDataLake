    "text": "In mathematics, a measurable space or Borel space is a basic object in measure theory. It consists of a set and a \u03c3-algebra, which defines the subsets that will be measured. == Definition == Consider a set X and a \u03c3-algebra \\mathcal A on X . Then the tuple (X, \\mathcal A) is called a measurable space. Note that in contrast to a measure space, no measure is needed for a measurable space. == Example == Look at the set : X= \\\\{1,2,3\\\\}. One possible \\sigma -algebra would be : \\mathcal A_1=\\\\{X, \\emptyset\\\\}. Then (X,\\mathcal A_1) is a measurable space. Another possible \\sigma-algebra would be the power set on X : : \\mathcal A_2= \\mathcal P(X). With this, a second measurable space on the set X is given by (X, \\mathcal A_2) . == Common measurable spaces == If X is finite or countable infinite, the \\sigma-algebra is most of the times the power set on X , so \\mathcal A= \\mathcal P(X) . This leads to the measurable space (X, \\mathcal P(X)) . If X is a topological space, the \\sigma-algebra is most commonly the Borel \\sigma -algebra \\mathcal B , so \\mathcal A= \\mathcal B(X) . This leads to the measurable space (X, \\mathcal B(X)) that is common for all topological spaces such as the real numbers \\R . == Ambiguity with Borel spaces == The term Borel space is used for different types of measurable spaces. It can refer to * any measurable space, so it is a synonym for a measurable space as defined above * a measurable space that is Borel isomorphic to a measurable subset of the real numbers (again with the Borel \\sigma -algebra) == References == Category:measure theory ",
