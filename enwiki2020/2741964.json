The station, which is hosted in the basement of Carnegie Mellon's University Center, is run by students, staff, faculty, and community members. WRCT broadcasts on 88.3 MHz with an ERP of 1.75 kW, from atop Warner Hall (also on the Carnegie Mellon campus, but heard throughout the city). The license is held by WRCT Radio Incorporated. == History == WRCT was born as an experimental radio station at then-Carnegie Institute of Technology. It began as the project of a group of engineering students in 1949, who first used the electrical wiring in a few academic buildings to broadcast a weak AM signal to campus buildings for several hours a day. In 1950, WRCT, which stands for Radio Carnegie Tech, covered half the buildings on campus, and became an official student organization.McCoy, Adrian. \"WYEP, WRCT plan anniversary specials.\" Post-Gazette.com. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 10 Apr. 2009. Web. 2 Feb. 2012. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09100/961838-67.stm. WRCT went on the air in 1949 as a carrier current AM radio station on 900 kHz (mostly heard on campus), but it moved to 88.3 FM on March 1, 1974, with a power of 10 watts, which extended its signal beyond the campus to other areas nearby. In the late 1980s, the power increased to 100 watts, and in 1994, WRCT received permission to increase power to 1,750 watts in the north, south, and west and 680 watts in the east, which enabled it to be heard up to 15 miles away, allowing it to become a more significant community service. Now the station has made it possible to listen anywhere in the world by streaming the audio on the station's website.Cullen, Rob. \"The Eclectic and Eccentric WRCT FM .\" Pittsburgh news for tech, arts, hiring \u2013 Pop City. Rob Cullen, 12 Nov. 2008. Web. 3 Feb. 2012. http://www.popcitymedia.com/features/wrct1112.aspx Now the station has expanded to serve beyond the campus, it also allows participation from outside the university. DJs, producers, engineers and staff consist of both community members, as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff who are connected to the school. Participation includes a range of skill levels, from freshmen DJs who are just learning about the stations' programming to veteran DJs who have years of experience on the air and a dedicated following. All of these positions are volunteer and nonprofit. For anyone to get involved, they must simply call the station or e-mail the training director. ==Programming== WRCT's programs, updated each semester, are available online at their program guide. ===Music=== WRCT's mission is to present its listening audience with freeform, original programming that cannot be found elsewhere on the Pittsburgh dial. As such, the station's musical programming is widely varied, and with few exceptions, left entirely to the tastes of the on-air DJs. Genres including Alt-Country, Jazz, Hip hop, Metal, Experimental, Indie rock, Blues, International, Electronic, and even Musical Theater are among those commonly represented in rotation. They try to show off local music that people do not typically hear on mainstream stations. They do their best to play \u201cCreative beats, conscious lyrics and fresh styles from up- and-comers who just plain aren't getting heard about because they don't fit the formula\u201d.Levy, Doug. \u201cOwen Carmichael.\u201d CMJ New Music Report, n.d. https://books.google.com/books?id=vrIO1R87sXIC&pg;=PA28&dq;=wrct+carnegie+mellon+radio&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=MDMrT5j9L8figgeIn- HxDw&ved;=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=wrct%20carnegie%20mellon%20radio&f;=false ===Public affairs=== WRCT broadcasts much more than just music. Public affairs programming also features prominently at the station, with an emphasis on news and issues local to the Pittsburgh community. WRCT is Pittsburgh's Pacifica Radio affiliate station.
