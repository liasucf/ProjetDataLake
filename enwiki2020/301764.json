    "text": "Jigglypuff ( ), known in Japan as , is a Pok\u00e9mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok\u00e9mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Jigglypuff first appeared in the video games Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Jigglypuff is voiced by Rachael Lillis in English and by Mika Kanai in Japanese. In the live action musical Pok\u00e9mon Live!, Jigglypuff is portrayed by Leah Smith. Jigglypuff is also very well known for singing a lullaby in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series. Known as the Balloon Pok\u00e9mon, Jigglypuff evolves from Igglybuff when it reaches a certain point of happiness, and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone. Its English name is a combination of the words \"jiggly\" and \"puff\", intended to relate to its jelly-like appearance. The character has been featured in a recurring role in the anime series and served as the focus for several printed adaptions of the franchise. Since it appeared in the Pok\u00e9mon series, Jigglypuff has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys and in the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game. ==Design and characteristics== Jigglypuff was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori, for the first-generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue. Its Japanese name \"Purin\", derives from the Japanese loanword for custard or pudding. Nintendo decided to give the various Pok\u00e9mon species \"clever and descriptive names\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Deciding to use a name better suited for its jelly-like appearance, the species was renamed \"Jigglypuff\", a combination of the words \"jiggly\" and \"puff\". When a Jigglypuff is exposed to a Moon Stone, it evolves into Wigglytuff. It has a pre-evolution, Igglybuff, which evolves when it reaches a certain point of happiness. Known as the Balloon Pok\u00e9mon, Jigglypuff is shaped like a round ball with pink skin, large blue or green eyes, animal ears, and a tuft of fur on its forehead. Its skin is rubbery and stretchy. It can inflate its body like a balloon (usually when it becomes angry; this is accompanied by a distinctive \"honk\" sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time.Pok\u00e9dex: If it inflates to SING a lullaby, it can perform longer and cause sure drowsiness in its audience. Pok\u00e9dex: It captivates foes with its huge, round eyes, then lulls them to sleep by singing a soothing melody. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep.Pok\u00e9dex: Jigglypuff's vocal cords can freely adjust the wavelength of its voice. This Pok\u00e9mon uses the ability to sing at precisely the right wavelength to make its foes most drowsy. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air.Pok\u00e9dex: When this Pok\u00e9mon sings, it never pauses to breathe. If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life. Game Freak's staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public's favorite Pok\u00e9mon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances. ==Appearances== ===In video games=== Jigglypuff first appears as one of the 151 species of Pok\u00e9mon in the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue Versions. When a Jigglypuff is exposed to a Moon Stone, it evolves into Wigglytuff. In Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, a pre-evolution, Igglybuff, was introduced, which evolves when it reaches a certain point of happiness. It later appeared in several sequels, including Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire, Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl, and Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Since Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, it is a dual Normal/Fairy type. Outside of the main series, Jigglypuff has appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Pinball, Pok\u00e9mon Snap, Pok\u00e9mon Conquest, the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon games, the Pok\u00e9mon Ranger games, and the Pok\u00e9mon Rumble games. Jigglypuff is a playable character in all five Super Smash Bros. games. It is the one of the two original representatives of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise in the Super Smash Bros. series along with Pikachu. Jigglypuffs are referred to as an \"it\" but the character can be either male or female. Despite not being a lead character in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, game director Masahiro Sakurai selected it to appear due to its similarities to Kirby, which allowed the staff to reuse the model and many animations as a base for Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff's moves in its Super Smash Bros. appearances are Sing, Rollout, Pound, and Rest. Rest's mechanics are changed entirely; instead of recovering Jigglypuff's health, the move launches foes that touch it. In addition to being one of only twelve characters to appear in all five games in the series, Jigglypuff is the only character that is unlockable in all five games except in the Wii U version of the fourth game. ===In anime=== In the Pok\u00e9mon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash and company. Unfortunately, most potential audiences fall asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff's singing can often prove problematic to the series' protagonists, as it causes all around to fall asleep. It carries around a trademark marker, which it uses as a microphone due to its resemblance to such when it is capped. When it realizes those who have been subject to its song have fallen asleep, it angrily uses the marker to draw on their faces. During Jigglypuff's first appearance (\"The Song of Jigglypuff\"), it was found standing on a stump. Misty tried to capture it with the help of her Staryu, but felt bad when the Jigglypuff started crying. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, Brock gave it a piece of fruit which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep. This upset Jigglypuff, which angrily dug into Ash's backpack and pulled out a marker which it used to draw on the faces of everyone who fell asleep. Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's Psyduck was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second (\"A Pok\u00e9-Block Party\"), a Whismur had heard the song for the first time and stayed awake due to its Soundproof ability, but on the second time it was tired and fell asleep. In \"Beach Blank-Out Blastoise\" Jigglypuff somehow got stuck inside one of Blastoise's hydro cannons but was later freed by Squirtle and Pikachu. In \"The Ancient Puzzle of Pok\u00e9mopolis\", Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic Pok\u00e9mon battling each other, but these two Pok\u00e9mon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle. In the Pok\u00e9mon short Pikachu's Exploration Club, Jigglypuff is parodied by a Marill, which, in the same fashion, puffs up angrily after putting its audience into sleep with its song. In Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when the Jigglypuff uses Sing, people are not affected in part because of Beedrill, whose beating wings are too loud. In 2006, Viz released ten DVDs based around individual Pok\u00e9mon in celebration of Pok\u00e9mon's 10th anniversary in the United States. The Pok\u00e9mon featured were determined by an online poll on pokemon.com.Make your Pok\u00e9mon a Star! pokemon.com.

The Jigglypuff in Magical Pok\u00e9mon Journey is spoiled and rich, living in a mansion with Wigglytuff and Squirtle, the former being her sister and the latter her butler. Jigglypuff's Magic Lullaby is part of the Pok\u00e9mon Tales series for very young children. Written by Megumi Hayashibara and illustrated by Kagemaru Himeno, it tells the story of a Jigglypuff who wants to make the other Pok\u00e9mon happy by singing for them. Yet, as usual, her song puts them to sleep, and this makes her very sad until her friend helps her resolve the situation. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, one of the main characters, Green, has a Jigglypuff which is capable of swelling up to several times its size. This allows Green to float with it like a hot-air balloon as well as block narrow passageways\u2014a tactic instrumental in helping Silver and her escape the Masked Man. It evolved in Breaking the Restraint into a Wigglytuff alongside two of Green's other Pok\u00e9mon with the power of her Moon Stones. ===In other media=== * Jigglypuff makes a cameo appearance in a season six episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, in which the host accidentally kills one while playing Pokemon GO. * Jigglypuff is one of the Pok\u00e9mon that appears in the Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu film, voiced using archived recordings of Rachael Lillis from the anime.

IGN. Retrieved on 2008-05-20 The book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pok\u00e9mon' described Jigglypuff as popular with a young, female audience across the franchise as a whole, attributing said popularity to both the immediate attraction of children to its pink color and its contrast to Pok\u00e9mon species more popular with young males, such as Squirtle or Charmander. The journal Sex Roles noted that while Jigglypuff's gender in the anime was never explicitly stated, it was identified by a majority of people as a female character in the series. Additionally, it was most often named female Pok\u00e9mon by children when asked to recall one, which the study attributed to its pink color and ability to sing its opponents to sleep. The Australian Journal of Language and Literacy cited Jigglypuff as a tool to use for introducing children to drama, citing its mannerisms in the anime. Jigglypuff ranked third on GameDaily's \"Pretty in Pink Video Game Characters\" article. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson listed the \"huggable pink blob\" type Pok\u00e9mon as one of the most overused Pok\u00e9mon designs, stating that it had a memorable run on the anime. IGN editor Lucas Thompson described it as a popular punching bag in the Super Smash Bros. series, but also has dedicated players who make good use of it in battle. Andrew Tei of Mania.com complained that Jigglypuff's portrayal in the anime quickly becomes irritating. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar disagreed, calling Jigglypuff's anime appearances \"totally badass\" while also criticizing its unoriginal, overused design. ==References== * ==External links== * Bulbapedia article about Jigglypuff * Jigglypuff on Pokemon.com Category:Fictional fairies and sprites Category:Pok\u00e9mon species Category:Singer characters in video games Category:Super Smash Bros. fighters Category:Video game characters introduced in 1996 Category:Video game secret characters Category:Video game mascots ca:L\u00ednia evolutiva d'Igglybuff#Jigglypuff cs:Seznam pok\u00e9mon\u016f (21-40)#Jigglypuff es:Anexo:Pok\u00e9mon de la primera generaci\u00f3n#Jigglypuff fr:Toudoudou et ses \u00e9volutions#Rondoudou pl:Lista Pok\u00e9mon\u00f3w (21-40)#Jigglypuff fi:Luettelo Pok\u00e9mon-lajeista (21\u201340)#Jigglypuff ",
