In 2005 the board hired its first paid director, Avenal McKinnon, who held the position until her resignation in 2014. During this time the permanent collection grew from six works to more than 200. In 2014, Gaelen Macdonald was appointed as McKinnon's successor. In 2017, Jaenine Parkinson took over the role of director. ==Location== The New Zealand Portrait Gallery's permanent home and exhibition space is in Shed 11, a heritage listed building located on Wellington's Queens Wharf. Shed 11 was built in 1904-5 and designed by William Ferguson, chief engineer of the Wellington Harbour Board. In 1985, Shed 11 was transformed into a gallery space and in 2010 the New Zealand Portrait Gallery secured a long term lease on the building. ==Collection== The New Zealand Portrait Gallery holds a collection of portraits featuring works by, and of, New Zealanders. In the collection are portraits of many influential and well- known identities including Sir Edmund Hillary, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Sir Peter Blake, and Janet Frame. In 2014, a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was commissioned for the gallery, and was painted by New Zealand artist Nick Cuthell in a live sitting. The portrait was unveiled by His Royal Highness Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, in a ceremony at Government House, and was subsequently hung at the gallery's home in Shed 11. ==Adam Portraiture Award== The New Zealand Portrait Gallery hosts the biennial Adam Portraiture Award competition, New Zealand's premier portrait prize. The first competition was held in 2000 as the National Portrait Competition, and since 2002 has been funded by the Adam Foundation. Since 2006, the winning entry has become part of the Gallery's permanent collection. ===Past winners=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |Year |Artist |Winning work |- |2000 |Sacha Lees |Sometimes an outline coloured in |- |2018 |Logan Moffat |Elam |- | 2016 ||Andre Bronnimann |Sisters |- | 2014 ||Henry Christian Slane |Tim |- | 2012 ||Stephen Martyn Welch |3 Nights, A Mirror & Loads Of Coffee |- | 2010 ||Harriet Bright |Kayte |- | 2008 ||Irene Ferguson |The Blue Girl (Johanna Sanders in her back yard) |- | 2006 ||Freeman White |Portrait of Hans |- | 2004 ||Ryuzo Nishida |Self Portrait |- | 2002 || Marianne Muggeridge |Meren and Josie |- | 2000 ||Marianne Muggeridge |Lucy in her Green Dress |} ==References== Category:Museums in Wellington City Category:Art museums established in 1990 Category:Art museums and galleries in New Zealand Category:Portrait galleries Category:New Zealand art awards Category:1990 establishments in New Zealand ",
