He has also written non- fiction text articles for magazines and books on pop culture, has recorded music under the name Paul Cast, is a documentary film producer, and the co- writer of an animated web series. ==Early life== Paul Castiglia was born February 7, 1966 in Passaic, New Jersey. ==Career== Paul Castiglia has been editor and writer on comic books including Archie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures and Sonic The Hedgehog. He wrote or co-wrote all 34 issues of Archie's Weird Mysteries/Archie's Mysteries and wrote stories for several issue of The New Little Archie Comics Digest Magazine. Castiglia had an editorial hand (billed variously as \"Americana Series Editor\", \"Assistant Editor\", and \"Compilation Editor\") in all 12 volumes of the Archie Americana Series including the final volume Best of the Nineties Book 2 which was released in 2011. In September, 2014 it was announced that Castiglia would be one of the leading editors and researchers on a new series of vintage reprint collections from Archie Comics called Archie's Favorites which began with the first volume, Archie's Favorite Christmas Comics in October, 2014. ===Comic books=== * Lead writer on Archie's Weird Mysteries comic book series * Contributing writer to Archie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures and Sonic the Hedgehog * Contributing writer to Looney Tunes Magazine and the DC Comics series Showcase. * Writer of Tex Avery Comics for Dark Horse * Co- creator and writer of Conservation Corps * Writer of Sophistikats appearing in Wild Life from Antarctic Press * Writer for Cracked Magazine * Guest-Writer for War Of the Independents from Red Anvil Press * Guest-Writer for KING! from Blacklist Studios As recounted in his introduction to The Love Showdown Collection (\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to San Diego\"), Castiglia conceived the idea of a storyline that would have Archie choose between Betty and Veronica \"once and for all\" as well as the denouement of the story in which Castiglia suggested the company revive Cheryl Blossom as the \"wild card\" character that Archie actually ends up with at story's end. The story, which ran in 1994 across four different Archie published comic book titles, was called the Love Showdown (Archie Comics). Castiglia promoted the storyline to mass media news outlets resulting in worldwide coverage. This made the \"Love Showdown\" the most notable and talked-about Archie Comics story of the 1990s. The company would not achieve the same level of publicity again until 14 years later with the Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty storyline created by Michael Uslan. ===Film and television projects=== Castiglia is an Executive Producer, Writer, Creative Consultant, Casting Producer and Music Supervisor on an upcoming documentary Bowery Rhapsody: the Rise and Redemption of Hollywood's Original Brat Pack.

Castiglia is the co-writer of the animated web series, Thomas & Friends Adventures which launched on YouTube in early 2017. The series takes the familiar Thomas train engine characters and puts them into fantastical stories where anything can happen.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6463508/?ref_=nm_knf_t2 ===Books=== Castiglia has written non-fiction text articles for magazines and books on pop culture, including a chapter in Midnight Marquee Actors Studios: Vincent Price.
