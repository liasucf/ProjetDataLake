With the support of the producer Gregorio Walerstein, Silvia made a change of image, highlighting her sex appeal, which helped her to be approved by De Cordova for the film. The film was filmed in Havana, Cuba and it was a remarkable blockbuster, which consecrates Pinal as the first figure in the cinema.Garc\u00eda Riera (1996), p. 65\u201366 Another director who knew how to make the most of Silvia's histrionic abilities was Alberto Gout.

In 1956, Pinal starred in the film Una cita de amor (1956), where she worked for the first and only time under the direction of the director Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez.

From the hand of Demicheli Silvia starred in Spain the musical film Charleston.

Pinal had her first contact with Bu\u00f1uel through Mexican actor Ernesto Alonso, with the firm intention of starring in the film version of the novel Tristana. However, the little commercial success of Bu\u00f1uel's films prevented the producers from financing the project, which ended up collapsing (Bu\u00f1uel filmed the film years later in Spain with Catherine Deneuve).Interview with Silvia Pinal: Viridiana Years later, Pinal, with the help of her second husband, producer Gustavo Alatriste, looked for Bu\u00f1uel in Spain and convinced him to film Viridiana (1961). This, without a doubt, is her most famous film. She was co-starred by Francisco Rabal and Fernando Rey, and was the winner of the Palme d'Or at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Despite the success and prestige enjoyed by the film, it was at the time, rejected by the Spanish censorship and the Vatican, accusing it of blasphemy. The Spanish government ordered its destruction. Through the intervention of Pinal, who fled with a copy to Mexico, the film was saved. Pinal (2015), p. 170 In Mexico, Vatican censorship had also resonated. However, with the help of Salvador Novo, the film premiered in some rooms. Her second film with Bu\u00f1uel was El \u00e1ngel exterminador (1962), which Pinal starred in with a choral cast. The film also received critical acclaim worldwide. In 2004, the New York Times recognized it among the best films of all time. Her third and last project with Bu\u00f1uel was Sim\u00f3n del desierto (1964). The film, misrepresented as a medium-length film, was originally conceived to be an episodic film. Pinal and Gustavo Alatriste looked for Federico Fellini to direct a second episode, but Fellini accepted with the condition that his wife, Giulietta Masina, starred in it. Jules Dassin was then sought, who likewise accepted on the condition that it was starred by his wife Melina Mercouri. Pinal also rejected this request. The idea was that Pinal starred in all the episodes of the film, so the project ended up filming only with Bu\u00f1uel.Interview with Silvia Pinal: Sim\u00f3n del desierto In the film Pinal also made the first nude appearance of her career, something still rare in Mexican cinema and also the first naked scenes of Bu\u00f1uel's cinema.Garc\u00eda Riera (1996), p. 108 Pinal was also on the verge of starring with Bu\u00f1uel in the film Diary of a Chambermaid, in France.
