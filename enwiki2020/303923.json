    "text": "James Mercer FRS (15 January 1883 \u2013 21 February 1932) was a mathematician, born in Bootle, close to Liverpool, England. He was educated at University of Manchester, and then University of Cambridge. He became a Fellow, saw active service at the Battle of Jutland in World War I and, after decades of ill health, died in London. He proved Mercer's theorem, which states that positive-definite kernels can be expressed as a dot product in a high- dimensional space. This theorem is the basis of the kernel trick (applied by Aizerman), which allows linear algorithms to be easily converted into non- linear algorithms. ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1932 deaths Category:19th-century British mathematicians Category:20th-century British mathematicians Category:Mathematical analysts Category:People from Bootle Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:Senior Wranglers Category:Scientists from Liverpool Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ",
