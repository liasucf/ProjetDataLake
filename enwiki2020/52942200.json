    "text": "Alf Hagon (born 3 October 1931 in Ilford, England) is a former motorcycle speedway rider who later competed in Grasstrack. He manufactured off-road competition frames, forks and other components, later developing into the production of shock absorbers, specialising in modern-replicas of the traditional Girlings used as original equipment and replacements for historic motorcycles. ==Competition background== Over a 12-year career in Speedway, he rode for six teams. In four consecutive years - 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964 - he rode for teams that ended their seasons at the bottom of the table.Bamford,R & Shailes,G (2007). \u201cThe Story of Oxford Speedway\u201d. He later found regular success when competing in Grasstrack. When riding in Grasstrack, Hagon started to develop a racing machine, with the assistance of Essex motorcycle dealer and competition sponsor Tom Kirby, creating a lightweight bike powered by a JAP engine. In 1958 he established a business building speedway and grasstrack bike frames in his mother's garden shed, but progress was interrupted in 1960 when he went on tour in Australia with the national England team. He represented England on four occasions. On his return, the business transferred to Leyton, East London. This proved successful with his bikes in good demand and he retired from racing in 1965 to concentrate on the business. However, Hagon had become involved in sprinting, appearing at the first International Dragfest in 1964,Motor Cycle, 9 September 1965, p.383. 2nd International Dragfest advert, Blackbushe 25/26 September, RAF Woodvale, 3 October, 1965.

A year ago the British Dragfest contingent managed to put it across the two visiting East Coast Americans, Don Hyland and Bill Wood \". Accessed 1 April 2017 on his lightweight JAP-engined bike. Hagon's approach to weight-reduction included a custom-made frame also containing the engine oil, his own grasstrack front forks and brake intended for lightweight category machines, dispensing with the gearbox and seat, and avoidance of a supercharger, resulting in a wet weight of . For the 1964 Dragfest, a competition against Americans who were using large capacity, double-engined machines \u2013 he fitted oversize pistons and cylinders to take advantage of a maximum engine-size dispensation by the ACU, raising the J.A.P. engine's capacity from 996 cc to 1,100 cc, and the power output from 84 bhp to 91 bhp, compared to a blown Vincent's 130 bhp.Motor Cycle, 27 August 1964, pp.458-459. One Gear Wonder Accessed 9 April 2017 In July 1967, riding a purpose-built sprint-bike powered by a supercharged V-Twin 1,260 cc JAP engine, he became the first rider to record a sub-10 second time with a one-way-only 9.93 performance at Duxford for the -mile distance. This was a strip-only record, as for official recognition of world and national records two qualifying runs have to be completed in opposite-directions within one-hour, to negate the effect of wind, with an average time resulting. In October 1967 he achieved an average time of 9.95 at Elvington, Yorkshire.'Sprinting', Motor Cycle Racing, Peter Carrick, 1970, Hamlyn, p.121. Accessed 30 March 2017 He followed that by setting a long-standing record of 9.432 at 153 mph at Santa Pod. In 1968 he became the first British rider to complete a flying mile at over 200 mph (206.54mph) at RAF Honington. ==Business developments== Hagon's base from 1960 was a former stable block in Leyton, London. Specialising in wheel-building and accident damage repairs, he purchased the former Girling suspension operation in 1985, including the stock, manufacturing tools and drawings. He did not purchase the rights to the Girling name, instead naming his products as simply Hagon.Shock absorbers for any bike. Classic and Motorcycle Mechanics, September 1992, pp.34-35.
