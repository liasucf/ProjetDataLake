    "text": "Osvaldo Costa de Lacerda (March 23, 1927 \u2013 July 18, 2011) was a Brazilian composer and professor of music. Lacerda is known for a Brazilian nationalist musical style that combines elements of Brazilian folk and popular music as well as twentieth-century art music, as exemplified in the works of his teacher M. Camargo Guarnieri (1907\u20131997).Carlos Eduardo Audi, \u201cOsvaldo Lacerda: His Importance to Brazilian Music and Elements of His Musical Style,\u201d PhD diss., (Florida State University, 2006), 30. His compositional output includes works for orchestra, choir, smaller vocal and instrumental ensembles, voice and piano, solo instrument and piano, solo piano, and other solo instruments.Gerard B\u00e9hague, \u201cLacerda, Osvaldo (Costa de),\u201d in Grove Music Online (Oxford University Press, 2001), https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.15771. He received several musical awards during his lifetime, including the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, and contributed significantly to the training of younger musicians in Brazil as a professor of composition and theory, member of various musical organizations and societies, and author of textbooks for theory, ear training, and notation.Audi, 11. == Biography == === Early Life and Musical Training === Lacerda was born in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1927 and remained there throughout his early years. He began his musical training with piano lessons from teacher Ana Veloso de Resende when he was nine years old, later studying piano with Jos\u00e9 Kliass, and he also started composing in his youth.Audi, 4. For the reference to Jos\u00e9 Kliass, see Maria Jos\u00e9 Bernardes Di Cavalcanti, \u201cBrazilian Nationalistic Elements in the \u201cBrasilianas\u201d of Osvaldo Lacerda,\u201d PhD diss., (Louisiana State University, 2006), 8. Between 1945 and 1947 Lacerda studied harmony and counterpoint with Ernesto Kierski and singing with Olga Urbany Ivanov (his mother was also a singer).Audi, 4. Clayton Juliano Rodrigues Miranda notes in his dissertation that piano and voice, the two instruments that the composer studied when he was young, would eventually become areas of compositional strength for Lacerda.Clayton Juliano Rodrigues Miranda, \u201cThe Inception of Trumpet Performance in Brazil and Four Selected Solos for Trumpet and Piano, Including Modern Performance Editions,\u201d PhD diss., (North Dakota State University, 2016), 51. Impetus to study composition seriously came when the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal String Quartet commissioned a work from Lacerda in 1952.Audi, 4\u20135. At this point, Lacerda began lessons with composer Camargo Guarnieri, with whom he would continue to study until 1962 and who helped popularize Lacerda\u2019s music through recitals.Audi, 5. Alongside his studies with Guarnieri, Lacerda also attended law school at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, graduating in 1961; after earning his degree he focused mainly on composition.Audi, 5. Lacerda also founded two artistic societies during this period: the Sociedade Paulista de Arte (1949\u20131955) and the Sociedade Pr\u00f3 M\u00fasica Brasileira (1961\u20131966).Maria Jos\u00e9 Bernardes Di Cavalcanti, \u201cBrazilian Nationalistic Elements in the \u201cBrasilianas\u201d of Osvaldo Lacerda,\u201d PhD diss., (Louisiana State University, 2006), 9.

In 1962, Lacerda received first prize in the Brazilian National Composition Competition in 1962 for his orchestral suite Piratininga.B\u00e9hague, Grove Music Online. In 1962 Lacerda received a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship and traveled to the U.S. to study with Vittorio Giannini in New York and Aaron Copland at Tanglewood.B\u00e9hague, Grove Music Online. In 1965 Lacerda participated in the Inter-American Composers Seminar at Indiana University and the Third Inter-American Music Festival in Washington, D.C., having been chosen as the country\u2019s representative for these events by the Brazilian Minister of International Relations.Di Cavalcanti, 8. Lacerda returned to Brazil after his American studies and festival participation, and from the late 1970s to early 1980s he also studied orchestration with conductor Roberto Schnorenberg.Audi, 6. === Later Life and Career === From the mid-1960s onward, Lacerda\u2019s career consisted of composing, teaching, writing music textbooks, and promoting the Brazilian national style in art music. He taught at the Escola Municipal de M\u00fasica de S\u00e3o Paulo from 1969 to 1992 (a government-funded school providing free instrumental and theory teaching), at Santa Marcelina College, and at several music conferences and festivals. He also assisted Guarnieri by giving new students preparatory lessons in counterpoint and harmony.Audi, 7. He became a member of the Academia Brasileira de M\u00fasica in 1972.Di Cavalcanti, 9. Lacerda married pianist Eud\u00f3xia de Barros (b. 1937) in 1981, and throughout her lifetime she has remained a strong supporter of the composer and his music.Clayton Juliano Rodrigues Miranda, \u201cThe Inception of Trumpet Performance in Brazil and Four Selected Solos for Trumpet and Piano, Including Modern Performance Editions,\u201d PhD diss., (North Dakota State University, 2016), 55. In 1984 Lacerda founded his third artistic society, the Centro de M\u00fasica Brasileira; this organization is still active today.Di Cavalcanti, 9. Date is from \"Centro de M\u00fasica Brasileira,\u201d Centro de M\u00fasica Brasileira, 2018, accessed 18 November 2018, http://centrodemusicabrasileira.blogspot.com. Lacerda also wrote four textbooks that are frequently used in Brazil and Portugal: Comp\u00eandio de Teoria Elementar da M\u00fasica, Exerc\u00edcios de Teoria Elementar da M\u00fasica, Curso Preparat\u00f3rio de Solfejo e Ditado Musical, and Regras de Grafia Musical.Miranda, 7. Lacerda continued to receive honors and awards throughout his mature years. The Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Paulista de Criticos de Arte awarded him \u201cBest Chamber Work\u201d and \u201cBest Symphonic Work\u201d for several pieces: Trio for Violin, Cello, and Piano (1970); Quatro pegas modais (1975); Apassionato, cantilena e tocata for viola and piano (1972); Concerto for Flute and String Orchestra (1981); Sonata for Oboe and Piano (1986); and Cromos for Piano and Orchestra (1994).Rubia C. Souza Santos, \u201cSelected Piano Trios By Brazilian Composers in the Succession of M. Camargo Guarnieri,\u201d PhD diss., (Arizona State University, 2004), 54. He was featured in festivals both in Brazil and the United States, including Sonidos de las Am\u00e9ricas in New York City (1996), the 31st Bar Harbor Music Festival in Maine (1997), and the Latin American Music Festival at Bard College (1999).Souza Santos, 54. == Compositional Style == The Brazilian nationalist musical style that Guarnieri imparted to Lacerda had roots in the writings of aesthetician Mario de Andrade and continued in the vein of composers such as Heitor Villa-Lobos and Francisco Mignone. Composers in this style brought together features of European art music and musical elements from Brazilian folk and popular music, which itself blends European, African, and indigenous musical heritages.David P. Appleby, The Music of Brazil, (Austin: The University of Texas Press, 1983), 145\u2013153. Guarneri taught that composers should absorb these folk sources so that they could naturally use and transform them in their own compositions.Di Cavalcanti, 9. This nationalist style can generally be described as neoclassical because it draws from the approaches to form, harmony, and melody of the classical Western tradition, combining these with Brazilian and contemporary European sources of inspiration.Di Cavalcanti, 7. In the 1950s, Guarnieri and other composers advocated for the continuation of this national style despite attempts of the M\u00fasica Viva movement, led by the German- Brazilian composer Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, to promote dodecaphonic composition in Brazil.Suzel Ana Reily, \u201cBrazil: Central and Southern Areas,\u201d in The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, vol. 2, South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, edited by Dale A. Olsen and Daniel E. Sheehy (New York: Garland, 1998), 306. One characteristic of Lacerda\u2019s music that reflects his focus on Brazilian traditions is his use of folk dance titles and musical features in many of his instrumental works. Examples of such pieces include his twelve Brasilianas (four-movement piano suites, composed 1965\u20131993)Di Cavalcanti, 11. and three pieces for oboe and piano, \u201cAboio,\u201d \u201cSegunda Valsa,\u201d and \u201cToada.\u201dKeri McCarthy, \u201cOboe Music Reviews: Osvaldo Lacerda,\u201d The Double Reed 36, no. 1 (January, 2013), 165\u2013166. He also set Brazilian children\u2019s music in some works; according to scholar of Brazilian music David Appleby, music for children or about childhood has historically been an important part of the Brazilian tradition.Appleby, 97. Lacerda\u2019s oboe and piano work \u201cVaria\u00e7\u00f5es sobre dois cantos infantis\u201d consists of variations on the children\u2019s songs \u201cCarneirinho, carneir\u00e3o\u201d and \u201cSapo Curur\u00fa.\u201dMcCarthy, 165\u2013166. In his vocal works, Lacerda set texts in Portuguese as well as some African languages spoken in Brazil. One piece written in a mixture of African languages is his choral work Oful\u00fa Lor\u00ear\u00ea: this work is based on a Candombl\u00e9 song that Guarnieri recorded in the state of Bahia, and influences from that Afro-Brazilian ritual tradition can be heard in Lacerda\u2019s treatment of polyphony and rhythm.Gustavo de S\u00e1, \u201cTwo Centuries of Brazilian Choral Music,\u201d liner notes for Saudade: Choral Music from Brazil, Kammerchor Apollini et Musis, Vinzenz Weissenburger, Rondeau Production ROP6049, 2011, compact disc, 12\u201316. In his dissertation, Carlos Audi provides a thorough list of \u201cnational elements\u201d in Lacerda\u2019s style that come from Brazilian folk and popular genres, including (but not limited to) use of modes, pentatonic scales, melodies with a narrow range, syncopations, ostinatos, and parallel thirds.Audi, 30. Apart from his interest in Brazilian folk and popular sources, Lacerda also took after his teacher Guarnieri in the latter\u2019s neoclassical use of traditional European forms, such as sonata form or theme and variations.Kristen Lia Smith, \u201cThe Influence of Folk and Popular Music on Twentieth-Century Flute Music of Brazil,\u201d PhD diss., (University of Cincinnati, 2000), 154. Like Guarnieri, Lacerda also drew from broader currents in twentieth-century Western art music, including contemporary techniques in areas of harmony, rhythm, and atonality.Di Cavalcanti, 10. Lacerda believed that it was important for nationalist composers to be open to new techniques so that their music could be a source of pride for their country.Marilia Gabriela do Nascimento Gimenes, \u201cOsvaldo Lacerda\u2019s Sonata for Flute and Piano (1959): a Performance Guide With Historical Background of Brazilian Genres Embolada, Seresta, and Bai\u00e3o,\u201d PhD diss., (University of North Texas, 2012), 12. == Works Lists == A list of Lacerda\u2019s works can be found in Gerard B\u00e9hague\u2019s entry on the composer in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart.Gerard B\u00e9hague, \u201cLacerda, Osvaldo (Costa de),\u201d in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, vol. 10, Personenteil Kem-Ler, edited by Friedrich Blume (Kassel: B\u00e4renreiter-Verlag, 2003), 964\u2013965.
