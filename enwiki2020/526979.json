Marker was created as a new municipality on 1 January 1964 following the merger of the two former municipalities of R\u00f8denes and \u00d8ymark.

Basmo Fortress lies on an isolated mountain outcrop between lakes R\u00f8denessj\u00f8en and Hemnessj\u00f8en in the northwestern part of the municipality. == General information == === Name === The Norse form of the name was Markir, which is the plural form of m\u01ebrk f 'woodland, borderland' (see > March). === Coat-of-arms === Marker's coat-of-arms dates from modern times, having been granted on 16 April 1982. The arms show two white-colored trunk-hooks on a blue background. They are a type of hook, normally on a long pole, used to drive tree trunks through the rivers. The main economic activity in the municipality is forestry, hence the use of the hooks. The two hooks also represent the two villages (and former municipalities) of R\u00f8denes and \u00d8ymark.
