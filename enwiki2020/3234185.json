He also competed three seasons in Portugal and represented Hearts in Scotland, during a 20-year career. ==Club career== ===Early years / Portugal=== Eskilsson was born in \u00d6stersund, J\u00e4mtland County. After starting in the lower leagues with local IFK \u00d6stersund, he moved in 1985 to the top division with IFK Norrk\u00f6ping, then competed in the 1988 season with fellow league side Hammarby IF. Eskilsson moved to Portugal at the age of 22, joining Sporting Clube de Portugal as an electoral asset of future president Jorge Gon\u00e7alves:Eskilsson; Estrelas Leoninas, 21 February 2007 during the better part of the following three seasons in the country \u2013 with a brief spell in his country with AIK Fotboll in betweenHans Eskilsson \u2013 Varen 1991 i AIK (Hans Eskilsson \u2013 Spring 1991 AIK) ; AIK Fotboll \u2013 he only scored three goals for as many teams, also representing S.C.

In early November 1995, after a short stint at Solna-based Vasalunds IF, he moved to Scotland to play for Heart of Midlothian in the Premier Division, being sparingly played during the season and being released as his contract was not renewed. Aged 30, Eskilsson joined Hammarby for a third spell in 1996, finding the side in the second tier and again helping it achieve promotion. He also began featuring regularly as a central defender, forming an efficient partnership with P\u00e9tur Marteinsson; late into his final stint, however, he suffered a severe leg injury after a two-footed challenge by Daniel Hoch in a derby game against AIK, having to retire from professional football. ==International career== Eskilsson gained eight caps for Sweden during two years, his debut coming in 1988. Also in that year, he played Olympic football in Seoul, appearing in two matches for the eventual quarter-finalists. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Sweden's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!
