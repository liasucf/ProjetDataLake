    "text": "The GAZ-55 () was a Soviet military ambulance developed in 1943 by Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ) and was used by the USSR during the Second World War. It was based on the GAZ-AA model. With only 9130 models ever being produced, the Red Army still relied heavily on standard trucks to transport their wounded. Production of this ambulance reportedly continued until 1946. No intact GAZ-55 ambulances currently exist today. One GAZ-55 was captured by a unit of the Luftwaffe. ==In popular culture== The GAZZ-55 is featured in the 1941 Russian film 'Frontovye podrugi' (The Girl from Leningrad). ==In video games== The GAZZ-55 is featured in the video game 'Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad'.https://www.igcd.net/vehicle.php?id=57113 == Gallery == image: Gazz-55-Frontovye-podrugi-1941-film.jpg|The Gazz-55 in the Russian film 'Frontovye podrugi'. image: GAZZ-55-Blueprint.gif| Blueprint for the GAZZ-55. == References == ",
