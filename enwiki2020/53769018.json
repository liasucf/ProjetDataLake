At 14:40:55 the crew of Il-14 contacted air traffic control and requested permission to climb to due to severe turbulence and cumulus clouds. Due to the An-12s at , the controller instead offered to grant permission for the flight to descend to , but the pilots of the Il-14 declined the offer because the turbulence may be worse at a lower altitude. At 14:50:17 the An-12 passed over Yukhnov and was switched to another controller and confirmed that they were at an altitude of . At 14:52 the two aircraft collided over Yukhnov.
