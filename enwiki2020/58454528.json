The municipality was centered around the Ris\u00f8ysundet strait. It encompassed the southern part of the island of And\u00f8ya and the northern part of the island of Hinn\u00f8ya in the southern part of what is now And\u00f8y Municipality. The administrative centre was the small village of Bj\u00f8rnskinn where Bj\u00f8rnskinn Church is located. The largest village in Bj\u00f8rnskinn was the village of Ris\u00f8yhamn. ==History== The municipality of Andenes was established on 1 January 1924 when Dverberg Municipality was divided into three: Andenes (population: 2,213) in the north, Bj\u00f8rnskinn (population: 1,410) in the south, and Dverberg (population: 1,477) in the central part of the old municipality.
