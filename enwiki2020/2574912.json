It was produced, engineered, and mixed by Dave Jerden.Liner notes, Dirt. 1992. In the liner notes of 1999's Music Bank box set collection, Jerry Cantrell said of the song: > I was thinking a lot about Andrew Wood at the time. We always had a great > time when we did hang out, much like Chris Cornell and I do. There was never > really a serious moment or conversation, it was all fun. Andy was a > hilarious guy, full of life and it was really sad to lose him. But I always > hate people who judge the decisions others make. So it was also directed > towards people who pass judgments.Liner notes, Music Bank box set. 1999. Reflecting on the song in a 2017 interview, Cantrell said: > A really significant thing for all of us - was kind of a heavier > foreshadowing of some things that would directly affect us and our friends - > was the death of Andy Wood. That song was me thinking about him like we all > did, and trying to put that down and just kind of write a little ode for > him. Because he wasn't there, and everything was taking off... It was a nice > thing to be able to use that song, it was very poignant I thought, because > we kind of carried him with us. ==Release and reception== \u201cWould?\u201d was released as a single in 1992, coinciding with the release of the movie Singles.
