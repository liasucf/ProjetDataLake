    "text": "Mrs Dalloway is a 1997 British drama film, a co-production by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands, directed by Marleen Gorris and stars Vanessa Redgrave, Natascha McElhone and Michael Kitchen. Based on the 1925 novel by Virginia Woolf, and moving continually between the present and the past that is in the characters' heads, it covers a day in the life of Mrs Dalloway, wife of a prosperous politician in London. ==Plot== On a beautiful morning in 1923, Clarissa Dalloway sets out from her large house in Westminster to choose the flowers for a party she is holding that evening. Her teenage daughter Elizabeth is unsympathetic, preferring the company of the evangelical Miss Kilman. A passionate old suitor, Peter Walsh, turns up and does not disguise the mess he has made of his career and his love life. For Clarissa this confirms her choice in preferring the unexciting but affectionate and dependable Richard Dalloway. At her party Sally turns up, who was her closest friend, so close they kissed on the lips, but is now wife of a self-made millionaire and mother of five. Intercut with Clarissa's present and past is the story of another couple. Septimus was a decorated officer in the First World War but is now collapsing under the strain of delayed shell-shock, in which he is paralysed by horrific flashbacks and consumed with guilt over the death of his closest comrade. His wife Rezia tries to get him psychiatric help but the doctors she consults are little use: when one commits him to a mental hospital, he jumps from a window to his death. The doctor turns up late at Clarissa's party, apologising because he had to attend to a patient's suicide. Clarissa stands by a window and ponders what it would mean to jump. ==Partial cast== * Vanessa Redgrave \u2013 Mrs Clarissa Dalloway * Natascha McElhone \u2013 Young Clarissa * Michael Kitchen \u2013 Peter Walsh * Alan Cox \u2013 Young Peter * Sarah Badel \u2013 Lady Rosseter * Lena Headey \u2013 Young Sally * John Standing \u2013 Richard Dalloway * Robert Portal \u2013 Young Richard * Oliver Ford Davies \u2013 Hugh Whitbread * Hal Cruttenden \u2013 Young Hugh * Rupert Graves \u2013 Septimus Warren Smith * Amelia Bullmore \u2013 Rezia Warren Smith * Margaret Tyzack \u2013 Lady Bruton * Robert Hardy \u2013 Sir William Bradshaw * Richenda Carey \u2013 Lady Bradshaw * Katie Carr \u2013 Elizabeth Dalloway * Selina Cadell \u2013 Miss Kilman * Amanda Drew \u2013 Lucy * Phyllis Calvert \u2013 Aunt Helena ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1997 films Category:1990s historical drama films Category:British films Category:British historical drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Marleen Gorris Category:Films set in London Category:Virginia Woolf in performing arts Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Suicide in film Category:Films about post-traumatic stress disorder Category:British LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films ",
