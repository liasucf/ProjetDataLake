The Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR was preceded by the All-Uzbek Congress of Soviets which operated from 1925 to 1938. After the independence of Uzbekistan in 1991, the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR was briefly succeeded by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan from 1991 to 1994. Until 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR was a rubber stamp legislature like all other supreme soviets of the union republics of the Soviet Union. The 1990 Uzbek Supreme Soviet election was the first and final supreme soviet election which allowed for multiparty elections. == History == The Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR was established pursuant to constitutional reforms within the Uzbek SSR, which changed the organization of main political organs of the republic. In theory, the Supreme Soviet was to be a legislative body that exercised power over the legislative branch of the Uzbek SSR. In reality, the Supreme Soviet's power was limited to approving decisions made by the Communist Party of Uzbekistan. When Uzbekistan achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the name of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR was changed to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan replaced the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan in February of 1995. == Convocations == Over the 53 years of its existence, the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR had a total of twelve convocations. The 12th and final convocation consisted of 500 deputies, which elected Islam Karimov as the President of the Uzbek SSR in 1990 and declared Uzbekistan's independence on August 31, 1991. * 1st Convocation (1938-1946) * 2nd Convocation (1947-1950) * 3rd Convocation (1951-1954) * 4th Convocation (1955-1959) * 5th Convocation (1959-1962) * 6th Convocation (1963-1966) * 7th Convocation (1967-1970) * 8th Convocation (1971-1974) * 9th Convocation (1975-1979) * 10th Convocation (1980-1984) * 11th Convocation (1985-1989) * 12th Convocation (1990-1991) == Chairmen of the Supreme Soviet == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! !Picture ! width=\"150\" |Name ! width=\"150\" |Took office ! width=\"150\" |Left office ! width=\"150\" |Political party |- ! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |Chairmen of the Supreme Soviet |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |1 |109x109px |Usman Yusupov (1901-1966) |17 July 1938 |21 July 1938 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |2 |109x109px |Abdurazak Mavlyanov (1908-1975) |_ |_ |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |3 |109x109px |Nuritdin Mukhitdinov (1917-2008) |_ |_ |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |4 |109x109px |Arif Khakimov (1912-1982) |1956 |1958 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |5 |109x109px |Rasul Gulamov (1911-?) |1959 |30 May 1961 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |6 |109x109px |Mirzamahmud Musakhanov (1912-1995) |30 May 1961 |22 March 1963 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |7 |109x109px |Abid Sadykov (1913-1987) |_ |_ |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |8 |109x109px |Sagdy Sirzahdinov (1920-1989) |1967 |1980 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |9 |109x109px |Asadilla Khodjaev (1920-1983) |14 March 1980 |6 September 1983 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |10 |109x109px |Erkin Yusupov (1929-2003) |30 December 1983 |30 March 1985 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |11 |109x109px |Pulat Khabibullaev (1936-2010) |30 March 1985 |9 April 1988 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |12 |109x109px |Rasul Gulamov (1911-?) |9 April 1988 |24 March 1990 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |13 |109x109px |Mirzaolim Ibragimov (?-?) |_ |_ |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |14 |109x109px |Shavkat Yuldashev (born 1943) |_ |1991 |CPSU |} == Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! !Picture ! width=\"150\" |Name ! width=\"150\" |Took office ! width=\"150\" |Left office ! width=\"150\" |Political party |- ! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |1 |109x109px |Yuldash Akhunbabaev (1885-1943) |21 July 1938 |28 February 1943 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |2 |109x109px |Abduvali Muminov (1902-1965) |22 March 1943 |17 March 1947 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |3 |109x109px |Amin Niyazov (1903-1973) |17 March 1947 |21 August 1950 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |4 |109x109px |Sharof Rashidov (1917-1983) |21 August 1950 |24 March 1959 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |5 |109x109px |Yodgor Nasriddinova (1920-2006) |24 March 1959 |25 September 1970 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |6 |109x109px |Nazar Matchanov (1923-2010) |25 September 1970 |20 December 1978 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |7 |109x109px |Inomjon Usmonxo\u2018jayev (1930-2017) |22 December 1978 |20 December 1983 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |8 |109x109px |Akil Salimov (1928-2014) |20 December 1983 |9 December 1986 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |9 |109x109px |Rafik Nishanov (born 1926) |9 December 1986 |9 April 1988 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |10 |109x109px |Pulat Khabibullaev (1936-2010) |9 April 1988 |6 March 1989 |CPSU |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |11 |109x109px |Mirzaolim Ibragimov (?-?) |6 March 1989 |24 March 1990 |CPSU |} == See also == * Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union * Supreme Soviet * Uzbek SSR == References == Category:Historical legislatures Category:1938 establishments in Uzbekistan Category:1991 disestablishments in Uzbekistan Category:Government of the Soviet Union Category:Government of Uzbekistan Category:Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic Category:Defunct unicameral legislatures ",
