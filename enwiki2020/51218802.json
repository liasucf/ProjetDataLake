Launched on 6 June 2003, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on the 300th launch of a Proton family rocket, AMC-9 is a hybrid C-band/Ku-band satellite located at 83\u00b0 West, covering the United States and Mexico.

On 17 June 2017 at approximately 07:10 UTC, AMC-9 experienced an anomaly on-orbit, the operator lost control and contact with the satellite, and it appeared to begin breaking apart.
