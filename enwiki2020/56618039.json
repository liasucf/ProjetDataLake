    "text": "Commitment to Complications is the second studio album by American electro- industrial duo Youth Code, released on April 8, 2016 through Dais Records. The album was produced by Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly. \"Anagnorisis\" was released as a 7-inch single in 2015 with the B-side \"Shift of Dismay\". ==Background and composition== Following two tours opening for Skinny Puppy, Youth Code returned to the studio to begin their sophomore album. Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly, another band Youth Code opened for, was brought in to produce the album. About the refinement of their music, Ryan George said: ==Critical reception== Commitment to Complications was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung saw the album as a refinement of Youth Code's sound, saying, \"Commitment to Complications demonstrates clear growth from the former hardcore kids, establishing Youth Code as a distinctive duo instead of merely a derivative tribute to their influences.\" Andy O'Connor of Pitchfork wrote that the album \"strikes the ideal balance between the visceral nature of the innovative L.A. hardcore group Youth Code's demo and the polish in their work since then.\" In his review of Commitment to Complications, Hans Rollman of PopMatters commended Youth Code for reinvigorating industrial and electronic music, saying the band is undoubtedly worth following. ==Track listing== All songs written by Sara Taylor and Ryan George. ==Personnel== Youth Code * Sara Taylor \u2013 vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, sampling * Ryan George \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers, sampling, backing vocals Additional personnel * Rhys Fulber \u2013 production, mixing * Josh Bonati \u2013 mixing * Ben Falgoust \u2013 vocals (3) * Todd Jones \u2013 guitars (10) ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Youth Code albums Category:Albums produced by Rhys Fulber ",
