The American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China (AmCham China) is a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization whose membership compromises 4,000 individuals from 900 companies operating across China. The chamber's mission is to help American companies succeed in China through advocacy, information, networking and business support services. The chamber provides information, networking opportunities, business support services, and advocacy to promote a mutually beneficial bilateral business environment for the United States and China. AmCham China is the only officially recognized chamber of commerce representing American businesses in Mainland China. AmCham China has more than 50 industry- and issue-specific forums and committees. These working groups serve as a platform for the American business community and other organizations in China to foster understanding, share information, pursue common interests, promote trade and investment, and strengthen cooperation. AmCham China's headquarters are located in Beijing. In addition to a Tianjin Chapter, it has a Central China Chapter based in Wuhan and a Northeast China Chapter with offices in Dalian and Shenyang. ==History== The first American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing (then Peking) was established in 1919, with eight founding member companies, including Standard Oil. The organization disbanded when war broke out, and the chamber did not reform until 1981. AmCham China was formally registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1991. As a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the business success of its members, AmCham China is not affiliated with any branch of government. ==Structure== AmCham China is a member-led organization rooted in the vision, hard work, and dedication of its members, many of whom are leaders within their companies and the business community. Currently, its national level operations are guided by the Chairperson, three Vice-Chairpersons, and 10 governors who comprise the organization's Board of Governors. All voting members of AmCham China are eligible to participate in an annual election to select the Board. Additionally, members of three AmCham China Chapters from around the country (Wuhan for Central China, Dalian for Northeast China, Tianjin, and Shenyang) each have their own local executive committee. These executive committees ensure that every Chapter is responsive to the needs of local AmCham China members. ===Board of Governors=== The Board of Governors consists of 14 voting individuals: the Chairperson, three Vice-Chairpersons, and 10 governors. The Treasurer, the General Counsel, the President, the most recent former Chairperson of the Board of Governors, and the Chairperson of the Executive Committee of any Chapter serve as non-voting ex-officio members. The Board of Governors is responsible for overseeing and making policy decisions for AmCham China. It meets to discuss ongoing matters of the chamber at least six times per year. The Board also selects and appoints the President to supervise and direct all employees of the Chamber. ====Chairperson==== The Chairperson must be a citizen of the United States and have a record of active participation in the Board of Governors, a Chamber committee, or a Chamber forum within the two years prior the election. The Chairperson is eligible for two one-year terms, but it is possible for former Chairpersons to run again for additional non-consecutive terms. At the end of one's term, the former Chairperson may continue serving as a non-voting ex-officio member of the Board unless otherwise elected as a regular Board member. In addition to playing a general supervisory role in AmCham China's organizational development, the Chairperson presides over all Board of Governors meetings, executes the decisions of the Board of Governors, appoints the head of each committee and forum, and represents the chamber in external relations. The Chairperson also appoints the Treasurer and General Counsel of the Board of Governors. 300x300px ==List of Past Chairpersons== *2016\u2013present William \"Bill Zarit\" *2015-2016 James Zimmerman *2013-2014 Greg Gilligan *2011-2012 Ted Dean *2009-2010 John D.

Building on the history of aviation cooperation that began in the 1970s, the US-China Aviation Cooperation Program (ACP) promotes continued industry-wide collaboration between China and the United States. Formally founded in 2004, the government- industry partnership streamlined American companies\u2019 interactions with the CAAC. Each year, ACP programs millions of dollars of assistance with help from ACP's 36 U.S. member companies. This work is a win-win for both countries, with aviation playing an important and growing role in the overall U.S.-China economic relationship. There also are other bilateral aviation agreements\u2014U.S.-China Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement, Bilateral Air Services Agreement; and Airworthiness, and Flight Standards Dialogues that provide the framework and standards to support the work of ACP's respective industries. Its flagship publication is a quarterly magazine called Partnership. ACP is endorsed by both the US and Chinese governments, drawing from the partnership of six public members and 36 corporate members. ==US- China Healthcare Cooperation Program== The U.S. \u2013 China Healthcare Cooperation Program (HCP) is a collaborative initiative, founded in 2011, based on a joint public-private partnership in healthcare announcement, striving to build closer working relations between the U.S. and China governments while leveraging healthcare industry strengths in order to foster long-term cooperation with China in the areas of technology, public health, policy research, training, and R&D;, and to support the Chinese government's goal of enhancing patient access to healthcare services in China.

Its focus is information-sharing, collaboration, and policy recommendations for US-China high-tech trade. ==US-China Agriculture & Food Partnership== The U.S. - China Agriculture & Food Partnership seeks to resolve problems and create opportunities for the improved coordination and development of the U.S. - China food and agriculture industries. Since 2013, it has linked the public, private, and NGO sectors to promote food security, safety, and sustainability. The U.S. - China connection is the indispensable relationship of the 21st Century \u2013 and food and agricultural trade is a key strategic pillar of the overall bilateral economic partnership. U.S. and Chinese agriculture and food linkages are expected to deepen further because of tremendous potential synergies driven by different endowments of land, labor and capital. To be sure, the relationship has yet to reach its fullest potential. The overall agricultural trading relationship is robust and has tremendous growth potential. However, continuing trade frictions, the influence of non- agricultural issues, and perhaps underdeveloped links between the U.S. and Chinese agriculture and food industries have all diminished what should be a fully positive and mutually beneficial relationship. However, with the continuing emergence of China's middle class, persistent concerns about food prices, and the development of competitive food and agricultural firms on both sides of the Pacific, there is tremendous potential for further trade, investment and cooperation. The U.S. - China Agriculture & Food Partnership focuses specifically on changing both the tone and substance of the bilateral relationship. By resolving problems and creating opportunities through increased coordination, more effective issue advocacy and the development of a more positive relationship between the U.S. and Chinese food and agriculture industries. The organization also serves as a platform to connect business with relevant government entities in a more coherent way and builds upon themes of food safety, food security and sustainable agriculture. ==Business Visa Program== AmCham China\u2019s Business Visa Program was designed with the US Embassy to facilitate quick and convenient visa processing for the Chinese employees of qualified member companies. Although US Embassy officials ultimately decide whether or not applicants secure visas to the United States, this service speeds up the process. ==AmCham China Business Center== The AmCham China Business Center was launched in 2014 as a one-stop resource for people considering doing business in China. It offers a news bureau, industry reports, and business analysis pertinent to specific sectors. A service directory enables research into potential partners. Visitors to the website can also ask questions to a long-time business expert affiliated with AmCham China. ==References== China Category:Business organizations based in China ",
