    "text": "Andrew Alexander \"Mike\" Terry (July 18, 1940 \u2013 October 30, 2008) was an American saxophonist, songwriter, arranger, producer and musical director. His baritone sax solos feature on the breakthrough hits of Martha and the Vandellas (\"Heat Wave\", 1963), and The Supremes (\"Where Did Our Love Go\", 1964). As a member of the Funk Brothers he performed on thousands of Motown recordings from 1960-1967, including at least seven US #1 hits. As was Motown's policy at the time, none of the studio musicians were credited by name. Terry was the musical arranger of the 1966 hit \"Cool Jerk\" by The Capitols, and later became a record producer, with partners including George Clinton, Sidney Barnes, and Jack Ashford. == Early life== Terry was born in Hempstead, Texas, a suburb of Houston, where his father ran a music store. His mother also played piano, and when he was 8 the family moved to Detroit, Michigan. At Cass Technical High School he took up the baritone saxophone, and also met future Motown trombonist/arranger Paul Riser. Terry\u2019s early musical influences included saxophonists Charlie Parker, Illinois Jacquet, King Curtis, and Bill Doggett. == Career== By the late 1950s, as a teen, Terry joined the group Popcorn and the Mohawks, which included future Motown staff musicians and producers Popcorn Wylie, Eddie Willis, James Jamerson, Lamont Dozier, and Norman Whitfield. The group recorded for Motown Records founder Berry Gordy with their first single, 1959's \"Custer's Last Man/Shimmy Gully\". By 1960 Terry was a member of the Joe Hunter Band with Benny Benjamin, James Jamerson, Larry Veeder, and Hank Cosby, forming the basis of the ever-growing group of studio musicians contracted to Motown. Terry played in the horn section on Motown's first million-selling single, 1960's \"Shop Around\" by The Miracles. In 1961 he toured in Jackie Wilson's backing band, and in 1962 toured in Motown's first Motortown Revue, performing on the album Motor Town Revue Vol. 1: Recorded Live At The Apollo. Terry also played on John Lee Hooker's 1962 single \"Boom Boom\", on Vee-Jay Records. In 1963 his baritone saxophone solos and instrumental interludes were featured on hit Motown productions by Holland/Dozier/Holland including Martha and the Vandellas' breakthrough hit \"Heat Wave\" and Mary Wells' \"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\". In 1964 he soloed on the Supremes' breakthrough hit \"Where Did Our Love Go\", and their follow up \"Baby Love\". As a member of the group of studio musicians known as the Funk Brothers, he made thousands of recordings, usually in the horn section, with tenor saxophonist Hank Cosby. Motown's practice at the time was to not credit the names of the studio musicians. Jason Ankeny of Allmusic.com wrote: Funk Brother, James Jamerson called him \"Lil' Funk\", (bandleader Earl Van Dyke was nicknamed \"Big Funk\"). Frustrated with a lack of opportunities to arrange or produce records at Motown, by the mid-1960s Terry enrolled at the Detroit Institute of Performing Arts to further his musical studies. In 1966 he was the credited arranger and conductor of US#7 hit \"Cool Jerk\" by The Capitols, secretly recorded with the Funk Brothers for the Karen Records label. By 1966 he and fellow Funk Brother Jack Ashford were planning a future collaboration as songwriters and producers, after playing sessions together for Ed Wingate at Golden World Records. In the mid-60s Terry worked with Wingate at Ric-Tic Records recording Edwin Starr, J. J. Barnes, Rose Batiste, and other artists. In 1966 Terry joined with George Clinton and Sidney Barnes to form the Geo-Si-Mik production team. Geo-Si-Mik produced records by acts including Clinton's group The Parliaments, Laura Lee, and The Adorables. Also in 1966 Terry and Ashford formed Pied Piper Productions, writing, arranging, and producing records by acts including September Jones, Nancy Wilcox, Lorraine Chandler, Mikki Farrow, and Willie Kendrick. In 1967 Terry left Motown and played on various soul recordings in Philadelphia and Chicago. In December 1967 he became a staff arranger and producer for Epic Records, and the Okeh Records imprint, where he worked on records by artists including Johnny Robinson, Sandra Phillips, The Little Foxes, and Maxine Brown. From the late 1960s to the late 1970s he arranged or produced or worked as a musical director in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, and Las Vegas. He was the arranger and orchestrator for the 1969 Broadway musical Buck White, featuring Muhammad Ali, and for Bill Cosby in Las Vegas. He also worked closely with Jo Armstead at both Giant Records, and Bill Cosby\u2019s label Tetragrammaton Records. In 1975 he was a member of the Atlanta Disco Band with Dave Crawford, Earl Young, Robert Popwell and others. They released three dance singles that charted, plus one album on Ariola Records. Terry worked on two blaxploitation films directed by Fred Williamson. He orchestrated music for Boss Nigger (1975), and wrote and produced music for No Way Back (1976), including songs by The Dells. In the late 1970s he moved out of the music industry. Terry did not perform in the Funk Brothers reunion which led to the 2002 documentary Standing in the Shadows of Motown, (though he is listed under Honorable Mentions on a two disc DVD edition of the film).Standing in the Shadows of Motown, DVD, Lions Gate, 2003, USA ==Private life == At one time Terry was married to singer and songwriter Mikki Farrow.
