    "text": "View of the Cannaregio Canal was painted by Francesco Guardi around 1770. It is a small oil on canvas painting measuring 48.9 \u00d7 77.5 cm. It now hangs in the reading room of the Frick Art Reference Library alongside the Regatta in Venice. Both paintings were gifted to the Frick Collection by Helen Clay Frick after her father's death. In the painting, Guardi captures a typical scene of Venetian life on the canals. In this particular veduta, Guardi depicts a section of the northern bank of the Cannaregio Canal, one of Venice\u2019s largest canals, located in the Cannaregio sestiere (district) of the city. The Palazzo Surian Bellotto is the most prominent building in the painting, named after the two different families who owned the palace: first the Surian family and then the Bellotto family. The Ponte dei Tre Archi connects the northern bank with the small fragment of the southern bank. The bridge\u2019s arch acts as a viewfinder, focusing the viewer\u2019s gaze onto the tiny patch of pure blue, breaking up the otherwise entirely urban landscape. Another building that features in this view is the Santa Maria delle Penitenti. It is recognizable by its circular window below the roof and placement behind the Ponte dei Tre Archi. This church was designed by Giorgio Massari in 1725 and the fa\u00e7ade was never completed. Guardi takes care to ensure its recognizability despite its modest appearance. ==References== *http://www.venicethefuture.com/schede/uk/242?aliusid=242 * * Category:1770 paintings Category:Paintings by Francesco Guardi Category:Paintings of the Frick Collection Category:Cityscape paintings of Venice ",
