Kossmann, The Arabic Influence on Northern Berber, p.22 (Brill, 2013) The Western Algerian group of Berber dialects include Chenoua (within which is Gouraya) and Snous.Note: Kossmann includes Beni Snous in the Western Algerian group ; However it is often considered a dialect of Tarifit (S. Chaker (1991), A. Renisio (1932)) It also comprises the Berber dialects spoken in smaller areas of Blida, Medea, Miliana and Ouarsenis (i.e. Blench's Chelif Berber), as well as the nearly (or already?) extinct dialects of Achacha, A\u00eft H'lima and Bathia,R.
