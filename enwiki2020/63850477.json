    "text": "Sinomegaceros is an extinct genus of deer known from the Early to Late Pleistocene of East Asia. It is considered to be part of the group of \"giant deer\" (often referred to collectively as members of the tribe Megacerini), with a probable close relationship to Megaloceros. Many members of the genus are noted for their distinctive palmate antler brow tines. == Taxonomy == Drawing of the braincase and antlers of Sinomegaceros ordosianus Sinomegaceros yabei head closeup The first species of the genus S. ordosianus and S. pachyosteus were named by legendary Chinese paleontologist C. C. Young as species of Cervus in 1932 for material from Zhoukoudian.Young, C.C., 1932. On the Artiodactyla from the Sinanthropus site at Chouk\u2019outien. Palaeontogia Sinica, Series C 8 (2), 159 In a review of the paper the subsequent year Dietrich created the name Sinomegaceros as a subgenus of Cervus to house the species, with S. pachyosteus as the type.Dietrich, W.O., 1933. [Review of] C.C. Young: on the Artiodactyla from the Sinanthropus Site at Choukoutien. Neuest Jahrbuch fu \u0308r Miner-alogie, Geologie und Pala \u0308ontologie. Referate, III 1933(2), 475\u2013477. Due to the fact that the name was not published in a formal research paper it was not widely used for several decades after publication. The species S. yabei was named in 1938.Shikama, T., 1938. Discovery of giant fallow deer from the Pleistocene in Japan. Japanese Journal of Geology and Geography 16 (1\u20132), 115\u2013122 In the following decades various researchers considered it a subgenus of Megaloceros,Kahlke, H.D., Hu, C.-k., 1957.

Several named species are likely to be junior synonyms. The best known species are Sinomegaceros yabei from the Middle to Late Pleistocene of Japan, alongside Sinomegaceros pachyosteus from the late Early Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene of China. An unpublished PhD thesis of mitochondrial genomes from Sinomegaceros found that they were part of Cervinae, and were within the clade containing mitochondrial genomes of the Irish elk, suggesting introgression. == Evolution == The oldest known species in China is S. konwanlinensis from the lower Lishui Formation, around 1.1-1.15 Ma. S. pachyosteus appears around 1 Ma. Among the youngest known dates of S. ordosianus are around 35-50 kya in the Ordos. S. yabei first appears in the latter half of the Middle Pleistocene in Japan. It has been suggested that both S. pachyosteus and S. yabei ultimately derive from S. konwanlinensis. The latest reliable dates for S. yabei are around 40 kyr BP. == References == Category:Pleistocene mammals of Asia Category:Prehistoric mammal genera ",
