Teresa Amy died in Montevideo on 30 January 2017. ==Critical reception== According to the critic and poet , \"Teresa Amy's original place in current Uruguayan poetry is that of polyphony \u2013 the union of the many voices that can fit on the written page, including that of a tradition in dialogue with Eastern Europe, together with the baroque of the concept, and the voice of erudition.\" Fressia adds: \"It is impossible, indeed, not to admire her skill with language, the wise interruptions of the syntactic flow, and the ability to create a narrative with a succession of nominal groups, as in her poem 'Inventario mediterr\u00e1neo', an economy of language comparable only to the famous 'Le message' by Jacques Pr\u00e9vert.\" Fellow translator, critic, and poet Roberto Appratto considers Amy's writing \"concise and intense, attentive to the variations of sound of a word in different parts of a verse\", revealing a \"fiber of a poet\". In his opinion, \"She arrived at her best in her latest books (Cortejo m\u00ednimo, Jade, and Brilla).\" ==Works== * Coraz\u00f3n de roble (1995), poetry, Vint\u00e9n Editor, * Retratos del Merodeador y otros poemas (1999), poetry, Vint\u00e9n Editor, * La m\u00e1s larga de las noches (2002), translation \u2013 in collaboration with Alfredo Infanz\u00f3n \u2013 of the work by Czech poet Jan Sk\u00e1cel, Editorial \u00c1crono, Mexico * Lamento por Belgrado (2003), translation \u2013 in collaboration with Lazar Manojlovic \u2013 of Lament nad Beogradom by Serbian poet Milo\u0161 Crnjanski, Editorial \u00c1crono, Mexico * Cuaderno de las islas (2003), poetry, Ediciones del Mirador, * Cortejo M\u00ednimo (2005), poetic work that also contains a translation of \"Sal\u00f3n de la luna\" by Macedonian writer , Artefato, * Cincuenta poetas uruguayos del medio siglo (1955\u20132005) (2005), selection of Uruguayan poets, with prologue and notes by Gerardo Ciancio, Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n, Centro de Difusi\u00f3n del Libro, Montevideo, * Jade (2011), poetry, Yagur\u00fa, * Un hu\u00e9sped en casa, memorias de una traducci\u00f3n (2013), Yagur\u00fa, * Brilla: 20 poemas para Marco (2014), poetry, Yagur\u00fa, * 20 del XX: poetas checos (2017), selection and translation of 20 Czech poets, La Otra and Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Monterrey, ==References== ==External links== * Category:1950 births Category:2017 deaths Category:20th-century Uruguayan educators Category:21st-century translators Category:21st-century Uruguayan poets Category:Czech\u2013Spanish translators Category:French\u2013Spanish translators Category:Language teachers Category:Suicides in Uruguay Category:University of the Republic (Uruguay) alumni Category:Uruguayan translators Category:Uruguayan women educators Category:Uruguayan women poets Category:Writers from Montevideo Category:20th- century Uruguayan poets Category:20th-century translators Category:20th- century Uruguayan women writers Category:21st-century Uruguayan women writers Category:21st-century Uruguayan educators ",
