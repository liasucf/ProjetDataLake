For example, a cool oven has temperature set to 200 \u00b0F (90 \u00b0C), and a slow oven has a temperature range from 300-325 \u00b0F (150-160 \u00b0C). A moderate oven has a range of 350-375 \u00b0F (180-190 \u00b0C), and a hot oven has temperature set to 400-450 \u00b0F (200-230 \u00b0C). A fast oven has a range of 450-500 \u00b0F (230-260 \u00b0C) for the typical temperature. ==Estimating oven temperature== Before ovens had thermometers or thermostats, these standard words were used by cooks and cookbooks to describe how hot an oven should be to cook various items. Custards require a slow oven for example, bread a moderate oven, and pastries a very hot oven. Cooks estimated the temperature of an oven by counting the number of minutes it took to turn a piece of white paper golden brown, or counting the number of seconds one could hold one's hand in the oven. Another method was to put a layer of flour or a piece of white tissue paper on a pan in the oven for five minutes. The resulting colors range from delicate brown in a slow oven through golden brown in a moderate oven to dark brown in a hot oven. == See also == * Conversion of units * Gas Mark (Regulo) * SI Units == References == Category:Baking Category:Temperature ",
