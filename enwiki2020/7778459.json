He graduated from Prairie View A&M; University in 1959 with a bachelor's degree and later from Shippensburg College of Pennsylvania with a master's degree in public administration in 1978. ==Military career== Waller spent 32 years in the United States Army and served in the Vietnam War. Waller held a variety of staff and command positions which included: chief of staff, 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Stewart, Georgia; Commanding General, 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized), V Corps, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. Waller was the deputy commander-in-chief for military operations with United States Central Command (Forward), during the Persian Gulf War. Waller's last duty assignment was as Commanding General, I Corps at Fort Lewis, Washington, before he retired from the military at the rank of lieutenant general, on November 30, 1991. ===Opposition to military service by homosexuals=== Waller vehemently opposed, like most other military members, homosexuals serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. During the 1993 U.S. Senate hearings on allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the United States military, Waller vigorously opposed it. He declared that \"to compare [his] service in American's armed forces with the integration of avowed homosexuals is personally offensive.\" (The Columbia Reader on Lesbians and Gay Men in Media, Society, and Politics), Gross and James Woods, editors, Accessed December 1, 2008 ==Later life and death== After retiring from the military, Waller moved to Denver, Colorado and served as the president and chief executive officer of an environmental technology company, RKK Limited. He then became the senior vice president for the Department of Energy Programs for the ICF Kaiser Environmental and Energy Group. In July 1995, Waller became the Kaiser-Hill vice president for site operations and integration at Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site. Waller died in Washington, D.C. on May 9, 1996, at the age of 58, due to complications from a heart attack. Upon learning of his death, President Bill Clinton said, \"His rise from humble beginnings to one of the highest-ranking African American officers in the U.S. military through stalwart determination and a record of excellence served as an inspiration to minority and non-minority officers.\" Clinton also cited Waller's reputation as a \"skillful and disciplined professional and a caring, enthusiastic commander.\" ==Awards and decorations== {| |125px |Combat Infantryman Badge |- |80px |Master Parachutist Badge |- |80px |Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge |- |80px |Army Staff Identification Badge |- |80px |Vietnam Parachutist Badge |- |40px |77th Armored Regiment Distinctive Unit Insignia |} {| | |Defense Distinguished Service Medal |- | |Army Distinguished Service Medal with one bronze oak leaf cluster |- | |Defense Superior Service Medal |- | |Bronze Star Medal with one bronze oak leaf cluster |- |14px14px14px |Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters |- | |Air Medal |- | |Army Commendation Medal |- | |National Defense Service Medal with one bronze service star |- | |Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal |- |11px11px |Vietnam Service Medal with two service stars |- | |Army Service Ribbon |- | |Army Overseas Service Ribbon |- | |Vietnam Armed Forces Honor Medal, 1st class |- |60px |France Legion of Honour (degree unknown) |- | |Unidentified decoration |- | |Vietnam Campaign Medal |} Waller's civic awards include the Martin Luther King Jr. \"Buffalo Soldier\" Award from the Congress of Racial Equality, the Roy Wilkins Renown Service Award from the NAACP and the \"Star of Texas\" award from the state of Texas. ==References== ==External links== *Calvin Waller at the Arlington National Cemetery website Category:1937 births Category:1996 deaths Category:African-American military personnel Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Military leaders of the Gulf War Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army) Category:United States Army generals Category:Prairie View A&M; University alumni Category:People from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:Recipients of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal ",
