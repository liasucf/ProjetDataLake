    "text": "This article provides information on the under 16 premiership deciders of rugby league competitions held on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The Match Details sub-section details the individual point-scorers in a match, where known. In 1996 and all but one season since 2003, a second tier under 16 competition has also been held. The current competition is conducted under the auspices of the Central Coast Division Junior Rugby League, an affiliate of NSW Country Rugby League and the New South Wales Rugby League. A predecessor to the under 16 competition was D Grade, which was held from 1955 to 1966. When Group status was obtained in 1967, C and D Grade became Under 19 and Under 17. This was changed again the following year, 1968, to under 18 and under 16. The junior body, or association, switched from weight-based divisions to age-based divisions in 1971, with under 15 the oldest. In 1979, the youth competitions reverted to being under 19 and under 17. This changed again in 1983. The under 18 competition remained under the control of the senior body and continued to be played on Sundays prior to grade matches. The junior association took on the Under 16 competition, with matches played on Saturdays. ==Division 1== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Under 16 Grand Finals ! Season ! Teams ! Premiers !
