JOSEPH NEWELL REESON. 1868-1953 E-ISSN 1753-7789 ==Early life and education== Reeson was born in England on 2 June 1868 and attended Kensington Grammar School.

In 1926, he was awarded a Telford Premium medal for his Paper on \u201c The Influence of Electric Welding in the Design and Fabrication of Plant and Structures.\u201dMin. Proc. Instn Civ. Engrs, vol. 222, p. 158 (1925-26, Pt 2) He was also one of the first recipients of the Kernot Memorial Medal awarded in 1929 by the University of Melbourne for his research into electric welding.University of Melbourne, the Kernot Medalists He died at Melbourne, Australia on 15 July 1953 leaving an estate valued at \u00a333,103 to a daughter-in-law and grand- daughter. ==References== Category:Australian civil engineers Category:1868 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Institution of Civil Engineers ",
