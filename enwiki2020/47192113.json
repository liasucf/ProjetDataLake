    "text": "Khin Maung Oo (; also known as Bu Reh) was the Chief Minister of Kayah State, Myanmar from 2011 to 2016. A member of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), he was elected to represent Bawlakhe Township Constituency No. 1 as a Kayah State Hluttaw representative in the 2010 Burmese general election. On 28 June 2015, he resigned from the USDP, along with the Kayah State ministers for transportation, electric power, industry, and Bamar ethnic affairs. On 13 July 2015, the USDP released a statement that Khin Maung Oo had in fact been sacked for \u201cdisturbing party unity\u201d and violating the party's policy for the 2015 Burmese general election. The conflict was related to disagreements with the national headquarters of USDP regarding the permission for 2 government ministers, Aung Min and Soe Thein, to contest safe seats in Kayah State for the elections. The seats they had contested in the 2010 Burmese general election were now occupied by members of the National League for Democracy and considered more challenging to win. Khin Maung Oo's father, Kyaw Din, is a former chairman of the Karenni State People's Council during the socialist era. ==References== Category:Government ministers of Myanmar Category:People from Kayah State Category:Burmese people of Karen descent Category:Union Solidarity and Development Party politicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
