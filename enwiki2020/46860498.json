    "text": "Partita for 8 Voices is an a cappella composition by the American composer Caroline Shaw. It was composed from 2009 through 2012 for the vocal group Roomful of Teeth and was released on their Grammy Award-winning debut album October 30, 2012. The piece was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music on April 15, 2013, making Shaw the youngest recipient of the award. The work was not premiered in full until November 4, 2013, at (Le) Poisson Rouge in New York City. ==Composition== ===Movements=== Partita for 8 Voices has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in four movements named for Baroque dances: ==Reception== At the premiere of the complete Partita for 8 Voices, Justin Davidson of New York wrote that Shaw had \"discovered a lode of the rarest commodity in contemporary music: joy.\" In October 2019, several performers of katajjaq, including Canadian Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, accused Caroline Shaw and Roomful of Teeth of having engaged in cultural appropriation and exoticism for the perceived uncredited quotation of a katajjaq song in the third movement of Partita. In a public statement released by Caroline Shaw and artistic director Brad Wells, Roomful of Teeth acknowledged that it had hired and studied with Inuit singers in 2010 and that techniques learned from those studies had been used in Partita but said that they believed those \"patterns to be sufficiently distinct from katajjaq.\" ==References== Category:Compositions by Caroline Shaw Category:2012 compositions Category:A cappella songs Category:Pulitzer Prize for Music-winning works Category:21st- century classical music ",
