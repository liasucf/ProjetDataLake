    "text": "Winter Marquee is a live album by folk singer Nanci Griffith. It was her first studio album for Rounder Records after leaving Elektra Records. Recorded live during the Clock Without Hands tour in spring 2002, this album grew from the original wish to capture just one live song (Phil Ochs' \"What's That I Hear\") into a 14-track live CD album, Griffith's first live recording since One Fair Summer Evening (1988). On May 29, 2002, at the historic Tennessee Theatre in Knoxville, a live performance was filmed, and released on DVD under the same name. During the recording of both the album and the DVD, Griffith was joined on stage by Emmylou Harris, Tom Russell and Andrew Hardin. == Track listing == All tracks composed by Nanci Griffith; except where indicated #\"Speed of the Sound of Loneliness\" (John Prine) 4:40 #\"I Wish It Would Rain\" 2:36 #\"Boots of Spanish Leather\" (Bob Dylan) 6:34 #\"Two for the Road\" 2:59 #\"Listen to the Radio\" 3:51 #\"There's a Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret)\" 4:46 #\"Gulf Coast Highway\" (Griffith, James Hooker, Danny Flowers) 3:32 #\"The Flyer\" 4:46 #\"Good Night, New York\" (Julie Gold) 5:06 #\"Traveling Through This Part Of You\" 4:19 #\"Last Train Home\" 3:05 #\"I'm Not Drivin' These Wheels (Bring the Prose to the Wheel)\" 3:40 #\"What's That I Hear\" (Phil Ochs) 4:08 #\"White Freight Liner\" (Townes Van Zandt) 5:01 == Personnel == * Ron de la Vega - bass, cello, vocals * Le Ann Etheridge - acoustic guitar, vocals * Andrew Hardin - acoustic guitar * Emmylou Harris - vocals * James Hooker - keyboards, vocals * Pat McInerney - drums, percussion * Tom Russell - vocals, acoustic guitar * Chas Williams - resonator guitar * Nanci Griffith - vocals, acoustic guitar == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
