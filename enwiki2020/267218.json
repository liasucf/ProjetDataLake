    "text": "Aerial view of Mong Kok Argyle Street in Mong Kok Mong Kok (also spelled Mongkok, often abbreviated as MK) is an area in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Prince Edward road occupies the northern part of Mong Kok. Mong Kok is one of the major shopping areas in Hong Kong. The area is characterised by a mixture of old and new multi-story buildings, with shops and restaurants at street level, and commercial or residential units above. Major industries in Mong Kok are retail, restaurants (including fast food) and entertainment. It has been described and portrayed in films as an area in which triads run bars, nightclubs, and massage parlors. With its extremely high population density of 130,000/km2 or 340,000 per square mile, Mong Kok was described as the busiest district in the world by the Guinness World Records. ==Name== Until 1930, the area was called Mong Kok Tsui (\u8292\u89d2\u5634).Yau Tsim Mong District Council, You Jian Wang Qu Fengwuzhi(\u6cb9\u5c16\u65fa\u5340\u98a8\u7269\u5fd7), Hong Kong: 1999. p18. \"Mong Kok Tsui\"(\u8292\u89d2\u5634) The current English name is a transliteration of its older Chinese name \u671b\u89d2 (; ), or \u8292\u89d2 (; ), which is named for its plentiful supply of ferns in the past when it was a coastal region. Its present Chinese name \"\u65fa\u89d2\" (; ), means \"prosperous corner\" or \"crowded corner\", however, the English name did not change. For a period, the area was also called Argyle, and this name was used for the MTR station when it opened in 1979. The office building , which was named after the area, is known in English as Argyle Centre rather than Mong Kok Centre. ==Administration== Mong Kok is part of Yau Tsim Mong District. It was part of the Mong Kok District before the district was merged in 1994. The area belongs to the Kowloon West geographical constituency of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. ==History== Displays at the Chinese University of Hong Kong include antique potteries indicating that there might have been settlements in the area as early as the Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420). The area used to be a Hakka settlement, with about 200 villagers according to Bao'an records in 1819. The heart of the present-day Mong Kok is along Argyle Street near Sai Yeung Choi Street whilst the proper Mong Kok used to be to the north, near the present- day Mong Kok East Station. Mong Kok was an area of cultivated lands, bounded to the south by Argyle Street, to the west by Coronation Road (a section of present-day Nathan Road), and to the east by hills. To the southeast of Mong Kok is Ho Man Tin and to the west Tai Kok Tsui. On 10 August 2008 the Cornwall Court fire broke out. More than 200 firefighters were involved in the rescue operation. Four people died, including two firefighters. Mong Kok received a lot of negative media attention for many acid attacks on Sai Yeung Choi Street from December 2008 through January 2010. The area was the site of protracted demonstrations during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, including the gau wu campaign, and was also the site of the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest. ==Streets and markets== Ladies' Market Sai Yeung Choi Street South Fa Yuen Street Flower Market Road Grand Century Place.
