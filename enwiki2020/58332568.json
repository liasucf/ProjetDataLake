    "text": "Transvision is an extended play by German electronic artist Alva Noto. It was released in 2005 via Raster Noton label. ==Background== This is the second part of the transall tryptich that, according to the artist, respectively deals with one of three interrelated themes: the increased speed of information flow, utopias, and the fragmentation of ideas. The record is accompanied by an essay written by theorist and filmmaker Kodwo Eshun who turns on ideas of freedom, intuition, and possibility in the service of erecting a monument (sic). His most attractively cogent observation states that the enigma of the sonic makes life vivid. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Carsten Nicolai \u2013 sounds *Kodwo Eshun \u2013 liner notes *Nibo, R-N Modul Berlin \u2013 design ==References== ==External links== *Alva Noto official website Category:2005 albums Category:Alva Noto albums Category:Raster-Noton albums ",
