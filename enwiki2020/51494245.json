However he refuses to renounce abstract art, despite the new Stalinist regime demanding only Socialist Realist art be taught. This results in him being stripped of his position at the school, his works (including his famous, \u201cNeo-Plastic Room\u201d at the Muzeum Sztuki in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a) were either withdrawn from public view or simply destroyed. Then the bureaucracy denied him his ability to make a living as a sign- painter, prevented him buying art supplies, and collecting food stamps. ==See also== *List of submissions to the 89th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film *List of Polish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2016 films Category:2016 drama films Category:2016 biographical drama films Category:Polish films Category:Polish drama films Category:Polish- language films Category:Biographical films about painters Category:Cultural depictions of 20th-century painters Category:Cultural depictions of Polish men Category:Films directed by Andrzej Wajda ",
