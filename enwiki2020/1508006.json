    "text": "Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine (literally: Borderland of free frontier guards; ; ), or Slobozhanshchina (, ; , ), is a historical region, now located in Northeastern Ukraine and Southwestern Russia. It developed and flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries on the southwestern frontier of the Tsardom of Russia. In 1765 it was converted into the Sloboda Ukraine Governorate. ==Etymology== The name derives from the term sloboda for a colonial settlement free of tax obligations, and the word ukraine in its original sense of \"borderland\".

Some Ukrainian scholars, beginning in the 1930s, have interpreted the term 'ukraina' in the sense of 'region, principality, country'. In Ukrainian language (as well as Belarusian, but not Russian) the word for a country or a land is 'kraina'. The use of the word 'kraina' in Ukrainian language semantically is close to the meaning of partitioning than a border or an edge. Many medieval occurrences of the word can be interpreted as having that meaning. In this sense, the word can be associated with contemporary Ukrainian 'krajina' and Belarusian 'kraina', meaning 'country'. ==Geographical extent== The territory of historic Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine corresponds to the territory of the present-day Ukrainian oblast (province) of Kharkiv (in its entirety), and parts of the Sumy, Donetsk, and Luhansk Oblasts, as well as parts of the Belgorod, Kursk, and Voronezh Oblasts of Russia.What Makes Kharkiv Ukrainian, The Ukrainian Week (23 November 2014) ==Origin== Russia gained control over the territory as the result of conquests against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the Muscovite\u2013Lithuanian Wars in the 16th century.

For decades, Ukrainian cossacks were crossing the border into southern Russia to gather livestock, but many of them were also entering for banditry, so that Russia had to build a new garrison town on the Boguchar River in an attempt to defend the land from Ukrainian bandsBrian Davies.

With the Russian territorial expansion south and east into the lands of modern Sloboda Ukraine and mid Volga River the conflict intensified. Sometime between 1580s and 1640s the Belgorod Defense Line with number of fortifications, moats, and forts was constructed in Sloboda Ukraine, providing security to the region. After a number of Russo-Crimean Wars, the Russian monarchs started to encourage the settlement of the region by Cossacks who acted as a sort of frontier guard force against the raids of the Tatars. Folk architecture of Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine Apart from the Cossacks, the settlers included peasants and townspeople from Right and Left-bank Ukraine, divided by the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. The name Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine derives from the word sloboda, a Slavic term meaning \"freedom\" (or \"liberty)\", and also the name of a type of settlement. The Tsar would free the settlers of a sloboda from the obligation of paying taxes and fees for a certain period of time, which proved very enticing for settlers. By the end of the 18th century, settlers occupied 523 slobodas (slobody) in Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine. From 1650 to 1765, the territory referred to as Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine became increasingly organized according to Cossack military custom, similar to that of the Zaporozhian Host and Don Host. The relocated cossacks became known as Sloboda Cossacks. There were five regimental districts (polky) of Sloboda Cossacks, named after the towns of their sustained deployment, and subdivided into company districts (sotni). Regional centers included Ostrogozhsk, Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, and Izyum, while the Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine Cossack capital was located in Sumy until 1743. Kharkov Viceroyalty in 1792 The administration of Catherine the Great disbanded the regiments of Slobozhanshchina and abolished Cossack privileges by the decree of July 28, 1765. The semiautonomous region became a province called Sloboda Ukraine Governorate (Slobidska Ukraine gubernia). St. Petersburg, 1901, First publication: 1865 Saint Petersburg replaced the regimental administrations with Russian hussar regiments, and granted Cossack higher ranks (starshinas) officership and nobility (dvoryanstvo). In 1780, the governorate was transformed into the Kharkov Viceroyalty (namestnichestvo) which existed until the end of 1796, when it was again renamed the Slobidska Ukraine gubernia. Each administrative reform involved territorial changes. In 1835 the province of Sloboda (Slobidska) Ukraine was abolished, ceding most of its territory to the new Kharkov Governorate, and some to Voronezh and Kursk, which came under the Little Russian General Governorship of Left-bank Ukraine. After the establishment of the Soviet Union Sloboda Ukraine was divided between the Ukrainian SSR and the Russian SFSR. The early 1930s forced end to Ukrainization in the parts of Sloboda Ukraine located in the Russian SFSR led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the 1937 Soviet Census compared to the 1926 First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union.Unknown Eastern Ukraine, The Ukrainian Week (14 March 2012) The Ukrainian SSR reorganized their part of the region several times before establishing the borders of present-day Kharkiv Oblast in 1932. ==References== ==External links== * Slobidska Ukraine in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine * The autonomous hetman state and Sloboda Ukraine in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Category:Historical regions in Ukraine Category:Historical regions in Russia Category:Zaporozhian Host Category:17th-century establishments in Ukraine Category:Divided regions ",
