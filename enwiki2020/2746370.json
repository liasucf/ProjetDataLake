    "text": "The Casino Goa The Casino Goa is a live casino located offshore in Panaji in Goa. The casino is located on a yacht, the M.V. Caravela, anchored in the River Mandovi. The casino vessel worth is 110 million Rupees and is owned by the Advani Pleasure Cruise Co Ltd as a joint venture between the company and Casinos Austria. It has around eleven tables of American Roulette, Blackjack and Paplu (Rummy) besides a few electronic slot machines. The setup of the casino was controversial as live gambling is outlawed in India. This was partially circumvented by hosting it off the mainland. The government in Goa is promoting offshore casinos in Goa by granting new licences to more companies in an attempt to generate more tourist related revenue. Goa state is the only one in India that permits both electronic onland casinos as well as live offshore ones. ==References== *Deltin Royale: India's Largest and Most Luxurious Casino honored by World Records India , World Records India, March 8, 2016 *Deltin Royale: Casino lessons from India's largest offshore gaming and entertainment centre, The Economic Times, June 14, 2015 *Live casino comes to Goa, GoaNews, Sandesh Prabhudesai, 28 December 2000 *Politicians jumble facts on casino gamble, GoaNews, Sandesh Prabhudesai, 8 January 2001 *No more casinos in Goa, Goa News, Rupesh Samant, 29 December 2004 *Punters Ahoy, The Hindu, Hugh and Colleen Gantzer, Sunday, 7 Dec 2003 Category:Buildings and structures in Panaji Category:Casinos in India Category:Tourist attractions in Panaji ",
