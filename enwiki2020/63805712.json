    "text": "The Archway Tavern in 2020, after the revitalisation The Archway Tavern is a pub in Archway, London, situated on Highgate Hill near Archway tube station. It was shut for many years because of a licensing dispute. It was briefly re- opened as the Intrepid Fox, and at one point operated as a venue called Dusk till Dawn, but has remained largely closed since then. The site of the present pub has housed pubs since the 1700s, with the current building being built in 1888. At one point, a cable car service up Highgate Hill terminated outside the tavern. The building is locally listed by Islington Council, which stated in November 2018 that the Archway Tavern was \"a historic feature and a focal point of the Town Centre\" and that it would resist any change of use of the building from being a public house. The building is now owned by Searchgrade Limited, a property company, which bought it for \u00a33.8m in 2019. , plans exist to reopen the pub full-time, following the resolution of licensing issues regarding the pub and its adjacent nightclub. == References == Category:Pubs in the London Borough of Islington Category:1888 establishments in England Category:Former pubs in London ",
