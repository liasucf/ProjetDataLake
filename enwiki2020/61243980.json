She was the third woman to be elected to the House of Assembly, after Tekarei Russell in 1974 and Fenua Tamuera in 1990.Van Trease 1993, p. 356. During the 1991 Kiribati parliamentary election, Koriri Tenieu's husband, Teaiwa Tenieu, was found guilty of bribery, and his election was voided. A by-election was held, in which Koriri Tenieu stood and was elected. This election was then also declared void, as Teaiwa had been found to have bribed people and organisations in support of his wife.Van Trease 1993, pp. 105\u2013106. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Assembly of Kiribati Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century I-Kiribati politicians Category:20th-century I-Kiribati women politicians ",
