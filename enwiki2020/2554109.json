Simeon Solomon and the Biblical Construction of Marginal Identity in Victorian England, Journal of Homosexuality, Volume 33, Issue 3-4, 1997 His career was cut short following arrests and convictions for sodomy in 1873 and 1874. ==Biography== Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene, 1864 Watercolour on paper, Tate Britain Solomon was born into a prominent Jewish family. He was the eighth and last child born to merchant Michael (Meyer) Solomon and artist Catherine (Kate) Levy. Solomon was a younger brother to fellow painters Abraham Solomon (1824-1862) and Rebecca Solomon (1832-1886). Born and educated in London, Solomon started receiving lessons in painting from his older brother around 1850. He started attending Carey's Art Academy in 1852. His older sister first exhibited her works at the Royal Academy during the same year. As a student at the Royal Academy Schools, Solomon was introduced through Dante Gabriel Rossetti to other members of the Pre- Raphaelite circle, as well as the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne and the painter Edward Burne-Jones in 1857. His first exhibition was at the Royal Academy in 1858. He continued to hold exhibitions of his work at the Royal Academy between 1858 and 1872. In addition to the literary paintings favoured by the Pre-Raphaelite school, Solomon's subjects often included scenes from the Hebrew Bible and genre paintings depicting Jewish life and rituals. His association with Swinburne led to his illustrating Swinburne's controversial novel Lesbia Brandon in 1865.Peter Horne, Reina Lewis, Outlooks: lesbian and gay sexualities and visual cultures, Routledge, 1996, , p. 70 In 1873 Simeon was arrested for \"cruising public restrooms\" and having sex with a 60-year-old stableman named George Roberts. Both men were charged with indecent exposure and an attempt to commit buggery. Both were found guilty, fined \u00a3100 and sentenced to 18 months hard labour. .William A. Peniston, \"Pederasts and others: urban culture and sexual identity in nineteenth-century Paris\", Haworth gay & lesbian studies, Routledge, 2004, , pp. 77\u201378 He was arrested again in 1874 in Paris, after which he was sentenced to spend three months in prison.Michael Matthew Kaylor, \"Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde\", Michael Matthew Kaylor, 2006, , p. 81Jeffrey Merrick, Bryant T. Ragan, \"Homosexuality in modern France\", Studies in the history of sexuality, Oxford University Press US, 1996, , p. 134 After his prosecutions he no longer exhibited, but achieved a degree of celebrity amongst those who shared his sensibilities: Oscar Wilde, John Addington Symonds, Count Eric Stenbock, and Walter Pater all collected his works.Kaylor, Michael Matthew, Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians - Hopkins, Pater and Wilde, Masaryk University, Brno: 2006, p82 Note 1 In 1884 he was admitted to the workhouse where he continued to produce work, but his life and talent were blighted by alcoholism. Twenty years later in 1905, he died from complications brought on by his alcoholism. He was buried at the Jewish Cemetery in Willesden. Examples of his work are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum, Wightwick Manor in Wolverhampton, and at Leighton House in west London. Retrospectives of his work have been held at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2005\u20136, and in London at the Ben Uri Gallery in 2006. == Exhibitions == === 1906 === * Paintings and Drawings by the Late Simeon Solomon, Baillie Gallery, 54 Baker St, London. 9 Dec 1905 \u2013 13 Jan 1906 * Winter Exhibition of Works of the Old Masters and Deceased Masters of the British School, Royal Academy, London. 1 Jan \u2013 10 March 1906 * Exhibition of Jewish Art and Antiquities, Whitechapel Art Gallery. 7 Nov \u2013 16 Dec 1906 * Exeter Museum and Art Gallery.
