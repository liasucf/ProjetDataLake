TV Guide. At the age of 22, he selected the professional name James Roday. In a July 2020 interview, Rodriguez explained the decision was mainly driven by producers urging him to change his name to better suit his Caucasian appearance. The characters he read for up until that point either were not written with a Latino background or required a non-white \"Mexican\" appearance. In order to book his first job, he legally changed his middle name, David, to Roday, and omitted Rodriguez from his screen name. In the same interview, he announced that he was going to use his full legal name, James Roday Rodriguez, going forward. == Career == Rodriguez started his acting career starring in various theatrical productions, including Three Sisters, A Respectable Wedding and Severity's Mistress. He took on leading roles in Sexual Perversity in Chicago and Extinction which he produced with his theatre company Red Dog Squadron, for which he also directed the play Greedy and wrote and directed the one-act play Sustenance. His most recent foray onto the stage was in December 2016, when he starred in the New York production of White Rabbit Red Rabbit by Iranian playwright Nassim Soleimanpour. His big screen debut was in the 1999 film Coming Soon alongside Ryan Reynolds and fellow debutant Ashton Kutcher.
