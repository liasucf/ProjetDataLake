    "text": "Illuminated Frontispiece, Al-Ousta Codex Al-Ousta Codex, also known under its library classification BnF 1314-1315, is a 14th-centuryBibliotheque Nationale de Paris; Mo\u00efse Schwab, \"Manuscrits du suppl\u00e9ment h\u00e9breu de la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale\", R\u00c9J 37 (1898), pp. 112\u2013113 illuminated Bible codex (2 volumes) containing the 24 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible, written in Sephardi square script with the Tiberian sublinear vocalisation, minuscule trope symbols, and the Masorah Magna and Parva. Others place the writing of the codex in the 15th-century. The manuscript was purchased by ethnographer Jacob Sapir in San'a, Yemen in 1859, who carried it with him to France. Today, the manuscript is housed at the Bibliotheque Nationale de Paris. Although purchased in Yemen, the manuscript is not of Yemenite Jewish provenance, as it shows no signs of the ancient Yemenite Jewish tradition of orthography, but of the Sephardic Jewish tradition of orthography. Prior to its debut in Yemen, the manuscript was in Egypt, where it was purchased by Aharon haCohen Iraqi (al-'Us\u1e6d\u0101), the visiting minister from Yemen and minter of the king's coins.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 1), Lyck 1866 [reprinted in Magenza (Mainz) 1874], p. 101a (in Hebrew). Sapir seems to be uncertain with himself, as he writes that it was purchased by Aharon Cohen-Iraqi either in Persia or in Egypt. Aharon Cohen-Iraqi is the progenitor of an illustrious family. His son, Shalom Iraqi al-Cohen (1685\u20131780), was the first of this family who bore the epithet al-'Us\u1e6d\u0101 and who served as comptroller of Yemen's customs and surveyor-general of the royal buildings and gardens in Sana'a and who had been the favorite of two successive kings, although demoted in 1761. (See: M. Niebuhr, Travel through Arabia and other Countries in the East, vol. 1, Edinburgh 1792, p. 408; ibid., vol. 2, Edinburgh 1792, pp. 87\u201388) Based on its colophon, one whose name was Sar-Shalom the nasi, the presumed head of the Sephardic Jewish community in Egypt and who lived in Cairo,, citing Berlin MS Or. Heb. Oct. 517, f. 64b; cited also in Jacob Mann, Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature, vol. 2, Ktav Pub. House: New York 1972, p. 254 had commissioned the manuscript's writing, and who had apparently been ordained and confirmed in his office by his brother, Shelomo Nasi, the exilarch (resh galutha).On the genealogy of these two brothers, see p. 19a in codex. Sapir also recopied the pedigree in his book, Iben Safir (vol. 1), Lyck 1866 [reprinted in Magenza (Mainz) 1874] (in Hebrew), chapter 6 (p. 18b). ==Jacob Sapir's description== The Al-Ousta codex, named for its original Yemenite Jewish owner whose descendants were coined the name \"al-Ousta\" (lit. al-'Us\u1e6d\u0101 = \"the artisan\"), was described by Jacob Sapir in 1872, who brought its attention to the western world.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 2), Magenza (Mainz) 1874, p. 175 (in Hebrew) The MS. was purchased by Sapir from the grandchildren of a certain David ben Sa\u02bb\u012bd al-\u1e62\u0101rum in San'a, whose grandfather (David), in turn, had acquired it in 1795 from a certain Abraham al-Manzeli, who, in turn, purchased it from the sons of Haroun Cohen-Iraqi, the grandchild of Aharon ha-Cohen Iraqi who purchased the codex in Egypt. They were driven to do so because of their extreme privation. Abraham Firkovich (1786\u20131874) mentions also the codex in his writings. Sapir heaps lavish praises on the codex: > ...Also the precious Bible codex, the peculiar treasure of kings, in an > extraordinarily beautiful handwriting upon parchment, which he (al-Ousta) > had brought with him from Egypt or from Persia, it also was sold by his > children's children in their povertyJacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 1), Lyck > 1866 [reprinted in Magenza (Mainz) 1874] (in Hebrew), p. 101a The first volume of the book is adorned with an illuminated frontispiece and other decorative pages, showing a printed seven-branched candlestick and its appurtenances, using an old squeezing technique to produce a relief effect with gold tracings.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 2), Magenza (Mainz) 1874, pp. 175a\u2013b In the words of Sapir, the codex measures \"two-thirds of a cubit in length, and one-half of a cubit in width.\" It is written upon smooth and thin parchment that was split in half, having the same texture on both its sides. The layout of the codex is made with three columns to a page, with thirty lines to each column. The beginning of the codex contains a genealogical record thought to belong to its original owner, Sar-Shalom the nasi, who traces his lineage back to King David and to the First Man, Adam.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 2), Magenza (Mainz) 1874, pp. 175a\u2013b (in Hebrew); cf. ibid. (vol. 1), chapter 6 (p. 18b) The same genealogical record appears on p. 768 in the 13th and early 14th century Shem \u1e6cov Bible (Hebrew: \u05db\u05ea\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dd \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1) described by bibliophile David Solomon Sassoon (see Sassoon MS. no. 82), which leads to the conclusion that it may have been a standard form used at that time in codices. However, Sapir, in counting the number of generations that had passed since Sar-Shalom's ancestor, Bostanai, reasons that the time-frame given for this man who acquired the codex would have roughly been accurate. ===Date of manuscript=== Page from the Book of Genesis (Al-Ousta Codex) A date found written in the colophon has given rise to some confusion, as the date is written as a biblical verse taken from Deuteronomy 31:22: \"[Herein] written and signed on this seventh day of the [lunar] month Adar, in the year we- yi\u1e2btov mo\u0161eh e\u1e6f ha-\u0161\u012brah hazo\u1e6f, in the year of creation\" (), with only those letters highlighted whose numerical values are to be translated into real numbers.For the date, see bottom of p. 19a in manuscript. According to Sapir, the author of the colophon has highlighted only 5 Hebrew characters, which are \u05db\u05ea\u05d1 \u05de\u05e9 and which letters have the numerical value of 762. Considering that the original owner wrote only the abbreviated era, by adding the millennial year 4 to the number, it means that he wrote this colophon in the year 4762 anno mundi, corresponding with 1002 CE, or which Sapir acknowledges was 870 years before his own time of writing his Iben Safir in 1872 CE.Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 2), Magenza (Mainz) 1874, p. 175 (in Hebrew) Sapir adds that had the writer intended to highlight all eight letters (over which a line had been drawn), it would put the writing of the colophon in the year 4783 anno mundi (corresponding with year 1023 CE).Jacob Sapir, Iben Safir (vol. 1), Lyck 1866 [reprinted in Magenza (Mainz) 1874], p. 18b (in Hebrew) The problem with these configurations is that it would put the writing of the codex much earlier than the period that is known for the style of Sephardic script used in the manuscript. This led Sapir to conclude that the date may actually refer to the time of the giving of the Masorah (Masoretic text), or to something else, but not necessarily to the writing of the codex. Most scholars agree that the manuscript was written in either the 14th or 15th century CE. ===Tradition of orthography=== While most of the orthography of the text follows the Sephardic tradition in plene and defective scriptum,For example, in Genesis 4:13 (p. 18a in codex), \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0 is found, instead of \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d0; in Genesis 7:11 (p. 19b in codex), \u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05e2\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea is found, instead of \u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05e2\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05ea; in Genesis 9:29 (p. 20b in codex), \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d7 is found, instead of \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d7; in Exodus 25:31 (p. 58a in codex), \u05ea\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 is found, instead of \u05ea\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4; in Exodus 28:26 (p. 60a in codex), \u05d0\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3 is found, instead of \u05d0\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e4\u05d3; in Numbers 1:17 (p. 84 in codex), \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea is found, instead of \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e7\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05ea; in Numbers 10:10 (p. 91 in codex), \u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05db\u05dd is found, instead of \u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d9\u05db\u05dd; in Numbers 22:5 (p. 97 in manuscript), \u05d1\u05dc\u05e2\u05dd \u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 is found, instead of \u05d1\u05dc\u05e2\u05dd \u05d1\u05df \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8; and in Deuteronomy 23:2 (p. 119 in codex), \u05e4\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d3\u05db\u05d4 is found, instead of \u05e4\u05e6\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d3\u05db\u05d0. Also in the line arrangement of Shirat Hayam in Exodus 15:1\u201319 (p. 53a in codex), the last line follows the Sephardic tradition established by R. Meir ben Todros Halevi (ca. 1170\u20131244), rather than the tradition of Ben-Asher and that of Yemenite tradition who make use of a different format. there are some things in common with the Yemenite Jewish tradition, such as writing Potiphera (in Genesis 41:45; p. 39a in codex) as one word, and making use of only 67 lines in Shirat Ha'azinu (Deut. 32:1\u201343), just as found in the Yemenite tradition.See pp. 125\u2013126 in manuscript In the line arrangement of Shirat Hayam in Exodus 15:1\u201319 (p. 53a in codex), the last line follows the emendation made by R. Meir ben Todros Halevi (ca. 1170\u20131244), and which the Sephardic communities adhered to., who mentions an invaluable account, whereby Rabbi Meir ben Todros Halevi (ca. 1170\u20131244), when trying to ascertain the correct scribal tradition, mentions his having written to Samuel ibn Tibbon the physician of Marseilles, inquiring about the scroll of the Torah that was with him and which was copied from Maimonides\u2019 scroll of the Torah. Ibn Tibbon replied, sending to him an accurate copy of the arranged lines of the Song of the Sea (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd) in Exodus 15:1\u201319 as found in the scroll that was copied from Maimonides\u2019 Torah scroll. He writes that he found the three words, \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd (= \"the waters of the sea\"), written at the beginning of the last line. Notwithstanding, Rabbi Meir ben Todros admitted to having deviated from this tradition, having decided against its orthography, seeing that in the Song of the Sea all of the previous lines had thus far ended in one word, and it seemed fitting to him that the second to the last line should also end in one word. He therefore changed its order, by his own admittance. The author of Min\u1e25at Shai followed in suit and also changed the original order of the last two lines in the Song of the Sea. ==Aharon haCohen-Iraqi== The codex was bought by Aharon haCohen Iraqi, the wealthy minter of the king's coins, in the early 1700s, and who bequeathed the same codex to his great grandson, Aharon (Haroun) b. Yihya b. Shalom haCohen Iraqi. This family was renowned in San'a and had received the honorable epithet \"al-Ousta,\" meaning the \"skilled artisan.\" They were philanthropists who built several synagogues (one bearing the name \"al-Ousta') and a public bath in San'a to be used by the Jewish community there. The codex purchased by this wealthy family's ancestor subsequently passed several hands of ownership, until, eventually, it was purchased by Sapir in San'a, and taken with him to France. ==References== ==External links== * BnF 1314 - the Al-Ousta Codex (Paris), vol. 1, online viewing (color); or access web-page here (PARIS BN 1314) * BnF 1315 - the Al- Ousta Codex (Paris), vol. 2, online viewing (Black & white) Category:Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France collections Category:Biblical manuscripts Category:Hebrew Bible manuscripts Category:Judaism in Egypt Category:Jewish medieval literature Category:Jewish manuscripts Category:Jewish prayer and ritual texts Category:Assyrian (Ashuri) script Category:14th-century biblical manuscripts Category:14th-century books Category:Yemenite Jews Category:Jewish Egyptian history Category:Spanish Jews Category:Torah Category:Jewish Yemeni history ",
