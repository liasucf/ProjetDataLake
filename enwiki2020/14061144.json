    "text": "God Bless the Go-Go's is the Go-Go's fourth studio album, released on May 15, 2001. It was their first studio album in 17 years since the release of Talk Show in 1984. As of 2020, this is the band's most recent album. ==Critical reception and chart performance== God Bless the Go-Go's received a score of 68 out of 100 from Metacritic based on generally favorable reviews from critics. Allmusic wrote, \"Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While the Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a \"We Got the Beat\" or a \"Head Over Heels\" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, the Go-Go's decided it was now or never.\" Rolling Stone wrote \"The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed. The girls' hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song (\"Unforgiven\") in impeccable Go-Go's drag.\" The album sold fewer copies than the previous Go-Go's studio albums and peaked on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 57. Two singles were released from the album; \"Unforgiven\" and \"Apology.\" ==Artwork controversy== The album cover was created by photographer Maryanne Bilham. It was criticized by some Catholic groups for showing the group members posing as the Virgin Mary. Each Go-Go represented one of five saintly virtues; Chastity (Belinda), Modesty (Charlotte), Purity (Jane), Mercy (Gina) and Honesty (Kathy). The U.S. Catholic League president William Donohue criticized the band for ripping off Catholic imagery and resorting to \"cheap ploys\" to lure a new audience to the band. Go-Go's singer Belinda Carlisle replied to the critics by saying \"any sort of art shouldn't be an issue. Art should not be censored. I don't get that it's controversial at all.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Band members * Belinda Carlisle \u2013 lead vocals * Charlotte Caffey \u2013 lead guitar, piano, backing vocals * Gina Schock \u2013 drums * Kathy Valentine \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Jane Wiedlin \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals ;Additional musicians *Billie Joe Armstrong \u2013 additional guitar and vocals on \"Unforgiven\" *Rami Jaffee \u2013 Mellotron and Chamberlin on \"Here You Are\" *Peggy Baldwin \u2013 cello on \"Here You Are\" *Roger Manning \u2013 Mellotron on \"Daisy Chain\" ;Production *Paul Q.
