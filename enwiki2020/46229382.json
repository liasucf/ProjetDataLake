The ARTC was conceived as a 'one-stop shop' for train operators seeking access to the interstate network. The ARTC commenced a five-year lease on the Victorian interstate tracks from VicTrack in July 1999, which gave it control over the interstate rail network from Albury and Broken Hill through to Kalgoorlie. Marchant used his political knowledge to present a strong business case for Federal funding for the interstate network and in 1999 the government provided ARTC with $250 million that would be spent over the next several years to improve rail network infrastructure. Under Marchant's direction, the ARTC in the early 2000s expanded its business as well as the trackage that came under its control, and in 2001 it was granted rights from the then West Australian track owner WestNet Rail to sell track access to interstate rail operators between Kalgoorlie and Perth for fifteen years. In addition the New South Wales government entered into an agreement for ARTC in September 2004 to lease the interstate and Hunter Valley tracks from the Rail Infrastructure Corporation for a period of 60 years. Subsequently in 2010 ARTC negotiated a lease with the Queensland government for the management of track access of the Queensland standard gauge rail line from the New South Wales border to Acacia Ridge and Brisbane, also for 60 years. Marchant also facilitated the completion of concrete sleeper insertion over the entire ARTC interstate network of 8,500 kilometres that, when combined with other track upgrading and strengthening of culverts and bridges, provided greater network reliability and lower maintenance costs. During Marchant's time as CEO of ARTC, he was heavily involved in other areas of the rail industry: * Director, Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board, 2005-2010 * Chairman, Australasian Rail Association, 2009-2011 * Director, Australasian Railway Association, 1999-2011 * Director of the Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordination Company Pty Ltd, 2009-2011 Marchant stepped down from his role as ARTC's CEO in 2011 after thirteen years at the helm. Marchant is currently serving on the boards of Air Services Australia and QR. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:Australian chief executives Category:Members of the Order of Australia ",
