    "text": "Emmonsia is a genus of soil fungus that can cause adiaspiromycosis, a pulmonary disease common in wild animals (but rare in humans) as well as disseminated disease. ==Description== When aerosolized spores are inhaled, they enlarge dramatically, from 2\u20134 \u03bcm to 40\u2013500 \u03bcm in diameter. ==Etymology== Emmonsia was first described by Chester W. Emmons, senior mycologist with the US Public Health Service, as Haplosporangium parvum in 1942. In 1958, it was reclassified into a separate genus and named in honor of Emmons. Because these swollen cells do not replicate, Emmons and Jellison termed them \u201cadiaspores\u201d (from the Greek a (not) + dia (by) + spora (sowing)). As of 2017, phylogenetic analyses have concluded that fungi in this genus are polyphyletic, and proposed taxonomic changes may render the genus name obsolete. ==Species== Emmonsia contains the following species: * Emmonsia brasiliensis * Emmonsia ciferrina * Emmonsia crescens * Emmonsia helica * Emmonsia parva * Emmonsia pasteuriana * Emmonsia sola * Emmonsia soli ==References== Category:Onygenales ",
