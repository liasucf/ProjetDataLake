Alongside the menceyes of Abona and G\u00fc\u00edmar, Pelinor negotiated peace around 1490 with Pedro de Vera, Governor of Gran Canaria, ratifying a treaty with Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo at the beginning of the conquest in 1494. Once the war ended, Pelinor was the only mencey not brought to the Peninsula to be presented to the Catholic Monarchs.La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496) As a mencey who actively supported the conquerors in the peace negotiations, he was amply rewarded by the new authorities. He received the entire Valle de Masca (Masca Valley), 30 acres of land with water on the \"R\u00edo de Chasna\" (Valle de San Lorenzo) and another 100 acres in the Valle de Santiago - both pieces of land in the former domains of Adeje. Also, his family was granted a coat of arms. Pelinor died around 1505. == References == == External links == * Los guanches Category:People from Tenerife Category:Military personnel killed in action Category:Guanche Category:1505 deaths ",
