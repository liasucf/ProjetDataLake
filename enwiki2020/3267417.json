His father was the 10th Earl of Southesk, the son of the 9th Earl of Southesk and Lady Catherine Hamilton Noel. His mother was Ethel Mary Elizabeth Bannerman. When his father succeeded to the earldom in 1905 he was styled Lord Carnegie as the eldest son of the Earl of Southesk. Lord Carnegie was educated at Eton College. He later joined the British Army and received a commission in the Scots Guard. In 1917, he served as an aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India. On 12 November 1923 he married Princess Maud at the Royal Military Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London. Princess Maud was the younger daughter of the Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife and Louise, Princess Royal. Following their marriage, Princess Maud ceased to use the title of princess and the style Highness (though she was still legally entitled to them) and was known as Lady Maud Carnegie.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34279/supplement/2773 Together the couple had one child, James George Alexander Bannerman Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife, 12th Earl of Southesk (23 September 1929 \u2013 22 June 2015). Lord Carnegie was a near neighbour of Archibald Maule Ramsay, living in Arbroath, and joined the Right Club, an anti-semitic group with Nazi sympathies, which had been set up by Ramsay, contributing \u00a35 and promising a further \u00a35 annually; he was made a 'Warden' of the club by Ramsay. Asked about his membership in later life, Southesk professed ignorance of all the aims of the club but praised Ramsay as \"a very loyal, patriotic man\".Richard Griffiths, \"Patriotism Perverted: Captain Ramsay, the Right Club and British Anti-Semitism 1939-40\" (Constable, London 1998), p. 160 ==Earl of Southesk== The 10th Earl of Southesk died on 10 November 1941 and Lord Carnegie became the 11th Earl of Southesk. Although they did not carry out royal duties, Lord and Lady Southesk were considered members of the Royal Family. They both attended the coronation of King George VI, Maud's cousin, and other state occasions. ==Second marriage== Maud died in 1945 from bronchitis. Lord Southesk later married Evelyn Julia Williams-Freeman (27 July 1909 \u2013 30 August 1992) on 16 May 1952 at Scone Palace in Perthshire, Scotland. Evelyn was previously married to Major Ion Edward FitzGerald Campbell and had a son, Ion Edward Fitzgerald Campbell. ==Death== Lord Southesk died on 16 February 1992 at age 98 in Brechin, Angus, Scotland, having spent the last year of his life as an additional Vice-President of the Conservative Monday Club, of which he had long been a member. His eldest son, James, had already inherited the title of Duke of Fife from his aunt, Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife. The title of Earl of Southesk is as a subsidiary title of the Duke of Fife, and is used by the 11th Earl's great-grandson, Charles Carnegie, Earl of Southesk. == Honours== *Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order - 1926 ==References== * Copping, Robert, The Monday Club - Crisis and After May 1975, page 25, published by the Current Affairs Information Service, Ilford, Essex, (P/B). ==External links== * Category:1893 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Earls of Southesk Category:Knights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Scots Guards officers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Angus Category:People educated at Eton College ",
