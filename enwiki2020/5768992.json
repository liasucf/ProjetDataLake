    "text": "Sonnet 27 is one of 154 sonnets published by William Shakespeare in a quarto titled Shakespeare's Sonnets in 1609. It is a part of the Fair Youth group of sonnets, and the first in a group of five sonnets that portray the poet in solitude and meditating from a distance on the young man. A theme of the first two of the group (sonnets 27 - 28) regards the night and restlessness, which is a motif also found in the sonnets of Petrarch.Shakespeare, William. Duncan- Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 164 . ==Analysis== In Sonnet 27 the weary poet cannot find rest \u2014 not day or night. He goes to bed weary after working hard, which is the \"toil\" of line one, and the \"travail\" of line three. As soon as he lies down, another journey begins in his thoughts (\"To work my mind\") \u2014 the destination is the young man, who is far from where the poet is (\"from far where I abide\"). The poet's thoughts take that journey, and though he sees nothing but the darkness of night, his imagination presents to him an image of the young man, an image that seems to hang before him in the dark, like a jewel. This vision makes the \"black night\" beautiful \u2014 the word \"black\" is equated with ugliness and \"night\" has a feminine aspect. The reader is led to expect this vision to improve the poet's lot, but the final couplet suggests that it only adds to the restless misery of the weary poet, and \"no quiet\" can the poet find.Shakespeare, William.
