He promises to marry every woman he flirts with, however, secretly, he has sworn to stay a bachelor forever. One day, he meets a mysterious woman, Shivani Dutt (Vipasha Agarwal) on his balcony who claims that his apartment is actually hers. Raj is instantly smitten with her. However, it turns out that he is the only one who can see her and touch her. To everyone else, it seems as if he talks to himself and is slowly going mental. His friends tell Raj to let go, but Raj refuses, as he has fallen in love with the ghost woman. He finds out that Shivani is actually lying in a hospital in a coma, and her life support is about to be cut off. Raj decides to save her and brings her comatose body to his apartment to look after it. Shivani's doctor wants to kill her as she has witnessed an illegal operation where a kidney was removed and the doctor wants to save himself. Shivani finally admits that she has fallen in love with Raj, but Inspector Smith is on his trail and finally finds out what happened to Shivani's body - and also discovers the doctor's organ trafficking. Soon afterward, Shivani awakens from her coma and doesn't remember Raj or the time she has spent with him as a ghost at all.
