    "text": "The qualification event of the 2015 World Wheelchair Curling Championship was held from November 1 to 6, 2014 at the Lillehammer Curling Club in Lillehammer, Norway. The qualification event was open to any World Curling Federation member nation not already qualified for the World Championship. The event's two top finishers, Norway and Germany, will join the top eight finishers from the last World Wheelchair Curling Championship at this season's event in Lohja, Finland. This event would have marked the first appearance of Israel at an international wheelchair curling event, but Israel was deemed ineligible to play due to an inability to meet classification criteria. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| |- | Skip: Ivan Shopov Third: Svetozar Kirov Second: Pavel Savov Lead: Joanna Koldova Alternate: Neli Sabeva Coach: Nikolay Runtov | Skip: Radek Mus\u00edlek Third: Martin Tluk Second: Stepan Benes Lead: Jana B\u0159in\u010dilov\u00e1 Alternate: \u017daneta Schmuttermeierov\u00e1 Coach: Kate\u0159ina Urbanov\u00e1 | Skip: Preben Granh\u00f8j Nielsen Third: Henrik Harlev Second: Helena Skovgaard Lead: Rene Graff Coach: Kasper Poulsen | Skip: Jens J\u00e4ger Third: Christiane Putzich Second: Martin Schlitt Lead: Heike Melchior Alternate: Robert Hering Coach: Bernd Weisser |- !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| |- | Did not start Skip: Tzipi Zipper Third: David Drai Second: Shachar Levi Lead: Albert Zohar | Fourth: Egidio Marchese Skip: Emanuele Spelorzi Second: Sergio Deflorian Lead: Angela Menardi Alternate: Rita Dal Monte Coach: Roberto Maino | Skip: Takashi Sakataya Third: Kazuhiro Kashiwabara Second: Tsutomu Iwata Lead: Kana Matsuda Alternate: Sanae Aso Coach: Tsutomu Kobayashi | Skip: Oj\u0101rs Briedis Third: Po\u013cina Ro\u017ekova Second: Ilm\u0101rs Nicmanis Lead: Agris Lasmans Alternate: Sergejs \u010cerni\u0161evs Coach: Artis Zentelis |- !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| !width=200| |- | Skip: Rune Lorentsen Third: Jostein Stordahl Second: Sissel L\u00f8chen Lead: Terje Rafdal Alternate: Ole Fredrik Syversen Coach: Per Andreassen | Skip: Robert Zerovnik Third: Ziga Badje Second: Milan Zlobko Lead: Mojca Burger Alternate: Ziva Hribar Coach: Gregor Verbinc | Skip: Kim Jong-pan Third: Seo Soon-seok Second: Jung Seung-won Lead: Yun Hee-kyeong Alternate: Yang Hui-tae Coach: Shin Kyung-yong | Skip: Felix Wagner Third: Eric Decorvet Second: Claudia H\u00fcttenmoser Lead: Ivo Hasler Alternate: Mireille Gauthey Coach: Stephan Pfister |} ==Round robin standings== Final Round Robin Standings {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=2|Key |- | style=\"background:#ffffcc; width:20px;\"| |align=left|Teams to Playoffs |} {| table |valign=top width=10%| {| class=wikitable |- !width=150| Red Group !!
