    "text": "The Romanian Socialist Party () was a minor Romanian political party with a socialist ideology. It was briefly represented in the Romanian Parliament after two deputies, elected on the Greater Romania Party list, joined the organisation in 2002. The two MPs would leave the party the following year in order to create the United Socialist Party. In the 2008 elections, it won 0.01% of the vote in the Chamber of Deputies and 0.02% in the Senate. In 2015 the party name was taken over by the Socialist Alliance Party after the Bucharest Tribunal wrote the party out of the official register of political parties. ==Electoral history== ===Legislative elections=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election ! colspan=\"3\" |Chamber ! colspan=\"3\" |Senate ! rowspan=\"2\" |Position ! rowspan=\"2\" |Aftermath |- !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats |- !1992 |colspan=8; style=\"text-align: center;\"|did not compete |- !1996 |9,103 |0.07 | |18,834 |0.15 | |style=\"text-align: center;\"|29th | |- !2000 |11,916 |0.11 | |12,961 |0.12 | |style=\"text-align: center;\"|26th | |- !rowspan=2|2004 |rowspan=2|28,034 |rowspan=2|0.28 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|42,306 |rowspan=2|0.41 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2; style=\"text-align: center;\"|12th | |- | |- !rowspan=3|2008 |rowspan=3|585 |rowspan=3|0.00 |rowspan=3| |rowspan=3|445 |rowspan=3|0.02 |rowspan=3| |rowspan=3; style=\"text-align: center;\"|9th | government (until December 2009) |- | (until May 2012) |- | (until December 2012) |- !2012 |colspan=8; style=\"text-align: center;\"|did not compete |} ==See also== *Romanian Communist Party (present-day) *Romanian Socialist Party (present-day) ==References== Category:1992 establishments in Romania Category:Defunct socialist parties in Romania Category:Democratic socialist parties in Europe Category:Political parties established in 1992 Category:Pro- European political parties ",
