It has between three and six large, egg-shaped leaves and up to ten dull pink and white resupinate flowers that are hairy on the outside. == Description == Goodyera rubicunda is a tuberous, perennial herb with between three and six dark green leaves, long and wide, sometimes with a reddish tinge. Between ten and twenty resupinate, dull pink and white flowers, long and wide are borne on a brittle flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, curved and spread apart from each other. The petals are long, about wide and almost translucent. The labellum is white or cream-coloured, long, wide with inward-pointing hairs on the inside. Flowering occurs from September to October in Australia. ==Taxonomy and naming== The giant jewel orchid was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume who gave it the name Neottia rubicunda and published the description in Bijdragen tot de Flora van Nederlandsch Indie. In 1839, John Lindley changed the name to Goodyera rubicunda. The specific epithet (rubicunda) is a Latin word meaning \"reddish\", \"ruddy\" or \"red\". ==Distribution and habitat== Goodyera rubicunda grows in damp places in forest. It is found in China north-eastern India, Indonesia, Japan (including the Ryukyu Islands), Malaysia, New Guinea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Queensland and some Pacific islands. ==References== == External links == * Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of China Category:Orchids of India Category:Orchids of Indonesia Category:Orchids of Japan Category:Orchids of Malaysia Category:Orchids of New Guinea Category:Orchids of the Philippines Category:Orchids of Vietnam Category:Plants described in 1825 rubicunda ",
