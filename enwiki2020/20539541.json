The seat was created ahead of the Assembly's first election held in 1856, and was abolished at the 1903 election, when it was merged with the neighbouring seats of Campbell Town and the northern part of Glamorgan into the new district of Cambria. ==Members for Oatlands== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Member!!Term |- | Henry Anstey | 1856\u20131859 |- | James MacLanachan | 1859\u20131862 |- | James Lord | 1862\u20131871 |- | George Wilson | 1871\u20131876 |- | Alfred Pillinger | 1876\u20131899 |- | William Burbury | 1899\u20131903 |} ==References== * * * Parliament of Tasmania (2006).
