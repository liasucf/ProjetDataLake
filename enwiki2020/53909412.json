Standard marches by the band include March of the Tajik Army and Farewell of Slavianka. The Air Force, National Guard, and the Internal Troops also maintain military bands in the country. The bands of regional garrisons (the Band of the Dushanbe Garrison for example) also provide musical support to the armed forces and like the band, are part of the Commandant's Regiment. ==Origins== Tajik military bands follow the Russian and Persian precedent for military bands while adding traditional Central Asian instruments such as the Karnay (specifically the Muiuz kernei). Although many military bands in Tajikistan were formed from former Soviet military bands based in the Tajik SSR, they have for the most part been relocated to neighboring countries and to Russia. An example of this is the Band of the 201st Motor Rifle Division, which was for many years prior to independence the main military band in the country. The present day band was founded by order of the Tajik Cabinet on 26 August 1994. The repertoire of the band consists of the national anthems of foreign countries as well as military music. == Structure == * Marching Band * Concert Band * Fanfare Team * Karnay Ensemble * Wind Ensemble * Big Band Although officially part of the Tajik National Army, the band is a directly reporting unit of the Ministry of Defence, specifically its commandant's regiment. == Activities == The band is more often than not, at a public event, usually participating in many military and civilian settings. === Scheduled ceremonies === * Welcoming Ceremonies: Held in the Palace of Nations in Dushanbe.
