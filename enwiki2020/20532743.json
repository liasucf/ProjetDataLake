The Foundation provides administrative, governance, public relations and marketing support for four affiliate foundations. These affiliates include: * Attica Community Foundation * Covington Community Foundation * Southeast Fountain Community Foundation * Vermillion County Community Foundation In Fountain County, each affiliate serves the geographic area of the local school district, but has no formal associations with the school corporations. == Foundation characteristics == The six main characteristics of the Western Indiana Community Foundation are: # Act as a grant-making foundation: Give grants to support community projects including: arts, culture and historic preservation, parks and recreation, education and scholarships, faith, senior citizen and youth activities. # Broadly defined mission: Improve the quality of life in Fountain County and Vermillion County, IN. # Serve geographically defined areas: The Attica Community Foundation serves the Attica community and its surrounding townships of Davis, Logan and Shawnee; Covington Community Foundation serves the Covington community and its surrounding townships of Fulton, Mound, Troy and Wabash; Southeast Fountain Community Foundation serves the communities of Hillsboro, Kingman, Mellott, Newtown, Veedersburg, and Wallace, and the townships of Cain, Jackson, Mill Creek, Richland and Van Buren.
