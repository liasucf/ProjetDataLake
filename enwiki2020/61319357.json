    "text": "The Lateish Show with Mo Gilligan is a British late-night talk show that is broadcast on Channel 4. The show is hosted by British comedian Mo Gilligan. It airs on Fridays at 10 p.m. and began on 19 July 2019. Similar to other late night talk shows, the programme includes a house band, live audience and comedy sketches as well as interviews with celebrities and other guests. The show took inspiration from the 1990s entertainment show TFI Friday. == History == In August 2018, Channel 4 commissioned the programme for six episodes, originally under the name Mo's Show. Gilligan said that the show had been under development for two years prior to its announcement. The show was produced by Expectation and Momo G. Gilligan is a stand-up comedian. His first presenting experience was as co-host with rapper Big Narstie on The Big Narstie Show, which premiered in June 2018. As creator, associate producer and writer, Gilligan also had involvement in all aspects of the show's production, including conceiving of many of the sketches and ideas. == Reception == The Guardian reviewers Ellen E Jones and Jack Seale both praised Gilligan's confidence in hosting. Seale described the format as \"mixing eclectic lineups with musical and comic set pieces in a way that is fresh without being revolutionary\". However, Jones found the sketches \"hit and miss\". In 2020, the show had won a BAFTA in the \"Entertainment Performance\" category. ==References== Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2010s British television talk shows Category:Channel 4 talk shows Category:English- language television shows ",
