Accessed February 26, 2018. ==Reception== In his review on AllMusic, Scott Yanow writes: \"Although veteran tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards was having serious health problems by 2001, he is in excellent form throughout this set, showing no signs of decline or age. Playing in New York with a top-notch quartet that includes pianist Richard Wyands, Edwards caresses some of the melodies (his long tones are impressive), he swings hard in spots, and he shows great affection for the material. ... Throughout, Teddy Edwards shows that in 2001 he was still in his musical prime.\" On All About Jazz, Terrell Kent Holmes called it \"a fine example of economical playing and arrangement\" and noted \"Edwards, now approaching 80 years old, shows on Smooth Sailing that he's as formidable a sax man as ever. More power to any septuagenerian who swings.\"Holmes, T.
