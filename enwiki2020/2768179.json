For a period prior to and during the Iraq War, he registered under the U.S. Department of Justice's Foreign Agents Registration Act, for his work on behalf of a Lebanese politician and industrialist. He promoted the peace process, vocational training for the building trades, English and French-language instruction, and extending microcredit. He registered on advice of counsel and has since deregistered. Continuing his work on the peace process, he participated in work of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation. As an example: Imagining the Next War. The foundation sponsors individuals for \"scholarly research on violence, aggression, and dominance.\" In 2006, Lang was appointed to the foundation's board of directors.

In 2004, he wrote that members of the Bush Administration manipulated intelligence analysis to strengthen the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Lang has written and discussed the 2006 Lebanon War, in which he described the Hezbollah defense as a defensive belt which he called the \"Tabouleh Line\". In an interview with Helena Cobban, he said: > A basic lesson of history is that one must win on the battlefield to dictate > the peace. A proof of winning on the battlefield has always been possession > of that battlefield when the shooting stops. Those who remain on the field > are just about always believed to have been victorious. Those who leave the > field are believed to be the defeated.'Just World News' with Helena Cobban: > Lebanese war; post-war; role of UNIFIL ===Iraq and the Middle East=== In 2006, Lang said that he thought an American attack on Iran would have deadly repercussions on U.S. occupation troops in Iraq. He noted that \"troops all over central and northern Iraq are supplied with fuel, food, and ammunition by truck convoy from a supply base hundreds of miles away in Kuwait. All but a small amount of our soldiers' supplies come into the country over roads that pass through the Shiite-dominated south of Iraq.\" Iraqi Shiia could easily interdict these supplies, not easily replaced by air, once hostilities start.\"The vulnerable line of supply to US troops in Iraq\", Christian Science Monitor, 21 July 2006 ===Conflict with Iran=== In an interview in 2007, he stated that \"the U.S. has no plans to bomb Iran,\" to mean that intensive planning is at an advanced stage but no final decision has been made to push the button. He said the forces are largely in place. The bombing could be carried out by naval air from the aircraft carriers in place, missiles from the screening ships of the carrier groups, and air force assets. He said there is dissent in the U.S. administration at high levels whether to bomb Iran, and it is possible for high level resignations to occur even in the uniformed services. He said the concentration of forces has a dual purpose, to prod Iran toward serious negotiations and to be there as a resort if negotiations fail.\"Interview, W. Patrick Lang\", CNN, ===Personal blog=== In 2005 he started his blog, Sic Semper Tyrannis (A Committee of Correspondence).http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/ The main foci of the blog are current affairs and politics, with special emphasis on foreign policy, the military, intelligence and the ME. More recently he published two articles of his memoirs in military intelligence.http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2015/01/yemen- arizona- in-1870-reborn.htmlhttp://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2015/05/ap- bu-nho-a-remembrance-on-memorial-day.html ===Historical fiction=== Based on his experience in the military and military intelligence and a lifelong interest in the American Civil War, Patrick Lang wrote three novels set in the American Civil War. The trilogy is called: \"Strike The Tent: A Tale Of The Confederate Secret Services\". His main character is Confederate agent Claude Devereux around whom the historical events unfold. The first volume, The Butchers Cleaver, was published in 2007. In this book Claude Devereux, who like his whole family in Alexandria does neither support slavery nor secession, is forced by events into his role as Confederate agent. The second volume, Death Piled Hard, was published in 2009. Devereux's brother Patrick is killed at Gettysburg. But there is not much time to mourn for Claude Devereux, who is slowly finding his way into command circles behind enemy lines. The third volume, Down the Skies', was published in 2012. Confederate spy Devereux, by now Brigadier General of the Volunteer Union Forces, not only gained the confidence of president Lincoln but is also getting deeper and deeper insights into the whole administration. But he is suspected of disloyalty, and the Union's Counter-intelligence is on high alert. ==Legacy and honors== Defense Superior Service Medal (with Oak Leaf Cluster) Legion of Merit 60px Bronze Star (with Oak Leaf Cluster) Meritorious Service Medal (with two Oak Leaf Clusters) 60px Army Commendation Medal (with valor) 60px Joint Service Commendation Medal 70px Expert Infantryman Badge 70pxSenior Parachutist Badge 70pxSpecial Forces Tab ==Books== *Intelligence: The Human Factor, Chelsea House Publishers, Philadelphia, PA, 2004 \u2013 a social sciences textbook on Human Intelligence Collection Operations (HUMINT).
