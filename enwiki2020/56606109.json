The bridge forms part of a one-way system along with the neighbouring Governor's Bridge. Together they connect the Stranmillis and Annadale Embankments, with King's Bridge carrying traffic from the former to the latter. ==References== Category:Bridges in Northern Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in Belfast Category:Bridges completed in 1910 ",
