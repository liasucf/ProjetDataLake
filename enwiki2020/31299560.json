    "text": "The Pacific Coast International League was a Class-B league in Minor League Baseball that played between 1918 and 1922, based in the Northwest United States and British Columbia. The league was a re-branding of the former Northwestern League and was briefly known as the Northwest International League in 1919. In 1922, the name was changed to the Western International League. Teams in the league included the Aberdeen Black Cats, Portland Buckaroos, Seattle Giants, Spokane Indians, Tacoma Tigers, Vancouver Beavers, Victoria Islanders and Yakima Indians. As the Northwest International League, it consisted of two Washington-based teams and two Canada-based teams: the Seattle Drydockers, Tacoma Tigers, Vancouver Beavers and Victoria Tyrees. On June 8, the league disbanded, with the Beavers in first place. Therefore, they were the de facto league champions. The Tigers finished in last place with a 5-17 record. Wally Hood, who played in the major leagues from 1920 to 1922, spent time in the league. ==External links== *Baseball Reference Category:Defunct baseball leagues in the United States Category:Sports leagues established in 1918 Category:Baseball leagues in Washington (state) Category:Defunct minor baseball leagues in the United States ",
