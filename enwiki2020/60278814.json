    "text": "Joe Rose (1965/1966 \u2014 March 19, 1989) was a Canadian LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS activist whose homophobic murder was a pivotal moment for the LGBT rights movement in Quebec. ==Background== While attending Dawson College, Rose founded Etcetera, the college's LGBT association, in 1985.\"Stabbing victim was dying of AIDS; Friends say killing part of recent wave of attacks on gays\". Montreal Gazette, March 21, 1989. Rose studied nursing, and as a person living with AIDS, he wanted to found a Montreal chapter of ACT UP. ==Murder== On March 19, 1989, he and a friend were travelling on a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de la Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al (STCUM) night bus returning to his home in an HIV/AIDS hospice. Rose, who was slight in build and disabled by AIDS symptoms, and who dyed his hair pink, was set upon along with the friend by a group of four youths shouting homophobic slurs.\"Pink hair and leather cost Joe Rose his life\". Edmonton Journal, March 22, 1989. They beat and stabbed him to death inside the bus. His friend suffered minor injuries; when emergency personnel arrived, they found him trying to resuscitate Rose. Three minors, aged 14, 15, and 15, and Patrick Moise, aged 19, were ultimately charged and convicted in Rose's death. The youths were sentenced to varying terms in youth custody;\"Boys guilty in Montreal bus killings\". Toronto Star, July 9, 1989. Moise was sentenced to 7 years in prison.\"Man jailed for killing gay activist\". Windsor Star, March 7, 1990. Rose's parents sued the STCUM for the driver's failure to activate the emergency signal,\"MUCTC sued for fatal attack aboard bus\". Montreal Gazette, March 16, 1990. and were awarded $25,000.\"Family of slain man wins Montreal lawsuit\". Edmonton Journal, March 23, 1996. ==Impact== The murder was one of several around that time which forced the STCUM to review and revise its emergency safety procedures,\"Knives banned from buses, Metro as security boosted\". Montreal Gazette, July 14, 1989. and one of several which led the federal government to toughen penalties under the Young Offenders Act.\"Ottawa to toughen laws covering violent juveniles; Murder penalty to increase, elevation to adult courts made easier under Young Offenders Act\". Montreal Gazette, December 21, 1989. Rose's father, Maurice Rose, felt that even the changes still did not go far enough, and was active for several years in lobbying to toughen penalties even further.\"Toughening sentences for young offenders; Changes don't go far enough, father of slain gay activist tells MPs\". Montreal Gazette, October 21, 1994. The murder galvanized the Montreal LGBT community. In May, McGill University's CKUT-FM devoted a special 15-hour broadcast to programming about homophobia,\"Gay activist's slaying sparks day of radio\". Toronto Star, May 15, 1989. and Rose was remembered during a noteworthy protest, led by ACT UP, of the Fifth International AIDS Conference in Montreal in June 1989. This led to the founding of the Montreal chapter of ACT UP, as Rose had wanted. Its first public activist event was a \"die-in\" protest commemorating the first anniversary of Rose's death.\"Symbolic death ritual\". Montreal Gazette, March 20, 1990. A Montreal chapter of Queer Nation was also founded under the name Queer Nation Rose, both as a way of making the name bilingual and as a tribute to Rose.\"Candles burn to mourn gay activist; Vigil on Tuesday marks anniversary of Joe Rose's death\". Montreal Gazette, March 16, 1991. The organizing that went on in response to Rose's murder laid the groundwork for the outraged community response to the Sex Garage raids in June 1990, another watershed moment in the Quebec LGBT rights movement.\"Police raid unites the gay community in a wave of protest\". Montreal Gazette, July 31, 1990. An ACT UP meeting held in response led to the formation of multiple community groups that formed the foundation of the LGBT rights movement in Quebec over the ensuing decades, including the holding of Quebec Human Rights Commission hearings about homophobic violence in 1994 and the introduction of benefits for same-sex partners in 1999. The Etcetera association at Dawson College honoured Rose with a commemorative plaque in 2013, and the 30th anniversary of his death was commemorated in 2019. ==Cultural depictions== Rose's murder was the inspiration for John Wojewoda's theatrical play Swarming, which premiered at the Montreal Fringe Festival in 1993.\"Play's statement about gay-bashing is angry, disturbing and explicit\". Montreal Gazette, November 19, 1993. It was one of several murders of gay men in Montreal which were profiled in the 1994 CBC Television documentary Climate for Murder.\"Chilling view of city; Documentary film examines deaths of 17 gay men\". Montreal Gazette, July 7, 1994. Author Michael Whatling named his 2009 short story collection about being out in high school, A Vigil for Joe Rose, in his honour.\"Of Ghosts and Gay Youth: Michael Whatling's A Vigil for Joe Rose\". Journal of LGBT Youth, 8 (3), 2011, 281-284. ==References== Category:LGBT rights activists from Canada Category:1989 deaths Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:People with HIV/AIDS Category:Canadian victims of anti-LGBT hate crimes Category:Deaths by beating Category:Deaths by stabbing Category:People murdered in Quebec Category:1989 crimes in Canada Category:1989 murders in North America Category:1980s murders in Canada Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
