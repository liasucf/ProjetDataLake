    "text": "The Eight Principles of Yong (; , eiji happ\u014d; , Yeongjapalbeop) explain how to write eight common strokes in regular script which are found all in the one character, (, \"forever\", \"permanence\"). It was traditionally believed that the frequent practice of these principles as a beginning calligrapher could ensure beauty in one's writing. The Eight Principles are influenced by the earlier Seven Powers () by Lady Wei Shuo () of Eastern Jin. Publications on the Principles include: * The Praise to the Eight Principles of \"Yong\" () by Liu Zongyuan () of the Tang Dynasty. * Explanations to the Eight Principles of \"Yong\" () by Li Puguang () of the Yuan Dynasty. L\u01d0 provided two-character metaphorical names. == Table of naming usages == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of Y\u01d2ngz\u00ec principles (by stroke order) ! !! Stroke !! Name !
