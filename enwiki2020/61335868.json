    "text": "The Neoloy Geocell (previously under the Neoweb trademark) is a Cellular Confinement System (geocell) developed and manufactured by PRS Geo- Technologies Ltd. Composed of ultrasonically welded strips, Geocells are opened up on-site to form a 3D honeycomb-like matrix, which is then filled with granular soil material to create a soil stabilization / road reinforcement system. In addition to reinforcement of the subgrade, subbase or base layer of roads and railways, cellular confinement is also used for soil stabilization and erosion control in slopes, channels, retention walls, reservoirs and landfills. Neoloy Geocells are manufactured from Neoloy, a novel polymeric alloy (NPA). This material provides high dynamic stiffness (elastic modulus), resistance to permanent deformation (creep) and tensile strength.Alexiew, D. and van Zyl, W. (2019).

The objectives of this comprehensive research was to understand the mechanisms and influencing factors of geocell reinforcement, evaluate its effectiveness in improving roadway performance and develop design methods for roadway applications. This research - over 75 published papers on Neoloy Geocells \\- included laboratory box tests, accelerated moving wheel tests, field demonstration and development of design methods. Comparative test results that Neoloy Geocells made from NPA had the highest improvement in stiffness, bearing capacity, stress distribution and reduced deformation (Pokharel, et al. 2011 and 2009).Pokharel, S.K. , Han J., Leshchinsky, D., Parsons, R.L., Halahmi, I.

Applicable for new road construction, as well as for rehabilitation, Neoloy Geocells are typically used to reinforce the base and subbase layers of pavement types, such as highways, railways, intermodal ports, storage yards and unpaved haul, access and service roads. One notable unpaved road project was undertaken by the UK Royal Engineering Corps Route Trident under difficult conditions in Afghanistan to create a secure patrol road for the benefit of troops and civilians alike. ==Design methodologies== Research includes the development of road design methodologies for Neoloy Geocells.Kief, O. (2015b). \u201cStructural Pavement Design with Geocells made of Novel Polymeric Alloy.\u201d Geosynthetics 2015 Conference Proceedings. Portland, Oregon, February. In particular, a Modulus Improvement Factor (MIF), verified in research and field demos was developed as a reliable method for quantifying the Neoloy Geocell contribution to a pavement structure. The MIF value obtained from field tests, laboratory tests and finite element studies varies between 1.5-5 dependent upon the material of infill, subgrade and location of reinforced layer. ==Sustainable transportation== Neoloy Geocells are considered a sustainable road construction methodPokharel, S.K., Norouzi, M., Martin, I. and Breault, M. (2016). Sustainable road construction for heavy traffic using high strength polymeric geocells. Canadian Society of Civil Engineers annual conference on Resilient Infrastructure June 1-4, 2016 London Ontario. as by improving the structural properties of low strength materials, they enable the replacement of quarry aggregate with lower cost lower quality granular infill materials. These lower quality materials include locally available but weak soils, sand; recycled and reclaimed construction materials, such as RAP and recycled concrete. Not only does the use of such materials in road construction conserve quarry resources and recycle waste. It also reduces quarry, haul and infill activities, which in turn decreases the amounts of fuel, pollution and the carbon footprint.Norouzi, M., Pokharel, S.K., Breault, M., and Breault, D. (2017). Innovative Solution for Sustainable Road Construction. Leadership in Sustainable Infrastructure Conference Proceedings. May 31-June 3, Vancouver, Canada. Neoloy Geocell reinforcement can also increase the lifespan of pavement structures, which means less repairs and maintenance, further enhancing sustainability. ==How it works== When Neoloy Geocells are deployed and compacted with soil/aggregate, a composite structure is created from the geotechnical interaction of the material, soil and geometry.Alexiew, D. and van Zyl, W. (2019). Cellular Confinement System Reinforcement \u2013 Innovation at the Base of Sustainable Pavements. 12th Conference on Asphalt Pavements for Southern Africa, Johannesburg. Soil confinement retains infill materials in three dimensions providing high tensile strength on each axis. Under loading Neoloy Geocells generate lateral confinement while soil-to-cell wall friction reduces vertical movement. The high hoop strength of the cell walls, together with the passive earth and passive resistance of adjacent cells, also increases soil strength and stiffness. Aggregate abrasion is minimized by the cell confinement, thereby reducing attrition of the base material. Vertical loading on Neoloy Geocells with compacted infill creates a semi-rigid slab or \"beam effect\" in the structure.Vega, E., van Gurp, C., Kwast, E. (2018). Geokunststoffen als Funderingswapening in Ongebonden Funderingslagen (Geosynthetics for Reinforcement of Unbound Base and Subbase Pavement Layers), SBRCURnet (CROW), Netherlands. This distributes the load evenly and effectively over a wider area, thereby increasing bearing capacity and decreasing differential settlement. Research of the reinforcement mechanisms in geocells shows that the stiffness of the geocell material as well as geometry are the most important confinement parameters.Emersleben A., Meyer M. (2009). Interaction Between Hoop Stresses and Passive Earth Resistance in Single and Multiple Geocell Structures, GIGSA GeoAfrica 2009 Conference, Cape Town, South Africa, September 2\u20135 ==Environmental durability== Neoloy Geocells are a non- corrosive, inert engineering thermoplastic resistant to extreme environmental conditions, heat, cold, water, wind and dust. Effective service temperature is -60 \u00b0C to +60 \u00b0C, and they have been used in environments from deserts to saturated peat bogs to arctic tundra. Special additives and manufacturing processes provide Neoloy Geocells with long-term environmental durability from UV radiation / oxidation, during outdoor storage, installation and long-term project design-life. ==See also== * Cellular Confinement Systems (geocells) * Route TRIDENT * Geosynthetics ==References== Category:Geosynthetics ",
