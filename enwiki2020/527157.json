    "text": "{| |} Nordmark (later Northmark) was a former Kriegsmarine (German navy) combination oiler and supply vessel which was allocated to the Royal Navy by the Inter-Allied Repatriations Commission when British forces entered Copenhagen on 9 May 1945. ==Construction== The ship was laid down at the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Elning East Prussia (now Elbl\u0105g, Poland) on 14 November 1936, and was launched on 5 October 1937 with the name Westerwald. and was completed on 6 January 1939. She arrived at Rosyth on 8 August 1945 and the following month went to Hebburn-on-Tyne for survey and repairs and conversion for service with the British Pacific Fleet, but the war ended and she was placed in reserve instead. She was renamed Northmark in January 1946 and was considered as a Royal Fleet Auxiliary-manned oiler, but the cost of modifications was considered to be unjustifiable and a follow-up proposal was taken up after approval was given to operate her as a naval ship. She therefore never served as an RFA, but was refitted for service in 1947 and on completion was renamed HMS Bulawayo in July 1947. She served as such until she was scrapped in 1955. ==See also== * USS Conecuh (AOR-110) ==References== * * * ==External links== *One stop replenishment is history Category:Ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Category:1937 ships ",
