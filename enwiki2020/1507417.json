Lightfoot would continue to use these country influences in his music until the early 1980s. Despite its 1972 year of initial release, the album was nominated for and won the 1974 Juno Award for \"Folk Album of the Year\". Lightfoot also won a Juno that year as \"Folk Singer of the Year\".See Juno Awards of 1974. ==Track listing== ===Side 1=== # \"Farewell to Annabel\" \u2013 2:59 # \"That Same Old Obsession\" \u2013 3:46 # \"Old Dan's Records\" \u2013 3:05 # \"Lazy Mornin'\" \u2013 3:43 # \"You Are What I Am\" \u2013 2:37 ===Side 2=== # \"Can't Depend on Love\" \u2013 3:12 # \"My Pony Won't Go\" \u2013 3:50 # \"It's Worth Believin'\" \u2013 3:24 # \"Mother of a Miner's Child\" \u2013 3:18 # \"Hi'way Songs\" \u2013 3:37 All compositions by Lightfoot ==Personnel== * Gordon Lightfoot - Guitar, Vibes * Rick Haynes - Bass * Terry Clements - Guitar * Red Shea - Guitar, Classical guitar, Dobro * Barry Keane - Drums, Percussion * Dave Brown - Percussion * Bruce Good - Autoharp * Larry Good - 5-string Banjo * David Bromberg - Slide Dobro (\"My Pony Won't Go\") * Nick De Caro - Piano, Orchestral arrangements * Ollie Strong - Steel == References == ==External links== *Album lyrics and chords Category:Gordon Lightfoot albums Category:1972 albums Category:Albums produced by Lenny Waronker Category:Reprise Records albums ",
