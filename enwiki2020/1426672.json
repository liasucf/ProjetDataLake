It connects the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley via the San Diego Freeway (I-405) and Sepulveda Boulevard. The crossing experiences heavy traffic (over 330,000 cars a daySherman (CA27) - Op-Eds - ADDRESSING THE VALLEY'S TRANSPORTATION NEEDS NOW) on a regular basis, commonly experiencing major traffic slowdowns lasting hours.Santa Monica Mirror I-405 was widened by Los Angeles Metro, the county's transportation authority.Sepulveda Transit Corridor Project The project took three years to complete and concluded in December 2016.\"Drivers on the 405 Ask: Was $1.6 Billion Worth It?\", The New York Times, December 20, 2016. Additionally, funding has been secured to construct an expansion to Los Angeles's public transportation system through the Sepulveda Pass in the form of a new subway line or monorail, but the plan has not yet been finalized.Sepulveda Transit Corridor Project The Sepulveda Pass on Interstate 405 begins just south of Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley, climbing to just south of Mulholland Drive, then descending to just north of Sunset Boulevard, where I-405 and Sepulveda Boulevard enter the Brentwood and Westwood areas of West Los Angeles. Northbound I-405 has five lanes and a carpool lane (plus a seventh as the Ventura exit is approached), while southbound I-405 has four lanes plus a carpool lane (although on the ascending portion there is a climbing lane). Sepulveda Boulevard has two lanes in each direction and runs west of I-405 until the middle of the pass, where it crosses under and runs east of the freeway. Bel Air Presbyterian Church, founded in 1956, opened its church on Mulholland Drive in 1960.\"History of Bel Air Presbyterian Church\" at Bel Air Presbyterian Church website (accessed March 22, 2010). Beginning with The Westland School in 1965, a number of other educational and cultural institutions have located in the vicinity of Sepulveda Pass, creating an \"institutional corridor\" as an exception to the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan's general prohibition of such development along the crest of the mountains. The institutions along Mulholland Drive now also include Stephen S. Wise Temple, American Jewish University, the Skirball Cultural Center, Milken Community High School, The Mirman School, Berkeley Hall School, and The Curtis School.Jon D.
