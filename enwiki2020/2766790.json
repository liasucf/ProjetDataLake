She was director of the excavations at Toumba tou Skourou, Cyprus, from 1971 to 1974. === Excavation at Toumba tou Skourou === Considered her most significant expectation, Vermeule was the director of an excavation project co-sponsored by the Department of Antiquities of the Republic of Cyprus, Harvard University, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Touma tou Skourou, near Mourphou, Cyprus, was a Late Bronze Age town that Vermeule uncovered which represented three different cultures coming together: Palestinian, Egyptian, and Minoan. Due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Vermeule was forced to abruptly end her excavation and leave the island. This expedition led to her publishing two books about the excavation and the artifacts found, Toumba tou Skourou: The Mound of Darkness (1974) and Toumba tou Skourou: A Bronze Age Potter's Quarter on Morphou Bay in Cyprus (1990). == Awards and honors == Vermeule was awarded the Radcliffe Graduate Society Gold Medal in 1968.
