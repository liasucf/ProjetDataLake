In its incarnation as AM station XETQ-AM, it was at one point a clear-channel station on 850 kHz. ==History== The concession for XETQ was awarded to Francisco Campos H. in 1945, specifying operation at 250 watts on 1370 kHz. It was the third radio station in Orizaba, after the government-owned XEFD and privately owned XEPP. By the 1960s, the low power allotment and frequency were changed, and the small station soon became a clear-channel station on 850 kHz. It was authorized for 100 kW day/50 kW night.XETQ concession, 1969 Sometime in the 1990s, this high power level was dropped in favor of a 10 kW day/1 kW night pattern.XETQ concession, 2004 The AM-FM migration caused XETQ to become XHTQ-FM on 101.3 MHz; XETQ-AM 850 was shut off for good in 2013. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Radio stations in Veracruz ",
