Speaking with Sajae Elder of magazine The Fader \u2013 via email, the singer addressed her decision on why she chose to record the song writing, \"What always draws me back to the Caribbean vibes are the upbeat vibrations of welcoming melodies & positive energy exchange through the rhythms that make you feel like dancing WITH someone, while also commenting in her email, \"No matter the genre, music is a universal language & vibration that people can feel all over.\" \"Handsfree\" was constructed around the \"Caribbean\" genres with a runtime of three minutes and thirty-six seconds. Written by songwriter Zan with production helmed by producers Jonny Blaze, Stadic, and DJ Perf, \"Handsfree\" is a \"bouncy\" riddim song performed in the key of E minor set with a common time of 100 beats per minute. ==Music video== ===Background=== To fully complement the song and its accompanying project, a music video was commissioned. During a visit to the set, M\u00fda briefly chatted with writer Stephanie Lyew of The Star on their decision to film a music video, commenting, \"We both felt the same way about the song when we heard the complete version and decided it deserved a music video.\" For an authentic experience, M\u00fda opted to film her scenes in Kingston, Jamaica, commenting, \"The roots of the song embody Caribbean vibes - Jamaican vibes to be exact - it is always better to be authentic and true to the culture rather than imitating it.\" Directed by local natives Steven \"Streetz\" Bernard and Sadiki Thompson, M\u00fda recorded her solo scenes in Portland early Monday morning while her and featured artist Ding Dong met up in the streets of downtown Kingston to shoot the party scene. At the time of production, the directors and Ding Dong were currently scouting locations to record Ding Dong's solo screentime scenes. Though no release date was given during production, both artists anticipated to release the music video during the summer. ===Synopsis=== The music video opens with a beautiful, serene island setting. Sporting a long redish orange wig and a floral robe attire, M\u00fda chills and sing on her balcony overlooking the beach. Next, she links up with a couple of girlfriends to frolic and have fun on the beach before hooking up with Ding Dong at a hot and sweaty club later that night where they both talk their ish. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Sexting Riddim liner notes. * M\u00fda \u2013 vocals * Ding Dong \u2013 vocals * Jonny Blaze \u2013 production * Stadic \u2013 production * DJ Perf \u2013 production ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !Region !Date !Format !Label ! |- !scope=\"row\"|Various |June 19, 2019 | | | |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:M\u00fda songs ",
