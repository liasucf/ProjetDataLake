He was the son of Wiley Thomas Buchanan (1880\u20131953) and Lilla (n\u00e9e Youngblood) Buchanan (1885\u20131975). Along with his siblings, which included Ava Nell Buchanan Inglish, Kathleen Millie Buchanan Tennison, and Avon Arnold Buchanan, he was a \"Texas cotton, lumber and oil heir.\" His paternal grandparents were James Richard Buchanan, a descendant of President James Buchanan, and Mary Cordelia (n\u00e9e Bohanan) Buchanan, who married William Pittman Sides after his grandfathers death in 1883. Buchanan attended the Terrill School in Dallas, then Southern Methodist University, also in Texas, and George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ==Career== Mr. Buchanan began his government career with a World War II agency called the War Production Board. He later became an official with the National Production Authority in the early 1950s. ===Diplomatic career=== On September 12, 1953, he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Luxembourg by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower to replace fellow Texan and outsize personality and steel heiress Perle Mesta. He presented his credentials on December 1, 1953 and, two years later, when the two countries agreed to raise their respective missions to embassy level, he was promoted, appointed on September 9, 1956, and confirmed (during a recess of the U.S. Senate), as the U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Buchanan left his post in Luxembourg on December 20, 1956. Shortly after returning from Luxemboug, Eisenhower appointed Buchanan became Chief of Protocol, a role designed to assist the international diplomats stationed in the United States. He was protocol chief until January 1961 when John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as President and he was succeeded by Angier Biddle Duke, the former Ambassador to El Salvador and a close friend of Kennedy. In 1959, The Washington Post described Buchanan as follows: > \"What kind of a man is Wiley Buchanan? ... He is of medium height--five > feet, eight and a half inches of shrewd determination... Buchanan has the > same firm lines around his jaw and the same love of hospitality which > characterized his ancestor, the fifteenth President of the United States, > James Buchanan... His formidable fortune, flowing originally from Texas > lumber, cotton, and oil, keeps multiplying through his Washington real > estate foresight.\" After leaving the government, he wrote an amusing memoir in which he candidly discussed his work as head of protocol. The book, Red Carpet at the White House: Four Years as Chief of Protocol in the Eisenhower Administration, was published in 1964. Buchanan was a close friend of Richard Nixon, and contributed to his campaign for president. On March 25, 1975, then President Gerald Ford appointed Buchanan as the U.S. Ambassador to Austria.
