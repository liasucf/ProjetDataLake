It is where Ronnie Kray murdered George Cornell in front of witnesses, and is the location of William Booth's first sermon, which led to the creation of the Salvation Army.

He became the \"Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green\" and used to beg at the crossroads. The story of how he went from landed gentry to poor beggar became popular in the Tudor era, and was revived by Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, published in 1765. The legend came to be adopted in the arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900. ==References== Citations Sources * Category:The Salvation Army Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1894 Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Brewery taps Category:Pubs in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Whitechapel ",
