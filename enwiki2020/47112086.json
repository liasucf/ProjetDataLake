    "text": "The haladie is a double-edged dagger from ancient Syria and India, consisting of two curved blades, each approximately in length, attached to a single hilt. The weapon was used by warriors of the Indian Rajput clans, and was both a stabbing and slicing blade. Some haladie had spikes on one side of the handle in the style of a knuckle duster, while others had a third blade in this position. In some cases the main blades would be serrated. The haladie is believed to be one of the world's first triple-edged blades. ==References== Category:Daggers Category:Rajput culture ",
