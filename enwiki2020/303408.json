    "text": "Chinese characters for tongji Tongji (; T\u00e2i-l\u00f4: t\u00e2ng-ki) or Jitong () is a Chinese folk religious practitioner, usually translated as a \"spirit medium\", \"oracle\", or \"shaman\". This word compounds tong \"child; youth; boy servant\" and ji \"to divine\" (cf. fuji \"divination; planchette writing\"). Regional variants include Hokkien t\u00e2ng-ki and Cantonese gei-tung or san-daa . A tongji or jitong is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular shen \"god; spirit\" as the earthly vehicle for divine expression. The Chinese differentiate a wu \"shaman; healer; spirit medium\" who gains control of forces in the spirit world versus a tongji who appears to be entirely under the control of forces in the spirit world. ==External links and references== * Andersen, Poul. 2008. \"T\u00e2ng-ki (or jitong) (or ) spirit-medium\", in The Encyclopedia of Taoism, ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, pp. 964-966.
