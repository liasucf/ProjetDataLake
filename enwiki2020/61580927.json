    "text": "The Auckland Rugby League was in its 12th season. On 25 March, North Shore Albions held a meeting to discuss whether they should amalgamate with Sunnyside League Football Club, who were also based in Devonport. At a meeting between members of the two clubs the following week they agreed that they would indeed merge. After some debate they decided that the club name would be 'Devonport United' and they would wear green and white broad bands. In addition Grafton and Richmond Rovers amalgamated, while new clubs were also formed in Kingsland (Kingsland Rovers), and at Point Chevalier. First grade games continued to regularly draw large crowds, especially matches involving the likes of Maritime, City Rovers, and Ponsonby United. The round 6 match between Maritime and Ponsonby drew what was thought to be a record crowd for a club Rugby League match in Auckland of 9,000. Maritime would go on to win the first grade title for the first time after a strong season where they won nine games and were only defeated twice. They were awarded the Monteith Shield at the 1921 annual general meeting while Newton Rangers won the Roope Rooster for the second year in a row by defeating Maritime in the final. The highlight of the year was clearly the match between Auckland and the touring England team on 24 July. A crowd of 30,000 packed into the Auckland Domain to witness an Auckland win by 24 points to 16. == Carlaw Park site found == At the end of the season an inspection was made of the site where Carlaw Park would emerge. It was decided that the ground would be named \u2018Carlaw Athletic Park\u2019. The land had been purchased years earlier. It was noted that the site was \u201cexcellently situated for the purpose for which it is intended, and provides sufficient space for two playing grounds. Natural slopes on two sides will give room for a large number of spectators\u2026\u201d. ==Monteith Shield (first grade championship)== Maritime won the first grade title with City Rovers finishing in second position. Three grounds were used for the competition, Victoria Park, the Auckland Domain, and the Devonport Domain. Thirty eight matches were played which was the most in the competitions history to this point. Unlike in previous seasons all clubs were able to survive until the end of the season and fulfill the majority, or all, of their fixture obligations. ===Final standings=== {| |- | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld !width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W !width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D !width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L !width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F !width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A !width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Maritime |11||9||0||2||168||93||18 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|City Rovers |12||8||0||4||270||131||16 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Marist Brothers Old Boys |11||7*||1||3||102||79||15 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Newton Rangers |11||6||1||4||133||132||13 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Devonport United |12||4*||2||6||98||151||10 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ponsonby United |11||2||2||7||125||160||6 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Grafton Athletic |11||1||0||10**||78||228||2 |- |} *Two of Grafton's defeats were by default, while one of Marist's wins and one of Devonport's wins were by default. ===First grade fixtures=== ===Round 1=== ===Round 2=== ===Round 3=== ===Round 4=== ===Round 5=== The match between City and Grafton had the score reported by both the Auckland Star and the New Zealand Herald but had no match report and scoring. The Observor had a brief description of the match where they described one of Karl Ifwersen's \"tries\" indicating he scored at least 2. ===Round 6=== Arthur Cadman was sent off in the Maritime match versus Ponsonby for kicking a Maritime player, while the Auckland Star suggested in their match reports that the 9,000 in attendance was possibly the largest ever Auckland Club Rugby League crowd to attend a match to this point. ===Round 7=== 2 Players were ordered off in the 2nd half of the Maritime versus Newton match. While in the Grafton v Ponsonby match Grafton had two players ordered off including H Neal, and had another injured meaning they finished the match with just 10 players on the field. ===Round 8=== ===Round 9=== ===Round 10=== ===Round 11=== The City v Grafton match resulted in a 66\u201313 win to City but the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald did not report any of the scoring details. Grafton were missing Karl Ifwersen, J Bennett, and Charles Woolley who were on representative duty and could only field 11 players. ===Round 12=== ===Round 13=== ==Roope Rooster knockout competition== The Roope Rooster began on 28 August with 3 first round matches and Ponsonby United receiving a bye. Newton Rangers defeated Maritime in the final for the second consecutive year. ===Round 1=== ===Semi finals=== ===Final=== ==Top try scorers and point scorers== The following point scoring lists include Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition matches only. The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the City Rovers club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over Grafton Athletic, and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise Devonport United was missing scorers for 7 points, Newton Rangers for 13, Maritime for 3, Marist Old Boys for 15, and Grafton Athletic for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or Dougie McGregor. Bill Davidson replicated the feat of his younger brother George of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries |- |1||George Paki||City Rovers||9 |- |1||John McGregor||Maritime||9 |- |3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8 |- |3||Bill Davidson||Devonport United||8 |- |5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6 |- |6||Eric McGregor||Ponsonby United||5 |- |6||Wally Somers||Newton Rangers||5 |- |6||Ernie Herring||Maritime||5 |- |6||Bert Avery||Maritime||5 |- |6||Bill Stormont||Marist||5 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64 |- |2||Craddock Dufty||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57 |- |3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30 |- |4||John McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29 |- |5||George Paki||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27 |- |6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26 |- |7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24 |- |8||Bill Stormont||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21 |- |8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21 |- |10||Maurice Wetherill||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20 |- |10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20 |- |} ==Thacker Shield== Ponsonby United defended the Thacker Shield from Federal (of Christchurch) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators. They had won the shield from Sydenham in Christchurch two years earlier. They had been unable to arrange a defence in the 1919 season. Eventually the shield was to be returned to Christchurch and played for amongst teams in the South Island. ==Other club matches and lower grades== ===Lower grade teams and clubs=== There were 5 lower grades in 1920. Clubs with only lower grade teams were: *Kingsland Rovers *Mangere Rangers *Manukau *Northcote Ramblers *Otahuhu *Point Chevalier *Richmond Rovers *Thames Old Boys Grades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold: *Second Grade: City Rovers, Ponsonby, Mangere, Northcote, Newton, Maritime, Thames Old Boys, Devonport, Devonport B, Marist Old Boys. *Third Grade: Manukau, Newton, Devonport B, Devonport A, Kingsland, Point Chevalier. *Fourth Grade: City Rovers, Manukau, Ponsonby A, Devonport United, Northcote, Maritime, Otahuhu, Kingsland, Richmond, Ellerslie. *Fifth Grade: Manukau, Maritime, Devonport, City, Ponsonby, Northcote, Richmond- Grafton B, Otahuhu, Richmond A. *Sixth Grade: Manukau, City, Ponsonby, Devonport, Maritime. ===Exhibition and benefit matches=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | List of Matches |- | ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" | Attendance |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 29 May || King Country|| 6 || Marist Old Boys || 12 || Taumaranui |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 3 July || Maritime || 31 || Lower Waikato || 20 || Ngaruawahia||2,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 10 July || King Country|| 0 || Devonport United || 15 || Taumarunui |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 14 Aug || Hamilton || 3 || Ponsonby United || 2 || Hamilton |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 18 Sep || Marist Old Boys || 21 || Hamilton || 14 ||Victoria Park||10,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 25 Sep || Devonport United || 8 || King Country || 13 || Devonport Domain |- |} ==Representative fixtures== Auckland played a Rest of New Zealand team as part of the selection process for the New Zealand team to play England. They trounced them by 54 points to 0. They later played a trial match between and A and B team before the Auckland side was selected to play England. The match was played at the Auckland Domain in front of 30,000 spectators. Unfortunately the English halfback fractured his tibia in the first few minutes and they were forced to play with 12 for the remainder of the game as the rules at the time did not allow for substitutions of injured players. ===Auckland v Rest of New Zealand=== ===Auckland trial match=== ===Auckland v England=== ===Auckland representative matches played and scorers=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !No!!Name!!Club Team!!Play!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||2||3||12||0||33 |- |2||Bill Cloke||Newton Rangers||2||4||1||0||12 |- |2||Stan Walters||Devonport United||2||4||0||0||12 |- |4||Wally Somers||Newton Rangers||2||2||0||0||6 |- |5||Charles Woolley||Grafton Athletic||2||1||0||0||3 |- |5||Thomas McClymont||Ponsonby United||2||1||0||0||3 |- |5||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||1||1||0||0||3 |- |5||Bert Avery||Maritime||2||1||0||0||3 |- |9||J Brien||Maritime||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||Eric Grey||Maritime||2||0||0||0||0 |- |9||J Bennett||Grafton Athletic||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||A Thomas||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||J Tait||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||Karl Ifwersen||Grafton Athletic||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||Clarrie Polson||Newton Rangers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||Bill Stormont||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||F Wilson|| City Rovers ||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||Nelson Bass||Newton Rangers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |9||Ivan Stewart||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Auckland Rugby League Official Site Category:Auckland Rugby League seasons Auckland Rugby League ",
