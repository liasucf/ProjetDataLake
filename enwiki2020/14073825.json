    "text": "The Samsung SCH-u470, or Juke and Verizon Wireless Juke, is a mobile phone offered exclusively by Verizon Wireless. It was announced on 2 October 2007, and released that same year on Q4 in three colors: red, teal, and navy (blue). The phone is a music player when closed, and can be swiveled for use of the mobile phone. It also has a VGA-resolution camera with a special \"night shot\" mode for taking photos in low-light conditions. The official song for this phone is \"Juke Box Hero\" by Foreigner. But on the commercial, it was misspelled \"Jukebox Hero\". In Europe, the phone is known as the F210, and is sold under T-Mobile UK and O2 Telecom. In Australia, it was mistakenly titled the Jukebox, until executives clarified the error. ==Features== The basic features of the handset beyond call functionality include an alarm clock, a calculator with tip calculations and unit/currency converter, calendar, stopwatch, world clock, and notepad. The phone allows creating an In Case of Emergency (ICE) contact list for emergency access when the device is locked. The user interface of the Verizon device only has English and Spanish display languages. ===Storage=== The Juke includes 2 GB of internal flash memory, of which up to 22 Mb is available for pictures, ringtones, and sounds, while 1.87 GB is dedicated storage for music only. The phone does not have a microSD card slot, therefore users cannot expand storage beyond what's available. ===Phone and media management=== Over-the-air V CAST music downloads are not available. The handset does rely on V CAST Music Manager software to transfer music to the phone, and that program only supports Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows Media Player 10, but not Mac OS X or any other operating systems. The phone is alternately accessible with BitPim, an open source and multi-platform application to access CDMA phones of various cellphone manufacturers. ===Music player=== The device's audio player supports MP3, Windows Media Audio (WMA and WMA Pro), and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC and AAC+) file types by default, instead of converting all formats to the WMA format, like most other V CAST phones require. Music player features include an equalizer and 3D sound settings, playlist creation and music playback by artist, genre, and album. The music player's UI skin can show a visualizer, album artwork or lyrics. When in use, the music player can mostly work in the background; it pauses for phone calls, but stops for outgoing calls, at app launch, and at music synchronization. ===Messaging=== In addition to text messaging (SMS), the device also utilizes picture messaging, which among other things allows saving received pictures and audio, including setting the latter up as ringtones. The phone supports sending and receiving e-mail. The handset also includes Mobile Instant Messaging, which uses data calls, and supports AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger. It is not known whether any of these protocols are still supported as of 2014; for example, Microsoft is migrating its users from Windows Live Messenger to Skype. Mobile instant messages are charged per Verizon's text messaging plan. ==Operator-dependent features== The phone relies on Verizon's Get It Now application and service for users to buy and download ringtones, images, games, and apps. The service and some applications use datacalls, such as Wikimobile. This could be confused as the Internet, although there appears to be no actual mobile Internet connectivity. GPS functionality can be enabled through a download via Get It Now, and the location chip must be turned on for use. The phone supports what the manufacturer and operator term as advanced voice encryption (the device contains software from RSA). These functions are exclusive to Verizon Wireless. ==References== * Samsung SCH-u470 user manual == External links == U470 Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2007 *[UI]: user interface ",
