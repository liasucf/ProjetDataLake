    "text": "Anepischetosia maccoyi, also known commonly as the highlands forest-skink, highlands forest skink, Maccoy's elf skink, or McCoy's skink, is a species of lizard in the family Scincidae. The species, which is monotypic in the genus Anepischetosia, is endemic to Australia. ==Etymology== The specific name, maccoyi, is in honor of Irish zoologist Frederick McCoy.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Nannoscincus maccoyi, p. 172). ==Taxonomy== The generic name, Anepischetosia, was created by Australian herpetologists Richard W. Wells and C. Ross Wellington in 1985 to replace the generic name, Anepischetos, which was preoccupied by a genus of moths. Anepischetosia is in the subfamily Eugongylinae.\"Anepischetosia \". Dahms Tierleben. https://www.dahmstierleben.de/systematik/Reptilien/Squamata/lacertilia/scincomorpha/scincidae/eugongylinae. (in German). ==Reproduction== A. maccoyi appears to be ovoviviparous. The Reptile Database describes the species as being oviparous. However, Lucas and Frost, in their original description of the species in 1894, wrote, \"Young developed within the body of the parent, eight or nine being brought forth in January or February.\"Lucas AHS, Frost C (1894). ==References== ==Further reading== *Cogger HG (2014).
