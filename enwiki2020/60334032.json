The centre consists of two buildings, FIBES I and FIBES II, which are connected by a footbridge. ==History== In the 1980s, FIBES (an acronym that stands for Feria Iberoamericana de Sevilla, Spanish for Ibero-American Exhibition of Seville), an entity that organized congresses and exhibitions in Seville, promoted a permanent venue for their activities, and in 1989, FIBES moved to the building purposely designed by \u00c1lvaro Navarro Jim\u00e9nez. In September 2012, the centre was expanded with FIBES II, a building designed by Guillermo V\u00e1zquez Consuegra that includes a 3,550-seat auditorium. In 2015, FIBES was dissolved as a society, and the Seville City Council assumed both buildings. ==Description== FIBES I contains three 7,200-square-meter pavilions without any columns intended for exhibitions and trade fairs. FIBES II contains a 3,550-seat auditorium. ==Events== View of the FIBES II auditorium seating. Several social, cultural and industrial fairs are regularly held in the FIBES facilities, as well as national and international congresses.
