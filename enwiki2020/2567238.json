It is the second oldest pub in Cambridge, after the Pickerell Inn. The street frontage, located on the north side of Bene't Street in the centre of the city,Bene't Street: The Eagle pub, Cambridge 2000 is of circa 1600, with a galleried 19th-century wing behind, facing the courtyard. The site is owned by Corpus Christi College and is managed by Greene King brewery. ==History== ===World War II=== The RAF Bar ceiling with graffiti of World War II airmen During the Second World War, Allied airmen, who drank and socialised at The Eagle, used wax candles, petrol lighters and lipstick to write their names, squadron numbers and other doodles onto the ceiling of the rear bar. The tradition is believed to have been started by RAF Flight Sergeant P. E. Turner, who climbed up on the table one night to burn his squadron number on the ceiling. The graffiti, in what is now known as the \"RAF Bar\", was uncovered, deciphered and preserved by former RAF Chief Technician James Chainey during the early 1990s. ===The Announcement of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA=== A blue plaque outside The Eagle When the university's Cavendish Laboratory was still at its old site at nearby Free School Lane, the pub was a popular lunch destination for staff working there. Thus, it became the place where Francis Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime on 28 February 1953 to announce that he and James Watson had \"discovered the secret of life\" after they had come up with their proposal for the structure of DNA.Ed Regis, What Is Life?: Investigating the Nature of Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology, Oxford University Press, 2009, , p.52 The anecdote is related in Watson's book The Double Helix, and is commemorated on a blue plaque next to the entrance, and two plaques in the middle room by the table where Crick and Watson lunched regularly. Today the pub serves a special ale to commemorate the discovery, dubbed \"Eagle's DNA\". Also in 1953 Watson and Crick worked over lunch in the Eagle to draw up a list of the 20 canonical amino acids. This has been a very influential rubric for molecular biology, and was a key development in understanding the protein-coding nature of DNA. == References == Category:Pubs in Cambridge Category:History of Cambridge Category:Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Category:1667 establishments in England ",
