    "text": "Alicia Dickenstein (born 17 January 1955, in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine mathematician known for her work on algebraic geometry, particularly toric geometry, tropical geometry, and their applications to biological systems. She is a full professor at the University of Buenos Aires, a 2019 Fellow of the American Mathematical Society,Class of the Fellows of the AMS, accessed 26 January 2019. a prior vice-president of the International Mathematical Union (2015\u20132018), and a 2015 recipient of The World Academy of Sciences prize. ==Research== Dickenstein is editor-in-chief of the journal Revista de la Uni\u00f3n Matem\u00e1tica Argentina. She is also a corresponding editor for the SIAM Journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry. In 2009-2010, Dickenstein was an Eisenbud professor at MSRI, and in 2012-2013, she was a Simons professor at MSRI. In 2016, Dickenstein was a Knut and Alice Wallenbergs Professor at KTH. Her research focuses on using Algebraic geometry and combinatorics to predict behaviours of Biological systems without knowing precise parameters. She in conjunction with Mercedes Perez Milian has created a system called The MESSI System (named after the footballer, Lionel Messi) which stands for Modifications of the type-Enzyme-Substrate or Swap with Intermediates. This allows researchers to prove general results valid in certain networks. ==Education== Dickenstein obtained her Ph.D. from the Universidad de Buenos Aires in 1982 under Miguel E. M. Herrera.Newsletter European Mathematical Society June 2012 Issue 84 ==Honors== In 2015, Dickenstein received the TWAS Prize from The World Academy of Sciences for the advancement of science in developing countries. In 2018, Dickenstein was elected as a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society for \"contributions to computational algebra and its applications, especially in systems biology, and for global leadership in supporting underrepresented groups in mathematics.\" In 2020 she was named a SIAM Fellow \"for contributions to algebraic geometry and its applications within geometric modeling and in the study of biochemical reaction networks\". ==Children's Books== Dickenstein has produced several books for children, including Mate max: la matem\u00e1tica en todas partes, which presents mathematical problems designed for young children. == References == == External links == *UBA \u2013 Alicia Dickenstein * Category:Living people Category:1955 births Category:Argentine mathematicians Category:University of Buenos Aires faculty Category:Argentine women mathematicians Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Algebraic geometers Category:TWAS laureates Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics ",
