It was largely through a shared interest in magic that Orson Welles became aware of him, and recruited him as an apprentice for Mercury Productions (then based at RKO Pictures). One of his independent films was Inflation (1942), a 15-minute commission for the Office of War Information that was rejected as being anti- capitalist.viewed 9-3-2014. The debacle surrounding the production of The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) ended with the expulsion of the Mercury team from the RKO lot. Endfield signed on as a contract director at MGM where he directed a variety of shorts (including the last films in the long-running Our Gang series), before freelancing on low-budget productions for Monogram and other independents. He served in the Army during World War II. It was with the film noir The Underworld Story (1950), a United Artists independent production, that Endfield first received significant critical and studio attention. The film was a major leap from anything he had previously produced in regards to budget and social commentary, constituting a coruscating attack on press corruption which could equally be taken as a wider attack on the McCarthyite ideology of the times. He followed this with the film often cited as his masterpiece, The Sound of Fury (aka Try And Get Me!) (1950), a lynching thriller based on a true story. Except for the lynching scene, the film was not well received by critics.New York Times It was with these two films that Endfield's signature approach to character developed, pessimistic without being uncompassionate. ==Career in the United Kingdom== In 1951 Endfield was named as a Communist at a HUAC hearing.
