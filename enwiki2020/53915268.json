Crisp is transgender and was born stricken with polio and was subject to the malpractice of multiple doctors resulting in the further disfigurement of her body. She grew up in various foster homes for disabled children. During her childhood, she routinely endured physical and sexual abuse from members of her foster care families largely due to her gender identity and disability. ==Biography== Sandie Crisp was born Johnnie Baima on January 13, 1960. She developed polio as a child and has been disabled ever since. She made her acting debut as \"Charlean\" in the 1986 film Hollywood Vice Squad, and made an appearance in the music video for \"The Dope Show\" by Marilyn Manson. In 1994, she was the subject of a documentary called The Goddess Bunny, directed by Nick Bougas. In the 2020 United States presidential election Crisp announced her candidacy as a write-in candidate for President of the United States. == The Obey the Walrus Video == Due to her severe physical deformity, Sandie became the subject of internet notoriety when a scene from the documentary The Goddess Bunny, which featured her tap dancing, was used in Obedece a la morsa (also known as Obey the Walrus), a viral video that was released in 2005 on eBaum's World and then re-uploaded onto YouTube.Obey the Walrus auf YouTube, 21.
