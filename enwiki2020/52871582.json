It consisted of a series of 50 collectable cigarette cards to commemorate leading first-class cricketers who had played county cricket in the 1927 English cricket season; and including nine who had toured South Africa in 1927\u201328 with the Marylebone Cricket Club team.Wills, card nos 1\u201350.MCC tour of South Africa in 1927\u201328 This set is now a collectible and, in mint condition, has an estimated value (2017) of \u00a390.The London Cigarette Card Co. Ltd \u2013 Cricketers 1st Series 1928 ==Overview== 47 of the players chosen for the series, including the three who played for Glamorgan, were English. The three exceptions were the Australian Test fast bowler Ted McDonald; the Indian-born batsman Duleepsinhji, though he later played for England; and Douglas Jardine, who was born in India of Scottish parents. One player, Roy Kilner, had died in April 1928 just a few weeks before publication. All of the seventeen county clubs then taking part in the County Championship are represented in the series. Most of the players in the series were veterans in 1928, only ten being under 30. The oldest player was Wilfred Rhodes, aged 50; the youngest was Duleepsinhji, aged 22. Each card has a 1\u201350 series number determined alphabetically by surname. All players are named on the front and back of the card by initials preceding surname. Players who had amateur status are prefixed \"Mr.\" (e.g., Mr. A. P. F. Chapman) or, in two cases, \"Hon.\" (e.g., Hon. F. S. G. Calthorpe). There is an artist's impression of each player on the front of the card; seventeen are portraits and 33 depict the player in action. ==Series information== ===Key=== Mr. F. T.
