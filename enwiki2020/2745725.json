    "text": "Pedro F\u00e9lix Borb\u00f3n Marte (born November 15, 1967), generally known as Pedro Borb\u00f3n Jr., is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. He played for nine seasons (1992\u20132003) for five teams, including four seasons for the Atlanta Braves, and three seasons for the Toronto Blue Jays. Borb\u00f3n was mainly a relief pitcher. Borb\u00f3n's father, Pedro Borb\u00f3n was also a pitcher, playing for the Cincinnati Reds and three other teams from 1969 to 1980, winning the World Series twice with the Cincinnati Reds. After his parents divorced when he was 13, young Pedro Borb\u00f3n left home at 14 and settled in New York City with two of his mother's brothers. In the spring of his freshman year at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Borb\u00f3n cut class, heading for the lunch room. He was stopped by a security guard, who asked to see his student ID. The guard did a double-take when he saw the name. \"Are you related to Pedro Borb\u00f3n, the pitcher?\" he asked. The guard also happened to be a baseball coach at the school. He asked Borb\u00f3n if he played baseball and refused to take \"no\" for an answer. He took Borb\u00f3n outside and had him throw 20 pitches. By Borb\u00f3n's recollection, 18 were strikes. Borb\u00f3n pitched well enough to earn an athletic scholarship to Ranger Junior College outside Houston but not before parting with his uncles and living for a while in a cheap apartment in the Bronx with two high school buddies that cost them $540 a month. He worked as a messenger after school to pay his third of the rent. He had no contact with his father between the ages of 13 and 20.Adversity makes Borbon better. The Free Library. Retrieved on February 14, 2017. Borb\u00f3n played on the 1995 Atlanta Braves, who won the World Series that year. He pitched one important inning in the 1995 World Series. The Braves were leading two games to one over the Cleveland Indians, and were leading the fourth game going into the ninth inning. However, Braves' closer Mark Wohlers was fatigued after having pitched two and two-thirds innings the previous day. Wohlers allowed the Indians to score a run and put a runner on second in that ninth inning without recording any outs. Borb\u00f3n then came in to relieve Wohlers, and promptly struck out Jim Thome and Sandy Alomar Jr. while getting Kenny Lofton to fly out to right. Borb\u00f3n is right-handed but taught himself to throw left-handed to increase his marketability as a pitcher. ==Personal life== Borb\u00f3n is the brother-in-law of major league outfielder Carlos Peguero, who is married to sister Maria Jacqueline (n\u00e9e Borb\u00f3n) Peguero. Borb\u00f3n was one of three Atlanta Braves to appear on Saturday Night Live when he made a cameo appearance alongside teammates Gerald Williams and Mark Wohlers. ==See also== * List of second- generation Major League Baseball players ==References== ==External links== , or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League) Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Arkansas Travelers players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Bridgeport Bluefish players Category:Burlington Braves players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:DeWitt Clinton High School alumni Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Durham Bulls players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Greenville Braves players Category:Gulf Coast White Sox players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Long Island Ducks players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Macon Braves players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:Memphis Redbirds players Category:People from Santa Cruz de Mao Category:Ranger Rangers baseball players Category:Richmond Braves players Category:Salt Lake Stingers players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players ",
