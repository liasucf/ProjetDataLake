A successful corporate entertainer, he came to greater fame as a result of a 1994 appearance on the BBC One show How Do They Do That? explaining the sleight of hand trick known as Three-card Monte, as a result of which he became the first person in 85 years to be expelled from The Magic Circle. His subsequent television appearances have included his own 1997 series for BBC Two, Stuff the White Rabbit; and the Secrets of Magic specials for BBC One. He is a former holder of the title Street Magician of the Year. Lenahan also provided the voice of Talkie Toaster in the first series of Red Dwarf and presented a 1987 factual series on BBC Two called The Open Road.
