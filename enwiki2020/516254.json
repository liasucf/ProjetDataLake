    "text": "The 1948 Quebec general election was held on July 28, 1948 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Ad\u00e9lard Godbout. This was the third time (and the second in a row) that Duplessis led his party to a general election victory. It was Godbout's third (and final) loss to Duplessis in a general election, and the second in a row. He had won one victory against Duplessis years earlier in the 1939 election. In this election, the Liberals fared particularly poorly, reduced to only 8 seats, although their share of the popular vote was around 36%. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1944 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Maurice Duplessis |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|48 !align=\"right\"|82 |align=\"right\"|+70.8% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 51.24% |align=\"right\"|+13.2% | Ad\u00e9lard Godbout |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|37 !align=\"right\"|8 |align=\"right\"|-78.4% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 36.17% |align=\"right\"|-3.2% | P.
