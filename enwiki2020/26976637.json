Although most survivors have since died and those who are still alive are generally octogenarians, the committees are still active. == Committees' history and purpose == During the Nazi era, there were active, underground resistance organizations at several of the camps, such as those at Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald and Dachau. After liberation, these groups became the foundation of post-war survivor organizations for their respective camps.\"65 years since liberation of Buchenwald\" (April 12, 2010). Retrieved April 17, 2010. The concentration camp committees are international organizations because their members come from and live in many different countries. The purpose of the committees is to educate the world about what was done under the Third Reich regarding the arrest and deportation of religious, political and social groups considered \"undesirable\" by the National Socialists. They also serve to care for the survivors of Nazi brutality, and finally, the committees facilitate communication and cooperation among survivors.History of the International Auschwitz Committee Retrieved April 17, 2010Description of the International Sachsenhausen Committee, official website.
