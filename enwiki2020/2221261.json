    "text": "Staphylococcus caprae is a Gram-positive, coccus bacteria and a member of the genus Staphylococcus. S. caprae is coagulase-negative. It was originally isolated from goats (caprae means \"of a goat\"), but members of this species have also been isolated from human samples. ==Clinical importance== S. caprae occurs as a commensal on human skin, but has also been implicated in infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, bones, and joints. Because S. caprae is difficult to identify definitively in the laboratory, according to a study in 2014, the incidence of S. caprae in humans is under-reported. ==Literature and further reading== It is a coagulase-negative, DNase-positive member of the genus Staphylococcus. Usually it is associated with goats. Since 1991, a few laboratories reported that they had isolated the organism from human clinical specimens.Human isolates of Staphylococcus caprae: association with bone and joint infections. in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology October 1997 vol. 35 no. 10 2537-2541 It is now an emerging microorganism in joint and bone infections in humans.Characterization of Staphylococcus caprae Clinical Isolates Involved in Human Bone and Joint Infections, Compared with Goat Mastitis Isolates, Journal of Clinical Microbiology January 2016 vol. 54 no. 1 106-113 Staphylococcus caprae was first described in 1983 by Devisee et al. based on a strain isolated from some goat milk. It can sometimes cause mastitis in the goats, and it is considered a commensal organism for the goats\u2019 skin and mammary glands. It has been reported as a pathogen for humans acquired at hospitals, mostly in bone and joint infections.Characterization of Staphylococcus caprae Clinical Isolates Involved in Human Bone and Joint Infections, Compared with Goat Mastitis Isolates, Journal of Clinical Microbiology January 2016 vol. 54 no. 1 106-113 There have also been studies on S. caprae causing sepsis in clinical settings. ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Staphylococcus caprae at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Gram-positive bacteria caprae Category:Bacteria described in 1983 ",
