Oddly enough, it was the girls' first single, and it went #1. When the song was later performed live in 1996 (with 4 Him's band on The Message about Life, Love, and Other Mysteries tour), an entirely new sequence was designed by Michael Hodge and Mark Childers, both of whom were on the band of 4 Him. Hodge appears in Point of Grace's video for a later song, Circle of Friends, which was recorded on that tour. * They were not going to cut \"Faith, Hope & Love\" because they weren't sure if the R&B; sound would work for them. * The vocals on \"Faith, Hope & Love\" were arranged by Mervyn Warren, formerly of the group Take 6. * The choir on \"No More Pain\" was made up of many of Point of Grace's new industry friends, as well as Denise's husband, Stu. * When the album was re-released in 2003 in commemoration of the group's release \"24\", a different cover was issued. * Since Heather's departure from the group in 2008, the song \"I'll Be Believing\" has been performed as part of a medley with \"You Are The Answer.\" ==Personnel== ;Point of Grace * Shelley Breen \u2013 vocals * Denise Jones \u2013 vocals * Terry Jones \u2013 vocals * Heather Payne \u2013 vocals ;Musicians * Joe Hogue \u2013 keyboards * Cheryl Rogers \u2013 keyboards * Blair Masters \u2013 keyboard and bass programming (1) * Jerry McPherson \u2013 guitars * Jackie Street \u2013 bass guitar (2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11) * Scott Williamson \u2013 drums (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8-11), rhythm arrangements (all tracks), vocal arrangements (1-6, 8-11), drum programming (3, 7), keyboard programming (3, 6, 7, 10), bass programming (6, 10) * Todd Collins \u2013 drum programming (3) * Eric Darken \u2013 percussion * Chris McDonald \u2013 horn arrangement (1, 8) * Horns (1, 8) \u2013 Mark Douthit, Barry Green, Mike Haynes and George Tidwell * Robert Sterling \u2013 rhythm arrangements (all tracks), vocal arrangements (1-6, 8-11) * Mervyn Warren \u2013 vocal arrangements (7) ===Production=== * Producers \u2013 Robert Sterling and Scott Williamson * Executive Producer \u2013 John Mays * Recorded by John Jaszcz, Wayne Morgan, Doug Sarrett and Scott Williamson. * Assistant Engineers \u2013 Barry Campbell and Wayne Morgan * Recorded at John Jaszcz at Recording Arts and Quad Studios (Nashville, TN). * Mixed by John Jaszcz at Recording Arts * Mastered by Hank Williams at MasterMix (Nashville, TN). * Art Direction \u2013 Diana Barnes * Design \u2013 Franke Design Co. * Photography \u2013 Matthew Barnes * Design (Reissue) \u2013 Chuck Hargett * Photography (Reissue) \u2013 Louise O'Brien and Daniel Scridde ==References== Category:1993 debut albums Category:Point of Grace albums ",
