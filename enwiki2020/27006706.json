It is native to North America, where it is widespread from Alaska east throughout Canada to Greenland, and common in the western and central United States. It is present in the Arctic, throughout the temperate mountain ranges, the Great Plains, the Great Basin, and along the western coastline of North America down through California. Puccinellia nuttalliana is a halophytic grass, found in areas with saline soils. This is a perennial bunchgrass that is variable in form, remaining small and clumpy or producing erect stems up to a meter tall. The inflorescence is made up of a few thin, spreading branches which spread further and sometimes become reflexed as the fruit matures. ==References== ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment - Puccinellia nuttalliana *USDA Plants Profile *Grass Manual Treatment *Puccinellia nuttalliana - Photo gallery nuttalliana Category:Bunchgrasses of North America Category:Native grasses of California Category:Grasses of the United States Category:Grasses of Canada ",
