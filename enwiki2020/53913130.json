It symbolizes the integration of the Asia- Pacific region through the interaction in sports and the determination of the disabled people to overcome the barriers. The sporty emblem in typical Korean colours and smooth brush strokes represents the desire for a society where those with disabilities and those without live together in harmony. ===Mascot=== The mascot of the 2002 FESPIC Games is a turtle named \"Gwidong- Ih\" () which literally means a cute child in Korean. The mascot's name also refers to a turtle which is pronounced \"gwi\" (\u9f9c, ) when written in Chinese characters. Turtles are characters in Korean traditional and children's stories that have perseverance and a strong energy for life. The use of turtle as the games' mascot is to symbolize the tireless effort of the disabled towards rehabilitation and social participation. Also, the \"V\" sign showed by the mascot, the initial for \"victory\", represents the Games as a celebration of victory of Humanity. ==The games== ===Sports=== * 20px Archery * 20px Athletics * 20px Powerlifting * 20px Badminton * 20px Bowling * 20px Boccia * 20px Cycling * 20px Fencing * 20px Football 7-a-side * 20px Judo * 20px Lawn bowls * 20px Shooting * 20px Swimming * 20px Sitting Volleyball * 20px Table tennis * 20px Wheelchair basketball * 20px Wheelchair tennis ===Medal Table=== ==See also== * 2002 Asian Games ==References== ==External links== * 2002 FESPIC Games Official website Category:Asian Para Games FESPIC Games FESPIC Games FESPIC Category:Multi-sport events in South Korea Category:International sports competitions hosted by South Korea Category:Sport in Busan Category:October 2002 sports events in Asia Category:November 2002 sports events in Asia ",
