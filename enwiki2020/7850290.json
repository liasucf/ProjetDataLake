    "text": "Interleukin 20 (IL20) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL20 gene. Interkeukin 20 also includes other cytokines, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26. Based on common structural and functional properties of IL-20's receptors and target cells, these cytokines constitute the same subfamily, IL-20. == Function == The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine structurally related to interleukin 10 (IL-10). This cytokine has been shown to transduce its signal through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in keratinocytes. A specific receptor for this cytokine is found to be expressed in skin and upregulated dramatically in psoriatic skin, suggesting a role for this protein in epidermal function and psoriasis. Interleukin-20 (IL-20) is a protein belonging to the IL-10 family of cytokines. IL-20 is produced by activated keratinocytes and monocytes and transmits an intracellular signal through two distinct cell-surface receptor complexes on keratinocytes and other epithelial cells. IL-20 regulates proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes during inflammation, particularly inflammation associated with the skin. In addition, IL-20 also causes cell expansion of multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells. == Anti IL-20 == Anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibodies have been researched as clinical candidates for the treatment or prevention of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and stroke. == References == == External links == * Category:Interleukins ",
