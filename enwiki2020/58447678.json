    "text": "Aspergillus ochraceoroseus is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It is from the Ochraceorosei section. The species was first described in 1979.Bartoli, A.; Maggi, O. 1978. Four new species of Aspergillus from Ivory Coast soil. Transactions of the British Mycological Society. 71(3):383-394 It has been isolated from soil in the Tai National Forest in the Ivory Coast. It has been shown to produce aflatoxin and sterigmatocystin. In 2014, the genome of A. ochraceoroseus was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.Kjaerbolling I, Vesth TC, Frisvad JC, Nybo JL, Theobald S, Kuo A, Bowyer P, Matsuda Y, Mondo S, Lyhne EK, Kogle ME, Clum A, Lipzen A, Salamov A, Ngan CY, Daum C, Chiniquy J, Barry K, LaButti K, Haridas S, Simmons BA, Magnuson JK, Mortensen UH, Larsen TO, Grigoriev IV, Baker SE, Andersen MR Linking secondary metabolites to gene clusters through genome sequencing of six diverse Aspergillus species.

Epub 2018 Jan 9.https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Aspoch1/Aspoch1.home.html The genome assembly size was 27.72 Mbp. ==Growth and morphology== Aspergillus ochraceoroseus has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid\u00ae (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.
