    "text": "Karl Freiherr von Macchio (23 February 1859 \u2013 1 April 1945), was an Austro- Hungarian diplomat active before and during World War I. == Life == Born in Hermannstadt (now Sibiu) on 23 February 1859 into a noble family originating from Lombardy. After studies in law, he joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service in 1881 and served in Constantinople, Bucharest, St. Petersburg and Belgrade.'Macchio Karl Frh. von', \u00d6sterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950, vol. 5, Vienna, Verlag der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1957, p. 387. In 1899, he was appointed to serve as minister at Cetinje and then from 1903 in Athens succeeding Baron Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz, the future Foreign Minister. In 1907, he was a member of the Austro-Hungarian delegation to the Second Hague Peace Conference. In 1908, he was appointed a Privy Councillor (Geheimer Rat).'Macchio Karl Frh. von', op. cit. In January 1909, Baron von Macchio was appointed by Count Lexa von Aehrenthal, who considered him an \"expert in Balkan questions\",William D. Godsey, Aristocratic Redoubt: The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office on the Eve of the First World War, West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1999, p. 83. to serve as Second Section Chief (equivalent to a Head of Political Section) at the Ballhausplatz. He succeeded Baron M\u00fcller von Szentgy\u00f6rgy who had been promoted to First Section Chief (equivalent to an Undersecretary) and would in March 1912 succeed him also in that position. During the July Crisis in 1914, he was therefore one of the closest collaborators of Foreign Minister Count von Berchtold but played a much more marginal role than the chef de cabinet Count von Hoyos and the Second Section Chief Count von Forg\u00e1ch After the outbreak of war, Baron von Macchio was sent to Rome on 11 August 1914 on a special mission (\"in au\u00dferordenlicher Mission\") to support the embassy as the ambassador, M\u00e9rey, was ill. As such he was de facto ambassador with the title \"au\u00dferordentlicher und bevollm\u00e4chtigter Botschafter mit Titel und Charakter\", although M\u00e9rey remained officially in charge. His mission in Rome was to prevent Italy from entering the war on the side of the Entente, but as the autumn passed it became increasingly clear that it was rather a question about delaying than preventing an Italian declaration of war against Austria- Hungary.'Karl Macchio', Solving Problems Through Force In January 1915, Baron von Macchio, supported by the German ambassador at Rome, the former Chancellor Prince von B\u00fclow, sought to persuade Foreign Minister Count Leopold Berchtold|Count Berchtold to cede the Trentino to Italy. As pressure mounted on Count Berchtold to accede in this direction, he was forced by the Hungarian Minister-President Count Tisza and the Chief of the General Staff General Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf to resign.Holger H. Herwig & Neil M. Heyman, Biographical Dictionary of World War I, London, Greenwood Press, 1982, p. 84. Following Italy's declaration of war on 23 May 1915, Baron von Macchio returned to Vienna, where he continued in his function as First Section Chief until January 1917. After the war, he worked as a staff member of the Neue Freie Presse, a Viennese newspaper, covering international affairs.'Macchio Karl Frh. von', op. cit. Prince von B\u00fclow and Matthias Erzberger blamed Baron von Macchio for the failure of the negotiations to prevent the entry of Italy into the war, but Baron von Macchio vehemently denied this in his memoirs, basing himself on Italian sources to justify his course of action. Baron von Macchio died in Vienna on 1 April 1945. == Notes == == Works == * Wahrheit!
