The painting is part of Matisse's series on man's \"Golden Age\" and was part of Sergei Shchukin's collection before the October Revolution of 1917. It is now in the collection of The Hermitage, St. Petersburg, Russia.State Hermitage Museum - Game of Bowls ==References== Category:1908 paintings Category:Paintings by Henri Matisse Category:Paintings of the Hermitage Museum Category:Sports paintings Category:Boules ",
