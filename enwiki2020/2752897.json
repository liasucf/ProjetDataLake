In January 2004, Peugeot decided not to manufacture the 207 in Ryton. The launch for the United Kingdom was on 8 June 2006. Amicus and the TGWU, both unions representing workers at PSA's manufacturing plant in Ryton, Coventry, chose the same day to launch a campaign calling for the boycott of PSA's Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn vehicles in the United Kingdom, to protest against the company's plans to close the plant. Peugeot's United Kingdom sales grew, despite the resulting boycott. Prior to the launch, Peugeot launched a campaign for the 207 on MSN. ==Design and specification== 2008 Peugeot 207 SW Outdoor 90 The 207 was the successor to the 206.

With only 2,000 units produced, the 207 Le Mans Series was distinguished on the outside with a sport front bumper with Shadow aluminium grille and Black Chrome headlights. The body side moldings, bumpers strips, and side view mirror housings were painted body color, while a long racing stripe got trimmed along the bonnet, roof, and rear spoiler. Other decal accents included a Peugeot logo, striping on the doors and Le Mans logos on the liftgate. Also special multispoke 17 inch Pitlane aluminium wheels set the tone of the vehicle. Exterior colours were Banquise White and Obsidien Black. Carried over from the 207 RC, the interior received finish decor with front and rear bucket seats as well as RC front and rear mat covers. The steering wheel too, with a finish ring and numbered from 1 to 2,000. The gearshift lever knob, pedal assembly, foot rest and door sill are in aluminium.

The top 1.6 THP175 16v 175 hp received a chrome plated dual exhaust pipe. ==Reception== The Peugeot 207 met with mixed reviews, facing criticism for the design of its interior, for the quality of its gearbox, and for its handling, with the latter two issues also identified in the GTI version. Autocar magazine said the Peugeot 207 hatchback was \"safely played and as such lacks charm, verve and difference\". It did receive praise for its value, safety and styling. Reviewers feared that it would prove unreliable, and one car insurer named it the fourth least reliable vehicle.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid;=12165840 The CC version was better received, with Top Gear motoring magazine describing it as \"a decent new version of one of the originals...of the tin top cabrio breed\". Despite this lack of acclaim, it has sold well in Britain, being the sixth best selling car overall (and third in the supermini sector) in 2007, with more than 67,000 examples being sold. ==Concept cars== ===207 RCup=== Prista Oil Peugeot 207 S2000 (2009) At the 2006 Geneva Motor Show Peugeot also unveiled a sporty concept car based on the 207 and badged as the 207 RCup.
