    "text": "Erma Zarska (June 9, 1889 \u2013 March 30, 1971), also seen as Erma Zareska, He\u0159my \u017d\u00e1rskej or He\u0159ma \u017d\u00e1rsk\u00e1, was a soprano with the Metropolitan Opera in the 1915\u20131916 season. She also sang with the Prague National Theatre and the Slovak National Theatre. == Early life == Herm\u00edna Maria \u017d\u00e1rsk\u00e1 was born in Olomouc, the daughter of Ign\u00e1c \u017d\u00e1rsk\u00fd, a blacksmith and carriage builder. She trained as a singer in Prague and Berlin. == Career == Zarska sang at the Prague National Theatre as a young woman, in Hubi\u010dka, Dalibor, and The Bartered Bride, all operas by Smetana. She made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York in November 1915; however, \"a severe cold\" affected her voice, and it failed during her debut performance in Lohengrin. \"At the end she was singing almost in a whisper,\" according to the New York Times reviewer. Emmy Destinn returned to the Met to take over the role while Zarska recovered. Zarska also sang the role of Santuzza in the Met's production of Cavalleria Rusticana in February 1916, with Sophie Breslau singing another part. During the run of Rusticana, she had a further embarrassment on stage, when her daring gown's shoulder strap slipped and \"the audience saw a great deal of Erma\", according to reports. She returned to Europe at the end of that season, when her contract was not renewed. She made recordings for Columbia in 1916. She was a soloist with the Slovak National Theatre in the 1921\u20131922 season. == Personal life == Zarska died in Prague in 1971, aged 80 years. == References == * * Category:1889 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Czech singers Category:Metropolitan Opera people Category:People from Olomouc ",
