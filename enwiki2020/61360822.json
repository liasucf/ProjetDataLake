After viewing the film at South by Southwest, Amy Smith wrote for the Austin Chronicle: \u201cThe future of global food production in the face of climate change is not the sexiest topic for a filmmaker to pursue, yet Sandy McLeod succeeds in turning the complex subject of crop diversity and food security into a compelling and thought-provoking documentary\u201d. The Margaret Mead Film Festival heralded the film by saying, \u201cSeeds of Time stands out as truly exceptional. It's about an issue less prominent in the public dialogue but of universal importance... it's just riveting filmmaking, a story swiftly and beautifully told.\" Seeds of Time is distributed by Kino Lorber. ==Synopsis== Seeds of Time follows agriculture pioneer Cary Fowler on his global journey to save the eroding foundation of our food supply in a new era of climate change. Cary Fowler travels the world, educating the public about the dire consequences of our inaction. Along with his team at The Global Crop Diversity Trust in Rome, Cary struggles to envision and implement a sustainable food system. The foundation of such a scenario is a perpetual, secure seed bank. In his words, he is imagining a seed bank that \u201cwill last forever.\u201d The film compellingly communicates the time pressure Cary is encountering in this visionary task. Accelerated climate change, political stagnation, and his own ongoing health crisis continuously complicate his efforts. == References == Category:2013 films Category:2013 documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films ",
