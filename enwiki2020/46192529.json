It is a potential tourism hub in the region due to its specie of wildlife in Umuezukwe and green vegetation. ==Location== Situated in Oru-East, Awo-omamma is some 25 kilometers from Owerri and 62.5 kilometers from Onitsha. It covers about 89.2 square kilometres, on the bank of Njaba River and lies in tropical rain forest, with hot and rainy seasons. According to Rich Piazza, a volunteer with the Peace Corps in Awo-omamma, a four-day torrential downpour typifies the extreme of the rainy season in the town.

Before the Biafran war, Dr Nzeribe and the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) helped the community build themselves the famous Awo- omamma Community Hospital (ACH) a seventy-five-bed hospital. They also built two new schools, Awo-Omamma Community Grammar School which later became Awo- Omamma Education Project (AEP), a Boarding School Santana Primary School, and an unpolluted water system, six well baby clinics, and a post office. They also assisted in introducing modern agricultural methods. Beside the famous Community Hospital, Awo-omamma is home to many other private and public health establishments including Chinwendu hospital, Rose Clinic, Awo-omamma Dispensary, Umuokwe Community Health Centre, and many others. Similarly, there are Umuezukwe Health Centre and Isieke Dispensary in Umuezukwe and Isieke sub- communities respectively. Awo-omamma is a modern Christian community. In 1959, the Holy Ghost Fathers, also known as Spiritan Congregation of Roman Catholic priests opened their Philosophy campus (now known as Awo-Omamma Catholic Seminary) in the town.Awo-Omamma is predominantly Roman Chatholics, and a sizable percentage of the population are Anglicans, and CMS (Church Missionary Society of British).

The new discovery in the company's OML124 license area on the northeast edge of the Niger Delta contains undeveloped Njaba 2 well and other exploratory prospects onshore Nigeria. Oil exploration and production have been ongoing in Njaba River basin since early 1960s. Addax Petroleum, Shell and ChevronTexaco have been operating in OML 53 and OML 124 in neighbouring Izombe. The then Senate Committee Chairman on Gas Resources, Senator Osita Izunaso said by the time Addax starts oil activity in their latest Njaba 2, the company could be producing about 15,000 to 20,000 barrels per day in Imo State. The Senator, during a visit at Izombe flow station also disclosed that establishment of an oil and gas laboratory in Owerri as well as further studies on the gas reserve in the Anambra Basin was covered in 2010 federal budget. The crude oil discovery is set to boost development of Awo- Omamma, Njaba River basin, Imo and Nigeria. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Jean Claude Gandur, said the new onshore Njaba 2 field was a further example of the company's commitment to development in Nigeria. ==Agriculture and Infrastructure== Traditionally, the occupation of Awo-Omamma community is agriculture including fishing on Njaba River. And there is sand and gravel mining along Njaba River banks. Fishermen, Fish Landing Sites and Fisheries Cooperative Societies exist in many Imo State communities; some are found in villages of Awo-Omamma and its bordering communities. Among them are Udoka Fish Farmers Group, Umuezukwe Awo-omamma and their Ughamiri (Umuezukwe) Landing Site (river port). There is also Kalabari Beach Fishermen Cooperative Society, Oguta; and associated Osse Abiaziem and Osemotor Landing Sites. These farmers and residents experience economic constraints due to unreliable electricity and undeveloped inter-village and inter-town roads. These militate against efficient operation of their fish and crop farming activities in the villages. ==History and Culture== The indigenous community speak Awo-omamma dialect of the Igbo language and English Language.
