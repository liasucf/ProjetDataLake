    "text": "Carmen, Baby is a 1967 American-German-Yugoslav romantic drama film directed by Radley Metzger, based on the novella Carmen by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e (which also inspired Bizet popular opera, Carmen). ==Plot== A liberated woman tempts a local police officer into a romantic entanglement with unpleasant consequences. == Cast == * Uta Levka as Carmen * Claus Ringer as Jose * Carl M\u00f6hner as Medicio * Barbara Valentin as Dolores * Walter Wilz as Baby Lucas * Christiane R\u00fccker as Misty * Arthur Brauss as Garcia * Doris Arden as Darcy * Michael M\u00fcnzer as Magistrate ==Reception== The film Carmen, Baby, according to one reviewer, was the beginning of Metzger's successful style in his later films: that is, adapting \"a literary classic in a gorgeous European locale with high polish and a goodly helping of sophisticated sex and seduction.\" Film critic Jesse Vogel noted that the film is an example of Metzger's signature style, \"cool, classy, distant, with a distinctively European sensibility\". According to film reviewer Gary Morris, Carmen was \"well played\" by Uta Levka; lighting and camerawork by Hans Jura was \"first-rate\". Another reviewer wrote that the film had \"a rather classy look\" and that the performers were \"attractive\" and the setting \"beautiful\". ==Legal issues== In the case of Rabe v. Washington, 405 U.S. 313 (1972), the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the manager of a drive-in movie theater could not be charged with obscenity for showing the film which was not wholly determined to be obscene, but only parts were, holding that the citizens of Washington State had no notice under the Sixth Amendment that the place where a film was shown was an element of the offense. ==Popular culture== Wally Lamb mentioned the bottle dance scene from Carmen, Baby in his 2016 book I'll Take You There. ==Notes== According to one film reviewer, Radley Metzger's films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969\u20131984), are noted for their \"lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle\". Another reviewer noted that his films were \"highly artistic \u2014 and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography\". Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. ==References== ==External links== * * Carmen, Baby at MUBI Category:American erotic drama films Category:American films Category:Erotic romance films Category:Films based on Carmen Category:Films directed by Radley Metzger Category:German erotic drama films Category:1967 films Category:1960s erotic drama films Category:West German films Category:Works involved in a lawsuit Category:Yugoslav drama films Category:Yugoslav films Category:1967 drama films ",
