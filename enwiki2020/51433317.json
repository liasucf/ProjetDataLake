    "text": "The Lower Austria Museum (), formerly the Lower Austria State Museum (Landesmuseum Nieder\u00f6sterreich), is the national museum for the state of Lower Austria and covers the fields of history, art and nature. It is located in St. P\u00f6lten in Lower Austria. Before it moved to St. P\u00f6lten in 2002, the museum, which was founded in 1902 by the Association for Cultural Studies, occupied several locations in Vienna. For example, in the period 1912-1923 it was based in Wallnerstra\u00dfe and, from 1923 to 1997, it was housed in the Palais Mollard- Clary. On the establishment of the new state capital of St. P\u00f6lten, the state museum was transferred to the cultural region it represents. ==Gallery== File:Landesmuseum Nieder\u00f6sterreich Foto Hertha Hurnaus (8).jpg File:13-04-13-st-poelten-landhausviertel-518.jpg File:13-04-13-st-poelten- landhausviertel-520.jpg File:13-04-13-st-poelten-landhausviertel-523.jpg == References == == External links == * www.museumnoe.at * History database of the museum * Category:Museums in Lower Austria Category:Zoos in Austria Category:History museums in Austria Category:Natural history museums in Austria ",
