The Irwin 27 was the first production boat built by the fledgling company after its founding in 1966. The Irwin 27 followed on from the racing boat Voodoo that Irwin had constructed in 1963. Irwin had raced the boat from 1964 to 1966 and won 24 of the 28 races that he had competed in. Following the introduction of the Irwin 27, the company went on to build a line of smaller boats and later larger boats, such as the Irwin 41 and the Irwin 41 Citation racer. The company became one of the largest producers of sailboats in the United States. It went through multiple bankruptcies and name changes, before finally closing in 1992.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 364-365.
