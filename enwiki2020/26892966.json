The pump on a tanker runs independently, so that the truck can drive around and extinguish the fire.CFA Truck information. Accessed 10 April 2010 Tanks are divided into different types via a mixed number/letter specification. The specification gives an indication of how much water is carried in the tank, the wheel drive type and type of pump.

Pumpers are generally used in an urban environment to fight structure fires, as they require a reticulated or static water supply (e.g.: a dam) to operate. Pumpers are also equipped with an extensive inventory of operational equipment including hoses, nozzles, ladders, breathing apparatus, chemical protection suits and other fire fighting gear, stowed in lockers on board the pumper. Pumpers carry some water, up to 2000 litres, but because their pumps are so large, they need the truck engine to run them, so pumpers operate only when they are parked.CFA Truck information.
