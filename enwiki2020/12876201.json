It stars Mikael Persbrandt, Stina Ekblad, Sofia Helin and Peter Franz\u00e9n. ==Plot== The film involves a skillful team of professional thieves who hit several banks in Stockholm. The police investigation is led by 33-year-old chief inspector Klara (Sofia Helin) and Greger Krona (Stefan Sauk) who are led to the source, with a fatal exit. Klara, a chief inspector of the Stockholm robbery commission, is in love with Frank (Mikael Persbrandt), a surgeon for Doctors Without Borders. The story opens during a bank robbery unlike any in Swedish history, carried out with military professionalism. The thieves disappear with the money, and their escape car is found burning in a forest. Heavily-armed police surround the forest. Suddenly, one of the robbers starts shooting a police helicopter searching the forest, providing cover for the robbers so they have time to escape. Klara and her colleague, Krona soon realize that they are not dealing with ordinary bank robbers. The thieves have information on bank delivery times, police work, safety, and their behavior is extreme. The hunt is intense, the villains' methods becoming frighteningly more sophisticated. ==Cast== *Mikael Persbrandt as Frank *Sofia Helin as Klara *Stefan Sauk as Greger Krona *Stina Ekblad as Marianne *Peter Franz\u00e9n as Juha/Jarkko *Jarmo M\u00e4kinen as Raimo *Steve Aalam as Tommy *Stina Zacco as Eva *Stig Engstr\u00f6m as Ingmar Hj\u00e4lm *Irma Schultz as Jeanette Hj\u00e4lm *Simon Averin-Markstr\u00f6m as Johan Hj\u00e4lm *Jens Hult\u00e9n as Response Force officer Mattsson ==External links== * * Category:Swedish films Category:2003 films Category:2003 action films Category:Films set in Sweden Category:Swedish action films ",
