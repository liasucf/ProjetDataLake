    "text": "The Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Pro, also called Reto Iberdrola for sponsorship reasons, is the second level of league competition for Spanish women's football since the 2019\u201320 season. It is the female equivalent of the men's Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and is run by the Royal Spanish Football Federation. ==History== On 24 July 2018, the Royal Spanish Football Federation agreed to create a new second division between the Primera Divisi\u00f3n, featuring 16 teams, and the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, in which 112 teams were involved. In its first season, the league was to be contested by 32 teams divided into two groups: two teams relegated from the 2018\u201319 Primera Divisi\u00f3n and the 30 best teams from the 2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. In July 2019, the new second tier was renamed as Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Pro being later re-branded as Reto Iberdrola for sponsorship reasons. The level below which had carried that name previously recovered its former name of Primera Nacional. On 10 June 2020 the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n was granted professionalized league status.https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/womens- soccer-gains-professional-status-in-spain/ ==Format== The 32 teams are divided into two groups according to geographical criteria. The two group winners promote directly to Primera Divisi\u00f3n. ==2019\u201320 teams and locations== ==Champions and promotions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:0; text-align:center\" |- !Season !Group North !Runners-up !Other promoted teams |- |2019\u201320 || Athletic Bilbao B (not promoted) || Santa Teresa || Eibar |- |} ==All-time Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Pro table== ==References== ==External links== *Royal Spanish Football Federation 2 Spain ",
