When the railway station opened here in 1924 it was called South Fairfield.

A post office was opened the following year as the local population began to swell.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.146 , page 52 ==Demographics== According to the 2016 census of population, there were 3,550 residents in Carramar. 37.6% of people were born in Australia.
