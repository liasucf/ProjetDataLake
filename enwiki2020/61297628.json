    "text": "thumb Neptune Inn is an historic public house located in Fore Street, Ipswich, Suffolk, England. The building was originally built around 1490. ==History== The building was bought by John Cobbold in 1845. He renovated the building, selling the old fixtures \u2013 such as linenfold panelling, an internal canopy, and carved beams \u2013 to William Burrell, a Glaswegian antique collector, who added them to the Burrell Collection, where they are to this day. In 1947 the building was bought by George Bodley Scott, the managing director of W. S. Cowell Ltd.. He commissioned the Royal Archaeological Institute to conduct a survey to establish the history of the building. This was conducted in 1951 and extracts appeared in a booklet published by Scott in 1970 entitled The Old Neptune Inn. A tavern clock dating c.1740 is still in existence, although the movement was replaced in 1950. ==References== Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Ipswich Category:Alexandra Ward, Ipswich Category:Pubs in Ipswich Category:Cobbold pubs ",
