    "text": "In mathematics, Auerbach's lemma, named after Herman Auerbach, is a theorem in functional analysis which asserts that a certain property of Euclidean spaces holds for general finite-dimensional normed vector spaces. == Statement == Let (V, ||\u00b7||) be an n-dimensional normed vector space. Then there exists a basis {e1, ..., en} of V such that : ||ei|| = 1 and ||ei|| = 1 for i = 1, ..., n, where {e1, ..., en} is a basis of V* dual to {e1, ..., en}, i. e. ei(ej) = \u03b4ij. A basis with this property is called an Auerbach basis. If V is an inner product space (or even infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) then this result is obvious as one may take for {ei} any orthonormal basis of V (the dual basis is then {(ei|\u00b7)}). == Geometric formulation == An equivalent statement is the following: any centrally symmetric convex body in \\mathbf{R}^n has a linear image which contains the unit cross-polytope (the unit ball for the \\ell_1^n norm) and is contained in the unit cube (the unit ball for the \\ell_{\\infty}^n norm). == Corollary == The lemma has a corollary with implications to approximation theory. Let V be an n-dimensional subspace of a normed vector space (X, ||\u00b7||). Then there exists a projection P of X onto V such that ||P|| \u2264 n. === Proof === Let {e1, ..., en} be an Auerbach basis of V and {e1, ..., en} corresponding dual basis. By Hahn\u2013Banach theorem each ei extends to f i \u2208 X* such that : ||f i|| = 1. Now set : P(x) = \u2211 f i(x) ei. It's easy to check that P is indeed a projection onto V and that ||P|| \u2264 n (this follows from triangle inequality). ==References== *Joseph Diestel, Hans Jarchow, Andrew Tonge, Absolutely Summing Operators, p. 146\\. * Joram Lindenstrauss, Lior Tzafriri, Classical Banach Spaces I and II: Sequence Spaces; Function Spaces, Springer 1996, , p. 16. * Reinhold Meise, Dietmar Vogt, Einf\u00fchrung in die Funktionalanalysis, Vieweg, Braunschweig 1992, . * Przemys\u0142aw Wojtaszczyk, Banach spaces for analysts.
