    "text": "The Thai Parliament Museum () is a museum within the Sappaya-Sapasathan, Bangkok, dedicated to the political history of Thailand after the transition to a constitutional monarchy in 1932. ==History== The museum was established and first opened to the public in 1974 as part of the Document and Research Service Centre (\u0e28\u0e39\u0e19\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e49\u0e19\u0e04\u0e27\u0e49\u0e32) of the Secretariat of the House of Representatives. At that time, the museum was housed by Building A (\u0e15\u0e36\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2d) within the Parliament House, sharing the location with the Thai Parliament Library. In 1976, the museum was expected to be moved to the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, a former parliament house, but this was prevented by the ongoing refurbishment of the hall. In 1978, the museum was relocated to Building B (\u0e15\u0e36\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e35) in the Parliament House instead. In 1980, a statue of King Rama VII was erected in front of Parliamentary Building 1 (\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32 1) of the Parliament House, and a chamber was created behind the statue as a museum for displaying personal belongings of the king, called the King Prajadhipok Museum, inaugurated on 10 December 1980. In 1984, Ukrit Mongkolanawin, then president of the parliament, reintroduced the idea of moving the Parliament Museum to the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. After the renovation of the throne hall, the museum was located there for a period of time from 10 December 1984 and was moved back to the Parliament House, where it was housed in the same chamber as the King Prajadhipok Museum. In 1998, the King Prajadhipok Museum moved out to a new building on Lan Luang Road near Phan Fa Lilat Bridge. The chamber has since housed the Parliament Museum only. In 2019, Thai Parliament Museum moved to latest parliament house building, Sappaya- Sapasathan.https://news.mthai.com/general- news/692138.htmlhttps://db.sac.or.th/museum/?id=49&CID;=1337 ==Governance== The museum is administered by the Museum and Archives Division (\u0e01\u0e25\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e4c\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e08\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e15\u0e38), an agency of the Bureau of Academic Services (\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23), Secretariat of the House of Representatives. ==Location and travel== The museum is located in a chamber behind the statue of King Rama VII at Parliamentary Building 1 (\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32 1), Parliament House of Thailand, U-Thong Nai Road, Dusit District, Bangkok, opposite to the Dusit Zoo.
