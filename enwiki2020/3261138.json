As a director, he is responsible for the SNL shorts \"MacGruber\", \"Business Meeting\", \"Sloths\", \"Giraffes\", and others. He also directed a \"MacGruber\" Pepsi commercial spot for the 43rd Super Bowl, which aired February 1, 2009. In 2007, Taccone co-starred in Paramount's Hot Rod (starring Andy Samberg, directed by Akiva Schaffer). He is also one of the principal actors in the music video \"Jizz in My Pants\". He played Guy #2 in \"We Like Sportz\", reprising the role from \"Just 2 Guyz\". He played the lead role of Brett in The Lonely Island's The 'Bu, the group's record-breaking contribution to Channel 101, where he played a ninja who did not belong. The 'Bu, a parody of The OC, also starred Sarah Chalke as Melissa and Andy Samberg as Aaron.

In August 2009, he directed his first film, an adaptation of the Saturday Night Live sketch MacGruber, and was featured as part of the group male vocals on Lightspeed Champion's album Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You. As of SNL's 36th season, he was no longer cited in the end credits, though he is still listed on the NBC website as a writer and holds the unofficial title of \"Sexiest Member of Lonely Island\". However, according to the band's website, thelonelyisland.com, \"the Dudes\" were still responsible for the SNL Digital Shorts. It was later confirmed Taccone had left Saturday Night Live, though he worked on some shorts in the 36th season. Taccone acted in season 5 of MyDamnChannel's Wainy Days and is the director of the AT&T; Wireless television ad campaign It's Not Complicated. He also had a recurring role on the HBO show Girls as the character Booth Jonathan. In 2015, Taccone appeared in the Kickstarter short movie Kung Fury as Adolf Hitler (A.K.A. Kung-F\u00fchrer). He will play this role again in the sequel Kung Fury 2. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !|Year !|Title !|Role !|Notes |- | 2007 | Hot Rod | Kevin Powell | |- | 2008 | Role Models | Mitch from Graphics | Cameo |- | 2009 | Land of the Lost | Cha-Ka | Nominated\u2014Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor |- | 2012 | The Watch | Guy | Cameo (with The Lonely Island) |- | 2013 | Grown Ups 2 | Male Cheerleader |Cameo (with The Lonely Island) |- |rowspan=2|2014 | The Lego Movie | William Shakespeare (voice) | |- | Neighbors | Toga #3 | Cameo (with The Lonely Island) |- | 2015 | Kung Fury | Adolf Hitler, a.k.a. \"Kung Fuhrer\" | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2016 |Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping | Owen Bouchard | |- |Storks | Miscellaneous Stork (voice) | |- | 2017 | It Happened in L.A. | Elliot | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | Rampage | Scuba Diver | Deleted scene |- | Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse | Norman Osborn / Green Goblin (voice) * * * Spider-Man of Earth-67 (voice) | |- | 2019 | The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part | Larry Poppins (voice) | |- | rowspan=\"2\"|2020 | An American Pickle | Liam | |- | I Used to Go Here | Bradley Cooper | |- | TBA | Kung Fury 2 | Adolf Hitler, a.k.a. \"Kung Fuhrer\" | Post-production |} ===Television=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !|Year !|Title !|Role !|Notes |- | 2005\u20132014 | Saturday Night Live | Various | 22 episodes |- | 2009 | Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! | Himself | Episode: \"Tennis\" |- | 2011 | Up All Night | Benjamin \"B-Ro\" Roth | Episode: \"Working Late and Working It\" |- | 2012\u20132013 | Girls | Booth Jonathan | 3 episodes |- | 2013\u20132014 | The League | Spazz | 3 episodes |- | 2014 | Gravity Falls | Gabe Bensen (voice) | 2 episodes |- | 2014\u20132016 | Comedy Bang!
