The league included eight teams, broken up into Eastern and Western divisions, which played a 14-game official schedule, culminating in a league championship game. After the end of the previous season, the Miami Seahawks had accrued $350,000 dollars in debt, prompting owner Harvey Hester to declare bankruptcy and the AAFC to shut down the team. They would be replaced in the Eastern division by the Baltimore Colts.Craig R. Coenen, From Sandlots to the Super Bowl: the National Football League, 1920-1967.
