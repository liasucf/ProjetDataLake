    "text": "Portrait of Sophie Dawes, Baronne de Feuch\u00e8res, by Alexis Leon Louis Valbrun thumb|Birthplace of Sophie Dawes at St Helens, Isle of Wight, UK. The blue plaque reads: She was born at St Helens, Isle of Wight, the daughter of an alcoholic fisherman named Richard Daw (or Dawes). She grew up in the workhouse at Newport and after a short period of employment with a local farmer worked as a chambermaid in Portsmouth, then went to London where she worked as a servant in a high-class brothel on Piccadilly. There, she eventually met the exiled duc de Bourbon, afterwards Prince of Cond\u00e9, in 1811 and became his mistress. She was ambitious, and Cond\u00e9 had her educated well not only in modern languages but, as her still extant exercise books show, in Greek and Latin. He took her to Paris and, to prevent scandal and to qualify her to be received at court, had her married in 1818 to Adrien Victor de Feuch\u00e8res, a major in the Royal Guard. The prince provided her dowry and made her husband his aide-de- camp and a baron. The baroness, pretty and clever, became a person of consequence at the court of Louis XVIII. However, De Feuch\u00e8res finally discovered the relations between his wife and Cond\u00e9, whom he had been assured was her father, and left her, obtaining a legal separation in 1827. On hearing of the scandal, the king banished her from his court, declaring her \"naught more than a commoner street-wench yet tragically bereft of any skills of the trade.\" Thanks to her influence, however, Cond\u00e9 was induced in 1829 to sign a will bequeathing about ten million francs to her, and the rest of his estate\u2014more than sixty-six millions\u2014to the duc d'Aumale, fourth son of Louis Philippe. Again she was in high favour. Charles X received her at court, Talleyrand visited her, her niece married a marquis Hugues de Chabannes La Palice and her nephew was made a baron. Cond\u00e9, wearied by his mistress's importunities, and depressed after the July Revolution and the subsequent exile of the King, made up his mind to leave France secretly. When on 27 August 1830 he was found hanging dead from his window, the baroness was suspected and an inquiry was held. But the evidence of death being the result of any crime appearing insufficient, she was not prosecuted. There were rumours that the new King of the French, Louis-Philippe, had collaborated with Sophie in the crime. Later, rumours circulated amongst the nobility that Cond\u00e9 had died pleasuring himself, engaged in what would later be known as autoerotic asphyxiation.see for instance DIEKSTRA, Ren\u00e9, De macht van een ma\u00eetresse, Karakter Uitgevers BV, Uithoorn, 2011, 431 p Hated as she was by the French, the baroness returned to London, where she died in December 1840. Her grave can still be seen in Kensal Green Cemetery. ==Notes== ==References== * Marjorie Bowen (1934) The Scandal of Sophie Dawes. * Victor Macclure, She Stands Accused, chap 5. online version * Violette Montagu, Sophie Dawes, Queen of Chantilly (John Lane, 1912) * Category:1795 births Category:1840 deaths Category:English courtesans Category:House of Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 Category:Mistresses of French royalty Category:People from Newport, Isle of Wight Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery ",
