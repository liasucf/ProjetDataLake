    "text": "Lorenzo Mor\u00f3n Vizca\u00edno (born 16 February 1970), commonly known as Loren, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a central defender, and the manager of UD Los Barrios. He amassed Segunda Divisi\u00f3n totals of 279 games and 11 goals, representing five clubs. He appeared in 99 La Liga matches over four seasons (five goals), with M\u00e9rida, Salamanca and Recreativo. ==Playing career== Born in Marbella, Andalusia, Loren kickstarted his 18-year senior career with CA Marbella, helping the club promote from Tercera Divisi\u00f3n to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in only two seasons. He made his debut in the latter competition on 6 September 1992, in a 1\u20131 home draw against CD Castell\u00f3n. In the summer of 1993, Loren signed with second level side CP M\u00e9rida, helping them promote to La Liga for the first time ever in his second year. In the following campaign, he started in all his 22 league appearances in an eventual relegation as second from bottom. Loren split the following nine years between the top flight and division two, in representation of UD Salamanca, Sevilla FC and Recreativo de Huelva. He scored a career-best three goals \u2013 at the professional level \u2013 with the second team in 2000\u201301, adding his second championship in the second tier in the process; two seasons later, his two goals from 32 appearances could not help prevent Recreativo from being relegated from the top tier, and he also started in the final of the Copa del Rey, a 0\u20133 loss to RCD Mallorca in Elche. Loren retired in 2007 at the age of 37, after two years in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B with his first club, now renamed UD Marbella. ==Coaching career== Loren started working as a head coach in late 2014, with amateurs Atl\u00e9tico Mancha Real. On 23 March 2015, he replaced Pablo Alfaro at the helm of Marbella as the team was placed inside the relegation zone, eventually leading them to a comfortable tenth-place finish in the third division. After leaving Marbella by mutual consent in April 2016, Loren took over at nearby Tercera Divisi\u00f3n club V\u00e9lez CF in October. In December 2017, over two decades after playing in the Extremaduran capital, he was hired as manager of M\u00e9rida AD, replacing Mehdi Nafti who returned to the helm the following March when the situation had not improved. On 1 August 2019, Loren was appointed coach of Mons Calpe S.C. in the Gibraltar National League. He left shortly after, returning to his country and signing with amateurs UD Los Barrios in the same capacity. ==Personal life== Loren's son, also named Lorenzo, was also a footballer. A striker, he represented mainly Real Betis. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Team ! rowspan=\"2\" |Nat ! rowspan=\"2\" |From ! rowspan=\"2\"|To ! colspan=\"5\" |Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! ! ! ! |- | align=\"left\" |Atl\u00e9tico Mancha Real | |align=left|17 December 2014 |align=left|23 March 2015 | |- | align=\"left\" |Marbella | |align=left|23 March 2015 |align=left|25 April 2016 | |- | align=\"left\" | V\u00e9lez | |align=left|17 October 2016 |align=left|15 May 2017 | |- |align=\"left\" | M\u00e9rida | |align=left|27 December 2017 |align=left|11 March 2018 | |- ! colspan=4 | Career total !\u2014 |} ==Honours== Marbella *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B: 1991\u201392 M\u00e9rida *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1994\u201395 Sevilla *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 2000\u201301 Recreativo *Copa del Rey runner-up: 2002\u201303 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Marbella Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:CA Marbella footballers Category:CP M\u00e9rida footballers Category:UD Salamanca players Category:Sevilla FC players Category:Recreativo de Huelva players Category:Marbella FC players Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:Marbella FC managers Category:Spanish expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Gibraltar ",
