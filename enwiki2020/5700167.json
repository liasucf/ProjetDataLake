    "text": "Love, God, Murder is a Johnny Cash compilation box set (and 84th overall release) released in 2000. It features three themed CDs of songs Cash chose from his catalog. Love features relationship songs, mostly written for June Carter Cash. God is a collection of Gospel and spiritual songs. Murder features another recurring topic of Cash's career, and perhaps his favorite subject, but one that he encouraged people \"not to go out and do\". Each album was also released separately on the same day. In 2004 Life, a fourth compilation was released. Although the albums within the box set are compilations, they demonstrate Cash's lifelong affection for releasing concept albums. Examples of previous Cash theme albums include Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian (1964), Sings the Ballads of the True West (1965), America: A 200-Year Salute in Story and Song (1972) and The Rambler (1977). Each of the three discs contains liner notes by a celebrity. Love has liner notes by Cash's wife, June Carter Cash, U2's frontman Bono contributes liner notes for God, and Murder's liner notes are by film director Quentin Tarantino. ==Love== ===Track listing=== ===Release credits=== *Johnny Cash \u2013 Arranger, Liner Notes, Adaptation, Compilation Producer *June Carter Cash \u2013 Liner Notes *John Jackson \u2013 Project Director *Steven Berkowitz \u2013 Producer *Chris Athens \u2013 Engineer *Mark Wilder \u2013 Engineer *Darcy Proper \u2013 Mastering *Howard Fritzson \u2013 Art Direction *Don Hunstein \u2013 Photography ==God== Another feature of Cash's career is his affinity for another theme: gospel. God pulls from a vast catalog of spiritual songs that includes the albums Hymns by Johnny Cash (1959), Songs of Our Soil (1959), Hymns from the Heart (1962), Sings Precious Memories (1975), Believe in Him (1986) and My Mother's Hymn Book (2004). ===Track listing=== ===Release credits=== *Johnny Cash \u2013 Arranger, Liner Notes, Adaptation, Compilation Producer *Bono \u2013 Liner Notes *John Jackson \u2013 Project Director *Steven Berkowitz \u2013 Producer *Chris Athens \u2013 Engineer *Mark Wilder \u2013 Engineer *Darcy Proper \u2013 Mastering *Howard Fritzson \u2013 Art Direction *Don Hunstein \u2013 Photography ==Murder== ===Track listing=== ===Release credits=== *Johnny Cash \u2013 Producer, Liner Notes, Compilation Producer *Quentin Tarantino \u2013 Liner Notes *John Jackson \u2013 Project Director *Steven Berkowitz \u2013 Producer *Chris Athens \u2013 Engineer *Mark Wilder \u2013 Engineer *Darcy Proper \u2013 Mastering *Mike Cimicata \u2013 Packaging Manager *Howard Fritzson \u2013 Art Direction *Don Hunstein \u2013 Photography *Patti Matheny \u2013 A&R; *Tim Smith \u2013 A&R; ==Life== As a result of the success of the first three collections, in 2004, a fourth volume, Life, was released (his 90th overall release).
