Although consensus was reached, the treaty was never ratified. ==Background== The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of Azerbaijan SSR which started in early 1988 had developed unmitigated and claimed lives of many civilians, interior troops and army. ==Mediating mission== With consent from the authorities in Azerbaijan and Armenia, Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev led a mediating mission on September 20\u201323 visiting Baku, Ganja, Stepanakert (Khankendi) and Yerevan. Taking the principles of territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign states, observance of civil rights as the starting point, breakthrough was achieved on September 22 when Armenia renounced all its claims to Azerbaijani territory. This allowed the parties to agree to a joint communique the next day, committing both sides to disarm and withdraw militias, allow return of refugees and IDPs, re-establish Soviet-era administrative order of the Nagorno-Karabakh oblast and set up delegations to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Soviet army and internal troops would still remain in the conflict zone and the process would be supervised by Russian and Kazakh officials. The peace communiqu\u00e9 was discussed with participation of Y. Shaposhnikov, V.Barannikov, S. Voskanyan, M. Gezalov, V. Dzhafarov, R. Kocharian, L. Petrosian, M. Radayev and was signed by Boris Yeltsin (Russian Federation), Ayaz Mutalibov (Azerbaijan), Nursultan Nazarbayev (Kazakhstan) and Levon Ter-Petrosian (Armenia). ==See also== *Madrid Principles *Tehran Communiqu\u00e9 *Bishkek Protocol ==References== ==External links== *Full text of the Zheleznovodsk Communiqu\u00e9 *Text of all peace accords between Armenia and Azerbaijan Category:Peace treaties Category:Nagorno-Karabakh War Category:Treaties of Armenia Category:Treaties of Azerbaijan Category:Treaties concluded in 1991 Category:1991 in the Soviet Union Category:Treaties of the Republic of Artsakh Category:1991 in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Category:September 1991 events in Europe ",
