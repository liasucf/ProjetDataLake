    "text": "\"I Should Be So Lucky\" is a 1987 song performed by Australian recording artist and songwriter Kylie Minogue from her debut studio album Kylie (1988). Released on 29 December 1987 by Mushroom Records and PWL Records, the song became a worldwide breakthrough hit; its image of Minogue on the front cover was shot by David Levine. The song was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman for Minogue, and they went on to produce Minogue's first four studio albums. \"I Should Be So Lucky\" received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who thought that the song was an instant highlight and good song within the 80s, while some dismissed the lyrical content. Despite this, the song received commercial attention around the world where the song topped the charts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany and peaked in the top ten in many countries including New Zealand, Japan, and the Dance charts in the U.S. ==Recording and development== After the success of her debut single \"Locomotion\" in Australia, Minogue traveled to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \"I Should Be So Lucky\" in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response to what he had learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia and very talented, there must be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. Stock later told The Guardian: \"We had to get the song together in about 40 minutes and she left not having had a happy experience. We didn\u2019t know we had a hit on our hands and so when it went to No 1 for five weeks, someone said: 'What\u2019s the follow-up?' We didn't have one. So I went out to Australia at the start of 1988 and met her in a bar with Jason and her manager. I basically crawled 100 yards on my knees and apologised profusely.\" ==Composition== \"I Should Be So Lucky\" is a pop and hi-NRG song which features elements of bubblegum pop and new wave music. According to the music sheet on MusicNotes.com, which was published by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is set in the key of C major. Minogue's vocals span from D4 to C5. The song is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute. Instrumentation of the song features synthesizers, keyboards and guitars. According to PopMatters, the song features \"numerous orchestra hits to the uncomfortably thin sounding drum machine.\" Waterman has said the tune was inspired by Pachelbel's Canon. Stock told The Guardian: \"Anyone who thinks I Should Be So Lucky is easy should try to play it. It's in four keys, all of them really awkward, and you can't even strum it unless you're a really good musician.\" ==Critical reception== \"I Should Be So Lucky\" garnered positive reviews from some music critics. Nick Levine, from Digital Spy, called it \"standout track\". Chris True from AllMusic had reviewed the album, and highlighted the song as an album standout. But as a separate rating, they gave the single three stars out of five. In the review of The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012), Tim Sendra highlighted it as an album standout. Hunter Felt from PopMatters gave it a positive review, stating \"something about Kylie\u2019s innocent yet forceful vocals and the sheer catchiness of the song itself [...] So the song became a beloved secret, and I never bothered to try to tune my friends in on \"I Could Be So Lucky\", or, crazier yet, proclaim that this \"has-been\" would be a critical and commercial darling in a few years time.\" However, he did say the song was clich\u00e9. However, Mark Edwards from Stylus Magazine gave it a scathing remark by saying \"Listening to the first tracks on Ultimate Kylie, you want to skip straight through, because early songs like \"I Should Be So Lucky\" and \"Locomotion\" are unlistenable\u2014horribly naff, squeaky songs\" and criticized Stock, Aitken and Waterman songs they produced in the 80s by stating \"[the songs] transport the listener back to a time when every single in the UK charts was either written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman or sung by an Aussie soap star, or both.\" OK! called the song a \"classic\". The song was also known to many in the late 1980s and early 1990s as one of Minogue's signature songs, which many critics entering the song on their best track or worst track list. And additionally, in 2011, \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry.National Film and Sound Archive: 'I Should Be So Lucky' on the Sounds of Australia registryNational Film and Sound Archive: 'I Should Be So Lucky' on australianscreen online \"I Should Be So Lucky\" later appeared on seven of Kylie's hit compilations including Greatest Hits (1992), Ultimate Kylie (2004), and Step Back in Time: The Definitive Collection (2019).
