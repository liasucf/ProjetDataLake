    "text": "Water purification in Africa could save many lives. Water pollution is a serious problem killing thousands of people in Africa every year. A child born in sub-Saharan Africa has a twenty-two percent risk of dying before the age of fifteen. More than a third of those casualties are babies who do not survive the first month of their lives. ==Water treatment== Drinking water is considered a leading culprit for disease. It is a big problem. ==Other factors== ===Malnutrition=== Africans suffer from low birth weight due to the mother's malnutrition and lack of ability to obtain adequate nutrition for themselves. Children all over Africa suffer from attenuate infections almost immediately after being born. ===Sanitation=== Analysts state that casualties could often be prevented if basic sanitation was available. ==Solutions== A new bioenergy sewage treatment process aimed at developing countries is now on the horizon; the Omni Processor is a self-sustaining process which uses the sewerage solids as fuel to convert the waste water into drinking water and surplus electrical energy. ==See also== * Water in Africa * History of water filters * Water purification * Water treatment ==References== Category:Water treatment Category:Health in Africa ",
