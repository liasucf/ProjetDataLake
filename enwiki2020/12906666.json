Before his death the following assessment was made of him: \"He is regarded by many as Africa's greatest living composer, possesses one of the most distinctive compositional voices of our time\".Review of A composer in Africa Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov\u00e9 ==Early life== In Bethlehem, Orange Free State, where Grov\u00e9 was born, his mother worked as a music teacher and his father as a school principal.[South African Music Encyclopedia, edited by Jacques P. Malan. II, 141.] Grov\u00e9's musical education began at school and his first compositional efforts date from that time. He eventually trained as a pianist and organist, with the guidance from his mother's brother, D.J. Roode. As a student he remained an avid reader of musical scores (often without the assistance of accompanying soundtracks) which not only informed his own development as a composer but may also have developed his talent for sight-reading at the piano. ==Life and works== In 1942 Grov\u00e9 moved to Klerksdorp where he worked as a teacher church organist for two years. Thereafter he relocated to study composition at the University of Cape Town first with William Henry Bell and then with Erik Chisholm. Compositions from this time include a ballet suite for orchestra (1944), the String quartet in D major (1945), and a czardas for violin and piano (1946?). As the first South African recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship, Grov\u00e9 had the opportunity of going to Harvard University where he completed his master's degree. His teachers there included Thurston Dart and Walter Piston. Works that Grov\u00e9 composed under their guidance won him the G. Arthur Knight Prize and the New York Bohemian Prize.[South African Music Encyclopedia, edited by Jacques P. Malan. II, 142.] These were awarded for the Pianoforte trio and the Sonata for pianoforte and cello respectively. Grov\u00e9 attended Aaron Copland's composition class at the Tanglewood Summer School and studied the flute at the Longy School of Music.[South African Music Encyclopedia, edited by Jacques P. Malan. II, 142.'] After these studies, beginning in 1956, Grov\u00e9 taught at the Bard College for two years, and then at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore for a further eight.[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie. X, 455.] While working at the Bard College, Grov\u00e9 also took up a post as choirmaster for the Franklin Street Presbyterian Church, where he pursued an interest in the performance of early music\u2014most notably the cantatas of J.S. Bach. A similar venture was undertaken with a group that Grov\u00e9 founded in 1962, the Pro Musica Rara. While abroad, Grov\u00e9 evidently had a viable platform for the performance of his music. Thus, his Elegy for strings was performed in the Washington Gallery in 1952; the Three inventions for the piano was featured at the Salzburg ISCM Festival of 1953; the Sonata for flute and piano was played at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1954; the Harp quintet at Guildhall, London, in 1954; the Partita for orchestra in Brussels, in 1964; the First Symphony was led by Max Rudolph with the Cincinnati Orchestra in 1966; the Violin Concerto was performed that same year in Baltimore, Gabriel Banat being the soloist; and the Sinfonia concertante was recorded in 1973 by the Radio Orchestra of South-West Australia. ==Afrocentrism== Grov\u00e9 returned to South Africa for a sabbatical in 1960 when he lectured at both the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education as well as the South African College of Music. He returned to South Africa permanently in 1972 and, the following year, was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Pretoria. Grov\u00e9 was one of the first white South African composers to incorporate elements of black African music into his own style, \"venturing far beyond mere couleur locale to forge a unique creative synthesis of the indigenous and the \"Western\".\" Grov\u00e9's 'African' stylistic phase was result of a Damascus moment when he overheard a song sung by an African streetworker. The melody haunted him and inspired the Sonata on African Motives for violin and pianoforte (1984). Some other works composed in Grov\u00e9's afrocentirc style are, the Dance Rhapsody (1986), Liedere en danse van Afrika (1990), 7 Boesman-liedere for soprano and string quartet (1990), Gesang van die Afrika-geeste (1993), Nonyana, the Ceremonial Dancer for piano (1994), Afrika Hymnus I for organ (1995), and Afrika Hymnus II for organ (1996). Remembering the African element in Grov\u00e9's mature style, one can trace his development \"from Debussy and Ravel through to Bartok and the neo-classicism of Hindemith, with passing passions for Messiaen and a more lasting fascination for Bach and early counterpoint\".[Stefanus Muller and Chris Walton, 2006, p. 3. A Composer in Africa: Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov\u00e9] He undoubtedly had a better exposure to European and American avant-garde than his contemporaries and that difference can be noticed in the quality of his music. His work, Glimpses. Five Miniatures for Piano (2004) was performed at the ISCM World Music Days in Hong Kong in November 2007.STEFANS GROV\u00c9'S GLIMPSES TO BE PERFORMED He died in Pretoria, aged 91. ==Writing== Apart from his work as a composer, Grov\u00e9 was also a fine writer whose essays and short fiction has received praise from no less a figure than Andr\u00e9 P. Brink. He was also active as a music critic, most notably for the newspapers Rapport and Beeld. ==Legacy== He forms part of a triumvirate of white Afrikaans composers who are considered as \"founding fathers of South African art music\". The other two composers in this category are Arnold van Wyk and Hubert du Plessis. Beyond that, and arguably more significantly, Grov\u00e9 has managed to shape a \"hybrid style\"[Stefanus Muller and Chris Walton, 2006, p. 2. A Composer in Africa: Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov\u00e9] for himself, beginning a new creative phase in a time when it must have amounted to a radical move on his part: he was a white composer\u2014working in a country that was still functioning at the height of P.W. Botha's apartheid administration\u2014whose new style was rejecting any notions of apartheid (separateness) by fusing white South African (Western) and black South African (African) musical languages. Unlike van Wyk and du Plessis, he was \"prepared to consider and eventually to develop consistently a rapprochement between his Western art and his physical, African space\". ==Works== Opera: Die bose wind (Stefans Grov\u00e9), opera in three acts, 1983 Ballet: Ballet suite, 1944 Alice in Wonderland, based on Lewis Carroll, Baltimore 1960 Waratha, 1977 Pinocchio, ballet for children, 3 acts, 1988 Incidental Music: Uit die dagboek van \u2019n soldaat (N.P. van Wyk Louw), 1963 Orchestral works: Elegy, for string orchestra, 1948 Overture, 1953 Konsertante simfonie, for chamber orchestra, 1955 Symphony 1962 Partita, 1962 Kettingrye (Chain Rows), 1978 Vladimir\u2019s Round Table.
