In the 19th century, it was also known as Saint Baoithin's Cross. The original site was submerged during the creation of Poulaphouca Reservoir, and the cross was moved to Burgage cemetery. ==Description== The cross is made of blue-grey granite and stands high. The cross has an unpierced ring, unlike most Celtic crosses, and unusually long arms. There is a decorative boss in the centre of both faces. On the base of the cross is a weathered inscription.http://megalithomania.com/show/site/1187/st_marks_cross.htm ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Wicklow Category:High crosses in the Republic of Ireland ",
