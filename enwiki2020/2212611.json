Originally called the New York State Militia it can trace its lineage back to the American Revolution and the War of 1812. , the New York Guard, a recognized command under the New York State's Military law, has line-item funding in the state budget.The State Guard Sentinel; Volume 1, No. 3 New York Guard, Spring 2008 Now with a unified command structure, formerly the organization contained an Army Division and an Air Division. The missions of the New York Guard include augmentation, assistance, and support of the New York Army National Guard and New York Air National Guard respectively and aide to civil authorities in New York State. New York also has a New York Naval Militia which, with the State Guard and the Army and Air National Guards, is under the command of the Governor of New York, the Adjutant General of New York, and the Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA). The New York Guard is one of the largest and best organized State Guards in the United States. It is historically derived from Revolutionary and Civil War era state military units that were reorganized several times in American history in response to various international and domestic crises. Organized under the Military Law, State of New York, the New York Guard cannot be federalized and cannot be deployed outside New York State without the consent of the governor. Members of the New York Guard are entitled to many of the benefits accorded members of other components of the 'Organized Militia of the State of New York,' the legal collective term describing the New York Army and Air National Guards, New York Naval Militia and New York Guard. These include 'military leave' for employees of state or local governments and many private employers. ==History== The 265th New York State Militia was a small unit of the New York line and could trace its lineage to the War of 1812. The new regiment was given the designation, 14th regiment, which is one of the oldest military organizations in the United States because of its direct lineage through various separate companies, to the militia companies of the Dutch burghers of New Amsterdam.A History of the 14th Regiment N.Y.S.M. Infantry ===Civil War era=== For more detail, see List of New York Civil War Regiments The New York Seventh in Washington, DC, 1861 Many units of the New York State Militia saw service in the American Civil War, after being activated into federal service by President Abraham Lincoln. The activation of state militia by President Abraham Lincoln led to some conflict with State authorities in command of the units: > With the advent of the Civil War in April 1861, the 14th regiment saw its > first war service in guarding the Brooklyn Navy Yard. By mid-April of that > year, the \"Brooklyn Chasseurs\" were ready to leave New York for Washington > D.C. Colonel Alfred Wood advised the Honorable Governor Morgan that the > regiment was prepared to march and had accepted a three-year federal > enlistment. However, the governor would not issue orders for the regiment to > leave New York. While encamped at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, Colonel Wood > and Congressman Moses O'Dell went to see President Lincoln to secure orders > for the regiment to march to Washington. President Lincoln lost no time in > issuing those orders to the 14th Brooklyn. When Governor Morgan learned that > the regiment was preparing to march, he telegraphed Colonel Wood and > inquired \"by what authority\" did he move his regiment, Colonel Wood coolly > replied, \"By the authority of the President of the United States.\"A History > of the 14th Regiment N.Y.S.M. Infantry Following the Civil War, efforts were made to link the varied military units in New York under overall headquarters. As a result of this, the 3rd Brigade, New York State Militia, came into being on August 5, 1886. ===New York Guard created, 1917=== On August 3, 1917, the Adjutant General of New York, in order to comply with the provisions of the State Constitution requiring that troops be available to the Governor for the protection of life and property of the citizens of New York, organized a state military force known as the New York Guard. The new force replaced the New York National Guard, drafted in the service of the United States on August 5, 1917. The force consisted of the First and Second Provisional Regiments, guarding aqueducts and other infrastructure in the southern portion (First Provisional Regiment) and the remaining parts of the state. On January 1, 1919, the Guard numbered 22,000 in active service. After the Armistice, federalized New York National Guard Units were returned to State control.

Babe Ruth was sworn in by Colonel James Austin at the Isle of Safety in Times Square in front of a military tent used for enlistment drives. Once the enlistment papers were filled he symbolically placed them into the open jaws of a horse drawn French 75-millimeter gun. He was then immediately placed under the command of First Sergeant Adrian Jacques who was in charge of the regiment present. He served while he played in the stadium he was destined to rebuild. A May 29 Washington Post article reported that he appeared before General John Joseph Pershing at State, War and Navy building in Washington** once he was fitted and squared away. 104th Field Artillery Armory The 104th Field Artillery underwent several changes over the years while in active duty. The unit served briefly under Federal control on November 5, 1916 for Mexican border control, then returned to state status on November 15, 1916. In addition, the unit was activated for Federal service during World War I and II.
