    "text": "\"Black Magic\" is a song by British girl group Little Mix. It was written by Camille Purcell, Ed Drewett, Edvard F\u00f8rre Erfjord, and Henrik Michelsen. The Norwegian production duo Electric, who previously worked on the group's second studio album Salute (2013), produced the single, with additional production from Matt Rad. It was released on 21 May 2015 as the lead single from their third studio album, Get Weird. \"Black Magic\" received critical acclaim for its upbeat and catchy sound and comparisons were made with the songs from their debut album, DNA (2012). \"Black Magic\" topped the UK Singles Chart with combined sales of 113,000 in its first week, making it the group's first single to top the chart since their 2012 single \"Wings\", and remained at number one for three weeks, becoming the first single by a girl group to do so since Sugababes's \"About You Now\" in October 2007. As of January 2019 the single has been certified double platinum in the UK and gold or higher in ten additional countries, including diamond in Brazil. The single also peaked within the top 10 of the charts in Ireland, Australia and Israel. On the Billboard Hot 100 the single peaked at number 67, becoming their highest- charting single to date in the US. The song was nominated for Choice Love Song at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, and for British Single of the Year and Best British Video of the Year at the 2016 Brit Awards. ==Background and release== On 4 July 2014, Little Mix had announced that they would cancel their tour to focus on recording their third album. The group said that the new album is \"stronger\" and will be about relationships and that is also better than their two previous albums, DNA (2012) and Salute (2013). In February 2015, Little Mix revealed that they had chosen the lead single from their third studio album and also said that it has a \"whole new sound\". They described the song as \"a risk\" and said that it is completely different from what they've done before. They also said that their album was delayed due to the fact that they wrote a whole album but scrapped it, because they thought \"they could do better\". The song's title was accidentally revealed by member Leigh-Anne Pinnock's mother on Twitter on 21 April 2015 by tweeting \"#MixersAreExcitedForBlackMagic yesss mixers it's the new single and it's fantastic\". However, the tweet was deleted shortly after it was posted. On 14 May 2015, Little Mix revealed the song's title to be \"Black Magic\", after the single's cover art surfaced on music identification service Shazam. The single's cover features the group in front of red school lockers with the band's logo featured above the band in a yellow colour and the title of the song below in white. \"Black Magic\" was scheduled to premiere on 26 May, but was later moved forward to 21 May, after the single leaked online the day before. The single was released digitally in the UK on 20 May. It was released as a CD single in Europe and Japan on 24 July. ==Composition== \"Black Magic\" is a dance-pop song that runs for a total length of three minutes and thirty- one seconds. It was written by Edvard F\u00f8rre Erfjord, Henrik Michelsen, Ed Drewett and Camille Purcell, and was produced by the production duo Electric, who previously worked on the group's second studio album, along with Matt Rad (add.). The song's rhythm is influenced by the sounds of the 1980s dance music. The song has a quick tempo of 112 beats per minute and is composed in the key of E major. The band's vocal range in the song runs from G#3 to E5. Talking about the song's message, the group said that it is \"basically that we are the girls with the secret potion and we're going to give it to all the other girls that want to get the man they want to get\" with Pinnock adding that \"it [the potion] is a metaphor for having confidence to get your man\". ==Critical reception== Upon release, \"Black Magic\" was acclaimed by music critics, who welcomed Little Mix's new '80s influenced sound. Matt Bagwell of The Huffington Post called the single \"one of the best pop releases of the year\", complimenting its \"killer chorus\" and \"trademark call to arms chant\", while writing that \"Black Magic\" is \"significantly better\" than Britney Spears and Iggy Azalea's single \"Pretty Girls\", which Little Mix co-wrote. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song 5 out of 5 stars saying \"not only was it the perfect song for this point in their career, but one powerful enough to bewitch those beyond their expected demographic.\" Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly described the song as \"bouncy\" and \"incredible catchy\". Jocelyn Vena of Billboard noted Little Mix's \"soaring vocals over a shimmery melody\". The Guardian compared the song to the \"carefree joy\" of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", while also comparing the song to those of their debut album DNA. Billboard ranked the song at number 34 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. ==Chart performance== On the UK Singles Chart, the song entered at number one and stayed there for three consecutive weeks. \"Black Magic\" had the fourth highest debut of the year in the UK, as well as the biggest preorder sales of 2015. In its first week, the song had combined sales of 113,000, including 1.19 million streams, and it became their first UK number-one single since their 2012 single \"Wings\". In its second week the song remained at number one and had combined sales of 66,000, including 1.87 million streams. In its third week the song continued at number one and had combined sales of 60,000, including 1.97 million streams. They became the first girl group to have a number one remain there for longer than a week since Sugababes' \"About You Now\" in 2007. On 13 November 2015 the song was certified platinum in the United Kingdom for combined sales exceeding 600,000. It became the first song by a girl group to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom since \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\" by A. R. Rahman and The Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger in 2009. On the Irish Singles Chart, the song peaked at number three. The song debuted at 25 on the Australian singles chart and two weeks later, it peaked at number eight.

The music video for the song was directed by Director X and was filmed at the University of Southern California on 22\u201323 May 2015 in Los Angeles. Talking about the video, Jesy Nelson also said to an interview in Capital FM that \"we [the band] are acting which is exciting! They're like little mini movies which is exciting\". Jade Thirlwall also said that \"it's nothing like we've done before and it's like a movie\". Just one day before its release, Leigh-Anne Pinnock posted on Twitter: \"OMG! Can't believe the #BlackMagicVideo is live tomorrow on @Vevo_UK at 8am! So excited for you guys to see!\" The video premiered online on the band's Vevo channel on 29 May 2015. Following the release of the video, the band posted several tweets on their account reacting to the fans' opinions for the music video. The video begins showing the campus, then introduces the band, who are dressed as nerds carrying their textbooks while exiting at a school building in the campus. During that, Jade suddenly falls off a pavement, causing also Leigh-Anne to fall also and Jesy avoided. They see a good looking male student (Mikey Grand) wave at them and become excited. However, he's actually waving to the beautiful and popular female student (Stefanie Michova) behind them, who nastily shoves them aside to approach the boy. The scene then changes to the library, where we see Jade take off her Beats headphones and search for a book. Out of nowhere, an old book falls on top of her head, unveiling some of its own powers. Later in the night, the girls open the book and use it to gain magical power. Perrie then turns her hair purple, Leigh-Anne has yellow fire powers, Jesy has blue powers, and Jade levitates her glasses. The girls change into their normal selves; becoming the real Little Mix, as some of the male students' jaws drop as the girls walk by. They then embarrass the spiteful girl from the previous day by magically causing her to constantly pass gas. She then runs away in humiliation to the bathroom, while the scene changes to a geeky boy being humiliated by four beautiful but vindictive girls. The band feels sorry for the boy, so they make the girls fall in love with him. The girls then walks down the hall as everybody stares, intertwined with a scene of the girls standing back to back as the camera circles them. The scene then switches to a classroom, where the students aren't paying attention to the teacher. The girls use their magic to transform the classroom into a full on dance party, and then even the teacher (along with students) dance on the desks and chairs. They continue the party down the hallways of the school, as the video ends with \"By Director X\". === Reception === The Craft. The video was received positively both by the fans and the critics. Critics noted references of witch-themed films and television shows such as The Craft, Charmed and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, as well as the music video for \"Too Much\" by the Spice Girls. Both Rigby from Digital Spy and Forrester from Mirror described the video as spellbinding. Additionally, Forrester from Mirror said that the band \"turned to Katy Perry for inspiration and the results are hilarious\" and also compared the scene of the girls walking down the hall with the 1999 film She's All That. Lucy Wood of Cosmopolitan said that the video is \"a brilliant combo of Clueless, Sabrina The Teenage Witch and The Craft all in one go\". Capital FM wrote, \"Take a dash of Sabrina The Teenage Witch, add a pinch of Mean Girls and throw in a little Charmed, and you've got yourself an INCREDIBLE video!\" However, the music video also received some negative reviews. Mace Entertainment criticised the message of the video, saying that \"the general message that we get from the video is that if you want people to like you, shorten the length of your clothes, plump up your hair, wear more makeup, and embarrass other people\". The video peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Twitter Top Tracks on 27 June 2015. ==Live performances== Little Mix performing at the Gibraltar Music Festival on 5 September 2015.
