The house has been a listed building since 1999. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Kontorhaus District.World Heritage explained - Kontorhaus district The ground plan of the building adapts to the Schopenstehl and Kattrepel streets, which run at a slightly acute angle. The rounding off of the building towards the street corner was unusual for the time and became stylistically influential for many of the following buildings. The four upper floors were built in clinker brickwork. The two plinth floors are plastered. The house is divided horizontally by several cornices. The figures are by Richard Ku\u00f6hl. They represent typical professions on which the Hamburg economy is based. ==Gallery== Miramar-Haus (Hamburg- Altstadt).4.29138.ajb.jpg|Miramar-House Miramar-Haus (Hamburg- Altstadt).Portal.1.29138.ajb.jpg|Main entrance Miramar-Haus x1 Bergmann.jpg|Mine worker Miramar-Haus x2 Baumeister.jpg|Architect Miramar-Haus x3 Kaufmann.jpg|Merchant Miramar-Haus y3 Seemann.jpg|Sailor Miramar-Haus y2 Bauer.jpg|Farmer Miramar-Haus y1 Stahlarbeiter.jpg|Steel worker ==References== Category:Brick Expressionism Category:1920s architecture ",
