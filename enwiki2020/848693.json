    "text": "The position of Minister for Women and Gender Equality in the Canadian cabinet has existed since 2018, following the passage of the Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 2 and the creation of the Department for Women and Gender Equality. The position previously existed as the Minister of Status of Women (occasionally designated the Minister responsible for the Status of Women), responsible for Status of Women Canada, an agency under the Department of Canadian Heritage. When the minister legally responsible for Status of Women Canada has been responsible for the file, traditionally, that minister has carried the additional honorary title \"Minister responsible for the Status of Women\" to emphasize this role while when another minister has been charged with the agency; it was necessary to delegate the responsibilities to a minister of state. The position was created in 1971 as a product of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women (created in 1967, report handed down in 1970). Most provincial cabinets have a similar position. Initially, the purpose of the position was to help implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission. ==Ministers== Key: {| class=\"wikitable\" !No. !Portrait !Name !colspan=2|Term of office !Political party !Ministry |- ! colspan=7|Minister of Status of Women |- !style=\"background:; color:white\"| 1. | 50px | Bob Andras | June 11, 1971 || August 7, 1974 | Liberal |rowspan=2| 20 (P.

The position was known as minister of state (status of women) in the first cabinet of Paul Martin, due to its responsibilities being delegated from the Minister of Canadian Heritage but reverted to its old title of minister responsible for the status of women with the swearing in of Liza Frulla in July 2004 as Frulla doubled as Heritage Minister who was ultimately responsible for Status of Women Canada. ==Status of Women Canada now Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE)== In 2018, Status of Women Canada became a federal department called the Department for Women and Gender Equality (WAGE). WAGE administers the Governor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case. One of the programs started by the Status of Women Canada was an education/analysis program called Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+). ==Organizations Funded by the Status of Women Canada== *Girls Action Foundation == References == ==External links== *Status of Women Canada presently being renamed to Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE) *CBC Digital Archives - Equality First: The Royal Commission on the Status of Women Status of Women Category:Department of Canadian Heritage Category:Gender equality ministries Category:Women's organizations based in Canada Category:Women's rights in Canada Canada ",
