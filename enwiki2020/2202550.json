They achieved success, followed by tours throughout Romania and recordings for radio broadcast. At the 2006 MTV Romania Music Awards, Iris won the Best Rock Award and were nominated for Best Band and Best Live Act. == History == Eforie Nord, 1986. From left to right: Mihai Alexandru, Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu, Eugen S\u0103lceanu 'Brebu', Valter Popa, Cristian Minculescu, Doru Borobeic\u0103 'Boro' Iris, Cannes, 1993. From left to right: Valter Popa, Cristi Minculescu, Dan Alex S\u00e2rbu, Boro, Nelu Dumitrescu. Iris began in 1975 with Emil Lechin\u021beanu, Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu and Ion 'Nu\u021bu' Olteanu. Through the years, the band has experienced many line-up changes. In 45 years of activity, Iris became one of the biggest names in Romanian music history. First appearance on an album was in 1978 with the song \"Corabia cu p\u00e2nze\" on \"Forma\u021bii de muzic\u0103 pop III\" compilation album. At the beginning of the 1980s, Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu, Ion 'Nu\u021bu' Olteanu (guitar) and Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu, who are still present in the current line-up, played with Florin Ochescu (guitar) and Mihai 'Marty' Popescu (bass guitar). Together they released a debut-album, Iris I, which included songs that became some of the most popular Romanian rock songs: \"Doar pentru voi\" (\"Only for You\"), \"Trenul f\u0103r\u0103 na\u0219\" (\"The Train without a Ticket-Collector\"), \"Pe ape\" (\"On Water\"), and \"Cei ce vor fi\" (\"Those to Come\"). In 1987, Iris II was released with an extravagant cover depicting the communist regime, a cover which represented one of Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu's idols, Angus Young, \"in action\". The band's line-up was Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu (vocal), Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu (drums), Valter Popa (guitar), Mihai Alexandru (guitar, vocal) and Doru 'Boro' Borobeic\u0103 (bass guitar). On this album, notable songs included \"Strada ta\" (\"Your Street\"), \"\u00cen parc\" (\"In the Park\"), and \"Zi \u0219i noapte\" (\"Day and Night\"). One year later, Iris released its third album, Nu te opri (\"Don't Stop\"), which featured the same line-up as Iris II. The disc contained eight tracks, but the most important are \"Floare de iris\" (\"Iris Flower\"), \"Uit\u0103 tot ce\u2011a fost\" (\"Forget All That Was\"), \"Eu \u0219i cu tine\" (\"Me and You\"), \"Ploaia de vise\" (\"Rain of Dreams\"). In December 1989, when the downfall of the Romanian communist regime began, Iris recorded the album Iris IV in Tomis Studio, without Mihai Alexandru, but with Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu, Ion 'Nu\u021bu' Olteanu, Doru 'Boro' Borobeic\u0103 and Valter Popa. Hits from this album include \"De ce oare ai plecat?\" (\"Why Did You Leave Me?\"), \"Vino iar\" (\"Come Again\"), \"Rock and roll\", and \"Cine m\u0103 strig\u0103 \u00een noapte?\" (\"Who Is Calling Me in the Night?\"). In 1992, Iris held an anniversary concert called Iris 15 ANI (\"Iris 15 years\") at Sala Polivalent\u0103 in Bucharest in front of 10,000 people. This was a record audience for a Romanian band, unequalled since that time. That same year, at the Cannes Festival, Iris won second place in the rock section and they appeared on MTV. The fifth Iris album was named 1993 and was recorded with the Iris IV line-up, plus guitarist Dan Alex S\u00e2rbu. Iris played in Italy and on the Malboro Tour, in the big cities of Romania. In July 1996, following Dorian Ciubuc's idea, Iris signed a contract with Polygram for 6 years. In this time, Iris recorded 6 albums. In October 1998, they released Mirage, an album with a union of tracks and orchestration. The album was co- authored with Mihai Godoroja. In 1997 on October 17, Iris celebrated 20 years of existence with a live performance in Bucharest, featuring both active and former band members. Three weeks later, the band released a celebratory album entitled \"20 DE ANI\" (20 years). The album has 13 tracks from the live concert: \"P\u0103m\u00e2ntul \u00eel cuprind\", \"C\u0103l\u0103torul\", \"Trenul f\u0103r\u0103 na\u0219\", \"Speran\u021ba\", \"Iris, nu pleca\", \"Pe ape\", \"Mirage\", \"Cine m\u0103 strig\u0103 \u00een noapte\", \"Valuri\", \"Floare de iris\", \"Tot zbor\", \"Baby\", \"Somn bizar\". In 2000 the band began the largest tour ever undertaken by a Romanian band. The \"mega-tour\", as it was known, was named ATHENAEUM. The band also released an album of the same name. Two years later, DIGITAL ATHENAEUM, a DVD featuring recordings of concerts on the tour, was released. In 2002, the \"Iris 25 Years\" concert gathered thousands in the biggest concert hall in the country. The next album, M\u0103tase alb\u0103 (\"White Silk\") featured ballads, such as \"Iubire f\u0103r\u0103 de sf\u00e2r\u0219it\" (\"Endless Love\") and a cover version of \"Lady in Black\" by Uriah Heep, which won an MTV Music Award. This album was followed by 4Motion and, in 2005, Iris Maxima. The most notable ballad on Iris Maxima is \"Vino pentru totdeauna\" (\"Come Back for Always\"). On October 5, 2007, the band was honored by Romanian president Traian B\u0103sescu for 30 years of contributions to Romanian culture.Cotidianul - \u201eIris, decora\u021bi de B\u0103sescu\u201d - Articol ap\u0103rut \u00een ziarul Cotidianul, num\u0103rul din 5 octombrie 2007; Accesat la data de 15 iunie 2009 On the same day, the band performed in a live show in the front of over 15,000 fans. In 2009, frontman Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu underwent a liver transplant. The costs of the surgery was partly covered by the Romanian Ministry of Health. The minister of health at the time, Ion Bazac, stated: \"It is a sign of respect and gratitude for an artist who has delighted our souls\". On October 8, 2009, the band performed in the first big concert after the liver transplant. On the occasion of this live performance, Integral Iris, a boxset comprising the band's entire discography, was released. On 22 June 2012 Iris held an anniversary concert in Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei, marking release os album \"Iris 35\".
