It used to also be home to the London Racers, who competed in the top-level British Elite Ice Hockey League. The London Racers controversially withdrew from the British Elite Ice Hockey League after the club decided that the rink was not safe enough for \"elite\" level ice hockey. This was not backed up by any official report and was highly disputed by the park authority. It is thought the safety \"problem\" was used as a smokescreen to mask the team's financial problems. The Lee Valley Lions and the Junior programme continue to the current day. == Additional information == The music video for Sugar Coated Iceberg by The Lightning Seeds, which featured on their 1996 album Dizzy Heights, was filmed inside Lee Valley Ice Centre.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB- tnUqLHyg&list;=RDnB-tnUqLHyg Dancing On Ice rehearsals are also occasionally filmed inside Lee Valley Ice Centre. ==References== == External links == * *Lee Valley Park *Lee Valley Lions *London Racers *Lee Valley Synchronised Skating Category:Sports venues in London Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in England Category:Ice hockey in London ",
