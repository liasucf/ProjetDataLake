The town's name comes from the M\u0101ori language and can mean \"parakeet perch\". Paek\u0101k\u0101riki had a population of 1,665 at the time of the 2013 census, up 66 from the 2006 census. Paek\u0101k\u0101riki lies on a narrowing of the thin coastal plain between the Tasman Sea and the Akatarawa Ranges (a spur of the Tararua Ranges), and thus serves as an important transportation node. To the south, State Highway 1 climbs towards Porirua; to the north the plains extend inland from the Kapiti Coast; at Paek\u0101k\u0101riki the highway and North Island Main Trunk railway run close together between the coast and hills. ==Etymology== The town's name comes from the M\u0101ori language Paek\u0101k\u0101riki. Pae in M\u0101ori can mean 'perch' and k\u0101k\u0101riki 'parakeet', so pae k\u0101k\u0101riki can mean 'parakeet perch'. Though usually written in English without macrons, the New Zealand Geographic Board changed the official name to Paek\u0101k\u0101riki on 21 June 2019. The name was also spelled Paikakariki prior to 1905, but is recorded as Paekakariki as far back as 1850.*Hoy, Douglas West of the Tararuas: An Illustrated History of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company p. 119 (Wellington, Southern Press, 1972) ==History== Paek\u0101k\u0101riki, circa 1930 Prior to European settlement, the area was contested by M\u0101ori groups including Rangit\u0101ne and Mua\u016bpoko. During the 1820s the great war leader Te Rauparaha defeated and expelled the earlier inhabitants and claimed the region for Ng\u0101ti Toa and their allies. Ng\u0101ti Haumia, a hap\u016b of Ng\u0101ti Toa, built their pa by the mouth of the Wainui steam at the northern end of Paek\u0101k\u0101riki. Te Rauparaha, whose pa was on nearby Kapiti Island, died in 1849, the same year that a road connecting Paek\u0101k\u0101riki with Porirua was completed. In 1850 the New Zealand Government resettled Wainui's inhabitants and merged their pa with the new settlement of Paek\u0101k\u0101riki. Paek\u0101k\u0101riki's history has been intimately linked with the railway, and there is a museum at the Paek\u0101k\u0101riki railway station commemorating this heritage. In 1886 the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company's line from Wellington to Longburn was completed, and Paek\u0101k\u0101riki became an important stop on the journey. In 1908, the line was incorporated into the national network of the New Zealand Railways Department and became part of the North Island Main Trunk linking Wellington and Auckland, the North Island's most important line. In 1917, NZR withdrew dining cars from its passenger trains due to World War I economic difficulties and Paek\u0101k\u0101riki became a main refreshment stop on the trip north; originally a temporary measure, the dining cars did not return for decades and Paek\u0101k\u0101riki's status remained until the 1960s. From 1940 the line south to Wellington through the new Tawa Flat deviation was electrified and at Paekakariki engines were changed, with a steam engine depot at Paekakariki. Electrified commuter services were also extended to Paekakariki. The locomotive depot gradually declined in importance due to changing motive power, and nowadays only FP/FT \"Matangi\" class electric multiple units are stabled here. The old steam locomotive depot is now the location of \"The Engine Shed\", the base of Steam Incorporated, one of New Zealand's premier railway preservation societies. The Paekakariki Station Precinct Trust has been established to manage the station area, including the museum and Steam Incorporated's depot, and firmly establish it as a historical and tourist attraction. During the Second World War Paek\u0101k\u0101riki served as a major base for US Marines fighting in the Pacific Campaign. There were three main camps, all situated in or adjacent to present-day Queen Elizabeth Park. At the height of the occupation there were over 20,000 Americans stationed in the region, significantly outnumbering locals. The camps were used for training purposes, as well as rest and recreation for those returning from the Pacific combat zone. Paek\u0101k\u0101riki's steep surrounding hills proved suitable terrain for marching and mortar practice, whilst its beaches were used to stage amphibian invasions. They were the scene of an unfortunate tragedy in June 1943 when a landing craft was swamped by a wave during a nighttime training exercise. Nine men drowned in the heavy surf according to official figures; local rumour put the toll higher. The incident was not reported at the time due to wartime censorship provisions. While the American base in Paek\u0101k\u0101riki was only in existence for a few years it had an important and lingering impact on the region. Several local place names remain as reminders of this wartime presence. Tarawa Street, for example, commemorates one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific War which locally based marines fought in directly after the camps were abandoned in October 1943. ==Local government== Paek\u0101k\u0101riki is administered by the Kapiti Coast District Council and elects the Paek\u0101k\u0101riki Community Board, one of the Council's four community boards. ==Education== Paekakariki School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of . ==In popular culture== * The town was featured in the 1999 song \"Paekakariki Beach\", by the British rock group New Model Army. and in the 1948 song \"Paekakariki, the land of the Tiki\" by Ken Avery. * The town also appeared in an animated documentary by the Simmonds Brothers, entitled: \"Paekakariki: Center of the Universe\". * The American writer Leon Uris was stationed as a marine in Paek\u0101k\u0101riki during World War II. He drew on his experiences there when writing his first novel Battle Cry. * An album entitled \"Paekakariki Moon\" by Warwick Murray, featuring songs written and sounds recorded in the town, was released in 2017. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Paekakariki Surf Lifeguards * Paekakariki in the land of the Tiki (cover of music to 1948 song, with photo of composer Ken Avery) * * Category:Populated places in the Wellington Region Category:Kapiti Coast District ",
