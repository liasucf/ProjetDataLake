    "text": "Marc-Antoine Dequoy (born September 15, 1994) is a professional gridiron football cornerback who is currently a free agent. He played U Sports football for the Montreal Carabins. ==Early life and high school== Dequoy grew up in Montreal on \u00cele-Bizard and began playing organized football at the age of five. He played many positions in youth clubs but mainly safety. He attended C\u00e9gep Andr\u00e9-Laurendeau in 2012 but did not play football, citing a lack of passion. The following year, he transferred to Montmorency College and played five games after trying out for the team. He did not play in 2014 due to a broken left collarbone. In 2015, Dequoy also did not play due to being ruled ineligibile. ==College career== Dequoy enrolled at the University of Montreal and moved up the depth chart on the Carabins football team in 2016. He mainly played on special teams and had 9.5 tackles while appearing in five games. In 2017, Dequoy was a Quebec conference (RSEQ) all-star and a second-team all- star in U Sports after contributing 29.5 tackles and three interceptions in addition to one tackle for loss and four pass breakups in seven games. He was named RSEQ defensive player of the year in 2018. Dequoy was a USports first- team all-Canadian in 2019 after leading the team with 37.5 tackles and three interceptions in eight games. He returned an interception 85 yards for a touchdown versus Laval in the Dunsmore Cup. During the 55th Vanier Cup championship loss against Calgary in November 2019, he suffered a broken right forearm during a tackle. Dequoy was invited to the East\u2013West Shrine Bowl but could not participate due to the injury. During his pro day, Dequoy ran a 4.35-second time in the 40-yard dash, the second-fastest for cornerbacks behind Javelin Guidry, despite suffering from the flu. ==Professional career== After going undrafted in the 2020 NFL draft, Dequoy was signed by the Green Bay Packers on April 26, 2020. He became the first Montreal player to sign with an NFL team on draft weekend and second overall, after David Foucault in 2014. Dequoy was selected 14th overall by the Montreal Alouettes in the 2020 CFL draft. Dequoy was waived by the Packers on August 15, 2020. ==References== ==External links== *Green Bay Packers profile *Montreal Carabins bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian players of American football Category:Sportspeople from Montreal Category:American football cornerbacks Category:Montreal Carabins football players Category:Green Bay Packers players ",
