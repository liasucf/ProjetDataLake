The first formation of the 29th Rifle Corps was known as the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Rifle Corps, composed of troops of the former Lithuanian army, active from the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania in August 1940 until September 1941. A second formation existed from March to April 1943, and a third formation was formed in June 1943. This third formation would continue to exist until May 1945. == First formation - Territorial Rifle Corps == The 29th Lithuanian Territorial Rifle Corps was formed in accordance with an order of the People's Commissar of Defence of 17 August 1940, from the troops of the Lithuanian Army following the forced annexation of that country to the Soviet Union.Nigel Thomas, Germany's Eastern Front Allies (2): Baltic Forces, Osprey, 5.
