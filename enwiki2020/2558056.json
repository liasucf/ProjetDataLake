    "text": "James Francis Hurley (born 1962) is an English convicted murderer and long- term fugitive from justice. Hurley was driving the getaway car in an armed robbery in the town of Hemel Hempstead on 14 April 1988. During the robbery PC Frank Mason of the Hertfordshire Police was shot and killed. He was convicted of murder in 1989, and sentenced to life imprisonment. On 16 February 1994, whilst being transferred to Wandsworth Prison by bus, Hurley and another prisoner managed to escape. He fled the country and managed to remain at liberty for 13 years. On 9 November 2007, Hurley was apprehended by police during a raid on a suspected drug dealer at an address in The Hague, Netherlands. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in Holland and paroled after four years. In November 2011, officers from the tactical team of Hertfordshire Constabulary extradited Hurley from Holland and returned him to a London prison to serve his sentence for the murder of PC Mason. After being recaptured and imprisoned Hurley is now attempting to get his murder conviction overturned. On 30 July 2015, Hurley's appeal to have his conviction for the murder of PC Frank Mason quashed was heard at the Court of Appeal. A court date is yet to be set. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:English people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by England and Wales Category:British people convicted of murdering police officers Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by England and Wales Category:English escapees Category:Escapees from England and Wales detention Category:English prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:British people imprisoned abroad Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Netherlands Category:People extradited from the Netherlands Category:People extradited to the United Kingdom ",
