Chinese cash coins were first produced during the Warring States period, and they became standardised as the Ban Liang (\u534a\u5169) coinage during the Qin dynasty which followed. Over the years, cash coins have had many different inscriptions, and the Wu Zhu (\u4e94\u9296) inscription, which first appeared under the Han dynasty, became the most commonly used inscription and was often used by succeeding dynasties for 700 years until the introduction of the Kaiyuan Tongbao (\u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf3) during the Tang dynasty. This was also the first time regular script was used as all earlier cash coins exclusively used seal script. During the Song dynasty a large number of different inscriptions was used, and several different styles of Chinese calligraphy were used, even on coins with the same inscriptions produced during the same period. These cash coins are known as matched coins (\u5c0d\u9322). This was originally pioneered by the Southern Tang. After the Mongols conquered China the Yuan dynasty largely deprecated copper coinage in favour of paper money. This trend continued under the Ming dynasty. After the Chinese became independent again, during the Ming dynasty, cash coins only contained the reign titles of the emperor. Due to a naming taboo the term \"Yuanbao\" (\u5143\u5bf6) was phased out from cash coin inscriptions as the founder of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang had the word \"Yuan\" (\u5143) in his name. Under the Manchu Qing dynasty the trend of exclusively using the reign title of the Emperor continued, and all cash coins issued during this period were written in regular script. Below is a list of obverse inscriptions that were used on Chinese cash coins organized by period and/or dynasty.Numis' Numismatic Encyclopedia. A reference list of 5000 years of Chinese coinage.

These early round coins (\u571c\u9322, hu\u00e1nqi\u00e1n) circulated alongside the knife and spade money. As most of these early round coins had round holes, the first \"true\" cash coins were the Yi Hua (\u4e00\u5316) produced by the State of Yan. Apart from two small and presumably late coins from the State of Qin, coins from the spade money area have a round hole and refer to the jin and liang units. Those from the knife money area have a square hole and are denominated in hua. === Round hole, no rims, reverses plain and flat === List of early round coins produced between 350 BC and 220 BC:Cao Guicen (\u66f9\u6842\u5c91) (1998). \"Huanqian (\u571c\u9322)\", in Tang Jiahong (\u5510\u5609\u5f18), ed.

Many Emperors of the Song dynasty personally wrote the calligraphy to be inscribed on the cash coin. There are generally three scripts used on Song dynasty era cash coins which include Regular script, Seal script, and Running hand script/Grass script.

Another differentiating feature of Xinjiang as a whole was that under the Jiaqing Emperor it was ordered that 1 in 5 coins produced in Xinjiang should bear the inscription Qianlong Tongbao (\u4e7e\u9686\u901a\u5bf6) to honour the Qianlong Emperor, and celebrate his conquest of the region. New obverse inscriptions were introduced by the Kucha mint during the early twentieth century however the production of \"red cash coins\" with these new inscriptions didn't last very long as they featured only two different dates from the Chinese cyclical calendar during the Guangxu era and the Kucha mint closed in 1909. The following \"red cash coins\" with new inscriptions were produced by the Kucha mint in Xinjiang:Anything Anywhere - CHINA, coins of that western region called Xinjiang/Sinkiang. - Xinjiang means \"new land.\" Formerly known to westerners as \"Chinese Turkestan.\" Approximately 5000 years of history, not particularly well written up in English and perhaps some of the Chinese studies are somewhat politically/ethnically biased.

As merchants who traded with Shanghai entered the Qing those found carrying cash coins issued by rebels were arrested and put on trial and after a few were executed the Shanghai Small Swords society decided that these coins were essentially useless and decided to cast coins based on the Xianfeng reign title. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Li Wenmao who was the leader of the Triad Society in the province of Guangdong proclaimed half to be \"the King who shall restore peace\" (\u5e73\u9756\u738b) in March 1857 but his rebellion got suppressed by the Qing in 1858. The coinage cast by Li Wenmao often contains the character \"\u52dd\" (victory or to vanquish) which is often found in lodges of Tiandihui groups creating the inscription \"\u52dd\u5bf6\" (victorious treasure or vanquishing treasure), meanwhile as the guerilla tactics of the Guangdong Triad relied on having their forces be divided into a \"left flank\", \"right flank\", \"middle flank\", \"front flank\", and \"rear flank\" this is reflected in the reverse inscriptions of the coins cast by this rebellion as \"\u8425\" (garrison or camp) is accompanied by which flank the garrison belonged to. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
