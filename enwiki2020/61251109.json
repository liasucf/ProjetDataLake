Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of education exclusion in the world. Despite being the region with the fastest growing school-age population, \u201cmore than 70% of countries face teacher shortages in primary schools, while 90% do not have enough secondary teachers\u201d. Over one-fifth of children between the ages of 6-11 are out of school and one-third of youth between the ages of 12-14 are out of school. . Almost 60% of youth between the ages of 15-17 are not in school. According to Harvard professor and education researcher Dana Charles McCoy, the problem starts in early childhood, with 44% of children aged 3-4 in Africa experiencing low cognitive and social emotional development. As a result, many enter school with insufficient learning readiness McCoy et al, 2016. According to the Brookings Institution, \u201cless than 7 percent of students in late primary school are proficient in reading, against 14 percent in mathematics.\u201d In Tanzania, 55% of 10-16 year olds fail baseline math and reading tests set for an 8 year old, and over half of primary students do not own a single text book. The State of Education in Africa Report 2015 states, \u201cThe power of effective teaching can transform children for the rest of their lives. However a severe shortage of trained teachers is a stark reality.\u201d In Tanzania, the rate of teacher absenteeism is 24% . This leads to many children attending school but not learning. Almost half of Africa\u2019s population are children, and 2 billion more will be born in the next 35 years. Ubongo claims that its aim is to \u201cfill this gap at low cost and massive scale to help Africa\u2019s next generation realize their full potential.\u201d === Origins === Ubongo was founded by Nisha Ligon, Rajab Semtawa, Cleng'a Ng'atigwa, Tom Ng'atigwa and Arnold Minde. == Languages == Ubongo broadcasts its children\u2019s cartoons and radio content in Kiswahili, English, French and Kinyarwanda. == Impact == According to research and program evaluations, watching Ubongo\u2019s educational cartoons leads to improved learning outcomes for children. Tanzanian kids aged 3-6 who watch \u201cAkili and Me\u201d outperform non-viewers by 24% in counting, 12% in number recognition, 10% in shape recognition, 13% in English language and 8% in fine motor skills when accounting for age, gender, socio-economic status, and baseline knowledge.
