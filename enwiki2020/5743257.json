    "text": "Grumpy Old Bookman is a literary blog started by Michael Allen in late March 2004. A number of the essays and reviews posted there were brought together in his 2005 book Grumpy Old Bookman. The Grumpy Old Bookman is aimed at both readers and writers, and the content deals almost entirely with books and publishing, including such issues as advances for writers and the quality of publishers' review processes. It soon acquired a reputation for plain speaking and controversy. A typical entry will either be a lengthy review of a book, or the author's thoughts on some aspect of the book world, inspired by an item of recent news. In February 2005 the GOB blog was listed by The Guardian as one of the top ten literary blogs.Guardian Unlimited Books' top 10 literary blogs: Our pick of the best the online books community has to offer at the Guardian (via archive.org); published 7 February 2005; retrieved April 19, 2014 In November 2007 Allen announced on his blog that he was taking a \"sabbatical\";Sabbatical, at Grumpy Old Bookman; by Michael Allen; published 25 November 2007; retrieved 19 April 2014 he resumed blogging in May 2012.Well, I'm back, at Grumpy Old Bookman; by Michael Allen; published 12 May 2012; retrieved 19 April 2014 ==References== ==External links== *The Grumpy Old Bookman litblog Category:Essays in literary criticism Category:British literature websites ",
