    "text": "No Rewind is the debut album by the Orchestra, released in 2001. ==Overview== The album was recorded without financial support from any record labels and was produced by Eric Troyer, Parthenon Huxley and Jim Jacobsen. Ten tracks and more were recorded in studios in Los Angeles and New York over a -year period. No Rewind contains the Bev Bevan co-authored composition \"Over London Skies\", \"The Diary of Horace Wimp\" soundalike \"Jewel & Johnny\", and a cover of \"Twist and Shout\" which begins in a slow, plaintive minor key with arpeggiated chords before building to the familiar, rocking major progression. The album was reissued in 2005 in Argentina and again in 2006 in the UK with edited track 10. ==Cover art== Three versions were released with three different cover designs. The first pressing cover art was simply silver/grey with the band logo in black in the style of the Beatles logo. The second, designed by band guitarist Parthenon Huxley showed a reel-to-reel deck carved in stone. The third was designed by George Reed, the long-time art/film director for both ELO Part II and the Orchestra. This edition pictures a man standing at a computer console as it spills out piles of data tape with the words NO REWIND spelled out in L.E.D. letters on an indicator screen - throughout the image there are several hidden references to the band's past.
