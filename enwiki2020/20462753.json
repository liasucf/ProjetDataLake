His unpredictable nature is often an asset and at times a flaw in his character but remains an important player when on the field. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=10|Milton Keynes Dons |2008\u201309 |League One |7||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||1 |- |2009\u201310 |League One |2||1||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||0||0||2||1 |- |2010\u201311 |League One |29||9||1||0||0||0||2||1||32||10 |- |2011\u201312 |League One |43||6||4||2||3||2||3||1||53||11 |- |2012\u201313 |League One |34||7||2||0||2||0||1||0||39||7 |- |2013\u201314 |League One |32||1||3||0||0||0||1||0||36||1 |- |2014\u201315 |League One |42||8||2||0||4||1||1||1||49||10 |- |2015\u201316 |Championship |22||2||2||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||26||2 |- |2016\u201317 |League One |20||2||3||1||1||0||3||0||27||3 |- !colspan=2|Total !231||37||17||3||12||3||11||3||271||46 |- |Crawley Town (loan) |2009\u201310 |Conference Premier |3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0 |- |Forest Green Rovers (loan) |2009\u201310 |Conference Premier |24||6||4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||29||6 |- |Darlington (loan) |2010\u201311 |Conference Premier |5||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||5||1 |- |rowspan=3|Northampton Town |2017\u201318 |League One |29||2||1||0||0||0||2||0||32||2 |- |2018\u201319 |League Two |35||6||1||0||0||0||5||0||41||6 |- !colspan=2|Total !64||8||2||0||0||0||7||0||73||8 |- |rowspan=3|Crewe Alexandra |2019\u201320 |League Two |30||9||3||0||0||0||0||0||33||9 |- |2020\u201321 |League One |2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !32||9||3||0||0||0||0||0||35||9 |- !colspan=3|Career total !359||61||26||3||12||3||19||3||416||70 |} ==Honours== Milton Keynes Dons *Football League One runner-up: 2014\u201315 Individual *Milton Keynes Dons Young Player of the Year: 2010\u201311 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Luton Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Milton Keynes Dons F.C. players Category:Crawley Town F.C. players Category:Forest Green Rovers F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ",
