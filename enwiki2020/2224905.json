    "text": "Jam\u00f3n (, pl. jamones) is a kind of dry-cured ham produced in Spain. It is one of the most globally recognized food items of Spanish cuisine (along with other dishes such as gazpacho and paella). It is also regularly a component of tapas.Casas, P. (1985). Introduction. In Tapas, the little dishes of Spain (xv) [Introduction]. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Most jam\u00f3n is commonly called jam\u00f3n serrano in Spain. Jam\u00f3n is the Spanish word for ham. As such, other ham products produced or consumed in Spanish-speaking countries may also be called by this name. thumb ==Description== Jam\u00f3n is typically consumed in slices, either manually carved from a leg on a jamonero stand using a sharp thin slicing knife, or cut from the deboned meat with a rotatory cold-cut slicer. It's also regularly consumed in any shape in small portions. As a product, Jam\u00f3n is similar to Portuguese presunto and to Italian prosciutto, but the production differs by a longer curing phase (up to 18 months), giving it a dryer texture, deeper color and stronger flavour than the former. A whole Jam\u00f3n leg is considerably cheaper by weight than its sliced counterpart because it includes the bone and non-edible fat. Once the external fat layers are removed and the meat is exposed, though, the product must be consumed as soon as possible since a progressive drying and deteriorating process starts. This is not an issue for restaurateurs and retailers, since they go through product much faster than an individual. Home users will typically choose sliced product, be it freshly cut from a deli stand, commercially pre-packaged or vacuum preserved. Jam\u00f3n is safe to consume for as long as is kept in its leg in a dry and cool environment and direct sunlight is avoided, but it must be kept refrigerated once cut away from the leg. Jam\u00f3n may also be smoked in some regions and it is consumed, mostly for personal use. This is common in the southern area of Castile and Le\u00f3n as well as parts of Extremadura. Such a jam\u00f3n has a harder texture and smoky-salty flavour. Though widely available (even if on the expensive side) in Spain and accessible in some of the European Union, import duties and trade or food safety restrictions that apply to foreign meat products in international markets may raise substantially the prices while creating a scarcity, often making jam\u00f3n a prohibitively costly product to import and offer overseas. There are two main commercial labels for jam\u00f3n, based on the pig breed and protected designations: * Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, made from the black Iberian pig and may be consumed internationally as a delicacy * Jam\u00f3n serrano (meaning ham from the sierra), which includes most other varieties A jam\u00f3n serrano leg from Teruel in a cutting stand == Jam\u00f3n serrano == The term jam\u00f3n serrano (\"serrano ham\", ham from the sierra, or mountain range) is regularly applied as an umbrella culinary term for all dry- cured jam\u00f3n produced in Spain, as opposed to jam\u00f3n de York, which is baked or boiled in salted fluid. It is most precisely applied, though, to jam\u00f3n produced from white and/or non-Ib\u00e9rico breeds of pig. This is the most commonly produced and consumed range of jam\u00f3n in Spain. The majority of jamones serranos are produced from a landrace breed of white pigs or from commercial breeds such as Duroc. Jam\u00f3n serrano, described variously as jam\u00f3n reserva, jam\u00f3n curado, and jam\u00f3n extra or any generic jam\u00f3n nomenclature, is produced from compound-fed white pigs. Jam\u00f3n serrano has TSG (Traditional Specialities Guaranteed) status.EC PDO/PGI/TSG List The TSG certification attests that a particular food product objectively possesses specific characteristics that differentiate it from all others in its category and that its raw materials, composition, or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years. === Production === Fresh hams are trimmed and cleaned, then stacked and covered with salt for about two weeks to draw off excess moisture and preserve the meat from spoiling. The salt is then washed off and the hams are hung to dry for about six months. Finally, the hams are hung in a cool, dry place for 6 to 18 months, depending on the climate, as well as the size and type of ham being cured. The drying sheds (secaderos) are usually built at higher elevations, which is why the ham is called \"mountain ham\". Retail jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico in Barcelona == Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico == Pork products made from Iberian-breed pigs receive the ib\u00e9rico/a denomination. As such, jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico is the dry-cured jam\u00f3n produced from livestock of these breeds. Ib\u00e9rico encompasses some of the most expensive ham produced in the world, and its fatty marbled texture has made it very popular as a delicacy, with a hard to fulfill global demand comparable to that of kobe beef. Since jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico production and export is limited, buyer should beware and not fall victim of bait-and-switch or quality fraud similar to that of olive oil, since it has been estimated that a sizable portion of both local market and exports are not actually ib\u00e9rico. Spain regulation defines trade labeling for all ib\u00e9rico products. == European Union protected designation of origin == Traditional jamon marketed in Barcelona. Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (EU), certain well-established meat products, including some local jam\u00f3n and jam\u00f3n producers, are covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO) or protected geographical indication (PGI): * Jam\u00f3n de Teruel has PDO status. * Jam\u00f3n de Los Pedroches has PDO status. * Jam\u00f3n Dehesa de Extremadura has PDO status. * Jam\u00f3n de Guijuelo has PDO status. * Jam\u00f3n de Huelva has PDO status. * Jam\u00f3n de Trev\u00e9lez has PGI status. A paletilla from alt= ==Paleta== The paleta de cerdo or paletilla is a product similar to jam\u00f3n; it is made from the front leg of a pig, instead of the hind leg used for jam\u00f3n, cured using the same process and consumed in the same way. Since whole legs are sold by weight and paletillas are lighter, they are often marketed towards home consumption. A paletilla may be described or marketed as Ib\u00e9rica when produced from the same livestock as Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico. ==See also== *Lac\u00f3n Gallego *Ham * *List of dried foods *Curing (food preservation) *Spanish cuisine ==References== ==External links== Category:Ham Category:Spanish cuisine ",
