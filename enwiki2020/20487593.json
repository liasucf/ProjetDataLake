From 1927 onwards, it was an autonomous structure inside the Czechoslovak labour centre OS\u010c. The organization was dissolved as Czechoslovakia fell under German occupation. ==Early period== The organization was founded in July 1919. In 1920 the name Gewerkschaftsbund was adopted, and a headquarters was set up in Liberec.McDermott, Kevin.
