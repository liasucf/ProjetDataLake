The Youth Olympic Games are multi-sport event and the games are held every four years just like the Olympic Games. With sailing limited to four events sailing has chosen to feature athlete under 16 in two disciplines. This allows older youth competitors in sailing to focus on the Olympic disciplines through events like the ISAF Youth Sailing World Championships as the games could permit sailors up to 18 years old. ==Participating nations== {| |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |colspan=30 bgcolor=lightgray| |- ! align=left| Male Windsurfing ||21 ||20 || ||41 |- ! align=left| Female Windsurfing ||18 ||21 || ||39 |- ! align=left| Male Dinghy ||29 ||30 || ||59 |- ! align=left| Female Dinghy ||32 ||30 || ||62 |- ! align=left| Sailors ||100 ||101 || ||201 |- ! align=left| Continents ||6 ||6 || ||N/A |- ! align=left| Countries ||60 ||62 || ||N/A |- ! align=left| New Countries ||60 ||18 || ||78 |- |} ==Medal table== :As of the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. ==Medalist by Games == ===2010 Youth Olympic Games Events=== {| |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Male Dinghy 2010: Byte CII | | | |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Female Dinghy 2010: Byte CII | | | |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Male Windsurfer x20px 2010: Techno 293 | | | |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Female Windsurfer x20px 2010: Techno 293 | | | |- |} ===2014 Youth Olympic Games Events=== {| |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Male Dinghy 2014: Byte CII | | | |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Female Dinghy 2014: Byte CII | | | |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Male Windsurfer x20px 2014: Techno 293 | | | |- | style=\"align:center;\" | Female Windsurfer x20px 2014: Techno 293 | | | |- |} ===2018 Youth Olympic Games Events=== {| |- | Techno 293+ | | | |- | IKA Twin Tip Racing | | * * * |Not awarded |- | Techno 293+ | | | |- | IKA Twin Tip Racing | | * * * |Not awarded |- | Nacra 15 | | | |} ==See also== *Sailing at the Summer Olympics ==External links== * ISAF Youth Olympics Microsite Website * ISAF Techno 293 Microsite Website * International Techno 293 Class Association Website * ISAF Byte Microsite Website * International Byte Class Association Website * Youth Olympic Games Category:Sports at the Summer Youth Olympics Youth Olympics ",
