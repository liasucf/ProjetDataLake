The group was founded in June 1988 (date of the debut album) by its frontman, then young singer and 23-year-old student Mladen Vidovi\u0107. The group had seven members, teenagers, upon its foundation. Nemogu\u0107e vru\u0107e is characterized by not having usual affluence of well known \"Sarajevo pop-rock school\" in their music and lyrics i.e. folk elements are not present; their music is also somewhat \"sweet pop\". Zenica group has been active since 1986 until 1990s when they disbanded due to Bosnian War. On 16 April 2011, group members reunited (after 23 years of pause) in Zenica for a return concert \u2013 location of the performance was restaurant \"Tapas\" (former \"Kasina\"); on 25 November (BiH Statehood Day) 2011, they reunited for a return concert in Sarajevo \u2013 location of the performance was club \"Cinemas-Sloga\".
