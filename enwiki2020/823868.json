His mother was Sybil Augusta Judd (1843\u20131906), daughter of Gerrit P. Judd, and his father was businessman Henry Alpheus Peirce Carter. Carter was educated at Fort Street School in Honolulu (now McKinley High School), Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and Yale University. He married Helen Strong, daughter of Eastman Kodak president Henry A. Strong April 19, 1892. They had four children: Elizabeth (born August 25, 1895), Phoebe (born September 27, 1897), a daughter who died on June 17, 1903, and George Robert, Jr. (born November 10, 1905). After Yale, Carter spent time serving an apprenticeship with Seattle National Bank. He formed a rowing club with W. B. Goodwin, fellow Hawaiian Hiram Bingham and Marshall Latham Bond, whose members turned their boats over to the University of Washington to begin its rowing program when it broke up. In 1895 Carter returned to Hawaii to become the cashier of C. Brewer & Co., where his father had been a senior partner from 1862 to 1874. From 1898 to 1902, he helped organize and manage the Hawaiian Trust Company, and was managing director of the Hawaiian Fertilizer Company. In addition, he served as a director for Bank of Hawaii, C. Brewer, and Alexander & Baldwin. ==Political career== Carter was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate from Oahu in 1901. While a territorial senator, he was sent to Washington as an unofficial agent to discuss territorial matters with President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt eventually appointed him Secretary of the Territory in 1902, and then Territorial Governor in 1903, succeeding Sanford B. Dole who resigned to become a federal judge. In 1905, during Carter's administration, the current system of county governments was created; the five county governments (Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Hawaii, and Kalawao) took effect on January 1, 1906. (Oahu County later became the City and County of Honolulu in 1909.) ==Final years and death== After his retirement and until his death on February 11, 1933 in Honolulu, Hawaii, Carter remained active in the community. Carter was a member of the Hawaiian Historical Society and engaged in historical research, collecting valuable books and documents. In 1922, Carter donated his collection to the Hawaiian Mission Children's Society, which continues to maintain it as well as the Mission Houses Museum. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery. Carter's estate was appraised at $1,153,902. His will provided for a $25,000 bequest to Kauikeolani Children's Hospital. His wife Helen Strong Carter received one-third of his estate, with his two living children receiving the remaining two-thirds.; ==References== ==External links== * * Descendants of Thomas Hastings website * Descendants of Thomas Hastings on Facebook Category:Members of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature Category:20th- century American politicians Category:Governors of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Phillips Academy alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Hawaii Republicans Category:1866 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Burials at Oahu Cemetery Category:Thomas Carter family ",
