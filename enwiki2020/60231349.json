    "text": "The 2017 Isle of Anglesey County Council election, to the Isle of Anglesey County Council was held on 4 May 2017 as part of the 2017 United Kingdom local elections. All 30 council seats were up for election. The previous full election took place in 2013 and the next one is scheduled for 2022. ==Overall results== Following the election Plaid Cymru gained two additional seats overall to become the largest party with 14 councillors. The Independents, ruling the council prior to the election, were reduced to 13 councillors. Previous Independent Group leader, Ieuan Williams, stood down from this position prior to the election. The Independent council leader prior to 2013, Bryan Owen, won a seat in the Bro Aberffraw ward, having previously lost his Canolbarth M\u00f4n seat in May 2013. He won by only 6 votes, though a recount was refused by the returning officer. Later that month Plaid Cymru leader, Llinos Medi, was the only candidate to put herself forward as leader and Plaid Cymru consequently led the council with the help of support from some Independent members. ==References== 2017 Category:2017 Welsh local elections ",
