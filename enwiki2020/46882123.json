    "text": "Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n is located in the Sey\u00e9 Municipality in the state of Yucat\u00e1n in southeastern Mexico. It is one of the properties that arose during the nineteenth century henequen boom. There are numerous other properties of this name in the Yucat\u00e1n including Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n in Baca, Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Halach\u00f3), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Hom\u00fan), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Motul), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Tixkokob), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Tunk\u00e1s), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n Uc\u00ed and Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n de Valencia. ==Toponymy== The name (Kancabch\u00e9n) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground. ==How to get there== Follow highway 180 east out of M\u00e9rida toward Valladolid for approximately 24 km. Turn right and head south to Sey\u00e9, approximately 6.5 km. Go north on Calle 26 approximately 2 km and turn right heading east toward Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n. In approximately 3 km, the property will be on the right hand side. ==History== ==Demographics== All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n houses only the owner's immediate family. According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, there were no permanent inhabitants of the hamlet. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" |+ Population of Kankabch\u00e9n by year |- !
