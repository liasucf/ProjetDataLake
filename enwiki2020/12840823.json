Sterling Pub. Co. p. 270. == Life == === Early years === Luis Antonio Jaime de Borb\u00f3n y Farnesio was born the youngest son of King Philip V, King of Spain, and his second wife, Elisabeth Farnese. While barely eight years of age, Luis was created 699th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1735 and ordained Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain on 9 September 1735, and subsequently named Cardinal-Priest of the Title of the church of Santa Maria della Scala (pro hac vice) in Rome on 19 December. On 18 December 1754 he abandoned the ecclesiastical life for lack of vocation, renounced his ecclesiastical titles and dignities and assumed the title of 13th Conde de Chinch\u00f3n (Count of Chinch\u00f3n) granted by his brother Infante Felipe. When his older half-brother King Ferdinand VI died without issue in 1759, Luis claimed the throne on the grounds that, he was the only surviving son of Philip V still residing in Spain (his older brothers were Charles, King of Naples and Sicily, and Philip, Duke of Parma, both reigning in Italy). However valid his claim, Luis lost the succession to his oldest brother Charles, while Charles's third son became Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Infante Luis was a patron of the arts and culture, and admirer of musician Luigi Boccherini, architect Ventura Rodr\u00edguez and painters Francisco de Goya, Luis Paret y Alc\u00e1zar, and Charles Joseph Flipart. \"The Family of Philip V of Spain 1743\"; (L-R) Mariana Victoria, Princess of Brazil; Barbara, Princess of Asturias; Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias; King Philip V; Luis, Count of Chinch\u00f3n; Elisabeth Farnese; Infante Philip; Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France; Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela; Infanta Maria Antonia; Maria Amalia, Queen of Naples and Sicily; Charles, King of Naples and Sicily.

King Charles III, fearful of his brother, exiled Luis far away from the Court of Madrid. In 1776 at Olias del Rey Luis contracted a morganatic marriage with an Aragonese aristocrat, Mar\u00eda Teresa de Vallabriga. This was much to the liking of Charles, because Luis now could not have children with a better claim to the throne. ===Children=== Since Luis's children had been born of a morganatic marriage, they could not receive royal titles, and thus the descendants of Charles were the legitimate Spanish heirs (even though the children of Charles had been born in Naples). The couple had four children: # Luis Mar\u00eda de Borb\u00f3n y Vallabriga, 14th Count of Chinch\u00f3n (Cadalso de los Vidrios, 1777 - Madrid, 1823); # a stillborn; # Mar\u00eda Teresa de Borb\u00f3n y Vallabriga, 15th Countess of Chinch\u00f3n; married in the Escorial, Madrid, 2 October 1797 Manuel de Godoy y \u00c1lvarez de Faria, 1st Principe de la Paz, 1st Duque de Alc\u00fadia and 1st Duque de Sueca (Badajoz, 12 May 1767 \u2013 Paris, 4 October 1851), and had issue, an only daughter Carlota Luisa Manuela. # Mar\u00eda Luisa de Borb\u00f3n y Vallabriga (Toledo, 21 March 1780 - Paris, 1 December 1846), 98th Noble Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Mar\u00eda Luisa on 10 October 1800, married in 1817 Joaqu\u00edn Jos\u00e9 de Melgarejo y Saur\u00edn, de Rojas y Ru\u00edz-D\u00e1valos (Cox, Alicante, 23 January 1780 - Madrid, 9 April 1835), 3rd Marqu\u00e9s de Melgarejo and 1st Duke of San Fernando de Quiroga Grandee of Spain First Class with a Coat of Arms of de Melgarejo, 39th Minister of External Affairs of Spain (12 September 1819 \u2013 18 March 1820), without issue. She is the last surviving grandchild of Philip V of Spain. Charles had a great deal of appreciation and devotion to his younger brother, and even during his exile, Luis was treated quite well by the Spanish court. Luis loved his brother equally as much, which is why Luis later accepted Charles as king and accepted his exile. Despite this, Luis remained bitter and saddened by the fact that he lost the opportunity to be king. Luis died disgraced and in internal exile in 1785.
