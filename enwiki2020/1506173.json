    "text": "Lugaid Laigdech, son of Eochu mac Ailella, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He helped Dui Ladrach overthrow Airgetmar, and later killed Dui to take the kingship himself. He ruled for seven years, until he was killed by Airgetmar's grandson \u00c1ed R\u00faad. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes III of Persia (358-338 BC).R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 261 The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 537-530 BC,Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 738-731 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M4462-4469 Keating refers to a story that Lugaid, when hunting, once met a hideous hag wearing a magic mask. When he slept with her he took off her mask, and dreamed that she became a beautiful young woman. Keating interprets this as an allegory of Ireland, meaning that Lugaid first endured toil and torment, and then enjoyed pleasure, over her. He also tells a story from the C\u00f3ir Anmann (\"fitness of names\") about a certain Lugaid Lo\u00edgde, one of the five sons of D\u00e1ire Doimthech, all of whom were called Lugaidh. A druid prophesied to D\u00e1ire that one of his sons would rule Ireland. When D\u00e1ire asked which one, he was told to take all five to Tailtiu and pursue a beautiful fawn which would appear to them there, and the one who outran it would be king. They chased it from Tailtiu to Howth, where a magical mist obscured all five from the men of Ireland. The son who caught and killed the fawn was Lugaidh Laighdhe. However, as this Lugaidh has a different father, Keating does not believe he is the same man. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
