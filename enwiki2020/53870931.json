Sports Illustrated described the event as \"part trade show, part research conference and 100% festival of copious cannabis consumption\". == History == The event in 2010 At the beginning of the year 2001, a group of Spanish businessmen decided to adopt the idea of other fairs about hemp that were held in Europe. For several months they were looking for the site that hosted a contest of this type, seeking political support and the uncertainty of facing impediments to be a fair on a controversial plant. In 2002, the first Spannabis was held at the Palau Sant Jordi. The second edition of Spannabis was held at the Fira de Cornell\u00e1, where it has been held ever since. In 2011 Italian politicians protested against the celebration of Spannabis asking Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero for explanations.Senatori Pdl a ministro Frattini: \"Vergognosa fiera della cannabis a Barcellona dal 25 al 27 febbraio\", sostanze.info, 22 February 2011 During the following editions, Spannabis was consolidated and the exhibition space has been extended to reach 13,000 m2 until 2015Spannabis 2015 in Barcelona Spain, marijuanagames.org, 28 January 2015 and in 2017 it has been expanded to reach 18,000 m2.La feria cann\u00e1bica Spannabis crece y espera unos 30.000 visitantes en Cornell\u00e0, La Vanguardia, 10 March 2017 There were 35,000 visitors in 2014Barcelona \u2013 Die Haupstadt der Hanf-Renaissance in Spanien, thcene 3/2014 and 30,000 visitors in 2017 and 2018.Spannabis 2017 review.
