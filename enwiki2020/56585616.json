It is located in Okinawa Prefecture and encompasses the cities of Urasoe and Ginowan, and Nakagami District. As of 2016, 288,070 eligible voters were registered in the district.Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC): The district has been represented by Kantoku Teruya of the Social Democratic Party since 2003. Teruya is the only SDP politician in the country to currently hold a single-seat constituency. == Background == The district has been considered a stronghold for veteran Social Democrat Kantoku Teruya, who has held the district continuously since 2003. Such is the strength of the SDP vote in the district that during the LDP landslides in 2005 and 2012, Teruya still managed to hold the district comfortably. The significant presence of US military bases in Ginowan is regarded as a major factor contributing to the wide aversion of the local population to voting LDP candidates, who are typically pro-base. Okinawa-2nd is also one of the few districts that the JCP regularly skips from contesting. The party has continuously endorsed Teruya in each election since 2009. Other centre-left parties have also generally refrained from contesting the district and regularly back Teruya in general elections. == List of representatives == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=bottom !
