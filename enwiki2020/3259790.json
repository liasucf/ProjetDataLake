    "text": "Jacques de Coras (1625 \u2013 24 December 1677) was a French poet born in Toulouse. Grandson of the Huguenot jurist Jean de Coras, he was raised in the Protestant Reformed Church of France. After serving as a cadet in the military, he studied theology, and exercised the functions of a Protestant minister in Guyenne. He was, during the same time, associated with the person of Turenne, and he converted to Catholicism. He mixed to good effect his poetic studies and his religious work. He died in 1677. == Works == *la Conversion de Jacques de Coras, d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 nosseigneurs du clerg\u00e9 de France; 1665, Paris, in-12. *Jonas, ou Ninive p\u00e9nitente; 1663, Paris, in-12. *Three poems, Josu\u00e9, Samson, and David, were published under the title \u0152vres po\u00e9tiques; 1665, Paris, 1n-12. ==Sources== *This article, in its inaugural (Nov 2005) edition, consists largely of material translated from the article, Coras (Jacques de), in the French-language Nouvelle Biographie G\u00e9n\u00e9ral: 1860, Paris: Fermin Didot Fr\u00e8res. vol.xi, column 764.
