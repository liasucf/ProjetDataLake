    "text": "The 2007 AFF Championship was the 6th edition of the AFF Championship, the football championship of Southeast Asia. It was co-hosted by Singapore and Thailand and took place from 12 January to 4 February 2007. It was renamed from the Tiger Cup, due to the cup's main sponsor, Tiger Beer, not continuing their title sponsorship. This was the last event held at Singapore's National Stadium before its redevelopment. Singapore set an AFF Cup record of a 15-match unbeaten run under coach Radojko Avramovi\u0107, stretching back to the 2004 AFF Championship, and 17-match unbeaten run since the 4\u20130 defeat at home to neighbours Malaysia in the same competition on 18 December 2002. ==Hosts== The 2007 AFF Cup was co-hosted by three-time champions, Thailand, and defending champions and eventual winners Singapore. The two hosts are the only two teams that have won the championship since its inception in 1996. ==Qualification== The qualifying round for the lower ranked teams in Southeast Asia was held in Bacolod, Philippines from 12\u201320 November 2006. It was played in a single round-robin format with the top two teams advancing to the finals. This was the first time since 1998 where a qualification tournament was held. Six teams as qualified directly to the finals. * * * * * * Two teams qualified via the qualification tournament. * (Qualification winners) * (Qualification runner-up) ===Qualified teams=== The following eight teams qualified for the tournament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country ! style=\"width:190px;\"|Qualified as ! style=\"width:110px;\"|Qualified on !

If the total aggregate score of both teams after both matches remained the same, extra time would have been played, followed by a penalty shootout if necessary. ====Semi-finals==== ;First Leg ;Second Leg 2\u20132 on aggregate. Singapore won via a penalty shootout. Thailand won 2\u20130 on aggregate. ====Final==== After a group stage with two pools of four the two host nations met in a two-game final. In the first leg of the final, a controversial penalty was awarded to Singapore at the 83rd minute of the match, and the Thailand team walked off the pitch as a protest to the referee's decision. The Thailand team returned to the pitch at the 98th minute, and Singapore later won 2-1. In the second leg of the final, Singapore had a goal controversially chalked off for being offside, but finally drew 1-1 to fellow co-host Thailand, with Khairul Amri scoring the decisive goal in the closing stages of the match, thus giving Singapore their 2nd title in succession, winning with an aggregate score of 3-2, and successfully defending the title. While Thailand can point to the controversial penalty for their defeat in the first leg, they failed to defeat Singapore in the Bangkok second-leg. It could have been worse for Thailand had the match officials seen Thai midfielder Datsakorn Thonglao head-butt Singapore's Khairul Amri to vent his anger after the equaliser. ;First Leg ;Second Leg Singapore won 3\u20132 on aggregate. ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\" |- !Most Valuable Player !Golden Boot |- | Noh Alam Shah | Noh Alam Shah |} ==Goalscorers== ;11 goals * Noh Alam Shah ;4 goals * Pipat Thonkanya * Phan Thanh B\u00ecnh ;3 goals * Sarayoot Chaikamdee * L\u00ea C\u00f4ng Vinh ;2 goals * Atep * Saktiawan Sinaga * Hairuddin Omar * Khairul Amri * Muhammad Ridhuan * Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Bi\u1ec3n ;1 goal * Ilham Jaya Kesuma * Zaenal Arief * Sounthalay Saysoungkham * Mohammad Hardi Jaafar * Eddy Helmi Abdul Manan * Mohd Nizaruddin Yusof * Si Thu Win * Sharil Ishak * Itimi Dickson * Indra Sahdan Daud * Fahrudin Mustafi\u0107 ;Own goal * Supardi Nasir (playing against Vietnam) * Anton del Rosario (playing against Malaysia) ==Team statistics== This table shows all team performance. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !width=\"25\"| !width=\"165\"|Team !width=\"25\"| !width=\"25\"| !width=\"25\"| !width=\"25\"| !width=\"25\"| !width=\"25\"| !width=\"25\"| |- |colspan=10|Final |-style=\"background:#FFD700;\" |1||align=left| |7||2||5||0||18||6||+12 |-style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |2||align=left| |7||3||3||1||10||4||+6 |- |colspan=10|Semi-finals |- |3||align=left| |5||1||3||1||10||3||+7 |- |4||align=left| |5||1||3||1||6||3||+3 |- |colspan=10|Eliminated in the group stage |- |5||align=left| |3||1||2||0||6||4||+2 |- |6||align=left| |3||0||3||0||1||1||0 |- |7||align=left| |3||0||1||2||0||8||\u20138 |- |8||align=left| |3||0||0||3||1||23||\u201322 |} ==References== * Hamdan Saaid. \"ASEAN Football Federation Championship 2007 - Details\".
