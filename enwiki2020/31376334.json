    "text": "Walter de Thornbury (died 1313) was an English-born statesman and cleric in 14th century Ireland who held the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His efforts to secure confirmation of his election as Archbishop of Dublin were cut short by his death in a shipwreck. ==Biography== Walter de Thornbury was born in Herefordshire, where he was later granted the manor of Wolferlow by the Mortimer family, with whom he was always closely associated. He was an executor of the will of Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer,Ball F.

He accompanied Gaveston on his successful campaign to restore the Crown's authority in Leinster in 1309, in which he defeated the O'Byrne clan of County Wicklow and restored order in the neighbourhood of Glendalough.Otway-Ruthven, A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 p.219 The downfall and execution of his patron Piers Gaveston in June 1312 does not seem to have injured Thornbury's career. In 1313 he was one of two candidates for the Archbishopric of Dublin, the other being Alexander de Bicknor. Thornbury, quicker off the mark than his rival, set out for Avignon to secure Papal confirmation of his election. The ship sank in a storm with the loss of all lives on board : the dead were reported to have numbered more than 150.O'Flanagan, J.
