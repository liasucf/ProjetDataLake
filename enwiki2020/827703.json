    "text": "The Santa Fe Trail was a 19th-century route through central North America that connected Franklin, Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Pioneered in 1821 by William Becknell, who departed from the Boonslick region along the Missouri River, the trail served as a vital commercial highway until 1880, when the railroad arrived in Santa Fe. Santa Fe was near the end of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which carried trade from Mexico City. The route skirted the northern edge and crossed the north-western corner of Comancheria, the territory of the Comanche. Realizing the value, they demanded compensation for granting passage to the trail. American traders envisioned them as another market. Comanche raiding farther south in Mexico isolated New Mexico, making it more dependent on the American trade. They raided to gain a steady supply of horses to sell. By the 1840s, trail traffic through the Arkansas Valley was so numerous that bison herds were cut off from important seasonal grazing land. This habitat disruption, on top of overhunting, contributed to the collapse of the species. Comanche power declined in the region when they lost their most important game. The American army used the trail route in 1846 to invade New Mexico during the Mexican\u2013American War. After the U.S. acquisition of the Southwest that ended the war, the trail was integral to the U.S. opening the region to economic development and settlement. It played a vital role in the westward expansion of the US into these new lands. The road route is commemorated today by the National Park Service as the Santa Fe National Historic Trail. A highway route that roughly follows the trail's path, through the entire length of Kansas, the southeast corner of Colorado and northern New Mexico, has been designated as the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway. ==History== Arrival of the caravan at Santa Fe, lithograph published 1844 I-25 in northern New Mexico The Santa Fe Trail was a transportation route opened by the Spaniards at the end of the 18th century. It was later used extensively by people from the United States in the 19th century after the Louisiana Purchase. Traders and settlers crossed the southwest of North America by the route connecting Independence, Missouri with Santa Fe, New Mexico. Its major market in Missouri was St. Louis, with its port on the Mississippi River. The French explorer Pedro Vial pioneered the route in 1792, and French traders from St. Louis gained a fur trading monopoly from the Spanish in Santa Fe. Other Americans improved and publicized the Santa Fe Trail as of 1822, in order to take advantage of new trade opportunities with Mexico. It had just won independence from Spain in the Mexican War of Independence. Manufactured goods were hauled from the state of Missouri in the United States to Santa Fe, which was in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Mexico. Settlers seeking the opportunity to hold free land used wagon trains to follow various emigrant trails that branched off to points west. The political philosophy of Manifest Destiny, the idea that the US should extend from one coast to another, dominated national political discussions. The trail connected interior port cities along the Mississippi and Missouri and their wagon train outfitters to western destinations. The trail was used to carry products from the central plains to the trail head towns St. Joseph and Independence, Missouri. In the 1820s\u201330s, it was also sporadically important in the reverse trade, used by traders to transport foods and supplies to the fur trappers and mountain men opening the remote Northwest, especially in the interior Northwest: Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and Montana. A mule trail (trapper's trails) led to points north to supply the lucrative overland fur trade in ports on the Pacific Coast. ===North\u2013South trade=== Santa Fe was near the northern terminus of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which led overland between Mexico City to San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico. The limited trade traffic transited the site that would become Fort Bent in Colorado (directly on the Santa Fe Trail) and the short-lived trading fort (name, owner, management, dates all uncertain) that was located at the junction of the Trapper's Trail and Oregon Trail. This post was eight miles east of the site of Fort John (now Ft. Laramie) (ca. 1833) on what became the Oregon Trail (1832\u201334).Founding date is estimated as after the Battle of Pierre's Hole based on the consequent discovery of South Pass (1832). This provided the last key bit of navigable landscape needed by the Astorians. The majority of the road was well known to the American Fur Company since 1808. The lost fort was on the same site where Fort Bernard was later founded (1866) in present-day Wyoming, then part of the larger eastern Oregon Country. Cargo mule trains were run from Fort Bernard to the Santa Fe Trail. The earlier Fort and the identity of its traders are less certain; they may have been independents and not employees of the large fur companies. ===Importance of Santa Fe=== Map of the Republic of Texas showing lands claimed by Texas after 1836 and present-day outline of New Mexico on the boundaries of 1836\u20131845 In 1825, the merchant Manuel Escudero of Chihuahua was commissioned by New Mexico governor Bartolome Baca to negotiate in Washington, DC for opening U.S. borders to traders from Mexico. Beginning in 1826, prominent aristocratic families of New Mexicans, such as the Ch\u00e1vezes, Armijos, Pereas, and Oteros, entered into the commerce along the trail. By 1843, traders from New Mexico and Chihuahua had become the majority of traders involved in the traffic of goods over the Santa Fe Trail.Marc Simmons, Murder on the Santa Fe Trail: an International Incident, 1843, El Paso, Texas: The University of Texas El Paso (1987) In 1835, Mexico City had sent Albino P\u00e9rez to govern the department of New Mexico as Jefe Politico (political chief or governor) and as commanding military officer. In 1837, the forces of Rio Arriba (the upper Rio Grande, i.e., northern New Mexico) rebelled against P\u00e9rez' enforcement of the recent Mexican constitution, new revenue laws taxing Santa Fe commerce and entertainment, and the large grants of New Mexico land to wealthy Mexicans. New Mexicans appreciated the relative freedoms of a frontier, remote from Mexico City. The rebels defeated and executed governor Albino Perez, but were later ousted by the forces of Rio Abajo (the lower Rio Grande, or southern New Mexico) led by Manuel Armijo.Ray John de Aragon, Padre Martinez and Bishop Lamy, Pan American Publishing Company (1978) ===Conflict between Texas and Mexico=== The Republic of Texas competed with Mexico in claiming Santa Fe, as part of the territory north and east of the Rio Grande which both nations claimed following Texas's secession from Mexico in 1836. In 1841, a small military and trading expedition departed from Austin, Texas for Santa Fe. They represented the Republic of Texas and its president Mirabeau B. Lamar. Their intention was to persuade the people of Santa Fe and New Mexico to relinquish control over the territory under dispute with Mexico, and over associated Santa Fe Trail commerce. Knowing about recent political disturbances there, they hoped for a welcome by the rebellious faction in New Mexico. What was known as the Texan Santa Fe Expedition encountered many difficulties. The party was captured by governor Armijo's Mexican army under less than honest negotiations. They were subjected to harsh and austere treatment during a tortuous forced march to Mexico City, where they were tried, convicted and imprisoned for their insurgent activities. In 1842, Colonel William A. Christy wrote Sam Houston, president of Texas, requesting support for an overthrow scheme by Charles Warfield dependent on armed forces. He proposed deposing the governments in the Mexican provinces of New Mexico and Chihuahua and returning half of the spoils to the Republic of Texas. Houston agreed, provided the operation be conducted under the strictest secrecy. He commissioned Warfield as a colonel, who attempted to raise volunteers in Texas, St. Louis, Missouri; and the southern Rockies for a Warfield Expedition. He recruited John McDaniel and a small band of men in the proximate vicinity of St. Louis, giving McDaniel the rank of a Texas captain. After Warfield headed toward the Rockies with a companion, McDaniel led a robbery in April 1843 (in present-day Rice County, Kansas) of a lightly manned Santa Fe Trail trading caravan. This resulted in the murder of its leader Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez, the son of a former governor of New Mexico, Francisco Xavier Ch\u00e1vez. Warfield was reportedly unaware of the crime. McDaniel and one accomplice were tried, convicted and executed. Other participating suspects arrested by the US were convicted and imprisoned. The newspapers reported that Americans and Mexicans were outraged by the crime. Local merchants and citizens at the U.S. end of the Santa Fe Trail demanded justice and a return to the stable commerce which their economy depended on. After the murder of Ch\u00e1vez, Warfield began limited military hostilities in the region using recruits from the southern Rockies. He made an unprovoked attack on Mexican troops outside Mora, New Mexico, leaving five dead. Warfield lost his horses after an encounter in Wagon Mound, where the Mexican forces had made chase. After Warfield's men reached Bent's Fort on foot, they disbanded. In February 1843, Colonel Jacob Snively had received a commission to intercept Mexican caravans along the Santa Fe Trail, similar to that received by Warfield the year prior. After disbanding the volunteers under his command, Warfield located and joined the 190-man, Texas \"Battalion of Invincibles,\" under the command of Snively. New Mexico governor Manuel Armijo led Mexican troops out of Santa Fe to protect incoming caravans. But, after the Invincibles destroyed much of an advance party led by Captain Ventura Lovato, the governor retreated. Following this battle, many Americas resigned and Snively's force was reduced to little over 100 men. Snively planned to plunder Mexican merchant caravans on territory claimed by Texas, in retaliation for recent Texian executions and Mexican invasions, but his battalion was quickly arrested and disarmed by the US troops escorting the caravans. After disarming these men, Captain Philip St. George Cooke allowed them to return to Texas. ==Mother of the railroad== Connections along the Santa Fe Railroad, showing the principal regular stops on the AT&SF; mainline, including cattle drive destinations such as Dodge City. It is no accident that most of those Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexican towns were also first serviced by the Santa Fe Trail. In 1863, with all the political bickering over railroad legislation, entrepreneurs opened their pockets and set their sights on the American Southwest leading to the gradual construction east to west of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway; the name eponymously reflecting the intentions of the founders, the expected eastern terminus to be in Atchison, Kansas. Inside Kansas, the AT&SF; roadbed roughly paralleled the Santa Fe Trail west of Topeka as it expanded between 1868 and 1874. When a railroad bridge was built across the Missouri River to connect eastern markets to the Dodge City cattle trail and Colorado coal mines, the railroad spurred the growth of Kansas City, Missouri. Building the railway so that it extended westwards to destinations in and beyond the New Mexico border was delayed and kept the fledgling railroad gasping for cash. In a move to bootstrap their own base market, the railway began offering packaged \"Shopping Excursion deals\" to potential buyers desiring to look over a real estate parcel. The railroad began to discount such trips to visit its land offices and gave back the ticket price as part of the purchase price, if a sale was concluded. The railroad's sale of its land granted by congress fostered growth of new towns and businesses along its route, which generated railway traffic and revenues. With this financial base, the railway extended west, gradually adding new connections through rougher west country along the western Trail. With the development of rail transport, traffic on the Trail soon dropped to merely local trade. In a sense, after World War I the trail was reborn; by the 1920s it gradually became paved automobile roads. ==Route== Santa Fe Trail highway sign in Cimarron, New Mexico End of the Santa Fe Trail marker on the Plaza in Santa Fe, New Mexico The eastern end of the trail was in the central Missouri town of Franklin on the north bank of the Missouri River. The route across Missouri first used by Becknell followed portions of the existing Osage Trace and the Medicine Trails. West of Franklin, the trail crossed the Missouri near Arrow Rock, after which it followed roughly the route of present-day U.S. Route 24. It passed north of Marshall, through Lexington to Fort Osage, then to Independence. Independence was also one of the historic \"jumping off points\" for the Oregon and California Trails. West of Independence, it roughly followed the route of U.S. Route 56 from near the town of Olathe to the western border of Kansas. It enters Colorado, cutting across the southeast corner of the state before entering New Mexico. The section of the trail between Independence and Olathe was also used by immigrants on the California and Oregon Trails, which branched off to the northwest near Gardner, Kansas. From Olathe, the trail passed through the towns of Baldwin City, Burlingame, and Council Grove, then swung west of McPherson to the town of Lyons. West of Lyons the trail followed nearly the route of present-day Highway 56 to Great Bend. Ruts in the earth made from the trail are still visible in several locations (Ralph's Ruts are visible in aerial photos at (). At Great Bend, the trail encountered the Arkansas River. Branches of the trail followed both sides of the river upstream to Dodge City and Garden City. West of Garden City in southwestern Kansas the trail splits into two branches. One of the branches, called the Mountain Route or the Upper Crossing follows the Purgatoire River from La Junta upstream to Trinidad then south through the Raton Pass into New Mexico. The other main branch, called the Cimarron Cutoff or Cimarron Crossing or Middle Crossing cut southwest across the Cimarron Desert (also known as the Waterscrape or La Jornada) to the valley of the Cimarron River near the town of Ulysses and Elkhart then continued toward Boise City, Oklahoma, to Clayton, New Mexico, joining up with northern branch at Fort Union. This route was generally very hazardous because it had very little water.Samuel Gance, Anton ou la trajectoire d'un p\u00e8re, L'Harmattan, Paris, 2013. p.115. In fact, the Cimarron River was one of the only sources of water along this branch of the trail. From Watrous, the reunited branches continued southward to Santa Fe. Part of this route has been designated a National Scenic Byway. ==Challenges== Santa Fe Trail Ruts at Fort Union Travelers faced many hardships along the Santa Fe Trail. The trail was a challenging of dangerous plains, hot deserts, and steep and rocky mountains. The natural weather was and is continental: very hot and dry summers, coupled with long and bitterly cold winters. Freshwater was scarce, and the high steppe-like plains are nearly treeless. Water flows in the Pecos, Arkansas, Cimarron, and Canadian rivers that drain the region vary by 90 or more percent in their flows during an average year. Also on this trail, unlike the Oregon trail, there was a serious danger of Indian attacks, for neither the Comanches nor the Apaches of the southern high plains tolerated trespassers. In 1825, Congress voted for federal protection for the Santa Fe Trail, even though much of it lay in the Mexican territory. Lack of food and water also made the trail very risky. Weather conditions, like huge lightning storms, gave the travelers even more difficulty. If a storm developed, there was often no place to take shelter and the livestock could get spooked. Rattlesnakes often posed a threat, and many people died due to snakebites. The caravan size increased later on to prevent Indian raids. The travelers also packed more oxen instead of mules because the Indians did not want to risk raiding the caravans only for some oxen. ==Historic preservation== Segments of this trail in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In Missouri, this includes the 85th and Manchester \"Three Trails\" Trail Segment, Arrow Rock Ferry Landing, Santa Fe Trail-Grand Pass Trail Segments, and Santa Fe Trail-Saline County Trail Segments. The longest clearly identifiable section of the trail, Santa Fe Trail Remains, near Dodge City, Kansas, is listed as a National Historic Landmark. In Colorado, Santa Fe Trail Mountain Route--Bent's New Fort is included on the National Register. == Notable features == Santa Fe Trail marker in Coolidge, Kansas Santa Fe Trail Ruts west of Larned, Kansas Santa Fe Trail marker at the Cuerno Verde Rest Area, Colorado ;MissouriSanta Fe trail, Official Map and Guide; National Park Service; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; 1997 * Arrow Rock (Arrow Rock Landing, Santa Fe Spring, Huston Tavern) * Harvey Spring/Weinrich Ruts * Independence (Santa Fe trail Ruts, Lower Independence (Blue Mills) Landing, Upper Independence (Wayne City) Landing. * Kansas City (Westport Landing) ;Kansas * Kansas City (Shawnee Mission, Big Blue River Crossing) * Council Grove (Kaw Mission, Neosho River Crossing, Hermit's Cave, Last Chance Store, Council Oak, Post Office Oak) * Fort Larned National Historic Site * Fort Dodge (Jackson's Grove and Island, Santa Fe Trail Ruts, Middle Crossing, Point of Rocks, Fort Atkinson Site) Mountain Route towards Colorado * Arkansas River Crossing ;Colorado Mountain Route * Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site * Raton Pass Cimarron Route thru Kansas towards Oklahoma * Cimarron River * Cimarron National Grassland ;New Mexico Mountain Route * Clifton House * Cimarron (Aztec Mill, Cimarron Plaza and Well) * Philmont Scout Ranch Cimarron Route * Kiowa National Grassland Joint route * Fort Union National Monument * Pecos National Historical Park * Santa Fe * De Vargas Street House, \"Oldest House in the USA\" * Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area ==See also== *MO: Jackson County Historic Places *KS: Johnson County Historic Places *OK: Cimarron County Historic Places *NM: Colfax County Historic Places *Oregon- California Trails Association *Pawnee Rock *Related National Park Units **Fort Larned National Historic Site **Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site **Fort Union National Monument *Santa Fe Trail Remains *Santa Fe Trail Museum, part of the Trinidad History Museum *Santa Fe Trail Historical Park in El Monte, California *Trailside Center museum in Kansas City, Missouri *Great Santa Fe Trail Horse Race Endurance Ride * Scenic byways in the United States *Tree in the Trail ==References== ==Further reading== * ; 224 pages. * ; 208 pages. * ; 252 pages. * ; 272 pages. * ; 283 pages. * ; 168 pages. * ; 162 pages. * ; 190 pages. * ; 318 pages. * ; 320 pages. ; Maps * ; 196 pages. * ; 121 pages. * ; 21 pages. ==External links== *Santa Fe National Historic Trail (National Park Service) *Santa Fe Trail Center * Santa Fe Trail Research * Santa Fe Trail Research Site Aerial Photo Tour of the Santa Fe Trail * Access documents, photographs, and other primary sources on Kansas Memory, the Kansas State Historical Society's digital portal * New Mexico Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway *Glorieta and Raton Passes: Gateways to the Southwest, a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan *Pioneer Trails from US Land Surveys * Oklahoma Digital Maps: Digital Collections of Oklahoma and Indian Territory Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Missouri Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Oklahoma Category:National Scenic Byways in Colorado Category:Historic trails and roads in New Mexico Category:Historic trails and roads in Colorado Category:Historic trails and roads in Kansas Category:Historic trails and roads in Missouri Category:Historic trails and roads in Oklahoma Category:Native American trails in the United States Category:Trails and roads in the American Old West Category:Colorado Territory Category:Jefferson Territory Category:New Mexico Territory Category:New Mexico Scenic and Historic Byways Category:Colorado Scenic Byways Category:1822 establishments in the United States ",
