The main purpose of the Act is to diagnose, prevent, and control diseases in animals, but welfare is also addressed. Owners or keepers of domestic animals must provide adequate food and water, veterinarian supervision and immediate attention in case of injury. The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food is responsible for protecting the health and welfare of animals in \"primary production\", determining rules on animal welfare, transport and slaughter. State-level anti-cruelty provisions also apply to farm animals. In 2014, Mexico received a D out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.
