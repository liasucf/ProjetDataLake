It was created on 26 April 1859 for George Stucley, Conservative Member of Parliament for Barnstaple from 1855 to 1857. Born George Stucley Buck, he had assumed by Royal licence the surname of Stucley in lieu of his patronymic, on the death of his father, in 1858 as lineal representative of the ancient Stucley family. This family, which possessed Affeton Castle in Devon for over 600 years, originally came from the village of Stukeley in Huntingdonshire, and were sheriffs of that county during the reign of King John. The family are descended from Richard Stucley, of Trent, Somerset, and Elizabeth Fitzroger his wife. Their son, Hugh Stucley married Katherine Affeton, heiress of the Affeton estates, and was sheriff of Devon in 1448. The fifth Baronet served as a Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Devon. ==Stucley baronets, of Affeton Castle (1859)== *Sir George Stucley Stucley, 1st Baronet (1812\u20131900) *Lt.-Col.
