    "text": "Jillian M. Buriak FRSC is a Canadian chemist, currently a Canada Research Chair in Nanomaterials at University of Alberta and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Royal Society of Chemistry. She is known for her work developing flexible, lightweight solar cells made from nanoparticles. By spraying a plastic surface with nanomaterials, she's able to fabricate a transparent layer of electrode that acts as solar cells. Due to the flexibility, they could be incorporated onto different surfaces. She has an A.B. degree from Harvard University (1990) and a Ph.D. from Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur (1995), Strasbourg, working on organometallic chemistry and catalysis. She held a postdoctoral appointment at the Scripps Research Institute at La Jolla, California, working on self- assembly of nanostructures on surfaces. Buriak started her independent faculty career at Purdue University in 1997, was promoted to associate professor, with tenure, in 2001. In 2003, she joined the University of Alberta as a full professor. From 2003 to 2008, Buriak was on the Board of Reviewing Editors (BoRE) at Science (handling 7-10 papers per week). She was an associate editor at ACS Nano from 2009 to 2013 (handling >500 papers per year). In 2014, she was appointed as the editor-in-chief of Chemistry of Materials handling ~5000 papers per year. == Selected honors == *2009: Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada{cite web|url=https://rsc-src.ca/en/search- fellows?last_name=buriak&sort;_by=last_name&sort;_order=ASC|title=RSC Fellows Directory|access-date=2020-02-29}} *2009: Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science *2005: Rutherford Memorial Medal (Chemistry) of the Royal Society of Canada *Canada Research Chair of Nanomaterials *Canada's Top 40 Under 40 *ACS Pure Chemistry Award *Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award *Fresenius Award *Cottrell Teacher-Scholar == Research interests == * Materials for Energy * Nanomaterials Synthesis * Silicon Surface Chemistry * Block Copolymer Self Assembly ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of Alberta faculty Category:Canadian chemists Category:Women chemists Category:Nanotechnologists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:University of Strasbourg alumni Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Chemistry Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Academic journal editors Category:Purdue University faculty ",
