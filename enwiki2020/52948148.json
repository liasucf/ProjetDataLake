In 1232 al-Kamil of Egypt ordered Abu Sa'd, then Emir of Yanbu, to assist in recapturing Mecca from Rajih ibn Qatadah, who was supported by al-Mansur of Yemen. In 1242 when al-Mansur captured Mecca he won over the allegiance of Abu Sa'd. The Sultan bought the fortress of Yanbu from Abu Sa'd and ordered for it to be destroyed, so as to not be utilized by the Egyptians, and assigned him to Wadi Marr to support the Yemeni army at Mecca. In 1250 Abu Sa'd received support from leaders of the Zubayd tribe to wrest Mecca from the oppressive rule of Ibn al- Musayyib, the Yemeni emir. Abu Sa'd's Bedouin troops entered Mecca from two directions, and he took control of the city. According to al-Muyurqi, Ibn al- Musayyib was captured on Friday, 7 Dhu al-Qi'dah 647 AH (11 February 1250), while according to Ibn al-Mahfuz it was at the end of Shawwal (late January / early February). Abu Sa'd gathered the notables of Mecca in the Grand Mosque, where he expressed to them his continued loyalty to the Sultan, and explained that Ibn al-Musayyib had been planning to take the wealth he had stolen and flee to Iraq. Abu Sa'd's rule was strengthened after al-Mansur's death, news of which arrived a few days later. Abu Sa'd was deposed and killed by his cousin Jammaz ibn Hasan in 651 AH. According to various reports it was either on 5 Shawwal (), in the beginning of Ramadan (late October 1253), or on 3 Sha'ban (). ==References== * Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1253 deaths Category:13th-century Arabs Category:Sharifs of Mecca Category:Banu Qatadah Category:Arab people of Ethiopian descent Category:Middle Eastern people of Ethiopian descent ",
