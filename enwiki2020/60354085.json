    "text": "' (also written 2014 MV67) is a lost asteroid with an observation arc less than 1 day. It has an assumed orbital eccentricity and a very poorly constrained orbit. Depending on the orbit, it could be a potentially hazardous asteroid roughly in diameter. It was discovered on 24 June 2014, when the asteroid was estimated to be from Earth and had a solar elongation of 161 degrees. The 22 March 2018 and 3 April 2019 virtual impactors did not occur. The uncertainty region of wraps around the entire orbit so the asteroid could be anywhere on any of the numerous orbit fits. (beyond the orbit of Jupiter). The asteroid was not expected to be near Earth anytime during 2019. With an almost meaningless 1-day observation arc, the Sentry Risk Table shows an estimated 1 in 3 billion chance of the asteroid impacting Earth on 22 March 2022. The nominal JPL Horizons 22 March 2022 Earth distance is with a 3-sigma uncertainty of .
