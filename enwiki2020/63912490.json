In 1978, Peres was indirectly elected Vice Governor of Par\u00e1, took office in 1979 and finished his tenure in 1983.

He remained at the Brazilian lower house from 2007 to 2011 and that was his last political position. ==Death== On April 21, 2020, Peres died in Bel\u00e9m from COVID-19. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Vice Governors of Par\u00e1 Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from Par\u00e1 Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of Par\u00e1 Category:Brazilian lawyers Category:Brazilian journalists Category:Brazilian Labour Party (current) politicians Category:National Renewal Alliance politicians Category:Democratic Social Party politicians Category:Progressistas politicians Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Par\u00e1 ",
