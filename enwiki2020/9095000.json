    "text": "The SH-3A is a monophonic analog synthesizer that was manufactured by Roland from 1975 to 1981. It is unique in that it is capable of both subtractive synthesis and additive synthesis. Two LFOs and a unique sample-and-hold section provided capabilities not found in competing self-contained synthesizers of the time. The SH-3A was Roland's first non-preset based synth. It was unique for its time in that it offered mixable waveforms at different footages. The predecessor, the Roland SH-1000 could also do this but didn't offer as much control as on the SH-3A. The rhythmic pulsing in the Blondie song \"Heart of Glass\" is an example of its sound. Contrary to common belief, the initial version \"SH-3\" did not infringe on the transistor ladder-filter patent of Robert Moog. It used a diode filter like the EMS VCS 3. The SH-3A does use a transistor ladder-filter and as a result can generate Moog-like sounds. ==Notable SH-3A users== * Blondie * Chris Carter * Covenant * The Human League * Radio Massacre International * Vangelis Image:roland_sh3a_controls.jpg|Close-up of SH-3A controls ==References== ==External links== * Roland SH-3A review by Bruce Gibbs on International Musician and Recording World (December 1975) * Different Roland synthesizer filters * Demo of SH-3A on YouTube SH-3A Category:Analog synthesizers Category:Monophonic synthesizers Category:Musical instruments invented in the 1970s ",
