    "text": "The S5.92 is a Russian rocket engine, currently used on the Fregat upper stage. ==Design== S5.92 burns a hypergolic mixture of UDMH and nitrogen tetroxide in the gas-generator cycle. It has two throttle settings. The highest produces of thrust, a specific impulse of 327 seconds, and a 3-second ignition transient. The lower throttle level produces of thrust, specific impulse of 316 seconds, and a 2.5 second ignition transient. It is rated for 50 ignitions, and 300 days between ignitions. ==History== It was originally designed by the famous A.M. Isayev Chemical Engineering Design Bureau, for the two spacecraft of the Phobos program. While the Mars missions were unsuccessful, the spacecraft manufacturer, NPO Lavochkin, found a market niche for the technology. Thus, the engine was adapted for use on the optional Fregat upper stage of the Soyuz and Zenit launch vehicles. ==See also== *Fregat - The upper stage that is powered by the S5.92. *Soyuz - A medium lift rocket that uses the Fregat stage. *Zenit-3F - A heavy lift rocket that uses the Fregat stage. ==References== ==External links== * KB KhIMMASH Official Page (in Russian) * NPO Lavochkin Fregat Page (in Russian) Category:Rocket engines of Russia Category:Rocket engines of the Soviet Union Category:Rocket engines using hypergolic propellant Category:Rocket engines using the gas- generator cycle Category:KB KhimMash rocket engines ",
