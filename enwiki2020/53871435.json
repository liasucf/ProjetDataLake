She was the first Norwegian civilian ship to be sunk by German forces during the German invasion of Norway on April 9, 1940.MS S\u00f8rland warsailors.comMinnehallen.no Norges f\u00f8rste krigsofre fra Bud Skipper Asbj\u00f8rn Martinsen and his crew were on their way from Moss with paper from Borregaard in Fredrikstad as well as wood wool and other break bulk cargo. Due to the darkening of the sea lane and the air defense siren in Moss, the cutter was delayed. Suddenly the vessel found itself in the middle of the Battle of Dr\u00f8bak Sound. Flashes and explosions were observed. The crew thought it was a military exercise. The cutter continued inwards along the east bank of the Oslofjord. About 4.30am the darkened cruisers Emden and L\u00fctzow came in the opposite course, in retreat outwards the Oslofjord. The crew realized that the warships were not Norwegian, but decided to continue. They thought that a small merchant vessel like S\u00f8rland would not be attacked. The German warships opened fire at S\u00f8rland at about 4.30am and the cutter changed course outwards the fjord, ahead of the cruisers. The German ships continued their attack with machine gun and cannon fire. A German artillery shell hit the cutter and caused a major fire. After the cutter was set on fire, the crew attempted to beach her. MS S\u00f8rland took in water and sank. Two of the crew of six were killed.(Boatswain Hans Oluf Frisnes age 31 and Ships Cook Ole Tornes age 22) == See also == * Action in the Oslofjord * Battle of Dr\u00f8bak Sound == References == Category:1920 ships Category:Ships built in Arendal Category:Merchant ships of Denmark Category:World War II merchant ships of Norway Category:World War II shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:Maritime incidents in April 1940 Category:Norwegian campaign ",
