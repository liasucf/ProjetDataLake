The park has wheelchair-accessible restrooms, picnic grounds and swimming beach in addition to a ramp for motorized and non-motorized boating and fishing. It is staffed seasonally. ==In the news== The film Sea of Trees starring Matthew McConaughey was partially filmed in Ashland State Park in August 2014. On August 24, 2016, an ultralight helicopter crashed into the Ashland Reservoir after experiencing engine trouble. No one was injured when the craft submerged in water up to 30 feet deep some 200 to 300 yards offshore. ==References== ==External links== *Ashland State Park Department of Conservation and Recreation *Ashland State Park Map Department of Conservation and Recreation Category:State parks of Massachusetts Category:Ashland, Massachusetts Category:Massachusetts natural resources Category:Parks in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:1947 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Protected areas established in 1947 ",
