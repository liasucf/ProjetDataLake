    "text": "F.O.D. is a Belgian punk rock band known for its catchy melodies. A reviewer on Disagreement.net, an established music e-zine from Luxembourg, writes that while F.O.D. doesn't reinvent punk rock, the band 'distinguishes itself from the competition because of the incredible vocal harmonies'. Dutch independent record label Suburban Records refers to the band as a 'household name in the Belgian punk rock scene', with a 'great live reputation'. == F.O.D. influences == The sound of F.O.D. is heavily influenced by the Fat Wreck Chords and Epitaph Records punk rock from the mid nineties (as portrayed in the documentary One Nine Nine Four), a musical genre sometimes referred to as skate punk. The Spanish alternative magazine Big Bombo describes F.O.D. as a band whose sound 'reminds the listener of early Green Day' and 'which is also clearly influenced by melodic punk rock bands like Lagwagon, Bad Religion and The Offspring'. == F.O.D. publicity== F.O.D. was featured on the cover of RMP Magazine (Groezrock 2013 Edition, 2.000 copies printed, retail price \u20ac2,00).

F.O.D. has a bio on (and has been frequently mentioned on) the popular punk website Dying Scene. Punk website Bearded Punk did a 15-minute video feature about the band. Their albums have been reviewed by many magazines, webzines and online newspapers in various countries and multiple languages (Dutch, French, Spanish, and English). F.O.D. was featured in Episode 2 of a recent web TV series, called LARGE LIVE, by the popular mailorder and merchandising store Large Popmerchandising (the Dutch version of Hot Topic). == F.O.D. shows== F.O.D. has toured various countries in Europe.

The band also announces to tour Japan in April! == History of F.O.D. == === Origins of F.O.D.=== F.O.D. started in 2008 as a Green Day cover band. The Belgian music website Musiczine describes how the Antwerpen based formation started out 'with the goal of playing the album Dookie in its entirety'. Their name is a reference to a song on the 1994 album Dookie, called F.O.D. (short for 'Fuck Off and Die...'). === Dance To This (2011), Ontario (2013) === After 3 years of playing Green Day songs to various crowds in Belgium and Europe, F.O.D. started writing their own material. This resulted in the 2011 EP release 'Dance To This', followed by a 2013 album release 'Ontario'. Both were released by record label Thanks But No Thanks Records. Belgian newspaper Gazet van Antwerpen reports that 1.000 copies of 'Ontario' were pressed. 'Ontario' was also available on 12\" vinyl. This version included two bonus tracks: 'Water Falls' and 'Everything'. === Tricks Of The Trade (2014) === On 23 September 2014, F.O.D. released their second album, called Tricks Of The Trade. It was released worldwide, on four different record labels: Thanks But No Thanks Records / Funtime Records (Belgium), Effervescence Records (Europe), Bird Attack Records (North America) and Bells On Records (Japan). To celebrate the release of the new album, F.O.D. fest was held on 11 October 2014, featuring numerous national and international punk-rock bands. === Harvest (2017) === On 7 February 2017, F.O.D. released their third album Harvest. As before it was released worldwide, on same 4 record labels: Funtime Records (Belgium), Effervescence Records (Europe), Bird Attack Records (North America) and Bells On Records (Japan). 'Harvest', a darker album, written in the slipstream of a divorce. The melodies are still there, more soaring than ever, but the overall mood is a bit less happy, the music a bit more aggressive. Again the band releases the album at their own festival. === Punkrock 4 Life (2017) === On November 8th 2017, F.O.D. released a new single for charity: \u201cHope For A Moment\u201d by F.O.D. & Friends. The song was released in the context of \u201cMusic For Life\u201c, a yearly action for charity by Belgian national radio station Studio Brussel and in favor of \u2018Wereld-Delen\u2018, which tries to improve the well-being of disadvantaged people. They recorded this one with people from Belgian Punk rock and metal scene like Dieter (Flatcat), Roos Van Acker, Tim Van Doorn, Hanne (For I Am), Jeroen (Fleddy Melculy) and Steven (Off The Cross).
