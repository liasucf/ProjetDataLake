    "text": "Common Chinese-language deviations by foreign-influenced speakers or learners of Chinese (sometimes called Westernised Chinese ()), usually refers to a pattern of written or spoken Chinese, characterised by significant influence from Western languages, with particular regards to grammar, vocabulary and syntax. Influences from English are particularly noticeable, especially in translations of literary works and documents. Westernised Chinese may lack certain characteristics of more traditional writing styles, and thus may at times pose reading or comprehension issues for readers unfamiliar with this style. It is probable that most Westernized-Chinese translations are direct glosses from English into Chinese by native Chinese-speakers, given the virtually non-existent demand for native English-speakers to perform written translation into Chinese. In the first half of the 20th century, Lu Xun advocated that translations of Western works into Chinese closely follow Westernised structures. Lu Xun's arguments failed to be persuasive across the board and many translators subsequently followed more naturalizing translation styles from English to Chinese. In Taiwan, Westernised Chinese includes many direct influences from the Japanese language, a popular feature being sentence lengthening. In Japanese and many other languages, longer sentences relate to greater politeness and this has had a direct effect on speech patterns in Taiwan. The Taiwanese restaurant industry has especially been heavily influenced by its Japanese counterparts, and a more demanding 'service attitude' has deepened the public connection between long sentences and politeness.\u300c\u8a9e\u8a00\u764c\u300d\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8aa4\u8a3a\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c Westernised Chinese expanded the boundary and limit of the traditional vernacular Chinese and exceedingly enhanced its accuracy for better articulation, adapting the Chinese language for better academic usage. ==Examples== * Abstract nouns as subject. e.g.: ** \"The decline in his income has led to changes in his lifestyle.\" ** \"\u4ed6\u7684\u6536\u5165\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\" (\u4ed6\u7684\u6536\u5165\u7684\u6e1b\u5c11\u6539\u8b8a\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002) ** ( _he NOM income NOM decline_ change PERF he NOM life style.) ** Better translation: \"\u4ed6\u56e0\u6536\u5165\u51cf\u5c11\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\" (\u4ed6\u56e0\u6536\u5165\u6e1b\u5c11\u800c\u6539\u8b8a\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002) (lit. he because [of] income declines, CONJ change life style.) * Overuse of abstract verbs. e.g.: ** \"Audience responded very enthusiastically to the visiting professor.\" ** \"\u542c\u4f17\u5bf9\u8bbf\u95ee\u6559\u6388\u4f5c\u51fa\u4e86\u5341\u5206\u70ed\u70c8\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\" (\u807d\u773e\u5c0d\u8a2a\u554f\u6559\u6388\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u5341\u5206\u71b1\u70c8\u7684\u53cd\u61c9) ** (audience to visiting professor _make_ PERF very enthusiastic response.) ** Better translation: \"\u542c\u4f17\u5bf9\u8bbf\u95ee\u6559\u6388\u53cd\u5e94\u5341\u5206\u70ed\u70c8\u3002\" (\u807d\u773e\u5c0d\u8a2a\u554f\u6559\u6388\u53cd\u61c9\u5341\u5206\u71b1\u70c8) (lit. audience to visiting professor respond very enthusiastically.) * Overuse of \"a/an\" (\u4e00). e.g.: ** \"He is a good man.\" ** \"\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u4eba\u3002\" (\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u597d\u4eba) ** (he is one-CL good person.) ** Better translation: \"\u4ed6\u662f\u597d\u4eba\u3002\" (lit. he is good person.) * Overuse of the subordinating particle \"\u7684\" (NOM).
