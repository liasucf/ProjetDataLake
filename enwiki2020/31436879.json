For most of its existence, it was owned by a company of the same name (with spelling variations over time in the company). Locally, it was nicknamed V\u00e6rven. ==History== It had its predecessor in a modest reparation yard by N. W. Gr\u00f8nn in 1860. In 1870 it was taken over by the twins Johan and J\u00f8rgen Hermann Vogt, and in 1871 their yard had built its first vessel; a schooner. It was bought by the limited company Moss V\u00e6rft in 1889. The company was dissolved in 1927 because of an economic depression, but re-founded the same year as Moss V\u00e6rft & Dokk. The first chairman of that company was Ferdinand Anker. Anker was later sentenced for economic cooperation, i.e. treason, with Germany during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. Moss V\u00e6rft & Dokk became implicated in these affairs, and in the 1950s, the former board as well as director Th. Ring Amundsen were sued by \u00d8ivind Lorentzen's company Sobral. Sobral claimed that Moss V\u00e6rft & Dokk had prioritized work for the Wehrmacht rather than fulfilling a contract with Sobral. In 1961 Moss V\u00e6rft & Dokk was acquired by major corporation Kv\u00e6rner Brug. After Kv\u00e6rner bought Rosenberg Verft as well, in 1970, the companies were amalgamated into Moss-Rosenberg Verft. The shipyard in Moss was the city's largest place of work in the 1970s, but it was discontinued in 1987. The last vessel produced by the yard was a railway ferry for Statens J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar in 1986.NOU 2011: 3 (Norwegian Official Report) ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1870 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1987 Category:Shipyards of Norway Category:Companies based in \u00d8stfold Category:Moss, Norway Category:1884 establishments in Norway ",
