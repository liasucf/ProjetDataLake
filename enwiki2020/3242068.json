Hunter wrote and produced the score of the 2008 film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed with Robbie Bronnimann.

An artwork contest was held to choose a cover for the new EP.

However, the new EP, Glow was released on 23 July 2012. Hunter announced that he is going to release a remix album soon. The tracks on the remix album are from his albums Glow and Collide. Hunter announced also that Robbie Bronniman will remix of his track \"Spiral\", featuring Beth Bullock. A few others are from Alejandro Cesar, Wicho Lopez and Mark Webb. The result was a collection of remixes that were released as two EPs in 2013: Glowing Collision Vol. 1 and 2. In the meantime, Hunter worked on a new project, Presence. This resulted in an app and an album in 2016. The app is a tool designed to inspire people to spend more intentional time with God. It contains the music, video and poetry.
