Bob and Mike Bryan defeated Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonji\u0107 in the final, 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20132, to win the Gentlemen's Doubles title at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships By winning the 2006 Doubles title, their first title at Wimbledon, the Bryan brothers completed the Career Grand Slam, having previously won the 2003 French Open, the 2005 US Open, and the Australian Open earlier that year. Additionally, it was their record 7th consecutive grand slam final. The quarterfinal match between Mark Knowles & Daniel Nestor and Simon Aspelin & Todd Perry became, at that time, the longest match ever played at Wimbledon, lasting 6 hours and 9 minutes, with Knowles & Nestor winning the match 5\u20137, 6\u20133, 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20133, 23\u201321. This record was eventually broken at the 2010 Championships, in the first round men's singles match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut. It still remains as of 2018 the longest doubles match played at Wimbledon or at any Grand Slam tournament. ==Seeds== Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan (Champions) Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman / Max Mirnyi (Quarterfinals) Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor (Semifinals) Paul Hanley / Kevin Ullyett (Quarterfinals) Jonathan Erlich / Andy Ram (Third round) Fabrice Santoro / Nenad Zimonji\u0107 (Final) Martin Damm / Leander Paes (Semifinals) Simon Aspelin / Todd Perry (Quarterfinals) Stephen Huss / Wesley Moodie (Third round) Mariusz Fyrstenberg / Marcin Matkowski (First round) Luk\u00e1\u0161 Dlouh\u00fd / Pavel V\u00edzner (Quarterfinals) Franti\u0161ek \u010cerm\u00e1k / Leo\u0161 Friedl (First round) Mahesh Bhupathi / Alexander Waske (First round) Wayne Black / Jeff Coetzee (First round) Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda / Sebasti\u00e1n Prieto (Third round) Chris Haggard / Dominik Hrbat\u00fd (First round) ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ==References== ==External links== * * *2006 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Doubles Category:Wimbledon Championship by year \u2013 Men's Doubles ",
