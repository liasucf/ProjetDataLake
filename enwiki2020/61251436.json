Zekeriya Sertel's critical attitude towards the Turkish state within the framework of the republican movement led to his arrest in May 1925, which resulted in the takeover of the financial and editorial management as well as the production of the magazine by his wife Sabiha Sertel. In 1926 the journal was censored by state and was published under its new title Sevimli Ay for the following two years. Like its predecessor, Sevimli Ay was published monthly and consisted of a total of twelve issues, each with about fifty large-format pages.Sevimli Ay (1926) After Zekeriya Sertel's early release from prison, the journal continued to be published again under her original name Resimli Ay between 1927 and 1938 - from October 1928 also in the new Turkish Latin alphabet - with a few interruptions.Resimli Ay (1928) The publication, popular among the Turkish population, addressed socially relevant topics in the form of editorials, opinion surveys, letters to the editor, short stories and poems as well as self-help articles. In addition to dealing with contrasting aspects such as child poverty and factory work versus nightclubs and dance trends, the role of the modern Turkish woman in particular played a major role. Glamorous illustrations in the style of Vanity Fair or Vogue were intended to draw a cosmopolitan public image of women and reflected the urban elite of Istanbul. ==References== Category:1926 establishments in Turkey Category:1927 disestablishments in Turkey Category:Defunct literary magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in Turkey Category:Literary magazines published in Turkey Category:Magazines established in 1926 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1927 Category:Magazines published in Istanbul Category:Monthly magazines published in Turkey Category:Turkish-language magazines ",
