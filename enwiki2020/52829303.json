This was the 7th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 59th year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team. Entering the season, in an effort to more accurately reflect the geographic location of the member school, the MCHL changed the conference name to 'Western Intercollegiate Hockey League'. ==Regular season== ===Season tournaments=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
