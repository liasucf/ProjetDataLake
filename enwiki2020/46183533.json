    "text": "Heinrich von Ranke (1830\u20131909) Heinrich von Ranke (8 May 1830, R\u00fcckersdorf - 13 May 1909, Munich) was a German physiologist and pediatrician. He was the son of theologian Friedrich Heinrich Ranke (1798-1876) and the brother of anthropologist Johannes Ranke (1836-1916). Famed historian Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) was his uncle. == Biography == Ranke studied at the Universities of Berlin, Leipzig, Erlangen, and T\u00fcbingen. At Erlangen, he was a student of the chemist Eugen von Gorup-Bes\u00e1nez, and at Berlin, he was an assistant to physiologist Johannes Peter M\u00fcller (1849\u201350). In 1851 he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation involving physiological-chemical studies on the behaviour of some organic substances in humans.Plett - Schmidseder by K. G.

From 1853 to 1858, he was associated with the German Hospital in London, during which time, he also served as a civilian physician in the service of the British government in Smyrna and in the Crimea (1855\u201356). In 1859 he received his habilitation at the University of Munich, becoming an honorary professor in 1863. In 1866 he was appointed director of the children's polyclinic at the Reisingerianum in Munich. Here he worked together with Max Sandreczky who became his assistant, and probably influenced Sandreczky's decision to dedicate his career to the care of children. In 1874 Ranke became an associate professor, and in 1886, was named as director of Hauner's Kinderspital at the university.Ranke at Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB).
