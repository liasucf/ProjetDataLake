Bath's major hospital, the Royal United Hospital, is in the north-east of the ward in Combe Park, bordering Weston village. Lansdown Cricket Club's ground is alongside the hospital. Weston Recreation Ground is in Newbridge ward. Newbridge is the location of Partis College, which was built as large block of almshouses between 1825 and 1827. It is designated as a Grade I listed building. The National Cycle Network Bristol and Bath Railway Path runs westward from Newbridge to Bristol, and a continuation riverside cycle and footpath runs eastward into central Bath. Newbridge Park and Ride is just off the A4 road on the western edge of the ward, alongside the Newbridge Meadows village green. Since boundary changes effected at the elections held on 2 May 2019 the ward now also includes two civil parishes outside the city boundary: Kelston and North Stoke. ==History== === The New Bridge === The New Bridge in 1806 The area is named after the New Bridge over the River Avon outside Bath, built in 1734. This was built to replace a ford that was one of the last impediments to navigation between Bristol and Bath. The bridge had pierced spandrels and arches on either side to allow flood water to pass easily. The bridge was widened and improved in the 1830s to the version that now carries the A4 road from Bath to Bristol out of Newbridge. === Development as a suburb === From about 1902 to 1939 a tram service from central Bath to Newton St Loe operated down Newbridge Road and across the bridge. In 1915 Sidney Horstmann and his brothers built a large factory, Newbridge Works, in what was then the outskirts of Bath. The general engineering company, The Horstmann Gear Company, specialised in gas street lighting controls, time switches, gauges, and latterly central heating controls, used \"Newbridge\" as a trademark for some of its products. The factory closed in 2000, and the site was redeveloped for housing. ==Schools== Educationally, Newbridge is part of the North West Bath area of Bath and North East Somerset. This area has three primary schools: * Newbridge Primary School * St Mary's Catholic Primary School * Weston All Saints CE VC Primary School and one secondary school: * Oldfield School though at secondary school level, many of the girls from the Newbridge area attend Hayesfield Girls' School and many of the boys attend Beechen Cliff School. ==See also== *Fairfield House, Bath *Minerva Bath Rowing Club *Weston Lock ==References== ==External links== *Newbridge ID 9732, Unitary Authority ward map, mysociety.org *Ward Profile \u2013 Newbridge, Bath and North East Somerset Category:Areas of Bath, Somerset Category:Electoral wards in Bath and North East Somerset Category:Bridges across the River Avon, Bristol ",
