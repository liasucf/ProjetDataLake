It is part of the Jefferson County Public School District. ==History== ===Ninth and Chestnut (1856\u20131897)=== Founded in 1856, Louisville Male High School became one of the first high schools west of the Allegheny Mountains. Therefore, Male was known originally as \"High School.\" In 1861, Male was designated The University of Public Schools of Louisville and awarded bachelor's degrees until 1921. After other high schools were established in the years following, the school was named Louisville Male High School. The \"H\" was kept as the school's letter for tradition and to honor the origins of the school. ===First Street near Chestnut (1898\u20131915)=== ===Corner of Brook Street and Breckinridge Street (1915\u20131991)=== In the 1970s, Male was chosen as the Traditional High School, becoming the first magnet program in the school district.Third site (1915\u20131991) in 2012 In 1976, an early-morning bomb explosion on Labor Day caused damage to the school's gymnasium; it occurred during several days of anti-busing protests in the Louisville area. The FBI was called in to investigate. This location () is now owned by Salvation Army and is a historic landmark in Louisville. ===4409 Preston Highway (1991\u2013present)=== In August 1991, Male moved to its current campus at 4409 Preston Highway, an educational facility that doubled the instructional, laboratory, library and campus space. Since it has moved to this location, the school has won two U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon awards. The site was previously Sallie P. Durrett High School, which became the Durrett Education Center in the early 1980s and was used by Jefferson County Public Schools Library Media Services until 1991. The adjoining Gheens Academy, which opened in 1983, was previously Prestonia Elementary School. ==Academics== The school runs a unique curriculum that is different from the other public high schools in the city. All students participate in the College Preparatory Program so as to aid in a smooth the transition to higher education. Students have an opportunity to graduate with a Commonwealth Diploma, which demands more than the required units for graduating high school in JCPS. One of the stipulations is the successful completion (i.e., receiving a grade of \"C\" or its equivalent) in 6 AP courses in the areas of English, science/mathematics, foreign language, and elective. ==Athletics== On Saturday, November 18, 1893, the annual Male-Manual football rivalry, the longest running, continuously played, high school football series in Kentucky, began. Their football team is a perennial state power, and in addition to its long-running rivalry with Manual, Male is also a close rival with St. Xavier High School, with the annual contest usually determining the fate of the district champion; however, due to the state's realignment of high school football into a six-class system starting in 2007\u201308, Male also has a rivalry with Trinity High School in football. The school offers football, basketball, baseball, softball, bowling, tennis, soccer, field hockey, wrestling, swimming, track and field and lacrosse. ===Venues=== Maxwell Field, formerly called High School Park, was the football stadium located behind Male's former location on Brook Street. This is now the site of the Dawson Orman Education Center. ===Sports championships=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ State Championships |- ! scope=\"col\" | Sport ! scope=\"col\" | Sex ! scope=\"col\" | Years won |- ! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | Baseball | Men | 1944 |- ! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | Basketball | Men | 1945, 1970, 1971, 1975 |- ! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | Football | Men | 1924, 1937, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1951, 1954, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2015, 2018 (unofficial prior to 1960) |- ! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | Golf | Men | 1941, 1942, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948 |- ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Soccer | Men | 1983 |- | Women | 1993, 1994 |- ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Track and field | Men | 1921, 1923, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1932, 1936, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017 |- | Women | 1966, 1968, 1972, 2016, 2017, 2018 |- ! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | Softball | Women | 2019 |} ==Notable alumni== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !
