His paternal grandfather, also named Abdulah, was a co-founder of the Party of Democratic Action in 1990. The Skaka family first arrived to Sarajevo around 1665, when his ancestor opened the cities first barber shop in the Stari Grad municipality. Since 2009, he has worked as the general manager of SKY Media company in Sarajevo.

In July 2019, he awarded American senator Bob Dole the Key to the City of Sarajevo for his 96th birthday, inviting him to the visit the city again for his 97th birthday in 2020. ==Controversies== Skaka claimed to have graduated the School of Economics and Business at the University of Sarajevo in 2011, although in October 2018 it was found that he actually attended the University of Travnik. He also been criticized for his lack of knowledge of regional politics and politicians, such as once claiming on television that Bosnian politician Stjepan Kljui\u0107 was the president of Croatia Stjepan Mesi\u0107, apparently confusing the two. On 28 February 2020, it was revealed in a leaked recording that his election for Sarajevo mayor was not legitimate and that decisive votes had been bought. Publishing of the leaked recording resulted in a series of calls for resignation or suspension of Skaka, including petition by citizens, several calls for resignation or suspension by politicians or political parties present in the City Council of Sarajevo, and by intellectuals. ==References== ==External links== *Abdulah Skaka at Facebook Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sarajevo Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Muslims Category:Politicians of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Party of Democratic Action politicians Category:Mayors of Sarajevo ",
