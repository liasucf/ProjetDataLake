    "text": "Albert Rose (30 March 1910 - 26 July 1990) was an American physicist, who made major contributions to TV video camera tubes such as the orthicon, image orthicon, and vidicon. ==Biography== He received an A.B. degree and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from Cornell University in 1931 and 1935, respectively. He joined RCA, where was active in the development of TV camera tubes. Rose was an expert on photoconductivity. He wrote a book \"Concepts in photoconductivity and allied problems\", which was published by John Wiley & Sons, New York in 1963. He also did research on the visibility of objects in a noisy signal, such as from TV tubes. He found that humans could distinguish small objects in noisy images at near 100% accuracy if the object brightness differed from the background by at least 5 times the noise standard deviation; this signal-to- noise relationship is known as the Rose criterion. Rose also originated the concept of detective quantum efficiency, today widely used in optical and X-ray imaging. He died in 1990. ==US patents== * Photoconductor for imaging devices * Pickup tube target * Method of reproducing an electrostatic charge pattern in intensified form ==Honors and awards== * Member, National Academy of Engineering in 1975 * IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) Edison Medal in 1979 * IEEE Morris N.
