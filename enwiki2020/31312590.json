    "text": "The Registered Professional Accountant (RPA) is a Canadian accounting designation granted by the Society of Professional Accountants of Canada (SPAC). The designation requires passing a set of four exams including Taxation, Accounting, Finance and Auditing and a completion of University or College courses set by the Society. Direct admission as a RPA into the society is also offered to those holding recognized accounting designations including the CMA, CGA, CA and CPA. The RPA qualifies to act as a Canadian passport guarantor and is recognized for admission as an associate member to the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Australia. RPAs are also eligible to write the Forensic Certified Public Accountant exam offered by the Forensic CPA Society in the state of Washington USA. The RPA designation is recognized by the Ontario Civil service, Ministry of Education and Training Ontario and Management Board of Cabinet of Ontario for employment purposes. The RPA designation is not as well known as the CGA, CMA and CA designations in Canada due to its limited number of members. These three accounting designations are in advanced discussions to unify as Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada).http://www.taxclinic.ca/tax- tips/2013/01/05/cpa-canada However, SPAC is currently under negotiations with other small accounting associations in Canada for a possible merger that can help to increase numbers and market acceptability. ==References== Category:Accounting in Canada ",
