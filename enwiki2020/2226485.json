Both these banks were subsidiaries of the State Bank of India under the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Bank) Act, 1959. On 25 April 1966 SBBJ took over Govind Bank (Private) Ltd., Mathura, established on 8 February 1963. In 1984 SBBJ sponsored and established Ganganagar Kshetriya Gramin Bank as a Regional Rural Bank. Thereafter, in 1985 SBBJ opened the Bikaner Kshetriya Gramin Bank, the second Regional Rural Bank sponsored by it. The third Regional Rural Bank, sponsored by SBBJ was Marwar Gramin Bank, which covered the districts of Pali, Jalore and Sirohi. On 12 June 2006, SBBJ merged all three regional rural banks that it sponsored under the name MGB Gramin Bank, with headquarters in Jodhpur. The plans to make SBI one of the top 50 banks in India affected SBBJ very much. In 2016, the plan to merge SBBJ with its five co-subsidiaries was made, and it was ratified by the Government of India on 15 February 2017. It finally merged with SBI on 31 March 2017. ==References== ==External links== * SBBJ official website Category:State Bank of India Category:Banks established in 1963 Category:Companies based in Rajasthan Category:Economy of Jaipur Category:Defunct banks of India ",
