    "text": "State Road 22, commonly known as Ibar Highway (), is an IB-class road, connecting Belgrade with \u0160umadija and Western Serbia and finally with Montenegro at \u0160piljani border crossing. It starts with Orlova\u010da interchange in Belgrade's municipality of \u010cukarica and is going through several major municipalities such as Ljig, Gornji Milanovac, Preljina (town in the municipality of \u010ca\u010dak), Kraljevo and Novi Pazar. In the southern section, highway goes in parallel to the upper course of the river Ibar, hence the name. Before the new road categorization regulation given in 2013, the route wore the following names: M 22 and M 2 (before 2012) / A2, A4, 15 and 32 (after 2012). The road is a part of the following European routes: E65 and E80 (Bregovi \u2013 Mehov Kr\u0161), E761 (Preljina \u2013 Kraljevo) and E763 (Belgrade \u2013 Preljina). ==Motorway alternative== In order to provide the safer and faster traffic link of Belgrade with Western Serbia and Montenegrin coast, and to alleviate the dangers of the Ibar Highway, the new A2 motorway is under construction from \u010ca\u010dak to border with Montenegro. The section from Belgrade bypass to \u010ca\u010dak was completed in 2019, and since then the traffic over the highway on section from Belgrade to \u010ca\u010dak was significantly reduced. ==Accident statistics== A single-lane carriageway, it bears heavy car and truck traffic between major cities of Belgrade, \u010ca\u010dak, Kraljevo and Novi Pazar, as well as transit traffic towards Montenegro, and occasional agricultural machinery is not unseen. If features long stretches of straight road interrupted by dangerous curves. Speeding, DUI and other traffic offences are major causes of accidents, most of them occurring during the night. In three-year span from 2017 to 2019, a total of 1,736 traffic accidents happened on its route, with 86 deaths and 1,619 injured people. Before the completion of motorway on section from Belgrade to \u010ca\u010dak, with more than 18,000 vehicles passing the highway daily (as of 2016), it was one of the most frequent roads in Serbia. Often called the \"black highway\", it is considered the most dangerous road in Serbia, averaging several hundreds traffic accidents annually. ==Sections== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Section number !Length !Distance !Section name |- |02201 |/ | |Orlova\u010da interchange \u2013 Ripanj |- |02202 | | |Ripanj \u2013 Lipovi\u010dka \u0161uma (Barajevo) |- |02203 | | |Lipovi\u010dka \u0161uma (Barajevo) \u2013 Lipovi\u010dka \u0161uma (Velika Mo\u0161tanica) |- |02204 | | |Lipovi\u010dka \u0161uma (Velika Mo\u0161tanica) \u2013 Meljak (Barajevo) |- |02205 | | |Meljak (Barajevo) \u2013 Meljak (Vrani\u0107) |- |02206 | | |Meljak (Vrani\u0107) \u2013 Stepojevac (Dra\u017eevac) |- |02207 | | |Stepojevac (Dra\u017eevac) \u2013 Stepojevac (Veliki Crljeni) |- |02208 | | |Stepojevac (Veliki Crljeni) \u2013 Lazarevac (Ibar Road) |- |02209 | | |Lazarevac (Ibar Road) \u2013 \u0106elije (overlap with State Road 27) |- |02210 | | |\u0106elije \u2013 \u017dupanjac |- |02211 | | |\u017dupanjac \u2013 Dudovica |- |02212 | | |Dudovica \u2013 Poljanice |- |02213 | | |Poljanice \u2013 Ljig |- |02214 | | |Ljig \u2013 Kadina Luka |- |02215 | | |Kadina Luka \u2013 Di\u0107i |- |02216 | | |Di\u0107i \u2013 Ugrinovci |- |02217 | | |Ugrinovci \u2013 Bu\u0107in Grob |- |02218 | | |Bu\u0107in Grob \u2013 Gornji Milanovac (Nevade) |- |02219 | | |Gornji Milanovac (Nevade) \u2013 Gornji Milanovac |- |02220 | | |Gornji Milanovac \u2013 Preljina |- |02221 | | |Preljina \u2013 Mr\u010dajevci (overlap with State Road 23) |- |02222 | | |Mr\u010dajevci \u2013 Kraljevo (overlap with State Road 23) |- |02223 | | |Kraljevo \u2013 Kraljevo (Jar\u010dujak) |- |02224 | | |Kraljevo (Jar\u010dujak) \u2013 Mataru\u0161ka Banja |- |02225 | | |Mataru\u0161ka Banja \u2013 U\u0161\u0107e |- |02226 | | |U\u0161\u0107e \u2013 Bare |- |02227 | | |Bare \u2013 Biljanovac |- |02228 | | |Biljanovac \u2013 Brvenik |- |02229 | | |Brvenik \u2013 Ra\u0161ka (Kosovska Mitrovica) |- |02230 | | |Ra\u0161ka (Kosovska Mitrovica) \u2013 Ra\u0161ka (Kuti) |- |02231 | | |Ra\u0161ka (Kuti) \u2013 Novi Pazar (Banja) |- |02232 | | |Novi Pazar (Banja) \u2013 Novi Pazar |- |02233 | | |Novi Pazar \u2013 Novi Pazar (Br\u0111ani) |- |02234 | | |Novi Pazar (Br\u0111ani) \u2013 Ribari\u0107e (overlap with State Road 32) |- |02235 | | |Ribari\u0107e \u2013 Bregovi |- |02236 | | |Bregovi \u2013 Serbia \u2013 Montenegro border (\u0160piljani) |} ==See also== * Roads in Serbia * European route E65 * European route E80 * European route E761 * European route E763 ==References== ==External links== * Official website \u2013 Roads of Serbia (Putevi Srbije) * Official website \u2013 Corridors of Serbia (Koridori Srbije) (Serbian) * Map of Serbian main and regional roads Category:State roads in Serbia ",
