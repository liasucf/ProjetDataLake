    "text": "Grimspound is the tenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Big Big Train. Released on 28 April 2017, it was recorded at English Electric Studios, produced by Big Big Train, and mixed and mastered at Aubitt Studios by Rob Aubrey. Following the release of their previous album, Folklore, the band had planned to release an EP called Skylon that would contain a handful of songs not completed in time to be included on that album. During the recording sessions to finish off the songs the band realised that they had enough material for a full album, deciding to release it as Grimspound. Grimspound is intended to be a companion release to Folklore and features a guest appearance from former Fairport Convention singer Judy Dyble. Upon release it entered the UK music charts at position 45, the band's first time placing in the official charts. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- | |- |} ==Personnel== Big Big Train * Nick D'Virgilio \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on \"A Mead Hall in Winter\" * Dave Gregory \u2013 electric guitars * Rachel Hall \u2013 violin, viola, cello, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on \"As the Crow Flies\" * David Longdon \u2013 lead and backing vocals, flute, piano, electric guitars, mandolin, banjo, lute, celesta, synthesisers, percussion * Danny Manners \u2013 keyboards, double bass * Andy Poole \u2013 acoustic guitar, keyboards, backing vocals * Rikard Sj\u00f6blom \u2013 keyboards, electric guitars, backing vocals * Greg Spawton \u2013 bass guitar, bass pedals Additional musicians * Judy Dyble \u2013 vocals (on \"The Ivy Gate\") * Philip Trzebiatowski \u2013 cello (on \"On the Racing Line\") Production * Rob Aubrey \u2013 mixing, mastering * Rachel Hall \u2013 string arrangements ==References== Category:Big Big Train albums Category:2017 albums ",
