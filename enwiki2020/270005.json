    "text": "In the mathematics of transfinite numbers, an ineffable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number, introduced by . In the following definitions, \\kappa will always be a regular uncountable cardinal number. A cardinal number \\kappa is called almost ineffable if for every f: \\kappa \\to \\mathcal{P}(\\kappa) (where \\mathcal{P}(\\kappa) is the powerset of \\kappa) with the property that f(\\delta) is a subset of \\delta for all ordinals \\delta < \\kappa, there is a subset S of \\kappa having cardinality \\kappa and homogeneous for f, in the sense that for any \\delta_1 < \\delta_2 in S, f(\\delta_1) = f(\\delta_2) \\cap \\delta_1. A cardinal number \\kappa is called ineffable if for every binary-valued function f : [\\kappa]^2\\to \\\\{0,1\\\\}, there is a stationary subset of \\kappa on which f is homogeneous: that is, either f maps all unordered pairs of elements drawn from that subset to zero, or it maps all such unordered pairs to one. An equivalent formulation is that a cardinal \\kappa is ineffable if for every sequence such that each , there is such that is stationary in . More generally, \\kappa is called n-ineffable (for a positive integer n) if for every f : [\\kappa]^n\\to \\\\{0,1\\\\} there is a stationary subset of \\kappa on which f is n-homogeneous (takes the same value for all unordered n-tuples drawn from the subset). Thus, it is ineffable if and only if it is 2-ineffable. A totally ineffable cardinal is a cardinal that is n-ineffable for every 2 \\leq n < \\aleph_0. If \\kappa is (n+1)-ineffable, then the set of n-ineffable cardinals below \\kappa is a stationary subset of \\kappa. Every n-ineffable cardinal is n-almost ineffable (with set of n-almost ineffable below it stationary), and every n-almost ineffable is n-subtle (with set of n-subtle below it stationary). The least n-subtle cardinal is not even weakly compact (and unlike ineffable cardinals, the least n-almost ineffable is \\Pi^1_2-describable), but n-1-ineffable cardinals are stationary below every n-subtle cardinal. A cardinal \u03ba is completely ineffable iff there is a non-empty R \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(\\kappa) such that \\- every A \\in R is stationary \\- for every A \\in R and f : [\\kappa]^2\\to \\\\{0,1\\\\}, there is B \\subseteq A homogeneous for f with B \\in R. Using any finite n > 1 in place of 2 would lead to the same definition, so completely ineffable cardinals are totally ineffable (and have greater consistency strength). Completely ineffable cardinals are \\Pi^1_n-indescribable for every n, but the property of being completely ineffable is \\Delta^2_1. The consistency strength of completely ineffable is below that of 1-iterable cardinals, which in turn is below remarkable cardinals, which in turn is below \u03c9-Erd\u0151s cardinals. A list of large cardinal axioms by consistency strength is available here. ==See also== * List of large cardinal properties ==References== *. * Category:Large cardinals ",
