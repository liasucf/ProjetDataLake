Respecting its history scarcely anything is known, and it cannot be ascertained whether it owed its name to the emperor Vespasian, or to some member of the family of Constantine. In later times it was the see of a Christian bishop. Its site is located near Kadirli in Asiatic Turkey. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Cilicia Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Roman towns and cities in Turkey Category:Populated places of the Byzantine Empire Category:History of Mersin Province ",
