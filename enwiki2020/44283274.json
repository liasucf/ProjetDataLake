Excellent scientists who do not teach at a university (but work in a research institution, for example) do not receive the title of Professor. The title of professor is indicated in abbreviation in front of a holder's name, e.g. prof. Jan \u0160vejnar or prof. MUDr. Josef Kouteck\u00fd, DrSc. The title of professor is awarded to a particular person on the basis of the recommendation by a university, in particular, by its Scientific Committee (v\u011bdeck\u00e1 rada), which is accredited to do so by the Accreditation Commission (akredita\u010dn\u00ed komise) of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (Czech Republic) (Ministerstvo \u0161kolstv\u00ed, ml\u00e1de\u017ee a t\u011blov\u00fdchovy). The recommended nominee is promoted to professorship by the president of the Czech Republic through the Minister of Education (art. 76 of Higher Education Act, act No. 111/1998 Col). The system of awarding of the title of professor means that the title is not bound to a position at a university, e.g. a director of a department, and vice versa \u2013 one is not required to be a professor to hold a high-ranking position at a university. A university must have a certain number of professors and docents among its staff to receive accreditation for its study programs, but these need not necessarily be heads of departments or university faculties. According to the Higher Education Act, No. 111/1998 Col. the nominee\u2019s qualifications are assessed by at least five professors, specialists in the field or a field similar to the field in which the nominee is to be pronounced a professor. At least three of these professors must be from universities other than the nominee's one. An important precondition set by the law is that the nominee must already have the title of Docent. (The procedure of qualification, habilita\u010dn\u00ed process, leading to the awarding of the title of docent is similar to the one leading to professorship. Docents are pronounced by the head of the university, rektor, accredited to pronounce docents in a particular field.) The ranking system of teachers at Czech universities: * ' is usually a doctoral student or a graduate of a PhD. study program. * ' is usually a graduate of a PhD. study program with some teaching and/or research experience. * Docent has finished a PhD. program and has been awarded the title of docent after their work and contribution to science or scholarship had been scrutinised by an assembly of five professors and docents. * ' has been pronounced a professor after being pronounced a docent. ===Other professors=== In the past, there were two titles of professor recognised in Czechoslovakia (predecessor state of today's Czech rep. and Slovak rep.): #University professor (universitn\u00ed profesor) #Secondary school professor (st\u0159edo\u0161kolsk\u00fd profesor) Awarding of both of these titles was regulated by law before the World War II. The title st\u0159edo\u0161kolsk\u00fd profesor ceased to exist after the war. However, on most of the secondary schools in Czech Republic and Slovakia students still address their teachers as professors (profeso\u0159i) out of tradition. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Academic ranks Category:Education in the Czech Republic Category:Education in Slovakia Ranks Ranks ",
