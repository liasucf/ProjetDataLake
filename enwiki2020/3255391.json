    "text": "Franz Seldte (29 June 18821 April 1947) was a German politician who served as the Reich Minister for Labour from 1933 to 1945.Stackelberg (2007). The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 243. Prior to his ministry, Seldte served as the Federal Leader of Der Stahlhelm World War I ex-servicemen's organisation from 1918 to 1934. Ideologically, he identified as a national conservative. ==Early life and education== Born in Magdeburg in the Prussian province of Saxony, Seldte was the son of an owner of a factory producing chemical products and soda water.Stackelberg (2007). The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 243. He attended the Wilhelm-Raabe-Gymnasium in Magdeburg and, after an apprenticeship as a salesman, studied chemistry at the universities of Braunschweig and Greifswald. In 1908 he took over the business of his early deceased father.Wistrich (2001). Who's Who In Nazi Germany, p. 232. As an officer of the German Army he was wounded in World War I and lost his left arm.Stackelberg (2007). The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 243. He then became a front reporter. Awarded with the Iron Cross 2nd and 1st class,Snyder (1976). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 320. Seldte also was promoted to the rank of Hauptmann d.R. in the 66th Infantry Regiment. ==Der Stahlhelm== Seldte (r.) with Hugenberg and the Berlin Stahlhelm leader von Stephani at a rally against the Young-Plan, Berlin Sportpalast, 1929 As a reaction to the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, Seldte founded Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten on 25 December 1918, agitating against the Treaty of Versailles and German war reparations. According to Seldte, the organization was to use the spirit of the Frontsoldaten against the \u2018swinish revolution\u2019 taking place in Germany under the Weimar government.Snyder (1976). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 320. While he took charge of Der Stahlhelm from 1923 onwards, he had to cope with the constant rivalry of his deputy leader, the militant Theodor Duesterberg. Seldte became a member of the national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and was a member of the Magdeburg city council (Stadtrat). During the later years of the Weimar Republic Der Stahlhelm became increasingly anti-democratic and anti- republican. However, Seldte hoped that the organization could become a leading organ of a united right-wing movement. In 1929 it united its forces with the DNVP under Alfred Hugenberg, the Pan-German League and the Nazi Party to initiate a German referendum against the Young Plan on World War I reparations.Kershaw (2000). Hitler: 1889-1936, Hubris, p. 310, 356. The common goal was to denounce the Chancellor Hermann M\u00fcller and his ministers as traitors to their country, nevertheless the plebiscite failed to reach the quorum. In 1931 Seldte helped create the short-lived Harzburg Front,Zentner & Bed\u00fcrftig, eds. The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, vol. 2, (M-Z), p. 869. a right-wing alliance against the government of M\u00fcller's successor Heinrich Br\u00fcning. ==Minister for Labour== During the negotiations for the Chancellorship of Germany between Franz von Papen and Hitler in mid-January 1933, Seldte threw his vote and Der Stahlhelm behind Hitler, after which, Papen acquiesced to Hitler\u2019s demands.Longerich (2012). Heinrich Himmler, p. 144. On the day of the Machtergreifung on 30 January 1933, Seldte joined the Hitler Cabinet as Reich Minister for Labour,Shirer (1990). The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p. 184. once again outdoing his long-time rival Duesterberg. In the run-up to the elections of March 1933 Der Stahlhelm together with Hugenberg's national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) attempted to make the Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot (\"Black White Red Combat Front\") into the dominant political camp on the right, but ultimately failed as it only gained 8.0% of the votes cast. Nevertheless, Seldte obtained a seat in the Reichstag parliament as a DNVP \"guest\". On 27 April 1933 Seldte finally joined the Nazi Party and merged Der Stahlhelm into Ernst R\u00f6hm's Sturmabteilung (SA) militia \u2013 de facto placing it at the disposal of Hitler.Bracher (1970). The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism, p. 222. In August 1933, he was awarded the rank of SA-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer and later was appointed Reichskommissar for the Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst employment program, but was soon superseded by his state secretary Konstantin Hierl as leader of the Reichsarbeitsdienst organization. In March 1934 Seldte was made the federal leader of the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontk\u00e4mpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm) () (NSDFBSt), a successor organization of Der Stahlhelm, which however was soon disbanded. In 1935 he requested to be released from official responsibilities, but Hitler refused. Throughout his tenure as chief of the Labor Ministry, Seldte never enjoyed the full support of Hitler, who did not think he was worth much. As a result, members of the Nazi hierarchy began encroaching on his areas of responsibility and Seldte was marginalized accordingly.Fischer (1995). Nazi Germany: A New History, p. 315. For instance, Hermann Goering\u2019s Four Year Plan which he began to implement in late 1936, ran roughshod over Seldte's Labor Ministry altogether.Evans (2006). The Third Reich in Power, p. 358. Seldte, without substantial power, remained Reich Minister for Labour until the end of World War II and was also a member of the Prussian government under Minister president Hermann G\u00f6ring as State Labour Minister. Even after Hitler\u2019s suicide and the nomination of Grand-Admiral D\u00f6nitz as his successor, Seldte kept his post, being accordingly named Labour Minister.Mazower (2009). Hitler\u2019s Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe, pp. 532\u2013533. ==Death== Seldte was captured and arrested in Mondorf-les-Bains at the end of the war. During the Nuremberg trials, Seldte tried to exonerate himself by claiming that he had stood against the dictatorship of Hitler and that he advocated for a two-chamber system of parliamentary governance.Taylor & Shaw (2002). Dictionary of the Third Reich, p. 261. His story was not convincing. Seldte died in a US military hospital in April 1947 at F\u00fcrth, before the Nuremberg Tribunal had the chance to formally arraign him on charges.Snyder (1976). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 320. ==Legacy== During the time of Nazi Germany, streets were named after him in several German cities, among them his hometown Magdeburg and Leverkusen.Franz-Seldte-Str.
