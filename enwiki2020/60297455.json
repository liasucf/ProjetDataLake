It was operated by Virgin Galactic, a private company led by Richard Branson which intends to conduct space tourism flights in the future. Following VSS Unity VP-03, VF-01 was a demonstration of the craft's ability to carry passengers. Virgin Galactic's chief astronaut trainer Beth Moses acted as a test passenger, evaluating the experience for potential customers. Reaching an apogee of , the flight satisfied the United States definition of spaceflight (), but fell short of the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line (), the internationally accepted standard. ==Crew== Flights are currently only by U.S Convention. ==Flight== On 22 February 2019, Unity's mother ship VMS Eve carried it into flight in a parasite configuration. Shortly before 9 a.m., Unity was drop launched. Pilots MacKay and Masucci flew Unity at a maximum Mach of 3.04 to a maximum altitude of over . This altitude surpassed the 50-mile limit used in the United States to denote the limit of space, but fell short of the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. Both craft landed safely afterwards. During flight, Moses unstrapped from her seat and experienced weightlessness. Per the U.S. convention, Moses was also the first woman aboard a commercial spacecraft. ==References== Category:2019 in California Category:2019 in spaceflight Category:2019 in aviation Category:SpaceShipTwo Category:Test spaceflights Category:Aviation history of the United States Category:History of the Mojave Desert region Category:Mojave Air and Space Port Category:Suborbital human spaceflights Category:February 2019 events in the United States ",
