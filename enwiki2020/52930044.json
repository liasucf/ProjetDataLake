Isg\u00e5rd lies 10 kilometers from the city \u00c5rhus in a straight line across \u00c5rhus Bugt, but 47 kilometers by road around the bay.Krak.dk As of 2011 Isg\u00e5rd includes 263 hectares of land. There are modern pig farm buildings with a registered production capacity of 12.000 piglets weighing 7 to 30 kilos per year.Landbrugsm\u00e6glerne.dk These buildings are located out of sight of the main buildings, but are visible from the southern sea front in Begtrup Vig. The oldest of Isg\u00e5rd's buildings are about 300 years old dating back to the 1700s.Historian Vilfred Friborg Hansen, Friborg.dk Isg\u00e5rd viewed from Begtrup Vig (Begtrup Bay) with newer farm buildings specialized for breeding piglets in the foreground View from the hills above Isg\u00e5rd over \u00c5rhus Bay towards the west in direction of mainland Jutland and the southern outskirts of \u00c5rhus The small public country road leading to Isg\u00e5rd, Isg\u00e5rdsvej, runs through the main yard continuing under a narrow archway through one of the old farm buildings, turning up a hill as an unpaved road to Landborup. Here the road passes a viewpoint 80 meters above sea level. From this spot there is a view of many of southern Djursland's bays, as well as 10 kilometers across \u00c5rhus Bugt to mainland Jutland with the seaport of \u00c5rhus clearly seen. \u00c5rhus is Denmark's second largest city lying south of the peninsula, Djursland, where Isg\u00e5rd is located on the southern part. The public road to Isg\u00e5rd goes through the main yard continuing through one of the farm buildings via an archway. Steep slopes with coastal erosion by Isg\u00e5rd.

Isg\u00e5rd has been owned by bishop Skjalm Vognsen, who was one of the builders of \u00c5rhus Cathedral in the 1100s and 1200s. From the hills up from Isg\u00e5rd, the cathedral in \u00c5rhus, with its 96 meter high tower, could clearly be seen in olden days. Today the built up harbor area partly obscures the view to the cathedral. When the Reformation came to Denmark around 1536, with the shift from Catholicism to Protestant Lutheranism, church belongings were confiscated by the king, including Isg\u00e5rd, that was part of \u00c5rhus Cathedral's estate. Eight years later, in 1544, the king sold Isg\u00e5rd to a neighboring squire in the area, High Court judge, Anders Christiernsen Sandberg of Quelstrup. In the early 1600s Isg\u00e5rd-owner Joachim Gersdorff bought three other estates around \u00c5rhus Bugt including Rols\u00f8g\u00e5rd, Vosn\u00e6sg\u00e5rd and Quelstrup. In the late 1700s this conglomerate was split up again. Through the 1800s Isg\u00e5rd often changed owners. In 1890 the existing main building was built by court squire Just Henrik Krieger, and his wife, baroness Ellen Gyldenstjerne. As of June 2016 Isg\u00e5rd is owned by Ole Danmark Knudsen.Landbrugsavisen.dk ==Surroundings== The coastline of Isg\u00e5rd to the south and the east consists of steep, often eroding, slopes down to the sea with a walkable beach, where the tidal difference is normally less than one foot.Molsportalen.dk The hilly moraine deposits in the area are dominated by different types of clay with spots of sandy material in between. Isg\u00e5rd's 3 kilometers of rarely visited scenic coastline is described as good for angling on various anglers' websites. Fish caught here include sea trout and flounders, plus, more seasonally, garfish and mackerel.VisitDjursland.com It takes some local knowledge to get down to this coast as an angler or hiker. One way is from Isg\u00e5rdsvej east of Isg\u00e5rd between Isg\u00e5rd and the village Eg, turning south down an easily overlooked, unpaved forest road recognizable by a small information poster at the roadside. This leads to a public footpath going to the sea. All in all it is about one kilometer from Isg\u00e5rdsvej. Via the path one can walk along the shoreline round Mols Hoved (Mols Head) including along Isg\u00e5rd',s coastline towards the summer house settlement, Sk\u00f8dshoved Strand, and Hundshoved. In Denmark access to all coastlines is public, secured by law. From Sk\u00f8dshoved Strand there is also access to the coastline from the northwest. The walk between Sk\u00f8dshoved Strand around Mols Hoved along the coast is about 6 kilometers. One can also walk part of the way along the fields at the top of the coastal slopes giving a better view, but with problems as to going down the steep slopes, if one wants to walk along the shore part of the way. From Isg\u00e5rd, one kilometer to the west, at the end of the partly gravel road, Molshovedvej, lies a minor summer house settlement in the hills next to \u00c5rhus Bugt and close to the steep and largely impassable slope down to the sea. In this summer house area there is a stairway down the slope to the sea. Nonresident driving is prohibited on Molshovedvej as a way of access to the sea, but one is allowed to walk or ride a bike on the road. This is another way to reach the coastline down from Isg\u00e5rd. 823 hectares in the proximity of Isg\u00e5rd were protected in 1982, with the purpose of securing the nature assets of the hilly landscape and securing better public access to the area and the sea.About protected areas, at fredninger.dk ==References == == External links == Category:Houses completed in 1700 Category:Tourist attractions in Denmark Category:Listed buildings and structures in Syddjurs Municipality Category:Tourist attractions in the Central Denmark Region ",
