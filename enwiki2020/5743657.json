    "text": "The Cornish Gilliflower is a cultivar of apple. This cultivar was found in a cottage garden in Truro, Cornwall, England, UK, in about 1800 and in 1813 was brought to the attention of the Royal Horticultural Society by Sir Christopher Hawkins, who was awarded a silver medal \"for his exertions\".The Gardener's Magazine, Vol 6, p.575, 1830 The word 'gilliflower' is possibly a corruption of a French word girofle meaning clove, believed to be a reference to its odour when cut. The leaves are small and the tree is not a strong grower. It ripens in October. The Cornish Gillyflower is used as a base for comparison by the RHS fruit committee to gauge the flavour of other apples. == References == Category:Cornish cuisine Category:British apples Category:Apple cultivars ",
