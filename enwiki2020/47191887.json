He decided to switch to linebacker before Kent State's Pro Day and shed 19 lbs. Representatives from eight NFL teams showed up to Kent State's Pro Day to watch 11 prospects including Dri Archer. ===Atlanta Falcons=== On May 10, 2014, the Atlanta Falcons signed Nix to a three-year, $1.54 million contract after he went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft.

He was placed on Other League Exempt by the team on January 5, 2015. ===Pittsburgh Steelers=== On January 9, 2015, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Nix to a one-year, $435,000 reserve/futures contract, reuniting him with former Kent State teammate Dri Archer. He originally was signed as an inside linebacker but with too much depth at the position he was again switched to fullback. With the Steelers' history of not typically using fullbacks under offensive coordinator Todd Haley and former coordinator Bruce Arians, Nix's best chance of keeping a position was a roster was to excel on special teams. During the pre-season, he made notable plays on special teams, including a blocked kick. ====2015==== On September 5, 2015, Nix made the regular season roster and was slated to be the backup to veteran Will Johnson. On October 18, 2015, he made his first career start during the Steelers' 25-14 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. He finished his first season appearing in 15 games with four starts. His first forced fumble was during Week 9 of the 2015 NFL season, on special teams, when the Steelers hosted the Oakland Raiders. For the season, he recorded two receptions for 11 yards, and seven special teams tackles. Nix was unfortunately unable to finish the season due to a foot injury. ====2016==== On January 19, 2016, he was signed to a one-year, $525,000 contract extension. During the 2015-2016 offseason, former starting fullback Will Johnson left via free agency to join the New York Giants. The Steelers named Nix the de facto starter at fullback going into the 2016 regular season. Nix was unable to appear in the first five games due to a back injury he suffered prior to the season-opener. On October 16, 2016, he appeared in his first game of the season during the Steelers' 30-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Nix made his first start of the season during a Week 11 victory over the Cleveland Browns. On January 1, 2017, he made his first two receptions for five receiving yards in a 27-24 overtime win over the Cleveland Browns. He finished his second season with two starts in ten games recording two catches for five yards. ====2017==== On January 26, 2017, the Steelers re- signed Nix to a one-year, $615,000 contract. He was the only fullback on the roster throughout training camp, making him their de facto starter to begin the regular season. On December 10, 2017, Nix scored his first career touchdown on a one-yard pass by Ben Roethlisberger in the fourth quarter of a 39-38 comeback victory over the Baltimore Ravens. On December 25, 2017, Nix scored his first career rushing touchdown with a one-yard run against the Houston Texans in the second quarter. On January 22, 2018, he was named to his first Pro Bowl as a replacement for the Super Bowl-bound James Develin. ====2018==== On February 10, 2018, Nix signed a four-year contract extension with the Steelers. On December 23, 2018, Nix briefly became the subject of ridicule for celebrating what he thought was a fourth down conversion on a fake punt against the New Orleans Saints when in actuality he was stopped a yard short. ====2019==== On September 2, 2019, Nix was voted as a first-time Steelers' Special Teams Captain by his teammates.
