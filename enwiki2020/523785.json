    "text": "The Tabula Capuana Recent image in the Altes Museum, Berlin The Tabula Capuana (=Tablet from Capua Ital. Tavola Capuana), is an ancient terracotta slab, 60 by 50 centimeters, with a long inscribed text in Etruscan, apparently a ritual calendar, of which about 390 words are legible. It is located in the Altes Museum, Berlin. It is the second-most extensive surviving Etruscan text. (The longest is the linen book (Liber Linteus) used in ancient Egypt for mummy wrappings, now at Zagreb.) ==Description== Horizontal scribed lines divide the text into ten sections. The writing is most similar to that used in Campania in the mid 5th century BC, though surely the text being transcribed is much older. It is an archaic ten-month year beginning in March (Etruscan Velxitna). Attempts at deciphering the text (Mauro Cristofani, 1995) are most generally based on the supposition that it prescribes certain rites on certain days of the year at certain places for certain deities. The text itself was edited by Francesco Roncalli, in Scrivere etrusco 1985. ==Discovery== The tablet was uncovered in 1898 in the burial ground of Santa Maria Capua Vetere. ==References== ==External links== *Basic information, adopted for this entry; photograph (Italian) *Curtun (Modern Cortona) *Full Etruscan text and translation into Italian Category:5th-century BC works Category:1898 archaeological discoveries Category:Clay tablets Category:Etruscan artefacts Category:Etruscan ceramics Category:Etruscan inscriptions Category:Capua (ancient city) Category:Archaeological discoveries in Italy ",
