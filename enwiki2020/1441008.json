    "text": "Golubac fortress Tabula Traiana in \u0110erdap National Park The \u0110erdap National Park ( / ) stretches along the right bank of the Danube River from the Golubac Fortress ( / ) to the dam near Novi Sip, Serbia. It was established in 1974 and spreads on . The park management office is in the town of Donji Milanovac on the Danube. Across the river is the Parcul Natural Por\u021bile de Fier in Romania. In July 2020 the wider area of the national park was designated as the UNESCO global geopark, as the first protected area from Serbia labeled that way. Apart from the Iron Gates Gorge, the geopark includes parts of the Miro\u010d and Ku\u010daj mountain massifs, with total area of . == Geography == The main feature and attraction of the \u0110erdap National Park's natural beauty is the \u0110erdap gorge - the famous Iron Gate - the grandiose gateway through the southern slopes of the Carpathian mountains where the longest and biggest river accumulation in former Yugoslavia is located. The \u0110erdap gorge, which is some long (from Golubac to Tekija), is actually a compound river valley made up of four gorges (Gornja klisura, Gospo\u0111in vir, Veliki and Mali kazan and Sipska klisura), separated from each other by ravines. In Gospo\u0111in vir, one of the greatest river depths in the world has been measured (). The cliffs of the canyon in Kazan are about high while the riverbed in this part is narrowed down to . The terrain is mountainous (Miro\u010d mountain) with numerous caves, pits, gorges, depressions, springs (karstic spring of Blederija on Miro\u010d) and lakes. There are several excellent natural scenic viewpoints, like the Veliki \u0161trbac and Mali \u0161trbac on the Miro\u010d, above the Kazan gorge. Panoramic view includes mountains of Deli Jovan and Veliki Kr\u0161 in Serbia and the Carpathians in Romania. Viewpoint Greben was named by Jovan \u017dujovi\u0107 as the \"most beautiful hill in the Balkans\" at the 1900 Geology congress in Budapest. Another popular feature above the Danube is the hill of Kapetan Mi\u0161in breg. The \u0110erdap is the longest breakthrough type gorge in Europe. === Blederija === The Blederija river springs from two karstic springs at an altitude of , under the Topla Bara peak. The springs are away from each other and one has a water temperature around , while the other has a constant . The river forms several cascades in the heavily forested area before creating the Blederija waterfall, tall. The average discharge varies greatly and during the catastrophic 2014 Southeast Europe floods, the river heavily flooded its lower valley causing damage. There are several caves left of the waterfall and the scenic viewpoint on the location of former medieval town. The waterfall is away from the closest village, Reka, from Brza Palanka and from the municipal seat of Kladovo. According to the folk mythology, the water fairies bath under the waterfall. The valley of the river is known for quality honey production. Surrounding area is rich in animal life, especially deer and wild boar, and there are two protected hunting grounds in the vicinity, Vratna and Plo\u010de. The Blederija continues in the southeast direction and receives rivers of Sokolovica and Suvaja. After receiving the Ravna reka, it continues into the Danube. The area is today heavily forested and scarcely populated, but in the Roman period, the legionaries built a road through this valley, as a shortcut between the locations where the modern towns of Donji Milanovac and Brza Palanka are. It was used by the Roman army until the emperor Trajan cut the road through the Iron Gates gorge itself. == Name == Both \u0110erdap and former Serbian name for it, Demir-kapija, are Turkish in origin. Demir-kapija means \"iron gate\" (demirkap\u0131) and a translation of it entered most of the other languages as the name of the gorge. \u0110erdap comes from girdap which means whirlpool, vortex. == Power plants == The territory of the national park is filled with a series of other important features: abundant and diversified animal and especially plant life, attractive surroundings and landscapes, cultural and historical monuments and other anthropogenic tourist attractions, including a Handbook on Yugoslavia (1987); Federal Secretariat for Information-Belgrade; Jovan \u0110. Markovi\u0107 (1990): Enciklopedijski geografski leksikon Jugoslavije; Svjetlost-Sarajevo; Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1986); Prosveta; artificial Lake \u0110erdap, the largest lake in Serbia, formed by the construction of an Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station (or \"\u0110erdap\"). The plant was finished in 1972, being fourth-largest in the world at the time (according to the staff at the power plant). It was a big collaboration project between Yugoslavia and Romania. The power plant employs a large number of the residents of the nearby town of Kladovo. The \"\u0110erdap\" power plant record power production was in 1980 of over 7 terawatt-hours (TW\u00b7h) electric power. With the building of the second power plant Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station (or \"\u0110erdap\" II, 1977\u201384) and the adjoining Lake \u0110erdap II , the original power plant became better known as \"\u0110erdap I\". The plans to build \"\u0110erdap III\" were also made. It wouldn't be a classical power plant with another dam, but was planned to use the hydro-electrical potential of the already existing Lake \u0110erdap. The reversible hydro plant was projected in the vicinity of Donji Milanovac, on the park territory in the Pesa\u010de section. The original projects are from the late 1960s, when \u0110erdap I was still in construction. Some preparatory works have been done in the 1970s on the location of Debelo Brdo, upstream of the mouth of the Boljetinska reka into the lake, but the idea was abandoned due to the worsening of the economic situation in Yugoslavia in the late 1970s and the power plant was never built. The concept envisioned the lifting of the lake water by the pumps from the height of , to the projected pools of Pesa\u010da and Brodica, with the capacity of , and only in the periods of the electricity surplus. During the dry or winter periods, \u0110erdap II would work as the classical hydro plant but using only stored waters which would fall for onto the turbines. As the entire facility and the auxiliary objects would be built on the bank of the Danube, it would be cheaper than building them on the land, as in thermo-electrical plants, and it would have twice the capacity of the \u0110erdap I or Kostolac thermal plant. The plant would produce 2,400 megawatts of electricity, which would cover the present consumption in the state and made Serbia an exporter of the electricity. Also, due to the mechanism of the electricity production, it wouldn't have negative consequences on the park's eco-system. == Wildlife == === Plants === Some 1,100 plant species inhabit the park. The include Tertiary relicts like Turkish hazel, walnut tree, European yew, largeleaf linden, downy oak and European holly. The \u0110erdap's tulip (Tulipa hungarica Borb\u00e1s), became extinct after the reservoir was formed. Out of 15 species which can be found only on the Balkans are Pan\u010di\u0107's maple and certain species of heartsease, wild thyme and meadow fescue. There are also Carpathian endemites like sweet carrot and Seseli rigidum. Internationally protected are floating fern, Fritillaria degeniana, water caltrop, Bulbophyllum loroglossum and cat grass. === Animals === The park is also a home to 150 bird species. In December 2018, a group of Dalmatian pelicans landed on the lake, close to the power plant. Their closest habitat is the Danube Delta, and they haven't been spotted in the \u0110erdap since 1914. The group left soon, but the pelicans returned in January 2019. == Human history == The national park is dotted with many natural and cultural values which are included in a special protection programme. Lepenski Vir is the 11,500-year-old archaeological site with exceptionally important traces of settlements and the life of the Mesolithic and later Neolithic people. Lepenski Vir was discovered in 1967 by Dragoslav Srejovi\u0107, but from 1965 to 1971 over 30 sites were discovered ranging from the Mesolithic to the Late Middle Ages. Around 800 BC it was part of the transit route of the Triballi, Dacians ant the Autariates while Romans arrived in the first century BC. \u0110erdap was part of the border zone of the empire and was on the route of the western extension of the Via Militaris. Some remnants of the road still survive. Roman Emperor Trajan built in 105 AD a famed Trajan's Bridge, from which the several pillars survived today so as the Tabula Traiana. There was also a Roman fortress Diana in Kladovo. Altogether, there are 4 cultural monuments and 19 archaeological finds. Major medieval monument is the Golubac fortress with numerous artifacts discovered in it: pottery, iron tools, hatchets, pickaxes, spears, bolts, etc. In the vicinity of the fortress are the remnants of the Turkish bath and the memorial drinking fountain dedicated to Zawisza the Black, Polish knight who was killed defending the fortress during the 1428 Siege of Golubac. The region is known for many myths which developed in time. Two of the most popular include the one about the devil face's midget with goat ears and legs, long white beard and the conical hat. He lives in the Danube's whirlpools and shows only at night. He ascends from the depths to drown people who swim in the river or fall off their boats. The other myth is about \"beluga\", a gigantic sturgeon which arises from the bottom to attack people. There are 27 settlements in the park territory with the total population of 35,000. == Protection == Apart from being a national park since 1974, \u0110erdap is also an Important Bird Area and Important Plant Area, and has been nominated for the European Geoparks Network. == Tourism == The \u0110erdap National Park has become one of the most visited tourist regions in Serbia especially after the construction of the dam and the formation of the large lake. The gorge and the hydroelectric power plant can be visited from Belgrade and other cities downstream from it. There are a number of tourist points in the park with hotel and other facilities, offering tourists rest and swimming and tours of the cultural and historical monuments and natural values. Though the Danube river is quite polluted by international standards, fishing is still very popular. Some large specimens of catfish have weighed in at over . == References == == External links == * National park Djerdap *Kladovo town website *Djerdap national park on UNESCO * Category:National parks of Serbia Category:Danube Category:Protected areas established in 1974 Category:Serbian Carpathians Category:Protected areas of the Carpathians ",
