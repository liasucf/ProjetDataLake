    "text": "Keep Britain Tidy is a UK-based independent environmental charity. The organisation campaigns to reduce litter, improve local places and prevent waste. It has offices in Wigan and London. ==History== Keep Britain Tidy was originally set up by a conference of 26 organisations in 1955. The conference was initiated by the British Women's Institute after a resolution was passed at its 1954 AGM to start a national anti-litter campaign. In 1987, Keep Britain Tidy changed its name to Tidy Britain Group. In 2002, following a merger with environmental awareness charity, Going for Green, the charity changed its name to ENCAMS \u2014 short for Environmental Campaigns. The \"tidyman\" logo In June 2009, the charity changed its name back to Keep Britain Tidy, introducing a new logo highlighting the IT within BRITAIN, reading \"Keep It Tidy\" as well as \"Keep Britain Tidy\". The \"tidyman\" logo is still used in public campaigns, alongside campaign straplines such as \"Let's keep it tidy!\" and \"Help keep it tidy!\" Following a year-long strategic alliance, in 2011 Keep Britain Tidy merged with the environmental charity Waste Watch. Keep Britain Tidy became the trading name. ==Timeline== === Beginnings === *1954: Led by its chair, Lady Elisabeth Brunner, the National Federation of Women's Institutes passes a resolution to \"Keep Britain Tidy\". *1958: For the first time, The Litter Act puts in place an overall law with fines of \u00a310 for people dropping litter. *1960: Group registers as a charity and company limited by guarantee. *1969: The tidyman logo appears on bins and packaging around the UK. *1970s: Public information films and high-profile national campaigning, including many popular faces of the day (such as ABBA, The Walt Disney Company, David Cassidy, Marc Bolan and Morecambe and Wise), have a marked impact on attitudes towards littering and awareness of the Keep Britain Tidy brand. *1971: The Dangerous Litter Act increases the maximum fine for dropping litter from \u00a310 to \u00a3100.
