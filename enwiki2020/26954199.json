    "text": "The Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems is a Geo-Energy research centre at Durham University. The centre was formed in January 2006, and since then has won a research income of \u00a31.3M per annum. The current Director of CeREES is Professor Jon Gluyas, co-author of textbook Petroleum Geoscience.[Gluyas, J.G., Swarbrick, R. 2004. Petroleum Geoscience Blackwell Publishing ] The Centre is part of the multidisciplinary Durham Energy Institute. CeREES is one of only three academic members of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association and is also a member of the Underground Coal Gasification Association. ==Research== CeREES began as a Petroleum Geoscience research centre, but has now expanded into all areas of Geo-Energy. The areas of research are: ===Petroleum Exploration and Production=== CeREES works with energy companies to carry out research in different areas of petroleum geoscience. These areas include: *Volcanic Rifted Margins [Jerram, D. A., Single, R. T., Hobbs, R. W. & Nelson, C. E. 2009.Understanding the offshore flood basalt sequence using onshore volcanic facies analogues: an example from the Faroe\u2013Shetland basin Geol. Mag. 146 (3), pp. 353\u2013367.] *Source Rocks *Overpressure [Davies, R.J., Manga, M., Tingay, M., Lusianga,S., Swarbrick, R. Discussion: \u2018Sawolo et al., (2009) The LUSI mud volcano controversy: Was it caused by drilling?\u2019] Marine and Petroleum Geology (2010) *Sedimentary and structural geology of passive margins ===Geothermal=== CeREES research in geothermal is related to micro seismicity linked with volcanically active regions, numerical modelling of hydro-mechanical effects [Simon A. Mathias, Chin-Fu Tsang and Maarten van Reeuwijk, 2010. Investigation of hydromechanical processes during cyclic extraction recovery testing of a deformable rock fracture. International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 47 (3) 517-522, ] and the exploitation of geothermal energy from low to medium grade geothermal aquifers. ===Carbon Capture and Storage=== Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an important component of many initiatives to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. CEREES recently appointed the first ever UK Professor of CCS.Carbon Capture Journal CeREES interests are specifically associated with the development and application of risking and screening tools.[Simon A. Mathias, Paul E. Hardisty, Mark R. Trudell and Robert W. Zimmerman, 2009. Approximate Solutions for Pressure Buildup During CO2 Injection in Brine Aquifers. Transport in Porous Media 79 (2) 265\u2013284, ] [Simon A. Mathias, Paul E. Hardisty, Mark R. Trudell and Robert W. Zimmerman, 2009. Screening and selection of sites for CO2 sequestration based on pressure buildup. International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 3 (5) 577-585, ] CeREES is involved in various CCS research projects, including the ETI sponsored UKSAP (UK Storage Appraisal Project). ===Clean Coal=== CeREES is involved in research into cleaner ways of using coal as a fossil fuel. Research projects on underground coal gasification, coal bed methane and enhanced coal bed methane are underway. ===Geo-Energy Scholarship Programme=== Students in the CeREES Geo-Energy Scholarship Programme are offered training in the energy industry through monthly short courses with industry professionals, as well as undertaking a PhD in a Geo-Energy topic. PhD studentships are funded by over 15 energy companies.CeREES Geo-Energy ==See also== *Geothermal Power *Carbon Capture and Storage *Underground Coal Gasification *Coal Bed Methane ==References== ==External links== * CeREES Centre for Geoenergy Category:Research institutes in the United Kingdom ",
