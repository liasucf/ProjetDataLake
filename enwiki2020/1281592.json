Originally focusing on the lighter side of the game, the programme was the foremost rugby league programme on United Kingdom television and was broadcast every week during the regular rugby league season. ==International Syndication== Boots 'N' All is an original British television concept, but an Australian version of the show was broadcast on the Nine Network, hosted by Andrew Voss and Phil Gould. It regularly featured chairman of Bye Supporters club Tim Andrews, and Sydney Roosters mascot Brian the Rooster. ==Presenters== The programme was anchored by Eddie Hemmings, Sky Sports regular Super League presenter and commentator, who was usually joined by two studio guests.

Bill Arthur, Rod Studd and Angela Powers also provided featured reports. ==Content== The week's tries, plus player and coaching interviews. Traditionally broadcast on a Wednesday night, the programme was switched to a Thursday to incorporate live matches from the National Leagues during the 2007 season. The programme reverted to a Wednesday the following season and continued to broadcast live at 6pm, with regular repeats during the proceeding 24 hours. The show usually featured a round up of the weeks news, followed by a discussion of the news. Highlights from a Championship match and previews of the weeks upcoming television matches were included.
