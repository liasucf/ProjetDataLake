    "text": "Joseph Lange (portrait by Friedrich Johann Gottlieb Lieder, 1808) Joseph Lange (W\u00fcrzburg, 1 April 1751 - Vienna, 17 September 1831) was an actor and amateur painter of the 18th century. Through his marriage to Aloysia Weber, he was the brother-in-law of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. ==Life== His first marriage, in 1775, was to Maria Anna Elisabeth Schindler, daughter of Philipp Ernst Schindler, a miniature painter and director of painting at the Viennese porcelain factory.A-Wd, Tom. 69, fol. 258r. Maria Anna died on 14 March 1779 of pneumonia.Lange 1808, 106 He married Aloysia Weber, a successful soprano, in Vienna on 31 October 1780. In that year he also agreed to support Aloysia's widowed mother C\u00e4cilia with an annual payment of 700 florins.Lange 1808, 117 Mozart married Aloysia's younger sister Constanze in Vienna in 1782, and thus became Lange's brother-in-law. The Mozarts and the Langes seem to have been friends, as the written record preserves various occasions that they socialized together,See Deutsch 1965, index entry for \"Lange, Joseph\". as did Wolfgang and Joseph individually.Solomon 275 Both Lange and Mozart were Masons; see Mozart and Freemasonry.Solomon 329 In 1783, Lange performed in one of Mozart's works, a \"Masquerade\" (pantomime with music) composed for Carnival. The characters were traditional figures of the Commedia dell'arte, and the music was composed by Mozart (K. 446). Lange played Pierrot, and Mozart himself took the role of Harlequin.Deutsch 1965, 213 In 1786, Lange appeared in another work by Mozart, his opera Der Schauspieldirektor. He took the spoken role of Herz,Deutsch 262 his wife Aloysia taking one of the two primary soprano roles, Madame Herz. As of 1795, he lived separated from Aloysia.Deutsch, 503 In 1808, he published his autobiography. From around 1800 on he lived together with a Therese Koch with whom he had three daughters.Bl\u00fcmml, 1923 ==Assessment== The tenor Michael Kelly, writing in his 1826 reminiscences, called Lange an \"excellent comedian\"; that is, player of comedy. Kelly had spent the early years of his career in Vienna as an opera singer. ==Lange's portraits of Mozart and family== Lange painted his famous portrait of his brother-in-law in 1782/83.Deutsch 213 The following image is a detail of the portrait emphasizing Mozart's face: 300px The complete painting is shown in the next figure. 300px In March 2009 the musicologist Michael Lorenz was the first to realize that the painting originally was a miniature about 19 x 15 centimeters in size, showing only Mozart's face. It was later affixed to a larger canvas, apparently with the intention to portray Mozart seated at the piano, but the enlarged painting was never completed.Michael Lorenz: \"Joseph Lange's Mozart Portrait\", Vienna 2012 Constanze Mozart, interviewed in old age by Vincent and Mary Novello, said that Lange's portrait was \"by far the best likeness of him.\"Deutsch 1965, 538 Lange also painted a small portrait of Constanze in 1782 which was later enlarged: 300px During Leopold Mozart's visit to Vienna in 1785, Lange drew a portrait of him as well, but this is lost.Deutsch 1965, 241 He continued to paint into his old age.Constant von Wurzbach: \"Lange, Joseph\".
