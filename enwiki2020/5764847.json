    "text": "Yodlee is an American software company that develops an account aggregation service that allows users to see their credit card, bank, investment, email, travel reward accounts, etc. on one screen. In addition, Money by Envestnet Yodlee (formerly Yodlee Labs and Yodlee MoneyCenter), a free web application that helps consumers with their finances online, provides features such as bill payment, expense tracking, and investment management (similar to personal finance services provided by Intuit's Quicken). Yodlee's Privacy Policy FAQ references Yodlee as a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. Part of Yodlee's business model consists of selling its customer's financial transaction data to investors. In August 2015, Envestnet acquired Yodlee. As of 2013, Yodlee has over 45 million users, and over 150 financial institutions and portals (including 5 of the top 10 U.S. banks) offer services powered by Yodlee. Yodlee's aggregation engine powers several applications for partners, including websites like Money Dashboard, MoneyStrand, Thrive, and several large banks and financial institutions. In 2010, Yodlee partnered with Y Combinator, providing its financial services platforms to all Y Combinator- funded companies. ==Origins and history== Yodlee was started in 1999 by Venkat Rangan (vice chancellor of Amrita University), Sam Inala, Ramakrishna \"Schwark\" Satyavolu, Srihari Sampath Kumar (all formerly at Microsoft), and Sukhinder Singh (earlier at Amazon.com and Junglee). Yodlee started operations (and is headquartered) in Redwood Shores, California. It also has offices in London, UK, and Bangalore, India. In 2000, Yodlee merged with its main competitor in the data aggregation space, an Atlanta-based company called VerticalOne, which was owned at the time by SecurityFirst, an internet banking firm. By 2010 Yodlee was said to have raised at least $116 million over its 10-year lifespan. In a press release in June 2008, it was announced that Bank of America led a $35 million financing and existing Yodlee investors, including its largest shareholder Warburg Pincus along with Accel Partners and Institutional Venture Partners participated in the financing round. On October 3, 2014, Yodlee went public on NASDAQ, trading under the symbol YDLE. It raised $75 million at $12/share. On August 10, 2015 Yodlee sold itself to Envestnet for a reported $660 Million. As a result, it is no longer listed on the NASDAQ. In November 2017 Token partnered with Yodlee for payments and financial data aggregation. ==References == == External links == * Category:Online financial services companies of the United States Category:Financial technology companies Category:Account aggregation providers Category:Companies based in Redwood Shores, California Category:Private equity portfolio companies Category:Warburg Pincus companies Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Software companies of the United States Category:Financial services companies established in 1999 Category:Software companies established in 1999 Category:2014 initial public offerings Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions Category:1999 establishments in California ",
