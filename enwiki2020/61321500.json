Key results of his research include the following: * Finding intergenerational economic mobility to vary substantially across the United States, Kline, Emmanuel Saez, Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren identify (i) residential segregation, (ii) income inequality, (iii) low primary school quality, (iv) low social capital, and (v) low family stability as key characteristics of areas with low mobility.Chetty, R. et al. (2014). Where is the land of opportunity? The geography of intergenerational mobility in the United States. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(4), pp. 1553-1623. Overall, while they conclude that mobility has remained stable over time, they highlight that some areas in the U.S. have persistently offered less mobility than most other developed countries.Chetty, R. et al. (2013). Is the United States still a land of opportunity? Recent trends in intergenerational mobility. American Economic Review: Papers & Proceedings, 104(5), pp. 141\u2013147. * Kline, David Card and J\u00f6rg Heining argue that the rise in West German wage inequality is due to a combination of growing differences between workers, stronger dispersion between the wage premia paid by different firms, and an increased tendency of high-ability workers to sort into high- premium paying establishments.Card, D., Heining, J., Kline, P. (2013). Workplace heterogeneity and the rise of West German wage inequality. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 128(3), pp. 967\u20131015. In further work on wage inequality with Card and Ana Rute Cardoso, Kline finds evidence that gender differences in terms of workplace bargaining and sorting \u2013 e.g. men sorting themselves into firms with higher wage premia and women earning smaller wage premia than men within the same firm \u2013 account for about 20% of the gender wage gap in Portugal.Card, D., Cardoso, A.R., Kline, P. (2015). Bargaining, sorting, and the gender wage gap: Quantifying the impact of firms on the relative pay of women. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131(2), pp. 633\u2013686. Along with Heining, they further argue that firm-level drivers of wage inequality can be explained through workers' individual tastes for different workplaces.Card, D. et al. (2018). Firms and labor market inequality: Evidence and some theory. Journal of Labor Economics, 36(S1), pp. S13\u2013S70. * Evaluating a programme of U.S. empowerment zones (EZ), Kline, Mathias Busso and Jesse Gregory find that EZ designation substantially raised employment and real wages in zone neighborhoods at modest efficiency costs.Busso, M., Gregory, J., Kline, P. (2013). Assessing the incidence and efficiency of a prominent place based policy. American Economic Review, 103(2), pp. 897\u2013947. In another example of a local economic development programme, together with Enrico Moretti, Kline studies the impact of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); they find that the programme helped foster infrastructure improvements that yielded long-growing gains in manufacturing employment and raised U.S. manufacturing productivity though local agglomeration gains seem to cancel out with losses in the rest of the U.S.Kline, P., Moretti, E. (2013). Local economic development, agglomeration economies, and the Big Push: 100 years of evidence from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(1), pp. 275\u2013331. Overall, Kline and Moretti have argued that \"place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities\".Kline, P., Moretti, E. (2014). People, places, and public policy: Some simple welfare economics of local economic development programs. Annual Review of Economics, 6, pp. 629\u2013662. == Honours and awards== * W.E.
