    "text": "The left coronary artery (abbreviated LCA) is an artery that arises from the aorta above the left cusp of the aortic valve and feeds blood to the left side of the heart. It is also known as the left main coronary artery (abbreviated LMCA) and the left main stem coronary artery (abbreviated LMS). It is one of the coronary arteries. ==Branching== It typically runs for 10 to 25 mm and then bifurcates into the anterior interventricular artery (also called the left anterior descending (LAD) and the Widow maker) and the left circumflex artery (LCx). Sometimes an additional artery arises at the bifurcation of the left main artery, forming a trifurcation; this extra artery is called the ramus or intermediate artery. The part that is between the aorta and the bifurcation only is known as the left main artery (LM), while the term \"LCA\" might refer to just the left main, or to the left main and all its eventual branches. A \"first septal branch\" is sometimes described. ==Additional images== File:Coronary arteries 1.jpg|Left coronary artery File:Cardiac vessels.png|Cardiac vessels File:Gray505.png|The aortic arch and its branches File:Gray506.svg|Diagram of the arch File:Human heart with coronary arteries new.png|Human heart with coronary arteries File:Heart left lateral coronaries diagram.svg|Heart left lateral coronaries diagram File:AMI scheme.png|Diagram of a myocardial infarction File:Ha1.jpg|A coronary angiogram that shows the LMCA, LAD, and LCX File:Aortic stenosis rotated.jpg|Autopsy specimen showing the coronary ostia and proximal segments of the coronary arteries.
