    "text": "Acid Reign are an English thrash metal band, originally active from 1985 to 1991. The band rebooted in 2015 with just H remaining from the original line up. Along with Onslaught, Sabbat and Xentrix, Acid Reign are considered to be one of the \"big four\" of British thrash metal. ==History== ===Initial career (1985\u20131991)=== Acid Reign were formed by drummer and keyboardist Mark Ramsey Wharton , bassist Ian Gangwer (originally Peter Warriner), singer Howard \"H\" Smith , and future Cathedral member, guitarist Gary \"Gaz\" Jennings. In 1987, the band released the Moshkinstein demo. On the strength of this recording, they were picked up by British thrash metal label Under One Flag (a subsidiary of Music for Nations) in 1988 who released the Moshkinstein EP. Following this release, Jennings was replaced by another future Cathedral member, Adam Lehan (formerly of Lord Crucifier), and the band gained support slots opening for such acts as Flotsam and Jetsam and Death Angel. Acid Reign struck up a friendship with label mates Nuclear Assault and Exodus, and toured the UK and Europe as support to the Survive and Fabulous Disaster tours. The band released their debut album, The Fear, in 1989. In support of the album, Acid Reign toured with Nuclear Assault again in 1989 across Europe with Dark Angel and Candlemass, with bassist Ian \"Mac\" MacDonald replacing Gangwer. Their second album, Obnoxious, arrived in 1990 to generally poor reviews. ===Post- split (1991\u20132014)=== Acid Reign broke up in 1991 after parting ways with Music For Nations. They played their final show at the London Marquee Club. In January 2014, H started the world's only comedy/Heavy Metal podcast called \"Talking Bollocks\" for the UK metal webzine All About The Rock. On 30 November 2014, Acid Reign frontman H told UK Heavy Metal website All About The Rock \"I tried to put the old line up back together but Adam and Ramsey were unable to do it for differing reasons. That news came this time last year and it looked like that was that as Kev isn\u2019t able to commit to anything as he\u2019s constantly on the road, although he has an open invitation to join us when he\u2019s not, that\u2019s a given. Then, in the summer, I started toying with the idea of a new line up and it came together quite quickly. We\u2019re taking it slowly, learning the old stuff and playing with new ideas too. It\u2019s not a reformation it\u2019s a reboot. Even if it was the old line up it would be different, it\u2019s been 24 years! The main thing is that the goodwill toward Acid Reign has never been stronger, everywhere I go people are saying we should come back and eventually I actually fucking listened! We\u2019ll make an \u201cofficial\u201d announcement when we\u2019re ready and have plans but for now it is just have a merry Xmas and an Obnoxious New Year.\" ===Reboot (2015\u2013present)=== On 5 May 2015, Acid Reign announced on their Facebook page that they had reformed. Frontman Howard \"H\" Smith, who is the only original member of Acid Reign involved in the reboot, commented, \"Finally the rebooted line up is complete, it's taken nearly two years but I can honestly say it's been worth the wait. Typically we're doing things differently to everyone else as where they reformed (and believe me we tried) we are now rebooting. Everyone in the band has Acid Reign in their DNA, some of the guys knew the band back in the day and some didn't but everyone is on the same page and we can't wait to get out there and show the world how much it has been missing us.\" Two months later, Acid Reign released their first song in 25 years, \"Plan of the Damned\", via streaming platforms. On 27 September 2019 the band released their first full-length studio album in 29 years, The Age of Entitlement, via Dissonance Productions to worldwide critical and fan acclaim. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *The Fear (album, 1989) (UK Indie No. 10) *Obnoxious (album, 1990) *The Worst of Acid Reign (compilation, 1991) *The Apple Core Archives (Box Set, 2014) *The Age of Entitlement (album, 2019) ===Singles, EPs and mini albums=== *Moshkinstein (Mini Album, 1988) *Humanoia (EP) *Hanging on the Telephone (single) *\"Plan Of The Damned\" (Single) 2015 *\"The Man Who Became Himself\" (Single) 2017 ==Band members== ===Current members=== *Howard \"H\" Smith \u2013 vocals (1985\u20131991, 2013\u2013present) *Cooky \u2013 guitar (2015\u2013present) *Paul Chanter \u2013 guitar (2013\u2013present) *Pete Dee \u2013 bass (2015\u2013present) *Marc Jackson \u2013 drums (2014\u2013present) ===Former members=== *Mark Ramsey Wharton \u2013 drums, keyboards (1985\u20131991) *Garry Jennings \u2013 guitar (1985\u20131988) *Ian Gangwer \u2013 bass (1985\u20131988) *Kevin \"Kev\" Papworth \u2013 guitar (1987\u20131991) *Adam Lehan \u2013 guitar (1988\u20131990) *Ian \"Mac\" MacDonald \u2013 bass (1988\u20131991) ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1991 Category:Music and politics Category:English thrash metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Harrogate Category:1985 establishments in England Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2015 ",
