The album includes features from Lecrae, Andy Mineo, and This'l among others. Four singles were released for the album; \"Shweet\", \"Sweet Victory\", \"Manolo\" and \"Beautiful Life 2 (Mine)\". ==Concept== Trip Lee explained the concept of the album saying that; \"It's a call-to-action to rise from the dead and actually live. We're born spiritually dead, and I'm calling for everyone to become spiritually alive. Secondly, don't wait until later to live the way you were created. God created you to honor Him, find joy, and serve others. Don't sleep on that. Lastly, rise above the low expectations people have.\"http://www.breathecast.com/articles/trip- lees-rise-1-gospel-album-u-s-rappers-shweet-21524/ ==Promotion== In promotion of the album Reach Records held two listening sessions in New York City and Atlanta.http://www.breathecast.com/articles/trip-lee-showcases-new-album-rise- in-new-york-city-listening-party-receives-rave-reviews-exclusive-20096/ Tickets went on sale and were held on September 23 and October 3 respectively.http://instagram.com/p/tJLgG6KAfv/ In late December 2014, Gawvi, who produced the album, released two remixes of songs from the Rise album, one of \"Lazarus\" and another of \"Sweet Victory\" for free on SoundCloud.
