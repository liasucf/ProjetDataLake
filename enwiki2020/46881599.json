Umpherston was born in Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland, and worked as a farmer until he emigrated to South Australia on the Ariadne, arriving in August 1839. He worked for several years as a contractor to established farmers until he had saved enough to start farming for himself at Brown Hill Creek, then at Smithfield, where he prospered. He next took up land at Attamurra, north-east of Mount Gambier, naming his property \"Cadzow\", later owned by John Kennedy. He sold up there and moved to the Myora Estate, east of Mount Gambier, which he sold to W. A. Crouch in 1875. Finally he moved to \"The Caves\", where he remained, turning it into a showpiece and model farm. \"The Caves\" was later owned by Joseph Botterill MLC. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Victoria in December 1866 at the by-election brought about by the resignation of Adam Lindsay Gordon, with John Riddoch of Yallum as colleague, and retired in May 1868, succeeded by Henry Kent Hughes.
