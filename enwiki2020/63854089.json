He is the owner of the Nethercutt Collection and holds 5 best of show victories at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, more than any other competitor. == Early life == Nethercutt was born on December 22nd, 1936, the son to entrepreneur J.B. Nethercutt and Dorothy Sykes in Los Angeles, California. He attended the Harvard-Westlake School. Nethercutt would later graduate from the University of Southern California in 1958. == Racing career == Nethercutt entered auto racing in the late 1950s, notably finishing 3rd at the 1960 12 Hours of Sebring with Pete Lovely and 3rd at the 1960 USAC Road Racing Championship, behind Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. He competed a wide variety of races, earning several victories in 1960, 1961, and 1962, mostly with his Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa. He competed in the Sports Car Club of America and achieved dozens of top 5 finishes, including a victory at the 1962 SCCA Divisional. Nethercutt also competed in the United States Grand Prix. Nethercutt used a wide variety of vehicles and numbers, most notably using 102. In 1965, Nethercutt himself would build his custom racecar, The \"Mirage\". The car was known for its strikingly beautiful but late design. Experts agree if the Mirage was built just a couple of years earlier, it would have been internationally competitive. The Mirage was test driven by British racer and Motorsports Hall of Fame of America inductee Ken Miles. === 12 Hours of Sebring results === alt= {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" !Year !Class !No !Car !Co-Drivers !Laps !Pos. !Class Pos. |- !1960 | align=\"left\" |S3.0 | align=\"left\" |8 | align=\"left\" |Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa 59 Ferrari V12 2996 | Pete Lovely |186 | style=\"background:#FFDF9F;\" |3rd | style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\" |1st |- !1961 | align=\"left\" |S3.0 | align=\"left\" |9 | align=\"left\" |Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa 59 Ferrari V12 2996 | Pete Lovely |1 | colspan=\"2\" |DNF Oil Pump |} === USAC Road Racing Championship results === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Season !No !Series !Car !Laps !Position |- |1959 |102 |USAC Championship Pomona |Ferrari 500 |69 |style=\"text-align:center; |12th |- |1960 |102 |USAC Championship Riverside |Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa |62 | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FFDF9F;\" |3rd |} === Overall results === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"5\" | Jack Nethercutt |- !Vehicle !Number(s) !Years Active !Win(s) !Top 5 |- !Lotus Eleven |102 |1957-1958 |0 |11 |- !Ferrari 500 |102 |1958-1960 |0 |5 |- !Ferrari 250 TR |8, 9, 102 |1960-1961 |3 |10 |- !Lotus 19 |102 |1961-1964 |1 |5 |- !Mirage |102 |1965 |0 |0 |- !Total | | |4 |31 |} == Business career == Nethercutt was the Vice president of Merle Norman Cosmetics Inc. under his father.
