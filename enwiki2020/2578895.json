    "text": "Detail of border of a kahu kiwi made using t\u0101niko T\u0101niko (or taaniko) is a traditional weaving technique of the M\u0101ori of New Zealand related to \"twining\". It may also refer to the resulting bands of weaving, or to the traditional designs. The t\u0101niko technique does not require a loom, although one can be used. Traditionally free hanging warps were suspended between two weaving pegs and the process involved twining downward. The traditional weaving material is muka, fibre prepared from the New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) by scraping, pounding and washing. The muka fibre was dyed using natural dyes. There has been a resurgence of t\u0101niko and other M\u0101ori cultural practices starting in the 1950s and as part of the broader M\u0101ori Renaissance. This has led to t\u0101niko practitioners Diggeress Te Kanawa and her mother Dame Rangim\u0101rie Hetet receiving honorary doctorates from the University of Waikato. ==Bibliography== *\"Te Whatu Taaniko: Taaniko Weaving\", Sidney M.
