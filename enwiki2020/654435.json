    "text": "Gu\u00e1nica () is a town and municipality in southern Puerto Rico, bordering the Caribbean Sea, south of Sabana Grande, east of Lajas, and west of Yauco. It is part of the Yauco metropolitan statistical area. The town of Gu\u00e1nica, also known as Pueblo de Gu\u00e1nica, is the principal town of the municipality. The town's population in 2000 was 9,247 people among 3,808 housing units over a land area of . The town is located on a deeply indented harbor of the same name. The harbor resembles a tropical fjord, narrow and bordered by rugged hills, barely a quarter-mile wide, but about from mouth to the town. The town is about and over two hours' driving distance from San Juan, the capital city of the island, and about west of Ponce, another principal city of the island. Gu\u00e1nica's postal ZIP Code is 00653 and telephone area codes are 787 and 939. The urban area of Ensenada has a separate postal ZIP Code of 00647. ==History== ===Settlement=== American troops landing at Gu\u00e1nica in 1898, by Howard Chandler Christy Juan Ponce de Leon landed in the Gu\u00e1nica harbor on August 12, 1508 and founded a town called Guayn\u00eda, a word derived from the Ta\u00edno indigenous culture that possibly meant \"Here is a place with water\". The town, considered the capital of the island of Puerto Rico (which was at that time named Isla de San Juan Bautista), was destroyed during the indigenous uprising of 1511, and the area was abandoned by Europeans for some years, during which time San Juan (itself at first called Puerto Rico) became the capital of the island. The United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Gu\u00e1nica barrio was 2,700. The refounded town of Gu\u00e1nica was at first a barrio of the municipality of Yauco until Gu\u00e1nica was established as a separate municipality on March 13, 1914. V\u00edctor \u00c1ngel Sallaberry Safini was Gu\u00e1nica's first mayor. ===Invasion=== Gloucester landing team On July 25, 1898, American forces (who included the young poet-writer Carl Sandburg led by General Nelson A. Miles) landed in Gu\u00e1nica as part of the course of the Puerto Rican Campaign in the Spanish\u2013American War. This invasion led to Puerto Rico being acquired by the United States. The invasion, just one small part of the war between Spain and United States, occurred in Gu\u00e1nica due to its sheltered harbor and proximity to Ponce, besides being such an unexpected site for such an attack, which had been anticipated at the heavily fortified city of San Juan. The Gloucester was the first ship to set anchor in the Bay of Gu\u00e1nica. Twenty-eight sailors and Marines, under the command of lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, departed from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco. The invasion is commemorated by a contentious monument on the waterfront: along a broad paseo (el malec\u00f3n), there is a large coral boulder marked by the carved words, \"3rd Battalion, 1st U.S.V. Engineers, September 16, 1898.\" July 25 was subsequently commemorated in Puerto Rico as Occupation Day, later renamed Constitution Day (see Public holidays in Puerto Rico). ===Today=== Rock in Gu\u00e1nica which indicates where Major General Nelson A. Miles and his men landed Gu\u00e1nica is a modern town that maintains roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as el pueblo de la amistad ('the town of friendship'), it is also occasionally referred to as el pueblo de las doce calles ('the town of the twelve streets'). The central part of town consists of five streets running north\u2013south crossing seven other streets that run east\u2013west, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, one of which is the town plaza. Facing the plaza is the Catholic Church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a music stand. In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort Capr\u00f3n. Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of Central Gu\u00e1nica. The resort chain known as Club Med once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town, but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some of land, including of beach, have been intermittently for sale. It is a fishing village; commercial fishermen still ply their traditional trade beyond the harbor entrance. Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa offers beach access and a short boat ride to Giligan Island, which is a great spot to go snorkeling. The water is crystal clear and shallow, in which old pieces of coral and fish can be seen. People can walk from one island to another. On January 6, 2020, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake was felt in Gu\u00e1nica and nearby municipalities, and several residences and cars were destroyed. On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit. ==Geography== Guayac\u00e1n Centenario Gu\u00e1nica has mountains and a forest. The Gu\u00e1nica State Forest (Bosque Estatal de Gu\u00e1nica) is also the name of a small dry forest reserve east and west of the town, the largest remaining tract of tropical dry coastal forest in the world, and designated an international Biosphere Reserve in 1981. The park comprising much of the dry forest is known as el Bosque Seco de Gu\u00e1nica. Highway Route 116, the nearest principal road, heads west toward Lajas and east toward Ponce, passing through the island of Puerto Rico's driest area. The largely intact forest of the Gu\u00e1nica Dry Forest reserve hosts the greatest number of bird species found on the island, including several bird species seldom found anywhere else: the Puerto Rican lizard cuckoo, Puerto Rican woodpecker, the Puerto Rican nightjar, and the Puerto Rican emerald hummingbird. Other animals thought to be extinct in Puerto Rico have turned up in this forest. Many different types of cactus grow here, a stunning contrast to the lush Caribbean National Forest in the northeast part of the island, which is a tropical rainforest. The contrast is due to the mountain ridge Cordillera Central which separates Gu\u00e1nica from the northeast part of the island; while the northeast receives over of precipitation each year, Gu\u00e1nica receives less than 30, and some regions of the forest reserve are said to receive only six inches. The forest reserve of some contains of trails through four different forest types: deciduous trees, a coastal region with tree-size milkweed and prickly pear cactus, a mahogany forest, and twisted gumbo limbo trees. There are about 700 varieties of plants, including aroma (acacia) and guayacan (lignum vitae\u2014Latin for 'wood of life'). One guayacan is about 500\u2013700 years old. The squat melon cactus and other cacti can be found here along with 40 species of birds, including the guabairo (Puerto Rican nightjar), found nowhere else. Also in the area are a crested toad (Peltophryne lemur) and, sometimes on the beaches, green and leatherback turtles, though their eggs suffer severe predation from mongooses one time introduced to fight rats in sugar cane fields. ===Barrios=== Subdivisions of Gu\u00e1nica Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Gu\u00e1nica is subdivided into barrios.
