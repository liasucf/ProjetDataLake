    "text": "The Mercedes-Benz O405 was a highly successful single-decker bus manufactured by Mercedes-Benz from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s as either an integral bus or a bus chassis and was the last V\u00f6V SL-II standard bus in production. It was the replacement for the Mercedes-Benz O305 and was widely used in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore with 12,000 produced. ==Standard floor version== The step-entrance version was known as the O405. A 3-axle articulated version was also built known as O405G and a trolleybus as the O405T.The Mercedes-Benz O405 Range Buses Worldwide issue 214 July 2019 pages 30-33 There were two generations of O405, designated as O405 MkI and O405 MkII. Most of them have their boxy roof dome (slightly arched) with a double- curvature windscreen, separately mounted destination indicator and pantograph system windshield wipers that was used on some buses such as the Dennis Dart, Leyland Lynx, MAN NL262 and the MAN SL202. ===O405 Mark I=== The O405 Mark I was marketed between mid-1980s and early 1990s. It was unveiled in September 1983. It featured a Mercedes Benz OM447h naturally aspirated engine with outputs of either 157kW (210hp) or 184 kW (250 hp). Optionally available was a naturally aspirated compressed natural gas (CNG) engine model M447hG with 150 kW (205 hp) output. The gearbox coupled to the engine was usually the Mercedes-Benz W3E110/2.2R or Mercedes-Benz W4E112/2.2R (the former being able to handle the more powerful 184 kW engine), although there have been other gearboxes such as the ZF 5HP 500 or Allison B300R coupled to the engine. ===O405 Mark II=== The O405 Mark II was marketed from the early 1990s to the late 1990s and into the early 2000s in some parts of the world. It featured a Mercedes-Benz OM447hA turbocharged engine with an output of 184 kW (250 hp), although some examples feature either a naturally aspirated engine (OM447h-II), a turbocharged engine (OM447hA) or a turbocharged, intercooled engine (OM447hLA). The gearbox coupled to the engine was either the ZF 4HP 500 or 5HP 500, or the Voith D864.3. From 1994, this chassis was available with the M447hG Euro II 175 kW (238 hp) naturally aspirated compressed natural gas (CNG) engine. ==Low-Floor Version: O405N== Travel Coventry integral O405N low floor in April 2007 The low-floor version of the regular O405 was known as the O405N (or O405GN for the 3-axle articulated version) was released in September 1989, later a further developed version was also built, it was known as the O405N\u00b2/O405N2 (or O405GN\u00b2/O405GN2 for the 3-axle articulated version). The O405(G)N do not have steps at the entrances and exits, but the seats are mounted on \"platforms\". The GN2 type addressed this problem. These buses are usually fitted with ZF transmissions, but some are fitted with Voith examples. It has a boxy roof dome (slightly arched) similar to the MAN NL202 and the MAN NL262 with a double-curvature windscreen with a separately mounted destination display just that it has a full low floor layout with seats mounted on platforms. ==Low-Entry Version: O405NH== Transperth Volgren bodied O405NH in October 2018 The low-entry version of the O405 was called the O405NH chassis which was produced by EvoBus for the Australian market. Much of its popularity with government and private operators alike can be attributed to the popularity of the Mercedes-Benz O405 MkII chassis that it replaced. The chassis was derived from a combination of the rear modules of an O405 MkII chassis and the front modules of an O405N\u00b2/O405GN\u00b2 chassis. Because of the difference in height between the front and rear modules of the chassis, there are one or more steps leading up from behind the centre door position to a standard O405 floorline. Because the chassis has a horizontally-mounted engine, there's no room for a rear door. This low-entry concept has become very popular in Europe - many integral products using this concept have been released such as the Mercedes-Benz Citaro LE. ==Suburban Version: O407== O407 integral The suburban version was called O407 (or O407G/O405G\u00dc for the 3-axle articulated version), It had a single door at the front and a pair in the middle, with all of the seats facing towards the front of the bus. It featured a Mercedes Benz OM447h naturally aspirated engine with output 177kW (237hp) and 6-speed manual Mercedes-Benz gearbox. ==Orders== ===Portugal=== * Camo U1001S * Camo Camus * Irm\u00e3os Mota Atomic UR95 and UR2000 * Marcopolo Tricana bodies ===Spain=== * Unicar * Hispano Carrocera * Castrosua ===United Kingdom=== First Greater Manchester Wright CityRider bodied O405 in Manchester in July 2007 A total of 365 O405s were built for operators in the United Kingdom, with Travel West Midlands purchasing 204.Mercedes-Benz O405 Bus Lists on the Web A sole O405Gs was bodied by Alexander for Grampian Regional Transport.Mercedes-Benz O405G / O405GN Bus Lists on the WebTop spec artic by Walter Alexander Commercial Motor 6 February 1992 page 16 A total of 204 O405Ns were built for operators in the United Kingdom, with Travel West Midlands purchasing 193.Mercedes-Benz O405N Bus Lists on the Web A total of 15 O405GNs were built for operators in the United Kingdom, with Travel West Midlands purchasing 11. ===Hong Kong=== Discovery Bay Transit Services of Hong Kong acquired four O405 single-decker buses between 1995 and 1998, two were fitted with locally-built bodywork by Asia Auto Body Works and the other two had Hispano Carrocera bodywork.Chan, C.

A few O405s were shipped to Thailand and were rebodied whereas the rest of them were scrapped; one unit, SBS468K, was converted into a \"Molly\" mobile library registered as XD2037B by the National Library Board but has since been replaced by an ex-SBS Transit Volvo B10M in 2012.
