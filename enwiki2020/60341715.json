At the age of seventeen, he went to Paris to study historical painting. He became a student of Paul Delaroche and collaborated with Charles-Philippe Larivi\u00e8re, a well known history painter. Then he assisted Jules-Claude Ziegler; helping him create paintings in the cupola of the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine. His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1835. Two years later, his canvases caught the attention of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix The following year found him working in Delacroix's studio, where he became the principal assistant and, later, the manager. One of his major projects involved assisting with the murals at the . By 1848, however, his relationship with Delacroix had soured and he is known to have complained to the art critic, Philippe Burty (who was editing Delacroix's letters) that he was tired of working in the shadows. At the Salon of 1850, his work Le Martyre des sept fr\u00e8res Macchab\u00e9es, or La Mort des Macchab\u00e9es, was purchased by the French government, further stoking his desire for independence. That same year, Delacroix was commissioned to paint murals at the \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice and chose Pierre Andrieu, another of his employees, as his chief assistant; citing an \"indisposition\" by Lassalle- Bordes.Jack J. Spector, The Murals of Eugene Delacroix at Saint-Sulpice, (online).

Embittered, he returned to his native province and settled permanently in Auch in 1853. There, he capitalized on his relationship with Delacroix and the rave reviews he had received from Charles Baudelaire at the 1846 Salon for his Death of Cleopatra. He served as a drawing teacher in the local schools for the rest of his life, although he received numerous commissions for work at churches and chateaux in the region. In 1854, he was hired to paint murals at the . The cur\u00e9, Joseph-Emmanuel de Vivie, is on record as having complained about how difficult it was to work with him. He participated in many regional exhibitions and, in 1865, he was awarded a commission to decorate the Ch\u00e2teau de Montbrun, in Cologne (which was being restored), with a series of mythological figures. This was followed by a series of portraits; of illustrious local citizens, to decorate the town halls in Auch, Lectoure and Condom.
