    "text": "The Gulf of Penas (English: Gulf of distress) is a body of water located south of the Taitao Peninsula, Chile. It is open to the westerly storms of the Pacific Ocean, but it affords entrance to several natural harbours. Among these are the gulfs of Tres Montes and San Esteban, and Tarn Bay at the entrance to Messier Channel. To the south of the gulf lies Guayaneco Archipelago and to the east lies San Javier Island and then the mainland. Spanish explorers and Jesuits that sailed south from Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago in the 17th and 18th centuries regularly avoided rounding the Taitao Peninsula by entering the gulf after a brief land crossing at the isthmus of Ofqui. In 1741, while attempting to pass through the Gulf of Penas, HMS Wager wrecked in a storm along the coast of what would become known as Wager Island of Guayaneco Archipelago. ==References== * Penas Penas Category:Landforms of Ays\u00e9n Region Category:Taitao Peninsula ",
