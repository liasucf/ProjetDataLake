    "text": "The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) is a Max Planck Institute whose research is aimed at investigating Einstein's theory of relativity and beyond: Mathematics, quantum gravity, astrophysical relativity, and gravitational-wave astronomy. The Institute was founded in 1995 and is located in the Potsdam Science Park in Golm, Potsdam and in Hannover where it is closely related to the Leibniz University Hannover. The Potsdam part of the institute is organized in three research departments, while the Hannover part has two departments. Both parts of the institute host a number of independent research groups. The institute conducts fundamental research in mathematics, data analysis, astrophysics and theoretical physics as well as research in laser physics, vacuum technology, vibration isolation and classical and quantum optics. When the LIGO Scientific Collaboration announced the first detection of gravitational waves, researchers of the institute were involved in modeling, detecting, analysing and characterising the signals. The Institute is part of a number of collaborations and projects: it is a main partner in the gravitational-wave detector GEO600; institute scientists are developing waveform-models that are applied in the gravitational-wave detectors for detecting and characterising gravitational waves. They are developing detector technology and are also analyzing data from the detectors of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration and the KAGRA Collaboration. They also play a leading role in planning and preparing the space-based detector LISA (planned launch date: 2034) and are involved in developing the third generation of earth-bound gravitational-wave detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer). The institute is also a major player in the Einstein@Home and PyCBC projects. The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam-Golm. The Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover. From 1998 to 2015, the institute has published the open access review journal Living Reviews in Relativity. == History == The newly founded institute started its work in April 1995 and has been located in Potsdam-Golm since 1999. In 2002 the Institute opened a branch at the Universit\u00e4t Hannover with a focus on data analysis and the development and operation of gravitational-wave detectors on Earth and in space. The Hannover institute originated from the Institute for Atom and Molecule Physics (AMP) of the Universit\u00e4t Hannover, which was established in 1979 by the Department of Physics. == Research == The research focus of the institute is in the field of general relativity. It covers theoretical and experimental gravitational physics, quantum gravity, multi- messenger astronomy and cosmology. The institute has a strong research focus on gravitational-wave astronomy: four out of five departments are working on different aspects of this research field. Central research topics are: * source modeling (binary neutron stars, binary black holes, mixed binaries, stellar core collapse) * experimental work on gravitational-wave detectors \u2013 both on Earth and in space * solving the two-body problem in general relativity * analytical and numerical solutions of Einstein's equations * development and implementation of data analysis algorithms for gravitational- wave searches * follow-up analyses to infer properties of the gravitational- wave sources All these efforts enable a new kind of astronomy, which began with the first direct detection of gravitational waves on Earth. Scientists of the institute also work towards the unification of the fundamental theories of physics \u2013 general relativity and quantum mechanics \u2013 into a theory of quantum gravity. == Departments == * Alessandra Buonanno\u2019s Astrophysical and Cosmological Relativity department at AEI Potsdam solves the two-body problem in general relativity analytically and numerically, and predicts gravitational signals emitted by binary systems composed of black holes and neutron stars. Members of the department use those waveform models to infer astrophysical and cosmological information, and carry out tests of general relativity, using data from gravitational-wave detectors. *Masaru Shibata\u2019s Computational Relativistic Astrophysics department at AEI Potsdam studies mergers of black holes or neutron stars and the collapse of stellar cores. The department also works on more fundamental aspects of general relativity with numerical tools. *The Quantum Gravity and Unified Theories department (acting director since August 2020: Alessandra Buonanno) at AEI Potsdam works on the development of a quantum theory of gravity, based on conformal field theory, string theory, and supergravity and symmetries. *The research focus of Karsten Danzmann\u2019s department Laser Interferometry and Gravitational Wave Astronomy at AEI Hannover is on the development and operation of gravitational-wave detectors on Earth and in space. This includes laboratory experiments in quantum optics and laser physics. *Bruce Allen\u2019s department Observational Relativity and Cosmology at AEI Hannover studies observational consequences of general relativity, including the search for and analysis of gravitational-wave signals in data from ground-based detectors, and the operation of the Einstein@Home project. The department also works on searches for gamma-ray and radio pulsars, and on theoretical aspects of black holes. == Directors == * Bruce Allen (AEI Hannover, 2007-present), deputy managing director * Alessandra Buonanno (AEI Potsdam, 2014-present), managing director * Karsten Danzmann (AEI Hannover, 2002-present) * J\u00fcrgen Ehlers (AEI Potsdam, founding director, 1995-1998) * Gerhard Huisken (AEI Potsdam, 2002-2013) * Hermann Nicolai (AEI Potsdam, 1997-2020) * Bernard F.
