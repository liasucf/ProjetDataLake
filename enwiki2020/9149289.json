    "text": "\"Vibeology\" was the fourth single released worldwide from Paula Abdul's Spellbound album. The song was written by Peter Lord, Sandra St. Victor and V. Jeffrey Smith. It was released as the third single from the album in Australia and the UK, and as the fourth single in North America. \"Vibeology\" was first released as a single in November 1991 in Australia, followed by a European and North American release in January 1992. \"Vibeology\" peaked at number 63 in Australia in December 1991, and at number 19 in the UK in January 1992. The single reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1992, becoming Abdul's first single to peak outside the top 10 in the US since the original release of \"(It's Just) The Way That You Love Me\" in 1988. It achieved a similar level of success on the Billboard dance chart. ==Background== Originally, Virgin Records had intended to release \"Vibeology\" as the third single from Spellbound following Abdul's performance of the song at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards; however, it was cancelled in favor of \"Blowing Kisses in the Wind\" which was receiving airplay at the time, creating demand for the song.https://ew.com/article/1991/10/04/paula-abduls-vibeology/ == Track listings and formats == ; US 12\" record # Vibeology - Keith Cohen's House Mix (Peter Lord; Sandra St. Victor; V.
