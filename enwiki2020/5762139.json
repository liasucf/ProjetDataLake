The title winning side featured two English players enjoying their first season north of the border - defender Terry Butcher and goalkeeper Chris Woods. Celtic manager David Hay paid the price for a trophyless season and was sacked after four years, paving the way for the return of Billy McNeill, the man he had succeeded in 1983. Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson moved south of the border on 6 November to manage Manchester United. He was succeeded at Pittodrie by Ian Porterfield. At the end of the season, Ferguson brought Celtic's top scorer Brian McClair to United, while McClair's strike-partner Mo Johnston moved to France to sign for Nantes. St Mirren won the Scottish Cup with a 1\u20130 win over Dundee United in the final. Dundee United also lost to IFK Goteborg of Sweden in the UEFA Cup final. ==Scottish Premier Division== Champions: Rangers Relegated: Clydebank, Hamilton Academical ==Scottish League Division One== Promoted: Morton, Dunfermline Athletic Relegated: Brechin City, Montrose ==Scottish League Division Two== Promoted: Meadowbank Thistle, Raith Rovers ==Other honours== ===Cup honours=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=140|Competition !width=135|Winner !width=80|Score !width=135|Runner-up |- |align=left|Scottish Cup 1986\u201387 |St Mirren |1 \u2013 0 |Dundee United |- |align=left|League Cup 1986\u201387 |Rangers |2 \u2013 1 |Celtic |- |align=left|Youth Cup |Celtic |2 \u2013 1 |Motherwell |- |align=left|Junior Cup |Auchinleck Talbot |1 \u2013 0 (rep.) |Kilbirnie Ladeside |} ===Non-league honours=== ====Senior==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=180|Competition !width=140|Winner |- |Highland League 1986\u201387 |Inverness Thistle |- |East of Scotland League |Vale of Leithen |- |South of Scotland League |Annan Athletic |} ===Individual honours=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=170|Award ! width=150|Winner ! width=140|Club |- | Footballer of the Year || Brian McClair || Celtic |- |Players' Player of the Year || Brian McClair || Celtic |- |Young Player of the Year || Robert Fleck || Rangers |} ==Scotland national team== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Venue !Opponents ! !Competition !Scotland scorer(s) |-bgcolor=#ffffdd |10 September |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|0\u20130 |ECQG7 | |-bgcolor=#ffffdd |15 October |Lansdowne Road, Dublin (A) | |align=center|0\u20130 |ECQG7 | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |12 November |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|3\u20130 |ECQG7 |Davie Cooper (2, 1 pen.), Maurice Johnston |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |18 February |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|0\u20131 |ECQG7 | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |1 April |Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, Brussels (A) | |align=center|1\u20134 |ECQG7 |Paul McStay |-bgcolor=#ffffdd |23 May |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|0\u20130 |Rous Cup | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |26 May |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|0\u20132 |Rous Cup | |} Key: *(H) = Home match *(A) = Away match *ECQG7 = European Championship qualifying - Group 7 ==See also== 1986\u201387 Aberdeen F.C. season 1986\u201387 Dundee United F.C. season ==Notes and references== Category:Seasons in Scottish football ",
