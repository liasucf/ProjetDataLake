    "text": "\"You're the One That I Want\" is a song performed by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John for the 1978 film version of the musical Grease. It was written and produced by John Farrar. \"You're the One That I Want\" is one of the best- selling singles in history, having sold over 6 million copies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France alone, with estimates of more than 15 million copies sold overall. * ==Background== \"You're the One That I Want\" was one of the two singles, along with \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\", that Farrar wrote specifically for Newton-John's appearance in the film that had not been in the original stage musical. Randal Kleiser, the film's director, was not fond of this song because he felt that it did not mesh well with the rest of the Warren Casey-Jim Jacobs score. ==Synopsis== Danny Zuko (Travolta), leader of the T-Birds, has recently lettered in cross-country running in an effort to win back his estranged girlfriend Sandy Olsson (Newton-John); unbeknownst to him, Sandy, who has been conflicted about her upright and proper etiquette in a school full of brash greasers, has herself transformed into a greaser queen to win back Danny. In the song, Danny expresses pleasant shock and arousal at Sandy's transformation, with Sandy responding that Danny must \"shape up\" to prove himself capable of treating Sandy the right way. The song originally written at this point in the original musical, \"All Choked Up\", was similar in theme, but different in style, written as a pastiche of Elvis Presley's \"All Shook Up\" and with Sandy being more provocative. \"All Choked Up\" was one of two songs from the Jacobs/Casey score that was excised completely from both the film and the film's soundtrack. Most 21st-century performances of the musical also include \"You're the One That I Want\" instead of \"All Choked Up\". ==Chart history== Upon its release in conjunction with the film (and its status as a potential blockbuster worldwide), the single became a huge international hit, reaching number 1 in several countries. In the United States, the single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100Bronson, Fred (2003). The Billboard Book of #1 Hits, 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 484. and on July 18 was certified Platinum for shipments exceeding 2 million copies. (It was already Gold by April 12.) It also topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks in the summer of 1978, some months before the film had even been released in that country. As of 2018, it is still the fifth best-selling single of all time in the United Kingdom, where it has sold two million copies. In Australia, the single spent nine nonconsecutive weeks at the top and became the best charting single of the year. Had Boney M's \"Rivers of Babylon\" not spent six weeks at number one in the intervening period, when \"You're the One That I Want\" was hovering at number two, the smash hit from Grease would have spent 15 weeks at number one in Australia, outdoing the longest stay at number one in Australian chart history, \"Fernando\" by ABBA, which clocked up 14 weeks at the top in 1976. ==The 1998 're-release'== A re-released \"Martian remix\" of the single by PolyGram Records reached #4 in the United Kingdom and #27 in Australia in 1998, the twentieth anniversary of the film's debut. ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1978) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |- |- |Canadian Top Singles (RPM) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |European Hot 100 (Billboard) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Finland |style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |- |Ireland |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Italy |style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |Japan Oricon Singles Chart |style=\"text- align:center;\"|25 |- |- |- |- |South Africa (Springbok Radio) |align=\"center\"|2 |- |- |- |- |- |- |U.S. Radio & Records CHR/Pop Airplay Chart |align=\"center\"|3 |- |U.S. Cash Box Top 100 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1998) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Ireland |style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1978) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Australia David Kent's \"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |- |align=\"left\"|Italy |align=\"center\"|12 |- |New Zealand | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |South Africa |align=\"center\"|17 |- |U.K. | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|13 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |} ===Sales and certifications=== ==Cover versions== British comedians Arthur Mullard and Hylda Baker also released a version of the song in 1978.
