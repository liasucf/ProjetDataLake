He wrote in Czech and Latin. He was a historian of the Hussite movement. His works are usually regarded as more or less reliable. ==Life== Place and date of birth, and death are not known (date of birth around 1370,Marcela K. Perett Preachers, Partisans, and Rebellious Religion pp. 193 last documented day of his life is 6 July 1437.) He was a lower nobelman. He studied at Prague University where he gained his bachelor's degree in 1389 and master's degree in 1394. In 1391,Marcela K. Perett Preachers, Partisans, and Rebellious Religion pp. 193 he was ordained by Pope Boniface IX, at an uncanonical age of twenty, and consequently on 17 May 1391 pope assigned him to the parish of Louny. In the nineties of the 14th he started his service at the side of the king Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia (probably until his death in 1419). He was also a supporter of the Hussites. He was an opponent of Sigismund Korybut and therefore forced to leave Prague in 1427. Around that year he translated the Prague Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto privilegia, which were abolished in 1434. During the request for the reinstitution of the emperor (1436) these privileges were reinstated thanks to the testimony of Vav\u0159inec. ==Work== * Song about the victory in Doma\u017elice(modern name), original Carmen insignis Coronae Bohemiae pro tropheo sibi divinitus concesso circa Ryzmberg et Domazlic, a Latin poem about the Battle of Doma\u017elice, which happened on 14 August, 1431 and during which a part of participants of the 4th Crusade allegedly fled before they have even the Hussite army. * Historia Hussitica \u2013 Latin chronicle about the Hussite movement, author is writing from the perspective of Prague Hussites. He wrote against Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor but also against the radical Hussites. The unfinished chronicle depicts the period between the years 1414 and 1422, the biggest importance is given to the period 1419\u2013142. This politically and factographically comprehensive work is the longest source for knowledge about the early phase of the Hussite movement and one of the most significant literary works of the Hussite movement. He was also a translator, his translations are usually deemed of high quality. He translated mostly during the time when he worked in the court, where he e.g. translated the so-called Travels of Sir John Mandeville. Authorship of so-called Budy\u0161\u00ednsk\u00fd rukopis is wrongly attributed to him. He also translated Somniarium Slaidae from Latin, which itself was itself a translation of an eight-century Arabic treatise by Muhamed ben Sirin.Marcela K.
