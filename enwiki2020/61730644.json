He was named in the Indian contingent for the 2018 Commonwealth Games but had to pull out 10 days before the April event after being diagnosed with appendicitis. Following an emergency appendix surgery, he was placed on a liquid diet, which resulted in significant weight loss and an inability to walk properly. Two months later, he participated in the 2018 Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Gifu despite having \"less strength, speed and focus\" from before the illness and won bronze with a jump of 7.47 metres. At the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, he \"struggled with run-up issues\" and finished sixth in the final with 7.95 metres. In September 2018, Sreeshankar broke the national record at the National Open Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar where he achieved a jump of 8.20 metres. It was also the world leading jump of the season among under-20 athletes and made him the first Indian athlete to qualify for the 2019 World Athletics Championships scheduled to be held in September\u2013October in Doha. ==Personal life== Sreeshankar was a state-level under-10 champion in 50 metres and 100 metres, but switched from sprinting to long jump at the age of 13. He is coached by his father S. Murali who is a former triple jump athlete and silver medalist at the South Asian Games. His mother K. S. Bijimol had won silver medal in 800 metres at the 1992 Asian Junior Athletics Championships. His sister Sreeparvathy is a heptathlete.
