    "text": "Jordan Gill (born 1 July 1994) is an English professional boxer who held the Commonwealth featherweight title in 2018. ==Professional career== Gill made his professional debut on 7 July 2012, scoring a four-round points decision (PTS) victory against Kristian Laight at the Sheffield Arena. After compiling a record of 21\u20130 (5 KOs), he challenged Commonwealth featherweight champion, Ryan Doyle, on 27 October 2018 at the Copper Box Arena in London. Gill dropped the champion to the canvas in the seventh round with body shots. Doyle was able to beat the referee's count of ten, only to be met with a barrage of punches, prompting referee Victor Laughlin to call a halt to the contest, awarding Gill a seventh-round technical knockout (TKO) victory to become the new Commonwealth champion. After Gill vacated his Commonwealth title in early 2019, he faced Emmanuel Dominguez for the vacant WBA International featherweight title on 2 March 2019 at the East of England Arena in Peterborough. In an early night for Gill, he dropped his opponent twice in the third round in quick succession before forcing the referee to halt the contest after trapping Dominguez against the ropes while unloading a flurry of punches, awarding Gill the win via third-round TKO to capture the regional WBA title. The first defence of his title came two months later against Mario Enrique Tinoco on 10 May at the Motorpoint Arena in Nottingham. Gill was dropped on three occasions; once in the third round, again in the fifth and once more in the seventh, all by punches to the body. Before the start of round eight, Dave Coldwell, Gill's head trainer, pulled the champion out of the contest to save his charge from further punishment. Tinoco was declared the winner via eighth round corner retirement (RTD). After the fight, Gill claimed his poor performance was due to illness, saying, \"I'm not going to make excuses but I'm going to, I've been on the toilet all afternoon. I think I've got food poisoning, I was not going to pull out on the day, I didn't want to quit in the fight.\" ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |26 |Win |25\u20131 |align=left| Reece Bellotti |UD |10 |1 Aug 2020 |align=left| | |- |25 |Win |24\u20131 |align=left| Yesner Talavera |UD |6 |19 Sep 2019 |align=left| | |- |24 |Loss |23\u20131 |align=left| Mario Enrique Tinoco | |8 (10), |10 May 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |23 |Win |23\u20130 |align=left| Emmanuel Dominguez |TKO |3 (12), |2 Mar 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |22 |Win |22\u20130 |align=left| Ryan Doyle |TKO |7 (12), |27 Oct 2018 |align=left| |align=left| |- |21 |Win |21\u20130 |align=left| David Berna |TKO |1 (8), |4 Aug 2018 |align=left| | |- |20 |Win |20\u20130 |align=left| Carl McDonald |PTS |6 |5 May 2018 |align=left| | |- |19 |Win |19\u20130 |align=left| Jason Cunningham | |10 |25 Feb 2018 |align=left| | |- |18 |Win |18\u20130 |align=left| Rafael Castillo |PTS |6 |13 Oct 2017 |align=left| | |- |17 |Win |17\u20130 |align=left| Jordan Ellison |TKO |2 (6), |2 Sep 2017 |align=left| | |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |align=left| Chris Adaway |PTS |6 |26 Mar 2016 |align=left| | |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |align=left| Harvey Hemsley |TKO |2 (6), |5 Dec 2015 |align=left| | |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |align=left| Giorgi Gachechiladze |PTS |6 |25 Jul 2015 |align=left| | |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |align=left| Barrington Brown |PTS |6 |28 Mar 2015 |align=left| | |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |align=left| Giorgi Kulumbegashvili |PTS |4 |7 Dec 2014 |align=left| | |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |align=left| Simas Volosinas |PTS |6 |20 Sep 2014 |align=left| | |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |align=left| Michael Mooney |PTS |4 |10 May 2014 |align=left| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |align=left| Michael Stupart | |2 (8), |1 Feb 2014 |align=left| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |align=left| Aaron Flinn | |1 (4), |26 Oct 2013 |align=left| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |align=left| Dan Carr |PTS |4 |14 Sep 2013 |align=left| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |align=left| Kristian Laight |PTS |4 |22 Jun 2013 |align=left| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |align=left| Pavels Senkovs |PTS |4 |11 May 2013 |align=left| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |align=left| Sid Razak |PTS |6 |2 Feb 2013 |align=left| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |align=left| Pavels Senkovs |PTS |4 |8 Dec 2012 |align=left| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Dan Naylor |PTS |4 |13 Oct 2012 |align=left| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Kristian Laight | |4 |7 Jul 2012 |align=left| | |- |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:English male boxers Category:Sportspeople from Cambridgeshire Category:Featherweight boxers Category:Super-featherweight boxers Category:Lightweight boxers Category:Commonwealth Boxing Council champions ",
