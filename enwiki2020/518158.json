    "text": "Ying Chen (; born February 20, 1961) is a Chinese Canadian author. She writes mostly in French and also translates her own works into Chinese and English. Born in 1961 in Shanghai, she now lives in Vancouver and is the mother of two children. She obtained a degree in French language and literature from Fudan University (\u590d\u65e6\u5927\u5b66) in 1983 and worked as a translator and interpreter before moving to Montreal in 1989. She later lived in Magog, Quebec before moving to Vancouver in 2003. Ying Chen's novels include La m\u00e9moire de l'eau, Les lettres chinoises, L'ingratitude (which won the Prix Qu\u00e9bec-Paris, and was published in the U.S. as \"Ingratitude,\" translated by Carol Volk, and published in China as \"\u518d\u89c1\u5988\u5988\", self-translated), Immobile (which won the Prix Alfred-DesRochers), Le champ dans la mer (published in China as \"V\u5bb6\u82b1\u56ed\", self-translated), Querelle d'un squelette avec son double (self-translated and published on Amazon as \"Skeleton and its double\"), \"Le Mangeur\", \"Un Enfant \u00e0 ma porte\", \"Esp\u00e8ces\", \"La Rive est loin\". She wrote two books of essays: \"Quatre mille marches\" and \"La Lenteur des montagnes\". She practices a lean, polished and deceptively simple writing style, free of flourishes and excess verbiage. As a child, one of her schoolteachers once told her \"the most simple is the most beautiful\", and she has retained this idea. ==See also== *List of Quebec authors ==External links== *review and commentary on Immobile (in French) *China.com.cn interview (in Chinese) * Interview with Ying Chen for Lingua Romana Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Canadian novelists Category:Chinese emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian writers of Asian descent Category:Canadian women novelists Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada Category:Short story writers from Shanghai Category:Fudan University alumni Category:21st-century Canadian women writers Category:Canadian novelists in French Category:Chinese women novelists Category:Canadian women short story writers Category:Chinese women short story writers ",
