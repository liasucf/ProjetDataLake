    "text": "The Wazir Khan Chowk () is a town square located in the Walled City of Lahore, Pakistan that is located at the main entrance of the Wazir Khan Mosque. ==Location== Wazir Khan Chowk is located at the main entrance to the Wazir Khan Mosque, and is located approximately 250 metres west of the Delhi Gate. Access to the town square from Delhi Gate is through the smaller Chitta Gate. ==Structures located in the square== Wazir Khan Chowk features the tomb of the Sufi saint Said Soaf, and the Well of Dina Nath. ==Restoration== The Well of Dina Nath was restored in partnership with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. In 2012, the Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project\u2014the Shahi Guzargah Project was launched by the Government of Punjab, and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) which restored a section of Shahi Guzargah which included the Wazir Khan Chowk. Prior to completion of the project's first phase, the square had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. The first phase of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of 73 illegally constructed buildings, while the well of Dina Nath was also restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground. The Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated. In December 2015, further efforts to restore the site were launched by the AKTC with funding from the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation - a programme run by the United States Department of State. Under the million plan, the town square will be lowered to the original depth found during the Mughal era in order to fully expose the mosque's original fa\u00e7ade. Shopkeepers which have occupied hujras, or cells in the mosque designed for religious study, will also be removed, while two historic homes will also be restored. The project will also include further restoration works to the Dina Nath well, and will also include improved outdoor lighting. The project will restore the square to its original appearance, and is expected to require 18 months for completion. The government of the United States of America has provided $1.1 million of the projects costs. ==References== Category:Mughal architecture Category:Walled City of Lahore ",
