Baghdad, 1960) is an Iraqi multi-media artist, photographer, animator, video producer and installation artist noted for producing \"existentialist\" works with dark, shadowy figures that speak of human frailty. ==Life and career== Sadik Kwaish Alfraji was born in Baghdad in 1960. His initial training was as a painter and printmaker, obtaining first a Diploma of Plastic Art and Painting from Baghdad's Institute of Fine Arts (1982) and later a Bachelor of Arts from Baghdad's Academy of Arts (1987). He studied art not long after Saddam Hussein came to power. Like many other artists, Alfraji realised that the Ba'ath Party was attempting to co-opt art and culture for use as propaganda. However, artists have the ability to play around with concepts, and they began to conceal their intended message using abstraction and other techniques to construct messages of protest that the authorities could not understand. \u201cDictators are stupid,\u201d he noted, \u201cThey won\u2019t necessarily read between the lines.\u201d As a young artist in Baghdad in the 1980s, Alfraji worked as an animator for children's television. This sparked a life-long interest in animation and multi-media productions, which has since become the foundation for much of his work. At the time of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Alfraji produced a series of etchings of psychiatric patients as well as an art book, Biography of a Head (1985), the story of a head without a body. After the war, shortages of art materials and media forced many artists, including Alfraji to use \"found\" material such as shrapnel and bullets, which were incorporated into their artworks. Alfraji left Iraq in the 1990s for political reasons and later settled in Amersfoort, The Netherlands where he was granted Dutch citizenship. After arriving in The Netherlands, he returned to study, enrolling at the Constantijn Huygens, Kampen, Netherlands and taking out a Diploma in Graphic Design in 2000. He has returned to Iraq only once, in 2009, at the time of his father's death. On this visit, an encounter with his 12-year old nephew became the inspiration for his animated video, Driven By Storms, which has since been acquired by the British Museum. The artist explains: He is the subject of a book, simply titled Sadik Kwaish Alfraji, edited by Nat Muller, Schilt Publishing, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2015). ==Work == As he often states, his work has been influenced by Expressionism, as well as his love of philosophy and literature, especially existentialism. His artworks, with their shadowy, faceless figures and dark backgrounds are distinctive. The overarching theme in all his work is the frailty of the human condition and the question of human existence. He has exhibited at scores of Middle Eastern and European galleries. He is one of a select group of Iraqi artists to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in 2017. Alfraji\u2019s works are housed in public collections including the British Museum, London; National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad; The Art Center, Baghdad; National Gallery of Fine Arts Amman; Shoman Foundation, Amman; Royal Association of Fine Arts, Amman; Novosibirsk State Art Museum, Russia; and the Cluj- Napoca Art Museum, Romania; Los Angeles Country Museum; and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston ==Awards== * 2012 Artist of the Year at the Esquire Middle East Awards, Dubai, UAE. * 2014 Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center awardee, Italy. * 2015 Grant, Driven By Storms (Ali\u2019s Boat), Mondriaan Fund, Amsterdam, Netherlands. ==See also== * Iraqi art * List of Iraqi artists ==References== ==External links== * Two interviews with the artist (radio) Category:20th-century Iraqi painters Category:Abstract artists Category:Abstract painters Category:Artists from Baghdad Category:Iraqi contemporary artists Category:1960 births Category:Living people ",
