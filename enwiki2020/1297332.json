    "text": "The Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019armement (DGA; English: Directorate General of Armaments), is the French Government Defence procurement and technology agency responsible for project management, development and purchase of weapon systems for the French military.(Nuclear warheads and nuclear submarine power plants are designed by the division of military applications of the Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nergie atomique (CEA)). ==Armament project coordination== The DGA coordinates armament projects with the industry in France, within Europe, but also with customers for export. Together with the Europe of Defence organisation, the DGA promotes the development of armament projects in co- operation and contributes to the development of the European Defence Agency. Fifteen cooperative armament projects are under way. The OCCAr (Joint Organisation of Co-operation as regards Armament) ensures the control of six projects intended to equip the French force, inter allia: combat Tiger helicopter, ground-to-air missiles short Roland/Frole range, Cobra counter- battery radar, family of ground-to-air systems future (FSAF), A400M military transport aircraft, PAAMS anti-aircraft system. ==Other activities== ===Testing and expertise=== The DGA also undertakes the testing and assessment of equipment and military technologies. Test centres are distributed across France to carry out studies in advanced technologies: DGA Hydrodynamics, DGA Aero-engine Testing, DGA CBRN Defence, DGA Information superiority, DGA Land Systems, DGA Missiles Testing, DGA Naval Systems, DGA Flight Testing, DGA Aeronautical Systems, DGA Engineering & Integration. These services contribute to the validation of industrial equipment, but also to the proving of military systems for the programme directorates. Since 2004 DGA, has been organised into two subdirectorates for the coordination of projects dealing respectively with the inter-systems technical approach (Service of architecture inter- systems) and with technological developments (responsible for domains). ===Engineering schools=== In addition, DGA supervises engineering schools that operate under the scrutiny of the Ministry of defence (\u00c9cole polytechnique, ENSTA ParisTech, Supa\u00e9ro, ENSTA Bretagne, ENSICA). The high-level military staff of DGA, the Corps of Armament whose members are the ing\u00e9nieurs de l'armement (IA, literally, \"Armament Engineers\"), are commissioned officers, who are generally graduates of the \u00c9cole polytechnique, then the ENSTA or Supa\u00e9ro. The main part of the engineers, the ing\u00e9nieurs des \u00e9tudes et techniques d'armement (IETA, literally, \"weaponry studies and technics engineers\") are graduates of the ENSIETA or ENSICA. ===Naval building=== The DGA also formerly had a division for building warships, the Direction des constructions navales (\"Directorate of Naval Construction\"), now formed into a partly state-owned corporation, DCNS. == List of d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pour l'armement == The list of successive Heads of the DGA, whether they are from the Corps de l'armement, from the Corps des mines or from the French Armed Forces, whether they are more technology-oriented or \"cost-cutting\"-oriented, whether they originate from the DGA itself or from outside, gives an idea of the evolution of the institution.

There are at least three (one for each service branch) but usually others are appointed to run the main divisions within the DGA. *Ing\u00e9nieur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de classe exceptionnelle (\"Engineer-General, Exceptional Class\", equivalent to a G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e). There is usually only one: the titular D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour l'Armement (the head of DGA). Officers of the Corps des ing\u00e9nieurs des \u00e9tudes et techniques de l'armement have also a unique rank structure. *Ing\u00e9nieur, (1er \u00e9chelon) (\"Engineer\", first level, equivalent to a Sous-lieutenant) *Ing\u00e9nieur, (2e au 5e \u00e9chelon) (\"Engineer\", from second to fifth level, equivalent to a Lieutenant) *Ing\u00e9nieur, (6e au 10e \u00e9chelon) (\"Engineer\", from sixth to tenth level, equivalent to a Capitaine) *Ing\u00e9nieur principal (\"Lead Engineer\", equivalent to a Commandant) *Ing\u00e9nieur en chef de 2e classe (\"Chief Engineer, Second Class\" equivalent to a Lieutenant-Colonel) *Ing\u00e9nieur en chef de 1er classe (\"Chief Engineer, First Class\" equivalent to a Colonel) *Ing\u00e9nieur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de 2e classe (\"Engineer- General, Second Class\", equivalent to a G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade) *Ing\u00e9nieur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de 1er classe (\"Engineer-General, First Class\", equivalent to a G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division) ==See also== * AGATE, the architecture framework promoted by the DGA ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Official webpage of the DGA 03 !
