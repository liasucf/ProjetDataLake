    "text": "Fujiwara no Sumitomo was a Japanese Heian era court noble and warrior. From 939 to 941 he aided the Taira clan in a series of revolts. Sumitomo built his power base in Northern Kyushu. After making a secret agreement with Taira no Masakado, who was leading a revolt in Shim\u014dsa Province, Sumitomo led his own revolt in Iyo province in 939, and soon afterwards invaded the provinces of Harima and Bizen. The revolt quickly spread throughout the whole San'y\u014d region. Pursued by imperial forces led by Ono Yoshifuru and Minamoto no Tsunemoto, Sumitomo fled to Dazaifu, burning down the Dazaifu headquarters before he was defeated in battle at Hakata Bay. He then fled back to Iyo province, where he was captured. He was executed shortly afterwards, in 941, by Tachibana T\u014dyasu. His father was Fujiwara no Yoshinori, and he was the ancestor of the Arima clan of Hizen province. ==References== * * * Category:Fujiwara clan Category:941 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Deified Japanese people ",
