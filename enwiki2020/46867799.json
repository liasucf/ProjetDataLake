    "text": "Moshe Leiser, born 1956 in Antwerp and Patrice Caurier born 1954 in Paris are two opera directors who have worked exclusively as a couple since 1983. They stage productions at theaters in Western Europe. == Life and work == The two directors began their collaboration in 1983 at the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon with the opera A Midsummer Night's Dream which is also the work of a duo: Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears jointly adapted Shakespeare's play and wrote the libretto; Britten composed and conducted; and Pears created the comic role of Flute/Thisbe, and later sang Lysander. Since this premiere, Leiser and Caurier have lived and worked together continuously. Jasper Rees wrote that this collaboration of more than 30 years has made them \"opera's closest equivalent to Gilbert and George\".Jasper Rees: theartsdesk Q&A;: Opera Directors Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser, 3. April 2010 For a long time the Belgian-French director duo worked exclusively in France and the French part of Switzerland with occasional productions at the Spoleto Festival USA in South Carolina and at the Welsh National Opera. In 1999, they directed A Midsummer Night's Dream together at Opera North in Leeds. This was followed in 2001 by an invitation to the Royal Opera House in London, where Leiser/Caurier are still involved. In 2008, the Zurich artistic director at the time, Alexander Pereira finally engaged the directing duo for the first time in German-speaking territory. In Zurich, the two directors worked closely and productively with Cecilia Bartoli. In 2012 Bartoli and Pereira - both now in management positions in Salzburg - brought the two directors to the Salzburg Whitsun Festival. A few months later the Bregenz Festival followed, and in 2013 the Theater an der Wien and then the Vienna State Opera. Leiser/Caurier work with the same production team, the stage designer Christian Fenouillat, the costume designer Agostino Cavalca and the lighting designer Christophe Forey. Several of their productions have been released on DVD. == Style == Julius Caesar in Egypt with Cecilia Bartoli, Salzburg Festival 2012 Leiser/Caurier attempt to bring even subject matter that seems remote from the present day to modern audiences by using contemporary expressions and mannerisms. They have two distinct styles. On one hand, there are their settings of comic opera, which show no fear of slapstick and visual effects, and can actually transform banal plots into coherent narratives. On the other hand, they compress the unfolding of tragic events, for example, by shifting Der Ring des Nibelungen to postwar Germany, or Norma to Benito Mussolini-era Italy. == Directorial work (selection) == * Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon: A Midsummer Night's Dream (1983) \u2013 The Child and the Spells (1988/89) \u2013 Dialogues of the Carmelites (1989/90) \u2013 Ariane and Bluebeard (1998/99) \u2013 Betrothal in a Monastery (2000/01) \u2013 Lucia di Lammermoor (2002) * Spoleto Festival USA, Charleston SC: Salome (1987) \u2013 Rusalka (1988) \u2013 The Coronation of Poppaea (1991) \u2013 Wozzeck (1997) \u2013 Jen\u016ffa (1998) \u2013 Iphigenia in Tauris (2000) \u2013 Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (2007) \u2013 The Magic Flute (2011) * Berlioz Festival, Lyon: The Trojans (1987) \u2013 Benvenuto Cellini * Welsh National Opera: Iphigenia in Tauris (1992) \u2013 Carmen (1997) \u2013 Mazeppa (2005 or 2006) \u2013 Fidelio, Orpheus and Eurydice, Eugen Onegin * Scottish Opera: La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (1995) \u2013 Carmen * Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve: Wozzeck \u2013 Hamlet (1996) \u2013 Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande \u2013 Der Rosenkavalier \u2013 Der Ring des Nibelungen \u2013 Don Carlos * Opera North, Leeds: A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) * Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London: La Cenerentola (2001) \u2013 Madama Butterfly (2003) \u2013 Hamlet (transferred from Geneva, 2003) \u2013 Hansel and Gretel (2008) \u2013 The Barber of Seville (2009) \u2013 Il turco in Italia (2010) \u2013 Maria Stuarda (2014) * Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg: Eugen Onegin (2002) * Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona: Hamlet (transferred from Geneva, 2003) \u2013 Madama Butterfly * Theater Basel: The Love for Three Oranges (2006/07) * Theater an der Wien: Eugen Onegin (guest performance from the Mariinski, 2007) \u2013 Le comte Ory (transferred from Z\u00fcrich, 2013) \u2013 Giovanni Paisiello's The Barber of Seville (2015) * Z\u00fcrich Opera House: Clari (Swiss Premiere, 2008) \u2013 Mos\u00e8 in Egitto (2009) \u2013 Marc-Andr\u00e9 Dalbavie's Gesualdo (Premiere, 2010) \u2013 Le comte Ory (2011) \u2013 Rossini's Otello (2012, also Vlaamse Opera, Salzburg Whitsun Festival and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Paris) * Copenhagen Opera House: Il turco in Italia (2009) * Metropolitan Opera, New York: Hamlet (transferred from Geneva, 2010) * Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra: Falstaff (2011) \u2013 Bluebeard's Castle (2011) \u2013 The Italian Straw Hat (2012) \u2013 The Magic Flute (2014) \u2013 Jen\u016ffa, Tosca * Salzburg Festival and Salzburg Whitsun Festival: Julius Caesar in Egypt (2012) \u2013 Norma (2013) \u2013 Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride (2015) * The Bregenz Festival: Solaris (Premiere, 2012) * Op\u00e9ra de Lille: Jen\u016ffa (2013) * Vienna State Opera: The Magic Flute (2013) * Rossini Opera Festival: L'equivoco stravagante (2019) Opera houses ordered chronologically by the first directorial work in each house.
