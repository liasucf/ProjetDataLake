    "text": "Classic Star Wars is a series of various classic Star Wars comics reprinted by Dark Horse Comics between 1992 and 1996. It notably includes compilations of the weekly newspaper Star Wars comic strips written by Archie Goodwin and illustrated by Al Williamson; these were published as 20 single issues between 1992 and 1994 with new cover art by Williamson and others, and collected as three trade paperbacks between 1994 and 1996. While originally achromatic, these comics were colorized for the Dark Horse reprints. The Classic Star Wars banner also includes reprints of Marvel's original adaptations of the original trilogy from the self-titled comic (over two issues each in 1994, with new colorization in the case of A New Hope), Russ Manning's comic strip (as Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures), a reprint of issue #98 of Marvel's Star Wars (as Classic Star Wars: The Vandelhelm Mission), and various colorized comics originallly printed by Marvel UK's magazine, including many by Alan Moore (as Classic Star Wars: Devilworlds). {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Classic Star Wars |- |Classic Star Wars #1\u201320 |August 1992 \u2013 June 1994 |- |Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures #1\u20139 |August 1994 \u2013 April 1995 |- |Classic Star Wars: Devilworlds #1\u20132 |August\u2013September 1996 |- |} == Trade paperbacks == * Volume One: In Deadly Pursuit (collects Star Wars #1\u20137, 196 pages, June 1994, ) * Volume Two: The Rebel Storm (collects Star Wars #8\u201314, 208 pages, July 1995, ) * Star Wars (collects Star Wars vol. 1 #1\u20136, 104 pages, November 1995, ) * The Empire Strikes Back (collects Star Wars vol. 1 #39\u201344, 104 pages, November 1995, ) * Return of the Jedi (collects Star Wars: Return of the Jedi #1\u20134, 104 pages, November 1995, ) * Volume Three: Escape to Hoth (collects Star Wars #15\u201320, 208 pages, January 1996, ) * The Early Adventures (collects Star Wars: The Early Adventures #1\u20139, 240 pages, May 1997, ) * Han Solo at Stars' End (collects Star Wars: Han Solo at Stars' End #1\u20133, 104 pages, October 1997, ) == Related publications == In 1991, Russ Cochran published a 2500-copy limited run of a three-volume hardcover boxset of all of Goodwin and Williamson's Star Wars comic strips from 1981 to 1984, signed by both creators, and featuring new cover illustrations by the latter.

Watson comments that \"This is very weak indeed. The Star Wars concept deserves much better treatment than this basic pulp and clearly does not work in this format.\" Conversely, internet reviewer John Hansen says, \"The Goodwin/Williamson strips are all about the childhood wonder brought out by the original trilogy and fans' memories of seeing the films for the first time.\" == See also == * Splinter of the Mind's Eye ==References== Footnotes Citations Category:1992 comics debuts Category:Comics based on Star Wars Category:Dark Horse Comics titles ",
