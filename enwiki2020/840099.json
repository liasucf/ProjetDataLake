In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron's ultimate career total, 755, remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Twenty-seven players are members of the 500 home run club. Ted Williams (.344) holds the highest batting average among the club members while Harmon Killebrew (.256) holds the lowest. Of these 27 players, 14 were right- handed batters, 11 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters. The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are the only franchises to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: for the Giants, Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds, and, for the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx, Williams, and more recently Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz. Six 500 home run club members\u2014Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, Albert Pujols, and Alex Rodriguez\u2014are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Gary Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest. The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Ortiz, who hit his 500th home run on September 12, 2015. As of the end of the season, Albert Pujols is the only active member of the 500 home run club. Membership in the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years. Five eligible club members\u2014Bonds, Mark McGwire, Palmeiro, Sheffield and Sammy Sosa\u2014have not been elected to the Hall. Bonds and Sosa made their first appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot in ; Bonds received only 36.2% and Sosa 12.5% of the total votes, with 75% required for induction. Eligibility requires that a player has \"been retired five seasons\" or be deceased for at least six months. Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009. Additionally, several of these recent members have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall the voters were establishing a \"referendum\" on how they would treat players from the \"Steroid Era\". On January 8, 2014, Palmeiro became the first member of the club to be removed from the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot. As the BBWAA announced the selections for the Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2014, Palmeiro appeared on just 4.4% of the ballots. Players must be named on at least of 5.0% of ballots to remain on future ballots. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !scope=\"row\"|Player |Name of the player |- !scope=\"row\"|HR |Career home runs |- !scope=\"row\"|Date |Date of the player's 500th home run |- !scope=\"row\"|Team |The batter's team at the time of his 500th home run |- !scope=\"row\"|Seasons |The seasons this player played in the major leagues |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb;\"| |Elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfecec;\"| |Denotes player who is still active |} ==Members== * Stats updated as of September 18, 2020 alt=A man in full baseball attire wears a pinstriped jersey and a hat with overlapping white \"N\" and \"Y\".
