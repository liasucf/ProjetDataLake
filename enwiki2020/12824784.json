    "text": "Sowiesoso (from ) is the fourth full-length album by German electronic music outfit Cluster, released in 1976. Sowiesoso was recorded in just two days in Forst, Germany in 1976 and mixed at Conny's Studio in Wolperath. It was Cluster's first release for Krautrock label Sky Records, a relationship which would last until 1986 including albums with Brian Eno, solo recordings, and three albums by the duo of Moebius and former Cluster member and frequent engineer/producer Conny Plank. ==Background== Brian Eno had worked with Moebius and Roedelius with Harmonia prior to the recording of Sowiesoso and worked with Cluster again on two albums in 1977 and 1978 and the influence of the British ambient musician is clearly heard on the softer and more controlled sound of this album. Reviewer Russ Curry describes the album this way: \"...a fully realized marriage of electronic sounds with a pastoral warmth.\" Julian Cope included Sowiesoso in his Krautrock Top 50. The album was first reissued on CD by Sky Records in 1992. It has also been reissued by the American label Gyroscope in 1996, the San Francisco-based Water label in 2006 and the Japanese label Captain Trip in 2007. ==Track listing== All song written by Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius. ;Side one #\"Sowiesoso\" \u2013 8:10 (On most CD reissues this track is shortened with a running time of 7:17) #\"Halwa\" \u2013 2:47 #\"Dem Wanderer\" \u2013 3:47 #\"Umleitung\" \u2013 3:25 ;Side two #\"Zum Wohl\" \u2013 6:50 #\"Es War Einmal\" \u2013 5:25 #\"In Ewigkeit\" \u2013 7:10 ==Personnel== *Dieter Moebius \u2013 keyboards, percussion, vocals *Hans-Joachim Roedelius \u2013 keyboards, percussion, vocals == References == == External links == * Freeman, Steven and Freeman, Alan The Crack In The Cosmic Egg.
