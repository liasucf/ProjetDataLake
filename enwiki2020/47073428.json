Anaya is an independent, non-political, non-profit organization. It is an active organization within Cambodia and in countries with a Cambodian population that has been scattered. Anvaya has over 300 registered members, collectively called \u201cAnvayiste\u201d or \"Diaspora\", across the world. == Origin of name and emblem == The name Anvaya (in Khmer script: \u17a2\u1793\u17d2\u179c\u1799\u17c8) comes from the Sanskrit language and means family or lineage. The Anvaya's emblem is a set of three lotus flowers, each symbolizing one of the continents of the Diaspora (Europe, America, or Oceania) which together represent Cambodia. == Creation == Anvaya was created in 2010 by Soreasmey Ke Bin, a French-Cambodian, and David Yim, a Cambodian-American. Upon returning to Cambodia in the early 2000s, they observed that Cambodians that wished to return to their roots had no kind of support system to help them. They then launched Anvaya as a free social network to gather people looking to return to their roots at regular events. In 2013, Anvaya became a fully legal registered association established by Soreasmey Ke Bin, its founding president. In 2013, Anvaya was legally registered as an association by its president, Soreasmey Ke Bin. == Organization == Anvaya is managed by a steering committee of 6 directors, each of which are elected by 30 members of the permanent council of the association with a two-year mandate. As of August 2016, the president of the association is one of the original co-founders, Soreasmey Ke Bin. == Mission == The main goal of Anvaya is to \"ease the return of the Cambodian diaspora\".A duty to our Homeland, a tribune by Mitty Steele, Anvaya's vice- president http://www.banyanblog.com/home/a-duty-to-our-homeland Anvaya's 4 key objectives are to: * Foster a sense of community among returnees through this social and professional network * Encourage and support overseas Cambodians in their effort to return * Inform overseas Cambodian about business, social and employment opportunities in Cambodia * Develop opportunities for overseas Cambodians to return, especially young professionals Anvaya aspires to catalyze and facilitate the rebirth of Cambodia through the collaboration and support of partners in the private sector, international institutions and government. == Members == All the members of Anvaya originate from Cambodia and have lived among the Cambodian diaspora communities.
