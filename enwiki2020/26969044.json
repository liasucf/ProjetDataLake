In 1991 Club Jalisco sold its franchise, the new owners relocated the team on Acapulco and renamed it as Delfines de Acapulco. In 2015, two different groups created two new teams trying to revive the history of the Club Jalisco. On the one hand, a team from the city of El Salto changed its name unofficially to Jalisco. On the other hand, former club players founded another team called Gallos Viejos, which continues to play in the Third Division. On June 2019, Club Jalisco signed an agreement with Deportivo CAFESSA, through this document a new club called Deportivo CAFESSA Jalisco was established, which represented the return of Club Jalisco to football, since the other teams had only taken up the name of the team without having a direct relationship with the directive. After that, the new team began playing in the Liga Premier de M\u00e9xico \u2013 Serie A and won the right to use the Estadio Jalisco as their home venue. ==Honors== *Runner up Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico 1984 ==See also== *Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico *CD Oro *Jalisco Stadium ==Footnotes== Category:Defunct football clubs in Jalisco Category:Defunct football clubs in Mexico Category:Football clubs in Guadalajara, Jalisco ",
