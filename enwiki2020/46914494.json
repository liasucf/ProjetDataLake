    "text": "The 1915 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team represented the Georgia Tech Golden Tornado of the Georgia Institute of Technology during the 1915 college football season. The Tornado was coached by John Heisman in his 12th year as head coach, compiling a record of 7\u20130\u20131 and outscoring opponents 233 to 24. Georgia Tech played its home games at Grant Field. The Tech team claims a Southern championship, and had what was then the greatest season in its history. ==Before the season== Froggie Morrison Coach John Heisman's backfield used the pre-snap movement of his \"jump shift\" offense. The team's captain was Froggie Morrison, Tech's first great quarterback. Fullback Tommy Spence was a future World War I casualty, and halfback Wooch Fielder was later a prominent figure in World War II. New halfback Everett Strupper was partially deaf; because of his deafness, he called the signals when he played, instead of the team's quarterback. When \"Strupe\" tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback shouted the signals every time he was to carry the ball. Realizing that the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman: \"Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me lip-reading.\" Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame his deafness: \"He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball.\" ==Schedule== ==Season summary== ===Week 1: Mercer=== Tech opened the season with a 52\u20130 defeat of the Mercer Baptists. The Tech backs plunged through the Baptists line almost at will. ===Week 2: Davidson=== In the second week of play, [ had the upper hand for three quarters, but Tech managed to pull ahead in the third quarter, and won 21\u20137. In the first quarter, Davidson scored on a punt fumbled by Everett Strupper. Froggie Morrison hit Jim Senter with a 35-yard pass for a touchdown in the third quarter.

Georgia Tech handily defeated the LSU Tigers 36\u20137 using conventional football, at the expense of Heisman being ejected from the game for arguing with an official. Tech repeatedly hammered LSU's left end. \"Except for a brief period in the second quarter, when Louisiana executed three consecutive passes for average gains of 25 yards, the Tigers practically were helpless\".

Wooch Fielder scored first. In the second period, Everett Strupper had a 7-yard touchdown run. Tommy Spence scored on a 5-yard run in the third. Alabama's lone score came on the first play of the fourth quarter on an elaborate trick play, a 30-yard forward pass from Bully Van de Graaff, Alabama's first All-American, to Stevenson. http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/alab/graphics/docs/15-m-footbl-recap.pdf The starting lineup against Alabama: Goree (left end), Bell (left tackle), Reynolds (left guard), Phillips (center), Lang (right guard), Carpenter (right tackle), Senter (right end), Morrison (quarter), Mathias (left halfback), Fielder (right halfback), Spence (fullback). ===Week 7: Georgia=== The year's only blemish was a scoreless tie against the rival Georgia Bulldogs in inches of mud. John G. Henderson headed a group of three men, one behind the other with his hands upon the shoulders of the one in front, to counter Heisman's jump shift offense. Georgia outplayed Tech throughout. Georgia was once on Tech's 8-yard line, in the first quarter, but Walter Neville fumbled and Tommy Spence recovered.

To begin the second quarter, Everett Strupper had two key plays, the last of which was the game-deciding touchdown. First he made 20 yards around with a pass from MorrisonBlue Print, 1916 before being forced out of bounds. Next was the 19-yard touchdown. Strupper started around left end, then cut back into the center of the field, away from his blockers. He juked and eluded \"every man on the Auburn team.\" On the last move Strupper faked right and then dove left underneath the outstretched arms of Baby Taylor into the endzone. The starting lineup against Auburn: Goree (left end), Mauck (left tackle), Reynolds (left guard), Phillips (center), Lang (right guard), Barnwell (right tackle), Senter (right end), Morrison (quarter), Johnston (left halfback), Fielder (right halfback), Spence (fullback). ==Post season== The pennant at the annual banquet. Tech claimed the right to dispute the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) title with Vanderbilt, despite no longer being a member. The Atlanta Constitution declared it a tie between Vanderbilt and Tech. The Tech team was awarded a 17 x 45 foot pennant as Southern champion. Wooch Fielder and Bob Lang made composite All-Southern. Jim Senter, Froggie Morrison and Everett Strupper also made some All-Southern teams. ==Personnel== ===Depth chart=== The following chart provides a visual depiction of Tech's lineup during the 1915 season with games started at the position reflected in parenthesis.
