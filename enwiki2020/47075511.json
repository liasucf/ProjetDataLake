    "text": "Feels Like is the debut studio album by American rock band Bully, released in 2015. ==Critical reception== Feels Like received generally positive reviews from critics. Laura Snapes of Pitchfork wrote, \"The coarse Cobain head-scream of Bully singer, songwriter, and guitarist Alicia Bognanno is its own resuscitating jolt of protest... she spends much of Feels Like tearing down the house with her howl.\" Conversely, Michael Hann of The Guardian dismissed the album as \"a grab-bag of early-90s alt-rock styles that sounded tired by the mid-90s \u2013 and haven't got any fresher since.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2015 debut albums Category:Bully (band) albums Category:Columbia Records albums ",
