Along the way, they befriend single mother Bri Quince (Gloria Talbott) and her son \"Jo-Hi\" (Clint Howard). The two bounty hunters are later forced to rely upon each other when Talion's gun hand is shattered in a shootout and Wallace is blinded during a confrontation with Ike Slant's outlaws, leading them to resolutely combine into one single, unstoppable killing machine.
