For Adventure, Buckley wrote a series of stories set in the Italian Renaissance, revolving around the swashbuckling exploits of condottieri Captain Luigi Caradosso.Frank D. McSherry, Jr., \"Captain of Adventure: Luigi Caradosso\" in Pulp Vault magazine, #6, November 1989. Tattered Pages Press, (pp .9-16) The Luigi Caradosso stories were enormously popular with Adventure's readers. When Adventure published a new Caradosso story in the May 1940 issue (after a six-year hiatus), the editor Howard Bloomfield noted that many readers had written in to request that the magazine \"Bring back Captain Caradosso.\" Buckley also wrote a novel, The Way of Sinners, set in sixteenth century Italy, in which Caradosso is mentioned. Buckley also published Western, mystery and sea stories as well as historical fiction. Later some of his short stories would be adapted for film or radio by others.
