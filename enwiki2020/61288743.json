    "text": "RTB Ebbw Vale Football Club are a Welsh association football club based in the town of Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, South Wales. The team was founded in 1951 as the football club of the Richard Thomas and Baldwins Steelworks. They currently play in the Gwent County League Premier Division. They played in the Welsh Football League for two seasons in the early 2000s. ==History== RTB Ebbw Vale FC was formed in 1951 as part of the then Richard Thomas & Baldwin Steel Company (social section) and entered the Ebbw Vale & District League. In the early 1960s RTB, as they were to be known, joined the Mon Senior League. The club won the Mon Senior Cup in 1969-70 and were finalists in 1971 and 1973. They were crowned Division One Champions in 1973, just missing out on the double by losing in the cup final. In 1980 the Mon Senior League was amalgamated with the Gwent Premier League to form the Gwent County League. Mike Cope led the club to promotion to the First Division of the Gwent County League as Division Two Champions in 1993-94 and Mike Williams, as player/manager achieved their long held ambition of promotion to the Welsh Football League Division Three in 2000-01. The club struggled to adjust to the rigours of Welsh League football, and were not fully prepared at that time for the demands put upon their squad of players, due to the travelling, and the sheer expense of survival. Although it has to be noted that the quality of football played by the first team and second team (Welsh Reserve League) was exceptional and commented on by many a visiting player, manager and supporter. In 2002 the club found respite from the tough league season in the cup competitions and were runners up in the Gwent Senior Cup, losing 4-1 to a very strong Newport County side at Caldicot. After two seasons of struggle in the Welsh League the club were relegated back into the Gwent County and have fluctuated between the First and Second Divisions ever since. ==Honours== *Gwent County League Division One - Runners-Up: 2000\u201301 *Gwent County League Division Two - Champions: 1993\u201394; 2015\u201316 *Gwent County League Division Two - Runners-Up: 2007\u201308 *Gwent County Motors Cup - Runners-Up: 2015\u201316 *Gwent County Amateur Cup - Runners-Up: 2015\u201316 *Mon Senior League - Champions: 1972\u201373 *Mon Senior Cup - Winners: 1969\u201370 *Mon Senior Cup - Runners-Up: 1970\u201371; 1972\u201373 ==Welsh Football League history== Information in this section is sourced from the Football Club History Databasehttp://www.fchd.info/RTB- EBBW.HTM and the Welsh Soccer Archive.https://www.welshsoccerarchive.co.uk/index.php/welsh-leagues/welsh- league {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !
