He was considered to be one of the most top voice dubbers for many animated films and cartoons for audiences across Italy. ==Biography== Born in Pomezia, which is in Rome, Latini started out working as a singer in nightclubs in the early 1950s, then he went on to work in the theatre and star in the 1953 film The World Condemns Them. Among Latini's most popular filmography includes the 1966 musical-comedy film Mondo pazzo... gente matta! starring Silvana Pampanini and the 1976 film The Black Maid starring Carla Brait. Despite Latini's popularity working as an actor, he was also heavily active as a voice actor.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) He dubbed Stan Laurel in several redubs of Laurel and Hardy shorts and films in which he was paired up with Carlo Croccolo.

He was the first voice of Skeletor in Masters of the Universe and from 1983 until 1988, he was the primary Italian voice of Donald Duck and he even dubbed Tom from Tom & Jerry and various characters from Looney Tunes and The Muppet Show.
