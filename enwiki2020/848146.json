The Recrear Federal Movement is a national alliance formed in 2003 between Recrear itself and the Federal Movement of various provincial parties - the Salta Renewal Party, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Party of Mendoza, the Federal Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes, the Democratic Party of the City of Buenos Aires, the Democratic Liberal Party of C\u00f3rdoba, the Catamarca Popular Movement, the Provincial Union of Entre R\u00edos, the Party of the Hope of the Province of Buenos Aires, the Independent Citizens of Tucum\u00e1n and the Federal North of Jujuy. L\u00f3pez Murphy as the movement's presidential candidate and Ricardo G\u00f3mez Diez of Salta for vice-president in the 2003 elections, ending in third place with 18%. In 2005 the party formed an alliance with Buenos Aires' party Commitment to Change led by Mauricio Macri. The alliance has attempted to form a wide-ranging center-right front, especially with Neuqu\u00e9n's party, the Neuquino People's Movement (Movimiento Popular Neuquino - MPN), for the 2005 parliamentary elections. Recrear and its allies won nine members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, with those of some of Recrear's constituent provincial parties. L\u00f3pez Murphy subsequently fell out with Jorge Sobisch, leader of the MPN, and formally teamed up with Commitment to Change to form a new centre-right electoral front, Republican Proposal (PRO). Following the election, L\u00f3pez Murphy stood down from the leadership of the Party and in 2008, Congressman Esteban Bullrich was elected to replace him. Bullrich backed the ongoing alliance with Macri and PRO, whilst L\u00f3pez Murphy had backed Castor L\u00f3pez, calling for the autonomy of the Party. In April 2008, L\u00f3pez Murphy resigned from the Party and later set up another new party, which has pursued closer ties with the Civic Coalition. In August 2009, the party was finally absorbed by the Republican Proposal. Recrear had observer status within both the Liberal International, and the conservative Union of Latin American Parties. ==Electoral history== ===Presidential elections=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Election year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Candidate(s) ! colspan=\"2\"| First Round ! colspan=\"2\"| Second Round ! rowspan=\"2\"| Result ! rowspan=\"2\"| Note |- ! # votes ! % vote ! # votes ! % vote |- ! 2007 | Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy | 273,015 | 1.43% | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccc;\"| | Defeated | as Recreate for Growth |- |} ==See also== *Liberalism worldwide *List of liberal parties ==References== ==External links== *Recreate for Growth official site Category:Liberal parties in Argentina Category:Political parties established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Argentina Category:Political parties disestablished in 2009 Category:2009 disestablishments in Argentina Category:Defunct political parties in Argentina ",
