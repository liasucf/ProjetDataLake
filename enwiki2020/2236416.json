    "text": "Giant is a song by Canadian folk singer-songwriter Stan Rogers. The Giant referred to is Fingal, an Irish-Scottish mythical giant. The song is set in Nova Scotia's rugged Cape Breton Island, and the lyrics contain enchanting imagery describing the island's landscape. The song also contains quasi-pagan imagery, including the suggestion of worshipping the new moon by dancing around a bonfire, although it may be that characters in the song are using the full moon to have a party. In the album Home in Halifax, Stan Rogers claimed that the song was about Guinness. Category:Stan Rogers songs ",
