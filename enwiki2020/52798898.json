The Maharajah of Scindia provided a carved sandstone gateway, the Gwalior Gateway, which after the exhibition was sent in 200 packages to London's Victoria and Albert Museum and then displayed at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in 1886. ==Officials== The fair officials included Augustus Rivers Thompson (president executive committee), S.T.Trevor (vice president of the committee) and Jules Joubert (general manager). ==Opening ceremony== The opening talk was by Lord Ripon and was attended by Governors of Bengal (also president of organising committee), Madras, and Bombay, several maharajas and the Duke and Duchess of Connaught.
