It was designed as a successor to the \u0160koda MU-2 tank. ==History== In 1932, the company \u0160koda tried to develop a new tank after the unsatisfactory \u0160koda MU-2. The result was the MU-4, made from a modified Carden-Loyd Mk. VI tankette chassis, which was entered into a competition for tankettes in the Czechoslovak Army, where it lost to the Tan\u010d\u00edk vz. 33. It was then entered into a competition for the Yugoslav Army, where it lost to both the Polish TK-3 (also developed from the Carden-Loyd) and the \u010cKD PI. The \u0160koda MU-4 was then offered to Afghanistan, Hungary, and Sweden, but was rejected by all of them. In the end, only a single prototype was made, which survived World War II. The prototype was acquired by the Military History Institute Prague in 1972 and was restored to running condition. The prototype is now in the Military Museum Le\u0161any where it is occasionally shown in exhibits. ==Bibliography== * MU-4 Category:Tankettes of the interwar period Category:Tankettes ",
