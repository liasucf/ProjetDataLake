Also, its route was the longest in the system, operating on a 179.5 mile route, exceeding the CNJ's Atlantic City-bound Blue Comet. The train left the Jersey City CNJ Communipaw Terminal, traveled south to Bayonne (but not stopping, until the train's later years),Official Guide of the Railways, June 1961, Central Railroad of New Jersey section traversed the harbor at Elizabethport, headed west along the CNJ's Main Line. It continued past Elizabeth's CNJ station, Plainfield Station, to High Point station and Hampton, the end point for the regular NJ Transit Raritan Valley Line commuter service. From there, the route continued to Phillipsburg's Union Station, Easton, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem's Bethlehem Station and Allentown's Allentown Station. From Allentown, the train traveled along the territory of the Reading Railroad, continuing west to Reading (Reading Outer station) and finally to Harrisburg. In the mid-1930s it ran six days a week.Official Guide of the Railways, August 1936, Central Railroad of New Jersey section, Table 1 In the early 1960s it was daily in operation. In the train's waning years in the mid-1960s the route was shortened to Allentown, owing to the loss of mail contracts. Following the creation of the new Aldene Connection in 1967 and the closure of the CNJ Terminal in New Jersey, the train was terminated. However, some commuter service on the Allentown to Newark (via the new Aldene Connection) continued. ==References== Category:Central Railroad of New Jersey Category:Named passenger trains of the United States Category:Passenger rail transportation in Pennsylvania Category:Passenger rail transportation in New Jersey Category:Railway services introduced in 1911 Category:Railway lines closed in 1967 ",
