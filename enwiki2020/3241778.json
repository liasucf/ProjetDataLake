    "text": "FC Homburg is a German association football club based in Homburg, Saarland. The club was founded on 15 June 1908 as Fussball Club Homburg by a group of seventeen young men at the local Hohenburg pub. == History == In February 1913 they were renamed Fussballverein Homburg and went on to take the local championship that season. By the mid-1920s the side was playing second- division football, but folded on 27 August 1936. A new multi-sport club known as VfL Homburg was formed 5 March 1937 out of a group of local sides that included Turnverein 1878 Homburg, Schwimmverein Homburg, Kraftsportverein Homburg, Boxclub Homburg, Tennis-Club Homburg, as well as the former membership of the defunct FV. The footballers again took up play in second- tier competition and failed in two attempts (1938, 1941) to win their way through the regional promotion playoff to the first division Gauliga S\u00fcdwest. After World War II, Allied occupation authorities dissolved all types of associations in Germany, including football clubs. The club was soon re- constituted as Sportverein Homburg and captured a division championship in the Amateurliga Saarland (III) in 1948 before resuming the name FC Homburg in January 1949. Historical chart of FC Homburg league performance after WWII The Saarland was occupied by the French who made various efforts to see the state become independent of Germany or join France. In sport this was manifested as separate 1952 Olympic and 1954 World Cup teams for Saarland, the establishment of a short-lived football league for the state, and the German club 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken playing in the French second division. Homburg played in the Saarland Ehrenliga from 1949 to 1951 as FC Homburg-Saar. By the time of the 1951\u201352 season the return of German teams to the German Football Association had been negotiated: the Ehrenliga faded away and by 1956 the independent Saarland Fussball Bund had re-joined the DFB. A second Amateurliga Saarland title in 1957 advanced FC to the 2. Liga-S\u00fcdwest (II) and in December of that year they adopted the name FC 08 Homburg/Saar. The club was relegated to the Amateurliga in 1960 which had become a fourth-tier circuit by 1963. In the late 1970s the team advanced to the quarter finals of the DFB-Pokal on two occasions, and on into the early 1980s moved frequently between third- and fourth-tier play. Then, in the second half of the decade, they enjoyed their greatest success. They played their way back to the second division and on into the Bundesliga in 1986. Homburg played two seasons there, were relegated, and returned for one final Bundesliga season in 1989\u201390 before beginning a gradual descent which would lead them to Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (IV) where they play today. The club had a moment of glory in 1991 when it beat FC Bayern Munich in Munich 4\u20132 after extra time in the first round of the 1991\u201392 DFB-Pokal.Shock defeats and a record victory FC Bayern Munich website, accessed: 13 November 2008 They were relegated from the 2. Bundesliga after the 1994\u201395 season. Along the way the club had a couple of misadventures. In 1988, the DFB prohibited the team from wearing the sponsorship logo of a condom manufacturer on ethical and moral grounds. In 1998, they entered into an agreement with 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken to loan players to that team to help ease Homburg's financial pinch. Despite this, in 1999, the club had a brush with bankruptcy that led to their being denied a license to play in the Regionalliga West/S\u00fcdwest (III) and demotion to the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (IV). The club qualified for the 2006\u201307 German Cup and went out in the first round 1\u20132 to Bundesliga side VfL Bochum. Homburg was finally promoted to Regionalliga West after finishing atop the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest ahead of FK Pirmasens on a goal differential of plus 2 in the 2009\u201310 season. Their Regionalliga cameo ended with a 17th place finish and a return to fifth tier play. Homburg immediately bounced back by capturing the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest title and qualifying for the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest (IV) for 2012\u201313. == Honours == The club's honours: === League === * German amateur championship ** Champions: 1983 * 2.
