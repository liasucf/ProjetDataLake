    "text": "Saint Michael defeating Satan Jost Haller was a 15th-century Gothic painter from Alsace, active in the years 1440\u20131470, first established in Strasbourg, then in Metz, and in Saarbr\u00fccken. He is also called The painter of the knights () [not \"The painter of knights\", or Le peintre de chevaliers]. Haller's name was forgotten until 1980, when art historian Charles Sterling rediscovered it and put it on a number of paintings and illuminated manuscripts that were hitherto attributed to anonymous masters, most famously among them the Tempelhof Altarpiece (ca. 1445) from Bergheim, Haut-Rhin (not to be confused with the Tempelhof district of Berlin!), an oil on panel painting wide and high, now kept in the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar. Haller is also thought to be the author of the fresco of Saint Michael defeating Satan, high and wide, of St Thomas' Church, Strasbourg. A bridge in Strasbourg, built 2006, is named after Jost Haller. == See also == *Hans Hirtz, active in Strasbourg at the same time *Master of the Drapery Studies, probable disciple of the former *Caspar Isenmann, Haller's colleague from Colmar == References == Category:Painters from Alsace Category:15th-century German painters Category:Gothic painters Category:People from Strasbourg Category:German male painters ",
