Approx. 305 as per Nakamura's addition of the numbers in the 5 sub-units of Byakkotai. young teenage samurai of the Aizu Domain, who fought in the Boshin War (1868\u20131869). ==History== The Byakkotai was part of Aizu's four-unit military, formed in April 1868 in the domain's drive to finalize its military modernization, in the wake of the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi.Noguchi, Aizu-han, pp. 169\u2013170. The other three units were the Genmutai (Black Tortoise Unit),Made up of men 50 years and older, tasked with city patrol in Wakamatsu and reserve duty, the Seiry\u016btai (Azure Dragon Unit),Made up of men 36 to 49 years old, tasked with border patrol and the Suzakutai (Vermilion Bird Unit). Made up of 18- to 35-year-old men, tasked with actual combatName readings as per Noguchi, p. 170; unit data as per Nakamura, pp. 23\u201325. Each of the four was named after the protecting gods of compass directions. Byakkotai was meant to be a reserve unit, as it was composed of the young, 16- to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai.Noguchi, p. 169 It was subdivided further, along the lines of rank within the domain's samurai population: two squads were from the upper (shich\u016b) rank, two from the middle rank (yoriai), and two from the lowest (ashigaru).Noguchi, p. 170; as per Nakamura, p. 30, the numbers in each subdivision were: Shichu 1: 37 Shichu 2: 37 Yoriai 1: 98 Yoriai 2: 62 Ashigaru: 71 Twenty of the members of the 2nd shich\u016b squad, cut off from the rest of their unit in the wake of the Battle of Tonoguchihara,Yamakawa, Aizu Boshin Senshi, pp. 521\u2013522. retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked the castle town. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire, and committed seppuku (with one failed attempt) in desperation, believing their lord and families dead.Yamakawa, Aizu Boshin Senshi, p. 522. However these 20 Byakkotai members were mistaken in their assessment of defeat, as the castle defenses had not actually been breached; the castle town surrounding the inner citadel was aflame. As the majority of the town was between Iimori Hill and the castle, the boys saw the rising smoke and assumed that the castle itself had fallen. The 19 Byakkotai members who committed suicide were the following:Yamakawa, Hosh\u016b Aizu Byakkotai J\u016bky\u016bshi- den, p. 1 *Adachi T\u014dzabur\u014d *Ishiyama Toranosuke *Shinoda Gisabur\u014d (acting commander) *Nagase Y\u016bji *Mase Genshichir\u014d *Aruga OrinosukeName reading as per Yamakawa, Hosh\u016b Aizu Byakkotai J\u016bky\u016bshi-den, p. 3 *It\u014d Teijir\u014d *Suzuki Genkichi *Nishikawa Sh\u014dtar\u014d *Yanase Katsusabur\u014d *Ikegami Shintar\u014d *It\u014d Toshihiko *Tsuda Sutez\u014d *Nomura Komashir\u014d *Yanase Takeji *Ishida Wasuke *Ibuka Shigetar\u014d *Tsugawa Kiyomi *Hayashi Yasoji The sole survivor, Iinuma Sadakichi, attempted suicide but was unsuccessful. He was saved by a local peasant. After the war, he moved to the nearby city of Sendai, and lived there until his death. He also served as an officer in the army (retiring with the rank of captain) and as an official of the local post office in Sendai.Yamakawa, Hosh\u016b Aizu Byakkotai j\u016bky\u016bshi-den, p. 28 After the war, their bodies remained exposed to the elements until permission was finally granted by the imperial government to bury them. A memorial was later erected at Iimori Hill, and all 20 of the Byakkotai members named above are buried there.Including Iinuma, who was initially buried in Sendai but whose hair and teeth were reinterred at Iimori Hill in 1958.

One notable TV depiction was produced in 1986; another, more recently, was the 2007 TV drama, which starred Yamashita Tomohisa, Tanaka Koki and Fujigaya Taisuke. Yamashita portrayed another Byakkotai survivor, Sakai Mineji.Mineji was in the same unit as the Byakkotai boys who committed suicide. See Yamakawa, Hosh\u016b Aizu Byakkotai J\u016bky\u016bshi-den, p. 111. A statue of the real Mineji can be seen at Iimori Hill. See http://oniheru.fc2web.com/douzou/sakai_mineji.htm The Byakkotai are featured as a unit exclusive to the Aizu clan in Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai. == See also == *Aizuwakamatsu Castle * Nihonmatsu Shonentai * Fukushima Museum ==Notes== ==References== *Nakamura Akihiko (2001).
