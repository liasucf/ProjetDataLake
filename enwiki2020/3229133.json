His mother was a mill worker and French polisher, and his father a carpenter. He lived in Kilbirnie until 1963, when his family moved to Australia, arriving in Darwin, Northern Territory before settling in the Melbourne suburb of Bentleigh. He worked as a bricklayer's labourer before studying at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), graduating in 1976 along with Linden Wilkinson and Michael Siberry. ==Acting career== Friels career began with work mostly in theatre and television. In 1980 Friels was a presenter on the Australian version of Play School, the series for young children. His first film role was in the unreleased Prisoners (1981), appearing with David Hemmings and Tatum O'Neal. His first appearance in a released film was in Hoodwink (1981), alongside his future wife, Judy Davis. In 1986, he played the title role in Malcolm, about a shy mechanical genius, for which he was awarded the 1986 AFI Award for Best Actor. Friels was also nominated for the Best Actor award the following year, for his role in Ground Zero, but did not win: the film received mixed reviews, with one describing him as \"a proficient enough actor, but...miscast\".Hinson, Hal (1988). Ground Zero (review), Washington Post, 30 September 1987. Friels later won another AFI Award in 1995 for his starring role in the 1994 Halifax f.p. telemovie Hard Corps. Friels has played a wide range of other roles. He was a megalomaniac corporate executive in the 1990 feature film Darkman. From 1996 to 1999, he played Frank Holloway on Water Rats,Australian Television Information Archive: Water Rats http://www.australiantelevision.net/water_rats/waterrats.html a role which won him the Logie Award for Most Outstanding Actor at the 1997 awards. In his acceptance speech he said, \"I'm very flattered for this and it's all rather silly, isn't it? So, thank you very much.\" Since 2003, Friels has appeared as the main character in the BlackJack series of telemovies. In 2010 he also starred in Killing Time where he played notorious underworld figure Lewis Moran. In 2018 he played Tony Ballantyne in the TV miniseries Mystery Road, again opposite Judy Davis. ==Personal life and views== In late 1997, Friels was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. However, his treatment was successful, and he is one of the very few sufferers of this disease to go into long-term remission. During his treatment he continued to work on the set of Water Rats, until eventually the impact of the chemotherapy stopped him working, and he chose to have his character written out of the series by sending him on a sailing journey around the world. At this time, however, he also continued his stage work, and was performing in Sydney Theatre Company's Macbeth. Friels has been married to actress Judy Davis since 1984; the couple have two children, Jack and Charlotte. They were briefly separated, but later reconciled. The relationship was briefly in the media when an argument led to a court order against Friels: however, they remained together at that time.Graeme Webber and Anthony Stavrinos, \"Judy Davis takes out violence order against Colin Friels\", The Age, 31 October 2002, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/30/1035683474314.html Friels believes that social and political awareness comes with acting, and is known for his engagement in policy debates, including industrial issues such as workplace relations and free trade. He publicly criticised Bush administration policy in the Middle East, and supported the Sydney Peace Foundation.Sydney Peace Foundation, Tell Me the Truth About Peace (event), 2005, http://www.spf.arts.usyd.edu.au/events_2005.shtml#TruthAboutPeace, retrieved May 2007. His engagement with social issues has been evident in his acting work, with two prominent examples being his lead role in Ground Zero, in which he played a cameraman investigating British nuclear testing in South Australia, and his appearance in the ABC television drama Bastard Boys, in which he played union official John Coombs. ==Filmography== * Hoodwink (1981) - Robert * Monkey Grip (1982) \u2013 Javo * Buddies (1983) \u2013 Mike * For the Term of His Natural Life (1983) - Rufus Dawes/Richard Devine * The Coolangatta Gold (1984) \u2013 Adam Lucas * Kangaroo (1986) \u2013 Richard Somers * Malcolm (1986) \u2013 Malcolm Hughes * Ground Zero (1987) \u2013 Harvey Denton * High Tide (1988) \u2013 Mick * Darkman (1990) \u2013 Louis Strack Jr * Weekend with Kate (1990) \u2013 Richard Muir * Class Action (1991) \u2013 Michael Grazier * Dingo (1992) \u2013 John Anderson * Police Rescue (1992) - Lew * Stark (1993) \u2013 Sly Morgan * A Good Man in Africa (1994) \u2013 Morgan Leafy * Angel Baby (1995) - Morris * Back of Beyond (1995) * Halifax f.p. episode \"Hard Corps\" (1995) - Det Snr Sgt Kevin Tait * Cosi (1996) \u2013 Errol * Mr. Reliable (1996) \u2013 Wally Mellish * Water Rats \u2013 Frank Holloway (91 episodes, 1996\u20131999) * Dark City (1998) \u2013 Eddie Walenski * The Man Who Sued God (2001) \u2013 David Myers * Black and White (2002) \u2013 Father Tom Dixon * BlackJack (2003-2007) \u2013 Jack Kempson * The Mystery of Natalie Wood (2004) - Nick Gurdin * Tom White (2004) \u2013 Tom White * Bastard Boys (2007) \u2013 John Coombs * The Informant (2008) \u2013 Doug Lamont * Gangs of Oz (2009) \u2013 Narrator * Blind Company (2009) - Geoff Brewster * Killing Time (2010) \u2013 Lewis Moran * Matching Jack (2010) - Professor Nelson * The Nothing Men (2010) - Jack Simpson * Tomorrow, When The War Began (2010) - Dr Clements * The Eye of the Storm (2011) \u2013 Athol Shreve * The Man Who Jumped (2011) - Narrator * Schapelle (2013) - Mick Corby * Sydney Sailboat (2015) - Terry (Voice) * The Secret Daughter (2016) - Jack Norton * Mystery Road (2018) \u2013 Tony Ballantyne ==Awards== ===Won=== * 2004 Film Critics Circle of Australia Best Actor \u2013 Male (Tom White) * 2004 Lexus IF Award Best Actor (Tom White) * 2003 Australian Entertainment \"Mo\" Award Best Actor \u2013 Play (Copenhagen) * 2003 Helpmann Award Best Male Actor \u2013 Play (Copenhagen) * 1997 Logie Award Most Outstanding Actor (Water Rats) * 1995 Australian Film Institute Award Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Drama (Halifax f.p.: Hard Corps) * 1986 Australian Film Institute Award Best Actor in a Lead Role (Malcolm) ===Nominated=== * 2006 Film Critics Circle of Australia Best Actor (Solo) * 2006 Film Critics Circle of Australia Best Supporting Actor (The Book of Revelation) * 2004 Australian Film Institute Award Best Actor in a Lead Role (Tom White) * 2000 Logie Award Most Outstanding Actor in a Series (Water Rats) * 1991 Australian Film Institute Award Best Actor in a Lead Role (Dingo) * 1987 Australian Film Institute Award Best Actor in a Lead Role (Ground Zero) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1952 births Category:Australian male film actors Category:Australian people of Scottish descent Category:Australian television presenters Category:Best Actor AACTA Award winners Category:Cancer survivors Category:Children's television presenters Category:Helpmann Award winners Category:Living people Category:Logie Award winners Category:National Institute of Dramatic Art alumni Category:Pancreatic cancer survivors Category:People from Kilwinning Category:Scottish male film actors ",
