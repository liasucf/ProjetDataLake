    "text": "AMERICAblog is a liberal American blog founded by John Aravosis in April 2004, with several co-bloggers. The blog helped expose Jeff Gannon in 2005, and in 2006 helped make cell phone privacy an issue by obtaining General Wesley Clark's call records. The blog focuses on U.S. politics. == Members == * John Aravosis, lawyer, journalist, Democratic political consultant, and civil rights advocate served five years as the senior foreign policy adviser to United States Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK), and wrote as a stringer for the Economist.John Aravosis bio on LinkedIn * Joe Sudbay, Democratic political consultant and former gun control activist, held staff positions with Violence Policy Center, and Handgun Control, Inc.CNN.com * Chris Ryan, who lives in Paris, France. * Steven Kyle, a professor in economics at Cornell University. * Naomi Seligman, a communications professional from Santa Monica, California. == History == AMERICAblog first received widespread media attention after it revealed that Jeff Gannon, a member of the White House press corps with a reputation for asking 'softball' questions at opportune moments for Press Secretary Scott McClellan, was actually James Guckert and had advertised his services as an escort.(\"The latest developments were first reported by John Aravosis, a liberal political consultant and gay activist who has a Web site called americablog.org. 'What struck me initially was the hypocrisy angle,' Aravosis said. He said he was offended by what he called Gannon's 'antigay' writing.\")(\"Joe Strupp wrote in Editor & Publisher ... 'In addition, evidence emerged on the site Americablog yesterday suggesting that Guckert not only set up sex sites but also offered his services as a male prostitute. When asked by E&P; today about such accusations, Gannon declined to confirm or deny. \"I am not going to talk about that,\" he said.'\")(Americablog \"has been instrumental in breaking news on 'Gannongate.'\" In 2006, Aravosis learned that a number of commercial websites were selling people's private cell phone records, and that the practice was legal. In order to publicize what he considered a problem, Aravosis purchased the call records of former presidential candidate and Supreme Allied Commander of NATO General Wesley Clark for $89.95, and then published the records (with the numbers blacked out) on AMERICAblog, bringing the issue widespread attention. Republished on the Common Dreams NewsCenter. In September 2006, California passed a state law banning the practice of pretexting, or pretending to be someone else, used by the websites, with the bill's sponsor specifically citing the AMERICAblog coverage. Clark became an advocate of cell record privacy bills in Congress. Within months, Congress passed a law restricting these records. In 2011, Aravosis received a tip that British oil giant BP (British Petroleum) was posting falsified photos to its website during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He analyzed the photos, then published an article on AMERICAblog proving that the images were doctored electronically. The story received widespread coverage in the media. == Rankings == A study of blogs and the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election ranked AMERICAblog as the 18th most popular liberal blog for October\u2013November 2004.Adamic, Lada and Glance, Natalie, The Political Blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. Election: Divided They Blog(March 4, 2005) In 2005, less than one year after its launch, AMERICAblog was ranked fifth in page views among all political blogs in an analysis done by MyDD.
