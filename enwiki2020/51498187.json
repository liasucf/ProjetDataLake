Educated to teach mathematics, she taught in various schools in Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski from 1953 to 1984 and was honored for her skill as an educator. She helped found the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski branch of the Catholic Intellectuals Club as well as the regional branch of Solidarity. Her activism during Poland's struggle for democracy was widely recognized at both the local and national level and she was honored with numerous medals and awards. ==Early life== Teresa Maria Tomaszewska-Bo\u0144cza was born on 11 October 1929 in Hrubiesz\u00f3w, Poland to the noble families of Stanis\u0142aw Bo\u0144cza-Tomaszewski and Marii Skrzetuskiej. After her parent's divorce, Tomaszewska-Bo\u0144cza was raised by her maternal grandparents Kazimierza Skrzetuskiego and Maria (n\u00e9e Dobrowolska) Skrzetuska. She was the great-granddaughter of Antoni Skrzetuski, who was honored for his military service in the January Uprising. The family moved often during the war, living in Wrzesnia, Zwierzyniec, Przeworsk and Mogilno, before she entered high school in 1944. In 1949, she graduated from the in Gniezno and went on to further her studies at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144 (UAM), studying mathematics from 1949 to 1952. ==Career== After graduation, Tomaszewska-Bo\u0144cza studied briefly at the Polish Naval Academy and then between 1952 and 1953 she taught at a vocational school in Gdynia. In 1953, Tomaszewska-Bo\u0144cza married , moved to Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski and taught at the Gastronomic Technical College () for two years. In 1957, she began teaching at the Chemical Technical College (), where she remained until 1972. She completed a master's degree UAM in 1966 and in 1976 completed her post- graduate studies in computer science at the University of Warsaw. Between 1972 and 1984 she taught mathematics at the in Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski. During this time frame, she also worked on an experimental project between 1976 and 1980 launched in high schools by the Science Ministry. Klimek retired from teaching in 1984. In the 1970s, Klimek helped organize the Catholic Intellectuals Club (), which she and her husband W\u0142adys\u0142aw had founded. KIK's purpose was to stimulate independent thought and bring Catholics within Poland information about Catholic philosophy from countries outside the Socialist Bloc. Though it had to operate illegally and could not be registered until 1981, the group challenged authorities and openly promoted the organization. Beginning in 1980, Klimek was also engaged in the business of the Polish Trade Union, \"Solidarity\" (). Solidarity's goals were to bring about socio-economic reforms by changing the political system. Klimek promoted the organization in schools, encouraging students to found an independent student organization. She served on the regional board and was a delegate to the provincial congress as a Solidarity delegate. From 1980 to 1981 Klimek served on an assistance committee for prisoners of conscience and provided care for members who were imprisoned. She was interned between 15 December 1981 and 27 June 1982 in camps in Poznan and Go\u0142dap, during the implementation of martial law in Poland. Martial law was imposed to frighten people and make them think that Polish Communism was strong and could not be overthrown. After her release, Klimek worked in the Catholic Underground in support of Solidarity. Crucial to the underground's success was the underground press and in Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski, Klimek's husband W\u0142adys\u0142aw edited several journals and wrote articles for Solidarity. Under the pseudonym \"Simeon and Agnik\", in 1983 Klimek wrote the activist's song \"Feniksa\" (Phoenix). In 1986, Klimek was involved in the reactivation of Solidarity and became a member of the Regional Executive Committee for the union. Klimek initiated the Gorz\u00f3w Committee for the Memory of the Victims of Katyn and was made an honorary member of Gorz\u00f3w's Katyn Families. ==Death and legacy== Klimek died on 29 December 2013 in Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski. Both during her lifetime, and posthumously, Klimek was decorated for her activism and excellence as an educator. She was recipient of the Merit Award for Gorzowski Region (1998); Gold Badge of the National Section of Education NSZZ \"S\" (2005); Pro Memoria Medal (2005); Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (2009); Merit for the Lubuskie Province (2009); Merit Award for the City of Gorzow (2010), Silver Medal of the (2010), Award of the Region Gorzowski NSZZ \"S\" (2010), (2013); and Cross of Freedom and Solidarity (2015) == References == ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * Category:1929 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Hrubiesz\u00f3w Category:Polish women Category:Polish educators Category:Polish trade unionists ",
