Autoroute 440 (or A-440, also known as Autoroute Jean-No\u00ebl-Lavoie and previously as Autoroute Laval) is a provincial highway that runs across the city of Laval, Quebec from Autoroute 13 to Autoroute 25. It is currently long and proceeds across \u00cele J\u00e9sus on an east\u2013west axis. It links every highway or expressway that connects Montreal to the North Shore. Originally, it would have continued west in the Avenue des Bois corridor and crossed Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies on Bigras and Bizard Islands. On the latter island, the right-of-way is actually a public park. On the Island of Montreal, the A-440 right-of-way is just west of Boulevard Chateau-Pierrefonds. The autoroute would have ended at the Chemin Sainte-Marie interchange (Exit 49) on Autoroute 40. *Western terminus: Av. Des Bois (Ste-Doroth\u00e9e neighbourhood) (km 16) *Eastern terminus: Autoroute 25 (St-Vincent-De-Paul neighbourhood) (km 34) *Lowest Annual Average Daily Traffic: 13 500 vpd (between R-117 and Avenue des Bois) (2000) *Highest Annual Average Daily Traffic: 131 000 vpd (between Des Laurentides blvd. and Industriel blvd.)
