It is endemic to the waters off South Africa.Franchini, P., et al. (2010). Karyotype and genome size estimation of Haliotis midae: estimators to assist future studies on the evolutionary history of Haliotidae. Journal of Shellfish Research, 29(4), 945-950. ==Description== The holotype was 55 by 39.5 millimeters long and 12 millimeters thick. The shell is an elongated oval with chestnut brown mottling and pale olive flecks. The sculpture has radiating, slanting threads on the whorlss, which are fine, becoming coarser on the last turn. The spiraling lira become less wavy toward the anterior side. The nacre is pinkish inside and more red in the spire. The spiral sculpture is visible on the inside.
