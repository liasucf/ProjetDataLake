    "text": "Summer in the Golden Valley (Original title in Bosnian: Ljeto u zlatnoj dolini) is a 2003 Bosnian film by Sr\u0111an Vuleti\u0107, produced by Ademir Kenovi\u0107. The movie is about a 16-year-old boy who has to repay his dead father's debt. In order to collect money, his friend and he get involved in Sarajevo's underground crime. == Plot == At the traditional Muslim funeral service for his father, Fikret Varupa a sixteen-year-old boy from Sarajevo, learns that his father owes money to Hamid, a man he does not even know. The debt is considerable and Hamid does not want it to go to the grave with the body, so the debt automatically passes from the father to the son. Since in Bosnia this way of collecting debts, at a funeral, is considered to be utterly humiliating, it is never, ever applied. Fikret and his entire family become subjects of ridicule. Fikret, who is practically still a child, is decisive to \"redeem his father's soul\". Wishing to repay his father's debt and to secure the forgiveness, Fikret wanders into the real world of Sarajevo, the world that is ruled by post-war chaos, misery and poverty and becomes an ideal target for two corrupted policemen who wish to \"help\" him: they plant the kidnapped girl on him. ==Cast== * Haris Sijari\u0107 as Fikret * Svetozar Cvetkovi\u0107 as Ramiz * Kemal \u010cebo as Tiki * Zana Marjanovi\u0107 as Sara * Emir Had\u017eihafizbegovi\u0107 as Hamid * Aleksandar Seksan as Cico * Sad\u017eida \u0160eti\u0107 as Majka * Admir Glamo\u010dak as Klupa * Dragan Jovi\u010di\u0107 as Jasmin * Sa\u0161a Petrovi\u0107 as Shopkeeper * \u00d0ani Jaha as \u0160pico * Miraj Grbi\u0107 as \u0106upo * Maja Salki\u0107 as Air Hostess #1 * Amar Bekte\u0161evi\u0107 as Child actor * D\u017eenana Nik\u0161i\u0107 as Selma * Senad Ba\u0161i\u0107 as Ispijeni * Moamer Kasumovi\u0107 as Boy sitting on bench #2 ==Awards and nominations== ===Wins=== *Bermuda International Film Festival - Jury Prize - 2004 *Golden Iris - Brussels European Film Festival - 2004 *Tiger Award - Rotterdam International Film Festival - 2004 *MovieZone Award - Rotterdam International Film Festival - 2004 *Sofia International Film Festival - Special Jury Award - 2004 *Sofia International Film Festival - FIPRESCI Prize - 2004 ===Nominations=== *Sofia International Film Festival - Grand Prix - 2004 *Sarajevo Film Festival - The Heart of Sarajevo (Best Film Award) ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack for the film, released as Zlatna Dolina, was compiled by Edo Maajka. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"center\"|# !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Performer !align=\"center\"|Featured guest(s) |- |1 |\"Zlatna Dolina\" |Edo Maajka |Goldn valley |- |2 |\"Jeste Li Spremni\" |DJ \u010ceki\u0107 |Are you ready |- |3 |\"Jaran\" |Rima D |Friend |- |4 |\"BTS (Bust The System)\" |Disciplinska Komisija |Billy |- |5 |\"Suze\" |Mar\u010delo |Edo Maajka |- |6 |\"Home Team\" |DJ \u010ceki\u0107 |Amon Ra and Verbalitics |- |7 |\"U\u0161tekaj se\" |Sove |Connect yourself |- |8 |\"Svijet\" |Mu\u010deni\u010dka Grupa |world |- |9 |\"Pismo Majci\" |Rima D |Letter to mother |- |10 |\"Amon Racija\" |Amon Ra |Amon \"fever\" |- |} ==External links== * *Official Website Category:2003 films Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina films Category:Serbo-Croatian-language films Category:Films set in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:2000s crime films ",
