His essay on growing up with online media, \"Instant Message, Instant Girlfriend,\" was published by the New York Times in 2008.

He wrote his senior thesis on the narratology of suspense in the mysteries of Edgar Allan Poe, working under the supervision of Professor Robert Knapp. Roger's friends also knew him as a talented composer and performer of tabletop role-playing games, including Eon, which was played at Reed College from 2007 to 2013.
