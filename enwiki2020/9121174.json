Like Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez's poem Mart\u00edn Fierro, its protagonist is a gaucho. However, unlike Hernandez's poem, Don Segundo Sombra does not romanticize the figure of the gaucho, but simply examines the character as a shadow (sombra) cast across Argentine history. Unlike Martin Fierro, purely an imaginary character, Don Segundo Sombra was loosely inspired by the real life of Segundo Ram\u00edrez, a native of the town of San Antonio de Areco in Buenos Aires Province. The life of Don Segundo Sombra made it to the big screen in 1969 in an Argentine production of a film by Manuel Ant\u00edn. Ricardo G\u00fciraldes, a friend of Jorge Luis Borges \u2013 they both founded the legendary magazine Proa \u2013, managed to develop a simple and modern language, a high quality mixture of literacy and colourful local expressions that earned him a major standing among the best representatives of \"criollismo.\" Even though it may be considered as a continuity with Martin Fierro, more than an extinguished gaucho elegy don Segundo Sombra proposes new ethical examples to a youth that G\u00fciraldes considered disoriented and restless. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1926 novels Category:Argentine novels Category:Novels set in Argentina Sombra Sombra Category:Argentine novels adapted into films ",
