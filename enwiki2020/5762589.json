    "text": "Burnaby Lake Rugby Club is a rugby club based in Burnaby, British Columbia. == History == The Burnaby Lake Rugby Club was formed in 1994 when two Metro Vancouver rugby clubs, the Burnaby Buffaloes and the Vancouver Trojans, merged. Because the Buffaloes played in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union and the Trojans played in the Vancouver Rugby Union, these two clubs did not have long-standing rivalries, which accounted a great deal for the success of the merger. As a result of the merger the newly formed Burnaby Lake Rugby Club (BLRC) became one of the larger clubs in the Metro Vancouver Area, consistently fielding teams at the most competitive levels in British Columbia. The BLRC also has a long-standing association with Justice Rugby Club. The Justice Rugby Club is a social rugby club, that plays non-league invitational matches in Canada and abroad. The membership of Justice Rugby consists of police officers in the Metro Vancouver area and their friends. Many of these members are also members of the BLRC. The Burnaby Lake Rugby Club first played in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union (FVRU) after the merger in 1994. However, the BLRC membership voted to join the Vancouver Rugby Union (VRU) during the 1995/1996 Annual General Meeting and the BLRC was accepted as a member of the VRU in 1996, where it has stayed a member since. == Teams == The BLRC fields four Senior Men's teams.
