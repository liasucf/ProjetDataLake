    "text": "W8XH was a Buffalo, New York \"experimental audio broadcasting station\", owned by the Buffalo Evening News, which operated from 1934 to 1939. It was the first \"Apex\" broadcasting station, i.e. the first to transmit programming intended for the general public over what was then known as \"ultra-high short- wave\" frequencies. W8XH primarily simulcast programming originating from a co- owned AM radio station, WBEN, but it also aired some original programs. It ceased broadcasting in July 1939, after the newspaper began to focus on operation of an experimental facsimile broadcasting station, W8XA, which in turn shut down shortly prior to World War II and was succeeded after the war by the FM broadcasting station known in the 21st Century as WTSS. ==History== The Buffalo Evening News first became involved with radio broadcasting in 1930, when it took over local radio station WMAK, which it renamed WBEN.\"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 30, 1930, page 15. WBEN's staff soon began an ambitious series of research and development. In mid-1932 WBEN was issued licenses for two low-power transmitters, W8XD on 60.0 MHz, and W8XH on 51.4 MHz,\"General and special experimental stations\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 30, 1932, page 7. The \"8\" in the call signs indicated that the stations were located in the 8th radio district, while the \"X\" reflected their operation as experimental stations. which were 10-watt portable units,\"One of WBEN's Two New Short-Wave Transmitters\", Buffalo Evening News, July 23, 1932, page 7. capable of being \"strapped across the shoulders of one of WBEN's engineers\".\"Portable Transmitter to Aid WBEN in Covering Centennial\", Buffalo Evening News, July 1, 1932, page 16. At this time W8XD and W8XH were both used for remote pickups to relay programming for broadcasting by WBEN. In the early 1930s, technical advances made it possible to transmit at much higher frequencies than before, and a number of organizations independently began applying for experimental licenses in order to investigate the potential of was then known as \"ultra- high short-wave\" transmissions. These signals tended to be limited to line-of- sight coverage, so there was a premium on placing antennas at high elevations, which led to the stations as a group becoming informally known as \"Apex\" stations. W8XH's experimental license was upgraded from its previous status as a relay transmitter, and it became first Apex station to be used for broadcasting entertainment to the general public. Regular broadcasts under this new configuration were begun on March 18, 1934, initially at 51.4 MHz (5.8 meters),\"WBEN Short-Wave Station To Begin Broadcasts Sunday\", Buffalo Evening News, March 17, 1934, page 4. and by April it was announced that the station was broadcasting five hours a day.\"Features Planned For Ultra Waves\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, April 13, 1934, page 34. The next month W8XH was reassigned to 41.0 MHz (7.3 meters), which it would use for the remainder of its broadcasts.\"W8XH to Change Wave Length Soon\", Buffalo Evening News, May 19, 1934, page 5. A review of W8XH's early operations, written by a WBEN technician, summarized its activities as: Because W8XH was operating under an experimental license, original programming had to be commercial-free. However, programs simulcast from WBEN were allowed to include the original commercials. W8XH underwent a major upgrade in January 1936,\"Short Wave Listener: Mechanism of New W8XH Explained\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, January 11, 1936, page 7. with the installation of a new 100-watt RCA designed transmitter,\"W8XH, New High Frequency Station\" by R. J. Kingsley, Broadcast News, April 1936, pages 22, 31 (reprinted from Electronics) that fed into a crossed-dipole antenna, known as a \"turnstile antenna\", that had been developed by RCA's Dr. G. H. Brown. The antenna was mounted on a 70-foot (21 m) pole atop the Hotel Statler, 350 feet (105 m) above ground.\"'Turnstile' Antenna Array at W8XH\", Short Wave Craft, July 1936, page 138. (W8XH's original transmitter was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.)\"W8XH high- frequency radio broadcast transmitter\" National Museum of American History (americanhistory.si.edu) Although operating on a frequency expected to be high enough to eliminate skywave signals, under certain solar conditions the ionosphere became reflective enough to affect W8XH's transmissions, and in April 1937 station engineers were shocked to receive two reception reports from listeners across the Atlantic Ocean in England.\"Short Wave Listener: Two Receivers in England Hear Buffalo's W8XH, Excelling Old Record of 60-Mile Transmission\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, April 3, 1937, page 7. In October 1937, it was announced that W8XH's hours had expanded from five to seventeen hours a day.\"Short Wave Listener\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, October 24, 1936, page 7. However, eventually the station's programming, especially programs separate from WBEN, began to decline. On March 4, 1939 a new schedule was announced of 6:30 p.m. to midnight, daily except weekends.\"Short Wave Listener\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, March 4, 1939, page 5. There apparently was no formal announcement when W8XH ultimately ended operations. The July 3, 1939 issue of the Buffalo Evening News listed it as relaying the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) Red Network programming carried by WBEN from 1:00 to 5:00 and 5:45 to 9:00 p.m.\"Monday Evening Programs: Other Local and Nearby Stations: W8XH\", Buffalo Evening News, July 3, 1939, page 13. However, two days later references to the station ceased.\"Other Local and Nearby Stations\", Buffalo Evening News, July 5, 1939, page 19. In addition, although W8XH had been included in the Apex station lists in the 1938 and 1939 editions of Broadcasting Yearbook, it did not appear in the January 15, 1940 listing included in the 1940 edition.\"High Frequency Broadcasting Stations in the United States\" (Authorized by FCC as of January 15, 1940), Broadcasting Yearbook (1940), page 374. In December 1938, the News began a regular facsimile broadcast service, initially transmitted by WBEN during overnight hours.\"Real Newspaper Delivered Through Ether\", Buffalo Evening News, December 18, 1938, page 18. Facsimile broadcasting employed dedicated equipment to receive the transmissions and print a special edition of the newspaper, that was limited to a few pages. In April 1939, the News announced that it had received a license to transfer the transmissions from WBEN to a new \"experimental facsimile broadcasting station\", W8XA,\"Short Wave Listener: W8XA, WBEN's New High-Frequency Transmitter Is to Be Used for Facsimile Broadcasting\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, April 8, 1939, page 5. which employed much of the equipment originally used by W8XH.\"WBEN Gets License\", Buffalo Evening News, March 7, 1939, page 17. By August the new station was operating on 43.7 MHz.\"Short Wave Listener\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, August 12, 1939, page 5. However, the newspaper ended the facsimile transmissions in December 1940.\"Short Wave Listener\" by Earnest H. Roy, Buffalo Evening News, December 21, 1940, page 5. WBEN was awarded a new license to broadcast using frequency modulation in 1944 at 43.3 MHz, a short distance down from W8XA. This FM station would not reach the air, but by 1946, its license (now moved up into the standard FM broadcast band) was used for the station now known as WTSS. ==References== Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1934 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1939 Category:1934 establishments in New York (state) Category:1939 disestablishments in New York (state) 8XH ",
