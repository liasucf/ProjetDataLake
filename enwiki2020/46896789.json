When he shows up for his first day, however, his boss, Brian Bender tells Will that the position promised to him was lost due to downsizing. He is obligated to find another position quickly to make rent for the house he shares with his three friends: Luke, Ethan, and Charlie. When he returns to his father, Roger Davis, for money, Roger reveals he recently lost his job as well. In desperation, Will takes a position as the night manager for a motel. On his first night, Will allows a pimp named Skeezy D to use the motel for his prostitutes. He loses his job the next morning when his boss lets him take the fall in front of the police that arrest Skeezy D. Will ends up succeeding in the video production industry and eventually turns down a promotion and another job offer in order to, instead, start his own video production company. He makes a video interview for his dad, Roger, who also successfully regains employment. His girlfriend, Jillian, is shown handling a business meeting with confidence. In the final credits Ethan, one of the roommates, also finds success in his iStalkU app, which allows you to trace someone's exact location, by sending a text to their cell phone. ==Cast== * Miles Teller as Will Davis * Anna Kendrick as Jillian Stewart * Brandon T.

Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review writing, in comparison to We Are Your Friends: \"Those guys might not have had college degrees, but they had attitude, hustle and a bit of soul \u2014 all things the shallow, insipid young characters in Get a Job, as well as the film itself, are sorely missing\". Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club wrote, \"Honestly, it would probably have been better for almost everyone involved \u2014 especially Kidd \u2014 had Get A Job been left on the shelf permanently. All it can do now is embarrass some young actors who\u2019ve already moved on to bigger and better things.\" ==References== ==External links== * Official Site * * Category:2016 films Category:2016 comedy films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:Workplace comedy films Category:CBS Films films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films set in Los Angeles ",
