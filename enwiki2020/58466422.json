    "text": "Anne Arnold Madden, Ph.D. is an American biologist, inventor, and science communicator who advocates for finding \"microbial solutions to human problems.\" Madden\u2019s research on microscopic life is often featured in the press, particularly her studies on the microbial community of food, using advanced DNA techniques to create the first atlas of arthropods in USA homes, investigating the microscopic life in dust, and using insect yeasts for ethanol production and beer brewing. Her research on insect-associated microorganisms lead to a patent application on the use of the yeast Lachancea thermotolerans for beer brewing and the first commercialization of primary souring yeasts for making sour beer. She first isolated the yeast from wasps and bumblebees. This technology formed the basis of the biotechnology company Lachancea LLC. Madden discovered and named the species Mucor nidicola, a fungus that lives inside the nests of wasps. Madden presented at the TED2017 conference in Vancouver, BC. She has also presented at other TED events such as TEDxCharlotte and TEDxGateway. She was featured in the award-winning science documentary film \"The Kingdom: How Fungi Made Our World.\" She is the founder of The Microbe Institute, an interdisciplinary resource for microbial discovery with a focus on education, art and discovery. The Microbe Institute also features a fellowship program that supports individuals in pursuing short (typically < 6 month) interdisciplinary projects related to microbes. She has some of the most famous hair in science, as the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists\u2014a group associated with the Ig Nobel Award\u2014named her woman of the year in 2015. ==Selected publications== *The Microscopic Alchemist.
