    "text": "thumb thumb The Langenprozelten Pumped Storage Station is a pumped storage power station near Gem\u00fcnden am Main at the Main in the under-Frankish district Main Spessart (Bavaria), which went in service in 1976. The hydro-electric power plant has an output of . It uses two Francis turbines. The reservoirs are connected by long pipes. The maximum head is . The upper reservoir has a capacity of approximately . The maximum energy store ability amounts to . The station produces traction current only and is an important peak load power station in the traction network for railways. The lower reservoir is fed by a creek, which is mostly dry in the summer. Therefore, if necessary, water is pumped from a further retention basin, which is situated below the lower reservoir. Both dams (of upper and lower reservoir) are rock fill embankment dams with an asphaltic concrete external sealing. Coordinates are those of the lower reservoir. ==Notes== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1976 Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Germany Category:Pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations in Germany ",
