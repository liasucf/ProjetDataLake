    "text": "The 1976 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State University in the Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8) during the 1976 NCAA Division I football season. In their only season under head coach Jackie Sherrill, the Cougars compiled a 3\u20138 record (2\u20135 in Pac-8, sixth), and were outscored 331 to 240. The team's statistical leaders included Jack Thompson with 2,762 passing yards, Dan Doornink with 422 rushing yards, and Mike Levenseller with 1,124 receiving yards. Senior quarterback John Hopkins injured a knee in the second game making a tackle; sophomore Thompson relieved him and again the following week, then became the starter for the rest of the season. A home game was played in Seattle at the newly- opened Kingdome, against eleventh-ranked USC. Previous home games in Seattle in 1972 and 1974 were at Husky Stadium. Previously the defensive coordinator at Pittsburgh, Sherrill was hired in late December 1975, but coached just one season in Pullman, leaving in early December to return to the Panthers as head coach. A week later, he was succeeded at WSU by Warren Powers, the defensive backfield coach at Nebraska. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL Draft== For the first time in six years, no Cougars were selected in the 1977 NFL Draft; eight WSU players were selected the next year. * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== ==External links== *Game program: USC vs. WSU at Seattle \u2013 October 9, 1976 *Game program: Stanford at WSU \u2013 October 23, 1976 *Game program: Oregon State at WSU \u2013 November 6, 1976 *Game program: Washington vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 November 20, 1976 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Washington ",
