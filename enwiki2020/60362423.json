    "text": "Constance Power (born 1995; known professionally as Connie Constance) is an English singer/songwriter from Watford. She released her debut album, English Rose, on 21 March 2019. The album is produced by Jim Abbiss, who has also produced material for artists including Adele and the Arctic Monkeys. Growing up, Constance listened to bands like The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Arctic Monkeys and Blur. \"In school, I would hang around with all the white kids who were into indie and rock'n'roll. And then all my friends outside of school were black and mixed race, so they were into more hip hop and R&B;\", she said. Constance trained as a dancer and was accepted to the Urdang Academy. After leaving the school in 2014, she worked with producer Kwesi Darko, with whom she released her debut EP, 'In The Grass' in 2015. Constance's debut album English Rose was released on 22 March 2019. Reviewing, Pitchfork noted that \"Constance\u2019s voice takes on scratchy, sonorous depth that brings to mind the subterranean soul of fellow London artists Nil\u00fcfer Yanya and King Krule.\" Clash noted that her songs have been described as 'indie-soul'. The BBC described her as a \"rising UK pop star\". In May 2019, she performed at The Great Escape Festival in Brighton. ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from Watford Category:British female singers Category:British singer-songwriters Category:21st-century British singers Category:21st-century women singers ",
