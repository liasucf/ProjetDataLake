    "text": "Battle of Martini\u0107i was the battle between Montenegrins and Ottomans which took place on the outskirts of the village Martini\u0107i, near Spu\u017e, Montenegro. Following the unification of Montenegro with Brda, the Ottoman governor of the Sanjak of Scutari launched a military offensive onto Montenegrin territory. Two Montenegrin divisions, led by Prince-bishop Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 and guvernadur Jovan Radonji\u0107, containing 3,000 men, took positions near Martini\u0107i. The Ottomans advanced towards Martini\u0107i from Spu\u017e with 18000 men, fighting guerilla resistance for nine days, before launching an assault on Montenegrin positions on 11 July. Montenegrins counter-attacked and the Ottomans suffered significant casualties. The result of this victory, followed by another victory at Krusi was the unification of Piperi and Bjelopavli\u0107i clan regions, previously occupied by the Ottoman Empire, with Montenegro. ==See also== *Battle of Krusi *Battle of Lopate ==References== * Pavi\u0107evi\u0107, Branko, O prvom pohodu Mahmuta Bu\u0161atlije na Crnu Goru, Istoriski \u010dasopis, Belgrade, 1956, pp. 153\u2013167. * Vojna Enciklopedija, Belgrade, 1973, knjiga peta, pp. 316\\.
