Mayrisch established many non-governmental organisations and was President of the Luxembourg Red Cross. She married \u00c9mile Mayrisch. ==Life== Saint-Hubert was the daughter of Xavier de Saint-Hubert, and sister of Jeanne de Saint-Hubert, who had married Xavier Brasseur the previous year (and would marry Brasseur's cousin, Robert Brasseur, in 1914).Mersch (1963), p. 471 She married the industrialist \u00c9mile Mayrisch, who would become President of the steel giant Arbed, on 15 September 1894. Together, they lived in Dudelange. The first of many organisations that she set up was the 'League for the Defence of the Women's Interests' () in 1905.Mersch (1963), p. 471 Saint-Hubert offered the patronage to Hereditary Grand Duchess Marie-Adelaide, but she declined, as a Roman Catholic feminist organisation was due to be set up. The league's main purposes was to seek the establishment of public girls' schools, which gained momentum with the League's creation of the associated Association for the Creation of a School for Young Girls. This campaign achieved success in 1911 when the Chamber of Deputies unanimously voted to establish publicly funded girls' schools in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur- Alzette.Mersch (1963), p. 472 At the same time, Mayrisch persuaded a group of other prominent Luxembourgian ladies to establish the Association of Girl Guides. She was active in work for charitable organisations such as the Luxembourgish League against Tuberculosis, and the Luxembourgish Red Cross, as well as advocating for the professionalisation of social work. On the outbreak of the First World War, Saint-Hubert set up a hospital near Dudelange, for the aid of servicemen of either side. After the war, she played a key role in setting up the Luxembourgian League Against Tuberculosis, of which she was Vice-President. She and her husband \u00c9mile were the main donors to the League and her other endeavours over the years.Mersch (1963), p. 472\u20133 She soon became involved in the Luxembourg Red Cross, being appointed a member of its administrative council in 1926, Vice-President after the death of \u00c9mile in 1928, and President in 1933.Mersch (1963), p. 473 She and her husband moved to Colpach in 1920, and after the war they received many German and French intellectuals here under the name of Cercle de Colpach, such as Paul Claudel, Jean Gu\u00e9henno, Jacques Rivi\u00e8re, Karl Jaspers, Bernard Groethuysen, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Jean Schlumberger, Ernst Robert Curtius, Annette Kolb and Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. They turned their old house in Dudelange into a home for children, the Fondation Kreuzberg. During World War II, she lived in Cabris in the south of France. == Art and literature == Aline Mayrisch had a great interest in arts and literature and saw herself as a mediator between the German and French cultural worlds. From 1898, she published articles on German painters and literary criticisms, amongst others on L'Immoraliste by Andr\u00e9 Gide, in the Belgian avant-gardist review L'Art moderne. She maintained friendships and correspondences with numerous writers and intellectuals, such as Andr\u00e9 Gide, Jean Schlumberger, Jacques Rivi\u00e8re, Henri Michaux, Marie and Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe, Marie Delcourt, Alexis Curvers, Annette Kolb, Gertrude Eysoldt, Ernst Robert Curtius and Bernhard Groethuysen. In 1914, she accompanied Andr\u00e9 Gide and Henri Gh\u00e9on to Turkey and in 1927, she travelled to the Gironde and the Limousin with Ernst Robert Curtius. In Colpach Castle, she arranged Franco-German encounters at which Andr\u00e9 Gide could rub meet Walter Rathenau and Ernst Robert Curtius. Aline Mayrisch also introduced Andr\u00e9 Gide to the texts of Rainer Maria Rilke, and in publishing an article on Rilke in the Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise, she helped find a French public for the German writer. It was in this same review that she published articles on the intellectual situation in Germany after the First World War, as well as her autobiographical travel account Paysages de la trenti\u00e8me ann\u00e9e, which, starting in the island sceneries of Corsica and Iceland, evoked the confrontation with emptiness, absurdity and nothingness. Her unfinished novel Andr\u00e9e Reimenkampf has not been preserved for posterity. In collaboration with Marie Delcourt and Bernhard Groethuysen, Aline Mayrisch also translated the sermons of the medieval mystic Meister Eckhart, L'enfant qui s'accuse by Jean Schlumberger and Le mythe de Sisyphe. Essai sur l'absurde by Albert Camus. In the 1930s, Aline Mayrisch financially supported the exile publication Ma\u00df und Wert, edited by Thomas Mann. The following works were dedicated to Aline Mayrisch: Das literarische Frankreich von Heute by Frantz Cl\u00e9ment, Les Cahiers de la Petite Dame by Marie van Rysselberghe and La vie d'Euripide by Marie Delcourt. ==Legacy== The Lyc\u00e9e Aline Mayrisch, open in 2001 in Luxembourg City, the city in which she was born, is named after her. ==Footnotes== ==References== * Category:Luxembourgian philanthropists Category:Luxembourgian socialites Category:Luxembourgian feminists Category:1874 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Luxembourg City Category:Women's rights activists Category:19th-century Luxembourgian people Category:Catholic feminists ",
