    "text": "Holloway Road is a station on the London Underground. It is on the Piccadilly line between Caledonian Road and Arsenal stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station opened on 15 December 1906. The station was constructed by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway and was built with two lift shafts, but only one was ever used for lifts. The second shaft was the site of an experimental spiral escalator which was built by the American inventor of escalators, Jesse W. Reno. The experiment was not successful and was never used by the public. In the 1990s, remains of the escalator equipment were excavated from the base of the lift shaft and stored at the London Transport Museum Depot in Acton. From the platforms, a second exit no longer in use is visible and leads to the back of the used lift shaft. The station is adjacent to the site of the former Holloway and Caledonian Road railway station. The station is close to the new Emirates Stadium, the new home of Arsenal football club. As part of the planning permission \u00a35m was due to be spent expanding the current station to cope with increased passenger numbers on match days. However subsequent studies showed that to ensure the station could cope with the numbers the lifts would have to be replaced with escalators which would cost \u00a360m. As a result, the redevelopment plans were put on hold and now at match times the station is exit only, and before a match eastbound trains do not call. ==Design== The architect was Leslie Green who built it for the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Now part of London Transport). The building is listed by English Heritage as Grade II. ==Refurbishment, 2007\u20132008== Refurbishment works completed in 2008 included the installation of a new public address system, replacement of aging customer information screens, and other aesthetic changes to improve the look, feel and security of the station. This includes improved lighting and a dramatic increase in the number of CCTV cameras. ==Connections== London Buses routes 43, 153, 263, 271 and 393 and night bus route N41 serve the station. ==References== ==Gallery== File:Ironwork, Holloway Road Station, London (8485755278).jpg|The Art Nouveau styled ironwork designed by Leslie Green at Holloway Road station Image:Holloway Road stn northbound look south.JPG|Eastbound platform looking south towards central London File:Holloway Road stn westbound look north.JPG|Westbound platform looking north towards Cockfosters Image:Holloway Road stn roundel.JPG|Roundel on the eastbound platform Image:Holloway Road stn tiling.JPG|Tiling on the eastbound platform Image:Holloway Road Woolliscroft Tile.JPG|Maker's tile on the westbound platform ==External links== * ** ** ** ** * * Category:Piccadilly line stations Category:London Underground Night Tube stations Category:Former Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Islington Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1906 Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Islington Category:Leslie Green railway stations Category:Railway stations located underground in the United Kingdom ",
