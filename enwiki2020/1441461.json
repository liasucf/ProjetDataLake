    "text": "Some hand-based measurements, including the great span (4) A span is the distance measured by a human hand, from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger. In ancient times, a span was considered to be half a cubit. Sometimes the distinction is made between the great span (thumb to little finger) and little span (thumb to index finger, or index finger to little finger). ==History== Ancient Greek texts show that the span was used as a fixed measure in ancient Greece since at least archaic period. The word spithame (Greek: \"\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bc\u03ae\"), \"span\",\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bc\u03ae, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library is attested in the work of HerodotusHerodotus, The Histories, 2.106, on Perseus Digital Library in the 5th century BC; however, the span was used in Greece long before that, since the word trispithamos (Greek: \"\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2\"), \"three spans long\",\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library occurs as early as the 8th century BC in Hesiod. Hesiod, Works and Days, 426, on Perseus Digital Library ==Size of the span== ===English usage=== See also: English unit ; 1 span := 9 inches := 0.2286 m ===Arabic usage=== In Arabic, the analogue of the great span is the \u0161ibr (\u0634\u0628\u0631). It is used in Modern Standard Arabic and classical Arabic, as well as in modern-day dialects. ===Slavic usage=== In Slavic languages, the analogue of the span is various words derived from Proto-Slavic *p\u0119d\u044c (Bulgarian \u043f\u0435\u0434\u044f, Polish pi\u0119d\u017a, Russian \u043f\u044f\u0434\u044c, Slovenian ped, etc.). In various Slavic languages it is the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger or index finger. For example, Slovenian velika ped = great span (23 cm), mala ped = little span (9.5 cm); Russian piad = 4 vershoks = 17.8 cm. See Obsolete Russian weights and measures. ===African usage=== In Swahili, the equivalent of the great span (thumb to little finger) is the shubiri or shibiri while the little span (thumb to forefinger) is the morita or futuri. ===Hungarian usage=== In Hungarian, the span, or arasz, is occasionally used as an informal measure and occurs in two varieties: measured between the tips of the extended thumb and index finger, it is kis arasz (the \"small arasz\"); between the tips of the thumb and little finger, it is nagy arasz (the \"large arasz\"). The term \"arasz,\" used by itself without a modifier, is usually understood as referring to the \"large arasz,\" i.e., to the \"span.\" ===Asian usage=== In Hindi-Urdu and other languages of Northern India and Pakistan, the span is commonly used as an informal measure and called b\u0101lisht (Urdu: \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a, Hindi: \u092c\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0924).Norman Lockyer, \"Nature,\" Nature Publishing Group, Macmillan Journals Ltd., 1922. In Marathi, it's called \u201cWeet\u201d /\u0935\u0940\u0924\u201c. In Malay, it is called \"jengkal\". In Nepal, where this method of measurement is still used in informal context, a span is called Bhitta. In Tamil, it is called \"saaN\". In Thai, it's called Khuep. ===Mongolian usage=== It's commonly used as traditional and informal measure. In Mongolia, the span is called as tuu (\u0442\u04e9\u04e9). Depending on the use of index or middle finger and the placement of the thumb, the span is named differently as tuu (\u0442\u04e9\u04e9) and mukhar tuu (\u043c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0440 \u0442\u04e9\u04e9) etc. ===Portuguese usage=== The old Portuguese customary unit analogue to the span was the palmo de craveira or simply palmo. ; 1 palmo de craveira := 8 polegadas (Portuguese inches) := 1/5 varas (Portuguese yards) := 0.22 m ==See also== *Anthropic units *Hand (unit) * List of unusual units of measurement *Units of measure ==Notes== ==References== *Lyle V.
