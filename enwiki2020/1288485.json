    "text": "The Naked Ride Home is the twelfth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 2002 (see 2002 in music). It peaked at number 36 on The Billboard 200 chart. The single \"The Night Inside Me\" reached number 25 on the Adult Contemporary chart. As of February 2004 the album had sold 139,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen Soundscan. Guests included Keb' Mo' and Greg Leisz. ==Reception== Mark Deming, writing for Allmusic, remarked that \"The craft of Browne's songwriting is still strong, and his performances are pin-sharp and passionate, but unfortunately the very real strengths of The Naked Ride Home only make its flaws all the more glaring \u2013 namely, that Browne's muse hasn't taken him anyplace new and interesting in some time, and even though it's clear he still takes the arts of songwriting and recording very seriously, the results lack the depth or the impact of his earlier work.\" James Hunter, writing for Rolling Stone magazine, felt that the album delivered \"a varied midtempo dependability that turns richer and more resonant upon re-listenings,\" and that it was \"looser, warmer and more live-sounding than Browne's recent work \u2013 yet still as passionately crafted and sung ... he is the sound of unfrantic L.A. cool engaged with the long view.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Jackson Browne, Mark Goldenberg, Mauricio Lewak, Kevin McCormick and Jeff Young, except where noted: #\"The Naked Ride Home\" (Browne) \u2013 5:56 #\"The Night Inside Me\" \u2013 4:38 #\"Casino Nation\" \u2013 6:57 #\"For Taking the Trouble\" (Browne) \u2013 4:25 #\"Never Stop\" \u2013 4:56 #\"Walking Town\" \u2013 6:20 #\"About My Imagination\" \u2013 6:10 #\"Sergio Leone\" \u2013 7:57 #\"Don't You Want to Be There\" (Browne) \u2013 7:35 #\"My Stunning Mystery Companion\" (Browne) \u2013 4:53 ==Personnel== * Jackson Browne \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes * Jimmy Burney \u2013 choir vocals (9) * Marc Cohn \u2013 harmony vocals (9) * Luis Conte \u2013 percussion * Mark Goldenberg \u2013 electric guitar, hi string guitar (4) * Jennifer Gross \u2013 harmony vocals (3, 6) * Greg Leisz \u2013 acoustic guitar (1), 12 string electric guitar (1) * Kipp Lennon \u2013 harmony vocals (3, 6) * Mauricio \"Fritz\" Lewak \u2013 drums, caj\u00f3n (4) * Fred Martin \u2013 choir arrangement (9) * Val McCallum \u2013 rhythm acoustic guitar (7) * Kevin McCormick \u2013 bass guitar, rhythm electric guitar (7) * Alethea Mills \u2013 harmony vocals (4), choir vocals (9) * Kevin Moore (Keb' Mo') \u2013 slide guitar (4) * Chavonne Morris \u2013 harmony vocals (4), choir vocals (9) * Fernando Pullam \u2013 trumpet (9) * Jeff Scott Young \u2013 synthesizer, acoustic piano, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer, harmony vocals ==Production== * Producers \u2013 Jackson Browne and Kevin McCormick * Engineer \u2013 Paul Dieter * Assistant Engineers \u2013 Sebastian Haimerl, Mark Johnson, Bil Lane and Rich Tosi. * Mixing \u2013 Bob Clearmountain * Mix Assistant \u2013 Kevin Harp * Mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering (Portland, ME). * Technical Director \u2013 Ed Wong * Artwork \u2013 Dustin Stanton * Cover Photo \u2013 Nels Israelson * Booklet Photos \u2013 Dianna Cohen and Nels Israelson * Management \u2013 Cree Clover and Donald Miller ==Charts== Album \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|2002 |align=\"left\"|The Billboard 200 |align=\"left\"|36 |- |align=\"left\"|2002 |align=\"left\"|Top Internet Albums |align=\"left\"|36 |- |} Singles \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Single !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|2002 |align=\"left\"|\"The Night Inside Me\" |align=\"left\"|Adult Contemporary |align=\"left\"|25 |- |} ==References== Category:Jackson Browne albums Category:2002 albums Category:Elektra Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Groove Masters Studios ",
