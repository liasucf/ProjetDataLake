    "text": "is a gold leaf-application technique used in Japanese pottery and porcelain. It forms a transparent overglaze on gilded porcelain. Y\u016bri-kinsai is a complicated under look technique. It uses two kinds of gold leaf that consists of one thick and one thin layer. Before firing and glazing the vessel, the leaves are cut or carved into the desired shapes and then applied to the lacquered surface. The leather is then covered in clear glaze and fired at controlled, low temperatures. This firing fuses the leaf to the surface while burning away excess lacquer. In the final stage sometimes two coats of soda glaze are applied to the surface in separate firings. Up to six individual firings are used to achieve the final result. The different thicknesses create the contrast of the pattern and with the glaze giving the vessel a visual dimension. As well as gold, other noble metals such as silver (y\u016bri-ginsai \u91c9\u88cf\u9280\u5f69) or platinum may be used. In 2011 it was registered by the government as an Intangible Cultural Property. == Notable artists == Modern Kutani ware displays refined y\u016bri-kinsai techniques.
