    "text": "The Harris-Murrow-Trowell House in Screven County, Georgia was built 1889 as one of the first houses in the small village of Oliver, after Central of Georgia Railway established a stop there. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Its NRHP nomination described it as having \"local significance in the area of architecture as a good example of a 1889 gabled wing cottage type house with an attached tenant house on the rear elevation. According to Georgia's Living Places: Historic Houses in Their Landscaped Settings, gabled wing cottages were built throughout Georgia primarily between 1875 and 1915 on farms and in Georgia's towns and cities. It was a popular house type that was built throughout the state in both modest and well-to-do parts of the state. The gabled wing cottage is either T-or L-shaped and usually has a gabled roof. Other than the rear addition, the Harris-Murrow-Trowell House retains its historic exterior and interior finishes and materials and has changed little since its construction.\" ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses completed in 1888 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Screven County, Georgia ",
