National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 31, 2011 Via the Arkansas, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. ==Course== The Verdigris is formed near Madison, Kansas, by the convergence of two short headwaters streams, its North and South forks, and flows generally southward throughout its course. South of Coffeyville, Kansas, the river enters Oklahoma. It joins the Arkansas River near Muskogee, Oklahoma, about a mile upstream of the mouth of the Neosho River. The area of convergence of the three rivers Arkansas, Verdigris and Neosho is called \"Three Forks\". ==History== The river is mentioned in accounts by Zebulon Pike (1806), Thomas Nuttall (1818). Fur traders had numerous posts along its route where they met with Native Americans to exchange goods for furs. The river is also mentioned in the novel Little House on the Prairie (1935) by Laura Ingalls Wilder, of her memories when her family moved to Kansas from Wisconsin. The name is derived from the Spanish words verde, meaning \"green,\" and gris, meaning \"grey.\" According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the name may be derived from a gray-green substance resembling a copper ore, which tinged the water.Britannica Online Encyclopaedia. \"Verdigris River.\" Accessed September 4, 2011.

More dams and reservoirs are downstream along the Arkansas River. From just north of Catoosa, Oklahoma to the river's confluence with the Arkansas, barge traffic is supported on the river via the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System. This consists of a series of locks and dams on the Arkansas and the Verdigris rivers; this system enables commercial navigation between the Tulsa, Oklahoma, area and the Mississippi River, and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. ==Tributaries== In Kansas, the Verdigris collects the Fall River at the town of Neodesha and the Elk River at the town of Independence. In Oklahoma it collects the Caney River in Rogers County. ==Cities and towns along the river== *Altoona, Kansas *Benedict, Kansas *Catoosa, Oklahoma *Coffeyville, Kansas *Independence, Kansas *Madison, Kansas *Neodesha, Kansas *Okay, Oklahoma *Oologah, Oklahoma *Talala, Oklahoma *Toronto, Kansas *Nowata, Oklahoma *Virgil, Kansas *Verdigris, Oklahoma ==Gallery== File:Verdigris River Coffeyville Kansas.jpg|The Verdigris River at Coffeyville, Kansas File:USACE Newt Graham Lock and Dam.jpg|Newt Graham Lock and Dam on the Verdigris River in Wagoner County, Oklahoma ==See also== *List of Kansas rivers *List of Oklahoma rivers *Port of Catoosa *Nowata ==References== ==External links== * Category:Lowest points of U.S. states Category:Rivers of Kansas Category:Rivers of Oklahoma Category:Tributaries of the Arkansas River Category:Bodies of water of Montgomery County, Kansas Category:Bodies of water of Greenwood County, Kansas Category:Bodies of water of Wilson County, Kansas Category:Bodies of water of Wagoner County, Oklahoma Category:Bodies of water of Rogers County, Oklahoma Category:Bodies of water of Woodson County, Kansas Category:Bodies of water of Nowata County, Oklahoma ",
