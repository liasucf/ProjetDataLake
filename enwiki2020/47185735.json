    "text": "THE JOURNEY OF 20 YEARS The Beginning St John Paul II College (SJPIIC) opened on 20th March 2000 as Pope John Paul II College with a student population of only five students (two girls and three boys) and eight teaching staff. The school retained this name until after the canonization of Pope John Paul II in 2014 when the Archbishop of Gulu Archdiocese instructed that the name of the college should be changed to reflect the status of our patron. Hence, in July 2017, the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) officially changed the name of the College to St John Paul II College Gulu. The humble beginning of SJPIIC started as a dream in 1993 when the funding family recognized the need for quality secondary school in our region. Initial construction works started at the present site in Laliya Sub County in 1997, culminating with the opening of the school in the year 2000. Back then, the school started as an 'O' Level day school catering for students from neighboring villages. Where We Are From the humble beginnings in the year 2000, St John Paul II College has grown dramatically. The student enrollment went up from the paltry five to over 1,000 students while the number of teaching staff has grown to over 50, plus some 30 support staff. Currently, our students and staff hail from all parts of the Uganda, including student populations from the Republic of South Sudan, and Ethiopia. The total number of classrooms has increased from four to nineteen, while the number of dormitories grew from one to seven. Three fully equipped science laboratories are now in place. In addition, two well-equipped computer laboratories, a library and a new staff room block were constructed, together with an examination hall that seats over 300 candidates. Among the latest infrastructure is a 40-kilowatt solar mini grid supplying power 24/7 on the college campus. We have also upgraded our sports facilities, including paving the basketball court, while a new dining hall, expected to seat the entire student population, is presently under construction. The campus land has expanded from the initial 20 acres to over 50 acres. Lush planting of trees and decorative plant species underscore our enthusiasm for environment protection. Curricular and Co-curricular Programs Currently, St John Paul II College has a strong tradition of academic excellence. Over 40% of our 'A' level students annually obtain the maximum 03 principal passes in the UACE examinations, while up to 80% qualify for university entrance. In 'O' level, our first-grade passes in the UCE examinations have steadily increased from under 10% to over 30%. At St John Paul II College Gulu, we have a great reputation for the many opportunities for personal development of our students who enjoy vibrant programs of clubs, sports, expeditions/field trips, and bench-marking programs, among others. An Appreciation In the course of our journey of 20 years, we are heavily indebted to all our stakeholders who have, and continue to support our progress. Notable among these are the Archdiocese of Gulu and all its parishes, the Church of Uganda Diocese of Northern Uganda and the community of Laliya Sub County. In a special way, we acknowledge the contribution of, the Board of Governors of the school and the Board of Trustees, our old students and the current student community. To all of you and others, we cannot innumerate here, we wish to say 'THANK YOU' for the momentous journey we continue to travel together. Once again, Thank you! ==External links== *http://stjohnpaul2college.sc.ug/index.php Category:Boarding schools in Uganda ",
