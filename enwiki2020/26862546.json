It evokes the joy they would feel when together once again, and the pleasures of the English countryside in spring with its lilac blossom.Ivor Novello, master of the musical Simon Callow, The Guardian, 3 August 2012 The song was performed at Novello's cremation in 1951 by Olive Gilbert. It was also used in the 1954 film Lilacs in the Spring. ==Chorus== We'll gather lilacs in the spring again And walk together down an English lane Until our hearts have learnt to sing again When you come home once more. And in the evening by the firelight's glow You'll hold me close and never let me go Your eyes will tell me all I want to know When you come home once more. ==References== ==External links== * Original sheet music from 1947 Category:1945 songs Category:Songs of World War II Category:Songs written by Ivor Novello ",
