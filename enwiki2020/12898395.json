    "text": "Felipe Mattioni Rohde (born 15 October 1988), known as Mattioni, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Coritiba Football Club as a right back. He also holds Italian citizenship, and spent most of his career with Espanyol, being hindered by several injuries. ==Football career== ===Gr\u00eamio=== Born in Iju\u00ed, Rio Grande do Sul, Mattioni joined Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense in 2004, being promoted to the main squad three years later but failing to appear in the S\u00e9rie A in his first season. However, after performing well in the Campeonato Brasileiro Sub-20 and appearing in the Campeonato Ga\u00facho, he made his debut in the top division in a 2\u20130 home win against Clube N\u00e1utico Capibaribe. On 15 January 2009, A.C. Milan in Italy acquired Mattioni on loan, with the Rossoneri having an option to buy the player at the end of the campaign. He played his first match in a 2\u20132 friendly draw to Rangers, but failed to make an impact due to leg injuries, his Serie A input consisting of two minutes in a 2\u20130 away victory over Calcio Catania on 3 May. In June 2009, Milan announced the club would not exercise the buying option on Mattioni. On 26 August, RCD Mallorca signed him also on loan, from Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Maga Esporte Clube company, with a pre-set price of about \u20ac2 million. During the season he battled for first-choice status with Josemi, scoring from 40 meters in a 4\u20131 home win against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as the Balearic Islands team eventually finished fifth and qualified to the UEFA Europa League (later revoked). ===Espanyol=== In May 2010, Mallorca decided to sign Mattioni permanently for \u20ac2 million subject to the decision of the administrator of the club, which was undergoing severe financial difficulties. Finally the deal fell through, and he joined fellow La Liga side RCD Espanyol from Maga. Early into his spell in Catalonia, Mattioni sustained a severe knee injury \u2013 left anterior cruciate ligament \u2013 going on to miss the entire 2010\u201311 campaign. Shortly after recovering he suffered the same injury in his right leg, being initially ruled out for another six months and eventually nearly two years. Mattioni finally returned to action on 1 November 2012, appearing as a late substitute in a 1\u20133 away loss against Sevilla FC for the round of 32 in the Copa del Rey. His first league appearance came on 2 February of the following year, as he started and played the full 90 minutes in a 3\u20132 home defeat of Levante UD. ===Everton=== On 29 September 2015, Mattioni featured for Premier League club Everton's under-21 side, playing in a 3\u20131 win over Norwich City. A month later, he signed a contract until the end of the season but was immediately loaned out to Doncaster Rovers of League One. He made his debut for the latter on 7 November in the first round of the FA Cup, featuring the full 90 minutes of a 2\u20130 win over amateurs Stalybridge Celtic at the Keepmoat Stadium. ===Back to Brazil=== On 7 February 2017, Boa Esporte Clube announced the signing of Mattioni until the end of the season. He was injured in his third S\u00e9rie B match, and did not regain his place in the team. Mattioni joined Veran\u00f3polis Esporte Clube Recreativo e Cultural in October 2017, ahead of the upcoming edition of the Campeonato Ga\u00facho. The following April he agreed to a deal at Esporte Clube Juventude of the second division, scoring in a 1\u20131 away draw against Gr\u00eamio Esportivo Brasil as the campaign ended in relegation. In December 2018, free agent Mattioni moved to Coritiba Foot Ball Club. ==References== ==External links== * * * *Gr\u00eamio official profile *Assocalciatori profile Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:People from Iju\u00ed Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense players Category:Boa Esporte Clube players Category:Veran\u00f3polis Esporte Clube Recreativo e Cultural players Category:Esporte Clube Juventude players Category:Coritiba Foot Ball Club players Category:Serie A players Category:A.C.
