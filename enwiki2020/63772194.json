    "text": "The diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia are the relationship between two Arab nations in the Middle East. Lebanon has an embassy in Riyadh and Saudi Arabia has an embassy in Beirut. ==History== Historically, both two were parts of the Ottoman Empire, with Lebanon under a self-government rule while what would be the modern day-Saudi Arabia was under the direct control of the Ottoman Empire.https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p4f5 After the end of the Ottoman rule, the Turks vacated from both nations and the Saudi Kingdom would be found from the ashes of the World War I while Lebanon fell under the French rule.http://www.lgic.org/en/history_lebanon1516.php It was not until the end of the World War II that saw the two nations officially established relations. ===Modern=== The two countries established relations once World War II came to an end. In the first decades, Lebanon was embroiled with the conflict against Israel as part of greater Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, Saudi Arabia provided political support for Lebanon but did not send any military force to assist the Lebanese.https://mepc.org/journal/saudi-arabia-and-arab-israeli- peace-process This remained until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, where Saudi Arabia began to play the role as a peace broker for the Lebanese affairs, during which the Saudis sent a group of peacekeeping soldiers to the country before merging with the Arab Deterrent Force. However, it was that time witnessed the rise of the Islamic Iran, overthrowing the previous Shah's rule and Iran began prompting its presence via Hezbollah.
