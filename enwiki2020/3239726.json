He made his debut in comics at fifteen, continuing his father's humorous series Do\u00f1a Urraca (Mrs. Magpie) after his death in 1960, under the pseudonym \"Jordi\". While this could support his family, it did not satisfy his artistic ambitions that were inspired by artists such as Hal Foster, Alex Raymond and Milton Caniff. From 1962, Bernet developed a more realistic style, and took on smaller assignments from Italian and British publishers, until he started illustrating for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou in 1965. He drew the series Dan Lacombe with his uncle Miguel Cuss\u00f3 as writer, and created a similar series Paul Foran with writer Jos\u00e9 Larraz, but due to disagreements over editing decisions by Dupuis, Bernet ended the relationship with Spirou. Turning to the German market, in the 1970s he collaborated with Cuss\u00f3 to create Wat 69, a sexy and humouristic heroine for the magazine Pip, and Andrax, a science fiction series for Primo, which both became successful in Germany. ===Later work=== After the fall of Franco, Bernet returned to Spain and worked for several Spanish comics magazines such as Creepy, Metropol and Cimoc, eventually meeting three writers with whom he would form productive partnerships. With Antonio Segura he created the amazone fantasy series Sarvan, and the series Kraken, depicting a sewer monster terrorizing a futuristic fascist society. Bernet's work for the US market included illustrating an origin story of Jonah Hex. Bernet first collaborated with Enrique S\u00e1nchez Abul\u00ed on several short stories, collected in Historietas negras. When Alex Toth, after producing two stories of Torpedo 1936 in 1981, decided he did not share Abul\u00ed's darkly humorous view of mankind and parted with the project, Bernet was asked to continue the work. This became the beginning of a long-lasting series, which became a popular success and was awarded at the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival. It eventually formed the basis of its own magazine, Luca Torelli es Torpedo in 1992. Later collaborations with Abul\u00ed include De vuelta a casa, La naturaleza de la bestia: Ab Irato and Snake: por un pu\u00f1ado de dolares. Bernet also formed a creative partnership with the Argentine writer Carlos Trillo, resulting in the sexually explicit series Cicca Dum-Dum, the less lewd and more comical series Clara de noche, and several one-shots, including Custer, Light and Bold and Iv\u00e1npiire. Bernet's more recent publications include several albums for the Italian western character Tex Willer, and a run of work for the U.S. comics market, including a Batman story, and a trilogy detailing \"the shocking origin\" of Jonah Hex. Bernet has later continued to work with Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray on Jonah Hex. American artist Will Eisner described his impression of Bernet's work in an anthology preface: ==Bibliography== ===Spain=== * Historias negras (1981, with Abul\u00ed, Gl\u00e9nat) * Sarvan (1982, with Segura, Norma Editorial) * Torpedo (1982, with Abul\u00ed, Gl\u00e9nat) * Kraken (1983, with Segura, Gl\u00e9nat) * De vuelta a casa (1984, with Abul\u00ed, Toutain) * Custer (1985, with Trillo, Gl\u00e9nat) * La naturaleza de la bestia: Ab Irato, Gl\u00e9nat * Snake: por un punado de dolares ? * Light and Bold (1987, Toutain) * Iv\u00e1npiire' (1989, El Jueves) * Clara de noche (1992, El Jueves) === USA === * \"Blackout\" in Batman Black and White Vol. 2 (1996, DC Comics, ) * 100 Bullets #26 (1999, Vertigo/DC Comics) * Solo #6 (2005, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #13: \"Retribution\" (2006, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #14: \"Fathers And Sons\" (2006, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #15: \"Retribution Part 3\" (2006, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #21: \"The Devil's Paw\" (2007, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #23: \"Who Lives and Who Dies\" (2007, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #27: \"Starman\" (2008, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #30: \"Luck Runs Out\" (2008, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #32: \"The Matador\" (2008, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #37: \"Trouble Come in Threes\" (2009, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #38: \"Hell or High Water\" (2009, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #42: \"Shooting the Sun\"(2009, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #52: \"Too Mean to Die\"(2010, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #54: \"Shooting Stars\" (2010, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #57: \"Tall Tales\" (2010, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #59: \"Riders on the Storm\" (2010, DC Comics) * Jonah Hex #61: \"Honeymoon Bullets\" (2011, DC Comics) ==Awards== * 1986: Angoul\u00eame Best Foreign Album Award, for Torpedo: Chaud devant * 1991: Barcelona International Comics Fair Gran Premio * 1994: Nominated for the Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material, for Torpedo * 1995: Nominated for the Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material, for Torpedo * 2011: Comic-Con Inkpot Award ==Sources== * Jordi Bernet publications in Spirou, L'\u00c9cho des savanes and BoDo\u00ef BDoubli\u00e9es * Jordi Bernet Spanish albums Ediciones Gl\u00e9nat * Jordi Bernet French albums Bedetheque ;Footnotes ==External links== *Jordi Bernet biography on Lambiek Comiclopedia *Story about Bernet's \"Andrax\" Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Barcelona Category:Spanish comics artists Category:Spanish erotic artists Category:Catalan artists Category:Inkpot Award winners ",
