Gibbs later said of his release, \"I found out they didn't want me when I picked up the paper. The paper report said the club was punting me, Liam Fulton and Chris Heighington, but I didn't know what was going on. I can remember walking into the weights room and all the boys started laughing and saying, 'You are gone.' It wasn't a joke though because it was true.

He was noted for his, \"determination in defence.\" Former teammate Keith Galloway said of him, \"I learnt so much from Bryce in terms of coming off the line in defence. He used to always shout at you if you were not pulling your weight\". ===Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks=== With new club Cronulla having a good start to 2012, and old club Wests Tigers a poor one, Gibbs was described by Ben Ross as, \"the glue to any team he\u2019ll be in.

Midway through 2012, having yet to score since the 2005 Grand Final, Gibbs declared he would not cut his hair until he had another try. He said, \"my kids have actually never even seen me score. I\u2019ve got a couple at training but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ll get one this year. I\u2019m not going to get my hair cut until I do.\" Gibbs did not appear for the Sharks until round 17 of 2013 season due to an injury when he put his foot through a glass door, resulting in 30 stitches and damage to his Achilles tendon. 140px He said, \"I was going to try and stitch it myself.
