She has one sister, Anna, and one brother, Anthony. She attended a private Catholic high school until her junior year, when she moved to California and began attending an online school. However, she left the program during her final year, saying \"everybody learns differently and I don't learn by reading and writing a report. I need to be doing something to learn.\" == Career == In 2009 during her early teens, Russett began broadcasting on YouTube when she created a music video entry for a contest to meet Justin Bieber. Although her entry didn't win, it went viral and launched her career. In 2012 she started her first job, working as a nighttime radio DJ in Fort Wayne, Indiana and becoming the youngest nationally syndicated radio host in the country. In her junior year of high school, she moved to California after signing a contract with Fullscreen. In 2013, Russett began designing her own clothing line, FLAWD Clothing. (As of Aug 2019, the clothing website no longer exists, and social media accounts for the line have been inactive since Jun 2015.) Since achieving YouTube fame, Russett has appeared in several movies including Expelled (2014), Lovesick (2016), and Sickhouse (2016). Sickhouse is a thriller film that was initially released in brief increments via her Snapchat account. She also attended a few VidCon events, for meet-and-greets with her fans. ==Personal life== Andrea has dated YouTuber Zane Hijazi, and YouTuber and actor Kian Lawley. On September 21, 2018, Russett came out as bisexual through a series of tweets on Twitter. In January 2019, she posted a video to clarify her prior tweets, and to address her sexuality and the fall-out with her best friend, Sandra. Russett is vegan. == Filmography == === Film === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:250px;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5px;;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Role ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:500px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 2em;\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- !scope=\"row\"| Expelled | 2014 | Vanessa |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Felix's ex-girlfriend | |- !scope=\"row\"| Lovesick | 2016 | The Girlfriend |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Short film | |- !scope=\"row\"| Sickhouse | 2016 | Andrea |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- !scope=\"row\"| A Peculiar Tale | 2016 | Fortune Teller |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Short film | |- !scope=\"row\"| Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates | 2016 | Grungy Girl #2 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cameo appearance | |} === TV === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 18em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 2em;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 16em;\"| Role ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 2em;\"| Network ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 18em;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 2em;\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- !scope=\"row\"| @SummerBreak | 2014 | Herself | YouTube | style=\"text-align:left;\"|Season 2 guest role | |- !scope=\"row\"| YouTubers React | 2015\u2013present | Herself | | style=\"text-align:left;\"|12 episodes | |- !scope=\"row\"| Making Moves | 2016 | Herself | | style=\"text-align:left;\"|Guest appearance; 1 episode | |- !scope=\"row\"| Catfish: The TV Show | 2016 | Herself |MTV | style=\"text- align:left;\"|Guest appearance; 1 episode | |- !scope=\"row\"| Apologies in Advance with Andrea Russett | 2017\u2013present | Herself | | style=\"text- align:left;\"|Host | |- !scope=\"row\"| Escape the Night | 2017 | Herself as \"The Mystic\" | | style=\"text-align:left;\"|Main role; Season 2; 10 episodes | |- !scope=\"row\"| Guilty Party | 2018 | Cat Carlson | Fullscreen | style=\"text- align:left;\"|Main role; Season 2: Full Season | |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1995 births Category:Actresses from Indiana Category:American women bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:American YouTubers Category:Bisexual actresses Category:Bisexual women Category:Comedy YouTubers Category:Female YouTubers Category:LGBT people from Indiana Category:LGBT YouTubers Category:Lifestyle YouTubers Category:Living people Category:People from Fort Wayne, Indiana Category:Video bloggers Category:YouTube vloggers ",
