He represents the Malakpet constituency in the Telangana Legislative Assembly on an All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen seat. He first won the seat in 2009 and retained it in the 2014 polls. == Career == Balala won from the Malakpet constituency in 2009 by defeating Muhammad Muzaffar Ali Khan of Telegu Desam Party on an All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ticket. Previously his party unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1989 and 1994. In December 2011, when officials of the Archaeological Survey of India tried to demolish the shops and encroachments around the Badshahi Ashurkhana, Balala and Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri, and other supporters of AIMIM MLA, prevented them from doing so, leading to tensions in the city. In 2014, Balala campaigned for the party in the Maharasthra Assembly Polls. After the results were declared, in which his party won two seats, Balala said that the reason for their success was because of the injustice done to Muslims. In April of the same year, he was renominated by the party for the same Malakpet seat in the Telegana Legislative Assembly polls. He emerged victorious by defeating Venkat Rao of the Bharatiya Janata Party by 23,000 votes. In the zero hour of the Legislative Assembly of March 2016, Balala urged the government to relax the helmet rules for motorcyclists due to the high temperature of the summer months. He said that the \"helmets further increase the heat for riders\". == References == Category:Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen politicians Category:Living people Category:Andhra Pradesh MLAs 2009\u20132014 Category:Telangana MLAs 2014\u20132018 Category:Telangana MLAs 2018\u2013 Category:Politicians from Hyderabad, India Category:1967 births Category:Indian Muslims ",
