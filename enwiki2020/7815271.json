    "text": "The IBM Building is a 20-story office building in the Metropolitan Tract at 1200 Fifth Avenue, Seattle, Washington. The building was designed by Minoru Yamasaki, who also was architect of Rainier Tower on the corner diagonally opposite, and the World Trade Center in New York City. Construction on the building began in May 1963 and it was completed in October 1964. Nard Jones wrote in 1972 that \"There is an architectural poetry about [the building] that is at variance with the endless jibes at computerization and the alleged sober pragmatism of IBM personnel.\" The building's crown has a series of 191 \"fins\" that measure long and house machinery floors. The corner of the complex at 5th Avenue and University Street was once the site of the Seattle Ice Arena from 1915 to 1963. ==References== ==External links== * *IBM Building facts at Unico Properties Category:IBM facilities Category:Downtown Seattle Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Seattle Category:Minoru Yamasaki buildings Category:NBBJ buildings Category:Office buildings completed in 1964 Category:1963 establishments in Washington (state) ",
