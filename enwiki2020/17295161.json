At the time the two had left the Imperials, it was one of the most commercially successful acts in CCM. While not songwriters themselves, Andrus and Blackwood were good judges of what CCM radio wanted, developing relationships with Bruce Hibbard, Hadley Hockensmith, Phil Johnson and Tim Sheppard among others. It paid off with a top 10 title track to their 1979 sophomore double-album Following You.Brothers, Jeffrey. (1999). CCM Creative Ventures, Tennessee: CCM Books. 1st ed.
