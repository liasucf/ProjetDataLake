    "text": "2Sides (Side 1) is the first of two extended plays (EPs) that were intended to form American singer Jason Derulo's fifth studio album 2Sides. The first EP was released on November 8, 2019, through Beluga Heights Records and Warner Records. 2Sides is Derulo's first album since 2016's Platinum Hits but his first album of new material since Everything Is 4 (2015). None of the songs were premiered before the release of the EP, and following its release none were promoted as singles. The second part was due to be released in early 2020; Side 2 was confirmed to be cancelled in May 2020, along with confirmation that Derulo had left his longtime record label due to creative differences. ==Background and concept== During 2016, Derulo began recording music at his home in Los Angeles and previewed a new song called \"Swalla\". He subsequently announced the song as his new single on January 2, 2017, noting that it featured rappers Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign. In May, during an interview at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards, Derulo confirmed that \"Swalla\" and subsequent singles were part of 21 songs that made up his new album, 777. The album would be released in three parts, each with seven songs being released three months apart. A number of other singles were released in 2017, including \"If I'm Lucky\" in September and \"Tip Toe\" (featuring French Montana) in November. Whilst on his 2Sides tour during 2018, Derulo confirmed that the album would no longer be called 777 and was instead named after the tour. Explaining his reason further, Derulo said: Upon the album's announcement, press releases explained the concept of 2Sides and Derulo's approach with the project. \"2SIDES embodies the concept of duality. There's the side the public sees \u2014 the star we know and love \u2014 but there\u2019s also a darker side, which is slowly revealed.\" The release was also accompanied by a trailer posted on Derulo's Instagram account. \"Goodbye\", a joint-collaboration with David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj and Willy William, was released on August 24, 2018. This was followed by another new single, \"Mamacita\" (featuring Farruko), which was released on July 5, 2019. On August 27, 2019, Derulo released another single called \"Too Hot\". ==Release and cancellation of Side 2== During an interview with the Official Charts Company, Derulo confirmed his plans to release the album as two seven-track EPs in quick session. He said \"I want to do it in doses so people will hear the songs. I still think it's nice to give people a body of work; I'm a touring artist and I like forming a concept on the tour which comes from the album title.\" He also said that his previous singles \"Swalla\", \"If I'm Lucky\", \"Tip Toe\", and \"Goodbye\" will not be included on the album because \"those songs have had their time. Even though putting them on an album would make it go platinum in two seconds, it's not about the numbers. These are brand new songs, brand new vibes.\" On October 21, Derulo confirmed on Instagram that Side 1, the first part of the album, would be released on November 8 and have six songs on it, and that the second part would be released in 2020. He then revealed the tracklist for Side 1 on Twitter on November 1. In May 2020, Derulo confirmed that Side 2 to 2Sides would no longer be released. Explaining the decision to cancel the release, Derulo told Australian radio station KIIS 106.5 that he had spent a \"a lot of time trying to get out of that deal\" with Warner Bros. Records and he was no longer signed to them due to creative differences. ==Track listing== All songs were written by Derulo, additional writers noted below, credits adapted from Tidal. == Personnel == Credits adapted from AllMusic. ===Artists=== *Jason Derulo \u2013 lead vocals *Stefflon Don \u2013 featured vocals (track 2) *Ty Dolla Sign \u2013 co-lead vocals (track 3) ===Musicians=== *1Mind \u2013 drum programming, producer *Trevor Brown \u2013 guitar *Roget Chahayed \u2013 producer *Huseyin Erdinc \u2013 saxophone *Chris Gehringer \u2013 mastering *Ben Hogarth \u2013 recording *Jaycen Joshua \u2013 mixing *Jacob Manson \u2013 bass, guitar, producer, programmer *Manny Marroquin \u2013 mixing *MdL \u2013 producer *Sean Small \u2013 producer *Nico Stadi \u2013 producer *Sam Sumser \u2013 producer *Theron Thomas \u2013 producer *Julian Vasquez \u2013 mixing, recording ==References== Category:2019 EPs Category:Jason Derulo albums Category:Warner Records EPs ",
