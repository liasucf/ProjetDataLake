    "text": "The 2009 Copa Sudamericana de Clubes (officially the 2009 Copa Nissan Sudamericana de Clubes for sponsorship reasons) is the 8th edition of the CONMEBOL's secondary international club tournament. Internacional were the defending champions, having won the trophy the previous season. Ecuadorian side LDU Quito won the 2009 tournament, becoming the first Ecuadorian winners of the trophy. From this edition onward, CONCACAF teams, which have participated in the tournament since 2005, will no longer be participating because of the format change in the CONCACAF Champions League, which conflicted with scheduling.https://web.archive.org/web/20090704035235/http://www.concacaf.com/view_article.aspx?id=4793 This will also mark the last tournament in which Argentine clubs River Plate and Boca Juniors will be invited to participate without qualification. Further changes include the additional allocation of berths (1) to all the countries except Brazil and Argentina.http://www.peru.com/futbol/portada20090617/40004/Se-mantienen-cupos- sudamericanos-al-Mundial-de-Brasil-2014 ==Qualified teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Association !Team !Qualify method |- |rowspan=\"6\"| Argentina 6 berths |Lan\u00fas |2008\u201309 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 1st place overall |- |V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield |2008\u201309 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 2nd place overall |- |San Lorenzo |2008\u201309 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 3rd place overall |- |Tigre |2008\u201309 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 4th place overall |- |Boca Juniors |Invited |- |River Plate |Invited |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Bolivia 2 berths |La Paz |2008 Apertura 2nd place |- |Blooming |2008 Clausura 2nd place |- |rowspan=\"9\"| Brazil 8 + 1 berths |Internacional |2008 Copa Sudamericana champion |- |Flamengo |2008 S\u00e9rie A 5th place |- |Botafogo |2008 S\u00e9rie A 7th place |- |Goi\u00e1s |2008 S\u00e9rie A 8th place |- |Coritiba |2008 S\u00e9rie A 9th place |- |Vit\u00f3ria |2008 S\u00e9rie A 10th place |- |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro |2008 S\u00e9rie A 12th place |- |Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense |2008 S\u00e9rie A 13th place |- |Fluminense |2008 S\u00e9rie A 14th place |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Chile 2 berths |Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola |1st in 2009 Apertura general table |- |Universidad de Chile |2009 Copa Sudamericana playoff winner |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Colombia 2 berths |Deportivo Cali |2008 Primera A 2nd best-placed non-champion |- |La Equidad |2008 Copa Colombia champion |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Ecuador 2 berths |Emelec |2009 Serie A First Stage winner |- |LDU Quito |2009 Serie A First Stage runner-up |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Paraguay 2 berths |Libertad |Apertura or Clausura champion with most points in 2008 Primera Divisi\u00f3n |- |Cerro Porte\u00f1o |2008 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 3rd best-placed non- champion |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Peru 2 berths |Cienciano |2008 Descentralizado 2nd best-placed non-champion |- |Alianza Atl\u00e9tico |2008 Descentralizado 3rd best-placed non-champion |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Uruguay 2 berths |River Plate |2009 Liguilla Pre-Libertadores 3rd place |- |Liverpool |2009 Liguilla Pre-Libertadores 4th place |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Venezuela 2 berths |Deportivo Anzo\u00e1tegui |2008 Copa Venezuela champion |- |Zamora |2008\u201309 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 2nd best-placed non-finalist |} ==First stage== The first stage began on August 4, and ended on September 17.
