She created a methodical training system which was implemented in many schools of Russian Empire. In 1862, she organized the first free girls' school in Ukraine. In 1889, she was elected vice-president of the International League of Education in Paris. Khrystyna Alchevska ==Biography== Khrystyna was born 16 April 1841 in Borzna, Chernihiv gubernia, now in Ukraine. She married Alexey (Oleksii) K. Alchevsky, a Ukrainian businessman, later owner of a large mine and steel plant. Their children numbered many talented and accomplished artists. Son, Ivan Alchevsky, was a renowned opera singer. Daughter, Khrystia Alchevska, was a poet. Son, Hryhorii Alchevsky, was a composer. She lived and worked in Kharkiv where died on 15 August 1920. ==Professional life== Beginning in 1862, she maintained the Kharkiv Women's Sunday School (officially accredited in 1870) at her own expense. The school remained in existence for 50 years and was renowned for its highly developed methods of adult education. Borys Hrinchenko taught at the school as a young man. She was an eminent pedagogue who initiated a method of adult education using literary works, rather than spelling books. In 1889, she attended the Paris Exhibition as the representative of Russian Empire teachers of adult students. She taught classes in Ukrainian until forced by the government to switch to Russian. Alchevska compiled an award-winning methodological and bibliographical guide, What the People Should Read, (Chto chitat\u2019 narodu) in 1906. This work earned the grand prize at the Paris International Exhibition, and a teaching manual, Book for Adults (Kniga vzroslykh) in 1900. She also wrote a memoir, My Thoughts and Experiences (\"Peredumannoe i perezhitoe), in 1912. She also published several methodological articles on adult education. In the 1860s, Alchevska's articles appeared in Aleksandr Herzen's journal Kolokol, under the pseudonym Ukrainka. Alchevska encouraged girls and women to dress in traditional regional costumes at community festivals and to perform folksongs. She wore peasant costume as a symbol of her dedication to the people she taught. Her adaptation of folk culture and folk art helped peasants adjust to city life. ==Legacy== In 1963, O. Mazurkevych published a book on the educational work of Alchevska and her colleagues. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1920 deaths Category:People from Borzna Category:Imperial Russian educators Category:Women educators Category:Women educational theorists Category:Imperial Russian women writers Category:Imperial Russian writers Category:19th-century women writers Category:20th-century women writers ",
