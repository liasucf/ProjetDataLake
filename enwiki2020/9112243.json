The two-story brick home has a symmetrical front with two windows on each story on either side of the entry. The entrance features a double door topped by an arched transom; a single panel door is located directly above the entrance on the second floor. The home's hipped roof features a small gable above the entrance and is topped by a widow's walk. The estate also includes a section of the original National Road.
