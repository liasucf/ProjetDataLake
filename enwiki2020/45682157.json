His works were in a romantic form of the Neo-classical tradition. Tadolini was trained in his father's studio. His first major work was Ninfa Pescatrice (Nymph Fishing) in 1846. During his career, he created a statue of Santa Lucia for the Santa Lucia del Gonfalone Church in Rome, a bust of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, an equestrian portrait of Simon Bolivar for Lima, Peru, and St Michael Overcoming Satan, commissioned by merchant Gardner Brewer and now in Boston College. His family's studio, at 150a-b Via del Babuino, Rome, has now been restored as the Museo Atelier Canova Tadolini, which preserves the works of Canova and the Tadolini family. == Selected works == * Ninfa Pescatrice (Nymph Fishing), 1846 * Seated Female Fishing, 1858 * St Michael Overcoming Satan, Boston College, USA, 1865-9 * The Greek Slave, 1871 * Eve, in the Kibble Palace, Botanic Gardens, Glasgow, c. 1875 * Ceres and Bacchus, 1881 * Figure of an Odalesque, 1882 * King Vittorio Emanuele II in the Senate, Rome. == References == * Glasgow Sculpture * Web Gallery of Art * Richard Redding Antiques * Museo Atelier Canova Tadolini Category:19th-century Italian sculptors Category:Italian male sculptors Category:1822 births Category:1893 deaths ",
