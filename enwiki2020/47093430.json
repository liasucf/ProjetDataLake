    "text": "The B\u00fchl-Stollhofen Line () or Lines of Stollhofen was a line of defensive earthworks built for the Reichsarmee in the War of the Spanish Succession. It was constructed by order of Margrave Louis William I of Baden-Baden, also known as \"Turkish Louis\", from 1701 in order to protect northern Baden from the newly erected French fortress of Fort Louis on the River Rhine. == Location == The roughly 10-kilometre-long and only partly fortified line started in the east near Obertal (today part of B\u00fchlertal), ran westwards over the heights to B\u00fchl and then northwest in the Rhine valley via Vimbuch (today a village in the municipality of B\u00fchl), Leiberstung (today part of Sinzheim) and Stollhofen to the River Rhine. It comprised linear schanzen in the terrain, as well as individual star schanzen, hornworks, small forts and fortified villages, and used the watercourses on the Rhine Plain in order to flood the fields of fire and approach using weirs. At the same time, by including the villages of B\u00fchl and Stollhofen, it enabled control of the old trade routes from Basle to Frankfurt (today the Bundesstra\u00dfe B3) at B\u00fchl, and from Strasbourg to Frankfurt (old Roman road, today the B 36). Until 1707, the line bounded the operational area of the French troops and barred the easiest route to Bavaria via Pforzheim.

So he initially occupied Kehl Fortress on 12 March as his base east of the Rhine and, after having uniting with the army of Marshal Tallard,Making a combined force of 50,000 men in 72 battalions and 109 squadrons with 70 guns on 19 April 1703 he began an attack on the B\u00fchl-Stollhofen Line. He bombarded the line south of Kappelwindeck and tried, to bypass the line to the east with 25 battalions under Blainville. Both attempts, on 19 and 24 April failed, because the French could not capture the fortifications at Obertal. On 25 April Villars pulled back. In summer 1703, however, Margrave Louis William could not stop Villars marching up the Kinzig valley and on into Bavaria. There Villars was victorious in the First Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. Likewise in 1704, Tallar was able to pass through the Black Forest unhindered along the Dreisamtal valley. After the death of Margrave Louis William (9 January 1707) Villars was able to capture the B\u00fchl- Stollhofen Line in May that year without a fight and have it destroyed. Several months after the loss of the B\u00fchl-Stollhofen Line, work began on the Ettlingen Line under Rhine Army commander, George Louis of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. This line was reinforced during the War of the Polish Succession (1733\u20131738), destroyed by the French in 1734 broke and then rebuilt in 1735. == Today == As a result of the canalization of the Rhine by Tulla in the 19th century and the construction of roads and settlements in the last century the remains of the line are only still visible in places in the wooded areas east of B\u00fchl.see description with the images In the B\u00fchl Municipal MuseumStadtmuseum B\u00fchl is the 1703 map of the B\u00fchl-Stollhofen Line drawn by Major Elster. == See also == * Lines from Stollhofen in: * Baroque fortifications in the Black Forest * Eppingen lines * Johan Wijnand van Goor defended the lines in 1703 * Battle of Blenheim (August 1704) the lines played an important blocking role in the weeks before the battle * Prince Eugene of Savoy commanded the forces on the line immediately before the Battle of Blenheim * Marshall Villars (May 1707) attacked the lines with a holding operation and then outflanked them defeating Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg. == Footnotes == === Sources === * Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart, Bestand L 6, B\u00fc 1696, 1707 == Literature == * Eugen von M\u00fcller: Die B\u00fchl-Stollhofener Linie im Jahr 1706, in Hrsg.: Badische Historische Kommission: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte des Oberrheins, Band 21 1906, Carl Winter's Universit\u00e4tsbuchhandlung, Heidelberg, 1906 * Hans Zelter: Die Stollhofener Linie, in Fortifikation No. 9, 1995, pp. 20\u201324 == External links == * B\u00fchl und Stollhofen (PDF-Datei; 148 kB) Category:Forts in Germany Category:Margraviate of Baden Category:Black Forest Category:War of the Spanish Succession Category:Military history of Germany Category:Semipermanent fortifications Category:Fortification lines Category:History of Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg ",
