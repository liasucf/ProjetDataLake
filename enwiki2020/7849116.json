He has a unique and dark acoustic style, with a wide array of different techniques, approaches and textures reminiscent of Michael Hedges. ==Biography== Erik Mongrain taught himself guitar from the age of 14. As a boy, he was mostly interested in sports but picked up an interest in the guitar and began to teach himself to play by ear. Erik started out playing the electric guitar, but developed an interest in classical and acoustic guitar after hearing the work of Johann Sebastian Bach. He taught himself to read music and began composing. Mongrain was inspired early on by the work of Metallica, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobain.\"Texan singer's pure and powerful voice will bring the house down\", The Belfast Telegraph, 2008-11-14, p. 8. When he was 18, he heard the work of guitarist Don Ross and he thought: \"This was a new revelation to me. I finally found my niche.\" After that, he was heavily influenced by the work of Michael Hedges, and also began to experiment with a technique known as lap tapping.\"Unique technique in action: Canadian acoustic guitarist Erik Mongrain, known for developing his own unique technique, is set to perform at Exeter Phoenix on Sunday\", Express & Echo, 2008-11-14, p. 27 Mongrain plays live shows in the United States, Japan, Germany, Canada, and England.

He was featured on the cover of Guild Guitar Company Magazine. Erik was featured in Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and many other acoustic guitar magazines.
