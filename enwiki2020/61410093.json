    "text": "right 100 Bushels of Rye is a 1988 role-playing game adventure for H\u00e2rnMaster published by Columbia Games. ==Plot summary== 100 Bushels of Rye is a scenario set in Kaldor in which the heroes are sent to investigate two linked mysteries: a series of murders at an iron mine and why the village of Loban has failed to pay its annual feudal obligation of 100 bushels of rye. The book details Loban and the mine complex. ==Publication history== 100 Bushels of Rye was written by Garry Hamlin and Randolph L. Strommen, with art by Eric Hotz, and was published by Columbia Games in 1988 as a 32-page book. When Columbia Games began to shift its focus toward supporting their new H\u00e2rnmaster RPG, the first ever H\u00e2rn adventures appeared, 100 Bushels of Rye (1988) and The Staff of Fanon (1988), as well as the rules-oriented Pilots' Almanac (1988), followed by a series of magic books and other RPG supplements. ==Reception== In the October 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue 150), Ken Rolston was impressed by this module, calling it \"a perfect short adventure in a series of brief episodes, featuring a simple narrative focus, plenty of detail for each episode, challenging problem-solving (only a fraction of which involves combat), and the appealing narrative virtues of mystery, surprise, and discovery.\" He thought the visual presentation was \"well presented, and uses a page layout ideal for quick reference during the session.\" He was equally as impressed with the settings, calling them \"authentically medieval.\" Rolston concluded with a thumbs up, saying \"As an example of a medieval manorial village for fantasy role-playing, and as an example of a simple, well- designed, short FRP scenario, 100 Bushels of Rye is highly recommended.\" ==References== Category:Fantasy role-playing game adventures Category:H\u00e2rn ",
