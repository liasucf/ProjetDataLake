A prominent dish in Kuwaiti cuisine is machboos, a rice-based specialty usually prepared with basmati rice seasoned with spices, and chicken or mutton (pork is highly restricted due to religious reasons). Seafood is a very significant part of the Kuwaiti diet, especially fish. Local favourites are hamour (grouper), which is typically served grilled, fried, or with biryani rice because of its texture and taste, safi (rabbitfish), maid (mulletfish) and sobaity (sea bream).
