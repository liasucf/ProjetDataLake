    "text": "\u1e46a (also romanized as Nna) is a consonant of Indic abugidas. In modern Indic scripts, Nnaa is derived from the early \"Ashoka\" Brahmi letter ng after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. As with the other cerebral consonants, \u1e47a is not found in most scripts for Tai, Sino-Tibetan, and other non-Indic languages, except for a few scripts, which retain these letters for transcribing Sanskrit religious terms. ==\u0100ryabha\u1e6da numeration== Aryabhata used Devanagari letters for numbers, very similar to the Greek numerals, even after the invention of Indian numerals. The values of the different forms of \u0923 are: *\u0923 = 15 (\u0967\u096b) *\u0923\u093f = 1,500 (\u0967 \u096b\u0966\u0966) *\u0923\u0941 = 150,000 (\u0967 \u096b\u0966 \u0966\u0966\u0966) *\u0923\u0943 = 15,000,000 (\u0967 \u096b\u0966 \u0966\u0966 \u0966\u0966\u0966) *\u0923\u0962 = 1,500,000,000 (\u0967 \u096b\u0966 \u0966\u0966 \u0966\u0966 \u0966\u0966\u0966) *\u0923\u0947 = 15 (\u0967\u096b\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u0966) *\u0923\u0948 = 15 (\u0967\u096b\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u0968) *\u0923\u094b = 15 (\u0967\u096b\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u096a) *\u0923\u094c = 15 (\u0967\u096b\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u096c) ==Historic Nna== There are three different general early historic scripts - Brahmi and its variants, Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, and Tocharian, the so-called slanting Brahmi. Nna as found in standard Brahmi, Nna was a simple geometric shape, with variations toward more flowing forms by the Gupta Nna. The Tocharian Nna Nna did not have an alterante Fremdzeichen form. The third form of nna, in Kharoshthi (Nna) was probably derived from Aramaic separately from the Brahmi letter. ===Brahmi Nna=== The Brahmi letter Nna, Nna, is probably derived from the altered Aramaic Nun 13px, and is thus related to the modern Latin N and Greek Nu. Several identifiable styles of writing the Brahmi Nna can be found, most associated with a specific set of inscriptions from an artifact or diverse records from an historic period.Evolutionary chart, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Vol 7, 1838 As the earliest and most geometric style of Brahmi, the letters found on the Edicts of Ashoka and other records from around that time are normally the reference form for Brahmi letters, with vowel marks not attested until later forms of Brahmi back-formed to match the geometric writing style. {|class=\"wikitable\" |+Brahmi Nna historic forms |- !Ashoka (3rd-1st c.

It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter ka, after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. Letters that derive from it are the Gujarati letter \u0aa3, and the Modi letter \ud805\ude1c. ===Devanagari-using Languages=== In all languages, \u0923 is pronounced as or when appropriate. Like all Indic scripts, Devanagari uses vowel marks attached to the base consonant to override the inherent /\u0259/ vowel: {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Devanagari \u0923 with vowel marks |- ! \u1e46a !! \u1e46\u0101 !! \u1e46i !! \u1e46\u012b !! \u1e46u !! \u1e46\u016b !! \u1e46r !! \u1e46r\u0304 !! \u1e46l !! \u1e46l\u0304 !! \u1e46e !! \u1e46ai !! \u1e46o !! \u1e46au !! \u1e46 |-style=\"font-size: 150%;\" |\u0923 |\u0923\u093e |\u0923\u093f |\u0923\u0940 |\u0923\u0941 |\u0923\u0942 |\u0923\u0943 |\u0923\u0944 |\u0923\u0962 |\u0923\u0963 |\u0923\u0947 |\u0923\u0948 |\u0923\u094b |\u0923\u094c |\u0923\u094d |} ===Conjuncts with \u0923=== Half form of Nna. Devanagari exhibits conjunct ligatures, as is common in Indic scripts. In modern Devanagari texts, most conjuncts are formed by reducing the letter shape to fit tightly to the following letter, usually by dropping a character's vertical stem, sometimes referred to as a \"half form\". Some conjunct clusters are always represented by a true ligature, instead of a shape that can be broken into constituent independent letters. Vertically stacked conjuncts are ubiquitous in older texts, while only a few are still used routinely in modern Devanagari texts. The use of ligatures and vertical conjuncts may vary across languages using the Devanagari script, with Marathi in particular preferring the use of half forms where texts in other languages would show ligatures and vertical stacks. ====Ligature conjuncts of \u0923==== True ligatures are quite rare in Indic scripts. The most common ligated conjuncts in Devanagari are in the form of a slight mutation to fit in context or as a consistent variant form appended to the adjacent characters. Those variants include Na and the Repha and Rakar forms of Ra. Nepali and Marathi texts use the \"eyelash\" Ra half form Ra for an initial \"R\" instead of repha. * \u0930\u09cd (r) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature r\u1e47a: 100px * \u0923\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u0930 (ra) gives us the ligature \u1e47ra: 100px * \u0923\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u0928 (na) gives us the ligature \u1e47na: 100px ====Stacked conjuncts of \u0923==== Vertically stacked ligatures are the most common conjunct forms found in Devanagari text. Although the constituent characters may need to be stretched and moved slightly in order to stack neatly, stacked conjuncts can be broken down into recognizable base letters, or a letter and an otherwise standard ligature. * \u091b\u09cd (c\u02b0) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature c\u02b0\u1e47a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e47a: 100px * \u0921\u09cd (\u1e0d) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u1e47a: 100px * \u0926\u09cd (d) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature d\u1e47a: 100px * \u0939\u09cd (h) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature h\u1e47a: 100px * \u0916\u09cd (k\u02b0) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature k\u02b0\u1e47a: 100px * \u0919\u09cd (\u014b) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u014b\u1e47a: 100px * \u0923\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u0932 (la) gives us the ligature \u1e47la: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature p\u1e47a: 100px * \u0920\u09cd (\u1e6d\u02b0) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u1e6d\u02b0\u1e47a: 100px * \u091f\u09cd (\u1e6d) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u1e6d\u1e47a: 100px ==Bengali Nna== The Bengali script \u09a3 is derived from the Siddha\u1e43 13px, and is marked by a reduced head line, and less geometric shape than its Devanagari counterpart, \u0923. The inherent vowel of Bengali consonant letters is /\u0254/, so the bare letter \u09a3 will sometimes be transliterated as \"nno\" instead of \"nna\". Adding okar, the \"o\" vowel mark, gives a reading of /n\u0333o/. Like all Indic consonants, \u09a3 can be modified by marks to indicate another (or no) vowel than its inherent \"a\". {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Bengali \u09a3 with vowel marks |- ! nna !! nn\u0101 !! nni !! nn\u012b !! nnu !! nn\u016b !! nnr !! nnr\u0304 !! nne !! nnai !! nno !! nnau !! nn |-style=\"font-size: 150%;\" |\u09a3 |\u09a3\u09be |\u09a3\u09bf |\u09a3\u09c0 |\u09a3\u09c1 |\u09a3\u09c2 |\u09a3\u09c3 |\u09a3\u09c4 |\u09a3\u09c7 |\u09a3\u09c8 |\u09a3\u09cb |\u09a3\u09cc |\u09a3\u09cd |} ===\u09a3 in Bengali-using languages=== \u09a3 is used as a basic consonant character in all of the major Bengali script orthographies, including Bengali and Assamese. ===Conjuncts with \u09a3=== Bengali \u09a3 exhibits conjunct ligatures, as is common in Indic scripts, in the form of both stacked and linear (horizontal) ligatures. * \u0997\u09cd (g) + \u09a3 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature g\u1e47a: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a1 (\u1e0da) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e0da: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a2 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a1\u09cd (\u1e0d) + \u09b0 (ra) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e0dra, with the ra phala suffix: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a1\u09cd (\u1e0d) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e0dya, with the ya phala suffix: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09ae (ma) gives us the ligature \u1e47ma: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a3 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e47a: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u099f (\u1e6da) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e6da: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a0 (\u1e6d\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e6d\u02b0a: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a0\u09cd (\u1e6d\u02b0) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e6d\u02b0ya, with the ya phala suffix: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature \u1e47ya, with the ya phala suffix: 100px * \u09b0\u09cd (r) + \u09a3 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature r\u1e47a, with the repha prefix: 100px * \u09b0\u09cd (r) + \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature r\u1e47ya, with the repha prefix and ya phala suffix: 100px ==Javanese Nna== ==References== Category:Indic letters ",
