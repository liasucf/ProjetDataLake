    "text": "Sp\u00e4tzle or Spaetzle (German for \"noodle\") is an evolutionarily-conserved arthropod protein first identified in Drosophila melanogaster. It plays a role in embryonic development and in the insect innate immune response. The name was coined by the Nobel laureate Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard after the Sp\u00e4tzle noodle-like form of homozygous mutant fly larvae. == Structure == Sp\u00e4tzle has a cystine knot structure supported by disulfide bridges, is glycosylated, and naturally forms a homodimer. Multiple forms are produced by alternative splicing. It is produced as a preprotein, and needs to be activated by a serine protease called . The signal sequence spz[1-25] is first cleaved, followed by the spz[26-220] fragment, leaving the final spz[221-326] (Spaetzle C-106) part as the mature protein. == Function == Toll signaling pathways in mammals, shrimp, and fruit flies Homodimeric spz binds to a dimeric toll receptor in fruit flies and related organisms, thus activating the signaling cascade. === Embryonic development === A component of the toll pathway, spz is involved in the formation of the dorso-ventral axis in embryonic development. == References == Category:Drosophila melanogaster genes ",
