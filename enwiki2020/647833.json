    "text": "Patrick Dewaere (26 January 1947 \u2013 16 July 1982) was a French film actor. He was born in Saint-Brieuc, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, son of French actress Mado Maurin. His five siblings, Jean-Pierre Maurin (1941\u20131996), Yves-Marie Maurin (1944\u20132009), Dominique Maurin (b. 1949), Jean-Francois Maurin (b. 1957) and Marie-Veronique Maurin (b. 1960), all became actors, with varying degrees of success. ==Career== Dewaere attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. One of his first TV appearances was in 1961, when he was 14 years old. He appeared in a video for the song \"Nuits d'Espagne\" by Dalida. Later, he was a promising and popular French actor in the late 1960s and 1970s. In 1968, he joined Caf\u00e9 de la Gare, the troupe of performers which also included such future stars as G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Miou-Miou. After initially appearing under the pseudonym Patrick Maurin, he finally opted for Dewaere, which was his grandmother's maiden name. Onscreen from 1971 in various bit parts, Dewaere made the breakthrough with his first major role in Bertrand Blier's anarchic comedy Les Valseuses (1974) where he and Depardieu starred as two young delinquents. He teamed up again with Depardieu in Blier's Oscar-winning comedy Pr\u00e9parez vos mouchoirs (1978). In 1981, he played in controversial film Beau-p\u00e8re, in which his character engaged in an incestuous relationship with his seductive underage adolescent step-daughter. Despite Dewaere's obvious talent for comedy, he was often successfully cast as a fragile, neurotic individual. The actor was the subject of the French documentary Patrick Dewaere, which was shown at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. ==Personal life== Marcia trionfale (1975). For eleven years Dewaere was married to French actress Sotha. In the early 1970s, he became the companion of French actress Miou-Miou, until they separated in 1976.http://www.puretrend.com/article/miou-miou-coluche-patrick- dewaere-julien-clerc-les-hommes-de-sa-vie_a104953/1 They had one daughter. Shortly after the release of Paradis Pour Tous (1982), a black comedy where his character dies by suicide, the actor shot himself in his house in Paris; he was 35 years old. ==Legacy== * The Patrick Dewaere Award was established in France in 1983. * Rapha\u00ebl, a French singer, wrote a song in his honour, Chanson pour Patrick Dewaere, which appeared on Rapha\u00ebl's 2005 album Caravane. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Year ! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Title ! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Role ! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Director ! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notes |- |rowspan=2|1955 |Monsieur Fabre | |Henri Diamant-Berger | |- |La Madelon |Un enfant du village |Jean Boyer |Uncredited |- |rowspan=2|1956 |Plucking the Daisy |Toto's brother |Marc All\u00e9gret |Uncredited |- |I'll Get Back to Kandara |the little boy |Victor Vicas |credited as Patrick Maurin |- |rowspan=2|1957 |The Happy Road |Child |Gene Kelly | |- |Les Espions |Le petit Moynet |Henri- Georges Clouzot | |- |1958 |Mimi Pinson |Le jeune fr\u00e8re de Mimi |Robert Dar\u00e8ne | |- |1966 |Paris br\u00fble-t-il? |young resistance fighter who gets executed |Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment |Uncredited |- |rowspan=2|1971 |Les Mari\u00e9s de l'an II |a volunteer |Jean-Paul Rappeneau |the film was entered into the 1971 Cannes Film Festival |- |The Deadly Trap |L'homme \u00e0 l'\u00e9charpe jaune |Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment |Uncredited |- |1973 |Themroc |Le ma\u00e7on |Claude Faraldo |the film received a prize at the 1973 International Film Festival of Avoriaz |- |1974 |Les Valseuses |Pierrot |Bertrand Blier |the 3rd highest-grossing film of the year 1974 in France |- |rowspan=5|1975 |Au long de rivi\u00e8re Fango |S\u00e9bastien |Sotha | |- |Lily aime-moi |Gaston |Maurice Dugowson |nominated for best film at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival |- |Pas de probl\u00e8me! |Le barman |Georges Lautner | |- |Catherine et Compagnie |Fran\u00e7ois |Michel Boisrond |English title: \"Catherine & Co.\" |- |Adieu poulet |Lefevre |Pierre Granier- Deferre |the film was nominated for two C\u00e9sars (editing and best supporting actor) |- |rowspan=3|1976 |La Meilleure fa\u00e7on de marcher |Marc |Claude Miller |winner of the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Cinematography in 1975 |- |Marcia trionfale |Lt.
