    "text": "Hugh Boyd Guthrie (5 June 1879 - 26 February 1946) was a Scottish socialist politician. Born in Kilmarnock, Guthrie was educated at the University of Glasgow. He became a schoolteacher, and joined the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS). He also joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and gradually rose to prominence, serving as the Scottish member of its National Administrative Council, and also on the party's Scottish Divisional Council, and as chair of its Glasgow Federation. At the 1918 UK general election, Guthrie stood for the Labour Party in Glasgow Camlachie, taking 33.1% of the vote and second place. He next stood in the 1927 Combined Scottish Universities by-election, but took less than one-eight of the vote, and so lost his deposit. By 1929, Guthrie was headteacher of a school. He served for many years as the organising secretary of the Renfrewshire Association of the EIS, and in 1929 was the union's national president. ==References== Category:1879 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members Category:People from Kilmarnock Category:Presidents of British trade unions Category:Scottish trade unionists ",
