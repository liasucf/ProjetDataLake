    "text": "Ronnie Gafney (; born March 11, 1980) is an American-Israeli footballer . Though born in the United States, his family moved back to Israel in 1988 where he started to play organized football. His developmental years were spent at Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he made his professional debut during the 1998\u201399 season in a match against Hapoel Tzafririm Holon. Though he could not break the first team on a regular basis as Dedi Ben Dayan was just coming into his own, so Gafni headed to Hapoel Petah Tikva where he languished on the bench. His move to Bnei Yehuda gave him playing time, and he even scored a game-winning goal in the 2002\u201303 season against his future club Beitar Jerusalem. Eventually he was recognized as being one of the best left backs in all of Israel at that time. He was rewarded with an appearance at the end of the Avraham Grant send off game versus Denmark. ==Honours== *Israeli Premier League (2): **2006-07 **2008-09 ==External links== *Stats at Bnei Yehuda's official website * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:American emigrants to Israel Category:Israeli Jews Category:Jewish American sportspeople Category:Israeli footballers Category:Israel international footballers Category:Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Hapoel Petah Tikva F.C. players Category:Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Beitar Jerusalem F.C. players Category:Maccabi Haifa F.C. players Category:Israeli Premier League players Category:Association football defenders ",
