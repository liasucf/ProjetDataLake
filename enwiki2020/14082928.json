    "text": "Cossipore (also spelt Cossipur, Kashipur) is a neighbourhood of North Kolkata, in Kolkata district in the Indian state of West Bengal. One of the oldest neighbourhoods of the metropolis, it has a police station. ==History== The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Cossipore was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

Cotton writes, \"The Cossipore Reach was one of the finest on the river, and is lined by a number of villa residences.\" From those days Cossipore had a number of industrial units. \u2013 the Government Gun Foundry, the Snider and Rifle Shell factories (originally constructed by Colonel Hutchinson), sugar mills and jute screw houses.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, p. 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

It was set up in 1802 and functions under the Ordnance Factories Board. Along with technological evolution, the plant has successfully altered its product mix to suit the requirements of changing times. The plant has recently undergone large scale modernisation. Its product-mix ranges from big barrel guns to small barrel pistols, different varieties of shells and fuses and civil trade items. It started off as Gun Carriage Agency, but after shifting of the agency first to Allahabad in 1814, and then to Fatehgarh in 1816, its importance was diminished. Finally in 1829, all the machines were shifted to Fatehgarh. However, it had the strength of springing back to life again and again. The vacant space was utilised for the much-needed expansion and renovation of the Gun Factory of Fort William. Besides casting of brass guns, it also took up manufacture of iron shot and shells. Around 1855, breech-loading steel rifled guns had got its way to the British arsenal, but the Cossipore plant was not properly equipped to undertake manufacturing of such guns. The mini-bullet factory was transferred to Dumdum. It had little work and there were suggestions for its closure but it survived. The rifled guns, imported from England, required new elongated shells. It was decided that Cossipore would be utilised for manufacturing of the new shells. It underwent some expansion and the name \u2018Gun Foundry\u2019 was changed to \u2018Foundry and Shell Factory\u2019 in 1872. Along with the manufacturing of new elongated shell, there was requirement of undertaking manufacturing of modern fuses and cartridges to match the newly introduced breech-loading guns. So further expansion took place in 1887 and 1890. In 1892, steel was, for the first time cast in India, at Cossipore by a Siemen's Martin Open Hearth Plant. In 1896, a rolling mill was erected. However, the metallurgical units were shifted to Ishapore in 1903 as no further space for expansion was available at Cossipore. In 1890, a shop was erected for the manufacture and repair of fittings of imported breech-loading guns. The plant undertook the manufacture of quick-firing guns in 1905. With the return of the manufacturing of guns, the name of Cossipore unit got the present name of \u2018Gun and Shell Factory\u2019 in 1905. ==Cossipore Electric Generating Station== New Cossipore Generating station started producing electric for CESC from the year 1949 and has current capacity of 100 MW. This is older and uses non Pulverized Fuel to generate electricity. This unit plays a major part creating an economic eco system in its own. There are a lot of people live in Cossipore who are part of that ecosystem. But in 2015 it was closed. ==Culture== Cossipore Udyanbati The branch of the Ramakrishna Math at Cossipore is popular as Udyanbati.Udyanbati This garden house was sanctified by Ramakrishna's stay with his disciples during the last few months of his life, as also by his mahasamadhi. It was made a branch of Ramakrishna Math in 1946. Kalpataru Utsab is organised on 1 January every year. ==Gallery== File:Sarbamangala Chitteswari Temple 2.jpg|Sarbamangala Chitteshwari Temple Inside View File:Sarvamangala Temple Interior.jpg|Sarbamangala Chitteshwari Temple Interior View File:Durga at Adi Chitteswari Temple 03.jpg|Durga Idol at Sarbamangala Chitteswari Temple ==External links== ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods in Kolkata ",
