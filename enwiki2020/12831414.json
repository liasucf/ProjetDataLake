Located on a large pinnacle of Pikes Peak granite, the fire lookout point lies within the Pike National Forest and is accessed by hiking the Devils Head National Recreation Trail. The station was first established in 1912, with the original tower built in 1919. In the summer of 1951, the old tower was dismantled and current structure was built. In 1991, Devil's Head Lookout was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Sitting at the highest point of Rampart Range, the fire lookout is the last remaining such structure to be in service along the Front Range of Colorado.USDA Forest Service, Pike & San Isabel National Forests, Cimarron & Comanche National Grasslands - History and Facts The view from the current structure extends at least 100 miles in every direction on clear days.USDA Forest Service, Pike & San Isabel National Forests, Cimarron & Comanche National Grasslands - About Us The lookout (elev. 9748 feet, or 2971 m) can be accessed via easy/moderate trail (2.8 miles, or 4.5 km round trip) with elevation gain of 951 feet, or 290 m.
