The Empty Closet reports on issues of interest to the local and national LGBT and allied communities. ==History== The Empty Closet began publication in January 1971 by the University of Rochester Gay Liberation Front student group. Some of the founding members were Bob Osborn, Larry Fine, RJ Alcal\u00e1, Marshall Goldman, Debbie Lestz, Pattie Evans (her pseudonym during the early publications was Patricia Evers), Karen Hagberg, and Sue Minor. It is one of the longest continually published newspapers in the United States focusing on the LGBT community. It was a newspaper until February 2018. ==Importance== In February 2011, the New York State Senate passed Resolution K130-2011, \"Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of The Empty Closet,\" noting the contributions of the newspaper to creating an atmosphere of social tolerance in the Rochester region: \"This progressive paper has been a powerful tool in documenting the social, political, religious, cultural, artistic, business and literary history and events for the GLBT community of Rochester and surrounding areas.\" In 2013, a complete run of The Empty Closet was transferred to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History Archives for preservation. ==References== ==External links== * The Empty Closet official website * The Empty Closet archives Rare Books, Special Collections and Preservation department of the Rush Rhees Library at the University of Rochester Category:LGBT culture in New York (state) Category:LGBT-related magazines published in the United States Category:Mass media in Rochester, New York Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1971 Category:LGBT stubs Category:Magazines published in New York (state) Category:Free magazines ",
