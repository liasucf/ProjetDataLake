He preached successfully and worked, among others, at the Mercure de France, and the Journal de Paris. Like others, he was a victim of the repressive policies of the French Directory against journalists, and a decree dated 17 January (28 Nivose) ordered his deportation to Ol\u00e9ron. We have some eulogies and some funeral orations by him, but he is best known for his edition of the Lettres de Mme de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Paris, 1801, 10 volumes in-12\u00b0. He participated in the proofreading relatively to the grammar and typography of the fifth edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise (1798). A resident member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des observateurs de l'homme, de Vauxelles also translated Dialogues on Medals (De l'all\u00e9gorie, ou Trait\u00e9s sur cette mati\u00e8re) by Joseph Addison. == Works == * Oraison fun\u00e8bre de Louis XV [...] - A Paris : chez Saugrain, 1774 [Biblioth\u00e8que de la SHAS, Senlis] == External links == * Simon-J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bourlet de Vauxcelles on data.bnf.fr * Simon BOURLET DE VAUXCELLES (1733-1802) on Dictionnaire des journalistes * Bust portrait of Bourlet de Vauxcelles on Artnet.com Category:1733 births Category:People from Versailles Category:1802 deaths Category:18th-century French journalists Category:French librarians ",
