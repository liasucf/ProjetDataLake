    "text": "The Black Audio Film Collective (BAFC), founded in 1982 and active until 1998, comprised seven Black British and diaspora multimedia artists and film makers: John Akomfrah, Lina Gopaul, Avril Johnson, Reece Auguiste, Trevor Mathison, Edward George and Claire Joseph. Joseph left in 1985 and was replaced by David Lawson. The group initially came together as students at Portsmouth Polytechnic (their backgrounds included sociology, fine art and psychology),Ashley Clark, \"Rep Diary: Black Audio Film Collective\", Film Comment, 3 March 2014. and after graduation relocated to Hackney in east London. ==Background== The formation of the Black Audio Film Collective, like that of Sankofa Film and Video Collective, was a response to the social unrest in Britain in the 1980s: \"Influenced by contemporary debate on post- colonialism and social theorists such as Homi Bhabha and Stuart Hall, both groups centered around investigations of black identity/culture within the British experience and reworked the documentary to articulate new voices in British cinema.\"\"Black Audio & Sankofa Film Collectives\", Cinema Project. ==Style== The BAFC's output has been variously described as \"an extraordinary body of poetic, allusive, and intensely personal films, videos, and 'slide- tape texts' that chronicled England\u2019s multicultural past and present and pushed the boundaries of the documentary form\",\"Black Audio Film Collective\", BAMcin\u00e9matek. and as \"the expression of a generation of diasporic subjects that seized the idea of 'blackness' as an identity marker as well as a claim to political visibility.\"\u201cBlack Audio Film Collective\u201d , CENCIA, Georgia State University. The pioneering films they produced are still considered influential.The Otolith Group, \"This Day Remains\" , Frieze, Issue 106, April 2007.Celluloid Liberation Front, \"Handsworth, 1985: Re-writing the riots \u2013 The Black Audio Film Collective's film still resonates\", New Statesman, 24 September 2012. According to Guardian critic Adrian Searle, \"the works the BAFC made during the 80s and early 1990s are almost shocking in their range.... The collective was heavily informed by film and psychoanalytic theory, by political discussion and debate.... Perhaps the most significant achievement of the group was the formulation of a poetic, a tone of voice, a particular kind of filmic space that resisted categorisation.\"Adrian Searle, \"Voices of the rising tide\", The Guardian, 27 February 2007. In the words of Kodwo Eshun, they \"projected a stance of high seriousness with seductive stylishness\". BAFC produced what the British Film Institute identifies as \"some of the most challenging and experimental documentaries in Britain in the 1980s\".Paul Ward, \"Black Audio Film Collective (1982-98)\", BFScreenonline. Notable among their oeuvre is 1986's Handsworth Songs, a film essay that makes unconventional use of newsreel and archive material of the autumn 1985 civil disturbances in Birmingham and London to explore memories of immigration and the different ways in which race was experienced and British society dealt with the black presence.\"Handsworth Songs.
