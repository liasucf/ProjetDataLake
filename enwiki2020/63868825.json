    "text": "The National Liberation Forces (), was an insurgent group in Mexico. It was founded in 1969 by a group of young regiomontanos led by C\u00e9sar Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Mu\u00f1oz, integrating the members of an old dissolved organization called the Mexican Insurgent Army (EIM). One of the leaders of the FLN was Rafael Guill\u00e9n, who became a prominent leader within the FLN's successor, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). == History == The National Liberation Forces were established in August 1969, the founders were mainly students of the University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The group's activities were limited to the state of Chiapas. In 1972, FLN activists bought the El Chilar ranch in Ocosingo, which would secretly served as the FLN base. In 1974, one of the partisans gave the Mexican Army information on the location of the FLN headquarters. In the same year, the army stormed El Chilar. Five FLN fighters and three soldiers were killed in the attack, while others were arrested and tortured. The storming of El Chilar led to the self-dissolution of the National Liberation Forces, who continued their agitation underground. In 1983, former FLN members participated in the formation of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. It was the only armed organization in the 1970s that did not commit kidnappings or robberies. == See also == * Party of the Poor * Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre * Popular Revolutionary Army * People's Guerrilla Group ==References== Category:Defunct communist militant groups Category:Far-left politics in Mexico Category:Guerrilla movements in Latin America Category:Left-wing militant groups in Mexico Category:Maoism ",
