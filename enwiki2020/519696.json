Chongqing University is a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University, and also one of the \"Project 211 and Project 985\u201d universities with full support in the construction and development from the central government and the Chongqing Municipal Government. Among its various departments, Chongqing University is especially highly ranked in the Built Environment, Engineering, Technology, and Business disciplines. ==History== Opening ceremony on 12th Oct. 1929 Chongqing University was founded in 1929, when some professors who born in Chongqing, working at Chengdu University, decided to found a new University in Chongqing. The university was founded with the help of General Liu Xiang, who's involvement resulted in the founding of the Chongqing University Preparatory Committee. On October 12, the first term of Chongqing University began, and the Chongqing University Preparatory Committee published the \"Chongqing University Founding Declaration\", which declared talents and education to be the driving force of the country and the world's development.Original text: In 1937, the Capital Nanjing was occupied. the Chinese government ordered that all agencies move to Chongqing and continue resisting Japanese aggressions. This resulted in the relocation of the National Central University to Chongqing, where it was gifted 200mu of land by the Chongqing University, and a cooperative relationship was established between the two universities. Many distinguished professors taught at the two universities during third period, including Li Siguang, Xu Beihong, Wu Guanzhong, Ma Yinchu, He Lu, and Lu Zuofu. In 1942, Chongqing University became a national comprehensive university consisting of six colleges in liberal arts, science, engineering, law, and medicine. In 1952, the nationwide restructuring of higher education turned Chongqing University into an engineering-orientated multi-disciplinary university under the State Ministry of Education. In 1960, Chongqing University was designated as one of the first key national universities. Since the implementation of reform and opening-up policy in China, Chongqing University has stressed the development of disciplines like humanities, business management, art, and sports education, and has further sped up the process of developing the university into a comprehensive institution of higher learning.
