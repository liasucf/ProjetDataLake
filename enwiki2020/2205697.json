    "text": "Louis Lansana Beavogui (28 December 1923 - 19 August 1984) was a Guinean politician. He was Prime Minister from 1972 to 1984 and was briefly interim President in 1984. ==Background and political career== Beavogui, a member of the Toma ethnic group,Thomas O'Toole and Janice E. Baker, Historical Dictionary of Guinea (4th edition, 2005), Scarecrow Press, page lxiv. was born in Macenta, located in southern Guinea. He was trained as a doctor at the School of Medicine and Pharmacy in the Senegalese city of Dakar to become a medic. He first worked as an assistant medical officer in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and then as a medical officer in Kissidougou. His political career began in 1953 as a town councillor. He was elected as Mayor of Kissidougou when he was 31 years old in 1954, and elected to the National Assembly of France in January 1956 as one of three deputies representing French Guinea. Under President Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Beavogui was appointed to the government as Minister of Economic Affairs and Planning when Guinea gained its independence in 1958, and he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1961. After the Guinean government allowed Kwame Nkrumah, the ousted President of Ghana, to live in exile in Guinea, the authorities in Ghana detained Beavogui at the airport in Accra while he was on his way to Ethiopia for a conference of the Organization of African Unity in October 1966. He remained Foreign Minister until May 1969, when he was moved back to his position as Minister of Economic Affairs.Historical Dictionary of Guinea, page 28. At the end of the Ninth Congress of the ruling Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG) on 25 April 1972, President Tour\u00e9 said that Beavogui would become Prime Minister; that position had not previously existed. Beavogui served as Prime Minister from 26 April 1972 to 3 April 1984. ==Interim Presidency and military coup== Tour\u00e9 died on 26 March 1984. Per the Constitution, Beavogui succeeded Tour\u00e9 and acted as interim President until 3 April, when he was deposed in a military coup led by Lansana Cont\u00e9 and Diarra Traor\u00e9. The coup took place just hours before the PDG's political bureau was to select a new leader. Beavogui, a close friend of Tour\u00e9, was widely expected to succeed him. The newly-minded PDG leader would have automatically elected to a seven-year term as president and confirmed in office in a referendum that spring. Following the coup, Beavogui was imprisoned in Kindia until being taken to Conakry for medical treatment.\"Jul 1985 - Government changes - Foreign and economic policy of military government - Release of detained members of former regime - Attempted coup\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 31, July, 1985 Guinea, Page 33709. He died of diabetesWest Africa Annual (13th edition, 1996), page 188. while hospitalized in Conakry in August 1984. ==See also== * Politics of Guinea ==References== Category:1923 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Presidents of Guinea Category:Prime Ministers of Guinea Category:Foreign Ministers of Guinea Category:Members of the National Assembly (France) Category:Mayors of places in Guinea Category:Guinean diplomats Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Democratic Party of Guinea \u2013 African Democratic Rally politicians Category:People from Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 Region Category:Deaths from diabetes ",
