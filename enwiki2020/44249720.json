Once out of prison, Aurora and \"El Rizos\" decide to take revenge of the respectable judge Alejandro Luque (Fernando Soler), responsible for sending her to prison. Fate reunites Aurora and the judge, and she decides to seduce him. Without knowing the trap, the judge falls under the spell of the evil woman, forgetting everything important to him: his family and his profession. The judge degenerates to the point of killing and stealing to be near her. His son, Raul Luque (Ruben Rojo), begins investigating the situation, and like his father, falls in love with the perverse woman. ==Cast== * Nin\u00f3n Sevilla as Aurora * Fernando Soler as Judge Alejandro Luque * Rodolfo Acosta as \"El Rizos\" * Rub\u00e9n Rojo as Ra\u00fal Luque * Andrea Palma as Eulalia * Andres Soler as Mart\u00ednez ==Production notes== The journalist Raymond Borde wrote for Postif magazine: \"In this story, Ninon Sevilla is so evil. She seduces the actor Fernando Soler, the prototype of the Mexican respectable parent: she humiliates him, degraded him, causing him sexually. The sexual frustration of the unbalanced man makes him a likely murderer; his fate is uncertain\".SOMOS (1999), p. 64-8 The film starred Ninon Sevilla. It was written by the Spaniard Alvaro Custodio. The technical merits of the film and character development led the film to become a hit. The film was released in France, where it was recognized by most critics. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, critic of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, wrote many articles about this exotic unique subgenre of the Cinema of Mexico.Fantoscop\u00eda mexicana: Sensualidad The artist Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas said: \"Ninon Sevilla can get to the worst scoundrel as in Sensualidad. In Aventurera, is the victim, but in Sensualidad she's not. This, to the French, seemed surrealism. They loved it. A species of the Marquis de Sade to the bourgeois morality\".Mu\u00f1\u00f3z Castillo, Fernando.
