    "text": "The Lowest is an album by bassist and tubist Red Callender, recorded for the MetroJazz label in 1958.Both Sides Now: MetroJazz Album Discography, accessed February 28, 2018Jazzlists: MetroJazz discography, accessed February 28, 2018 == Reception == The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden states: \"These sessions feature quite a few of the rising stars of the West Coast jazz scene... As a bassist, Callender was very much in demand and displays his immense talent in a rather subdued way. He sets aside his bass to play tuba on several tracks, proving himself as a convincing soloist on an instrument almost always relegated to rhythm, in addition to being out of favor once the bass came into jazz ensembles\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Red Callender except where noted # \"Autumn in New York\" (Vernon Duke) # \"Pickin, Pluckin, Whistlin' and Walkin'\" # \"The Lowest\" # \"Of Thee I Sing\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) # \"Dedicated to the Blues\" # \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\" (Gershwin, Gershwin) # \"Five-Four Blues\" (Josef Myrow) # \"Tea For Two\" (Vincent Youmans, Irving Caesar) # \"Another Blues\" # \"Volume, Too\" # \"I'll Be Around\" (Alec Wilder) ==Personnel== *Red Callender - bass (tracks 2, 4 & 6-10), tuba (tracks 1, 3, 5 & 11) *Gerald Wilson \u2013 trumpet (tracks 1, 3, 5-7 & 9-11) *John Ewing \u2212 trombone (tracks 6, 9 & 10) *Hymie Gunkler \u2212 alto saxophone (tracks 6, 9 & 10) *Buddy Collette \u2212 tenor saxophone (tracks 6, 9 & 10), flute (tracks 1, 3-5, 7, 8 & 11), piccolo (track 2) *Martin Berman \u2212 baritone saxophone (tracks 6, 9 & 10) *Eddie Beal (tracks 6, 9 & 10), Gerald Wiggins (tracks 1, 3, 5, 7 & 11) \u2212 piano *Bill Pitman (tracks 2, 4 & 8), Billy Bean (tracks 1, 3, 5, 7 & 11) \u2212 guitar *Red Mitchell \u2212 bass (tracks 1, 3, 5 & 11) *Bill Douglass \u2013 drums ==References== Category:1958 albums Category:Red Callender albums Category:MetroJazz Records albums ",
