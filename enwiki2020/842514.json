    "text": "A bahuvrihi compound (from , originally referring to fertile land but later denoting the quality of being wealthy or rich) is a type of compound that denotes a referent by specifying a certain characteristic or quality the referent possesses. A bahuvrihi is exocentric, so that the compound is not a hyponym of its head. For instance, a sabretooth (smil-odon) is neither a sabre nor a tooth, but a feline with sabre-like teeth. In Sanskrit bahuvrihis, the last constituent is a noun\u2014more strictly, a nominal stem\u2014while the whole compound is an adjective. In Vedic Sanskrit the accent is regularly on the first member ( ' \"a king's son\", but bahuvrihi ' \"having kings as sons\", viz. ', m., \"father of kings\", ', f., \"mother of kings\"), with the exception of a number of non-nominal prefixes such as the privative a; the word ' is itself likewise an exception to this rule. Bahuvrihi compounds are called possessive compounds in English. In English, bahuvrihis can be identified and the last constituent is usually a noun, while the whole compound is a noun or an adjective. The accent is on the first constituent. English bahuvrihis often describe people using synecdoche: flatfoot, half-wit, highbrow, lowlife, redhead, tenderfoot, long-legs, and white-collar. In dictionaries and other reference works, the abbreviation 'Bhvr.' is sometimes used to indicate bahuvrihi compounds.Handbuch der Sanskritsprache, Volumes 1-2 == Examples == === English === * \"Houndstooth\", a woven fabric with a patterns resembling dog's teeth: \"She's wearing houndstooth.\" * \"Old money\", members from established upper-class who have usually inherited their wealth: \"He's definitely old money.\" * \"Bluestocking\", an educated, intellectual, or artistically accomplished woman: \"Auntie Maud will never marry; she's a bluestocking.\" === Other languages === * (meaning wise woman), the French word denoting a midwife. * and (meaning shining-mane and rime-mane; two horses in Norse mythology) are two examples of Old Norse bahuvrihis. * '''' == See also == * Dvandva * Dvigu * Kenning * Sanskrit compounds * Synecdoche * Tatpurusha ==References== Category:Linguistic morphology Category:Vyakarana ",
