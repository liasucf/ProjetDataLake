    "text": "Together, released by Motown in 1969 (catalog number MS 692), was the second and final duets studio album combining Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations into an eight-person Motown act. Like the first duets LP, Diana Ross & the Supremes Join The Temptations, it is composed almost entirely of covers, including versions of The Band's \"The Weight\", Sly & the Family Stone's \"Sing a Simple Song\", Frankie Valli's \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" (featuring Mary Wilson leading, in preparation for Ross' departure from the Supremes} and Motown songs like \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" and \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\". \"The Weight\" was the only single in the US, and failed to make it into the American Top 40. \"Why (Must We Fall in Love)\", a UK exclusive single, was a Top 40 hit on the UK singles charts. Together was released on the same day (September 23, 1969) as Puzzle People, a regular Temptations album showcasing the group's then-current psychedelic soul sound. ==Track listing== Side one #\"Sing a Simple Song\" (Sly Stone) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Otis Williams, Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Dennis Edwards, Paul Williams) 3:33 #\"My Guy, My Girl\" (Medley) (Smokey Robinson, Ronnie White) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Paul Williams) 3:13 #\"For Better or Worse\" (Pam Sawyer, Joe Hinton) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Eddie Kendricks) 2:37 #\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" (Bob Crewe, Bob Gaudio) (lead singers: Mary Wilson, Eddie Kendricks) 3:11 #\"Why (Must We Fall in Love)\" (Deke Richards, Sherlie Matthews) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Eddie Kendricks) 3:05 Side two #\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" (Marvin Gaye, Mickey Stevenson, George Gordy) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams) 3:10 #\"I'll Be Doggone\" (Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore, Marv Tarplin) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Paul Williams) 3:32 #\"The Weight\" (Robbie Robertson) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams) 3:02 #\"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" (Nick Ashford, Valerie Simpson) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams) 2:44 #\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" (Stevie Wonder, Hank Cosby, Sylvia Moy) (lead singers: Diana Ross, Dennis Edwards, Melvin Franklin) 3:05 ==Personnel== *Diana Ross \u2013 vocals *Mary Wilson \u2013 vocals *Cindy Birdsong \u2013 vocals *Dennis Edwards \u2013 vocals *Eddie Kendricks \u2013 vocals *Paul Williams \u2013 vocals *Melvin Franklin \u2013 vocals *Otis Williams \u2013 vocals *The Andantes \u2013 additional background vocals *Frank Wilson \u2013 producer, executive producer *Smokey Robinson \u2013 producer *Al Clevland \u2013 producer *Terry Johnson \u2013 producer *Tom Baird \u2013 producer/arranger *Various Los Angeles area session musicians \u2013 instrumentation ==References== Category:1969 albums Category:The Supremes albums Category:The Temptations albums Category:Collaborative albums Category:Covers albums Category:Motown albums Category:Albums produced by Smokey Robinson Category:Albums produced by Frank Wilson (musician) Category:Albums produced by Henry Cosby Category:Albums produced by Al Cleveland Category:Albums produced by Deke Richards ",
