Boyi successfully assisted Yu the Great with resolving the Flood, so the King conferred one of the eight noble tribal names, Y\u00edng, to the family of Boyi; and simultaneously Roumu was appointed as the King of the land of X\u00fa. This was the beginning of the establishment of the state X\u00fa. The state has been reigned over by the royal family for more than a thousand years, and had 44 monarchs. The state of X\u00fa was eliminated by the state of W\u00fa, since then in order to commemorate their ancestral pride, descendants of King Ruo'mu adopted their country's name, X\u00fa, as their surname. Therefore, the surname, X\u00fa, is originated from King Ruo'mu, and it belongs to the noble tribe of Y\u00edng.

A different theory states that the surname originated even earlier with the fabled X\u01d4 You (\u8bb8\u7531), a sage in the time of the fabled Emperor Yao, not to be confused with the later another X\u01d4 You (\u8a31\u6538) who was a military strategist of the warlord Yuan Shao during the late Han Dynasty period. X\u01d4 You's descendants carried on the surname of their famed ancestor, thereby establishing X\u01d4 as a surname. Later on in the history of ancient China, it became popular among scholars of the time to postulate that X\u01d4 You must have been the ancestor of that feudal lord whose surname was X\u01d4.https://wapbaike.baidu.com/item/%E8%AE%B8%E7%94%B1/2292246 The posterities with state as surname called X\u01d4, were authentic known as X\u01d4.
