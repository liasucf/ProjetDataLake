    "text": "Great Union Day (, also called Unification DayCIA World Factbook, Romania \u2013 Government or National Day) is a national holiday in Romania, celebrated on 1 December, marking the unification of Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina with the Romanian Kingdom in 1918. This holiday was declared after the Romanian Revolution and commemorates the assembly of the delegates of ethnic Romanians held in Alba Iulia, which declared the Union of Transylvania with Romania\"Public holidays enacted by labour code\" , Labor code, 22 March 2017. Prior to 1948, until the abolition of the monarchy, the national holiday was on 10 May, which had a double meaning: it was the day on which King Carol I set foot on Romanian soil (in 1866), and the day on which the prince ratified the Declaration of Independence (from the Ottoman Empire) in 1877. From 1948, during the period of Communist administration, the national holiday was on 23 August, Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day, to mark the 1944 overthrow of the pro-fascist government of Marshal Ion Antonescu, with parades held on Charles de Gaulle Square (then called Stalin Square and Aviators' Square). == History == === Alba Iulia National Assembly === Cluj) The Resolution of the National Assembly On December 1, 1918 (November 18 Old Style), the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary, consisting of 1,228 elected representatives of the Romanians in Transylvania, Banat, Cri\u015fana and Maramure\u015f, convened in Alba Iulia and decreed (by unanimous vote) The ResolutionRomanian Institute for Cultural Remembrance, The Resolution of the National Assembly in Alba Iulia on December 1, 1918 voted by the National Assembly stipulated also the \"fundamental principles for the foundation of the new Romanian State\". It was conditional, and demanded the preservation of a democratic local autonomy, the equality of all nationalities and religions. The Assembly also formed from 200 of its members, plus 50 co-opted members a High National Romanian Council of Transylvania, the new permanent parliament of Transylvania. The next day, on December 2, 1918, the High National Romanian Council of Transylvania formed a government under the name of Directory Council of Transylvania (Consiliul Dirigent al Transilvaniei), headed by Iuliu Maniu. On December 11, 1918, King Ferdinand signed the LawRomanian Institute for Cultural Remembrance, Law regarding the Union of Transylvania, Banat, Cri\u015fana, the Satumare and Maramure\u015f with the Old Kingdom of Romania regarding the Union of Transylvania, Banat, Cri\u015fana, the Satmar and Maramure\u015f with the Old Kingdom of Romania, decreeing that === Declaration of the holiday === Resolution #903 of the Council of Ministers on August 18, 1949 had marked August 23 as the national holiday. Law 10/1990, declared on August 1, 1990, moved the national holiday to December 1.Law 10 from August 1990 The law does not specify the significance of this day as the national holiday. It was adopted in 1990 by a parliament dominated by members of the National Salvation Front and promulgated by the president Ion Iliescu. The decision combated in some amount sympathy with the tradition of Romanian monarchy, associated with the day May 10, but also disappointed the anti-communist opposition, who wished for the national holiday to be moved to December 22. The choice of December 1, though not explicitly declared in the law, referred to the unification of the provinces of Transylvania, Banat, Cri\u015fana, and Maramure\u015f with Romania in 1918. The choice of this day as a national holiday was seen as an affront to the Hungarian minority of Romania, which signified for them a loss in political power. === First celebration === The first December 1 national holiday saw the largest celebrations in Alba Iulia, the location in which the proclamation of the union of Transylvania with Romania was signed. They were marked by significant political polarization: Corneliu Coposu, then the leader of the anticommunist opposition, was interrupted several times during a speech by boos from the crowd. Petre Roman, then the prime minister, showed such pleasure at these repeated interruptions that Ion Iliescu had to gesture to him to stop. This signal was captured on filmed and spread widely by the mass media. == National Military Parade == A Counter-Terrorism Battalion of the Romanian Intelligence Service on parade in 2008. Every year, an annual military parade known officially as the National Military Parade () of the Romanian Armed Forces either on the grounds of Pia\u021ba Constitu\u021biei (Constitution Square) or on \u0218oseaua Kiseleff just within metres of the Arcul de Triumf in central Bucharest is held in honor of the occasion.https://www.mapn.ro/cpresa/16407_parada-militara-la-bucuresti,-de- ziua-nationala-a-romaniei A parade is also held in the city of Alba Iulia and within other major cities.
