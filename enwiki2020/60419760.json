His primary position is fullback, though can also play on either wing. Gallagher's father is John Gallagher, who famously won the 1987 Rugby World Cup with New Zealand. ==Professional career== Gallagher made his senior competitive debut for Saracens against Welsh side Ospreys in November 2014. He was voted the Saracens Academy Player of the Year following strong performances for Saracens Storm during the 2015\u201316 Premiership Rugby A-League, as well as helping loan club Old Albanian secure promotion to National League 1 after winning the 2015\u201316 National League 2 South play-offs. He joined Bedford Blues as a dual-registered player ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, though he was soon called into action for Saracens. Gallagher joined Irish Pro14 side Munster on a two-year contract from the 2020\u201321 season, and made his competitive debut for the province in their 2020\u201321 Pro14 round two fixture against Scottish side Edinburgh on 10 October 2020, which Munster won 25\u201323. ==International career== Gallagher was selected for the England under-20s at the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship, and he started in the 45\u201321 win against Ireland under-20s in the final. Through his father, John, Gallagher is qualified to play for Ireland, as his paternal grandfather and grandmother are from Derry and Limerick respectively. ==References== ==External links== *Munster Profile *Saracens Profile * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sidcup Category:English rugby union players Category:Saracens F.C. players Category:Bedford Blues players Category:Munster Rugby players Category:English expatriate rugby union players Category:Expatriate rugby union players in Ireland Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Ireland Category:Rugby union fullbacks Category:Rugby union wings ",
