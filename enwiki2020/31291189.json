The poor form that the club had ended 2001-02 with continued into this season, resulting in Peter Reid being sacked after seven years as manager following a 3-1 loss to Arsenal in October just before the international break. Three days later, despite speculation linking recently-departed Ireland manager Mick McCarthy to the job, the board made the shock decision to hire Howard Wilkinson, who had been out of club management for six years. Despite a loss to West Ham in Wilkinson's first match in charge, Sunderland ground out a four-match unbeaten run in the games that followed, as well as gaining a surprise victory over Liverpool and a point against fellow strugglers West Brom just before Christmas. However, a truly appalling second half of the season saw Sunderland earn just one point after Christmas. Wilkinson was sacked in March and McCarthy brought in to replace him, but the change proved too little too late, with Sunderland ending the season with a staggering run of 15 consecutive defeats, and setting new records for the fewest goals scored by a top-flight club, and the lowest points total for a Premier League club since the competition began (albeit not the lowest since the introduction of three points for a win; Sunderland would, however, break that record three seasons later). ==Transfers== ===In=== ====Summer==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Date !Pos !Name !From !Fee |- |8 July 2002 |MF | Sean Thornton | Tranmere Rovers |\u00a3225,000The fee was compensation agreed at an FA tribunal. |- |15 August 2002 |DF | Stephen Wright | Liverpool |\u00a33,000,000 |- |21 August 2002 |MF | Matt Piper | Leicester City |\u00a33,500,000 |- |30 August 2002 |FW | Tore Andre Flo | Rangers |\u00a36,750,000 |- |30 August 2002 |FW | Marcus Stewart | Ipswich Town |\u00a33,250,000 |- |15 November 2002 |GK | Mart Poom | Derby County |Loan |} ====January==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Date !Pos !Name !From !Fee |- |10 January 2003 |GK | Mart Poom | Derby County |\u00a32,500,000 |- |31 January 2003 |DF | Talal El Karkouri | Paris Saint Germain |Loan |} ===Out=== ====Summer==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Date !Pos !Name !To !Fee |- |31 October 2002 |MF | John Oster | Grimsby Town |Loan |- |1 November 2002 |FW | Michael Reddy | York City |Loan |- |7 November 2002 |MF | Sean Thornton | Blackpool |Loan |- |22 November 2002 |GK | Michael Ingham | Darlington |Loan |} ====January==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Date !Pos !Name !To !Fee |- |11 January 2003 |FW | Dene Shields | Raith Rovers |\u00a360,000 |- |24 January 2003 |GK | Michael Ingham | York City |Loan |- |30 January 2003 |FW | Michael Reddy | Sheffield Wednesday |Loan |- |12 February 2003 |DF | Stanislav Varga | Celtic |Free |- |21 February 2003 |MF | John Oster | Grimsby Town |Loan |- |27 March 2003 |FW | Keith Graydon | York City |Loan |} ==Players== ===First-team squad=== :Squad at end of season ===Left club during season=== ==Reserve squad== ==Results== ===Football League Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:center\" !Date!!Round!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Scorers |-style=\"background-color: #d0ffe3;\" | 1 October 2002 ||Second round||Cambridge United||Abbey Stadium||7-0||8,175||Reyna, McCann, Arca, Flo (2), Stewart (2) |-style=\"background-color: #d0ffe3;\" | 6 November 2002 ||Third round||Arsenal||Highbury||3-2||19,059||Kyle, Stewart (2) |-style=\"background-color: #ffd0e3;\" | 3 December 2002 ||Fourth round||Sheffield United||Bramall Lane||0-2||27,068|| |} ===FA Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:center\" !Date!!Round!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Scorers |-style=\"background-color: #ffffdd;\" | 4 January 2003 ||Third round||Bolton Wanderers||Reebok Stadium||1-1||10,132||Phillips |-style=\"background-color: #d0ffe3;\" | 14 January 2003 ||Third round replay||Bolton Wanderers||Stadium of Light||2-0||14,550||Arca, Proctor |-style=\"background-color: #ffffdd;\" | 25 January 2003 ||Fourth round||Blackburn Rovers||Ewood Park||3-3||14,315||Stewart, Proctor and Phillips |-style=\"background-color: #d0ffe3;\" | 5 February 2003 ||Fourth round replay||Blackburn Rovers||Stadium of Light||2-2 a.e.t.
