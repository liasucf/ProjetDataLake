    "text": "Isaac de Larrey, Sieur of Grandchamp and Courm\u00e9nil, born, according to some biographers 7 September 1638 in Lintot, near Bolbec and according to the majority, in Montivilliers, 25 January 1639 \u2013 17 March 1719) was a French historian. To freely exercise his religious beliefs because he was a Protestant, Larrey went into exile in Holland after the Edict of Fontainebleau. His historical work earned him the title of historiographer of the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Shortly after, the ruler of Brandenbourg, by offering him the title of Aulic Council, attracted him to Berlin where he died. == Publications == * Histoire d'Auguste, Rotterdam, 1690, in-12\u00b0. * L'H\u00e9riti\u00e8re de Guyenne, ou Histoire d'El\u00e9onore , 1691. * Histoire d'Angleterre, d'\u00c9cosse et d'Irlande, 1707-1712, 4 vol. in-f\u00b0. * Histoire des Sept sages de la Gr\u00e8ce, Fritsch et Bohm, Rotterdam, 1714.
