    "text": "Fictitious people are nonexistent people, who, unlike fictional people, have been claimed to actually exist. Usually this is done as a practical joke or hoax, but sometimes fictitious people are 'created' as part of a fraud. Sometimes the line between the two categories is blurred, e.g., as in the case of Abdul Alhazred. A pseudonym may also be considered by some to be a \"fictitious person\", although this is not the correct definition. ==Hoaxes== * William Ashbless, a 19th-century fictitious poet and adventurer. * Bilitis, nonexistent Ancient Greek poet. Supposed author of The Songs of Bilitis, a collection of erotic poetry \"discovered\" by Pierre Lou\u00ffs. * George P.

Rochester Sneath, nonexistent English public school headmaster and prolific letter writer, created by Humphry Berkeley. * Georg Paul Thomann, nonexistent Austrian conceptual artist, created by art group monochrom to represent Austria at the 2002 Sao Paulo Art Biennial.

Frye, a fictional figure, purportedly the founder of the Republican Party in New York State, made up by Cornell University students in 1930 as a prank designed to embarrass several state politicians. ==Pseudonyms== This list includes pseudonyms supplied with a biography suggesting the existence of a person distinct from the actual person with the pseudonym in question, often with the purpose of a hoax.

Farmer's work is based on a moment in Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater that describes a character reading a copy of Trout's novel, \"Venus on the Half-Shell\".
