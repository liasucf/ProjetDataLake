    "text": "Enslavement of Beauty is a symphonic black metal band from Norway. Enslavement of Beauty was formed in January 1995 by Ole Alexander Myrholt (vocals & lyrics) and Tony Eugene Tunheim (guitars & composing). The band spent the subsequent years composing and recording material and thereby developed their expression. In the summer of 1998, Enslavement of Beauty recorded the demo CD \"Devilry & Temptation\" which gained them a deal with Head Not Found/Voices of Wonder. This resulted in the 1999 release \"Traces O' Red\" which received very positive response. In November 2000, they recorded their second album, \"Megalomania\", accompanied by drummer Asgeir Mickelson (Borknagar/Spiral Architect) and bass player Hans-Aage Holmen. In 2007 the third album, \"Mere Contemplations\" has been released with the I.N.R.I. Unlimited label. Lyrically, Enslavement of Beauty is highly influenced by the works of William Shakespeare and Marquis de Sade. ==Demo== *1998 \u2013 Devilry and Temptation All music by Tony Eugene Tunheim.
