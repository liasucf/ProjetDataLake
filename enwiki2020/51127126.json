    "text": "Several Shades of Jade is a 1963 album by Cal Tjader arranged by Lalo Schifrin. It peaked at 79 on the Billboard 200. ==Reception== Stewart Mason reviewed the album for Allmusic and wrote that of Tjader and Schifrin's collaboration that it was \"...no more traditional Asian music than Tjader's similar albums from this period are traditional Latin American music, but the pair wisely avoids the standard clich\u00e9s of Asian music (no smashing gongs after every musical phrase or melodies that sound like rejects from The Mikado). Instead, Schifrin frames Tjader's meditative vibraphone solos in arrangements that strike a cool balance between western kitsch and eastern exotica, never tipping too far in either direction. ...Several Shades of Jade is actually an interesting experiment that succeeds more often than it fails.\" == Track listing == # \"The Fakir\" (Lalo Schifrin) # \"Cherry Blossom\" (Ronnell Bright) # \"Borneo\" (Schifrin) # \"Tokyo Blues\" (Horace Silver) # \"Song of the Yellow River\" (Schifrin) # \"Sahib\" (Stan Applebaum) # \"China Nights (Shina No Yoru)\" (Yaso Saijo, Nobuyki Takeoka) # \"Almond Tree\" (Schifrin) # \"Hot Sake\" (Quincy Jones) == Personnel == *Cal Tjader \u2013 vibraphone *Lalo Schifrin \u2013 arranger, piano (track 3) *George Duvivier - bass *George Berg - bass clarinet, bassoon *Charles McCracken - cello (tracks 1, 2) *Jack Del Rio - congas, tambourine *Ed Shaughnessy - drums *Walt Levinsky - flute, woodwind *Robert Northern - French horn (tracks 3-9) *Jim Raney - guitar *Robert Maxwell - harp *Irving Horowitz, Leon Cohen - oboe *Johnny Rae - timbales, percussion *Urbie Green - trombone (tracks 3-9) *Clark Terry, Ernie Royal - trumpet (tracks 3-9) *Don Butterfield - tuba *Arnold Eidus, Emanuel Vardi, Leo Kruczek - violin (tracks 1, 2) *Phil Bodner, Stan Webb - woodwinds *Phil Kraus - xylophone (miscredited as a woodwind player on CD reissue) ;Production *John Murello \u2013 cover design *Irv Bahrt - cover photo *Chuck Stewart - liner photography *Bob Simpson \u2013 engineer *Val Valentin \u2013 director of engineering *Jack Maher \u2013 liner notes *Creed Taylor \u2013 producer ==References== Category:1963 albums Category:Albums arranged by Lalo Schifrin Category:Cal Tjader albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
