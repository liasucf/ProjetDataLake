It was also their third season in five in which the Suns earned a top-five draft pick in the NBA Draft, which became the second straight year of gaining the #4 pick in Josh Jackson. Three games into the season, head coach Earl Watson was fired. Guard Eric Bledsoe implied he wanted out of Phoenix and was barred from playing with the team by general manager Ryan McDonough and fined $10,000. Under interim head coach Jay Triano, the Suns started 4\u20131 after suspending Bledsoe. The Suns later traded Bledsoe to the Milwaukee Bucks on November 7, 2017 in exchange for center Greg Monroe and two protected draft picks. After dealing with point guard problems and injuries, the Suns traded for Elfrid Payton on February 8, 2018, in exchange for a second round pick they had previously acquired. ==Key dates== *April 17, 2017: Phoenix Suns' general manager Ryan McDonough is confirmed to continue staying as the team's general manager and President of Basketball Operations for at least this season. *April 18, 2017: Steve Albert announces his retirement from broadcasting. *May 4, 2017: Sideline reporter Kevin Ray is confirmed to be the new play-by-play broadcaster for the Phoenix Suns starting this season. *May 16, 2017: The NBA Draft Lottery took place, with the Suns holding the #4 despite having the second-best odds at the #1 pick.

Their first round pick was their second straight pick at #4, despite having the second-best odds at the #1 pick that year. That draft later resulted in the Top 4 selections having the same teams representing the top of the draft similar to the previous year's draft. Meanwhile, their first second round pick was given to them for having the second-worst record of the season last season despite having a better record than their previous season. Their own second round pick was also used in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks during the 2017 trade deadline in exchange for the rights to Mike Scott, the draft rights to Turkish shooting guard/small forward Cenk Akyol, and some cash considerations worth $500,000, although it wasn't conveyed to Atlanta due to their second round pick(s) remaining in the top 55 of this year's draft. Finally, their second (and final) second round pick was given to them by the Toronto Raptors for trading defensive small forward P.J. Tucker to them that same day in exchange for their second round picks in 2017 & 2018, as well as the rights to Jared Sullinger and cash considerations worth $1,000,000. The Raptors' second round pick won the tiebreaker over both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Clippers (who originally held Picks 55 & 56 respectively that draft), but ultimately lost out to the Boston Celtics for pick 53 that year. Speaking of which, the Suns were also initially planned to get the Minnesota Timberwolves' second round selection for this year, but traded it away in a different trade with the Boston Celtics (back when it was still considered to be a first round draft pick) in order to get Brandan Wright on the team under the same season they first acquired Isaiah Thomas. In addition to that, the Los Angeles Lakers' first round pick that had belonged to the Suns before the 2014\u201315 season came and went was originally perceived to be conveyed to the Philadelphia 76ers this year, but the Lakers still wound up with pick #2 again to keep their pick for this season; that 2018 pick could later be potentially given to the Boston Celtics in order for them to trade away their #1 pick this year to Philadelphia. With the fourth pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, the Suns selected freshman small forward Josh Jackson from the University of Kansas. During his only season with Kansas, Jackson showcased his talent. In the 35 games Josh played with the Jayhawks, he recorded averages of 16.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game while also earning the Big 12 Conference's Freshman of the Year Award, First Team All-Big 12 honors, and mixed honors with the NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans; more specifically, he'd get Second Team honors from the Sporting News, while he had Third Team honors from the Associated Press and the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Meanwhile, with the Suns' first second round pick, they selected senior shooting guard Davon Reed from the University of Miami in Florida. Throughout his career in Miami, Florida, Reed managed to provide career averages of 10.3 points and 3.6 rebounds per game, but managed his best work as a senior with 14.9 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. Davon's considered handiwork, however, comes on the defensive end, as he managed to earn All-ACC Defensive Team honors in 2017 alongside being a member of the All-ACC Third Team and holding great academics throughout his college career. Finally, with the last second round pick, Phoenix selected power forward Alec Peters from Valparaiso University. Under Alec's last season at Valparaiso, he became one of only two players to record over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game in the NCAA's Division I with 23.0 points and 10.1 rebounds per game recorded for them in his senior year (with the other player being senior power forward/center Tim Kempton Jr., son of former Suns player Tim Kempton Sr., from Lehigh University). As a result, Peters won named the Horizon League Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 2017. He also was named the Horizon League Tournament's MVP in 2015, an Academics All-American First Team member in 2017, became a three-time member of the All-Horizon League First Team from 2015-2017, and was even twice mentioned as an honorable mention for the Associated Press' All-American Teams. Like first round pick Josh Jackson, Alec Peters was also named a member of the National Association of Basketball Coaches' All-American Third Team in 2017 himself. Peters was originally projected to be a late-first round pick before his right leg injury near the end of his senior season led to his draft stock slipping to the late second round; he also became the team's second two-way contract of the season on September 18 (first contract being Mike James), meaning he'd split his playing time between the Phoenix Suns and their NBA G League affiliate, the Northern Arizona Suns, for the vast majority of the season. ===Free agency=== This season, the only player on the Suns set to become an unrestricted free agent as of the end of the 2016\u201317 NBA season was the twice-returned Ronnie Price. However, for restricted free agents, both centers Alex Len and Alan Williams were given qualifying offers on June 27, 2017, and could have opportunities to remain with the team if the Suns wanted to keep both of them. T.J. Warren also stayed for a longer period of time, signing a four-year deal worth $50 million on September 25, 2017. In addition, veteran guard Leandro Barbosa and small forwards Derrick Jones Jr. and Elijah Millsap, all have team options for another season, with the latter two having them near the mid-season deadline on January 7, 2018, although neither player got to that point in time. Alan Williams also qualified for the NBA's Early Bird rights due to previously debuting late in the 2015\u201316 NBA season and essentially signing a two-year deal around that time.http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm This season also marks the first season where NBA teams get to add 16 or even 17 players to their official roster using two-way contracts, which allows NBA teams to add players with less than three full years of NBA experience to enter the league with the condition of staying on their NBA G League team for the majority of the season for higher salaries than they could otherwise get in the recently rebranded league.http://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2017/04/27/d-league- salaries-two-way-contracts-increase-nba-draft-early- entries/https://2ways10days.com/nba-two-way-contracts-faq-70d1c9cbbe9 Summer League invite Mike James, a point guard who previously went to Eastern Arizona College and a Greek Basket League star with the Panathinikos Superfoods, announced prior to free agency that he would try to earn a two-way contract. On July 2, the Suns gave Alan Williams a four-year deal worth around $24 million to stay with his hometown team. A day later, the Suns renounced their rights to Leandro Barbosa making him a free agent in the process. Mike James also officially signed a deal with the Suns the same day they announced their team for the 2017 NBA Summer League. After originally being offered a four- year deal worth $24 million from the Suns, Williams officially received a three-year partially guaranteed deal worth $17 million on July 9 and signed it on July 26. A day before Williams signed with the Suns, however, it was reported that Brandon Knight tore his ACL during a pickup game in Florida. With the announcement of Knight's ACL injury causing him to be out for most of the season, the Suns qualified to have an additional $6.8 million to spend as a disabled player exception, likely extending their roster to 18 players at some point this season. The roster potentially required that extra player again on August 25 with the announcement of rookie shooting guard Davon Reed being out for four to six months due to surgery on his left meniscus and then on September 22 with center/power forward Alan Williams being out for a currently undetermined time with a partially torn meniscus of his own. A day before his teammate got injured, though, the Suns signed their other center, Alex Len, to a one-year qualifying offer worth $4.2 million to remain on their squad. On November 11, 2017, it was announced that Leandro Barbosa would return to his native land of Brazil for a second time, this time being a part of the Franca Basquetebol Clube. Ronnie Price ultimately was the only player from last season's roster to not play at all entering this season. On August 22, 2017, the Suns signed former Iowa University shooting guard Peter Jok to a partially guaranteed deal to prove his worth in training camp. On September 11, it was originally announced that the Suns signed shooting guard and former first round draft pick R.J. Hunter as a possible temporary replacement for injured rookie Davon Reed. It was later reported from The Arizona Republic on that same day that Hunter alongside shooting guards Isaiah Canaan, Andre Dawkins, and Northern Arizona Suns' player Xavier Silas had all come to Phoenix for workouts, but none of them received a training camp offer with the Suns. On September 22, after Len's agreement was announced, former 2013 NBA Draft number-one pick Anthony Bennett was confirmed as a partially guaranteed training camp deal player alongside Peter Jok. Furthermore, that same day also lead to them gaining Troy Daniels from a trade to help shore up the shooting guard spot. Furthermore, on the same day Alex Len officially signed his qualifying offer (and Alan Williams had successful surgery on his meniscus), it was confirmed that T. J. Warren signed a four-year contract extension with the Suns worth $50 million. On October 11, the Suns cut Peter Jok and Anthony Bennett before their final preseason game against the Portland Trail Blazers began. Two days later, before their actual last preseason game began against the Brisbane Bullets from Australia, the Suns signed a French power forward from Canada named Tidjan Keita. All of these players were part of the Northern Arizona Suns G League squad instead, with both Keita and Elijah Millsap being cut a day later (Millsap was later traded to the Iowa Wolves after being cut by Phoenix via the Northern Arizona squad for the #1 pick in the 2017 NBA G League Draft). On December 7, 2017, after point guard Mike James finished the last day of his original two-way contract with Phoenix, he'd be retained by them with a full-blown contract, albeit at the price of being forced to waive small forward Derrick Jones Jr. earlier than expected. On the same day, after a loss to the Washington Wizards, the Suns signed Danuel House to a two-way contract, filling up the spot originally held for Mike James earlier in the year. However, Phoenix used their disabled player's injury exception to sign recent Northern Arizona Suns and former Houston Rockets combo guard Isaiah Canaan on December 13, 2017, with the tipping point involving star shooting guard Devin Booker being out for a few weeks. Isaiah was previously acquired by the Northern Arizona Suns trading their 2018 first round pick to the Agua Caliente Clippers expansion squad for him. Canaan stayed with Phoenix even after Devin Booker returned from his injury by converting his deal into a standard one year, veteran's minimum contract, while the Suns waived former two-way contracted point guard Mike James from the team on December 22, 2017. However, after Canaan fractured his tibula on the same day they officially waived center Greg Monroe from the team (January 31), the Suns signed Northern Arizona Suns point guard Josh Gray to a 10-day contract a day later. In the aftermath of the February 8, 2018 NBA trade deadline, the Suns were forced to waive Isaiah Canaan (with him still receiving his full salary for the year) in order to gain Elfrid Payton in their trade with the Orlando Magic in exchange for a second round pick from Memphis. However, Canaan still got paid the full salary for the season and use the team's facilities to help his body recover from his season-ending injury.http://www.nba.com/suns/press-release/official- phoenix-suns-waive-isaiah-canaan Meanwhile, Josh Gray signed his second 10-day contract with Phoenix on February 11, although he was waived on February 21 (with his contract expiring that day) with fellow Northern Arizona Suns player Shaquille Harrison signing his own 10-day contract that day. Harrison signed his second 10-day contract on March 3 before signing a multi-year contract with Phoenix on March 13. ====Trades==== On September 22, 2017, the same day they had former #1 pick Anthony Bennett join their training camp roster, the Suns traded their own top-55 protected second round pick to the Memphis Grizzlies (which wasn't be conveyed to Memphis) in exchange for shooting guard Troy Daniels and a second round pick of their own, which was the middle choice between the Charlotte Hornets, Memphis, and the Miami Heat (which ultimately became Charlotte's second round pick). A month later, before the Suns fired head coach Earl Watson, star point guard Eric Bledsoe released a Tweet on Twitter saying he didn't want to be with the team. As a result of that tweet, he was sent home for the disruption. Teams that had talked with the Suns for their disgruntled star point guard included the Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, New York Knicks, and Cleveland Cavaliers. While waiting for a potential trade, they eventually let Bledsoe return for practices with the squad, but didn't allow him to play in games. Ultimately, a trade with the Milwaukee Bucks was made November 7, 2017. In that deal, the Suns received center Greg Monroe (who was on an expiring contract), a protected first round pick that'd be conveyed in 2018 (if it was at picks #11-16; 2019 if it's at picks #4-18; 2020 if it's at picks #8-30; or 2021 as a fully unprotected pick, and a second round pick that was conveyed to Phoenix if it was at picks #48-60 or be conveyed to the Brooklyn Nets later on by the end of the season; and Greg Monroe was waived by having his contract be bought out on January 31, 2018. Finally, on the February 8, 2018 trade deadline, the Suns traded the Charlotte Hornets' second round pick they previously acquired from the Troy Daniels deal in exchange for point guard Elfrid Payton from the Orlando Magic for at least the rest of the season. ===Front office changes=== While general manager Ryan McDonough was originally confirmed to remain as the team's general manager and President of Basketball Operations on April 19, 2017 for at least one more season, he was given a contract extension to remain for both roles throughout the end of the decade on July 19, 2017. While McDonough never lead the team to the playoffs throughout his original tenure (having a winning season only in his first year as general manager and being named the runner-up for the NBA Executive of the Year that year), what won him over was the youth movement that he arranged.. Furthermore, on that same day, it was announced that former Suns player and three-time NBA Finals champion small forward/shooting guard James Jones was the new Vice President of Basketball Operations, to oversee basketball matters for the team like upcoming draft picks, trades, and free agency moves.http://www.nba.com/suns/suns-extend-ryan-mcdonough-general- manager-name-ames-jones-vice-president-basketball-operations ===Coaching changes=== On October 22, 2017, after having two of some of the worst losses in franchise history to start the season, the Suns fired head coach Earl Watson. That same day, the Suns hired Canadian associate head coach Jay Triano to be interim head coach for the rest of the season. Later on that day, the Suns also fired assistant coaches Nate Bjorkgren, Mehmet Okur, and Jason Fraser. A day later, it was announced that the head coach of the Northern Arizona Suns affiliate team, Tyrone Ellis, was named as one of the new assistant coaches, with Marlon Garnett also being promoted as a full-time assistant coach that same day. However, Tyrone wasn't officially called over until October 24, 2017, alongside Northern Arizona Suns assistant coaches Bret Burchard and Brandon Rosenthal taking over some of the vacant coaching spots for the Phoenix Suns (with Tyler Gatlin being left to take over as the head coach for the G League squad for the preseason before returning as assistant (and later associate) coach for Cody Toppert's new coaching staff for Northern Arizona's regular season). For Northern Arizona, they found their newest assistant coaches to join Tyler Gatlin on November 20 with Nick Friedman and two-time former Phoenix Suns (and one-time Bakersfield Jam player back when the Northern Arizona squad was called that) center Earl Barron joining that newly completed coaching staff for the season. During the season, Phoenix also looked to target potential new coaching candidates, including former Memphis Grizzlies head coach David Fizdale, former Suns and current (at the time) Utah Jazz assistant coach Igor Koko\u0161kov, and Villanova University head coach Jay Wright around the conclusion of the season.http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/nba-rumors-news-coaches-fired-hot- seat-david-fizdale-lakers-suns-magic-knicks- pistons/ivyy667icovh1xftio43vtxxw?src=rsshttps://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2018/3/6/17084588/mcdonough- riffs-on-suns-off-season-coaching-search-draft-and-free- agencyhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2018/03/15/phoenix-suns- ryan-mcdonough-jay-triano-coaching-search/429303002/ In fact, on March 23, 2018, it was confirmed by general manager Ryan McDonough that the team has begun their coaching search earlier than anticipated.http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22877476/phoenix-suns-gm-says- team-already-beginning-search-new-head-coach ==Roster== ===Salaries=== {| style=\"width:250px;\" class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" ! style= width=\"55%\"| Player ! style= width=\"55%\"| 2017\u201318 Salary |- | Brandon Knight | style=\"text- align:right;\"|$13,618,750 |- | Tyson Chandler | style=\"text- align:right;\"|$13,000,000 |- | Jared Dudley | style=\"text- align:right;\"|$10,000,000 |- | Alan Williams | style=\"text- align:right;\"|$6,000,000 |- | Josh Jackson | style=\"text- align:right;\"|$5,090,040 |- | Dragan Bender | style=\"text- align:right;\"|$4,468,800 |- | Alex Len | style=\"text-align:right;\"|$4,200,000 |- | Troy Daniels | style=\"text-align:right;\"|$3,408,520 |- | Elfrid Payton | style=\"text-align:right;\"|$3,332,340 |- | T.

However, after waiving Leandro Barbosa, the Suns still owed him about $500,000 of guaranteed money. Similarly, because the Suns waived both Derrick Jones Jr. and Mike James earlier than anticipated, they'd only receive $385,625 and around $250,000 of guaranteed money this season respectively. The Suns also bought out Greg Monroe's contract for the year, which cost $17,884,176 for this season only (with Phoenix receiving $1,500,000 back after Greg signed his new deal with the Boston Celtics), as well as give Isaiah Canaan his full salary of $1,069,308 after he was waived. Furthermore, because of the sliding scale, the newly implemented two-way contracts, earning as little as $75,000 and about as much as $279,000 in a season, depending on where they play under a majority of their time, players like Mike James at the time, late second round rookie Alec Peters, and Danuel House did not affect their salary cap, regardless of how much they get paid for throughout the season. ==Pre-season== This pre-season marked the first pre-season where the number of games was intentionally shortened for the purpose of better quality control as the season continued onward, going from the usual 7-8 games to 5 games. It was also announced on July 31 that the Suns would play a preseason game against the Brisbane Bullets from the NBL in Australia on October 13 at the Talking Stick Resort Arena. Their official preseason schedule was announced a day later, with the only other NBA teams the Suns being the Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz both on the road and at home. While the Suns started and closed the preseason out strongly, they had a tough time in the middle of it, ending the preseason with a 2\u20133 record. |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 1 | October 3 | @ Portland | | T.J.

Two days later, during the Final Four in San Antonio, it was confirmed that former 1970's Suns player Charlie Scott and former Suns CEO and executive Rick Welts would join them as well. This made them the first team to have four former players of theirs entering the Basketball of Fame in the same year. *On April 6, 2018, Devin Booker became the first Suns player to be invited to the Team USA Basketball squad since Amar'e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion back in 2004. *Josh Jackson was named a member of an All-NBA Second Rookie Team this season on May 22, 2018. He earned the honor above Edrice Adebayo for his improved performances entering 2018. He was the second Suns player to earn that honor, with Marquese Chriss getting in last year, as well as the third year a Suns rookie was in an All-Rookie Team with Devin Booker being on the All-NBA Rookie First Team in 2016. ====Week/Month==== *Josh Jackson was be named a consistent candidate for the Western Conference's Rookie of the Month starting in the calendar month of 2018 onward. ====All-Star==== *Devin Booker was announced to participate in the three-point contest for the second time in three years on January 23, 2018. While Booker injured himself on February 4 against the Charlotte Hornets, which left him out most of the month, he was still able to participate in the three-point contest. **Three days after making his playing return against the Utah Jazz, he won the three-point contest over finalists Tobias Harris and Klay Thompson on February 17, 2018. To win, Booker first tied Thompson with 19 points scored in the first round before recording a record-high 28 points to win the final round over Harris' 17 points and Thompson's 25 points. He became the second Suns player to win the three-point contest, joining Quentin Richardson in 2005. *Josh Jackson was named the last member of the All-NBA Second Rookie Team on May 22, 2018. ===Records=== *Mike James became the first two-way contract player in NBA history to start in an NBA game, doing it on October 23, 2017 under interim head coach Jay Triano for the first win of the season. *On October 28, 2017, Devin Booker hit 258 three- pointers in the NBA before turning 21 years old. That breaks the record previously set by Bradley Beal at 229 before he became 21 years old himself. *With the 34 point performance he had that night, he officially had the third- most 30+ point games in the NBA before turning 21 years old, with him getting what'd be his 21st 30+ game there. *He'd also end his time as a 20-year-old player by scoring 2,897 points in the NBA, still being the fourth youngest player in the NBA to do so before turning 21 years old. *Devin Booker became the fifth active player in NBA history to have at least 28 games of 30 or more points in 175 games in the league, joining Vince Carter, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Kevin Durant. *On January 29, 2018, the Phoenix Suns took the record for the most NBA games played where they made at least one three-pointer in each game (reaching the record of 1,109 games with that status), starting in the 2004-05 season and breaking that record early in the first quarter that night by a three-pointer from Troy Daniels. *Marquese Chriss becomes the third-youngest player to record 100 career steals, blocks, and three-pointers on January 31, 2018 in their 102\u201388 win over the Dallas Mavericks. The only players younger than him to do that were LeBron James and Kevin Durant, with Kobe Bryant being the only other player under 21 years old to be a part of that record. *Shaquille Harrison became the first player since Mario Chalmers in 2008 to having two of his first four games involve four or more steals in each of those games. He also joined Alvan Adams as the only Suns players to have that same feat during their first four games of their rookie seasons. *Devin Booker became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 4,000 points at 21 years, 143 days, reaching that mark by recording 39 points (and 6 rebounds and 8 assists) in a 124\u2013116 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on March 2, 2018. The only players younger than him to reach that mark at such a young age are LeBron James at 20 years old and Kevin Durant at 21 years, 66 days old.https://www.nba.com/video/2018/03/03/20180302-gametime-devin-booker- star#/ ===Team records=== *Mike James becomes the first rookie since Walter Davis to record at least four straight games of 10+ points in their first four games with the franchise as a rookie. *Isaiah Canaan becomes the first bench player in franchise player to record his first two games with at least 15 points and 5 assists in each game he came off the bench. *Elfrid Payton recorded 9 assists in a 123\u2013113 loss to the Denver Nuggets on February 10, 2018. That was the most for a new point guard coming to Phoenix in his first game since Stephon Marbury made his Suns debut back in 2001. *Elfrid Payton recorded a triple-double with 13 points, 12 assists, and 11 rebounds in only his third game with the Suns in a 107\u201397 loss to the Utah Jazz on February 14, 2018. This resulted in the quickest triple-double for a new Suns player in franchise history, breaking the record previously held by the late Connie Hawkins in his fifth game back in 1969. *Shaquille Harrison made his NBA debut with 4 steals on February 23, 2018 in a 128\u2013117 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. That was the most steals for a Suns player's debut game since Alvan Adams back in his rookie year of 1975. *Alec Peters broke the franchise record for most three-pointers made by a rookie on April 10, 2018 in a blowout 124\u201397 win over the Dallas Mavericks at the end of the season. He broke the record previously held by Devin Booker, who had 6 in his rookie season for a game. ===Milestones=== *Tyson Chandler overtook center Sam Lacey to become the 41st highest rebounder in NBA history. Chandler recorded 9 rebounds in the second game of the season on October 19, 2017 with a 132\u2013130 loss over the Los Angeles Lakers. *Tyson Chandler also tied power forward Shawn Kemp to become the 48th best shot blocker in NBA history with a block that same night. He surpassed Kemp five days later with a single block in a 97\u201388 win over the Utah Jazz. *Tyson Chandler overtook Hall of Fame center Bob Lanier to become the 40th highest rebounder in NBA history a day later on October 21. He'd get to 10-12 rebounds early in the third quarter to overtake Bob Lanier's position and reach the 9,700 rebound threshold respectively before ending the night with 14 rebounds in a blowout 130\u201388 loss on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers. *Tyson Chandler later tied both Hall of Fame small forward Julius Erving and center Greg Ostertag to become the 46th best shot blocker in league history, thanks to a single block in a 108\u2013106 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 16, 2017. Chandler became the sole possessor of that mark ten days later with a block involved in his improbable buzzer-beating 99\u201397 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. *Tyson Chandler wound up becoming only the 40th player in NBA history to reach the historic 10,000 rebound barrier. He recorded his 10,000th rebound in the fourth quarter on January 14, 2018 against the Indiana Pacers. Chandler recorded 14 rebounds that night to reach 10,003 total rebounds in a loss to Indiana. *Tyson Chandler overtook Johnny Kerr to become the 39th highest rebounder in NBA history. He recorded 4 rebounds in an injury ridden 122\u2013115 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on March 10, 2018. ===Team milestones=== *Eric Bledsoe surpassed both former point guards Kyle Macy and Stephon Marbury as the team's newest 24th best scorer in franchise history on October 19, 2017 in a close 132\u2013130 loss over the Los Angeles Lakers in what was to be the penultimate game for Earl Watson as head coach of the Suns and for Eric as a Suns player. Bledsoe recorded a three- pointer in the first quarter to tie Macy's mark before making two free-throws and another three-pointer to not only surpass Macy by the end of the first quarter, but easily surpass Marbury with two more baskets early in the third quarter; he'd end the game with 28 points in a rather unfortunate, yet close loss that night. *Early in the season, Alex Len tied former teammate Channing Frye (who has 286 blocks with Phoenix) as the 11th best shot blocker in Phoenix Suns history. He recorded a block on October 28, 2017 in a 114\u2013107 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. He then overtook Frye's spot on November 1, 2017 with a block at 8:16 in the second quarter in a comeback 122\u2013116 win over the Washington Wizards. *Jared Dudley surpassed former center James Edwards as the team's newest 30th best scorer in team history. Jared hit that mark early in the first quarter by scoring a lay-up and a three-pointer early in the first quarter (ending the quarter with 8 points) on November 8, 2017 in a 126\u2013115 loss against the Miami Heat. Not too long afterward, Dudley surpassed his two-time former teammate Markieff Morris (once with the Suns and once with the Washington Wizards) to be the 29th best scorer in team history in the same game, finishing the night off with 13 points total before the end of the third quarter. He reverted to the 30th best scorer before the end of the season via Devin Booker breaking through his scoring barrier by March 2018. *Not long afterward, Alex Len overtook former Suns power forward/center Clifford R. Robinson to make it into the Suns' top 10 for blocked shots in terms of tenures with the franchise. He recorded two blocks to go with a double-double of 21 points and 13 rebounds on November 10, 2017 in a 128\u2013112 blowout loss to the Orlando Magic. *Devin Booker and T.J. Warren became be the first teammates since Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire did it back on March 31, 2008 to record a game where they both scored at least 35 points in the same night, doing so on November 11, 2017 in a 118\u2013110 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. *Devin Booker became the first Suns player since Charlie Scott back in 1973 to have seven 30+ point games during the first 17 games of a regular season. *On November 24, 2017, Alex Len became the 10th player in franchise history to record 300 blocks with the Phoenix Suns. He recorded 2 blocks to reach #300 in a blowout 115\u201391 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. *Center Alex Len surpassed former power former Garfield Heard as the 9th best shot blocker in franchise history. He surpassed Garfield Heard's spot on December 7, 2017 with two blocks in the first half against the Washington Wizards before the team lost 109\u201399 under their first game without Devin Booker due to a relatively serious injury at the time. *Center Tyson Chandler became only the fifth Suns player in franchise history to record 10,000 rebounds throughout an entire career, joining Paul Silas, Charles Barkley, Shawn Marion, and Shaquille O'Neal on January 14, 2018 in a blowout loss against the Indiana Pacers. *Jared Dudley became only the 29th player in franchise history to break the 4,000 point barrier with the Suns, doing it by reaching the mark on January 29, 2018 against the Memphis Grizzlies, with the first two free-throws he made at the start of the second quarter before recording 13 points in a 120\u2013109 loss in Memphis. *In only his third season in the NBA, Devin Booker overtook both former center James Edwards and his former teammate in power forward Markieff Morris to become the team's newest 30th best scorer in franchise history, doing so around the end of February 2018. On February 26, 2018, Booker recorded 40 points to go with 10 rebounds and 7 assists in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans to overtake James Edwards, while he'd overtake Markieff Morris as the 30th best scorer in franchise history two days later on February 28 with a three-pointer in the second quarter, with Booker ending the game with 34 points scored in a 110\u2013102 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. *Not long afterward, Booker became the 30th player in franchise history to break through the 4,000 point barrier on March 2 in a 124\u2013116 loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder. During that game, Booker had 39 points to go with 8 assists and 6 rebounds to break through that barrier with 4,010+ points in only his third season in the league. *On that same night, center Alex Len tied former center Oliver Miller to become the team's 8th best shot blocker in franchise history. He tied that mark by tying a career-high 6 blocks in that loss against the Thunder. Len surpassed Oliver Miller with a block against Oklahoma City six days later on March 8. *On March 4, 2018, Devin Booker overtook his teammate, Jared Dudley, to be the 29th highest scorer in franchise history in a close, heartbreaking 113\u2013112 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. During that game, Booker recorded 20 points, while Dudley didn't play. *Four days later, Devin Booker overtook former shooting guard and current broadcaster Eddie Johnson to be the 28th highest scorer in franchise history. In that game, he scored 30 points in a blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. ==Injuries/Personal games missed== {| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
