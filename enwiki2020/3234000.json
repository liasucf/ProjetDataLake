    "text": "Pararosaniline, Basic Red 9, or C.I. 42500 is an organic compound with the formula [(H2NC6H4)3C]Cl. It is a magenta solid with a variety of uses as a dye.Thomas Gessner and Udo Mayer \"Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It is one of the four components of basic fuchsine. (The others are rosaniline, new fuchsine and magenta II.)Horobin RW, Kiernan JA (2002) Conn's Biological Stains, 10th ed. Oxford: BIOS. It is structurally related to other triarylmethane dyes called methyl violets including crystal violet, which feature methyl groups on nitrogen. It is prepared by the condensation of aniline and para-aminobenzaldehyde. Alternatively, it arises from the oxidation of 4,4'-bis(aminophenyl)methane in the presence of aniline. ==Uses== *It is used to dye polyacrylonitrile fibers. *Pararosaniline is used as a colorimetric test for aldehydes, in the Schiff test. It is the only basic fuchsine component suitable for making the aldehyde-fuchsine stain for pancreatic islet beta cells. *It has use as an Antischistosomal (1962 to Parke Davis & Co). ==References== ==Further reading== *. *.
