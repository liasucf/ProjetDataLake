    "text": "Examine.com is a Canadian company that runs an online encyclopedia covering health, nutrition and supplementation. The website collates scientific research using evidence-based practice methodology. Examine.com is led by Kamal Patel, and includes scientists, editors and peer reviewers. ==History== Examine.com was founded in 2011 by University of Toronto alumnus Sol Orwell, and Kurtis Frank, a dietetics graduate from the University of Guelph. The company began with a focus on supplementation research, but expanded into nutrition as it continued to grow. During the initial research that led to the company's founding, co-founder Sol Orwell noticed that \"outlandish claims were muddling the waters\" of nutrition and supplementation, leading to the site's standard of evidence-based analysis. In 2014, the company began directly reviewing nutrition research in a digest tailored to the \"serious enthusiast or professional.\" Men's Fitness named Sol Orwell a 2014 Game Changer for his work on Examine.com and for providing \"hype-free, science-sourced information relatable to the masses.\" In 2015, Forbes interviewed Orwell about his \"seven- figure business,\" and Fast Company included Examine.com as one of the top ten innovative companies in fitness. As of September 2016, the website said that it had over 50,000 references. By 2020, the website was being used by mainstream media like The New York Times as a supplements reference in the context of strength-building advice and understanding the role of supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic. The same year, inspired by GiveWell, Examine.com started publicly disclosing the mistakes they had committed and how they were fixing them. ==Company structure== Remaining unbiased is named as a priority in the site's mission statement. Examine.com only reviews research and supplement ingredients, rather than specific products. On the company blog, Examine.com publishes rebuttals to cases of exaggerated marketing of nutrition and supplementation products. Co-founder Kurtis Frank said the long-term goal for Examine.com is creating \"the largest database of supplemental information that is both accurate and digestible.\" ==See also== * Natural Standard * Dietary supplement * Media transparency * Sol Orwell * Kamal Patel (researcher) * Comparison of supplements by different brands: ** ConsumerLab.com ** Labdoor, Inc ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies established in 2011 Category:Internet properties established in 2011 Category:Media analysis organizations and websites Category:Evidence-based practices ",
