    "text": "H\u00e9roes Inmortales XII (Spanish for \"Immortal Heroes twelve\") was a professional wrestling event produced and scripted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA). The event took place on October 28, 2018, in Gimnasio Miguel Hidalgo in Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. It was the twelfth annual AAA show held in honor of deceased founder Antonio Pe\u00f1a, and featured the Copa Antonio Pe\u00f1a tournament named in his honor. The main event was a Lucha de Apuestas or \"bet match\" where both Jeff Jarrett and Dr. Wagner Jr. will bet their hair on the outcome of the match. The show also featured the 2018 Copa Antonio Pe\u00f1a tournament, a match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship, the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship and two additional matches ==Production== ===Background=== In 1992 then-Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) booker and match maker Antonio Pe\u00f1a left the company alongside a number of wrestlers to form the Mexican professional wrestling, company Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n, later known simply as \"AAA\". Over the next decade-and-a-half Pe\u00f1a and the team behind AAA built the promotion into one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world. On October 5, 2006 Pe\u00f1a died from a heart attack. After Pe\u00f1a's death his brother-in-law Jorge Roldan took control of the company with both his wife Marisela Pe\u00f1a, Antonio's sister, and Dorian Roldan (their son) also taking an active part in AAA. On October 7, 2007,AAA held a show in honor of Pe\u00f1a's memory, the first ever \"Antonio Pe\u00f1a Memorial Show\" (Homenaje an Antonio Pe\u00f1a in Spanish). The following year AAA held the second ever \"Antonio Pe\u00f1a Memorial Show\", making it an annual tradition for the company to commemorate the passing of their founder. In 2008 the show was rebranded as H\u00e9roes Inmortales (Spanish for \"Immortal Heroes\"), retroactively rebranding the 2007 and 2008 event as H\u00e9roes Inmortales I and H\u00e9roes Inmortales II. AAA has held a H\u00e9roes Inmortales every year since then, with the 2018 version of the show being H\u00e9roes Inmortales XII (12). The H\u00e9roes Inmortales hosts the Copa Antonio Pe\u00f1a (\"Antonio Pe\u00f1a Cup\") tournament each year, a multi-man tournament with various wrestlers from AAA or other promotions competing for a trophy. The tournament format has usually been either a gauntlet match or a multi-man torneo cibernetico elimination match. ===Storylines=== The H\u00e9roes Inmortales XII show will feature eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (t\u00e9cnicos in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. ==Results== ==References== Category:2018 in professional wrestling Category:2018 in Mexico 2017 Category:October 2018 events in Mexico ",
