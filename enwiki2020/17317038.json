According to common belief Ko\u00e7kar Ata is from Teke Turcomans. In his time the people were making the rams fight and since his ram was the champion of each match, he was named as Kochkar. His real name is not to be known. After Ko\u00e7kar Ata's death, his ram could not resist the separation and it died on his grave. So a ram statue had been put over Ko\u00e7kar Ata's grave. There is scripture in Arabic alphabet as\"ya Allah, ya Muhammed, ya Ali\". There are many legends about the city \"Kochkor- Ata\" in Kyrgyzstan and why that place became sacred. Some people say that Kockar/Kochkor Ata was a Muslim saint and was buried in that place after his death. Since then, the place of his burial became a place of pilgrimage for many people. Others connect the history of Kochkor Ata shrine with Kyrgyz folklore. Thus, Kazakh ethnographer Chokan Valikhanov mentions that Kazakh sultan Barak, who lived at the end of the 18th century, \u201cbecame careless, and showing off his strength he invaded the sacred place of the Kyrgyz, Koshkar Ata.\u201d The Kirghiz became angry, attacked Barak\u2019s camp, and pursued his army as far as the Ili River. \u201cThe Kirghiz,\u201d writes Valikhanov, \u201cattributed their enemies\u2019 escape to the holiness of Kochkor Ata\" [Valikhanov 1985, p. 375]. There is another legend told by a man from Cholpon Ata, who said that Arslanbab (a mazar in Southern Kyrgyzstan) had seven children. And the seven mazars, Oisul Ata, Karakol Ata, Sh\u00efng Ata, Manzh\u00efl Ata, Cholpon Ata, Kochkor Ata, Oluia Ata, were built in their honor [Abramzon 1975, p. 304]. It is worth noting that in the Soviet period, as part of the effort to discourage Islamic practice, the authorities undertook severe measures to prevent worship at mazars. ==List of villages named after \"Kockar Ata\"== *Kirgistan: 1.Kochkor- Ata, 2.Kochkor, 3.Ak-Kochkor, 4.Kochkar *Tadjikistan: Khodzha-Kochkari *Russia: Kochkari (near Kazan in Tatarstan) *Syria: Kouchkar (area of the Sis Afshars between the 14th and 16th centuries) ==External links== *\"Ahmet Yesevi University\" *\"About Kyrgyz city Kochkor Ata and Kockar Atas legend\" *\"Report in turkish language\" Category:Kyrgyzstani Muslims Category:12th-century people ",
