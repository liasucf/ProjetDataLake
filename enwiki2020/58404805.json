    "text": "Clone of the Universe is the twelfth studio album by American stoner rock band Fu Manchu, released on February 9, 2018 on At The Dojo Records. The album features a guest appearance by Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson on its closing track, the 18-minute mostly instrumental \"Il Mostro Atomico.\" It was produced by Jim Monroe. ==Reception== In Metacritic, the album received 78 out of a 100. Exclaim! writer Matthew Ritchie said in his review about the album: \"Due to the first half's measly runtime (half of its high octane songs clock in at under three minutes) and heavy as hell ending, listening to Clone of the Universe kind of feels like visiting a tapas bar with a few friends, only to drunkenly venture off at the end of the night to slam down a whole duck, solo (and no, that's not a euphemism): it's a journey most would avoid making, but a compelling one for those willing to roll the dice and ride\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Scott Hill - vocals, guitar *Bob Balch - lead guitar *Brad Davis - bass guitar *Scott Reeder - drums ===Guest appearance=== *Alex Lifeson - lead guitar on Track 7 ===Additional personnel=== *Carl Saff - mastering ==References== Category:Fu Manchu (band) albums Category:2018 albums ",
