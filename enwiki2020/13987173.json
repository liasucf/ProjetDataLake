    "text": "Formula Renault 2.0 Alps was a category of Formula Renault open-wheel racing, created by the merging of the Formula Renault 2.0 Middle European Championship (formerly known as Formula Renault 2.0 Switzerland) and Formula Renault 2.0 Italia. ==Overview== With circuit racing forbidden in Switzerland, the championship is held in bordering countries like France (Dijon, Magny-Cours, Pau), Germany (Hockenheim), Italy (Imola, Monza, Mugello, Misano) and Austria (Salzburg, Red Bull Ring). However, in recent years the championship has visited farther countries like Belgium (Spa-Francorchamps) and Spain (Jerez, Barcelona). The cars use Tatuus chassis and the 2.0 L Renault Clio engines like other Formula Renault 2.0 series. Michelin is the tyres supplier. ==Current point system== Points are awarded as following : {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Position||1st||2nd||3rd||4th||5th||6th||7th||8th||9th||10th |- !Points||25|||18||15||12||10||8||6||4||2||1 |} In each race, one bonus point are given for pole position and one point for fastest lap. Only classified drivers are awarded points for finish position. ==Champions== ===Formula Renault 2.0 Switzerland/Middle Europe=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:85%;\" |+ Renault Speed Trophy F2000 !
