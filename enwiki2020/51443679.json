    "text": "Gerald Gurr (born 20 October 1946 in Brighton) is a former footballer. ==Playing career== Gurr began his career at Arsenal as a young player, initially as a forward player,http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/17407/saints- legends-you-have-never-heard-of-part-10 in 1962 before moving to join QPR's academy in 1963. While at QPR, Gurr had trials at other league clubs including Leicester City and Northampton Town. After leaving QPR he joined Guilford City in late 1963. While playing for Guilford he was spotted by Southampton and handed a trial in January 1964. This trial proved successful and he joined Southampton as a pro later that year. However it was to be another three years before Gurr made his debut for Southampton against Leicester City at The Dell on 14 January 1967 in a 4\u20134 draw. In this game the then 20-year-old Gurr saved a penalty. His performance in this game despite conceding four times was good with manager Ted Bates promising the young 'keeper that he would keep his place. However an injury meant he missed out and on his return in a reserves friendly against local rivals Portsmouth he again performed well, but not well enough to stop manager Bates signing Eric Martin from Dunfermline Athletic. It would be 20 months before Gurr got a chance in the First Division again. Gurr's performances over the 1968\u201369 season and at the beginning of the 1969\u201370 season were significant enough for some suggestions that he should receive a call-up to the England side; however injury would again provide a cruel blow with a shoulder injury effectively ending his Southampton career and international hopes. Gurr made 49 appearances in all competitions for Southampton, with 42 of those in the league. After Southampton, Gurr was persuaded to move to Fourth Division Aldershot Town, then managed by former Southampton teammate Jimmy Melia. He played 55 league games in the Fourth Division under Melia before ending his football career in 1972. ==After football== Gurr had always been an accomplished musician having played the guitar since the age of 8 and while at Southampton had assembled a band called 'The Sunsets' with teammates Mick Judd and Dave Paton. He now lives with his wife, Lee Ann, and daughter, and is now songwriting and recording his own material after being on the road with his wife for many years in many musical guises. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Guildford City F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Aldershot Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football goalkeepers ",
