The playoffs began on November 17 and concluded with the championship game on December 15. The field consisted of 28 teams, seven from each of the four super regions. The participants in each region were determined by the regional rankings; if a conference's highest-ranked team was ranked in the top nine, that team qualified via the \"earned access\" provision, and all other participants were selected directly from the rankings. The top seed in each region received a first-round bye. After the quarterfinals, the regional winners were reseeded one through four, with #1 meeting #4 in the semifinals and #2 meeting #3. ===Participating teams=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
