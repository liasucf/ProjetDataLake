During her time on the SNL, Cahill impersonated Pam Hurn and played recurring characters such as Denise Swerski, the daughter of Bob Swerski in the Bill Swerski's Superfans sketches and Pam, one of the \"Delta Delta Delta\" sorority girls, which Cahill performed alongside Melanie Hutsell and Siobhan Fallon.
