    "text": "Hate Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Orchestra, or simply Hate Songs, is an operatic song cycle for mezzo-soprano and orchestra by Norwegian composer Marcus Paus based on poetry by American poet Dorothy Parker. Paus' Hate Songs was published in 2014, and was included on Tora Augestad's and the Oslo Philharmonic's album Portraying Passion: Works by Weill/Paus/Ives (2018) with works by Paus, Kurt Weill and Charles Ives; it has received critical acclaim. It is based on the poem \"Women: A Hate Song\" published by Parker in Vanity Fair in 1916 and subsequent poems that have been described as \"a photo-book of New York with the female caricatures that Parker abhorred or despised, notably idle bourgeois ladies, who were the object of patriarchal worship as angelic domestic creatures.\"Francisco Jos\u00e9 Cort\u00e9s Vieco, \u2018I hate Women. They get on my Nerves\u2019 : Dorothy Parker's Poetry of Female Sympathy. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24197/ersjes.38.2017.65-88 Professor of musicology Ralph P. Locke wrote that Paus' Hate Songs \"proved to be one of the most engaging works\" in recent years; \"the cycle expresses Parker's favorite theme: how awful human beings are, especially the male of the species.\" Locke highlighted Augestad's recording of Hate Songs as one of the \"best opera and vocal music\" works in that year. ==Discography== *Tora Augestad and the Oslo Philharmonic, Portraying Passion: Works by Weill/Paus/Ives, LAWO Classics, 2018 ==References== Category:Compositions by Marcus Paus Category:Classical song cycles in English ",
