    "text": "The Music Band \u2013 Jazz is an album by War, the fifth and final entry in their \"Music Band\" series, released on MCA Records in 1983. It consists of outtakes from sessions for their 1979 albums The Music Band and The Music Band 2, and features several lineups of the band which existed that year. War were no longer recording for MCA when this album was released, and no singles from the album were issued. Track one was probably recorded/written in 1979, when B.B.Dickerson was still in band and before Charles Miller was murdered. Track two could have been recorded/written anytime up to 1979. The non-pictorial covers used in the Music Band series continued on this, and the previous volume, The Best of the Music Band (1982) which has a blue cover. Unlike earlier volumes, the last two were not made with elaborate printing methods, but were manufactured using normal four colour printing, without metallic print, embossing, gatefolds or innersleeves. ==Track listing== ===Side one=== #\"Five Spot\" (Papa Dee Allen, Harold Brown, B.B.
