After increasing the length of transmitter and receiver antennas, arranging them vertically, and positioning an antenna so that it touched the ground, Guglielmo significantly increased the range he could achieve.Marconi, \"Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1909.\" Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901\u20131921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196\u2013222. p. 206. Alfonso stood on one side of a hill near to the family home of Villa Griffone in Pontecchio, Italy, and fired a shot which was transmitted over the hill to Guglielmo: a distance of approximately . Guglielmo concluded that, with additional funding and research, a device could become capable of spanning greater distances and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily. ===Later life=== Alfonso Marconi was a director of the American International Marine Communication Company and an avid collector of stringed instruments. He died suddenly at a London hotel on the evening of Friday 24 April 1936 following a heart attack (his brother died following a heart attack in 1937).The Times, 28 April 1936, p.1 ==References== Category:1865 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:Italian expatriates in England Category:Italian nobility Category:Italian people of Scottish descent Category:Italian people of Irish descent Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People educated at Bedford School Category:People from Bologna ",
