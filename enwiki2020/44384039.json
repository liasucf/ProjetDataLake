    "text": "Svetlana Ivanovna Gerasimenko (; ) is a Soviet and Tajikistani astronomer of Ukrainian origin and discoverer of comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko. ==Discovery of comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko == On 11 September 1969 Gerasimenko while working at the Alma-Ata Astrophysical Institute, near Almaty, the then-capital city of Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union photographed the comet 32P/Comas Sol\u00e0 using a 50-cm Maksutov telescope. After returning to her home institute, Klim Ivanovych Churyumov of the Kiev National University's Astronomical Observatory examined this photograph and found a cometary object near the edge of the plate, but assumed that this was Comas Sol\u00e0. On 22 October, about a month after the photograph was taken, he discovered that the object could not be Comas Sol\u00e0, because it was 2-3 degrees off the expected position. Further scrutiny produced a faint image of Comas Sol\u00e0 at its expected position on the plate, thus proving that the other object was a different comet. By looking through all the material collected they found this new object on four more plates, dated 9 and 21 September. ==Honors== Named after her *Periodic comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko *Minor planet 3945 Gerasimenko ==See also== * Timeline of women in science ==References and notes== Category:1945 births Category:Cosmologists Category:Discoverers of comets Category:Women astronomers Category:Living people Category:Tajikistani scientists Category:Soviet astronomers Category:Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv alumni Category:People from Baryshivka Category:Tajikistani women scientists ",
