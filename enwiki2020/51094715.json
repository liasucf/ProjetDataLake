    "text": "The second season of The Great Australian Spelling Bee premiered on 17 July 2016 on Network Ten. The season sees Grant Denyer and Chrissie Swan return as hosts. Poor ratings for the four initial episodes of the season resulted in the series being moved from Sundays to the lesser viewed Saturday from its fifth episode. From its seventh episode, the show was moved to Network Ten's sister channel, Eleven. ==Format== This is the structure of the series for season two: ===Laser Letters=== In Laser Letters, a new challenge for 2016, each team stand behind a buzzer podium facing the big screen. The pronouncer will read out four words that appear via a laser projection on the big screen, visible for a short amount of time. To keep the spellers on their toes, one word will be spelt incorrectly. Once a speller thinks they have identified the mistake they must buzz in and spell the word correctly. When they identify and spell the word correctly they win a point for their team. The first two teams to get three points are safe and the other teams will go into the Spelling Bee. ===Letter by Letter Knock-Out=== Each speller takes a turn to give one letter at a time to spell a given word. When a speller gives the last letter of the word, the next speller states that word to signal that it is finished. The pronouncer then gives the next word, and the next speller spells out the first letter of that new word. The challenge continues until a speller makes a mistake. That speller is then out of the round and the challenge continues until there is one speller standing. Three rounds of Letter by Letter Knock Out are played to determine the three spellers to compete in the Ultimate Spelling Bee. The winner of the Ultimate Spelling Bee is the Spelling Bee champion. Tristan won the Great Australian Spelling Bee Champion for 2016. ===Show and Spell=== Each team member must line up behind a buzzer. Clues and letters are revealed until a speller buzzes to identify the word that the clues point to. If a speller spells a correctly identified word accurately, they gain a point for their team. The first two teams to reach a score of three are safe. The third and final team must face an individual Spelling Bee, where two members will be sent home. ===Speed Spell Duo=== With rules similar to Speed Spell Relay, this Speed Spell involves two spellers from the same team stepping into the Spell Gate together. The duo is given 60 seconds to spell as many words correctly as possible. The spellers will each spell one word at the time taking turns. When a speller makes a mistake that speller will step out of the Spell Gate and the other speller continues spelling. The challenge ends when 60 seconds have passed or both team members have made a mistake. Once all teams have had a turn, the bottom two teams will go into Spelling Bee. ===Speed Spell Relay=== This Speed Spell is a team relay challenge. One team at a time steps into the super-sized Spell Gate and is given 60 seconds to correctly spell as many words as possible. When a speller makes a mistake that speller will step out of the Spell Gate and the other team members continue. The challenge ends when 60 seconds have passed or all team members have made a mistake. The team with the fewest words spelt at the end of the round will go into Spelling Bee. ===Speed Spell Showdown=== Each speller steps into the Spell Gate, which lights up during a 60-second countdown. Spellers must spell as many words correctly as possible. If a mistake is made, the speller's time stops. The top speller who completes the most number of correct words in the least amount of time is safe from elimination, while the rest move on to play Spelling Bee. ===Spelling Bee (Individual Spelling)=== Spellers are divided into groups, with four spellers in each group. Members of each group compete in a traditional spelling bee, where they spell until there are only two spellers left. If all four spellers spell correctly or incorrectly in the same round, they will all spell again until two remain. ===Superword=== In Superword, duos have to find words in a grid of nine letters revealed on the big screen. Words must contain five letters or more and include the centre letter. Spellers can use a letter only once and cannot name a word already given by another team. Whenever a speller of a team thinks that they have identified a word, they buzz in. Once identified correctly they must spell the word correctly to win a point for their team. The first five teams to get three points are safe. If a duo identifies the Superword which uses all nine letters, they immediately receive safe passage to the next show. The two bottom teams will play in Spelling Bee. ===Superword (Individual Spelling)=== In Superword, spellers have to find words in a grid of nine letters revealed on the big screen. Words must contain five letters or more and include the centre letter. Spellers can use a letter only once and cannot name a word already given by another speller. Whenever a speller thinks they have identified a word they buzz in. Once identified correctly they must spell the word correctly to win a point. The first two spellers to get five points are safe. If a speller identifies the Superword using all nine letters, they immediately receive safe passage to the next show. The rest move on to play the Spelling Bee. ==Season Details== ===Contestants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Name ! scope=\"col\"| Age ! scope=\"col\"| State ! scope=\"col\"| Competition Status |-style=\"background:gold;\" | Tristan | 11 | VIC | Winner (Episode 10) |-style=\"background:silver;\" | Zachary | 8 | NSW | Runner-up (Episode 10) |-style=\"background:tan;\" | Annie | 10 | NSW | 3rd (Episode 10) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Ava | 10 | SA | 4th (Episode 10) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Zeke | 10 | VIC | 5th (Episode 9) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Zoe | 10 | QLD | 6th (Episode 8) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Jessica | 12 | NSW | 7th (Episode 7) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Hanna | 11 | VIC | 8th (Episode 7) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Max | 11 | QLD | 9th (Episode 6) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Luca | 9 | SA | 10th (Episode 6) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Josie | 11 | WA | 11th (Episode 5) |- |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Rory | 8 | QLD | 12th (Episode 5) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | William | 10 | NSW | 13th (Episode 4) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Beau | 12 | WA | 14th (Episode 4) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Alistair | 9 | QLD | 15th (Episode 3) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | James | 12 | QLD | 16th (Episode 3) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Arya | 10 | NSW | 17th (Episode 2) |-style=\"background:pink;\" | Faiza | 12 | QLD | 18th (Episode 2) |-style=\"background:pink;\" |} ===Elimination Chart=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Contestant ! scope=\"col\"| Top 18 ! scope=\"col\"| Top 16 ! scope-\"col\"| Top 14 ! scope-\"col\"| ! scope-\"col\"| ! scope-\"col\"| ! scope-\"col\"| ! scope-\"col\"| ! scope-\"col\"| ! scope-\"col\"| |- | Tristan | Safe (S&S;) | Safe (SSR) | Safe (SW) | Safe (S&S;) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | Progressed (LLKO) | style=\"background:gold;\"| Winner |- | Zachary | Safe (S&S;) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (SSR) | Safe (SW) | Safe (S&S;) | Safe (SSD) | Safe (LL) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (SW) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) |Progressed (LLKO) | style=\"background:silver;\"| |- | Annie | Safe (S&S;) | Safe (SSR) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (SW) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (S&S;) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (SSD) | Safe (LL) | Safe (SW) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"| | style=\"background:tan;\"| 3rd |- | Ava | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | Safe (SSR) | Safe (SW) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (S&S;) | Safe (SSD) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (LL) | style=\"background:orange;\"| Safe (SB) | style=\"background:lightgreen;\"|Safe (SS) | style=\"background:tomato;\"| 4th | style=\"background:grey;\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"| |- !
