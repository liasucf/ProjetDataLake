The majority of its inhabitants are from Hindu and Christian backgrounds. The primary crops are rubber, coconut, black pepper and plantain. The terrain is hilly with plenty of paddy fields in between. It is the commercial centre of Mezhuveli and Chenneerkara panchayaths. ==Geography And Transportation== Elavumthitta is nearly 12km from the district head quarter Pathanamthitta.Other nearby Towns are , Chengannur (14.5km), Pandalam (8km), Kozhencherry (11km) and Adoor (14km). * Nearest Railway Station = Chengannur Railway station (15 km) [Other nearby Railway Stations: Cheriyanad Railway Station (19 km) , Mavelikara railway Station (25 km), Thrivulla Railway Station (26km), Kayamkulam junction (34 km).] * Nearest Police Station = Elavumthitta Police station. * Nearest Airport = Thiruvananthapuram International Airport (107 km), Nedumbassery International Airport (130 km) Two main roads passes through Elavumthitta. One is Pathanamthitta - Elavumthitta - Chengannur. KSRTC is running chain service through this road. The other road is Adoor - Elavumthitta - Kozhencherry road. The average height of Elavumthitta is above mean sea level. The low lying water shed paddy fields around Elavumthitta is above mean sea level. There is a peak called Namakuzhy, above mean sea level 2 km. north of Elavumthitta. This peak can be considered as the highest spot in the area. There is a legend about this peak that the pandavas in exile visited this place and stayed here for a short while. There were giant size foot marks imprinted on rocks scattered above the hill believed to be of Bhima the mighty bare hand warrior of Mahabharat epic. And also there was a pit on the rock with perennial source of water; signs reinforcing the local beliefs. Elavumthitta is the catchment area of two major rivers, the Sacred Pampa and Achankovil. The abundant rainfall in the region supplements these two rivers for keeping the river not drying in summer season, and in return the two rivers keep this region abundant in ground water and save Elavumthitta from droughts. Almost every house got open wells for its water requirement. People of Elavumthitta never experienced a drought or flood situation in their life. Pamba river is in the north, 8 km away and Elavumthitta is in a much higher elevation; hence there is no flood in this region. The same thing is with Achankovil river, which is 5 km away in the western side of Elavumthitta. Elavumthitta was abundant in Streams and lush green paddy fields. There was a time; one could stand on a higher spot and enjoy the sight of endless coconut tree tops spreading its leaves and swaying in gentle breeze, a very pleasant sight indeed. ==Major townships around Elavumthitta== 1\\.

In the year of 1909 Mooloor S Padmanabha Panicker Who was a member of 'Sreemoolam Prajasabha' had established the Elavumthitta market in the 2 acres (8,100 m2) of land near the Elavumthitta Junction. He named the market as \"Sreemoolam Rajagopalavilasam\". ===Aswathy Festival=== The most important annual festival for the people of Elavumthitta is the Celebration of Aswathy in the Malayalam month of meenam. No doubt Onam is the biggest festival of every Keralite, but this Asawathy celebration is exclusively for the People of Elavumthitta. Every child in Elavumthitta will be waiting for this occasion; the tips he gets now and then- let the sum may be a meager one- is kept as his secret treasure; reserved for this great day. He has to buy many items. The seasonal crops of cashew is of great help; cashew picked up from here and there is sold and the amount may be a pittance in today's standard, but the thrill of spending it in the aswathy fair is something one will remember till his death. ===Cattle market=== A busy day at Elavumthitta cattle market. Cattle market is active on 9th and 22nd of every Malayalam month. Elavumthitta market popularly known as Elavumthitta Chantha (\u0d07\u0d32\u0d35\u0d41\u0d02\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f \u0d1a\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24) celebrated its 100th year in September 2009. The Cattle market is open on the 9th and 22nd of every Malayalam month. There is an important landmark in the middle of Elavumthitta- a huge banyan tree. How old the tree is, nobody knows, eight hundred years or more that is anybody's guess. Some say it is more than that. One thing is certain, that it gave shelter to generations of weary travelers, it witnessed the political changes of Kerala, listening fiery speeches of politicians who make makeshift stage on its platform now and then; unaffected by either political speeches or religious sermons; stand there majestically giving shelter to birds on its long branches with thick green foliage and feeding its seasonal fruits to the needy birds. ==First Sivagiri Pilgrimage== With the blessings of Sree Narayana Guru, five young bloods of Elavumthitta started the first \u2019Sivagiri Theertdhadanam\u2019 in the year 1932. In 1928 January 16 \u2013 the decision to start \u2018Sivagiri Theerdthadanam\u2019 was approved by Sri Narayana Guru It was decided to start the first pilgrimage from Elavumthitta. The S N D P unit No.76 of Elavumthitta selected 5 youngsters for the pilgrimage. Those 5 `Manjakkilikal\u2019 were: * P.K.Divakara Panicker - Son of Mooloor.S.Padmanabha Panicker * P.K.Kesavan - Plavunilkkunnathil * P.V.Raghavan - Ayathil Melepurathootu Veetil * M.K.Raghavan - Ayathil Edayilekizhakkethil * S.Sankunni - Thekkeveetil The team was led by Sri.P.K.Divakara Panicker. This was a historical journey that led to the famous Sivagiri pilgrimage conducted every year. Now thousands of devotees are following their path. The pilgrimage has become an occasion of unity and peace. 600px ==Mooloor S. Padman\u0101bha Panicker== Mooloor S. Padman\u0101bha Panicker (Sarasa kavi Mooloor) was one of the great poets and a prominent social reform activist from Travancore. He was born at Panayannaarkavu, close to the town of Mannar in Central Travancore in 1869 (Malayalam year Kumbhom 27, 1044 ). He named his residence in Elavumthitta as 'Kerala Varma Soudham' as a mark of respect towards Kerala Varma Valiyakoyi Thampuran who was his close friend. ==Arts and sports== People of Elavumthitta had no entertainment in earlier days other than the \"Aswathi Maholsvam\" celebrated once a year. Cinema halls are 10 to 20 km away. Convenient bus service to reach the cinema hall in time for the show or to come back from the show were not available then. Still some tough adventurists used to trek all the way to Pathanamthitta, Pandalam, Kozhencherry, or Chengannur wherever the popular pictures were shown. *Elavumthitta Cultural Club - ECC Affiliation number (ptm/tc/202/2018) *Mooloor Jyothis Arts & Sports Club, Ayathil (affiliation no.
