The flag was controversial for its use of the national emblem in its party flag, but the flag was later approved by the Ministry of the Interior. == Controversy == Soon after its founding in 2015, the party faced allegations that it was funded for religious causes, after it was revealed that prominent religious figure Chan Master Wujue Miaotian was supporting the party for the 2016 general election. Party leader Hsu Hsin-ying denied the allegations, stating that the party \"belongs to the people\". ==Electoral history== Party chair Hsu Hsin-ying switched party affiliations from the Kuomintang to the Minkuotang midway through her term as Hsinchu County legislator. She ran for reelection in the 2016 legislative elections, but quit the race when People First Party chair James Soong chose her to be his vice presidential candidate. The MKT fielded four total candidates in the 2016 elections, and failed to win a seat. On 25 January 2019, the party was merged with the newly-formed Congress Party Alliance.https://www.storm.mg/article/778950 ===Local elections=== {| class=wikitable |- ! Election !
