This is evident in the cassette version of the release where one cassette has a label (covering the \"All or Nothing\" title typography) and the other cassette does not. The CD releases removes the original version of \"All or Nothing\" and the full-length Super Club Mix of \"Girl You Know It's True\" for disc space reasons. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1989 albums Category:Albums produced by Frank Farian Category:Milli Vanilli albums Category:Carrere Records albums ",
