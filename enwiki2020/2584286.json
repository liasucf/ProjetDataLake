The magazine was reborn and issued its next issue on 28 February 2017.Magazine gay tetu revient kiosque ==History== Published since 1995, co-founded by Didier Lestrade and Pascal Loubet, and historically directed by Pierre Berg\u00e9, T\u00eatu was started following the demise of Gai Pied magazine (published between 1979 and 1992). Pierre Berg\u00e9 sold the magazine in January 2013 and since then it has been owned by Jean-Jacques Augier. T\u00eatu declared bankruptcy in January 2015 and went into liquidation in July 2015 having made \u20ac1.1million ($1.2million) in losses in 2014. In November 2015 a French start-up, Idyls, bought T\u00eatu and it started publishing again online only. ==Overview== The magazine contains interviews on LGBT issues, with politicians, celebrities, writers, dancers and so forth, along with articles and reviews on LGBT-themed books, films, plays or video games. Another section is concerned with LGBT news around the world, country by country. There are also posters, advertisements of brand clothes for men. Additionally, some pages are dedicated to news about AIDS, prevention and treatment. Periodically a free information guide entitled T\u00eatu+ is published about HIV and AIDS. The magazine has also touched upon international cases when coming to LGBTQs public figures of non-French cultures. In October 2012, Tetu have sent reporters to Jordan to do a story on Jordanian LGBT magazine's spokesperson, model Khalid, aka Kali of My.Kali magazine. ==Controversy== In July 2011, Alexis Palisson featured in a topless pose in T\u00eatu wearing a fake moko and holding a taiaha. This caused controversy in New Zealand, with some Maori saying that Palisson was being disrespectful to their culture and that permission should have been sought from a particular iwi as the moko usually represents iwi affiliation. Palisson was eventually forced to apologise for any offence caused and stressed that he respects tattoo traditions. ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:1995 establishments in France Category:2015 disestablishments in France Category:Cultural magazines Category:French-language magazines Category:LGBT-related magazines published in France Category:Lifestyle magazines Category:Magazines established in 1995 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2015 Category:Magazines reestablished in 2017 Category:Magazines published in Paris ",
