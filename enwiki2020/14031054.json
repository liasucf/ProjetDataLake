    "text": "George Edward Francis (4 February 1934 \u2013 22 October 2014) was an English professional football centre forward, best remembered for his two spells in the Football League with Brentford. He is a member of the Brentford Hall of Fame and is synonymous with Jim Towers \u2013 their close friendship and strike partnership saw the pair dubbed 'The Terrible Twins'. == Career == === Early years === A centre forward, Francis began his career as a schoolboy with a team fielded by the Odeon cinema in his hometown of Acton. He regularly played against Jim Towers of the local Gaumont cinema team and the pair would later link up as professionals at Brentford. Francis later represented the Acton, Brentford & Chiswick schools' team. === Brentford === Francis signed for the junior team at Second Division club Brentford in 1949, after rejecting an offer from Blackburn Rovers. He progressed to the youth team and signed his first professional contract in January 1953, but had to wait until 1955 to make his first team debut, which came in a Third Division South match versus Walsall on 19 February. Francis had a dream start, scoring a late equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw. He made two further appearances in what remained of the 1954\u201355 season and scored another goal. Francis made a minor breakthrough into the first team during the 1955\u201356 season, making 18 appearances, scoring eight goals and beginning a strike partnership with friend Jim Towers. He made his full breakthrough in the 1956\u201357 season and scored 24 goals in 44 appearances. Francis' best season came in 1959\u201360, when he was an ever-present and scored 31 goals in 48 appearances. A memorable moment in his season was scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20132 victory at Loftus Road, home of West London rivals Queens Park Rangers. At the end of a lean 1960\u201361 season (in which Francis scored only 10 goals), the abolition of the maximum wage rule saw Francis and Towers depart the Bees. Francis scored 121 goals in 243 appearances over the course of six years in the first team at Griffin Park. === Queens Park Rangers === Francis and Towers joined Third Division club Queens Park Rangers in an \u00a38,000 deal in May 1961. Francis failed to last long at Loftus Road and scored three goals in as many appearances before departing in October 1961. === Return to Brentford === Francis returned to Brentford in October 1961 and immediately won his place back in the team, though his 14 league goals couldn't prevent the Bees from suffering relegation to Fourth Division. He departed the club at the end of the season, having made 37 appearances and scored 15 goals during his brief return. Across his two spells with Brentford, Francis made 280 appearances and scored 136 goals. He was inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame in March 2014. === Gillingham === Francis signed for Fourth Division club Gillingham in August 1962 for a \u00a34,000 fee. He scored 12 goals in 35 league games during the 1962\u201363 season, but the Gills missed out on promotion with a fifth-place finish. Five months into the season, Francis was joined by his old friend Jim Towers at the club. Though he made only 16 appearances, Francis scored seven goals during the 1963\u201364 season and scored the winner versus Newport County on the final day, which saw Gillingham clinch the Fourth Division championship. He departed the club at the end of the campaign, having scored 21 goals in 58 games for the Gills. === Non-league football === After his departure from Gillingham, Francis dropped into non-league football and closed out his career with spells at Southern League clubs Hastings United, Hillingdon Borough and Stevenage Town. == Personal life == Francis undertook his National Service together with Jim Towers in the Royal Irish Fusiliers in Germany. After retiring from football, he became a black cab driver and held a season ticket at Stamford Bridge. Francis died on 22 October 2014 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, after a long battle with bowel cancer. He was 80 years old. == Honours == Gillingham *Football League Fourth Division: 1963\u201364 Individual * Brentford Hall of Fame == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"8\" |Brentford |1954\u201355 | rowspan=\"4\" |Third Division South |3 |2 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |3 |2 |- |1955\u201356 |17 |7 |1 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |18 |8 |- |1956\u201357 |41 |23 |3 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |44 |24 |- |1957\u201358 |45 |22 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |46 |22 |- |1958\u201359 | rowspan=\"3\" |Third Division |45 |22 |4 |2 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |49 |24 |- |1959\u201360 |46 |26 |2 |5 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |48 |31 |- |1960\u201361 |31 |8 |2 |2 |2 |0 |35 |10 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !228 !110 !13 !11 !2 !0 !243 !121 |- |Queens Park Rangers |1961\u201362 |Third Division |2 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |1 |2 |3 |3 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Brentford |1961\u201362 |Third Division |32 |14 |5 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |37 |15 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Brentford total !260 !124 !18 !12 !2 !0 !280 !136 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Gillingham |1962\u201363 | rowspan=\"2\" |Fourth Division |35 |12 |3 |1 |1 |0 |39 |13 |- |1963\u201364 |16 |7 |0 |0 |3 |1 |19 |8 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !51 !19 !3 !1 !4 !1 !58 !21 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !311 !143 !21 !13 !6 !3 !338 !159 |} ==References== Category:1934 births Category:English footballers Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Hastings United F.C.
