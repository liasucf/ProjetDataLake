According to Lincoln Snacks, Poppycock was invented by Howard Vair in the 1950s as a snack to accompany him on road trips. In 1960, Wander, a Swiss company, bought the rights to Poppycock and moved production to their Villa Park, Illinois, facility. However, in 1969, a snack matching the description of Poppycock was patented by Arnold Rebane, who worked for the Wander Company. In 1991, Lincoln Snacks Company acquired Poppycock and on September 7, 2007, Lincoln Snacks was purchased by ConAgra Foods. The product is also now cross- branded with the Orville Redenbacher's brand. == See also == * Cracker Jack * Fiddle Faddle * Crunch 'n Munch * List of popcorn brands * Lolly Gobble Bliss Bombs == References == == External links == * Website Category:Popcorn brands Category:Nut dishes Category:Products introduced in 1950 Category:Villa Park, Illinois Category:Conagra Brands brands Category:Popcorn ",
