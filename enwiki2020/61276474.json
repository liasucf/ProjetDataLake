    "text": "Carmelita Torres was the \"red-haired Mexican woman\" known for starting the 1917 Bath riots on the Mexico-United States border between Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas. At the time of the riots, she was 17 years old and working as a maid in the United States. She has been called \"the Latina Rosa Parks\". == 1917 Bath riot == === Background === A new policy from the US required all workers to be bathed in a kerosene mixture to kill lice that may have been carrying typhus due to an outbreak in a few major Mexican cities, including Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In addition, all workers were stripped and inspected and their clothes were steam dried. The US health personnel running the inspections were found to have been secretly photographing the women they had stripped and posting the photos in local bars. There were previous tensions due to several Mexican prisoners in El Paso burning to death while being covered in gasoline. === Riot === On January 28 at 7:30 AM, Torres resisted the process and refused to go through it. She was asked to get out of her trolley and to begin the process. Instead, she convinced 30 other Mexican women to get out and protest with her. When others saw their resistance they joined in by protesting as well. Within an hour, there were more than 200 women blocking the entrance to El Paso. By the end of the demonstration, there were several thousand protesters. Once the officers tried to break up the crowd, the demonstrators threw rocks at them. They laid in front of trains and vehicles. When police aimed their guns into the crowd, they responded by yelling louder. The police were unable to break them up and she was arrested. === Afterwards === Despite the riot, the inspections continued for decades afterwards. == Legacy == A migrant home across the Stanton Street Bridge in El Paso, called Casa Camelita, is being named after her. == References == Category:1900 births Category:20th-century Mexican women Category:Immigrant rights activists Category:Mexican women activists Category:Year of death missing ",
