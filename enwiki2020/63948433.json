    "text": "In functional analysis, a topological vector space (TVS) is said to be quasi- complete or boundedly complete if every closed and bounded subset is complete. This concept is of considerable importance for non-metrizable TVSs. == Properties == * Every quasi-complete TVS is sequentially complete. * In a quasi-complete locally convex space, the closure of the convex hull of a compact subset is again compact. * In a quasi-complete Hausdorff TVS, every precompact subset is relatively compact. * If is a normed space and is a quasi-complete locally convex TVS then the set of all compact linear maps of into is a closed vector subspace of L_b(X;Y). * Every quasi-complete infrabarrelled space is barreled. * If is a quasi-complete locally convex space then every weakly bounded subset of the continuous dual space is strongly bounded. * A quasi-complete nuclear space then has the Heine\u2013Borel property. * In a locally convex quasi-complete space, the closed convex hull of a compact subset is again compact. == Examples and sufficient conditions == * Every complete TVS is quasi-complete. * The product of any collection of quasi-complete spaces is again quasi-complete. * The projective limit of any collection of quasi-complete spaces is again quasi-complete. * Every semi-reflexive space is quasi-complete. * The quotient of a quasi-complete space by a closed vector subspace may fail to be quasi-complete. === Counter-examples === * There exists an LB-space that is not quasi-complete. == See also == * Complete topological vector space * Complete uniform space == References == ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * Category:Functional analysis ",
