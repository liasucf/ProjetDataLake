L. No. 106-568, Title XIV (114 Stat. 2939), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1300n et. seq. (2000)Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress) == Early history == Prior to European contact, the residents of Marin and Sonoma Counties were bands of Native Californians belonging to two linguistic and cultural groups: the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo, living in close proximity to each other and indigenous to Marin and southern Sonoma Counties in Northern California. Occupied at various times during more than thirty centuries, over 600 village sites have been identified in the Coast Miwok territory, stretching from Bodega Bay to the north, eastward beyond the towns of Cotati and Sonoma, and along the Point Reyes National Seashore and the shores of Tomales Bay. The year 1579 was the earliest recorded account made by the Europeans of the Coast Miwok people on the coast of Marin in the Point Reyes area, as documented in a diary by Chaplain Fletcher who was aboard Sir Francis Drake's ship. In 1595, The Coast Miwok came into contact with the crew of the San Agustin, a Manila Galleon, captained by Sebasti\u00e3o Rodrigues Soromenho and crewed by Filipino mariners. During the Mission Period of 1779\u20131823, Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds (also called \"Mission Dolores\"), Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel and Mission San Francisco Solano used Indians, including the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people, as a key source of labor. As early as 1830, a Filipino married a Coast Miwok wife, starting a family who later settled in Lairds Landing. The family who descended from this multiracial couple remained there until 1955. Some of the Coast Miwok trace their lineage to this couple. The territorial lands of the Southern Pomo are in Sonoma County, south of the Russian River to the southern Santa Rosa area. The Southern Pomo were the first inhabitants of what is now the town of Sebastopol, with several smaller traditional Southern Pomo villages located southeast of Sebastopol along the Laguna de Santa Rosa. California anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber stated: :Batiklechawi, at Sebastapol at the head of the slough known as Laguna de Santa Rosa, was an important town, and therefore presumably the headquarters of a division [of the Southern Pomo]. Another group tentatively may be inferred as having occupied the bulk of the shores of the laguna.Kroeber, 233 ==Recent history== Most of the Coast Miwok continued to live in their traditional lands through the 20th century. They worked in sawmills, as agricultural laborers, and fished to supplement their incomes. The Graton Rancheria was a Indian rancheria near Sebastopol in Sonoma County. The rancheria was established for Coast Miwok, Southern Pomo, and other Indians living in the region. In 1920, when Indians began to settle the land, they discovered that all but were inhospitable. The US government terminated the trust agreement (federal recognition) of the Graton Rancheria in 1958. Gloria Armstrong (Miwok) privately owned a lot of the previous rancheria.\"California Indians and Their Reservations.\" San Diego State University Library and Information Access.
