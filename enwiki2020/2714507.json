These two cities in Hainaut, Belgium, still preserve works of the artist: a bronze Christ in the museum of history and archeology of Ath and a Pax Armata on the monument to the dead of Leuze. After attending evening classes in sculpture, Heuvelmans was admitted to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1904. She studied under the sculptors Laurent Marqueste, Emmanuel Hannaux (fr), and Denys Puech. After an unsuccessful bid in 1908, receiving the first second Grand Prix in 1910, Heuvelmans became the first woman to win the Grande Prix de Rome for sculpture in July 1911 for her work, The Sister of Orestes Guarding Her Brother's Sleep.. Admitted to the Villa Medici, she studied there from January 1912 to December 1914 under the direction of Albert Besnard. On her return to France, Heuvelmans was appointed professor of drawing in the schools of the City of Paris. She installed her studio on the ground floor and the mezzanine of 17, rue des Tournelles in the rear wing of the hotel de Rohan-Gu\u00e9men\u00e9. The hotel's main facade overlooks the Place des Vosges in the 4th arrondissement. She regularly participated in exhibitions at the Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais where she earned an honorable mention in 1907, then a bronze medal in 1921, and at the Salon des artistes d\u00e9corateurs in the Grand Palais between 1926 and 1933. From 1924 to 1926, she completed commissions for the Manufacture de S\u00e8vres. Lucienne Heuvelmans received the insignia of Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1926 under the Ministry of Fine Arts (Decree of 22 May 1926). In the early 1930s, she settled in Brittany in Saint-Cast-le-Guildo. She specialized in ancient mythology and religious art. Heuvelmans died on February 26, 1944 in Saint-Cast at the age of 62, she rests in the family burial plot of the Heuvelmans in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery. ==Her work== There is no catalog raisonn\u00e9 of the work of Lucienne Heuvelmans.
