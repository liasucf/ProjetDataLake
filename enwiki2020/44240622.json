Nastos states: \"As Albert Ayler recorded several definitive recordings before or after this one, and due to the very short length of Bells, it cannot be considered a magnum opus. But it does contain music played by his most powerful unit, a small window into the mind and heart of the most iconic maverick in the free jazz movement, and a magnet for discussion that lingers on well past his death\".Nastos, M. G., Allmusic Review accessed October 28, 2014 All About Jazz commented: \"Part of the lasting brilliance of Bells is that the group is much more roughshod at this early stage, the ensemble not yet formed into a cohesive, balanced whole but a rickety patchwork, its seams (and therefore process) showing proudly through\".Allen, C., Albert Ayler: Prophecy/Bells Review, July 14, 2005 ==Track listing== All compositions by Albert Ayler # \"Bells\" - 20:03 ==Personnel== *Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone *Donald Ayler - trumpet *Charles Tyler - alto saxophone *Lewis Worrell - bass *Sonny Murray - drums ==References== Category:1965 live albums Category:Albert Ayler live albums Category:ESP-Disk live albums ",
