    "text": "First edition (publ. Chatto & Windus) Mortal Coils is a collection of five short fictional pieces written by Aldous Huxley in 1921. The title uses a phrase from Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1: : ... To die, to sleep, :To sleep, perchance to dream; aye, there's the rub, :For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, :When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, :Must give us pause ... The stories all concern themselves with some sort of trouble, normally of an amorous nature, and often ending with disappointment. ==The stories== *\"The Gioconda Smile\" is a mixture of social satire and murder story, which Huxley later adapted into a film called A Woman's Vengeance (1948). *\"Permutations Among the Nightingales\" is a play concerning the amorous problems encountered by various patrons of a hotel. *\"The Tillotson Banquet\" tells of an old artist who was thought to be dead, and is \"rediscovered\"; a not entirely successful honorary dinner is organised for him. *\"Green Tunnels\" is about the boredom of a young girl on holiday with her family. She develops a romantic fantasy, and is ultimately disillusioned. *\"Nuns at Luncheon\" is a second-hand story told of a nun falling in love. The story mocks the writer's process, a concept Huxley used in his novel Crome Yellow. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1922 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Aldous Huxley Category:Chatto & Windus books ",
