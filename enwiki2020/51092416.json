Korolyov led the Sputnik project and was Chief engineer for the Soviet Union's rocket and space program from the late 1950s until his death in 1966. He was born in Zhytomyr, then part of the Russian Empire. In 1970, the house in which Korolyov was born was dedicated as a memorial to him, a campus of the Zhytomyr Regional Museum. The museum achieved independent status in 1987, and the present museum building was constructed in 1991. The museum houses around 11,000 exhibits related to rocket and space exploration, including the Soyuz 27 descent module, a small sample of lunar soil, full-size replicas of a complete Soyuz spacecraft, the Vostok 1 descent module, and the Lunokhod 2 lunar rover. From 2013, 2.5 million visitors have passed through the museum's doors. Next to the exposition space, a rocket launches a geodetic version of the missile R-5 (8A62) (the rocket P5 was the first to carry a nuclear charge, and the last one to upgrade the A4 (Fau-2 missile) and the R-12 missile (8K63) (the first one was developed in the Dniepr ) with an engine on high-speed components There are exposition of an animal in space Suspicious in space There are models of devices: == Learning the Moon == === Automatic stations === The Luna-1 model (E-1 No. 4) is the first apparatus that passed the Moon at a distance of 6000 km File:Luna 1 model 1 k 2.jpg A copy of the pennant that delivered the Moon 2 device (E-1 No. 6) to the Moon File:Vympel luna 2.jpg Model Luna-3E-2A No. 1 of the first apparatus, which photographed the reverse side of the Moon File:Luna 3.jpg Luna-9 (\u0415-6 \u211613) the layout of the first apparatus, which makes a soft landing on the Moon.
