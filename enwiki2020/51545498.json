Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Shaw performed in several local bands \u2014 including a stint in The Deverons alongside Burton Cummings before Cummings left to join The Guess Who. He formed the band The Sincere Serenaders in 1977, and was signed to Capitol Records. Shaw later revealed that the Capitol contract was for him as a solo artist, and that when he was preparing to record the band's debut album the label pressured him to fire the band and rely on session musicians, although he refused. The band's self-titled debut album was released on Capitol in 1980, and had top 40 hits in Canada with \"Can I Come Near\" (#15) and \"French Lady\" (#32). The band signed to True North Records for their second album, Good Manners in the 1980s, in 1981. The album was less successful, however, and Shaw concentrated on session and jingle work for several years thereafter. In 1985, Shaw participated in the Northern Lights project as a chorus member on the charity single \"Tears Are Not Enough\".\"Canadian stars record famine relief song; Seasoned pros and young Turks join to make 'Tears Are Not Enough'\".
