The first coach, Chuck Erbe, led the team to four national championships, 1 NCAA (1981) and three AIAW (1976\u201377, 1980). Women's volleyball also has 10 final four appearances (1981, 1982, 1985, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011), finishing as the National runner-up in 1982. More recently, USC sent three female volleyball athletes to the 2008 Olympics \u2013 2004 graduate Nicole Davis represented the indoor United States team, earning a silver medal. 2008 graduate Asia Kaczor represented her native Poland for indoor play, while 2006 alum Bibiana Candelas teamed up with Mayra Garc\u00eda in beach volleyball, representing her native country, Mexico. ==Year by year highlights== ===1981=== 1981 was the first year the NCAA started sponsoring women's volleyball. USC, with a 26\u201310 record, defeated favored UCLA at Pauley Pavilion to win the first NCAA volleyball championship in NCAA history. ===2002\u201304=== USC won the program's second NCAA championship by defeating No. 2 and defending national champion Stanford 3\u20131.

In the national semifinals, the Women of Troy lost to No. 4 seeded Minnesota, the eventual national runners-up. USC is the only school in the history of the AVCA Showcase tournament to win back-to-back AVCA Showcase titles, as the Women of Troy won in 2003 by defeating Hawaii and 2004 by defeating Minnesota. ===2007=== Joanna Kaczor serving the ball in 2007. USC made its first final four since 2004, upsetting fourth-seeded Texas in the regional final. In the national semifinal, the Women of Troy nearly defeated top-seeded and eventual national runner-up Stanford, even having match point, but ended up losing the fifth set in extra points, 16\u201314. During the regular season, USC had beaten the Cardinal once. ===2010=== Starting the season ranked 10th nationally, the Women of Troy compiled a 25\u20134 regular-season record, the 8th 25-win season in coach Haley's 10-year tenure. Notably, in the regular season USC recorded a sweep of crosstown rival UCLA in conference play, including a 3\u20132 margin in the last match before postseason play, avenging losses in both 2009 matches. The Women of Troy dropped just one set through the first three rounds of the NCAA tournament before facing Stanford in the quarterfinal.

From 1989 to 2006, the North Gym and the Lyon Center split time as the team's home court.
