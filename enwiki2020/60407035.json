He voted with the Administration on the excise bill in 1733 and the repeal of the Septennial Act in 1734. At the 1734 British general election he was returned as MP for Liskeard. In 1738 he went into opposition with the Prince of Wales and his post was exchanged for that of Receiver General of the Duchy. He voted against the Spanish convention in 1739, and for the place bill in 1740. He withdrew on the motion to dismiss Walpole in February 1741. At the 1741, he was returned again for Liskeard. He continued to act with the Prince of Wales's party, voting against the Administration on the chairman of the elections committee in December 1741.

Harriot married secondly in 1749 John Hamilton, by whom she had a son, John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn. ==References== Category:1694 births Category:1748 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1727\u20131734 Category:British MPs 1734\u20131741 Category:British MPs 1741\u20131747 Category:British MPs 1747\u20131754 ",
