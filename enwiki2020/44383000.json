    "text": "Black Roses () is a 1935 German historical drama film directed by Paul Martin and starring Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch and Willy Birgel. A separate English-language version Black Roses was also made with Harvey reprising her role opposite Esmond Knight.Bergfeder & Cargnelli p. 52 She also starred in a French version. The film was Harvey's comeback in German cinema, following her attempt to at Hollywood and then British films. One source suggested that Harvey paid for the English version of the film to be made out of her own money, as she still hoped to break into the English-speaking market. The film was popular in Germany, partly because it re-teamed Harvey with Fritsch who was constantly romantically linked with her in the media. In fact Harvey was in a long-term relationship with the film's director Paul Martin. Despite the film's success, Harvey quickly moved away from melodrama to the lighter comedy romances that had originally made her name.Ascheid p. 124 ==Synopsis== When Finland was still part of the Russian Empire, a Finnish Revolutionary battling Czarist agents is assisted by a Russian dancer Tania Feorovna, who eventually gives her life for her lover. ==Partial cast== * Lilian Harvey as Tania Fedorovna * Willy Fritsch as Erkki Collin * Willy Birgel as F\u00fcrst Abarow * Gerhard Bienert as Niklander * Gertrud Wolle as Die Wirtschafterin * Klaus Pohl as Polizeiagent * Heinz Wemper as Kosak Iwanoff * Franz Klebusch as Fischer * Ullrich Klein as Offizier * Kurt von Ruffin as 1.
