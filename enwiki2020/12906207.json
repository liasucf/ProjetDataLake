Congo: Violence Threatens Elections in North Kivu Human Rights Watch The MRC emerged in Ituri District, Democratic Republic of the Congo in September 2006. Rather than a rebel group in its own right, it was chiefly a coalition of different independent rebel groups including the Patriotic Resistance Front of Ituri (FRPI), Party for Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of Congo (PUSIC), Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC), Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI), Armed Forces of the Congolese People (FAPC), and the Rally for Congolese Democracy-KML (RCD-KML). It was led by Bwambale Kabolele and Bosco Ntaganda and received foreign support, probably from Uganda and Rwanda which were competing for influence in the eastern Congo at the time. The MRC, along with the FNI and FRPI, agreed to a disarmament deal on 22 August 2007.DR Congo: Ex- militia Members Agree To Disarm Scoop ==See also== *Popular Front for Justice in Congo (FPJC) - another Ituri rebel coalition, between 2008-10. ==Citations== ;References ===Bibliography=== * Category:Rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:2006 establishments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Military units and factions of the Ituri conflict Category:Military units and formations established in 2006 ",
