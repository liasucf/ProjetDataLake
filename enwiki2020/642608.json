    "text": "The model of the body in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the following elements: * the Fundamental Substances; * Qi, Blood, Jing (Essence), Shen (Mind) that nourish and protect the Zang-Fu organs; * and the meridians (jing- luo) which connect and unify the body. Every diagnosis is a \"Pattern of disharmony\" that affects one or more organs, such as \"Spleen Qi Deficiency\" or \"Liver Fire Blazing\" or \"Invasion of the Stomach by Cold\", and every treatment is centered on correcting the disharmony. The traditional Chinese model is concerned with function. Thus, the TCM Spleen is not a specific piece of flesh, but an aspect of function related to transformation and transportation within the body, and of the mental functions of thinking and studying. Indeed, the San Jiao or Triple Burner has no anatomical correspondent at all, and is said to be completely a functional entity. Chinese medicine and the model of the body is founded on the balance of the five elements: Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire. The elements are infinitely linked, consuming and influencing each other. Each element corresponds to different organs in the body. The organs act as representatives of the qualities of different elements, which impact the physical and mental body in respective ways. Each organ is categorized as either Yin or Yang. The energies of Yin and Yang are conflicting yet inter-reliant. When the two (Yin+Yang) forces are united they create a divine energy, which supports the flow of all life. Yin organs represent: femininity, coldness, compression, darkness, and submission. Yang organs represent: masculinity, expansion, heat, motion, and action. This duality (yin+yang) must be in balance or else disease of the mind and body will occur. Each organ governs energy channels, which distribute qi and connect all parts of the body to one another. These channels are called meridians.Dale, Cyndi, and Richard Wehrman. The Subtle Body: an Encyclopedia of Your Energetic Anatomy. Boulder, CO: Sounds True, 2009. Print == Wood == Wood is an element of growth, originality, creativity, and evolution. The Liver (1) and the Gallbladder (2) are the two wood-governed organs in the body. (1) The Liver, a Yin organ, influences emotional flexibility and the flow of energy on a cellular level. The organ has a strong impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the immune system along with storing the body's blood, a physical manifestation of one's true self. The Liver rules one's direction, vision, sense of self-purpose and opens into the eyes. Lastly, the Liver absorbs what is not digested and regulates blood sugar. Imbalance in the Liver can lead to great problems. Moodiness, anger, pain, poor self-esteem, lack of direction, addiction, and indecision are all associated with the Liver organ. Muscle spasms, numbness, tremors, eye diseases, hypertension, allergies, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis are also a result of Liver imbalances. The Liver Meridian begins on the big toe, runs along the inner leg through the genitals and ends on the chest. (2) The Gallbladder, a wood controlled Yang organ, governs decisiveness. The Gallbladder also stores bile. Imbalance of the Gallbladder can lead to indecisiveness along with obesity. The Gallbladder meridian begins at the outer edge of the eye, moves to the side of the head and trunk, and ends on the outside of the fourth toe.Reichstein, Gail.
