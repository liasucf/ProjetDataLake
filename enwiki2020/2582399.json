In July 2018, the company's board of directors announced that being a public company was no longer considered a strategic priority and that it would seek to repurchase its GDRs shares from the market and delist, initially from the London Stock Exchange. GDRs were delisted in London in October 2018. The GDR repurchase consolidated more than 75% of ownership in the company, which triggered a mandatory offer to minority shareholders in December 2018. Shares were delisted from the Moscow Exchange in June 2019. Formally shares in the company are now split between USM Telecom (43.68%) and a wholly owned USM subsidiary, AF Telecom Holding (56.32%). ==Outside Russia== ===Georgia=== The Georgian National Communications Commission (GNCC) has accused MegaFon of illegal business operations and participation in the military and economic annexation of Georgia. According to the GNCC, MegaFon has provided unlicensed mobile phone coverage in the conflict zones of Georgia beginning in 2005, in particular the South Ossetia region. The company covered mostly the areas of dislocation of the Russian military forces present in Georgia under the CIS peacekeeping mandate. The rest of the area was mostly covered by the Georgian mobile phone carriers \"Geocell\" Ltd. and \"Magticom\". In the spring of 2008, GNCC received complaints from Georgian mobile communication companies regarding the destruction of their communication facilities in the region and installation of MegaFon antennas. The GNCC conducted survey monitoring trips to establish the presence of MegaFon's unlicensed coverage. The GNCC imposed two fines on MegaFon: the first in the amount of 5,000 GEL ($3,750) in July 2008, and the second, for the recurrence of violation, in the amount of 500,000 GEL (approx. $350,000) in September 2008. Because Georgian law envisages criminal liability for illegal business activities, the GNCC has notified the General Prosecutor of Georgia on the alleged violations committed by MegaFon. The Prosecutor General of Georgia was expected to initiate criminal proceedings against key officials of MegaFon. On October 2, 2008, Tbilisi City Court upheld the GNCC's decision, finding MegaFon liable for providing unlicensed telecommunication services in Georgia. MegaFon's appeal of the second administrative fine was to be heard by Tbilisi City Court in November 2008. ===Tajikistan=== MegaFon's only subsidiary outside Russia is Tajikistan's TT Mobile. ===Uzbekistan=== Kommersant reported on September 7, 2006, that MegaFon is negotiating in buying an 85% stake in Uzbek mobile operator Coscom from the MCT Corpation. The other 15% stake in Coscom would be held by Coscom management and private shareholders. Analysts estimated Coscom is worth between US$180\u2013200 million. Coscom's has over 300,000 customers. ===Iran=== BBC Persian reported on May 13, 2008 that Megafon had opened an office in Tehran. ==Sponsorship== * KHL hockey league * For the 2009 Formula One season, MegaFon was one of the sponsors for the Renault F1 Team. * Megafon was a national partner for 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 * Russian e-sports team Virtus Pro * English Premier League team Everton == Criticism == By November 2012 MegaFon received a number of orders from Russian telecommunication and consumer market authorities to amend contracts with its 63 million subscribers and to make these contracts compliant with requirements of Russian law.
