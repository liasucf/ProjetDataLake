She represented Israel at the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. == Personal life == She was born in Acre, Israel, and is Jewish. Alfatov's father is a graphic designer, and her mother is a teacher. Both her parents were born in Ukraine and made aliyah to escape antisemitism in the Soviet Union. She graduated magna cum laude from high school. In her spare time, she volunteers for AKIM, an organization that works to help people suffering from intellectual disabilities. == Fencing == Alfatov began fencing in fourth grade, and is Israel's national youth fencing champion.

My dream is to get to the Olympics and win.\" She hopes that modelling will help her to support her fencing career financially, as Israel will only pay for the first year of training to qualify for the 2020 Olympics. == Israeli Air Force == Alfatov as of December 2015 served in the Israeli Air Force. == Pageantry == On June 2, 2015, Alfatov was crowned Miss Israel in 2015, which resulted in her competing in Miss Universe 2015.
