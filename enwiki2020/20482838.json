    "text": "The Left Party (', ') is a French democratic socialist political party founded on 1 February 2009. Launched by parliamentarians Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and Marc Dolez on 12 November 2008, after their departure from the Socialist Party (PS) following the Congress of Reims, the PG brings together personalities and groups from different political traditions, and claims a socialist, ecologist and republican orientation. Politically located between the Socialist Party and the French Communist Party, the Left Party intends to federate all the sensitivities of the anti-liberal left \u2060\u2014 which he also calls \"the other left\" \u2060\u2014 within the same alliance. In 2008, the PG joined forces with the Communist Party of the United Left and six other left-wing and far-left organizations in the coalition of the Left Front, of which Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon is the candidate for the presidential election. The PG was co-chaired from the Le Mans Congress in November 2010, by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and Martine Billard. In April 2016, the Left Party had 8,000 members. At the end of August 2014, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and Martine Billard resigned, and the party leadership was then collectively ensured by the national secretariat. His weekly newspaper, L'Heure du peuple (formerly Left) is sent to all members but also to simple subscribers. It is printed at more than 15,000 copies a week. In 2016, in view of the presidential and legislative elections of the following year, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon formed a new movement, La France Insoumise, that the Left Party helped to animate. ==History== People march waving flags during a demonstration against expulsions of foreign students on 5 November 2013 in Toulouse.
