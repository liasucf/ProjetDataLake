The passport allows for freedom of movement in any of the states of the European Economic Area and Switzerland. ==History== A new design was put into circulation in May 1987.\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0viljinn, 13 June 1987 It featured a dark blue (near-black) cover, laser-printed pages, and a laminated information page. The first machine-readable Icelandic passports were introduced on 1 June 1999,Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 8 April 1999 having a blue cover, a machine-readable strip and improved security features. A hard-plastic page with a biometric chip was added in May 2006,\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0skr\u00e1 \u00cdslands - Algengar spurningar (Archived) and the validity was temporarily shortened from ten years to five. In June 2013, the chip was relocated to the back cover and the validity restored to ten years. A new Icelandic passport design was introduced on 1 February 2019, featuring a slightly enlarged Icelandic coat of arms and sans-serif wording on the front cover. ==Physical Appearance== Icelandic passports are blue, with the Icelandic coat of arms emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The words \"\u00cdSLAND\" (Icelandic), \"ICELAND\" (English) and \"ISLANDE\" (French) are inscribed above the coat of arms and the words \"VEGABR\u00c9F\" (Icelandic), \"PASSPORT\" (English) and \"PASSEPORT\" (French) are inscribed below the coat of arms. Icelandic passports have the standard biometric symbol at the bottom. Vegabr\u00e9f literally means \"road letter\", a word historically used in Scandinavia meaning internal passport. ===Identity Information Page=== machine readable version The Icelandic passport includes the following data: * Photo of Passport Holder * Type (PA) * Code (ISL) * Passport No. * Surname * Given Names * Nationality * Height * Date of Birth * Personal code number * Sex * Place of Birth * Date of Issue * Date of Expiry * Authority The information page ends with the Machine Readable Zone. ===Different spellings of the same name=== Personal names containing the special Icelandic letters (\u00f0, \u00fe, \u00e6, \u00f6) are spelled the correct way in the non- machine-readable zone, but are mapped in the machine-readable zone. \u00f0 becomes D, \u00fe becomes TH, \u00e6 becomes AE, and \u00f6 becomes OE. Letters with accents are replaced by simple letters (e.g., \u00e9 \u2192 E). This follows the standard for machine-readable passports. ===Languages=== The data page/information page is printed in Icelandic, English and French. ==Visa free travel== Visa requirements for Icelandic citizens Visa requirements for Icelandic citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Iceland. As of 3 April 2020, Icelandic citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 180 countries and territories, ranking the Icelandic passport 11th in the world in terms of travel freedom (tied with Latvian and Slovenian passports) according to the Henley Passport Index. Moreover, by virtue of Iceland's membership of the European Economic Area, they can travel to 28 European Union member states, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland to live and work as long as they wish. ==Other identity documents== Inside Iceland and the other Nordic countries, an Icelandic identity card or driving licence is usually sufficient for personal identification. They do not state citizenship and therefore are not usable in most cases as travel documentation outside of the Nordic countries. The Icelandic identity card is called \"Nafnsk\u00edrteini\" (\"name certificate\"). Most people do not have it and use driving licences instead. ==See also== *Visa requirements for Icelandic citizens *Passports of the European Union ==External links== * EU legislation: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement == References == Iceland Category:European Economic Area Category:European Free Trade Association Category:Identity documents ",
