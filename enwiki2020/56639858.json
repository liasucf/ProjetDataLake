At that time he devised the concept for \"Melancholy\", with 365 artists collaborating on a single day. The slogan of the song was \"Raise Voice, Save Earth\". The event was conducted to break the Guinness World Records of \"Most Vocal Solos in a Song Recording\" and use this to promote awareness of environmental conservation issues.
