    "text": "Dayavan () is a 1988 Indian Hindi-language crime drama film directed by Feroz Khan. It is a remake of the 1987 Tamil film Nayakan. The film stars Vinod Khanna, Feroz Khan and Madhuri Dixit with Aditya Pancholi in an important role. The film was a box office super hit and received critical acclaim. The film was most talked about for its passionate lovemaking scene between Vinod Khanna and Madhuri Dixit but there was more to the film than the kiss. Khanna played the titular role and avenges the death of his father. The film is remembered for his powerful performance, which is considered to be one of his best. ==Plot== After having witnessed his dad being killed by the local police, and being orphaned and homeless, Shakti Velu develops a hatred and distrust of the police in India. He is befriended by another homeless boy named Shanker, who asks him to accompany him to Bombay's slums, where they live with a kind-hearted Muslim named Karim Baba, and his daughter, Shama. This is where Shakti and Shankar spend their childhood. When they mature, they take to petty crime. Here too, Shakti witnesses police brutality and atrocities, especially at the hands of sadistic, alcoholic, and womanizing Police Inspector Ratan Singh. When Karim Baba is arrested, jailed, and found hanging by his neck in police custody, Shakti hunts down Ratan Singh, and kills him in broad daylight in front of several hundred people. An investigation is launched, but no one comes forward as a witness. Thus Shakti gets his reputation as a Don with a good heart i.e., Dayavan. Shakti marries local prostitute, Neelu, and has two children, Suraj and Sarita. He becomes even more powerful and influential all over Bombay, and his working partners are powerful criminal dons who have ruled over Bombay for eons. Shakti eventually replaces these dons, and becomes Bombay's only Don. This creates enemies for him and his family, but he believes since he has not really done any harm to anyone, he and his family will be safe. It is this belief that will take a heavy toll on his life and that of his family, when the truth dawns that he, himself, is responsible for being kind to a man, who will ultimately bring forward ruin to the Velu family. ==Cast== * Vinod Khanna as Shakti Velu aka Dayavan * Feroz Khan as Shanker Waghmare * Madhuri Dixit as Neelu, wife of Shakti * Aditya Pancholi as Dayavan's son-in-Law * Amrish Puri as Inspector Ratan Singh * Aanjjan Srivastav as Superintendent of Police * Amala as Sarita * Anuradha Patel as Shama * Aruna Irani as Tara * Tinnu Anand as Ratan Singh's son * Alok Nath as Karim Baba * Naresh Suri as Tora Swami * Mangal Dhillon * Mahaverr Shah * Ramya Krishnan in an item number ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack is available on T-Series, and is composed by veteran music directors Laxmikant\u2013Pyarelal.
