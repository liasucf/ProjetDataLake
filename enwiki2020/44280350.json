    "text": "Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani was an officer of Army of the Republic of Upper Volta executed on September 19, 1989 along with Henri Zongo by Blaise Compaor\u00e9 who accused them of plotting a coup. Lingani was set by Laurent S\u00e9dego, Gilbert Diend\u00e9r\u00e9, Hermann Yam\u00e9ogo, Issa Tiendr\u00e9beogo and his cousin Alain Ouilma of national safety department. ==Biography== Lingani was educated at the Prytan\u00e9e militaire de Saint-Louis, a military academy in Saint-Louis, the capital of Senegal. He later became a teacher at the Prytan\u00e9e militaire de Kadiogo outside of the Voltaic capital of Ouagadougou. In 1976, when the country was led by Major General Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana, he participated in forming a secret left-wing organization within the lower officers of the Voltaic military, the \"Communist Officers' Group\" (, ROC). Other well-known members of the ROC included Henri Zongo, Blaise Compaor\u00e9, and Thomas Sankara. In 1980, Lamizana \u2013 who himself had previously participated in overthrowing his predecessor \u2013 was deposed by Colonel Saye Zerbo in a military coup. A subsequent coup in 1982 against Zerbo put Major Dr. Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo in power instead, and Lingani's comrade Thomas Sankara was made Prime Minister. This influence on the Ou\u00e9draogo regime from left-wing officers troubled the former colonial power France, and after a visit by Jean-Christophe Mitterrand Sankara, Henri Zongo and Lingani were all placed under arrest. A popular uprising was triggered in response, and Blaise Compaor\u00e9 led yet another coup, which made Sankara President. Lingani and the other members of the Communist Officers' Group joined the Council of Popular Salvation, the new military junta. Sankara set about attempting to enact what he called the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" (), a radical transformation of society. To achieve this, new entities such as the Pioneers of the Revolution, the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution and the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals were introduced. Jean-Baptiste Lingani served as Minister for Popular Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in Sankara's cabinet. During his time as such, Burkina Faso \u2013 renamed from Upper Volta \u2013 fought Mali in the brief Second Agacher Strip War, which lasted a few weeks in December 1985. On 15 October 1987, Thomas Sankara was assassinated by a group of soldiers, in a military coup orchestrated by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, Gilbert Diend\u00e9r\u00e9. Lingani and Henri Zongo were not aware of the preparedness of the coup against Sankara - Merneptah Noufou Zougmor\u00e9 and Val\u00e8re Dieudonn\u00e9 Som\u00e9 \\- A deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given, with Compaor\u00e9 stating that Sankara jeopardised foreign relations with France and the neighbouring Ivory Coast. Compaor\u00e9 succeeded Sankara as President. Lingani remained Minister for Popular Defense and Commander-in-Chief under Compaor\u00e9, and served as acting chairman of the Popular Front during Compaor\u00e9's foreign visits. On 18 September 1989, however, during a visit by the president to China, this would change. Henri Zongo and Jean-Baptiste Lingani \u2013 along with two other officials \u2013 were arrested, charged with plotting to launch yet another military coup. Zongo and Lingani, denounced as \"Fascists\" by state radio, were both quickly executed. Blaise Compaor\u00e9 would go on to rule Burkina Faso for two and a half decades, until his overthrow during the 2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising. ==References== Category:1989 deaths Category:Burkinab\u00e9 communists Category:Burkinab\u00e9 military personnel Category:Government ministers of Burkina Faso Category:Year of birth missing Category:Executed Burkinab\u00e9 people Category:People executed by Burkina Faso ",
