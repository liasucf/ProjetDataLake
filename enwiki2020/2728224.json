Scattered throughout are Franglais phrases and schoolboy misunderstandings of the French language. The play was inspired by a 1933 visit to a village called Marxzell in the Black Forest, where young English gentlemen went to cram German. ==Reception== The play was a success on its London debut, establishing Rattigan as a dramatist. Critics thought it \"gay, witty, thoroughly contemporary... with a touch of lovable truth behind all its satire.\" It ran for over 1,000 performances in London, and over 100 in New York. It also established Rex Harrison as a major star. ==Original production== The play, directed by Harold French, opened on 6 November 1936 at the Criterion Theatre, London, with the following cast: *Alan Howard - Rex Harrison *Brian Curtis - Guy Middleton *Commander Bill Rogers - Roland Culver *Diana Lake - Kay Hammond *Jacqueline Maingot - Jessica Tandy *Kenneth Lake - Trevor Howard *Kit Neilan - Robert Flemyng *Lord Heybrook - William Dear *Marianne/t/o Jacqueline Maingot - Yvonne Andre *Monsieur Maingot - Percy Walsh ==Adaptations== A film version, directed by Anthony Asquith and starring Ray Milland, was released in 1940.
