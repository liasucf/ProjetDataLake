The paper proved a financial and critical disaster from its first issue on such a scale that it forced its sister paper, the recently launched Sunday Tribune, which had been building its sales, into liquidation.Hugh Oram, The Advertising Book: The History of Advertising in Ireland. MO Books, (p. 422). Among the complaints levelled against the Daily News were its substandard design, poor printing, poor quality and a concept that had little to offer. However, the paper's extremely poor distribution was the single greatest cause of its demise. Quite frequently, the morning edition was not delivered to newsagents in the capital, Dublin, until 8.00am or after \u2014 when its target demographic was already in work. This was crucial \u2014 if the 'News' could have breached a critical circulation figure, its undercapitalisation could have been remedied, but advertising revenue failed to roll in and McLaughlin was forced to shut it down. One big mistake proved to be a decision to put a photograph of the topless wife of businessman John DeLorean on the front page. Used without her permission, the publication of the image enraged feminists, infuriated DeLorean, offended many readers and was of such poor quality that even those who wished to see the picture could not see it clearly. Within days of the d\u00e9b\u00e2cle the paper folded. Its sister paper, the Sunday Tribune, was saved from bankruptcy by journalist Vincent Browne, who bought the title. A decade later, another newly launched sister newspaper of the Tribune, the Dublin Tribune, again forced the financially successful Tribune to the brink of closure and again forced a change in ownership. No-one however bought the rights to the Daily News following its closure in 1982. ==Notes== Category:1982 establishments in Ireland Category:1982 disestablishments in Ireland Category:Defunct newspapers published in Ireland Category:Publications established in 1982 Category:Publications disestablished in 1982 ",
