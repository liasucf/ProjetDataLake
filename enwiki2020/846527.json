    "text": "The is an agency of the government of Japan in charge of state matters concerning the Imperial Family, and also keeping of the Privy Seal and State Seal of Japan. From around the 8th century AD up to the Second World War, it was named the . The agency is unique among conventional government agencies and ministries, in that it does not directly report to the Prime Minister at the cabinet level, nor is it affected by legislation that establishes it as an Independent Administrative Institution. ==Organization and functions== The Agency is headed by the Grand Steward and he is assisted by the Vice-Grand Steward.Imperial Household Agency: Organization The main elements of the organization are: * the Grand Steward's Secretariat * the Board of Chamberlains * the Crown Prince's Household * the Board of Ceremonies * the Archives and Mausolea Department * the Maintenance and Works Department * the Kyoto Office The current Grand Steward is Shin'ichir\u014d Yamamoto. The Agency's headquarters is located within the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The Agency's duties and responsibilities encompass the daily activities, such as state visits, organising events, preservation of traditional culture, administrative functions, etc., the agency is also responsible for the various imperial residences scattered throughout the country. Visitors who wish to tour the Tokyo Imperial Palace, the Kyoto Imperial Palace, the Katsura Detached Palace, and other sites, should register for guided tours with the agency first. The Agency has responsibility for the health, security and travel arrangements of the Imperial family, including maintaining the Imperial line. The Board of the Chamberlains, headed by the Grand Chamberlain, manages the daily life of the Emperor and the Empress. It also keeps the Privy Seal and State Seal of Japan. A \"Grand Master of the Board of the Crown Prince's Household\" helps manage the schedules, dining menus, and household maintenance of the Crown Prince and his family. ==History== Imperial Household Agency building is located near the Sakashita gate of the palace The Imperial Household Agency can trace its origins back to the institutions established by the Taih\u014d Code (or more formally ) promulgated in 701\u2013702 AD. \u6cbf\u9769 (Enkaku) The Ritsury\u014d system established the namesake which is a precursor to the present agency. The old code also gave rise to the which has its legacy in the under the current agency, and the which oversaw the that would now correspond to the Agency's . The basic structures remained in place until the Meiji Restoration (1868). ===Meiji period=== The early Meiji government officially installed on 15 August 1869.The name is exactly the same as the ministry since ancient times, though it is tempting to artificially render them differently in English (\"Imperial Household Agency\" vs. \"Ministry of the Imperial Household\"). The Japanese were using the lunar date of \"July 8, Meiji 2.\" However, there is a convoluted history of reorganization around how the government bodies that correspond to constituent subdivisions of the current Agency were formed or empowered during this period. The and later the (1871\u20131872) were briefly in existence and placed in charge of, e.g., the under the , one of the tasks designated to the Agency today. Meanwhile, the Meiji government created the in 1871, which was soon renamed in 1872. And by 1872 the Ministry of Shinto Affairs was abolished, with the bulk of duties moved to the and the administration of formal ceremonial functions transferred to the aforementioned Board/Bureau of the Ceremonies., \"Within a year, the Department of Religion and Education (kyobu sho) superseded the Shinto Ministry.\", \"The actual directive which abolished the Shinto Ministry on April 21, 1872, read in part as follows: 'Let the purely formal functions be transferred to the Board of Ceremonies, while the Department of Religion and Education take over the duties ...'\" keeps calling it \"Board of Ceremonies\" instead of \"Bureau\" even after the name change. The Bureau of the Ceremonies was initially under the sway of the but was transferred to the control of the Imperial Household Ministry in September 1877. The Bureau underwent yet another name change to in October 1884. Since then, the name remained unchanged and is, today, headed by the Master of Ceremonies. An Imperial Order in 1908 confirmed that the Imperial Household Minister, as the chief official was then called, was responsible for assisting the Emperor in all matters concerning the Imperial House. The ministry also oversaw the official appointments of Imperial Household Artists and commissioned their work. ===Imperial Household Office, 1947\u20131949=== The was a downgraded version of the ministry, created pursuant to Law No. 70 of 1947 during the American Occupation of Japan. Its staff size was downscaled from 6,200 to less than 1,500, and the Office was placed under the Prime Minister of Japan. (Text of Imperial Household Act) Article 13 stipulates authority under premier.In 1947, ahead of the new constitution the Imperial Household Act was promulgated, along with the (Law No. 4 of 1947) and the Imperial Household Office Law (Law. No. 70 of 1947) Reprint 2002 ===Imperial Household Agency, 1949\u2013present=== In 1949, Imperial Household Office became the Imperial Household Agency (the current name), and placed under the fold of the newly created , as an external agency attached to it. In 2001, the Imperial Household Agency was organizationally re-positioned under the . ==Criticism== The Agency has been criticized for isolating members of the Imperial Family from the Japanese public, and for insisting on hidebound customs rather than permitting a more approachable, populist monarchy. Prince Naruhito, in May 2004, criticised the then-Grand Steward of the Imperial Household, Toshio Yuasa, for putting pressure on Princess Masako, Naruhito's wife, to bear a male child. At a press conference, Naruhito said that his wife had \"completely exhausted herself\" trying to adapt to the imperial family's life, and added \"there were developments that denied Masako's career (up to our marriage) as well as her personality.\"The Future of Japan's Monarchy, Time Asia MagazineImperial family exposed to media speculation in 2004, Japan Policy and Politics, 10 Jan 2005Crown prince back in Japan, will not meet press, Japan Policy and Politics, 24 May 2004 It has officially been stated that Masako is suffering from an \"adjustment disorder\", but there has been extensive speculation in the press that she is suffering from clinical depression as a result of her treatment by Imperial Household officials.About a boy: Dynasty, Japan-style , The Independent on Sunday, 8 July 2007 Increasingly in recent years, the Agency's prevention of archaeological research regarding a large number (more than 740) of Kofun Period tombs putatively designated as \"imperial\" has come under criticism from academics. Such research, particularly on the ancient tombs in the Kansai region of western Japan, has the potential to yield a great bounty of information on the origins of Japanese civilization. The possibility that such finds could verify theories of formative civilizational ties with contemporary civilizations in China and the Korean Peninsula, with commensurate influence on thought about the origins of the Imperial Household itself, is generally considered to be the greater part of the jealousy with which the agency guards its authority over this large number of tombs (many of which are likely imperial only in name), and prevents scientific inquiry into these sites.Hudson, M.

The Grand Steward is vested with comprehensive control over administrate activities within the agency, and supervisory authority over the service performance of the staff (8\u20133). He is empowered to interact with the Prime Minister on matters pertaining to the agency's authorized duties, either requesting the issuance of Cabinet Office ordinances (8\u20133), or notifying him on pertinent matters (8\u20134). He has the authorization to hand down orders or directives to staff members of government organs under the agency's direct control (8\u20136), and may also request the Commissioner General of the National Police Agency to take appropriate measures regarding administrative duties that involve the civilian . The Grand Stewardship is a post customarily filled by former (\u2252permanent secretaries) at one of several internal affairs (home affairs) type ministries and agencies, or someone with a closely approximating (e.g., Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department), after having served as Vice-Grand Steward. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Grand Stewards past and present !Number!!Name!!term of office!!ex-service!!Remarks |- |colspan=\"4\"|Grand Stewards of the Imperial Household Office|| |- |align=\"right\"|1|||| 3 May 1947 \u2013 5 Jun 1948||Imperial Household Ministry|| |- |align=\"right\"|2||||5 Jun 1948 \u2013 31 May 1949||Civilian|| cont. |- |colspan=\"4\"|Grand Stewards of the Imperial Household Agency|| |- |align=\"right\"|1||Michiji Tajima|| 1 Jun 1949 \u2013 16 Dec 1953||Civilian|| |- |align=\"right\"|2||||16 Dec 1953 \u2013 26 May 1978||Home Ministry|| |- |align=\"right\"|3||||26 May 1978 \u2013 14 Jun 1988||National Police Agency|| |- |align=\"right\"|4||||14 Jun 1988 \u2013 19 Jan 1996||Ministry of Welfare, Environment Agency|| |- |align=\"right\"|5||||19 Jan 1996 \u2013 2 Apr 2001||National Police Agency|| |- |align=\"right\"|6||||2 Apr 2001 \u2013 1 Apr 2005||Ministry of Home Affairs|| |- |align=\"right\"|7||Shingo Haketa||1 Apr 2005 \u2013 1 Jun 2012||Ministry of Health|| |- |align=\"right\"|8||||1 Jun 2012 \u2013 26 Sep 2016||Ministry of Construction|| |- |align=\"right\"|9||||26 Sep 2016 \u2013 ||Ministry of Home Affairs|| |} ==See also== * Imperial Household Law * Chamberlain of Japan * Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan * Imperial Household Department, China * Matsushiro Underground Imperial Headquarters ==Explanatory notes== ==Citations== ==References== * Shigeru, Yoshida and Hiroshi Nara.
