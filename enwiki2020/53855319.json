    "text": "Fan Chen-tsung (; born 20 November 1942) is a Taiwanese politician. Fan graduated from National Taiwan Ocean University. From 1978 to 1986, he was a member of the Hsinchu County Council. Later that year, Fan was elected to the National Assembly and served until 1990. He ran for the magistracy of Hsinchu County as an independent in 1989, and joined the Democratic Progressive Party shortly after winning the office. In 1993, Fan won a second term. He was succeeded as magistrate by Lin Kuang-hua. Fan was subsequently appointed to Lin's vacant seat on the Legislative Yuan, taking office on 26 January 1998. Fan was elected speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council, and left that position to assume leadership of the Council of Agriculture in 2002. He resigned on 24 November, as farmers and fishermen's collectives protested attempts to reform credit unions related to those industries. Premier Yu Shyi- kun accepted Fan's resignation two days later, and Fan officially left office on 2 December. In July 2009, Fan and Hsu Jung-shu were invited to the Cross- Strait Economic, Trade and Culture Forum. Though the Democratic Progressive Party advised both not to go, both made the trip, resulting in the suspension of Fan and Hsu's party membership. Before he could be formally expelled, Fan withdrew from the DPP. In 2010, Fan again visited China with a group of Pan- Blue politicians. Later that year, Fan resigned his post as adviser to President Ma Ying-jeou after the Hsinchu District Court convicted Fan on corruption charges dating back to Fan's tenure as Hsinchu County Magistrate. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:National Taiwan Ocean University alumni Category:Democratic Progressive Party Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 3rd Legislative Yuan Category:Hsinchu County Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Magistrates of Hsinchu County Category:Taiwanese politicians convicted of corruption Category:Senior Advisors to President Ma Ying-jeou Category:Expelled members of the Democratic Progressive Party (Taiwan) Category:Taiwanese Ministers of Agriculture ",
