At the age of 12, she was considered a \u201cliving wife\u201d of Lord Jagannath, the god who is worshiped at the Jagannath temple, and she was not expected to marry anyone in her entire lifespan. According to temple records, she was one of about 25 women assigned to care for Jagannath and was the last among them who was alive. ==Early life== At the age of 12, Sashimani was inducted into Devadasi Seva after being ceremonially married to Lord Jagannath at the age of 7 or 8. As a part of her duties, she used to dance before the Lord during Badasinghara Besha and festivals related to the Jagannath temple including Chandan Jatra. As Sashimani grew old, her services were confined to reciting Gitagovinda in the traditional Odissi music manner. ==Devadasi Culture in Odisha== The Orissa Gazette of 1956 mentions some occasions where the devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would dance at the Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, after breakfast, would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar).This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badasinghara, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. ==Death== At the age of 92 she left her last breath at Dolamandapa sahi, Puri and was cremated at Swargadwar in Puri, where her foster son Somanath Panda light the funeral pyre brought from the kitchen of Jagannath temple.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/world/asia/sashimani-devi-last-of- indias-jagannath-temple-ritual-dancers-dies-at-92.html?_r=0 ==References== ==External links== *http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11535593/Sashimani-Devi-temple- dancer-obituary.html Category:Articles created or expanded during Women's History Month (India) - 2015 Category:People from Odisha Category:Jagannath Category:2015 deaths ",
