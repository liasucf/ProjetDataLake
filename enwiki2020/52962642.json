He studied mathematics and physics at the universities of Berlin and Bonn, receiving his doctorate in 1884 with the dissertation Bildung von Ozon, Wasserstoffsuperoxyd und Ueberschwefels\u00e4ure bei der Electrolyse verd\u00fcnnter Schwefels\u00e4ure (\"The formation of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid during the electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acid\"). In 1888 he obtained his habilitation and worked as a lecturer of physics at the University of Bonn. In 1895 he succeeded Anton Oberbeck as professor of physics at the University of Greifswald, where he also served as director of the Physics Institute. In 1901 he relocated as a professor to the University of Marburg. In 1907 he became a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina.Plett - Schmidseder / edited by Walther Killy Dictionary of German BiographyThe Mie Theory: Basics and Applications edited by Wolfram Hergert, Thomas Wriedt With Otto Krigar-Menzel, he conducted a series of experiments for determination of the gravitational constant and the Earth's mean density.Nature, Volume 55 edited by Sir Norman Lockyer == Selected works == * Bestimmung der Gravitationsconstante und der mittleren Dichtigkeit der Erde durch W\u00e4gungen, 1898 - Determination of the gravitational constant and the mean density of the earth. * Neuere fortschritte auf dem gebiete der elektrizit\u00e4t, 1899; Recent advances in the field of electricity. * Ueber Temperatur\u00e4nderungen in K\u00fcnstlich auf- und Abbewegter Luft, 1902. * Vorlesungen \u00fcber Theorie der W\u00e4rme (as editor; 1903) - Hermann Helmholtz' lectures on the theory of heat. * Zur Erinnerung an Paul Drude zwei Ansprachen (with Walter K\u00f6nig, 1906); In memory of Paul Drude; two speeches. * Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Maxwellschen Theorie verkn\u00fcpft mit der Elektronentheorie, 1909 - The rudiments of Maxwell's theory combined with the electron theory.Most widely held works by Franz Richarz WorldCat Identities == References == Category:1860 births Category:1920 deaths Category:People from Bonn Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:University of Bonn alumni Category:University of Greifswald faculty Category:University of Marburg faculty Category:German physicists ",
