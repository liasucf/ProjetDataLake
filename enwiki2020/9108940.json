This route was designated on March 21, 1938. On August 30, 1957, SH 261 was extended west 1 mile over part of RM 2241, which was rerouted north over RM 2337 so that there was one continuous RM road, rather than two, between Llano and Tow. ==Junction list== ==References== 261 Category:Transportation in Llano County, Texas ",
