    "text": "Joan Livingstone (born 1948) is an American contemporary artist, educator, curator, and author based in Chicago. She creates sculptural objects, installations, prints, and collages that reference the human body and bodily experience. == Education == Livingstone earned a bachelor of arts degree from Portland State University in 1972, followed by a master of fine arts degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art. She was a stage and graphic designer at the Portland Shakespeare Company from 1969 to 1972. == Career == === Artist === Livingstone's work often abstractly reflects the human body, especially as is related to the history of women artists. In her early work, she often used suture-stitch to create visceral forms out of industrial felt that she then hardened with epoxy resins. Her more recent work incorporates found objects, metallic leaf, and hand-made paper. Her later fiber arts work was larger in scale and took on more conceptual meaning. Livingstone has held solo exhibitions at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center, Alfred University. Her work is held in the permanent collections of: * The Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois * Boise Museum of Art, Idaho * Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu, Hawaii * Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan * Dennos Museum Center, Traverse City, Michigan * Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan * Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York * Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Illinois * Northern Illinois University Art Museum, DeKalb, Illinois * Racine Art Museum, Racine, Wisconsin * Portland Art Museum, Portland, Oregon * Robert L. Pfannebecker Collection, Lancaster, Pennsylvania Livingstone has received a number of awards for her work, including: * Chairman's Award, School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2014) * American Craft Council Fellowship (2001) * Illinois Arts Council Artist Fellowship (2000, 1989, 1986) * Virginia A. Groot Foundation, Illinois, Individual Artist Grant (1998) * Faculty Enrichment Grant, School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1984, 1988,1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997) * National Endowment for the Arts, Individual Artist Fellowship (1979, 1986, 1993) * The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Artist's Fellowship (catalog) (1990) * The George A. and Eliza Gardner Howard Foundation Artist's Fellowship, Brown University, RI (1989) === Educator === Livingstone has worked as an educator at several institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute, Cranbrook Academy of Art, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Beginning in 1983, she held several positions at SAIC, including Dean of Undergraduate studies and professor emerita in the Department of Fiber and Material Studies. === Writer === In 2007, Livingstone, with John Ploof, co-edited an anthology, The Object of Labor: Art, Cloth, and Cultural Production. The book includes essays and artist pages examining the effect of globalization on practices and depictions of labor in the arts through the lens of textile production. == Select Exhibitions == 2015 * \"Oddments,\" John Michael Kohler Arts Center, Sheboygan, WI * \"marvels and oddment(s),\" Clough-Hanson Gallery, Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee 2006-7 * \u201cJoan Livingstone: Membranes, Margins, Disruptions,\u201d traveling exhibition, Fosdick Nelson Gallery, Alfred University, NY; Dorothy Uber Bryan Gallery, Bowling Green State University, Ohio; Jack Olson Gallery, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 2005 * \u201cRe/Locations,\u201d MNGallery, Chicago, IL 2004 * \"Migrations,\" Laura Russo Gallery, Portland, OR 2002 * \"Visual Perspectives: 14 Years of the Virginia A.
