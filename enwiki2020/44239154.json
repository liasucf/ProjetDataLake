Its name derives from the Sechsel\u00e4uten (the city's traditional spring holiday), which is celebrated on the square in April. == Geography == Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz is located on the east shore of Lake Zurich, just south of the lake's outflow to the river Limmat and the Schanzengraben moat. The plaza is bounded to the south by the linked Opernhaus and Bernhardtheater buildings; to the west by the Utoquai lakeside promenade; and to the east by Theaterstrasse, across which is Stadelhoferplatz, with the Stadelhofen railway station and the terminus of the Forchbahn (FOB). To the north, Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz merges into Bellevueplatz, where stops for the Z\u00fcrich tram lines 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 15 are located. On November 30, 2011, the government of Z\u00fcrich announced that some streets would be renamed by redesigning the public area at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz. Theaterplatz will be part of the Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz area, and Gottfried-Keller-Strasse and Goethestrasse partially repealed. Residents have been informed that these will be addressed as Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz 1 to 10. In all, Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz covers an area of about . == History == === Prehistory === Locations of prehistoric settlements Alpenquai, Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner The area has been internationally known since 2009, when digging for an underground parking facility uncovered the remains of prehistoric pile dwellings. Remains were found in the immediate vicinity of this wetland soil settlement, Kleiner Hafner, in the lower basin of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The construction works were suspended for nine months and the settlement remains were systematically archaeologically recorded. The results of the excavations are permanently displayed in a pavilion next to the lakeshore. Located on what was then swampland between the river Limmat and Lake Z\u00fcrich, around present-day Sechsel\u00e4utzenplatz\u2013B\u00fcrkliplatz, the prehistoric dwellings were set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the rivers Linth and Jona. The Neolithic settlement Z\u00fcrich\u2013Enge Alpenquai is located at the B\u00fcrkliplatz in Enge, a locality of the municipality of Z\u00fcrich. It was neighbored by the settlements at Kleiner Hafner (a former island/peninsula at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz) and Grosser Hafner island (which was also part of the Celtic and Gallo-Roman settlement area) in the effluence of the Limmat, within an area of about 0.2 square kilometres (50 acres) in the heart of the city of Z\u00fcrich.

There are finds from the Neolithic Egolzwil, Cortaillod and Horgen cultures, forming an important reference which allows study of the cultural development during the late 5th and early 4th millennia BC. They and other prehistoric settlements in the lower Lake Z\u00fcrich area are part of Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps, an UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized as one of 111 world locations with the greatest scientific potential. === Since the Middle Ages === In the late European Middle Ages, the Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz area was the location of the former military harbour of the city of Z\u00fcrich, part of the Stadelhoferbollwerk bastion on the Lake Z\u00fcrich shore. The former Stadelhofer bulwark was built as part of the fourth city fortifications in 1643 AD, its bastion built partly into the lake. In 1673, the Stadelhofen ravelin was attached. These fortifications, which had become obsolete, were completely demolished in 1837\u201338. The restaurant Kornhaus operated on the site from 1839 to 1860. In 1867, the building was taken over as a temporary facility of the Tonhalle orchestra, and demolished sometime after. First mentioned in 1896 as Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, from the 1910s to 2008 the place was a meadow commonly known as Sechsel\u00e4utenwiese. Since 1902, it was used for the spring Sechsel\u00e4uten celebration and other events, including shows by Circus Knie. It also became the home of the Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich and of the Grand Caf\u00e9 Esplanade built by J. Pfister Picault in 1925. On 19 December 1941, the Bernhard-Theater Z\u00fcrich opened as an entertainment theater for plays, farces and comedies in the Swiss-German language. To ensure the food supply of the city population in wartime, potatoes were planted in the meadow in November 1940. In May 1981, the Esplanade building was demolished and the present Bernhard-Theater was re-opened on 27\u201328 December 1984 after three years of transition. In the nearby Schanzengraben, the Old Botanical Garden is located. The area towards the Opernhaus-Bernhardtheater was used as a parking facility from the 1960s until 2008.

In January 2013, the main work began and about a year later the redesigned Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz was inaugurated. The cost for the city of Z\u00fcrich amounted to 17.2 million Swiss Francs, of which CHF 10,250,000 were used on the renewal, road drainage and superstructure of the neighboring roads. The costs for the square's design and construction works totalled to around CHF 28 million, of which 11 million was paid by the canton of Z\u00fcrich. The loss of a car lane on the Utoquai roadway caused a bitter dispute between the city and the canton of Z\u00fcrich, with the district court deciding in favour of the city. The planning works were done by Zach + Z\u00fcnd Architekten, Vetsch Nipkow Landschaftsarchitekten, Heyer Kaufmann Bauingenieure.

The aim of the city government was to \"upgrade for pedestrians in Z\u00fcrich at a central location, to create a place with international appeal\". A total of 110,000 blocks of stone from Vals quartzite \u2013 10 to wide and between 50 and long \u2013 form the square. The material was \"thoroughly tested over a long period\", with respect to cleaning, slip resistance or behavior during prolonged heat. To exclude damage on burning of the B\u00f6\u00f6gg (a winter effigy burned during Sechsel\u00e4uten), a shell of firebrick was installed. Additionally, the impact of elephant dung on the Vals quartzite was tested and anchorages for the Knie's circus tent firmly integrated in the surface structure. The natural stone tiles of the Vals quartzite occupies an area of . The last stones were laid on 19 November 2013, three weeks earlier than planned. In February and March 2014, 56 seven-year-old red oaks and tulip trees were planted. These varieties were particularly suitable for the inner- city location. == Infrastructure and fountain == entrance to the underground infrastructure Rooms under the square, below the groundwater level, provide the hidden infrastructure for lighting, electrical power distribution, and the pumps and control systems for the fountains. , it is the most elaborate water feature in Z\u00fcrich, with individual programmable control to each nozel which can jet fountains up to in height, and can accompany a piece of music. Each nozzle has a white LED light that can illuminate the water from below at night. Drainage systems receive the fountain water though a series of chambers which collect detritus, filter the water, and process it with chlorine and glass water; the purified water is then returned to the pumps to be reused. In all, 1.5 million Swiss Francs were paid for the design. 2014 Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz-'f\u00e4scht' - Springbrunnen 2014-04-26 18-04-09 (P7700).JPG| 2014 Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz-'f\u00e4scht' - Springbrunnen 2014-04-26 18-11-54 (P7700).JPG|fountain nozzle 2014 Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz-'f\u00e4scht' - Springbrunnen 2014-04-26 18-00-49 (P7700).JPG| Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz - Opernhaus - Springbrunnen - Bellevue Z\u00fcrich 2014-10-29 12-59-21 (P7800).JPG| == Activities and sights == Circus Knie as seen from Opernhaus towards Bellueveplatz According to the government's concept, Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz may be used for events 180 days per year. Among them are Circus Knie, Sechsel\u00e4uten and the Z\u00fcrich Film Festival. In the summer months, the square must have full public access for at least 120 days to fulfill its function as the main inner-city space, so summertime events are limited to the area of the former Sechsel\u00e4utenwiese. The former Theaterplatz square in front of the Opera House serves as the connection between Stadelhoferplatz and the Lake Z\u00fcrich lakeshore. The city's authorities declared the area between Stadelhofen station and Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz as a car- free zone. Wienachtsm\u00e4rt, a Christmas fair, is a new event first held in 2015, opened on 19 November by Z\u00fcrich's mayor, Corine Mauch. It had about 100 huts presenting modern design products and traditional handicrafts. == Parking Op\u00e9ra == Opened in May 2012, the underground parking garage houses two parking levels for 299 cars. The parking facility is operated by the Op\u00e9ra AG, a consortium of the companies Hardturmstrasse AG and AMAG. Up to 50 parking spaces are reserved for long-term tenants. The entrance is situated at Falkenstrasse/Schillerstrasse. On Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz, pedestrian access to the facility is provided by two pavilions, one of which houses a boulevard caf\u00e9. The second pavilion has a display presenting an overview of the archaeological findings from the excavation (Arch\u00e4ologie im Parkhaus Opera). == Cultural heritage and protection == As part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, the Neolithic, Celtic and Gallo-Roman settlements are also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as Class objects. Hence, the area is provided as a historical site under federal protection, within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on natural and cultural heritage (German: Bundesgesetz \u00fcber den Natur- und Heimatschutz NHG) of 1 July 1966. Unauthorised researching and purposeful gathering of findings represent a criminal offense according to 24. == Literature == * Margrit Balmer: \"Z\u00fcrich in der Sp\u00e4tlat\u00e8ne- und fr\u00fchen Kaiserzeit.
