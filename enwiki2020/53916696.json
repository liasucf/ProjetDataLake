It is concurrent with All-New, All-Different Marvel and Marvel NOW! 2.0.What Fresh (Start) Hell? A Brief History of Marvel Reboots \u2013 Book Riot ==Publication history== On April 22, 2017, Marvel Legacy was announced by Marvel Comics at the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo. The goal of the Legacy initiative is to bring a greater focus to Marvel's core superheroes, unlike recent relaunches such as Marvel NOW! which gave prominence to newer and younger heroes. Marvel Entertainment's chief creative officer Joe Quesada stated that company was embracing their roots with the creation of this new comic book line. Marvel Comics' editor-in-chief Axel Alonso noted that the relaunch was about reminding readers of the company's rich history by highlighting the connections between characters and reintroducing some iconic characters. The relaunch began in September 2017 following the conclusion of the Secret Empire and Generations storylines, with the release of a 50-page one-shot titled Marvel Legacy #1. Writer Jason Aaron and artist Esad Ribi\u0107 are collaborating on the opening issue and laying the narrative groundwork for the line. The issue will introduce the first super hero team of Avengers that were active in the year 1,000,000 BC. The story will span the history of the Marvel Universe and explore the connection between the prehistoric Avengers and their present-day counterparts. The issue will see the return of a fan-favourite character into active service. Quesada teased the cover artwork for the opening issue, hinting at the possible return of Bruce Banner as Hulk, Tony Stark as Iron Man, Thor Odinson reclaiming the hammer Mjolnir, and the appearance of other superheroes in their classic costumes. The series also saw the return of the original Wolverine after his initial death with the character to show up in three Marvel Legacy titles: Captain America, The Amazing Spider-Man and The Mighty Thor all with Marvel Cinematic Universe-style post credits scenes at the end, he will also show up alongside Captain Marvel and Star-Lord as one of the holders of the Infinity Stones in a crossover event. In addition, the original Jean Grey will also return in her own 5 issue limited series titled Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey in December followed by X-Men Red which sees Jean Grey establish her own team of X-Men that consist of All-New Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Gabby (Laura's clone), Trinary (a new character), and Gentle (a mutant from Wakanda), and later by the Cajun Mutant Gambit. Marvel Legacy #1 has also brought Franklin and Valeria Richards back to the Marvel Universe. Marvel Two-In-One (a series featuring the Thing teaming up with other superheroes) has been revived by the company with the latest team-up with Thing's best friend Human Torch being the guest in the storyline \"Fate of the Four\" which will focus on both heroes trying to solve the mystery of Reed and Sue's disappearances hinting at a possible Fantastic Four reunion. Following the release of Marvel Legacy #1, many Marvel comic series will revert to their classic cumulative numbering system. For their relaunching series, Marvel created a new and consistent cover design that aimed to recapture their work from the 1980s and 1990s. Marvel will release limited quantities of lenticular covers for their Marvel Legacy titles that pay homage to older covers. They are also reintroducing elements such as the Marvel Value Stamp\u2014a collectable clip-and-save program\u2014and the self-published fanzine FOOM. Marvel is including three page primer stories in select Legacy titles to provide background information on their characters for new readers. Written by Robbie Thompson and illustrated by Mark Bagley, the primer stories will cover classic moments from Marvel's comics. The Legacy initiative was succeeded by Fresh Start, another line-wide relaunch by Marvel Comics in mid 2018. ==Ongoing series== In June and July 2017, Marvel revealed the 54 series that make up the Marvel Legacy initiative. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:auto;\" |- !
