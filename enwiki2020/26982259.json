Ireland's Greatest was a 2010 public poll by Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9) and associated television documentary series broadcast on RT\u00c9 One, where viewers voted to choose the greatest person in the history of Ireland. The concept was based on the BBC series 100 Greatest Britons. The winner was John Hume. ==Format== To draw up an initial shortlist of 40 names, RT\u00c9 commissioned an opinion poll of 1,000 members of the public, carried out by Ipsos MRBI in late 2009. The shortlist was published on 22 March 2010 on the RT\u00c9.ie website, and readers could vote for their preferred person for 12 days, ending on 2 April; one vote per IP address was permitted. The top ten was announced on The Tubridy Show with Myles Dungan on 5 April 2010. The top five was established at this point, but not publicised until RT\u00c9's programming schedule for autumn 2010 was unveiled in August. Each of the top five was profiled in a one-hour documentary programme broadcast in autumn 2010 and presented by a public figure advocating that person's claim to the title of \"greatest person\". Viewers voted for the overall winner, announced on The Late Late Show on 22 October 2010. ==Top five== The ranking of the top five, and the advocates who each present a one- hour documentary about one of them, were as follows: {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !

They said that the list was skewed towards recent times, and that many nominees were celebrities from popular culture or sport rather than people who had made a lasting contribution to society; Ferriter said \"It is going to be very hard to take this seriously for historians\". Ryan Tubridy, who presents The Late Late Show, commented, \"There are some really silly names in there. It's contentious to say the least\". Liam Dolan in the Sunday Independent called it \"a shambolic litany of well-intentioned do-gooders and talented non-entities\". People whose inclusion attracted criticism included Stephen Gately, Louis Walsh and Daniel O'Donnell. The Belfast Telegraph noted the absence of Van Morrison and George Best; other absentees noted were Michael Davitt, John McCormack, William Rowan Hamilton, Lady Gregory, and Samuel Beckett. Ken Sweeney in the Irish Independent criticised the ranking of Stephen Gately ahead of \u00c9amon de Valera. The dearth of women \u20143 out of 40\u2014 was also noted. Website science.ie responded to the lack of scientists on the RT\u00c9 shortlist by organising its own poll for Ireland's greatest scientist, won by Robert Boyle. ==Other editions== Other countries have produced similar shows; see Greatest Britons spin-offs ==References== ==External links== * Ireland's Greatest from RT\u00c9 website Category:2010 Irish television series debuts Category:2010 Irish television series endings Ireland Category:Television series about the history of Ireland Category:Irish documentary television series Category:Irish history television shows Category:Irish television series based on non-Irish television series Category:Irish television series based on British television series Category:Lists of Irish people Category:RT\u00c9-related lists Category:RT\u00c9 original programming Category:2010s Irish television series ",
