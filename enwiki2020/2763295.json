    "text": "A triangle choke, or sankaku-jime (\u4e09\u89d2\u7d5e) in judo, is a type of figure-four chokehold that chokes the opponent by encircling the opponent's neck and one arm with the legs in a configuration similar to the shape of a triangle. Applying pressure using both legs and the opponent's own shoulder, the technique is a type of lateral vascular restraint that constricts the blood flow from the carotid arteries to the brain. ==History== Historical Kosen judo triangle choke The triangle choke was seen in early kosen judo competition. While details of its origin are unknown, it is strongly associated to Yaichibei Kanemitsu and his apprentice Masaru Hayakawa, who featured the first registered use of the move in a kosen judo tournament in Kobe, Hyogo in November 1921.\u4e71\u53d6\u5916\u7de8\u30fb\u4e09\u89d2\u7d5e\u3081Kaminarikai Kudo, Gakusei Judo no Dento, May 25, 1973, Hiroku Nippon Judo Earlier names for the technique would have been , or before finally settling down on . According to Kanemitsu himself, a primitive version of the move had been shown by Takenouchi-ry\u016b master Senjuro Kanaya around 1890, though it was apparently a simpler form of neckscissors without the posterior triangle action.Yaichibei Kanemitsu, Okayama Ken Judo Shi, 1958 The sankaku-jime was officially adopted and endorsed by important judokas like Masami Oyama, and soon met plenty of use both in kosen judo and mainstream judo.Takeshi Kuroda, Mai Senshu Monogatari 51: Kanemitsu Yaichibei 9 dan \u2013 Shitei kyodo de sankaku-jime o hatsumeishi tan e-waza no oya, January 1984, Kindai Judo Tsunetane Oda, a fellow kosen judoka,Toshikazu Okada. Master Tsunetane Oda demonstrated the technique on videoTsunetane Oda - judo ne-waza 3 of 3 and is also credited with the creation of the move in some sources. The first reported variation was the front triangle choke or , applied from the position known in modern times as guard, often after a pull down or .Toshiya Masuda, Why Kimura Didn't Kill Rikidozan appendix, 2011 Another variation was the horizontal triangle or , performed from the side. Martial arts historian Toshiya Masuda has attributed its innovation to Masahiko Kimura, who would have created it during the Takudai kosen judo tournament at Takushoku University and accomplished prolonged success with it, though he also deems probable that Kimura only popularized the variation instead of creating it. The inverted variation or , typically seen in modern judo competition, was the next addition, preceding many others. Among those variations, the front triangle is particularly favored by practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. According to a popular belief maintained by Romero Cavalcanti, the technique was introduced in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Rolls Gracie after finding it in a judo book.Roberto Pedreira, Jiu-Jitsu in the South Zone, 1997-2008, January 1, 2013 M\u00e1rcio \"Macarr\u00e3o\" Stambowsky, who was named by Rickson Gracie as one of the earliest Brazilian competitors to popularize the concept, has also credited Rolls. Other sources, like Toshiya Masuda and Roberto Pedreira, believe it might have been introduced in Brazil much earlier by Yasuichi and Naoichi Ono, disciples of Yaichibei Kanemitsu himself, as well as possibly other judo practitioners like Ryuzo Ogawa. Rolls trainee Mario Tallarico lends credibility to this theory, as does a 1935 newspaper clipping that depicts Yasuichi Ono performing a Triangle Choke in his training for an upcoming fight with Helio Gracie.https://jitsmagazine.com/submission-history-the-origins-of- the-triangle-choke/ The triangle choke was first shown in mixed martial arts on March 11, 1994, when Jason Delucia used a triangle to defeat Scott Baker at UFC 2. This variation has remained as the most commonly seen in MMA, although the side or inverted triangle has been also used; on September 26, 1995, Shooto fighter Rumina Sato submitted Isamu Osugi with a flying inverted triangle choke, while many years later, Toby Imada won 2009 Submission of the Year with an inverted triangle choke over Jorge Masvidal. Even more complex holds, like Chris Lytle's inverted mounted triangle/straight armbar combination at UFC 116 in 2010, have also surfaced. == Technique == Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt Marcos Torregrosa landing a flying triangle choke. Tactically speaking, the triangle choke is a very effective counterattack employed from the bottom position, generally applied from the guard, or open guard (defensive positions). The choke can also be applied in the mount, side mount and back mount positions by more advanced grappling practitioners. The need for isolation of one arm could be a rationale for the frequency with which it is attempted in mixed martial arts and combat sports due to the brief vulnerability of one arm while executing hand strikes against an opponent in one of the aforementioned positions. Soldiers demonstrating a triangle choke ===Defensive action=== To escape a triangle choke, the defending practitioner must first elevate their head so as the preclude the full force of the submission, and subsequently must bring their arm away from opposition with their own carotid artery. Once out of immediate danger of loss of consciousness, the practitioner can concentrate on reversing or escaping the figure-four lock. One method for this is to break the opponent's legs apart. With the opposing practitioner applying the choke in a bottom guard position, the defender should start to stand up, with both hands stacked and bearing weight on or above the breast opposite the arm in the choke (or gripping the collar of the opponent's gi). When the defender is nearly standing and leaning over so as to bring their weight to bear on their opponent, the defender should start to walk to the side opposite the captured arm. This pushes the defender's back and shoulder into the leg wrapped around their back, and forces the opponent's other leg to reach forward to maintain the lock. This weakens the strength of the choke and allows the defender to muscle out or force the attacker to release the choke. In mixed martial arts, it is possible for the defender to lift the person applying the choke and slam them down with a powerbomb (also known as a slam) to get them to release the hold. ==In popular media== In the film Lethal Weapon, Mel Gibson's character Martin Riggs uses the triangle choke on a villain Mr. Joshua played by actor Gary Busey. Rorion Gracie is credited as the film\u2019s special technical advisor: Brazilian jiu-jitsu.Rorion Gracie at the Internet Movie Database In the film Abduction, Taylor Lautner's character uses the triangle choke on an antagonist. In the film Haywire, Gina Carano's character uses the triangle choke on Michael Fassbender's character. During a school fight in the anime Ikki Tousen, the character Ryomou Shimei uses the triangle choke on another character, Hakufu. In the 2013 film Oblivion, Tom Cruise's character (Tech 49, Jack Harper) subdues Tech 52 with a triangle choke, to avoid injuring him. Paul Walker, who was a practitioner of Brazilian Ju Jitsu, attempted to triangle Vin Diesel's character in the Fast and Furious series. In episode 5 of Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game Series, a pit fighter named 'Bloodsong' uses this technique while on supine position to choke Asher, one of the 5 playable protagonists in the game. In episode 3 of the God Eater anime, Alisa Illinichina Amiella uses the triangle choke on Lenka Utsugi, the main protagonist. In Assassination Classroom, Nagisa uses the flying triangle on Karma. ==Further reading== *The Triangle by Rigan Machado with David Meyer (2004) ==See also== *Arm triangle choke *List of judo techniques *Ground fighting == References == ==External links== * Triangle Choke Instructional Videos Category:Grappling positions Category:Chokeholds ",
