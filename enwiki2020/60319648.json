    "text": "During the Second World War, the Kingdom of Romania produced, converted or significantly improved a variety of armored fighting vehicles, ranging from licence-built unarmed artillery tractors to tank destroyers of an original design which ended up - according to some accounts - as inspiration for some German AFV. ==Beginnings== National Military Museum in Bucharest Romania took its first step in developing an indigenous AFV industry in 1937, when a licence was acquired from France for the local production of 300 Renault UE armored tractors. It is worth noting that prior to this, not even reparations could be made in Romania, as the country had contracted Czechoslovakia for the repair of its increasingly obsolete and only partially operational fleet of 76 Renault FT-17 World War I-era light tanks. Production of the Renault UE was carried out in Romania between the latter half of 1939 and March 1941, but only 126 vehicles had been delivered. Although Malaxa, the Romanian Bucharest- based factory producing them, could manufacture most of the parts, it still relied on French imports for the engines, gearboxes and instrument panels, and thus production stopped along with the supply of imported parts following the fall of France. Nevertheless, the Romanian \"Malaxa\" tractors differed significantly from their French counterparts. They were heavier by 0.1 tons and their payload was increased from 0.35 to 0.5 tons. Thus, the 126 Romanian Malaxas had a cumulative payload equivalent to that of 180 French UEs.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 33 The licence for the UE tractors was followed by one for the AH-IV tankette, acquired from Czechoslovakia. However, only one vehicle was produced by Malaxa under this licence.Charles K. Kliment, Vladimir Francev, Czechoslovak Armored Fighting Vehicles, Atglen, 1997, pp. 113-114 ==Repairs, improvements and production of parts== National Military Museum (note the metal-rimmed wheels) The Romanian industry adapted to maintain complex AFVs after the 1941 campaign, when it managed to repair 50 of its Panzer 35(t) light tanks at Ploie\u0219ti.Steven Zaloga, Tanks of Hitler's Eastern Allies, p. 27 More comprehensive repairs were carried out for Romania's Renault R35 tanks. An important upgrade was the fitting of new, metal-rimmed, locally designed wheels which were 10 times as durable as the rubber-rimmed originals. Other parts for this tank were also manufactured by several Romanian factories: drive sprockets were produced at the Re\u0219i\u021ba Works, the fore-mentioned metal-rimmed road wheels along with new tracks were produced at the Concordia Works in Ploie\u0219ti, and cylinder heads along with drive shafts were cast at the Basarab Works in Bucharest and finished by IAR at Bra\u0219ov. For the future rearming of 30 R35s as tank destroyers, new gun mounts containing recoil mechanisms were cast at the Concordia Works and fitted as extension to the R35's turret. Romania's T-60 light tanks, captured from the Soviet Union, were to be rebuilt as tank destroyers. To support the added weight this would entail, new road wheels and stronger torsion bars were cast and finished by the Industria Sirmei at Turda, IAR at Bra\u0219ov and Concordia at Ploie\u0219ti. The new superstructure for the would- be tank destroyers was designed and cast at Concordia in Ploie\u0219ti and finished by the Astra Works in Bra\u0219ov and Lemaitre Works in Bucharest. Romanian factories also refurbished 34 captured Komsomolets armored tractors in 1943, and in early 1944 these were fitted with hooks which enabled them to tow the German Pak 38 anti-tank gun.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 221-223 and 225-227 ==Tank destroyers== ===TACAM Series=== A Romanian TACAM T-60 during the National Day parade, 10 May 1943 TACAM R-2 The TACAM Series of tank destroyers consisted in four proposed designs, from which two were produced. A total of 55 TACAM tank destroyers were made, all but one being issued to the Romanian Army by July 1944. ====TACAM T-60==== This was the first Romanian-produced tank destroyer. It was based on the Soviet T-60 light tank, 34 of which were converted to TACAM T-60 tank destroyers by the end of 1943. Several Romanian factories were involved in the project, producing numerous parts for the new vehicle, but the assembly itself took place at the Leonida factory in Bucharest. The new vehicle, weighing 9 tons, mounted one Soviet M-1936 F-22 field gun as its main armament. This was supplemented by one ZB-53 heavy machine gun and one submachine gun.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 221-223 All 34 were operational with the Romanian Army as of 19 July 1944.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 153 ====TACAM R-2==== This was the second Romanian-produced tank destroyer. It was based on the Czechoslovak Panzer 35(t) light tank, 20 of which were converted to TACAM R-2 tank destroyers during the first half of 1944, plus one prototype in late 1943. The vehicles were converted at the Leonida factory in Bucharest. The new vehicle, weighing 12 tons, mounted one Soviet ZiS-3 field gun as its main armament, apart from the prototype, which mounted one F-22. This was supplemented by one ZB-53 heavy machine gun.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 223-225 All of the vehicles, minus the prototype, were operational with the Romanian Army as of 19 July 1944.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 153 ====TACAM R-1==== Proposed design featuring the mounting of a captured Soviet 45 mm anti-tank gun to the AH-IV tankette, 14 of which were still on hand as of late 1943. However, the design was deemed a waste of productive capacity and the project was cancelled.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 228 ====TACAM T-38==== In 1943, it was decided to convert 40 Panzer 38(t) light tanks to tank destroyers by fitting them with captured Soviet field guns. Although not formally rejected, this project never began.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 228 ====Operational importance==== As of 19 July 1944, the TACAMs accounted for over a quarter of Romania's operational AFV able to effectively oppose the Soviet T-34. All such vehicles are listed below:Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 153 {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Name ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Type ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Country of Origin ! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Quantity |- | T-3 | Medium tank | | 2 |- | T-4 | Medium tank | | 81 |- | TACAM T-60 | Tank destroyer | | 34 |- | TACAM R-2 | Tank destroyer | | 20 |- | TAs | Assault gun | | 60 |} ===V\u00e2n\u0103torul de care R-35=== The third Romanian tank destroyer. Although this was also based on a light tank, it was not a TACAM because its turret was not removed and replaced with a fixed superstructure. Instead, it was decided to keep the thickly-armored French turret by fitting it with an extension which contained the mount for the vehicle's new weapon: a Soviet 45 mm tank gun. Because of this larger weapon, however, there was no longer room to also carry a coaxial machine gun, and thus the new vehicle had no secondary armament. A total of 30 R35s were rearmed this way.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 225-227 They, along with 30 unconverted R35s, were operational with the Romanian Army as of 19 July 1944.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 153 ===Mare\u0219al=== Mare\u0219al tank destroyer A native-designed tank destroyer fully enclosed in sloped armor. It never entered service, as only 6 prototypes were completed. Nevertheless, the vehicle is said to have been the inspiration for the German Hetzer tank destroyer. According to some sources, in May 1944, German Lieutenant-Colonel Ventz (a delegate of the Waffenamt) admitted that the Hetzer had followed the Romanian design solution. The table below lists the 6 completed prototypes and their main specifications:Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 228-235 and 149 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Prototype !Crew !Armament !Armor thickness !Armor shape !Chassis !Weight !Engine |- |M-00 || 2 || 122 mm M1910/30 howitzer 1 x ZB-53 machine gun || 200-300 mm steel plate || Turtle || T-60 || 6.7 tons || Ford V8 (85 hp) |- |M-01 || 2 || 122 mm M1910/30 howitzer 1 x ZB-53 machine gun || 200-300 mm steel plate || Turtle || T-60 (enlarged and reinforced) || 6.7 tons || Buick (120 hp) |- |M-02 || 2 || 122 mm M1910/30 howitzer 1 x ZB-53 machine gun || 200-300 mm steel plate || Turtle || T-60 (Rogifer- built, enlarged and reinforced) || 6.4 tons || Buick (120 hp) |- |M-03 || 2 || 122 mm M1910/30 howitzer 1 x ZB-53 machine gun || 10 mm steel || Turtle || Rogifer || 6.6 tons || Buick (120 hp) |- |M-04 || 2 || 75 mm DT-UDR 1 x ZB-53 machine gun || 10-20 mm armour plate (Re\u0219i\u021ba) || Half-hexagon || Rogifer || Unknown || Hotchkiss H-39 (120 hp) |- |M-05 || 2 || 75 mm DT-UDR 1 x ZB-53 machine gun || 10-20 mm armour plate (Bohler) || Half-hexagon || Rogifer || 10 tons || Hotchkiss H-39 (120 hp) |} ==Table of vehicles== ===Produced from scratch or assembled from captured components=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Model !Type !Number !Manufacturer !Note |- |Malaxa || Armored tractor || 126 || Malaxa || Licence-made enlarged Renault UE |- |AH-IV || Tankette || 1 || Malaxa || |- |TACAM T-60 || Tank destroyer || 34 || Leonida || Fitted with F-22 field gun |- |Mare\u0219al || Tank destroyer || 6 || Rogifer || Four armed with 122 mm howitzer and two armed with 75 mm anti-tank gun |} ===Converted existing tanks in service with the Romanian Army=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Model !Type !Number !Manufacturer !Conversion |- |TACAM R-2 || Tank destroyer || 21 || Leonida || Fitted with ZiS-3 field gun (prototype fitted with F-22 field gun) |- |V\u00e2n\u0103torul de care R-35 || Tank destroyer || 30 || Leonida || Rearmed with 45 mm tank gun |} ===Improved=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Model !Type !Number !Main improvement !Note |- |Renault R35 || Light tank || 30 || Rubber-rimmed wheels replaced by metal-rimmed ones which were 10 times more durable || 30 tanks, later rearmed as tank destroyers, also benefited of this upgrade |- |T-20 Komsomolets || Armored tractor || 34 || Hook fitted, enabling the towing of German 50 mm anti-tank guns || |} ==Related equipment== ===Towed guns with shields=== *75 mm Re\u0219i\u021ba Model 1943 - native-designed, towed (wheeled) dual- purpose field/anti-tank gun, featuring a shield consisting of two 6 mm plates set 20 mm apart (375 produced until December 1944, including 3 prototypes)Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 235-237 and 149 *47 mm Schnieder Model 1936 - French-designed, towed (wheeled) anti-tank gun, featuring a shield as well as armored wheels which could be removed and placed as side extensions to the shield for increased protectionFranz Kosar, Motorbuch-Verlag, 1978, Panzerabwehrkanonen: 1916-1977, p. 165 (in German) (140+ produced under licence by Romania at the Concordia Works, production rate being of 14 pieces per month as of October 1942)Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 29-30 and 75 File:Tun 75 mm Resita Model 1943.jpg|75 mm Re\u0219i\u021ba Model 1943 File:47 mm Schneider Mle 1936.JPG|47 mm Schneider Model 1936 ===Unarmored fully tracked/all-wheel drive artillery tractors=== *T-1 tractor - fully tracked artillery tractor designed specifically to tow the 75 mm Re\u0219i\u021ba gun (5 prototypes produced)Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, pp. 237 and 149 *Ford Marmon Herrington 3-ton 4x4 truck - locally assembled 4WD Ford truck, able to tow guns of 75 mm caliber (450 built)Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 38 == References == Category:World War II armoured fighting vehicles of Romania Category:World War II armoured fighting vehicle production ",
