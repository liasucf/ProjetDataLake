    "text": "Laborie is a Quarter \u2013 an administrative division inherited from the former French colonial regime (from French: quartiers) \u2013 on the Caribbean island- nation of Saint Lucia. According to the 2002 census, the population of the Quarter was 7,414 people. The village of Laborie is located about 27 km south of Castries, the nation's capital. ==History== The first inhabitants of the Laborie general area, migrating from South America around 1000 a.c., were probably the Arawak Amerindians. Laborie, a southwestern fishing village named after the French governor Baron De Laborie, was once a turtle habitat. French colonials were probably the first to settle what is now the village of Laborie, in the early 18th century. ==Notable people== Prominent Laborians include the second prime minister \u2013 and first being elected to the position following independence \u2013 of St. Lucia, Sir Allan Louisy; the 7th Prime Minister of St. Lucia, Dr. Kenny Anthony; and the Past Governor General, Dame Pearlette Louisy. ==Adjacent quarters== ==External links== * Laborie Community Portal Category:Quarters of Saint Lucia ",
