    "text": "Break the Rules is the fifth studio album by Namie Amuro. It is her second album of 2000, coming only 11 months after her previous album Genius 2000, and is her final album to date with producer Tetsuya Komuro. Due to the small space in time between the release of this album and her last album, only two singles precede it. == Overview== Break the Rules is her second album to feature songs written and produced by American music producer, Dallas Austin. His role in this album, however, is much smaller than the last. For Genius 2000, Austin produced half of the album; with this album he only produced four songs. The majority of the tracks features compositions from Amuro's main producer, Tetsuya Komuro. First editions of the album came in special packaging. The booklet was presented as a foldout poster featuring Amuro looking out of an airplane window. It also came with a foldout card of photos depicting Namie in different locations around America, mostly New York City, New York and Los Angeles, California. The album was housed in a transparent slip case with the phrase \"break the rules\" in pink running diagonally across the front and back of it. The songs \"Think of Me\" and \"No More Tears\" were released as a double a-side single shortly after the release of the album. A video was made for \"Think of Me\" in New York during photo sessions for the album artwork. No video was made for \"No More Tears.\" Previous songs that appear on the album have all been slightly modified. These songs include \"Never End,\" \"Please Smile Again,\" and \"Cross Over.\" \"Cross Over\" features a rap verse from Poppa L.Q. Unique among Amuro albums is that it features her first attempt at singing a song entirely in English on the track, \"Looking for You\". The album was certified Platinum by the RIAJ. ==Track listing== == Personnel == * Namie Amuro \u2013 vocals, background vocals * Poppa L.Q. \u2013 vocals * Terry Bradford \u2013 background vocals * Alex Brown \u2013 background vocals * Andy Caine \u2013 background vocals * Jennifer Carr \u2013 background vocals * Debra Killings \u2013 background vocals * Maxayn Lewis \u2013 background vocals * Oleatha \"Butta\" Richie \u2013 background vocals * Juliet Roberts \u2013 background vocals * Will Wheaton Jr. \u2013 background vocals * Ken Kimura \u2013 guitar * Tetsuya Komuro \u2013 acoustic piano, keyboards, synthesizer * Kazuhiro Matsuo \u2013 acoustic guitar Production * Producers \u2013 Dallas Austin, Ricciano Lumpkins, Tetsuya Komuro * Arrangement \u2013 Dallas Austin, Tetsuya Komuro * Mixing \u2013 Dave Darlington, Kevin \"KD\" Davis, Chris Puram, Alvin Seights * Midi & Sound Design \u2013 Rick Sheppard * Vocal Direction \u2013 Kenji Sano * Remixing \u2013 Junior Vasquez (No More Tears Remix) * Photography \u2013 Shoji Uchida * Art Direction \u2013 Tycoon Graphics == Charts == Album - Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Release !Chart !Peak position !Sales total |- |rowspan=\"3\"|20 December 2000 |Oricon Daily Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 | |- |Oricon Weekly Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |334,520 |} Singles - Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"650px\" !Release !Single !Chart !Peak position |- |rowspan=\"2\"|12 July 2000 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Never End\" |Oricon Daily Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |Oricon Weekly Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|4 October 2000 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Please Smile Again\" |Oricon Daily Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |Oricon Weekly Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|24 January 2001 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Think of Me\" / \"No More Tears\" |Oricon Daily Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|5 |- |Oricon Weekly Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|7 |} Total Single Sales: 969,940 Total Album and Single Sales: 1,304,460 ==References== Category:Namie Amuro albums Category:2000 albums Category:Albums produced by Dallas Austin Category:Albums produced by Tetsuya Komuro Category:Avex Group albums ",
