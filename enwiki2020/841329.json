    "text": "Joshua Lanier Martin (December 5, 1799November 2, 1856) was an American Democratic Party politician who served (as an Independent) as the 12th Governor of the U.S. state of Alabama from 1845 to 1847. He also served as a representative to the United States Congress for Alabama's 2nd district from 1835 to 1839. He was born on 5 December 1799 in Blount County, Tennessee. He taught school during his young years and studied law in Maryville, Tennessee; then moved to Alabama in 1819 where he continued his studies. He passed the bar and commenced a law practice in Athens, Alabama. He was known as an ardent Democrat. Before serving the state of Alabama as its governor, he served as a legislator, solicitor, circuit judge, and congressman. He was first elected to congress as part of the 24th Congress and a member of the Jacksonian Party, however changed parties to the Democratic Party when elected to the 25th Congress. In 1845 he opposed other Democratic leaders and ran as an independent for the seat of governor, defeating the mainstream Democratic candidate, and Democrats never forgave him for his action. By doing so, however, he denied the Whig Party any chance it might have had to win the office that year. During his term of office, the state capitol was moved from Tuscaloosa, Alabama to its current location in Montgomery, Alabama. His term also saw the US declare war on the Republic of Mexico. As governor, Martin saw to the dissolution of the state bank, which he had perceived as crooked. Although he initially ran for reelection in 1847, he withdrew his name from consideration. After his term as governor, he returned to law practice in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but did serve one more term in the state legislature in 1853. He never lost an election for public office. Martin died in 1856 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama at the age of 56. ==References== ==External links== *National Governors Foundation * \"Joshua Martin.\" Birmingham, Alabama Wiki (\"Bham Wiki\") (online), http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Joshua_Martin. * Bailey, Hugh C. \"Joshua L.
