    "text": "The American Radiator Building (since renamed to the American Standard Building) is a , 23-story landmark skyscraper located at 40 West 40th Street, in midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was conceived by the architects John Howells and Raymond Hood,\"AIA Guide to New York City\", 4th Edition, pg 229 and built in 1924 for the American Radiator Company, five years before it merged with Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company to form American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation which 38 years later, became simply known as American Standard. ==History and description== The building's structural form is based on Eliel Saarinen's unbuilt competition entry for the Tribune Tower, augmented with a strong use of color. 40th Street facade The architects combined Gothic and modern styles in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Howells and Hood employed the talents of their frequent collaborator Rene Paul Chambellan for the ornamentation and sculptures. In 1988, successor company American Standard sold the building to a Japanese company. In 1998, the building was sold to Philip Pilevsky for $150 million. Three years afterwards, the American Radiator Building was converted into The Bryant Park Hotel with 130 rooms and a theatre in the basement. The landmark status of the exterior required the conversion pay special attention to the renovation of the facade decor, and prohibited proposed changes such as bigger guestroom windows. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was also a subject of Georgia O'Keeffe in her noted 1927 painting Radiator Building \u2013 Night, New York. ==See also== * Carbide & Carbon Building * Ideal House, London * Richfield Tower ==References== == External links == * Hotel website: http://bryantparkhotel.com/ * in-Arch.net: The American Radiator Building * New York Architecture Images- American Standard Building * Floor plans from Architectural Forum (1924) Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan Category:Office buildings completed in 1924 Category:1924 establishments in New York (state) Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan Category:Art Deco architecture in Manhattan Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:Hotels established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in New York City Category:Skyscraper hotels in Manhattan Category:Bryant Park ",
