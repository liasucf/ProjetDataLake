The buses were carrying more than 200 (possibly 340 (Link dead as of 15 January 2007)) sailors from Trincomalee who were going on leave. The bombing killed between 92 and 103 sailors and wounded more than 150 people, including over 100 sailors. The bombing also killed a number of civilians, including eight employees of the Sri Lankan military, and wounded many passers-by and roadside traders. The suicide bombing followed intense fighting in the Jaffna Peninsula that left 133 soldiers (Link dead as of 15 January 2007) and up to 200 LTTE fighters dead (although this number is unofficial, as the LTTE have reported losing only 22 fighters). The attack was followed by government air strikes on LTTE territory, although the military claimed they were in response to an artillery attack and not the suicide bombing. In January 2009 Sri Lankan authorities arrested a suspect, Balachandran, who reportedly helped construct the bomb used in the attack. The attack had been planned at least three months in advance.http://www.lankatimes.com/fullstory.php?id=19739 ==References== Category:2000s murders in Sri Lanka Category:Attacks on civilians attributed to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Category:Car and truck bombings in Sri Lanka Category:Civilian massacres in Sri Lanka Category:Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacks against buses Category:Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacks in Eelam War IV Category:Mass murder in 2006 Category:October 2006 crimes Category:October 2006 events in Asia Category:Suicide bombings in Sri Lanka Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Asia Category:Terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka in 2006 ",
