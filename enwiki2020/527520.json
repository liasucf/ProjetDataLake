    "text": "Gweilo or gwailou (, pronounced ) is a common Cantonese slang term for Westerners. In the absence of modifiers, it refers to white people and has a history of racially deprecatory and pejorative use, although it has been argued that it has since acquired a more neutral connotation. Cantonese speakers frequently use gwailou to refer to Westerners in general use, in a non-derogatory context, although whether this type of usage is offensive (i.e., an ethnic slur) is disputed by both Cantonese and Westerners alike.Brown, Jules. Gardner, Dinah. Hong Kong and Macau, 2002. Rough Guides publishing. . p 399 ==Etymology and history== Gw\u00e1i () means \"ghost\" or \"devil\", and l\u00f3u () means \"man\" or \"guy\". The term gw\u00e1il\u00f3u therefore literally means \"ghostly man\", and is sometimes translated into English as \"foreign devil\". In Chinese, \"ghost\" can be a derogatory term used as a curse or an insult. The term ghost has also been used to describe other ethnic groups, for example, a 17th-century writer from Canton Qu Dajun wrote that Africans \"look like ghosts\", and gw\u00e1in\u00f2u () was once used to describe African slaves. ==Usage== The term gw\u00e1i () is an adjective that can be used to express hate and deprecation, an example being the local's expression of their hatred towards the Japanese during their occupation of Hong Kong in World War II with the same gw\u00e1i. It conveys a general bad and negative feeling but is a somewhat obsolete and archaic/old-fashioned term nowadays and other more modern terms have largely replaced gw\u00e1i for similarly negative meanings. Cantonese people sometimes call each other s\u0113ui gw\u00e1i (), which means bad person, though more often than not it is applied affectionately, similar to \"Hey bitch!\" in English when used affectionately. Nowadays, Cantonese speakers often refer to non-Chinese people by their ethnicity. The pejorative sense of gw\u00e1il\u00f3u () can be identified when the term is used as it is the equivalent to saying, with a hatred tonal, which refer white male = \"white devil\", or just refer gw\u00e1il\u00f3u as a slang of white guy, which doesn't really have insulting nuances. Although largely considered racist and derogatory by both Cantonese speakers and non- Cantonese people,Oriental Expat. Gaijin, Farang, Gweilo \u2013 Confused? Retrieved 10 December 2006. gw\u00e1il\u00f3u is sometimes considered to be an acceptable generic racial term for Westerners. Also, some members of the Hong Kong community with European ancestry (particularly those with limited or zero Cantonese fluency) are indifferent to the term, and those who believe that the best way to defang a word intended as a \"slur\" is to embrace it, and use gweilo to refer to non- Chinese in Hong Kong. Gwailou has, in some instances, been recognised as simply referring to white foreigners in South East Asia and now appears on Oxford Dictionaries defined as such, although non-Caucasian foreigners are not gw\u00e1il\u00f3u. While gw\u00e1il\u00f3u is used by some Cantonese speakers in informal speech, the more polite alternative s\u0101i y\u00e0n () is now used as well, particularly if the conversation involves a non-Chinese person in order to avoid offense. However, an increasingly common view is that the term is unacceptable in a modern context. The word is not permitted to be used in Hong Kong media due to the offensive nature of the term as brought up by Hong Kong actors of non- ethnic Chinese background. == Related terms == Gwai is one of the term of various terms to refer to a Caucasian foreigner that is considered controversial and potentially offensive; other Cantonese term exists when referring to foreigners, a list of which is given below: . * gwaijai (; ) for Caucasian boy. * gwaimui (; ) for Caucasian girl. * gwaipo (; ) for Caucasian woman. * baakgwai (; ) for Caucasian people. * haakgwai (; ) for Black people. * sai yan (; ) for Westerners. * yeung yan (; ) for Westerners. * ngoigwok yan (; ) for foreign nationals. * acha (; ; from \"acch\u0101\" meaning \"good\" in Hindi) for South Asians. * molocha (; ) for South Asians. === Mandarin Chinese === A Boxer Rebellion pamphlet, circa 1899, that refers to foreigners as guizi. Guizi (; ) is a Mandarin Chinese slang term for foreigners, and has a long history of being used as a racially deprecating insult. * Riben guizi (; ) or dongyang guizi (; ) - used to refer to Japanese. * Er guizi (; ) - used to refer to the Korean soldiers who were a part of the Japanese army during the Sino-Japanese war in World War II.\u7b2c\u4e00\u6ef4\u8840\u2500\u2500\u5f9e\u65e5\u65b9\u53f2\u6599\u9084\u539f\u5e73\u578b\u95dc\u4e4b\u6230\u65e5\u8ecd\u640d\u5931 (6) News of the Communist Party of China December 16, 2011 * Yang guizi (; ) or xiyang guizi (; ) - used to refer to Westerners. However, xiaogui (; ) is a common term in Mandarin Chinese for a child. Therefore, some argue that gui () in Mandarin is just a neutral word that describes non-expectable or something hard to predict. Laowai (; ), is the word most commonly used for foreigners, and is a less pejorative term than guizi. Although laowai literally means \"old foreigner\", but depending on context, \"old\" can be both a term of endearment and one of criticism. The pejorative aspect of the term laowai comes from conjoining the words old and outsider, suggesting the described person to be a visibly aged and unfamiliar, characteristics usually associated with apparitions or ghosts. ==In popular culture== ===Comics=== *Larry Feign's Lily Wong comic stories, about the buildup to the handover of Hong Kong to China, frequent uses the term, often in a derogatory sense used by Lily's father. ===Film=== *In Big Trouble in Little China (1986), James Hong refers to Kurt Russell as a gwai lo. *In Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993), Bruce Lee (played by Jason Scott Lee) is told to not teach martial arts to the Gweilo anymore; however, Lee wants to teach whoever wishes to learn. *In The Final Option (1994), Special Duties Unit instructor Stone Wong (played by Michael Wong) warns his trainees against calling him gwai lo for his having spent a long time abroad and often speaking English.
