    "text": "Myzocytosis (from Greek: myzein, (') meaning \"to suck\" and kytos (') meaning \"container\", hence referring to \"cell\") is a method of feeding found in some heterotrophic organisms. It is also called \"cellular vampirism\" as the predatory cell pierces the cell wall and/or cell membrane of the prey cell with a feeding tube, the conoid, sucks out the cellular content and digests it. Myzocytosis is found in Myzozoa and also in some species of Ciliophora (both comprise the alveolates). A classic example of myzocytosis is the feeding method of the infamous predatory ciliate, Didinium, where it is often depicted devouring a hapless Paramecium. The suctorian ciliates were originally thought to have fed exclusively through myzocytosis, sucking out the cytoplasm of prey via superficially drinking straw-like pseudopodia. It is now understood that suctorians do not feed through myzocytosis, but actually, instead, manipulate and envenomate captured prey with their tentacle-like pseudopodia. ==References== ==Further reading== * (2010) Endosymbiotic associations within protists Phil.
