    "text": "Sabinaite (Na4Zr2TiO4(CO3)4) is a rare carbonate mineral. It crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system as colorless to white prisms within cavities. It is more typically found as powdery coatings and masses. It has a specific gravity of 3.36. It has been found in vugs in a carbonatite sill on Montreal Island and within sodalite syenite in the alkali intrusion at Mont Saint- Hilaire in Quebec, Canada. It was first described in 1980 for an occurrence in the Francon quarry, Montreal Island. It is named after Ann Sabina (1930\u20132015), a mineralogist working for the Geological Survey of Canada. == References == *Mineral Handbook *Data from Mindat *Webmineral data Category:Sodium minerals Category:Zirconium minerals Category:Titanium minerals Category:Oxide minerals Category:Carbonate minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ",
