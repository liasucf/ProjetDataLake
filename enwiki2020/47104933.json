His parents moved to Leiden, Netherlands, in 1821.Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek (New Dutch Biographical Dictionary), Part 9, pgs 584-587 Bio of Conradus Leemans [Retrieved 2020-03-14] ==Education== Leemans enrolled at Leiden University in 1826 to study theology, but changed to archaeology in 1828 apparently after meeting with Caspar Reuvens. ==Leiden Museum== In 1834 he was employed at the Leiden Museum and while there became successor to Reuvens as Director, during 1839. He continued in this capacity until sometime during 1891. Leemans organised the first public display of collections of acquisitions made by Reuvens, compiled a catalogue of Egyptian objects (Catalogue raisonn\u00e9e, 1840), and edited the serial publication of the Monumens \u00e9gyptiens, this being a lithographic account detailing the collection.Friends of Saqqara Foundation Bio of Conradus Leemans [Retrieved 2015-06-28] Leemans studied the Leiden papyrus while Director of the museum, completing the work begun by Reuvens on this. But while executing the task, Leemans at some time added to the papyri a form of vegetable paper, which was added by him in order to preserve the artifact. Either the paper or glue used to affix the paper has degraded causing some of the writing to become obscured, and Leemans' addition is thought to be fixed permanently, since otherwise too great damage would be done to the artifact in its removal.Griffith, F.
