Critters was a funny animal anthology comic book published by Fantagraphics Books from 1985 to 1990 under the editorship of Kim Thompson. Prior to Furrlough and Genus, this was the longest running funny animal anthology comic book series. The title lasted for 50 issues. Furthermore, it served as the flagship title of Fantagraphics' line of funny animal series in the 1980s. The last 12 issues were switched to revolving features of issue-long stories, rather than the anthology format. Declining sales, due in part to the 1980s black-and-white comics market overload (many titles of which were funny-animal comics aiming for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles market) led to this title's cancellation.
