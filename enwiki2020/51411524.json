    "text": "\"Nobody Speak\" is a song by American hip hop producer DJ Shadow, featuring rap verses from American rap duo Run the Jewels. The song was first a part of Run the Jewels' Record Store Day release, which was a virtual reality cardboard viewer that included a digital download code for the song. It also acted as the lead single from Shadow's fifth studio album, The Mountain Will Fall (2016). A music video for the song was released on August 24, 2016. ==Composition== \"Nobody Speak\" features rap verses from El-P and Killer Mike of rap duo Run the Jewels, who were credited as the song's writers alongside DJ Shadow. It contains a musical sample of \"Ol' Man River\" by Caterina Valente, and a lyrical sample from \"Top Billin'\" (from Audio Two's 1987 album What More Can I Say?). The instrumental features a funk-like bass and drum groove, brass horns, as well as guitar loops. Shadow chose El-P and Killer Mike as collaborators due to their vocal style fitting the song's instrumental the most. ==Release== \"Nobody Speak\" was first made available through the Run the Jewels Record Store Day release. It consisted of a special virtual reality cardboard viewer, which held a code that granted the purchaser to a free digital download of the song. The song was eventually made available for a paid download through Mass Appeal Records. The song was later released as a limited edition 12\" vinyl single on August 24, 2016 through Mass Appeal and Liquid Amber. ==Music video== A music video for \"Nobody Speak\" was released on August 24, 2016. The video, which has been described as \"brutal [and] politically charged\", features political representatives in a meeting. The leaders of the groups begin a rap battle against each other, which after around 90 seconds turns into an all-out brawl involving virtually everyone in the meeting room. The video finishes with one leader preparing to impale his counterpart with an American flag. The leaders of the groups are played by Igor Tsyshkevych and Ian Bailey. Shadow commented on the video, saying that they wanted to make a \"positive, life-affirming video that captures politicians at their election-year best. We got this instead.\" Killer Mike also commented on the video, saying that \"It's such a dope video ... it's what I really wish Trump and Hillary would just do and get it over with.\" The video was directed by Sam Pilling and features cameo appearances of Shadow, El-P, and Killer Mike. It was filmed at the \"Ukrainian Dim\" (Ukrainian House) exhibition center in Kyiv, Ukraine. ==Track listing== *Mass Appeal \u2014 MSAP0034 \u2014 Promotional CD-R and digital download single *Mass Appeal / Liquid Amber \u2014 MSAP0036LP \u2014 12\" vinyl single ==Personnel== Personnel adapted from The Mountain Will Fall liner notes. *Tim Burns \u2013 trombone *DJ Shadow \u2013 arrangement, composing, mixing, production, programming *El-P \u2013 composing, vocals *Mikael Eldridge \u2013 mixing *Killer Mike \u2013 composing, vocals *Graham Pike \u2013 trumpet *Jake Telford \u2013 baritone and tenor saxophone ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Chart (2016\u20132017) !Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | US Dance/Electronic Digital Songs (Billboard) | 13 |- ! scope=\"row\" | US Rap Digital Songs (Billboard) | 40 |} ==References== Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:DJ Shadow songs Category:Songs written by El-P Category:Songs written by Killer Mike Category:Songs written by DJ Shadow ",
