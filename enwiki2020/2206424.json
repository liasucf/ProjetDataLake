    "text": "The Oratory School () is a coeducational independent Roman Catholic day and boarding school for pupils aged 11-18 located in Woodcote, north-west of Reading. Founded in 1859 by John Henry Newman, The Oratory has historical ties to the Birmingham Oratory and is the only school founded by Newman. Although a separate entity from the nearby Oratory Preparatory School, it shares a common history. Newman founded the school with the intention of providing boys with a Roman Catholic alternative to Eton College. According to the Good Schools Guide, the school \"enjoys inspirational leadership, has achieved GSG 'overall best in UK' for three years running and is consistently at the top of the tree\", with \"state-of-the-art\" boarding facilities and an ongoing refurbishment programme under way. The Independent Schools Inspectorate said in 2007: \"Pupils and staff show deep and committed support to the Catholic values that underpin the school\", and \"genuine excitement and enjoyment shine through in sporting, musical and creative activities. Individual pupils and teams have achieved distinction in a wide range of activities, particularly in sport\", and pupils \"have recently represented Great Britain in rowing, shooting and real tennis, England in cricket and Ireland in rugby\". == History == The Oratory School was founded in 1859. The first boys arrived before work began on 1 May that year.Newman\u2019s Letters and Diaries, Volume XIX, p.120. The objective was to provide a Roman Catholic alternative to other schools, particularly for the sons of converts from Anglicanism who considered existing Catholic schools culturally and socially inferior. ==Music and The Schola Cantorum== The school has an orchestral and choral tradition, with former choristers of Westminster Cathedral among the pupils. The school's professional youth choir, known as the 'Schola Cantorum', has over 40 pupils and demands high performance caliber and therefore standard auditions and requirements. They have performed at venues such as Windsor Castle and for the Pope, as well as frequent public performances around the country, most commonly London, most recently Nelson's mass and Zadok the Priest in Hyde Park. Several choristers have recently joined the National Youth Choir of Great Britain. ==Real Tennis== The Oratory is one of five schools in the United Kingdom with a real tennis court (others being Radley, Canford, and Wellington College) and plays this sport, hosting championships and international tournaments. It was the first location in the United Kingdom to construct a Real Tennis court for 80 years, finishing the building in 1990. Over recent years the UK Professional Singles Tournament has been held at the court, and in April 2006 the World Championships were held there in which world no. 1 Robert Fahey (Australia) beat USA player Tim Chisholm. In January 2020 the World Championship Eliminator match took place between Camden Riviere and Old Oratorian, Nicky Howell. Camden Riviere went on to play the current Real World Tennis World Champion, Robert Fahey in the Final Eliminator in Boston in February 2020. In September 2020, The Oratory School welcomed Claire Fahey, reigning Women\u2019s Real Tennis Champion as its Head of Racquets and Games Coach. Robert Fahey is Head Professional of The Oratory School Real Tennis Club (ORTC). Together Team Fahey represents the most successful partnership in history winning almost 100 open titles between them.

O'Brien was sentenced to thirteen years imprisonment. ===Disciplinary=== In February 2014, there were allegations that an older pupil had been beating younger students and killing animals outside school. === Leavers' day photo === In May 2018, it was reported that several sixth form students had attended their informal leavers' day photo dressed as slaves and \"cotton pickers\". When the group of boys arrived for the photo they were turned away by the headmaster. The students later returned to the school and a photo of them within the school grounds was shared on social media. The students later stated that several of their black friends supported their choice of costumes and had joined in by dressing as the slave owners. A spokesman for the school apologised for the students' behaviour and said that the school condemned all forms of racist behaviour. The playing fields ==Notable alumni== Former pupils include tenor Gervase Elwes, war artist Simon Elwes, Rugby Union players Danny Cipriani and Ayoola Erinle, Olympic gold medallist John Pius Boland, Victoria Cross recipient Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, Made in Chelsea stars Francis Boulle & Frederik Ferrier, and Portuguese royal Afonso, Prince of Beira. ==See also== *The Oratory Preparatory School *List of Victoria Crosses by school *List of rowing blades by school and university ==References== ==Further reading== *Tony Tinkel, Cardinal Newman's School: 150 years of The Oratory School, Reading ==External links== * The Oratory School website * Profile on the Independent Schools Council website Category:Boys' schools in Oxfordshire Category:Boarding schools in Oxfordshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1859 Category:Oratory of Saint Philip Neri Category:Roman Catholic independent schools in the Archdiocese of Birmingham Category:Independent schools in Oxfordshire Category:Catholic boarding schools in England Category:1859 establishments in England Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference Category:Real tennis venues ",
