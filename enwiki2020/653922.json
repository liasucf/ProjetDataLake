    "text": "Stenhousemuir Football Club is a Scottish football club located in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk. They are a member of the Scottish Professional Football League and currently play in Scottish League Two. Through much of its history the team has competed in the lower leagues of Scottish football, most recently being relegated to Scottish League Two in 2019 via the play-offs one year after being promoted to League One. In September 2009, Stenhousemuir Football Club, Ltd. was re-registered as a Community Interest Company. == History == === 1884\u20131989 === The club was founded in 1884 following a breakaway from a local team called Heather Rangers.A Brief History of Stenhousemuir Football Club, www.stenhousemuirfc.com Retrieved 2011-06-02. In 1890, the Warriors moved to Ochilview Park following spells at Tryst Park and Goschen Park. In the early 20th century the club had a brief spell of success, winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup twice in 1901 and 1902. In 1902\u201303, the club reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, losing 1\u20134 at home to Rangers. The 1921\u201322 season saw Stenhousemuir compete for the first time in senior Scottish League Football. In 1925\u201326, Stenhousemuir goalkeeper Joe Shortt was offered a \u00a350 bribe to throw a match against Broxburn United, but he rejected the offer and the Warriors won the match 6\u20132. A bookmaker from the Bainsford district of Falkirk, was subsequently jailed for attempted match fixing. In 1928, the wooden grandstand at Ochilview Park burnt down in a fire, which led to a new stand being built in its place, although staircases reputedly had to be added later due to planning errors. The 1936\u201337 season saw the club register a record victory \u2013 a 9\u20132 home win against Dundee United. More than a decade later in 1949\u201350, a Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against East Fife drew a record crowd of 12,525 \u2013 the highest ever at Ochilview Park. On 7 November 1951, the first floodlit game between two Scottish senior teams occurred at Ochilview Park, a friendly match between Stenhousemuir and Hibernian. The floodlights had been paid for three years earlier by Tommy Douglas, a butcher in King Street, Stenhousemuir. In the summer of 1964, Rangers revealed a plan to The Scottish Football League to remove the Warriors from the league, along with four other clubs, on the basis that they were poorest-supported clubs over the previous three seasons.Move to Oust 5 Football Clubs Halted, 1964-05-26, Londonhearts.com. Four years later, Stenhousemuir, along with Albion Rovers, Berwick Rangers, Brechin City and Stranraer, with support from a number of clubs, including Celtic, Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians, successfully defeated the plan. In 1972\u201373, the Warriors defeated Rangers 2\u20131 at Ibrox Stadium in Second Round 2nd leg of the Scottish League Cup. Notably, Rangers were the holders of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup at the time. Rangers progressed 6\u20132 on aggregate having previously won the 1st leg 5\u20130 at Ochilview. === 1990\u2013present === In 1992\u201393, the Club allowed their rivals Stirling Albion to groundshare at Ochilview Park. In the 1993\u201394 season, the Warriors were moved out of the bottom league for the first time, due to the formation of the Scottish Third Division. The mid-1990s were one of the Club's most successful periods in its history; in 1994\u201395 they defeated St Johnstone 4\u20130 and Aberdeen 2\u20130, both higher league opposition, en route to the Scottish Cup quarter finals. In the 1995\u201396 season, Stenhousemuir won the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Dundee United 5\u20134 on penalties after a goalless 90 minutes and extra time. In the process they reached their first national semi- final since season 1902\u201303. In 1997\u201398, Stenhousemuir were relegated from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish Third Division for the first time in the history of the Club. However, the next season (1998\u201399) the Warriors won promotion back to the Second Division, also for the first time in the history of the Club. In 2006\u201307, the Club installed a new synthetic surface at Ochilview Park. It became the first in the UK to pass the FIFA 2 Star category accreditation. A new synthetic surface was installed in the summer of 2014. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, Stenhousemuir were promoted back to the Scottish Second Division (having been relegated from there in season 2002\u201303) after defeating Cowdenbeath 5\u20134 on penalties, this after drawing 0\u20130 on aggregate in the play-off final. The 2010\u201311 season saw the Club narrowly avoid another relegation after spending most of the season in the bottom two positions. On the final day of the season the club defeated Peterhead 3\u20130 to move above Alloa Athletic and therefore avoided the relegation play-offs. In 2013 Stenhousemuir reached their second Challenge Cup Semi-Final by beating Dundee on penalties after drawing 1\u20131 but went on to lose 1\u20130 to Rangers. In January 2014, after parting company with Martyn Corrigan, the Warriors appointed Scott Booth as their new manager. Booth was relieved of his duties on 1 February 2015 after winning just 12 from 42 games and failing to record any back to back victories. Assistant Manager, Brown Ferguson, took temporary charge for the second time, and the club announced on 2 April 2015 that 'Bomber' Brown would take over as manager on a full-time basis for the 2015\u201316 season. After a poor season in 2016\u201317, the club found itself relegated to Scottish League Two. However, the club came straight back up the following season despite finishing in fourth spot, winning promotion through the play- offs after beating Queen's Park in the play-off semi-finals and then Peterhead in the final. 2018\u201319 saw the club relegated back to League Two after defeat to Annan Athletic in the play-offs. == Supporters and rivalries == Stenhousemuir Supporters' Trust is the official supporters' club of Stenhousemuir FC. It is a democratic organisation based on one vote per person, and its committee is elected every year by the members. It is the largest shareholder in the club with about 11% of the shares with the aim to increase the shareholding so that no individual(s) can wrest the control of the club away from its supporters. The Kriss Akabusi Loyal is a band of dedicated home and traveling supporters. Stenhousemuir have a young group of fans that sing throughout the games to create an atmosphere known as the Stenny Bois. They have equipment such as drums, megaphone, flags, banners and more. Both players and fans love the atmosphere they create.

The club also draws much international support: the Norwegian Supporters' Club is a small supporters' organisation based in Oslo, Norway. The Supporters Club was founded on New Year's Eve 1992 by Rolf Erik Wulff, Christian Wulff and Kjell Jarslett. In 1996 it was given one share of Stenhousemuir F.C. as a recognition of their support and promotion of the club. As of today, the supporters club and its members owns about 5% of the shares in Stenhousemuir. Stenhousemuir FC also has Danish support. The Denmark-based supporters club is an unofficial Warriors fan club founded and established in the summer 2000. The fan club has approximately 30 members. Stenhousemuir Supporters Trust, also known as The 'Warriors Supports Trust' is registered with the Financial Services Agency as a not-for-profit Industrial and Provident Society. It was established in 2003. It works with the Board of the football club and the Supporters Club to develop a more successful football club. The annual membership subscription of the Trust is \u00a35 but Trust members can take out either a 'silver' membership of \u00a35 a month, or a 'gold' membership of \u00a310 a month. The cash obtained from membership of the Trust is used to buy shares the football club has for sale, and hence the club benefits financially. Since its inception the Trust has given money to the club and its members have given their time and labour towards several projects. The current Chairman of the Stenhousemuir Supporters Trust is Graeme Wallace, who is also the stadium announcer at Ochilview. The biggest rivals are East Stirlingshire with whom they share a fierce local rivalry, as they are both from the Falkirk area and have frequently played in the same division.Stenhousemuir 1 v 1 East Stirlingshire, Stenhousemuir F.C.. 22 November 2008.
