    "text": "Albro Lake is a neighbourhood in the north end of the community of Dartmouth in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality. Albro Lake takes its name from the shallow freshwater lake of the same name. The lake was named after John Albro, who first settled in the area with a group of other residents from Portsmouth, Rhode Island. The neighbourhood includes the Highfield Park and Crystal Heights; both being developments in the Albro Lake neighbourhood which were named by their developers. A newer development Lancaster Ridge is built on the former Department of National Defence housing lands. The streets are named for aircraft used by the Royal Canadian Air Force.Google Maps Albro Lake is bounded by Leaman Drive to the west, Lancater Ridge to the east, Highway 111 to the north, and Albro Lake Rd to the south. The neighbourhood developed during the post-war years and until 1968 hosted the Royal Canadian Navy's Naval Radio Station Albro Lake (land which was subsequently developed into Highfield Park). The housing in the neighbourhood is a mixture, ranging from high-density low-rental apartment buildings in Highfield Park built during the 1970s and 1980s, to small single-family houses, duplexes, townhouses and small apartment buildings. The socio-economic indicators for the neighbourhood show that it comprises mostly low-to-middle income households. ==Neighbourhood amenities== ===Parks=== *Albro Lake Park *Golden Acres Park ===Natural areas=== *Albro Lake *Little Albro Lake *Martin Lake ===Sports facilities=== *Grey Arena ===Schools=== *John MacNeil Elementary School *John Martin Junior High ===Community facilities=== *Dartmouth North Community Centre ===Memorials=== *Halifax Explosion memorial **Located at the intersection of Albro Lake Road and Pinecrest Drive, this memorial is dedicated to the victims of the Halifax Explosion.
