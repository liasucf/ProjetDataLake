He made his professional bow for the Primera B Metropolitana club on 10 May 2014 against Colegiales, coming off the substitutes bench in place of Jonathan P\u00e1ez as the fixture ended 2\u20132. His first start arrived on 25 May versus Deportivo Armenio, with Platense finishing the 2013\u201314 campaign fourth; eventually losing in the play-off final to Temperley.
