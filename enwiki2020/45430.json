    "text": "Pane carasau (, ; \"toasted bread\", from the past participle of Sardinian verb \"to toast\", referring to the crust) is a traditional flatbread from Sardinia. It is thin and crisp, usually in the form of a dish half a meter wide. It is made by taking baked flat bread (made of durum wheat flour, salt, yeast, and water), then separating it into two sheets which are baked again. The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for shepherds, who used to stay far from home for months at a time. Pane carasau can last up to one year if it is kept dry. The bread can be eaten either dry or wet (with water, wine, or sauces). A similar, yeast-free bread is called in Sardinian; it is also known as in Italian, meaning \"music sheet\", in reference to its large and paper-thin shape, which is so thin before cooking that a sheet of music can be read through it. Remains of the bread were found in archeological excavations of nuraghes (traditional Sardinian stone buildings) and it was therefore already eaten on the island prior to 1000 BC. ==References== ==External links== * A video showing the production of Pane carasau * History of Pane Carasau Category:Italian breads Category:Flatbreads Category:Cuisine of Sardinia Category:Ancient dishes ",
