    "text": "The Patrologia Graeca (or Patrologiae Cursus Completus, Series Graeca) is an edited collection of writings by the Christian Church Fathers and various secular writers, in the Greek language. It consists of 161 volumes produced in 1857-1866 by J. P. Migne's Imprimerie Catholique, Paris. It includes both the Eastern Fathers and those Western authors who wrote before Latin became predominant in the Western Church in the 3rd century, e.g. the early writings collectively known as the Apostolic Fathers, such as the First and Second Epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, Eusebius, Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa. The 161 volumes are bound as 166 (vols. 16 and 87 being in three parts and vol. 86 in two). An important final volume, which included some supplements and a full index, was never published, as the plates were destroyed in a fire (1868) at the printer.Ferdinando Cavallera, Patrologia Graeca Cursus Completus - Indices, Apud Garnier Fratres, Paris, p. 21 The first series contained only Latin translations of the originals (81 vols., 1856-61). The second series contains the Greek text with a Latin translation (166 vols., 1857-66). The texts are interlaced, with one column of Greek and a corresponding column on the other side of the page that is the Latin translation. Where the Greek original has been lost, as in the case of Irenaeus, the extant Greek fragments are interspersed throughout the Latin text. In one instance, the original is preserved in Syriac only and translated into Latin. Quite often, information about the author is provided, also in Latin. A Greek, D. Scholarios, added a half-published list of the authors and subjects, (Athens, 1879) and began a complete table of contents (Athens, 1883). In 1912, Garnier Fr\u00e8res, Paris, published a Patrologia Graeca index volume, edited by Ferdinand Cavallera. ==List of volumes== As with the Patrologia Latina, the authors are (with a few exceptions) in chronological order, spanning the period from the earliest Christian writers to the Fall of Constantinople. === pre-Nicaean === === 4th century === === 5th century === === 6th century === === 7th century === === 8th century === === 9th century === === 10th century === === 11th century === === 12th century === === 13th century === === 14th century === === 15th century === ==Republication== A new edition has been prepared by the Centre for Patristic Studies, Athens (\u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd).
