    "text": "T\u00edvoli is a 1974 Mexican comedy-drama film directed by Alberto Isaac and starring Alfonso Arau, Pancho C\u00f3rdova, Lyn May and Carmen Salinas. Loosely based on the true story of the last days of the T\u00edvoli, an infamous variety theatre which had its heyday in the 1940s and early 1950s in Mexico City, the film, as its opening text claims, rather than give an historical account, aspires to evocate, in a nostalgic and humorous way, the atmosphere of the lively nightlife of that period, \"which has disappeared forever.\" Interweaved with burlesque performances with colorful costumes and sets, seductive stripteases and comedic variety acts, the film's main plot tells how a plan to tear down the theater by politicians, city officials, and property developers is met with resistance by the entertainers.Mora p.134Wilt, Dave (May 8, 2001). \"Tivoli\".
