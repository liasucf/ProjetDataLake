    "text": "Tim Markstr\u00f6m (born 9 October 1986) is a Swedish footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Sandvikens IF. ==Career== Markstr\u00f6m was born and raised in the town of G\u00e4vle, where he began his football career at local clubs IK S\u00e4tra and Valbo FF. Between 2008 and 2012 he mostly played in the Swedish third tier, Division 1, representing both Ume\u00e5 FC and Sandvikens IF. After enjoying a successful stint at the latter club he attracted interest from abroad, finally signing for FC Fredericia in the Danish second tier in August 2012. He however featured sparingly for Fredericia during the first half of the season and subsequently left the club when his short term-contract came to an end. Instead, he signed for the Stockholm-based club Hammarby IF in Superettan before the 2013 season. Markstr\u00f6m was being used as a backup for Johannes Hopf during his first three seasons at the club, also being sent on loan to IK Brage during the second half of the 2013 season. Hammarby enjoyed a promotion to Allsvenskan in 2014, where Markstr\u00f6m would make his competitive debut for the side on 30 May 2015. He played the whole game as Hammarby drew, 2-2, against Halmstad BK on home turf. He would eventually make another four appearances for Hammarby during the 2015 season, before being replaced by the Icelandic international \u00d6gmundur Kristinsson. Markstr\u00f6m signed a new two year- contract with the club during the fall the same year. On 13 July 2017, Markstr\u00f6m left Hammarby by mutual consent. ==Personal== Tim's brother Jacob is a professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for the Vancouver Canucks in the National Hockey League (NHL). Their father Anders Markstr\u00f6m was also a professional football goalkeeper during the 1980s, representing both Hammarby IF and Gefle IF in the Swedish top tier. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Ume\u00e5 FC players Category:Sandvikens IF players Category:FC Fredericia players Category:Hammarby Fotboll players Category:IK Brage players Category:Swedish footballers Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Danish 1st Division players Category:Swedish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Denmark ",
