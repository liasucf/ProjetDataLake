    "text": "The New Haven Junction Depot is a historic former railway station at the junction of United States Route 7 and Vermont Route 17 in New Haven, Vermont. Probably built in the 1850s, it is a well-preserved example of a first- generation railroad depot. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and now houses offices. ==Description and history== The former New Haven Junction Depot stands adjacent to railroad tracks just north of the western junction of US 7 and Vermont 17 in the village of New Haven Junction. It is a single-story brick building with a gabled roof. It has Italianate styling, including rounded-arch windows and extended eaves supported by large brackets. The track-facing facade has two entrances, located in the second and fourth of five bays. An original manual semaphore control tower rises through the eave near the center of that facade. with The station's exact construction date is not known, and is assumed to be in the decade following the 1849 introduction of railroad service to the area by the Rutland and Burlington Railroad. The station was first listed as a stop in that railroad's timetables in 1854, suggesting construction of the depot took place in 1852 or 1853. The railroad was in the second half of the 19th century an important transportation artery for both the Burlington area's lumber industry, and the Rutland area's marble quarries. This building underwent restoration in the late 1970s. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Addison County, Vermont ==References== Category:Railway buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Addison County, Vermont Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1854 Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Addison County, Vermont Category:Buildings and structures in New Haven, Vermont Category:1854 establishments in Vermont ",
