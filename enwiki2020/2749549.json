Tracing a faint power ring transmission from Green Lantern, Superman joins the heroes on Rann. Strange has enlisted their aid to defeat an energy vampire called Starbreaker, who is intent on destroying Rann and consuming the planetary energy. Although Starbreaker splits into three copies that begin the process, the villain is defeated by Adam Strange and the Justice Leaguers. Intent on vengeance, Starbreaker attacks Earth, initially defeating Superman, Green Lantern and the Flash. The entire Justice League gathers, and after being spurred on by Hawkman, defeat Starbreaker with the aid of Sargon the Sorcerer. The villain is then incarcerated by the Guardians of the Universe.Justice League of America #96-97 (Feb. - March 1972) Starbreaker eventually escapes, and conquers the planet Almerac, intent on devouring its energies. Another version of the Justice League oppose Starbreaker, with member Blue Beetle manipulating the armour of teammate Booster Gold, using it to absorb the energy from which the villain is composed.Justice League America #62-65 (May - Aug. 1992) A death-cultist called Sh'ri Valkyr from the planet Thanagar slowly resuscitates Starbreaker, feeding the villain victims and thereby allowing him to regain a corporeal form. Valkyr plans to use Rann's teleportation technology - the Zeta-Beam - to convert the entire universe into energy to feed Starbreaker, who would rule a new universe. With the help of allies the Omega Men and interplanetary peace-keepers L.E.G.I.O.N., Adam Strange strands Starbreaker in an empty universe devoid of energy. Before being killed, Valkyr retaliates by teleporting Rann to Polaris, home system of the planet Thanagar, beginning the Rann-Thanagar War.Adam Strange vol. 2, #1-8 (Nov. 2004 - June 2005) An incorporeal Starbreaker returns, intent on destroying his primary foes, the Justice League of America. Starbreaker uses the villain the Shadow Thief as a pawn, and locates an entity possessing enough energy to sustain his form for many years. Revealed to be the adult form of a Sun Eater, Starbreaker engages the League in combat and is weakened by Doctor Light and Firestorm, before being shot in the head with an exotic weapon by Paladin (alternative version of Batman). Although Starbreaker's form dissolves, the League acknowledge the defeat is temporary and that the entity will reform.Justice League of America vol. 2, #29-34 (March - Aug. 2009) ==Powers and abilities== The character is initially presented as a humanoid \"energy vampire\" with exceptional strength and durability; and capable of flight, energy projection and creating illusions. Starbreaker can also be empowered by draining negative emotions such as hatred and fear from other beings. The entity is eventually revealed to be a mature version of a \"Sun Eater\" that requires large amounts of energy to survive, typically draining the energy required from entire stars and then being capable of creating a humanoid form. As an energy entity, however, Starbreaker is susceptible to any device capable of draining energy, which will disperse the humanoid form. ==References== ==External links== * Starbreaker at the DCU Guide * Cosmic Teams: Adam Strange Category:Characters created by Dick Dillin Category:Characters created by Mike Friedrich Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972 Category:DC Comics aliens Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains ",
