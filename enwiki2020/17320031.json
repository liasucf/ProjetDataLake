She dreamt of being a star at an early age, having been inspired by the theatrical personality of Rev. Ralph Washington Sockman, the minister of Christ Church Methodist, the church she attended in Manhattan.http://www.DarkShadows.Online As a teenager, she appeared in an Off-Broadway production, and also did modelling. With her dark red hair, green eyes, classic features, and tall, slender figure, she was popular on the runway, and often did print work. In 1959, Marie performed on Broadway as a showgirl in Gypsy starring Ethel Merman.Marie Wallace at IBDB Marie continued to perform in Broadway shows in the 1960s and early 1970s including the 1966 production of Sweet Charity in the role of \"Ursula\". ==Dark Shadows== In 1968, Marie received national attention when she landed the first of three roles in the Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows produced by Dan Curtis. Her first appearance was on October 4, and she played the part of the diabolical Frankenstein-like monster \"Eve\". She would go on to play the demented wife of Quentin, \"Jenny Collins\", Marie's personal favorite character, who was notable for her unkempt mane of red hair, black lace dress, and hysterical, cackling laughter. Her last part in the series was \"Megan Todd\", an antique shop owner in the \"Leviathan\" storyline. Her final episode on the program was aired March 16, 1970. In 2009, she returned to the world of Dark Shadows in the series of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions. In 2010 she reprised the role of \"Jenny Collins\" in The Doll House. ==Later career== After Dark Shadows, Marie had a part as the delightfully evil \"India Bishop Delaney\" in Somerset, a soap opera spin-off from Another World. She continued to perform on Broadway, in soap operas, the theatre, and did many television commercials. In 1993, she played the part of Eleanor of Aquitaine in a stage production of The Lion In Winter which was directed by her former Dark Shadows co-star Jonathan Frid.

Labbe followed-up with another interview in issue #77, this time focusing on Marie's recently released autobiography. He also interviewed her for Fangoria #313, the issue devoted to the new Johnny Depp/Tim Burton version of Dark Shadows.
