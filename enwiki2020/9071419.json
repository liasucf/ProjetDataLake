The present Pontifical Lateran University was founded in 1773 by Pope Clement XIV after he had suppressed the Society of Jesus, and officially entrusted the clergy of the Diocese of Rome with the mission to teach theology and philosophy to seminarians from the Roman Colleges. In 1824 Pope Leo XII restored the Jesuits and returned them what became the Pontifical Gregorian University, but allowed the secular clergy who had been replaced to continue to devote themselves to teaching: at the site where the Palace of Saint Apollinaris stood in 1853, Pope Pius IX founded the Faculty of Canon Law and Civil law and the Pontifical Institute Utriusque Iuris. The new institution took the name of Pontifical Roman Seminary University. Pope Pius XI gave the Ateneo its permanent seat at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, and in 1932 the vicar general of Rome was assigned as its Chancellor. Pope Pius XII in 1958 established the Pontifical Institute Pastorale. The following year, Pope John XXIII erected the institute into a university and gave it the name of the Pontifical Lateran University. In 1981 Pope John Paul II founded, in the University, the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family, which has the right to confer academic degrees. Pope Francis modified its mission in September 2017, renaming it the John Paul II Pontifical Theological Institute for Marriage and Family Sciences. The Institute has the authority to award its own academic degrees. In 2001 the Lateran University Press was established to publish scientific publications and seven magazines. According to the Decree of the Ministry of University and Scientific Research of the Italian Republic of 21 September 2006, implementing Law No. 63, March 5, 2004, the Laurea in Law (L/31) and Laurea Magistrale in Law (LMG/01) are equivalent to degrees issued by Italian universities. == Structure == The Grand Chancellor is, under the statutes of the University, the vicar general of His Holiness for the Diocese of Rome. ===Grand Chancellors=== * Camillo Ruini (1 July 1991 \u2013 27 June 2008) * Agostino Vallini (27 June 2008 \u2013 26 May 2017) * Angelo De Donatis (26 May 2017 \u2013 present) ===Rectors=== * Pietro Rossano (1982 \u2013 1991) * Umberto Betti, O.F.M.
