Livy reports that it lay on the route of the consul Gnaeus Manlius Vulso from Synnada to the sources of the Alander. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica said that the town was renamed to Augustopolis (presumably in honour of the Emperor Augustus), which became the seat of the later bishopric of Augustopolis in Phrygia.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th edition, \"Phrygia\" Its site is unlocated but northwest of Philomelion in Asiatic Turkey. ==References== Category:Populated places in Phrygia Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Populated places of the Byzantine Empire Category:Lost ancient cities and towns ",
