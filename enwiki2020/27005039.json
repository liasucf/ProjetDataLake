Mow has published over 315 full-length peer-reviewed, archival papers and book chapters, has delivered over 450 podium presentations at bioengineering meetings, and he has delivered over 450 invited seminars, keynote, plenary and distinguished named lectures in orthopaedic biomechanics. According to Google Scholar, his papers have been cited over 33,500 times, and he has an h-index of 100 as of October 5, 2015.Google Scholar Record of V.C.

(cited over 900 times) Among Mow's many activities, he was the first PhD to be elected President of the Orthopaedic Research Society and from 2000 to 2011 was the founding chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University. ==Early life and education == Mow's ancestral hometown is Ngai Tou, in Fenghua, Zhejiang, China. He was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, in 1939 during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War, as the 5th of 6 brothers. His father Mow Pang Tzu, was a nephew of Mao Fumei, the first wife of Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Republic of China between 1928 and 1975.The Last Empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the Birth of Modern China, by Hannah Pakula, Simon and Schuster, Nov 3, 2009, page xvi. Mow Pang Tzu graduated from the 3rd class of China\u2019s Whampoa Military Academy in 1927 and later became Lt. General of the Republic of China Air Force.Webpage for General Pang Tzu MowCLIMAX, Roy Langdon, \"General Mow and the $19,000,000\", June 1957, pp. 2 - 9. In the late 30th and early 40th, General Mow was largely responsible for bringing Captain Chennault, the father of the Flying Tigers, to China.\"Preemptive Strike\", by Alan Armstrong, The Lyons Press, first edition (2006), p. 2-3 & 59-62.

In 1942, General Mow was assigned to the U.S. to establish the Chinese Air Force Office in Washington, DC. In August 1945, he was awarded the U.S. Legion of Merit by President Harry Truman, for \"exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States from February 1943 to August 1945.\"Legion of Merit Citation In 1949 his wife, Wong Ay Chuan, and five of his six sons (Van, Maurice, Donald, Harry and William) joined General Mow in Washington, DC, where they lived in a diplomatic residence on 32nd Street, N.W.\"The Tarnished Treasure of General Mow,\" by Richard O'Connor, Coronet Magazine, Vol. 41, p. 114 (1957).Los Angeles Times, \"Back to His Future,\" by Evelyn Iritani September 28, 1997. In the early fifties, General Mow became entangled in an embezzlement scandal that was covered in great detail in major US and Chinese newspapers and even let to a congressional hearing.CONGRESSIONAL HEARING HRG-1952-SJS-0024, Subcommittee To Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws; Committee on the Judiciary, \"Testimony of Frances Yuan and Col.

Mow managed to obtain a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1962. After graduation, Mow decided to pursue a Ph.D. degree at Rensselaer in applied mechanics and applied mathematics. In his thesis he developed a perturbation mathematical method to predict secondary vortex flows in polymeric fluids. Five Mow brothers (Van, Maurice, Donald, Harry and William, founder of Bugle Boy Industries, a clothing manufacturer) received a total of 3 Ph.D. degrees in mechanics and applied mathematics, one bachelor's degree each in architecture and electrical engineering from RPI.RPI Alumni Magazine, Summer 2005 == Career == Following his doctoral graduation in 1966, Mow went on for a postdoctoral fellowship in applied mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University with Joseph B. Keller. One year later, he joined the Applied Mechanics and Mathematics Group at Bell Labs working on computer programs for U.S. sonar detection of submarines off the East Coast of America. He returned to RPI in 1969 as Associate Professor of Applied Mechanics. In 1976, he was promoted to the rank of Professor, and received a visiting scientist position at the Skeletal Research Laboratory of Harvard Medical School with Melvin J. Glimcher. The following year, to broaden his prospective, Mow received the coveted NATO Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship to visit eight European countries each with universities with noted research in bioengineering. In 1982, Mow was awarded the John A. Clark and Edward T. Crossan Endowed Chair Professorship in Engineering from Rensselaer. Mow moved to Columbia University in the city of New York in 1986 as the Anne Y. Stein Endowed Chair professor in Mechanical Engineering and Orthopaedic Bioengineering. There he started to work on new ways to map joints, such as the knee, shoulder and wrist, for surgical precision. \"Experimental Technology Maps Joints for Surgical Precision,\" New York Times, January 17, 1989 In December 1995, he received an invitation from Executive Vice Provost Michael M. Crow and Provost Jonathan R. Cole, to lead the formation of a new Department of Biomedical Engineering (DBME) at Columbia University and became the inaugural Chair from 2000 to 2010. Following a highly public dispute with the Dean of the Engineering School, during which he called Dean Feniosky Pe\u00f1a-Mora a \"control freak\", Mow stepped down from his position in 2011.\"Discord Over Dean Rocks Columbia Engineering School,\" New York Times, December 8, 2011, p. A30. He retired in 2018. == Honours == In 1991 Mow was elected to the National Academy of Engineering \"For major contributions toward orthopedic engineering, particularly understanding the physical behavior of cartilage and the arthritic process.\"National Academy of Engineering Citation In 2004, ASME established the Van C. Mow Medal for its Bioengineering Division to be bestowed upon an individual who has demonstrated meritorious contributions to the field of bioengineering; the individual must have earned a Ph.D. or equivalent degree between 10 and 20 years of the award. ; Awards and honors in 1980s and 1990s * Kappa Delta-Elizabeth Winston Lanir Award, Best Research in Orthopaedics, AAOS, 1980 * President, Orthopaedic Research Society, 1982-1983 (First PhD President) * Melville Medal, Highest ASME honor for original paper, 1982 * Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship, 1986 * Fogarty Senior International Fellowship, 1987 * HR Lissner Award for Contributions to Bioengineering, ASME, 1987 * Bristol- Myers/Zimmer Award for Excellence in Orthopaedic Research, 1990 * Elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering (1991) * Giovani Borelli Award, American Society of Biomechanics, 1991 * College of Fellows, American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, Founding Member, Elected 1992 * Elected to the United States National Academy of Medicine (1998; 2015) * Robert H.
