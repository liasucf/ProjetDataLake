It is a suburban development centred west of Charing Cross and ENE of Heathrow Airport. Its origin coincides with the 12th century arch in its chapel, the date when it is first recorded. Reflecting its mid-19th century agrarian nature it remained below church status in Hayes parish until 1859. It often lends its name to an electoral ward of around 12,500 people.Simpson, Ludi (November 2005). Measuring residential segregation: regional and city profiles: Ealing ; page 2.
