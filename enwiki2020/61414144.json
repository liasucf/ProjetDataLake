    "text": "Troy Powell (born January 27, 1969 in Brooklyn) also known as Troy O'Neil Powell is an American dancer, choreographer, educator, and director. He is a former principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and former artistic director of AAADT's second company, Ailey 2. Powell was fired in July of 2020 after an independent investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at the Ailey School concluded that he had engaged in \"inappropriate communications\" with students who were interested in joining the Ailey 2. == Early life == Born and raised in Brooklyn, Powell met Alvin Ailey at the age of nine when Ailey came to his school to teach a masterclass. Unknown to Powell at the time, the class was actually an audition for a scholarship to attend the first children's program at The Ailey School. Though he lacked formal dance training, Powell was handpicked by Ailey to join the program. During his time at school, Ailey served as a mentor and father figure to Powell. In 1987 he graduated from LaGuardia High School of The Performing Arts with a concentration in dance. The following year he was invited by Sylvia Waters to join Ailey 2, which was then known as the AIvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble. As a member of AAADT's second company, Powell danced in a wide range of ballets by Ailey and other commissioned choreographers. During his time with Ailey 2, Powell was singled out for his dancing by Jennifer Dunning who wrote in her review for the New York Times that \"he performs as if filled with the dance, with an infectious though private look of delight that has a Nijinsky-like radiance to it.\" == Career == Powell was invited to join the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1991 by Judith Jamison, who had assumed artistic directorship of the company following Ailey's death in 1989. During his tenure with the AAADT, Powell toured across the globe performing principal roles in Ailey's Blue's Suite, For 'Bird'-With Love, Masekela Language, The River, Night Creature, Phases, and the Sinner Man trio in Revelations, Ulysses Dove's Episodes, Hans van Manen's Polish Pieces, George Faison's Suite Otis, Talley Beatty's Stack-Up, Earl Mosely's Days Past, Not Forgotten, Billy Wilson's The Winter in Lisbon, Donald Byrd's Dance at The Gym, and in Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's male casting of Shelter. After presenting his choreography for Passages at the 1996 Ailey Gala, Powell was commissioned to create a ballet for the main company. The piece, Ascension, debuted in 1998 and was dedicated by Powell to the memory of his mother. In an interview with the NYTimes, Powell praised Judith Jamison for continuing Ailey's tradition of providing opportunities to people of colour to choreograph and showcase their artistry. In tandem with his career at Ailey, Powell also danced with Complexions Contemporary Ballet, which was founded by his Ailey colleagues Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, and performed as a Principal Guest Artist with Batsheva Dance Company, Dallas Black Dance Theatre, and Fred Benjamin Dance Company. == Director of Ailey 2 == In 2001, after performing with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 10 years, Powell left the company to join The Ailey School as a master Horton technique teacher and to become the resident choreographer of Ailey 2. His ballets for Ailey 2 have included The Tyner Project, Fragments, First Circles, Point of Departure, How Small a Thought, External Knot, Hope (How They Rise), Reference Point, and Ebb and Flow. In 2003 he was appointed associate director of Ailey 2. Following the retirement of Sylvia Waters in 2012 he was designated artistic director of Ailey 2, making him the second person to lead the company in its 38 year history. In 2015, Powell produced Ailey 2 in the company's first solo season at the Joyce Theatre. As part of the 2019 Ailey Spirit Gala\u2014which commemorated the 50th anniversary of The Ailey School\u2014Powell choreographed a biographical ballet that followed his journey through the Ailey institution, from entering the school to joining the first company. He used students from The Ailey School along with members of Ailey II and the main company to choreograph the piece which he titled, Testimony. AAADT leading dancer Solomon Dumas danced as the adult version of Powell. Powell stated that Dumas' status as the first graduate of AileyCamp to join the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater as a company member, made their stories mirror images of each other. Powell dedicated Testimony to Alvin Ailey, crediting him as \"a lifesaver\" who \"gave me these two feet that I\u2019m standing on.\" == Media == Powell appeared on season 14 of America's Next Top Model the episode Let's Dance as a guest coach and choreographer, teaching the models how to pose in different styles of dance. He was featured on the Polish edition of So You Think You Can Dance as a guest choreographer in 2012, teaching the contestants choreography from his ballet External Knot. == References == == External links == * Category:20th-century American dancers Category:African-American ballet dancers Category:African- American male dancers Category:People from Brooklyn Category:American choreographers Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century American dancers ",
