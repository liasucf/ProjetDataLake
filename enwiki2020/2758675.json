    "text": "Richard Joseph \"Turk\" Farrell (April 8, 1934 \u2013 June 10, 1977) was an American professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to , spending his entire 14-year MLB career in the National League (NL). He threw and batted right-handed. Farrell fathered MLB pitcher Richard Dotson who played for the Chicago White Sox. ==Career== Born in Boston, Massachusetts, he played for the NL Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Houston Colt .45s / Astros. Before the 1953 season, Farrell was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent. The 19-year-old began his Minor League Baseball (MiLB) career with the class A Schenectady Blue Jays. There, over a two-year span (1953\u201354), he would build a Win-Loss record of 18\u201318, with a 3.30 ERA. He spent 1955 in the IL, with the Syracuse Chiefs, going 12\u201312 with a 3.94 ERA; in 1956, he played for the Miami Marlins, going 12\u20136 with a 2.50 ERA. In September, 1956, Farrell would get a late-season look by the Phillies and would lose his only decision; but he set the groundwork for a 14-year run in the major leagues. Farrell was one of the young Phillies pitchers of the late 1950s, along with Jack Meyer and Jim Owens, dubbed the \"Dalton Gang\" for their fun-loving late-hour escapades.

Bearing the brunt on one occasion was the mirror in a Milwaukee bar, broken by Farrell's fist with the explanation, \"I looked in the mirror and didn't like what I saw, so I threw a punch.\" Phillies fans liked what they saw of the hard-throwing rookie right-hander in 1957 when he was 10\u20132 plus 10 saves and a 2.38 ERA in 52 appearances out of the bullpen. On September 3, 1957, Farrell was the winning pitcher for the Phils in the last of fifteen home games the Dodgers played at the Jersey City Roosevelt Stadium, 3\u20132 in twelve innings. After four more seasons of relief work with the Phils, Farrell was traded to the Dodgers early in 1961. Farrell was selected in the 1961 MLB expansion draft by the Houston Colt .45s. In 1962, Farrell finished with the seventh best ERA at 3.02, but with a poor 10\u201320 record. A starter in Houston, Farrell was used almost exclusively in relief with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. His career totals include 590 games pitched (134 starts), a won-loss record of 106\u2013111, 83 saves, and an ERA of 3.45. He was selected to the National League All-Star team 4 times (1958, 1962, 1964 and 1965) in his career. Farrell last pitched in the major leagues on September 19, 1969 for the Phillies against the Expos in a game the Phillies lost 10\u20136. Farrell went innings in the first game of a doubleheader at Parc Jarry, allowing one hit and striking out one. He would never pitch in the majors again, and would leave the US shortly thereafter for good. Farrell moved to England, where he lived and worked on an offshore oil rig just off Great Britain in the North Sea. He was killed on June 10, 1977, in an auto accident in Great Yarmouth, England, at age 43. He was buried in Houston, Texas. ==References== ==External links== *Turk Farrell at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Turk Farrell at Baseball Almanac *Turk Farrell at Baseball Library *Turk Farrell at Astros Daily *Turk Farrell at Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Professional Baseball League) *Turk Farrell at The Deadball Era * Category:1934 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Algodoneros de Uni\u00f3n Laguna players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Houston Colt .45s players Category:Industriales de Valencia players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Miami Marlins (IL) players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Richmond Braves players Category:Road incident deaths in England Category:Schenectady Blue Jays players Category:Sportspeople from Boston Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players ",
