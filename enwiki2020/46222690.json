After the war, she studied medicine at the Latvian State University, where she earned a doctor's degree in 1974. Muceniece achieved habilitation (Dr.habil.med.) in 1992. Muceniece's scientific career began at the August Kirhenstein Institute of Microbiology, Latvian Academy of Sciences (), first as a senior laboratory assistant, later as a senior research associate. Muceniece's laboratory started to study enteroviruses in the 1960s, and the research led to the identification of an echovirus that had possible use to treat melanoma, which became RIGVIR. Production and research was discontinued in 1999 and restarted after national registration in Latvia in 2004.
