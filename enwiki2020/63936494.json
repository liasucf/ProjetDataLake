    "text": "The Federation of General State Administration (, FAGE) is a trade union representing civil servants in France. The union originated as a split from the National Federation of State Workers, an affiliate of the General Confederation of Labour, by those who objected to the influence of the French Communist Party. Although only a minority joined the new union, the Federation of General Administration, it included a majority of prefectural workers. In 1948, it affiliated to Workers' Force, and became a founding affiliate of its General Federation of Public Servants. In 1953, the small National Economic Federation merged into the union. By 2002, the union claimed 30,000 members. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Public sector trade unions Category:Trade unions in France Category:Trade unions established in the 1940s ",
