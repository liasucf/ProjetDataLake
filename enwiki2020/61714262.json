The plant is owned by Limak- IC \u0130\u00e7ta\u015f and in 2018 received 70 million lira capacity payments. The area is a sulfur dioxide air pollution hotspot and the air pollution caused by Kemerk\u00f6y and neighboring Yata\u011fan power station and Yenik\u00f6y power station is estimated to have caused 45,000 premature deaths. The plant would have to be upgraded to meet the 2020 emission standard. In 2019 local people protested against 48 villages being destroyed by expansion of the mine feeding the plant. ==References== == External links == * Kemerk\u00f6y power station on Global Energy Monitor Category:Coal-fired power stations in Turkey ",
