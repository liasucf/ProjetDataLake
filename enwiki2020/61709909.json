They were intended to decorated the seat-backs in its audience hall on piazza della Signoria. Charity was the first painting to be completed and was delivered in December 1469. The commission was temporarily transferred to Botticelli, probably after a delay by Pollaiolo. Botticelli produced Fortitude before loud protests from Pollaiolo and his brother Antonio led to a second contract returning the commission to Piero and his studio to produce the remaining six works in the series. In completing it, it is unclear how much of a contribution Antonio made to Piero's work and some art historians have attributed it instead entirely to Antonio. Billi, Albertini and Cruttwell argue from documents that the whole cycle was by Piero, whereas Ullman and others attribute all six works to Antonio based on stylistic comparisons with the few signed works by Antonio, including prints. Yet others attribute the composition of the work to Antonio but the paintings themselves to Piero. Gloria Fossi, Uffizi, Giunti, Firenze 2004. After the magistracy moved into the Uffizi, the paintings were exhibited in the gallery from 1717 onwards after the Tribunale was suppressed. In the 19th century the works were in such a poor state of conservation that only Prudence was exhibited. ==References== category:15th-century allegorical paintings category:Allegorical paintings by Italian artists Category:Paintings by Piero del Pollaiolo category:Paintings of the Uffizi category:1470 paintings ",
