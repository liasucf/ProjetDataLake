It was originally designed for a national contest to build a primary trainer but when this was won by the Rubik R-16 Lepke it was resigned to have more advanced soaring capability which could take pilots to their Silver C badge. Ninety were produced. ==Design and development== In 1948 the Hungarian National Aviation Association (Orsz\u00e1gos Magyar Rep\u00fcl\u00f6 Egyes\u00fclet or OMRE) announced a competition for single seat and two seat primary glider trainer designs. The winning single-seater was the Rubik R-16 Lepke, with Sandor Kem\u00e9ny's K-01 in second place. The following year gave Kem\u00e9ny an opportunity to build his design. So as to avoid competition with the R-16 he redesigned it into the K-02, with the help of Gy\u00f6rgy Mez\u0151 from OMRE, so that it could ridge soar even in light winds. The prototype of the K-02 Szell\u0151 was built by M\u00c1V Istv\u00e1ntelki F\u0151m\u0171hely (Istv\u00e1ntelki Workshop of the Hungarian Railways), first flying on 10 September 1949. The Szell\u0151 was an all-wood, high wing, pod and boom design. Its wing had a rectangular inner section extending out to about half span, followed by tapered outer panels with most sweep on their trailing edges. There was a single main spar with plywood ahead of it around the leading edge, forming a torsion resistant D-box. Plywood also covered the wing ahead of an internal, diagonal drag strut on each side. Elsehere the wing was fabric-covered. Broad, parallel chord Frise-type ailerons filled the trailing edges of the outer panels. The prototype used a mixture of strut and wire bracing but the latter was omitted on the production K-02b Szell\u0151. Each bracing strut ran from the bottom of the fuselage to the spar at 25% span. The prototype K-02 had no airbrakes but production K-02bs had Rubik-type brakes which had three horizontal close-spaced metal channels channels in both lower and upper brakes, each channel fitting within the next for compact retraction. The pod was based upon a strong keel bearing transverse frames and with stringers strengthening its smooth, oval cross-section, plywood skin. The pilot's open cockpit below the wing leading edge also was supported by the keel. Behind the cockpit a four-sided box converged aft to triangular frames which supported the wing spar and the tail boom, giving the rear of the pod a near vertical but slightly forward leaning edge. There was a rubber-sprung landing skid under the keel. The prototype had another, short, skid at the rear of the pod but production Szell\u0151s landed on a semi-recessed, landing wheel. The Szell\u0151's ply-covered tailboom tapered slightly in plan rearwards but maintained its depth to the tail, where it included an integral, steep- edged and round-topped fin, a low step for the strut-braced tailplane and a small tail bumper. The round-tipped tailplane was only slightly tapered, as were the elevators, which had a deep cut-out for rudder movement and a port side trim tab. Its rudder was generous, slightly angular and reached down to the tail bumper. ==Operational history== The first production Szell\u0151, built by Sport\u00e1rutermel\u0151 V., Esztergo flew on 20 August 1950. In all 89 were built and flew on into the 1960s, enabling many Hungarian glider pilots to gain their Silver-C. ==Variants== ;K-02:Sole prototype, built by M\u00c1V Istv\u00e1ntelki F\u0151m\u0171hely (Istv\u00e1ntelki Workshop of the Hungarian Railways) ;K-02b:Production model.
