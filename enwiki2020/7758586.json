    "text": "The US Bank Center is a high-rise office building located in Phoenix, Arizona. It is the second tallest building in the state of Arizona. Built in 1976, it is tall. == History == The design was released in 1973 by Thomas F. Marshall who at the time worked for the Tulsa Oklahoma firm of Kelley-Marshall & Associates. In 1974 Marshall formed his own firm of Thomas F. Marshall Associates. Associate architect was Schoenberger, Straub, Florence & Associates of Phoenix. Ground was broken in 1974 and the tower was constructed by the M. M. Sundt Construction Company of Phoenix. In 1975 when the building was about half complete the Del E. Webb Realty & Management Company a subsidiary of the Del E. Webb Corporation was named the leasing and property manager. The Webb firm also served as project manager to Sundt for the last year of construction. When it was built, it served as the headquarters for Arizona Bancwest, parent company of The Arizona Bank, which (after Arizona passed legislation allowing for interstate banking) was acquired by Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Bank in 1986 (itself in turn acquired by Bank of America in 1992). Bank of America then occupied the tower until 2000 when the Bank of America Tower was built at the Collier Center. In January 2005, this tower was renamed U.S. Bank Center and underwent a modest renovation to reflect the building's newest and largest tenant. New ground-floor restaurants were added and the building was repainted; the restaurants have since closed. The new U.S. Bank signs were installed in February 2005. The building is designed in the International Style. Above the lobby sits a seven level garage. The tower rises an additional 23 floors for a total of 31 above ground floors. The building was also the first high rise in Phoenix to be built with an automatic fire sprinkler system. == See also == * List of tallest buildings in Phoenix ==References== Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Office buildings completed in 1976 Category:Bank buildings in Arizona Category:1976 establishments in Arizona Category:International style architecture in Arizona Category:Del E.
