    "text": "Dopey Dick the Pink Whale is the 82nd animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on November 15, 1957, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== On board the Peapod, Captain Dooley enlists his crew in another attempt to get after Dopey Dick, the Pink Whale, who was often notorious for biting Dooley in the backside and tearing a hole in his seat. After the crew (not to mention the rats) desert him, he snatches Woody Woodpecker in his latest attempt to get at the whale. Dopey Dick enlists Woody to help him against Dooley, and Woody agrees to help him out. At various points, Dooley keeps getting his pants torn by Dopey Dick. His various attempts to get at the whale, and to punish Woody for siding with the whale, all end up failing. At the end, Dopey Dick destroys the Peapod, and again takes a bite out of Dooley's pants, which leaves him crying and saying \"He did it again!\" Woody laughs his trademark laugh while he is being towed on water skis by the happy Dopey Dick. ==Cast== * Grace Stafford - Woody Woodpecker * Dal McKennon - Captain Dooley ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1957\".
