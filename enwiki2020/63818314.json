    "text": "The 2015 2000 Guineas Stakes was the 207th running of the 2000 Guineas Stakes horse race. It was run over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 May 2015. With the favourite going off at 4/1, this was the most open renewal since 2007 where Adagio headed the field at the same price. Most of the winter ante-post market leaders met the starter at Newmarket - notable absentees being Faydhan, who disappointed in the Free Handicap, and Highland Reel who was diverted to France. ==Race details== * Sponsor: QIPCO * Winner's prize money: \u00a3282,841 * Going: Good to Firm * Number of runners: 18 * Winner's time: 1 minute, 37.55 seconds ==Full result== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- style=\"background:#7d7; text-align:center;\" | style=\"width:35px;\"| | style=\"width:45px;\"| Dist * | style=\"width:160px;\"| Horse | style=\"width:160px;\"| Jockey | style=\"width:190px;\"| Trainer | style=\"width:80px;\"| SP |- |1 | |Gleneagles |Ryan Moore |Aidan O'Brien |4/1 fav |- |2 |2\u00bc |Territories |Mickael Barzalona |Andr\u00e9 Fabre |5/1 |- |3 |\u00be |Ivawood |Richard Hughes |Richard Hannon, Sr. |10/1 |- |4 |\u00bd |Bossy Guest |Charles Bishop |Mick Channon |50/1 |- |5 |2 |Celestial Path |Luke Morris |Sir Mark Prescott |14/1 |- |6 |1\u00bd |Home Of The Brave |James Doyle |Hugo Palmer |25/1 |- |7 |\u00be |Dutch Connection |William Buick |Charles Hills |25/1 |- |8 |shd |Moheet |Frankie Dettori |Richard Hannon, Sr. |20/1 |- |9 |nse |Ride Like The Wind |Maxime Guyon |Freddy Head |20/1 |- |10 |\u00be |See Me Now |Daniel Tudhope |David O'Meara |100/1 |- |11 |\u00bd |Cappella Sansevero |Andrea Atzeni |Ger Lyons |40/1 |- |12 |1 |Code Red |Martin Dwyer |William Muir |100/1 |- |13 |\u00bd |Kool Kompany |Pat Dobbs |Richard Hannon, Sr. |20/1 |- |14 |1\u00bd |Estidhkaar |Paul Hanagan |Richard Hannon, Sr. |6/1 |- |15 |1 |Intilaaq |Dane O'Neill |Roger Varian |8/1 |- |16 |1 |Room Key |Jimmy Fortune (jockey) |Eve Johnson Houghton |100/1 |- |17 |6 |Glenalmond |Kieren Fallon |Karl Burke |66/1 |- |18 |27 |Ol' Man River |Joseph O'Brien |Aidan O'Brien |100/1 |} * The distances between the horses are shown in lengths or shorter \u2013 nk = neck ==Winner details== Further details of the winner, Gleneagles: * Foaled: 12 January 2012, in Ireland * Sire: Galileo; Dam: You'resothrilling (Storm Cat) * Owner: Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier & Derrick Smith * Breeder: Aidan O'Brien ==Form analysis== ===Two-year-old races=== Notable runs by the future 2000 Guineas participants as two-year-olds in 2014: * Cappella Sansevero - 1st Marble Hill Stakes, 2nd Coventry Stakes, 3rd Phoenix Stakes, 1st Round Tower Stakes * Celestial Path - 3rd Racing Post Trophy * Code Red - 1st Scott Dobson Memorial Doncaster Stakes * Dutch Connection - 1st Acomb Stakes, 3rd Vincent O'Brien National Stakes * Estidhkaar - 1st Superlative Stakes, 1st Champagne Stakes * Gleneagles - 1st Tyros Stakes, 1st Futurity Stakes, 1stVincent O'Brien National Stakes, 1st (placed 3rd) Prix Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re * Home Of The Brave - 3rd Sirenia Stakes * Ivawood - 1st July Stakes, 1st Richmond Stakes, 2nd Middle Park Stakes * Kool Kompany - 1st Rochestown Stakes, 1st Railway Stakes, 1st Prix Robert Papin, 2nd Phoenix Stakes * Ol' Man River - 1st Beresford Stakes * Room Key - 3rd Vintage Stakes * Territories - 3rd Prix La Rochette, 2nd Prix Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re ===The road to Newmarket=== Early-season appearances in 2013, prior to running in the 2000 Guineas: * Estidhkaar - 2nd Greenham Stakes * Home Of The Brave - 1st European Free Handicap * Ivawood - 3rd Greenham Stakes * Kool Kompany - 1st Craven Stakes * Moheet - 3rd Craven Stakes * Ride Like The Wind - 1st Prix Djebel * Territories - 1st Prix de Fontainebleau ===Subsequent Group 1 wins=== Group 1 / Grade I victories after running in the 2000 Guineas: * Gleneagles - Irish 2,000 Guineas (2015), St James's Palace Stakes (2015) * Territories - Prix Jean Prat (2015) ==Subsequent breeding careers== Leading progeny of participants in the 2015 2000 Guineas Stakes.
