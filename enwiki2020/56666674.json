    "text": "S\u00faper Luchas is a Spanish-language publication covering lucha libre and other forms of professional wrestling. The publication began as a print magazine in 1991 and later became the largest lucha libre magazine in the world and remained one of the few professional wrestling magazines to survive to the 2000s but now operates mainly as an online website. The website is the number one Spanish-language professional wrestling website in the world. ==History== The magazine began publication in 1991 as was published weekly. By the late 1990s it and the other magazine Box y Lucha were the only two major wrestling magazines left in publication from Mexico. Neither of the two relied on advertisements and survived mainly on money made form circulation. S\u00faper Luchas usually contained less text than Box y Lucha and featured more photographs than interviews or opinion pieces. The magazine would do photo shoots with wrestlers such as Chris Jericho when they traveled to Mexico. During the late 1990s the magazine has employed both freelance reporters who were paid per page and staff writers who were paid a salary each month. The magazine would sometimes reveal the real faces or masked luchadors.Meltzer, Dave; 2003 Wrestling Observer Newsletter - page 22 In 2010 their official site (at the time Superluchas.net) became one of the three first sites to sell Masked Republic lucha masks legally. The magazine became available for US subscribers in 2012. S\u00faper Luchas has also promoted wrestling events. ==See also== * Wrestling Observer Newsletter * WWE Magazine * List of professional wrestling magazines ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Superluchas.com, official website (in Spanish) Category:1991 establishments in Mexico Category:Lucha libre Category:Magazines established in 1991 Category:Magazines published in Mexico Category:Professional wrestling magazines Category:Spanish-language magazines Category:Spanish-language websites Category:Weekly magazines Category:Mass media in Mexico City ",
