    "text": "A tip jar is a game similar to a raffle. Players buy folded or sealed pieces of paper dealt from large glass jars in hopes of winning prizes. The pieces of paper conceal numbers or symbols that may entitle the purchaser to winnings immediately after opening the ticket. Tip jars were named at a time when the betting slips were tipped out of bags into glass jars or fish bowls. Jars are not necessarily needed. The tickets can be spread out in a pile or pinned on a board. ==References== Category:Gambling games ",
