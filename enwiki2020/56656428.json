He is Professor of Archaeological Science at the University of Oxford, UK, best known for his work in dating the Neanderthal extinction and the arrival of modern humans in Europe. == Early life and education == Higham grew up in Dunedin, New Zealand, the eldest of four children of Polly and Charles Higham; his father is an archaeologist specialising in the prehistory of southeast Asia. He studied Archaeology at the University of Otago, receiving a BA Honours degree in 1988 and a master's degree in 1990. Higham became interested in radiocarbon dating and moved to the University of Waikato where, in 1993, obtained a doctorate degree. == Career and research == Higham worked as the Deputy Director of the radiocarbon dating laboratory at Waikato, before joining the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, at the University of Oxford in 2001. He is currently the Director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU) and a Fellow of Keble College. Higham's work focuses on the development and reliable application of radiocarbon dating in archaeology. His main interests lie in the refinement of the protocols used for the purification of ancient samples prior to radiocarbon dating. His early work focused on the peopling of New Zealand. Upon arrival in Oxford, Higham became involved in testing and improving the ultrafiltration method for dating archaeological bones. In 2002, Higham met British archaeologist Roger Jacobi and the two worked closely together on the dating of several key Palaeolithic sites from the British Isles, until Jacobi's death in 2009. The most notable result of this work was the redating of the Red Lady of Paviland, an iconic early modern human from Britain. Later, Higham reported an age estimate for the Kents Cavern maxilla from Devon, England, the earliest modern human fossil in northwestern Europe. Since 2006, Higham and his team at Oxford have worked on defining the timing of Neanderthal replacement by anatomically modern humans in western Eurasia and quantifying the overlap between the two human groups. In 2014, results of this work reported in Nature placed Neanderthal extinction at around 41000\u201339000 years ago, and suggested a Neanderthal-modern human overlap of 3000\u20135000 years in Europe. In 2013, funded by the European Research Council, Higham launched the \"PalaeoChron\" Project that focuses on the dating of late Neanderthals, early modern humans and Denisovans at hundreds of sites across northern Eurasia. Higham has featured in CNN's series Finding Jesus. In 2018, Higham was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:New Zealand archaeologists Category:University of Otago alumni Category:University of Waikato alumni Category:University of Waikato faculty Category:Fellows of Keble College, Oxford Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand ",
