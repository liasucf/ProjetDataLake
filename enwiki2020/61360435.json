    "text": "is an unreleased Japanese fan film directed and produced by Shizuo Nakajima. The film stars Ema Ishihara and Shitosi Shima. ==Production== Director Shizuo Nakajima conceived the idea for the film during his employment with Toho as a production assistant. He envisioned it as a feature-length film with human drama and location shots and as a love-letter to Eiji Tsuburaya's works, however, Nakajima also drew inspiration from The Curse of the Werewolf. The team purchased materials directly from Toho and built miniature industrial factories, buildings, and a replica of the 1964 Godzilla suit. Using former Toho employees, principal photography began in 1983 and wrapped in the mid-80s, with 10 hours of raw footage completed. The film was shot on 8 mm film. Post-production has been active since the mid-80s and is currently continuing on the film. ==Release== The film has remained unreleased due to litigation from Toho (owners of Godzilla) for the unauthorized use of Godzilla. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fan films based on Godzilla Category:Unofficial adaptations Category:Werewolves in film Category:Fan films Category:Unreleased films ",
