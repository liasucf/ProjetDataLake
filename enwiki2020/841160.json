    "text": "Royal Troon Golf Club is a links golf course in Scotland, located in Troon, South Ayrshire, southwest of Glasgow. ==Founding and early years== The club, which now has a total of 45 holes, was founded in 1878, initially with five holes. It lies adjacent to the Firth of Clyde. George Strath was appointed in 1881 as the club's first golf professional, and together with 1882 Open champion Willie Fernie (golfer), designed the original course, expanding it to 18 holes by 1888. World Atlas of Golf, 2012 edition, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., London, , pp. 58\u201359 The two were assisted by Charlie Hunter, greenskeeper of the neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club, in Troon's formative years. When Strath left the Club's employ in 1887, Fernie became head professional, and served in that role until his death in 1924. He laid out the club's original Portland Course as well; this course was named in honour of the 6th Duke of Portland, an essential early Troon Golf Club patron and facilitator, who was one of the region's largest landowners. The Club's property lies between the Firth of Clyde on the west, a caravan park on the south (slightly further south lies Prestwick Golf Club), the railway line and main road on the east, and the town of Troon on the north. Glasgow Prestwick Airport is located slightly to the south and east of the club, and low-flying aircraft are nearest its southern section. ==Redesigned for first Open Championship== Just prior to Royal Troon hosting its first Open Championship in 1923, the Old Course was redesigned, lengthened, and strengthened by James Braid, a five-time Open champion, one of the era's top architects, and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Other than having new back tees on several holes, the current Old Course is essentially very similar to Braid's finished work. ==Awarded 'Royal' designation== Troon was granted its \"Royal\" designation in 1978, during its centenary. Its clubhouse is richly decorated with historical golf artifacts. James Montgomerie, father of Colin Montgomerie, served as Secretary in the 1980s. ==Ten-time host of The Open Championship== Its Old Course is one of the host courses for The Open Championship, one of the major championships on the PGA Tour and European Tour. The Club most recently hosted in 2016 and will host the 2024 for a tenth time. ==Past Open champions== Past Open champions at Royal Troon include Justin Leonard, Mark Calcavecchia, Tom Watson, Tom Weiskopf, Arnold Palmer, Bobby Locke, and Arthur Havers. Six consecutive Opens at Troon were won by Americans, from 1962 through 2004, ended by Henrik Stenson of Sweden in 2016. ==Noteworthy characteristics== ===Seaside opening=== The Old Course begins alongside the sea, running southwards in a line for the first six holes. This opening section offers full visibility and plenty of space, but does still require accuracy to avoid deep bunkers. Many good rounds have been fashioned through low scores here, often aided by prevailing downwind conditions. ===Rise in complexity=== Beginning with the seventh, the Old Course turns further inland, while simultaneously changing direction, on each of its next six holes, among hillier dunes and thicker vegetation, including gorse and whins, to severely punish offline shots. This sector, with two blind tee shots on the tenth and 11th, marks a sharp rise in difficulty from the opening holes. ===Long finish=== With the 13th hole, the player turns northwards for a long, very stern finish, running parallel to the opening stretch. This comprises three long par 4s, two tough par 3s, and a challenging par 5 (the 16th) with its fairway bisected at the halfway point by a ditch, which can only very rarely be carried from the tee. The player very often has to face a strong prevailing wind. ===Famous holes=== Royal Troon is home to both the longest and shortest holes in Open Championship golf. Regarded as one of the top holes in the world, the par-3 8th hole (\"Postage Stamp\") measures a scant , but its diminutive green measures a mere . Two holes earlier, the par-5 6th (\"Turnberry\") extends to a lengthy . The 11th hole (\"The Railway\") is one of the most difficult holes in major championship golf. Now a long par-4, a blind tee shot has a long carry over gorse with out of bounds all along the railway on the right. The lengthy approach shot is to a small green that falls away, with nearby out of bounds. ==Votes to admit women as members== On 1 July 2016, Royal Troon members voted overwhelmingly to admit women into the club as members, avoiding a potential controversy that could have overshadowed the 2016 Open Championship and the club being removed from the Open rota. ==The Portland and Craigend Courses== The Old Course is the championship layout at Royal Troon. Its second course, the Portland, also an 18-hole layout from 1895, but significantly shorter than the Old Course, was redesigned in 1921 by golf course architect Dr. Alister MacKenzie, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. The Portland is also of very high standard. It is located slightly further inland and further north than the Old Course, with no holes bordering the Firth of Clyde; it has its own clubhouse. The Craigend Course is a nine- hole par-3 course. The Club is private; guests are allowed at certain times, under advance booking, with a handicap certificate establishing proficiency. The Old Course has four tees \u2013 \"Ladies\", \"Short\", \"Medal\" and \"Championship\". ==Layout== For 2016 Open Championship: {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align:center\" !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par |- |1||align=left|Seal||367||4||rowspan=10 style=\"background:#E6E8FA;\"| ||10||align=left|Sandhills||451||4 |- |2||align=left|Black Rock||390||4||11||align=left|The Railway||482||4 |- |3||align=left|Gyaws||377||4||12||align=left|The Fox||430||4 |- |4||align=left|Dunure||555||5||13||align=left|Burmah||473||4 |- |5||align=left|Greenan||209||3||14||align=left|Alton||178||3 |- |6||align=left|Turnberry||601||5||15||align=left|Crosbie||499||4 |- |7||align=left|Tel-el-Kebir||401||4||16||align=left|Well||554||5 |- |8||align=left|Postage Stamp||123||3||17||align=left|Rabbit||220||3 |- |9||align=left|The Monk||422||4||18||align=left|Craigend||458||4 |- | colspan=2|Out||3,445||36|| colspan=2|In||3,745||35 |- |colspan=5 align=left|Source: ||colspan=2|Total ||7,190||71 |} Lengths of the course for previous Opens (since 1950): * 2004: , par 71 * 1997: , par 71 * 1989: , par 72 * 1982: , par 72 * 1973: , par 72 * 1962: , par 72 * 1950: , par 70 Opens from 1962 through 1989 played the 11th hole as a par-5. ==The Open Championship== The Open Championship has been held at Troon on nine occasions: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=2|Year!!rowspan=2|Winner!!colspan=5|Score!!rowspan=2|Winner's share (\u00a3) |- !
