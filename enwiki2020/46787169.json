    "text": "Marques'Almeida is a British fashion label which debuted in 2011. The label was founded by Portuguese designers Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, who met while they were both students at Central Saint Martins in London. The two are currently married. The brand is known for the creative use of denim. Style.com credited the label with helping launch the revival of distressed denim in the 2010s. However, the brand's focus is actually on high-end women's wear, and despite being renowned for their innovative denim garments, they didn't include jeans in their collection until 2015. In 2015, the label won the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, the largest cash prize for a new brand in fashion. The brand is sold through their own E-commerce site, as well as many fashion e-commerce giants such as SSENSE, Net-a-Porter, and Matches Fashion. ==References== Category:2011 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Companies established in 2011 Category:Clothing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Portuguese fashion designers ",
