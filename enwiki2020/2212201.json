    "text": "Sir Victor Alexander Brooke, 3rd Baronet (5 January 1843 \u2013 27 November 1891), was an Anglo-Irish naturalist and baronet. He was the father of Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Alanbrooke, and grandfather of The 1st Viscount Brookeborough, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. ==Life== Brooke was the son of Sir Arthur Brooke, 2nd Baronet, an Ulster aristocrat from County Fermanagh in the north of Ireland and succeeded to his title and the Colebrooke Estate in 1854. He studied at Harrow and then traveled abroad, being a keen sportsman who enjoyed big game hunting. Brooke's proposed work on antelopes remained unfinished at his death. The plates by Joseph Smit and Joseph Wolf were later reused in Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas's The Book of Antelopes (1894-1900). He was a magistrate, deputy lieutenant and Sheriff of Fermanagh. ==Personal life== He married Alice Sophia, daughter of Sir Alan Edward Bellingham, 3rd Baronet, in 1864. After their marriage they settled at a villa in Pau, France, where they had at least six children. The youngest was Alan - later Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Alanbrooke. One grandson was The 1st Viscount Brookeborough, the third Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Brooke died of pneumonia in Pau in November 1891, aged 48, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Arthur. Lady Brooke died in July 1920. ==References== *www.thepeerage.com * Category:1843 births Category:People educated at Harrow School Brooke, Victor Alexander, 3rd Baronet Category:British naturalists Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Fermanagh Category:High Sheriffs of County Fermanagh Category:1891 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia ",
