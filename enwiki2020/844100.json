    "text": "David Colbreth Broderick (February 4, 1820 \u2013 September 16, 1859) was an attorney and politician, elected by the legislature as Democratic U.S. Senator from California. Born in Washington, DC, to Irish immigrant parents, he lived in New York until moving to California during the Gold Rush. He was a first cousin of politicians Andrew Kennedy of Indiana and Case Broderick of Kansas. ==Early years== Broderick was born in 1820 in Washington, D.C., on East Capitol Street just west of 3rd Street. He was the son of an Irish stonecutter and his wife. His father had come to the United States in order to work on the United States Capitol. In 1823 Broderick moved with his parents to New York City. There he attended public schools and was apprenticed to a stonecutter. ==Political career== Broderick became active in politics as a young man, joining the Democratic Party. In 1846, he was the Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative from New York's 5th congressional district, but lost the election to Whig candidate Frederick A. Tallmadge, who gained 42% of the vote to Broderick's 38%. ==Mining career== In 1849, Broderick joined the California Gold Rush. He moved to San Francisco, where he engaged in smelting and assaying gold. Broderick minted gold coins that contained less gold than their face value, keeping the difference. His $10 coins, for example, contained $8 in gold. He used the profits to finance his political aspirations. ==State Senate career== Broderick was a member of the California State Senate from 1850 to 1852, serving as its president from 1851 to 1852. Broderick was acting Lieutenant Governor from January 9, 1851 to January 8, 1852, following incumbent John McDougall's succession to the governorship. From then on, Broderick effectively had political control of San Francisco, which under his \"utterly vicious\"Young, John P. San Francisco, a History of the Pacific Coast Metropolis Volume 1, 1912, page 214. rule soon became notorious for municipal corruption.Asbury, Herbert. The Barbary Coast. New York, 1933. Chapter 4. > From the middle of 1851 to his death, in 1859, Broderick was, for all > practical purposes, in absolute control of San Francisco's political > machinery. ... And not even his most adoring worshippers have been able > entirely to conceal the plain fact that in the final analysis he must, more > than any one man, shoulder responsibility for the municipal corruption which > was the basic cause of the second uprising of a tormented and enraged > citizenry. In the words of his biographer Jeremiah Lynch:Lynch, Jeremiah. A Senator of the Fifties: David C. Broderick of California, 1911, pages 68-69. Broderick became rich from this system.Asbury, Herbert. The Barbary Coast. New York, 1933. Chapter 4. > Broderick's political income from these and other sources was probably > several hundred thousand dollars a year, and with such sums at his disposal > he not only maintained his hold upon the city but furthered his ambition to > be United States Senator, despite the slashing onslaughts of several of the > newspapers. In 1856 Broderick was elected by the state legislature for a seat as US Senator from California. (Popular election of senators did not start until the 20th century.) Broderick began his term on March 4, 1857. ==Feud and death== Broderick as a US Senator from California, photographed by Mathew Brady. At that time, just prior to the start of the American Civil War, the Democratic Party of California was divided between pro-slavery and \"Free Soil\" factions. Broderick led the Free Soilers. One of his closest friends was David S. Terry, formerly the Chief Justice of the California State Supreme Court. He advocated extending slavery into California. Terry lost his re-election bid because of his pro-slavery platform, and he blamed Broderick for the loss. Terry, considered even by his friends as caustic and aggressive,Richards, Leondard. The California Gold Rush and the Coming of the Civil War, \"Prologue,\" pg. 2, 2008 made some inflammatory remarks at a party convention in Sacramento, which Broderick read. He took offense, and sent Terry an equally vitriolic reply, describing: > Terry to be a \"damned miserable wretch\" who was as corrupt as President > James Buchanan and William Gwin, California's other senator. \"I have > hitherto spoken of him as an honest man\u2014as the only honest man on the bench > of a miserable, corrupt Supreme Court\u2014but now I find I was mistaken. I take > it all back. He is just as bad as the others.\"Richards, Leonard. The > California Gold Rush and the Coming of the Civil War, \"Prologue,\" pg. 3, > 2008 Passions escalated; on September 13, 1859, former friends Terry and Broderick, both expert marksmen, met outside of San Francisco city limits at Lake Merced for a duel. The pistols chosen for the duel had hair triggers, and Broderick's discharged prior to the final \"1-2-3\" count, firing prematurely into the ground. Thus disarmed, he was forced to stand as Terry shot him in the right lung. Terry at first believed the shot to be only a flesh wound, but it proved to be fatal. Broderick died three days later, and was buried under a monument erected by the state in Lone Mountain Cemetery in San Francisco. In 1942 he was reinterred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma. ==Legacy== Edward Dickinson Baker, a close friend of Abraham Lincoln, spoke at Broderick's funeral. He expressed the widely held belief that Broderick was killed because of his anti-slavery stance: > His death was a political necessity, poorly veiled beneath the guise of a > private quarrel. . .What was his public crime? The answer is in his own > words; \"I die because I was opposed to a corrupt administration and the > extension of slavery.\"Richards, Leonard. The California Gold Rush and the > Coming of the Civil War Prologue, pg. 4, 2008 Some maintain that in his death Broderick became a martyr to the anti-slavery cause, and the episode was part of a national spiral towards civil war. At the Republican National Convention in Chicago in May 1860, a portrait of the late Senator Broderick was hung. About thirty years later, Terry was shot to death by Deputy United States Marshal David Neagle while threatening Supreme Court Justice Stephen Johnson Field, a friend of Broderick. Broderick County, Kansas Territory was named for the senator. The former town of Broderick, California, and Broderick Street in San Francisco were also named in his honor. In 1963, Carroll O'Connor was cast as Broderick, with Brad Dexter as Justice Terry, in \"A Gun Is Not a Gentleman\" on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Terry mortally wounded Senator Broderick in 1859. Though past allies as Democrats, Terry, a defender of slavery, challenged the anti-slavery Broderick to a duel. ==See also== *List of United States Congress members killed or wounded in office *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1790\u20131899) ==References== ==Further reading== Retrieved on 2008-01-14 * Arthur Quinn, The Rivals: William Gwin, David Broderick, and the Birth of California, (Crown Publishers, Inc.: The Library of the American West, New York, 1994), (1997 reprint: ) ==External links== * * * Obituary for Broderick in California Police Gazette Category:1820 births Category:1859 deaths Category:People from Washington, D.C.
