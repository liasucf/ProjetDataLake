    "text": "Truth is a 2015 American historical political drama film written and directed by James Vanderbilt in his directorial debut. It is based on American television news producer Mary Mapes's memoir Truth and Duty: The Press, the President and the Privilege of Power. The film focuses on the Killian documents controversy, and the resulting last days of news anchor Dan Rather and producer Mary Mapes at CBS News. It stars Cate Blanchett as Mapes and Robert Redford as Rather. Truth had its world premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film received a limited release in the United States on October 16, 2015, before being released nationwide on October 30, 2015, by Sony Pictures Classics. ==Plot== In the months before the US 2004 presidential election, Mary Mapes (producer of the primetime news program 60 Minutes Wednesday) and her crew consisting of Mike Smith (Grace), Lucy Scott (Moss), and Colonel Roger Charles (Quaid) are seeking evidence to verify whether or not George W. Bush received any preferential treatment during his time in the military. Charles, knowing that the military \"is good at what they do,\" believes there were no mistakes or errors, despite some claims that Bush's records were lost or altered, and that Bush had difficulty meeting minimal physical aptitude testing. Seeking leads, Mapes and her crew eventually find Bill Burkett, who says he has hard evidence in the form of memos and letters dictating that Bush did indeed have preferential treatment. Mapes produces a story that Dan Rather reports on 60 Minutes. After the airing, Mapes and Rather face questions over the accuracy of the segment. The authenticity of the documents on which the allegations are based is called into question. Some believe the documents are forgeries. The controversy is amplified by radio hosts, bloggers and mainstream media sources, The Washington Post, and by CBS itself. Certain characteristics of the memos, such as their font and letter spacing, indicate they were created on a computer using Microsoft Word, and therefore could not have been typed on a typewriter in the early 1970s.Truth movie review, RogerEbert.com, October 16, 2015.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Truth has a 63% approval rating based on reviews from 178 critics, with an average rating of 6.16 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Truths terrific cast and compelling message are often enough to overcome its occasionally didactic and facile dramatization of a nuanced real-life tale.\" On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com praised Blanchett and Redford's performances, but said the characters act as mouthpieces for Vanderbilt's political views. ===Response from Dan Rather=== Dan Rather praised Truth noting that, \"there's so much right in the film ... I think it's the best thing that's ever been up on the big screen about how television news really works, the reporting side of it: the telephone calls, wearing out the shoe leather going to see people, developing sources.\" He also commended Redford's portrayal of him as Redford \"did not, which I appreciated very much, try to imitate. He tried to get some essence of me as a person and as a professional.\" ===Response from CBS=== In September 2015, a source close to the film said CBS president and CEO Leslie Moonves did not approve of the film, but did not ask producers for major changes. A source at CBS said it was not planning on publicly condemning the film. In October, Gil Schwartz, the chief spokesman for CBS, who is depicted in the film, said \"It's astounding how little truth there is in Truth. There are, in fact, too many distortions, evasions and baseless conspiracy theories to enumerate them all. The film tries to turn gross errors of journalism and judgment into acts of heroism and martyrdom.\" Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News at the time of the incidents and depicted in the film, said he had not seen the film, but knew its story and was outraged at its portrayals, adding that \"only Hollywood could come up with that.\" CBS refused to advertise the film because of the movie's \"inaccuracies and distortions\" which would offend CBS News employees. Some at CBS News are \"angered\" with the film's implication that news executives were pressured to revoke the story by corporate owner Viacom, which \"had business reasons to maintain friendly relations with the Bush administration.\" In a statement, the film's producers stated, \"Although we understand CBS wants to put this episode behind them, it's disappointing that they seem to be so concerned about our film \u2026 The events depicted in Truth are still vigorously debated, and that's a good thing\". Brad Fischer, one of the producers, said that a negative response from CBS was not unexpected, but what was surprising is the \"tone and the emotional nature\" of the response. He said that the filmmakers were \"attracted by the intersection of news, politics and business and the story's status as one of the first to be undone by an Internet outcry\" and that he hopes people \"talk about the issues and ask the questions themselves...I don't think it's our job as filmmakers to draw a conclusion, but rather to pose the questions.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American political drama films Category:Biographical films about journalists Category:CBS News Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Brian Tyler Category:Films about George W.
