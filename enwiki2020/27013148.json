The film throws light on the struggles led by the students against bribery and bureaucracy. The movie is produced under the banner of Souparnika Visual Media. It has since gained a cult following because of its terrible script and bizarre dialogues. ==Plot== Chaverpada tells the story of a group of engineering college students Ameer (Manikuttan), Abhimanyu (Arun), Vivek (Vivek) and Tony (Tony) who have developed a means of their own to voice their protests against the ills that have gripped today's society. The testing phase of a software that they have developed causes unexpected jams in the traffic signals as well as the wireless system of the city. The youngsters realize that they are in trouble when the cops find out more about the incident. Police moved to the college to arrest them. However, they are kidnapped by the terrorists before the cops could lay their hands on them. Visal Sabhapathi (Bala), the leader of the N. S. G. Commando wing, is soon called in to look into the case and rescue the students. ==Cast== *Bala as Visal Sabhapathy *Krishnaprasad as Suryanarayanan Potti/Badusha Khan *Manikuttan as Ameer *Muktha as Gopika *Arun as Abhimanyu *Tony as Tony *Vivek as Vivek *Kochupreman *Sudhi *Pawan *Johnson *Ajay Nataraj ==References== ==External links== * http://bollywoodcinemagallery.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/chaverpada/ * http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/malayalam/preview/12171.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20120407115247/http://popcorn.oneindia.in/title/8674/chaverpada.html * http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/7296/malayalam/chaverpada/index.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20101217075318/http://www.mallumovies.org/movie/chaverpada Category:Indian films Category:2010s Malayalam-language films ",
