    "text": "Everyone Says I Love You is a 1996 American musical comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen, who also stars alongside Julia Roberts, Alan Alda, Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore, Gaby Hoffmann, Tim Roth, Goldie Hawn, Natasha Lyonne and Natalie Portman. Set in New York City, Venice and Paris, the film features singing by actors not usually known for their singing. Everyone Says I Love You did not do well commercially, but is among the more critically successful of Allen's later films, with Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert even ranking it as one of Allen's best. ==Plot== The emotions of an extended upper-class family in Manhattan are followed in song from NY to Paris and Venice. Various friends, lovers, acquaintances, and relatives act, interact, and sing, in the three cities. These people include young lovers Holden and Skylar in Manhattan; Skylar's parents, Bob and Steffi; Joe, an ex-husband of Steffi; DJ, a daughter from the marriage of Joe and Steffi; Von, a lady whom Joe meets in Venice; and a recently released prison inmate, Charles Ferry, who is inserted between Skyler and Holden, resulting in their breakup. ==Cast== * Natasha Lyonne as Djuna \"D.J.\" Berlin * Alan Alda as Bob Dandridge * Woody Allen as Joe Berlin * Drew Barrymore as Skylar Dandridge (singing voice dubbed by Olivia Hayman) * Lukas Haas as Scott Dandridge * Goldie Hawn as Steffi Dandridge * Gaby Hoffmann as Lane Dandridge * Edward Norton as Holden Spence * Natalie Portman as Laura Dandridge * Julia Roberts as Von Sidell * Tim Roth as Charles Ferry * David Ogden Stiers as Arnold Spence * Itzhak Perlman as himself * Edward Hibbert as a Harry Winston Salesman * Patrick Cranshaw as Grandpa * Billy Crudup as Ken Risley * Robert Knepper as Greg * Scotty Bloch as Lynn Spence * Isiah Whitlock as Cop * Kevin Hagan as Doorman * Navah Perlman as Pianist * Waltrudis Buck as Psychiatrist * Christy Carlson Romano as a Trick or Treat Child * Arlene Martell as a Nurse * Helen Miles Singers: Helen Miles, Arlene Martell, Emily Bindiger, Cindy Cobitt, Al Dana, Kevin DeSimone, Paul Evans, Chrissy Faith, Jeff Lyons, Michael Mark, Jenna Miles, Robert Ragaini, Lenny Roberts, Annette Sanders, Terry Textor, Vaneese Thomas and Ashley H.

Her voice was dubbed by Allen regular Olivia Hayman. The title song was written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, and was used as a recurring theme song in the Marx Brothers movie Horse Feathers (1932). Allen is a well-known Groucho Marx fan. Marx's theme song from Animal Crackers (1930) \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" is featured, sung in French by a chorus of Groucho Marx's. Songs, film score, and subsequent album recorded, mixed, and co-produced with Dick Hyman by Roy Yokelson. ==Release== ===Box office=== The film was released theatrically in North America on December 8, 1996 on three screens. Its opening weekend gross was $131,678 ($43,892 per screen). It ended its North American run with $9,759,200. ===Critical reception=== The film was well received. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 79% \"fresh\" rating, based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's consensus states: \"A likable, infectious musical, Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You is sometimes uneven but always toe-tapping and fun.\" Janet Maslin wrote a strongly positive review in the New York Times, describing the film as \"a delightful and witty compendium of the film maker's favorite things.\"\"When Everyone Sings, Just for the Joy of It\", Janet Maslin, The New York Times, December 6, 1996. Among the film's strongest detractors was Jonathan Rosenbaum, who described it as \"creepy\" and claimed \"this characterless world of Manhattan-Venice-Paris, where love consists only of self-validation, and political convictions of any kind are attributable to either hypocrisy or a brain condition, the me-first nihilism of Allen's frightened worldview is finally given full exposure, and it's a grisly thing to behold.\" ==Awards== The film was nominated for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 54th Golden Globe Awards. ==References== ==External links== * * Everyone Says I Love You at Virtual History Category:1996 films Category:1990s musical comedy films Category:1996 romantic comedy films Category:1990s romantic musical films Category:American films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American romantic musical films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Woody Allen Category:Films produced by Robert Greenhut Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in Venice Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Jukebox musical films Category:Miramax films Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen Category:Cultural depictions of the Marx Brothers Category:1996 comedy films ",
