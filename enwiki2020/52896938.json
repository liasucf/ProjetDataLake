The gang at the park cheer him up by throwing him a party. In order to remember the events, all of their memories are put onto a collection of Blu- rays and buried in the park. They set a course to the location of the fight, Lolliland, Pops' home planet. ===Part 1=== The park crew arrives at Lolliland, the birthplace of Pops and Anti-Pops. They meet a group of Lolliland natives: Frivola-Kranus, Quadravi-Kranus and Weird Mushroom Guy. The natives explain Pops and Anti-Pops are really named Mega-Kranus and Malum-Kranus, respectively. The natives show the park crew ancient tapestries of the previous battles between Pops and Anti-Pops, which detail prior incarnations of the park crew fighting alongside Pops. Knowing that all of the prior battles have ended in a stalemate (resulting in the universe resetting), Mordecai comes up with the plan of setting traps for Anti-Pops to give Pops an upper hand which he didn't have in previous battles. After Anti-Pops arrives in an Uber-like taxi, Pops tries to convince him not to fight due to them being brothers. Anti-Pops refuses, and attacks Pops, but is caught in the traps laid by the park crew. The victory is short-lived however, as Anti-Pops easily escapes the traps. ===Part 2=== To ensure the survival of his friends, Pops makes a deal with Anti-Pops: whoever lands the first blow in battle gets to decide the fate of the universe. Pops successfully injures Anti-Pops, but Anti-Pops breaks the deal and continues the fight. Meanwhile, the park crew, HD DVD, Blu-ray, the Baby Ducks, Toothpick Sally, Recap Robot, Chance Sureshot (whose prior \"death\" is revealed to be that of a clone), the Guardians of Eternal Youth, Gary, Carter and Briggs, Party Horse 42699, and the Guardian of Lolliland fight against Anti-Pops's minions and Streaming Modem and defeat them. However, Anti-Pops unlocks his full power and begins erasing Lolliland. The erasing of all of Pops's allies and friends (with the exception of Mordecai and Rigby) causes him to unlock his own full power. Mordecai and Rigby watch in awe as the two brothers' punches collide, obliterating the entire universe and resetting time. ===Part 3: \"The Power\"=== Part 3 begins exactly like the first episode of Season 1, \"The Power\", seemingly \"resetting\" time back to the beginning of the series. However, Rigby quickly remembers the events of the prior episodes and the rest of the series. Rigby shows Mordecai the stash of buried Blu-rays, which triggers his memories of the series' events after touching it. Realizing that time didn't properly reset, they use the Power to take them to the future, and back to the battle between Pops and Anti-Pops. Anti-Pops attacks them, destroying the Power in the process. As Pops continues to fight, it becomes clear that fighting Anti-Pops will inevitably lead to another stalemate. Pops grabs Anti-Pops and flies toward the sun, telepathically comforting Mordecai and Rigby. Anti-Pops reconciles with his brother, and the two finally at peace before they fly into the sun. With the resetting cycle broke, the erased park gang (and allies) are revived. After three years in space, the park's dome is flown back to Earth, where they reunite with friends and family and are welcomed as heroes. The park workers and Mr. Maellard erect a memorial statue in honor of Pops and mourn him. After six years of working at the park, Mordecai and Rigby quit their jobs and move on with their lives. Mordecai becomes a successful artist, marries a bat named Stef, and has three children with her. Rigby marries Eileen and has three children as well. Muscle Man and Starla move into a trailer in the park and has many children, who adopt many of his mannerisms (like taking off their shirts and yelling). High-Five Ghost and his girlfriend, Celia, become party DJs touring in Prague and later have a son. Benson, who now becomes the owner of the park after Mr. Maellard passes on, reunites with Pam and the two adopt four cats along with Applesauce, Benson's pig. Skips continues happily working in the park, but ditches his trademark jeans for jean shorts. At their 25th anniversary reunion, the park crew raises a statue of Mr. Maellard next to the one of Pops and take a picture in front of it with their families. As the reunion party commences, a now middle aged Mordecai and Rigby reminisce on the sacrifice of Pops and how none of them would have been able to lead such wonderful lives without him. They decide to play some old arcade games before laughing at how immature they used to be. This episode ends with the revelation that Pops is watching his friends in what seems to be an afterlife on a VHS tape labeled \"Regular Show\". He ejects the tape and says \"Jolly good show\" as the series officially ends set to the 1977 David Bowie song \"Heroes\". ==Broadcast== The episode premiered on Cartoon Network on January 16, 2017, at 6:00pm ET/PT. It was viewed by 1.33 million viewers in part one and 1.37 million viewers in part two, making it the most watched episode of the eighth season. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Regular Show episodes Category:2017 American television episodes Category:2010s American television specials Category:American television series finales ",
