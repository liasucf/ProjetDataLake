It rises to about 300 metres above sea level and is not open to the public. It is covered in remnant bushland and is easily visible from Saddleback Mountain. It is named after an early settlement on the banks of the Shoalhaven known as Coolangatta and is only indirectly related to the better-known Coolangatta, Queensland. ==References== ==External links== Category:Mountains of New South Wales Category:South Coast (New South Wales) ",
