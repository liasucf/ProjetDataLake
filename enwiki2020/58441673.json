    "text": "Gregory from the kindred P\u00e9c (; died after 1296/1309) was a Hungarian baron and soldier in the 13th century, who served as Judge royal in 1288. He was a forefather of the late medieval powerful Marcali family. ==Family== Gregory was born in the first half of the 1240s. He originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) P\u00e9c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was the eldest son of Mark I, who appeared in contemporary documents in the period between 1240 and 1245. Gregory had four younger brothers, Mark II, Stephen, Lucas III and Apor.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) Stephen was the ancestor of the Berzencei (or Musinai) family and its cadet branches, the Lor\u00e1ntfis and S\u00e1ndorfis.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 3. Berzencei [Musinai] branch) Lucas was isp\u00e1n of Zala County, while Apor was considered an influential baron at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. Their cousin was Denis, the most notable member of the clan. Gregory had a son Joachim from his marriage to an unidentified noble lady. Joachim was referred by written records from 1311 to 1321. His castle at Szentgy\u00f6rgy (also called B\u00e9kav\u00e1r, lit. \"Frog's Castle\") was besieged and captured by Andrew K\u0151szegi around 1315. Through his only grandson Stephen, Gregory was the forefather of the powerful Marcali family, which became prominent in the 15th century. The family died out in 1487.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 2. Marcali branch) ==Career== Gregory is first mentioned by a royal charter in 1266, which refers to him as isp\u00e1n of Rojcsa (today Rovi\u0161\u0107e, Croatia), which laid in the territory of Kri\u017eevci (K\u0151r\u00f6s) County and belonged to the dominion of B\u00e9la, Duke of Slavonia. In this capacity, he participated in the Bulgarian campaign, which took place in that year. When Duke Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria, taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, they crossed the Danube in 1265 and raided the Hungarian fortresses north of the river which belonged to Stephen's realm. In response, after B\u00e9la IV and his son Stephen signed the peace treaty on the Rabbits' Island, the rex junior, with the limited support of B\u00e9la's royal army, invaded Bulgaria in the summer of 1266. The main army seized Vidin, Pleven and other forts, while another army commanded by Gregory P\u00e9c routed the Bulgarians in Vrchov (or Vracsa). In the same time, Egyed Monoszl\u00f3 led Stephen's army to successfully besiege and capture Tirnovo, also plundering the surrounding areas. Historian Attila Zsoldos considers the intention behind the appointment of the young Gregory as leader of one of the involving armies was to give him opportunity to demonstrate his military skills. Duke Stephen, a talented military leader, has been trying to build personal relationships with those noblemen, who arrived to Bulgaria from his father B\u00e9la's dominion. His political career reached its peak during the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary, whose rule was characterized by feudal anarchy, when many groupings of barons \u2014 primarily the Cs\u00e1ks, K\u0151szegis, and Gutkeleds \u2014 fought against each other for supreme power. When B\u00e9la of Macs\u00f3 was murdered by Henry K\u0151szegi and his soldiers following a sharp dispute around 15 November 1272, his province, the Duchy of Macs\u00f3 was divided among the members of the leading noble families. Gregory P\u00e9c became Ban of Barancs and Kucs\u00f3 (present- day Brani\u010devo and Ku\u010devo in east-central Serbia, respectively), first mentioned in this capacity on 27 November. He still held both dignities on 14 May 1273. However, both banates proved to be short-lived administrative units. He was succeeded by Stephen, son of Tekesh as Ban of Kucs\u00f3 in 1279, while the region of Brani\u010devo was ruled by two Bulgarian nobles, brothers Darman and Kudelin shortly after Gregory's last appearance as ban. Gregory fought against the troops of Ottokar II of Bohemia, who invaded the borderlands of Hungary in April 1273. He participated in numerous clashes against the Moravian army alongside his kinsmen, Denis and Benedict. Gregory served as isp\u00e1n of Somogy County from June to September/December 1275. He regained the office around July 1276, holding the position until the same month of the next year. He functioned as judge royal around September 1288, during the last regnal years of Ladislaus IV. It is possible that he held the dignity until the next year, when he was succeeded by Amadeus Aba. Following Ladislaus' assassination in 1290, Gregory was considered a confidant of Andrew III of Hungary. His inherited and acquired lands laid in the borderland of domains of two oligarchic powers, the Cs\u00e1ks and the K\u0151szegi family, thus his political, social and financial status were constantly at risk. It is plausible that he built the castle of Szentgy\u00f6rgy in order to protect his landholdings against the K\u0151szegis. He was made isp\u00e1n of Bars and Nyitra counties in 1291 to represent the royal power in the dominion of the Cs\u00e1k clan. When Andrew III and Albert of Austria jointly invaded the K\u0151szegis' lands and their main fort at K\u0151szeg in August 1296, Gregory participated in the military campaign. This is the last relevant information about him. Following Andrew's death in 1301, he retired from public life, if he was still alive at all. According to a non- authentic charter dated July 1309 (in fact it was written a century later), he acted as an arbiter in a lawsuit between the Tengerdis and the Somogyv\u00e1r Abbey. == References == == Sources == * * * * Category:1240s births Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:Medieval Hungarian military leaders Category:Judges royal Category:Bans (title) Gregory Category:Year of death unknown ",
