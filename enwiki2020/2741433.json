    "text": "Religion is one of many recurring themes on the American animated television series The Simpsons. Much of the series' religious humor satirizes aspects of Christianity and religion in general. However, some episodes, such as \"Bart Sells His Soul\" and \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\", can be interpreted as having a spiritual theme. The show has been both praised and criticized by atheists, agnostics, liberals, conservatives and religious people in general for its portrayal of faith and religion in society. The show can function as a mediator of biblical literacy among younger generations of irreligious viewers. In the series, the Simpson family attends services led by Reverend Lovejoy. The church's denomination is identified as the \"Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism\" in the episode \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star.\" This is generally interpreted as representing the multitude of American Protestant traditions in general and not one specific denomination. ==Analysis== Although The Simpsons often mocks religion, it has received support from some groups claiming to be religious. In a 2001 article for The Christian Century, John Dart argued that > \"[T]he enormous popularity of The Simpsons, now in its 12th television > season, suggests that religious people have a sense of humor \u2014 contrary to > the usual wisdom in Hollywood. The program takes more satirical jabs at > spiritual matters than any other TV show, yet the erratic cartoon family has > an appreciative audience among many people of faith and among many analysts > of religion. The reason? Perhaps it\u2019s because The Simpsons is an equal- > opportunity satire: it shrewdly targets all sorts of foibles and > hypocrisies, not just religious ones. Perhaps it\u2019s also because the show is > exceptionally aware of the significant place religion has in the American > landscape.\" The February 5, 2001 edition of Billy Graham's Christianity Today, titled Saint Flanders, featured Ned Flanders, Homer, and Marge on the cover and described Flanders as \"the most visible evangelical to many Americans.\" In one of the issue's articles, Dart argued, among other things, that \"At home, the less devout are probably tuned to the competition, Touched by an Angel.\" In July 2007, Christianity Today film reviewer Russ Breimeier gave The Simpsons Movie a positive review, stating \"Most television shows don't translate well to the big screen, and that's especially true for 15- or 30-minute cartoons that don't have the depth or nuance to expand into feature length. But The Simpsons, with its broad range of slapstick and satire, effortlessly stretches to four times the usual length of a 22-minute episode, yielding one of the most successful television-to-cinema transplants I've ever seen: \"Best \u2026 feature-length \u2026 episode \u2026 ever\" and that \"If you agree that The Simpsons has soured somewhat over the last five years, fear not. The Simpsons Movie reunites several of the veterans responsible for the golden age of the series, including creator Matt Groening, director David Silverman (Monsters, Inc.), and contributing writers James L. Brooks, Al Jean, John Swartzwelder, David Mirkin, Ian-Maxtone-Graham, among others\u2014eleven writers, four consultants.\" On December 2009, an article published in L'Osservatore Romano, the Holy See's official newspaper, praised The Simpsons for its \"realistic\" way of dealing with religion. \"Homer finds in God his last refuge, even though he sometimes gets His name sensationally wrong. But these are just minor mistakes, after all; the two know each other well\", the article said.\"Vatican praises 'The Simpsons'\". Business Standard. December 26, 2009. The Simpson family is often seen attending church, a practice described by Dart as \"rarely seen or mentioned in other TV shows.\" Simpsons creator Matt Groening has also stated that The Simpsons is one of the few shows on television where the family attends church regularly. The characters in the family are often seen praying. William Romanowski, author of the book Pop Culture Wars: Religion and the Role of Entertainment in American Life, noted that \"The Simpsons is not dismissive of faith, but treats religion as an integral part of American life. Episodes that I\u2019ve seen are not so much irreverent toward religion, but poke fun at American attitudes and practices.\" One episode that heavily features religion is \"Bart Sells His Soul\" (1995). While discussing The Simpsons treatment of religion in his Drawn to Television book, M. Keith Booker cites a scene from the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul \u2013 and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money. Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that \"life suddenly feels empty and incomplete\" without a soul, which suggests \"either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction\". The episode has been used in church courses about the nature of a soul in Connecticut and in the United Kingdom, and was shown by a minister in Scotland in one of his sermons. (archived at AccessMyLibrary.com) A 2005 report on religious education in secondary schools by the UK education watchdog group Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) noted that the episode was being used as a teaching tool. ==Episodes with focus on religious topics== *\"Bart Gets an F\" (season two, 1990) \u2013 Christianity *\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" (season two, 1991) \u2013 Christianity *\"Like Father, Like Clown\" (season three, 1991) \u2013 Judaism *\"Homer the Heretic\" (season four, 1992) \u2013 Christianity and faith *\"Treehouse of Horror IV\" (season five, 1993) \u2013 the soul and the Devil *\"Bart Sells His Soul\" (season seven, 1995) \u2013 Christianity and existence of the soul *\"Hurricane Neddy\" (season eight, 1997) \u2013 Christianity and theodicy *\"In Marge We Trust\" (season eight, 1997) \u2013 Christianity *\"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\" (season nine, 1997) \\- Hinduism *\"Lisa the Skeptic\" (season nine, 1997) \u2013 faith, belief of angels, and Judgment Day *\"The Joy of Sect\" (season nine, 1998) \u2013 sects and cults *\"Simpsons Bible Stories\" (season ten, 1999) \u2013 Judaism and Christianity *\"Faith Off\" (season eleven, 2000) \u2013 faith healing *\"Treehouse of Horror XI\" (season twelve, 2000) \u2013 Christianity, Heaven and Hell *\"I'm Goin' to Praiseland\" (season twelve, 2001) \u2013 Christianity *\"She of Little Faith\" (season thirteen, 2001) \u2013 Buddhism, Christianity (Evangelicalism e.x.
