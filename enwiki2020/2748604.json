    "text": "The Royal Danish Theatre ('RDT, Danish: ''''') is both the national Danish performing arts institution and a name used to refer to its old purpose-built venue from 1874 located on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. The theatre was founded in 1748, first serving as the theatre of the king, and then as the theatre of the country. The theatre presents opera, the Royal Danish Ballet, classical music concerts (by the Royal Danish Orchestra, which dates back to 1448), and drama in several locations. The Royal Danish Theatre organization is under the control of the Danish Ministry of Culture, and its objectives are to ensure the staging of outstanding performances that do justice to the various stages which it controls. ==Performing arts venues== * The Old Stage is the original Royal Danish Theatre built in 1874. * The Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen), built in 2004. * St\u00e6rekassen (New Stage) is an Art Deco theatre adjacent to the main theatre. It was used for drama productions. It is no longer used by the Royal Theatre. * Royal Danish Playhouse is a venue for \"spoken theatre\" with three stages, inaugurated in 2008. ==Cultural references== * The Royal Theatre on Kongens Nytorv is a central location in the 1978 Olsen-banden film The Olsen Gang Sees Red (from 1:16:58). * The Royal Theatre is the location of several important scenes in the 2015 drama film The Danish Girl where Einar (Eddie Redmayne) begins to acknowledge his feminine side. ==See also== * Copenhagen Opera House * Royal Danish Ballet * Royal Danish Ballet school * Royal Danish Orchestra * Edvard Fallesen, General Director of the Royal Danish Theatre from 1876 to 1894 ==References== ==External links== * Official website * ** Skuespilhuset ** The Royal Danish Theatre and HC Andersen Category:Theatres in Copenhagen Category:Opera houses in Denmark Category:Listed theatres in Denmark Category:Concert halls in Copenhagen Category:Dance in Copenhagen Category:Ballet venues Category:Danish opera companies Category:Danish culture Theatre Category:Organizations based in Copenhagen Category:Historicist architecture in Copenhagen Category:Arts in Copenhagen Category:1748 establishments in Denmark Category:Theatres completed in 1874 Category:Organizations established in 1748 Category:Music venues completed in 1874 Category:Gammelholm ",
