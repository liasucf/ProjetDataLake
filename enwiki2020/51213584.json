    "text": "Radio 1's Dance Anthems is a radio show broadcast on BBC Radio 1. It airs every Saturday between 4pm and 7pm with Charlie Hedges, with a spin-off show entitled Radio 1's Party Anthems airing on Fridays between 3pm and 4pm hosted by Dev featuring an hour of feel-good dance tracks and remixes of current popular songs. The Saturday Dance Anthems show is divided into three \"zones\". The first hour is dedicated to \"past\" dance anthems, the second hour to \"present\" dance anthems, and the third hour to \"future\" dance anthems, including the \"R1 Dance Chart\". Each week, a guest DJ chooses a \"Classic Anthem\", a \"Current Anthem\" and a \"Future Anthem\". Former features include Danny Howard's \"Future Anthem\", \"Push The Tempo\", \"All Time Dance Anthems\",the \"Radio 1 Dance Chart\", \"Trending Tracks\", the \"Guest Mix\", the \"Back 2 Back\" mix and the \"Victory Dance\". The show was hosted by Danny Howard up until November 2017, but was taken over by MistaJam as Howard went on to present a Friday night show on the station. Up until June 2018, the Friday show was formerly hosted by Greg James but was taken over by Scott Mills as a part of BBC Radio 1's schedule change. After it was announced that Greg James dropped to four shows a week before taking over The Radio 1 Breakfast Show later that year. The show launched in April 2012 with the Friday show replacing Scott Mills' Ready For The Weekend when James and Mills switched shows, and Howard's Saturday show replacing Reggie Yates. The show is usually live from Ibiza during the Saturday of Radio 1's annual Ibiza Weekend in August, and there is occasionally a broadcast of BBC Radio 1's Dance Anthems on New Year's Eve. Due to a schedule change, Radio 1's Party Anthems moved from 6 pm to 3 pm and it would be hosted by Dev Griffin. On 23 September 2020, it was announced that MistaJam was leaving BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. It was also announced that Charlie Hedges was going to take over from Radio 1's Dance Anthems. ==External Links== Category:BBC Radio 1 programmes Category:British music radio programmes Category:1997 radio programme debuts ",
