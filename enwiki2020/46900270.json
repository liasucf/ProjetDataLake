    "text": "Jake Hildebrand (born June 19, 1993) is an American ice hockey goaltender for the Kalamazoo Wings of the ECHL. ==Playing career== In 2012, Hildebrand enrolled at Michigan State University to play NCAA Men's Division I college hockey with the Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference. In his junior year, Hildebrand's outstanding play was recognized when he was selected the 2014\u201315 Big Ten Best Goaltender and Big Ten Player of the Year. He was also named to the NCAA (West) First All-American Team. At the end of his 2015\u201316 season with the Spartans, he signed with the Allen Americans of the ECHL. As a free agent embarking on his professional career, Hildebrand agreed to a one-year contract with the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League on June 15, 2016. In the 2016\u201317 season, Hildebrand as a depth goaltender appeared in just 3 games with the IceHogs, appearing primarily with ECHL affiliate, the Indy Fuel. Unable to mark an impression with the IceHogs, Hildebrand left as a free agent and signed a one-year deal to continue in the ECHL with the Tulsa Oilers on August 3, 2017. In the 2017\u201318 season, Hildebrand assumed starting goaltender duties, appearing in 44 games with the Oilers and posting a .901 save percentage. In the off-season, Hildebrand was traded by the Oilers to the Kalamazoo Wings in exchange for Scott Henegar on July 24, 2018. ==Awards and honors== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Award !
