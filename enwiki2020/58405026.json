    "text": "Vrydagzynea grayi, commonly known as the tonsil orchid, is a species of orchid that is endemic to a small area in Queensland where it is only known from a single location in dense rainforest. It has between four and seven dark green, egg-shaped leaves and up to twelve white resupinate flowers which barely open. It has not been seen since 1983 and may now be extinct. == Description == Vrydagzynea grayi is a tuberous, perennial herb with between five and seven glossy dark green, egg-shaped leaves, long and about wide with wavy edges and arranged in a loose rosette. Between five and twelve resupinate, tube-shaped white flowers about long and which barely open are crowded on a flowering stem long. The dorsal sepal and petals overlap and form a hood over the column. The labellum is heart-shaped, about long, wide and has a spur with two, more or less spherical, stalked glands about long. Flowering occurs from September to October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Vrydagzynea grayi was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected by Bruce Gray in part of what is now the Daintree National Park. The description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (grayi) honours the collector of the type specimen. ==Distribution and habitat== The tonsil orchid grows in dense rainforest in the Daintree National Park. ==Conservation== Vrydagzynea grayi is only known from an area which has since been cleared prior to listing as a World Heritage national park and is possibly extinct. It is classed as \"endangered\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as Vrydagzynea paludosa and under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. ==References== Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Plants described in 2004 grayi ",
