    "text": "Nakhchivan (, ; ; , ) is the capital of the eponymous Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, located west of Baku. The municipality of Nakhchivan consists of the city of Nakhchivan, the settlement of \u018fliabad and the villages of Ba\u015fba\u015f\u0131, Bulqan, Haciniyy\u0259t, Qara\u00e7uq (Garachug), Qaraxanb\u0259yli (Garakhanbeyli), Tumbul, Qara\u011fal\u0131q, and Da\u015fduz. It is spread over the foothills of Zangezur Mountains, on the right bank of the Nakhchivan River at an altitude of above sea level. Since 9 June 2009, by the decree of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic, the Bulqan, Garachug, Garakhanbeyli, Tumbul, and Haciniyy\u0259t villages of the Babek Rayon are included in the scope of the administrative territorial unit of the Nakhchivan city. ==Etymology== Heinrich H\u00fcbschmann argued that Nakhichevan was originally named Naxcavan, which was the result of the combination of the name Naxc and avan (\"town\" in Armenian), thus translates to \"Naxc's town\", and later evolved into Nakhichevan.Lanser (2007) According to Harrison Gray Otis Dwight, Nakhichevan derives from the composition of nakh (\"first\" in Armenian) and ichevan (\"resting-place\" or \"descent\" in Armenian), thus translates to \"first resting- place\" or \"first descent\". ==History== ===Classical period=== Local tradition states that Nakhichevan was founded by Noah after the Flood, and was his place of death and burial. According to Saint Movses Khorenatsi, King Tigranes I of Armenia settled Median prisoners of war at Nakhichevan in the second century BC. Nakhichevan is first mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia as Naxouana ().Bosworth (2013) Nakhichevan was destroyed by Shahanshah Shapur II in 363 and its Armenian and Jewish population was deported to Iran.Lint (2018), p. 1055 Emperor Heraclius travelled through the city en route to Atropatene in 623 during the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628.Chaumont (1986), pp. 418\u2013438 ===Medieval period=== The Arab siege of Nakhichevan in 650 led Theodore Rshtuni to conclude a truce. After the rebellion of 703, Muhammad ibn Marwan had the rebel nobles burnt alive in churches in Nakhichevan and Goghtn in 705.Blankinship (1994), p. 107 Nakhichevan temporarily came under the control of the Kingdom of Armenia in c. 900, but was swiftly taken by Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj. The city was the temporary refuge of Atabeg Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr after his defeat at the Battle of Shamkor in 1195, and Nakhichevan was conquered by the Kingdom of Georgia in 1197.Rayfield (2013), pp. 112\u2013113 In 1225, Nakhichevan was ruled by al-Maleka al-Jal\u0101liya, daughter of Atabeg Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan. Genoese merchants were known to trade in the city by 1280.Bernardini (2000), pp. 422\u2013426 The city was conquered by Timur in 1401,Rayfield (2013), p. 150 but was taken by King George VII of Georgia in 1405.Rayfield (2013), p. 152 ===Modern period=== Nakhichevan was conquered by Shahanshah Ismail I in 1503.Rayfield (2013), p. 164 Shahanshah Abbas I of Persia reconquered Nakhichevan from the Ottoman Empire in 1603\u20131604.Herzig & Floor (2015), p. 5 Nakhichevan was annexed to the Russian Empire per the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828.Hille (2010), p. 66 The city became the centre of the Nakhichevansky Uyezd in the Erivan Governorate in 1849. In 1896, Nakhichevan had a population of 7,433, roughly two-thirds of which were Azeri- speaking Muslims and one-third Armenian Christians. After the February Revolution of 1917, a soviet was formed in Nakhichevan, but the city was under the control of the Special Transcaucasian Committee from March to November 1917, and its successor the Transcaucasian Commissariat from November 1917 to March 1918.Hille (2010), p. 170 Turkey occupied Nakhichevan from June until November, after which the city was occupied by British soldiers in January 1919,Hille (2010), p. 173 and a military governor was appointed to administer Nakhichevan. It was decided that Nakhichevan would be granted to Armenia on 6 April 1919, and the city was annexed on 6 June 1919.Hille (2010), p. 171 Britain, France, Italy, and the US, with approval from Armenia and Azerbaijan, agreed on 25 October 1919 to appoint American Colonel Edmond D. Daily as General-Governor of Nakhichevan, elections would be held, and both Armenia and Azerbaijan would withdraw its forces from the territory.Hille (2010), pp. 171\u2013172 However, in March 1920, Turkish forces led by K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir occupied Nakhichevan. Soviet Russia took control of Nakhichevan on 28 July 1920, and the city became part of the newly formed Nakhichevan Soviet Socialist Republic.Hille (2010), p. 172 The Treaty of Moscow of 16 March 1921, and later the Treaty of Kars of 21 October 1921, between Russia and Turkey agreed that Nakhichevan would be an autonomous territory under the protection of Azerbaijan and delimited its borders with Turkey.Hille (2010), p. 159Hille (2010), p. 191 In February 1923, the city formed part of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Krai within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), but later became the capital of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the ASSR in March 1924. ===Ecclesiastical history=== The bishop of Mardpetakan resided at Nakhichevan, and the Armenian historian Tovma Artsruni records Sahak Vahevuni as bishop of Nakhichevan and Mardpetakan and brother of Apusahak Vahevuni.Thomas et al. (2010), p. 103 == Geography == The city is spread over the foothills of Zangezur chain, on the right bank of the Nakhchivan River at an altitude of almost 1,000 m (3,300 ft). The floods and soil erosion spiked because of the decreased forest cover along riverbanks. As a result, reforestation projects implemented in the city to encourage tree planting. ===Climate=== Nakhchivan has a continental semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk) with short but cold, snowy winters and long, dry, very hot summers. == Population == According to the State Statistics Committee of Azerbaijan, the number of population of city was 63,8 thousand in 2000. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+The population of Nakhchivan (at the beginning of the year, thsd. persons) !Population !2000 !2001 !2002 !2003 !2004 !2005 !2006 !2007 !2008 !2009 !2010 !2011 !2012 !2013 !2014 !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !2019 |- |Nakhchivan town |63,8 |64,2 |64,7 |65,1 |70,7 |71,0 |71,3 |71,7 |72,7 |82,4 |83,4 |84,7 |86,4 |88,0 |89,5 |90,3 |91,1 |92,1 |92,9 |93,7 |- |Urban population |63,8 |64,2 |64,7 |65,1 |70,7 |71,0 |71,3 |71,7 |72,7 |73,7 |73,8 |75,4 |76,8 |78,3 |79,5 |80,2 |80,9 |81,8 |82,6 |83,2 |- |Rural population | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |8,7 |9,6 |9,3 |9,6 |9,7 |10,0 |10,1 |10,2 |10,3 |10,3 |10,5 |} == Demography == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+The composition of population of Nakhchivan city !Ethnic group !1829\u20131832 Census !1897 Census\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f Weekly (\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430. \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f): \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 1897 \u0433. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u0443\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438- \u041d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u2013 \u0433. \u041d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c-\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 1897 \u0433. \u0422\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 XIII. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443.

The city is home Momine Khatun Mausoleum, Gulustan Mausoleum, Noah's Mausoleum, Garabaghlar Mausoleum, Yusif ibn Kuseyir Mausoleum, Imamzadeh mausoleum and Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid mausoleums. The main sight in the city is the heavily restored 12th-century Momine Khatun Mausoleum, also known as Atabek Gumbezi. Momine Khatun was the wife of Eldegizid Atabek Jahan Pahlivan, ruler of the Atabek Eldegiz emirate. The 10-sided monument is decorated with intricate geometrical motives and Kufic script, it uses turquoise glazed bricks. It shares the neighbourhood with a statue of its architect \u2013 Ajami Nakhchivani \u2013 and a bust of Heydar Aliyev. Also from the 12th century and by the same architect, is the octagonal Yusuf Ibn Kuseir tomb, known as Atababa, half abandoned near the main cemetery. In 1993, the white marble mausoleum of Hussein Javid was built. The Azerbaijani writer died in the Gulag during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. Both the mausoleum and his house museum are located east of the theatre. Although being a recent construction, Huseyn Javid's mausoleum is of great iconic importance, representing the ability of the exclave to live despite the Armenian embargo and becoming a symbol of Nakhchivan itself.

Tendir Lavash Lavash is made with flour, water, and salt. The thickness of the bread varies depending on how thin it was rolled out. Toasted sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds are sometimes sprinkled on before baking. It is impossible to imagine any table without bread in Azerbaijan and also in Nakhchivan. In connection with this, the assortment of bread in Nakhchivan is different; the tendir lavash as thin as paper, galin (thick), dastana, and komba (ash cake). If prepared to saj it was called lavash, \"Juha salmag\" \u2013 spread Juha, lavash bread on saj, and if prepared in the tandir, the \"llavash yapmag\" lavash bread stick. The fact is that it was necessary to stick lavash bread on the hot inner walls of the tandir. it is impossible to fight with lavash bread, as the proverb reads \"Gyaldi lavash \u2013 Bitdili Savas\" \u2013 \"Came lavash \u2013 the end of the war\". There are many people\u2019s ideological expressions about lavash \"Yavash-yavash -pendir- lavash \" \"Quietly (slow) \u2013 cheese lavash \" or \"Khamrali hash \u2013 bagryna bass\", \"Khamraliev\" (kind of bread) push to the chest, i.e. . lavash bread \u2013 eat slowly. \"Of lavash folk sandwiches are made in a roll shape \u2013 durmek. In the village where children ran out to play or school they were supplied with these sandwiches. Inside durmeks \u2013 rolls was put butter and jam, cheese, cottage cheese and butter, cheese with herbs, potatoes, boiled eggs, etc.\" ===Sacrificial monument Ashabi-Kahf=== Ashabi- Kahf is a sanctuary in a natural cave which is located in the eastern part of the city of Nakhchivan, between the mountains of Ilandag and Nahajir in Azerbaijan.Since ancient times Ashabi-Kahf is considered as a sacred place.It is known not only in Nakhchivan, but also in other regions of Azerbaijan and countries of the Middle East.Each year ten thousands of people make a pilgrimage to this place.
