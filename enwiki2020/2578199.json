    "text": ", better known by her pen name is a Japanese manga artist. She is married to fellow manga artist Tatsuneko, from whom he took the name of . She is a graduate of Mita Senior High School, Tokyo. She currently lives in Setagaya, Tokyo with her husband and daughter. ==Profile== She began her career as a d\u014djinshi artist creating d\u014djinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Ma\u014dden. She debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialized in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous d\u014djin works. However, the later disbanding of a d\u014djin circle, Yaj\u014d Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period. During her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, F\u016bma no Kojir\u014d, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace. When asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Jun K\u014dga, but subsequently changed it to Yun K\u014dga. Among her noted works is Loveless, which has been serialized in Monthly Comic Zero Sum since 2002 and is ongoing, as well as her work . She has also worked as an illustrator on the noted literary magazine Faust. In 2007, she contributed the character designs to the Sunrise anime series, Mobile Suit Gundam 00. ==Manga works== ===Unfinished/current works=== *Loveless (LOVELESS) 2001\u2013 *Tenshichou (\u5929\u4f7f\u5e81) 2002\u20132007 *Kill Me (KILL ME) 2003\u20132006 *Satou-kun to Tanaka-san -The blood highschool (\u4f50\u85e4\u304f\u3093\u3068\u7530\u4e2d\u3055\u3093 -The blood highschool) 2007\u2013 # ===Completed works=== *Riddle Story of Devil (Akuma no Riddle) 2012\u20132016 *Earthian (\u30a2\u30fc\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3) 1987\u20131995 *Saffron Zero Beat (\u30b5\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30fb\u30bc\u30ed\u30fb\u30d3\u30fc\u30c8) 1988\u20131991 *Kodomotachi wa Yoru no Juunin (\u5b50\u4f9b\u305f\u3061\u306f\u591c\u306e\u4f4f\u4eba) 1988\u20131990 # # *R\u014drakaiz\u0101 (\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30ab\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc) 1988\u20131993 # # # # *REN AI - Renai - (REN-AI \u604b\u611b) 1989\u20131999 # # # *You're My Only Shinin' Star (You're My Only Shinin' Star \u541b\u306f\u307c\u304f\u306e\u8f1d\u3051\u308b\u661f) 1989\u20131990 *Kiga Ichizoku (\u98e2\u9913\u4e00\u65cf) 1992\u20131993 * 1992\u20132001 *Yousei Jiken (\u5996\u7cbe\u4e8b\u4ef6) 1993\u20131999 # # # # *La Vie en Rose (LA VIE EN ROSE) 1995\u20131998 # # *Crown of Love (\u604b\u611b-CROWN-) 1998\u20132002 *Hapipuri (\u306f\u3074\u3077\u308a) 1999\u20132001 *Earthian Gaiden Himitsu no Hanazono (\u30a2\u30fc\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u5916\u4f1d \u79d8\u5bc6\u306e\u82b1\u5712) 2002 *Bite Me ===Incomplete works=== *B-gata Doumei (B\u578b\u540c\u76df) 1988\u20131989 # *Genji (\u6e90\u6c0f) 1988\u20131995 # # # # # # # # *Yajou Teikoku (\u591c\u5b22\u5e1d\u56fd) 1988\u20131989 # *Arisu in Wonderland (\u3042\u308a\u3059 IN WONDERLAND) 1989\u20131992 # # *Vanpu - Kyuuketsu no To - (\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d7-\u5438\u8840\u306e\u5f92-) 1989\u20131995 *Hurricane Hill (\u30cf\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30d2\u30eb) 1997 *Chronicle (\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb) 1998\u20131998 # *\"Kurumada Suidoken Hero of Heroes\" 2015(1 Tank\u014dbon) ===Short works=== *Metal Heart (\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8) 1986 *Mind Size (\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba) 1986\u20131988 *Glass Magic (\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u30fb\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af) 1988 *Hot Staff '88 (\u307b\u3063\u3068\u30fb\u3059\u305f\u3063\u3075'88) 1988 *\u014ckami wo Meguru Bouken (\u72fc\u3092\u3081\u3050\u308b\u5192\u967a) 1989 *Kugatsu no Natsu (9\u6708\u306e\u590f) 1989 *Yakusoku no Natsu (\u7d04\u675f\u306e\u590f) 1991 *Yousei Jiken 1992 (\u5996\u7cbe\u4e8b\u4ef6 1992) 1992 *Kurayamizaka (\u6697\u95c7\u5742) 1999 ===Collaborations=== *Wakakusa Monogatari (\u82e5\u8349\u7269\u8a9e) (original creator: Louisa May Alcott) 1985 *Choushinka Enasu (\u8d85\u65b0\u5316\u30a8\u30ca\u30b9) (original creator: Toshiki Hirano) 1988\u20131989 *Carol - K (CAROL-K) (original creator: Naoto Kine) 1995\u20131998 *Clock Tower Ghost Head (\u30af\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9) (original creator: Human Entertainment) 1998 *Majuu no Kuru Yoru (\u9b54\u7363\u306e\u6765\u308b\u591c) (Kaoru Kurimoto) 2001 *Houkago, Nanajikan-me.
