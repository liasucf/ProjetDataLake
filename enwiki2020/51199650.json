    "text": "The Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Snows () also called Jo\u00e3o Pessoa Cathedral is a Catholic church located in the old town of Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, capital of the state of Paraiba in Brazil. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Para\u00edba. A church dedicated to Our Lady of the Snows was built on a hill by the first settlers of Paraiba in 1586. It was a simple building, mud, which was rebuilt in the early seventeenth century. In 1639, a Dutch chronicler Elias Herckmans, refers to it as yet unfinished in its Overview of the Captaincy of Paraiba. The construction and renovation continued during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, always in the midst of economic difficulties. In 1894 it was declared cathedral. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Brazil *Our Lady of the Snows (disambiguation) Internal view ==References== Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Para\u00edba Category:Buildings and structures in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1586 Category:Roman Catholic churches in Para\u00edba ",
