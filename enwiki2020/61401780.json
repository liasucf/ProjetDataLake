    "text": "Prostate steam treatment (Rezum), also called water vapor thermal therapy (WVTT), is a minimally invasive surgical procedure for men with lower urinary tract symptoms resulting from prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH). It uses injections of steam to remove obstructive prostate tissue from the inside of the organ without injuring the prostatic part of the urinary tube (prostatic urethra). Although it is a relatively new technique, one trial showed positive outcomes in a four-year follow-up. According to a review article published in 2020, > WVTT provided [clinically important] improvement in BPH symptoms \u2026, > preserved sexual function, and was associated with low surgical retreatment > rates over 4 years. == Medical uses == As of 2019, trials including one randomized control trial show encouraging results for benign prostatic hypertrophy. A 2018 review found four trials that showed positive outcomes at 1 to 2 years of follow up. It however has not been compared to transurethral resection of the prostate as of 2018. Water vapor thermal therapy was looked at in larger volume prostates (>80 mL) and in those with middle lobes protruding into the bladder and appears to work. The procedure has been shown to not affect sexual function across a few studies. == Procedure == It is an outpatient or office-based procedure. The equipment consists of a vapor generator and a transurethral delivery device. The latter is similar to a cystoscope with an optical system with a 90\u00b0 extending retractable 10.25 mm long injection needle (diameter 1.3 mm). From this needle water vapor is circumferentially delivered via 12 holes at the needle\u2019s tip. Depending on the size of the prostate an adequate number of injections is delivered to the two side lobes and to the middle lobe of the prostate. Each injection lasts 9 seconds and the space between adjacent injections is about 10 mm. Upon condensation of the vapor upon cell membranes, cell death and necrosis occur immediately. Over a period of about three months the dead cells are removed by the body, thus shrinking the prostate and relieving BPH symptoms. == History == The Rezum system was introduced by NxThera (Maple Grove, Minnesota, US). It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) of the UK in 2018.National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): Rezum for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, Medtech innovation briefing, 24 August 2018 (containing also information on costs and cost effectiveness). As of August 2018 the system was in use in 5 National Health Service hospitals in England, and due to be implemented in a further 15. == References == == External links == * BBC News Health: Steam treatment for big prostates approved on NHS, 21 August 2018 * NxThera\u2019s Rez\u016bm Provides a New Treatment Option for Patients with BPH: Interview with CEO of NxThera, published by Medgadget (accessed Dec 02, 2019).
