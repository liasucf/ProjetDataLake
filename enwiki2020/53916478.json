Chan School of Public Health and the Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, as well as a Senior Advisor at Albright Stonebridge Group. His research centers on improving the quality and cost of health care, focusing on the impact of public health policy. == Education and early career == Jha graduated from Columbia University in 1992. He received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1997 and then trained as a resident in Internal Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He returned to Boston to complete his fellowship in General Medicine from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. In 2004, he completed his Master of Public Health degree at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He originally hails from Madhubani, Bihar, India. He was born in Bihar in 1970 and moved to Toronto, Canada in 1979. He moved to the United States in 1983 and has lived there ever since. == Research == === Coronavirus and COVID-19 === In mid-March, Dr. Jha called for a two-week national quarantine across the United States to reduce the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jha's argument is that it takes up to two weeks for those who are already infected with the novel coronavirus to begin showing symptoms; given the lack of COVID-19 testing in the U.S., a two-week quarantine would help public health better assess how widespread the disease is to better inform decision-making. He has also advocated for the need to vastly strengthen healthcare infrastructure and increase the manufacturing of personal protective equipment to keep healthcare workers safe. == Awards and honors == * Elected Member, National Academy of Medicine, 2013 ==References== == External links == * Harvard School of Public Health Biography * Harvard Global Health Initiative Biography Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Harvard School of Public Health faculty Category:American public health doctors Category:Harvard Medical School alumni Category:Harvard School of Public Health alumni Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni ",
