The Journal of Popular Culture gave an overall favorable review for Talbot Mundy, Philosopher of Adventure, writing \"I would assume the book's audience to be somewhat limited but justifiably enthusiastic: relevant academics and their libraries; fans of genre or series fiction; those interested in theosophy or Eastern literature; and bibliophiles.\" Extrapolation also reviewed the work, stating that they thought \"the strongest part of the biography when Taves is best, perhaps a result of his work as a media archivist, is the section that treats the Jack Armstrong radio scripts and the last of the \"multiple lives\" led by Mundy in the years just before Pearl Harbor.\" ==References== Category:Biographies about writers Category:2005 non-fiction books ",
