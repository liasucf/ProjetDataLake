It was called Mellemskov, but was renamed soon after its founding,Horizons Regional Council \u2013 Regional Policy Statement and was colloquially known as Jackeytown. The 2013 census recorded Eketahuna's population at 441; down from 456 in 2006. The town is located at the foot of the Tararua Ranges which lie to the west. It is 35 kilometres north of Masterton and a similar distance south of Palmerston North. It is situated on State Highway 2 and the eastern bank of the Makakahi River. Eket\u0101huna is considered by some to be the stereotypical rural New Zealand town, and is occasionally used in conversation to represent \"the real New Zealand\". New Zealanders colloquially refer to the town of Eket\u0101ahuna the way other English speakers refer to Timbuktu, i.e., the middle of nowhere, \"the sticks\", the end of the world. Likewise, Eket\u0101huna is a booming metropolis compared to the mythical town of Waikikamukau (pronounced \"Why- kick-a-moo-cow\"). The Mount Bruce bird sanctuary is located to the south of the town. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \"land on the sandbank\" for Eket\u0101huna. The name of the town, when spoken, sounds like a sentence in Afrikaans which translates to \"I have a chicken\". This is a source of amusement to immigrant Afrikaans-speaking South Africans in New Zealand. On 20 January 2014, the town was the epicenter of the 2014 Eketahuna earthquake. Measuring 6.2 on the Richter magnitude scale, the quake caused moderate damage all over the southern North Island. In July 2020, the name of the town was officially gazetted as Eket\u0101huna by the New Zealand Geographic Board. ==Education== Eketahuna School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of . ==Notable people== * Tania Lineham, born 1966 in Eketahuna.
