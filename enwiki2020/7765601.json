    "text": "Saint Mesmin (Maximin, Maximinus) (died ca. 520 AD) is a French saint associated with the Bishopric of Orl\u00e9ans. He provided direction to Leonard of Noblac. Saint Euspicius was his uncle. Clovis gave Euspicius and his nephew Mesmin in 508 the domain of Micy, near Orl\u00e9ans at the confluence of the Loire and the Loiret, for a monastery, known as Micy Abbey. When Euspicius died, Mesmin became abbot, and during his rule the religious life there flourished notably. St. Mesme was his sister. ==Sources== *SAINT MAXIMIN or MESMIN of VERDUN Category:520 deaths Category:6th-century Frankish saints Category:Year of birth unknown ",
