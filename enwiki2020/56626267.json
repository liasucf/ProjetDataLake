    "text": "Jonathan Van Ness (born March 28, 1987) is an American hairdresser, podcaster, and television personality. He is internationally known as the grooming expert on the Netflix series Queer Eye, for his work on the web series parody Gay of Thrones, and for hosting the Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness podcast. == Early life == Jonathan Van Ness was born March 28, 1987, and raised in Quincy, Illinois. Van Ness said he comes \"from a family of journalists,\" being the sixth generation of their family-owned newspaper. This refers to broadcast and newspaper conglomerate Quincy Media and the company's local flagship newspaper, the Herald-Whig; Van Ness' mother is the vice president of Quincy Media, and he is a descendant of the Oakley family which has controlled the company since the 1890s. Openly gay throughout his life, Van Ness experienced bullying for his \"femininity and natural flamboyance,\" and received death threats. He \"endured years of judgment, ridicule, and trauma.\" Of the time, Van Ness said, \"Growing up I definitely put on every nail polish, every heel, every scarf \u2013 I definitely had my mom's knockoff Herm\u00e8s scarves in my hair and around my waist \u2013 those were my skirts, and I loved it. ... But when I was really young, I had really femme-shamey, gender-shamey [reactions] when I would dress like that. When I would play with those things, I knew it needed to be... behind closed doors.\" Although always comfortable in his own skin, he says it did take some time to navigate other people's reactions. In response to the bullying he used humor as a coping mechanism, and relied on a small group of close friends for support. Years later, in the late 2010s, he realized he was gender non-conforming, and non-binary. When he was younger, he was sexually abused by an older boy at church, and Van Ness said this laid the foundation for self-destructive behaviors. In his early teens, he used online- chat to socialize with, and sometimes meet older men for sex. He was the first male cheerleader at Quincy Senior High School and continued cheerleading in college at the University of Arizona, where he majored in political science. One month in his initial semester at college, he used up his monthly allowance on cocaine and, too embarrassed to ask his parents for funds, turned to sex work. His addictions to sex and drugs increased to also include methamphetamine. His grades fell and he lost his cheerleading scholarship. He dropped out after one semester to pursue hairstyling. Van Ness trained at the Aveda Institute in Minneapolis. After graduating, he worked in Arizona for five years, before moving to Los Angeles, California, in 2009. ==Career== In Los Angeles, Van Ness found a job as a personal assistant at Sally Hershberger Salon. One day in 2012, he fainted in the salon while doing highlights for a client's hair. Later at a clinic, he found out he was HIV-positive. He used the revelation to \"get clean\" from drug use and publicly shared his story, saying, \"I want people to realize you\u2019re never too broken to be fixed.\" He currently works at MoJoHair and Stile Salon, both in Los Angeles, which he co- founded with Monique Northrop of Arte Salon in New York City. Media In 2013, while dressing the hair of friend Erin Gibson \u2013 who worked for the comedy syndicate Funny or Die \u2013 Van Ness was asked by Gibson to perform his recap of a Game of Thrones episode for Funny or Die, which became the Gay of Thrones web series. Van Ness was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Variety Series in 2018 for Gay of Thrones. Since 2015, Van Ness has hosted the weekly podcast Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness. His podcast took off upon the airing of the first Queer Eye episode. Van Ness currently stars as the grooming expert on the Netflix revival of Queer Eye. === Writing and Peanut goes for the Gold === In 2020, Van Ness released a picture book titled Peanut goes for the Gold. It tells the story of a nonbinary guinea pig named Peanut and their adventures as a rhythmic gymnastics prodigy. Peanut is inspired by Jonathan\u2019s own childhood pet. In an interview for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Van Ness discussed how Peanut didn\u2019t have any other rhythmic gymnasts to look up to so they created a space for themselves as a rhythmic gymnast. He also announced Peanut goes for the Gold would be partnering with No Kid Hungry\u2019s fund #savewithstories, where Van Vess did a virtual reading of Peanut goes for the Gold to support the children affected by the coronavirus pandemic to ensure they have access to meals that would have been provided to them at school. In a LiveSigning interview, Van Ness explained why he wanted to write Peanut goes for the Gold, saying \u201cI really wanted to do something that would celebrate all those kids that are individual and themselves\u201d, and emphasized the importance of uniqueness and pursuing one's passions. ==Personal life== Van Ness currently works in Los Angeles and New York City. He has psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, and advises clients on skin care. Van Ness is non-binary. His preferred gender pronouns are he/him/his, but he has indicated that he is okay being referred to with she/her or they/them as well. In a 2019 interview with The New York Times, he revealed a history of drug addiction issues, childhood sexual abuse, and his HIV-positive diagnosis at age 25. On September 25, 2019, Van Ness announced his endorsement of Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020 based upon healthcare being a human right. His memoir, Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love,was published in October 2019. His memoir discusses his past and how it helped sculpt his future. On June 23, 2020, Van Ness and Queer Eye costar Bobby Berk praised recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions which ruled that LGBT employment discrimination was a violation of the Civil Right Act of 1964. Van Ness described the ruling as \"a great step in the right direction.\" However, both of them still urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act. == Filmography == ===Television and web=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
