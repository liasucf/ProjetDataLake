Grassroots campaigns including \"Blackout Ireland\" and \"Boycott Eircom\" have been established to protest the censorship. Beyond these issues there are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups could engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. Irish law provides for freedom of speech including for members of the press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system act jointly to ensure freedom of speech and of the press. ==See also== * Broadband in Northern Ireland * IE Domain Registry * Internet Neutral Exchange, an Internet traffic exchange point located in Ireland * Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland * Irish Internet Hotline, illegal Internet content reporting service * Media of the Republic of Ireland * Pirate Party (Ireland) * Telecommunications in Ireland ==References== ==External links== * Commission for Communications Regulation * Hotline.ie, service for reporting illegal Internet content * ISP Association of Ireland (ISPAI) * Lightnet Broadband Category:Internet in Ireland ",
