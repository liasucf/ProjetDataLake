The tournament was played in Omaha, Nebraska during April 2007. Maryland\u2013Eastern Shore defeated Arkansas State in the championship match, 4 games to 2, to win their first national title. ==Qualification== Since there is only one national collegiate championship for women's bowling, all NCAA bowling programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 8 teams were invited to contest this championship, which consisted of a modified double-elimination style tournament. Two more matches, comprising Round 5, were played this year. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
