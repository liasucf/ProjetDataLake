Studio Chizu has won three Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year awards. The image in their logo is a reference to Makoto Konno, the main character of the Hosoda-directed 2006 film The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. == History == Studio Chizu was founded by Y\u016bichir\u014d Sait\u014d and Mamoru Hosoda, both of which had ties to animation studio Madhouse. Sait\u014d had been with Madhouse since 1999, and had co-produced The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, which Mamoru Hosoda directed. The aim of the studio was described by Saito as an \"auteur's studio\" for Hosoda, who himself mentioned that creating Studio Chizu was necessary in order for him to make the films that he wanted to make. Studio Chizu co-produced its first feature film Wolf Children with Madhouse, which was released in 2012. It earned roughly $55 million and won its first Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. In 2013, the studio was approached by a representative of French film company Gaumont, who wanted to work with Studio Chizu to distribute its films internationally. This distribution partnership was announced in 2014. The studio went on to produce The Boy and the Beast, which was released in 2015 earning roughly $49 million and winning for a second time the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Studio Chizu produced Hosoda's next film, Mirai, in 2018 and received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnm7n7zlZ7U This film also won the studio its third Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year in March 2019. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |- ! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year ! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Title ! data-sort- type=\"text\" | Director ! data-sort-type=\"text\" | Screenwriter(s) ! data-sort- type=\"text\" | Music ! data-sort-type=\"number\" | RT |- | style=\"text- align:centre\"| 2012 ! style=\"text-align:centre\" | Wolf Children | Mamoru Hosoda | Mamoru Hosoda & Satoko Okudera | rowspan=\"3\" | Masakatsu Takagi | 94% |- | style=\"text-align:centre\" | 2015 ! style=\"text-align:centre\"| The Boy and the Beast | rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Mamoru Hosoda | 90% |- | style=\"text- align:centre\" | 2018 ! style=\"text-align:centre\"|Mirai | 91% |- |} == References == == External links == * Category:Japanese companies established in 2011 Category:Animation studios in Tokyo Category:Film production companies of Japan Category:Japanese animation studios Category:Mass media companies established in 2011 Category:Suginami ",
