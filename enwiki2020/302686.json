    "text": "Joseph Joachim (, 28 June 1831 \u2013 15 August 1907) was a Hungarian violinist, conductor, composer and teacher who made an international career, based in Hanover and Berlin. A close collaborator of Johannes Brahms, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant violinists of the 19th century. Joachim studied violin early, beginning in Buda at age five, then in Vienna and Leipzig. He made his debut in London in 1844, playing Beethoven's Violin Concerto, with Mendelssohn conducting. He returned to London many times throughout life. After years of teaching at the Leipzig Conservatory and playing as principal violinist of the Gewandhausorchester, he moved to Weimar in 1848, where Franz Liszt established cultural life. From 1852, Joachim served at the court of Hanover, playing principal violin in the opera and conducting concerts, with months of free time in summer for concert tours. In 1853, he was invited by Robert Schumann to the Lower Rhine Music Festival, where he met Clara Schumann and Brahms, with whom he performed for years to come. He married Amalie, an opera singer, in 1863, who gave up her career; the couple had six children. Joachim quit service in Hanover in 1865, and the family moved to Berlin, where he was entrusted with founding and directing a new department at the Royal Conservatory, for performing music. He formed a string quartet, and kept performing chamber music on tours. His playing was recorded in 1903. ==Life== ===Origins=== Joachim's birth house in Kittsee Joachim was born in K\u00f6pcs\u00e9ny, Moson County, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Kittsee in Burgenland, Austria). He was the seventh of eight children born to Julius, a wool merchant, and Fanny Joachim, who were of Hungarian-Jewish origin.Campbell, He spent his childhood as a member of the Kittsee Kehilla (Jewish community), one of Hungary's prominent Siebengemeinden ('Seven Communities') under the protectorate of the Esterh\u00e1zy family. He was a first cousin of Fanny Wittgenstein, n\u00e9e Figdor, the mother of Karl Wittgenstein and the grandmother of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the pianist Paul Wittgenstein.Monk, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius: p. 5 ===Early career=== In 1833 his family moved to Pest, which in 1873 was united with Buda and \u00d3buda to form Budapest. There from 1836 (age 5) he studied violin with the Polish violinist Stanis\u0142aw Serwaczy\u0144ski, the concertmaster of the opera in Pest, said to be the best violinist in Pest. Although Joachim's parents were \"not particularly well off\", they had been well advised to choose not just an \"ordinary\" violin teacher.Moser, 1901, p. 3 Joachim's first public performance was 17 March 1839 when he was of age 7.Moser, p. 6 (Serwaczy\u0144ski later moved back to Lublin, Poland, where he taught Wieniawski.) In 1839, Joachim continued his studies at the Vienna Conservatory (briefly with Miska Hauser and Georg Hellmesberger, Sr.;Fuller-Maitland, p. 2 finally \u2013 and most significantly \u2013 with Joseph B\u00f6hm,Moser, p. 17 who introduced him to the world of chamber music).Fuller-Maitland, p. 3Campbell, p. 75 In 1843 he was taken by his cousin, Fanny Figdor, who later married \"a Leipzig merchant\"Fuller Maitland, p. 4 named Wittgenstein, to live and study in Leipzig.Moser, 1901, pp. 8\u20139 In the journal Neue Zeitschrift f\u016fr Musik Robert Schumann was highly enthusiastic about Felix Mendelssohn, on which Moser writes \"Only in Haydn's admiration for Mozart does the history of music know a parallel case of such ungrudging veneration of one great artist for his equal.\"Moser, p. 38 in 1835, Mendelssohn had become director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra. In 1843 Joachim became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mendelssohn, who arranged for him to study theory and composition with Moritz Hauptmann and violin with Ferdinand David.Avins, 2002 In his d\u00e9but performance in the Gewandhaus Joachim played the Otello Fantasy by Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst. Joachim's birth house in Kittsee today Memorial plaque on his birth house ====London Philharmonic debut, Beethoven Violin Concerto==== On 27 May 1844 Joachim, not quite 13, in his London debut with Mendelssohn conducting at a concert of the Philharmonic Society, played the solo part in Beethoven's Violin Concerto. This was a triumph in several respects, as described by R. W. Eshbach. The Philharmonic had a policy against performers so young, but an exception was made after auditions persuaded gatherings of distinguished musicians and music lovers that Joachim had mature capabilities. Despite Beethoven's recognition as one of the greatest composers, and the ranking nowadays of his violin concerto as among the greatest few, it was far from being so ranked before Joachim's performance. Ludwig Spohr had harshly criticized it, and after the London premiere by violinist Edward Eliason, a critic had said it \"might have been written by any third or fourth rate composer.\" But Joachim was very well prepared to play Beethoven's concerto, having written his own cadenzas for it and memorized the piece. The audience anticipated great things, having got word from the rehearsal,Moser, 1901, p. 57 and so, Mendelssohn wrote, \"frenetic applause began\" as soon as Joachim stepped in front of the orchestra. The beginning was applauded still more, and \"cheers of the audience accompanied every ... part of the concerto.\" Reviewers also had high praise. One for 'The Musical World' wrote \"The greatest violinists hold this concerto in awe ... Young Joachim ... attacked it with the vigour and determination of the most accomplished artist ... no master could have read it better,\" and the two cadenzas, written by Joachim, were \"tremendous feats ... ingeniously composed\". Another reviewer, for the 'Illustrated London News', wrote that Joachim \"is perhaps the first violin player, not only of his age, but of his si\u00e8cle\" [century]. \"He performed Beethoven's solitary concerto, which we have heard all the great performers of the last twenty years attempt, and invariably fail in ... its performance was an eloquent vindication of the master-spirit who imagined it.\" A third reviewer, for the 'Morning Post', wrote that the concerto \"has been generally regarded by violin-players as not a proper and effective development of the powers of their instrument\" but that Joachim's performance \"is beyond all praise, and defies all description\" and \"was altogether unprecedented.\" Joachim remained a favorite with the English public for the rest of his career. He visited England in each year 1858, 1859, 1862 largely at the behest of his friend William Sterndale Bennett, and for several decades thereafter.Fuller-Maitland, p. 13 ====Beethoven string quartets==== Moser (p. 28 ff.) writes \"After the appearance of the six String Quartets (Op. 18) Beethoven had complete command of the field of chamber-music\", although in the later quartets he \"makes many exacting demands\" of string players. Moser (p. 29) further writes that \"at the time of Beethoven's death\", such people as Spohr and Hauptmann did not necessarily esteem the late quartets above the earliest ones. Moser, p. 30 writes that in Vienna \"the public showed a marked hostility toward\" the late quartets. But Joachim's teacher B\u00f6hm had an appreciation of the late quartets, which he communicated to Joachim.Moser, p. 32 At the age of 18, \"in the whole of Germany\" Joachim had no equal, either in the rendering of Bach or in the concertos of Beethoven and Mendelssohn; while as quartet player, \"he had no cause to fear rivalry.\"Moser, p. 76 ===Maturity=== Following Mendelssohn's death in 1847, Joachim stayed briefly in Leipzig, teaching at the Conservatorium and playing on the first desk of the Gewandhaus Orchestra with Ferdinand David,Moser, 1901, pp. 39, 43\u201344 whom Mendelssohn had appointed as concertmaster on taking up the conductorship in 1835. ====Weimar, Liszt; then Hanover==== In 1848, the pianist and composer Franz Liszt took up residence in Weimar, where Goethe and Schiller had lived.Moser, p. 78 Liszt was determined to re-establish the town's reputation as the Athens of Germany. There, he gathered a circle of young avant-garde disciples, vocally opposed to the conservatism of the Leipzig circle. Joachim was amongst the first of these. He served Liszt as concertmaster, and for several years enthusiastically embraced the new \"psychological music,\" as he called it. In 1852 he moved to Hanover, at the same time dissociating himself from the musical ideals of the 'New German School' (Liszt, Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, and their followers, as defined by journalist Franz Brendel). \"The worship of Wagner's music permeating musical taste in Weimar was to Joachim inordinate and unacceptable.\"Campbell, 1981, p. 76 Joachim's break with Liszt became final in August 1857, when he wrote to his former mentor: \"I am completely out of sympathy with your music; it contradicts everything which from early youth I have taken as mental nourishment from the spirit of our great masters.\"Swafford, p. 174, in another translation Hanover \"was then an independent kingdom, later to be absorbed in the German empire.\"Leopold Auer, Violin Playing as I Teach It, Dover, New York, 1980, p. 5 King Georg of Hanover was totally blind and very fond of music; he paid Joachim a good salary and gave him considerable freedom.Auer, 1923, pp. 58\u201359 Joachim's duties in Hanover included playing the main violin part in opera performances and that or conducting state concerts.Moser, pp. 116\u2013117 He had five summer months off, in which he made concert tours around Europe.Moser, p. 117 In March 1853 he sent to Liszt a copy of the Overture to Hamlet he had recently composed.Moser, p. 120. ===The Schumanns, Brahms; Berlin=== Joachim by John Singer Sargent, 1904 Also in 1853, a committee headed by Schumann invited Joachim to the Lower Rhine Music Festival.Moser, p. 121 At the Festival, Joachim again soloed in the Beethoven violin concerto.Swafford, p. 62 His success made him, it is said, \"the most renowned artist of Germany\". Robert Schumann and his wife Clara were deeply impressed, and formed a \"close connection\" with Joachim.Swafford, p. 63 Joachim met the then publicly unknown 20-year-old Brahms, and wrote of him that his playing \"shows the intense fire...which predicts the artist\" and \"his compositions already betoken such power as I have seen in no other musician of his age\".Moser, p. 127 Joachim strongly recommended Brahms to Robert.Swafford, p. 75 Brahms was received by the Schumanns with great enthusiasm. After Robert's mental breakdown in 1854 and death in 1856, Joachim, Clara, and Brahms remained lifelong friends and shared musical views. Joachim's performing style with the violin, like Clara's at the piano, is said to have been \"restrained, pure, antivirtuosic, expressing the music rather than the performer.\"Swafford, p. 130 In December 1854, Joachim visited Robert at the Endenich asylum where he had been since February, Joachim being his first visitor.Swafford, p. 133 Early on, Brahms already played and composed for the piano, which \"he had mastered in a supreme fashion\", but he felt deficient in orchestration.Gal, p. 60 In 1854 he began composing what was to become his first piano concerto, his first orchestral piece. He sent a score of the first movement to Joachim, requesting his advice.Gal, p. 61 After getting Joachim's response, Brahms wrote to him \"A thousand thanks for having studied the first movement in such a sympathetic and careful manner. I have learned a great deal from your remarks. As a musician I really have no greater wish than to have more talent so that I can learn still more from such a friend.\"Gal, p. 114 Later in the composition of the concerto, which took four years, Brahms wrote to Joachim \"I am sending you the rondo once more. And just like the last time, I beg for some really severe criticism.\"Gal, p. 115 The final manuscript of the concerto \"shows many alterations in the handwriting of Joachim\".Fuller Maitland, p. 55 Joseph and Amalie Joachim Joachim's time in Hanover was his most prolific period of composition. Then and during the rest of his career, he frequently performed with Clara Schumann. For example, in October\u2013November 1857 they took a recital tour together to Dresden, Leipzig, and Munich.Litzmann, 1913, p. 152 St. James's Hall, London, which opened in 1858, hosted a series of \"Popular Concerts\" of chamber music, of which programmes from 1867 through 1904 are preserved.Arts & Humanities Research Council Concert Programmes, St. James's Hall Concerts (1867\u20131904) Joachim appears a great many times. He visited London each year from 1866 on.Avins, Styra, \"Joseph Joachim\", in Oxford Companion to Music, ed. Alison Latham, Oxford University Press, 2002\u20132003, p. 637 In March 1898 and in 1901\u20131904 Joachim appeared in his own quartet of players, but otherwise far more often he appeared with resident Popular Concerts artists Louis Ries,Louis Ries, born 1830, was the son of Hubert Ries. For a listing of Joachim's concert which includes some Monday Popular Concerts, see Joachim\u2019s Concerts second violin, J. B. Zerbini,Zerbini was of Australian origin. An obituary for him in the Illustrated Australian News (Melbourne) 1 January 1892 says he was \"acknowledged to be one of the finest viola players in the world.\" first viola, and Alfredo Piatti, first cello, reputed to be \"one of the most celebrated cellists\" of the time. George Bernard Shaw wrote that the Popular Concerts had helped greatly to spread and enlighten musical taste in England.Shaw, George Bernard (1937), London Music in 1888\u201389 as heard by Corno di Bassetto, etc. (Constable, London), p. 297 Joachim had been a mainstay of the chamber music Popular Concerts. At 18 of the Popular Concerts at least, Clara Schumann performed along with Joachim, Zerbini and Piatti, presumably playing piano quartets (without second violin), or sometimes piano trios (for piano, violin, and cello). (The programs of those concerts very likely also included string quartets in which she of course did not play, as Ries is also listed.) A favorite piece of Clara's was Brahms's Piano Quartet in A major. She wrote to Brahms 27 February 1882 from London that the piece had received \"much applause\".Litzmann, p. 289 About a performance of it in Liverpool 11 February she had written in her diary that it was \"warmly received, much to my surprise as the public here is far less receptive than that in London.\"Litzmann, p. 294 In January 1867 there had been a tour to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, by Joachim, Clara, her oldest daughter Marie, Ries, Zerbini, Piatti, two English sisters \"Miss Pyne,\" one a singer, and a Mr. Saunders who managed all the arrangements. Marie Schumann wrote home from Manchester that in Edinburgh Clara \"was received with tempestuous applause and had to give an encore, so had Joachim. Piatti, too, is always tremendously liked.\"Litzmann, pp. 249\u2013250 Joachim had extensive correspondence with both Clara and Brahms, as Brahms greatly valued Joachim's opinion of his new compositions. In 1860 Brahms and Joachim jointly wrote a manifesto against the \"progressive\" music of the 'New German' School, in reaction to the polemics of Brendel's Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik. This manifesto, a volley in the War of the Romantics, had originally few (four) signers (more later) and met with a mixed reception, being heavily derided by followers of Wagner.Jan Swafford, Johannes Brahms, Knopf (1997), reprinted in the UK by Papermac (1999) pp. 207\u2013211 The famous Joachim Quartet. From left to right: Robert Hausmann (cello), Josef Joachim (1st violin), Emanuel Wirth (viola) and Karel Hal\u00ed\u0159 (2nd violin) On 10 May 1863 Joachim married the contralto Amalie Schneeweiss (stage name: Amalie Weiss) (1839\u201399). Amalie gave up her own promising career as an opera singer and gave birth to six children. She continued to perform in oratorios and to give lieder recitals. In 1865 Joachim quit the service of the King of Hanover in protest, when the Intendant (artistic director) of the Opera refused to advance one of the orchestral players (Jakob Gr\u00fcn) because of the latter's Jewish birth.Moser (1901) 202\u2013206 In 1866, as a result of the Austro-Prussian war, in which Prussia and its capital Berlin became the dominant German state and city, Joachim moved to Berlin, where he was invited to help found, and to become the first director of, a new department of the Royal Academy of Music, concerned with musical performance and called the Hochschule f\u00fcr aus\u00fcbende Tonkunst. On Good Friday, 10 April 1868, Joachim and his wife joined their friend, Johannes Brahms, in the celebration of one of Brahms' greatest triumphs, the first complete performance of his German Requiem at the Bremen Cathedral. Amalie Joachim sang \"I Know that My Redeemer Liveth\" and Joseph Joachim played Robert Schumann's Abendlied. It was a glorious occasion, after which about 100 of the composer's friends, the Joachims, Clara Schumann, Albert Dietrich and his wife, Max Bruch and others gathered at the Bremen Rathskeller. The Joachim Quartet performing in the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin\u2014an engraving based on a painting (currently lost) by Felix Possart, published as a Beilage to the Zeitschrift der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft 4/5 (1903), between pp. 240 and 241. In 1869, the Joachim String Quartet was formed, which quickly gained a reputation as Europe's finest. It continued to perform until Joachim's death in 1907. Other members of the Quartet were, Karel Hal\u00ed\u0159 (2nd violin) from 1897 on; Emanuel Wirth (viola) from 1877 on; and Robert Hausmann (cello), from 1879 on.Stowell, ed., 2003 In 1878 while writing his violin concerto, Brahms consulted Joachim, who \"freely gave him encouragement and technical advice\".Gal, p. 216 Brahms asked Joachim to write the cadenza for the concerto, as he did. In 1884, Joachim and his wife separated after he became convinced that she was having an affair with the publisher Fritz Simrock. Brahms, certain that Joachim's suspicions were groundless, wrote a sympathetic letter to Amalie, which she later produced as evidence in Joachim's divorce proceeding against her.Campbell, p. 81 This led to a cooling of Brahms' and Joachim's friendship, which was not restored until some years later, when Brahms composed the Double Concerto in A minor for violin and cello, Op. 102, 1887, as a peace offering to his old friend. It was co-dedicated to the first performers, Joachim and Robert Hausmann. In late 1895 both Brahms and Joachim were present at the opening of the new Tonhalle at Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland; Brahms conducted and Joachim was assistant conductor. But in April, two years later, Joachim was to lose forever this revered friend, as Johannes Brahms died at the age of 64 at Vienna. At Meiningen, in December 1899, it was Joachim who made the speech when a statue to Brahms was unveiled. ===Honors and Jubilees=== In March 1877, Joachim received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Cambridge University. For the occasion he presented his Overture in honor of Kleist, Op. 13.Fuller-Maitland p. 56 Near the 50th anniversary of Joachim's debut recital, he was honored by \"friends and admirers in England\"Moser 1901, p. 282 on 16 April 1889 who presented him with \"an exceptionally fine\" violin made in 1715 by Antonio Stradivari, called \"Il Cremonese\".Fuller-Maitland, 1901, p. 18 About ten years later, for the sixtieth jubilee, a concert in honor of Joachim was given by his former students of violin and viola playing and cellists who had studied quartet playing with him, on 22 April 1899.Moser 1901, p. 324 The total of some 140 string players was impressive, as were their instruments (made by Stradivari, Guarneri, Bergonzi, Amati, etc.).Moser 1901, p. 325 An honor such as that concert \"had been accorded to no other musician during his lifetime\". Joseph Joachim, by Philip Alexius de L\u00e1szl\u00f3, 1903 During 1899, Joachim was invited to become president of the newly established Oxford & Cambridge Musical Club in London. He remained club president until his death. In Berlin, on 17 August 1903, Joachim recorded five sides for The Gramophone & Typewriter Ltd (G&T;), which remain a fascinating and valuable source of information about 19th-century styles of violin playing. He is the earliest violinist of distinction known to have recorded, only to be followed soon thereafter when Sarasate made some recordings the following year. Joachim's portrait was twice painted by Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3. A portrait of Joachim was painted by John Singer Sargent and presented to him at the 1904 \"Diamond Jubilee\" celebration of his sixtieth anniversary of his first appearance in London. Joachim remained in Berlin until his death in 1907. At his 75th birthday observance in June 1906, Joachim said > The Germans have four violin concertos. The greatest, most uncompromising is > Beethoven's. The one by Brahms vies with it in seriousness. The richest, the > most seductive, was written by Max Bruch. But the most inward, the heart's > jewel, is Mendelssohn's.Steinberg, p. 265 Bruch wrote three violin concertos. Joachim was presumably referring to his Concerto No. 1, which is the most well-known and frequently performed. Joachim had assisted Bruch in revising that concerto. ==Repertoire== Amalie's and Joseph's grave in Berlin-Charlottenburg Among the most notable of Joachim's achievements were his revival of Beethoven's violin concerto already mentioned, the revival of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin, BWV 1001\u20131006, especially the Chaconne from the Partita No. 2, BWV 1004,Fuller Maitland, p. 25 and of Beethoven's late string quartets.Fuller Maitland, pp. 39, 49 Joachim was the second violinist, after Ferdinand David, to play Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor, which he studied with the composer. Joachim played a pivotal role in the career of Brahms, and remained a tireless advocate of Brahms's compositions through all the vicissitudes of their friendship. He conducted the English premiere of Brahms's Symphony No. 1 in C minor at Cambridge on 8 March 1877, on the same day that he received a D. Mus. degree there (Brahms had declined an invitation to go to England himself).sleeve note, naxos 8.557428, BRAHMS: Sym. No. 1/Tragic Overture/Academic Festival Overture A number of Joachim's composer colleagues, including Schumann, Brahms, Bruch, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, composed concerti with Joachim in mind, many of which entered the standard repertory. Nevertheless, Joachim's solo repertoire remained relatively restricted. He never performed Schumann's Violin Concerto in D minor, which Schumann wrote especially for him, or Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Violin Concerto in A minor, although Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had earnestly solicited his advice about the piece, dedicated it to him, and would have liked him to premiere it. The most unusual work written for Joachim was the F-A-E Sonata, a collaboration between Schumann, Brahms, and Albert Dietrich, based upon the initials of Joachim's motto, Frei aber Einsam (which can be translated as \"free but lonely\", \"free but alone\", or \"free but solitary\"). Although the sonata is rarely performed in its entirety, the third movement, the Scherzo in C minor, composed by Brahms, is still frequently played today. ==Compositions== Joachim's own compositions are less well known. He gave opus numbers to 14 compositions and composed about an equal number of pieces without opus numbers. Among his compositions are various works for the violin (including three concerti) and overtures to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Henry IV. He also wrote cadenzas for a number of other composers' concerti (including the Beethoven and Brahms concerti). His most highly regarded composition is his Hungarian concerto (Violin Concerto No 2 in D minor, Op. 11). Joseph Joachim ===List of compositions=== Fuller-Maitland, p. 56, lists the 14 pieces with opus numbers, not necessarily with the same details as below. On p. 57 he lists 6 of the 14 pieces given here as WoO, plus the orchestration of the Schubert Grand Duo and the Beethoven and Brahms concerto cadenzas. ====Original compositions==== * Op. 1, Andantino and Allegro scherzoso, for violin and piano (1848): dedicated to Joseph B\u00f6hm * Op. 2, Drei St\u00fccke (3 Pieces) for violin or viola and piano, (circa 1848\u20131852): Romanze, Fantasiest\u00fcck, Eine Fr\u00fchlingsfantasie; dedicated to Moritz Hauptmann * Op. 3, Violin Concerto in One Movement, in G minor (1851); dedicated to Franz Liszt * Op. 4, Hamlet Overture (1853); dedicated to Kapelle of Weimar * Op. 5, Three Pieces for Violin and Piano: Lindenrauschen, Abendglocken, Ballade; dedicated to Gisela von Arnim * Op. 6, Demetrius Overture (1853, to a play by Herman Friedrich Grimm; overture dedicated to Franz Liszt) * Op. 7, Henry IV Overture (1854) * Op. 8, Overture to a Comedy by Gozzi (1854); dedicated to Fritz Steinbach. * Op. 9, Hebr\u00e4ische Melodien, nach Eindr\u00fccken der Byron'schen Ges\u00e4nge (Hebrew Melodies, after Impressions of Byron's Songs) for viola and piano (1854\u20131855) * Op. 10, Variationen \u00fcber ein eigenes Thema (Variations on an Original Theme) in E major for viola and piano (1854); dedicated to Hermann Grimm. * Op. 11, Violin Concerto No. 2 in D minor \"in the Hungarian Manner\" (1857, published in 1861); dedicated to Johannes Brahms.
