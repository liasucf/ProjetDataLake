    "text": "Torri Edwards (born January 31, 1977) is an American sprinter. She competes in 100 and 200 meters, winning an Olympic medal in 4\u00d7100-meter relay in 2000. In 2003, she won six medals in major international competitions, including one World Championship gold. Edwards competed in the 100 m at the 2008 Olympic Games. ==Early career== Edwards states that she began sprinting when she joined her school team in junior high . Edwards was an average sprinter when she attended Pomona High School, with her best state meet finish ever coming her senior year when she was fourth in the 200m. Edwards would then attend the University of Southern California.USC OLYMPIANS: 1904-2008, USC Trojans Athletic Department, Accessed August 26, 2008. That track season, she won the Pac-10 titles in both the 100 m and 200 m for USC. She states: > Not until I got to college did I realize that I could be good,...Winning the > Pac-10 titles gave me a big boost in confidence, and I found myself setting > higher and higher goals. ==Doping ban== She was banned for two years effective from July 18, 2004, missing the 2004 Summer Olympics. In August 2004, Edwards appealed the ban, and an arbitration panel acknowledged that Edwards \"conducted herself with honesty, integrity and character ... she has not sought to gain any improper advantage or to 'cheat' in any way.\" In November 2005, her two-year ban was shortened to 15 months when the World Anti-Doping Agency downgraded nikethamide infractions to maximum one-year suspensions. The drug had come from pills she had taken at a meet in Martinique to combat a minor illness. Though arbitrators decided Edwards had taken the drug inadvertently, saying in their ruling that she had conducted herself with \"honesty, integrity and character,\" they did not overturn the suspension, because the glucose tablets given to her by her doctor contained a warning for athletes advising that the pills could cause a positive doping test. Therefore, Edwards did not take performance enhancement drugs to improve her performance.USADA Sanctions. USADA. Retrieved on 2015-01-23. However, since Edwards was a teammate of Marion Jones in the 2000 Olympic 4\u00d7100 meters relay, she was stripped of her medal following Jones's admission to using steroids during the games, though she and 6 other members of the 2000 team would successfully appeal this decision in July 2010. ==Personal bests== *100 meters - 10.78 (2008) *200 meters - 22.28 (2003 ==2008 Olympics== At the 2008 Olympic finals for the women's 100 meters, Edwards stated that she thought she had false started and apparently hesitated, believing that the officials were going to call a false start. Edwards eventually finished eighth place with a time of 11.20, an under-par performance for the American sprinter, who has a best time of 10.78. Edwards states: > I thought I moved before the gun,...I kind of hesitated because I expected > to hear a second gun. It threw me off a lot. It's pretty tough. However, Edwards actually had a reaction time of 0.179 seconds, which was not the fastest or the slowest of the eight runners.100 Metres - Women's Final. IAAF. 17 August 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2008 It is possible, therefore, that Edwards had not applied enough pressure on the blocks to trigger a false start warning, however she twitched her upper body, but possibly left her feet solid.\"When is a false start not a false start?. Reuters India. August 18, 2008. Retrieved August 24. 2008 Another disappointment came in the 4\u00d7100 m relay when the American team dropped the baton in the semi-final due to a misunderstanding between Edwards, on the top bend, and Lauryn Williams on the anchor leg. Williams picked up the baton to finish the race in last place, but the USA was disqualified because she had had to run out of her lane in order to retrieve the baton. ==International competitions== {| |- |2000 |Summer Olympics |Sydney, Australia |bgcolor=\"CC9966\" | 3rd |4\u00d7100 m relay |DQ - doping by Marion Jones |- |rowspan=6|2003 |World Indoor Championships |Birmingham, United Kingdom |bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd |60 m | |- |rowspan=3|World Championships |rowspan=3|Paris, France |bgcolor=\"gold\"| 1st |100 m | 10.93 PB |- |bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd |200 m | |- |bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd |4\u00d7100 m relay | |- |rowspan=2|World Athletics Final |rowspan=2|Monte Carlo, Monaco |bgcolor=\"CC9966\"| 3rd |100 m | |- |bgcolor=\"CC9966\"| 3rd |200 m | |- |2008 |Olympic Games |Beijing, China |8th |100 m |} ==Coaching career== Torri Edwards was just named head track coach at Kentucky State University in August 2015.
