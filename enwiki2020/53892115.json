    "text": "\"Leave Virginia Alone\" is a 1995 song written by Tom Petty and performed by Rod Stewart off Stewart's album A Spanner in the Works. The song reached number one on the Canadian RPM Top Singles and Adult Contemporary charts in 1995. It also reached number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 53 in Australia. ==Background== \"Leave Virginia Alone\" was originally meant to be on Tom Petty's studio album Wildflowers, but the track did not make the album. In a Billboard interview with Rod Stewart, Stewart revealed that Petty's manager gave him the song when Petty believed the track was too similar to a previous hit of his. \"Leave Virginia Alone\" was added to Stewart's album A Spanner in the Works after the audio mastering was finished and was the first single for the album. ==Release== On May 13, 1995, Stewart debuted \"Leave Virginia Alone\" on Saturday Night Lives twentieth-season finale. ==Reception== \"Leave Virginia Alone\" received positive reviews from critics. Popdose said the song was a \"solid song with a fitting vocal performance\" while Billboard complimented the connection between Rod Stewart's voice with the beats and acoustic guitars of the track. All the same, Stewart admitted to Billboard that at first, he did not like the song and had to be convinced to record the track. ==Music video== In the music video, a woman runs away from people wearing costumes after holding a press conference. In an article in the Chicago Tribune, Susan Alexander said \"Leave Virginia Alone\" fit the music video format of having a \"bad girl\" who uses emotional manipulation. A few years later in Michigan Sociological Review, Alexander said she believed the woman in the video committed a sinful act, and the lyrics of \"Leave Virginia Alone\" point towards drug abuse and promiscuity. ==Wildflowers & All The Rest== Leave Virginia Alone, this time sung by the writer Tom Petty, would later appear on the track list for the posthumous album released by his estate, Wildflowers & All The Rest. The song was released as a single from the album on October 1, 2020. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |53 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |40 |- |- |- |} ===Year end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |20 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |10 |} ==See also== * List of number-one singles of 1995 (Canada) ==References== Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:1995 singles Category:Rod Stewart songs Category:Songs written by Tom Petty Category:1995 songs Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles ",
