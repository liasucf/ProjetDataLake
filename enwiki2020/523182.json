During a NATO-sponsored training seminar in Budapest, Safarov broke into Margaryan's dormitory room at night and axed Margaryan to death while he was asleep. In 2006, Safarov was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Hungary with a minimum incarceration period of 30 years. After his request under the Strasbourg Convention, he was extradited on August 31, 2012 to Azerbaijan, where he was greeted as a hero, pardoned by Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev despite contrary assurances made to Hungary, promoted to the rank of major and given an apartment and over eight years of back pay. According to Azerbaijani authorities, Safarov was pardoned in compliance with Article 12 of the convention. Following Safarov's pardon, Armenia severed diplomatic relations with Hungary and immediate protests broke out in Yerevan. The extradition was widely condemned by international organizations and governments of many countries, including the US, Russia and France. ==Early life== Ramil Safarov was born on August 25, 1977 in the town of Jabrayil, former Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic of Soviet Union (now Azerbaijan) where he finished middle school. He is one of four brothers. Jabrayil was occupied by Armenian forces on August 26, 1993, and remained under control of Nagorno-Karabakh army as part of the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict until October 4, 2020. Safarov's family fled to Baku in 1991. During a court hearing, Safarov recounted memories from the years of war, during which he had lost family members. This, however, contradicted another version he told the court, where he stated that he was studying in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku and in Turkey from 1992 to 1996. He continued his studies at Maltepe Military High School in \u0130zmir and then at the Turkish Military Academy, graduating in 2000, after which he returned to Azerbaijan.Gunel Abilova. 'Ramil Said He'd Never Commit Suicide' . Markaz.az. 26 August 2012. Retrieved 1 September 2012. ==Budapest murder== In January 2004, the 26-year-old Ramil Safarov, along with another officer from Azerbaijan, went to Budapest (Hungary), to participate in the three-month English language courses, organized by NATO's Partnership for Peace program for military personnel from different countries. Two Armenian officers, a 25-year-old Gurgen Margaryan and Hayk Makuchyan, also participated in this program. On the evening of February 18, Safarov bought an axe and a honing stone at Tesco, near Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s Stadium. He took them in the bag to his dormitory room at the Zrinyi Miklos National Defence University, where all the course participants were staying. Safarov's roommate had returned to his native Ukraine to attend the funerals of his relatives and so nobody interrupted Safarov as he sharpened the axe in his room. At around 5:00 am on February 19 Safarov took the axe and went to Margaryan's room, which he was sharing with his Hungarian roommate, Bal\u00e1zs Kuti. The door of their room was not locked. Safarov attacked the sleeping Margaryan with the axe and delivered 16 blows to his body, which almost severed Margaryan\u2019s head. The noises woke up Kuti, who was shocked seeing the Azerbaijani officer standing by Gurgen\u2019s bed with a long axe in his hands. As Kuti later testified, \u201cBy that time I understood that something terrible had happened for there was blood all around. I started to shout at the Azerbaijani urging him to stop it. He said that he had no problems with me and would not touch me, stabbed Gurgen a couple of more times and left. The expression of his face was as if he was glad he had finished something important. Greatly shocked, I ran out of the room to find help, and Ramil went in another direction\u201d. Afterwards, Safarov headed for the room of Makuchyan, the other Armenian student, with the intention of attacking him also, but found his door locked.safarov.org The murderAsbarez. Safarov Trial Resumes in Budapest He shouted out Makuchyan\u2019s name in a threatening voice. The half-sleeping Makuchyan wanted to open the door, but his Lithuanian roommate stopped him and called his compatriot next door to check what was going on. Meanwhile, Safarov went to look for Hayk in the room of the Serbian and the Ukrainian roommates, showing them the blood- stained axe and stating that he thirsted for nobody's blood but Armenian. Safarov then attempted to break the door with the axe, but, by this time, the students in the neighboring rooms already woke up, went out to the corridor and tried to persuade him to stop. Later the eyewitnesses confessed that they were afraid to approach Ramil with a blood-stained axe closer than at three meters. Soon after, the Hungarian police, which was summoned by Bal\u00e1zs Kuti, arrived and arrested Safarov at the scene. A Hungarian court later found that it was an attempt on Makuchyan\u2019s life and recognized the latter also as a victim.panarmenian.net Safarov victim Hayk Makuchyan to apply to European institutions While announcing the verdict the judge particularly emphasized that if Safarov had not been restrained by his fellow officers he would have killed the second Armenian officer as well.BBC News [Hungary jails Azerbaijani killer http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4907552.stm] ===Interrogation and trial=== During his initial interrogation Safarov confessed to killing Margaryan and his intention to kill Makuchyan. Questioned about his motives during the interrogation, Safarov stated: According to Bal\u00e1zs Kuti, at the very beginning of the language courses, when the students got acquainted, there was a conversation about different international issues, but nobody spoke of it afterwards. Kuti also said that he had not noticed any strain in the relationship between Margaryan and the Azerbaijani officers. Makuchyan's neighbor, officer Saulius Paulius also said that he observed nothing strange in the relationship between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani guys. The police afterwards interrogated all the students and all testified that there was no conflict between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani officers and that they did not even interact with each other. Later in an interview to the Armenian newspaper \u201cIravunk\u201d Hayk Makuchyan confirmed that neither Gurgen nor him had had any contacts with any of the Azerbaijani officers. \u201cThey were not of a communicative type. Usually, after classes, they went straight to their rooms\u201d, said Hayk. To the question as to why he chose to attack Margaryan first Safarov answered it was because he was big, muscular and of sportive type. When the case went to trial Safarov's defense asserted that the murder was committed because Margaryan had insulted the Azerbaijani flag. This explanation later underwent several variations in the press in Azerbaijan and among his defenders. It was claimed that Margaryan and/or Makuchyan had urinated on the Azerbaijani flag; used it to clean and wipe their shoes; and had played an audio recording of \"voices of suffering Azerbaijani women and girls.\"Pearce, Katy. \"Deep Dive: Filling In The Gaps -- Reading The Ramil Safarov Case In Azerbaijan.\" RFE/RL. September 10, 2012. Retrieved September 14, 2012. Safarov did not mention any of this in either his interrogation or his court trial and made it very clear he killed Margaryan just because he was an Armenian. No witnesses were ever called during the trial to corroborate these allegations of harassment in court and prosecution lawyers strongly disputed that they had taken place.Amnesty International Azerbaijan: Government sends dangerous message on ethnically-motivated violence Despite the lack of evidence the Azerbaijani media, including state-owned media outlets, have circulated the version of the flag for making Safarov a national hero. The defense also alleged that Safarov was mentally sick when committing the murder, however the forensic medical examination, which was upheld by the judge, showed that \"Safarov was sane and aware of the consequences of his act\".Panorama 04/03/2013. Hero-murderer Ramil Safarov told about his bodily fear towards Armenians On April 13, 2006, a Hungarian court sentenced Safarov to life imprisonment without right of appeal for 30 years. The judge, Andras Vaskuti, cited the premeditated nature and brutality of the crime and the fact that Safarov showed no remorse for his deeds as the reasons for the sentence. Handing down a life sentence, the judge particularly emphasised that \u201cthe murder of a sleeping man in peace time is always a crime and cannot be an act of heroism\u201d. On February 22, 2007, a Hungarian appeal court upheld the ruling following an appeal filed by Safarov's lawyer. While serving his sentence, Safarov translated several novels by Hungarian authors into Azeri, including Magda Szab\u00f3's The Door ()Ramil Safarov Translated Another Work by Hungarian Writer. Day.az. 14 September 2011. and The Paul Street Boys () (youth novel by the Hungarian writer Ferenc Moln\u00e1r). ===Reaction to the murder and the sentence=== A lawyer representing the victim's family welcomed the sentence as a \"good decision for the Hungarian court and for Armenian society.\" Many officials in Azerbaijan publicly praised Safarov's actions, while there were also those who condemned them. Elmira S\u00fcleymanova, the human rights commissioner (ombudsman) of Azerbaijan, declared that Safarov's punishment was far too harsh and that \"Safarov must become an example of patriotism for the Azerbaijani youth\".\u201cZerkalo\u201d Newspaper, Baku, 28.02.2004 The banned radical Azerbaijan National Democrat Party awarded Safarov with the title of \"Man of the Year 2005\" for killing an Armenian. Fuad Agayev, a prominent Azeri lawyer, said that Azeris \"...have to urgently stop this current campaign to raise Safarov to the rank of national hero. He is no hero.\u201d The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs condemned Azerbaijan's reaction to the brutal murder of the Armenian officer in a hearing. A report which was published by the Committee on Foreign Affairs contained a statement by Bryan Ardouny, Executive Director of the Armenian Assembly of America, who stated that \"The Azerbaijani government has also consistently failed to condemn Safarov, an Azeri military officer who in 2003 [sic] brutally murdered an Armenian participant at a NATO Partnership for Peace military training exercise in Budapest, Hungary. Instead, it has encouraged domestic media and various organizations to treat the murderer as a celebrity. That individual has since been awarded the title of 'Man of the Year' by Azerbaijan\u2019s National- Democratic Party.\" ==Extradition and pardon== ===Safarov's welcome in Azerbaijan=== After serving eight years of the life sentence, Safarov was extradited under the framework guidelines of the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and transferred to Azerbaijan on August 31, 2012. Although the Hungarian government stated that it had received assurances from the Azerbaijan government that the remainder of the sentence would be enforced, President Ilham Aliyev issued a pardon immediately upon Safarov's arrival in Baku and ordered that he be \"freed from the term of his punishment.\" Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev promoted Safarov to the rank of major and the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan provided him with an apartment and over eight years of back pay. On September 1, Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Elman Abdullayev said that the return of Safarov to Azerbaijan is a matter of relations between Azerbaijan and Hungary, which was resolved in the \"framework of the law and is not contrary to norms and principles of the international law.\" He described Sargsyan's statements as \"hysterical\" and accused him of being one of the leaders of the group that committed the Khojaly Massacre. After arriving in Baku, Safarov stated: \"This is restoration of justice. It was a bit of surprise for me.\" He then visited Martyrs' Lane to lay flowers at the tomb of Azerbaijan's former president Heydar Aliyev. He also laid flowers at the Eternal Flame monument and visited a monument to Turkish soldiers. Novruz Mammadov, the head of the presidential foreign relations department, said that secret talks had been going on for a year between Azerbaijan and Hungary, and that agreement had been reached on the visit of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. A week before Safarov's release there came reports that the two countries were in talks over a loan from Azerbaijan to Hungary of 2-3bn euros ($2.5-3.8bn; \u00a31.6-2.4bn) which gave way to speculations in Hungary that Orb\u00e1n extradited Safarov in return for a promise that Azerbaijan would buy Hungarian bonds.Euobserver 03.09.12.

It is murder on ethnic grounds,\" he said. Sargsyan suggested the possibility that Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n had entered into a secret agreement during the latter's visit to Baku on June 30, 2012. A number of sources in the media have also speculated that Hungary's deepening economic ties with Azerbaijan may have had something to do with Safarov's release. Sargsyan concluded his statements by saying, \"with their joint actions the authorities of Hungary and Azerbaijan have opened the door for the recurrence of such crimes.\" Demonstrations took place in front of the Hungarian consulate in Yerevan, during which the building was pelted with tomatoes. Demonstrators also burned a Hungarian flag. A photo of Safarov was also burned by the activists. National Assembly Speaker Hovik Abrahamyan cancelled his visit to Hungary planned for late September. Hayk Makuchyan, whom Safarov unsuccessfully planned to kill on the same night as Margaryan, stated that he will petition to all judicial instances and possibly The Hague, since the murder was committed on ethnic grounds, adding: \"I had no doubt that Ramil Safarov would not have served his sentence in the case of an extradition. But the Azerbaijani leadership\u2019s cynicism surpassed everything.\" ====Hungary==== On September 2 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary announced the country \"refuses to accept and condemns the action of Azerbaijan, which contradicts the relevant rules of international law and sharply contrasts the undertaking of the Azerbaijani side in this matter, confirmed by the Deputy Minister of Justice of the Republic of Azerbaijan in his letter <...> of 15 August 2012.\" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the action of Azerbaijan in a diplomatic note. The press release also states that \"Hungary regards the decision of Azerbaijan inconsistent with the spirit of cooperation based on mutual trust that has been achieved during the past years between our respective countries.\" The opposition parties strongly criticized Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his cabinet for the move. Despite government denials, opposition parties said Orb\u00e1n let Safarov return to Azerbaijan in the hope of economic favors in return from the energy producer Azerbaijan.Reuters, 18 Sep 2012 Reuters INSIGHT-Hungarians impatiently await promised \"fairy tale\" Representatives of MSZP, the then largest opposition party, called for various subcommittees of the parliament to examine who exactly made the decision and why the procedure was kept secret.

The noted journalist Khadija Ismayilova, Radio Liberty's lead correspondent in Azerbaijan, commented that what Safarov had done was \"awful\" and the reaction of seeing him as a hero \"happens when society is not allowed to do anything.
