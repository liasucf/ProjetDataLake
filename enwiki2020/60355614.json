All this activity is in preparation for Uganda's first oil, expected in 2023. The twelve roads are collectively referred to as the \"Oil Roads\". ==Upgrading to bitumen== The government of Uganda has earmarked this road and two other roads for upgrading through the conversion of the existing gravel road to bitumen surface and the building of bridges and drainage channels. China Railway Seventh Group has been contracted by the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), to upgrade (a) Hohwa\u2013Nyairongo\u2013Kyarushesha\u2013Butole Road (b) Kabaale\u2013Kizirafumbi Road and (c) Masindi\u2013Biso Road. The three roads are budgeted to cost USh504 billion (approx. US$137 million). ==Timeline and funding== The contractor agreed to start work in May 2019 and proceed for one year, without upfront payment. After one year, the government will pay for any completed work and pay for any subsequent work, as completed. In the meantime, the government is expected to search for a lender to fund the construction. Construction of all three roads is expected to last three years. ==See also== * Economy of Uganda ==References== ==External links== * Uganda National Road Authority Homepage * Oil Sparks Roads Upgrade * List of Oil Roads As of 11 December 2017.
