    "text": "Candelariella vitellina is a common and widespread green-yellow to orange- yellow crustose areolate lichen that grows on rock, wood, and bark, all over the world.Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert Region. Vol 2, Nash, T.H., Ryan, B.D., Gries, C., Bugartz, F., (eds.) 2001, It grows on non- calcareous rock, wood, and bark. It often has tiny lobate areoles in the shape of lion claws. The areoles may be flat or convex. Its sexual reproduction structures (apothecia) are a 0.35\u20131.0 mm-wide disc, darker yellow than the thallus, rimmed with thallus-like tissue lecanorine, flat but becoming convex with age. Lichen spot tests are K+ reddish, KC-, and C-. It produces calycin, pulvinic acid, pulvinic dilactone and vulpinic acid as secondary metabolites. In California, it prefers growing on granite, but can also be found on wood (rarely on bark) and other kinds of rock.Field Guide to California Lichens, Stephen Sharnoff, Yale University Press, 2014, Candelariella vitellina looks like a miniature version of C. rosulans. It can be distinguished by C. vitanela having a visible exciple (the rim around the apothecia disc), which C. rosulans does not have. It is usually much larger and thicker than the similar C. lutella. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Lecanoromycetes Category:Fungi described in 1785 Category:Fungi of North America ",
