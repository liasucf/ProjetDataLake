    "text": "Jocelyn and Chris are sibling blues-rock music artists from Upstate New York. Jocelyn sings lead vocals and plays piano, while Chris plays lead and rhythm guitar. The two write all of their music together as a brother-sister team. ==Biography== ===Group history=== Jocelyn and Chris grew up in Fort Plain, a small town in rural upstate New York. The two siblings both began music lessons in elementary school. Jocelyn started learning piano in fourth grade after receiving her first electric keyboard. Chris began guitar lessons just a few months later. Jocelyn and Chris began performing publicly at local talent shows, festivals, and fairs. Their first public performance was at a local benefit talent show when Jocelyn was 12 and Chris was 11, where they performed a cover of Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\". In middle school, they formed their own band \"The Dependents.\u201d They were performing under this moniker at the Fonda Fair in Fonda, NY, when they were approached by producer/manager David Bourgeois. The two subsequently signed a development deal with Bourgeois' music development company, Bridge Road Entertainment, in Albany, NY, in 2013. In the following years, Jocelyn & Chris have released two studio EPs (\"Strangers in Fairyland\" and \"Still: A Holiday Collection\"), two full- length albums (\"Edges\" and \"Go\"), and a live LP \"30,000 Miles,\" all under Bridge Road Entertainment. Their third full-length album The Fun in the Fight is slated for release on February 22, 2019. ===Musical inspiration=== Jocelyn & Chris grew up listening to a large variety of music, including blues, jazz, folk, rock, and pop. The duo frequently credit their parents' large CD collection with having had a huge impact on their current musical style. When they began to write their own original music together in middle school, this diverse range of musical influences led to the formation of a distinctive sound that has been described as \"an affinity for retro grooves and classic rock moves with a unique, modern twist.\" ===Education=== In addition to their musical careers, both Jocelyn and Chris are alumni of Harvard University. Jocelyn graduated in May 2017, while Chris graduated a year later in May 2018. ===Television=== In a 2017 interview with Music Connection Magazine, Jocelyn revealed that she has been approached by casting agents from NBC's The Voice on two separate occasions. In both cases she declined to pursue the opportunity, opting instead to continue to write, record, and tour with her brother and their band. A December 2017 EdgeTV Network article about the group's music video for single \"Red Stops Traffic\" revealed that Jocelyn had also turned down an opportunity to appear on the new FOX music competition show The Four. On March 7, 2019, Jocelyn & Chris and their band performed their song \"Outta My Head\" live on NBC's Today Show. ===Personal life=== In high school, both siblings worked at Gore Mountain in North Creek, New York, Jocelyn as a ski instructor and Chris as a snowboard instructor. ==Notable performances== Along with their band, Jocelyn and Chris have performed at hundreds of music festivals and venues across the country, including the Sundance Film Festival, the CMJ Music Festival in NYC, Mountain Jam Festival in Woodstock, NY, South by Southwest in Austin, TX, and Summerfest in Milwaukee, WI, where they were voted Best Act on the Emerging Artists Stage. Additionally, the group has played music venues such as The Viper Room and Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood, CA, 3rd and Lindsley in Nashville, TN, Higher Ground in Burlington, VT, and The Bitter End and Rockwood Music Hall in NYC. They have provided direct support for X Ambassadors, Eve 6, Delta Rae, Gin Blossoms, Vertical Horizon, Rick Derringer, Orleans, Dennis DeYoung, Marc Cohn, Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers, and others.\"Jocelyn & Chris Arndt.\" Reverbnation.
