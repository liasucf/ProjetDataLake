It has 0.2\u20131.5 mm round to angular areoles which may be lobed, and may be contiguous or dispersed. It grows on acidic rocks, basalt, and sometimes on wood. It is one of the most common members of its genus in the Sonoran Desert region, common in Arizona, southern California, Baja California north and south, Sonora, to outside the region in Durango. Each areole bears one to many 0.1\u20131 mm rounded to angular apothecia that are deeply immersed in the areole, with a dull reddish-brown flat to convex disc.
