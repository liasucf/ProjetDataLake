    "text": "Azobisisobutyronitrile (abbreviated AIBN) is an organic compound with the formula [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2. This white powder is soluble in alcohols and common organic solvents but is insoluble in water. It is often used as a foamer in plastics and rubber and as a radical initiator. ==Mechanism== In its most characteristic reaction, AIBN decomposes, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas to form two 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radicals: :480px These radicals can initiate free-radical polymerizations and other radical-induced reactions. For instance, a mixture of styrene and maleic anhydride in toluene will react if heated, forming the copolymer upon addition of AIBN. Another example of a radical reaction that can be initiated by AIBN is the anti-Markovnikov hydrohalogenation of alkenes. ==Production and analogues== AIBN is produced from acetone cyanohydrin and hydrazine, then followed by oxidation: :2 (CH3)2C(CN)OH + N2H4 \u2192 [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2H2 \\+ 2 H2O : [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2H2 \\+ Cl2 \u2192 [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2 \\+ 2 HCl Related azo compounds behave similarly, such as 1,1\u2032-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile). Water-soluble azo initiators are also available.Water soluble Azo initiators ==Safety== AIBN is safer to use than benzoyl peroxide (another radical initiator) because the risk of explosion is far less. However, it is still considered as an explosive compound, decomposing above 65 \u00b0C. A respirator dust mask, protective gloves and safety glasses are recommended. Pyrolysis of AIBN without a trap for the formed 2-cyanopropyl radicals results in the formation of tetramethylsuccinonitrile, which is highly toxic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Azo compounds Category:Polymer chemistry Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Radical initiators ",
