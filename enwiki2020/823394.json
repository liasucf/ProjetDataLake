January by urban areas The Mobile StatBank from Statistics Denmark. It is located in the northeastern part of Region Sj\u00e6lland, Denmark. Holb\u00e6k is located on Zealand, on the banks of Holb\u00e6k Fjord, an inlet of the larger Isefjord. Holb\u00e6k is a commercial and industrial center for the surrounding area. By rail, Holb\u00e6k is served by Danske Statsbaner's line from Roskilde to Kalundborg, which runs through the city. Vestsj\u00e6llands Lokalbaner connects Holb\u00e6k by rail to Nyk\u00f8bing Sj\u00e6lland. The city is a major hub for the Movia bus routes. Holb\u00e6k has an active commercial seaport that serves as the harbor for the ferry to Or\u00f8 (island). Near the harbor there is a substantial marina. ==History== City Seal ca. 1400 A street market Holb\u00e6k is first mentioned in official documents in Absalon's letter of 8 June 1199, in which he granted the majority of his estates to Sor\u00f8 Klosterkirke in Sor\u00f8. It was called Holb\u00e6kgaard, a larger farm belonging to a nobleman, around which the city eventually developed. Next it appears in Valdemar the Victorious's book of properties (see Kong Valdemars Jordebog on the Danish Wikipedia) in 1231. Valdmar broke ground for Holb\u00e6k Slot (Holb\u00e6k Castle) in 1236. Holb\u00e6k grew from then on but is not mentioned again until around 1400 when Margaret I came for a court proceeding that granted her territories in Jutland. The event may have triggered the creation of the first city seal, which shows the three trees by the water that are the prominent features of the current seal. ==Economy== Companies headquartered in Holb\u00e6k include Sparekassen Sj\u00e6lland. ==Culture== Culturally, Holb\u00e6k can be noted for Musikhus Elv\u00e6rket, a converted power station that serves as a concert venue for modern music. ==Sport== The city is home to the Holb\u00e6k B&I; football club. ==Notable people== Ludvig Christian de Brinck Seidelin, 1832 === Public Service & public thinking === * S\u00f8ren Nielsen May (died 1679 in Holb\u00e6k) parish priest and provost in Holb\u00e6k * Albert Borgard (1659\u20131751) a Danish artillery and engineer officer Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 05, Borgard, Albert retrieved 06 June 2020 * Michael Bille (1680 - 1756 in Holb\u00e6k) a Danish Admiral * Christen Friis Rottb\u00f8ll (1727 at H\u00f8rbyg\u00e5rd \u2013 1797) a Danish physician and botanist * Ole Johansen Winstrup (1782 in Winstrup - 1867) a self-taught Danish engineer and inventor * Ludvig Christian Brinck-Seidelin (1787 in Eriksholm - 1865) a Danish civil servant, landowner and politician. * Ludwig A.
