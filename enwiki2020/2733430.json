    "text": "John Frederick Coots (May 2, 1897 \u2013 April 8, 1985) was an American songwriter. He composed over 700 popular songs and over a dozen Broadway shows. In 1934, Coots wrote the melody with his then chief collaborator, lyricist Haven Gillespie, for the biggest hit for them both \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town.\" The song became one of the biggest sellers in American history. In 1934, when Gillespie brought him the lyrics to \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\", Coots came up with the skeleton of the music in just ten minutes. Coots took the song to his publisher, Leo Feist Inc., who liked it but thought it was \"a kids' song\" and didn't expect too much from it. Coots offered the song to Eddie Cantor who used it on his radio show that November and it became an instant hit. The morning after the radio show there were orders for 100,000 copies of sheet music and by Christmas sales had passed 400,000. == Career timeline == : 1897 May 2 \u2013 born in Brooklyn, New York : 1914 (age 17) \u2013 began work with Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. in New York : 1916 (age 20) \u2013 first hit song published, \"Mr. Ford You've Got the Right Idea,\" words by Ray Sherwood, music by Coots; A.
