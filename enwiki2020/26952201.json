    "text": "AeroUnion Flight 302, operated by an Airbus A300B4-203F cargo aircraft, crashed in poor weather on final approach at General Mariano Escobedo International Airport, Monterrey, Mexico around 23:18 CDT on 13 April 2010, after a flight from Mexico City. All five persons on board were killed, as well as one on the ground. ==Aircraft involved== The aircraft involved was built in 1979 and after service with a number of operators was leased to Aerouni\u00f3n \u2013 Aerotransporte de Carga Uni\u00f3n in April 2002 and registered as XA- TUE. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had flown for 55,200 hours and made 27,600 landings. ==Accident== At about 23:18 local time on 13 April (04:18 UTC on 14 April), AeroUnion Flight 302 executed a missed approach after a landing attempt and crashed The Airbus A300B4-203F was on a scheduled international freight service from Mexico City International Airport via General Mariano Escobedo International Airport, Monterrey, to Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles. The crew had been cleared to land the aircraft on runway 11 at Mariano Escobedo Airport, but it crashed onto the Avenida Miguel Alem\u00e1n motorway, almost 2 km short of the runway threshold. It struck a car, killing the driver. The airplane broke up and burst into flames. All five occupants of the aircraft were killed. There was a storm that caused windshear and heavy rain, with a ceiling varying between 500 and 800 feet. The METAR in force at the time of the accident stated visibility of 7 miles with light rain. Cloud cover was \"broken\" at 2,500 ft, overcast at 5,000. with intra-cloud lightning observed. ==Investigation== The Direction General of Civil Aeronautics (DGAC) of the Ministry of Communications and Transportation of Mexico (SCT) opened an investigation into the accident. Assistance was provided by Airbus, the aircraft's manufacturer; and by France's aircraft accident investigation body, the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile (BEA). The investigation noted that on final approach the speed decreased to 110 knots (more than 20 knots below typical final approach speed) followed by the crew pulling the control column which resulted in further speed decay and increased angle of attack. The stick shaker, stall warning and Alpha Floor protection activated and caused the engines to accelerate to maximum thrust. In response to the pitch up moment produced by the accelerating engines the control column was pushed forward however the trim was at 10.25 degrees nose up and was not adjusted. The aircraft pitched up reaching an angle of attack of 41 degrees, the speed decayed to 70 knots, the stick shaker and stall warning activated again, the control column was at its forward stop, and the aircraft began to descend. During the last 10 seconds of flight the control column was reversed to its backward stop while the aircraft was losing height until impact. ==See Also== *China Airlines flight 140, another Airbus A300 that stalled on approach in Japan due to pilot error. ==References== ==External links== * \"Accident to Flight 302 on 13 April 2010 A 300-B4, registered XA-TUE.\" Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile * \"AERO UNION CARGO FLIGHT 302 ACCIDENT NEAR MONTERREY MEXICO.\" Airbus * Secretariat of Communications and Transportation of Mexico ** \"Comunicado de Prensa No. 055.- Inicia investigaci\u00f3n del avi\u00f3n siniestrado en Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\" (Archive) ** \"ACCIDENTE AEREO \u2013 AIRBUS A300 B4F.\" Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Mexico Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A300 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2010 Category:2010 in Mexico Category:April 2010 events in Mexico ",
