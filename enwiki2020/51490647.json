Formerly a small pond, Dyken Pond was enlarged to its current size in 1902 after a dam was built to regulate water power and reduce flooding. The dam was constructed by the Manning Paper Company, who later donated their land holdings in the vicinity of the pond to Rensselaer County in 1973. That land became part of the Dyken Pond Environmental Education Center, a property that is accessible to the public for the purpose of outdoor education and low-impact recreation. The pond facilitates fishing for chain pickerel and panfish, and ice fishing is permitted. ==References== ==External links== * Dyken Pond Environmental Education Center Category:Lakes of Rensselaer County, New York Category:Lakes of New York (state) Category:Protected areas of Rensselaer County, New York ",
