Initially, Rogue only sold other manufacturers' equipment through its website so that everything could be found and purchased in one spot, but there were still issues with customers having to deal with multiple manufacturers and their own shipping fees and schedules. Rogue began warehousing the equipment and ultimately building it themselves. The company grew into a facility in Columbus that was next to the CrossFit box that Henniger also owned. Rogue began offering more products and also started manufacturing more of them. Rogue Europe launched in Finland in January 2014 with Juha Puonti and 2009 CrossFit Games male champion Mikko Salo. ==Today== Rogue previously operated out of a manufacturing facility and is one of the primary suppliers for equipment for CrossFit boxes around the world. Rogue has been building and providing all the equipment to the CrossFit Games and regional events since 2010. Fifteen semi-trucks of equipment were needed to supply the 2013 CrossFit Games at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, up from nine trucks used to supply the 2011 CrossFit Games. They also build equipment for Strongman, Powerlifting, and Olympic weightlifting. The company sponsors numerous CrossFit athletes around the world, such as Rich Froning Jr., Ben Smith, Camille Leblanc-Bazinet, Mat Fraser, Katr\u00edn Dav\u00ed\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, and Jason Khalipa. One of the first sponsored athletes was Henniger's future wife and 2008 CrossFit Games female champion, Caity Matter Henniger. Rogue also sponsors Strongman athletes such as Brian Shaw and Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson. Rogue was a contender for Inc.'s 2018 Company of the Year. In 2018, Rogue moved into a building a structure on of the former Timken Company property located on the southwest corner of East Fifth and Cleveland avenues in Columbus. The new building will consolidate their administrative, manufacturing, distribution, and retail operations. It includes two gyms and showroom. As of 2019, Rogue Fitness had 600 employees. ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Exercise equipment companies Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area Category:Manufacturing companies based in Ohio Category:Manufacturing companies established in 2007 Category:Privately held companies based in Ohio Category:2007 establishments in Ohio Category:CrossFit Category:Organizations based in Columbus, Ohio ",
