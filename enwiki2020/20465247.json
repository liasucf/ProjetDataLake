The book opens on Floss's birthday when Sally and Steve take her to TGI Friday's, and tell her that they are going to Australia for six months because of Steve's job. Floss wants to go with them, but she doesn't want to leave Charlie who's a cheerful and fun dad, who runs his own caf\u00e9 (named Charlie's but the c came off so it shows Harlie's) which is quickly going out of business. Floss convinces Sally that she can live with Charlie, while they are in Australia. Floss has a tough time getting used to life without her mother since her father is not used to taking care of Floss seven days a week and she is not used to his home seven days a week, either. Floss's school uniforms get dirtier and disarrayed as Charlie is not used to washing and ironing them, but her teacher, Mrs. Horsefield, helps her out, as Floss is one of her personal favourite students The father and daughter learn to cope and meet Rose, a very caring woman who works at a fair. After Rose leaves (traveling with the fair), they keep an eye out for her fair. Meanwhile, a regular customer at the caf\u00e9 Billy the Chip puts money on a horse that Floss selects, and he wins money on the horse. After losing the caf\u00e9 and the flat, Billy the Chip mentions he is going to Australia to visit his son for one month and needs Floss and Charlie to live in his house while Charlie works in Billy's chip van. However, one day, a group of \"yobbos\" (as Charlie calls them) fight Rose's son Saul and when he attempts to stop the fistfight, the van catches on fire with Floss trapped inside. Charlie fights his way through the fire and rescues her, while in the process burning his hands. Floss also has a best friend, Rhiannon, who isn't much of a friend \u2013 making fun of her and her father and starting cruel rumours about her. Floss ends her friendship with Rhiannon and finds a new friend, Susan, who is interested in all her favourite things. When the fair comes back in town, Rose and Charlie consider dating, and Floss finds out both are interested in each other and get along well, while Rose lets Floss help her in the candyfloss stall. Later, Susan, along with her parents, goes to stay in her holiday home in France and says farewell to Floss at the beginning of summer. The book closes with Floss thinking about dying her hair pink (like candy floss). == Characters== ===Flora \"Floss\" Barnes=== A generally happy and bubbly girl who sometimes struggles to stand up for herself.
