    "text": "During the Parade of Nations section of the 1984 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, athletes from the participating countries marched into the arena. Each delegation was led by a flag bearer and a sign with the name of the country on it. The Parade of Nations was organized in Serbo-Croatian, the official language in Yugoslavia. As tradition dictates, Greece led the parade and Yugoslavia was the last to march to the stadium as the host nation. Two nations were unable to march with their respective national flags, namely British Virgin Islands and Chinese Taipei. While Chinese Taipei was unable to use their flag and the name \"Republic of China\" due to participation of People's Republic of China, British Virgin Islands team was forced to use a replacement flag. The replacement flag is a white-colored cloth with the words \u201cB. Djevi\u010danska Ostrva\u201d in blue color and the Olympic Rings on it. The organizers were unable to create the flag and created the replacement flag for the opening ceremony. ==List== {|class= \"wikitable\" |- !width=25| Order !width=200|Nation !width=160|Serbo-Croatian !width=175|Flag bearer !width=160|Sport |- | 1 || || Gr\u010dka || Andreas Pantelidis || Alpine skiing |- | 2 || || Andora || Albert Llovera || Alpine skiing |- | 3 || || Argentina || Teresa Bustamente || Alpine skiing |- | 4 || || Australija || Colin Coates || Speed skating |- | 5 || || Austrija || Franz Klammer || Alpine skiing |- | 6 || || Belgija || Henri Mollin || Alpine skiing |- | 7 || || Bolivija || || |- | 8 || || BD Ostrva || Erroll Fraser || Speed skating |- | 9 || || Bugarska || Vladimir Velichkov || Biathlon |- | 10 || || \u010cehoslova\u010dka || Ji\u0159\u00ed Kr\u00e1l\u00edk || Ice hockey |- | 11 || || \u010cile || Alfredo Maturana || Official |- | 12 || || DNR Koreja || Ri Im-bin || Speed skating |- | 13 || || Egipat || Jamil El- Reedy || Alpine skiing |- | 14 || || Finska || Jorma Valtonen || Ice hockey |- | 15 || || Francuska || Yvon Mougel || Biathlon |- | 16 || || Holandija || Hilbert van der Duim || Speed skating |- | 17 || || Island || Nanna Leifsd\u00f3ttir || Alpine skiing |- | 18 || || Italija || Paul Hildgartner || Luge |- | 19 || || Japan || Tadayuki Takahashi || Figure skating |- | 20 || || Kanada || Ga\u00e9tan Boucher || Speed skating |- | 21 || || Kipar || || |- | 22 || || Koreja || || |- | 23 || || Kostarika || || |- | 24 || || Libanon || || |- | 25 || || Lihten\u0161tajn || G\u00fcnther Marxer || Alpine skiing |- | 26 || || Ma\u0111arska || G\u00e1bor Mayer || Biathlon |- | 27 || || Maroko || || |- | 28 || || Meksiko || || |- | 29 || || Monako || David Lajoux || Alpine skiing |- | 30 || || Mongolija || Luvsandashiin Dorj || Cross-country skiing |- | 31 || || NR Kina || Zhao Shijian || Speed skating |- | 32 || || Norve\u0161ka || Bj\u00f8rg Eva Jensen || Speed skating |- | 33 || || Novi Zeland || Markus Hubrich || Alpine skiing |- | 34 || || Njema\u010dka DR|| Frank Ullrich || Biathlon |- | 35 || || Poljska || J\u00f3zef \u0141uszczek || Cross-country skiing |- | 36 || || Portoriko || George Tucker || Luge |- | 37 || || Rumunija || Dorel Cristudor || Bobsleigh |- | 38 || || San Marino || || |- | 39 || || SSSR|| Vladislav Tretiak || Ice hockey |- | 40 || || SR Njema\u010dka|| Monika Pflug || Speed skating |- | 41 || || Senegal || Lamine Gu\u00e8ye || Alpine skiing |- | 42 || || SAD|| Frank Masley || Luge |- | 43 || || Spanija || Blanca Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa || Alpine skiing |- | 44 || || \u0160vicarska || Erika Hess || Alpine skiing |- | 45 || || \u0160vedska || Mats Waltin || Ice hockey |- | 46 || || Tajpej Kinejski || || |- | 47 || || Turska || || |- | 48 || || Velika Britanija || Christopher Dean || Figure skating |- | 49 || || Jugoslavija || Jure Franko || Alpine skiing |} ;Notes ==References== ==External links== *Opening Ceremony of the 14th Winter Olympic Games - Youtube *Countries - Sports-Reference.com Flag bearers 1984 ",
