    "text": "A Hero's Death is the second studio album by Irish post-punk band Fontaines D.C. The album was released on 31 July 2020 through Partisan Records, less than 18 months after the release of their debut album Dogrel. The album received critical acclaim upon its release, signifying a partial departure from their bubbling and anxiety-inducing post-punk sound found on their first record to the incorporation of more dream-like and psychedelic aspects having taken inspiration from The Beach Boys, to name but one of many influences, during the writing of the record. == Background and recording == Following the release of Dogrel, Fontaines D.C. embarked on a spring 2019 tour with British punk rock band IDLES. This included a North American leg from March to May 2019. Following the North American leg of the tour, the band performed at several European summer music festivals including Glastonbury, Roskilde, Viva, StereoLeto, TRNSMT, Dour, Y Not, Haldern Pop, and Ypsigrock. Following the European summer festival circuit, the band went on a fall 2019 North American tour as the headlining act. The band finishing touring for Dogrel with a headlining tour across Europe, concluding in February 2020. During the tour, the band wrote and recorded material for their second studio album. The album is produced by Dan Carey, who produced their debut album, Dogrel. On 5 May 2020, the band released the single \"A Hero's Death\" with a corresponding music video. With the release of the single, the band announced the release of the album for 31 July 2020. According to lead singer Grian Chatten, the album's name was inspired by a line in a play by Irish writer Brendan Behan. Chatten said the album title is \"an effort to balance sincerity and insincerity, but more broadly it's about the battle between happiness and depression, and the trust issues that can form tied to both of those feelings\". The album cover features a statue of the Irish mythological demigod C\u00fa Chulainn entitled \"The Dying Cuchulain\" by Oliver Sheppard. == Music and lyrics == According to the band's press release of the new album, the sound ventures away from their post-punk sound. The band said that bands such as Suicide, The Beach Boys, Beach House, These Immortal Souls and Broadcast were influential in the sound of the album. == Singles == The first single from A Hero's Death was its title track, which was released on 5 May 2020 alongside the music video. The video was directed by Hugh Mulhern and produced by Aaron McEnaney and Theresa Adebiyi. The music video features a fictional late night show called The Georgie Barnes Show starring a jaded talk show host named Georgie Barnes, (played by Aidan Gillen) whose co-host is a puppet. The series features the talk show host greeting the band prior to them playing a song on the show, but becoming existential when the band seems to show more appreciation to the puppeteer (Bryan Quinn) and the puppet rather than the host. The album's second single, \"I Don't Belong\", was released on 9 June 2020. It was followed by \"Televised Mind\" on 30 June 2020. Conor Deegan III directed the video for \"I Don't Belong,\" while Mulhern returned to direct the \"Televised Mind\" video. == Tour == The album was released during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, delaying any shows prior to and following the release of the album. Pending developments with the pandemic, Fontaines D.C. will play their first show since the album's release on 24 November 2020 before embarking on a three show tour in Australia in December 2020. From March 2021 until July 2021, the band is scheduled to go on a European tour. == Critical reception == At aggregating website Metacritic, A Hero's Death has received a normalised rating of 84, based on 23 critical reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Writing for Pitchfork, Elizabeth Nelson gave the album an 8.1 out of 10, describe A Hero's Death as \"heady, funny, and fearless.\" Nelson summarised the album as \"a maudlin and manic triumph, a horror movie shot as comedy, equal parts future- shocked and handcuffed to history.\" Guardian writer, Ben Beaumont-Thomas, gave the album a perfect five stars out of five stating that Fontaines D.C. \"deliver a difficult but powerful second album full of songwriting that stares life in the face.\" A few music critics offered a more mixed view of A Hero's Death. Liam Martin, writing for AllMusic, awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, feeling that their sophomore effort was not up to par with their debut, Dogrel. Martin said \"their debut benefited from strong singles and a cohesive locational element to give it strength. Here the singles are not as strong, and the sweaty vibe from the debut is gone, as if someone has switched on the air conditioning.\" Martin did concede that \"their second attempt only falls short of greatness in a relative sense, as there is still plenty to love about the album.\" == Track listing == Track listing and times via Apple Music. ==Personnel== Fontaines D.C. * Grian Chatten \u2013 lead vocals, tambourine * Carlos O'Connell \u2013 guitar, backing vocals * Conor Curley \u2013 guitar, piano, backing vocals * Tom Coll \u2013 drums, percussion, guitar * Conor Deegan \u2013 bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals Additional personnel * Dan Carey \u2013 production, mixing ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Chart performance for A Hero's Death |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 26 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 28 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italian Albums (FIMI) | 47 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 60 |- |- |} ==References== == External links == * * A Hero's Death at Partisan Records Category:2020 albums Category:Fontaines D.C. albums Category:Partisan Records albums Category:Albums produced by Dan Carey (record producer) ",
