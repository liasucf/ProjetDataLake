The N97 is Nokia's second S60-based touchscreen phone, after the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. It features a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. The N97 runs on Symbian v9.4 (Symbian^1/S60 5th Edition). Its design was mostly based on that of the Nokia N79. A smaller 'mini' variant was later released.https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_officially_announce_n97_mini_and_unveil_x3_and_x6-news-1098.php Being Nokia's flagshiphttps://www.fastcompany.com/1302319/abject-failure- nokias-flagship-phone and at a time when touchscreen devices were becoming increasingly prevalent, the N97 was highly anticipated. Despite good sales it is considered to have been a \"disaster\" on the hardware and software sides and is thought to have contributed to Nokia's decline. A Nokia executive admitted in 2010 that the N97 was a \"regrettable failure\".http://www.alphr.com/news/355831/nokia-n97-was-a-tremendous- disappointment ==Release== The Nokia N97 was released in US flagship stores on 9 June 2009, and on 26 June 2009 was released worldwide. In September 2009, two million N97 handsets had been reportedly sold in the three months following release. The N97 shipped with trial versions of Quick Office, Adobe Reader, Boingo, Joikuspot, Ovi Maps, and Ovi store.

Nokia released the new firmware with kinetic scrolling for the N97 to address the major issues present in the firmware the device launched with. In October 2009, the N97 Mini, a downsized version of the original N97, was made available.

Nokia quoted the following claimed operating times *Talk time: Up to 6.0 hours (3G), 9.5 hours (GSM) *Standby time: Up to 17 days (3G), 18 days (GSM) *Video playback: Up to 4.5 hours (offline mode) *Video recording: Up to 3.6 hours (offline mode) *Music playback: Up to 40 hours (offline mode) ==Special applications== With the optional DVB-H Nokia Mobile TV Receiver, SU-33W it is possible to watch television on the phone. It is compatible with Nokia's N-Gage platform, being the only touchscreen to do so. ==Reception== The N97 Common criticisms of the original N97 were the relative lack of RAM and available storage. With only around 50 MB of free RAM available after boot, the phone can become sluggish and close programs in order to conserve memory. Many first party applications also will only install on the root partition and with around 50 MB of free space, this is used quickly as it is also where temporary OS files are placed. This issue was resolved in the N97 mini as the user often has over 250 MB of free space on the fixed storage. A memory mapping alteration from firmware version 20 allowed applications to use less RAM and free it up better, helping to ease the strain of a lower amount of free RAM to the end-user.How To Recover Phone Memory On Your Nokia N97 | The Handheld Blog.

Steve Litchfield of All About Symbian in a 2011 blog post wrote: \"The N97 really was the device that should have ruled the world - it had, almost literally, everything. And yet it became the one device that Nokia had to (literally) apologise for, publicly. The one device that became a millstone around its neck.\"http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/features/item/13165_Nokia_N97_RIP_the_derailed_fla.php Nokia has acknowledged that on many devices, the cover and the lens were mounted too close causing scratches from dust and debris. On later units, Nokia reportedly fixed this issue. Others with the original N97 had speed problems with the built in GPS lock. These phones too easily lose track of the current location, making the free turn by turn navigation software provided by Nokia unusable. Users can have both the lens cover and GPS issues fixed under warranty at an official Nokia service centre. Despite most Nokia phones having great signal reception, the Nokia N97 did not follow that same tradition. It had very poor overall signal strength, even in comparison to other phones placed side by side to the N97 that were connected to the same network.
