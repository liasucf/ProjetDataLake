This year Mnet co-partnered with Coca-Cola for the season. Ikponmwosa \"IK\" Osakioduwa came back to host the show for the third time in a row. The launch show was also broadcast live through the official website. This year the contestants will move into a brand new house. South African band BLKJKS (Blackjacks) performed their song 'Mzabalazo'; Busta Rhymes also performed during the 2 hour launch show. ==Format== There were twenty six housemates this season and lived in the same house (Heads House) for one week. On Day 7, eleven of the twenty six moved to a different house (Tails House) during the live eviction show. The housemates were competing for US$400,000. On Day 42, it was announced that there were going to be two winners who will each receive US$200,000. This year, fourteen countries participated in the season. Each country had at least one representative for them. All fourteen countries were returning countries and these were Angola, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. ==Housemates== On Day 1, twenty six housemates entered the House on launch night. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

This led to people concluding that the whole show was planned and viewers were fooled that they were the ones influencing voting results as they thought M-Net and Endemol were influencing the game to gain more profits. Mnet released the clarified results audited and verified by Ernst & Young the following day after the controversy. *Ernest and Bhoke (the couple dubbed \"EBhok\") were hugely criticised for having sex in the Big Brother house. *There was controversy surrounding Luclay's punishment as it was not done accordingly. The punishment involved Luclay taking over all dish washing duties for as long as he is part of the Big brother show. This was not done and viewers felt that it was not fair since Lotus was evicted because of the same confrontation with Luclay. ==References== ==External links== * Big Brother Africa 6 at M-Net * Big Brother Africa Official Fan Site on BigBrotherAfrica.com * Big Brother Africa Highlights on Ugandaonline.net Category:2011 South African television seasons Africa Category:South African reality television series ",
