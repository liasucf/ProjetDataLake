Located approximately 12 miles (18 km) east of Quebec City near Montmorency Falls, it has been a semi-private club since 1925. One of the oldest golf clubs in North America, the current 36-hole course is located on a 186 hectare piece of land with pine trees that have been growing since the club was founded. The club house, by the 18th green of the \"Quebec\" course, overlooks l'\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans and Quebec City. == Notable members == * Stan Leonard * Art Wall * Sam Snead * Arnold Palmer * Lee Trevino * Billy Casper * Tommy Bolt * Jimmy Demaret * Doug Ford * Gene Littler * Dow Finsterwald * Frank Stranahan * Patrick Roy * Jonathan Marchessault * Maxime Leblanc * Marcel B\u00e9dard * Antoine Lalancette * Guy Rouleau, founder of Lunetterie Rouleau & Lunetterie New Look * Jules Dallaire, founder of Groupe Cominar == See also == * List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage == External links == * Category:Golf clubs and courses in Quebec Category:Organizations based in Canada with royal patronage Category:1874 establishments in Quebec ",
