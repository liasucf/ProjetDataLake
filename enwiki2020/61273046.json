    "text": "The Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council was a local authority in South Glamorgan, Wales, which was replaced in 1996 by the Vale of Glamorgan Council unitary authority. The Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council was created in 1974, composed of representatives elected from wards in the Borough of the Vale of Glamorgan. It was a second tier (district) authority to South Glamorgan County Council. ==Background== Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council and Cardiff City Council were created as district authorities, upon the creation of the county of South Glamorgan on 1 April 1974. They replaced nine district councils which existed prior to 1974.Stewart Williams (Ed.), The Cardiff Book: Volume I., Stewart Williams Publishers (1973), p. 8. . Prior to 1974 the eight councils governing the area which became the Vale of Glamorgan included Cardiff Rural Council, Barry Borough Council, Penarth Urban Council, Cowbridge Urban Council and Cowbridge Rural Council. ==Composition== In 1973, 41 councillors were elected from fourteen wards, in preparation for the new council. This increased to 49 councillors elected from 18 wards at the next election, in 1976. At the 1983 election, the number of councillors reduced to 46 though the number of wards increased to twenty-one. The council elected a mayor annually. The Conservative Party had a strong majority on the council throughout its existence. ==Electoral divisions== As a result of The Borough of Vale of Glamorgan (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1982, between 1983 and 1996 the borough was divided into 21 electoral wards returning 46 councillors: {| class=\"wikitable\" |Ward |Councillors |Communities/wards included |- |Alexandra | align=\"center\" | 5 |Plymouth and St Augustines (Penarth town wards) |- |Baruc | align=\"center\" | 2 |Baruc (Barry town ward) |- |Buttrills | align=\"center\" | 2 |Buttrills (Barry town ward) |- |Cadoc | align=\"center\" | 3 |Cadoc (Barry town ward) |- |Castleland | align=\"center\" | 2 |Castleland (Barry town ward) |- |Cornerswell | align=\"center\" | 2 |Cornerswell (Penarth town ward) |- |Court | align=\"center\" | 2 |Court (Barry town ward) |- |Cowbridge | align=\"center\" | 3 | |- |Dinas Powys | align=\"center\" | 4 | |- |Dyfan | align=\"center\" | 2 |Dyfan (Barry town ward) |- |Gibbonsdown | align=\"center\" | 2 |Gibbonsdown (Barry town ward) |- |Illtyd | align=\"center\" | 3 |Illtyd (Barry town ward) |- |Llandough | align=\"center\" | 1 |Llandough (community) |- |Llandow | align=\"center\" | 1 | |- |Llantwit Major | align=\"center\" | 4 | |- |Peterston-super-Ely | align=\"center\" | 1 | |- |Rhoose | align=\"center\" | 2 | |- |St Athan | align=\"center\" | 1 |St Athan (community) |- |Stanwell | align=\"center\" | 2 |Stanwell (Penarth town ward) |- |Sully | align=\"center\" | 1 |Sully (community) |- |Wenvoe | align=\"center\" | 1 |Wenvoe (community) |} ==References== Category:1974 establishments in Wales Category:1996 disestablishments in Wales Category:District councils of Wales Category:Organisations based in the Vale of Glamorgan Category:Politics of the Vale of Glamorgan ",
