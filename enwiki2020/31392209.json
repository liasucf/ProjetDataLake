    "text": "Uruguay competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's twentieth appearance at the Olympics, Uruguay missed the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its partial support for the United States boycott. The Uruguayan Olympic Committee (, COU) sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games since 1968. A total of 29 athletes, 26 men and 3 women, competed in 8 sports. Men's football was the only team-based sport in which Uruguay was represented at these Olympic games. There was only a single competitor in road cycling, judo and shooting. Notable Uruguayan athletes included football stars Sebasti\u00e1n Coates and team captain Luis Su\u00e1rez, who both had recently played for Liverpool F.C., siblings Alejandro and Andrea Foglia in men's and women's one-person dinghy sailing, and track hurdler Andr\u00e9s Silva. Rower Rodolfo Collazo, who competed at his third Olympics along with Silva and the older Foglia, was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Uruguay, however, failed to win its first Olympic medal since the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where track cyclist Milton Wynants won silver in the points race (currently replaced by the omnium). ==Athletics== Uruguay has qualified one athlete in the men's 400 m hurdles through the \"A\" standard qualification time and qualified one athlete in the women's 400 m hurdles: ;Key *Note\u2013Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only *Q = Qualified for the next round *q = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target *NR = National record *N/A = Round not applicable for the event *Bye = Athlete not required to compete in round ;Men {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Andr\u00e9s Silva |align=left|400 m hurdles |53.38 |8 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ;Women {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|D\u00e9borah Rodr\u00edguez |align=left|400 m hurdles |57.04 NR |7 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ==Cycling== Uruguay had qualified one cyclist in the men's road race through the UCI America tour. ===Road=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Jorge Soto |align=left|Men's road race |colspan=2|Did not finish |} ==Football== Uruguay qualified a team in the men's tournament through the 2011 South American Youth Championship. ===Men's tournament=== ;Team roster ;Group play ==Judo== Uruguay had qualified one judoka in the men's middleweight (90 kg) class through additional places for the Americas. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !Repechage !colspan=2|Final / |-style=\"font- size:95%\" !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Juan Romero |align=left|Men's \u221290 kg | L 0000\u20131001 |colspan=6|Did not advance |} ==Rowing== Uruguay had qualified one boat in the men's lightweight double sculls through the Latin America Continental Qualification Regatta. ;Men {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heats !colspan=\"2\"|Repechage !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinals !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Rodolfo Collazo Emiliano Dumestre |align=left|Lightweight double sculls |6:58.63 |4 R |6:51.67 |5 SC/D |7:11.20 |3 FC |6:51.94 |16 |} Qualification Legend: FA=Final A (medal);
