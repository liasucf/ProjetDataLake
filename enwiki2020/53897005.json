It now marks part of the boundary between the London Boroughs of Newham and Redbridge, with the west bank in the parish of Little Ilford and the east bank in that of Great Ilford. It gave its name to the Aldersbrook area, the Manor of Aldersbrook and the Aldersbrook Estate. ==References== Category:Rivers of London Category:Rivers of Essex Category:Geography of the London Borough of Newham Category:Geography of the London Borough of Redbridge Category:Thames drainage basin ",
