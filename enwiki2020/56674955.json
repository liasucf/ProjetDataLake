It was released twenty-three years after Belly's previous album King (1995) and their subsequent disbandment. The band reformed in 2016, and, following a successful reunion tour, chose to crowdfund a new album which would become Dove. Dove continued the band's tradition of releasing albums with four-letter word titles. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Belly (band) albums Category:Crowdfunded albums ",
