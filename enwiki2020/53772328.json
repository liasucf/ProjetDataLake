Historically, it has featured Haitian artists such as Nemours Jean-Baptiste as well as international entertainers. \\- The construction appears like an inverted ice cream cone, that is high- peaked with a thatched cupola on top. From a distance, it resembles a chief's African jungle hut. \\- It is located about 500 metres up the mountains behind Port-au-Prince, in P\u00e9tion-Ville, home to the country's elite. == References == Category:Nightclubs Category:Buildings and structures in Haiti Category:Tourist attractions in Haiti Category:1940 establishments in Haiti Category:P\u00e9tion-Ville ",
