    "text": "Sexto Sentido () is the fourteenth studio album and the tenth in Portuguese by Brazilian pop singer Xuxa. Was released on August 20, 1994 by the record company Som Livre. Aimed at the children's audience, it was the first record of the presenter to win a title of their own, without depending on the programs presented by Xuxa as happened with the previous albums. Sexto Sentindo sold more than 1 million copies, gaining diamond certification by Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). ==Production and songs== After a period full of international projects that were interrupted by a column problem, Xuxa began the year of 1994 decided that it would return to invest in the Brazilian public. The new program in Rede Globo gradually shaped itself and soon after, a new album began to be developed as well. Xuxa's audience had been growing. Many of the children who accompanied her in the days of the Xou da Xuxa were already entering their adolescence and thus the need arose to produce a disc that could please all the age groups. In this way, Xuxa would continue conquering the children's public, but without leaving aside the public that consecrated it like Queen. The album features lyrics and more mature arrangements than previous releases. We have as an example the song \"Hey DJ\" in which the blonde bet on the funk from Rio that gained evidence in that period, already in \"Dan\u00e7a Nas Estrelas\" the romantic pop and \"Happy-py\" the bet on reggae sharing the vocals with Carlinhos Brown. According to the controversial book Sonho de Paquitas (Dream of Paquitas), released in 1995, Popcorn was recorded for a play that Xuxa would do that year. The idea of recording the song came by chance. In an interview at the time, the blonde told that it was during a chat in her house with her businesswoman of the time, Marlene Mattos and composers \u00c1lvaro Socci and Cl\u00e1udio Matta, until she commented on the desire that was to eat popcorn and soon then returned from the kitchen with several pots full of popcorn. Half- embarrassed, the composers said they had written a song that talked about candy. Xuxa was curious, they showed the song and she decided to record. Sexto Sentido was the first record to win a title that was not the same as a Xuxa program and the first to be developed without the intention of using the tracks as a soundtrack on TV. The explanation of the title is due to a curious fact. When the hostess recorded the song \"Sexto Sentido\", a fan told that she had dreamed she'd put that title on the album and found it interesting. It is worth remembering that throughout the process of selection of repertoire, Xuxa and his team choose the songs through intuition, another reason that made this name for the album. Sexto Sentido was produced by Michael Sullivan, had Artistic Direction by Aramis Barros and Artistic coordination by Marlene Mattos and Xuxa, recorded at the Som Livre studios. ==Release and reception== Sexto Sentido was released on August 20, 1994 in CD, cassette and LP formats, The album was also re-released on CD in 1996, 2001 and 2006.
