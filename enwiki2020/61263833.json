    "text": "The Horticulturist and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste was a monthly magazine on \"horticulture, landscape gardening, rural architecture, embellishments, pomology, floriculture, and all subjects of rural life, literature, art, and taste\". A. J. Downing, the famous landscape designer, horticulturist, and journalist, founded the magazine in 1846 and edited it until his death in 1852. After Downing died there were several different editors, including Patrick Barry (1816\u20131890), John Jay Smith (1798\u20131881), and Henry T. Williams. In 1875 the Horticulturist and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste was merged with The Gardener's Monthly and Horticultural Advertiser and published from 1876 to 1888 under the title The Gardener's Monthly and Horticulturist. ==See also== * List of horticultural magazines ==References== Category:Lifestyle magazines published in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Horticultural magazines Category:Magazines established in 1846 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1876 Category:Magazines published in New York (state) Category:Magazines published in Philadelphia Category:Mass media in Albany, New York Category:Mass media in Rochester, New York ",
