    "text": "The Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) (UPOAA) was a law proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (ULC) to create a uniform framework for power of attorney provisions throughout the United States. == History == Historically, issues surrounding powers of attorney were based on the common law concept of agency. However, as states began enacting varying statutes to create a statutory framework for the durable powers of attorney, variations from state to state prompted support for a uniform law. In 1969, the ULC promulgated the Uniform Probate Code, which created a basis for a national framework for powers of attorney. However, since a normal power of attorney ends once its purpose has been fulfilled or the principle is incapacitated, states made a distinction between this normal power of attorney and a durable power of attorney, which \"remains in effect even when the principal becomes incapacitated.\" This prompted to ULC to create a uniform law regarding Durable Power of Attorney, which superseded the original Uniform Probate Code. == Act == The UPOAA was designed to correct shortcomings of both the Uniform Probate Code and the Durable Power of Attorney by superseding them both. It consisted of four distinct articles: # The general rules governing the \"creation and use\" of power of attorney # The definitions used by the UPOAA # An optional form for use in granting power of attorney # Other miscellaneous provisions regarding the UPOAA and other power of attorney laws == Adoption == The ULC officially approved of the UPOAA and recommend that states adopt it in 2006. As of 2019, 26 states have adopted and enacted the UPOAA. == See also == * Uniform Act * List of Uniform Acts (United States) ==References== == External links == *UNIFORM POWER OF ATTORNEY ACT - As drafted and approved by the ULC, with comments (pdf) *UNIFORM POWER OF ATTORNEY ACT - As drafted and approved by the ULC, no comments (doc) *Uniform Law Commission - website Category:Uniform Acts Category:Power of attorney Category:Wills and trusts Category:United States trusts law ",
