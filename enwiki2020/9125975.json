    "text": "__NOTOC__ Ockley is a rural village in Surrey. It lies astride the A29, the modern road using the alignment of Stane Street (Chichester). The A29 diverges from the A24 from London about 2.5 miles northeast and takes the alignment of Stane Street a mile north of the village. It has a medieval parish church, see list of places of worship in Mole Valley. ==History== Finds of small artifacts dating to Roman Britain associated with the Roman road stretching from Chichester to London have been made since at least the 19th century. Ockley's name initially appears to fit the uncertain site where battle took place described in the entry for the year 851 of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. According to the chronicler, king \u00c6thelwulf and his son \u00c6thelbald, together with the West-Saxon army, fought against an invading Danish army of 350 ships that had plundered London and Canterbury previously, and had also put king Beorhtwulf of Mercia to flight. The chronicler refers to the battlefield as Aclea, Oak Lea, and the Danish army was defeated suffering \u201cthe greatest slaughter\u2026 we have heard tell of up to this present day\u201d. However, Aclea almost always appears in modern English as Oakley not Ockley and the identification of Ockley with the battlefield is made virtually impossible.Frank Stenton: Anglo-Saxon England p244. Ockley appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Hoclei. It was held by Radulf (Ralph) from Richard Fitz Gilbert. Its domesday assets were: 1 hide. It had 5 ploughs, woodland worth 20 hogs. It rendered \u00a33 10s 0d to its overlords per year.Surrey Domesday Book Nicholas Culpeper, a leading Stuart period herbalist, was probably born here on 18 October 1616.https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-6882?rskey=FvVyqF&result;=10 In 1911 the parish was \"agricultural, except for a little brick and tile making\". ==Sports== Informal football is generally played on Ockley Green which has football posts in place. Ockley has Gatton Manor Golf Course on the outskirts of the village, within the parish bounds.Gatton Manor Retrieved 2013-11-29 The village has featured in longer routes of the London-Surrey Cycle Classic. ==Geography== Between Dorking and Horsham, close to the Sussex/Surrey border, Ockley stretches to the escarpment of Leith Hill, the second highest point in South East England, after Walbury Hill in the far south-west of Berkshire. The northern border is marked by the Greensand Ridge. Close to the Greensand Ridge are small beds of Sussex marble, and remnants of a former limestone area of the Weald.

Local minor roads provide relatively straight access from just north of the village's developed area to Ewhurst and Cranleigh to the west and Capel to the east. ===Rail=== The village is served by Ockley railway station which is to the east, due to a Victorian aristocrat having imposed his manor's name on a station closer to Capel, Surrey. ==Demography and housing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ 2011 Census Homes |- !Output area !!Detached !!Semi-detached!!Terraced!!Flats and apartments!!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes!!shared between households |- |(Civil Parish)||147 || 132 || 44 || 18 || 11 || 0 |} The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ 2011 Census Key Statistics |- !Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares |- |(Civil Parish)||871||352 ||34.7%|| 26.7%||1375 |} The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.
