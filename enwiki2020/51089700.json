    "text": "The Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps is an Open Class competitive junior drum and bugle corps. Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, The Battalion is the first competitive drum corps from the state of Utah and competed in its first season as a member corps of Drum Corps International (DCI) during the summer of 2016. ==History== Founded in 2014, The Battalion spent its first two years building a solid corporate structure before beginning to recruit members. In the spring of 2016, the corps applied for membership in DCI. After an evaluation of the organization's resources, staff, and plans, on May 18, 2016, the unit was approved to enter competition as an Open Class corps. Similar to many new corps, The Battalion chose to begin with only a short tour in its inaugural season, and its 104 charter members marched in only five shows in four states during the first week of July. To cater to its community, the corps has elected to not compete on Sundays \"...in order to allow corps members take part in preplanned community outreach and service projects where the corps is housed while on tour.\" Although the 2019 corps ended its season on July 24, a week and a half before the DCI Championships began, The Battalion's corps director, Katherine Steinacker was awarded the David Kampshroer Leadership Award for Director of the Year at the Open Class Finals. ==Sponsorship== The corps is sponsored by The Battalion Drum and Bugle Corps, Inc., a registered non-profit 501 (c)(3) musical organization that has a Board of Directors, executive director, and staff assigned to carry out the organization's mission. The Corps Director is Katherine Steinacker and the Program Director is Mark Hartman. ==Show Summary (2016-2019)== Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width:100%\" !
