    "text": "The Tampa Bay Rowdies were an American professional soccer team based in Tampa, Florida, that competed in the original North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1975 to 1984. They enjoyed broad popular support in the Tampa Bay area until the NASL folded in 1984, after which the team played in various minor indoor and outdoor leagues before finally folding on January 31, 1994. The Rowdies played nearly all of their outdoor home games at Tampa Stadium and nearly all of their indoor games at the Bayfront Center Arena in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida. Although San Diego played indoors until 1996, the Rowdies were the last surviving NASL franchise that played outdoor soccer on a regular basis. ==NASL: 1975\u20131984== On June 19, 1974 George Strawbridge and Beau Rogers, IV purchased an expansion franchise in North American Soccer League for the sum of $25,000 and by July 24 they named Eddie Firmani their coach. In October 1974, Alex Pringle becomes the first player to sign with the team. On November 21, 1974, the Tampa Bay Professional Soccer Club announced that they would henceforth be known as the Tampa Bay Rowdies. The Rowdies played ten seasons at Tampa Stadium and won their only Soccer Bowl championship in their 1975 inaugural season, defeating the Portland Timbers 2\u20130 on August 24. The Rowdies also finished as runners-up in 1978 and 1979. The team showcased international stars such as midfielder, and team captain Rodney Marsh (England), 1979 league scoring leader \u00d3scar Fabbiani (Chile), swift and forward Steve Wegerle (South Africa), rock-solid defenseman Arsene Auguste (Haiti), 1976 NASL goal scoring champion Derek Smethurst (South Africa), who was also the franchise's all-time leading goal scorer with 57 tallies in 65 games, as well as forward Clyde Best (Bermuda). Coached along the way by Firmani, John Boyle, Gordon Jago, Al Miller, and Marsh after his retirement, their catch phrase and marketing slogan was \"The Rowdies arrrre...a kick in the grass!\" While no NASL team ever captured a treble, in 1975\u201376 Tampa Bay came the closest by winning the three different NASL titles available at the time (Soccer Bowl '75, 1976 Indoor Title, 1976 Regular Season title) in succession within twelve months. On and off the pitch, the Rowdies would prove to be one of the league's most recognizable brands. At one three-year point in their history, the team regularly drew crowds of well over 25,000 a night. In 1979 three different matches were attended by over 40,000 people, and the following year two more surpassed the 50,000 mark. The Rowdies had long- standing rivalries with both the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers and the New York Cosmos. Following the 1981 season the Dallas Tornado merged with Tampa Bay. At the time, Dallas principals Lamar Hunt and Bill McNutt retained a minority stake in the Rowdies. Two years later after the 1983 season, Strawbidge, Hunt and McNutt sold the team outright to local investors Stella Thayer, Bob Blanchard and Dick Corbett. ===Year-by-year=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Record !Regular Season Finish !Playoffs !Leading Goal Scorers !Avg Attend. |- |1975 |16\u20136 | style=\"background:#b3b7ff;\"|1st, Eastern Division | style=\"background:#ffcbcb;\"|NASL Champions (3-0) |Derek Smethurst-18, Stewart Scullion-7 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10,728 |- |1976 |18\u20136 | style=\"background:#b3b7ff;\"|1st, Eastern Division, Atlantic Conference |Atlantic Conf.

The Rowdies defeated the New York Cosmos 13\u20135 in the semi-final, before losing 8\u20135 to the host San Jose Earthquakes in the finals on March 16 at the Cow Palace. The Rowdies again reached the final-four in 1976, but that year were the host team. This time Tampa Bay would not be denied, as they followed up a 6\u20132 semi-final win over Dallas with a 6\u20134 finals triumph over the Rochester Lancers on March 27 in the Bayfront Center. Over the next few years, the Rowdies (and a handful of other NASL teams) played indoor friendlies and invitationals as preparation for the start of the outdoor season. The NASL did not sanction a full indoor season until 1979\u201380, when the Rowdies won the championship by defeating the Memphis Rogues 2 games to 1. The 1980\u201381 campaign marked the first time Tampa Bay had ever missed the playoffs, indoor or outdoor. In the 1981\u201382 season they lost the finals to the San Diego Sockers 2 games to 0. Once again the NASL chose not to sanction a full indoor season in 1982\u201383, but (in addition to a few friendlies) Tampa Bay and three other teams participated in the Grand Prix of Indoor Soccer. The Rowdies finished second in the round-robin stage and subsequently went on to defeat Montreal for the championship in a double overtime thriller at the Montreal Forum; 5\u20134. The final NASL indoor season took place in 1983\u201384 and the Rowdies finished last out of the seven teams. Due to scheduling issues that season, the Rowdies played five games at the Bayfront Center, eight at the State Fairgrounds' Expo Hall in Tampa, and three in the Lakeland Civic Center. Tampa Bay regularly drew home crowds of over five thousand \"fannies\" to the Bayfront Center, despite the arena's limited seating capacity and relatively remote location. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Indoor Year !Record !Regular Season Finish !Playoffs !Leading Goal Scorers !Avg Attend. |- |1975 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3\u20131 | style=\"background:#b3b7ff;\"|1st, Region 3 (2\u20130) | style=\"background:#ffebad;\"|Runners-up (1\u20131) |Doug Wark-10, Cantillo-5, Hartze-4 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4,235 |- |1976 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|5\u20130 | style=\"background:#b3b7ff;\"|1st, Eastern Region (2\u20130) | style=\"background:#ffcbcb;\"|NASL Champions (2\u20130) |Clyde Best-11, Scullion-6, Smethurst-4, Marsh-4 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5,458 |- |1977 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20131 |(friendlies only) |none |Derek Smethurst-5, Marsh-4, S.

Out of nearly 12,500 entries it was Clearwater attorney, Bill Wilhelm's suggestion that won. That suggestion earned Wilhelm a vacation to Acapulco for his efforts, along with a lifetime pass to all home games. The Rowdies' fans were known as \"Fannies\". Advertisements for the club declared that \"Soccer is a kick in the grass\" and encouraged their supporters to \"Get up, get out, and get Rowdy!\" and to \"make a fanny of yourself!\". The calls were answered by fans who threw confetti, drank beer, chanted during games, and generally \"let the guys know we're behind them.\" One memorable fan named Bob Rogers won a \"Rowdiest Fan\" contest by donning a giant soccer head and throwing himself into the Tampa Stadium goal. The club gave \"Soccer Head\" complimentary tickets to future games so that he could continue his antics for the crowd, even bringing him along when the Rowdies played in Soccer Bowl '79. While anyone who supported the club could call themselves a Fanny, members of the official Rowdies Fan Club particularly claimed the moniker as their own. The fan club held regular meetings and social events and published a newsletter. The \"Wowdies\" were the Rowdies' cheerleaders. The team also had a pep band known as the \"Loudies\" that sat in the south endzone and attended local pep rallies. ==Post-NASL: 1985\u20131993== The NASL folded in 1984, but the Rowdies continued to play for several more years. Tampa Stadium continued to be used as their home ground for outdoor games except during the 1991 and 1992 seasons in the APSL. Those two years were spent at the USF Soccer Stadium, before returning to Tampa Stadium in 1993 for the team's final season in existence. ===Independent: 1985\u20131987=== With Rodney Marsh staying on as coach (through 1987), the Rowdies operated as an independent team for two years before joining the American Indoor Soccer Association for one season (1986\u201387). Cornelia Corbett, Dick Corbett's wife and a businesswoman in her own right, became sole owner of the team in 1986. As a footnote, in 2011 the University of South Florida opened the new Corbett Soccer Stadium for their NCAA Division I men's and women's teams, after the Corbetts had made a $1.5 million donation to the project. The stadium features several display cases that highlight the history of the Tampa Bay Rowdies. Since 2005, the USF Bulls and the crosstown rival University of Tampa Spartans men's squads have competed annually for the preseason Rowdies Cup, which celebrates the city's rich soccer history. To date the NCAA Division II Spartans have only captured the trophy once, back in 2012. ====1985 Outdoor==== As an independent club, the Rowdies played only one match in 1985. It was against the U.S. Men's team on the Fourth of July in front of 30,038 fans. ====1986 Outdoor==== In the summer of 1986 the Rowdies staged a four-game series at Tampa Stadium called the Coca-Cola Classic International Soccer Series, which culminated with a Fourth of July match, and also included a post-game fireworks display and laser light show. Since Tampa Bay had only a handful of players under contract at the time, their roster was composed mostly of guest players from Queens Park Rangers F.C. The only NASL-era Rowdies on this roster were Roy Wegerle, Steve Wegerle, Dave Power, and the head coach, Rodney Marsh. Four former Rowdies played in the final game of this series for the opposing NASL All-Stars. These included Mike Connell, Winston DuBose, Wes McLeod and Tatu.http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pbLT6idPmuA/Ukv8UREX5AI/AAAAAAAAVYc/Ja0-eMlV1ck/s1600/1986-7-04+Rowdies+vs+NASL+All- Stars+Report+1.jpg They also played a pair of friendlies against the newly established Orlando Lions on February 22 and July 2 at Lake Brantley High School, using their regular players. Tampa Bay won the matches by scores of 1\u20130 and 2\u20131(SO) respectively. ====1987 Outdoor==== In 1987 Tampa Bay played twice against the Orlando Lions, on May 16 at the Florida Citrus Bowl, and then again on May 23 at Pepin-Rood Stadium. The Rowdies lost the first encounter, 2\u20130, with the teams tying, 2\u20132, in the return leg. ====1985\u201387 Outdoor results==== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text- align:center\" !Date!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Goal Scorers!!Ref. |- bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" |July 4, 1985 |USMNT |Tampa Stadium |1\u20132 |30,038 |Hoddle | |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |February 22, 1986 |@Orlando Lions |Lake Brantley High School |0\u20131 |4,200 |G.

After a strong start they finished third in their division and eventually lost in the first round of the playoffs. Steve Wegerle was selected as a starter in the AISA All-Star game and scored the game's first goal. Arnie Mausser, Rub\u00e9n Astigarraga, and Glenn Ervine also made the Southern Division team. Ervine added a goal in the fourth quarter. Tim Walters was a late All-Star addition, because Astigarraga was unable play in the match. ====Year-by-year==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !League !Games !Won !Lost !GF !GA !Regular Season !Playoffs !Attendance (21 games) |- |1986\u201387 |AISA |42 |21 |21 |170 |172 |3rd, Southern |Quarterfinals |43,015 (avg. 2,048) |} ====1986\u20131987 roster==== *1 \u2013 Arnie Mausser 35 Apps 0 Goals *2 \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Auguste *3 \u2013 David Dodge *4 \u2013 Dave Power *5 \u2013 Steve Savage *5 \u2013 Wim Suurbier (player/asst. coach) *6 \u2013 Peter Roe *6 \u2013 Mike Balson *7 \u2013 Steve Wegerle 35 Apps 26 Goals *8 \u2013 Rodney Marsh (player/head coach) *9 \u2013 Jay White *10 \u2013 Rub\u00e9n Astigarraga *10 \u2013 Derek Sanderson *11 \u2013 Duncan MacEwan *12 \u2013 Tony Frankovich *12 \u2013 Derek Smethurst *13 \u2013 Tim Walters *14 \u2013 Geoff Wegerle *15 \u2013 Mark Lindsay *16 \u2013 Karim Murabet *17 \u2013 Paul Roe *18 \u2013 Nathan Sacks *19 \u2013 Nick Mangione *20 \u2013 Soloman Hilton *21 \u2013 Tim Borer *22 \u2013 Mike Fall *23 \u2013 Glenn Ervine * Rui Farias ===ASL/APSL: 1988\u20131993=== In the summer of 1988, the Rowdies joined the third incarnation of the American Soccer League. They would stay in this league and its successor (the APSL) until the team folded after the 1993 season. During this six year stretch they achieved moderate success, winning one division title and making the playoffs four times. In 1992 they finished as runners-up to Colorado in the regular season, in the Professional Cup final, and in the APSL final as well. ====Year-by-year==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !League !Won !Lost !Points !Regular Season !Playoffs !U.S. Open Cup |- |1988 |ASL |10 |10 |30 |3rd, Southern |Did not qualify |Did not enter |- |1989 |ASL |12 |8 |35 | style=\"background:#b3b7ff;\"|1st, Southern |Semifinals |Did not enter |- |1990 |APSL |10 |10 |29 |2nd, ASL South |ASL Semifinals |Did not enter |- |1991 |APSL |8 |13 |69 |3rd, American |Did not qualify |Did not enter |- |1992 |APSL |10 |6 |87 |2nd | style=\"background:#ffebad;\"|Runners-up |Did not enter |- |1993 |APSL |12 |12 |118 |3rd |Semifinals |Did not enter |} ===Players, coaches, and honors \u2013 post-NASL era=== ====Honors \u2013 post-NASL==== Championships * 1992: ASPL (runner-up) * 1992: Professional Cup (runner-up) Division Titles * 1989: ASL Southern Division Leading Scorer * 1992: Jean Harbor (13 g, 4 a) Top Goalkeeper * 1988: Winston DuBose (0.75 gaa) Assists Leader * 1992: Kevin Sloan (6 a) Coach of the Year * 1992: Ricky Hill * 1993: Ken Fogarty FIFA World Cup players * Ars\u00e8ne Auguste (1974) * Wim Suurbier (1974, 1978) * Steve Trittschuh (1990) * Peter Vermes (1990) First Team All Star * 1988: Winston DuBose, Steve Wegerle * 1989: Winston DuBose, Steve Trittschuh, Steve Wegerle * 1990: David Byrne * 1992: Bill Andracki, Steve Trittschuh, Ricky Hill, Kevin Sloan, Jean Harbor * 1993: Steve Trittschuh Second Team All Star * 1986\u201387: Arnie Mausser * 1991: Marcelo Carrera * 1993: Paul Dougherty, Pierre Morice Honorable Mention * 1986\u201387: Steve Wegerle AISA All-Star Game selections * 1986\u201387: Steve Wegerle (starter) * 1986\u201387: Arnie Mausser (reserve) * 1986\u201387: Glenn Ervine (reserve) * 1986\u201387: Rub\u00e9n Astigarraga (injured) * 1986\u201387: Tim Walters (reserve) U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame members * 2013 Peter Vermes Other National Halls of Fame * 2016 Mark Lawrenson (England) ====Coaches \u2013 post-NASL==== * Rodney Marsh: 1984\u20131987 * Wim Suurbier: 1986\u201387 * Ken Fogarty: 1989\u20131992 * Steve Wegerle: 1991\u20131992 * Ricky Hill: 1992 * Ken Fogarty: 1993 ====Team captains \u2013 post-NASL==== * Dave Power: 1986\u20131989 * Derek Backman: 1990 * David Byrne: 1991 * Ricky Hill: 1992 * Terry Rowe: 1993 ==Legacy== ===Tampa Bay Mutiny: 1996\u20132001=== Due in large part to the Rowdies' historical success on and off the pitch, in 1994 MLS selected the Tampa Bay Mutiny as one of its original ten teams. The Mutiny won the first ever Supporters' Shield and qualified for the playoffs in four of their six seasons. Several former Rowdies, including Perry Van der Beck, Farrukh Quraishi, Roy Wegerle and Steve Trittschuh among others, were involved with the Mutiny as players, coaches, or front office staff. They also played for three seasons on the Rowdies' home pitch, Tampa Stadium. While the Mutiny have no connection to either Rowdies franchise, the team often paid tribute to the former Rowdies by wearing jerseys of their colors, and even wearing the logo of both the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Rowdies on the same shirt. MLS initially operated the team with the hope of selling to a private local owner. That became difficult after Malcolm Glazer bought the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League in 1995 and demanded that the community build a new stadium. Raymond James Stadium was completed in 1998 and Tampa Stadium was demolished soon thereafter, forcing the Mutiny to move to the new facility. The Bucs' lease agreement in their new home allowed them to keep most non- ticket revenues from all events at the facility, including Mutiny matches, severely damaging the financial viability of the soccer club. As financial losses mounted (up to $2 million a year), MLS desperately courted Glazer to buy the Mutiny. Glazer declined, so the league opted to fold the Mutiny, along with other Florida-based MLS team of that era, the Miami Fusion, in early 2002. ===New Rowdies: 2010\u2013present=== In 2008, it was announced that a new incarnation of the Tampa Bay Rowdies would play in a new second division NASL. They wore striped green and gold kits similar to the old Rowdies, and a star reflecting the 1975 championship. After several changes to the league, Tampa Bay finally kicked off in the summer of 2010, but they took the pitch as \"FC Tampa Bay\" due to a licensing dispute over the Rowdies name and trademarks. Beginning in 2012, the team reached an agreement to officially use the Rowdies name along with logos and other intellectual property of the original team, and won Soccer Bowl 2012. To date, the new Rowdies have honored both Mike Connell's and Perry Van der Beck's significant contribution to soccer, both on and off the field in the community at large, by retiring their jerseys. The Rowdies won the 2012 NASL Championship. As of 2017 they are currently members of the second division, United Soccer League, and have announced their intention to gain entry into MLS's next wave of expansion. ===Rowdies Cup=== The South Florida Bulls annually face their crosstown rivals, the Tampa Spartans, in an NCAA men's preseason soccer match which celebrates the Tampa Bay Area's rich soccer history. In addition to holding the Rowdies Cup trophy for the next 12 months, the winning side also get to hoist the actual Soccer Bowl trophy that was won originally by the Rowdies in 1975. The trophy is currently housed at Corbett Soccer Stadium on the USF campus. Formerly called the Mayor's Cup from 1979 until 2005, as of the 2019 edition, USF holds a 24\u201310\u20133 edge in the all-time series, which dates back to 1972. ==References== ==External links== * \"official\" Tampa Bay Rowdies site * Rowdies history * \"superfan\" Ian Morris' site Category:Defunct indoor soccer clubs in the United States Category:Soccer clubs in Tampa, Florida Category:Soccer clubs in Florida Category:Defunct soccer clubs in Florida Category:Association football clubs established in 1974 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1993 Category:American Soccer League (1988\u201389) teams Category:American Indoor Soccer Association teams Category:North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984) teams Category:American Professional Soccer League teams Category:Sports in St. Petersburg, Florida Category:1974 establishments in Florida Category:1993 disestablishments in Florida ",
