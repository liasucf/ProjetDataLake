    "text": "The East African springhare (Pedetes surdaster), is not closely related to the hare, which is a lagomorph, but is a member of the Pedetidae, a rodent family. ==Taxonomy== Pedetes surdaster was recognised by Matthee and Robinson in 1997 as a species distinct from the southern African springhare (P. capensis) based on genetic, morphological, and ethological differences.Matthee, C. A. and Robinson, T. J. 1997. Mitochondrial DNA phylogeography and comparative cytogenetics of the springhare, Pedetes capensis (Mammalia: Rodentia). Journal of Mammalian Evolution 4: 53-73. P. capensis from South Africa has fewer chromosomes (2n= 38) than does P. surdaster which has (2n = 40) and some other genetic variations.Matthee, C. A. and Robinson, T. J. 1997a. Molecular phylogeny of the springhare, Pedetes capensis, based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. Molecular Biology and Evolution 14 (1) : 20-29. The species was confirmed by Dieterlen in 2005. thumb Unlike South African springhare (Pedetes capensis), the second and third cervical vertebrae are fused in this species. ==Distribution== This species is found in central and southern Kenya and most of Tanzania. A single specimen has been recorded in Uganda near the Kenya border, at Mount Moroto. It is found from sea level up to an altitude over 2,000 m. ==Description== The East African springhare resembles a small kangaroo and is about the size of a rabbit. It is mid-brown, has large erect ears, very short fore legs, and long powerful hind legs.On Dipetalonema manson-bahri n.sp., from the Spring-hare, Pedetes surdaster larvalis, with a Note on its Development in Fleas It moves in bounds of up to 2 m and has a long tail fringed with black hairs which provides balance. It can sit up on its haunches like a squirrel.Pedetes surdaster (East African Spring-hare) ==Ecology== The East African springhare is nocturnal and spends the day in an extensive system of burrows. It lives in semiarid grassland habitats. The diet is the green parts of plants, roots and other vegetable matter, and occasionally insects. ==References== East African springhare Category:Mammals of Kenya Category:Mammals of Tanzania Category:Fauna of East Africa East African springhare ",
