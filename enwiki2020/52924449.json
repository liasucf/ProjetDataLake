    "text": "Teori Albino Zavascki (15 August 1948 \u2013 19 January 2017) was a Brazilian judge who served as a Minister of the Superior Court of Justice from 8 May 2003 until 29 November 2012, appointed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and as a Minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil from 29 November 2012 until his death in 19 January 2017, having been appointed to the position by President Dilma Rousseff. At the time of his death he was the justice in charge of the trials resulting from Operation Car Wash. == Death == Zavascki was killed in an air disaster in Paraty, Rio de Janeiro on 19 January 2017. Official enquiries into the crash began on 20 January and the cockpit voice recorder was recovered. Also killed were four other people on board, including the pilot, and , a partner in BTG Pactual, whose president, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, had been arrested in the Operation Car Wash investigation. More than two hundred politicians and business people were possibly implicated in a graft scheme that Zavascki was investigating. === Final Investigation Results === On 22.01.2018, the Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Preven\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Aeron\u00e1uticos, CENIPA) presented their final report. The conclusion was that there was no shortage of kerosene. Apparently the accident was caused by three major factors: * Bad visual climate conditions. At the time of the accident the horizontal visibility was 1500 meters and the rainfall was 25 mm/h. * Cultural practices of the pilots: the investigations found that several pilots who fly in this region rely heavily on their experience and don't follow strict security procedures, including informal practices which inhibit an adequate analysis of the risks involved in this specific landing procedure. * Spatial disorientation: as a consequence of the bad visibility, the flight curve executed, the low level above the sea and the stress of the pilot, he probably lost control of the plane. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Faxinal dos Guedes Category:Brazilian people of Polish descent Category:Supreme Federal Court of Brazil justices Category:21st-century judges Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Brazil ",
