She remained missing for 34 years, until her remains were discovered on July 24, 2019, by construction workers putting in a new pipeline 15 miles away from her home. ==Disappearance== On the evening of December 20, 1984, Jonelle was performing in a holiday concert at IntraWest Bank of Denver as a member of Greeley's Franklin Middle School Choir. Her family was not present at the concert as Jonelle's father was at his other daughter's basketball game and her mother had flown east to be with Jonelle's ill grandfather. At 8:15 PM that evening, Jonelle arrived at her home in Greeley, Colorado, after getting a ride from her friend DeeAnn Ross and DeeAnn's father. Shortly after 8:30 PM, Jonelle answered a phone call and took a message for her father. The phone call was the last time anyone was known to have spoken with Jonelle. Her father arrived home at 9:30 PM and found the garage door open, but no one was in the house, although Jonelle's shoes and shawl were near a heater in the family room, a place she often sat. Jonelle's older sister, Jennifer, got home at 10:00 PM, but had not seen her. Their father began to worry, and called police. The police arrived at 10:15 PM and found footprints in the snow, indicating that someone had been looking in the windows. There were no signs of a struggle or of forced entry. With snow on the ground, Jonelle's father thought it unlikely that she would go far without shoes. ==Family== The Matthews family lived at 320 43rd Avenue Court in Greeley, Colorado. The family consisted of Jonelle, her adoptive parents Jim and Gloria Matthews, and her older sister. Her father was the principal of Platte Valley Elementary School in Kersey, Colorado. For several weeks after the disappearance, police placed Jonelle's birth mother Terri Vierra-Martinez under surveillance, without telling her that her daughter had gone missing. Ten years later and after Jonelle was declared legally dead, Gloria received a letter from the birth mother, requesting permission to visit the child she gave up for adoption, something Jonelle always wanted. The birth mother had used a search consultant to help locate the child. The adoptive parents notified the birth mother about what happened, and the families became friends. Years after Jonelle's disappearance, Jim and Gloria Matthews retired and moved to Costa Rica. Jonelle's older sister moved to the Puget Sound region of Washington state where she married and goes by the name Jennifer Mogensen.https://www.cpr.org/2019/08/16/after-30-years-theyve-found-jonelle- matthews-now-the-family-seeks-her-killer/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us- news/idaho-man-charged-killing-colorado-girl-12-who-vanished-1984-n1243289 ==Public interest== The disappearance attracted public interest, including the President of the United States and members of Congress. President Ronald Reagan mentioned Jonelle Matthews in a speech on March 7, 1985 from Room 450 of the Old Executive Office Building. She was mentioned in the Congressional Record for the United States House of Representatives on April 2, 1985, page 7224. In 2010, the Greeley Tribune published another summary of the missing child\u2014still not found. As recently as 2018, Greeley Police had been re- contacting witnesses and applying the latest forensic advances to learn what happened to Jonelle. She appears in the International Center for Unidentified and Missing Persons' database. A chokecherry tree was planted nearly 30 years ago in front of Franklin Middle School, in memory of Jonelle. The tree is now gone, along with a plaque inscribed with Jonelle's name. ==Discovery of remains== After almost 35 years, excavators installing a pipeline discovered human remains at 4:50 PM on Tuesday, July 23, 2019, near the intersection of County Roads 34.5 and 49, at coordinates , about southeast of Jonelle's home. Based on DNA evidence, the Weld County Coroner's Office positively identified the remains as being those of Jonelle Matthews. the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has not released any information about how Matthews' cause of death, but have stated that the case is being treated as a homicide. Authorities are searching historical records to determine who owned or lived on the land where the remains were found. On September 13, 2019, Greeley Police Department announced a \"person of interest\" in Jonelle Matthews' abduction and murder: Steve Pankey, a former Greeley resident who ran for governor in Idaho in 2014 and 2018, and for lieutenant governor in 2010. His home in Colorado was searched under a warrant that stated investigators had probable cause to believe that Pankey abducted and murdered the girl that night.

Greeley Police Commander Roy Smith stated that Pankey \"had made repeated efforts to speak with detectives\" about the Matthews case. But after detectives traveled to Twin Falls, Idaho on August 15, 2019, Pankey refused to answer questions. Commander Smith stated Pankey has not been charged with Jonelle's murder, but he is being investigated in relation to her death.https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/crime/article234982707.html On October 13, 2020, authorities announced that Steven D.
