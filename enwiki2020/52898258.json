Studying is very easy for Alik, but there is one problem: Rainbow is not able to jump high, and therefore is among the worst in gym class. In his fantasies Alik floats on the table like a gondola on the sea and communicates with the Siren, who suddenly offers Rainbow to fulfill his innermost desire. Without hesitating, Alik asks to be gifted with the ability to jump up at any height. Siren performs the boy's request, but stipulates one condition: if Rainbow ever tells a single lie, the gift will disappear immediately! Endowed with the magic force Alik becomes a hit in gym class. The overwhelmed teacher immediately sends Rainbow to the athletics sports team. But wanting to bail out a girl whom Alik loves, Rainbow lies, the gift disappears and now Alik can not even jump through a straw ... The situation could be remedied by using the help of Ivan Ivanovich. This is the legendary Ivan the Fool, whom the evil witch turned into a stump. During his walks, Alik finds this stump, carves a wooden figure from it, and thus revives Ivan Ivanovich. They have a lot of fun talking and Ivan Ivanovich constantly offers to help Rainbow. But Alik decides to reach the heights of sport by himself, with the help of tedious training rather than magical power ... ==Cast== * Dmitriy Maryanov \u2013 Alik Rainbow (voice by Dmitry Kharatyan, singing by Vladimir Presnyakov Jr.) * Mikhail Boyarsky \u2013 Alik's father * Elena Aminova \u2013 Alik's mother * Ekaterina Parfyonova \u2013 Dasha, Alik's classmate (singing by Victoria Vradiy) * Yuri Kuklachev \u2013 Ivan Ivanovich (voice by Mikhail Kononov) * Olga Mashnaya \u2013 Butyrina Irina Mikhailovna (BIM), physical training teacher (voice by Olga Gromova) * Tatiana Basova \u2013 Svetlana Mikhailovna, history teacher / Siren (voice by Inga Tretyakova, singing by Alla Pugacheva) * Galina Polskikh \u2013 Alexandra Ilinichna, coach * Anatoliy Krasnik \u2013 Borshev, Alik's classmate * Yuri Khoroshilov \u2013 Fokin, Alik's classmate * Elena Popova \u2013 Lenochka * Yuri Rudchenko \u2013 foreman * Yuri Senkevich \u2013 cameo * Rait Ozols \u2013 Valery Paschenko ==Soundtrack== The film became very popular in the Soviet Union because of the numerous musical numbers (songwriters composer Yury Chernavsky and poet Leonid Derbenyov), directed in the music video format, and it is with this film began the popularity of Vladimir Presnyakov Jr., who sung all of the protagonist's songs.
