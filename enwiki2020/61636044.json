    "text": "Chasing Summer is the third studio album by American R&B; artist SiR. It was released on August 30, 2019 by Top Dawg Entertainment and RCA. The album includes guest features from Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, Jill Scott, Smino, Kadhja Bonet, Sabrina Claudio, and Zacari. ==Singles and promotion== On August 8, 2019, SiR released the leading single of the album \"Hair Down\" featuring Kendrick Lamar. The music video was also released on the same day directed by Psycho Films' Jack Begert. In April 2020, the single for \"John Redcorn\" was released with a music video inspired by King of the Hill. ==Critical reception== Reviewing the album for Pitchfork, Dani Blum said SiR took a darker approach with this album claiming it is a \"sad and gauzy R&B; collection\", saying \"at 14 songs, the album feels bloated. Its swirl of features are hit or miss. Smino and Kendrick Lamar inject life into the spaces SiR hollows out.\" The writer continued to say \"The effect is an album that bristles with paranoia. SiR creates conditions in which actual relationships are impossible: He's always in the wrong place at the wrong time; he replays conversations that never happened; he waits for calls he won\u2019t take.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Sir (singer) albums Category:Top Dawg Entertainment albums Category:Albums produced by Boi-1da Category:Albums produced by Sounwave Category:Albums produced by Tae Beast ",
