It is located away from the state capital, the city of Panaji and away from the city of Mapusa. Even today, one can visit this area and see the distinct churches, graveyards and buildings all with a Portuguese air. Chor\u00e3o is accessible by the ferry from Ribandar, is mainly known for its beautiful bird sanctuary. If you arrive here with your own transport it's worth a ride through the countryside to little Chor\u00e3o village, with its handful of whitewashed village churches and picturesque Portuguese homes. ==Etymology== Etymologically, the island's name \"Choddnnem\" is derived from the Sanskrit word .The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 1 Etimos das Aldeas de Goa, em o Oriente Portuguese, Chantre F.X VAZ, Vol XIII (1916) Page 280 Chudda means head wear and Monnim (Mani) signifies some thing worn in the shape of a necklace or a jewel of cylindrical shape.The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 1 Etimos das Aldeas de Goa, em o Oriente Portuguese, Chantre F.X VAZ, Vol XIII(1916) Page 280 It was the Portuguese who called it Chor\u00e3o.

In Goa the Devadasis were called Kalavants. According to P. D Xavier \"the Kalavants system might have originated from the widows who ran away and took shelter in the village temples to escape sati, the inhuman practice of burning the widow on her husband\u201ds pyre.\"\"The Church and Society in 16th Century Goa\" by P. D Xavier 1988 The tonsuring of widows was also abolished by the Portuguese like Sati system.Some legal aspects of Socio Economic life in Portuguese Goa In Goan Society through the ages By Kamat Pratima 1987, Asian Publication Series, page 94. === Christianization of Chor\u00e3o === The island was Christianised by the Jesuits as they did the adjoining islands of Divar and Salcete. In 1510, this area was one of the first to be conquered by the Portuguese and by 1552, the island of Chor\u00e3o had a population of just above 3,000, 300 of whom were Christian and by this time, a small church was built. By the end of 1559, over 1,200 had accepted baptism in total. The following year, in 1560, the first bishop from the Jesuit order, Dom Jo\u00e3o Nunes de Barreto set up residence in Chor\u00e3o, which eventually became a Noviciate.Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians, Alan Machado Prabhu, I.J.A. Publications, 1999, p.101 Jesuit Missionary and writer Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is in his letter dated 10 December 1560 says \"Most of these Brahmins can speak Portuguese and are happy to learn the doctrine pertaining to Faith and Morals\".The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 25&27 With incredible brevity the whole of the Island of Chor\u00e3o prepared itself for the general baptism which was fixed for 8 August 1560. The archbishop along with some priests visited Chor\u00e3o Island first, followed by Father Melchior Carneiro and the provincial. It being the month of August, a time when it rains heavily, the repairs of the church were hurriedly completed. The Viceroy Dom Constantino of Braganza came with retinue and brought his musicians who played on a variety of instruments like trumpets, drums and charamelas. Viceroy Dom Constantino of Braganza also stood as god-father (sponsor) to the important men of the place treating them with love and affection. This alone was more than sufficient to keep the neophytes happy. As many as possible were baptised that evening. Father Joseph Ribeiro stayed behind and baptized the remaining. In all, therefore the number of the converts reached 1207, the greater part of the people of the Island having already been baptized before.The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 27&28 Documentacao vol.VIII Page 92 Fr\u00f3is says that a greater number of those who embraced Christianity in Chor\u00e3o were Chaudarins (Toddy-Tappers). They also made better Christians and being more homely, were easy to be converted. They made their confession during Lent, some confessed their sins fortnightly, others monthly and six or seven of them every Sunday and they received Communion in the Church of Our Lady of Grace Church (Chor\u00e3o Island).The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 21 Some Chor\u00e3o women, on the occasion of their baptism, wore some much gold to the extent of astonishing the missionaries. They belong to the caste of Chardo.Conversions and Citizenry : Goa under Portugal, 1510-1610 By D\u00e9lio de Mendon\u00e7a 1958 Page 357 In 1566 Chor\u00e3o had 2470 converts and few Brahmins had promised to become Roman Catholics later. In 1582 there were three thousand converts in Chor\u00e3o and all its inhabitants were Roman Catholics and many came from outside to receive baptism.Conversions and Citizenry : Goa under Portugal, 1510-1610 By D\u00e9lio de Mendon\u00e7a 1958 Page 408 === Ilha dos Fidalgos === A large number of magnificent building with storeys rose up surrounded by lovely flower garden and sometimes due to want of space attached to one another. It was here that most of the nobility and rich resided, spending a life of comfort and luxury. This was the reason why Chor\u00e3o Island became known as \"Ilha dos Fidalgos\" (Island of Noblemen).The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 4 Tradition has it that when these Fidalgos went for Mass, a special place was set apart to protect their superfine umbrellas, chiefly made of red damask.The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 5 The fidalgos would be found often lounging near the ferry point on the south-eastern side of the island, waiting for patmarios (sail boats) to cross over to Old Goa or Ribandar. The Fidalgos as well as the common folk took great delight in chewing on snacks available then and gulped down hot tea in the shacks. They enjoyed the freshly steamed merem (snack) and sipped the hot cha (tea) at that spot. === Cheese of Chor\u00e3o === Chor\u00e3o was once famous for its cheese. Cattle of whatever kind and type, would breed and thrive well on the island and milk was supplied in abundance. Queijo da Ilha de Chor\u00e3o (Island Cheese of Chor\u00e3o) was a wonderful cheese that had been produced since the 16th century. Chor\u00e3o Cheese was well liked and appreciated by Portuguese Gentry in Goa. Chor\u00e3o Cheese used to be exported even as far as Macau. Due to immigration of Islanders, this Cheese Industry got extinct in the 19th century.The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 2 === Forts of Chor\u00e3o === Two well equipped fortresses guarded Chor\u00e3o Island from the incursion of Marathas. The Fortaleza de S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Chor\u00e3o (Saint Bartholomew Fort of Chor\u00e3o) was built in 1720 in the north eastern part of Chor\u00e3o Island. It had a lovely castle within its enclosures. Among other things it had eleven turrets (tinha onze pecas) and was used for the defense of the fort that surrounded Chor\u00e3o island and those of Calvim.The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page3 According to Sketch of the City of Goa by Jose Nicolau da Fonseca, it was probably erected at the same time as the Fort of Naroa. The Saint Bartholomew Fort was abandoned in 1811 and now lies in total ruins.An Historical and Archaeological Sketch of the City of Goa (1878) Page 50 By Jos\u00e9 Nicolau Da Fonseca, Thacker & Co Ltd ===Epidemics in Chor\u00e3o Island=== Main Article : Epidemics in Chor\u00e3o Island ===Education Institutions=== In 1559, the Jesuits founded a school in Chor\u00e3o for the children of the village. It is recorded that the number of them at one time reached 400. Reading, writing and Christian doctrine were taught in this school. According to the belief of the people the school was functioning in a building situated at the western part of the hill built as a residence of the Jesuits by Fr. Dom Jo\u00e3o Nunes Baretto S.J. Patriarch of Ethiopia. The Konkani language which was a great help for the conversion work was probably taught in this school. It was meant for the Jesuits.The Island of Chor\u00e3o (A Historical Sketch) 1962 By Francisco Xavier Gomes Cat\u00e3o page 45 ==== Seminary of Chor\u00e3o ==== Main Article : Real Col\u00e9gio de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Chor\u00e3o ==== Latin School ==== According to a decree issued on 19 April 1871 after a resolution had been passed by the Communidade of Chor\u00e3o on 6 February 1870, it was decided to establish on the Island of Chor\u00e3o at the expense of the Communidade of Chor\u00e3o a School of Latin, the payment of the Professor who was to be appointed by the Government of the State.Boletim Official No.34 of 1871. ==== English School ==== In 1944 Fr. Elias Gama wanted to built a new English School in Chor\u00e3o Island, he could not do it as there was one founded by Mr. Januario Pereira of Boctavaddo, St Barthomews High School, though it was not actually running.

Though immigration was allowed during the secular Salazar regime, it has been put into full gear after the Annexation of Goa by India. Many temples have been rebuilt since the last century. One example is the temple of Shri Devaki Krishna Bhumika Mallinath built on 11 January 1934. == Bird Sanctuary == The Chor\u00e3o Island is attractive primarily because of its amazing flora and fauna.
