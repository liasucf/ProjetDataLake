One of the major inspirations for his music is astronomy. Based on the trajectories of the planets in the solar system, he created the \"planetal scale\", a mode consisting of the pitches C#, D, F#, G#, and A. Later, he discovered to his surprise that this was exactly the same as the Japanese Kumajoshi mode, which is also known as the Japanese pentatonic scale. Sisask is a Roman Catholic, and much of what he composes is sacred music. ==Some of his works== * Starry Sky Cycle (Estonian: \"T\u00e4histaeva ts\u00fckkel\") (1980\u20131987) * Gloria Patri (1988) * Pleiads (\"Plejaadid\") (1989) * Milky Way (\"Linnutee galaktika\") (1990) * Andromeda (\"Andromeda galaktika\") (1991) * Benedictio (for mixed chorus) (1991) * Christmas oratorio (\"J\u00f5uluoratoorium\") (1992) * Magnificat * Missa Nr. 1 * Symbiotic Symphony (\"S\u00fcmbiootiline S\u00fcmfoonia\") * Comet Hyakutake * Ave Sol * Missa Nr. 4 op. 46: Christmas mass (\"J\u00f5ulumissa\") * Polaris (\"P\u00f5hjanael\") * Veni Sancte Spiritus ==External links== * ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century classical composers Category:21st-century classical composers Category:Estonian Roman Catholics Category:Tallinn Music High School alumni Category:People from Rapla Category:Male classical composers Category:Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre alumni Category:20th- century Estonian composers Category:21st-century Estonian composers Category:20th-century male musicians Category:21st-century male musicians Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Star, 4th Class ",
