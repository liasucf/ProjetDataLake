    "text": "Ayman ibn Ubayd (, also spelled Aiman ibn Ubaid), was an early Muslim and companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. He was the son of Umm Ayman, who helped raise Muhammad, by her first husband Ubayd ibn Zayd of the Banu Khazraj tribe. Through his mother's second marriage to Zayd ibn Harithah, he was the half-brother of Usama ibn Zayd.Baladhuri, vol.1, p.96 Ayman was killed fighting for the Muslim forces against enemy Arab tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.mahallati, vol.2, p. 26 Ayman's son, al-Hajjaj ibn Ayman was born during the lifetime of the Prophet and ahadith (traditions) of the Prophet Muhammad have been quoted from al-Hajjaj in Islamic literature, including in the Sahih al-Bukhari.Husayn Malika Ashtiyani, Bilal of Africa, p. 127 == Background == Ayman was the son of Barakah, an Abyssinian.Zuhri, p 177; al- Tabarani, vol. 25, p. 86 She served as a slave in the household of the Prophet's parents, Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Aminah bint Wahb. She became Muhammad's slave after the death of Aminah.Ibn Sa`d, vol. 8, p. 223; Baladhuri, vol.1, p. 96 Following Aminah's death in Al-Abwa, Barakah looked after Muhammad, and moved with him to the household of his grandfather Abdul- Muttalib ibn Hashim in Mecca, where she served him during his childhood Ibn Qutaybah, p. 150 and afterwards,Baladhuri, vol.1, p.472 in his adulthood.Ibn Hajar, al-Ithaba, vol.8, p. 380 When Muhammad married Khadija, he arranged for Barakah's freedom and marriage to a Khazrajite companion named Ubayd ibn Zayd. Through this marriage, Ayman was born, and thus she was known as \"Umm Ayman\" (\"Mother of Ayman\").Ibn Sa`d, vol. 8, p. 223; Ibn Sa`d, vol. 4, p. 61 Ayman's father, Ubayd ibn Zayd, was killed fighting in the Battle of Khaybar. == Relationship with the Prophet == Early Islamic sources refer to Ayman as one of the Muhajirun, meaning that he migrated from Mecca to Medina in order to escape the religious persecution of the Quraysh in Mecca. Like his mother, Ayman entered into the service of the Prophet Muhammad and was in charge of his water jug with which he made ablution.Al Bidayah wa al Nihayah, vol. 6 pg. 39 He was also a shepherd and cared for eight goats owned by the Prophet.Husayn Malika Ashtiyani, Bilal of Africa, p. 119 A hadith is reported from him. He affirms that the Prophet Muhammad only cut off the hand of a thief if the item stolen had the value of a shield, at minimum, and a shield in those days was equal to the value of one gold coin.Sunan al Nasa\u2019i, vol. 5, Book 46, Hadith: 4946 This hadith is corroborated by a report in Sahih al- Bukhari.Sahih al Bukhari, vol. 8, Book 81, Hadith: 788 == Death == Ayman was killed fighting for the Muslim army in the Battle of Hunayn.mahallati, vol.2, p. 26 Ibn Kathir writes that according to Ibn Ishaq, Jabir ibn Abd Allah, who witnessed the battle, reported that the Muslim army were panicked by a surprise attack from the enemy and many men fled the battlefield. However, a group of Muhajirun stood firmly and defended the Prophet on the battlefield. These men were Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith, Fadl ibn Abbas, Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, Usama ibn Zayd and Ayman ibn Ubayd. Ayman was killed that day whilst defending the Prophet Muhammad.Ibn Kathir, The Battles of the Prophet, p. 175-176 For this reason, Ayman is considered a martyr in Islam. After his martyrdom, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, the Prophet's uncle and one of those that fought with Ayman to defend the Prophet, composed a poem praising his steadfastness and bravery.Husayn Malika Ashtiyani, Bilal of Africa, p. 119 == See also == * Umm Ayman * Usama ibn Zayd * Bilal ibn Rabah * List of non-Arab Sahabah * Sahabah * Afro-Arabs * Ayman * Aiman == References == == Bibliography == * * * * * * Category:Non-Arab Sahabah Category:630 deaths ",
