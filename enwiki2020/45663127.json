    "text": "The Vintage Caravan are a rock band from \u00c1lftanes, Iceland. The band was formed in 2006 by \u00d3skar Logi \u00c1g\u00fastsson and Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Reynisson before bassist Alexander \u00d6rn N\u00famason joined after the first studio album. There has been just one line-up change since the founding of the band when Stef\u00e1n Ari Stef\u00e1nsson replaced Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Reynisson on drums in 2015. The band have released three studio albums. ==History== In 2006, 12 year-old school friends \u00c1g\u00fastsson (guitar and vocals) and Reynisson (drums) formed the band. Serious work only began in 2009 and within two years the band self-published their eponymous first album. In early 2012, the band signed a deal with Icelandic record label Sena ahead of work for their second album. Alexander \u00d6rn N\u00famason joined shortly after on bass. A second album Voyage was released in 2012 initially by Sena. The band signed to Nuclear Blast shortly after the release of Voyage. This led to a Expand Your Mind music video produced and released by the German record label. The short film shows the psychedelic 'trips' the three members experience. As of July 2015, the video reached 400,000 hits on YouTube becoming the most viewed online song by the band. Nuclear Blast re-released Voyage to a much wider audience. 2014 saw the band playing at festivals such as Roadburn Festival, Wacken Open Air and Hard Rock Hell. In April 2015, the band announced on Facebook that drummer Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Reynisson had left the band for personal reasons however still remained good friends with the remaining band members. In the same post, Stef\u00e1n Ari was introduced to fans as the new drummer of the band. On the 15th May 2015, Arrival was released with Nuclear Blast as the band's third studio album. This was the first record since the recent line-up change. ===Personal life=== In many interviews, the band have confirmed they are good friends with fellow Nuclear Blast counterparts Blues Pills. In 2014 following a tour of Europe, the band moved from Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland to S\u00f8nderborg, Denmark. The band's new location is near to the border of Germany, where their record label Nuclear Blast is based. ==Style== According to Fred Thomas of AllMusic, the band complied within the genres of classic rock, proto (early) metal and progressive rock. Nuclear Blast however describe them as more psychedelic rock. The band themselves describes their style and sound as 'classic hard rock of the 60's and 70's with a powerful attitude and a modern twist'. The band's influences include Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Mastodon, Rush and Cream. The band explain that they love \"hard hitting riff fueled music\". ==Band members== Current members *\u00d3skar Logi \u00c1g\u00fastsson \u2013 lead vocals, electric guitar (2006\u2013present) *Alexander \u00d6rn N\u00famason \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (2012\u2013present) *Stef\u00e1n Ari Stef\u00e1nsson \u2013 drums, percussion (2015\u2013present) Former members *Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Reynisson \u2013 drums, percussion (2006\u20132015) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *The Vintage Caravan (2011) (self-released) *Voyage (2014) (Sena) *Arrival (2015) (Nuclear Blast) *Gateways (2018) (Nuclear Blast) ==References== Category:Icelandic rock music groups Category:Icelandic musical trios Category:Musical groups established in 2006 ",
