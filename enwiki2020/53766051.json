    "text": "\"Sweet Creature\" is a song recorded by English singer and songwriter Harry Styles for his self-titled debut studio album (2017). The song was written by Styles and Kid Harpoon, and its production was handled by the latter, Jeff Bhasker, Alex Salibian and Tyler Johnson. It was released as a promotional single ahead of the album release. ==Composition== \"Sweet Creature\" is a folk and soft rock acoustic ballad. Over \"tumbling and sprightly\" guitar picking, Styles performs simple harmonies and background runs. Compared to a lullaby, it discusses the strength of a bond that endures through time, and the potency of love for another. ==Critical reception== Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said \"Sweet Creature\" is one of the album's highlights, \"full of gentle Cafe Wha? guitar and straightforwardly earnest singing.\" In Billboard, Da'Shan Smith wrote that \"Sweet Creature\" showcases \"Styles' range and ability to hit some pretty spectacular power notes.\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly opined the \"strummy lullaby,\" along with the song \"Two Ghosts\", are \"delicate sketches, wistful and pretty.\" BBC music reporter Mark Savage called it the album's \"most effective, direct song.\" Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times described the song as \"honeyed croon.\" Leonie Coope of NME felt the song \"could have as easily have been written about Joni Mitchell as much as his ex Taylor Swift.\" Writing for Exclaim!, Corey van den Hoogenband described it as a \"Beatles Jr. song that, although suspiciously reminiscent of \"Blackbird,\" is pleasant enough.\" The Straits Times Anjali Raguraman agreed that it is a \"modern-day take\" on the mentioned song, with \"its delicate guitar picking.\" Eve Barlow of Variety believed it attempts \"to ape the sort of picked-out acoustic strums\" of a \"Hey There Delilah\" by Plain White T's, \"Norwegian Wood\" by The Beatles or Fleetwood Mac's \"Never Going Back Again\". Rick Pearson for Evening Standard thought \"the folksy skip of [the song] is as good as anything on Ed Sheeran's Divide. In Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot wrote that the \"trifle\" song \"pulls everything back but voice and guitar to make Styles appear older than his years,\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 37 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Italy (FIMI) | 85 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Slovakia (Singles Digit\u00e1l Top 100) | 55 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1900 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s ballads Category:2017 songs Category:English folk songs Category:Harry Styles songs Category:Songs written by Harry Styles Category:Songs written by Kid Harpoon Category:Song recordings produced by Jeff Bhasker Category:Folk ballads ",
