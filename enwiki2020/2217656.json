He regards the following as the elements of chess strategy: # The center # Play on the open files # Play on the seventh and eighth ranks # The passed pawns # The pin # Discovered checks # Exchanging # The pawn-chain ===Positional Play=== The next part, \"Positional Play\" (), is based largely on the elements taught in the first part. In it, Nimzowitsch tells how to play for a positional advantage. In particular, he argues that the center can be effectively controlled using pieces instead of pawns. This concept, now widely accepted, is one of the fundamental principles of hypermodernism. ===Illustrative Games=== \"Illustrative Games\" contains annotated versions of fifty of Nimzowitsch's career games, which he refers to throughout the text. ==Editions== * The original German edition was published in 1925.
