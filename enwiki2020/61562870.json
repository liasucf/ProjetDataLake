Both Sides Now: Vee-Jay Album Discography, Part 2: Main Series VJS-1071 to VJS-1154 (1963-1965), accessed August 20, 2019 ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Bruce Eder stated: \"Jimmy Reed -- not a celebrated 12-string guitar player like Leadbelly or any of the other renowned instrumentalists who came up in Leadbelly's wake -- cut this acoustic 12-string instrumental album, which has become an enduring classic of the genre. Reed was as skilled at presenting his guitar work as he was as a singer ... Consisting of recognizable Reed originals and a couple of other blues standards thrown in, the music comes off very well, mixing electric guitar with acoustic 12-string and Reed's harmonica substituting for the vocal parts ... The result is yet another classic album by Reed, and one of the more straightfoward and accessible bodies of blues played on 12-string that one can find\". == Track listing == All compositions by Jimmy Reed except where noted # \"Bright Lights, Big City\" \u2013 2:29 # \"St. Louis Blues\" (W.
