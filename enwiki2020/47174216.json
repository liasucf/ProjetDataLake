S. Geological Survey until 1970. California, Ramona Quadrangle, 1903 reprinted 1941 It was named after Jim Hamilton, an African American man who settled there as a squatter on the east end of the Rancho Pauba in the later 1860s. The 1870 census of Temecula showed James Hamilton was a 49-year-old widower, living on a 160-acre farm with his four children. The farm was evaluated at $5,000, more than the value of other similar farms in the area. Eventually Hamilton lost this land in a lawsuit over ownership of the Rancho Pauba in the early 1880s.

Hamilton Creek, originating east of Anza, still bears his name. Hamilton School in Anza was also named after him.Steve Lech, Pioneers of Riverside County: The Spanish, Mexican, and Early American Periods, Arcadia Publishing, Dec 10, 2012, Notes, Chapter 4, note 58.
