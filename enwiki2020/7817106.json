Miguel Aceves Mej\u00eda, or \"the King of the falsetto\" as he was popularly known, was born in El Paso, Texas, and was registered in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in the state of Chihuahua. He became a popular Mexican film star during its golden age and was widely regarded for his interpretations of various Mexican musical genres, particularly the ranchera. Originally part of a traveling theater company, Aceves began recording for the first time in 1938 with the trio Los Porte\u00f1os. At the beginning of his career he interpreted mainly boleros, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. During his career he recorded more than 1600 songs on 140 discs and starred in 64 films. He was one of the three greatest of all time with his dearly friends Pedro Infante and Jorge Negrete. He was the first Mexican Folkloric singer to travel around the American Continent with world tours, accompanied by the Mariachi Vargas of Tecatitl\u00e1n. His fame took him in a tour to Spain where he filmed two movies with the great actress and singer La Faraona Lola Flores. Among his greatest hits are El Pastor, La del Rebozo Blanco, Se Me Hizo F\u00e1cil, Yo Ten\u00eda un Chorro de Voz, Vaya con Dios, La Malague\u00f1a Salerosa, El Jinete, El Crucifijo de Piedra and Cuatro Caminos. He was noted for composing such songs as El Pescado Nadador and Oh, Gran Dios, even though his fort\u00e9 was primarily as a singer in his own right. Following the rise to popularity of Jalisco-born ranchera singer, David Z\u00e1izar. Mej\u00eda's status as \"the King of the falsetto\" was given to Z\u00e1izar by the public. In 1945, Aceves began dedicating himself solely to singing and, following the deaths of Pedro Infante and Jorge Negrete, ventured into the world of cinema. In 1959 he appeared in Amor se dice cantando. Aceves died just a few days short of his 91st birthday on 6 November 2006 in Mexico City. As is tradition in Mexico, his body lay under the rotunda of the Palacio de las Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) in Mexico City. This honour is reserved for only the greatest Mexican figures of arts and letters. == Filmography == * Los apuros de dos gallos (1963) * Dos gallos y dos gallinas (1963) * Los valientes no mueren (1962) * Camino de la horca (1962) * Si yo fuera millonario (1962) * El asesino enmascarado (1962) * El rey de la pistola (1962) * Los cinco halcones (1962) * Asesinos de la lucha libre (1962) * Mart\u00edn Santos el llanero (1962) * Viva Chihuahua (1961) * \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1s, coraz\u00f3n (1961) * El Buena Suerte (1961) * Paloma brava (1961) * Los fanfarrones (1960) * Bala perdida (1960) * \u00a1Viva quien sabe querer!
