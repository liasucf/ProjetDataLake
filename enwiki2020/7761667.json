    "text": "Ceau\u0219ima () is a vernacular word construction in Romanian sarcastically comparing the policies of former Communist leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu to the nuclear attack on Hiroshima.Tism\u0103neanu, Note 3, p.57 This portmanteau term was coined in the 1980s to describe the huge urban areas of Bucharest that Ceau\u0219escu ordered torn down during the final few years of his tenure. Significant portions of the historic center of Bucharest were demolished to accommodate standardized apartment blocks and government buildings, including the grandiose Centrul Civic and the House of the Republic palace. The term has also been used to describe other actions of Ceau\u0219escu not linked to the demolition of Bucharest, such as intense pollution in the Transylvanian city of Cop\u0219a Mic\u0103. == Systematization == Ceau\u0219escu considered it necessary to his program of systematization to demolish vast portions of the historic and central parts of Bucharest and replace them with giant representation buildings and high-density standardized apartment blocks. The latter was rooted in the ideology of \"edifying the multilaterally developed socialist society\" and it was considered an epitome of the Leninist formula of the \"fight between old and new\" (see Historical materialism). Started in 1974, and implemented some six years later, the program implied a comprehensive nationwide campaign of demolition, resettlement, and reconstruction. Historian Dinu C. Giurescu writes: > The urban systematization conducted by the communist regime has destroyed 29 > traditional towns to 85-90% and also has heavily mutilated other 37 cities, > including Bucharest.Giurescu, \"De la \"Sistematizare\" la Planul Urbanistic. > Ceau\u0219escu redivivus\", in Formula AS 716, 8\u201315 May 2006 The main target of the systematization was Bucharest. Apartment blocks in Titan The triggering event of systematization in Bucharest was the major earthquake of 1977, which predominantly struck edifices built before World War II (preceded by another major earthquake, that of November 10, 1940), while the structures dating from the communist era held out well. This was interpreted by the communist regime as a proof of its superiority over the pre-war regimes, and led to a paradigm change in its urban development policy. Up to that time, the communist regime had concentrated on the clearance and redevelopment of slums like Groapa Floreasca or Groapa lui Ouatu (1950s) as well as on new high-density urban settlements in the suburbs, such as Bucure\u0219tii Noi (1950s), Balta Alb\u0103 (later Titan), Berceni, Giurgiului or Drumul Taberei (1960s), while the city remained basically untouched. The impacts of the earthquake, more severe in the central city, provided both ideological and technical arguments for urban intervention in historical Bucharest. The immediate consequences of this new urban policy were the demolition of monuments like Enei Church (founded 1611, rebuilt 1723; with murals by Gheorghe Tattarescu), the Neo-gothic Casa Cerchez or the elegant Baia Central\u0103 public bath house and the suppression of the Authority for the National Heritage.M\u0103rgineanu, pp.125-136 However, the most pervasive consequence was the commitment of Ceau\u0219escu to accomplish his earlier vision of the monumental Centrul Civic (\"civic centre\"), which would concentrate and symbolize the emblems of his power. Location of the House of the People in the map of Bucharest. Though the decision to build the new civic centre in the very heart of Bucharest was made in 1978, it took some six years for Ceau\u0219escu to impose a wide-ranging reshaping. During that period, interventions in historical Bucharest, like rebuilding the traditional Calea Mo\u0219ilor with uniform concrete apartment blocks, were still carried out respecting the pre- existing urban configuration. This can be explained by the significant opposition the project encountered from a majority of leading experts.Giurescu, p.23, 56, 126 To realize his project, Ceau\u0219escu brought together some 400 urban planning professionals, visiting them at least once a week during the 1980s and providing what the press called \"valuable instructions\" (indica\u021bii pre\u021bioase) in front of a large scale model of Bucharest.Leahu, p.32 Since Ceau\u0219escu succeeded in quelling disagreement and opposition expressed by authoritative architects, art historians and intellectuals, a coherent reshaping project never came to light. Instead, through what was largely a step-by-step approach, the implementation of Casa Republicii (\"House of the Republic\"), now Palatul Parlamentului, (\"Palace of the Parliament\") could be imposed. The subsequent opening of the oversized Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism was but the consequence of architectural requirements aiming at creating a congruent perspective to the colossal House of the People.Leahu, p.48 The final result was compared to both the Pyongyang of Kim Il SungBehr, p.165 and Adolf Hitler's Germania.Deletant, p.114-116; Verdery, p.134 After the project had been officially finalised, the frequent interventions of Ceau\u0219escu continued to modify the situation on the ground, leading mostly to further demolitions.Leahu, p.50 The mass destructions in Bucharest began in 1983 and continued up until late 1988. Construction was very intense during the first year, so that in June 1984 the Ceau\u0219escus could inaugurate the workings of what would become the House of the People.Evenimentul Zilei ==Areas of demolition== The destroyed urban areas extended over several informal districts (cartiere), some of exceptional architectural and/or historical significance.Acuarele Bucure\u0219tiului Pierdut (\"Watercolours of Lost Bucharest\"), painted by Gheorghe Leahu - with comments by George Pruteanu - accessed online 7 November 2006 Since both the urban project and its execution were much of a trial-and-error process, demolitions were often arbitrary.\"Ca s\u0103 poat\u0103 'coordona' imensul m\u0103cel edilitar, tovar\u0103\u0219ului i s-a montat, la Sala Giule\u0219ti, o instala\u021bie nemaiv\u0103zut\u0103 \u00een lume: o machet\u0103 c\u00eet toate zilele, de 12/12 m, a \u00eentregului Bucure\u0219ti, peste care s-a amenajat un pod rulant \u0219i ac\u021bionat electric, unde tovar\u0103\u0219ul \u0219i tovar\u0103\u0219a se plimbau \u00eenainte \u0219i \u00eenapoi, \u00eenarma\u021bi cu ni\u0219te baghete lungi din v\u00eerful c\u0103rora se n\u0103\u0219teau indica\u021biile\". Leahu, p. 36.\\--> However, a certain west to east pattern of demolition can be ascertained: the western area of Uranus as well as approximately 92% of the adjoining eastern area of V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti were destroyed, while the areas situated farther east like Dude\u0219ti and Theodor Speran\u021bia were demolished only along the large boulevards which had to be created there. ===Uranus area=== The Uranus district was the foremost target of the flattening, since it had an exceptional geographic value, being situated on the most prominent height of Bucharest; this was where the House of the People was to be placed. The height on which the Uranus city district was located, called Dealul Spirii, was radically reshaped in order to make it bear the House of the People. Another height belonging to the Uranus area, of lesser dimensions, was the Mihai Vod\u0103 Hill. The destruction of the Uranus area reached the shore of the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba River (Splaiul Independen\u021bei) on the north side, the streets Ha\u0219deu and Isvor on the east side, Sabinelor and Calea Rahovei streets on the south side, cutting a straight line of some 1,200 meters on the north-south axis through a dense urban area along the streets Bateriilor and Logof\u0103tul Nestor. Other important streets of the Uranus district were: Uranus, Mihai Vod\u0103, Pu\u021bul cu Ap\u0103 Rece, Caz\u0103rmii, Militari, Schitul Maicilor, Banul Mihalcea, Meteorilor, Minotaurului, Arionoaia. The entire demolished area covered approximately 154 hectares. The Uranus neighbourhood is remembered for its special atmosphere; the area was both residential and monumental: many elegant houses and villas, as well as some low-density apartments blocks constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coexisted with salient historical and architectural monuments.Album cu fotografii din Bucure\u0219ti: Bucure\u0219tiul disp\u0103rut (2/4) (photographs of some of the lost buildings) Thus, the fortified Mihai Vod\u0103 Monastery, founded by the Wallachian prince Michael the Brave in 1589-1591, and housing the State Archives since 1866, was pulled down.Photo of the demolished M\u0103n\u0103stirea Mihai Vod\u0103 Moreover, the entire Mihai Vod\u0103 Hill has been leveled to open the view on the House of the People, while the Mihai Vod\u0103 ChurchPhoto of Mihai Vod\u0103 Church was moved to a new location nestled between concrete blocks of flats. The Saint Spiridon church in 1860. This is the New Saint Spiridon church, which still exists, not the demolished Old Saint Spiridon church. Among other edifices of cultural and/or historical significance torn down in the Uranus area were: the Central Military Museum, the old Arsenal, the Art deco Stadium of the Republic (1926), the Army Theatre, Casa Demetriade, the Operetta Theatre, the Higher Education Institute for Physical Education, the Athletes' Hospital,Photo of the Athletes' Hospital the Lahovary Fountain and the \"Isvor\" open air bath.Cl\u0103diri publice... Among the churches torn down in the Uranus district were included: the Alb\u0103 Post\u0103vari Church (donated in 1568 by a Doamna Caplea), the Spirea Veche Church (founded by a doctor Spiridon Christofi in 1765), the Isvorul T\u0103m\u0103duirii Church (a guilds' foundation of 1794), and the Old Saint Spiridon Church (1668). The demolition of the churches was done with the approval of the Romanian Orthodox Church leaders. For instance, in 1989, Bishop Nifon answered the questions of western reporters by claiming the churches demolished had not much historical interest and they were too close to others.Craig R. Whitney, \"Stalinist Rumania Closes In on Itself\", The New York Times July 15, 1989 Relocating churches and cutting them off from their architectural and cultural context to be reinserted into a narrowing neighbourhood is another expression of the strategy that created \"Ceau\u0219ima\". Some examples of churches that were relocated: the Saint Ilie Rahova Church (1745), the Schitul Maicilor Church (1726), the Domni\u021ba B\u0103la\u0219a Church (founded in 1751 by B\u0103la\u0219a Lambrino, daughter of Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu), the Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan Nou Church (18th century) and the entire outstanding monastic complex of Antim Monastery (1713\u20131715). A similar type of urban intervention cut entire quarters out of their surroundings. Thus, the city area located south of the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba between Podul Isvor and Pia\u021ba Unirii and up to Antim Monastery was hedged in by a large triangle of standardized concrete blocks of flats. ===Pia\u021ba Unirii=== The creation of the huge Boulevard of Socialism's Victory imposed additional demolitions in areas adjacent to the Uranus district. Pia\u021ba Unirii was doubled in size. Excepting the Art nouveau metal structure of the Halele Unirii allegedly built by Gustave Eiffel,Derer the most notable demolition in this area was the Br\u00e2ncovenesc Hospital (A\u0219ez\u0103mintele Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti \u2013 Br\u00e2ncoveanu's Foundations, founded in 1835 by Safta Br\u00e2ncoveanu) \u2013 an architectural monument and one of the most venerable, most ample and best-equipped medical institutions of Bucharest and Romania.Via\u021ba Medical\u0103, 14 (744) anul XVI; Watercolour of A\u0219ez\u0103mintele Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti ===V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti area=== Strada Haiducul Bujor, connecting Calea V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti and Strada Olteni (1959 photograph) Located eastwards of Pia\u021ba Unirii, the V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti area definitely belonged to the old Bucharest. The demolished area was located between Calea C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219ilor on the north, the shore of the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba on the west and south sides, and Mircea Vod\u0103 and Calea V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219tilor streets in the east. The architecture of the area was eclectic, bearing witness to successive cultural and historical strata, which resulted in a mixture of 18th- to 19th-century edifices (inns, stores) and more recent buildings from the early 20th century. Other significant streets of this area were: C\u0103uza\u0219i, Olteni, Iuliu Barasch, Banul M\u0103r\u0103cine, Sf. Ioan Nou, M\u0103mulari, Sf\u00e2nta Vineri, Negru Vod\u0103, Haiducul Bujor, Clucerul Udricani, Pitagora. The total area razed covered approximately 66 hectares. Among the most notable destroyed edifices were: the Sf\u00e2nta Vineri- Herasca Church (founded in 1645), Olteni Church (1696), the historical Vechea Agie (Old Police Prefecture), the Paediatrics Hospital, the Mina Minovici Forensic Institute, the Al. I. Cuza College, the monumental Courthouse of the 4th District, the historical Town Hall of the former Blue Sector, several old inns and stores (underneath a UU-shaped commercial complex dating from the mid-19th century) and other characteristic edifices. Unlike in the Uranus area, a very few buildings could be rescued; these included two synagogues in M\u0103mulari Street, the little Udricani Church and the neighbouring State Jewish Theatre, formerly the Bara\u0219eum Theatre, on Iuliu Barasch Street. ===Dude\u0219ti area=== Dude\u0219ti is situated eastwards of V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti. Before the 1980s, its boundaries ran along Matei Basarab and Labirint streets on the north, Popa Nan and Th. Speran\u021ba streets on the east side, Moruzi Voevod and Papazoglu streets in the south, Olteni and Mircea Vod\u0103 streets on the west side. The central axis of the district ran along the streets Calea Dude\u0219ti and Avraam Goldfaden, with other important streets being Traian, Nerva Traian, Bradului, and Dr. Popper. While the central part of the district has been completely bulldozed to clear the way for the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, its northern and southern sections suffered to a lesser extent. The urban texture of the district was characteristic of housing patterns of the late 19th-early 20th century, consisting of family houses set along old tree-lined streets. Neo- classical ornaments, typical for middle class residences, were more frequent in the northern zone of the neighbourhood, while more modest dwelling structures prevailed in the southern area, where lower middle classes lived. Both the Dude\u0219ti and V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti neighbourhoods were also notable for a traditional and significant Jewish presence.Since Jewish dwelling in Bucharest was not separated or segregated, a compact Jewish quarter did not develop. Nevertheless, up to the early 1960s, a rather large portion of the old city was home for many Bucharest Jews. This area was approximately located along the streets Calea Dude\u0219ti, Goldfaden (named after Abraham Goldfaden) and C\u0103uza\u0219i up to the street Sf. Ioan Nou in the east and Calea C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219ilor, Anton Pann and Dr. Popper in the north. (Ciuciu) The total area razed covered approximately 110 hectares. ===Theodor Speran\u021bia area=== The Theodor Speran\u021bia area was a residential area from the interwar period, mixing middle with lower class dwelling structures. As in the case of Dude\u0219ti, this neighbourhood was only partially erased. The total demolished surface was of approximately 50 hectares. ==Summarizing \"Ceau\u0219ima\"== The areas completely destroyed amounted to some . In fact, the destroyed urban substance was more considerable, if isolated building clusters and town spots are added, such as the partial demolition of \u0218tirbei Vod\u0103 street. Another outstanding example is the destruction of the vast monastic complex of V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti (1722) and of the Pantelimon Monastery (1750). Overall, the bulldozed area was approximately five kilometres long by one kilometre wide.Danta, p.175 It was one of the largest peacetime urban destructions at the hands of humans in recorded history.Iosa, p.121 The bombardments in Bucharest and the 1977 earthquake together caused only 18% of the damage produced by the demolition campaign in the 1980s.Dr\u0103gulin, p.15 Out of the 500 hectares accounted as \"Ceau\u0219ima\", 250 hectares were urban districts of historical significance, representing some 20\u201325% of historic Bucharest. Among other destroyed monuments were 27 Orthodox Christian churches (counting eight relocated churches), six synagogues and Jewish temples, and three Protestant churches.Moraru, p.31-40 ==See also== *Urban planning in communist countries ==Notes== ==References== *Cl\u0103diri publice demolate, 1984-1989 (\"Public Buildings Demolished 1984\u20131989\"), Uniunea Arhitec\u021bilor, Bucharest, 2005, pp. 2\u201315 *Evenimentul Zilei, December 3, 2005 *Edward Behr, Kiss the hand you cannot bite: rise and fall of the Ceau\u0219escus, Villard Books, New York, 1991 *Anca Ciuciu, \"Silent Witnesses.
