    "text": "Pukch'ang concentration camp (Hangeul: , also spelled Bukchang) is a labor camp in North Korea for political prisoners. It is sometimes called T\u016dkchang concentration camp (Hangeul: , also Deukjang or Dukjang). The official name is Kwan-li-so (Penal-labor colony) No. 18. ==Location== The camp is in Pukchang County and Tukchang district, P'y\u014fngan-namdo province in North Korea. It is situated along the middle reaches of Taedong river, which forms the northern boundary of the camp, and also includes the mountains south of the river. On the other side of Taedong river is the Kaechon internment camp (Kwan-li-so No. 14).Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: Satellite Imagery of the North Korean Gulag: Kwan-li-so No. 18 Bukchang Overview, p. 209 ==Description== According to Hwang Jang-yop, the former leader of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, Pukchang camp is the oldest North Korean prison camp and was already erected by 1958.Federation of American Scientists: Hwang Jang-yop speaks Like in Yodok camp there is one section for political prisoners in lifelong detention and another part similar to reeducation camps. Possibly these sections were completely separated earlier and therefore there are the two names Pukchang and Tukchang.\u201dCurious about Dukjang Gulag Where Jeong Ha Cheol Has Been Imprisoned?\u201d, The Daily NK, December 14, 2005 While all the other political prison camps belong to the State Security Department, Pukchang camp is run by the Interior Ministry.The 9th International Conference on North Korea Human Rights and Refugees, Melbourne, March 20, 2009 (page 28) In some cases political prisoners were deported to Kaechon camp, while their relatives (parents, children, siblings, grandchildren) were deported to Pukchang camp. Only based on their kinship they are classified as politically unreliable and are imprisoned without any lawsuit or conviction. The camp is around in area\u201dNorth Koreas Hard Labor Camps\u201c with interactive map, Washington Post, July 20, 2009 and is surrounded by a fence. There are several prison labor colonies with barracks for the prisoners and housing for the guards: the 4th, 5th, and 6th divisions. Family members are often allowed to live together. Around 50,000 prisoners live in Pukchang concentration camp.Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: The Hidden Gulag (Section: Testimony Kwan-li-so No. 18 Bukchang, p. 69 - 70) Kim Yong reported the presence of foreign prisoners, but there is no other source to confirm this.\u201cN Korean officer saw \u2018Westerners\u2019 at prison camp\u201d, ABC News, October 23, 2003 ==Purpose== Pukchang camp isolates politically unreliable persons from society. It was established to exploit the prisoners with hard and dangerous labor. Within the camp borders there are at least five coal mines,Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: Satellite Imagery North Korean Gulag: Kwan-li-so No. 18 Bukchang 4th and 5th Division, p. 219 where all capable prisoners have to work from early in the morning to late in the evening. Furthermore, there is a cement factory and some other factories.Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: Satellite Imagery North Korean Gulag: Kwan-li-so No. 18 Bukchang 4th and 5th Division, p. 220 ==Human rights situation== Kim Hye-sook has described the human rights situation in detail and testified to the Canadian Parliament and to the British Parliament. Rules in Pukchang camp seem to be slightly less strict compared to the human rights situation in other political prison camps. But also in this camp, prisoners are shot in cases of escape attempts, theft of food or violations of instructions. Kim witnessed more than 100 public executions per year with prisoners being tortured and then shot or hanged as a deterrent to the other prisoners. The most common causes of death are malnutrition, work accidents and illnesses. Kim reported that in the 1990s her family only received of corn per month and occasionally some bean paste (Doenjang) or salt. * * In order to survive they had to search for edible plants, leaves and insects. * * She saw many bodies of starved or executed people lying all around the roads and even reported cases of cannibalism. Since the prisoners have to work 16\u201318 hours in the mines every day without any protection, after few years most suffer from pneumoconiosis and many die from it. Kim developed a pulmonary tumor because of the inhaled dust. Work accidents often lead to limb amputations. Many children have frostbite, because they have no shoes and have to go barefoot even in winter. Kim reported that the prisoners have no human rights and are treated at the guards\u2019 mercy. To humiliate the prisoners, the guards would force them to get on their knees, and then spit into the prisoner's mouths and make them swallow the spit. If prisoners do not immediately obey, they are savagely beaten. The prisoners are monitored almost continuously by security agents and are urged to spy on each other and to denounce other prisoners. ==Reported closure and re-opening== According to some sources, the camp ceased operations in 2006. The satellite images however show that the mine inside the camp is still operating with civilian laborers. It is likely that some parts of the camp still hold political prisoners, but most of the former camp area has stopped functioning as a labor camp. In 2016 it was reported that camp 18 had either been re-opened or merged with camp 14 on the other side of the river. Satellite images showed a new security perimeter and increased activity in the area. There also seemed to be an operational ferry between the two camps, giving the suggestion that the camps may have merged. ==Prisoners (Witnesses)== * Kim Yong (1996\u20131998 in Pukchang) was at first imprisoned in Kaechon camp, when his relationship (which he covered up) to his father and brother, who both were executed as alleged US spies, was identified. Later he was relocated to Pukchang after intervention of his former boss.Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: The Hidden Gulag (Section: Testimony Kwan-li-so No. 18 Bukchang, p. 76) * Kim Hye Sook (1975\u20132002 in Pukchang) was imprisoned at the age of 13 years, because her grandfather tried to escape to South Korea.\u201dFreedom from Morbid Concentration Camp \u2013 and then Gloomy Fate\u201d, The Daily NK, April 25, 2011The Independent, \"Kim Hye-sook: 'I saw prisoners turned to honeycomb by the bullets'\", 13 July 2011; retrieved 18 July 2011. ==See also== * Human rights in North Korea * Prisons in North Korea * Kaechon internment camp * Yodok concentration camp ==References== ==External links== * Committee for Human Rights in North Korea: The Hidden Gulag \u2013 Overview on North Korean prison camps with testimonies and satellite photographs * Parliament of Canada, Subcommittee on International Human Rights: Testimony of Ms. Hye Sook Kim \u2013 Testimony of Kim Hye-sook to the Parliament of Canada, February 1, 2011 * Citizens\u2019 Alliance for North Korean Human Rights; Witness Account: Twenty-eight Years of My life in Political Prisoner Camp (Gwalliso) No.18 (Seite 21 - 36) \u2013 Testimony of Kim Hye-sook in the quarterly report of a South Korean human rights organization * Amnesty International: Political Prison Camps in North Korea \u2013 Media briefing based on the testimony of 15 former political prisoners from various North Korean camps * One Free Korea: North Koreas\u2019 Largest Concentration Camps on Google Earth \u2013 Satellite imagery and witness accounts of North Korean political prison and reeducation camps * The Daily NK: The Hub of North Korean News \u2013 News about North Korea and human rights Category:Concentration camps in North Korea Category:1950s establishments in North Korea ",
