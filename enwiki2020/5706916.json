    "text": "Hung Fut () is a southern style of Chinese martial art, first developed in the early 1800s by Lei Jou Fun and widely practiced today. == System == Hung Fut is considered to be a hybrid system. Its philosophies are a mixture of two martial art systems: the powerful, hard style of Hung Gar with the flowing, soft style of Fut Gar (Buddha's palm) forms that develop body coordination. Hung Fut is a combat method that uses economy of movement in order to achieve efficiency. Its strategies are to try to throw the opponent into an awkward position that makes defense difficult and counterattack unlikely. There is no need to keep contact with an opponent, as the system uses interchangeable and flexible movements. The system also includes techniques from Fut Jeung which is thought to be a Shaolin Buddhist method, and ten animal styles (snake, tiger, leopard, lion, eagle, crane, monkey, elephant, horse and dragon) as well as \"8 Drunken Immortal\" forms (based on the personality traits of the 8 heavenly deities of Chinese traditional religion), \"4 Afflictions/Cripples\" forms (a deceptive mimicry of one who is crippled) and a left-handed form (based on the legend of a famous general fighting while holding the infant son of a Chinese emperor). The left-handed form is practiced as a single-handed form, with the right held behind the back, at the waistline. As per oral communication from Grand Master Hung Kam Pui, the single handed form (Duhk Bei Kyuhn) was developed by Hung Jiu Sing for one of his students, who only had one arm. There is also a sword form that is practiced in the same fashion. This is the style that Donnie Yen used in his movie, Dragon, after learning it from Hung Kam Pui. There are somewhat different lineages and succession stories listed by various Hung Fut schools around the world. The stories of the masters vary also from account to account. As the style has moved around the world, the content of the system\u2014number and names of forms, types of power used, stances, techniques, theory, and training methods\u2014has also changed, leading to a large variation from school to school. 8th generation grandmaster, Tai Yim, the adopted son of Hung Yu Chung, the 7th generation grandmaster, immigrated from China to the United States in 1977. He traveled to the United States to fulfill the wish of Hung Yu Chung to spread Hung Fut to the west. He opened his first United States side school in Wheaton Maryland in 1978 and now teaches in Kensington, Maryland, a suburb outside of Washington D.C.http://www.taiyimkungfu.com Tai Yim Kung Fu The 9th Generation Masters, inducted by 8th generation Grandmaster Tai Yim include: Master Linh Thai, Master Eugene Chung, Master John Miller, Master Mike Sutton, Master Vicky Miller, Master Shelton Lee Jr, Master Ricardo Chen, and Master Jae Ha Hwang.

Its roots go back to the Shaolin temple. Hung Fut is a modified fighting form that has brought together the combined knowledge of many kung fu masters and styles. All Hung Fut forms start with the left side of the body. The Hung Fut system includes more than twenty weapons, the best known of which is the left- handed staff style. There are traditionally ten different staff forms taught; each successive one increases in difficulty and intensity. The staff is the first weapon taught in the system and also the last. The final staff form is the most famous and mysterious. Most commonly known as the \"mad devil staff\" it was traditionally passed down only to the one or few select students appointed to succeed a teacher. This form was used by the sixth generation Grandmaster, Hung Jiu Sing, also known as the \"White Haired Devil\", and there are several students known to have received his transmittion of this. ==References== *Hung Kam Pui in Hong Kong *NYC Hung Fut Pai Branch *Hoo Chang Hung Fut Gung Fu Association in Brasil *Shaolin Hung Fut Kung Fu Philippines */ Wong Sheung Kung Fu Club in Victoria BC Canada http://www.paisleykungfu.com/Links.html http://www.uskungfu.com http://www.donniamstudio.com ==External links== * Hung Fut History * More Hung Fut History * Hung Fut Videos Category:Chinese martial arts Category:Buddhist martial arts ",
