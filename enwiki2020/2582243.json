    "text": "Underberg is a digestif bitter produced at Rheinberg in Germany by Underberg AG, made from aromatic herbs from 43 countries, which undergo inspections and are based on a secret Underberg family recipe whose members are personally responsible for the production of the drink. Underberg is one of the most widespread kr\u00e4uterlik\u00f6rs on the market. Underberg contains 1.3 percent herbal extract by weight, which includes aromatic, digestion-stimulating, relaxing and calming active substances, and naturally occurring vitamin B1. The drink matures in Slovenian oak barrels for several months to enhance the flavour. Underberg is classified under \"food and drinks: oils, herbs and spices\" in the United States and can be sold without any sort of liquor license. ==History== It is based on a secret and proprietary recipe, guarded by the Underberg family since the company was founded by Hubert Underberg-Albrecht in 1846. The herbs are distilled using a process called semper idem (or \"always the same\"). The extracts are then matured for months in barrels made of Slovenian oak. Production ceased in 1939 due to lack of raw materials and was restarted in December 1949. The drink is usually associated with its portion-sized 20 ml bottle, designed in 1949 by Emil Underberg, grandson of the founder. The mini- bottle is protected by a straw paper sleeve, and the embossed Underberg label is glued on. All of its elements, including shape of the bottle, colour, packaging and the Underberg name are trademarked and copyrighted. Notable fans of Underberg in the modern era include MF DOOM, Amon Amarth and Chumlee. To promote the brand, the Underberg company rewards branded merchandise to its users after collecting a certain number of bottlecaps. ==Gallery== File:Underberg.jpg|The 20 ml bottle, wrapped in paper File:Underberg 12x20ml.jpg|A metal case containing 12 little bottles of Underberg \u2013 2007 Edition (Theme: Greece) File:Brasilberg.jpg|Big Brasilberg bottle, a variety of Underberg sold in Brazil File:Underberg_4804613947_42da6d6764_t.jpg|Box with the mini bottles ==See also== *Becherovka *Kr\u00e4uterlik\u00f6r *Unicum ==References== ==External links== * Category:German distilled drinks Category:Bitters Category:Herbal liqueurs Category:German brands Category:Purveyors to the Imperial and Royal Court Category:Companies based in North Rhine-Westphalia ",
