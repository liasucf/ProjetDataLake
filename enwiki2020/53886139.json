(in Japanese) Hua Sheng Trading Inc. (Archived) Retrieved 26 April 2017. ==History== The trains were manufactured in 1990 to replace aging KiHa 8000 series diesel railcars that entered service in 1965, in light of newer diesel railcars being manufactured by various companies.Railway Journal (issue 294) April 1991 edition, pages 116\u2013119 Five cars were manufactured by Nippon Sharyo in 1991 based on the KiHa 85 series built by the same company and used by JR Central, and entered service the same year, replacing all remaining KiHa 8000 series diesel railcars on Northern Alps services. When they were in service with Meitetsu, they were used on the Northern Alps and Hida services. However, in 2000, a high-speed bus service connecting Nagoya Station and Takayama Station was introduced. With the introduction of the bus service, the ridership of the Northern Alps service was halved, and Meitetsu saw that there was no point keeping the five cars due to inefficiency when compared with the bus service. Due to this, all five cars were retired from service on 30 September 2001, the same day when the Northern Alps service was abolished.Railway Journal (issue 422) December 2001 edition, page 90 All five cars were later sold to the Aizu Railway that same year, and began operations on the Aizu Railway on 23 March 2002.Railway Journal (issue 423) January 2002 edition, page 107 As the KiHa 8500 series were designed for high-speed operation, problems with the KiHa 8500 series started to surface when in service on the Aizu Railway, which resulted in deterioration of parts due to the frequent station stops the cars had to make.Railway Journal (issue 526) August 2010 edition, page 142 As such, the cars were retired on 30 May 2010 and replaced by newer AT-700 series railcars the same day.Railway Journal (issue 526) August 2010 edition, page 143 The cars were actually supposed to make a special final run on 26 and 27 March 2011 as part of an event, but said event was cancelled due to the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. ==Overseas operations== Cars 8502 and 8503 were shipped to Sabah State Railway in mid-August 2015. Both cars were repainted and refurbished from February to March 2016. 8502 entered service on 27 October 2016 and is used on Sabah State Railway's Kelas Pertama (\"first class\" in Malay) services. 8503 is slated to begin operation in fiscal 2017. ==Preserved examples== Cars 8501 and 8504 are preserved in operational condition by Nakagawa Seiryu Tetsudo Hozonkai in Nasukarasuyama. ==Individual cars== The 5 individual cars that were built are as follows: ===KiHa 8501=== This car was facing the Toyohashi end and is equipped with a toilet and washroom. This car has been preserved. ===KiHa 8502=== This car was facing the Takayama end and is equipped with a toilet and washroom. This car is in service with the Sabah State Railway. ===KiHa 8503=== This car is practically identical to car 8501, but is only inserted into a trainset when required. This car is in service with the Sabah State Railway. ===KiHa 8504=== This car was an additional car meant to face the Takayama end, and is equipped with vending machines and a public telephone. Like car 8503, it is only inserted into a trainset when required. This car has been preserved. ===KiHa 8555=== This was an intermediate car equipped with vending machines and a public telephone. This car has been scrapped as of 31 March 2007.Railway Journal (issue 493) November 2007 edition, page 136 ==See also== * ==Notes== This article incorporates information from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia. ==References== Category:Diesel multiple units of Japan KiHa 8500 series Category:Nippon Sharyo rolling stock Category:Train-related introductions in 1991 ",
