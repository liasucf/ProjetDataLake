    "text": "The 1978 North American Soccer League playoffs began on August 8 and ended on August 27 with Soccer Bowl '78 at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 16 out of 24 teams qualified after a 30-match regular season, eight from each conference. ==Playoff format== The top two teams in each division would quality for the playoffs. The other spots would go to the next best two teams in the conference, regardless of division. The top three seeds went to the division winners, seeds 4-6 went to the second place teams and the last two seeds were known as 'wild-cards', a nod to the NFL's playoff format. The winners of each successive round would be reseeded within the conference by point total. The first round and the Soccer Bowl were single games, while the conference semifinals and championships were two-game series. As in the 1977 playoffs, if both teams were tied at one win apiece at the conclusion of Game 2, there would be a 30-minute sudden-death mini-game and a shootout if necessary. ==Playoff seeds== ===American Conference=== #Detroit Express \u2013 Central Division champions, 176 points #New England Tea Men \u2013 Eastern Division champions, 165 points #San Diego Sockers \u2013 Western Division champions, 164 points #Tampa Bay Rowdies \u2013 165 points #Chicago Sting \u2013 123 points #California Surf \u2013 115 points #Fort Lauderdale Strikers \u2013 143 points #Philadelphia Fury \u2013 111 points ===National Conference=== #Cosmos \u2013 Eastern Division champions, 212 points #Vancouver Whitecaps \u2013 Western Division champions, 199 points #Minnesota Kicks \u2013 Central Division champions, 156 points #Portland Timbers \u2013 167 points #Washington Diplomats \u2013 145 points #Tulsa Roughnecks \u2013 132 points #Toronto Metros-Croatia \u2013 144 points #Seattle Sounders \u2013 138 points ==Bracket== ==Conference Quarterfinals== ===American Conference=== ====(1) Detroit Express vs. (8) Philadelphia Fury==== ====(2) New England Tea Men vs. (7) Fort Lauderdale Strikers==== ====(3) San Diego Sockers vs. (6) California Surf==== ====(4) Tampa Bay Rowdies vs. (5) Chicago Sting==== ===National Conference=== ====(1) Cosmos vs. (8) Seattle Sounders==== ====(2) Vancouver Whitecaps vs. (7) Toronto Metros-Croatia==== ====(3) Minnesota Kicks vs. (6) Tulsa Roughnecks==== ====(4) Portland Timbers vs. (5) Washington Diplomats==== ==Conference Semifinals== ===American Conference=== ====(1) Detroit Express vs. (7) Ft.
