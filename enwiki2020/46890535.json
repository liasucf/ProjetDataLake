    "text": "Uromycladium is a genus of rust fungi in the family Pileolariaceae. It was circumscribed by mycologist Daniel McAlpine in 1905.McAlpine, D. 1905. A new genus of Uredineae \u2014 Uromycladium. Ann Mycol 3(4):303\u2013322 The genus was established by McAlpine for rusts on Acacia (Fabaceae, subfamily Mimosoideae) with teliospores that clustered at the top of a pedicel.Doungsa-ard, C., McTaggart, A.R., Geering, A.D.W., Dalisay, T.U., Ray, J. Shivas, R.G. 2015. Uromycladium falcatarium sp. nov., the cause of gall rust on Paraserianthes falcataria in south-east Asia. Australasian Plant Pathol. 44: 25\u201330. DOI 10.1007/s13313-014-0301-z The genus contains at least 11 species. Some of these species infect plants in the family Mimosoideae including Acacia, Paraserianthes and Falcataria. Most species are considered to be specific to only one host species of plant, such as Uromycladium simplex on Acacia pycnanthaMcAlpine, Daniel (1906). The rusts of Australia their structure, nature and classification. Department of Agriculture (Victoria). pp. 110\u201312. and Uromycladium falcatarium on Falcataria moluccana. Uromycladium tepperianum, on the other hand, has almost 100 known hosts including plants from several tribes of Mimosoideae.Uromycladium tepperianum on Acacia spp.\".

However, research suggests that this species may comprise several unrecognized taxa with narrower host ranges.Morris MJ (1987) Biology of the Acacia gall rust, Uromycladium tepperianum.

Introduced to South Africa. ==Ecology== The rust fungi in the genus Uromycladium typically form enlarged galls at the end of actively growing plant tissues. These galls can be a significant disease limiting the growth and survival of trees planted for commercial tree plantations and agroforestry.Lestari, P., Rahayu, S., & Widiyatno. 2013. Dynamics of gall rust disease on sengon (Falcataria moluccana) in various agroforestry patterns. Procedia Environmental Sciences 17: 167\u2013171 The acacia gall rust fungus species Uromycladium tepperianum has been introduced to South Africa as a biological control on the invasive Australian shrub Acacia saligna.Judith H. Myers, Dawn Bazely (2003). Ecology and Control of Introduced Plants. Cambridge University Press. . The galls of Uromycladium tepperianum have been reported to be used by moths in the families Gracillariidae, Tortricidae, Tineidae, Pyralidae, and Stathmopodidae as food sources and domatium for their larvae in Australia.New, T. R. 1982. Lepidoptera from Uromycladium galls on Acacia. Australian Journal of Zoology 30(2): 357\u2013364. Specifically in the family Gracillariidae the species Polysoma eumetalla and Conopomorpha heliopla are found feeding on the surface of various species of acacia rust galls. Erechthias mystacinella and Opogona comptella moth larvae from the family Tineidae have been reported to live and feed on the inside of Uromycladium tepperianum galls. ==References== ==External links== *Uromycladium on Encyclopedia of Life Category:Basidiomycota genera Category:Pucciniales ",
