    "text": "The Tobago Council of the People's National Movement (PNM), more popularly known as the Tobago Council of the PNM or PNM Tobago Council is the longest- serving and oldest active political party in Tobago. The party is the autonomous branch of the Trinidad and Tobago People's National Movement operating in Tobago. While its political leader acts in the local capacity, they also serve as a deputy leader on a national level. The party's executives organize for both local and national election campaigns. There have been three PNM Chief Secretaries and administrations. Founded in 1998, it is the largest and most successful political party in modern Tobagonian politics. With the exception of 2010, the party has won the biggest share of the vote at the Trinidad and Tobago general elections since 2000 and has governed the Tobago House of Assembly uninterruptedly, winning every Tobago House of Assembly election, since 2001. The Tobago PNM currently hold 2 of 2 Tobagonian seats in the Trinidad and Tobago Parliament and 10 of 12 seats in the Tobago House of Assembly. Councillor and Secretary of Health, Wellness and Family Development as well as the former Trinidad and Tobago Ambassador to Costa Rica and Deputy Chief Secretary Tracy Davidson-Celestine, is the current and first female political leader of the Tobago PNM after being elected in the 2020 People's National Movement Tobago leadership election. With its predecessor organizations and despite not being a socialist party, it was a member of the democratic socialist West Indies Federal Labour Party in the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation from 1957 to 1962, winning the Tobago seat in the 1958 elections. As of January 2020, the party has 10,000 registered members.
