    "text": "Dung Beetles is an Apple II maze game by Bob Bishop published in 1982 by Datasoft. The gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, but a portion of the maze around the player-controlled character is enlarged as if being viewed through a square magnifying lens. Dung Beetles was ported to Atari 8-bit family and the TRS-80 Color Computer. The Color Computer version was sold by Tandy and renamed Mega-Bug. The Mega Bug port was programmed by Steve Bjork. Later versions for both the Apple II and Atari were named Tumble Bugs. The Atari version was re-released in 1983 by Gentry Software with another name change: Magneto Bugs. In Australia, the game was re-branded Bug Attack. It was also released for the NEC PC-6001. ==Gameplay== The game concept and gameplay are based on Pac-Man, but features a much larger maze and a moving \"magnifying rectangle\" which makes it easier to see graphic detail of the main character and the opponents, but also obscures a small area of the map near the main character, making short- to medium-range navigation more difficult. In addition, whenever the main character passes through a part of the maze, it leaves a trail of dung. When a dung beetle finds this dung, it eats it and follows the trail; however, if the trail branches, or it encounters a point along the trail, it picks at random which branch to follow, thereby giving the player anywhere from a 50% to 66\u2154% chance of losing the pursuer. The player can backtrack over his own trail (often necessary as the map can contain dead ends) creating false leads for his pursuers. Whenever the player is caught, the game plays a digitized voice saying, \"We Gotcha!\" This is the only use of voice in the game. ==Reception== Softline called Tumblebugs magnifying glass \"an impressive programming feat,\" and concluded that it was \"a solid game ... It could stand some more variety, but it certainly does not lack challenge\". ==References== Category:1982 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Maze games Category:NEC PC-6001 games Category:Pac-Man clones Category:TRS-80 Color Computer games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Single-player video games ",
