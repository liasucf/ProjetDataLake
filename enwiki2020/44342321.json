    "text": "Sea Stories was a British television series which aired 1936 to 1937 on the BBC. It was one of the earliest series ever aired on television. It consisted of A.B. Campbell describing the personalities and places he had seen.http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctv/1936-12-14#at-15.35 The programs preceding and following it varied, for example one episode was preceded by Theatre Parade and followed by The World of Women, while another episode was preceded a mix of short variety segments and followed by Sophisticated Cabaret. None of the episodes still exist, as methods to record live television did not exist until late 1947, and were used very rarely by the BBC until the mid-1950s. ==References== ==External links== *Sea Stories on IMDb Category:1930s British television series Category:1936 British television series debuts Category:1937 British television series endings Category:Lost BBC episodes Category:BBC Television shows Category:British live television series Category:Black-and-white British television shows ",
