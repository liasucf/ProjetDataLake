    "text": "Pij, jedi, veseli se... (trans. Eat, Drink, Be Happy...) is the fifth and the last studio album by Serbian and former Yugoslav hard rock band Griva, released in 1992. Due to the situation in the Yugoslavia (which formally dissolved the same year the album was released) and the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars, the album was recorded for more than eighteen months, and, until the end of the recording, vocalist Zlatko Karavla was the only remaining Griva member of the members that started the recording (the album cover features only Karavla's image). Nevertheless, he decided to release the album under the Griva moniker for the independent record label Megaton. After the album release the band (although not actually existing during the album recording) officially disbanded. ==Track listing== All songs were written by Zlatko Karavla. #\"Da li zna\u0161 ovu pesmu?\" - 2:32 #\"Sre\u0107an ti ro\u0111endan\" - 3:20 #\"Kad do\u0111e jutro\" - 4:10 #\"Poljubi me malo ni\u017ee\" - 2:42 #\"Kaljinka\" - 3:10 #\"Saznala bi kad bi htela\" - 4:40 #\"Do\u0111i sebi dok jo\u0161 ima\u0161 kome\" - 2:40 #\"Samo nebo da ne padne\" - 2:52 #\"Pij, jedi, veseli se...\" - 2:46 ==Personnel== *Zlatko Karavla - vocals, producer *Miroslav Maleti\u0107 - guitar, drums *Mom\u010dilo Bajac - guitar, bass guitar, acoustic guitar *Sini\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107 - bass guitar, keyboards *Zoran Mrakovi\u0107 - guitar (solo on \"Poljubi me malo ni\u017ee\") *Bane Mici\u0107 - keyboards, bass guitar (on \"Do\u0111i sebi dok jo\u0161 ima\u0161 kome\") *Jan \u0160a\u0161 - mixed by *Rajko Ignjati\u0107 - mixed by *Ljubomir Peji\u0107 - recorded by *Sa\u0161a Pavlovi\u0107 - recorded by *\u017dana - backing vocals == References == ;Notes ;Sources *Pij, jedi, veseli se... at Discogs * EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960-2006, Janjatovi\u0107 Petar; == External links == *Pij, jedi, veseli se... at Discogs Category:Griva albums Category:1988 albums ",
