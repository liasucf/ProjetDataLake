    "text": "Creativerse is a free-to-play sandbox survival game developed by Playful Corp. for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Inspired by Minecraft, it takes place in a procedurally generated world of blocks where players interact with flora and fauna, craft items, and build constructions. It was released as an early access title on Steam in August 2014, and was officially released in May 2017. == Gameplay == Creativerse puts players in possession of a futuristic gauntlet that allows the manipulation of matter. After customizing the appearance of their character, players are released into a procedurally generated world. Tooltips provide players with the knowledge of gameplay basics and give direction as they set out to explore the world. Players can create or participate in public worlds, stake claims to protect their creations, and tailor their own world via the use of in-game admin tools. Progression in Creativerse is achieved through the expanding recipe system. Players collect and refine unique resources from the world's various biomes and layers, and then utilize those resources to craft weapons, tools, items, and building materials. As players progress in crafting, they unlock more advanced recipes which include mining cells, extractors, and stations. Mining cells upgrade the player's gauntlet and enable them to gather materials from the deeper layers of the world. Extractors are used to gather precious resources like iron and coal, and stations break resources down for different uses. Some rare recipes can only be found through combat or exploration, while others only drop during seasonal events. While the game is free, premium costumes, recipe bundles, and a \"Creativerse Pro\" option are available to players through the in-game store. Creativerse Pro provides players with 20 extra inventory slots, the ability to create as many worlds as they like, and other perks like a flashlight and glider. == Development == Creativerse started as a pay-to-play title, but moved to a free-to-play business model upon entering Steam Early Access on August 13, 2014. It continues to receive regular free updates that improve or add to the core gameplay and features. Updated and fully customizable character models were added on May 2016. The following January, the Machines Evolved Update introduced linkable, logic-based machines that gave players the ability to add interactive experiences to their builds. Players were then given the ability to share those builds and experiences publicly in the form of Adventures, which debuted on February 22, 2017. That summer, the Blueprint Revolution Update brought Steam Workshop integration into the mix and empowered players to capture and share their creations for use in one another\u2019s worlds. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 video games Category:Early access video games Category:MacOS games Category:Minecraft clones Category:Survival video games Category:Open world video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Windows games Category:Steam Workshop games ",
