    "text": "McAllen International Airport is two miles south of McAllen, in Hidalgo County, Texas, United States. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017\u20132021 categorized it as a small hub primary commercial service airport. ==Runways== McAllen International Airport covers 370 acres (150 ha) at an elevation of 107 feet (33 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 7,120 by 150 feet (2,170 x 46 m) and 18/36 is 2,639 by 60 feet (804 x 18 m). In November 2015 runway 13/31 was redesignated 14/32 and an EMAS, engineered materials arrestor system, was installed at the runway 14 approach end. In the updated 20-year Master Plan for MFE runway 14/32 will be extended to 10,000 ft and a parallel runway will be added. An expanded cargo apron will be on the south side of the airport. Runway 14/32 is the primary runway, used by all the airlines and most of the business flights. 3,000 feet will likely be added to Runway 14/32 to allow larger aircraft (Moultan, 2012). Runway 18/36 does not intersect Runway 14/32 so controllers can use both runways if needed. The departure end of Runway 18 is about 1/3 of the way down Runway 14/32, so traffic on final for Runway 36 must be cautious of traffic using Runway 14/32. Class D airports are airports that are less congested but they still have a control tower. This Class D airport has a simple layout and taxiways extend the full length of each runway (Foreflight, 2012). Both runways are asphalt and are in \u201cGood Condition\u201d (Foreflight, 2012). The terminal is easy for all traffic to reach from either runway, but aircraft on runway 14/32 have to cross runway 18/36 to reach the Fixed-Base Operator (FBO). The runways form a V. The terminal, tower, cargo facility, border patrol, and the U.S. Customs apron are all centrally located on the field, easy to access from either runway (Foreflight, 2012). On the west side of Runway 18/36, there are multiple hangars, the fixed based operator, and the fire station (Foreflight, 2012). In case of an accident on Runway 14/32, fire and rescue personnel would have to cross Runway 18/36, one possible issue of the layout at MFE. ==Facilities== The airport has one terminal with six gates. In early 2006, Gate 5 opened on the main concourse due to the arrival of Delta Connection. In 2008 a terminal capacity study assessed the future needs of the airport and possible terminal expansion to include eight gates, larger ticketing/office area, TSA security area queue. Paid parking at the airport began on November 15, 2007 with the economy, long-term and short-term lots. A revised terminal expansion project with one additional gate, larger passenger waiting areas, expansion of the TSA screening areas, and other facility modifications began in March 2012. In the year ending October 31, 2018 the airport had 56,613 aircraft operations, an average 155 per day: 62% general aviation, 17% military, 15% commercial airline and 6% air taxi. In December 2019, 105 aircraft were based at this airport: 49 single-engine, 21 multi-engine, 17 jet, 11 helicopter and 7 military. ==Expansion== Waiting area at the main terminal In March 2012 the airport underwent expansion, completed in 2014. Funding was combined from grants from the FAA and the TSA. The following are planned: *Addition of 52,000 square feet *Adding space for new explosives screening unit, bringing the total to three *Expanding the terminal and adding space for another gate *Adding space for the Transportation Security Administration *Sterilizer and steam generator (required for some international flights) *Replacement of HVAC central plant equipment \"The project includes construction of a one-story building addition of about 7,400 square feet at the west end of the terminal building for a checked baggage screening facility and expanded outbound baggage handling system; renovation of about 11,200 square feet at the east end of the terminal building for public lobby improvements, expanded passenger security screening checkpoint, tenant office improvements, and concessions. It includes a two-story addition of about 33,000 square feet at the south end of the terminal building for aircraft boarding gates with passenger boarding bridges, passenger holdrooms, public lobbies, restrooms, concessions, airline operations, and mechanical and electrical equipment rooms; renovation of about 5,000 square feet at the south end of the terminal building for aircraft boarding gate and passenger holdroom improvements. It includes the replacement of HVAC central plant equipment and refurbishment of five existing passenger boarding bridges. Work includes replacement of portions of the aircraft apron as required for building construction, underground utilities work, and apron drainage, and pavement marking and striping for aircraft positions and service vehicle lanes.http://www.mcallen.net/files/docs/bids/08-11-C30-190/BN%20MMIAP%20Terminal%20Expansion- revised.pdf ==Airlines and destinations== The following airlines operate scheduled passenger service from the airport: American Airlines and United Airlines summer 2015 timetables show main line jets to McAllen while their codesharing partners, American Eagle (Mesa Airlines) and United Express (Mesa Airlines), flew regional jets.http://www.aa.com, July 8, 2015 American Airlines timetablehttp://united.com, July 11, 2015 United Airlines timetable American operates Airbus A319s and McDonnell Douglas MD-80s while American Eagle flies Bombardier CRJ-900s.

Bush is greeted at MFE by U.S. Army Lt. Gen. H Steven Blum and Texas Governor Rick Perry on August 3, 2006. Bush was visiting troops participating in Operation Jump Start. MFE is the busiest airline airport in the Rio Grande Valley. The airport is also served by two of the three global alliances, Star Alliance and Oneworld. MFE lost its only international flight in September 2007 \u2013 a daily Continental Express flight to Mexico City although Mexican air carrier Aeromar currently operates nonstop service from the airport to the capital of Mexico. After less than one year it was announced that MFE would lose its only non-stop flight to Los Angeles (LAX), operated by Delta Connection partner ExpressJet Airlines, at the end of 2007; however, Allegiant Air currently flies a seasonal nonstop McAllen to LAX with several flights a week. In December 2007 it was announced that Delta Connection would pull out of McAllen on January 6, 2008, ending its two flights a day from MFE to Atlanta, operated by Delta Connection partner Atlantic Southeast Airlines. In March 2009 Delta, through its wholly owned subsidiary Northwest Airlines, began flying MFE to Memphis on Northwest Airlink partner Pinnacle Airlines. Northwest Airlines had previously flown MFE to its Memphis hub starting in 2004. Following the completion of the merger of Northwest into Delta in 2010, the Memphis hub was eventually shut down although Delta continues to serve MEM. On September 7, 2010 Delta Connection partner Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) resumed service to MFE essentially taking over the non-stop MFE\u2013MEM route from Pinnacle Airlines. On May 1, 2011, Delta Connection partner ASA began non-stop service from MFE to ATL and ended service from MFE to MEM (flights from MFE to ATL were then operated by ExpressJet following the merger of this regional airline with Atlantic Southeast). This route was discontinued on May 1, 2012. On May 24, 2009 Allegiant Air began bi-weekly, non-stop service to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), in addition to non-stop service to Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) twice a week, and non- stop service to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS) five times a week. On August 15, 2009, Allegiant announced that it would end service from MFE to LAX; Allegiant later reinstated service and flies non-stop to LAX seasonally. ==Past service== Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) and successor Texas International Airlines (TI) served the airport for over 32 years and was the only air carrier to do so for many years.
