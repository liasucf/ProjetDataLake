    "text": "Bonafide is the debut album by Jon B.. It was released on May 23, 1995 on the Epic Records subsidiary 550 Music. The album was the first recording released on Tracey Edmonds' record label Yab Yum Records, which 550 Music distributed. It includes the Grammy-nominated first single \"Someone to Love\" featuring Babyface. The song was originally featured on the soundtrack to the 1995 Will Smith and Martin Lawrence action-comedy Bad Boys. Also included is the second single \"Pretty Girl\" and the final single \"Isn't It Scary\". Bonafide was a favorite of rapper Tupac Shakur. The two met each other by way of a mutual friend on the set of Shakur's video \"How Do U Want It\", which prompted them to work together. The end result was the collaboration \"Are U Still Down\", which appeared on Jon's following album Cool Relax. The album was certified Platinum. ==Track listing== All songs written by Jonathan Buck, except where noted.Jon B. \u2013 Bonafide (CD liner notes). Yab Yum Records/550 Music.
