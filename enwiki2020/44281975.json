Pais was the only candidate for president, and was elected unopposed, whilst the PNR won 108 of the 155 seats in the House of Representatives and 32 of the 73 Senate seats. However, the elections were boycotted by the Democratic Party, the Evolutionist Party and the Republican Union, which had won all but 16 of the seats in the 1915 elections.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St\u00f6ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, pp1557\u20131558 After Pais was assassinated later in December 1918, the party went into decline, and merged with the Republican Liberal Party and the Reconstitution Party to form the Nationalist Republican Party in 1923. ==References== Category:Defunct political parties in Portugal Category:Political parties established in 1918 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1923 Category:1918 establishments in Portugal Category:1923 disestablishments in Portugal ",
