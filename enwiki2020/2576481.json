    "text": "Setting Free the Bears is the first novel by American author John Irving, published in 1968 by Random House. Irving studied at the Institute of European Studies in Vienna in 1963, and Bears was written between 1965 and 1967 based largely on Irving's understanding of the city and its rebellious youth of the 1960s. The original manuscript for the book was submitted as his Masters thesis at the University of Iowa's Writer's Workshop in 1967, and was later expanded and revised to its published version. ==Plot summary== The book's central plot concerns a plan to liberate all the animals from the Vienna Zoo, as happened just after the conclusion of World War II. Irving's two protagonists\u2014Graff, a young Austrian college student, and Siggy, an eccentric motorcycle mechanic-cum-philosopher\u2014meet and embark on an adventure-filled motorcycle tour of Austria before the novel's climax: \"the great zoo bust\". Towards the middle of the book the two protagonists go their separate ways and a large section of the novel is given over to \"The Notebook\"\u2014a chronicle of the Siggy character's family from pre-World War II, through the occupation of the Soviets, to the late 1960s. Siggy is killed in a motorcycle accident, the grief-stricken Graff then continues with their plan to free the inhabitants of the Vienna Zoo with Siggy's voice echoing in his head. This ends in catastrophic results. ==References== Category:1968 American novels Category:Novels by John Irving Category:Novels set in Austria Category:Novels set in zoos Category:Random House books Category:1968 debut novels ",
