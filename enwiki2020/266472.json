He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1989 to 1994, and as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1969 to 1989. == Early life == He was born in Cork in 1935, and was educated at Col\u00e1iste Chr\u00edost R\u00ed, the School of Commerce and University College Cork. He became a trade union official with the ITGWU (which would later merge with other trade unions, becoming SIPTU) and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Con was the President of the IT&GWU; in Cork. His father Cornelius (Con) was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1965\u201366 and was active in the labour movement. == Political career == Desmond first entered D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1969 general election, when he was elected as a Labour Party TD for D\u00fan Laoghaire and Rathdown. He retained his seat there in 1973 and was then elected in 1977 at D\u00fan Laoghaire, where he won a seat at every election until his retirement from the D\u00e1il in 1989. From 1981 to 1982 he served as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, under Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach. In 1982, after Michael O'Leary's resignation as Labour Party leader, Dick Spring was elected as the party's new leader and Desmond was chosen as his deputy. Fine Gael and the Labour Party together gained a majority in the November 1982 general election. In the second FitzGerald administration, Desmond was appointed Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health. FitzGerald began a major cabinet reshuffle in February 1986, with the intention to appoint him as Minister for Justice; Desmond refused, and Spring supported him in that attitude. The outcome was that he remained as Minister for Health while Gemma Hussey took on the Social Welfare portfolio.Kenny, Shane and Keane, Fergal, Irish Politics Now: 'This Week' Guide to the 25th D\u00e1il, Dingle, Co.
