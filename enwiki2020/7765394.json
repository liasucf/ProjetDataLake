Embudo translates to \"funnel\" in English; the street is shaped like a funnel. It is one of the most colourful streets in the historic La Candelaria district and leads to the Plaza del Chorro de Quevedo. Many walls on Calle del Embudo are painted with street art or graffiti, in the bright colours of Colombia. Some of them depict legends from the pre-Columbian era. * Plaza del Chorro de Quevedo - It is believed that the Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada established the capital city of Bogot\u00e1 on this square on August 6, 1538. The square takes its name from an Augustinian priest, Friar Quevedo, who in 1832 purchased the site and set up the public water fountain in the centre. Its water supply was cut off when a nearby building collapsed in 1896. It is also believed that it was from this site that the zipa, the main cacique of the Muisca, viewed the Bogot\u00e1 savanna. Today, with all the buildings that surround the square, no such view is available. Street of La Candelaria.
