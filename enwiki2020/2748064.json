Williams receives 282 of a possible 302 votes. ===February=== *February 28 \u2013 Seeking an unprecedented three-year $1.05 million to be divided evenly, the Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale begin a joint holdout. ===March=== *March 5 \u2013 In what will prove to be one of the more influential off-the-field events in Major League history, United Steelworkers union official Marvin Miller is elected the Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). Under Miller's guidance, the players' union will make major gains such as salary increases, improvements in pension benefits, and the advent of free agency and salary arbitration. Miller will occupy his position from 1966 to 1982, as the players' union was transformed into one of the strongest unions in the United States. *March 8 \u2013 The Special Veterans Committee waives Hall of Fame election rules and inducts Casey Stengel, recently retired manager of the New York Mets. *March 17 \u2013 Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale escalate their threat of retirement by signing movie contracts. On March 30, they will end their 32-day holdout, signing for $130,000 and $105,000 respectively. ===April=== *April 3 \u2013 USC pitcher Tom Seaver signs with the New York Mets. He had been drafted by the Braves, but they had signed him to a minor league contract while he was still in college. This voided Seaver's remaining eligibility, and voided the contract. The Mets won a special lottery over Cleveland and Philadelphia to win the right to sign him. *April 11 \u2013 Emmett Ashford takes the field to officiate a 5\u20132 Washington Senators win over the Cleveland Indians at Washington, to become officially the first African-American umpire in Major League history. *April 12 \u2013 Over 50,000 fans show up at Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium to watch the Braves first home game in Atlanta. The Braves fall to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 13 innings, 3\u20132. *April 19 - The California Angels play their first regular-season game in their new ballpark, Anaheim Stadium, in front of 31,660 fans.

The Angels' Rick Reichardt scores the first run, with a 1-out solo home run in the bottom of the 2nd inning. ===May=== *May 7 \u2013 One day after the New York Yankees' record falls to 4\u201316, general manager Ralph Houk fires Johnny Keane as manager and returns to manage the team himself. Dan Topping, Jr. replaces Houk as general manager. Houk had managed the Yankees to three consecutive American League pennants from 1961 to 1963 and a World Series title during the first two of those years, but his second stint will have a far less than successful beginning. Their talent and farm system both depleted, the Yankees, after finishing in sixth place in , will finish dead last\u2014their first time doing so since . *May 8 **The San Francisco Giants trade first baseman/outfielder Orlando Cepeda to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher Ray Sadecki. Cepeda will go on to win the National League Most Valuable Player award in on the Cardinals' World Championship team. That same day, the Giants defeat the Cardinals 10\u20135 in the final game at the old Busch Stadium. **Frank Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles hits what will be the only home run hit out of Memorial Stadium. The shot comes against Luis Tiant in the first inning of the Orioles' 8-3 victory in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians. *May 12 \u2013 With 46,048 spectators in attendance for the first game at the new Busch Memorial Stadium, the St. Louis Cardinals defeat the Atlanta Braves in 12 innings, 4\u20133, behind a single RBI by Lou Brock. Braves outfielder Felipe Alou delivers a pair of home runs. *May 14 \u2013 The San Francisco Giants' Willie Mays hits his then National League record 512th home run \u2013 topping another Giant, Mel Ott. San Francisco beats the Los Angeles Dodgers, 6\u20131, at Candlestick Park. ===June=== *June 7 \u2013 The Kansas City Athletics use the second overall pick to draft Arizona State outfielder Reggie Jackson. *June 9 \u2013 At Metropolitan Stadium, the Minnesota Twins rock the Kansas City Athletics, 9\u20134, with five home runs off the bats of Rich Rollins, Zoilo Versalles, Tony Oliva, Don Mincher and Harmon Killebrew in the seventh inning. These five home runs still stand as a Major League record for the most home runs batted in a single inning, and were hit off starter Catfish Hunter (two), reliever Paul Lindblad (two), and reliever John Wyatt. *June 10 \u2013 Sonny Siebert of the Cleveland Indians no-hits the Washington Senators 2\u20130 at Cleveland Stadium. The no-hitter is the first by an Indian since Bob Feller's third career no-hitter, in . ===July=== *July 3 \u2013 Atlanta pitcher Tony Cloninger hits two grand slams in a game against the Giants; he thus becomes the first National League player and only pitcher in Major League history to do so. His nine RBI in a game also is a record for pitchers. *July 9 \u2013 Astroturf is finally installed in the Astrodome outfield. *July 12 \u2013 At St. Louis, Maury Wills' 10th-inning single scores Tim McCarver, as the National League wins 2\u20131 over the American League in the All-Star Game, but AL Brooks Robinson's stellar game (three hits, eight fielding chances) earns him the MVP honors. *July 21 \u2013 Against the Washington Senators in D.C., Minnesota Twins pitcher Jim Merritt strikes out twelve in a 1-0 shutout win. Seven of the twelve are consecutive, in the middle innings, to set an American League record. The final out in Merritt's string is his mound opponent Jim Hannan, who ironically had struck out Merritt just prior to the strikeout streak beginning. *July 25 \u2013 During his Hall of Fame induction speech, Ted Williams publicly calls on baseball to induct former great players from the Negro Leagues. He specifically calls for the induction of Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. Williams' wish becomes true 5 years later when Satchel Paige is inducted into the Hall of Fame. *July 27 \u2013 At Dodger Stadium, Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers faces Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies in the first matchup of perfect game pitchers. The Dodgers defeat the Phillies 2-1 in 12 innings with neither pitcher involved in the decision; both pitchers had pitched 11 innings with Koufax giving up four hits and striking out 16 and Bunning six hits and striking out 12. *July 29 \u2013 Mickey Mantle homers against Bruce Howard of the White Sox. It is his 494th career home run and he passes Lou Gehrig for 6th place on the all-time list. The Yankees and Al Downing beat the Chicago White Sox, 2-1. ===August=== *August 15 \u2013 The Orioles left-handed slugger Boog Powell hits 3 opposite-field homers over the left-field Green Monster at Fenway Park. Powell has 13 total bases in the game, won by Baltimore, 4-2, in 11 innings. *August 29 \u2013 The Detroit Tigers' Denny McLain wins his 16th start of the season, even though he doesn't do it that way.

However, he strikes out 11 in a 6-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles. ===September=== *September 11 \u2013 Pat Jarvis became the first strikeout victim of Nolan Ryan's career. *September 12 \u2013 Ron Perranoski of the Los Angeles Dodgers fans the first six batters he faces and earns a 3\u20132 win over the New York Mets.

The Yankees will stay in the cellar for the remainder of the season, finishing there for the first time since . *September 22 \u2013 The Baltimore Orioles beat the host Kansas City Athletics, 6\u20131, to clinch their first American League pennant since the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore. Both Brooks Robinson and Frank Robinson have two runs batted in. Frank Robinson will end the year as the Triple Crown winner, the first to achieve the feat since Mickey Mantle in , after hitting a .316 batting average with 49 home runs and 122 RBI. *September 25 \u2013 Against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field, in a battle of Jewish-American left-handers, Ken Holtzman of the Chicago Cubs has a no- hitter broken up on a Dick Schofield single leading off the ninth. Schofield later scores on a Maury Wills single; the two hits are all Holtzman allows in a 2\u20131 victory over the Dodgers in what will be Sandy Koufax's final regular- season loss. The Cubs score their two runs in the first as Don Kessinger, who had walked leading off the inning, scores on Glenn Beckert's triple one batter later; Beckert later scores as Jim Lefebvre drops Ernie Banks' pop-up for what would have been the third out. *September 26 \u2013 Willie McCovey hits his 200th career home run, helping the San Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves, 8\u20132. ===October=== *October 2 \u2013 In the second game of a doubleheader at Connie Mack Stadium, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 6\u20133 as Sandy Koufax bests Jim Bunning in what will be the final regular-season game of Koufax's career. Despite giving up the three runs in the ninth inning, Koufax goes the distance and strikes out Jackie Brandt for the final out. *October 9 \u2013 In Game Four of the World Series, Dave McNally wrapped up a brilliant pitching display, and the first World Series Championship for the Baltimore Orioles, with a four-hit, 1\u20130 shutout against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Series MVP Frank Robinson hits a home run off Don Drysdale for the only run of the game and gave Baltimore a sweep of the defending World Series Champion Dodgers. The shutout completes a World Series record 33 scoreless innings pitched by Orioles pitchers, beginning with Moe Drabowsky pitching 6 innings in relief of McNally in Game One, followed by shutouts by Jim Palmer and Wally Bunker\u2014neither of whom had pitched a shutout during the regular season. The Orioles are the last of the original eight American League franchises to win their first World Series. ===November=== *November 12 \u2013 The Los Angeles Dodgers complete an 18-game tour of Japan with a 9\u20138\u20131 record. The eight losses are the most for an MLB club touring the Far East. *November 18 \u2013 Sandy Koufax announces his retirement from baseball due to arthritis in his left elbow. Six years later he would become the youngest player elected to the Hall of Fame. *November 23 \u2013 Chicago White Sox outfielder Tommie Agee is voted American League Rookie of the Year, gathering 16 of the 18 votes.
