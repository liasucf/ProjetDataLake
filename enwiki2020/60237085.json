    "text": "Das M\u00e4dchen vom Pfarrhof is a 1955 Austrian Heimatfilm based on a Ludwig Anzengruber's play Der Pfarrer von Kirchfeld and directed by Alfred Lehner. The film lacks the more controversial themes of the play, such as criticism of celibacy and of the attitude of the Church to suicide and divorce; instead, it takes a more positive outlook, which is characteristic of the Heimatfilme of the period. A rival West German film version of Anzengruber's play was released two months before Das M\u00e4dchen vom Pfarrhof. == Synopsis == The beautiful, recently orphaned Annerl comes to stay with the young parish priest, Hell, and his housekeeper, Brigitte. Soon, Annerl and the priest find themselves becoming the target of rumors, fuelled by a local named Sepp who is bitter at the Church; this places the priest in a difficult position, and makes Annerl's suitor Michel jealous. == Cast == * Waltraut Haas as Annerl * Erich Auer as Fr. Hell * Franziska Kinz as Brigitte * Attila H\u00f6rbiger as Herr von Finsterberg * Helene Thimig as Gerberleni, Sepp's mother * Walter Ladengast as Sepp * Karl Ehmann as the other priest * Albert Rueprecht as Michel Berndorfer == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048403/ * https://www.filmportal.de/film/das-maedchen-vom- pfarrhof_9d0ea1ede0324696afd26cfeb9e0880d Category:1955 films Category:Austrian films Category:Austrian films based on plays Category:German-language films Category:Films based on works by Ludwig Anzengruber Category:Films about Catholic priests Category:Austrian film remakes Category:Films set in the Alps ",
