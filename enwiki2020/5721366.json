    "text": "Widnes was a county constituency in England, based on the town of Widnes, in Lancashire. It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. ==History== The constituency was formed as a Parliamentary division of Lancashire in 1885, including Allerton, Cronton, Ditton, Garston, Hale, Halewood, Huyton with Roby, Little Woolton, Much Woolton, Speke, Tarbock, Whiston and Widnes. In 1918 it was redefined to cover the municipal borough of Widnes, along with the urban districts of Prescot and Huyton with Roby and the Whiston Rural District. The two urban districts and part of the rural district (the parishes of Eccleston, Kirkby, Knowsley, and Windle) became part of a new Huyton constituency in 1950, with Widnes retaining the borough and the remainder of the rural district. In 1971 Widnes featured the last by-election to date to have only a Labour and a Conservative candidate. Its boundaries remained unchanged in 1974. In 1983 Widnes constituency was abolished and replaced by Halton constituency.Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 2 == Members of Parliament == {|class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1885 || Tom Edwards-Moss || Conservative |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1892 || John Saunders Gilliat || Conservative |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1900 || William Walker || Coalition Conservative |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1919 by-election || Arthur Henderson || Labour |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1922 || Christopher Clayton || Conservative |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1929 || Alexander Gordon Cameron || Labour |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1931 || Roland Robinson || Conservative |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1935 || Richard Pilkington || Conservative |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1945 || Christopher Shawcross || Labour |- | style=\"background-color: \" | || 1950 || James MacColl || Labour |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | 1971 by-election || Gordon Oakes || Labour |- | | 1983 |colspan=\"2\"| constituency abolished |} == Election results == ===Elections in the 1970s=== ===Elections in the 1960s=== ===Elections in the 1950s=== ===Elections in the 1940s=== ===Elections in the 1930s=== ===Elections in the 1920s=== ===Elections in the 1910s=== ===Elections in the 1900s=== ===Elections in the 1890s=== ===Elections in the 1880s=== ==References== == Sources == * Category:Parliamentary constituencies in North West England (historic) Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 1885 Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies disestablished in 1983 Category:Borough of Halton ",
