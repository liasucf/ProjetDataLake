    "text": "James Charles Critchell Bullock (1898 \u2013 1953) was an Englishman best known for his diaries and photographs of an expedition with John Hornby across the Barren Grounds of Canada's Northwest Territories. Bullock was born at 81 East Street, Chichester, England on 6 September 1898. He was educated at Cliff House Preparatory School in Southbourne, went to Sherborne School (Dorset) and later attended the Royal Military College, from where he joined the 18th Bengal Lancers in 1916 as a subaltern officer. During the First World War, he served in the Fifth Cavalry Division in France and Belgium and in the Desert Mounted Corps in Palestine and Syria. Bullock was the official cinematographer for General Allenby's arrival in Aleppo. He was an athletic man of 6 feet, 2 inches who not only won boxing competitions at Sherborne School, but later also boxed for the Cavalry Corps. Hunting and photo expeditions led him along the upper Nile and to Kurdistan. After two years in hospital with injuries and various tropical diseases, he was decommissioned in 1923 and later that year \"in search of health\" went to Canada, where he met John Hornby, with whom he undertook an expedition into and across Canada's Barren Lands. His diaries from that trip were the basis of two books: Snow Man: John Hornby in the Barren Lands (1931) by Malcolm Waldron and Letters from the Barren Lands (2020) by Carsten Iwers. In 1950, Bullock left England with his family to live in Kenya where he committed suicide on 30 March 1953 and was buried at the City Park Cemetery of Nairobi, Section 11, Lot 95. ==References== ==Further reading== * James Charles Critchell Bullock, Letters from the Barren Lands (edited by Carsten Iwers, Germany, 2020) * Malcolm Waldron, Snow Man: John Hornby in the Barren Lands, Kodansha America 1997 reprint (originally published in 1931), ==External links== *Pictures from the Bullock-Hornby expedition *Critchell Bullock Arm on Google maps (63\u00b026'13.6\" N 106\u00b059'51.2\" W) Category:British soldiers Category:People from Chichester Category:1898 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Suicides in Kenya ",
