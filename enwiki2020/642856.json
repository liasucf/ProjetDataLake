    "text": "Baie-Comeau (; 2016 city population 21,536; CA population 27,692) is a city located approximately north-east of Quebec City in the C\u00f4te-Nord region of the province of Quebec, Canada. It is located on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River near the mouth of the Manicouagan River, and is the seat of Manicouagan Regional County Municipality. There are two urban area population centres within the city limits: Baie-Comeau proper, with a population of 9,610, and Hauterive, with a population of 11,549, as of the 2016 Canadian Census. The city is named after the adjacent Comeau Bay, which is named in honour of Napol\u00e9on-Alexandre Comeau, a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois naturalist. Baie-Comeau is the birthplace of former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney. ==History== The oldest part of Baie-Comeau is the area known as Vieux-Poste (Old Post) near the mouth of the Am\u00e9d\u00e9e River where in 1889, the Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-de-Manicouagan Mission was founded by Eudists. In 1898, the first sawmill in the C\u00f4te-Nord region was built there by the brothers Damase and Henri Jalbert, but it closed in 1907 after their timber stock was swept into the St. Lawrence. In 1916, Route 138 was extended to Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-de-Manicouagan and in 1929, its post office opened with the English name of Comeau Bay (Gallicized in 1936). Baie- Comeau itself (the eastern part of the current town) was founded in 1936 when a paper mill was constructed by Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune. Arthur A. Schmon oversaw the project, which included a power station and housing. Experiencing remarkable growth, the Town of Baie-Comeau was incorporated the following year. The area continued to see economic development with the establishment of the hydro-electric power stations on the Manicouagan and Outardes Rivers beginning with the Chutes-aux-Outardes Station in 1952, an aluminum smelter in 1958, and grain warehouses (the largest in Canada) in 1959. In 1950, the village of Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-de-Manicouagan was incorporated as the Municipality of Hauterive. In June 1982, Hauterive was merged into Baie-Comeau, taking effect on January 1, 1983. Baie-Comeau is the seat of the judicial district of Baie-Comeau.Territorial Division Act. Revised Statutes of Quebec D-11. ==Demographics== The population was 25,554 at the 1996 census, declining to 22,402 according to the census of 2006. This decrease in population over the span of a decade is partly explained by the fact that many baby-boomers not born in the city retire then move elsewhere. The absence of university and many college-level courses forces young people to get their education elsewhere; there are few employment opportunities which drives migration to the larger urban areas of Montreal or Quebec City.
