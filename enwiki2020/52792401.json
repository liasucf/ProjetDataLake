In 1766, Arent Traphagen, the grandsonson of William Traphagen, relocated the tavern to its present location, where the King\u2019s Highway intersected the Sepasco Trail. When winter closed the river, the road was the only avenue of travel. It served as a stage-house for stage coaches. Stables were erected to accommodate the change of horses.Morse, Howard Holdridge.

Around 1765, a spring near the roadside supplied a well that became the \"town pump\". During the last third of the 18th century, the inn, was then known as the Bogardus Tavern. Arent Traphagen died in 1769 and the tavern was purchased by Everardus Bogardus, great-grandson of the New Netherlands dominie. It was host to many leaders of the American Revolution, including George Washington, Philip Schuyler, Benedict Arnold and Alexander Hamilton.
