    "text": "is a Japanese boxing manga series written by Asao Takamori and illustrated by Tetsuya Chiba. The story follows a young boxer named Joe Yabuki, who lives in the Tokyo slums. Ashita no Joe was first serialized by Kodansha in Weekly Shonen Magazine from January 1, 1968 to May 13, 1973 and was later collected into 20 tank\u014dbon volumes. During its serialization, it was popular with working-class people and college students in Japan. It has been adapted into various media, including the Megalo Box anime, a futuristic reimagining of the original that was made as a part of the 50th anniversary of Ashita no Joe. The manga has been considered to be one of the most influential manga, with many anime and manga referencing it. ==Plot== Joe Yabuki is a young drifter who meets Danpei Tange, a former boxing trainer while wandering through Doya, a fictional slum near Tokyo. Several months later, Joe is arrested for fraud and is thrown into a temporary jail where he fights Nishi Kanichi, the leader of a group of hooligans. He and Nishi then go to the , a juvenile detention center miles away from Tokyo. There Joe meets T\u014dru Rikiishi, a former boxing prodigy, and a rivalry develops between them after Rikiishi stopped Joe and Nishi from escaping the prison. They attempt to resolve the rivalry by facing each other in a boxing match in which Rikiishi dominates Joe until the latter hits him with a cross-counter, resulting in both being knocked out. Feeling that the outcome of the match did not resolve anything, Joe and Rikiishi vow to fight again. As Rikiishi learns he is meant to leave the prison, he challenges Joe to a fight in the future, and the two promise to meet again, this time as professional boxers. Upon his release from prison, Joe initially has trouble gaining a boxing license due to his lack of formal education but succeeds in his second attempt with the help of Danpei and Nishi. Joe manages to go up to Bantamweight, after provoking a champion boxer named Wolf Kanagushi. Joe quickly rises in the ranks and gains popularity for his brawling style, and trademark cross-counter KO wins. Joe manages to perform a triple-cross counter on Wolf. Joe then earns the right to fight Rikiishi in the professional ring. Although Rikiishi is assured a promising career, he is intent in settling his score with Joe, whom he feels stands in his path. Because Rikiishi is three weight classes above Joe, he has to cut down a massive amount of weight and undergoes an incredibly taxing weight loss program which includes severe dehydration. Rikiishi knocks Joe out in the 8th round and wins, but dies after from the combined effects of the extreme weight loss on his body and brain hemorrhage that he sustained from Joe during the fight. Joe is still shaken up from that match, both mentally and physically. Soon after, during matches, his trainer Danpei realizes that Joe is unable to give headshots to his opponents, Rikiishi's accidental death having traumatized him. It takes Joe quite some time to get over it and costs him three straight losses and finally conquers his fears when he faces the globally #6 ranked Carlos Rivera. The fight ends with a draw, yet it gives Joe tremendous fame and respect around the world, especially since Carlos was going to face the World Champion Jos\u00e9 Mendoza in his next match. Joe starts to climb up the boxing ladder, but struggles with maintaining bantamweight due to a late growth spurt, forcing him to undergo strenuous training similar to what Rikiishi had to. He defeats the Asian\u2013Pacific Champion, Kim Yong-bi, a South Korean boxer and survivor of the Korean War, dedicating the win to Rikiishi. After winning the title match, Joe defends his title. He wins all defenses, ultimately defending it against the Malaysian fighter Harimau. He is now given the chance to face the World Champion Jos\u00e9 Mendoza, who defeated Carlos Rivera with a KO punch in the first round, ending his boxing career. It is later revealed that Carlos had developed permanent brain damage from his fight. The fight is held in a packed stadium, and is attended by many of Joe's friends and former rivals, including Wolf and the now sickly and haggard Carlos. Joe faces Mendoza, even though he is at a disadvantage since it was revealed he was punch-drunk, and has lost vision in one eye. The match is a brutal back-and-forth with Joe able to knock down the Champion more than once. Though originally composed, Jos\u00e9 starts losing his mind as Joe keeps getting up no matter how much damage he takes, to the point that he wonders if he is trapped in a nightmare. The match goes all of its fifteen rounds, with Mendoza barely gaining a win by points, but much to the shock of the audience, Jos\u00e9 has seemingly aged decades in minutes from the toll the fight has taken on his body, with his hair turned snow white from the trauma he has experienced. Danpei turns to console Joe only to find him unresponsive, but with a smile on his face. It has been debated among fans whether Joe died or not and Chiba even said that he drew the ending scene at the last minute.http://www.manga-audition.com/tetsuya-chiba-interview/ ==Media== ===Manga=== Ashita no Joe originally serialized in Japan in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine from January 1, 1968 to May 13, 1973.

For the animated adaptation of the manga Naruto, animator Atsushi Wakabayashi from Pierrot said he was influenced by Ashita no Joe. This was mostly because the staff members were fans of the series and felt the character Naruto Uzumaki to be close to the type of archetype they rooted for when watching the series. As a result, Wakabayashi and the rest of the staff members made Naruto stand out in episode 133 where there was too much focus in his fight against Sasuke Uchiha, whom he shared an intense rivalry. ==References== ==External links== *Chiba Tetsuya's Official Site *Official Konami website of Ashita no Joe Makkani Moeagare! *Official Konami website of Ashita no Joe Masshiro ni Moe Tsukiro! * Category:1968 manga Category:1970 anime television series Category:1980 anime films Category:1980 anime television series Category:1981 anime films Category:Animated films based on manga Category:Boxing in anime and manga Category:Discotek Media Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Ikki Kajiwara Category:Japanese films Category:Manga adapted into films Category:Nippon TV original programming Category:Television shows written by Eriko Shinozaki Category:Sh\u014dnen manga Category:TMS Entertainment Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System original programming Category:Gekiga ",
