Described as a multi- genre concept album with a total of eleven tracks, the album was released by SM Entertainment on October 12, 2018, and distributed by IRIVER. This marks NCT 127's first Korean major release in a year and four months since their previous EP, Cherry Bomb, which was released in June 2017. It is also their first release as a ten-member group since the addition of Jungwoo in September 2018. Upon its release, Regular-Irregular attained commercial success in both South Korea and other countries. The album debuted atop the Gaon Album Chart and became one of the few releases to stay longer than a single week at No. 1 in 2018. Additionally, it debuted at No. 86 on the US Billboard 200 in the week of October 27, 2018, thus becoming NCT 127's first entry on the chart. It is also the group's highest charting release on the UK and France's download albums charts and first entry on the Australian Digital Albums chart. The album's repackage, Regulate, was released on November 23, 2018, along with its lead single, \"Simon Says\". ==Background and release== ===Regular-Irregular=== On September 17, a teaser video was released on the group's Twitter account which shows flashes of the words \"regular\" and \"irregular\", as well as a new NCT 127 logo. Later that day, SM Entertainment announced the addition of Jungwoo to the group and that NCT 127 would release its first full-length album Regular-Irregular on October 12. Following the announcement, NCT 127 entered the Billboard's Social 50 at number five for the week of September 29. Photo and video teasers were released from September 18 up to October 11. On October 8, NCT 127 released the music video of the English version of their new single \"Regular\", which marks the group's first English-language song. The music video for the Korean version of \"Regular\" was released on October 11, 2018. The album was released on October 12, 2018. ===Regulate=== On November 13, 2018, NCT 127 announced the release of the album's repackage, Regulate with teasers of the members. The album and its lead single, \"Simon Says\", released on November 23, 2018. ==Composition== The album's theme revolves around the exploration reality and dreams. The album incorporates several genres; such as pop, dance, R&B;, ballad and hip-hop. \"Regular\" is described as a high-energy hip hop track with sensual Latin vibes that incorporates Spanish lyrics. Billboard noted that unlike many Korean songs re-released by K-pop bands in other languages, the English version of \"Regular\" differentiates itself from the Korean version through the content of their lyrics. The Korean one addresses their current state as a group trying to make its way in the world, in contrast to the hopeful, goal-oriented swagger expressed in the English alternative. While both versions focus on money, the Korean addresses the reality of their world versus the luxurious lifestyle expressed in the English. The sixth track, \"Interlude: Regular to Irregular\" contains the music used in the video \"NCT 2018 Yearbook #1\" as well as a rearranged version of a future bass composition (titled \"The 7th Sense \u2013 Reverse\") by Korean electronica musician Hitchhiker that was performed by the sub-unit in the 2017 Mnet Asian Music Awards. The track also contains narrations done in Korean (by new member Jungwoo), Japanese (by Yuta) and Mandarin (by Winwin), as well as a verse from the American author Edgar Allan Poe's 1849 poem \"A Dream Within a Dream\" narrated by member Johnny. The eighth track, \"Come Back\", is a Korean version of the originally released Japanese track off their debut Japanese EP Chain. The bonus track, \"Run Back 2 U\", is the complete version of the demo song (originally titled \"Bassbot\") the sub- unit has performed when majority of the members were still part of the SM Rookies project in 2015. ==Promotion== ===Regular-Irregular=== NCT 127 kick- started promotions for the album in the U.S. with television promotions and a partnership with Apple Music.
