On 14 February 1941, Gorbachyov was awarded the Order of the Red Star on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Border Troops. The commander of NKVD forces in the Transbaikal district assessed him as a \"mature and serious commander\" who was firm, decisive, and disciplined. == World War II == After Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, several new rifle divisions were formed under the command of officers from the NKVD Border Troops.

The officers were drawn from the NKVD Border Troops, while the enlisted men were called-up reservists. The 250th was relocated to the Rzhev area on 15 July, the same day that Gorbachyov was promoted to major general. From there the division marched through Olenino to positions south of Belyi. The division was assigned to the 30th Army and entered the Battle of Smolensk on 22 July, counterattacking towards Dukhovshchina to stop the German advance. Two days later, Gorbachyov and the division commissar visited elements of the 250th at Demyakhi.
