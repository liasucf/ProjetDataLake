    "text": "Shopgirl is a 2000 novella written by Steve Martin. Martin adapted his book for a 2005 film of the same title. ==Synopsis== Its titular character is 28-year-old Mirabelle Buttersfield, a lonely, depressed Vermont transplant who sells expensive evening gloves nobody ever buys at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills and spends her evenings watching television with her two cats. She moved to California in an attempt to find herself and fall in love but instead takes medication to fight off depression. Much to her chagrin, she is pursued by Jeremy, a socially inept and unambitious slacker and roadie for a band, and winds up entertaining his advances to avoid being alone. After a middle-aged, womanizing Seattle millionaire named Ray Porter visits her store and sends her a dinner invitation, the two begin to date. She attempts to forge a relationship with him, even though it's clear Porter isn't looking for a long- term commitment. Along the way, the story explores the deeper meaning behind their opposing intentions.Lanchester, John. The Counter Life. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/29/reviews/001029.29lanchet.html. Accessed November 14, 2017. Also playing roles in her life are her father, a dysfunctional Vietnam War veteran, and Lisa, her promiscuous, image-obsessed co-worker and voracious rival. ==Reception== In his review in the New York Times, John Lanchester called it an \"elegant, bleak, desolatingly sad first novella\" and added, \"The prose here is sometimes flat . . . the happy ending feels as if it has wandered in from somewhere else; and there is a touching confidence in the efficacy of self-help books. But there is nonetheless an impressive gravity about Shopgirl. Its glints of comedy are sharp and dry . . . The novella has an edge to it, and a deep, unassuageable loneliness. Steve Martin's most achieved work to date may well have the strange effect of making people glad not to be Steve Martin.\" New York Times review Sienna Powers of January Magazine said \"Shopgirl is the work of a mature, self-possessed writer . . . Martin infuses his story with a dark verve that is his own. The author's tone is at once blas\u00e9 and gentle and in the novella's 130 pages, he quietly presents us with a cast of characters that it's difficult not to care about.\" January Magazine review In Entertainment Weekly, Margot Mifflin graded the book B with the comment, \"Once you adjust to his newfound sincerity, Martin's shift from public follies to private frailties registers as courageous and convincing. If only he'd fleshed out his supporting cast, this would be Pure Gold.\" Entertainment Weekly review The book entered the New York Times list of bestsellers at #6 on October 29, 2000.New York Times, October 29, 2000 It peaked at #4 and remained on the list for fifteen weeks.New York Times, February 11, 2001 ==References== Category:2000 American novels Category:American novellas Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in Beverly Hills, California Category:Novels by Steve Martin Category:Hyperion Books books ",
