    "text": "was daimy\u014d of Owari Domain during early Edo period Japan. ==Biography== Tokugawa Mitsutomo was the eldest son of the first daimy\u014d of Owari Domain, Tokugawa Yoshinao by a concubine. He undertook his genpuku ceremony under Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Iemitsu on May 3, 1630, and was given the adult name of the \"Mitsuyoshi\", which included the same kanji \"Mitsu\" as the Sh\u014dgun. As a further sign of favor, his official wife, Chiyohime later Reisen-in, was also the daughter of sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Iemitsu. His childhood name was Gor\u014dta (\u4e94\u90ce\u592a). On the death of his father on June 28, 1650, he became the 2rd Tokugawa daimy\u014d of Owari Domain, with lower 3rd court rank and the courtesy title of Captain of the Right Imperial Guards. He completed the clan mortuary temple of Kenchu- ji the following year, and was raised to upper 3rd court rank and Ch\u016bnagon on August 12, 1653. On November 1, 1671, he formally changed his name to \"Mitsutomo\". On May 4, 1690, he received the courtesy title of Dainagon, and a week later was awarded 2nd Court Rank. On April 25, 1693, he officially retired, turning his offices and position as clan heed to his son, Tokugawa Tsunanari; however, although officially retired, he continued to wield all political power using his son's name, until his son's death on July 1, 1699. During this period, he lived at the \u014czone Shimoyashiki, a palatial palace with extensive gardens some distance from Nagoya Castle. In addition to his official wife (a daughter of Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Iemitsu), Mitsutomo had at least 10 official concubines, by whom he had 17 children (11 male, 6 female). Noted for his accomplishments in the Japanese tea ceremony and Japanese calligraphy, Mitsutomo was especially noted as a master of the Shinkage-ry\u016b style of Japanese swordsmanship, having been taught by the Owari Yagy\u016b clan. He proved so adept that he was named the 6th s\u014dke by Yagy\u016b Toshikane, and added a number of teaching concepts to the ry\u016b. His grave is at the Owari Tokugawa clan temple of Kench\u016b-ji in Nagoya. ==Family== * Father: Tokugawa Yoshinao * Mother: Ojo no Kata or Yoshida-dono * Wife: Tokugawa Chiyohime, daughter of Tokugawa Iemitsu * Concubines: ** Higuchi-dono ** Seshin'in ** Iyo-dono ** Ohisa no Kata ** Oito no Kata ** Otei no Kata ** Otsune no Kata ** Ofuchi no kata ** Umeda-dono ** Kimura-dono * Children: ** Tokugawa Tsunanari by Chiyohime ** Matsudaira Yoshiyuki (1656\u20131715) by Chiyohime ** Toyohime (b.1655) by Chiyohime ** Naohime (1658\u20131661) by Chiyohime ** Matsudaira Yoshimasa (1651\u20131713) by Higuchi ** Matsudaira Yasunaga (1661\u20131675) by Seishin'in ** Atehime (1666\u20131683) married Asano Tsunanaga by Seishin'in ** Senosuke (b.1676) by Seishin'in ** Hachirotaro (1668\u20131669) by Iyo ** Matsudaira Tomoshige (1669\u20131702) by Iyo ** Chotakeru by Iyo ** Hidehime (b.1673) by Ohiya ** Nohime (b.1674) by Oito ** Mannosuke (1676\u20131681) by Otei ** Mannanosuke (b.1678) by Otsune ** Kannosuke (b.1677) by Ofuchi ** Matsudaira Tomoaki (1678\u20131728) by Umeda ** Motohime (1679\u20131690) by Kimura == References == * Papinot, Edmond.
