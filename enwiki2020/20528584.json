    "text": "Linthicum Walks is a historic home and farm complex at Crofton, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It consists of a 19th-century frame dwelling (part of which may be 18th century), a mid-19th century meathouse, a frame pre-1815 tobacco barn, and a family cemetery dating to the mid 19th century. The complex is representative of the vernacular architecture of rural Tidewater Maryland of the late 18th through mid 19th centuries. The tobacco house is especially noteworthy, as one of only three pre-1815 tobacco houses surviving in the county. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The arboretum at Historic Linthicum Walks was accredited as an ArbNet Level 1 Arboretum in August 2016. Highlights are the Cedrus atlantica (Blue Atlas cedar) and Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar), plus specimens including Chinese elm, dogwood, holly, magnolia, and maple. ==References== Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Houses in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Farms in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anne Arundel County, Maryland ",
