In 1839, Bishop was appointed to the newly created position of superintendent of schools in Providence, Rhode Island.

In 1851, Bishop was named Boston's first ever superintendent of schools. ===New York=== In 1858, Bishop moved to New York City. He planned to work in the publishing industry, however the aftermath of the Panic of 1857 made it impossible for him to start his new venture. That same year he married Caroline (Caldwell) Bleecker. They had one child together. During the American Civil War, Bishop was active in the United States Christian Commission. From 1863 to 1865 he served as the chairman of the commission's New York Branch.

Following his death, Bishop's wife contributed $10,000 towards the creation of the school, which was named Bishop College in his honor. Bishop gave the society $30,000 to retire its debts upon he retirement from the organization in 1877. ==Board of Indian Commissioners== In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Bishop to the Board of Indian Commissioners.
