It is the alternate road for U.S. Route 1-9 (US 1-9) that trucks must use because they are prohibited from using the Pulaski Skyway, which carries the main routes of US 1-9. It also serves traffic accessing the New Jersey Turnpike, Route 440, and Route 7. The route is a four- to six-lane road its entire length, with portions of it being a divided highway that runs through urban areas. From its south end to about halfway through Kearny, US 1-9 Truck is freeway-standard, with access to other roads controlled by interchanges. While the US 1-9 Truck designation was first used in 1953, the roadway comprising the route was originally designated as an extension of pre-1927 Route 1 in 1922, a route that in its full length stretched from Trenton to Jersey City. US 1-9 was designated along the road in 1926 and one year later, in 1927, this portion of pre-1927 Route 1 was replaced with Route 25 as well as with a portion of Route 1 north of the Communipaw Avenue intersection. Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US 1-9 and Route 25 were realigned to the new skyway. After trucks were banned from the skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In 1953, US 1-9 Truck was designated in favor of Route 25T and Route 1 along this segment of road. The portion of the truck route north of Route 7 is being rebuilt as part of a $271.9 million project to construct new approach roads to connect US 1-9 Truck, Route 7, the Pulaski Skyway, Route 139, and US 1-9 north of Tonnele Circle and local streets in Jersey City. Construction, which started in late 2008, was completed in late 2012. The highway is designated by NJDOT, and posted on reassurance shields as a north-south route. Recently updated mile posts erroneously designated the route as an east-west route, with west for southbound traffic and east for northbound traffic. ==Route description== Passaic River Bridge US 1-9 Truck begins at an interchange with access to and from the southbound direction US 1-9, the Pulaski Skyway, in the Ironbound section of the city of Newark in Essex County. The truck route is meant to bypass the portion of US 1-9 along the Pulaski Skyway, which trucks are restricted from. It merges onto Raymond Boulevard, which continues west from the US 1-9 and US 1-9 Truck interchange into downtown Newark. The truck restriction on Route 1-9 is for the \"safety and welfare of the public\" according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, not a specific bridge defect. At this point, the truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading to the east. A short distance later, the road comes to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and Doremus Avenue before crossing over the Passaic River on a vertical lift bridge. Here, the route enters Kearny in Hudson County and continues east into industrial areas as the Lincoln Highway. The road has a right-in/right-out in both directions that provides access to Jacobus Avenue before it comes to an interchange with County Route 659. From here, US 1-9 Truck passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and becomes a six-lane divided highway, coming to an at-grade intersection with Hackensack Avenue. Past this intersection, the road crosses the Hackensack River on a vertical lift bridge and enters Jersey City. Upon entering Jersey City, the road becomes Communipaw Avenue and intersects the northern terminus of Route 440 near the Hudson Mall. View north along US 1-9 Truck approaching the Hackensack River Bridge in Kearny At this intersection, Communipaw Avenue continues to the east and US 1-9 Truck turns to the north, becoming an unnamed four-lane undivided road. bisecting Lincoln Park before coming to an intersection with County Route 605. Here, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway again, passing some urban business areas before running between wetlands to the west and Holy Name Cemetery to the east. The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences, coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway. Here, US 1-9 Truck turns east on Broadway, running through a business district. A short distance later, it turns north onto an unnamed road with County Route 642 continuing east on Broadway. The route passes under PATH's Newark\u2013World Trade Center line and Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Northern Branch line before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway. Immediately after, US 1-9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and turns to the east, with County Route 645 continuing north at this intersection. The truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway called the St. Paul's Viaduct that runs to the north of the Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors, crossing over the Northern Branch line and County Route 646. A short distance later, US 1-9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US 1-9 and Route 139, where it ends. The East Coast Greenway runs along the north side of the highway. ==History== Route 25T (1934-1953) US 1-9 northbound at the beginning of US 1-9 Truck in Newark, with sign noting \"No Trucks\" on the approach to the Pulaski Skyway What is now US 1-9 Truck between Newark and Jersey City was originally chartered as part of Ferry Road by the New Jersey Colonial legislature in 1765. The road stretched from Newark to Jersey City along Ferry Street, US 1-9 Truck, Communipaw Avenue, and Grand Street. In 1828, the road became maintained by the Passaic and Hackensack Ferry and Road Company, and then by the Newark Plank Road and Ferry beginning 1849 (not to be confused with the similarly named Newark Plank Road). Though the company's contract was to be extended for fifty years in 1900, this was overturned by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1913 the road west of Lincoln Park became the first segment of the Lincoln Highway. The current route of US 1-9 Truck was designated to be an extension of pre-1927 Route 1 in 1922, a route that was to run from Trenton to Jersey City.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1922, Chapter 253. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, the current truck route became a part of the US 1-9 concurrency. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 25 was designated to run along the entire length of the route along with US 1-9 as part of its journey from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City, while Route 1 was also designated along the portion north of Communipaw Avenue in Jersey City as a part of its routing from Bayonne to Rockleigh.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US 1-9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge. After trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US 1-9 Truck was designated to replace all of Route 25T as well as the portion of Route 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle.1953 renumbering Beginning in 2009 the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) replaced the viaduct that carries the route over St. Paul's Avenue and Conrail line. The St. Paul's Viaduct was built in 1928 and determined structurally deficient. The $271.9 million replacement was completed in September 2011. In addition to replacing the St. Paul's Avenue viaduct, the approaches to US 1-9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved. In anticipation of a general increase of activity in Port of New York and New Jersey and new development on West Side and Hackensack Riverfront studies are being conducted to make the intersection with Route 440 a multi-level traffic circle and northern and southern (Route 440) approaches to it into a multi-use urban boulevard that includes grade separations and additional medians. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Route 1&9T St. Paul's Viaduct Replacement 01 Truck New Jersey Jersey City 01 Truck Jersey City Category:Limited-access roads in New Jersey U.S. Route 001 9 Truck 1 9 1 9 ",
