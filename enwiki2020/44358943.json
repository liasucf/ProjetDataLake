Bola\u00f1os then went on to work on projects related to sources of drinking water in Puebla City and Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, and in 1995 he was tapped to become an operations manager for the Decentralized Public Agency for the Provision of Water, Sewer and Sanitation Systems (ODAPAS). In 1997, Bola\u00f1os became the director general of the Drinking Water and Sewer System of Cuernavaca, his first government post of several in Morelos. Three years later, he became the executive secretary of the Morelos State Water and Environment Commission. In 2006, after a time on the state party executive committee, the National Action Party placed Bola\u00f1os on its proportional representation list and sent him to the Chamber of Deputies for the LX Legislature of the Mexican Congress. He sat on commissions including Metropolitan Development, Environment and Natural Resources, Special on Harassment of Journalists and Media, Special on Water Rights and Protection of Aquatic Environments, and Investigative on Social and Ecological Damage Generated by PEMEX.
