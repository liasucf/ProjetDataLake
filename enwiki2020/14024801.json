    "text": "Falko Traber (born in Besan\u00e7on, France, October 13, 1959) is a German high wire artist. He is a direct descendant of one of the oldest artistic families in Germany, the legendary Zugspitze tightrope artists. The name was given to the Traber family show after their spectacular performance in 1952, after their 2964-meter-high performance on the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany. Born during a tour in France, Falko Traber traveled with his family to more than forty countries. Falko Traber is the last of his brothers to still perform the high wire; his brother Charlie died in 2007 at the age of fifty-four. Traber made the profession of high-wire artist his calling, and set a large number of world records. An exhibit devoted to Traber and his career has been on display in the National Museum in Karlsruhe for several years. == World records == *1978: Spent ten days and ten nights (264 hours) continuously on a high wire in D\u00fcsseldorf *1982: Spent eleven days and nights in Alstertal Shopping Center *1996: Crossed the town of Baden-Baden on a 640-meter-long and up to 60-meter-high wire rope *1997: Set another length world record in Weil am Rhein, crossing 700 meters of rope on the rear wheel of his specially made Suzuki motorcycle at an altitude of 80 meters *1999: Re- enacted the feat of his ancestors as a culmination of his previous work, crossing the Zugspitze with a bicycle on a 12 mm wire rope 600 meters high.
