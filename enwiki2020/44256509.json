    "text": "The Cozumelan golden bat (Mimon cozumelae) is a bat species from Central and northern South America. It is found in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. At one time this species was considered to be a subspecies of the golden bat (Mimon bennettii). Little is known about the biology of this bat but it has a wide range, no particular threats have been identified and the population seems steady, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\". ==Taxonomy and etymology== It was described as a new species in 1914 by American zoologist Edward Alphonso Goldman. The holotype had been collected on Cozumel by G. F. Gaumer. At times, it has been considered a subspecies of the golden bat, Mimon bennettii. ==Description== Its forearm length is . Individuals weigh approximately . It has a dental formula of for a total of 30 teeth. ==Biology and ecology== It roosts in small groups by day, mostly in limestone caves, but sometimes in hollow logs. It hunts at night and may glean prey from tree foliage. Its diet is known to include beetles, katydids, birds and lizards. Breeding takes place at the start of the rainy season with females giving birth to a single offspring. ==Range and habitat== The Cozumelan golden bat is a lowland species and is found in mature evergreen forest, semi-deciduous forest and dry forest. It has been documented at a range of elevations from above sea level. ==References== Category:Phyllostomidae Category:Bats of Central America Category:Bats of South America Category:Bats of Mexico Category:Mammals of Colombia Category:Least concern biota of North America Category:Mammals described in 1914 Category:Taxa named by Edward Alphonso Goldman ",
