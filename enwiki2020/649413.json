Although no such sport actually existed, the German-language Der neue Pauly Enzyklopaedie der Antike, edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, ) gives a description of it as an ancient Greco- Roman sport that anticipates modern soccer. The article goes on to cite suitably sparse documentation for the non-existent sport (this includes a Festschrift to one M. Sammer), and to assert that a Roman form of the game enjoyed a certain popularity amongst the Roman legions, and consequently spread throughout the Empire as far afield as Britain, \"where the game enjoyed a revival in the 19th century.\" (It also notes that the game was frowned upon by some early Christian writers, such as Tertullian.) In reality, the ancient Romans did play a game resembling rugby called harpastum. ==External links== * A facsimile of the article, accompanied by a mock review by two classical scholars and another piece in which Wolfgang H\u00fcbner discusses the review.
