Under the command of second-year head coach John Rauch, the Raiders went 13\u20131 (an AFL record) and captured their first Western Division title. The addition of strong-armed quarterback Daryle Lamonica greatly energized the Raiders' vertical passing game. Additionally, the Raiders added Gene Upshaw, Willie Brown, and George Blanda to their roster during the 1967 offseason. All three players would eventually be elected to the Hall of Fame. The Raiders routed the Houston Oilers in the 1967 AFL Championship Game. The victory allowed them to advance to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the NFL champion Green Bay Packers. The Raiders would ultimately finish the season with a record of 14\u20132. The 1967 season was a massive breakthrough for the Raiders organization. Between 1967 and 1985, the team would go on win twelve division titles and three Super Bowl championships. ==Offseason== ===1967 AFL draft=== ==Roster== ==Team leaders== ;Passing Daryle Lamonica \u2013 3,228 yds., 30 TD, 20 INT, 80.8 rating ;Rushing Clem Daniels \u2013 130 att., 575 yds., 4 TD ;Receiving Fred Biletnikoff \u2013 40 rec., 876 yds., 5 TD ==Regular season== Over the course of a fourteen-game regular season schedule, the Raiders faced six of the other eight AFL teams twice, with one game against the Eastern Division's Houston Oilers and Miami Dolphins.

Roger Hagberg caught one touchdown and ran for another for Oakland. ===Week 7=== Oakland broke the 50-point mark for the second time in 1967, as the Raiders crushed the San Diego Chargers in their first meeting of the season. Daryle Lamonica and George Blanda combined for three touchdown passes, while Lamonica ran for two more scores. Lance Alworth caught a 71-yard touchdown for the Chargers. ===Week 8=== Oakland held off a late comeback by the Broncos to preserve a narrow victory at Bears Stadium. The Raiders built an 18\u20137 halftime lead on the strength of two touchdown receptions by Bill Miller, but could only manage one field goal in the second half. Jim LeClair ran for a 1-yard Denver touchdown in the final period. ===Week 9=== The Raiders scored 17 points in the final period to pull away from the expansion Miami Dolphins. Daryle Lamonica connected with Billy Cannon for three scores, while Clem Daniels ran for another. Bob Griese threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Doug Moreau in the second quarter to give the Dolphins a three-point lead at halftime. ===Week 10=== Oakland improved to 9\u20131 by doubling up on the Chiefs in front of more than 44,000 in Municipal Stadium. Five different Raiders (Fred Biletnikoff, Willie Brown, Pete Banaszak, Warren Powers, and Larry Todd) scored touchdowns, while the Chiefs got touchdown receptions from Frank Pitts and Otis Taylor. ===Week 11=== The Raiders' offense continued to pile up points on the season, as Daryle Lamonica threw for four more touchdowns. Billy Cannon caught two, while Bill Miller and Fred Biletnikoff caught one each. Charger quarterback John Hadl passed for two scores and ran for another. ===Week 12=== Four George Blanda field goals and a 27-yard touchdown run by Hewritt Dixon lifted Oakland to its eleventh win of the season, while the Raiders defense held the Houston Oilers to just one touchdown. The game was played at Rice Stadium. ===Week 13=== The Raiders avenged their only loss of the season in front of a home crowd of 53,011. The Jets scored first on a 28-yard pass from Joe Namath to Don Maynard. Daryle Lamonica threw for three touchdowns, while Roger Hagberg and Hewritt Dixon ran for one touchdown each. ===Week 14=== A 6-yard touchdown run by Hewritt Dixon broke a 21\u201321 tie in the fourth quarter, as the Raiders edged the Bills to end their regular season with a 13\u20131 mark, the best in franchise history. The Oakland defense capitalized on Buffalo turnovers, converting two fumble recoveries into touchdowns in the second and third quarters. Daryle Lamonica found Billy Cannon for a 23-yard touchdown pass in the first period. ==Regular season team statistics== In the 1967 regular season, the defense led the league with 67 sacks and 665 yards lost, the latter still an all-time record, the Raiders leading the league in sacks from 1966 to 1968, also an all-time record. ==Postseason== With a 13\u20131 record, the Raiders captured their first AFL Western Division title and advanced to the 1967 AFL Championship against the Eastern Division champion Houston Oilers.
