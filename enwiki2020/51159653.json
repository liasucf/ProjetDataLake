    "text": "The Fibonacci word fractal is a fractal curve defined on the plane from the Fibonacci word. == Definition == The first iterations L-system representationRam\u00edrez, Jos\u00e9 L.; Rubiano, Gustavo N. (2014). \"Properties and Generalizations of the Fibonacci Word Fractal\", The Mathematical Journal, Vol. 16. This curve is built iteratively by applying, to the Fibonacci word 0100101001001...etc., the Odd\u2013Even Drawing rule: For each digit at position k : # Draw a segment forward # If the digit is 0: #* Turn 90\u00b0 to the left if k is even #* Turn 90\u00b0 to the right if k is odd To a Fibonacci word of length F_n (the nth Fibonacci number) is associated a curve \\mathcal{F}_n made of F_n segments. The curve displays three different aspects whether n is in the form 3k, 3k + 1, or 3k + 2\\. == Properties == The Fibonacci numbers in the Fibonacci word fractal. Some of the Fibonacci word fractal's properties include:Monnerot-Dumaine, Alexis (February 2009). \"The Fibonacci word fractal\", independent (hal.archives-ouvertes.fr). * The curve \\mathcal{F_n}, contains F_n segments, F_{n-1} right angles and F_{n-2} flat angles. * The curve never self-intersects and does not contain double points. At the limit, it contains an infinity of points asymptotically close. * The curve presents self-similarities at all scales. The reduction ratio is \\scriptstyle{1+\\sqrt{2}}. This number, also called the silver ratio is present in a great number of properties listed below. * The number of self- similarities at level n is a Fibonacci number \\ \u22121. (more precisely : F_{3n+3}-1). * The curve encloses an infinity of square structures of decreasing sizes in a ratio \\scriptstyle{1+\\sqrt{2}}. (see figure) The number of those square structures is a Fibonacci number. * The curve \\mathcal{F}_ncan also be constructed by different ways (see gallery below): ** Iterated function system of 4 and 1 homothety of ratio \\scriptstyle{1/(1+\\sqrt2)} and \\scriptstyle{1/(1+\\sqrt2)^2} ** By joining together the curves \\mathcal{F}_{n-1} and \\mathcal{F}_{n-2} ** Lindermayer system ** By an iterated construction of 8 square patterns around each square pattern. ** By an iterated construction of octagons * The Hausdorff dimension of the Fibonacci word fractal is \\scriptstyle{3\\frac{\\log\\varphi}{\\log(1+\\sqrt 2)}\\approx 1.6379}, with \\scriptstyle{\\varphi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}, the golden ratio. * Generalizing to an angle \\alpha between 0 and \\pi/2, its Hausdorff dimension is \\scriptstyle{3\\frac{\\log\\varphi}{\\log(1+a+\\sqrt{(1+a)^2+1})}}, with a=\\cos\\alpha. * The Hausdorff dimension of its frontier is \\scriptstyle{\\frac{\\log 3}{{\\log(1+\\sqrt 2})}\\approx 1.2465}. * Exchanging the roles of \"0\" and \"1\" in the Fibonacci word, or in the drawing rule yields a similar curve, but oriented 45\u00b0. * From the Fibonacci word, one can define the \u00ab dense Fibonacci word\u00bb, on an alphabet of 3 letters : 102210221102110211022102211021102110221022102211021... (). The usage, on this word, of a more simple drawing rule, defines an infinite set of variants of the curve, among which : ** a \"diagonal variant\" ** a \"svastika variant\" ** a \"compact variant\" * It is conjectured that the Fibonacci word fractal appears for every sturmian word for which the slope, written in continued fraction expansion, ends with an infinite series of \"1\". == Gallery == File:Fibonacci fractal F23 steps.png|Curve after \\textstyle{F_{23}} iterations.

The area of the central square tends to infinity. The juxtaposition of four F_{3k} curves allows the construction of a closed curve enclosing a surface whose area is not null. This curve is called a \"Fibonacci Tile\". * The Fibonacci tile almost tiles the plane. The juxtaposition of 4 tiles (see illustration) leaves at the center a free square whose area tends to zero as k tends to infinity. At the limit, the infinite Fibonacci tile tiles the plane. * If the tile is enclosed un{Clarification} a square of side 1, then its area tends to \\scriptstyle{2-\\sqrt{2} = 0.5857}.
