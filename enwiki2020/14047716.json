Powell, Buildings.com, October, 2002, retrieved November 3, 2007 Poor light can be divided into the following: *Individual or socio-cultural expectations *Insufficient light *Poor distribution of light *Improper contrast *Glare *Flicker *Thermal heating (over or under) *Acoustic noise (especially fluorescents) *Color spectrum (full-spectrum light, color temperature, etc.) ==Effects of poor light== The effects of poor light can include the following: *low productivity *high human error rates *inability to match or select correct colors *eyestrain *headache *a reduction in mental alertness *general malaise *low employee morale :{| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"height:35px\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Recommended Illumination LevelsIlluminating Engineering Society of North America.
