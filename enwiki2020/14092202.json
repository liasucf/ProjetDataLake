    "text": "The NJIT Highlanders, formerly the New Jersey Tech Highlanders, are the varsity sport members of the Division I NCAA-affiliated sports teams of New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). There are ten men's teams, seven women's teams, and three club teams along with a variety of intramural teams. The school's primary conference is the America East Conference. In November 2017 NJIT opened the Wellness and Events Center (WEC) which incorporates upgraded facilities for most Division 1 sports including a 3,500 seat arena for Basketball and Volleyball. ==Behind the Highlander name and logo== NJIT is located in an area of Newark presently known as University Heights, and formerly known as the Newark Highlands. In addition, NJIT's mailing address used to be High Street until the street was renamed in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. These various references to 'High' are, in large measure, what led the school's students to choose The Highlander as its mascot. Upon moving up to NCAA Division I in 2006 -07, NJIT athletics updated its graphics. This included a new logo which depicts a stylized Scottish Highlander warrior in traditional garb. == Sports sponsored == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- | Baseball || Basketball |- | Basketball || Cross country |- | Cross country || Soccer |- | Lacrosse || Tennis |- | Soccer || Track and field\u2020 |- | Swimming and diving || Volleyball |- | Tennis || |- | Track and field\u2020 || |- | Volleyball || |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"; text-align:center\" | Co-ed sports |- style=\"text- align:center\" | colspan=\"2\"| Fencing |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} A member of the America East Conference, NJIT sponsors teams in ten men's, seven women's, and one coed NCAA sanctioned sports. === Move to Division I === NJIT athletics moved to NCAA Division I, the top level of college athletics, in 2006. Prior to the reclassification of the athletic program, all teams competed at the Division II level. In the process of reclassification, both men's and women's soccer programs moved up to Division I faster than the other programs by taking advantage of a policy that allows lower division schools to elevate one sport in each gender to Division I in two years. NJIT men's soccer became a full member of NCAA Division I with championship eligibility at the start of the 2005 season. NJIT women's soccer began a similar two-year process in 2005, with full Division I status and championship eligibility arriving with the 2007 season. NJIT athletics officially gained across-the-board active membership in NCAA Division I, beginning September 1, 2009.'NJIT: NJIT Officially Gains Active NCAA Division I Membership' Men's lacrosse, which was elevated from club to full varsity status for the 2015 season (2014\u201315 school year), competed as an independent through the 2019 season, after which the team joined the Northeast Conference. ==Facilities== Estelle & Zoom Fleisher Athletic Center, the NJIT basketball teams also play at the Prudential Center in downtown Newark. The NJIT Cross-Country Teams practice at the nearby Branch Brook Park and Van Cortlandt Park in NYC. Branch Brook Park, located approximately a 1/2 mile away from campus is the home for NJIT Cross Country teams. The Estelle and Zoom Fleisher Athletic Center, was the former athletic facility for the NJIT Highlanders. The facility and adjoining field were demolished in 2016 to make way for the Wellness & Events Center and Lubetkin Field at Mal Simon Stadium. Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium was the former home of the NJIT Baseball team. The facility was demolished in 2019 to make way for a commercial-residential project named Riverfront Square. == Conference history == NJIT competed independently until 2009, when the Highlanders became a part of the Great West Conference in the summer of 2008 as one of six programs to form a Division I all-sports league that began full conference scheduling and championships in 2009\u201310. The Great West Conference was formerly a football-only league. Chicago State University joined the conference in October 2008 making the total full-sports members to 7. The newly expanded conference was not eligible for automatic Division I championship postseason qualification, men's basketball tournament champion was granted an automatic bid to CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT). During the 2012\u201313 basketball season, the NCAA underwent major changes in conference realignment where the WAC added three of five Great West schools, while Houston Baptist accepted an invitation to the Southland Conference. With only NJIT left, the conference folded. Although the Northeast Conference and Atlantic Sun Conference were discussed, it was not offered a spot in either for the 2013\u20132014 season. Some teams began competing as associate members in various conferences. The Men's volleyball team joined the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA). In 2013\u201314 the NJIT men's swimming and diving team began competing in the Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association (CCSA). In 2014 NJIT women's tennis became an associate member of the America East Conference and in 2014-15 NJIT men's soccer began play in the Sun Belt Conference. After two years as an independent, it was reported on June 11, 2015, that NJIT would finally be joining a conference, replacing Northern Kentucky in the Atlantic Sun Conference. On June 12, 2020, it was announced that NJIT would be leaving the ASUN for America East Conference == Club Sports == NJIT plays club-level ice hockey at the Prudential Center in the Colonial States College Hockey Conference. * Ice Hockey (affiliated conference : Colonial States College Hockey Conference (ACHA Division II club hockey)) * Bowling (reinstated in 2008\u20132009) == Recognitions == Men's Soccer In 1960, NJIT was NAIA co-champions with Elizabethtown College.

NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Recognitions for futility NJIT's Men's basketball program set the record of the most winless team in D-I history (see 2007\u201308 NJIT Highlanders men's basketball team) in the 2007\u20132008 season with a losing streak of 51 games, breaking Sacramento State\u2019s old D-I record. This acknowledgment has given NJIT's athletic program national recognition for futility. The unofficial NCAA record was set during its second NCAA Division I transitional season. It came despite a promising debut 5\u201324 Division 1 transitional season (2006\u20132007) whereby the rookie team won its first two matches (away and home).'NJIT Men's Basketball Team Media Guide' With a new head coach (Jim Engles), an entire new team of coaching staffs and additional new recruits, the NJIT Men's basketball team ended a 51-game losing streak on January 21, 2009, with a 61\u201351 win over the Bryant University Bulldogs ending the 2008\u20132009 season with a 1\u201330 record.
