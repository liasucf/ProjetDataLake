At the age of 17, Best was invited to train with the Knights' NRL squad. In late 2018, he played for the Australian Schoolboys and re-signed with the Knights on a 4-year contract until the end of 2022. ===2019=== In 2019, between injuries, Best split his time playing with the Knights' Jersey Flegg Cup team and Canterbury Cup NSW team. By August, he turned 18 and was therefore eligible to play NRL. Shortly after, he returned from a foot injury in the Jersey Flegg Cup, scoring three tries and being named man of the match. The following week, in Round 23, he made his NRL debut for the Knights in their 4-46 loss to the Wests Tigers at Campbelltown Stadium. In round 24, he scored his first NRL try in the Knights 38-4 win over the Gold Coast Titans at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle. === 2020 === Despite scoring two tries in Round 3 against the Penrith Panthers, Best failed to provide an assist to teammate Edrick Lee in the final stages of the match; which ended in a 14-14 draw. In response, Lee and Best practiced one-on-one passing in the lead-up to the Round 4 match against the Canberra Raiders. In the Round 4 match, Best scored another 2 tries and provided a try assist; which had Lee score the try in a similar scenario to the previous match. After the game, Best sparked instantaneous social media attention, controversially likened to other Australian athletes such as Don Bradman for his performance in the Knights' 34-18 win over the Raiders. ==References== ==External links== *Newcastle Knights profile Category:2001 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Newcastle Knights players Category:Rugby league centres Category:Rugby league fullbacks Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Living people ",
