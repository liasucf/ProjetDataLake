Toulouse won the Top 14 in 2001, defeating ASM Clermont Auvergne 34 to 22 in the final at Stade de France. Poitrenaud made his debut for France during 2001, and was part of the French side which defeated the Springboks 20 to 10 in Paris. He earned a further two international caps for France that year, playing in the subsequent victories over Australia in Marseille and Fiji in Saint-\u00c9tienne. Toulouse made it to the final of the 2002-03 Heineken Cup, and defeated USA Perpignan to win the cup. Toulouse were also finalists of the domestic competition, but were defeated by Stade Fran\u00e7ais. Poitrenaud returned to the national side in early 2003, to play in all of France's matches during the 2003 Six Nations Championship, which included losses to England and Ireland, with wins over Wales, Italy and Scotland.

Poitrenaud sustained a broken ankle during a match between Toulouse and Perpignan on Saturday 16 February.

This came only a few days after he was recalled to the French national team by Marc Lievremont. The general manager of Toulouse Guy Noves has made some controversial statements regarding Clement's injury, he has commented that, \"\"Clement's injury is not down to bad luck but because the players are becoming exhausted,\" \"Even if he didn't play in the Six Nations matches he still played the two championship games that took place at the same time.\". Poitrenaud played in his third victorious Heineken Cup Final in 2010 when Toulouse defeated Biarritz. ===Sharks=== After initially announcing his retirement after the 2015\u201316 season, Poitrenaud joined South African Super Rugby side the for the 2017 season. ==Trivia== * \"Poitrenaud\" is the gallicizing of peitrenaud, which means \"with his chest thrown out\" in the Occitan language. Poitrail indeed means \"chest\" / \"torso\" in French language. ==External links== * Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud on sporting-heroes.net * Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud on ercrugby.com * Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud on IMDb.com ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Castres Category:French rugby union players Category:Stade Toulousain players Category:Rugby union fullbacks Category:France international rugby union players Category:Sportspeople from Tarn (department) ",
