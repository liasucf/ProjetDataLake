    "text": "Union Pacific 6916 is a DDA40X diesel locomotive built for the Union Pacific Railroad. It now resides in the Eccles Rail Center at the Utah State Railroad Museum in Ogden, Utah. ==History== UP 6916 was built by the General Motors Electro-Motive Division in November 1969 as one of a series of 46 locomotives of the same type. It weighs 542,432 pounds and utilizes two Model 645E3A V-16 diesel engines, each rated at 3,300 horsepower, for a combined rating of 6,600 horsepower. Maximum speed was set at 80 miles per hour. By 22 June 1980, the 6916 was placed in storage due to a decrease in traffic. It was returned to service soon after, but by 1983, most of the DDA40X types were stored out of service in Yermo, California. In 1984, a motive power crunch caused Union Pacific to reinstate 25 of the locomotives, including the 6916. The locomotive was finally retired from service on 16 May 1985, and internally gutted as a parts source for SD40 and SD40-2 diesels. The unit was donated \"as is\" to the Utah State Railroad Museum in 1986. The DDA40X locomotive type was nicknamed \"Centennial\" after the 100th anniversary of the driving of the Golden Spike in 1869, which signified the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. They are unique in that they are actually two power units on a single 98-foot frame, and are noted as being the largest diesel locomotives in the world. The 6916 is one of thirteen surviving Centennials. ==In popular culture== *UP 6916 was featured on the cover of the March 1985 issue of Pacific RailNews. *The unit served as the prototype for an O-scale brass model released by Ajin and imported to the United States by Overland Models in 1999. ==Gallery== File:UP DDA40X 6900 DSCN0015.JPG|UP 6900, showing the split between the two operating units File:Union Pacific 6916 cab.JPG|The cab of the 6916 File:Union Pacific 6916 horn.JPG|Leslie type S3LR 3-chime air horn ==See also== *Union Pacific 6936 - another surviving DDA40X, and the sole operational unit. ==References== 6916 Category:D-D locomotives Category:Electro-Motive Division locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States ",
