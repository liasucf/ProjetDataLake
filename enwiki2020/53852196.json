He started his career as a techno producer and he became one of the most important artists of French electro. He focused more on hip-hop after working with Kanye West in 2013 and then after releasing his debut album Brava in 2014. ==Early life and career== Brodinski was born in Reims, France. He founded the label Bromance with his manager Manu Barron. The label's debut release was Brodinski's collaboration with fellow French producer Gesaffelstein, which provided an opportunity for Brodinski to work with Kanye West for his album, Yeezus. Brodinski produced two songs \u2014 \"Send It Up\" and \"Black Skinhead\" \u2014 from the album, which inspired him to work in hip hop music. He began collaborating with artists such as Danny Brown, Suicideyear and Kaytranada. Brodinski collaborated with Theophilus London on the latter's 2014 studio album Vibes, in which he was credited on three songs. He has also released a song with London via the Bromance label, titled \"Gimme Back the Night\". His debut studio album, Brava, was released in 2015 via Parlophone and Warner Music France. He co-composed the album with Myd and Kore. Spending much of 2016 in Atlanta, Brodinski worked with hip hop recording artists such as 21 Savage to release the mixtape Sour Patch Kid, following by another mixtape released in November that year, Young Slime Season. In 2017, he decided, with Manu Barron, to end the Bromance label. In 2018, Brodinski worked with Atlanta rapper Hoodrich Pablo Juan to release a collaborative project titled The Matrix, which is an extended play consisting of seven songs. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| FRA ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| BEL |- ! scope=\"row\"| Brava | * Released: 27 February 2015 * Label: Parlophone, Warner * Format: Digital download, CD | 84 || 75 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Evil World | * Released: 24 October 2019 * Label: Cinematic Music Group * Format: Digital download | - || - |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| FRA ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| BEL Tip |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Let the Beat Control Your Body\" | 2011 | 88 || \u2014 | Bromance #1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Nobody Rules the Streets\" | 2012 | 182 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Can't Help Myself\" | 2014 | \u2014 || 39 |Brava |} ==References== Category:French DJs Category:Living people Category:French electronic musicians Category:People from Reims Category:Electronic dance music DJs Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
