It is owned by Hongkong Land Limited, a subsidiary of Jardines. At the time of its completion in 1972, Jardine House was the tallest building in Hong Kong and in Asia. In 1980, the Hopewell Centre usurped the title of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The building is interconnected by the Central Elevated Walkway with buildings of Hongkong Land Limited like Exchange Square and the International Finance Centre. ==History== 1st generation Jardine House in the 1900s. 2nd generation Jardine House in the 1930s. ===Previous Jardine Houses=== The first three generations of Jardine Houses were situated at 20 Pedder Street, at the corner of Des Voeux Road Central. The first Jardine House was probably built around 1841 after Jardine's successful bid for its lots on The Praya Central. In 1908, the second Jardine House was built. It was rebuilt in around 1956 as a 16-storey building.gwulo.com: Jardine House (3rd generation) [1957\u20131980] The building was sold by Jardines during the land acquisition exercise of the Landmark complex in Central and 20 Pedder Street is now occupied by the Wheelock House. ===New Jardine House=== Jardine House (first building from the right) is located in the central business district on Hong Kong Island, next to (from left to right) the BOC Tower, Cheung Kong Center and the HSBC Building. The new building was constructed on a piece of reclaimed land, under a lease term of 75 years, which was secured by Hongkong Land Limited at a record price of HK$258 million in 1970, payable interest free over a period of 10 years. In exchange, the Government agreed that no building directly to the north of Jardine House would ever be built to obstruct its views. As a result, the height of General Post Office building was capped at . Building costs were estimated at $120 million. Construction of the fifty-two-storey building took 16 months. Metal lettering from the Old Jardine House was salvaged and used in the lobby of the New Jardine House. == Design == The building is constructed with a metal frame, and a curtain wall with round windows. The thickness of the structural frame is reduced because of the shape of the windows. Unusually for a Jardine property, elevators were produced by Otis Elevator, while escalators were manufactured by Schindler Elevator. The circular design of the windows has earned the building the nickname, \"The House of a Thousand Arseholes.\" ==Tenants== As of August 2019, notable tenants of the building include the following: * Appleby * Ashurst * British Airways * Clifford Chance * Dentons * Dechert * Norton Rose Fulbright * Slaughter and May * Watson Farley & Williams * Zhong Lun Law Firm ==In popular culture== Jardine House was prominently displayed in the 1988 NBC television miniseries Noble House as the headquarters for Struan's in a subtle nod to James Clavell using Jardines as a model for Struan's. It also appeared in establishing shots in The Amsterdam Kill and The Mighty Peking Man (1977). The building was also featured in the 1978 episode titled \"The Chinese Web\" of The Amazing Spider Man TV series. ==Gallery== File:Jardine House seen from IFC2.jpg|Jardine House seen from IFC2 File:Jardine House taken from the Pedestrian bridge skywalk entrance.jpg|Taken from the Pedestrian bridge skywalk at Central/IFC File:HK Central Jardine House C1.JPG|Jardine House, 2007 File:HK Statue Square Xmas Tree Mandarin Oriental Hotel.JPG|The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Jardine House and IFC2 seen from Statue Square, 2006 File:HK Jardine House Lift Lobby.jpg|Jardine House lift lobby in Ground Floor ==See also== * Timeline of tallest buildings in Hong Kong ==References== == External links == *Jardine House, Hong Kong Land website *Pictures of Jardine House at skyscraperphotos.com *Gwulo entry with details about the early Jardine Houses Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Hong Kong Category:Central, Hong Kong Category:Hongkong Land Category:A Symphony of Lights Category:Office buildings completed in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Hong Kong ",
