He emigrated to South Australia aboard Moffatt in August 1839, and shortly entered into partnership with coachbuilder John Green Coulls (c. 1812 \u2013 9 September 1881), who arrived aboard Java in February 1840. They had some part in the construction of John Ridley's first stripper. In September 1845 Gurr left Coulls's Hindley Street business (which became one of the largest in the colony) and opened an iron and coal yard in Currie Street, which prospered. Jean Ogilvie (1 September 1808 \u2013 27 May 1903) arrived aboard Symmetry in February 1844; they married on 25 July 1845. :Jean's brother Alexander Ogilvie (c. 1810 \u2013 10 October 1884) arrived November 1849 aboard Duke of Wellington with his (second) wife Isabella (died 1856) and four children (by his first wife). Alexander married once more, to Janet Brown (died 1895) in 1859. Some time before 1862 he started working in a managerial capacity at his brother-in-law's store, and was still there in 1871. He was a foundation member of Zion Chapel, Pulteney street and a generous contributor to the Adelaide City Mission, the Royal Institution for the Blind, and the Blind and Deaf and Dumb Institution, Brighton. In 1903 he established the Jean Cottage Homes, a charitable settlement consisting of three-room homes for elderly couples in Jean Street, Elgin (today's Woodville Park), The location of this Jean Street is yet to be ascertained; it is not Jean Street, Woodville West, as that cannot be described as \"two minutes' walk from Kilkenny Railway Station\" named for his wife's birthplace, and where he owned considerable property. He died at his home on Gurrs Road (to this day a major thoroughfare), Kensington after two years as a near-invalid. Their son John Henry Gurr (31 October 1846 \u2013 17 October 1918) was born in Adelaide, and was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution (as was his ex- partner's son Joseph Coull). He joined his father's business, and subsequently worked as a land agent and invested in mining shares. He was associated with the Glenelg Congregational Church. ==Family== Joshua Gurr (11 March 1819 \u2013 9 November 1910) married Jean Ogilvie (1 September 1808 \u2013 27 May 1903) of Elgin, Scotland, on 25 July 1845.
