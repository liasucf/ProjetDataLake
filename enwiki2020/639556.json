After leaving Romania in 1973, he settled in Switzerland. He studied mathematics and computer science in Z\u00fcrich, receiving a Ph.D. from ETH Z\u00fcrich in 1997.Campbell 2002 His Ph.D. thesis, titled Cyclotomy of rings and primality testing,Mih\u0103ilescu 1997. was written under the direction of Erwin Engeler and Hendrik Lenstra. For several years, he did research at the University of Paderborn, Germany. Since 2005, he has held a professorship at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. ==Major research== In 2002, Mih\u0103ilescu proved Catalan's conjecture.Mets\u00e4nkyl\u00e4 2004.Schoof 2008.Bilu et al. 2014. This number- theoretical conjecture, formulated by the French and Belgian mathematician Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan in 1844, had stood unresolved for 158 years.
