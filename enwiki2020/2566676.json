Identification of low caries risk dietary components in: \u201cMonographs in Oral Science\u201d. Vol. 11: 1-198. Myers H.M. (ed.), Karger, Basel. To replace sugar, toothfriendly products often contain sweeteners (polyols, intense sweeteners) that are not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. Products that are certified as toothfriendly also do not contain excessive amounts of food acids. In 1983, a WHO working group recommended that the consumption of non-cariogenic \"toothfriendly\" confectionery should be encouraged.WHO, World Health Organization Technical Report Series, Geneva, 1984, no 713, p.19. To provide consumers with easy guidance to toothfriendly products, the Swiss University dental schools decided in the early 1980s to launch a new public information campaign on nutrition and oral health. Instead of advising against the consumption of sweets, the new campaign took a different approach. The basic idea was that consumers should be educated and encouraged to eat only confectionery products that would not harm their teeth.T.Imfeld and B.Guggenheim (1991) Sugarless - the Way Forward. A.J. Rugg-Gunn (ed.), Elsevier Applied Science, London 1991, p. 197. Toothfriendly (\"Happy Tooth\") label was created. This registered trademark distinguishes products (confectionery, beverage, sweeteners, medicine) that have been proven in a scientific test to lack both significant cariogenic and erosive potential.De Paola D.P. (1986). Executive summary. Proceedings of scientific consensus conference on methods for assessment of the cariogenic potential of foods. J. Dent. Res. 65 (Spec. Iss.): 1540-1543. The \"toothfriendliness\" of a product is tested by means of intraoral pH telemetry. Applying a standardized method, the plaque pH is measured at least in four volunteers during and for 30 minutes after consumption of the product with an indwelling, interproximally-placed, plaque-covered electrode. Products that do not lower plaque pH below 5.7, under the conditions of this test, lack a cariogenic potential. The erosive potential is measured with a plaque-free electrode. The acid exposure of the teeth must not exceed 40 micromol H min.Firestone A.R., Imfeld T., Schiffer S. and Lutz F. (1987).

Some examples of toothfriendly sweeteners are: sorbitol, maltitol, isomalt, xylitol, sucralose, stevia, isomaltulose, tagatose, mogroside, and erythritol.International Dental Federation (FDI) (2000).

Americal Journal of Clinical Nutrition; 78 (suppl) 881S-92S. Toothfriendly International certifies products that have been tested and proven to be safe for teeth. It is a non-profit association established in 1989 in Basel, Switzerland. Since then, the association has been granting the rights for the Toothfriendly label to distinguish products that are not harmful for teeth. The members of the organization are dentists, dental and public health institutions, confectionery and oral care manufacturers. The Toothfriendly Foundation is the charitable arm of the association. The Foundation is responsible for caries prevention projects in less-developed countries. ==References== ==External links== * Toothfriendly.org Category:Dentistry Category:Confectionery ",
