    "text": "Contrapuntal Forms, in Harlow in 2016 Contrapuntal Forms (BH 165) is a stone sculpture by Barbara Hepworth, one of her first public commissions, made in 1950\u201351 for the Festival of Britain and installed outside the Dome of Discovery on South Bank, London. It was one of two Hepworth commissions for the festival: the other was an abstract rotating sculpture, Turning Forms (BH 166). The work stands 120\" (3.04m) high and is carved from blue limestone from County Galway, Ireland. It depicts two semi-abstracted standing figures. The sculpture was commissioned by the Arts Council of Great Britain who presented it to the new town of Harlow in Essex in 1953. It was the first artwork acquired (though not the first commissioned) by the Harlow Arts Trust, and it is still sited at Glebelands in Harlow. The sculpture was awarded Grade II listed building status in April 1998. ==References== * Contrapuntal Forms, barbarahepworth.org.uk * Contrapuntal Forms, barbarahepworth.org.uk * Contrapuntal Forms by Barbara Hepworth, visitharlow.com Category:1950 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Harlow Category:Festival of Britain Category:Sculptures by Barbara Hepworth Category:Limestone sculptures in the United Kingdom ",
