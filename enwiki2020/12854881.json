Flora of China. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 1936 by Tsin Tang and Fa Tsuan Wang, as Amitostigma bifoliatum. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of Amitostigma, Neottianthe and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Amitostigma and Neottianthe were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis bifoliata. == References == Category:Endemic orchids of China bifoliata Category:Endangered plants Category:Flora of Gansu Category:Orchids of Sichuan Category:Plants described in 1936 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
