    "text": "Mark Anthony McKee (born 1 December 1998) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for NIFL Premiership Cliftonville. McKee began his career at Cliftonville before signing a scholarship with English League Two club Stevenage in 2015. He broke into the Stevenage first-team during the 2016\u201317 season. McKee spent four years at Stevenage before being released by the club at the end of the 2018\u201319 season. He has also represented Northern Ireland at U17 and U19 level. McKee rejoined Cliftonville in October 2019. ==Club career== ===Early career=== McKee began his career on schoolboy terms with NIFL Premiership club Cliftonville, before signing for Stevenage for an undisclosed fee in the summer of 2015. The move came about after he had impressed then-Stevenage coach Darren Sarll who was watching a Northern Ireland U16s match in Belfast. Sarll was there to finalise the signing of Nathan Kerr, but also ended up enquiring about McKee joining Stevenage on scholarship terms. ===Stevenage=== He played in a number of Stevenage's pre- season friendlies ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, and subsequently signed his first professional contract in August 2016. He continued to feature predominantly for the club's U18 side during the campaign, and signed \"an extended deal\" with the Hertfordshire club in February 2017. McKee made his professional debut in April 2017, coming on as a 71st minute substitute in a 4\u20130 away loss to Colchester United. After the match, he was singled out for praise by Sarll, now the club's manager, who stated \"Mark can be anything he wants. He can be the best one we have ever blooded. In all the years back, even extending back to George Boyd, this boy can be a very good player\". Two weeks later, on 22 April 2017, he made his first starting appearance, playing the opening 55 minutes as Stevenage fell to a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at Broadhall Way. Following on from his two appearances in the first-team the previous season, McKee opened the 2017\u201318 season with a place in the starting line-up, playing as a striker in Stevenage's 3\u20133 draw against Newport County on the opening day of the campaign. He made a sporadic number of appearances in the first three months of the campaign without cementing his place in the first-team. This changed after he was deployed in a midfield role in Stevenage's 1\u20131 home draw against Coventry City on 21 November 2017, earning Man of the Match for his performance and also being described as possessing \"the most amazing awareness and intelligence to his play\" by manager Sarll after the match. Stevenage chairman Phil Wallace stated there had been interest from a number of Championship and Premier League clubs for McKee during the 2018 January transfer window, with the club discouraging bids for the player as they believe he will develop faster playing first-team football as opposed to \"being lost in the U23 environment of a Premier League club\". McKee scored his first professional goal on 3 February 2018, courtesy of a low drilled shot in a 3\u20132 defeat at Accrington Stanley. He made 29 appearances during the campaign, scoring once, in what was McKee's breakthrough season as a first-team regular. Despite appearing regularly for Stevenage the previous campaign, McKee played just once during the first half of the 2018\u201319 season. He returned to the first-team as a 79th-minute substitute in a 1\u20130 home loss to Bury on 9 March 2019. McKee ended the season coming on as a substitute in Stevenage's last four matches as the club finished in tenth position in League Two, one point off of the play-off places. He made eight appearances during the season. McKee was released by Stevenage at the end of the season. ===Cliftonville=== McKee rejoined his former academy club Cliftonville on 10 October 2019. ==International career== Having featured regularly for Northern Ireland's U17 side for two years, McKee was then called up to the Northern Ireland U19 side in October 2016 for their three 2017 UEFA European U19 Championship qualification group matches. He featured in all three matches, scoring once. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Stevenage |2016\u201317 |League Two |2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |2017\u201318 |League Two |24||1||3||0||1||0||1Appearance(s) in the EFL Trophy||0||29||1 |- |2018\u201319 |League Two |7||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||8||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !33||1||3||0||1||0||2||0||39||1 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:Cliftonville F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
