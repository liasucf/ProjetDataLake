    "text": "Setchelliogaster is a genus of fungi in the order Agaricales. It is incertae sedis with respect to familial placement within the order, although Kirk and colleagues (Dictionary of the Fungi, 10th edition, 2008) consider it likely aligned with either the Bolbitiaceae or the Cortinariaceae. The genus is widespread in warm, dry areas, and contains five species. It was circumscribed by Czech mycologist Zden\u011bk Pouzar in 1958.https://species.nbnatlas.org/species/BMSSYS0000051172 ==References== Category:Agaricales incertae sedis Category:Secotioid fungi Category:Agaricales genera ",
