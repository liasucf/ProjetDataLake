The Germans built a defensive complex of trenches, dugouts and bunkers on the slightly elevated landscape, from which artillery observers had an excellent view of the ground around Wijtschate and Ypres. The location was called Bayernwald by German soldiers due to the fact that the first German soldiers to be stationed there were from Bavaria (\"Bayern\" in German). The area was the site of extensive mining activity by both German and British units during the war. Before the Battle of Messines, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers placed a large mine around the German strongpoint G\u00fcnther, not far from the Bayernwald trenches. It consisted of three chambers (Hollandscheschur Farm 1, 2, 3) which were loaded with a combined charge of of ammonal. The mine was fired on 7 June 1917 as part of the Mines in the Battle of Messines. == Croonaert today == Currently, Croonaert Wood is a deciduous forest containing the Bayernwald Trenches memorial site. ==See also== * == Links and references == *Bayernwald Museum and During WW1 Category:Forests of Belgium Category:Ypres Salient ",
