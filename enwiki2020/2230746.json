He was a member of the Conservative Party of Nicaragua. He is now remembered especially for having thwarted the request of the young Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, later to become one of the most well-known Spanish- language poets, for a government scholarship to study in Europe. In 1882 Dar\u00edo, then 15 years old, read some of his poetry to a group including the President - whereupon Zavala reportedly reproved him: \"My son, if you so write against the religion of your fathers and their homeland now, what will become of you if you go to Europe and learn worse things?\"Humberto C. Garza, Biograf\u00eda de Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, los-poetas.com. Accessed online 7 March 2007. \"Hijo m\u00edo, si asi escribes ahora contra la religi\u00f3n de tus padres y de tu patria, que ser\u00e1 si te vas a Europa a aprender cosas peores?\" ==References== Category:1835 births Category:1906 deaths Category:People from Managua Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Conservative Party (Nicaragua) politicians Category:19th-century Nicaraguan people ",
