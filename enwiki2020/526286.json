The brewery also makes a helles which, while the grain used is unsmoked, is still smoky in flavor because the same kettles and yeast are used to produce it and the Rauchbier. A schnapps made from Rauchbier is also available in Schlenkerla's pub and restaurant. ==The pub== The brewery has been in operation since 1405, when it was a pub known as Zum Blauen L\u00f6wen (\"At the Blue Lion\"). Schlenkerla tavern features a Gothic ceiling known as the Dominikanerklause. ==Name== Schlenkerla roughly translates as \"Dangling\". Schlenkern is a German verb meaning to swing or to dangle. The -la suffix is typical of the East Franconian dialect. The name reportedly comes from a brewer with a hobbling gait whose image can be seen on the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier bottle. The brewery's legal name is HellerBr\u00e4u Trum KG, after the Trum family that has owned and run it for six generations. ==See also== * List of smoked foods * * ==References== ==External links== *Brauereiausschank Schlenkerla - official website of the Schlenkerla historical brewery and tavern *bamberger-bier.de - information about Bamberg's brewing tradition *Photo Sphere of Brewpub Category:Buildings and structures in Bamberg Category:Beer and breweries in Bavaria Category:Drinking establishments in Germany Category:German beer culture Category:Companies established in the 15th century Category:1405 establishments Category:Organizations established in the 1400s ",
