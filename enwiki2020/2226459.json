It has an important port, situated along the route connecting Suez to Gibraltar, one of the busiest maritime corridors in the world.Success for Gioia Tauro, undated ADN Kronos report on Italtrade ==History== Gioia Tauro has been continuously inhabited for more than 2500 years. From about 400 BC or so it was inhabited by Greek colonists who called it Matauros or Metauros (). Solinus write that it was established by Greeks from the Zancle.Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.10 It was one of the smaller ancient Greek centers among the settlements in Southern Italy (Magna Graecia). The ancient poet Stesichorus is said to have been born there. The remains are a little further inland in the old town of Gioia Tauro on a rise overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea.VisitsItaly.com - Welcome to Gioia Tauro, Calabria In the 1970s, Gioia Tauro was the main centre for industrial development in Southern Italy, following a burst of violence in Reggio Calabria in 1970, signaling frustration over the central government's neglect of the region. The construction of a large steel plant and port facility was meant to bring income and jobs to Calabria. Until then Gioia Tauro had been a productive and beautiful agricultural area. Profitable farms and olive groves were expropriated and demolished. The 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type criminal organisation based in Calabria, and in particular the Piromalli clan, exploited the construction of the steelworks until the project was abandoned in 1979, when the crisis in the steel industry could no longer be ignored and the government decided there was no economic basis for it. In the meantime some 1,000 people were killed in conflicts over construction contracts. For a while the homicide rate of Gioia Tauro, was higher than that of New York City.Spotts & Wieser, Italy, a Difficult Democracy, p. 186 Following this, a proposed electrical energy power station was never built, due to environmental problems. Gioia Tauro became an example of the failure that characterized much of the development of Italy's South as \"industrialisation without development.\"Spotts & Wieser, Italy, a Difficult Democracy, p. 236 ==Gioia Tauro seaport== The seaport has seven loading docks with an extension of ; it is the largest in Italy and the seventh-largest container port in Europe, with a 2007 throughput of s from more than 3,000 ships. In 2018 the port was in eighth place for EU container traffic, on a higher throughput of In 2002 more than one-third of national traffic went through the seaport; it specializes in transshipment activities, replacing the port of Malta as the node for overseas traffic to and from the US and the Far East. The Medcenter Container Terminal (Medcenter, Contship) is the main operator working in the port. ==='Ndrangheta control of port=== According to a 2006 report, Italian investigators estimate that 80% of Europe's cocaine arrives from Colombia via Gioia Tauro's docks. The port is also involved in the illegal arms trade. These activities are controlled by the 'Ndrangheta.Bitter harvest, The Guardian, December 19, 2006 In 2014 the US FBI and the Italian police made arrests in a joint operation aimed at smashing a new trafficking route for drugs and weapons that officials said had brought together the Gambino crime family of New York and the 'Ndrangheta. It was alleged that representatives of the criminal organisations discussed plans to ship cocaine and heroin from Gioia Tauro to the United States, selling more than of heroin to an FBI undercover agent, thinking it would be distributed across the United States. A mafia expert said that the US mafia understood that the Sicilian Cosa Nostra had been so weakened that it allowed the 'Ndrangheta to rise.Guardian newspaper:Police break transatlantic network of US and Italian crime families, 1 February 2014 \u201cIn the 1970s, the Christian Democratic Italian Government (with the active encouragement of the left) appropriated (and wasted) tens of billions of dollars to build one of the country\u2019s largest steel plants in Calabria, but the project was abandoned because of a crisis in the steel industry.... \u201cThe government ultimately completed construction of a huge seaport at Gioia Tauro (the sixth largest in the Mediterranean) which was originally meant to service the steel plant....[Alex] Perry [in his book, \u201cThe Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World\u2019s Most Powerful Mafia,\u201d William Morrow publishers, 2018] notes that \u2018the railway that connected Gioia Tauro to Europe stopped 1.5 kilometers short of the port, meaning all the cargo\u2019 \u2014 legal and illegal \u2014 \u2018from one of the biggest Mediterranean container ports had to be loaded onto mafia-owned trucks and driven three minutes to the station.\u2019 The port\u2019s legitimate business has struggled in recent years, no doubt a result of Mafia control.\u201d \u201cBreaking the Silence in Calabria,\u201d Alexander Stille, The New York Review of Books, Vol. LXVI, No. 16 (October 24, 2019) The Piromalli-Mol\u00e8 clan managed to condition the management of the new container terminal. Established in the mid-1990s, it became the largest terminal in the Mediterranean, moving over 2 million containers in 1998. Since 1994, when Contship Italia rented the port area to start transshipment activity and the Medcenter Container Terminal was set up thanks to 138 billion lire (about US$86 million) in state financing, the Piromallis aimed to oblige the Medcenter company, through its vice president Walter Lugli, and the Contship company, through its president Enrico Ravano, to pay a kickback of US$1.50 for each transshipped container, about half of the net profits earned by the two companies.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 218 Il caso Gioia Tauro, Relazione sullo stato della lotta alla criminalit\u00e0 organizzata in Calabria, Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul fenomeno della mafia e delle altre associazioni criminali similari, July 2000 In February 2008 the parliamentary Antimafia Commission concluded that the 'Ndrangheta \"controls or influences a large part of the economic activity around the port and uses the facility as a base for illegal trafficking.\" In its report it said that \"the entire gamma of internal or sub-contracted activities is mafia-influenced, from the management of distribution and forwarding to customs control and container storage.\" The extortion of Ravano and Contship was part of a project that \"did not involve simply this security tax, which grew with the port, but also control of activities tied to the port, the hiring of workers, and relations with port unions and local institutions\". \"It effectively eliminated legitimate competition from companies not influenced or controlled by the mafia in providing goods and services, performing construction work and hiring personnel. And it threw a shadow over the behaviour of local government and other public bodies.\"Gioia Tauro 'controlled by mafia for over a decade', Lloyd\u2019s List, February 21, 2008 Relazione annuale sulla 'ndrangheta, Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sul fenomeno della criminalit\u00e0 organizzata mafiosa o similare (Relatore: Francesco Forgione), February 2008 =='Ndrangheta infiltration of city council== The city council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved in 1991 because of infiltration by the 'Ndrangheta. In April 2008, it was dissolved for the second time for the same reason. Sciolto Consiglio comunale di Gioia Tauro, Corriere della Sera, April 22, 2008 The town is home to several 'ndrine, such as the Alvaro, Mammoliti, Mol\u00e8, and Piromalli families. Gioia Tauro's former mayor and deputy mayor, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, were arrested on mafia charges on October 13, 2008. Both had been forced to step down in April, when the city council was dissolved on suspicion of mafia infiltration. 'Ndrangheta boss Gioacchino Piromalli was arrested as well, along with his nephew, also named Gioacchino Piromalli, who is a lawyer. The mayors were accused of employing the younger Piromalli. Police believe the legal work was a front to enable the Piromallis to regain a slice of the business generated by the port of Gioia Tauro.Mayors, mobsters in 'Ndrangheta op, ANSA, October 13, 2008 ==Notable people== * Stesichorus \u2013 ancient poet * Nick Nostro \u2013 film director ==Winds== * Sirocco, a hot, dry wind originating in Sahara Desert (southeasterly) * Libeccio, very dangerous for shippers (to be avoided; southwesterly) * Mistral (Ponente), the predominant and quiet wind (northwesterly) == Demographic evolution == Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.8) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.8) ImageSize = width:500 height:400 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:50 top:30 right:30 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:20000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:5000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:1861 text:1861 bar:1871 text:1871 bar:1881 text:1881 bar:1901 text:1901 bar:1911 text:1911 bar:1921 text:1921 bar:1931 text:1931 bar:1936 text:1936 bar:1951 text:1951 bar:1961 text:1961 bar:1971 text:1971 bar:1981 text:1981 bar:1991 text:1991 bar:2001 text:2001 bar:2008 text:2008 PlotData= color:barra width:20 align:left bar:1861 from: 0 till:1364 bar:1871 from: 0 till:1754 bar:1881 from: 0 till:3174 bar:1901 from: 0 till:5764 bar:1911 from: 0 till:7208 bar:1921 from: 0 till:8289 bar:1931 from: 0 till:9465 bar:1936 from: 0 till:10811 bar:1951 from: 0 till:13894 bar:1961 from: 0 till:13912 bar:1971 from: 0 till:15016 bar:1981 from: 0 till:17488 bar:1991 from: 0 till:18484 bar:2001 from: 0 till:17762 bar:2008 from: 0 till:18367 PlotData= bar:1861 at:1364 fontsize:XS text:1,364 shift:(-8,5) bar:1871 at:1754 fontsize:XS text:1,754 shift:(-8,5) bar:1881 at:3174 fontsize:XS text:3,174 shift:(-8,5) bar:1901 at:5764 fontsize:XS text:5,764 shift:(-8,5) bar:1911 at:7208 fontsize:XS text:7,208 shift:(-8,5) bar:1921 at:8289 fontsize:XS text:8,289 shift:(-8,5) bar:1931 at:9465 fontsize:XS text:9,465 shift:(-8,5) bar:1936 at:10811 fontsize:XS text:10,811 shift:(-8,5) bar:1951 at:13894 fontsize:XS text:13,894 shift:(-8,5) bar:1961 at:13912 fontsize:XS text:13,912 shift:(-8,5) bar:1971 at:15016 fontsize:XS text:15,016 shift:(-8,5) bar:1981 at:17488 fontsize:XS text:17,488 shift:(-8,5) bar:1991 at:18484 fontsize:XS text:18,484 shift:(-8,5) bar:2001 at:17762 fontsize:XS text:17,762 shift:(-8,5) bar:2008 at:18367 fontsize:XS text:18,367 shift:(-8,5) TextData= fontsize:S pos:(20,20) text:Data from ISTAT ==References== * Paoli, Letizia (2003).
