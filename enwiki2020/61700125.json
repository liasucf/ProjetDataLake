    "text": "The Orgasmatron Tour was a concert tour played by the heavy metal band Mot\u00f6rhead in support of their album, Orgasmatron. It would be the final tour with Pete Gill, as he would be fired in 1987 and replaced with Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor for the remainder of the tour. == Overview == Originally the band was planning on having a life sized replica of the train from cover of Orgasmatron, akin to the Bomber rig and the Iron Fist prop. In his biography White Line Fever, Lemmy described how it worked: During the band North American leg in 1986 Lemmy recalls it \"not being our most stellar tour\". Megadeth opened for a few dates but were dropped due to frustrations with their manger. During their show in Chalmette, Louisiana the band cut their set short due to the crowd continuously spitting on the band, which resulted in a riot. In 1987, Mot\u00f6rhead appeared in the Peter Richardson film Eat the Rich. As the band was about to film their cameo, however, drummer Pete Gill was fired and Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor rejoined after having quit in 1984. Gill tried to downplay his firing saying in The Hard Report that his departure was \"by mutual agreement. I left for business reasons, not musical or personal. There has been no great rift.\" Lemmy adds that he knew Taylor, who had been playing with Frankie Miller and ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian \"Robbo\" Robertson, wanted to come back. Phil would go on to finish the last remaining dates of the tour. ==Personnel== *Lemmy Kilmister \u2013 bass guitar, vocals *Phil \"Wizz\u00f6\" Campbell \u2013 guitar *Michael \"W\u00fcrzel\" Burston \u2013 guitar *Pete Gill \u2013 drums (26 March 1986 - 10 February 1987) *Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor (5 March 1987 \u2013 28 April 1987) ==Setlist== # \"Iron Fist\" # \"Stay Clean\" # \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" # \"Metropolis\" # \"Doctor Rock\" # \"Killed By Death\" # \"Ace of Spades\" # \"Deaf Forever\" # \"Steal Your Face\" # \"Ain't My Crime\" (Added in 1987) # \"Bite the Bullet\" # \"Built for Speed\" # \"No Class\" # \"Orgasmatron\" # \"Motorhead\" Encore: # * \"Bomber\" (played on occasions) # \"Overkill\" ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !width=\"150\"|Date !width=\"150\"|City !width=\"125\"|Country !width=\"225\"|Venue !width=\"150\"|Support Act(s) |- !colspan=\"5\"|Leg 1 \u2014 \"Easter Metal Blast\" |- |26 March 1986 |Villingen-Schwenningen | Germany |Messenhalle | rowspan=\"3\" |Exciter Manowar |- |27 March 1986 |Wettingen |Switzerland |Sporthalle Tagerhard |- |29 March 1986 |Osnabr\u00fcck |rowspan=\"3\"| Germany |Sporthalle Tagerhard |- |30 March 1986 |Dortmund |Westfalenhallen 3 |Exciter Manowar L\u0227\u0227z Rockit Railway |- |31 March 1986 |Aschaffenburg |Hochberghalle | rowspan=\"3\" |Exciter Manowar |- |1 April 1986 |Kaatsheuvel |Netherlands |De Kegelaar (Earthquake Festival) |- |3 April 1986 |Copenhagen |Denmark |Saga Cinema |- !colspan=\"5\"|Leg 2 \u2014 Europe |- |23 June 1986 |Bologna |rowspan=\"2\"|Italy |Unipol Arena (HM Festival) | |- |24 June 1986 |Milan |Teatro Tenda di Lampugnano |Twisted Sister Girlschool |- |16 August 1986 |Castle Donington |England |Donington Park (Monsters of Rock) | |- ! colspan=\"5\" |Leg 3 \u2014 \"Eight Days In June\" |- |14 September 1986 |Southampton | rowspan=\"3\" |England |Mayfair Suite | |- |15 September 1986 |Birmingham |Birmingham Odeon |rowspan=\"5\"|Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction |- |16 September 1986 |Newcastle |Newcastle City Hall |- |17 September 1986 |Edinburgh |Scotland |Edinburgh Playhouse |- |18 September 1986 |Bradford | rowspan=\"2\" |England |St George's Hall |- |20 September 1986 |Manchester |Manchester Apollo |- |21 September 1986 |Cardiff |Wales |St David's Hall | |- |22 September 1986 |London | rowspan=\"2\" |England |Hammersmith Odeon |rowspan=\"2\"|Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction |- |23 September 1986 |Nottingham |Nottingham Royal Concert Hall |- !colspan=\"5\"|Leg 3 \u2014 North America |- |10 October 1986 |Oakland |rowspan=\"22\"|United States |Henry J.
