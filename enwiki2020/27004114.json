Cyrenaica is the eastern coastal region of Libya and also an ex-province or state (\"muhafazah\" or \"wilayah\") of the country (alongside Tripolitania and Fezzan) in the pre-1963 administrative system. What used to be Cyrenaica in the old system is now divided up into several \"shabiyat\" (see administrative divisions in Libya). In addition to the coastal region, i.e. historical Cyrenaica, the former province, during the Kingdom and the Italian era extended to the south to include the entire eastern section of the country. == Italian post office in Benghazi == A 1930 stamp of Cyrenaica while it was an Italian colony.
