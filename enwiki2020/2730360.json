    "text": "Claude Brossette, seigneur de Varennes d'Appetour (November 7, 1671, Theiz\u00e9, Lyonnais - 1743) was a French lawyer and writer. He was educated at the Coll\u00e8ge de la Trinit\u00e9 in Lyon and joined the Jesuits before turning to law. In 1700 he founded the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Lyon, where he remained a bibliothecarian until 1743, and whose secretary he was appointed in 1724. Brossette was a man of far-reaching connections, exchanging letters with Academy President Bouhier, Abbot Olivet and Father Vani\u00e8re from Toulouse. Between 1699 and 1710 he was a regular correspondent of Paris poet and satirist Boileau, whose works he edited with commentaries. Their correspondence was published in 1770 by Fran\u00e7ois Louis Cizeron Rival. He was acquainted with Fran\u00e7ois de Lamoignon and Bernard de La Monnoye from the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, and with Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. Later his reach widened; he exchanged point of views with Voltaire, Louis Racine, Abbot Lenglet- Dufresnoy, D\u00e9on, and Father Brumoy. ==Works== *Histoire Abr\u00e9g\u00e9e ou \u00e9loge historique de la ville de Lyon, 1711 *Editions of Boileau, Moli\u00e8re ==Notes and references== *French article ==External links== * Category:1671 births Category:1743 deaths Category:17th-century French writers Category:17th- century male writers Category:18th-century French writers Category:18th- century male writers Category:French letter writers Category:French lawyers Category:French male non-fiction writers ",
