    "text": "Tibidy (Latin - insula Thopopegya or insula Thopepigia) is a French islet at the mouth of the river Faou, at the bottom of the roadstead of Brest, on land belonging to the commune of L'H\u00f4pital-Camfrout. Its highest point is 15m. The island houses a private manor and is linked to the mainland by a spit. A legend given in the life of Saint Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 by the cartulary of Land\u00e9vennec Abbey states that Saint Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, accompanied by 11 other disciples of Saint Budoc, arrived from \u00cele Lavret (archipelago of Br\u00e9hat) on \u00eele de Tibidy and there set up an oratory. Three years later, they left the island and reached Land\u00e9vennec, with the island then being given to Land\u00e9vennec Abbey by Gradlon.
