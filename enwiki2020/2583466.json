    "text": "Kardinya is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located within the City of Melville. The suburb is home to under 10,000 people, including many international students due to its proximity to Murdoch University. ==History== The word \"Kardinya\" is believed to be of Aboriginal origin, meaning \"the place of the Karda\" (racehorse goanna), although it is also recognised as an Aboriginal word for \"sunrise\". Much of the area was originally farmland, dating back to the early 1900s. Welby Vineyard, established in 1922 by George Welby, which was the City of Melville's solitary winery, was built on what is now Kardinya. The winery was closed in 1964 and subdivided into housing lots. Part of the suburb was originally a Forest Departments and University of Western Australia pine plantation and reservation. Many streets in the suburb are now named after University of Western Australia personnel, as well as different varieties of pine as a result of the pine plantation. Kardinya is one of Perth's top 10 tightly-held suburbs (July 2013).http://www.perthnow.com.au/realestate/news/perths-most-tighly-held- suburbs/story-fnhlgriw-1226742561605 Source RP Data ==Local business== Kardinya has its own local shopping Centre called Kardinya Park.
