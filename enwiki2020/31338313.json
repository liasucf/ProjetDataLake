Retrieved 01/2011. Her father, Karel van Gelder, was a chemist who ran the sugar plantation, and her mother, born Melanie van Motman, was from a very well-to- do Dutch family as well. Both her parents had been members of the Theosophical Society since 1900 and from the age of 5 meditation became a daily routine.Kirsten van Gelder, Frank Chesley, A Most Unusual Life.

Fritz for a time was principal of Ananda College in Colombo. In 1927, at the age of twenty-two, Dora moved with Kunz to the United States where they married in Chicago on May 16. She was still a Dutch citizen but sometime after the marriage became a naturalized American.

Bruno, Therapeutic touch - Encyclopedia of Medicine. Article, 2001. Gale Research. Retrieved 01/2011. Therapeutic touch, stated Kunz, has its origin from ancient Yogic texts written in Sanskrit, which describe it as a pranic healing method. The technique is taught in approximately eighty colleges and universities in the U.S., and in more than seventy countries. Kunz philanthropically directed her clairvoyance towards helping physicians in complicated medical cases,Von Braschler, Natural Pet Healing: Our Psychic, Spiritual Connection, 2003. pp. 2,3. . in particular aiding in diagnoses through her capability of seeing the effects of diseases in the aura of the patients.

Her followers believed she was able to predict some illness as many as eighteen months before symptoms manifest themselves. In 1975 Kunz became president of the Theosophical Society in America. In 1977 she published a book about her fairy experiences in her youth, \"The Real World of Fairies\", in which she stated that throughout her life she always kept in communication with nature spirits. According to her, in 1979 she saw fairies in Central Park in New York City, but due to the increasing pollution it was getting more difficult.Gordon Stein, The encyclopedia of the paranormal, 1996, p. 266. . Kunz claims that devas are intimately connected with a vital energy, transmitting force to preserve and heal the Earth. She said as more people get involved with environmental causes, the better are the chances of communication between humans and devas.

In the 1920s walking on the shores of Mosman Dora Kunz says she met a friendly nature spirit worried about evil entities who had invaded the local area, and she managed to expel them. \"Mosman's Bay\" by Arthur Streeton, 1914. ==Criticism== The healing method, the \"Therapeutic Touch\" conceived by Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz in the early 1970s using the \"human energy field\" was tested in 1996 by Emily Rosa. At age nine Rosa conceived and executed a scientific study of therapeutic touch which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998. It was a critique of all of the studies related to TT she could locate in nursing journals and elsewhere. This made Rosa the youngest person to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal. She concluded as her opinion: \"The more rigorous the research design, the more detailed the statistical analysis, the less evidence that there is any observed\u2014or observable\u2014phenomenon.\" She just could not see it. ==Works== ===Books=== * Christmas of the Angels, 1962. * The Real World of Fairies, 1977. * Fields and their clinical implications; co-author Erik Peper, 1985. * Spiritual aspects of the healing arts, 1985. * Devic Counsciouness, 1989. * The Chakras and the Human Energy Fields; co-author Shafica Karagulla, 1989. * The Personal Aura, 1991. * Spiritual Healing, 1995. * Aura en persoonlijkheid: aura's zien en begrijpen (Aura and personality: see auras and understand); co-author George Hulskramer, 1998. ===Interviews and lectures=== * Reminiscences of Annie Besant and C.W.
