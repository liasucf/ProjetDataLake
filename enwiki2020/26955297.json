    "text": "The House on the Hill is the third album by the British art rock band Audience, released in 1971. At about the same time, a single, \"Indian Summer\", reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100;. The North American version of the album on Elektra Records added \"Indian Summer\" as the opening track, along with \"It Brings A Tear\" which had already appeared on the UK album Friend's Friend's Friend. The Elektra LP dropped the song \"Eye To Eye\". Both the UK and North American LPs were originally issued as gatefold. The UK gatefold contains black-and-white photos of each band member. The Elektra Records gatefold contains the album lyrics with a photo of the \"house on the hill\" in the background. The Elektra LP was later reissued in the early 1980s, non- gatefold. The 1991 Virgin Records UK CD release, issued in the U.S. on Caroline Records, used the British LP track listing, adding the single \"Indian Summer\" to the end of the album. The Elektra Records version of The House On The Hill has never been issued on CD. ==Charisma UK and foreign LP track listing== Unless noted, all tracks credited to Werth, Williams. ===Side one=== # \"Jackdaw\" (Werth, Gemmell) - 7:28 # \"You're Not Smiling\" (Werth, Gemmell) - 5:12 # \"I Had a Dream\" - 4:17 # \"Raviole\" (Werth) - 3:38 ===Side two=== # \"Nancy\" - 4:14 # \"Eye to Eye\" - 2:30 # \"I Put a Spell on You\" (J.
