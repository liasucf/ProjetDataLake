    "text": "The Daraa insurgency is an ongoing conflict being waged against the Syrian Army and allies by various anti-government forces in Daraa Governorate. Insurgent activity began in late 2018, but drastically increased the following year. Over 500 attacks have occurred since June 2019, when the insurgency intensified. Tensions between reconciled rebels and the Syrian government would lead to armed clashes between the two sides on several occasions. == Background == Daraa and Quneitra governorates with reconciliation areas shown. Following the 2018 offensive that brought Daraa and Quneitra under control of the Syrian Arab Army, many rebels forces in the area agreed to Russian- brokered reconciliation deals, in which they laid down their weapons against the Syrian Army. The rebels also handed over their heavy weapons. Most rebels stayed behind, and control various areas in the province, as well as the Al- Balad subdistrict of the city of Daraa. Those who didn't agree to the terms were sent to rebel held areas in Idlib Governorate by bus. However, due to several factors, Daraa became unstable following the conflict. Tensions arose between the Syrian government and the reconciled rebels. Conditions in the province were lackluster. Most people in Daraa live below the poverty line, the poor financial situation has led to high unemployment, especially among youth. Basic services are in terrible condition, due in part to damage from fighting. Economic downturn and lack of security gave rise to crime and tribal justice, fueling the security chaos. The presence of foreign groups such as Hezbollah increased these tensions. In addition, forced conscription, arrests and disappearances of civilians, former rebel fighters and former rebel commanders fueled anger against the Syrian government. == Factions == The Popular Resistance is the largest of the opposition groups in Daraa. It was created in 2018, but began extensive operations in 2019. They usually carry out attacks on Syrian Army positions, intelligence agencies, and former rebels and commanders working for the government. The soldiers of former rebel factions which operated with Daraa are present in several towns and cities in the province, and have clashed with government forces on several occasions during military operations against their areas.
