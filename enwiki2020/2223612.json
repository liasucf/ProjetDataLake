    "text": "Christopher Doyle Snelling (born December 3, 1981) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. ==Career== ===Seattle Mariners=== Snelling was signed as an amateur free agent out of Australia by the Seattle Mariners on March 2, 1999. He quickly established himself as the franchise's top position prospect in the system. He was often compared to Lenny Dykstra due to his aggressive play and ability to hit for average and draw walks. He made it to the major leagues in 2002, but during a baserunning mishap tore his ACL in his left knee. After that incident, his status as a top prospect began to decline, as Snelling suffered numerous serious injuries in subsequent years. At Seattle Mariners fan blog USS Mariner, Snelling was dubbed \"Doyle\" (his middle name) in hopes of driving off the injury curse that plagued him. ===Washington Nationals=== On the night of December 13, 2006, The Washington Post reported that Snelling and Mariners pitching prospect Emiliano Fruto would be traded to the Washington Nationals for veteran second baseman Jos\u00e9 Vidro. The trade was completed several days later. Following the Virginia Tech massacre, players for the Nationals wore Virginia Tech baseball caps for their game against the Atlanta Braves on April 17, 2007. Snelling's cap was then sent to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. On the evening of May 2, 2007, during a game between the Nationals and San Diego Padres, Snelling was traded to the Oakland Athletics for outfielder Ryan Langerhans. ===Tampa Bay Devil Rays=== Snelling was claimed off waivers from the Athletics by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on October 25, 2007. ===Philadelphia Phillies=== With a crowded outfield, the Rays traded Snelling to the Philadelphia Phillies for cash considerations on November 20, 2007. The Phillies sent him outright to the minors on March 28, 2008. On April 12, 2008, Snelling was recalled from the minor leagues by the Phillies after an injury to Shane Victorino. Despite getting only 4 AB, he had two very key hits for the Phillies who won the division by just three games. On April 15, he hit a pinch hit, first pitch HR off Houston Astros closer Jos\u00e9 Valverde in the 9th inning with his team down three runs. The Phillies scored three more runs in the inning and won the game.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI200804150.shtml On June 6, he hit a pinch hit double to lead off the top of the 10th inning against the Atlanta Braves.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL200806060.shtml The Phillies scored two runs in the inning and won the game. He was designated for assignment on June 7. He spent most of the season with the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. ===San Diego Padres=== Snelling signed a minor league deal with San Diego Padres on March 14, 2009. ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== On June 10, 2009, Snelling was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for future considerations, but was released after Ryan Doumit was activated. He played the rest of the season with the Monterrey Sultanes in the Mexican League. ==International career== Although he was born in the United States, Snelling grew up in Australia and has played for the Australian national team. He selected at the 2009 World Baseball Classic, 2009 Baseball World Cup and 2013 World Baseball Classic. At the 2009 World Baseball Classic, he hit two of Australia's four home runs in its victory over Mexico on March 8, 2009. ==References== ==External links== : Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Arizona League Mariners players Category:Baseball players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Clearwater Threshers players Category:Everett AquaSox players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Lehigh Valley IronPigs players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Mexican League baseball first basemen Category:Mexican League baseball outfielders Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Olympic baseball players of Australia Category:People from North Miami, Florida Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Sacramento River Cats players Category:San Antonio Missions players Category:San Bernardino Stampede players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Sportspeople from Miami Category:Sultanes de Monterrey players Category:Tacoma Rainiers players Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Wisconsin Timber Rattlers players Category:2009 World Baseball Classic players Category:2013 World Baseball Classic players ",
