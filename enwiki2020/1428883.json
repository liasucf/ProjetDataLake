Since its residents were adherents of the Christian sect of Paulicianism, it soon acquired its present name. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, the demographics of the village changed significantly, as many Turks settled to make it a purely Turkish village. After the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1877\u20131878, the Turks left to be replaced by Bulgarians from the Balkan Mountains and the villages of the plains. After the Liberation Pavlikeni developed as a centre of craftsmanship and trade, with many new buildings being constructed. Pavlikeni acquired town status in 1943 owing much to its position on the Sofia-Varna railway line. ==Notable natives== *Nicola Ghiuselev - world-renowned opera singer *Kiril Rakarov - former Bulgarian national football player *Pamira - international hitch-hiker with more than 3 visits to the town, true enjoyer of Pavlikeni ==Honour== Pavlikeni Point on Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Pavlikeni. ==Changes in the city== After Bulgaria became a part of the European Union Pavlikeni created a project, which was an idea to improve the city as a whole by using the European funds.
