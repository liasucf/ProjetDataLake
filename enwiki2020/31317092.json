    "text": "Liang Hongyu (1102-1135) was a Chinese general of the Song Dynasty. She became famous during the Jin\u2013Song wars against the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. Her real given name was lost in time. She was simply referenced in the official Chinese history books as \"Lady Liang\" (\u6881\u6c0f). \"Hongyu\" (\u7ea2\u7389), meaning \"Red Jade\" in Chinese, was the name given in folk legends, Chinese operas, and novels after her heroic death in battle in 1135. She was the wife of Han Shizhong, a Song general known for resisting invaders from the Jin dynasty together with Yue Fei and others. ==Early life== Liang's father was an army commander at the frontier, from where the Song Dynasty was increasingly threatened by the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty. He taught her martial skills. Liang's feet were not bound. She was a master of martial arts. Several accounts stated she was a woman with incredible strength and a master of archery. At some point she was forced to work as a female slave due to her father being punished for losing a critical battle. According to some historical accounts, her slave work might be similar to modern day's woman wrestler. In the Song Dynasty, woman wrestling was a popular sport that even attracted the Song emperors to view woman wrestling in public matches. Most female wrestlers were dressed as males, wearing nothing but a loincloth during the match. This sport was completely banned in the Ming Dynasty since Ming era people felt it was indecent. Some modern historians argued this was the reason her position had been misinterpreted as prostitution by some historians in the Ming Dynasty. At certain point in her career, she met her husband Han Shizhong, though accounts differ on exactly how they met. The most believable version is that she met Han at a banquet where she was entertaining the troops that Han led. Han had led his men in crushing a rebellion in southern China, and Han had personally arrested the rebel leader Fang La. However, his superior stole his credit, much to Han's displeasure. Liang knew the truth and admired Han's victory. She saved enough money to pay her own redemption of slavery. After she was free, she became Han's second wife. The Jurchens soon started the total invasion on the Song Dynasty. Han formed an army to fight the Jurchens. Liang worked as a general in her husband's army. ==Restore the Song emperor== Han and Liang's army soon became part of the main force against the Jurchens after Song lost its capital and northern China to the Jurchens. After the Jurchens captured two Song's emperors (Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong), Emperor Gaozong reestablished the Song government in southern China. In 1129 there was a coup in the Song imperial court and Emperor Gaozong was held hostage and forced to abdicate. At the time, Han was leading an army in the front line. Liang was also house-arrested by the rebels in the hope to force her husband to surrender. She worked with Emperor Gaozong's loyalists to come up a plan that misled the rebel leader into releasing her as a messenger and goodwill gesture to her husband. Once free, she rode to her husband immediately and told her husband about the rebel's defence. This enabled her husband to crush the coup and restore Emperor Gaozong. Afterwards, Liang was rewarded with noble rank of \"Noble Lady of Hu Guo\" (\u8b77\u570b\u592b\u4eba), meaning \"Lady Protector of the Nation\", which was not related to her husband's rank. This was unique in Chinese history since most Chinese noble women got their ranks through their husbands. ==Battle of Huangtiandang== When the Jurchens once more invaded and attacked Hangzhou in 1129 shortly after the coup had been crushed, Liang and her husband led their forces to ambush the enemy army on their way back to Jin territory. Their troops were outnumbered and the Battle of Huangtiandang commenced. This was a series of naval battles fought on the Yangtze River. Liang made a plan by which she would direct the soldiers with her drums. When the battle started, the Song troops were pushed back by Jurchen troops due to superior numbers on the Jurchen side. With great courage, Liang threw her helmet and armour, beating the drums and led the charge into the enemy formation. This became the turning point of the battle. Chinese \"Tiger Ships\", which could spew fire with flame throwers, destroyed many Jin ships while Liang directed them with her drumming. The Jurchens were trapped for more than a month, before a traitor revealed a weakness in the Chinese encirclement and they escaped, but with heavy losses. ==Later life== In 1135 Han was appointed jiedushi of Wuning Anhua (\u6b66\u5be7\u5b89\u5316\u8ecd\u7bc0\u5ea6\u4f7f). Liang and her husband rebuilt the fortress of Chuzhou and increased its defence. They and their soldiers also worked on the rebuilding of houses and the planting of fields. ==Legacy== Poetry was written in her honour, which contributed to her fame. Together with Qin Liangyu, He Yufeng and the legendary Hua Mulan, she is one of the most well-known female warriors in China. ==References== Category:Women in war in China Category:12th-century Chinese people Category:Women in 12th-century warfare Category:Song dynasty generals Category:1135 deaths Category:1102 births Category:Female generals Category:Burials in Suzhou Category:Deified Chinese people ",
