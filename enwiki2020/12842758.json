He is several times mentioned by Galen,De Compos. Medicam. secund. Locos, ix. 4. vol. xiii. p. 278 who has also preserved an antidote invented by him against the bite of serpents.De Antid. ii. 12. vol. xiv. p. 177. The name is to be met with in numerous Latin inscriptions in Grutor's collection, five of which refer to a freedman of Augustus, who is supposed by some scholars to be the same person that is mentioned by Galen. This, however, is quite uncertain, as also whether Parakletios Abaskanthos (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f08\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2) in GalenDe Compos. Medicam. secund. Locos, vii. 3. vol. xiii. p. 71 refers to the subject of this article. ==References== * Category:Ancient Greek physicians Category:Ancient Roman physicians Category:People from Lugdunum Category:2nd-century Greek people Category:2nd- century physicians Category:2nd-century Gallo-Roman people ",
