    "text": "280px is a stable of sumo wrestlers, one of the Takasago group of stables. It was formed in 1967 and is located in Ishiwara, Sumida, Tokyo. As of January 2020 it had 22 sumo wrestlers, five of whom were of sekitori rank. It is the most successful stable in terms of total y\u016bsh\u014d won by its wrestlers, with 52. ==History== Former yokozuna Chiyonoyama of Dewanoumi stable had wanted to succeed to the Dewanoumi name, but the then Dewanoumi stablemaster (former wrestler Dewanohana) had already decided to pass the name to former yokozuna Sadanoyama. Accordingly, in January 1967, he set up his own stable, taking with him, amongst others, then \u014dzeki Kitanofuji and attaching the new stable to the Takasago group of stables. After Chiyonoyama died in 1977, Kitanofuji, who had already revived Izutsu stable, became the 11th Kokonoe-oyakata. He raised Chiyonofuji, then a makuuchi wrestler, to the great yokozuna he became. Later he also saw Hokutoumi become a yokozuna. Takanofuji and Fujinoshin also reached the top division. In 1992, the year after Chiyonofuji retired from the ring, Kitanofuji handed over the stable to him. Chiyonofuji and Kitanofuji swapped names, Chiyonofuji becoming Kokonoe-oyakata and gaining control of the stable, whilst Kitanofuji became Jinmaku-oyakata, attached to Hakkaku stable, set up by the former Hokutoumi in 1993. In the early 1990s Kokonoe stable was one of the largest in sumo but had only one sekitori, Tomoefuji. Kokonoe eventually produced Chiyotenzan, briefly a komusubi in 1999, and long serving \u014dzeki Chiyotaikai (1999\u20132009), his most successful wrestler. Following the retirements of Chiyotaikai in January 2010 and Chiyohakuh\u014d in April 2011, the stable had no sekitori for a short time, but Chiyonokuni reached j\u016bry\u014d in July 2011 and the top division in January 2012. Chiyotairy\u016b followed afterwards and reached makuuchi in May 2012. By March 2014, Kokonoe stable was one of the most successful stables in sumo, with three men (Chiyotairy\u016b, Chiyo\u014dtori and Chiyomaru) in the top division and two (Chiyonokuni and Chiyono-\u014d) in j\u016bry\u014d. In January 2016 the stable moved up to six sekitori with the promotion of Chiyosh\u014dma, the most of any stable. As of September 2020 it remains at six, now level with Kise and one behind new leader Oitekaze. Chiyonofuji died in July 2016. Sanoyama-oyakata (the former Chiyotaikai) succeeded him as the Kokonoe stablemaster. ==Ring name conventions== Traditionally many wrestlers at this stable, often on reaching the sandanme division, take ring names or shikona that begin with the characters \u5343\u4ee3 (read: chiyo), meaning \"a thousand generations\", in deference to the founder, Chiyonoyama and also his later successor Chiyonofuji. As of March 2018, all wrestlers at the stable, including those in the bottom two divisions, have this prefix. ==Owners== *2016\u2013present: 14th Kokonoe (iin, former \u014dzeki Chiyotaikai Ry\u016bji) *1992-2016: 13th Kokonoe (former Chiyonofuji Mitsugu, the 58th yokozuna) *1977-1992: 12th Kokonoe (former Kitanofuji Katsuaki, the 52nd yokozuna) *1967-1977: 11th Kokonoe (former Chiyonoyama Masanobu, the 41st yokozuna) ==Notable active wrestlers== *Chiyomaru (best rank maegashira) *Chiyonokuni (best rank maegashira) * (best rank maegashira) * (best rank j\u016bry\u014d) *Chiyo\u014dtori (best rank komusubi) *Chiyotairy\u016b (best rank komusubi) *Chiyosh\u014dma (best rank maegashira) ==Coach== *Tanigawa Hideki (shunin, former sekiwake Hokut\u014driki) ==Notable former members== *Kitanofuji (the 52nd yokozuna) *Chiyonofuji (the 58th yokozuna) *Hokutoumi (the 61st yokozuna) *Chiyotaikai (former ozeki) *Kitaseumi (former sekiwake) *Chiyotenzan (former komusubi) *Takanofuji (former komusubi) ==Referees== *3rd Kimura Y\u014dd\u014d (san'yaku gy\u014dji, real name Y\u016bji Horasawa) *Kimura K\u014dnosuke (san'yaku gy\u014dji, real name Toshiaki Kojima) ==Ushers== *Shigeo (san'yaku yobidashi, real name Takumi Taniguchi) *Shigetar\u014d (juryo yobidashi, real name Katsunori Hattori) *Kaito (jonidan yobidashi, real name Keisuke Miyagi) ==Hairdressers== *Tokotake (1st class tokoyama) *Tokoky\u016b (2nd class tokoyama) ==Location and access== Tokyo, Sumida Ward, Ishihara 4-22-4 15 minute walk from Ry\u014dgoku Station on S\u014dbu Line == See also == *Kokonoe- oyakata *List of active sumo wrestlers *List of past sumo wrestlers *Glossary of sumo terms *List of sumo stables ==References== == External links == *Official site *Japan Sumo Association profile *Article on Kokonoe stable Category:Active sumo stables ",
