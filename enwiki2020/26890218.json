One of his grand-uncles, Sir David Pollock, was the chief justice of Bombay, while another, Sir George Pollock, became a field marshal. His own father was an author and Queen's Remembrancer under Queen Victoria from 1874 to 1886, when the post was passed on to his brother George Frederick Pollock who continued to hold the title until the turn of the 20th century. His eldest brother, Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet, was a noted lawyer and frequently worked with him during his career. Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated with a classical degree in 1871 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple three years later.Tyson, Brian, ed. Bernard Shaw's Book Reviews: Originally Published in the Pall Mall Gazette from 1885 to 1888. University Park: Pennsylvania State Press, 1991. (pg. 345) He developed an interest in literature and history and began lecturing at the Royal Institution, London. Among the subjects he discussed included the works of Richelieu, Colbert, Victor Hugo, Sir Francis Drake and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. In 1875, he joined the staff of the Saturday Review and became an assistant editor. It was around this time that he began courting Emma Jane Pipon, daughter of Colonel Pipon, Seigneur de Noirmont of Jersey, and the two were married in Chester on 11 January 1876. Their first and only son, Guy Cameron Pollock, was born that same year. It was while working for the publication that he first began writing professionally and co- wrote Marston: A Story of these Modern Times with Alexander J. Duffield in 1877. He also published literary critical works such as The Modern French Theatre (1878) and Lectures on French Poets (1879), English-language translations of works by Alfred de Musset's and Denis Diderot, and a collection of poetic verses entitled Songs and Rhymes: English and French (1882) and Verses of Two Tongues (1884). In 1884, Pollock succeeded Philip Harwood as editor of the Saturday Review and remained with the publication for the next 10 years.University of Texas. The University of Texas Studies in English.

By himself, he wrote A Nine Men's Morrice (1889), Old and New (1890), The Seal of Fate (1891) and King Zub, and Other Stories (1893). In addition, Pollock contributed 26 poems of \"magazine verse\" to Longman's from 1890 to 1905.

He wrote novels on German student life, at least one book in French, Monsieur le Marquis de -- (1780-1793), Memoires In\u00e9dits Recueillis (1894), various plays, and also made several excursions into belles-lettres. A second collaboration with Sir Walter Besant produced The Charm and Other Drawing-Room Plays (1896). The next year, he co-wrote Fencing (1897) as part of the Badminton series with F. C. Grove and Camille Pr\u00e9vost (Pollock then being considered the finest amateur fencer in Britain) as well as King and Artist: A Romantic Play in Five Acts (1897) with Lilian Moubrey. Two years later, he wrote Jane Austen: Her Contemporaries and Herself (1899), considered one of the most important works of literary criticism on the female author, and published a revised edition of Watts Phillips' The Dead Heart: A Story of the French Revolution (1900). He and his son Guy Cameron Pollock wrote a novel together, Hay Fever (1905), and wrote biographies of two of his friends titled Impressions of Henry Irving (1908) and The Art of the Hon. John Collier (1914). His final book was Icarian Flights (1920). His wife died in 1922; afterwards she was said to have been the inspiration for his poetry. Pollock lived in retirement until his own death on 21 February 1926. == Fencing == Together with his elder brother Sir Frederick, he participated in the first English revival of historical fencing, originated by Alfred Hutton and his colleagues Egerton Castle, Captain Carl Thimm, Colonel Cyril Matthey, Captain Percy Rolt, Captain Ernest George Stenson Cooke, Captain Frank Herbert Whittow.Thimm, Carl Albert.
