It's the only song that was successful from the album. ==Music video== The music video for \"We Went\" was directed by Dustin Rikert and premiered in August 2015. ==Critical reception== Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song a positive review, saying that \"The How Country Feels album was a commercial comeback album for Houser, but this song feels more personal. Maybe he's just more confident after several No. 1 hits. \"We Went\" is not a true vocal showcase a la \"Like a Cowboy,\" but there's enough power between his voice and this arrangement to remind fans he's not resting on a good year or two.\" ==Chart performance== The single has sold 300,000 copies in the US as of March 2016. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
