    "text": "Divya Bharti (25 February 1974 \u2013 5 April 1993) was an Indian film actress who worked predominantly in Hindi and Telugu cinema in the early 1990s. Regarded as the most popular and top-billed Indian actress of her time, Bharti has acted in over 14 films in two years of her career, which is an unbroken record by any debutante. Bharti started her film career as a teenager, while she was doing pin-up modeling assignments. She made her debut with a lead role opposite Venkatesh in Telugu-language romantic action Bobbili Raja (1990). She subsequently appeared in critically and financially unsuccessful Tamil- language drama Nila Pennae (1990). Films like Naa Ille Naa Swargam (1991), and Assembly Rowdy (1991) garnered her negative reviews. Bharti had her first commercial success with the romantic comedy Rowdy Alludu (1991). After featuring in Telugu films, she progressed to Hindi cinema in 1992 and made her acting debut with the action thriller Vishwatma (1992). The 1992 action-comedy Shola Aur Shabnam a box office hit, marked a turning point in her career. She achieved further success with starring roles in the romance Deewana (1992), and gained the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. Bharti died in April 1993, aged 19, after falling from the balcony of her apartment in Mumbai under mysterious circumstances. ==Early life and family== Bharti was born in Mumbai (known at the time as Bombay) on 25 February 1974 to Om Prakash Bharti and Meeta Bharti. She had a younger brother named Kunal and a half-sister Poonam, who was the child of Om Prakash Bharti's first marriage. Actress Kainaat Arora is her cousin. Bharti spoke Hindi, English and Marathi fluently. In her early years, she was known for her bubbly personality and doll-like looks. She studied at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu, Mumbai. Bharti was a restless student at school and completed the 9th standard before pursuing an acting career. ==Career== In 1988, Bharti, then a ninth-grader, was signed by filmmaker Nandu Tolani for one of his films. She was originally scheduled to make her screen debut in Gunahon Ka Devta in 1988, but her role was cancelled and she was replaced by Sangeeta Bijlani. Kirti Kumar (Govinda's brother) noticed Bharti at a video library, and was eager to sign her for his project Radha Ka Sangam opposite Govinda. Kumar met with director Dilip Shankar and managed to release Bharti from her contract. After taking dancing and acting lessons for months to prepare for her role, Bharti was dropped and replaced by Juhi Chawla. It was speculated that Kumar's possessiveness over Bharti and her childish nature were the cause of her replacement. Bharti's career was stalled until D. Ramanaidu, a Telugu film producer, offered her a leading role in the film Bobbili Raja opposite his son Daggubati Venkatesh. She commenced shooting in Andhra Pradesh for her screen debut. The film was released in the summer of 1990 and became a hit. Bobbili Raja remains one of the most popular Telugu movies. Later in the year, Bharti acted in a Tamil film, Nila Penne, opposite Anand. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In box office ratings, Bharti ranked next to Vijayshanti who has been widely called The Lady Superstar and Lady Amitabh of South Indian cinema. In 1991, Bharti had back- to-back hits with action comedy film Rowdy Alludu and drama Assembly Rowdy opposite actors Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu, respectively. Later that year, Bharti began filming A. Kodandarami Reddy's action romance Dharma Kshetram under Sri Rajeev Productions. Bharti got to work with Telugu film actor Nandamuri Balakrishna. While Bharti celebrated her success in Andhra Pradesh, Bollywood's top directors were eager to sign her for films. Bharti's first Bollywood film was Vishwatma opposite Sunny Deol, directed by Rajiv Rai, and was released on 2 January 1992. The film was an average box office performer in the box office but gained Bharti wider recognition from the public as well as film critics. Bharti was most notable for the song used in the film Saat Samundar. A week later, Bharti's next film, Lawrence D'Souza's romantic drama Dil Ka Kya Kasoor, in which she starred alongside Prithvi, was released. The film was not a box office success but was recognized for its music. In March 1992, David Dhawan's romantic action drama Shola Aur Shabnam was released. It was popular with critics and was a box office hit in India, marking Bharti's first major hit in Bollywood. Bharti achieved further success in Raj Kanwar's Filmfare Award-winning love story Deewana, which starred veteran actor Rishi Kapoor and newcomer Shahrukh Khan and was one of the biggest hits of 1992. Her performance in Deewana was highly appreciated. Critics reported that Bharti belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors who broke away from character stereotypes. Bharti won the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year and Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. By July 1992, Bharti's work in Deewana was said to have earned her more recognition. She had several Hindi releases that year, among them action drama Jaan Se Pyaara, which featured Bharti alongside Govinda once again, romantic drama Geet opposite Avinash Wadhawan, action Dushman Zamana alongside Armaan Kohli, and action drama Balwaan, which marked the debut of Sunil Shetty. The latter achieved moderate success. In October, she appeared in Hema Malini's romantic drama Dil Aashna Hai, which did not do as well at the box office. Bharti played the part of a bar dancer who sets out to find her birth mother earned her appreciation. Bharti decided to act in one Telugu movie per year to not disappoint her Telugu audience. Chittamma Mogudu was released at the end of 1992, again starring the popular couple of Bharti and Mohan Babu. In the last film to be released during her lifetime, the ensemble film Kshatriya, she co-starred alongside Sunny Deol, Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon. It was released on 26 March 1993. Bharti was replaced in films she had not completed, including Mohra (played by Raveena Tandon), Kartavya (played by Juhi Chawla), Vijaypath (played by Tabu), Dilwale (played by Raveena Tandon), and Andolan (played by Mamta Kulkarni). She was more than halfway through the filming of Laadla at the time of her death and the movie was reshot with Sridevi portraying the role. Shortly before her death, she had completed filming for Rang and Shatranj; these were released posthumously on 7 September 1993 and 17 December 1993 respectively and achieved moderate success. Although she had completed filming her scenes for both films, a dubbing artist was used as she never got the chance to dub for the films. Her incomplete Telugu film Tholi Muddhu was partly completed by actress Rambha, who slightly resembled Bharti and hence was used as her body double to complete her remaining scenes; the film was released in October 1993. She was also supposed to play the role of Bhavani in the Telugu film Allari Premikudu, but due to her death her role was given to Rambha. ==Personal life== Bharti met director-producer Sajid Nadiadwala through Govinda while working on the set of Shola Aur Shabnam, and they married on 10 May 1992 and they married at a private ceremony on 10 May 1992, in the presence of her hairdresser and friend Sandhya, Sandhya's husband, and a qazi at Nadiadwala's Tulsi Buildings residence in Mumbai. She converted to Islam after her marriage, changing her name to Sana Nadiadwala. The marriage was kept secret so as to not affect her prosperous film career. == Death == In the late evening hours of 5 April 1993, Bharti fell from the balcony window of her fifth-floor apartment in Tulsi Buildings, Versova, Andheri West (Mumbai). When her guests Neeta Lulla, Neeta's husband Shyam, Bharti's maid Amrita, and neighbours realised what had happened, she was rushed in an ambulance to the emergency department at Cooper Hospital, where she died. She was 19 years old. The official cause of her death was due to was severe head injuries and internal bleeding. She was cremated on 7 April 1993 at the Vile Parle crematorium in Mumbai. The reason of her fatal fall was never established and several theories circulated in the media. Some sources believe it was a planned murder, others say she accidentally fell, while some say she fell because she was drunk at the time which caused her to fall. The investigation was closed in 1998 by the Mumbai police who concluded that it was an accidental death. == Legacy == Bharati is regarded as the most popular and top-billed Indian actress of her time, She acted in over 20 films during her short career, an unbroken record by a debutante. In 2011, Bollywood legend Dev Anand made the movie Chargesheet, which was loosely based on her death and the mystery surrounding it. Om Shanti Om, the 2007 film directed by Farah Khan and produced by Shah Rukh Khan was reported to be loosely based on her life. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin- right: 0;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role(s) !Language ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1990 |Bobbili Raja | Rani |Telugu | | |- |Nila Pennae | Surya |Tamil | | |- | rowspan=\"3\" |1991 |Rowdy Alludu |Rekha |Telugu | | |- |Naa Ille Naa Swargam |Lalitha |Telugu | | |- |Assembly Rowdy | Pooja |Telugu | | |- | rowspan=\"12\" |1992 |Vishwatma | Kusum |Hindi | | |- |Dil Ka Kya Kasoor | Seema/ |Hindi | | |- |Andhaa Insaaf |Payel |Hindi | | |- |Shola Aur Shabnam | |Hindi | | |- |Deewana | Kaajal |Hindi | | |- |Jaan Se Pyaara | Sharmila |Hindi | | |- |Balwaan | Deepa |Hindi | | |- |Dushman Zamana | Seema |Hindi | | |- |Dil Aashna Hai | Laila / Sitara |Hindi | | |- |Geet | Neha |Hindi | | |- |Chittemma Mogudu | Chittemma |Telugu | | |- |Dharma Kshetram | Mythili |Telugu | | |- | rowspan=\"5\" |1993 |Dil Hi To Hai | Bharati |Hindi | | |- |Kshatriya | |Hindi |Last release during her lifetime | |- |Tholi Muddhu | Divya |Telugu | Posthumous release; Role partly completed by Rambha | |- |Rang | Kajal |Hindi | Posthumous release | |- |Shatranj | Renu |Hindi | Posthumous release | |- |} ==Awards== ===Filmfare Awards=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !
