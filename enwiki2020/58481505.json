He explains \"I wrote it right in the middle of the relationship I was in when I started to realise that I was ruining it, and that my actions were starting to affect her. I would come home and see her crying. She was always upset. She wasn't the same person that she was when we first started dating. And I felt like it was because of me and the way I was acting.\" ==Music video== The music video for \"Changing\" was directed by Matt Earl and released on 16 October 2018. ==Reception== The Prelude Press described the song as \"vulnerable and emotional\". Power FM described the song as \"a stripped back ballad that shows the Aussie powerhouse's penchant for bold and masterful songwriting.\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 91 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
