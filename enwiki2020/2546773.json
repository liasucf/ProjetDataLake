    "text": "Thomas Chaucer (c. 136718 November 1434) was an English courtier and politician. The son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer and his wife Philippa Roet, Thomas was linked socially and by family to senior members of the English nobility, though he was himself a commoner. Elected fifteen times to the Parliament of England, he was Speaker of the House of Commons for five parliaments in the early 15th century. ==Parental connections== Arms of Chaucer: Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or, as later quartered by de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk Thomas Chaucer was a relative by marriage of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, through his aunt Katherine Swynford. Katherine (born Roet) was the sister of his mother, Philippa Roet. Swynford was first Gaunt's mistress, and then his third wife. Their four children, John Beaufort, Henry Beaufort, Thomas Beaufort and Joan Beaufort, were first cousins to Thomas Chaucer, and all prospered: John's family became Earls and subsequently Dukes of Somerset, Henry a Cardinal, Thomas became Duke of Exeter, Joan became Countess of Westmorland and was grandmother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III. King Henry IV - son of John of Gaunt by his first marriage to Blanche of Lancaster - was half-brother to Thomas Chaucer's Beaufort first cousins. Thomas was able to buy Donnington Castle for his only daughter Alice. ==Marriage== differenced version of these arms, with alteration to the field, in lieu of his paternal arms of Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged, as used by his father the poet Early in life, Thomas Chaucer married Matilda (or Maud) Burghersh, second daughter and coheiress of Sir John Burghersh, nephew of Henry Burghersh (1292-1340), Bishop of Lincoln (1320-1340) and Lord Chancellor of England (1328\u20131330), younger son of Robert de Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh (died 1305), and a nephew of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere. The marriage brought him large estates, including the manor of Ewelme, Oxfordshire. ==Career== He was Chief Butler of England for almost thirty years, first appointed by Richard II, and on 20 March 1399 received a pension of twenty marks a year in exchange for offices granted him by the Duke, paying at the same time five marks for the confirmation of two annuities of charges on the Duchy of Lancaster and also granted by the Duke. These annuities were confirmed to him by Henry IV, who appointed him constable of Wallingford Castle, and steward of the honours of Wallingford and St. Valery and of the Chiltern Hundreds. About the same time he succeeded Geoffrey Chaucer as forester of North Petherton Park, Somerset. On 5 November 1402, he received a grant of the chief butlership for life. Chaucer served as High Sheriff of Berkshire and Oxfordshire during 1400 and 1403 and as High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1413. He attended fifteen parliaments as knight of the shire for Oxfordshire (1400\u20131401, 1402, 1405\u20131406, 1407, 1409\u20131410, 1411, 1413, 1414, 1421, 1422, 1425\u20131426, 1427, 1429, 1430\u20131431) and was Speaker of the House five times, a feat not surpassed until the 18th century. He was chosen speaker in the parliament that met at Gloucester in 1407, and on 9 November reminded the king that the accounts of the expenditure of the last subsidy had not been rendered. The chancellor interrupted him, declaring that they were not ready, and that for the future the lords would not promise them. He was chosen again in 1410 and in 1411, when, on making his 'protestation' and claiming the usual permission of free speech, he was answered by the king that he might speak as other speakers had done, but that no novelties would be allowed. He asked for a day's grace, and then made an apology. He was again chosen in 1414. On 23 February 1411 the queen gave him the manor of Woodstock and other estates during her life, and on 15 March the king assigned them to him after her death. In 1414 he also received a commission, in which he is called domicellus, to treat about the marriage of Henry V, and to take the homage of the Duke of Burgundy. A year later he served with the king in France, bringing into the field 12 men-at-arms and 37 archers. He was not present at the Battle of Agincourt, being sent back to England ill after the siege of Harfluer. It is unknown if he was really sick, or used it as an excuse to return to England. His retinue did march on to Agincourt. In 1417, he was employed to treat for peace with France. On the accession of Henry VI he appears to have been superseded in the chief butlership, and to have regained it shortly afterwards. In January 1424, he was appointed a member of the council, and the next year was one of the commissioners to decide a dispute between the Earl Marshal and the Earl of Warwick about precedence. In 1430\u20131431, he was appointed one of the executors of the will of the Duchess of York, and was by then very wealthy. Thomas Chaucer died at Ewelme Palace in the village of Ewelme, Oxfordshire on 18 November 1434 and is buried in St Mary's church in the village. ==Family== Thomas' only daughter Alice married William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk and her grandson John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln was the designated heir of Richard III. John was killed in battle and several of his brothers were later executed after Richard lost power. They left descendants however, including the Earls of Rutland and Portmore, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, who foiled the Gunpowder Plot and Sir Francis Sacheverel Darwin (through his mother, Elizabeth Collier, natural daughter of the Earl of Portmore). ==References== ;Attribution ==External links== *CHAUCER, Thomas (c1367-1434) of Ewelme, Oxon *Ewelme \u2013 The rise of the Chaucer and de la Pole families *Royal Berkshire History: Thomas Chaucer (1367\u20131434) Category:1367 births Category:1434 deaths Category:People from Wallingford, Oxfordshire Category:High Sheriffs of Berkshire Category:High Sheriffs of Oxfordshire Category:High Sheriffs of Hampshire Category:Speakers of the House of Commons of England Category:Geoffrey Chaucer Category:English MPs 1401 Category:English Roman Catholics Category:Holders of the Honour of Wallingford Category:English MPs 1402 Category:English MPs 1406 Category:English MPs 1407 Category:English MPs 1410 Category:English MPs 1411 Category:English MPs February 1413 Category:English MPs April 1414 Category:English MPs December 1421 Category:English MPs 1422 Category:English MPs 1425 Category:English MPs 1427 Category:English MPs 1429 Category:English MPs 1431 ",
