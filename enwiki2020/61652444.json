    "text": "Florence Ilott (20 September 1913 - 31 May 2002) was the first person to run across Westminster Bridge within the twelve chimes of Big Ben at noon. Running across the bridge before the clock struck noon was a long standing tradition with unknown origins for staff at the Commons. When Ilott accomplished this feat on 14 April 1934, she was a nineteen year old employed as a catering staff member in the tea room at the House of Commons. A news agency captured the achievement on film and sent it to cinema houses as part of a newsreel. Ilott was an amateur sprinter with particular success in the 220-yard dash. She died on 31 May 2002. == External links == * Video of Florence Ilott running across Westminster Bridge, digitized by Huntley Film Archives == References == Category:1913 births Category:2002 deaths ",
