    "text": "The 2022 MLS SuperDraft will be the 23rd edition of the SuperDraft conducted by Major League Soccer. The SuperDraft is held every January prior to the start of the MLS season. The 2020 SuperDraft was the first held exclusively via conference call and web streaming. Previously, the SuperDraft had been held in conjunction with the annual January United Soccer Coaches convention. ==Format== The SuperDraft format has remained constant throughout its history and closely resembles that of the NFL Draft: #Any expansion teams receive the first picks. MLS has announced that Charlotte FC will begin play as an expansion team in 2022. Sacramento Republic and St. Louis City were about to debut that year, but MLS delayed their start to 2023 instead. #Non-playoff clubs receive the next picks in reverse order of prior season finish. #Teams that made the MLS Cup Playoffs are then ordered by which round of the playoffs they are eliminated. #The winners of the MLS Cup are given the last selection, and the losers the penultimate selection. ==2022 SuperDraft Trades== *Round 2, Nashville \u2192 Vancouver Whitecaps.
