    "text": "The Gabol () is a Baloch tribe having a distinct identity through the centuries, and not a branch of any other Baloch tribe. During the reign of Mir Jalal Khan, the Gabol joined the Rind Federation. Eventually, they joined Mir Chakar Khan Rind as an ally against the Lasharis.Marri, Dr Shah Muhammad \"Baloch Qoum-2\", Gosha E Adab, Jinnah Road Quetta (2014) Despite their Near Eastern origin, at present, the tribe is largely settled in Karachi, and interior Sindh with significant numbers in Balochistan as well as Punjab. ==Etymology== According to a narrative \u06af\u0628\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0686\u06be \u062f\u06cc\u0632\u06a9, found among the Gabols of Kirthar (\u06a9\u064a\u0631 \u067f\u0631 \u062c\u0628\u0644), the word Gabol means \"castellated\". M.K. Pikolin translated it as \"valiant\" or \"strong\".Pikolin, M.K, \"The Sindh\", Takhleeqat, 5-Begum Road Mozang Lahore In this context, Edward Lipinski, an authority on Arameans, writes:Lipinski, Edward, Studia Phoenicia: Volume 18, p.32 \"There is no reason why 'Gambulu' (a powerful Aramean tribe at Iran-Iraq border), which shows either dissimilation bb>mb in 'Gabbol' or simply epenthetic(\u0637\u064f\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u06cc) 'm' appearing before 'b'.\" Similarly, Dr. Mir Alam Khan Raqib states:Raqib, Dr. Mir Alam Khan, Balochi Dunya, may 1966 p.35, Qasr Al Adab, 29-Writers Colony, Multan \"The letter 'm' in word 'Gambol' seems redundant and hard. So, due to its hardness the letter 'm' obsoleted and the word transformed to Gabol, still a well-known Baloch tribe.\" ==Ancient Chaldo-Aramean tribes== The Gabol tribe migrated from this part of Syria to southern Mesopotamia, and for this particular reason, Assyrians affirm them as Arameans (people from Aram Naharaim). The second largest migration of Arameans into Mesopotamia is entitled as Chaldeans. The autonomous state of Gaboli was one of the six states of Chaldea.\u0627\u0644\u06a9\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 It was the headquarters of the Gabol tribe residing near the border of Elam and the Persian Gulf. The fortified city Shapi'bal was the capital of Gaboli.Porter, Barbara N, Images, Power, and Politics: Figurative Aspects of Esarhaddon's Babylonian Policy p.31 The forefront troops of Mardukh-Baladan were composed of Gabols. They fought the Assyrians from 745 BC to 626 BC, leading to the formation of the Medean Empire along with other allies. Historians have described the Gabol tribe. Their observations are investigative while Western historians benefited from the archaeological excavation documents. Both groups agree that Gabol belongs to the Chaldo-Aramean association of Arab nomads. They are first mentioned in the twelfth century BC. The tablets of Assyrian archaeology describe their mettle and bravery.
