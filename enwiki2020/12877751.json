    "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Madagascar face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. ==Law regarding same- sex sexual activity== Same-sex sexual activity among persons at least 21 years of age is legal in Madagascar. The Penal Code provides for a prison sentence of two to five years and a fine of 2 to 10 million ariary (US$900 to US$4,500) for acts that are \"indecent or against nature with an individual of the same sex under the age of 21\". ==Recognition of same-sex unions== Madagascar does not recognise same-sex marriage or civil unions. ==Adoption and family planning== Only married, heterosexual couples may adopt children in Madagascar. ==Discrimination protections== The law in Madagascar does not outlaw discrimination with regard to sexual orientation or gender identity. ==Life conditions== The U.S. Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report found that \"[t]here was general societal discrimination against the LGBT community\" and that \"[s]exual orientation and gender identity were not widely discussed in the country, with public attitudes ranging from tacit acceptance to violent rejection, particularly of transgender sex workers\". The report also found that, \"LGBT sex workers were frequently targets of aggression, including verbal abuse, stone throwing, and even murder. In recent years, awareness of 'gay pride' increased through positive media exposure, but general attitudes have not changed.\" ==Summary table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Same-sex sexual activity legal | Yes (Always legal) |- | Equal age of consent | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in hate speech and violence | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services | No |- | Same-sex marriage | No |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | No |- | Step-child adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Gays and lesbians allowed to serve openly in the military | |- | Right to change legal gender | |- | Access to IVF for lesbians | No |- | Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples | No |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No |} ==See also== *Human rights in Madagascar *LGBT rights in Africa == References == ==External links== *UK government travel advice for Madagascar: Local laws and customs Madagascar Madagascar Category:LGBT in Madagascar Category:Malagasy law Category:Human rights in Madagascar Category:Politics of Madagascar ",
