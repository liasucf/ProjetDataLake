    "text": "Ajax High School (AHS) is located in Ajax, Ontario, Canada within the Durham District School Board. It is the largest secondary school in southern Ajax and the fourth-largest in all of Ajax. The school offers a wide range of academic and extracurricular activities. The school also offers a French Immersion program. Ajax High School was given a 5.5 (out of 10) rating in 2012/13 and ranked 478th out of 740 schools across Ontario. The school was opened in 1956 and has since undergone several large expansions. In the 1960s, a large section that today houses the main office, cafetorium, front entrance, courtyard, as well as several classrooms, was added. Later, in the early 2000s, a wing was added to the east side of the building. Many of these classrooms are now devoted to mathematics and science courses. In recent years, many students have expressed a desire to change the team mascot from the \"Rams\" to the \"Battleships\", in honour of the World War II vessel that the town was named after. ==See also== *List of high schools in Ontario ==References== == External links == * Ajax High School * Ajax Tumblr Category:High schools in the Regional Municipality of Durham Category:Ajax, Ontario Category:1956 establishments in Ontario Category:Educational institutions established in 1956 ",
