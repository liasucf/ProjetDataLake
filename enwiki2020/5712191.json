    "text": "Fructose 6-phosphate (sometimes called the Neuberg ester) is a derivative of fructose, which has been phosphorylated at the 6-hydroxy group. It is one of several possible fructosephosphates. The \u03b2-D-form of this compound is very common in cells.Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. \"Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry\" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. . The great majority of glucose is converted to fructose 6-phosphate upon entering a cell. Fructose is predominantly converted to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase following cellular import. ==History== The name Neuberg ester comes from the German biochemist Carl Neuberg. In 1918, he found that the compound (later identified as fructose 6-phosphate) was beproduced by mild acid hydrolysis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.Fruton, Joseph S. Proteins, Enzymes, Genes: The Interplay of Chemistry and Biology. Yale University Press: New Haven, 1999. p 292 ==In glycolysis== Fructose 6-phosphate lies within the glycolysis metabolic pathway and is produced by isomerisation of glucose 6-phosphate. It is in turn further phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. {| style=\"background: white; text-align:center;\" |- | style=\"background:lightgreen\" | \u03b1--glucose 6-phosphate | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:pink; width:75px\" | Phosphoglucose isomerase | style=\"background:lightgreen\" | \u03b2--fructose 6-phosphate | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:pink; width:75px\" | Phosphofructokinase-1 | style=\"background:lightgreen\" | \u03b2--fructose 1,6-bisphosphate |- | rowspan=\"5\" | image:alpha-D-glucose-6-phosphate_wpmp.png | colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:75px\" | | rowspan=\"5\" | image:beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate_wpmp.png | colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:75px\" | | rowspan=\"5\" | image:beta-D- fructose-1,6-bisphosphate_wpmp.png |- | | | ATP | ADP |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:75px\" | 75px | colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:75px\" | 75px |- | | | Pi | H2O |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:75px\" | | colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:75px\" | |- | | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:pink; width:75px\" | Phosphoglucose isomerase | | colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:pink; width:75px\" | Fructose bisphosphatase | align=\"right\" | |} ==See also== * Mannose phosphate isomerase ==References== Category:Monosaccharide derivatives Category:Organophosphates Category:Phosphate esters ",
