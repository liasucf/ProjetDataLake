    "text": "The Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs (\u5341\u7f85\u5239\u5973), sometimes translated as the misnomer ten demon daughters or ten demonesses are a group of r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs who take on the role of tutelary deities in Mahayana Buddhism. Along with the yakshi mother H\u0101r\u012bt\u012b, they are said to be votaries of those who uphold the Lotus Sutra. They are particularly popular in the Tendai and Nichiren schools. They are also attendants of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra. ==Summary== The Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs appear in the Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b chapter of the Lotus Sutra. Some of these figures are found sporadically in texts throughout the Buddhist canon, most notably the Mah\u0101may\u016br\u012b Vidyar\u0101j\u00f1\u012b Sutra. They are also recognized as attendants of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, which has become a popular theme in East Asian Buddhist painting and statuary. Esoteric tradition recognizes the r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs as avatars of respective Buddhas and bodhisattvas from whom they are believed to have manifested. Accounts vary among texts and school of thought. In Japan, a common account is derived from the \u2018\u2019Esoteric Samaya Sutra of the Sam\u0101dhi Samaya of the Lotus Sutra\u2019\u2019 (\u5999\u6cd5\u84ee\u83ef\u7d4c\u4e09\u6627\u4e09\u6627\u8036\u79d8\u5bc6\u4e09\u6469\u8036\u7d4c). The Chinese names of each r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b differs between Kumarajiva and Xuanzang's translations. The former tends toward transliterated Sanskrit while the latter translated the meanings of the respective goddesses' names. The names of the r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Sanskrit !! Chinese !! Japanese !! Korean !! Vietnamese !! Tibetan (Wly. !!

One canonical text, the \"Law of the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs of the Lotus\" (\u6cd5\u83ef\u5341\u7f85\u524e\u6cd5; pinyin: f\u01cehu\u00e1 sh\u00edlu\u00f3sh\u0101 f\u01ce; Japanese: hokke-j\u016brasetunyo-h\u014d) stands out with its description of the physical features of the goddesses. Alternative forms tend to stem from Japanese Buddhist art manuals or local traditions throughout Asia. *Lamb\u0101 has a form like that of a yak\u1e63a with blue garments and a flesh tone face.

The plot follows a kishin named Hikohane who arrives at the shore of Tsushima Island after an ordeal in a violent storm. The Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs entreat Hikohane to return to his homeland, to which he responds by engaging them in battle. Incidentally, there is a legend in Iwami that the local goddess Munasukihime is a manifestation of the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs. ===Noh=== A y\u014dkyoku titled \"\u014cyashiro\" (\u5927\u793e) features a dance performed by the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs. The Kaich\u016b y\u014dkyoku zensh\u016b, Volume 1, compiled by Nogami Toyoichir\u014d states that although the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs were originally a group of ten fearsome demonnesses, folk tradition has it that they are the daughters born from the union of Susanoo-no-Mikoto and a dragon. ===Shinto shrines=== The influence of shinbutsu sh\u016bg\u014d in Japan has prompted the worship of these goddesses at some Shinto shrines. These shrines are given the title J\u016brasetsunyo-sha (\u5341\u7f85\u5239\u5973\u793e; lit. \"Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs shrines\"). *Hinomisaki Shrine (\u65e5\u5fa1\u7895\u795e\u793e) in Izumo, Shimane *Nagasaki Shrine (\u9577\u5d0e\u795e\u793e) in Toshima, Tokyo *Kasuga Shrine (\u6625\u65e5\u795e\u793e), on the grounds of Jufuku-ji in Nerima, Tokyo ===Other=== Sanb\u014d K\u014djin (\u4e09\u5bf6\u8352\u795e) is a deity who is believed in some Buddhist circles to be an alternate form of the Ten R\u0101k\u1e63as\u012bs. The Gogikuden \u5fa1\u7fa9\u53e3\u50b3 of Nichiren Buddhism explains that while he is not a follower of the Lotus Sutra, he remains a protector deity for those who are. ==See also== *R\u0101k\u1e63asa *List of Rakshasas *Dharmapala ==References== Category:Buddhist enumerations by number (10) Category:Buddhist goddesses Category:Dharmapalas Category:Rakshasa ",
