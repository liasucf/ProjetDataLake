    "text": "First book in the series Nate the Great is a series of more than two dozen children's detective stories written by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat featuring the eponymous boy detective, Nate the Great. Sharmat and illustrator Marc Simont inaugurated the series in 1972 with Nate the Great, a 60-page book published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, and Simont illustrated the first twenty books, to 1998. Some numbers were jointly written with Sharmat's sister Rosalind Weinman, husband Mitchell Sharmat or sons Craig Sharmat and Andrew Sharmat, and the last six were illustrated by Martha Weston or Jody Wheeler \"in the style of Marc Simont\". Several of the books have been adapted as television programs, one of which won the Los Angeles International Children's Film Festival Award (Nate the Great Goes Undercover). The New York Public Library named Nate the Great Saves the King of Sweden (1997, number 19) one of its \"100 Titles for Reading and Sharing\". Nate is a detective, a child version of Sam Spade. He solves crimes with his dog, Sludge, introduced in the second case, Nate the Great goes Undercover (1974). Regarding the series Marjorie Sharmat calls husband Mitchell \"always my first editor, and it's been a very happy collaboration\". Regarding all of their writing, Mitchell Sharmat once told Something About the Author (quoted by Greenville Public Library): > ==Characters== The character Nate was \"inspired\" by Nathan Weinman, father > of Marjorie Sharmat, who had previously \"featured\" her mother and sister in > a novel. She \"named the other characters in the [first] book after\" other > relatives: Annie, Rosamond, and Harry after mother Anne, sister Rosalind, > and uncle Harry. It was the writer's third book published, five years after > her first. There are several continuing characters beside Nate and his dog > Sludge. * Annie, owner of the fierce dog Fang * Oliver, described as a pest > * Rosamond, strange owner of four cats (Super Hex, Big Hex, Plain Hex, and > Little Hex) * Esmeralda, described as wise * Finley and Pip, occasional > adversaries Rosamond is featured in the third episode, Nate the Great and > the Lost List (1978). She has long black hair and a short black dress, white > mary jane shoes, four black cats of different sizes, and she is frequently > described as \"strange\". In particular, she is introduced thus in the first > book: \"Rosamond did not look hungry or sleepy. She looked like she always > looks. Strange.\" That text and Simont's illustration allegedly inspired the > creation of Emily the Strange.
