    "text": "Cadellia is a monotypic genus of trees in the botanical family Surianaceae. The sole species, Cadellia pentastylis, commonly known as ooline, is a medium to large tree with bright green leaves and rough tile-pattern bark. It has rain forest origins dating from the Pleistocene Era when much of Australia was wetter than it is today. It grows on moderately fertile soils, preferably those suited for agriculture or pasture development. Due to extensive forest clearing, it is now considered a vulnerable plant in Australia. == Description == The Cadellia tree grows to be about 10 m - rarely 25 m in height. It has leaves that are alternate, undivided and obovate or \"oval\" in shape. Flowering occurs from about October to December. The flowers have five white petals, about 5\u20137 mm in length. The ooline's fruit is brownish, wrinkled, and remains surrounded by five red sepals at its base. Fruiting generally occurs from November to December. The fruit's edibility for humans is not stated. == Distribution == Cadellia pentastylis is listed as vulnerable under the Australian Environment and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Small and typically fragmented stands of Ooline may be found in scattered localities on the lower western slopes of Australia's great dividing range between latitudes of 24\u00baS to 30\u00baS. Populations are known from the North Western Slopes of NSW, such as around Tenterfield, Terry Hie Hie, Gunnedah and Moree. Ooline can also be found in Sundown National Park and Tregole National Park in Queensland. == Taxonomy == The Cadellia is one of four sections of the Fables clade. Its pollen is prolate spheroidal, striate with a granular aperture surface membrane. Pollen morphology has linked the Surianaceae in a clade comprising Polygalaceae, Fabaceae, and Quillaja. There are also strong genetic affinities between the Mexican endemic genus Recchia and Cadellia. These can be determined by different types of microscopy, such as; light microscopy, scanning electro microscopy, transmission electro microscopy. == Gallery == Image:Ooline - silhouette Terry Hie Hie.jpg|Ooline - Gamilaroi Nature Reserve, NSW Image:Tregole NP Black Orchids DSC03273.JPG|Black Orchids growing on Ooline - Tregole National Park Image:Ooline - base soil moss at Terry Hie Hie.jpg|Base of an Ooline thicket, with associated mosses - Gamilaroi Nature Reserve, NSW image:Trgole NP Ooline Trees DSC03274.JPG|Stand of Cadellia pentastylis in Tregole National Park ==References== * WOS:000227860100005 / Pollen morphology of families Quillajaceae and Surianaceae (Fabales) * WOS:A1995TM23000006 / A reassessment of the familial affinity of the Mexican genus Recchia Mocino & Sesse ex DC * PlantNET - The Plant Information Network System of Botanic Gardens Trust, Sydney, Australia * Curran, T.J. & Curran, S.R.
