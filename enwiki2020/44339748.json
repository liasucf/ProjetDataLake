The frame dwelling dates to the mid-19th century, and is a two-story cubicle house sheathed in weatherboard with a hipped roof. The vernacular Greek Revival interior features extraordinary painted decoration in the entrance and stairhalls. The decoration is attributed to Edward Zoeller, a Bavarian fresco painter, who also decorated the Redmond-Shackelford House. Also on the property is a contributing outbuilding. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Greek Revival houses in North Carolina Category:Houses in Edgecombe County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Edgecombe County, North Carolina ",
