    "text": "', provisional designation , is a trans-Neptunian object and possible dwarf planet in the scattered disc, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 18 April 2010, by the Pan-STARRS 1 survey at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, United States. == Orbit and classification == orbits the Sun at a distance of once every 380 years and 8 months (139,042 days; semi-major axis of ). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Haleakala in April 2010. According to Michael Brown it is a \"highly likely\" dwarf planet. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 25 September 2018 (). As of 2018, it has not been named. == Physical characteristics == According to astronomer Michael Brown, measures 615 kilometres in diameter, based on an absolute magnitude of 4.2, with an assumed albedo of 0.10, respectively. The Johnston's Archive claims a 770 km diameter, but does not state magnitude or albedo; if it is assumed to use the 3.8 magnitude given by the MPC and JPL (themselves without albedo estimates), this would correspond to an albedo of approx 0.092. On 25 February 2019, a stellar occultation by was observed in New Zealand. From these observations, a lower limit of 575 km was placed for its mean diameter. , no physical characteristics have been determined from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. == References == == External links == * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (520001)-(525000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 523692 523692 523692 20100418 ",
