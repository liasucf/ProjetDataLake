    "text": "Platypodiella spectabilis, known as the gaudy clown crab, or simply clown crab is a small species of crab in the family Xanthidae that is native to the Gulf of Mexico. == Description == P. spectabilis is relatively small, with a carapace of up to 3 cm in width. The shell is typically bright orange, with bilaterally symmetrical patches of cream with blue rims and dots. This brilliant appearance leads to the crab's common name. == Distribution and habitat == This species inhabits coral reefs in the Gulf of Mexico, typically on or near zoanthids and sponges. They can be found from around 0.5 - 50m. == Human uses == Due to its small size, P. spectabilis is of no use to humans as a source of food. It is instead favoured in the pet trade as an aquarium pet, mostly for its brilliant appearance and easy husbandry. == References == *http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=422143 *https://reefguide.org/keys/platypodiellaspectabilis.html *http://species- identification.org/species.php?species_group=zsao&id;=3841 ==External links== * Category:Xanthoidea Category:Crustaceans described in 1794 ",
