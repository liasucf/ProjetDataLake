    "text": "The , referred to in North American and Australian markets as the Yaris and in Asian markets as the Vios, is a subcompact sedan manufactured by Toyota. The successor to the discontinued Platz sedan, the Belta has increased in size over the previous generation such that its interior volume is comparable to the E120 series Corolla. The Belta went on sale in Japan on 28 November 2005 equipped with 1.0 to 1.3 L engines and was available at Toyota dealership Toyopet Store. Export sales began in 2006, with most markets received a 1.5 L 1NZ-FE engine as standard fitment. The Belta is sold as the second generation Vios in China, Taiwan and selected Southeast Asian countries. In the United States, Canada, Middle East and Australia, it is marketed as the Yaris Sedan, replacing the Echo sedan that was built in Japan. The name \"Belta\" is a contraction of the Italian words \"bella gente\", or \"beautiful people\". __TOC__ == Drivetrain == The XP90 Vitz and Belta share underpinnings with each other including the drivetrain and platform. However, while the Vitz was designed at Toyota's French design studios, the Belta was designed at Toyota's Japanese design studios\u2014design projects for similar cars marketed toward different demographics. While the outgoing Vitz and Platz models look and feel very much alike, the newer Vitz hatchback and Belta sedans are more subtly related. No sheetmetal is shared between the two, and although both have a similar centralized dashboard design (Toyota's efforts to standardize the design for all markets, left or right hand drive) there are some cosmetic differences. The Belta is the only subcompact sedan which is designed, built and sold in Japan, and has no direct competitors in the Japanese domestic market, as the Vitz's competitors do not offer sedan versions at the time. == Markets == === Asia === For most Asian markets (except Japan, Hong Kong and Macau), the Belta was sold as the second generation Vios which was built and assembled in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. It was launched in April 2007. For the Japanese, American and Middle Eastern markets (except Israel, Morocco, Korea, Russia and Europe), the Belta is built in Japan. The model code for cars with 1.5 L 1NZ-FE engines is \"NCP93\" and is only available where the Yaris/Vios is marketed. As was the first generation Vios, the second generation Vios is assembled at Thailand's Toyota Gateway Plant and also at the Philippines Santa Rosa, Laguna Plant. The second generation Vios is the best-selling car in Southeast Asia in 2009. ==== Japan ==== The Japanese market Belta had three engine variants available, namely the 1.0 L 1KR-FE straight-three engine and two variants of the 1.3 L 2NZ-FE/2SZ-FE engine rated at . The 2SZ-FE engine comes with Super CVT-i transmission while the 2NZ-FE engine has a Super ECT transmission. An optional S Package is also available across the three variants.

The major difference of the Vios in China is that the larger capacity models are powered by the 1.6 L 4ZR- FE engine with Dual VVT-i. The engine system adjusts timing on both intake and exhaust camshafts. Unlike other markets, Mainland China uses version naming as follows: * 1.3GL-i (Standard - automatic or manual) * 1.3GL-i Special (Standard - automatic or manual) * 1.6GL-i Special (Leather seats with sunroof) * 1.6GL-S Sports AT * 1.6GLX-i (Sports - like GL-S, but with kit and dark interior) File:Toyota Vios XP90 01 China 2012-04-28.jpg|Toyota Vios (pre-facelift, China) File:Toyota Vios XP90 02 China 2012-04-28.jpg|Toyota Vios (pre-facelift, China) ==== Philippines ==== In the Philippines, the second generation Vios was launched in 2007 in 3 trim levels: 1.3 J, 1.3 E and 1.5 G. All trim levels were available with a 5-speed manual transmission, the G trim also with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1.5 G Limited XX Edition was released in July 2008. This is the same as the G trim, but came with HID headlights, 17-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels and a small rubber spoiler. The 1.5 S also got this spoiler and different 17-inch Rota Bolognia Mags with 205/45 tires. The G XX Limited and S trims were released in different colour schemes. A facelifted model was launched on 6 April 2010, with a redesigned front grille, redesigned headlamp and tail lamp assemblies, and redesigned 15-inch alloy wheels (for the G trim). It was available in three trim levels: the base 1.3 J mated to a 5-speed manual transmission, the 1.3 E, with the choice of a 5-speed manual or the now available 4-speed automatic transmission, and the 1.5 G, with the choice of a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. For 2012, a 1.3 L engine for the G trim was released, and it was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission, then later a 5-speed manual transmission equipped with fog lights, steering wheel audio controls and power adjusting side mirrors. Also available from 2012 was a trim lower than the J trim called the 1.3 Base which came only in a 5-speed manual transmission. In 2013, the 1.5 TRD Sportivo trim was released. During its entire period on the market, the second generation Vios was the best selling car in the Philippines helping Toyota to maintain its status as the best selling brand in the country. ==== Indonesia ==== The second generation Vios was officially launched to the Indonesian market on 11 April 2007. The Indonesian Vios can be distinguished from other countries' models with its V-shaped grille ornament, which is optional for the Yaris Hatchback. Like the outgoing NCP42, the NCP93 Vios is offered in E (with manual transmission only) and G (with either manual or automatic transmission) trim levels. All trim levels come equipped with ABS and analog instrument panel. The E trim has rear drum brakes and the G trim comes with all discs. The higher-grade G trim has standard front and rear fog lamps, audio control on the steering wheel, auto- leveling HID headlamps, multi-information display and back sonar. Start/Stop push button is only available on the G trim with automatic transmission. For the facelifted model, the Indonesian Vios no longer featured V-shaped grille ornament. It now has the same appearance as other countries' models. In addition to the regular trim levels, there is also TRD Sportivo model based on the G trim which adds an all-round body kit to the exterior and comes fitted with AV DVD player with Navi Ready.

The Vios is powered exclusively by the 1NZ-FE 1.5 L four- cylinder engine with VVT-i, which included a redesigned air intake and exhaust system to improve low to mid-range torque. It was also fitted with the Super ECT four-speed automatic with the same gear ratios as its predecessor, but with improved programming for the transmission control unit. Electric power steering was offered in place of the hydraulic system in its predecessor. The second generation Vios was made available in four trim levels for the Malaysian market: J, E, G and S. The J is the base version. It was initially unavailable at the Malaysian Vios launch in October 2007, but was introduced on 1 July 2008, offering a choice of either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions. The E and G differ mostly in terms of equipment levels and are mechanically identical, both sharing the 4-speed Super ECT transmission. On 29 June 2011, the G Limited was introduced offering a body kit, 15-inch alloy wheels and leather seats. The S is an addition featuring cosmetic enhancements, including a front bumper spoiler, side skirts, rear skirt and a bootlid spoiler. The interior received a dark grey/black trim treatment and an Optitron meter with a multi-information display, as opposed to the E and G trims' conventional backlit display. The S trim was the most expensive Vios variant. On 17 June 2009, UMW Toyota launched the Vios 1.5 TRD Sportivo which effectively replaced the S trim. It featured a body kit, Enkei wheels, various interior trim improvements and an optional sports suspension kit. The Vios TRD Sportivo was updated on 29 June 2011, featuring a redesigned grille, unique alloy wheels and leather seats. On 15 April 2010, the Vios received a facelift in Malaysia, offering mostly cosmetic improvements. The Vios was updated on 21 June 2012 in response to Honda Malaysia's facelift of the City, with appearance changes without significant mechanical improvements. All model grades included ABS with EBD and BA at the October 2007 launch, but the E trim was only offered with a single driver's airbag, whereas the G and S trims had an additional passenger airbag. The J trim had no airbags at all upon its July 2008 launch, but was nonetheless offered with ABS + EBD and BA. The J trim later received a driver's airbag in its 2010 facelift and a front passenger airbag in its 2012 update. The Malaysian Vios is assembled locally by ASSB, a subsidiary of UMW Toyota, in Shah Alam, Selangor. The Vios has since become the best selling non-national badged vehicle in Malaysia, achieving record sales in 2012.

The J trim is the lowest version and comes standard with a CD/MP3/WMA player with 4 speakers, keyless entry, ABS/EBD/BA (on front disc brakes only), driver-only SRS airbag and interior fabric with dark grey colour seats. The E trim is the only manual variant after the local dealer discontinued the manual J variant in Singapore. The E Classic includes an additional SRS airbag for the front passenger and side moulding. There is another variant of the E trim known as the Elegance that includes leather seats and fog lights. The G trim is the top-of-the-line version available in Singapore and comes with an automatic transmission. The G trim adds a 6-speaker CD/MP3 player, optitron meters, four-wheel disc brakes, and 60:40 split foldable rear seats. Optional \"Sport\" and \u201cRacing\u201d bodykit were offered and aftermarket alloy wheels that were added by the Toyota dealership in Singapore (Borneo Motors). In 2012, three colours were added \u2013 Grey Metallic (1G3), Attitude Black Mica (211) and Blackish Red Mica (3R0) \u2013 to make 7 colours in total. In 2013, Borneo Motors (Singapore) re-introduced optional TRD \"Sportivo\" sports kit to the E grade which was the only variant available for the Vios. The facelift model Toyota Vios TRD Sportivo (NCP93, Singapore) ==== Thailand ==== Thailand, which currently manufactures the Vios, is offered in three trim levels (J, E and G), as well as two limited edition trim levels (G Limited and S Limited). Thailand is currently the only country that offers all existing grades of the Vios, while export markets are only given a fraction of the Thai range in varying combinations. In addition, certainly the range of equipment in Thai Vios' differs from those in export versions. The J is the basic trim level of the second generation Vios, offering a CD/MP3/WMA player with four speakers, an optional keyless entry with TVSS, ABS/EBD/BA, 15-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, rear fog lamps and interior fabric with dark grey colour seat.

The limited edition S Limited trim features a \"Wrap- Around Aeropart\" body kit, an orange \"Optitron\" panel with a multi-information display, high intensity discharge headlamps with automatic height adjustment and all-wheel disc brakes. Audio systems in all second generation Vios trim levels are equipped with ASL (Auto-Speed Sound Levelizer), which detects and compensates for changes in external noise levels, adjusting volume and tone controls automatically based on the car's speed. Toyota Thailand has also exported the Vios to the Middle East, Australia and South Africa, where it is sold as the Yaris. The second generation Vios has been campaigned in One Make Races in Bangkok, Thailand.

Conventional trim levels are replaced by the more modular convenience, power, and all- weather guard packages. However, the Yaris sedan is also available as the Yaris S, which has standard convenience and appearance packages fitted as standard. The power package on the Yaris sedan offers alloy wheels as an option. Side airbags were optional. The Yaris sedan was sold alongside the Yaris 3-door hatchback, and from 2009 onwards only the Yaris 5-door was available as a hatchback. The Canadian version of the Yaris sedan, is based on the US-market Yaris S with power and all-weather guard packages, but with standard wheels. The regular CE, LE and RS trims used in the Canadian Yaris hatchback are replaced in the Yaris sedan by option packages of B, C, D or Aero types. The B adds all-season tires, chrome trim on the decklid, front and rear splash guards, colour-keyed door handles, blacked-out side window frames, keyless entry and power door locks; the C adds ABS, air conditioning, power windows, colour-keyed mirrors and power mirrors; the D adds both side and side-curtain airbags; the Aero adds alloy wheels, wheel locks, a rear spoiler and a body kit. The Aero, however, has neither air conditioning nor side airbags. The Canadian model lacks the two-tone interior, pseudo-metallic trim on the door panels and the new audio system controls (instead it uses an old design) found on the Japanese and American models. The 2007 Yaris sedan received EPA fuel economy ratings of on the highway and in the city, with a fuel capacity of . However, because the EPA changed the way they calculate fuel economy, ratings were revised for the 2008 model year and the Yaris is now rated at city/ mpg highway for the manual transmission, and mpg city/ mpg highway for the automatic version. For the 2009 model year, all Yaris sedans received updated styling with a new grille, alloy designs, interior fabric, standard side curtain airbags and anti-lock brakes. There are also options such as a leather-wrapped steering wheel/shift knob and satellite radio. === Australia === In Australia, it is known as the Yaris sedan and is sold alongside the Vitz-based Yaris hatchback. The Yaris sedan is available only in a 1.5 L 1NZ-FE petrol engine. There were two variants of the model, namely the YRS and YRX, with the former being the model with the basic necessities. The YRX model features an all-round bodykit and was available in an automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission. The Australian version of the Yaris sedan uses orange blinker bulbs with clear lenses instead of orange blinker lenses. At the end of mid-year 2015, the Australian version Yaris sedan was discontinued due to poor sales with over 27 percent drop. It was then phased out with no direct replacement for the Australian market.

Side- impact airbags, side curtain airbags and ABS are optional on 2007\u20132008 models. Beginning in 2009, front and rear row side curtain airbags along with front seat-mounted torso side airbags and anti-lock brakes became standard. Stability control was unavailable on all models until the 2010 model year when it became standard. According to the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) the Yaris sedan received a \"Good\" overall score in the frontal crash test and a \"Good\" overall score in the side impact test on models equipped with side airbags but a \"Poor\" overall score on models without side airbags. In their roof strength evaluation the Yaris is rated \"Acceptable\" with a strength-to-weight ratio of 3.78.

For the U.S. market, the Yaris sedan was briefly replaced by the Scion iA which was called the Yaris iA for 2017 model year. Two years later, the Yaris iA was renamed again to Yaris sedan. For the Asian market, the XP150 series Vios was launched in 2013 as the sedan counterpart to the XP150 series Yaris hatchback. == References == == External links == * Toyota's press release of the Belta Category:Cars introduced in 2005 Category:2010s cars Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Subcompact cars Belta ",
