It was the administrative seat of the former Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Oberes Geratal. ==Geography== Wilde Gera bridge of the BAB 71 The municipal area stretches along the valley of the Wilde Gera river and its L\u00fctsche tributary, northeast of the Thuringian Forest mountain range and the Rennsteig ridge. The L\u00fctsche Reservoir built in 1935-38 is located west of the settlement. The municipality has access to the Bundesautobahn 71 near the Rennsteig Tunnel at Gr\u00e4fenroda junction, about to the southeast. With a population of about 3200, Gr\u00e4fenroda is the district's fourth-largest municipality, though without town privileges. ==History== Gr\u00e4fenroda was first mentioned in a 1290 deed, located on an important trade route from Arnstadt to Suhl. From the early 14th century onwards, the local estates were held by the Thuringian noble house of Schwarzburg. From 1640 half of the estates were in possession of the Ernestine dukes of Saxe-Gotha, while the remaining Schwarzenburg parts from 1716 were ruled within the principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. The local population was largely involved in agriculture and forestry, but also in copper, silver and lead mining, as well as in glass production. Gartenzwerg museum While in the mid 19th century, numerous people emigrated from the remote area to the United States, the local economy developed in the course of the industrialisation. Gr\u00e4fenroda station on the Neudietendorf\u2013Ritschenhausen railway line was inaugurated by the Thuringian Railway Company in 1884, followed by a railway line to Gotha in 1892. In the 1870s, two local companies began the industrial production of garden gnomes (). After their first appearance at the 1898 Leipzig Trade Fair, these figurines became increasingly popular throughout Germany, with Gr\u00e4fenroda as a centre of manufacturing. Today, a museum examines the history of garden gnomes. From 1858 Gr\u00e4fenroda was incorporated into the Ohrdruf district within the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. It became part of the Free State of Thuringia in 1920. ==Politics== Seats in the municipal council (Gemeinderat) upon 2014 local elections: *Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU): 7 *The Left: 4 *Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 3 *Free Voters: 2 ==Notable people== *Johann Peter Kellner (1705\u20131772), composer and organist *Johann Christoph Kellner (1736\u20131803), composer and organist *Hermann Brill (1895\u20131959), politician ==References== ==External links== *Municipal website *Garden Gnome Museum on visit-thuringia.com Category:Ilm- Kreis Category:Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Category:Former municipalities in Thuringia ",
