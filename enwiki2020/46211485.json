Kaufman cited CAIR's numerous ties to Hamas and extreme statements and actions perpetrated by Elkarra, himself. Boxer \u201cexpressed concern\u201d about some past statements and actions by CAIR, and some law enforcement officials asserted that CAIR \u201cgives aid to international terrorist groups.\u201d Neither CAIR nor any of its leaders have ever been indicted nor convicted of any crime. This revocation was strongly criticized by several organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the California Council of Churches. As a result of the controversy Boxer created, Basim received hate mail, including a death threat, since the controversy erupted. Similarly, in 2010, Ami Bera who was running for a U.S. congress seat, returned $250 of campaign donations to Mr. Elkarra after questions about CAIR's affiliations. Bera was criticized because he \"succumbed to the growing national hysteria about Islam in America and the NRCC's fear-mongering, in particular.\" On April 25, 2015, Ami Bera announced his endorsement for Basim Elkarra's campaign for the Twin Rivers School Board seat. ==References== Category:Living people Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:California Democrats Category:California politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
