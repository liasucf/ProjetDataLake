She was \"one of the most widely read women in France\", and one of the country's most popular women novelists. ==Biography== Born in Pierrebrune, a hamlet of Sainte-Orse, Dordogne in 1841, she transformed \"Pierrebrune\" to \"Peyrebrune\", making it her family name. She was the daughter of Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se C\u00e9line Judicis and Georges Johnston, a wealthy local land-owner. She went to Paris after the war of 1870, and she made her literary debut in the magazine Revue des deux Mondes, where many of her novels were serialised. In Paris, she met Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye, who, after having read her Marco manuscript interceded on her behalf with the magazine editor Fran\u00e7ois Buloz. Peyrebrune wrote for several women's magazines and she also published a number of novels. Intellectually she had interests in both scientific, philosophical and masonic ideas. She opposed capital punishment and her feminism was characterized as \"undeniable and contradictory\". Peyrebrune published fourteen works in the 1880s with the firms Calmann-L\u00e9vy, Charpentier, Dentu, Ollendorff, and Plon. For many years, she served as on the all female jury for the Prix F\u00e9mina literary prize. In 1909, she was one of the 40 members elected by the readers of F\u00e9mina to represent \"A Female Academy\". Peyrebrune's nom de plume started with \"Georges\", after George Sand because Peyrebrune held her work in high regard. The writers Camille Delaville and Rachilde were her friends. Peyrebrune married Paul Adrien Numa Eimery, from Chancelade, signing the marriage license \"G. Johnston de Peyrebrune\"; it was an unhappy marriage and there were no children. She died in poverty and oblivion in Paris in 1917. ==Selected works== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1841 births Category:1917 deaths Category:People from Dordogne Category:19th-century French writers Category:20th-century French non-fiction writers Category:French women novelists Category:French feminist writers Category:20th-century French women writers Category:19th-century French women writers Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Pseudonymous women writers ",
