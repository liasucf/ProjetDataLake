He has won the 2001 Male Vocalist of the Year at the Canadian Country Music Awards, 3 SOCAN Song of the Year awards, 19 CCMA nominations and 5 Juno nominations (all for Best Country Male Vocalist). He also won six awards at the 2004 Ontario Country Performer and Fan Association awards. In 2006, he was awarded the Global Artist Award at the CMA Awards in Nashville. McCoy was also one of the three members of the group The Road Hammers, which has released two studio albums, in addition to charting four singles in Canada and one in the United States before parting ways in 2010. The group later reunited in 2013. == Biography == He was born in Barrie, Ontario and was raised for a time in Camrose, Alberta before his family settled in Anten Mills, Ontario. At around the age of 5, his family moved to Camrose, Alberta, returning three years later. \"The cowboy culture really stuck with me. I just fell in love with the music. For some reason, as a little kid, I had some sort of connection with these guys who were singing about these depressing things,\" McCoy said, citing Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash to lesser known artists like Ed Bruce and Wynn Stewart. \"I just didn't have a voice for rock 'n' roll.\" Jason started playing guitar at age 7 and wrote his first song when he was 12. In his teens, Jason owned a rock 'n' roll guitar and was partial to AC/DC. In the 1980s, he joined a band called Three Quarter Country, which performed at legions, Saturday night dances, and clubs in Barrie, Midland, Orillia and other small towns. Jason won a talent contest in Barrie,Ontario where he was discovered by country music writer Henry McGuirk who later became his manager and arranged for him to travel to Nashville to record an album with producer Ray Griff. He later signed with MCA Records in 1995. On May 1, 1999, he married his longtime girlfriend Terrine Barnes. The couple have two children. McCoy was a member of the country-rock group The Road Hammers from 2005 to 2010, which also featured musicians Clayton Bellamy and Chris Byrne, and earlier, Corbett Frasz. His first album in seven years, Everything, was released on March 1, 2011. On April 4, 2016, McCoy joined the \"Drive Home\" broadcast team of Country 101.1 out of Ottawa, Ontario as a DJ, on air from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m (with costar Nancy Stapleton). == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details !| Peak positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications (sales thresholds) |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:65px;\"| CAN Country |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greatest Times of All | * Release date: 1989 * Label: Airstrip Music | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Jason McCoy | * Release date: June 7, 1995 * Label: MCA Records | 2 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Playin' for Keeps | * Release date: July 8, 1997 * Label: Universal Records | 17 | * CAN: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| Honky Tonk Sonatas | * Release date: August 29, 2000 * Label: Universal Records | 9 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sins, Lies and Angels | * Release date: November 25, 2003 * Label: Open Road Recordings | * | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Christmas at the Grand | * Release date: November 2, 2010 * Label: EMI | * | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Everything | * Release date: March 1, 2011 * Label: Open Road Recordings | * | |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:8pt;\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart * denotes unknown peak positions |} === Compilation albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! style=\"width:18em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greatest Hits 1995-2005 | * Release date: October 18, 2005 * Label: Open Road Recordings |} === Singles === ==== 1980s and 1990s ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Single !| Peak positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:65px;\"| CAN Country |- | 1989 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Slow This World Down\" | 36 | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| Greatest Times of All |- | 1990 ! scope=\"row\"| \"How Could You Hold Me\" | 82 |- | 1991 ! scope=\"row\"| \"She's My Wife\" | \u2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1994 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Your Mama Warned You 'Bout Me\" | 36 | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"7\"| Jason McCoy |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Take It From Me\" | 40 |- | rowspan=\"4\"| 1995 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ghosts\" | 29 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"This Used to Be Our Town\" | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Learning a Lot About Love\" | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Candle\" | 1 |- | 1996 ! scope=\"row\"| \"All the Way\" | 4 |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1997 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Born Again in Dixieland\" | 3 | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"5\"| Playin' for Keeps |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Heaven Help Her Heart\" | 11 |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 1998 ! scope=\"row\"| \"A Little Bit of You\" | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I'm Gonna Make Her Mine\" | 15 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"There's More Where That Came From\" | 18 |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ==== 2000s and 2010s ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
