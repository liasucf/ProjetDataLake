When the monastery was dissolved in 1563, Tzys reverted to Pomerania. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, in 1648, the island of Usedom on which Zinnowitz is situated fell to Sweden, which changed the town's name to Zitz. In the middle of the 18th century, Zitz became part of Prussia. In 1751 the town was renamed Zinnowitz. When the Prussian state fell into financial need because of the Napoleonic Wars, it sold Zinnowitz to a businessman, the merchant F. W. Krause of nearby Swinem\u00fcnde, who in turn sold it in 32 parcels it to a group of colonists. In June 1851 Zinnowitz was designated an official spa.Meyers Reisebuch Deutsche Ostseek\u00fcste, II. Teil: R\u00fcgen und die pommersche K\u00fcste mit ihrem Hinterland, 2. Auflage, Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig 1924, S. 62. Josef Alois Kessler, the last Volga German Bishop, retired and died here. In GDR times, Zinnowitz was the most important bathing resort for Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund tourism. Zinnowitz is one of a couple of possible sites for the mythological sunken medieval city of Vineta. The legend is played out during the summer on the resort's open-air stage. In the forest between Zinnowitz and Zempin, some remnants of the launching pads for testing V1 missiles can still be found. They were used between 1943 and 1945 as part of the nearby Peenem\u00fcnde rocket testing facilities.Documentation on rocket launching pads ==See also== *Vineta Festival == References == == External links == * The Beach Resort Zinnowitz(in German) Category:Spa towns in Germany Category:Seaside resorts in Germany Category:Populated coastal places in Germany (Baltic Sea) Category:Vorpommern-Greifswald Category:Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945) Category:Bezirk Rostock ",
