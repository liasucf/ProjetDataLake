The Wurrundjeri-willam were a clan who occupied the Yarra River and its tributaries. Referred to initially by Europeans as the Yarra Yarra tribe. Other Woiwurrung clans include the Marin- Bulluk, Kurung-Jang-Bulluk, Wurundjeri-Balluk, Balluk-willam. Wurundjeri is now the common term for descendants of all the Woiwurrung clans. *Bunurong (Bun-wurrung): spoken by six clans along the coast from the Werribee River, across the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay to Wilsons Promontory. Referred to by Europeans as the Western Port or Port Philip tribe. The Yalukit-willam clan occupied the thin coastal strip from Werribee, to Williamstown. Bunurong is now the common term for all the people of this language group. *Daungwurrung (Dhagung-wurrung): spoken north of the Great Dividing Range in the Goulburn River Valley around Mansfield, Benalla and Heathcote. Referred to by Europeans as the Goulburn River tribe. Taungurong is now the common term for all the people of this language group.Richard Broome, pp123-125, Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800, Allen & Unwin, 2005, , *Wathaurong (Wadha-wurrung): spoken by 15 clans south of the Werribee River and the Bellarine Peninsula to Streatham.

Referred to by Europeans as the Broken River tribe or Loddon Aborigines. Kulin, or perhaps Kulinic: *Western Central Murray: Madhi-Madhi (Muthimuthi), Ledji-Ledji, and Wadi-Wadi share 80% of vocabulary, suggesting they might have formed a group. *Eastern Central Murray: Wemba-Wemba (Baraba-Baraba, Nari-Nari) *Tjapwurrung (Jab-wurrung, Djabwarrung) as a distinct language is included by Bowern (2011), who excludes Daungwurrung and Baraba-Baraba. *Bindjali, the language of the Bodaruwitj (Bedaruwidj, Potaruwutj, Tatiara) people in south-eastern South Australia, is classified as a Kulinic language by Austlang. ==Classification== Dixon (2002) accepts the Kulin languages as a family, and sees them as forming three languages: *Wuy-wurrung, including Wuy-wurrung, Bun-wurrung, and Dhagung- wurrung dialects (the first three entries above) *Wadha-wurrung (Wuddyawurru, Witouro) *Wemba-Wemba, including Jaja-wurrung, Madhi-Madhi, Ladji-Ladji, Wadi- Wadi, Nari-Nari, Wemba-Wemba, Baraba-Baraba, Wergaya, Djadjala, Wutjabulak, Martijali, Buibatyalli, Nundatyalli, Jab-wurrung, and Pirt-Koopen-Noot dialects ==References== Category:Kulinic languages ",
