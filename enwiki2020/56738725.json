The building was constructed by the Midland Palais de Danse Company and opened as a dance hall and billiard saloon under the name Palais de Danse. The architects were Alfred John Thraves and Henry Hardwick Dawson and the contractors were W. and J. Simons. The building featured a globe and frieze of dancers over the entrance. It opened to invited guests on 22 April 1925 and to the general public 2 days later. It changed its name to Ritzy, then became simply The Palais, then was Oceana and is now Pryzm owned by the Deltic Group. It was refurbished in 2005 by Bignell Shacklady Ewing. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Culture in Nottingham Category:Music venues in Nottinghamshire Category:Nightclubs in England Category:Buildings and structures in Nottingham ",
