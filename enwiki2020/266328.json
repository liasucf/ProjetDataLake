    "text": "Norfolk International Airport is seven miles (11 km) northeast of downtown Norfolk, an independent city in Virginia. It is owned and operated by the Norfolk Airport Authority: a bureau under the municipal government. The airport serves the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of southeast Virginia (along with Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Newport News) as well as northeast North Carolina, and despite the name the airport does not have any international destinations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019\u20132023 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 3,663,996 passengers in calendar year 2018, an increase of 9% from 3,380,902 in 2017. , Norfolk International was ranked as the 70th-busiest airport in the United States and the fourth-busiest in Virginia in terms of passengers served annually following Richmond International, Dulles International Airport and Reagan National Airport. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines are the predominant users of the airport. ==Facilities== The airport covers 1,300 acres (526 ha) at an elevation of 27 feet (8 m). Its main runway, 5\u201323, is 9,001 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m) and crosswind runway 14\u201332 is 4,875 by 150 feet (1,486 x 46 m). An Arriving flights sign Southwest Airlines Checkin CounterBridge that connects the Arrivals and Departures building Baggage claim area The crosswind runway (14\u201332) was closed for renovations on December 19, 2009, and reopened in Spring 2011. The airport's long-term plan calls for this runway to be destroyed to make way for a parallel runway (5R-23L) east of runway 5\u201323, but the FAA grounded the plan in summer 2016 due to diminishing demand, limited space, and environmental impacts. In 2017 the airport had 67,679 aircraft operations, average 185 per day: 39% airline, 27% air taxi, 27% general aviation, and 2% military. In November 2018, 95 aircraft were based at the airport: 52 single-engine, 20 multi-engine, 20 jet, and 3 helicopter. General aviation services, or fixed based operations, are provided by Landmark Aviation with full-service facilities for maintaining and housing private and corporate aircraft. The modern terminal facility offers everything from aircraft rental to sightseeing flights and aircraft repair. Daily scheduled aircraft include ERJ140/145 (United, American), CRJ200/700/900 (Delta, United, American), ERJ170/175 (American, United), A300 (FedEx), A319/320 (United, Allegiant, American, Frontier), B717 (Delta), B737 (Southwest, American, Delta), and B757 (UPS and Delta) ===FAA control tower=== Built in 1995, the FAA Norfolk Air Traffic Control Tower stands high. Operated and managed by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Norfolk Tower handles about 1,100 aircraft per day, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. Radar coverage is provided by the ASR-9 terminal system with a six-level weather detection capability. Also available for use is an Enhanced Target Generator (ETG) lab with two radar scopes to accomplish training objectives, as well as the IDS4 system, a specialized microcomputer network system designed to distribute and display both static and real-time data regarding weather and other rapidly changing critical information to air traffic controllers. ===Gates=== Norfolk International Airport has two passenger concourses: Concourse A (gates A1-A11), and Concourse B (gates B16-B30). American Airlines and Southwest Airlines occupy Concourse A while Allegiant Air, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, and United Airlines occupy Concourse B. International flights are handled at gate A1, however, there are currently no scheduled international flights. Specific gate locations are the following: American A2, A4, A6-A11, Delta B21-B25, Southwest A3 and A5, United B27-B30, with Allegiant and Frontier using common gates of B16, B17, B18, B20.
