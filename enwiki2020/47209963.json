    "text": "The 1979 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat happened on August 3, 1979, when President Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema's nephew, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, overthrew him in a bloody coup. Fighting between loyalists and rebels continued until Mac\u00edas Nguema was captured fleeing for Cameroon on August 18. He sentenced his uncle to death for the crime of genocide against the Bubi people and other crimes committed. Mac\u00edas Nguema was executed by firing squad on September 29, 1979. Teodoro has remained President since then. ==Background== After Francoist Spain granted Equatorial Guinea independence in 1968, a power struggle between Mac\u00edas and Atanasio Ndongo Miyone led to the former assuming the presidency. Ndongo attempted a coup the following year; he was captured and executed, and the backlash to the presumed Spanish involvement in the coup led to a mass exodus of Spanish natives from the country. Mac\u00edas subsequently consolidated national political authority, making himself the totalitarian dictator of the country. Mac\u00edas' reign as dictator was marked by his extensive use of state violence against his political opponents, Nigerian migrant workers, and minority ethnic groups, particularly the Bubi people. An estimated 35,000-50,000 people died during Mac\u00edas' time in power, many of them in mass killings or imprisonment in the country's notorious prison camps, and, by 1979, 25% of the country's population lived in exile. ==The coup== In the summer of 1979, Mac\u00edas ordered several members of his own family killed. This led Obiang and several other members of Mac\u00edas' inner circle to fear that Mac\u00edas was no longer acting rationally. Obiang was Mac\u00edas' nephew, as well as the brother of one of the victims. Obiang, who also served as deputy defense minister, overthrew his uncle on August 3, 1979. The coup was backed by the nation's military and Mac\u00edas' Cuban palace guard; several foreign embassies, including those of Spain and the United States, were aware of the plot in advance and provided financial humanitarian aid in its aftermath. Upon his ouster, Mac\u00edas and his personal bodyguard fled to Mac\u00edas' home village of Nzeng-Ayong and took up residence in a fortified bunker protected by military loyalists. The ensuing conflict between Obiang and Mac\u00edas' forces killed 400 people; it ended when Mac\u00edas burned his personal treasury and fled toward the Cameroon border. A force led by naval commander Florencio May\u00e9 captured Mac\u00edas on August 18, and he and six of his allies were executed on September 29. Obiang has remained president of Equatorial Guinea since the coup. ==See also== *2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt == Further reading == * Geoffrey Jensen. 2019. \"Tyranny, Communism, and U.S. Policy in Equatorial Guinea, 1968\u20131979.\" Diplomatic History. == References == Coup Category:History of Equatorial Guinea Category:Wars involving Equatorial Guinea Category:Conflicts in 1979 Category:1970s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts Category:August 1979 events in Africa ",
