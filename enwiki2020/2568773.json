He is recognized as one of the most popular songwriters of his era. His work was widely appreciated not only in Mexico but also in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Spain. After his death, he has also been recognized in the United States, Italy and Japan. Notable performers of his work include Pedro Vargas who was a friend, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres, Pedro Infante, Javier Solis, Julio Iglesias, Manuel Mijares, Vicente Fernandez, Luis Miguel, Perez Prado, Chavela Vargas, and Natalia Lafourcade among others. Outside the Spanish speaking world, his most famous songs are Granada, Solamente Una Vez (You Belong to My Heart) and Piensa en m\u00ed, which have both been recorded by numerous international singers, including Enrico Caruso, Mario Lanza and Jose Carreras. ==Biography== Lara was born in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz. Later, the Lara family had to move to Mexico City, establishing their house in the borough of Coyoac\u00e1n. After their mother died, Agust\u00edn and his siblings lived in a hospice run by their aunt. It was there that he had his first contact with music. Lara's first musical composition was Marucha, written in honor of one of his first loves. In 1927 he already was working in cabarets. It was around this time that he was involved in an argument with a showgirl named Estrella, who slashed him in the face with a broken bottle, leaving a distinct scar (a Glasgow smile) on his cheek. He subsequently moved to Puebla, but returned to Mexico City in 1928. That same year he started working for the tenor Juan Arvizu as composer and accompanist. In September 1930, Lara began a successful radio career. At the same time he acted and composed songs for such films as Santa. The Eng. Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena, with Agust\u00edn Lara. Lara's first tour, to Cuba in 1933, was a failure because of political turmoil on the island. Later, more successful tours in South America, as well as such new compositions as Solamente Una Vez (composed in Buenos Aires and dedicated to Jos\u00e9 Mojica), Veracruz, Tropicana, and Pecadora increased his fame. By the beginning of the 1940s, Lara was well known in Spain. In 1965, the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, gave him a house in Granada to show his appreciation of Lara's songs with Spanish themes, such as Toledo, Cuerdas de mi Guitarra, Granada, Seville and Madrid. He received additional honors and decorations from around the world. His career was portrayed in the 1959 Mexican film The Life of Agust\u00edn Lara. In 1968, Lara's health began to decline rapidly; an accident that fractured his pelvis further aggravated his condition. On November 6, 1970, Lara died. He was buried in Mexico City. By the time of his death, Lara had written more than 700 songs. A biography of him, \"Agust\u00edn Lara: Vida y Pasiones\", was written by his friend Javier Ruiz Rueda. == Family == Grave of Agust\u00edn Lara Agust\u00edn was a son of Joaqu\u00edn Lara and his wife Mar\u00eda Aguirre y Pino.
