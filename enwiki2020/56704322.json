The team began play in the 1944\u201345 season known as the Baltimore Blades, and were renamed the Clippers from 1946 to 1949. The team name paid homage to local history in the Baltimore Clipper, and the Port of Baltimore. The Clippers ceased operations during the 1949\u201350 season. ==History== The Baltimore Blades were founded in 1944 by the Jacobs brothers, who owned a military uniform supply company. The Blades replaced the void in the EAHL when the United States Coast Guard Cutters hockey team disbanded. Baltimore was affiliated with the Buffalo Bisons in the American Hockey League. Eddie Shore coached the parent team, and was also the Blades' general manager. Former Bison player Leroy Goldsworthy coached the Blades to a second- place finish in the EAHL.

In the 1946\u201347 season, Hank Roy was named head coach, but was replaced with the returning Goldsworthy as Baltimore again finished fourth in the EAHL. Frank Beisler was named the new head coach and manager for the 1947\u201348 season. Beisler led the team to 31 wins and finished first place in the league, winning the Walker Cup. Right winger Charlie Knox led the league with 54 goals, and 86 points; center Dave Maguire led the league with 53 assists, and defender Jack Nixon led the league with 182 penalty minutes in 37 games.
