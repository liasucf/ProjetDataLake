A crucial play of the game came in the fourth quarter with Iowa State electing to go for it on fourth down, coming up inches short. ===at Illinois=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 27\u201337\u20132 | 2005 | W 35\u20137 |} ===Ohio State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 14\u201343\u20133 | 2005 | L 6\u201331 |} ESPN's College GameDay was in Iowa City for this matchup between the #1 Buckeyes (4-0) and #13 Hawkeyes (4-0).

Kyle Schlicher added two field goals in the second quarter and the Hawkeyes lead 20-3 at halftime. Purdue's only first half scoring came on a 44-yard field goal by freshman Chris Summers.
