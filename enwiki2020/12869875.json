    "text": "{| |} The Caproni Ca.100 was the standard trainer aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica in the 1930s. Large numbers of this tandem, two-seat, biplane were built, powered by different engines. ==Design and development== The Ca.100 (nicknamed Caproncino, little Caproni), was based on the de Havilland DH.60 Moth, for which Caproni had a production licence. They revised the wings so that the upper wing was lightly smaller than the lower, and also redesigned the tailplane. Otherwise, its wings followed those of the Moth in having no sweep or stagger. It was a wooden-framed, fabric-covered single-engine aircraft with a square section fuselage built around four longerons, with tandem open cockpits. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage. Fuel was carried, Moth style, in a streamlined tank on the centre section of the upper wing. It first flew in late 1928, piloted by Domenico Antonini, at Milan- Taliedo. Ca.100s were powered by a variety of engines. The most common of these were the Isotta Fraschini Asso 80R and the Colombo S.63, both six- cylinder air-cooled inline engines, and the uncowled Fiat A.50 and A.54 seven- cylinder radials. Other engines in the 60-100 kW (80-135 hp) range included the Walter NZ-85, Farini T.58, Fiat A.53, Fiat A.60 radials and the inline Colombo S.53, Cirrus Major, de Havilland Gipsy, de Havilland Gipsy Major engines. ==Operational history== The Regia Aeronautica received two prototype and 675 production Ca.100s, built by Bergamasche, Breda, C.N.A. and Macchi as well as Caproni. 30 of the Macchi-built examples were fitted with floats and designated Ca.100 Idro. The Ca.100s were mostly used as primary trainers, though some undertook liaison work. Some aircraft were built as civilian tourers, numbering at least eight. Later they were joined on the Civil Register by retired ex-military machines. There were exports to Peru and Portugal. The design was also produced by Caproni's Bulgarian subsidiary as the KB-1 Peperuda (butterfly). Twelve Ca.100s \"PR\" (for Per\u00fa), a derivative with all-metal structure, powered by a 120 hp Kinner B-5 engine, were built under licence by the Peruvian government from 1937. One example of the Ca.100 Idro seaplane version was used to establish a world seaplane altitude record of in 1931. ==Survivors== I-ABOU at Lake Como. The last flying original landplane Ca.100, I-ABMT is ex-military, MM55194. The Aero Club Como floatplane I-ABOU, ex-MM65156, has been rebuilt after a takeoff collision in 2006, flying again in September 2010. At least one replica also flies. ==Aircraft on display== The Italian Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle acquired landplane I-GTAB in May 2007; it is now marked with the registration FIR-9, appropriate to a Ca.100 serving at the Florence basic Flying School in the mid-1930s.
