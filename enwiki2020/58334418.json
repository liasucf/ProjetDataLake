The robot was designed by the INAH for the project called \u201cProyecto Tlalocan, Camino bajo la tierra\u201d. Tlaloc II-TC is a successor of the first robot design for archaeological exploration called Tlaloc I which brought to light the first images of the tunnel in 2010. Tlaloc II-TC weighed 35 kg and discovered three previously unknown chambers in 2013. Its designer, Ng Tze Chuen, was previously involved with developing the Djedi robot that was used to explore small tunnels in the Pyramids in Egypt. ==References== Category:Individual robots Category:Teotihuacan ",
