    "text": "Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated neurotransmitter receptors that are localized to non-synaptic sites on the neuronal cell surface. In contrast to synaptic NMDA receptors that promote acquired neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity, extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are coupled to activation of death-signaling pathways. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are responsible for initiating excitotoxicity and have been implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke, Huntington\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). == References == Category:Molecular neuroscience ",
