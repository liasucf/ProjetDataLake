It was designated special administrative zone between June 1994 and 2006, with the military controlling the area to suppress Hmong resistance and to exploit timber resources. Many Hmong locals fled Laos during this period, taking refuge in Phetchabun, Thailand. Xaisomboun was formally established as a province on 13 December 2013. Since, the development of the hydroelectric power along the Nam Ngum River has led to around 300 families being relocated to Feuang District in Vientiane province. They were not compensated for the loss of their farmland. The province has long been a hotbed for conflict between the government and the Hmong peoples. In November 2015, unrest broke out in the province, killing three soldiers and three civilians. The Laotian government imposed a curfew in the north-central part of the province in early-December, but in January 2016 a bomb was set off at a road construction site near Pha Nok Nok village in Long Cheang District, killing two Chinese officials and injuring another. As a result, on 16 February 2016, Major General Thongloy Silivong, a military officer who is the former chief of the National Defense Academy, was appointed the governor of Xaisomboun to tighten control. On 16 June 2017, another Chinese official was shot dead in the province. ==Geography== Phou Bia mountain from Xaysomboun town The province is mountainous, and to the northeast of the town of Xaysomboun is Phou Bia mountain in Xiangkhouang Province, the highest point in Laos. The principal river, the Nam Ngum, has been subject to a hydroelectric scheme with the creation of a dam and large reservoir and an underground power plant. In March 2014 it was announced that the Chinese company Norinco International Cooperation, Ltd had invested US$218 million in the development, projected to take 42 months. Phou Khao Khouay National Biodiversity Conservation Area is a protected area northeast of Vientiane.
