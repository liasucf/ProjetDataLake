Shirley Barrett, Kriv Stenders, Catherine Millar and Tony Krawitz serve as directors for this season. Of the show's return, Foxtel's Head of Drama, Penny Win stated, \"Working with Seven Productions on A Place to Call Home's has resulted in fantastic achievements for the series.

The second, the wave of liberal change that opened up new social and moral choices for Australians at the time. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Marta Dusseldorp as Sarah Nordmann * Noni Hazelhurst as Elizabeth Bligh * Brett Climo as George Bligh * Craig Hall as Dr. Jack Duncan * David Berry as James Bligh * Abby Earl as Anna Poletti * Arianwen Parkes-Lockwood as Olivia Bligh * Aldo Mignone as Gino Poletti * Sara Wiseman as Carolyn Duncan * Jenni Baird as Regina Bligh * Frankie J.
