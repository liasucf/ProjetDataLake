    "text": "The Chamar Regiment was an infantry regiment formed by the British during World War II. Raised on 1 March 1943, the regiment was initially assigned to the 268th Indian Infantry Brigade, which was part of 43rd Armoured Division in July 1943 and when the division was broken up to form the 44th Armoured Division the Chamar Regiment was included in the new division. During this time the regiment did not take part in any fighting. Later, the Chamar Regiment became part of 23rd Indian Infantry Division. In mid-1944, the regiment's 1st Battalion was committed to the Burma Campaign to fight against Imperial Japanese Army in Nagaland. The fighting lasted over three months, during which time the regiment took part in the Battle of Kohima. During the war, the British Indian Empire pitted the Chamar Regiment against the Indian National Army, headed by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Many Indian Prisoners of War joined Netaji; the most prominent member from the Chamar Regiment was Captain Mohan Lal Kureel. In 1946, the regiment personnel's undisciplined behaviour led to its disbanding by the British government. Since then, many Dalit and non-Dalit leaders like Chandrasekhar Azad Ravan, RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Congress lawmaker Udit Raj, and Rajesh Bagha, the Chairman of Punjab S.C Commission, have suggested that the Chamar Regiment be re-raised. == References == Category:British Indian Army infantry regiments Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1946 Category:Indian World War II regiments ",
