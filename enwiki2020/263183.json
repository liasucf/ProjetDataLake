    "text": "Sir Cameron Anthony Mackintosh (born 17 October 1946) is a British theatrical producer and theatre owner notable for his association with many commercially successful musicals. At the height of his success in 1990, he was described as being \"the most successful, influential and powerful theatrical producer in the world\" by the New York Times.\"The Musical is Money to His Ears\" New York Times, 9 December 1990 He is the producer of shows such as Les Mis\u00e9rables, The Phantom of the Opera, Mary Poppins, Oliver!, Miss Saigon, Cats, and Hamilton. Mackintosh was knighted in 1996 for services to musical theatre. Two of his productions, Les Mis\u00e9rables and The Phantom of the Opera, are the two longest- running musicals in West End history. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph ranked him number 7 in their list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". In the Sunday Times Rich List of 2019, Mackintosh was estimated to have a fortune of \u00a31.28 billion. ==Early life== Mackintosh was born in Enfield, London, the son of Diana Gladys (n\u00e9e Tonna), a production secretary, and Ian Robert Mackintosh, a timber merchant and jazz trumpeter.Cameron Mackintosh Biography (1946\u2013) Film Reference His father was Scottish, and his mother, a native of Malta, was of Maltese and French descent.\"Cameron Mackintosh: Wizard of the West End\" The Independent, 21 July 2001\"Mackintosh wins tourist award for London's starring role\" The Independent, 21 April 2006 Mackintosh was raised in his mother's Roman Catholic faith and educated at Prior Park College in Bath.\"Dance\" priorparkcollege.com, accessed 20 December 2012 He first knew that he wanted to become a theatre producer after his aunt took him to a matinee of the Julian Slade musical Salad Days when he was eight years old. ==Theatrical career== Mackintosh began his theatre career in his late teens, as a stagehand at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and then became an assistant stage manager on several touring productions. He began producing his own small tours before becoming a London-based producer in the 1970s.\"Cameron Mackintosh biography from official site\" cameronmackintosh.com, accessed 20 December 2012 His early London productions included Anything Goes in 1969 (which closed after only two weeks), The Card (1973), Side by Side by Sondheim (1976), My Fair Lady (1978), and Tomfoolery (1980).Rothstein, Mervyn. \"A Life in the Theatre: Cameron Mackintosh\" playbill.com, 30 April 2011\"Production History, Official Site\" cameronmackintosh.com, accessed 20 December 2012 In 1981, he produced Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, then considered an unlikely subject for a musical. It became the hit of the season, and went on to become one of the longest running musicals on both sides of the Atlantic. After the success of Cats, he approached the French writing team Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and Alain Boublil about bringing their musical Les Mis\u00e9rables (then a successful French concept album) to the London stage. The musical opened in 1985 at the Barbican, before transferring to the Palace Theatre. Les Mis\u00e9rables had a shaky start at the box office and a lukewarm critical reception before becoming a massive hit, largely by word-of-mouth and is now the longest running musical and second longest running London production. In 1986, Mackintosh produced Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, which is one of the most commercially successful musicals of all time and has outgrossed record-breaking films such as Titanic and E.T. The original London production is still running and is the 3rd longest running production in London, along with the New York production, which is the longest-running Broadway musical of all time. He produced Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg and Alain Boublil's next musical Miss Saigon, which opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the West End in September 1989.

On 6 December 2017 Mackintosh began previews of Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway hit musical Hamilton in London. It premiered on 21 December 2017 at the Victoria Palace Theatre. ==Influence== Mackintosh is notable as a producer for his transformation of the musical into a global, highly profitable brand, and was the first theatrical producer to recognise that both touring productions and worldwide productions (often in countries where musicals were seldom seen, such as the former eastern bloc countries in the early 90s) were potentially highly lucrative markets which could, collectively, match and even surpass the revenues generated from New York and London productions. Mackintosh has also had considerable success in bringing legitimate theatre directors (such as the Royal Shakespeare Company's Trevor Nunn and Nicholas Hytner) and technicians to the world of musical theatre. Mackintosh's Delfont Mackintosh group owns eight London theatres, the Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales, the Novello, the Queen's, the Gielgud, the Wyndham's, the Victoria Palace and the No\u00ebl Coward. ==Personal life== Mackintosh was knighted in the 1996 New Year Honours for services to musical theatre. His partner is Australian-born theatre photographer Michael Le Poer Trench. They met at the opening night of a production of Oklahoma! in Adelaide, Australia in 1982. The couple live between homes in: London; Stavordale Priory in Charlton Musgrove, Somerset; and the Nevis Estate, on North Morar in the West Highlands. In 2006, Mackintosh was listed 4th on The Independent on Sundays Pink List, a list of the most influential \"out-and-proud\" gay men and women. He was also listed 4th in 2005. Mackintosh also topped The Stage 100 list in 2007 for the first time since 2000. The list recognises the most influential members of the performing arts community at the end of each year. He is a patron of The Food Chain, a London-based HIV charity. His younger brother, Robert Mackintosh, is also a producer. ===Laird of Nevis=== In 1994, Mackintosh bought the Nevis Estate, on North Morar, to the east of Mallaig in the West Highlands of Scotland, covering around . He has since been involved in a long-running dispute with a tenant crofter, over the land use on the estate. As the laird, Mackintosh wants to use the land for building holiday homes, but the crofter says the land is needed for grazing. ==Politics== In 1998 Mackintosh was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party, a decision he later claimed to regret, saying: \"Labour really f****d it up. They were profligate at a time when we were doing well. That's why we have the problems we have now. They didn't save any money for a rainy day. It couldn't have been worse these last 12 years.\" In the 2015 British general election, Mackintosh donated \u00a325,000 to the successful Conservative candidate for Somerton and Frome, David Warburton. In the 2016 EU Referendum, Mackintosh voted for the UK to leave the EU, stating that it was \"not because I don't love Europe - I do huge amount of work in Europe and love Europeans - but there is something wrong with a system where the Fat Controller is not accountable\".The Times.
