It was the venue for the artistic gymnastics, badminton, and synchronized swimming competitions. It is now used as a fitness, swimming, track, basketball, and yoga recreation facility. ==History== The Canada Games Centre replaced the nearby Northcliffe swimming pool and community centre, which was aging and offered fewer facilities, but garnered criticism that the higher membership fees priced some community members out, many seniors in particular. The complex cost about C$45 million and was designed by DSRA Architecture of Halifax. It opened in January 2011. ==Design and facilities== The Canada Games Centre has a floor area of approximately . It contains a field house, running track, 25-metre pool, leisure pool, a fitness centre, multi-purpose rooms, cafes, and social spaces. The building is LEED Silver certified for its sustainable and resource- efficient features. However, it is located in a car-oriented area of the city, necessitating a large surface parking lot and requiring most patrons to arrive by car, hence undermining its ultimate level of environmental sustainability. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 Canada Winter Games Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2011 Category:Sports venues in Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Canada Games venues Category:Swimming venues in Canada ",
