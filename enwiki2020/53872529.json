    "text": "The STARTS Prize is the grand prize of the European Commission that honors projects that demonstrate the successful integration of science, technology and art to contribute to social and economic innovation. Two grand prize winners and up to ten honorary mentions are selected by an international jury each year. One grand prize is awarded for innovative collaboration between industry or technology and the arts that open new pathways for innovation. A second grand prize is awarded for artistic exploration and art works where appropriation by the arts has a strong potential to influence or alter the use, deployment or perception of technology. The prize is funded under Horizon 2020 and is awarded on behalf of the European Commission, Ars Electronica in collaboration with BOZAR and Waag Society. == Winners and honorary mentions == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Prize for Innovative Collaboration !Prize for Artistic Exploration !Honorary Mentions |- |2018 |Amsterdam\u2019s 3D Printed Steel Bridge - MX3D and Joris Laarman Lab |Future Flora \u2013 Giulia Tomasello | * The Institute of Isolation \u2013 Lucy McRae * phosphere \u2013 Rhizomatiks Research, ELEVENPLAY, evala, Takayuki Fujimoto (Kinsei R&D;) * Fennec Turbine \u2013 Maxim Kuzin, ATOM * BLITAB \u2013 the innovative tablet for the blind' \u2013 Kristina Tsvetanova, Slavi Slavev / BLITAB Technology GmbH * Shadertoy \u2013 Pol Jeremias Vila, I\u00f1igo Quilez / Beautypi * Making Sense \u2013 Citizen Sensing Toolkit \u2013 Making Sense Team * ELECTRONICOS FANTASTICOS! \u2013 Ei Wada + Nicos Orchest-Lab * 489 Years \u2013 Hayoun Kwon * Printed Paper Actuator \u2013 Morphing Matter Lab at Carnegie Mellon University * FluidSolids \u2013 FluidSolids\u00ae AG |- |2017 |Rock Print \u2013 Gramazio Kohler Research, ETH Zurich and Self-Assembly Lab, MIT |I'm Humanity \u2013 Etsuko Yakushimaru | * 3arabizi Keyboard \u2013 Hadeer Omar * Blink: Humanising Autonomy \u2013 Adam Bernstein, Raunaq Bose, Leslie Nooteboom, Maya Pindeus * [IGNIS AER AQUA TERRA] \u2013 Yuima Nakazato * Library of Ourselves \u2013 BeAnotherLab * Mimus: Coming face-to-face with our companion species \u2013 Madeline Gannon * nonvisual-art \u2013 Lisa Buttinger * Out of Exile \u2013 Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a, Emblematic Group * Research Institute for Arts and Technology * Sentient Veil \u2013 Philip Beesley * Treelab \u2013 Marcus Maeder, Roman Zweifel |- |2016 |Artificial Skins and Bones \u2013 Artificial Skins and Bones Group |Magnetic Motion - Iris van Herpen | * Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab \u2013 Waag Society * Bionic Partition: Generative Design for Aerospace \u2013 Airbus, APWorks, Autodesk, The Living * Fairy Lights in Femtoseconds - Yoichi Ochiai * RGB|CMYK KINETIC \u2013 ART+COM Studios * SPARKED: A Live Interaction Between Humans and Quadcopters \u2013 Verity Studios, ETH Zurich and Cirque du Soleil * unfold - Ryoichi Kurokawa * V2_, Institute for the Unstable Media * Water-based Digital Fabrication Platform \u2013 Mediated Matter Research Group, MIT Media Lab * WCMC Discover Wall \u2013 Squint/Opera and Hirsch & Mann * We Make Money Not Art |} ==References== Category:European science and technology awards Category:Awards established in 2016 Category:Arts awards ",
