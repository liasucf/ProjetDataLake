Hasan Mahmudi Kamboh captured the city of Meerut from its Raja Mai. Many Kamboh soldiers of his regiment are stated to have fallen during the attack. To perpetuate their memory, Husan Mahmudi erected Jama Masjid in 1019 AD, adjacent to where his Kamboh soldiers fell fighting during attack on Meerut. It was later repaired by Mughal Emperor Humayun in sixteenth century. Hasan Mahmudi\u2019s descendants later built another important building called Sangi Mahal. Both these ancient buildings still exist in Meerut. In later times, the most notable members from Hasan Mahmudi\u2019s family were Nawab Mohammad Khan alias Nawab General Kheir Andesh Khan and Nawab General Kheir Andesh Khan Sani. Nawab Mohammad Khan who flourished in the reigns of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb had built the famous Khairnagar gate, Meerut fort, and many other buildings in Meerut. ==See also== * Muslim Kamboh * Nawab Khair Andesh Khan Sani * Nawab Khair Andesh Khan ==References== Category:11th-century deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Meerut ",
