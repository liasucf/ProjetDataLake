In 1930, two other major aircraft design bureaus in the country were the Ilyushin's TsKB (Tsentralnoye Konstruksionnoye Byuro means \"Central Design Bureau\") and an independent, short-lived Kalinin's team in Kharkiv. In 1935 TsAGI was partly relocated to the former dacha settlement Otdykh (literally, \"Relaxation\") converted to the new urban-type settlement Stakhanovo. It was named after Alexey Stakhanov, a famous Soviet miner. On April 23, 1947, the settlement was granted town status and renamed to Zhukovsky. The Moscow branch of the institute is known Moscow complex of TsAGI. In 1965 in Zhukovsky a Department of Aeromechanics and Flight Engineering of MIPT was established with support of TsAGI's research and knowledge base to educate young specialists for aerospace industry. Among TsAGI's developments are the participation in the rocket Energia and the Space Shuttle Buran projects. In 2013 TsAGI developed a testbench for high-speed compound helicopters with propellers.TsAGI has created a unique test bench for testing high-speed helicopters TsAGI, 13 December 2013 == Heads of the institute == * 1918\u20131921: N.
