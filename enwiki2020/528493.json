The number of deities arranged around the cores varies, but may range as high as 414. The Diamond Realm represents the unchanging cosmic principle of the Buddha, while the Womb Realm depicts the active, physical manifestation of Buddha in the natural world. The mandalas are thus considered a compact expression of the entirety of the Dharma in Mahayana Buddhism, and form the root of the Vajrayana teachings. Japanese Shingon and Tendai temples, in particular, often prominently display the Mandalas of the Two Realms mounted at right angles to the image platform on the central altar. The two mandalas are believed to have evolved separately in India, and were joined together for the first time in China, perhaps by K\u016bkai's teacher Hui-kuo. == See also == *Dharmadhatu == External links == *The Diamond and Womb World Mandalas Dharmapala Thangka Centre *Mandala of the Womb World Dharmapala Thangka Centre Category:Buddhist iconography Category:Mandalas ",
