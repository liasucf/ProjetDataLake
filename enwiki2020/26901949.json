As a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Crossroads GPS's primary purpose is the advancement of social welfare including public policy advocacy, although it is permitted to engage in political spending as well. Crossroads GPS is required to report what it spends, but it is not required to publicly disclose donor information.In Defense of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (Sort of), Mother Jones, Nick Baumann, 11 October 10.

Checked 4/3/12. ===Debate over political activity by Crossroads GPS=== In the 2010 national election cycle, Crossroads GPS spent millions attacking Democratic Senate candidates, and was the top spender in political advertising in Senate races. In October 2010, Democratic Senator Richard Durbin wrote the IRS asking for it to investigate whether Crossroads GPS had violated its tax status.\"Durbin Urges IRS to Investigate Spending by Crossroads GPS\", Senator Richard Durbin press release, Oct 12 2010. Durbin wrote, \"I write to urge the Internal Revenue Service to examine the purpose and primary activities of several 501 (c)(4) organizations that appear to be in violation of the law,\" wrote Durbin. \"[Crossroads GPS] has spent nearly $20 million on television advertising specific to Senate campaigns this year. If this political activity is indeed the primary activity of the organization, it raises serious questions about the organization's compliance with the Internal Revenue Code.\") Republican senators had previously written to the IRS stating that an investigation into the political activities of tax-exempt groups would amount to a politically motivated tactic that would \u201cchill the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201dLichtblau, Eric, \"Republicans See a Political Motive in I.R.S. Audits\", The New York Times, October 6, 2010. In September 2012, the Sunlight Foundation said that donor anonymity was critical to the fund-raising strategy of Crossroads GPS. Some critics accused non- disclosing political groups like Crossroads GPS of filing for nonprofit status solely to invoke the right to hide their donors. In November 2012, The Washington Post reported that Crossroads GPS failed to register as a non- profit organization in Virginia. The non-profit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed an ethics complaint with the Federal Election Commission and a corresponding letter with the FBI, alleging that Crossroads GPS failed to disclose the identities of contributors who donated $6 million specifically earmarked to fund independent expenditures for Josh Mandel's 2012 Ohio Senate race. Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio dismissed the complaint as \"frivolous.\" ===Activity after the 2010 elections=== Crossroads GPS demonstrated its interest in participating in non- electoral policy advocacy soon after the 2010 elections when it began running radio advertisements related to tax policy, urging Members of Congress to vote against tax increases.See Politico story which details the $400,000 spent to urge Members of Congress to block tax hikes. An August, 2012 ProPublica analysis of broadcast television political advertising purchases in the 2012 national election cycle, by category, showed that two tax-exempt, non-profit social welfare groups, Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity, combined, outspent all other categories, including political parties, political action committees, super PACs, unions, and trade associations. ==Other associated organizations== American Crossroads shared office space with American Action Network, a group that promotes \u201ccenter-right policies.\u201d\"American Crossroads Now Targets House Races\", Politico, September 10, 2010. Crossroads Media is a media services company that serves American Crossroads. Crossroads Media is run by Michael Dubke and David Carney, and Dubke also runs the Black Rock Group political consulting firm with Carl Forti, political director of American Crossroads. Dubke and Carney also founded Americans for Job Security, which shares office space with Crossroads Media and at least three other political consulting firms, including the Black Rock Group.\"Under Tax-Exempt Cloak, Dollars Flow to Political Causes\", NY Times, Sept 23 2010. In 2013, Crossroads announced that it was financing a new effort, the Conservative Victory Project, to intervene in the next year\u2019s Republican primaries. Crossroads was not directly involved in the Kentucky 2014 Senate race, but backed Senator Mitch McConnell through a new group called Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. Although the group is legally separate from Crossroads, most of its cash came from Crossroads donors, Mr. Law sits on its board, and the two organizations share a treasurer. Crossroads has lobbied to help set up similar groups in races where its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors.\"Upstart Groups Challenge Rove for G.O.P.
