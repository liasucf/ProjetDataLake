    "text": "EBX is the title given to retrospective box sets from Erasure, released in the UK by Mute Records in 1999, 2001 and 2018. Six volumes of EBX have been released : both EBX 1 and EBX 2 were released in 1999, then EBX 3 and EBX 4 were out in 2001. EBX 5 refers to the box set 'From Moscow to Mars', EBX 6 was released in 2018, and EBX 7 in 2019. Each set presents, in chronological order, five singles released by Erasure, beginning with their debut in 1986 up to 1992 (twenty singles in all). Although cover art was altered (specifically for the sets), the track listings represent all music originally found on the UK versions of their singles (including all remixes and B-sides, found on cassette and CD singles, as well as 12 inch singles). These first four box sets are currently out of print. EBX 1 is currently available for streaming on Apple Music in the UK, and EBX 1, 2, 3 and 4 are now available for purchase in the UK iTunes Store with new Artwork: Titled as Singles - EBX 1 https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/singles-ebx1/id1225752723 and titled as Singles - EBX2 https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/singles-ebx2/id1266826688.
