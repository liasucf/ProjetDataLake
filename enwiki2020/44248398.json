    "text": "Lygten Station is a former railway station in the Nordvest district of Copenhagen, Denmark. Located at the far end of N\u00f8rrebrogade, immediately after it becomes Frederikssundsvej, next to N\u00f8rrebro station, on the border with N\u00f8rrebro, the building is now used as a local cultural centre. ==History== Lygten Station shortly after it was built in 1906 Lygten Station (K\u00f8benhavn L) is the former terminus of the private Copenhagen-Slangerup Railway which opened on 19 April 1906, connecting Copenhagen to the small town of Slangerup to the northwest of the city. The National Romantic station building was designed by Heinrich Wenck, head architect of the Danish State Railways, and got its name from Lygte\u00e5en, a local stream. With its location in open surroundings on the outskirts of N\u00f8rrebro, the station was quite a bit from the city center, but it was supposed to be temporary until the exact routing of the various new railways near Copenhagen that were in planning at the time had been finalized. The railway crossed N\u00f8rrebrogade and continued through N\u00f8rrebro to the old N\u00f8rrebro station which was located where N\u00f8rrebro Park is today. The station in the early 1960s In 1948, DSB took over the rail line. In 1954, its outer portion, from Farum to Slangerup, was closed down. Lygten station was decommissioned on 25 April 1976 when the Farum railway was converted into an S-train line and connected to the rest of the S-train network at Svanem\u00f8llen station. N\u00f8rrebro Bycenter, a minor shopping centre, was later built at the site on the former tracks and platforms. The station building was listed in 1982. ==Current use== The station building has been used as a cinema (under the name Filmstationen) since 2007 and as a culture house since 2008. The activities include concerts, stand-up comedy, film screenings, art exhibitions and literary events. It is also being let out to associations and for special events. The Copenhagen Railway Club meets in the building once a month. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Railway stations in Copenhagen Category:Listed railway stations in Copenhagen Category:Railway stations opened in 1906 Category:Railway stations closed in 1976 Category:1906 establishments in Denmark ",
