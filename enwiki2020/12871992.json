He earned his Associate of Arts and his law degree with cum laude from the University of Visayas (1948\u20131952). He passed the Bar Examinations in 1953 with a fair rating of 83.45%.

Hermosisima Jr. attended post graduate studies of Program for Executive Development at the Development Academy of the Philippines (1975) and at the University of the Philippines Law Center, Institute and Seminars. Hermosisima Jr. began his legal career in private law practice (1953; 1955\u20131966) by establishing the famous Hermosisima Law Offices at Cebu, Basilan City, and Zamboanga City, Zamboanga del Sur. He was Technical Assistant in 1954 of the House of Representatives, Manila, City Councilor, Basilan City (1960\u20131963), Vice-Mayor, Basilan City (1963), Chairman, Eighth Amnesty Commission in 1973 at Mindanao (appointed by the then Secretary of Justice Vicente Abad Santos, while serving as CFI Judge of Basilan City).

He is incumbent Chairman of the Board of Trustees, University of Cebu. He was awarded a Medal of Honor as the most distinguished alumnus of the University of Visayas. ==Aquino-Galman Case== On December 2, 1985, Justice Manuel Pamaran of the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment in Criminal Cases Nos. 10010-10011 acquitting all the 16 accused, who allegedly killed Benigno Aquino Jr.. However, the High Court nullified said proceedings and ordered a re-trial of the cases before the Sandiganbayan (Galman vs. Sandiganbayan, 144 SCRA 43, 1986). In his 177 pages decision dated September 28, 1990, Hermosisima Jr.'s Sandiganbayan found the said accused guilty as principals of the crime of murder in both Criminal Cases Nos. 10010 and 10011, and he sentenced them to reclusion perpetua in each case. The judgment became final after this Court denied petitioners\u2019 petition for review of the Sandiganbayan decision for failure to show reversible error in the questioned decision, as well as their subsequent motion for reconsideration. In August 2004, the said accused asked the High Tribunal to re-open the case, but the last appeal was denied. Supreme Court, Custodio vs. Sandiganbayan On August 21, 2007, (Aquino\u2019s 24th death anniversary), Enrile stated that the case of the 14 soldiers incarcerated for 24 years now, due to the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. should be reviewed for clemency. Enrile paid for the legal services of the soldiers during their trial, and said the soldiers and their family have suffered enough. 15 soldiers of the Aviation Security Command were sentenced to double life imprisonment for the double murder of Aquino and his alleged lone communist gunman, Rolando Galman, and one of them had died. They were all acquitted on December 1985, by the Sandiganbayan' Manuel Pamaran, but the Sandiganbayan's Regino C. Hermosisima Jr. (promoted to Supreme Court Justice and incumbent 3 termer Judicial and Bar Council regular member) convicted them on Sept. 28, 1990. Inquirer.net, Enrile seeks clemency for soldiers in Aquino slay On the 24th Anniversary of the death of Benigno Aquino Jr., Cory stated that she had forgiven the 14 incarcerated soldiers for the assassination of her husband but she would not ever nod to appeals for their release. On the other hand, Andres Narvasa stressed that there was no direct evidence linking Ferdinand Marcos and Fabian Ver to the murder. Narvasa further pleaded for the release of the 14 soldiers since they have suffered enough, and warned that Mrs. Aquino is not a vengeful person.

The first is the charcoal- toned Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum pistol, with a grip made of deer horn, was discovered near the body of Rolando Galman, and was marked \u201cExhibit 32. Its twin or the 2nd gun surfaced when the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in 1986. This 2nd gun, which has the same serial number \u201cK919079\u201d as the first one was marked as \u201cExhibit 12,\u201d and really added to the mystery of Aquino\u2019s assassination. Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Regino C. Hermosisima Jr. in a 177-page decision promulgated on September 1990, incarcerated the 16 soldiers who were already acquitted by Manuel Pamaran's Sandiganbayan. In the 1990 judgment, the gun\u2019s owner was Col. Octavio Alvarez, who retired from the military on March 7, 1985. Both the Agrava Board report and the Hermosisima Jr. court resolved that it was either a .45 cal. or a .38 cal. pistol that was used in killing Aquino, thereby dismissing Olivas\u2019 magnum theory, which pointed to Rolando Galman as the killer and the weapon as the .357 Magnum pistol. The court maintained that it was Moreno who shot Aquino but that he used a different gun. But the real weapon and the masterminds are still unaccounted after 24 years. Meanwhile, the 2 mysterious Magnum revolvers will remain at the Sandiganbayan\u2019s bodega until the return of Capt. Felipe Valerio, the group commander of the Avsecom 805th Special Operations Squadron, who might be the last key to Aquino\u2019s death.
