Subsequently, he was appointed governor of the theme of Smolena in eastern Macedonia. In 1201, he rebelled against the Byzantine emperor, taking advantage of a series of raids and rebellions \u2013 such as those of Dobromir Chrysos and Ivanko \u2013 then occurring in the Byzantine Empire's Balkan provinces.. He was soon defeated by imperial forces under the Emperor's son-in-law Alexios Palaiologos and driven to seek refuge at the court of the Bulgarian emperor Kalojan (r. 1197\u20131207).. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:12th-century births Category:13th- century deaths Category:12th-century Byzantine people Category:13th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine governors Category:Byzantine rebels Category:13th-century Cypriot people Category:Medieval Macedonia ",
