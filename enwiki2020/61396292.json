    "text": "The South Australian Railways C Class Locomotives were built by the Robert Stephenson and Company for the South Australian Railways in 1856. The first locomotive numbered 5 was in service by November 1856, the second locomotive numbered 6 was in service by January 1857. They spent many years with the South Australian Railways and were both rebuilt over the years. They were both withdrawn from service after having a number of years on their service record with No. 5 being withdrawn after 50 years worth of service for the SAR. No. 6 lasted well into Commissioner Webbs era, after being withdrawn in 1926 with almost 70 years of service for the SAR. ==History== Since the South Australian Railways had the new B class tank engines built to run on the new railway line to Gawler, two more locomotives were purchased to also run this service on the lightly laid line. These locomotives were designated the \"C class\" and their range was increased to include stops at Roseworthy and Kapunda due to the opening of the new line extension on the 13th of August 1860. During the construction of the Tarlee line extension these new locomotives were utilised during the works. In 1884 & 1885 both locomotives were rebuilt and put back into traffic, the rebuild included new cabs which were complete with front and side circular windows. The C class worked on the northern lines until they were superseded by more powerful locomotives. No. 5 was condemned in 1906 after a 50 years stint in the SAR, and No. 6 continued to work on the suburban system and performed shunting duties at Mile End and Port Adelaide. No. 6 ended its career after an almost 70-year stint for the SAR and was condemned in 1926, which was right into Commissioner Webb's Era. ==References== C Category:Broad gauge locomotives in Australia Category:Robert Stephenson and Company locomotives ",
