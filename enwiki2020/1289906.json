Its headquarters is located in Kabul. The defense minister is nominated by the President of Afghanistan and the National Assembly makes the final approval. One of the functions of the Defense Ministry is the continuance of disarming insurgent groups through programmes such as the Afghan New Beginnings Programme. These militant groups coalesced from warlords and former army personnel after the collapse of the Najibullah government in 1992. ==List of Defense Ministers== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"2\" |- bgcolor=#cccccc !
