    "text": "John Hollander (October 28, 1929 \u2013 August 17, 2013) was an American poet and literary critic. At the time of his death, he was Sterling Professor Emeritus of English at Yale University, having previously taught at Connecticut College, Hunter College, and the Graduate Center, CUNY. ==Life== Hollander was born in Manhattan, to Muriel (Kornfeld) and Franklin Hollander, Jewish immigrant parents. He attended the Bronx High School of ScienceJ.D. McClatchy, \"John Hollander, The Art of Poetry No. 35\", Paris Review (Fall 1984). and then Columbia College of Columbia University, where he studied under Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, and overlapped with Allen Ginsberg (Hollander's poetic mentor),Yezzi, David, The New Criterion, vol. 32, October 2013. Jason Epstein, Richard Howard, Robert Gottlieb, Roone Arledge, Max Frankel, Louis Simpson and Steven Marcus. At Columbia, he joined the Boar's Head Society. After graduating, he supported himself for a while writing liner notes for classical music albums before returning to obtain a Ph.D. in literature.Keillor, Garrison. Writer's Almanac . October 28, 2006. Hollander resided in Woodbridge, Connecticut, where he served as a judge for several high-school recitation contests, and said he enjoyed working with students on their poetry and teaching it. With his ex-wife, Anne Loesser (daughter of pianist Arthur Loesser; married 1953\u201377), he was the father of writer Martha Hollander and uncle of the songwriter Sam Hollander. He married Natalie Charkow in 1981. Hollander died at Branford, Connecticut, on August 17, 2013, at the age of 83. ==Poetic career== Hollander stressed the importance of hearing poems out loud: 'A good poem satisfies the ear. It creates a story or picture that grabs you, informs you and entertains you.Boynton, Cynthia Wolfe, \"Venerable Poet's Words To a Pop Music Beat\", The New York Times, Connecticut and the Region section, February 10, 2008, p. 6. The poet needing to be aware of the \"sound of sense; the music of speech\".Essay: \"The Poem in the Ear\", Vision and Resonance: Two senses of Poetic Form (1975). To Hollander, verse was a kind of music in words, and he spoke eloquently about their connection with the human voice. Also known for his translations from Yiddish. Hollander usually wrote his poems on a computer, but if inspiration struck him, he offered that, \"I've been known to start poems on napkins and scraps of paper, too.\" Hollander was also considered to have technical poetic powers without equal,Howard Richard, Alone in America: Essays on the art of poetry in U.S.since 1950, 1969. as exampled by his \"Powers of Thirteen\" poem, an extended sequence of 169 (13x13) unrhymed 13-line stanzas with 13 syllables in each line.Breslin, Paul, Review of Powers of Thirteen, Poetry, vol. 145, no. 3, December 1984. These constraints liberated rather than inhibited Hollander's imagination, giving a fusion of metaphors that enabled Hollander to conceive this work as \"a perpetual calendar\".Lehman, David - article in Newsweek, January 23, 1984. Hollander also composed poems as \"graphematic\" emblems (Type of Shapes, 1969) and epistolary poems exampled in (Reflections on Espionage, 1976)Hollander, John - interview by email with Paul Devlin March/April 2003. and, as a critic (in Vision and Resonance: Two Senses of Poetic Form, 1975), offered telling insights into the relationship between words and music and sound in poetry, and in metrical experimentation,Attridge, Dennis, Review of Vision and Resonance: Two senses of Poetic Form, MLR, vol. 72, no. 3, July 1973. and 'the lack of a theory of graphic prosody'.Rothman, David, \"Verse, Prose speech, Counting and the Problem of Graphic Order\", Versification, vol. 1, no. 1, March 21, 1997. Hollander influenced poets Todd LaRoche and Karl Kirchwey, who both studied under Hollander at Yale. Hollander taught him that it was possible to build a life around the task of writing poetry. Kirchwey recalled Hollander's passion: 'Since he is a poet himself ... he conveyed a passion for that knowledge as a source of current inspiration.' Hollander also served in the following positions, among others: member of the board, Wesleyan University Press (1959\u201362); editorial assistant for poetry, Partisan Review (1959\u201365) and a contributing editor, of Harper's Magazine (1969\u201371). and also commenced his other role as a poetry critic.Hollander, John, Review \"Stanley Cavell and the claim of Reason\", Critical Inquiry, vol. 6, no. 4, U of C P, Summer 1980. Hollander's poetry has been set to music by Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, and others;Readings in Contemporary Poetry, December 1995 in 2007 he collaborated with the Eagles, allowing them use of his poem \"An Old Fashioned Song\" to create the song \"No More Walks in the Wood\".Sam Hollander, \"The Lives they Lived\", New York Times Magazine, December 21, 2013. ==Awards and honors== *2006: Appointed Poet Laureate of the State of ConnecticutSTATE OF CONNECTICUT, Sites \u00ba Seals \u00ba Symbols ; Connecticut State Register & Manual; retrieved on January 4, 2007 (term ended in 2011) *2006: Robert Fitzgerald Prosody Award *2002: Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement *1990: MacArthur Fellowship *1983: Bollingen Prize for Powers of Thirteen. *1979: elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Department of Literature *1958: Yale Series of Younger Poets for his first book of poems, A Crackling of Thorns, chosen by W.
