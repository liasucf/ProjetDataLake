In other actions, she allegedly set fire to a door of the Latvian Ministry of Education and was arrested for a political protest in Moscow. ==Early life== Lebedeva is a Latvian of Russian ethnicity who grew up in Daugavpils, Latvia. ==Prince Charles incident== In November 2001 Charles, Prince of Wales, made an official visit to Latvia. Lebedeva, then aged 16, approached Charles as he was greeting people at the Freedom Monument in Riga and struck him with three red carnations. The incident was reported by international mainstream media. Lebedeva was immediately arrested and taken to the Department of National Security. She was strip-searched, interrogated, and charged under statute 87 of the Latvian criminal code, which carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. After three days, she was released from the detention centre and required to report every day to Daugavpils police station until the case came to trial. Lebedeva had intended the action as a protest against the killing of civilians during the war in Afghanistan but forgot to say anything until she was being bundled into a police car. She later told The Guardian: \"I've got no idea what his views are on the war. I saw him just as a representative for Britain\". Prince Charles was on a five-day tour of the Baltic states and privately admitted that the incident had \"frightened me rigid\". However, he made a plea for leniency and the charge was dropped from assaulting a foreign dignitary to hooliganism, which carried a maximum prison sentence of two years. Latvian President Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga and Lebedeva's English teacher had already apologised to the prince. Eventually, the charge was lessened again; Lebedeva was sentenced to unspecified educational measures and put under her mother's supervision for one year. If Lebedeva had engaged in criminal activity or hooliganism, her mother would have been put on trial. Lebedeva subsequently gained the nickname 'Alina Carnation'. ==Later life== Lebedeva was back in the Latvian news in 2004, when she was arrested for allegedly setting fire to a door at the Ministry of Education. The 18-year-old Lebedova and a 23-year-old man were arrested in Daugavpils. She was not charged, but a judge ordered her to be placed in detention for a week whilst the crime was investigated. The arson attack was allegedly connected to a National Bolshevik Party protest against a new law requiring that all schools teach mainly in Latvian. BBC News reported later in 2004 that Lebedeva was amongst the National Bolshevik Party activists arrested after an action in which they invaded the Russian presidential offices in Moscow and hung a banner which read \"Putin go away\". Lebedeva was then jailed for two years. Lebedeva stood for election as a Member of the European Parliament for the Motherland party in 2009. She was the second person on the Motherland party list, after the party's leader Juris \u017durav\u013covs. Lebedeva then renounced politics and returned to her studies. As of 2012, she had earned a bachelor's degree in social pedagogy and was preparing for a master's degree. ==See also== * Katie Sierra suspension controversy ==References== ==External links== * Free Alina Lebedeva Category:Latvian activists Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:People from Daugavpils Category:Latvian political people Category:Latvian women in politics ",
