    "text": "Frederick Monroe Glade (January 25, 1876 \u2013 November 21, 1934) was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1902 through 1908, Glade played for the Chicago Orphans (1902), St. Louis Browns (1904\u20131907) and New York Highlanders (1908). A native of Dubuque, Iowa, he batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on May 27, 1902, and played his final game on June 21, 1908. In 1902 Glade appeared in one game for the Chicago National League team. He jumped to the American League in 1904 and gave four years of good services for the awful St. Louis Browns. In his rookie season he went 18\u201315 with a 2.27 ERA. In addition, on June 19 he set a major league game-record, since then broken, with 15 strikeouts in a 1\u20130 victory over the New York Highlanders. But Glade led the league with 25 losses in 1905, winning only six games with a solid 2.81 ERA. He rebounded with two winning seasons in 1906 (15-14, 2.36) and 1907 (13-9, 2.67). He was traded to the Highlanders before 1908, his last major league season. In a six-season career, Glade posted a 52\u201368 record with a 2.62 ERA in 1072-2/3 innings pitched, including 14 shutouts and 107 complete games. A good control pitcher, he recorded a 1.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio (464-to-237). Glade died in Grand Island, Nebraska, at age 58. ==Fact== *On August 3, 1906 at Sportsman's Park, Glade faced Long Tom Hughes and the Washington Senators, entering the 10th inning with a scoreless tie, until Hughes decided the game with a solo home run to a 1\u20130 victory, becoming the first pitcher in major league history to pitch a shutout and hit a home run which accounted for the only run in the game. ==External links== *1904 St. Louis Browns *Baseball Library *Baseball Reference *Retrosheet Category:Chicago Orphans players Category:New York Highlanders players Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:People from Iowa Category:1876 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Fort Worth Panthers players Category:Galveston Sandcrabs players Category:Cedar Rapids Bunnies players Category:Des Moines Hawkeyes players Category:St. Joseph Saints players Category:Baseball players from Iowa ",
