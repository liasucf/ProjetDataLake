Before being incarcerated, Karen was the bank robber of her time but now she wishes for nothing more than to settle down and start a new life. Unfortunately, between a dirty parole officer, old business partners and an idiot ex-husband, McCoy will have to do the unthinkable to save her son (Zack English) and new heartthrob J.T. (Val Kilmer): another bank job. == Cast == *Kim Basinger as Karen McCoy *Val Kilmer as J.T.

The Real McCoy currently holds an 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 4.13/10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 2 stars, saying, \"... \"The Real McCoy\" took me back to... heist movies where a bank vault was subjected to high-tech manipulations by athletic super-crooks... those same scenes apparently took the film's authors back to the very same sources, since \"The Real McCoy\" recycles the same devices, not quite as well as the originals.\" ==References== == External links == * * * *Google Movie Page Category:English-language films Category:1993 films Category:1990s crime thriller films Category:1990s heist films Category:American films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American heist films Category:Films about bank robbery Category:Films set in Atlanta Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Russell Mulcahy Category:Films scored by Brad Fiedel Category:Films with screenplays by William Davies Category:Universal Pictures films ",
