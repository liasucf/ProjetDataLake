The proposed merger of the municipalities of Diesse, Lamboing, Nods and Pr\u00eales into the new municipality of Le Plateau de Diesse was rejected by voters. However, on 1 January 2014 the former municipalities of Pr\u00eales, Diesse and Lamboing merged into the new municipality of Plateau de Diesse.Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 13 December 2014 ==History== Pr\u00eales is first mentioned in 1179 as Prales though this document is believed to be a 12th-century forgery. In 1185 it was mentioned as Preles and it used to be known by its German name Pr\u00e4gelz. Beginning in the 12th century the noble de Perls family first appears in records. The family existed for several centuries before vanishing from records in the 15th century. Throughout its history the village was part of the Herrschaft of Tessenberg (Diesse). The major landowners in the village included the collegiate church of Saint-Imier and Erlach Abbey. It was part of the parish of Diesse and accepted the Protestant Reformation along with the rest of the parish between 1530 and 1554. After the 1798 French invasion, Pr\u00eales became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Pr\u00eales was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Initially it was part of the District of Erlach but in 1846 it became part of the La Neuveville District. The construction of a cable railway between Ligerz and Pr\u00eales in 1912 turned it into a minor tourist destination. Until the 1950s agriculture was the most important industry in the village. Today many residents commute to jobs in Biel or La Neuveville.
