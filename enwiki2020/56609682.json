    "text": "The Chaudiere River is a tributary of the Normandin River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, into the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada. The Chaudi\u00e8re River flows in the townships of Vimont, Mance, Mignault and Aigremont. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. The route 167 (northwesterly) connecting Chibougamau to Saint-F\u00e9licien, Quebec intersects the lower (i.e., southerly) section of the river Chaudi\u00e8re. The Canadian National Railway runs along this road. The forest road R0210 serves the upper part of the river that it cuts near the mouth of the head lake; it also serves the eastern part of this valley. The surface of the Chaudi\u00e8re River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography == == Toponymy == The name \"Rivi\u00e8re Chaudi\u00e8re\" was made official on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec, that is, at its creation.Commission de toponymie du Quebec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \"Chaudi\u00e8re River\". == Notes and references == == See also == Category:Rivers of Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean Chaudi\u00e8re River Category:Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality ",
