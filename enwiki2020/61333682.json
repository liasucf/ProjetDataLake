    "text": "A cooler is a sweet, often fruity and/or bubbly cocktail for use as a refreshing drink, especially for summer parties. Often a cooler will be light, crisp, and colorful, and have less alcohol than other cocktails. A cooler is distinct from a spritzer in that a spritzer tends to be a mix of wine and sparkling water or wine and club soda, and therefore dryer than a cooler. Examples of coolers include the chuncho cooler (made with Chilean pisco, Galliano, lime juice, ginger syrup, and club soda), the strawberry cooler (made with strawberries, lemonade, lime, mint, and one's choice of Cointreau, vodka, tequila, rum, etc.); the summer mint cooler (made with bourbon whiskey, muddled mint liqueur, simple syrup, lemon juice, and lemon-lime soda), the Citr\u00f3nge Lime Cooler (made with lime liqueur, prosecco, sparkling water, and lime juice), the cucumber cooler (made with gin, lime juice, cucumber, and tonic water), etc. Some coolers are nominally non-alcoholic, but can easily be made alcoholic; e.g. a non-alcoholic strawberry cooler could be a candidate for the addition of alcohol since strawberries are very liquor-friendly. Lemonade tends to be a suitable candidate for the addition of vodka, and incidentally can also be used as a margarita ingredient. Margarita variants themselves are often used as coolers, e.g. through the use of watermelon ice cubes; or yellow peaches; or in the case of the La Paloma grapefruit soda; etc. A cooler that has wine as its alcoholic ingredient is a wine cooler. ==References== Category:Sweet cocktails ",
