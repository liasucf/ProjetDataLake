From 2012 to 2017, the festival was known as The Raptor Filmz Short Scottish Film Festival until the event was rebranded in 2018.Festival listing on Film Freeway ==History and format== The festival was set up in 2012 by Scottish filmmaker Chris Young who is the company director of Raptor Filmz Ltd in West Lothian. The aim of the festival is to promote short Scottish films with a view of potentially setting up a distribution deal with filmmakers. The first festival took place in Glasgow at the Grosvenor Cinema and was hosted by Scottish actor David Anderson. With a desire to bring the festival closer to home, the festival was moved to the Howden Park Centre in Livingston where the date of the festival was also moved to January 2014 rather than December 2013. In 2015, the festival found a new home at the Bathgate Regal Community Theatre which is operated by Scottish actor Scott Kyle. Speaking of the Regal, festival curator Chris Young said: The festival consists of awards for films and individual prizes. The awards are selected by jury with an audience choice award being decided by visitors of the festival. Jury members in the past have included actor Declan Michael Laird and film editor Chris Quick. In 2018, it was announced that Ross Miller, the film critic for The National newspaper would join the judging panel. On 30 July 2017, it was announced that the festival would return in 2018 but under the new name of The Scottish Short Film Festival. The Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow was due to host the 2018 festivalFestival listing on Centre of Contemporary Arts page but due to the fire at the Glasgow School of Art, the venue was forced to close. It was announced on the festival's Twitter account that the Crowne Plaza Glasgow would take over as host. ==Festival award winners== List of winners and nominees of the festival. ===2012 winners=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
