Guitar World. Future US. Retrieved 1 April 2020. It has been certified Gold by the RIAA. ==Background== Passion and Warfare was written based on a series of dream sequences that Vai had when he was younger, and in the guitar music book of the album, Vai sums it up as \"Jimi Hendrix meets Jesus Christ at a party that Ben Hur threw for Mel Blanc\". It was all recorded in The Mothership studio at his home in the Hollywood Hills, a building in which his guitar parts for Whitesnake's 1989 album Slip of the Tongue were also recorded. As such, Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale has small spoken parts on the album; Coverdale, Adrian Vandenberg and Rudy Sarzo are credited with backing vocals. Vai states that planning the album started as early as 1982, but was shelved after joining the David Lee Roth band and not picked up again until parting ways with Roth in 1989. ===Recording methods=== Vai utilized many unusual recording techniques on the album. For what would come to be one of his most popular songs to date, \"For the Love of God\", he fasted for ten days and recorded the song on the fourth day of the fast.\"Interview:Musician's Friend Exclusive Interview with Steve Vai, Part II\" .
