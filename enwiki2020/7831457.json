    "text": "Mortification is the eponymously self-titled debut studio album by Australian Christian metal band Mortification. This album leans more towards death metal than the band's previous demo album, but still keeps itself in the ways of thrash. In 2002, The Billboard Guide to Contemporary Christian Music described the album's sound as \"punk-meets-metal grind-core\". Jayson Sherlock's original cover art (seen above, nicknamed the \"gnarly cover\") was censored by some Christian bookstores; the label shipped them a version with an alternative cover, simply the band's logo. Although not as popular as its follow-up, Mortification became reputive in both Christian and secular metal scenes for its remarkably brutal output. There are two short grindcore songs: \"Turn\" (33 s.) and \"The Majestic Infiltration of Order\" (1:06). The latter is commonly known as \"God Rulz,\" because those are the only lyrics in the song. It is still often played in the band's concerts. Music videos were shot for \"Turn,\" \"Until the End,\" \"The Destroyer Beholds,\" and \"The Majestic Infiltration of Order\" by film maker Neil Johnson. These videos were released on the video compilation Grind Planets. == Track listing == All songs written by Mortification # \"Until the End\" \u2013 3:47 # \"Brutal Warfare\" \u2013 3:58 # \"Bathed in Blood\" \u2013 4:31 # \"Satan's Doom\" \u2013 6:06 # \"Turn\" \u2013 0:33 # \"No Return\" \u2013 2:42 # \"Break the Curse\" \u2013 2:44 # \"New Awakening\" \u2013 5:04 # \"The Destroyer Beholds\" \u2013 3:19 # \"Journey of Reconciliation\" \u2013 4:13 # \"The Majestic Infiltration of Order\" \u2013 1:06 == Credits == Mortification * Steve Rowe - bass guitar, vocals * Michael Carlisle - guitar, backing vocals * Jayson Sherlock - drums, backing vocals Additional musicians * Derek Sean - lead guitar * Roger Martinez - backing vocals * Andrew Tompkins - backing vocals Production * Roger Martinez (Vengeance Rising) - producer == References == Category:Mortification (band) albums Category:1991 debut albums ",
