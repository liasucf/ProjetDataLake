After the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates, the bridge was reconstructed in 1920 after it was moved to Gamji Gate in Kaduna, which at the time served as the new Northern Headquarters. On 16 February 1956, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments declared the footbridge a historic monument. ==Structure== Presently located in the General Hassan Katsina Park, Kaduna, the Lugard Footbridge is made up of iron with other complementing features including handrails and wire gauze while beams, two pillars, girders and concrete are for structural strength and balance.
