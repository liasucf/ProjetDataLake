    "text": "Down to Earth is a fortnightly magazine focused on politics of environment and development, published in New Delhi, India. The Centre for Science and Environment assists in the production of the magazine. It was started in 1992 by environmentalist Anil Agarwal, with a commitment to make people aware of the challenges of environment and development and to create informed change agents. Indian environmentalist Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, is the current editor. The intent of the magazine is to present timely news, research, analyses and provide insight into grassroots-based environmental struggles that were only being sporadically covered in books and research-based publications. A key intent is to bridge the communication gap between science and policy, and between decision makers and practitioners across the wide environment-development spectrum. The fortnightly format was created specifically to supplement the research, analyses and documentation efforts that were being undertaken by its associated organization, Centre for Science and Environment (founded also by the late Anil Agarwal in 1980). The objective / founding principles of the magazine, as envisioned in the first editorial, was to \u2018fill a critical information gap\u2019 rather than \u2018capture a share of the information market\u2019 and to serve as an enabler in a chaotic world. Reportage and analysis is geared to enable an increasingly young India with information and analysis from villages, fields, factories and labs, places where the mainstream media has vacated. In October 2016, Down To Earth launched a Hindi edition of the magazine, with exclusive coverage as well as repurposed content from DTE English edition. The Hindi edition was launched to serve a long-standing need to serve the large Hindi-speaking audiences in the country, especially in the Hindi speaking heartland, and to begin a conversation on environment, development and sustainability concerns with them. The magazine was awarded for its cutting edge reportage in 2017, and its writers have won many national and international fellowships. Down To Earth Books is the magazine's publishing wing. It brings out two annuals: State of India's Environment and State of India's Environment In Figures. This is the country's only annual survey on environment. The later one is a completely data-driven annual statement on state of India's environment published every World Environment Day. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:1992 establishments in India Category:Biweekly magazines published in India Category:Environmental magazines Category:Environment of India Category:Magazines established in 1992 Category:Magazines published in Delhi Category:Science and technology magazines published in India ",
