The oil is used as an extender for sesame oil, which it resembles, as well as for making soap, in addition to its role as an illuminant. ==Countries== The plant was originally cultivated in the Ethiopian highlands but is also cultivated in Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Nepal, India as well as other parts of Southeast Asia.
