    "text": "Cambridgeshire Community Services Trust is an NHS trust was established as part of the programme called Transforming Community Services under which a number of community health NHS trusts were established when these services were separated from primary care trusts. It runs: *Peterborough integrated sexual health services *Cambridgeshire community sexual health and contraceptive services *Luton drug services *Ely musculo-skeletal services == History == The trust was established on 1 April 2010. It was part of two consortium bids for an \u00a3800m older people\u2019s service contract for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Clinical Commissioning Group, first as part of a consortium with Capita and private health firm Circle, and then with Optum, formerly UnitedHealth UK, when Capita opted to withdraw from the process. In April 2015 following the failure of these bids the trust transferred 1,360 staff to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust and 115 to various other providers. It had, however, \u201cwon three multimillion pound contracts during 2014-15 to provide sexual health services in Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as the School Immunisation Programme across Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, Norfolk and Suffolk\u201d. Subsequently the contract collapsed, after just eight months. It was named by the Health Service Journal as the best community trust to work for in 2015. At that time it had 2864 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.89%. 83% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 73% recommended it as a place to work. In 2019 the Care Quality Commission rated the trust outstanding and said it provided \u201cexcellent care and treatment, particularly in its community sexual health services\u201d. ==See also== * Healthcare in Cambridgeshire * List of NHS trusts ==References== == External links == * * Care Quality Commission inspection reports Category:Community health NHS trusts Category:Health in Cambridgeshire ",
