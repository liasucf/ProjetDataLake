The company was formed on February 1, 1937, by the nationalization and merger of Lior\u00e9 et Olivier, Potez, CAMS, Romano and SPCA. ==History== Following the resolution of the 1936 general strike of French heavy industry, the government of L\u00e9on Blum introduced an act to nationalize the French war industry. The act provided for the creation of seven nationalized aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft (SNCASE, SNCASO, SNCAN, SNCAO, SNCAM, SNCAC), and one for aircraft engines (SNCM - Lorraine-Dietrich). SNCASE incorporated the facilities of Potez in Berre-l'\u00c9tang, CAMS in Vitrolles, Romano in Cannes, SPCA in Marseille and Lior\u00e9 et Olivier at Argenteuil and Marignane. SNCASE became the largest of the aeronautical ', with of space in six factories and employees. ( of the workforce came from Lior\u00e9 et Olivier, along with 90% of then-current manufacturing contracts.) In 1941, during the Second World War, the Paris design bureaus of both the nationalized and the private aircraft firms were relocated to avoid capture. SNCASE acquired the failing SNCAM and moved its engineering operations to SNCAM's headquarters at the former Dewoitine factory in Toulouse. During the rationalisation of the nationalised Aircraft Industry during the 1950s, SNCASE merged with SNCASO to form Sud Aviation on March 1, 1957, which in turn was later amalgamated into A\u00e9rospatiale and eventually the EADS group. ==Products== Most early Sud-Est aircraft retained their earlier designations, such as the Lior\u00e9 et Olivier LeO 451 bomber. The first aircraft produced under the Sud-Est marque was the Sud- Est SE 100http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=1512&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= (formerly Leo 50) fighter. As well as fixed winged aircraft work, SNCASE carried out research into rotary-winged aircraft capitalising on the experience gained from absorbing the Liore et Olivier team which had license- built the Cierva C.30 design (as the LeO C.30 and C.301 to C.305 variants), and designing and building the LeO C.34 (derived from Kellett designs). After World War II further work on autogyro's produced the SE.700http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9552&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= and SE.700A multi-seat Liaison autogyros, which were quickly over-shadowed by the rapid development of helicopters. SNCASE continued experimenting with helicopters with the help from a team from Focke Achgelis building the SE.3000, which was a French version of the twin-rotor Focke Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, and the smaller, more conventional, SE.3101. With this experience SNCASE went on to design the SE.3110 and eventually the SE.3120 Alouette which first flew on 21 July 1951 and broke the helicopter distance and speed records in July 1953. Production versions of the Alouette emerged as the commercially successful Alouette II and Alouette III, resulting in production runs of several hundreds, with many exported. Fixed wing aircraft were also developed post World War II, with several jet research aircraft and two significant airliners: The SE-2010 Armagnachttp://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=609&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= and the SE-210 Caravellehttp://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9058&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= airliners. Production licences were also obtained from de Havilland for the de Havilland Sea Venom to provide all-weather and day fighters for the A\u00e9ronautique Navale., with 121 two-seat and single-seat Aquilon 20 / 201 / 202 / 203 / 204 built from 1952.http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9862&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;=http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9073&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;=http://www.aviafrance.com/aviafrance1.php?ID=9863&ID;_CONSTRUCTEUR=1144&ANNEE;=0&ID;_MISSION=0&MOTCLEF;= ===SNCASE aircraft production=== * SNCASE SE.100 * SNCASE SE-116 Voltigeur * SNCASE SE-117 Voltigeur * SNCASE SE.161 Languedoc * SNCASE SE.200 Amphitrite * SNCASE SE-210 Caravelle * SNCASE SE.212 Durandal * SNCASE SE-400 * SNCASE SE-532 Mistral * SNCASE SE-535 Mistral * SNCASE SE-700 * SNCASE SE-700A * SNCASE SE-1010 * SNCASE SE-1210 * SNCASE SE-2010 Armagnac * SNCASE SE-2100 * SNCASE SE-2300 * SNCASE SE-2310 * SNCASE SE-2410 Grognard I * SNCASE SE-2415 Grognard II * SNCASE SE-2418 Grognard * SNCASE SE-2421 Grognard * SNCASE SE-3000 * SNCASE SE-3101 * SNCASE SE-3110 * SNCASE SE-3120 Alouette * SNCASE SE-3130 Alouette II * SNCASE SE-3131 Gouverneur * SNCASE SE-3150 Llama * SNCASE SE-3160 Alouette III * SNCASE SE-3200 Frelon * SNCASE SE-5000 Baroudeur * SNCASE SE-5003 Baroudeur * SNCASE Aquilon ==References== ==External links== * Aviafrance - S.N.C.A.S.E. * Aviafrance - S.N.C.A.S.E.
