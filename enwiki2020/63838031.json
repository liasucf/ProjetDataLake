Most of its mounds are capped by basalt sills, giving them the characteristic black color.Ekaterina E. Plyusninaa, Emad S. Sallamb, Dmitry A. Rubana; Geological heritage of the Bahariya and Farafra oases, the central Western Desert of Egypt, Journal of African Earth Sciences (2016). ==Geology== The mounds of the Black Desert, up to 100 m high, vary in size, composition, height, and shape as some are dark consisting of iron quartzite while others are more reddish as its surface rocks consist of iron sandstone. On the outskirts of the Black Desert are volcanic hills proving the eruption of dark volcanic dolerite, dating back to the Jurassic period 180 million years ago.A.M. Afify, M.E. Sanz-Montero, J.P.
