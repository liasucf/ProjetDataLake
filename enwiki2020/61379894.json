The eleventh edition of the event took place on the 25th of August 2019. == Overview == Guwahati Half Marathon was organized for the first time in August, 2009 under the Social Initiatives Module of Techniche, the annual Techno-Management festival of IIT Guwahati. The event received a great response from the Guwahati populace, with over 1000 participants in the two races organized - The Glory Run (18 km) and The Dream Run (6 km). In 2010, Techniche introduced a 21-km cycle race with the motto of shaping the youth's attitude towards the environment with the motto \"Youth for environment\". As the years unfolded, the initiative grew, now standing as the largest of its kind in North-East India. Also in the same year, a new marathon was introduced, namely, the Courage Run for specially-abled participants. The marathon continues to grow every year, with a new vision each year, including - \"Run for Digital India\" (in 2018), \"Run for Organ Donation \u2013 Live Life Give Life\" (in 2017), \"Run for Peace\" (in 2015), \"Run to affect the shift\" (in 2014) and \"Run for a better tomorrow\" (in 2013) respectively. The 2019 edition of the marathon was a \"Run for Clean and Safe Drinking Water\". Over the years, many prominent personalities have endorsed the event, including the illustrious Milkha Singh, Shimit Amin, and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. Their support has been integral in drawing large crowds to the event.
