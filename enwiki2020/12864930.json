Additionally, the office interacts with national organizations representing U.S. governors of other states such as the National Governors Association and the Southern Governors' Association. PRFAA also coordinates the lobbying efforts of the Puerto Rico executive branch in Washington, DC, and assists other Puerto Rican agencies and municipalities in grant-seeking efforts. The agency is also supposed to support the work of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico but the relationship tends to be tumultuous when the governor and the resident commissioner come from different political parties. PRFAA's headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., at 1100 17th Street NW, while its Regional Office is located at 6925 Lake Ellenor Drive, Orlando, FL 32809. ==Directors== ==References== Category:Secretariat of Governance of Puerto Rico Category:Organizations based in Washington, D.C.
