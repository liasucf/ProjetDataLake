It also was published as a poem in Smith's 1972 book kodak under the title \"Radando Beach\". The lyrics relate the suicide by drowning of a young woman following an argument with the song's narrator. It frequently has been interpreted as a lesbian-themed song; Smith appeared to encourage this interpretation in her live performances, often introducing the song with \"Redondo Beach is a beach where women love other women\".Allmusic.com review of Redondo Beach She later said that she wrote the lyrics in 1971 following a fight with her sister Linda; the latter had disappeared for the day, causing Patti to worry that she had come to harm.
