    "text": "\"Jedna si jedina\" () was the national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1998.The One and Unique ==History== The music was taken from the old Bosnian folk song \"S one strane Plive\" (\"On the far bank of the Pliva river\" or \"On the other side of the Pliva river\"), which was reportedly inspired by the Turkish song \"Sivastopol Mar\u015f\u0131\". The lyrics were written by Bosnian singer Dino Merlin; that version is featured on his 1993 album, Moja Bogda Sna. It was adopted in November 1992, several months after independence in March 1992. Serbs and Croats hated it, and thus a new composition, the \"National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina\", was approved and adopted by the United Nations as the country's national anthem in 1999. \"Jedna si jedina\" is still considered to be the de facto national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina by many Bosniaks; many Bosniaks still sing this song because they believe that it should be the national anthem of the state as the current state anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have any official lyrics. ==Lyrics== On most occasions, only the first verse followed by the chorus were performed. {|style=\"text- align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\" |- |colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"|First version |- !Bosnian !English |- |colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#003C9F\"|First verse |- |Zemljo tisu\u0107ljetna, na vjernost ti se kunem.
