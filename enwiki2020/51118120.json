He suffered incarceration several times during the pre-independence period, including a term in the Cellular Jail. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1977, for his contributions to society. == Biography == Prithvi Singh Azad was born on 15 September 1892 at Lalru, a small town in Mohali district of the North Indian state of Punjab. He was a Rajput but he did a lot of work for the upliftment of Dalits. He was attracted to the nationalist movement while he was still in his teens and was reported to have been influenced by the arrest of Lokmanya Tilak and Khudi Ram Bose by the British government in 1907\u201308. He visited the US in 1912 and it was during this time he met Lala Har Dayal, one of the founders of later-day Ghadar Party, a militant organization formed by Indians in North America for the liberation of India. He also assisted in the establishment of Hindustan Ghadar, the mouthpiece of the party. Returning to India along with around 150 freedom fighters, he was captured by the British on 7 December 1914, tried, sentenced for 10 years' imprisonment and spent time in various jails, including Calcutta, Madras and the Cellular Jail. After the initial futile attempt, he escaped by jumping out of a running train while he was being transferred from one jail to another. Later, he became an associate of Chandra Shekhar Azad and reportedly received a Mauser pistol from him. It was reported that Azad was with Chandra Shekhar Azad just before the British forces surrounded him at Alfred Park on 27 February 1931, but the latter asked Prithvi Singh to escape while deciding to continue his battle with the forces; alternatively another contention was that the two Azads met at Alfred Park a few days before the death of Chandra Shekhar. the plaque at Pruthvisinh Azad's bust at Bhavnagar It was Chandra Shekhar who advised Azad to visit Russia for further training; it was reported that the idea to send Azad to Russia in fact came from Bhagat Singh, another martyred revolutionary and Chandra Sekhar was conveying Bhagat Singh's request. He visited Russia to spend a few months there and his experiences in Russia were later published as a book, Lenin ke Desham Me, which was subsequently translated into English by Vijay Chauhan under the title, Prithvi Singh Azad In Lenin's land. On his return to India, he met several mainstream freedom fighters, including Mohandas Gandhi and joined the nationalist movement led by Gandhi. Between 1933 and the Indian independence in 1947, he was arrested several times which included the Lahore Conspiracy Case in which he was sentenced to death; the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment in the Cellular Jail. After the Indian independence, he successfully contested the elections to the first Constituent Assembly of India from Punjab and was its member since the assembly met for the first time at Constitution Club Hall, New Delhi on 9 December 1946. After the Indian independence, he was selected as the Minister for Labor and Local Self-government, the only harijan member of the ministry, when Bhim Sen Sachar took over as the second Chief Minister of Punjab in 1949. The Government of India honored him with the civilian honor of Padma Bhushan in 1977. Azad died on 5 March 1989, at the age of 96. The story of his life has been documented in two autobiographies; Kranti Path ka Pathik (A Traveler in the Revolutionary Path), was published in 1990 by Haryana Sahitya Akademi while Baba Prithvi Singh Azad, the Legendary Crusader was published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan three years earlier in 1987. A set of documents related his life has been preserved in Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi as Baba Prithvi Singh Azad Papers. A local Hospital in Lalru, his native place, is being considered for renaming as Baba Prithvi Singh Azad Memorial Hospital. His daughter, Pragya Kumar, is a medical doctor and the chief medical officer at Panjab University, Chandigarh. == See also == * Bhim Sen Sachar * Chandra Shekhar Azad * Constituent Assembly of India * Ghadar Party * Hindustan Ghadar * Ghadar Mutiny * Lala Har Dayal * Lahore Conspiracy Case trial == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * Excerpt from the book, A Revolutionary History of Interwar India. * Category:1892 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Members of the Constituent Assembly of India Category:Indian independence activists from Punjab (British India) Category:Revolutionary movement for Indian independence Category:State cabinet ministers of Punjab, India Category:Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in public affairs ",
