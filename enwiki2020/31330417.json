(former names OKD, OKK, a.s. and Ostravsko-karvinsk\u00e9 koksovny, akciov\u00e1 spole\u010dnost) is the largest producer of foundry coke in Europe. The Company operates one plant in the City of Ostrava - called 'Svoboda' facility. == History == The production of coke in the Ostrava area dates back to the 1840s. In 1843 a coking plant named \"Jan\" (later renamed \"President Bene\u0161\" and then \"Czechoslovak Army\" was founded. It was later to become a part of OKK. In 1952 the company OKK was founded and all operating coking plants were merged under one head office, having previously existed as separate state enterprises, except for the metallurgical coking plants (in the Ostrava quarter V\u00edtkovice, in the cities of T\u0159inec and Kladno, and the coking plant Nov\u00e1 Hu\u0165 [New Smelting Works] founded in the same year). OKK included the coking plants in Ostrava: Svoboda, Jan \u0160verma, Karolina, Trojice, Czechoslovak army, and Lazy. In 1994 the joint- stock company OKD, OKK was established on 1 January 1994 by the allocation of OKD, a. s. assets. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of OKD, a. s. The annual turnover of the company was around CZK 5.5 billion. The new enterprise was created by merging two mining coking plants located within the city of Ostrava and one more plant located in the Karvin\u00e1 region. In 2008 after property changes the New World Resources Plc Company (\"NWR\") became a new owner of the OKD, OKK, a.s. NWR was also the owner of the OKD, a.s., a hard coal mining company. Currently (2011) the OKK Koksovny, a.s. operates only one coking plant called 'Svoboda' facility. == Company products == The main business of OKK Koksovny, a. s. is the production of coke.
