    "text": "The Mary Jane Girls were an American R&B;, soul and funk group that gained popularity in the 1980s. They were prot\u00e9g\u00e9es of singer Rick James. They are known for their songs \"In My House\", \"All Night Long\", \"Candy Man\", and their cover version of \"Walk Like a Man\". Joanne \"Jojo\" McDuffie was the lead singer, the others filling out the group's style and appearance. On the studio recordings, McDuffie was backed by session vocalists rather than the other Mary Jane Girls. The Mary Jane Girls released two albums in the 1980s and recorded a third which was shelved for decades but finally released in 2014 as part of a larger retrospective of Rick James' work. They were inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2019. ==Career== Rick James was frequently backed in his studio recordings by vocalists Joanne \"Jojo\" McDuffie and the sisters Maxine and Julia Waters. For live performances starting in 1979, James was backed by McDuffie along with Cheryl Bailey (who used the stage name Cheri Wells), Candice \"Candi\" Ghant and Kimberly \"Maxi\" Wuletich. Casually amongst the musicians, McDuffie, Wells, Ghant and Wuletich used the moniker Mary Jane Girls, a subgroup of James' backing band, the Stone City Band. The girls learned choreographed dance routines and they practiced under a vocal coach. In 1983, James proposed to Motown that McDuffie be offered a solo career but miscommunication caused the label to sign an all-female group, which he determined would be the Mary Jane Girls.Blakcitrus (November 4, 2012). \"The Mary Jane Girls-Boys\". Kickmag.net. James filled the positions behind McDuffie with Wells, Ghant and Wuletich. He also wrote all the original songs and produced all the recordings. The Waters sisters and McDuffie sang all the parts on the first Mary Jane Girls album: Mary Jane Girls (1983). The album yielded their first R&B; hits: \"Candy Man\", \"All Night Long\" (which was later included in the soundtrack of the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), and \"Boys\". In live performances, the Mary Jane Girls were backed by the Stone City Band. The male band members also sang the background vocals to support McDuffie as lead vocalist. Cheri Wells left the group before the next album project was recorded. She was replaced by Yvette \"Corvette\" Marine.Tommyj (February 21, 2014). \"Flashback Fridays with Rick James\".

RetroUniverse. The group released their second album Only Four You in 1985. McDuffie was featured on most of the songs, and the Waters sisters were hired to provide background vocals, since the other members were vocally limited. The lead single \"In My House\" became the group's biggest hit, reaching number 3 on the R&B; chart and then crossing over to the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it reached number 7 and spent 12 weeks in the Top 40. It also charted on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, peaking at number 1 for two weeks in April 1985. \"Wild and Crazy Love\" was the second single from this album and it also fared well on the R&B; (number 10) and dance charts (number 3). It barely missed the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 42. The last single, \"Break It Up\", only reached number 79 on the R&B; chart and did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100, but it did hit #39 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. A third album was recorded by the group, the project called Conversation, but it was shelved for decades, finally released in 2014 as part of a larger retrospective of James' work.Rick James' Catalog Re-Released in Digital Form on July 8, to Coincide with New Autobiography, 'Glow'.

This single charted at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. Another single, \"Shadow Lover\", was also released in 1986, and the Mary Jane Girls appeared on Soul Train to lip-sync to it, but the single was not promoted by the label. Ghant obtained other work in 1986 when James and Motown were in dispute, since the Mary Jane Girls had no label support. The Mary Jane Girls officially disbanded in 1987.Kyleigh (December 24, 2009).

They continued performing occasionally for a year or two. McDuffie recorded with James on his 1997 Urban Rhapsody album, on the torch song \"Never Say You Love Me\". In 2001, Mary J. Blige reported that she had purchased the rights to the name \"Mary Jane Girls\" for the purpose of putting together a girl group composed of one Asian American, one African American, one Latina, and one white singer. Blige said she wanted the name because her own name was Mary Jane Blige. Blige did not pursue the project. In 2003, the Mary Jane Girls were featured on VH1 in a \"Where Are They Now?\" episode. Ghant, Wells, Wuletich and Marine were interviewed together. McDuffie, coming off of a concert tour backing Barry White in Europe, appeared in a separate interview. In 2009, McDuffie's husband Robert Funderburg applied for control of the trademark \"Mary Jane Girls\", but the application was abandoned in 2010. Later in 2010, Kimberly \"Maxi\" Wuletich applied for the trademark \"MJB Starring Maxi and Cheri of the Original Mary Jane Girls\", which she uses for performing with Cheri Wells.
