    "text": "Sergio Garc\u00eda de la Fuente (; born 9 June 1983) is a Spanish professional footballer. Mainly a forward, he can also appear as a winger, preferably on the right. After starting out at Barcelona, he went on to represent mainly Zaragoza and Espanyol, serving as captain of the latter. Over 14 seasons, he amassed La Liga totals of 360 matches and 75 goals. Garc\u00eda appeared for Spain at Euro 2008, winning the tournament. ==Club career== ===Barcelona=== Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Garc\u00eda rose through the ranks of FC Barcelona, finding however opportunities almost non-existent in the senior squad. A frequent goalscorer for the reserves in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, he made his first-team debut on 29 October 2002, coming on as a substitute for Geovanni for the final 28 minutes of a 2\u20130 away win against Club Brugge KV in the season's UEFA Champions League; he made another cameo in that competition the following 19 March, in a 2\u20130 victory at Newcastle United for the second group phase. On 3 September 2003, Garc\u00eda started in his La Liga debut in his first match at the Camp Nou, a 1\u20131 draw against Sevilla FC. On 1 March of the following year, he signed a three-year contract extension. Garc\u00eda was loaned to Levante UD on 21 July 2004, ahead of the upcoming top flight campaign. He scored his first goal in the competition on 3 October to complete a 2\u20130 win over RCD Mallorca at the Estadi Ciutat de Val\u00e8ncia, ranking team top scorer as the Valencians were relegated; his last goal came on 5 May 2004 in a 1\u20133 away loss to Albacete Balompi\u00e9, where he was sent off moments later for fighting with Santi. ===Zaragoza=== Garcia played all 38 matches for Real Zaragoza in 2007\u201308, as they were eventually relegated from the top level. At the beginning of the following season, he was linked with a number of Premier League clubs including Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Stoke City, along with teammate Diego Milito. Rumours that he would leave Zaragoza had been further fuelled after the club's relegation, as he was thrown out of a side pre-season training session by manager Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral and was then left out of their opening day defeat against Levante. ===Betis=== On 1 September 2008, in the dying seconds of the transfer window, after continuous rumours, Garc\u00eda signed for Real Betis, for a fee close to \u20ac10 million. He scored his first goal for his new club on 27 September in the team's home game against Real Madrid (1\u20132 loss), following up on his own saved penalty. On 16 November he netted a brace in at 3\u20131 home win over Racing de Santander and, on 18 January of the following year, added another in the 3\u20131 success at Real Valladolid in which he also assisted the other goal. Garc\u00eda was sent off three times in the first half of the season. On 7 February 2009, he helped Betis achieve a landmark victory at neighbouring Sevilla, scoring in a 2\u20131 win. In form, he was struck with a knee injury after celebrating his goal against CD Numancia, a 3\u20133 home draw on 4 April, eventually missing a month of competition \u2013 with the team struggling during this time \u2013 and eventually dropping down a level at the end. Garc\u00eda scored 12 goals in the 2009\u201310 campaign, but the Andalusians failed to win promotion. ===Espanyol=== In August 2010, Garc\u00eda signed a five-year contract with RCD Espanyol, moving to the club as a replacement to veteran Ra\u00fal Tamudo who left after nearly 20 years of service. He did not score in his first 15 games for Mauricio Pochettino's team, ending the drought on 9 January 2011 when as a substitute he concluded a 4\u20130 home win over former team Zaragoza, assisted by his namesake Luis. On 24 November 2013, Garc\u00eda scored his first hat-trick for the Pericos in a 4\u20131 win at Rayo Vallecano \u2013 two of his three goals came from the penalty spot. The following season, he netted a career-best (in Spain) 14 league goals. ===Al-Rayyan=== Garc\u00eda turned down an offer to join Qatar's Al Sadd SC, who had recently signed Barcelona's Xavi. On 29 June, however, he joined Al-Rayyan SC in the same country. He made his debut on 11 September, starting in a 4\u20130 Stars League home win against Al-Sailiya SC, and scored his first goal on 2 October when he confirmed a 2\u20130 victory over Al-Mesaimeer Sports Club at the Thani bin Jassim Stadium; on 22 November, he scored twice and assisted one of Rodrigo Tabata's four goals in a league record 9\u20130 rout at Qatar SC. On 5 March 2016, Garc\u00eda netted once in a 5\u20130 win at Al-Wakrah Sport Club that handed his team their first league title in 21 years, and with five games to spare. ===Espanyol return=== On 16 June 2017, aged 34, Garc\u00eda returned to Espanyol after agreeing to a one-year contract. Exactly two years later, he left. ==International career== Catalonia, 2013 Garc\u00eda was part of the Spain under-19 team that won the 2002 UEFA European Championship in Norway, equalising in the 3\u20131 win over Slovakia in their final group game in Drammen. On 22 October 2003, against the same country but at under-20 level, he netted a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win in preparation for the FIFA World Youth Championship. During the tournament in the United Arab Emirates, he scored against Mali in the group and netted the only goal against Paraguay in the last 16, as the nation finished as runners-up. Without having been previously capped, Garc\u00eda made the Spanish final squad-of-23 for UEFA Euro 2008 (which Spain went on to win) as a replacement for Barcelona's Bojan Krki\u0107. He made his debut for the national side on 31 May 2008, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for David Silva in a 2\u20131 friendly win against Peru in Huelva. On 18 June, Garc\u00eda earned his first competitive cap, playing for the full 90 minutes against Greece in Spain's third and final group D game in Euro 2008: in the 88th minute, he delivered a pinpoint left-footed cross for Dani G\u00fciza to head home the 2\u20131 winner. Garc\u00eda also represented Spain at all youth levels, as well as appearing frequently for the unofficial Catalan national team. On 22 December 2009, he scored the side's first goal in a 4\u20132 defeat of Argentina and, on 30 December 2013, he netted twice in a 4\u20131 victory over Cape Verde. In March 2019, he played his 16th game against Venezuela in Girona, and surpassed Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez as the most capped player in its history. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=3|Barcelona |2002\u201303 |rowspan=2|La Liga |0||0||0||0||2||0||2||0 |- |2003\u201304 |4||0||2||0||1||0||7||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !4||0||2||0||3||0||9||0 |- |Levante (loan) |2004\u201305 |La Liga |31||7||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||32||7 |- |rowspan=4|Zaragoza |2005\u201306 |rowspan=3|La Liga |19||4||6||0||colspan=2|\u2014||25||4 |- |2006\u201307 |33||6||6||2||colspan=2|\u2014||39||8 |- |2007\u201308 |38||4||4||1||2||0||44||5 |- !colspan=2|Total !90||14||16||3||2||0||108||17 |- |rowspan=3|Betis |2008\u201309 |La Liga |28||9||4||1||colspan=2|\u2014||32||10 |- |2009\u201310 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |34||12||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||35||12 |- !colspan=2|Total !62||21||5||1||colspan=2|\u2014||67||22 |- |rowspan=6|Espanyol |2010\u201311 |rowspan=5|La Liga |21||3||4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||25||3 |- |2011\u201312 |24||5||3||2||colspan=2|\u2014||27||7 |- |2012\u201313 |28||7||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||28||7 |- |2013\u201314 |37||12||4||1||colspan=2|\u2014||41||13 |- |2014\u201315 |35||14||6||1||colspan=2|\u2014||41||15 |- !colspan=2|Total !145||41||17||4||colspan=2|\u2014||162||45 |- |rowspan=3|Al-Rayyan |2015\u201316 |rowspan=2|Qatar Stars League |24||16||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||24||16 |- |2016\u201317 |25||11||0||0||6||3||31||14 |- !colspan=2|Total !49||27||0||0||6||3||55||30 |- |rowspan=2|Espanyol |2017\u201318 |rowspan=2|La Liga |33||2||5||1||colspan=2|\u2014||38||3 |- |2018\u201319 |29||2||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||31||2 |- !colspan=3|Career total !443||114||48||9||11||3||500||126 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Al-Rayan *Qatar Stars League: 2015\u201316 ===International=== Spain *UEFA European Championship: 2008 Spain U19 *UEFA European Under-19 Championship: 2002 Spain U20 *FIFA U-20 World Cup runner-up: 2003 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Barcelona Category:Spanish footballers Category:Catalan footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:CF Damm players Category:FC Barcelona C players Category:FC Barcelona B players Category:FC Barcelona players Category:Levante UD footballers Category:Real Zaragoza players Category:Real Betis players Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:Qatar Stars League players Category:Al-Rayyan SC players Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spain under-21 international footballers Category:Spain international footballers Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:UEFA European Championship-winning players Category:Catalonia international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Qatar Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Qatar ",
