    "text": "Shanhui Fan (; born 1972) is a Chinese-born American electrical engineer and physicist, with a focus on theoretical, computational and numerical aspects of photonics and electromagnetism. He is a professor of electrical engineering, and a professor of applied physics (by courtesy) at Stanford University. He is the director of the Edward L. Ginzton Lab and Senior Fellow at the Precourt Institute for Energy. ==Education== Fan did his undergraduate study in physics from the University of Science and Technology of China from 1988 to 1992. He completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1997, after which he continued as a postdoctoral researcher in the same group at MIT. His advisor was John D. Joannopoulos. ==Career== Fan joined Stanford's faculty of electrical engineering in April, 2001. In 2012, he was a Visiting professor of Physics at University of Sydney. Since 2014, Fan has been the Director of the Edward L. Ginzton Lab. He was appointed Senior Fellow at the Precourt Institute for Energy and courtesy professor of Applied Physics through January 31, 2021. Fan's research areas include nanophotonics, photonic crystals, metamaterials, topological photonics, plasmonics, solar cells. , Fan has been granted approximately 57 patents. ==Selected works== *Coupled Mode Theory For Optical Resonances: ** ** *Modulation Induced Non-Reciprocity: ** ** *Daytime Radiative Cooling: ** ==Awards and Honors== * Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship (2017) * Thomson Reuters Highly Cited Researcher in Physics (2015-) * Fellow, IEEE (2010), for \u201ccontributions to nanophotonics\u201d. * Fellow, SPIE (2010) * Fellow, the American Physical Society (2008), for \u201ccontributions to the theory and applications of nanophotonic structures and devices, including photonic crystals, plasmonics and meta-materials. * Fellow, the Optical Society of America (2008), \u201cFor many deep and creative contributions to physics, analysis, and novel devices in semiconductor, dielectric and metallic optical nanostructures\u201d. * The Adolph Lomb Medal from the Optical Society of America (2007), \u201cFor fundamental work in nano-photonic structures\u201d. * The William O.
