    "text": "Hungarian-Vietnamese relations are the diplomatic relations between Hungary and Vietnam. Hungary has an embassy in Hanoi. Vietnam has an embassy in Budapest. ==History== Hungary and Vietnam established an official relationship in the 1950s, when the two countries were both in the Eastern Bloc. Since then, Hungary and Vietnam have developed further relations, with Vietnamese students and workers often going to Hungary to pursue higher education. During the 1980s, at the height of Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War, Hungary adopted a neutral policy and remained distanced from the conflict. After the Cold War and collapse of Soviet Union, both Hungary and Vietnam effectively gave up practicing communist ideology in favor of market capitalism, although Vietnam remains under the control of the Communist Party, while Hungary has transitioned back to capitalism. ===21st Century=== Relations between Hungary and Vietnam are described as excellent. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n visited Vietnam in 2017. Vietnam considers Hungary an important economic and key partner in Central Europe, due to its diverse ties and rich history. The two countries developed a strategic partnership in 2018, with the Hungarian Prime Minister referring to Vietnam as a success in the Far East. ==Vietnamese people in Hungary== The Vietnamese community in Hungary is small and, despite historic immigration, Vietnamese tend to be less active and well-integrated into Hungarian society. In 2018, the Hungarian government officially recognized a pagoda that had recently been built by the Vietnamese community. However, illegal immigration remains a concern. In 2010, Hungary and the European Union (of which Hungary is a member) launched a crackdown on a Vietnamese illegal immigration network. ==References== ==External links== *Embassy of Hungary, Hanoi *Embassy of Vietnam in Hungary Category:Bilateral relations of Hungary Category:Bilateral relations of Vietnam ",
