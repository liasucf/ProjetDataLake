    "text": "In axiomatic set theory, Shelah cardinals are a kind of large cardinals. A cardinal \\kappa is called Shelah iff for every f:\\kappa\\rightarrow\\kappa, there exists a transitive class N and an elementary embedding j:V\\rightarrow N with critical point \\kappa; and V_{j(f)(\\kappa )}\\subset N. A Shelah cardinal has a normal ultrafilter containing the set of weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals below it. == References == * Ernest Schimmerling, Woodin cardinals, Shelah cardinals and the Mitchell-Steel core model, Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 130/11, pp. 3385-3391, 2002, online Category:Large cardinals ",
