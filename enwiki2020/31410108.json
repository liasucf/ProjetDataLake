    "text": "The Mississippi Fire Dogs were a professional indoor American football team based in Biloxi, Mississippi. They played their home games at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. They were a charter member of the Indoor Professional Football League. They played from in the 1999-2000 IPFL seasons before joining the National Indoor Football League in 2001. Their final season was in 2002. ==History== During their first two years, the Fire Dogs went 9-7 and third in the league, yet it was their second season that proved to be a glorious year by winning the IPFL championship title. When the IPFL folded, the Fire Dogs joined the new National Indoor Football League as a charter member and won the inaugural Indoor Bowl against the Wyoming Cavalry. However, they couldn't repeat the same success in 2002. Afterwards, the franchise folded. During the 1999 & 2000 IPFL seasons, the most notable member for the Fire Dogs was head coach/general manager/player(QB) John Fourcade, formerly of the National Football League's New Orleans Saints. Fourcade was followed as head coach in 2001 & 2002 by Irvin Favre, the late father of legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre. Irvin Favre was also a minority owner for the Fire Dogs. ==2000 IPFL Season== Week 1 - Mobile Seagulls 33, at Mississippi Fire Dogs 57 Week 2 \u2013 Portland Prowlers 42, Mississippi Fire Dogs 41 Week 3 - Idaho Stallions 35, at Mississippi Fire Dogs 22 Week 4 - Mississippi Fire Dogs 23, at Mobile Seagulls 30 Week 5 - Mississippi Fire Dogs 37, at Louisiana Rangers 50 Week 6 - bye Week 7 - Shreveport-Bossier 17 at Mississippi Fire Dogs 57 Week 8 - bye Week 9 - Mississippi Fire Dogs 51, at Idaho Stallions 28 Week 10 - Mississippi Fire Dogs 56, at Louisiana Rangers 44 Week 11 - Mobile Seagulls 40, at Mississippi Fire Dogs 30 Week 12 - Mississippi Fire Dogs 30, at Mobile Seagulls 16 Week 13 - Mississippi Fire Dogs 49, Omaha Beef 46 Week 14 - Louisiana Rangers 34, at Mississippi Fire Dogs 53 Week 15 \u2013 Mississippi Fire Dogs 39, Portland Prowlers 36 Week 16 - bye Week 17 - Shreveport-Bossier 34 at Mississippi Fire Dogs 49 Week 18- Mississippi Fire Dogs 37 at Shreveport- Bossier 41 Week 19 - Omaha Beef 44, Mississippi Fire Dogs 38 Semifinals - Mississippi Fire Dogs 43, Omaha Beef 40 IPFL Championship \u2013 Mississippi Fire Dogs 53, Portland Prowlers 48 ==Season-By-Season== |- | colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | Mississippi Fire Dogs (IPFL) |- |1999 || 9 || 7 || 0 || 3rd League || -- |- |2000 || 11 || 5 || 0 || 2nd League || Won Semifinals (Omaha) Won IPFL Championship (Portland) |- | colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | Mississippi Fire Dogs (NIFL) |- |2001 || 13 || 1 || 0 || 1st Southern Division || Won Round 1 (Johnstown) Won Semifinals (Ohio Valley) Won Indoor Bowl I (Wyoming) |- |2002 || 3 || 9 || 0 || 2nd Eastern Division || -- |- !Totals || 36 || 22 || 0 |colspan=\"2\"| ==References== ==External links== * 2001 NIFL Season Stats Category:National Indoor Football League seasons Category:Indoor Professional Football League teams Category:Sports in Biloxi, Mississippi Category:American football teams in Mississippi Category:American football teams established in 1999 Category:American football teams disestablished in 2002 Category:1999 establishments in Mississippi Category:2002 disestablishments in Mississippi ",
