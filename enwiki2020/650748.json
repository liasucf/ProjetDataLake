    "text": "Cindy Cashdollar is an American musician specializing in steel guitar and Dobro. She grew up in Woodstock, New York, where she perfected her skills by playing with bluegrass musician John Herald, blues musician Paul Butterfield, and Levon Helm and Rick Danko of The Band. After residing in Austin, Texas, for 23 years, she has now returned to her native Woodstock, New York. Cashdollar received five Grammy awards while playing for eight years with Asleep at the Wheel, and has also backed such noted performers as Bob Dylan, Leon Redbone, Redd Volkaert, Carla Olson and Ryan Adams as a member of his band The Cardinals. In 2003, the Academy of Western Artists recognized Cashdollar as Instrumentalist of the Year Award in the Western Swing Music genre. She was inducted into The Austin Chronicle Hall of Fame in 2011\u201312. She authored a series of instructional videos on her instruments and released her first solo album, Slide Show, in 2004. During the fall of 2004 she was a member of Ryan Adams's band The Cardinals playing the steel guitar live on stage. She also went into the studio with this band and played on the album Cold Roses, although she did not tour the album with Adams & The Cardinals and was replaced in 2005 by Jon Graboff. From 2005 to 2008, Cashdollar played with Elana James, Redd Volkaert (and, sometimes, Nate Rowe), as The High Flyers, appearing on A Prairie Home Companion twice, as well as playing Austin area venues. In 2006, she toured with Van Morrison promoting his country and western album, Pay the Devil. She appeared with him at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, on September 15, 2006 (subsequently released on Val Morrison's Live at Austin City Limits Festival limited edition recording), and on the television show Austin City Limits featuring Van Morrison, broadcast in November 2006. Cashdollar plays steel guitar on two of the tracks on Morrison's March 2008 studio album, Keep It Simple. She is an eponymous member of Dave Alvin's 2009 project, Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women. ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Disc Title ! scope=\"col\" | Artist ! scope=\"col\" | Label |- |2020 |Waltz For Abilene |Cindy Cashdollar |Silver Shot Records |- |2003 |Slide Show |Cindy Cashdollar |Silver Shot Records |- |2009 |Bootleg Series 8 |Bob Dylan |Sony BMG |- |1997 |Time Out of Mind |Bob Dylan |Columbia |- |2008 |Miss Understood |Carolyn Wonderland |Bismeaux Productions |- |2009 |Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women |Dave Alvin and the Guilty Women |Yep Roc Records |- |2008 |Peace, Love & BBQ |Marcia Ball |Alligator Records |- |2008 |Loaded |The Waybacks |Compass Records |- |2008 |Keep It Simple |Van Morrisson |Lost Highway |- |2008 |Dulcinea |Tremoloco |Casa Julia Records |- |2009 |That Old Mercer Magic |JaLaLa |Dare Records |- |2005 |Cold Roses |Ryan Adams and The Cardinals |Lost Highway |- |2001 |The Very Best of Asleep at the Wheel |Asleep at the Wheel |Relentless / Nashville |- |1999 |Ride with Bob |Asleep at the Wheel |Dreamworks |- |1997 |Back to the Future Now (Live) |Asleep at the Wheel |Lucky Dog |- |1997 |Merry Texas Christmas Ya'll |Asleep at the Wheel |High Street Records |- |1995 |The Wheel Keeps on Rollin' |Asleep at the Wheel |Capitol |- |1994 |Still Swingin' |Asleep at the Wheel |Liberty |- |1993 |Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys |Asleep at the Wheel |Liberty |- |2009 |Shadow on the Ground |James Hand |Rounder Records |- |2009 |Texas Sheiks |Geoff Muldaur And The Texas Sheiks |Tradition & Moderne |- |2004 |Gitane Cajun |BeauSoleil |Vanguard |- |2006 |Hammer Of The Honky-Tonk Gods |Bill Kirchen |Proper |- |2006 |Disciples of the Truth |Burrito Deluxe |Luna Chica Records |- |1998 |Down at the Sky-Vue Drive In |Don Walser |Watermelon Records |- |1996 |Texas Tophand |Don Walser |Watermelon Records |- |1994 |Rolling Stone from Texas |Don Walser |Watermelon Records |- |2000 |Fast Texas |Steve James |Burnside |- |2000 |Boom Chang |Steve James |Burnside |- |1996 |Art and Grit |Steve James |Burnside |- |2011 |Future Blues |Johnny Nicholas |Bona Dea Music / The People's Label |- |2005 |Livin' With the Blues |Johnny Nicholas |Topcat Records |- |2009 |Western Bling |Stephanie Davis |Recluse Records |- |1998 |Pearls in the Snow: A Tribute to the Songs of Kinky Friedman |Kinky Friedman Tribute Artists |Kinkajou |- |1999 |Swingland |Omar & the Howlers |Black Top Records |- |1999 |Dance Hall Dreams |Rosie Flores |Rounder Records |- |2011 |The Bordertown Bootleggers |The Bordertown Bootleggers |Tonepoet |- |2002 |South of Lafayette |Artie Traum |Roaring Stream Records |- |1993 |Letters from Joubee |Artie Traum |Narada |- |1986 |Cayenne |Artie Traum |Rounder Records |- |1999 |The Cajun Allstars |Chez Les Cajuns |Narada |- |2008 |Beautiful World |Eliza Gilkyson |Red House |- |1991 |Struck by Lightning |Graham Parker |RCA Records |- |1997 |Crazy Moon |Hans Theessink |Blue Groove |- |1994 |Whistling in the Wind |Leon Redbone |Private Music |- |1992 |Up a Lazy River |Leon Redbone |Private Music |- |1991 |Sugar |Leon Redbone |Private Music |- |1988 |No Regrets |Leon Redbone |Private Music |- |1987 |Christmas Island |Leon Redbone |Private Music |- |1996 |Bicycle |Livingston Taylor |Pony Canyon |- |1991 |Our Turn to Dance |Livingston Taylor |Pony Canyon |- |1997 |Swing |The Manhattan Transfer |Atlantic Records |- |2012 |Oliver Rajamani |Oliver Rajamani |Rajamani Productions |- |1994 |Tree on a Hill |Peter Rowan and the Rowan Brothers |Sugar Hill |- |1996 |Buffalo Zen |Rex Foster |Agarita |- |2013 |Old-Fashioned Gal |The Carper Family |Trade Root Music |- |2005 |A Heart Wide Open |Tish Hinojosa |Valley Entertainment |- |2010 |Southern Filibuster: a Tribute to Tut Taylor |Various Dobro players |E1 Entertainment |- |2003 |Elf Original Soundtrack |Elf (film) Soundtrack |New Line Records |- |1998 |Horse Whisperer Original Soundtrack |The Horse Whisperer (film) Soundtrack |MCA |- |2012 |This is 40 Original Soundtrack |This Is 40 (film) Soundtrack |Capitol |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
