    "text": "Alices Yannel Correa Santa Cruz (born 10 September 1996) is a Spanish-born Uruguayan footballer who plays as a defender for Spanish Primera Nacional club CF Joventut Almassora and the Uruguay women's national team. ==Early life== Correa was born to Uruguayan parents in Badajoz, Spain in 1996. At that time, her father, former Uruguay international footballer Gabriel Correa, was playing for AD M\u00e9rida. After her father finished his career, her family (which includes an older brother) settled in Murcia, the first Spanish city where her father had played and where her brother was born. ==Club career== Nicknamed La Negra (The Black), Correa made her debut for Murcia F\u00e9minas in 2010, at age 13 or 14. The team promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in 2011 and was Group 7 runner-up in the 2012\u201313 season. On 26 June 2013, she was signed by fellow Segunda Divisi\u00f3n team Sporting Plaza de Argel, where she would spend the next three seasons. In July 2016, she returned to Murcia F\u00e9minas. On 10 February 2017, she was signed by Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Fundaci\u00f3n Albacete. She made her debut for them on 18 February 2017 in an away lost against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. She broke the meniscus and the cruciate ligament in early October 2017, after being an unused substitute in the first two league matches of the 2017-2018 season. ==International career== Due to her birthplace and her background, Correa is eligible to play for Spain or Uruguay. She chose the latter. In February 2018, she was one of the six Uruguayan players abroad who were reserved to play for the country at the 2018 Copa Am\u00e9rica Femenina. ==References== ==External links== *Yannel Correa at LaLiga.es (in Spanish) *Yannel Correa at Txapeldunak.com (in Spanish) Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football central defenders Category:Uruguayan women's footballers Category:Uruguay women's international footballers Category:Spanish women's footballers Category:Extremaduran footballers Category:People from Badajoz Category:Spanish people of Uruguayan descent Category:Primera Divisi\u00f3n (women) players ",
