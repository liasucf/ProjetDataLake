Geography The village sits on sandstone, the Bridport Sand Formation, a sedimentary bedrock formed approximately 174 to 183 million years ago in the Jurassic Period.http://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritain/home.html In parts of the village the bedrock is overlain by clay deposits. Many of the older buildings were built using Hamstone from nearby Ham Hill quarries. It is a honey- coloured Jurassic limestone. The principal street runs north-south through the village and is un-named although some local government organizations refer to it as \"Over Stratton Road, South Petherton\", for example, when publishing temporary road closure orders. . The route of Roman road, the Fosse Way, crosses this street in a northeast southwest direction. The route of the Fosse Way is joined by the A303 2 km northeast of the village, close to Petherton Bridge over the River Parrett. Some of the minor streets joining the principal streets are named but none of the streets other than Church Path and Gorefield have a numbering system for the properties. On the village noticeboard there is an outline map that includes an indexed list of 143 properties and their corresponding locations on the map. There are 10 post codes https://m.royalmail.com/mt/www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode covering the village and the immediate vicinity: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\" |- !

On the former route of the old A303 on Harp Road, there is a fuel station by which there are bus stops for local services to South Petherton and Yeovil, and express services to Taunton and Hammersmith, London. The nearest railway station is at Crewkerne, five miles to the south of the village.
