    "text": "Jay Elliot Henderson (born September 17, 1978) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey winger. He is currently an assistant coach with the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League. Henderson was the final player drafted in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, picked in the ninth round, 246th overall, by the Boston Bruins. ==Playing career== After playing four seasons in the Western Hockey League, with the Red Deer Rebels and Edmonton Ice, Henderson made his professional debut with the Bruins' American Hockey League affiliate, the Providence Bruins, in the 1997\u201398 season. He made his NHL debut with the Bruins during the 1998\u201399 season, appearing in four games. He appeared in 29 more games with the Bruins over the next two seasons. To date, he has no further NHL experience. In 33 career NHL games, Henderson recorded one goal and three assists. Henderson played for Augsburger Panther and Frankfurt Lions of Germany's DEL during the 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307 seasons. In 2008\u201309 season, Henderson swapped Germany for Austria where he played for HC TWK Innsbruck After playing in Europe for the previous few years, Henderson started the 2009\u201310 season at ECHL team Victoria Salmon Kings where he played only 2 games before moving to the Central Hockey League's Wichita Thunder. Henderson did not settle in Wichita and soon decided to accept a contract with British Elite Ice Hockey League's Nottingham Panthers in January 2010, where he settled into life as a Panther in time for the play offs. On May 15, 2010, Henderson signed a deal to return to play for the British Elite Ice Hockey League's Nottingham Panthers; this was short lived as he was sent home to recover from a back-neck injury. ==Coaching career== On June 27, 2013, Henderson was hired as an assistant coach for the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text- align:center; width:75%\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
