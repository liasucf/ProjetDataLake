    "text": "The Victor Recording Orchestra was a jazz band led by Jean Goldkette. Founded in 1924, it was considered by Rex Stewart to be the best dance band of its day and the \"first original white swing band.\" It was known for its innovative arrangements and strong rhythm. Among its members were: * Bix Beiderbecke * Steve Brown * Hoagy Carmichael * Jimmy Dorsey * Tommy Dorsey * Eddie Lang * Pee Wee Russell * Frankie Trumbauer * Joe Venuti * Bill Rank Among the band's own arrangers was Russ Morgan; the band also traded arrangements with Fletcher Henderson. The band's most popular records included \"After I Say I'm Sorry,\" \"Dinah,\" \"Gimme a Little Kiss, Will Ya, Huh?\" and \"Lonesome and Sorry.\" According to Rex Stewart, the primitive recording techniques of the day (for example, bass and snare drums could not be recorded) failed to provide a true record of the band.
