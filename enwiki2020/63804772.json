    "text": "Merimepodib (VX-497) is a drug which acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is required for the synthesis of nucleotide bases containing guanine. This consequently inhibits synthesis of DNA and RNA, and results in antiviral and immunosuppressive effects. It progressed as far as Phase 2b human clinical trials against Hepatitis C but showed only modest benefits in comparison to existing treatments, however it continues to be researched, and also shows activity against other viral diseases such as Zika virus and foot and mouth disease virus. Merimepodib is being investigated in combination with remdesivir in phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S. as a potential treatment of COVID-19 by ViralClear Pharmaceuticals. The results are expected in August 2020. == References == Category:Anti-RNA virus drugs Category:Antivirals ",
