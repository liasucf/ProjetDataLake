    "text": "Rock & Roll Divorce is the second live album by the Finnish rock band Hanoi Rocks, released in 1985. It was recorded at the last concert before they split in May 1985 at the Rockerina Festival in Poland. It is widely regarded as the sound of a great band falling apart. This is also the only Hanoi Rocks album to feature Ren\u00e9 Berg on bass and Terry Chimes on drums. Michael Monroe was going to leave the band before this album was released, but agreed to do a small tour in Poland, on the condition that a live record wouldn't be released. Rock & Roll Divorce was a half-official release. According to Hanoi Rocks' autobiography, the album was the last date of the Polish-tour recorded by Mick Staplehurst. Which isn't quite correct, it was actually taken from several shows but mainly from Gdansk and for that reason it should have been called 'The Solidarity Tapes'. It was originally put together for the amusement of band members only! Hanoi Rocks' former manager Seppo Vesterinen, has stated that: \"Rock & Roll Divorce was an awful record that should have never been released.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Michael Monroe \u2013 Vocals *Andy McCoy \u2013 Guitars *Nasty Suicide \u2013 Guitars *Ren\u00e9 Berg \u2013 Bass *Terry Chimes \u2013 Drums ==Chart positions== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !!
