To build the boats either 21 (for the small variant) or 27 (for the larger variant) pieces of wood are used, where different kinds of wood are used for different pieces. For painting the boat only the colors black, white and red are used. The colors are produced from materials found naturally on the island. This boat is exhibited as original, not model.Description 7, Tamkang University Maritime Museum, Tamkang University, Taiwan. *A New Zealand M\u0101ori War Canoe (Ngatokimatawhaorua).
