He built a three-kilometre-long bridge in less than three months during the Siege of Hamburg in 1813. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. ==Biography== Louis Didier Jousselin was born at Blois on 1 April 1776.Joubert-Bonnaire Jouvenel, assemblee-nationale.fr, p.438, accessed April 2010 His father was a lawyer who was also interested in politics. Jousselin was successfully admitted as one of the first students at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he graduated two years later.Histoire de l'\u00c9cole polytechnique, Ambroise Fourcy, p.395, 1828, accessed April 2010 After becoming a qualified engineer he was sent to assist with the Northern Canal near Maastricht in May 1808.L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur_Jousselin L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur Jousselin, fr.wikisource.org, accessed April 2010 ==Siege of Hamburg== By 1811 the canal had been completed and Jousselin was appointed Chief Engineer for Hamburg; a city that was then under French control. He fortified the town and was recognised for the role he played in securing the city whilst it was under siege by the Russian Army and in containing a population who were not supportive of the French invaders. The bridge at Hamburg Jousselin built a bridge which was useful to those defending the siege. Marshal Davout needed to get supplies across the River Elbe. His advisors advised that boats were the only solution. Jousselin was summoned and he said he could build a bridge in three months if he was given every material he would ask for. The Marshal agreed to the commitment. The bridge was not only built, but built well within the time that Jousselin had estimated. The bridge was three kilometres long and linked Hamburg over low ground with Harburg. Marshal Devout wrote to his wife in October 1813 assuring her that Hamburg was now impregnable. The bridge was described as beautiful and prodigious. Jousselin was praised as the Marshal could not believe the amount of work that had been achieved. The bridge was constructed in 1813. Hamburg was particularly important as it was on the supply lines of Napoleon's army. Hamburg was only surrendered when orders came from the French King following the fall of Napoleon. ==France== On 24 April 1814, he was sent as Chief engineer to Orl\u00e9ans. He was there on 20 March 1815 when he heard of Napoleon's return from Elba. Jousselin returned to Paris and contacted Marshal Davout. Davout obviously remembered the skillful engineer from their work at Hamburg and recommended him further. Davout wrote to the Emperor, telling him of his Jousselin's exploits. He told Napoleon that he would be a prisoner of war in Siberia with his 40,000 soldiers if it had not been for this engineer. Jousselin's contribution was recognized and he was made Inspector General of Bridges. However at the end of Napoleon's \"Hundred Days\", all decrees are recanted and Jousselin returned to Orl\u00e9ans. The bridge he had built at Hamburg was decommissioned in 1817 as it was not maintained by the Germans.Jousselin Didier Louis (1776-1858), souvenir-davout.com, accessed April 2010 However, in Orl\u00e9ans, Chief Engineer Jousselin built quays around the mouth of the Loire. He is credited with saving the inhabitants of Orl\u00e9ans from the floods of 1846, 1856 and 1867; a street was named in his honour. 72 names on the Eiffel tower He was a deputy at Blois from 1831 to 1834. He continued to work as an engineer and did early work on the Canal Lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 la Loire. Jousselin died at Vienne-en-Val on 3 December 1858. ==Legacy== Jousselin was one of the seventy two people whom Gustav Eiffel chose as having made his achievement of building the Eiffel tower possible. He is number 28 in this list.Hydraulic Engineering Legends listed on the Eiffel Tower, Hubert Chanson, docstoc.com, accessed April 2010 His name is on the side opposite the Grenelle.Names on the tower , tour-eiffel.fr, accessed April 2010 A primary school in Vienne-en-Val is named in his honour.

Effectively Jousselin was tall and had an imposing physical stature. ==References== Category:French engineers Category:1776 births Category:1858 deaths Category:\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:People from Blois ",
