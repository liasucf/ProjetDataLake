Halfway airing through the series, the drama was submitted for Korea's censorship board review due to viewers' complaints of it showing excessive violence. It was subsequently issued an advisory warning. OCN then changed its viewing rating from the original of 15+ to 19+ for episodes 11, 12 and 16 in order to make the story as realistic as possible. ==Ratings== In this table, represent the lowest ratings and represent the highest ratings. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"3\" | ! rowspan=\"3\" |Original broadcast date ! rowspan=\"3\" |Title ! colspan=\"3\" |Average audience share |- ! width=\"90\"| TNmS ! colspan=\"2\" |AGB Nielsen |- ! width=\"90\"|Nationwide ! width=\"90\"|Nationwide ! width=\"90\"|Seoul |- ! 1 | January 14, 2017 || A Voice in the Dark () | | | |- ! 2 | January 15, 2017 || rowspan=\"2\"| Healing Mother's Two Faces () | 2.1% | 2.986% | 2.267% |- ! 3 | January 21, 2017 | | | 5.383% |- ! 4 | January 22, 2017 || rowspan=\"2\" | Dark Generic Bell Sound: The Secret of the Chocolate Box () | 2.9% | 3.226% | 2.967% |- ! 5 | February 4, 2017 | 4.3% | 5.339% | 5.540% |- ! 6 | February 5, 2017 || rowspan=\"4\" | Secret of the Trash House: The Pupil in the Wall () | 3.1% | 4.236% | 3.130% |- ! 7 | February 11, 2017 | 4.4% | 4.032% | 3.541% |- ! 8 | February 12, 2017 | 4.0% | 4.663% | 4.354% |- ! 9 | February 18, 2017 | 4.4% | 4.974% | 5.380% |- ! 10 | February 19, 2017 || rowspan=\"2\" | Devil's Whisperer () | 4.3% | 5.358% | |- ! 11 | February 25, 2017 | 4.1% | 4.192% | 4.396% |- ! 12 | February 26, 2017 || rowspan=\"1\" | A Call from the Fiery Pit () | 4.3% | 4.654% | 5.203% |- ! 13 | March 4, 2017 || rowspan=\"2\" | The Birth of Satan () | 4.0% | 3.886% | 4.061% |- ! 14 | March 5, 2017 | 3.9% | 5.132% | 4.948% |- ! 15 | March 11, 2017 || rowspan=\"2\" | For the Last Golden Time () | 3.4% | 4.222% | 4.758% |- ! 16 | March 12, 2017 | 4.4% | 5.055% | 5.601% |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Average ! ! ! |} * * ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
