As his nisba shows, he came from the locality of Jarjaraya, south of Baghdad. He was born in ca. 785 and began his career as secretary to the former vizier al-Fadl ibn Marwan. When Caliph al-Mutawakkil (reigned 847\u2013861) dismissed the long-serving vizier Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat shortly after his accession, he appointed Muhammad in his place, but soon dismissed him as well due to negligence of his duties. Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862\u2013866) recalled him to the post in September/October 863, and he continued to occupy it until his death in 864/5. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:780s births Category:865 deaths Category:9th-century Arabs Category:Viziers of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Medieval Iraqi people ",
