In 2013, she spent six months on loan with Double Action Ladies FC in Botswana, where she scored 14 goals in less than half a season. ==International career== At the 2008 edition of the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA) Cup, Neshamba made her debut for the Zimbabwe national team. She scored three goals in the 2015 CAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament, including two in the decisive win over Cameroon which clinched Zimbabwe's shock qualification for the final tournament in Brazil. In March 2016, it was reported that a \"chronic\" knee injury was jeopardising Neshamba's place at the Olympic games, and that the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) were failing to pay for her medical care. A London-based expatriate benefactor provided Z$90 for the knee scans she needed. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Zimbabwean women's footballers Category:Zimbabwean expatriate footballers Category:Zimbabwean footballers Category:Zimbabwe women's international footballers Category:Footballers at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic footballers of Zimbabwe Category:Sportspeople from Bulawayo Category:Women's association football forwards ",
