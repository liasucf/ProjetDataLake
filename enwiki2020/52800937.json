    "text": "Modulation doping is a technique for fabricating semiconductors such that the free charge carriers are spatially separated from the donors. Because this eliminates scattering from the donors, modulation-doped semiconductors have very high carrier mobilities. ==History== Modulation doping was conceived in Bell Labs in 1977 following a conversation between Horst St\u00f6rmer and Ray Dingle,https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1998/stormer- bio.html and implemented shortly afterwards by Arthur Gossard. In 1977, St\u00f6rmer and Dan Tsui used a modulation-doped wafer to discover the fractional quantum Hall effect. ==Implementation== Modulation-doped semiconductor crystals are commonly grown by epitaxy to allow successive layers of different semiconductor species to be deposited. One common structure uses a layer of AlGaAs deposited over GaAs, with Si n-type donors in the AlGaAs. ==Applications== ===Field effect transistors=== Modulation-doped transistors can reach high electrical mobilities and therefore fast operation. A modulation-doped field-effect transistor is known as a MODFET.https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/dictionary/terms/modulation- doped-field-effect-transistor-modfet ===Low-temperature electronics=== One advantage of modulation doping is that the charge carriers cannot become trapped on the donors even at the lowest temperatures. For this reason, modulation-doped heterostructures allow electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures. ===Quantum computing=== Modulation-doped two-dimensional electron gases can be gated to create quantum dots. Electrons trapped in these dots can then be operated as quantum bits. ==References== Category:Semiconductor device fabrication ",
