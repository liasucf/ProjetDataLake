Born into a Jewish family, he was raised as a non-Jew but was not baptized. \u201cMany persons have become Jews since Hitler,\" he said. \"I have been a Jew since the murder of Walther Rathenau [in 1922], from which date I have emphasized that I am a Jew.\u201d\u201dEmil Ludwig, Famous Biographer, Calls on Jews to Answer Hitler \u2018in Own Terms\u2019\u201d, The Sentinel (Chicago), 13 August 1936, p. 36.Harry Hansen, \u201cLudwig, Emil,\u201d Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. 7, New York: Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Inc., 1942, p. 231. Ludwig studied law but chose writing as a career. At first he wrote plays and novellas, also working as a journalist. In 1906, he moved to Switzerland, but, during World War I, he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Berliner Tageblatt in Vienna and Istanbul. He became a Swiss citizen in 1932, later emigrating to the United States in 1940. At the end of the Second World War, he went to Germany as a journalist, and it is to him that we owe the retrieving of Goethe's and Schiller's coffins, which had disappeared from Weimar in 1943/44. He returned to Switzerland after the war and died in 1948, in Moscia, near Ascona. In 1944, Ludwig wrote a letter to The New York Times where he urged that \"Hitler\u2019s fanaticism against the Jews could be exploited by the Allies. The Three Powers should send a proclamation to the German people through leaflets and to the German Government through neutral countries; threatening that further murdering of Jews would involve terrible retaliation after victory. This would drive a wedge into the already existing dissension of the generals and the Nazis, and also between ultra- Nazis and other Germans.\u201dEmil Ludwig Says Hitler\u2019s Anti-semitism Can Be Exploited by Allies to Split Germans JTA.com During the 1920s, he achieved international fame for his popular biographies which combined historical fact and fiction with psychological analysis. After his biography of Goethe was published in 1920, he wrote several similar biographies, including one about Bismarck (1922-24) and another about Jesus (1928). As Ludwig's biographies were popular outside of Germany and were widely translated, he was one of the fortunate \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had an income while living in the United States. His writings were considered particularly dangerous by Goebbels, who mentioned him in his journal. Ludwig interviewed Benito Mussolini and on 1 December 1929 Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. His interview with the founder of the Republic of Turkey appeared in Wiener Freie Presse in March 1930, addressing issues of religion and music. He also interviewed Joseph Stalin in Moscow on 13 December 1931. An excerpt from this interview is included in Stalin's book on Lenin. Ludwig describes this interview in his biography of Stalin. Ludwig's extended interviews with T.G. Masaryk, founder and longtime president of Czechoslovakia, appeared as Defender of Democracy in 1936. == French and English editions of works by Ludwig == The following French editions of Emil Ludwig's books were published in the period 1926-1940: Biographies: Goethe (3 volumes), Napol\u00e9on, Bismarck, Trois Titans, Lincoln, Le Fils de l'Homme, Le Nil (2 volumes).
