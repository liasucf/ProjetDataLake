    "text": "The College of Environmental Design, also known as the Berkeley CED, or simply CED, is one of 14 schools and colleges at the University of California, Berkeley. The school is located in Wurster Hall on the southeast corner of the main UC Berkeley campus. It is composed of three departments: * Architecture * City and Regional Planning * Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning CED is consistently ranked as one of the most prestigious design schools in the U.S. and the world. The Graduate Program in Architecture is currently ranked No. 6 in the world through QS World University Rankings subject rankings. The Architecture program has also been recognized as the top public program by the journal DesignIntelligence and is currently ranked No. 6 in the United States. The Urban Planning program is currently ranked No. 2 by Planetizen. == History == In 1894, Bernard Maybeck was appointed instructor in drawing at the Civil Engineering College of the University of California. A school of architecture did not yet exist. The School of Architecture at Berkeley was developed by John Galen Howard in 1903 followed by the School of Landscape Architecture, established by John Gregg, which began instruction in 1913 and City Planning in 1948. In order to encourage an atmosphere of interdisciplinary study, the three schools, with the Department of Decorative Arts, were brought under one roof and the College of Environmental Design was founded in 1959 by, William Wurster, T.J Kent, Catherine Bauer Wurster, and Vernon DeMars. Originally, the school was located in North Gate Hall. Wurster Hall, the building which currently houses the college opened in 1964 and was designed by Joseph Esherick, Vernon DeMars, and Donald Olsen, members of the CED faculty. One of the CED's early innovations during the 1960s was the development of the \"four-plus-two\" (\"4+2\") course of study for architecture students, meaning a four-year non-professional Bachelor of Arts in Architecture degree followed by a two-year professional Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree. The 4+2 program was meant to address the shortfalls of the traditional 5-year professional Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program, which many architecture educators felt was too rushed and neglected the undergraduate's intellectual development in favor of a strong emphasis on practical design knowledge. The 4+2 program allowed one to receive a broader education including exposure to the liberal arts as an undergraduate and thus a deeper and more thorough education in architectural design as a graduate student. CED was also an early proponent of design for disability and green architecture, and is home to the Center for the Built Environment. In 2009\u20132010, the College of Environmental Design marked its 50th anniversary with a year-long series of events that paid tribute to CED's history and legacy, and engaged the college community in a lively discussion about its future. In March 2015, the college unveiled a 3D-printed sculpture, entitled \"Bloom\", which was composed of an iron oxide-free Portland cement powder. This was the first printed structure of its type. == Undergraduate programs == * Bachelor of Arts, Architecture * Bachelor of Arts, Landscape Architecture * Bachelor of Arts, Sustainable Environmental Design * Bachelor of Arts, Urban Studies == Graduate programs == * Master of Architecture * Master of Design * Master of Urban Designhttps://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/urban-design/master- of-urban-design * Master of City Planning * Master of Landscape Architecture * Master of Real Estate Development and Design *Master of Science, Architecture *Ph.D., Architecture * Ph.D., City and Regional Planning * Ph.D., Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning == Alumni and faculty == === Notable alumni === * Hans Hollein, Pritzker Prize Laureate * David Baker * Kofi Bonner * Alice Ross Carey * Yung Ho Chang, head of the Department of Architecture at MIT * Thomas Church * Edward Cullinan, 2008 recipient of the RIBA Royal Gold Medal * Charles M.
