It is located at 37\u00b0 15' S 150\u00b0 03' E, within Ben Boyd National Park, south of Eden, New South Wales. The headland forms the northern boundary of Disaster Bay. The Green Cape Lighthouse, the southernmost lighthouse in New South Wales, was mostly constructed by Albert Aspinall, who constructed a wooden tramway from the nearest landfall at Bittangabee Bay for the purpose. On May 31 1886 The SS Ly-Ee-Moon en route to Sydney from Melbourne, struck a reef close to the cape at night. 71 souls were lost with the lighthouse keepers only being able to save 15 people under the conditions. ==Heritage listings== Green Cape has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Green Cape Road: Green Cape Maritime Precinct ==References== *Green Cape at the Gazetteer of Australia Online Category:Headlands of New South Wales Category:Coastline of New South Wales Category:Localities in New South Wales ",
