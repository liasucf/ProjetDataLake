    "text": "Bamunkumbit is one of the thirteen villages that make up Ngo-Ketunjia Division of the North West Region, Cameroon. Officially called Bamunkumbit, it is also referred to by the indigenes as Mankong. ==History== Mangeh villages believe that Mangeh had five children, two sons (Tuningmungwa and Chengfong) and three daughters (Byiae, Vhenji and Mekheng). The eldest Tunigmungwa succeeded their father and formed Bambalang while his brother Chengfong established the Bamunka village whereas Byiae formed Bamali, Vhenji formed Bafanji and Mekheng the Bamunkumbit village. Bambalang and Bamunka were descendants of the males (sons of Mangeh) while Bafanji, Bamunkumbit and Bamali are the descendants of the daughters. These five villages have formed the Mangeh Family Association to maintain peace and unity amongst themselves to ensure progress of all. These villages have no defined boundary between them because they know that they are one. Mangeh branches are found all over the country and abroad. ==Location== As one of the five villages that make up Balikumbat Subdivision under Ngo-Ketunjia Division, Bamunkumbit shares a common boundary with Bafanji, Baligashu, Balikumbat, Baligansin (all in the North West Region) and Bamenyan (in the West Region). https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4439483&fid;=1364&c;=cameroonhttps://www.facebook.com/macuda.mankong ==Religion== More than half of Bamunkumbit villagers, particularly the elderly, are traditionalists. They hold so firmly to their native beliefs and the worship of the kwifor. The Kwifor is the secret and supreme authority believed to be governing the village spiritually whereas the Fon is physical leader who governs the village. All villagers, with the Fon inclusive, are expected to be submissive to the Kwifor. The minority Mbororo community of Bamunkumbit are Muslims and they worship Alla. There is equally a dominant presence of christian churches in Bamunkumbit village with the most common ones being: Catholic, Presbyterian, Baptist, Full Gospel etc. In the year 2004, there was a great persecution of Christians who belonged to the Apostolic Church denomination. These Christians were accused by the traditionalists for interfering in their tradition and were severely tortured and compelled to denounce their faith. Those who didn't denounce their faith were eventually driven out of the village. The Apostolic Church house was torn down in the process. ==Economic Activities== Bamunkumbit is a rural community with the greatest proportion of the population engaged in farming. The farming sector employs more that 70% of the total population. The farming population is mostly made up of the middle-aged and the aged. Farming in this village mostly for household consumption, with very little left for commercialization. Most of the youths often move out of the village into the cities for greener pastures. They mainly get involved in business or education. ==Agricultural Land Use== As an agricultural community, Bamunkumbit has a rich diversity of crops. Some of the crops cultivated in Bamunkumbit include: maize, groundnuts, beans, soya, cassava, yams, rice, cocoa-yams, etc. A great proportion of the population is also involved in grazing.http://thesuncameroon.cm/index.php/2019/11/20/bamunkumbit- afforestation-project-counter-influence-climate-change Cattle in this village are mostly reared by the Mbororo community. https://www.weatheravenue.com/en/africa/cm/nord-ouest/bamunkumbit- pictures.html ==References== == See also == * Balikumbat Category:Populated places in Northwest Region (Cameroon) ",
