She was the wife and literary executor of Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. Mathews was born in Melbourne, and met Davies at the University of Oxford. Sharing an interest in theatre, they became engaged at the Old Vic in 1939 and married in 1940. Returning to Canada, they settled in Peterborough, Ontario, and had three daughters. Brenda gave up her career in the theatre. Her influence on Davies extended to persuading him to begin writing novels after some success as a playwright and to become principal of Massey College. After Davies' death in 1995, she and one of their daughters, Jennifer Surridge, became literary executors for his estate, and formed the company Pendragon Ink for this purpose. Together they edited one volume of Davies' criticism. She was the sister of Maisie Purves Smith, who became the second wife of the painter Sir Russell Drysdale.Graeme Skinner, \"Pete and Tass: Sculthorpe and Drysdale\", ABC Radio 24 Hours, August 1997, p. 34 ==Bibliography== *Davies, Robertson, Happy Alchemy (1997) (edited by Jennifer Surridge and Brenda Davies) ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Australian emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian editors Category:Australian editors Category:Australian women editors Category:Canadian women editors ",
