Press release, PDF download. The company was founded by Frederick B. Pemberton, a son of Joseph Despard Pemberton, who was responsible for the land surveying of the area. Pemberton Holmes has Vancouver Island branch offices located in Victoria, Oak Bay., Sooke, Sidney, Duncan, Ladysmith, Nanaimo, Parksville, Bowser, and Courtenay. The Pemberton Holmes telephone number may be one of the oldest in Canada. Victoria was among the first cities in Canada to have telephone service: Pemberton & Son were issued exchange number 8124, which later evolved to its current phone number, 250-384-8124. == History == Joseph Despard Pemberton === Joseph Despard Pemberton === The company began in 1850 when Joseph Despard Pemberton of Victoria, British Columbia, was employed by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company as \u201ca Surveyor and Engineer of thorough business habits and energy with reference the Colonization of Vancouver\u2019s Island\u201d. The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s Minutes of January 22, 1851 contain this description of J.D. Pemberton's arrangement with the company: > \u201cThe certificates of Mr. J.D. Pemberton having been taken into > consideration, it was ordered that he be engaged as Surveyor for Vancouver\u2019s > Island at an Annual Salary of 400 pounds for a term of three years with a > premium of such sum as the Governor and Committee may approve at the end of > that period not exceeding 500 pounds provided they shall consider his > services and conduct perfectly satisfactory. It is understood that he shall > make himself generally useful to Mr. Douglas in all colonization business. > This engagement is to be a charge upon the Colonization Fund to be held in > Trust by the Company. It is also understood that the Company is to provide > an outfit of the requisite instruments at a cost not exceeding 100 pounds \u2013 > to pay Mr. Pemberton\u2019s expenses of conveyance to the Island \u2013 and that the > salary and commencement of the contract shall date from his arrival on the > Island.\u201d On February 15, 1851 he received instructions to proceed by Royal Mail Steam Packet leaving South Hampton on February 17th to San Francisco. From San Francisco he was to \u201cproceed either by the monthly mail steamer or by an occasional sailing vessel\u201d to the Columbia River and \u201ceither by mail boat or by canoe\u201d to Fort Vancouver. On arrival at Fort Victoria he was to report to \u201cMr. Chief Factor Douglas\u201d. On June 24th, 1851, after a journey of more than four months, Joseph Despard Pemberton moved into Fort Victoria to take up His Hudson\u2019s Bay Company appointment as Surveyor for Vancouver\u2019s Island. He played an integral part in the development of the area, laying out Victoria\u2019s town site, surveying from Sooke to Nanaimo, and detailing the topography and natural resources. After serving as Surveyor-General to both the Colony of Vancouver\u2019s Island and Fraser\u2019s River, he later became a member of the first Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. === Fred B. Pemberton === Fred B. Pemberton Frederick B. Pemberton was born in Victoria, B.C. on April 26, 1865, the eldest son of Joseph Despard Pemberton and Theresa Jane Despard Pemberton (n\u00e9e Grautoff). At the University College of London, he studied civil and mechanical engineering, graduating in 1886. He had his credentials as a notary public, justice of the peace, surveyor and miner. In 1887, Joseph Pemberton and his eldest son Frederick Bernard Pemberton (Fred) went into business under the name of Pemberton & Son \u2013 Engineers, Surveyors, and Real Estate Agents. Part of a two page memorandum written by Fred Pemberton reads: \u201cA rustling office would not in the long run pay us as well as one conducted on quiet and strict commercial principles\u201d. For the first year, they concentrated mainly on engineering and surveying. On the 29th of November, 1888, they opened an office on Fort Street; on the property at the south-west corner of Broad Street. The firm was engaged in both the mortgage business and the property management business, which was then known as the Rentals business. In 1893, they began to sell fire insurance as agents of Sun Insurance Office. In 1893, Joseph Pemberton died, leaving the business to his 28 year old son, Fred. === Cuthbert Holmes === Cuthbert Holmes Henry Cuthbert Holmes was born in Bellary, Madras Presidency, India, on December 15, 1890. Cuthbert Holmes came to Canada ca. 1902. In the First World War, he served with both the Indian Army and the Irish Guards, rising to the rank of Major. He married Philippa Despard Pemberton (daughter of Frederick Bernard Pemberton) in Victoria, B.C. on October 12, 1917. In 1920 Cuthbert Holmes joined his father-in-law, Fred Pemberton, in Pemberton & Son. In 1933, Holmes became president of Pemberton & Son Ltd., the company which became Pemberton Holmes Ltd. in 1944. On Cuthbert's retirement in 1967, his son Philip (\u201cPip Holmes\u201d) Holmes took over as President and was joined later by his two brothers, Desmond and Vincent, and Desmond\u2019s son Richard. Cuthbert Holmes Park is named after him and is located in the District of Saanich, a municipality near Victoria, British Columbia. === Philip \"Pip\" Holmes === Pip Holmes In 1945, Pip joined the organization and became president in 1965. He was elected chairman of the Provincial Capital Commission and served as vice-chairman of University of Victoria's board of governors. As president of the Paris-based International Real Estate Federation from 1975 to 1977, Holmes was the youngest person and first Canadian elected to that office. While president of the International Real Estate Federation, he visited member countries to encourage training and education for real estate professionals. He was an advocate of the right to shelter, the right to own land, and land stewardship. On Vancouver Island, a number of properties were influenced by Holmes including the Cathedral Grove nature preserve, the Municipality of Oak Bay, the linear park beside the Trans Canada Highway, and the Victoria Golf Club, which was sold at a discount to preserve land as green space. He believed that Vancouver Island could emulate Switzerland with high employment, good incomes, and green fields if the principles of good stewardship were in place. === Phil Holmes === In 1988, Pip retired and his nephew, Phil Holmes, took over and ran the company through to 2003. Phil Holmes is the son of Dr. Terry Holmes, the younger brother of Cuthbert Holmes. Phil Holmes moved the office from its downtown location on Government Street to 805 Cloverdale Avenue. He focused on growing the insurance branch of the company. Later, Phil purchased Harbord Insurance and he merged the two firms into one. In 2003, Phil sold Pemberton Holmes Ltd. to Mike Holmes who is the current president of the company. === Michael P. A. Holmes === Michael P.A. Holmes Mike Holmes was raised in Metchosin on a farm and later attended Brentwood College and the University of Victoria where he majored in Economics and Law. He joined the firm of Jones Emery as an articling student and eventually became a partner, practicing mainly in the areas of real estate and business. == Eponymous locations == === The Pemberton Building === In 1899, Charles A. Vernon of the B.C. Pottery Company constructed a building at the corner of Broughton and Government Streets in Victoria, BC. A few years later it became the offices of Pemberton Holmes Realtors. Originally the site of Fort Victoria, a tablet was affixed to the building to mark the historical site. In 1910, a new building was constructed at Fort and Broad Streets that became the offices of Pemberton & Son. The Victoria, B.C. archives are home to a number of photographs of the interior and exterior of the building in various states of construction. === The Pemberton Chapel === In 1909, the Pemberton Memorial Chapel was designed by J.C.M. Keith and constructed on the grounds of The Royal Jubilee Hospital by Parfitt Brothers. Mrs. Pemberton donated the Pemberton Chapel to the Jubilee as a memorial of her husband. The chapel functioned as a regular church that held weekly services for patients and staff, as well as being the location of many of the nurse\u2019s weddings. The Victoria Heritage Association describes it in this excerpt: > \"A bridge from the modern hospital building, which wraps around it, replaces > the original granite entry stair. The roof, with its original slate, is > hipped, with a gable on the east end, over a modest rose window. The nave is > rectangular, while the apse is semi-octagonal. Heavy timbers spring from > hand-painted brackets to support the roof. The interior walls are panelled > in stained and varnished wainscotting, with matching pews and furnishings; > the walls above the panelling are natural brick. The windows throughout are > simple diamond lights in round arched openings. The Norman-style chancel > arch and the west windows are emphasized with terracotta mouldings. A choir > loft at the rear now houses an organ.\" === Pemberton Memorial Operating Room === In 1896, the Pemberton Memorial Operating Room was built for the sum of $3,614.00 with funds donated by the estate of J. D. Pemberton. The facility featured \"easily cleaned ceramic tile floor, radiused plaster walls, modern hot water system, and an attached sterilizing room\"; features considered state-of-art during the period of its construction. The Pemberton Memorial Operating Room was designated a national historic site of Canada in 2004. == Donation of archives == In 2012, the company donated their historical business archives to the Royal BC Museum in order to make these artifacts available for study now and in the future. The collection included more than 2400 client files, 300 photos, maps, plans, and approximately 180 bound volumes of correspondence. It is one of the largest collections of single business holdings to be donated to the Royal BC Museum. The donation was reported on by local newspapers and television stations, including Shaw TV == References == == External links == * British Columbia Archives: Frederick Bernard Pemberton photograph * British Columbia Archives: Correspondence collection for J.D.
