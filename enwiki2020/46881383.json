    "text": "M\u00fchlheim-Dietesheim station is a railway station serving the town of M\u00fchlheim am Main, approximately 13 km to the east of the city of Frankfurt am Main in Hesse, Germany. Its two platforms are serviced exclusively by S-Bahn trains S8 and S9, which run from Wiesbaden in the west to Hanau in the east via Frankfurt airport, Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof and the city tunnel, and Offenbach Ost. Trains call approximately every half an hour during the day, with more frequent quarter-hourly services during the rush hour. Late in the evenings, early in the mornings, and on Sundays, services are restricted to once an hour in either direction, as other S8 and S9 services terminate at Offenbach Ost instead of Hanau Hbf. The Frankfurt-Hanau railway line, built in 1863, runs past M\u00fchlheim-Dietesheim, but no train services on the line call at the station. The station was opened in the mid-1990s, following the completion of the Offenbach city tunnel and the expansion of the Rhine-Main S-bahn network. ==External links== ==References== Category:Rhine-Main S-Bahn stations Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1995 ",
