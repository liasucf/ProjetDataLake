    "text": "La Fl\u00e8che () is a town and commune in the French department of Sarthe, in the Pays de la Loire region in the Loire Valley. It is the sub-prefecture of the South-Sarthe, the chief district and the chief city of a canton, and the second most populous city of the department. The city is part of the Community of communes of the Pays La Fl\u00e8che. The inhabitants of the town are called Les Fl\u00e8chois. It is classified as a country of art and history. The Prytan\u00e9e National Militaire is located in La Fl\u00e8che. ==Geography== La Fl\u00e8che is located on the Loir River and is also on the Greenwich Meridian. It is located halfway between Le Mans (45 km) and Angers. ==City communes== * Sainte-Colombe * Saint-Germain-du-Val * Verron ==Neighboring municipalities== Le Loir \u00e0 La Fl\u00e8che * Bazouges Cr\u00e9 sur Loir * Crosmi\u00e8res * Villaines-sous-Malicorne * Bousse * Clermont-Cr\u00e9ans * Mareil-sur-Loir * Thor\u00e9e-les-Pins * Baug\u00e9-en-Anjou (Maine-et-Loire) ==History== Coll\u00e8ge La Fl\u00e8che (1695) The origin of the name La Fl\u00e8che is uncertain; the word fl\u00e8che means \"arrow\" in French. Historian Jacques Termeau, in La Fl\u00e8che Book No. 9, p. 5-11, has documented several hypotheses which most likely are related to the ancient Latin name Fixa meaning \"stuck\", that is to say \"rock stuck in the ground\". In fact La Fl\u00e8che was a city situated on the border of Maine and Anjou. An ancient megalith boundary would have given this the name Fixa that can be found in early manuscripts in full as Fixa andegavorum, often translated later as La Fl\u00e8che in Anjou, but more precisely meaning the boundary of Anjou. In the Middle Ages, La Fl\u00e8che was a parish of the Diocese of Angers and as such formed an integral part of the province of Anjou and more specifically the Upper Anjou, also called Maine Angevine. In 1343, salt became a state monopoly by order of King Philip VI of Valois, who established the Gabelle, the tax on salt. The Anjou was among the regions of \"high salt tax\" and contained sixteen special tribunals or \"salt warehouses\", including La Fleche. La Fl\u00e8che was at the head of Angevine seneschalship under the Old Regime: the Seneschal of La Fl\u00e8che was dependent on the principal Seneschal of Angers. In 1603, Guillaume Fouquet de la Varenne, lord of La Fl\u00e8che and then Sainte-Suzanne (Mayenne) and Angers, and a friend of Henry IV of France, contributed to the enhancement and diversification of functions of the Angevine city. Henry IV founded a college in which management was entrusted to the Jesuits. They were expelled in 1762 and the college became a \"cadet school\" in 1764, a pre-military academy of Paris. Also in the seventeenth century, settlers from La Fl\u00e8che, under the leadership of J\u00e9r\u00f4me le Royer de la Dauversi\u00e8re, founded Montreal, Quebec. In 1790, during the creation of the French departments, the entire northeastern part of the Anjou region, including La Fl\u00e8che, Le Lude and Ch\u00e2teau-du-Loir, was attached to the new department of Sarthe. On December 8, 1793, during the War in the Vend\u00e9e, the city was stormed by the Vend\u00e9ens at the battle of La Fl\u00e8che. In 1808, Napoleon built the military academy. In 1866, the town of Sainte-Colombe was integrated with La Fl\u00e8che. On 1 January 1965, La Fl\u00e8che absorbed the communes of Saint-Germain-du-Val and Verron. ==Coat of arms== 90px Gules, an arrow in pale, the point upwards between two towers argent, a chief azure, three fleurs de lis or. ==Urban environment and green spaces== Carmes' Park La Fl\u00e8che and the Loire Valley have been certified Cities and Regions of Art and History since 2006. The Parc des Carmes in La Fl\u00e8che has improved the quality of its flowers as part of the town's participation in French Villages and Towns in Bloom rankings, attaining a three flower rating since 1997. The quality of garbage collection in the communes of the La Fl\u00e8che region has been recognized through the 2007 'Qualitri label, a label of the ADEME, which is a first in Sarthe. The city has also put into service municipal vehicles running natural gas. Since July 2008, La Fl\u00e8che, in partnership with the town of Cr\u00e9, has had a regional nature reserve, the first in the Sarthe. This preserves the alluvial marsh area and varied biodiversity present on the reserve that extends over 65 hectares. Parc des Carmes, situated at the foot of the town hall, next to the old gardens of the ch\u00e2teau of Fouquet de la Varenne, allows visitors to explore and discover a few animals as well as an aviary. This park has some remarkable trees, including Araucaria and a young Ginkgo biloba (\"the thousand crowns tree\"). There is also a path from the park to the lakes of Monnerie, along the Loir, under the shade of the trees. ==Economy== The La Fl\u00e8che economy is organized as follows: * 65% commercial, * 22% in industry, * 7% in construction, * 6% in agriculture. The print tradition is still alive in La Fl\u00e8che with the factory Brodard and Taupin (group CPI), a leading European manufacturer of paperback books. ==Demographics== Demographic progression from 1793 to 2006 Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.7) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.7,0.9,0.7) ImageSize = width:800 height:350 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:30 top:30 right:50 DateFormat = x.y Period =from:0 till:20000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:5000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:1791 bar:1792 bar:1793 bar:1794 bar:1795 bar:1796 bar:1797 bar:1798 bar:1799 bar:1800 text:1800 bar:1801 bar:1802 bar:1803 bar:1804 bar:1805 bar:1806 bar:1807 bar:1808 bar:1809 bar:1810 bar:1811 bar:1812 bar:1813 bar:1814 bar:1815 bar:1816 bar:1817 bar:1818 bar:1819 bar:1820 text:1820 bar:1821 bar:1822 bar:1823 bar:1824 bar:1825 bar:1826 bar:1827 bar:1828 bar:1829 bar:1830 bar:1831 bar:1832 bar:1833 bar:1834 bar:1835 bar:1836 bar:1837 bar:1838 bar:1839 bar:1840 text:1840 bar:1841 bar:1842 bar:1843 bar:1844 bar:1845 bar:1846 bar:1847 bar:1848 bar:1849 bar:1850 bar:1851 bar:1852 bar:1853 bar:1854 bar:1855 bar:1856 bar:1857 bar:1858 bar:1859 bar:1860 text:1860 bar:1861 bar:1862 bar:1863 bar:1864 bar:1865 bar:1866 bar:1867 bar:1868 bar:1869 bar:1870 bar:1871 bar:1872 bar:1873 bar:1874 bar:1875 bar:1876 bar:1877 bar:1878 bar:1879 bar:1880 text:1880 bar:1881 bar:1882 bar:1883 bar:1884 bar:1885 bar:1886 bar:1887 bar:1888 bar:1889 bar:1890 bar:1891 bar:1892 bar:1893 bar:1894 bar:1895 bar:1896 bar:1897 bar:1898 bar:1899 bar:1900 text:1900 bar:1901 bar:1902 bar:1903 bar:1904 bar:1905 bar:1906 bar:1907 bar:1908 bar:1909 bar:1910 bar:1911 bar:1912 bar:1913 bar:1914 bar:1915 bar:1916 bar:1917 bar:1918 bar:1919 bar:1920 text:1920 bar:1921 bar:1922 bar:1923 bar:1924 bar:1925 bar:1926 bar:1927 bar:1928 bar:1929 bar:1930 bar:1931 bar:1932 bar:1933 bar:1934 bar:1935 bar:1936 bar:1937 bar:1938 bar:1939 bar:1940 text:1940 bar:1941 bar:1942 bar:1943 bar:1944 bar:1945 bar:1946 bar:1947 bar:1948 bar:1949 bar:1950 bar:1951 bar:1952 bar:1953 bar:1954 bar:1955 bar:1956 bar:1957 bar:1958 bar:1959 bar:1960 text:1960 bar:1961 bar:1962 bar:1963 bar:1964 bar:1965 bar:1966 bar:1967 bar:1968 bar:1969 bar:1970 bar:1971 bar:1972 bar:1973 bar:1974 bar:1975 bar:1976 bar:1977 bar:1978 bar:1979 bar:1980 text:1980 bar:1981 bar:1982 bar:1983 bar:1984 bar:1985 bar:1986 bar:1987 bar:1988 bar:1989 bar:1990 bar:1991 bar:1992 bar:1993 bar:1994 bar:1995 bar:1996 bar:1997 bar:1998 bar:1999 bar:2000 text:2000 bar:2001 bar:2002 bar:2003 bar:2004 bar:2005 bar:2006 bar:2007 PlotData= color:barra width:10 align:left bar:1793 from:0 till: 4897 bar:1800 from:0 till: 5099 bar:1806 from:0 till: 5098 bar:1821 from:0 till: 5387 bar:1831 from:0 till: 6421 bar:1836 from:0 till: 6440 bar:1841 from:0 till: 7009 bar:1846 from:0 till: 6831 bar:1851 from:0 till: 7048 bar:1856 from:0 till: 7147 bar:1861 from:0 till: 7077 bar:1866 from:0 till: 9292 bar:1872 from:0 till: 9341 bar:1876 from:0 till: 9405 bar:1881 from:0 till: 9424 bar:1886 from:0 till: 9841 bar:1891 from:0 till: 10249 bar:1896 from:0 till: 10477 bar:1901 from:0 till: 10519 bar:1906 from:0 till: 10663 bar:1911 from:0 till: 10830 bar:1921 from:0 till:9522 bar:1926 from:0 till:9842 bar:1931 from:0 till:10115 bar:1936 from:0 till:10101 bar:1946 from:0 till: 11293 bar:1954 from:0 till:11275 bar:1962 from:0 till:11092 bar:1968 from:0 till:13768 bar:1975 from:0 till:14516 bar:1982 from:0 till:14752 bar:1990 from:0 till:14953 bar:1999 from:0 till:15241 bar:2007 from:0 till:15258 TextData= fontsize:S pos:(50,10) text:source Cassini et Insee * La Fl\u00e8che is the 582nd most populous commune in France (of which there are over ). ==Local Gastronomy== La Fl\u00e8che \"Black Chicken\" The La Fl\u00e8che breed of chicken from the towns of La Fl\u00e8che and Malicorne-sur-Sarthe is known for its fine flesh, and once made the reputation of La Fl\u00e8che.

The castle was given to the Jesuits by Henri IV in 1604 to found the \"Coll\u00e8ge Royal Henry-Le-Grand\", in order \"to select and train the best minds of the time\". In 1764 following the expulsion of the Jesuits the school was transformed by Louis XV and Choiseul into a military institution designed to train young cadets for admission to the \u00c9cole Militaire. The buildings now accommodate one of six military schools in France. The buildings are arranged around three courtyards which are dominated by the imposing stature of the Church of St. Louis (1607). The work followed a plan developed by Louis M\u00e9tezeau with a row of courtyards roughly the same size. The architect was \u00c9tienne Martellange. The work was completed in 1655 with the construction of the gate of honour with the pediment and the bust of Henri IV. ====Ch\u00e2teau des Carmelites==== The castle, now the City Hall, was originally the mid-eleventh-century fortress that defended the river crossing. Jean de Beaugency and his son H\u00e9lie, the future Count of Maine, expanded and strengthened it towards the end of the eleventh century. It was a wooden fortress sitting on an island and spanning two neighboring islands, and was the subject of several sieges in the twelfth century to the fifteenth century. The castle was rebuilt in 1450, and the ruins of the keep of this period are still standing, with marks left by arrows on the drawbridge and battlements. In the seventeenth century, Louis XIII donated it to the Carmelites who had established and transformed the city. The main building and cloister date from this period. During the Revolution, it became private property of the family Bertron Auger who transformed it again. Having become mayor in 1909, he was the victim of a fire in 1919. It was rebuilt with a different style in the years that followed. The castle is now part of the wedding hall of the town of La Fl\u00e8che, and has two temporary exhibition rooms. ====La Fl\u00e8che Zoo==== Zoological Park of La Fl\u00e8che Created in 1946 by Jacques Bouillault, a naturalist, it is the oldest private park in France. It includes 1,200 animals of 150 species on . This is the premiere tourist destination of the department of Sarthe, with over 300,000 entries per year. The zoo has participated in the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) since 1989. Many new exhibits are added every year. In 2008 the zoo showed the extremely rare white lions of Kruger, of which there are only 200 specimens in the world. ====The Pavilion Fouquet de la Varenne==== Pavillon Fouquet de La Varenne La Fl\u00e8che Fouquet de la Varenne Pavilion is in downtown La Fl\u00e8che. The Pavilion was built in the early seventeenth century. The exterior of the Pavilion may be seen throughout the year; however it is open to visitors only on certain occasions. This pavilion is the only building remaining of the ancient castle of La Fl\u00e8che. ====The Bruere mill ==== Nestled in the hollow of the Loir, the mill of the Bruere allows visitors to discover how the force of the river powers a mechanism via a large wheel, producing flour, electricity and refreshing ice blocks. This is the last mill in France to produce ice. ====Lakes of La Monnerie==== These vast bodies of water of some fifty hectares are equipped with a bathing area that combines water recreation, fitness and nature discovery. The site of the Monnerie is a mosaic of lakes and meadows situated in a bend of the Loire with a rich biodiversity. Many animal and plant species coexist in these places: herons, reed warbler, coot, hare, ermine, green frog, frog, dragonfly, snail, reed, iris, water crowfoot, and water-plantain make this site a popular place for walkers and naturalists. The preservation of these wetlands helps maintain biodiversity. The lakes are the result of the operation of a gravel pit, and wet meadows. Each winter, over thirty migratory species (e.g. greylag goose, pochard, teal) find shelter here. ====The hall and the theater of the Halle au Bl\u00e9 (nicknamed \"The Candy Box\")==== In the Middle Ages there was already a wooden market hall, while the square held the grain market. The halls were rebuilt twice in the eighteenth century. In 1737, they were built of stone and then expanded in 1772 to establish the town hall. Closed to the public since 1947, it was restored to \"authenticity\" in 1998 and was recently renamed as the site of the Corn Exchange. This was rewarded in 2000 by the Rubans du Patrimoine. In 1839, a small Italian theater was added to the first floor. The architect who drew up the plans for the \"little theater\" was Pierre-F\u00e9lix Delarue, who also designed many castles in the region in the second half of the nineteenth century. This is his best-known building of La Fl\u00e8che in the sub-prefecture. The decoration of the room and its dome were planned by Adrien-Louis Lusson, an architect and designer, born in La Fleche on August 4, 1788. He entrusted the work to decorative painters for the Royal Academy of Music. This theater has retained much of its original decor, except for the paintings of the false dome, redesigned in 1923. Since March 1999, performances in the cultural season are scheduled by the Entertainment and Arts Carroi. This rare Italian-French structure is open to public tours during the Heritage Days and the summer season. For groups, the tourist office of the La Fl\u00e8che Region organizes tours. ====The museum and chapel of Providence==== Discovery of the personal effects of Fran\u00e7oise Jamin, founder in the early nineteenth century of the Institute of the Daughters of Saint-C\u0153ur de Marie, told the story of Providence. The chancel and chapel are a unique in the region, with murals of the nineteenth century. ====The manor of Blotti\u00e8re==== Dates from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is a former hunting manor of William Fouquet de la Varenne. It can be visited only during the summer. ====Former Hotel Dieu in La Fl\u00e8che==== In the Museum of the Hospitallers of H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Montreal, her namesake city, stands the ancient steps of the Hotel-Dieu in La Fl\u00e8che. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Royer, lord of La Dauversi\u00e8re, installed the first sisters in the hospital \"Maison Dieu\" of La Fl\u00e8che in 1636. In 1641, he entrusted the task to Jeanne Mance to build a hospital in New France, in Ville-Marie. In 1659, she returned to France with the first three sister carers for Ville-Marie. A century and a half later, during the French Revolution, the nuns were expelled from La Fl\u00e8che. The place was then converted into police station, court and prison. The staircase of the Hotel Dieu was walled in and forgotten. Only during the demolition and restoration of the old prison in 1953 was the oak staircase rediscovered. The town of La Fl\u00e8che offered it to Montreal as a symbol of the long alliance between the two cities. Over 300 years after the arrival of the sisters in Montreal, the staircase resides in the lobby of the museum of the Hospitallers of the H\u00f4tel- Dieu de Montreal. The Hotel-Dieu itself is no longer visible today, separated from the former police station, having been turned into housing, and the present court. The old prisons disappeared as they were subsumed into it. ====Former prisons==== The first prisons were located in La Fl\u00e8che, in the March\u00e9-au-Bl\u00e9, next to the Pr\u00e9sidial, created in 1595 by Henri IV. At the beginning of the nineteenth century they were moved to the bottom of the dead- end street, St. Thomas, on the premises that had been those of the priory of the same name. The unhealthy state of the prisons was denounced August 7, 1807 by Rocher Desperr\u00e9s, a board member, who was concerned about the detention conditions of detainees. Half a century later, the prisoners were again entitled to complain as they were deprived of water because of the erection of the statue of Henri IV, in Pillory Square, which had involved the removal of water pipes. As no one passed the budget at the town hall, the prisoners remained in this state for several years. On May 30, 1933, a presidential decree abolished 14 prisons including that of La Fl\u00e8che. On June 16 of that year, prisoners were transferred to Le Mans. Between 1937 and 1939, during the Spanish Civil War, the old prison was occupied at various times by Spanish refugees (men, women and children). World War II led to the reopening of the prison to hold political prisoners. The prison was finally abolished in 1953. The door of the priory, in the middle of the dead end street, Saint-Thomas, was removed in early 1958. ====Religious heritage==== La Fl\u00e8che, Eglise St Louis (du coll\u00e8ge j\u00e9suite) La Fl\u00e8che has six major religious buildings: * The Church of St. Thomas (early twelfth century and rebuilt in the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries), the main church of the city; * The Church of Sainte- Colombe, freely accessible; * The Church of St. Germain du Val (eleventh and twelfth centuries), freely accessible; * Church Verron, freely accessible; * Chapel of Our Lady of Virtues (no celebrations, but open to the public) is the oldest religious building in the city (Roman times); * The Church of St. Louis is located within the confines of the Prytan\u00e9e National Militaire. ==See also== * Communes of the Sarthe department ==References== ==External links== * Town council website (French) The location of La Fl\u00e8che-(Distances in kilometers by road and Great circle route) Category:Communes of Sarthe Category:Subprefectures in France Category:Anjou ",
