    "text": "Electoral wards post 2011 This list of electoral wards in Pembrokeshire includes council wards, which elect councillors to Pembrokeshire County Council and community wards, which elect councillors to community councils. The county is divided into 60 electoral divisions, each returning one councillor. Some of these divisions are coterminous with communities (civil parishes) of the same name. Most communities have their own elected council (indicated by '*'). There are ten town councils and 52 community councils in the county. The following table lists council divisions, communities, and associated geographical areas: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |County ward |County councillors |Communities |Community wards |Community councillors |- |Amroth c | align=\"center\" | 1 | * Amroth* | Amroth \"First vote for almost three decades\", Western Telegraph, 1 May 2008.
