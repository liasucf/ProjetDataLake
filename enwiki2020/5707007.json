It is a tehsil of many colours and contrasts. Here stands a 108-acre pristine fort of Jadon rulers of the Kshatriya clan, who after migration from Karauli had built this magnificent fortress in the 12th century on a tiny mound, claiming the biggest moat encircling around it. The fort, surrounded by lush green fields, is an ideal destination for nature lovers and a perfect getaway from a chaotic city life.
