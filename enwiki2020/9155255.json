    "text": "This article is a collection of statewide public opinion polls that have been conducted relating to the 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries, typically using standard statistical methodology. ==Candidates== The known candidates with national campaigns are John McCain, and Ron Paul, and Withdrawn candidates include Jim Gilmore, Tommy Thompson, Sam Brownback, John H. Cox, Tom Tancredo, Duncan Hunter, Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani, Alan Keyes and Mitt Romney. Candidates who declined to seek the nomination include George Allen, Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, Bill Frist, Newt Gingrich, Chuck Hagel, Condoleezza Rice, Mark Sanford, and Rick Santorum. One candidate included in some polls who said nothing either way, and did not enter the race is George Pataki. On March 4, 2008, John McCain crossed the delegate threshold and became the presumptive nominee of the GOP in the 2008 election. It is mathematically impossible for Mike Huckabee or Ron Paul, the two remaining candidates on the ballot, to meet or exceed the number of McCain's pledged delegates. ==Polling== ===Alabama===

for the Republican nomination is decided upon how many delegates a candidate receives. In this section we see how many pledged delegates each candidate has received to date ranking from first place (the most delegates) to sixth place (the least delegates). To be nominated, a candidate must win an absolute majority of delegates, or 1,191 delegates. *First Place: John McCain with 12 states and 709 pledged delegates. **Alabama (16) **Alaska (3) **Arkansas (1) **Arizona (50)\u20a9 **California (116)\u20a9 **Connecticut (27)\u20a9 **Delaware (18)\u20a9 **Florida (57)\u20a9 **Georgia (3) **Illinois (54)\u20a9 **Iowa (3) **Massachusetts (17) **Michigan (5) **Missouri (58)\u20a9 **New Hampshire (7)\u20a9 **New Jersey (52)\u20a9 **New York (101)\u20a9 **Nevada (4) **Oklahoma (32)\u20a9 **North Dakota (5) **South Carolina (19)\u20a9 **Tennessee (7) *Second Place: Mitt Romney with 11 states and 269 pledged delegates. **Alaska (12)\u20a9 **Arkansas (1) **California (3) **Colorado (22)\u20a9 **Illinois (2) **Iowa (12) **Maine (18) \u20a9 **Massachusetts (21)\u20a9 **Michigan (24)\u20a9 **Minnesota (36)\u20a9 **Montana (25)\u20a9 **Nevada (18)\u20a9 **New Hampshire (4) **North Dakota (8)\u20a9 **Tennessee (3) **Utah (36)\u20a9 **Wyoming (9)\u20a9 *Third Place: Mike Huckabee with 6 states and 170 (167)*pledged delegates. **Alabama (20)\u20a9 **Alaska (6) **Arkansas (29)\u20a9 **Georgia (45)\u20a9 **Iowa (17)\u20a9 **New Hampshire (1) **Michigan (1) **Nevada (2) **North Dakota (5) **Oklahoma (6) **South Carolina (5) **Tennessee (12)\u20a9 **West Virginia (18/15)\u20a9* *Fourth Place: Ron Paul with no states and 16 (19)*pledged delegates. **Alaska (5) **Iowa (2) **Nevada (4) **North Dakota (5) **West Virginia (0/3)* \u20a9- Means the candidate has won that particular state *According to local news reports, three of Mike Huckabee's delegates from West Virginia were promised to Ron Paul in exchange for support for Huckabee from Paul's caucus supporters in West Virginia. All information comes from ==Predicted results== The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of convention delegates awarded to each state. A simple majority of delegate votes (1,191 out of 2,381) is needed to secure the nomination. The number of convention delegates in Wyoming, New Hampshire, Michigan, South Carolina, and Florida have been cut in half due to scheduling their primary earlier than February 5.
