    "text": "\"Roy's Keen\" is a song by Morrissey, released as a single in October 1997. It was the second single to be taken from the Maladjusted album and was the third Morrissey single not to feature himself on the cover, instead using a photograph of two boys taken by Roger Mayne on London's Southam Street in the 1950s. The single reached number 42 on the UK Singles Chart. Its failure to reach the top 40 meant a performance of the song recorded for Top of the Pops did not air until it was shown on Top of the Pops 2 in 2003. The title is a pun on the name of former Manchester United footballer Roy Keane \u2014 as Morrissey acknowledged during live performances of the song by changing words to \"never seen a keener midfielder\". The song was played over the closing credits of Keane's 2002 documentary As I See It. Despite being released as a single, the song was omitted from Maladjusted's remastered CD reissue in 2009. ==Track listings== ===7\" vinyl and cassette=== # \"Roy's Keen\" # \"Lost\" ===12\" vinyl and CD (UK)=== # \"Roy's Keen\" # \"Lost\" # \"The Edges Are No Longer Parallel\" {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
