    "text": "Henry Cruger Jr. (November 22, 1739April 24, 1827) was an American and British merchant at the time of the American Revolution. He has a unique distinction of having been elected to both the Parliament of Great Britain (MP, 1774\u20131780, 1784\u20131790) and the New York State Senate (1792\u20131796). ==Early life== Henry Cruger was born in New York and was a member of a wealthy merchant family. His parents were Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Harris) Cruger (1716\u20131752) and Henry Cruger Sr. (1707\u20131780), a member of the New York General Assembly and then the Governor- General's Council. His eldest brother, John Harris Cruger, succeeded his father as a member of the governor's council of New York, served as a Loyalist during the War and later moved to England. Two other brothers settled in the West Indies. His younger sister, Mary Cruger, was married to Jacob Walton, also a representative in General Assembly for New York. His paternal grandparents were Maria (n\u00e9e Cuyler) Cruger, an heiress (and sister of Albany Mayor Johannes Cuyler), and John Cruger, an alderman who served as the 38th mayor of New York City and was born in Bristol, England. His uncle John Cruger Jr. served as the 41st mayor of New York City and was the last Speaker of the New York General Assembly. Cruger studied at King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City, but before being graduated he moved to Bristol, England in 1757. ==Career== Upon his relocation to Bristol, he was placed in a family mercantile house and became wealthy until the Stamp Act greatly affected his livelihood and caused him much financial embarrassment. In 1765, Cruger was elected to the Bristol Common Council, a position he held until 1790. He was named sheriff of the city for 1766\u20131767. Cruger was elected a warden of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1768, and Master of the Society in 1781. His father, who came to England in 1775, died in Bristol in 1780. ===Political career=== Cruger, who was known for his \"ready wit and fine conversational powers,\" was elected as Member of Parliament for Bristol as a radical Whig in the 1774 general election in which British policy towards the colonies was an important issue. The other Whig candidate, also elected, but by a smaller majority, was Edmund Burke, who was, among other things, the provincial agent for the Province of New York. In his maiden speech before Parliament, Cruger criticized it for worsening the breach between Britain and her colonies. In 1776, he faulted the ministry for abandoning British sympathizers in the colony of New York. In 1777, he supported the repeal of the Declaratory Act (1766), and by 1780, he favored American independence.Sir Lewis Namier and John Brooks, eds. The House of Commons, 1754-1790, vol. 2 (Oxford University Press, 1964), 280-282. Defeated for reelection in 1780, he became Bristol's mayor in 1781. In the 1784 general election, Cruger was again returned to Parliament as the member for Bristol as a supporter of William Pitt the Younger. Throughout his political career in England he urged conciliation with America. In 1789, he sought in vain for a consular appointment in the United States from Pitt.Henry Cruger Van Schaack, Henry Cruger: the Colleague of Edmund Burke in the British Parliament; a Paper Read before the New-York Historical Society, January 4, 1859 (New York: C. B. Richardson, 1859) Cruger returned to New York in 1790 after an absence of 33 years and was elected as a Federalist to the New York State Senate in 1792, urging conciliation with Great Britain while serving an otherwise undistinguished single four-year term in the 16th to the 19th New York State Legislatures. ==Personal life== Portrait of Cruger's son-in-law, Lawrence Reid Yates, by Gilbert Stuart. Cruger was married three times, firstly in December 1765 to Ellin Hannah Peach, a daughter of Samuel Peach of Tockington a wealthy linen draper and banker. She died in 1767, leaving a son: * Samuel Peach Cruger (1767\u20131845), who changed his name to Samuel Peach Peach by 1788 after inheriting his grandfather Samuel's fortune, and home Tackington House, Gloucester.

After his death, she married her cousin, Judge Henry Walton, with whom she had six children. Henry and Elizabeth returned to New York in 1790, where Elizabeth died shortly thereafter. He married for the third time in 1799, when he was age 60, to Caroline Smith. Together, they were the parents of four more children, including: * Matilda Caroline Cruger (1809\u20131891), the wife of Thomas Jackson Oakley, a New York State Attorney General and U.S. Representative, in 1831.
