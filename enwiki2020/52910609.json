In contrast to most known Methanotrophs Methyloferula stellata is an aerobic acidophilic methanotroph.5, Draft Genome Sequence of Methyloferula stellata AR4, an Obligate Methanotroph Possessing Only a Soluble Methane Monooxygenase This makes it similar to Methylocella spp however it is unable to grow on multicarbon substrates. It's genome was sequenced in March and April 2015. ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Methyloferula stellata at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase *Draft Genome Sequence of Methyloferula stellata AR4, an Obligate Methanotroph Possessing Only a Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Category:Beijerinckiaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2011 ",
