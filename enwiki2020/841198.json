    "text": "The Special Intervention Group (, GIS) is a special forces group created in Algeria in 1987, initially with 400 members. == History == Since 1992, GIS forces have operated within the context of violent confrontation between the Algerian government and Islamic militants; major human rights violations against civilians have been alleged against both sides. A resulting arms embargo against Algeria initially prevented the GIS from obtaining equipment such as night-vision goggles typical for such units. However, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, western mat\u00e9riel vendors were allowed to sell equipment to Algeria in the name of the international War on Terrorism. == Responsibility and training== A sub-unit of the D\u00e9partment du Renseignement et de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (DRS), it is responsible for counter-terrorism. It is based in Algiers and has a base at Blida, 50 km (31 miles) from Algiers.
