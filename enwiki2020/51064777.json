    "text": "\u00c9douard Devicque (1830 \u2013 4 January 1863) was a 19th-century French playwright and novelist. == Biography == After he had presented, in collaboration with Henri Crisafulli, his regular collaborator, a certain number of plays many of which enjoyed a great success, Devicque was better known as a playwright than as a novelist. He made his debut in theatre in 1855 with the drama C\u00e9sar Borgia, which offered the distinction of having been received, learned and mounted in eight days ; Of all his plays, the one was the most successful. Then came the historical drama Marie Stuart en \u00c9cosse, the popular drama Deux faubouriens, le Roi Lear, Girofl\u00e9-Girofla, a drama which, despite the emotional role that was created by Mme. Doche was little appreciated by the public. Finally, the comedy Esther Ramel, where Ana\u00efs Fargueil played the lead role, was a miserable failure, and the play disappeared from the bills almost immediately after the premiere. The complete failure of Esther Ramel, succeeding promising successes, probably discouraged Devicque from theater. It is from this time that, despairing of addressing popular theaters, he began writing novels. When he died, he left many manuscripts to Henri Crisafulli. == Theatre == *1855: C\u00e9sar Borgia, four-act drama, with Henri Crisafulli, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Ambigu, 11 December *1856: Marie Stuart en \u00c9cosse, historical drama in five acts and 12 tableaux, with Henri Crisafulli, Cirque-Olympique *1856: La Mye du roy Louis le unziesme, one-act drama, with \u00c9douard Cadol, Librairie th\u00e9\u00e2trale, Paris *1857 Les Deux Faubouriens, popular drama in five acts and 8 tableaux, with Henri Crisafulli, Cirque-Olympique *1858: Girofl\u00e9-Girofla, five-act drama, with Henri Crisafulli, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 *1858: Le Roi Lear, drama in five acts and 8 tableaux, Cirque-Olympique *1861: Esther Ramel, three-act comedy, with Henri Crisafulli, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville, 10 June. == Novels == *1861: Les M\u00e8res coupables, F.
