    "text": "\"Filling Up with Heaven\" is a song by the British synthpop group The Human League. It is taken from the Octopus album of 1995. \"Filling Up with Heaven\" was the third and final single to be taken from the Octopus album. It was jointly written by lead singer Philip Oakey and Producer Ian Stanley (formerly of Tears for Fears). It was released on 5 June 1995 in a variety of vinyl and CD single formats. These included various third-party remixes of \"Filling Up With Heaven\" and \"John Cleese: is he Funny?\", including mixes by Hardfloor. After the success of the previous two singles it was expected to equal the chart position of Tell Me When and One Man in My Heart. But unlike the two previous singles it was not play listed by BBC Radio 1 and received minimal national airplay, affecting sales. The single eventually peaked at number 36 in the UK singles chart, spending a total of two weeks in the charts.Human League Bio 1990-1999 > ==Music video== Screenshot of Susan Ann Sulley in music video for \"Filling up with Heaven\" 1995 The music video for \"Filling Up with Heaven\" was filmed on a low budget and in a minimalist studio (London's Limehouse Studios), unlike the other music videos for Octopus which were higher end. With rich saturated background colours. It features a series of sweeping steadicam shots of Philip Oakey, with a mainly seated Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall. It is the only one of the Human League\u2019s music videos which Susan Ann Sulley has a long blonde pony tail hairstyle, for the previous two she has short hair, suggesting that she had hair extensions for the video. For the instrumental sections a continual sweeping loop of Neil Sutton playing keyboards is featured. Post production the video was intentionally stylized by deeply enriching the colours and reducing the pixel resolution, giving a digital smudge effect (as illustrated). A licensing fee dispute between EastWest and Virgin Records would prevent the video from being featured on the 2003 Very Best of The Human League DVD. However, in 2016, a remastered version of the video was featured on a DVD included with the deluxe version of the box set A Very British Synthesizer Group. ==Versions== *CD 1 1995, East West (YZ944CD1) #Filling Up with Heaven #Filling Up with Heaven (Neil Mclellan Vocal Mix) #John Cleese; Is He Funny?
