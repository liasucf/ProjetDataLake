    "text": "A low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) or low-power wide-area (LPWA) network or low-power network (LPN) is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long-range communications at a low bit rate among things (connected objects), such as sensors operated on a battery.Beser, Nurettin Burcak. \"Operating cable modems in a low power mode.\" U.S. Patent No. 7,389,528. 17 June 2008.Schwartzman, Alejandro, and Chrisanto Leano. \"Methods and apparatus for enabling and disabling cable modem receiver circuitry.\" U.S. Patent No. 7,587,746. 8 September 2009. The low power, low bit rate and intended use distinguish this type of network from a wireless WAN that is designed to connect users or businesses, and carry more data, using more power. The LPWAN data rate ranges from 0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s per channel.Ferran Adelantado, Xavier Vilajosana, Pere Tuset-Peiro, Borja Martinez, Joan Meli\u00e0-Segu\u00ed and Thomas Watteyne. Understanding the Limits of LoRaWAN (January 2017). A LPWAN may be used to create a private wireless sensor network, but may also be a service or infrastructure offered by a third party, allowing the owners of sensors to deploy them in the field without investing in gateway technology. == Technology attributes == # Long range: The operating range of LPWAN technology varies from a few kilometers in urban areas to over 10 km in rural settings. It can also enable effective data communication in previously infeasible indoor and underground locations. # Low power: Optimized for power consumption, LPWAN transceivers can run on small, inexpensive batteries for up to 20 years # Low cost: LPWAN's simplified, lightweight protocols reduce complexity in hardware design and lower device costs. Its long range combined with a star topology reduce expensive infrastructure requirements, and the use of license-free or licensed bands reduce network costs. ==Platforms and technologies== There are a number of competing standards and vendors in the LPWAN space, the most prominent of which include: * DASH7, a low latency, bi-directional firmware standard that operates over multiple LPWAN radio technologies including LoRa. * Chirp spread spectrum based * Sigfox, UNB-based technology and French company. * LoRa is a proprietary, chirp spread spectrum (CSS) radio modulation technology for LPWAN used by LoRaWAN, Haystack Technologies, and Symphony Link. * MIoTy, implementing Telegram Splitting technology. * Weightless is an open standard, narrowband technology for LPWAN used by Ubiik *Wize is an open and royalty free standard for LPWAN derived from the European Standard Wireless Mbus. ===Ultra-narrow band=== Ultra Narrowband (UNB), modulation technology used for LPWAN by various companies including: * Sigfox, UNB-based technology and French company. * Telensa A Cambridge-based company using UNB-based technology to connect and control streetlights and other city infrastructure. * Nwave, proprietary technology developed in cooperation with MIT. Its first release without error correcting codes also forms the basis of the Weightless-N open protocol.Nwave * Weightless, a set of communication standards from the Weightless SIG. * NB-Fi Protocol, developed by WAVIoT company. === Telegram splitting === Telegram splitting is a standardized LPWAN technology in the license-free spectrum. * MIoTy, telegram-splitting technology standardized by ETSI (TS 103 357). ===Others=== * DASH7 Mode 2 development framework for low power wireless networks, by Haystack Technologies. Runs over many wireless radio standards like LoRa, LTE, 802.15.4g, and others. * LTE Advanced for Machine Type Communications (LTE-M), an evolution of LTE communications for connected things by 3GPP. * MySensors, DIY Home Automation framework supporting different radios including LoRa. * NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT), standardization effort by 3GPP for a LPWAN used in cellular networks, that evolved from Huawei's NB-CIoT effort. * Random phase multiple access (RPMA) from Ingenu, formerly known as On-Ramp Wireless, is based on a variation of CDMA technology for cellular phones, but is purpose-built to use unlicensed 2.4GHz spectrum. * Taggle Byron. A Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) technology from Taggle Systems in Australia. \"How Taggle is spreading LPWAN across Australia\" *Wi-SUN, based on IEEE 802.15.4g. ==See also== * Internet of things * Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) * QRP operation * Slowfeld * Through-the-earth mine communications ==References== Category:Wide area networks Category:Wireless networking ",
