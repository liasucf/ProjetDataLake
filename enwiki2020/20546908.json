Ebrahim Heshmat In the campaign against the movement initiated by Ahmad Shah's court in 1918\u20131919, the central government promised amnesty for the \"Jangali\" leaders who would surrender. Despite Mirza Kuchak Khan's advice, Dr. Heshmat surrendered. In the court he stated that he only wanted to oppose the British forces. The Qajar court reneged its earlier amnesty and condemned Dr. Heshmat to death by hanging. He was hanged in Ghoroghe Kargozari in Rasht on May 13th, 1919. Dr. Heshmat himself put the rope around his neck and despite the audience's sympathy for his bravery, his life was not spared. The Jangal movement took off after this temporary defeat and resulted in the formation of the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic. Dr. Heshmat was buried at \"Chelleh Khaneh\" cemetery in Rasht (Ref.) . After 1979 his statue was erected at the modern day Farhang square in Rasht. Ebrahim Fakhrayi describes in detail a memorable ceremony at his tomb in May 1920 by Mirza Kuchak Khan who was victorious at the time and attended by many people in Rasht. ==References== *Ebrahim Fakhrayi, Sardar-e Jangal (The Commander of the Jungle), Tehran, Iran: Javeedan Pub.,1983. *British Policy in Persia, 1918\u20131925, By Houshang Sabahi, P. 42 * \u062f\u06a9\u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u0645 \u062d\u0634\u0645\u062a \u0637\u0628\u06cc\u0628 \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c\u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f\u060c \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f 1390\u060c \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 (in Persian) * * * Category:People from Lahijan ",
