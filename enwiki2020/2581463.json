It is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== The Tharawal people were the original inhabitants of the region. The open space of the blocks hints at the farming history of the area while the larger homes being built the suburb point to a more recent change in land use.Liston, C: Campbelltown: The Bicentennial History, Allen & Unwin, 1988: p.1-2. The bushland began to be cleared in the late 19th century to be replaced by orchards and other small farms. The area escaped major subdivision during Campbelltown's population boom of the 1970s when the Council zoned the suburb a \"Scenic Protection Area\" with minimum land sizes of . Until then, the area was known as East Minto and, like its neighbour, was named after the Earl of Minto, Gilbert Elliot-Murray- Kynynmound, who was Viceroy of India from 1807\u20131814. In 1973, Campbelltown Council proposed changing the name to Warby, which was rejected by locals who insisted it be called East Minto. This, in turn, was rejected by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, which had a policy against \"East\" and other compass points being added to suburb names. Eastminto, Myrtlefield, Hansen and Kyngmount were also rejected by one side or the other until consensus was reached with Minto Heights in 1976. ==References== ==External links== * [CC-By-SA] * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Campbelltown (New South Wales) ",
