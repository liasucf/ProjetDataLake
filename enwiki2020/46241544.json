    "text": "The Anchorage Fire Department (AFD) provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Areas served by department include the incorporated areas of downtown Anchorage, Bird, Bootleggers Cove, Eagle River, Fairview, Indian, Mountain View, Muldoon, and Spenard, among others. AFD is assisted by two volunteer fire departments operating in the outlying areas of the Anchorage Municipality. ==History== Lt. Livingston of AFD poses with mascot Sparky, a dalmatian, and a pair of schoolchildren named \"Fire Prevention King and Queen\" in 1963. The Anchorage Fire Department was founded in 1915. By 1951, AFD had grown to 50 fire fighters, and saw the beginning of Anchorage's first ambulance service. In 1967, the various fire companies unified as the Greater Anchorage Area Borough Fire Department. In 1975, the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Borough unified, becoming the Municipality of Anchorage. As of 2015, the AFD has a goal of maintaining 315 fire fighters and paramedics on active duty. In June 2018, Deputy Chief Jodie Hettrick was promoted to Fire Chief following the retirement of Denis LeBlanc. Chief Hettrick is the first woman to serve as Chief of the Anchorage Fire Department. == Stations and apparatus == downtown station, responding to a call early in the morning Anchorage Fire Department garage entrance {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
