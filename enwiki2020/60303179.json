The leaflet is anything from circular to broadly quadrangular. It is slightly convex and the edges do not curl down and the lower surfaces have a dense covering of straight, silky hairs which lie flat to the surface. The pods are 6\u201310 mm long and covered rusty hairs or a mixture of pale and rusty hairs. It flowers from December to January. ==Distribution== It is found in north- eastern and far eastern Victoria, far south-eastern New South Wales, and in the Australian Capital Territory. ==Habitat== It is found in alpine and subalpine areas above 800 m in altitude, growing in heath and woodland (often bordered by grassland). ==Etymology== The epithet, sericea, is derived from the Latin, sericeus (silky) and refers to the silky undersurface of the leaflets. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 2012 as Bossiaea sericea by Ian Thompson. The type specimen was collected by Bob Makinson on December 3, 1991 near Omeo, with type specimens kept at CBG and MEL (holotype MEL 234474A, isotype CBG 9106346.1) == References == ==External links== *Images (Flickr: Friends of Chiltern: Bossiaea sericea) sericea Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 2012 Category:Taxa named by Ian R.
