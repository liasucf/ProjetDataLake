In 2017, it attempted to merge its international efforts with US-based Fluent, but eventually discontinued the effort over political concerns. In 2019, it advanced into an arrangement whereby its international subsidiaries were partially divested into a separate company Blue Impact, which was to be purchased by a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Legacy Acquisition led by ex-Procter & Gamble executives Edwin Rigaud and Darryl McCall to publicly list in the United States. == References == Category:Advertising agencies of China ",
