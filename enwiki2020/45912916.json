This years finals had many new changes including a 45-second oral response, a series of 3 questions asked at the US Botanical Gardens, and lightning rounds, where a finalist would get 3 questions in a row, with only 6 seconds to answer each. In one of these rounds, Karan, the state champion of New Jersey was asked \"The Mesabi range contains a large deposit of what metal-bearing mineral?\" Karan's answer of taconite was originally marked wrong (the given answer was iron ore), but later he would object and prove to the judges that his answer was correct. Shriya Yarlagadda, from Michigan maintained a perfect score throughout most of the competition. In the end, the top 2 students were Karan of New Jersey and Shriya of Michigan. Karan got a perfect score of 7/7 in the championship round, while Shriya only missed the first question. \"Mariupol, a city located at the mouth of the Kalmius River, is located on what sea that is an arm of the Black Sea?\" Answer: \"Sea of Azov.\" The final question that clinched the win for Karan was \"If completed, the proposed Grand Inga Dam would become the world\u2019s largest hydropower plant. This dam would be built near Inga Falls on which African river?\" Answer: \"Congo River.\" The Third place winner was Sojas Wagle of Springdale, Arkansas, who won $10,000 in scholarships. Finishing in 4th place was Tejas Badgujar of Allison Park, Pennsylvania. ==References== Category:2015 in Washington, D.C. Category:2015 in education Category:National Geographic Bee ",
