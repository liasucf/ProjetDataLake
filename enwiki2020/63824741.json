It was originally the management building of the Turkish State Railways. Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk used it as a residence and headquarters during the Turkish War of Independence. ==History== The building was built in 1892, during the construction of the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway. The building was built for the management of the railroad administration as part of the Ankara railway station complex located at Ulus, Ankara. On 27 December 1919, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk went to Ankara for the first time to start the Turkish National Movement against the occupation of Turkey. He moved into the railway management building, which was one of the few state buildings in Ankara, and used it as his residence and headquarters during the Turkish War of Independence; to commemorate his stay in the building, it was converted into a historic house and railway museum on 24 December 1964. Atat\u00fcrk's girlfriend, Fikriye Han\u0131m (1887\u20131924), stayed at the building for some time. ==Architecture== The building has two stories. It features corner stones and wooden eaves. The simple, arched windows are the building's only decoration. ==Museum== Atat\u00fcrk's special railroad car he used during his nationwide tours between 1935 and 1938. The ground floor is reserved for the exhibition of railway items used from 1856 until today. These railway items include documents, medals, railroad switches, track samples, and silver tableware used in the dining and sleeping cars. Seals, certificates, identity cards, tickets, license plates of locomotives, telephone, and telegraphy sets used in the railroad communication are also on display. Some personal belongings of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk are displayed on the second floor. In 2006, personal belongings and private photographs of Fikriye Han\u0131m, donated by her nephew, Hayri \u00d6zdin\u00e7er, were included in the museum. The white-painted special railroad car that was used by Atat\u00fcrk during his nationwide tours between 1935 and 1938 is next to the museum building. The car carried Atat\u00fcrk's coffin from \u0130zmit to Ankara on 19 and 20 November 1938. The railroad car was made in Germany. ==Access== The museum is open from 9:00 to 17:00 local time on weekdays; it is closed on weekends and on national and religious holidays.
