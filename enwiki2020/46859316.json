    "text": "Princess Gaoyang (; 627 \u2013 6 March 653) was the seventeenth daughter of Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty. She was his favorite daughter. ==Early life== She was born into the imperial family. Her parents spoiled her and made sure she was well cared for; she had large rooms in the palace and many servants and attendants. ==Affair with Bianji== In her late teens, Gaoyang had an affair with a monk named Bianji (\u8fa9\u673a). They kept it well hidden for a number of years for two reasons: monks were not supposed to have intimate relationships, and the fact that Gaoyang was betrothed to a rich noble named Fang Yi'ai (\u623f\u907a\u611b). After this time, Bianji was taken from the monastery and executed by hanging. ==Later years and death== Gaoyang became bitter after her lover's death. Her betrothal and wedding went as planned though she tried to protest it. Gaoyang and Fang Yi'ai grew closer and bonded over their mutual hatred for the imperial court. Gaoyang and her husband gathered an army and led a rebellion against her brother Emperor Gaozong and his wife Empress Wu. They stormed the palace but were stopped. Gaoyang and her husband were executed by hanging shortly after. ==References== Category:Tang dynasty princesses Category:Emperor Taizong of Tang Category:653 deaths Category:7th-century executions by the Tang dynasty Category:Forced suicides of Chinese people Category:7th-century Chinese women ",
