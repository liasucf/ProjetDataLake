His parents were Harry Shigekiyo Kiyooka and Mary Kiyoshi Kiyooka. Roy's grandfather on the maternal side, a samurai \u014ce Masamichi, was the 17th headmaster of the Mus\u014d Jikiden Eishin-ry\u016b school of swordsmanship. Roy Kiyooka's brother Harry Mitsuo Kiyooka also became an abstract painter, a professor of art, and sometimes a curator of his brother's work. Roy's youngest brother Frank Kiyooka became a potter. In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the family was uprooted and moved to a small town in rural Alberta called Opal. Roy Kiyooka was unable to finish high school. From 1946 to 1949, he studied with Jock Macdonald and Illingworth Holey Kerr at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art. With a scholarship, he was able in 1955 to go to Mexico for eight months to study under James Pinto at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende. In 1956 he began teaching at the Regina College of Art. In Regina, he worked with a group of abstract painters, but Kiyooka left for Vancouver in 1959 and thus was not included in the group show coined the Regina 5. At the time, Kiyooka was very impressed with Clement Greenberg's ideas. In the summers from 1957 to 1959 he took part in the Emma Lake Artists' Workshops of the University of Saskatchewan, and there worked with Will Barnet and Barnett Newman. From 1960 to 1964, he was at the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design), from 1965 to 1970 at the Sir George Williams University in Montr\u00e9al (now Concordia University). In 1971\u201372 he taught at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax and then, from 1973 to 1991, at the Fine Arts Department of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he lived on Keefer Street. He was made an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1965. In the same year he represented Canada in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and won a Silver Medal at the Eighth Sao Paulo Biennial. In 1975, the Vancouver Art Gallery organized a twenty-five-year retrospective of his work. In 1978 he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada. At the end of the 1960s, Kiyooka had lost faith in modernism and stopped painting. He began to use performance, film and music. He also began to work with photography and he produced a few series of sculptures. In 1969, Roy was commissioned to build a sculpture, Abu Ben Adam\u2019s Vinyl Dream, for the Canadian pavilion at Expo \u201870 in Osaka, Japan. While in Japan he made the StoneDGloves: Alms for Soft Palms photographic series, shown at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and later he made 16 Cedar Laminated Sculpture series, shown alongside the Ottoman/Court Suite of silk-screen prints, at the Bau Xi Gallery in Vancouver in May 1971. \u201cPear Tree Pomes\u201d illustrated by David Bolduc (Coach House Press, 1987) was nominated for a Governor General's Literary Award. ==Books== *Kyoto Airs. designed and printed by Takao Tanabe at Periwinkle Press, Vancouver 1964.
