    "text": "Flint Town is an eight episode American documentary television series that was released on Netflix on March 2, 2018. The documentary focuses on the thoughts and conflicted emotions of police officers serving to protect urban areas of Flint, Michigan (unofficially nicknamed \"Flint Town\") struggling with poverty, crime, financially strapped public services and the Flint water crisis. The series covers a period from November 2015 to early 2017, the same time frame as the 2016 presidential election. The department captured on-screen is down from 300 officers to 98 for 100,000 people, the lowest number out of comparably sized cities. Over the course of the episodes, the police faced a crucial millage vote and a city government wrangling over funding. ==Cast== *Bridgette Balasko \u2013 police officer; later officer, CATT (Crime Area Target Team) squad; aspires to be a Federal Investigator; later Homicide Detective *Devon Bernritter \u2013 Captain *John Boismier \u2013 K-9 Officer *Esther Campbell \u2013 Sergeant *Hillary Clinton \u2013 Democratic Presidential Candidate *Jessica Dupnack \u2013 ABC12 News Reporter *Robert Frost \u2013 Sergeant *Timothy Johnson \u2013 Chief of Police, appointed by Mayor Karen Weaver *Dion Reed \u2013 LERTA Cadet turned police officer, son of Maria *Maria Reed \u2013 LERTA Cadet turned police officer, mother of Dion *Bernie Sanders \u2013 Democratic Presidential Candidate *Bill Schuette - Michigan Attorney General *Lewis Spears \u2013 Police Reserve Volunteer *James Tolbert \u2013 former Chief of Police, fired by Mayor Karen Weaver *Donald Trump \u2013 45th President of The United States of America *Jazmin Tuttle \u2013 fianc\u00e9 of Dion Reed *Keith Urquhart \u2013 Sergeant, CATT squad *Scott Watson \u2013 officer, CATT squad *Karen Weaver \u2013 Newly elected Mayor of Flint *James Wheeler \u2013 Field Training Officer *Brian Willingham \u2013 police officer ==Episodes== ==See also== * Decline of Detroit ==References== ==External links== *Flint Town on Netflix * Category:Netflix original documentary television series Category:2010s American documentary television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:Television series by Anonymous Content ",
