For example, if an applicant's credit history indicates proper, timely payments on all outstanding obligations, a lender may judge it more likely that the applicant will make timely payments on the requested loan. Your credit references show as credit tradelines on your credit reports. Whats known as credit tradelines is also known as credit references. Whether the credit reference is a good one depends on if the payments have been made on time or not. The credit limit and payment history in the credit references give other potential creditors an idea on whether an individual will make payments on time or default. Credit references also determine if an individual's credit score. A good credit score is typically a score of 700 and above but, creditors do have their own underwriting guidelines. ==References== == See also == * Credit * Credit risk * Consumer credit risk * Default (finance) * Reference * Credit score Category:Personal finance Category:Credit risk ",
