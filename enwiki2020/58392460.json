Ericinium or Ereikinion () was a town and polis (city-state) of Perrhaebia in ancient Thessaly, situated near the frontiers of Histiaeotis. The existence of the town is attested by epigraphic evidence at least since the 4th century BCE. In the Roman-Seleucid War, in the year 191 BCE, it was taken from the Athamanians by the joint army commanded by the Roman Marcus Baebius Tamphilus and Philip V of Macedon. Its location has been found at the modern village of Megalo Eleftherochori. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Perrhaebia Category:Cities in ancient Greece Category:Thessalian city-states ",
