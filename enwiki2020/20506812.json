    "text": "FriCAS is a general purpose computer algebra system with a strong focus on mathematical research and development of new algorithms. It comprises an interpreter, a compiler and a still-growing libraryFriCAS API of more than 1,000 domains and categories. FriCAS provides a strongly typed high-level programming language called SPAD and a similar interactive language that uses type-inferencing for convenience. Aldor was intentionally developed being the next generation compiler for Axiom and forks. FriCAS (optionally) allows running Aldor programs. Both languages share a similar syntax and a sophisticated (dependent) type system. FriCAS is comprehensively documented and available as source code and as a binary distribution for the most common platforms. Compiling the sources requires besides other prerequisites a Common Lisp environment (whereby many of the major implementations are supported and freely available as open source). FriCAS runs on many POSIX platforms such as Linux, macOS, Unix, BSD as well as under Cygwin and Microsoft Windows (restricted). == History == FriCAS is a descendant of Axiom History (external link) which itself has its origin in Scratchpad, a project that started in 1965 by James Griesmer at IBM laboratories.Axiom history For more details see Axiom/History. == Examples == FriCAS has a rather complete implementation of the Risch\u2013Bronstein\u2013Trager algorithm (Risch algorithm for short). Another useful feature is stream: )set stream calculate 5 exp_series := series(exp x, x=0) \\ \\ \\ \\ 1+x+{{\\frac{1}{2}} \\ {{x}^{2}}}+{{\\frac{1}{6}} \\ {{x}^{3}}}+{{\\frac{1}{24}} \\ {{x}^{4}}}+{{\\frac{1}{120}} \\ {{x}^{5}}}+{O \\left( \\right)} Type: UnivariatePuiseuxSeries(Expression(Integer),x,0) So any coefficient may be retrieved, for instance n=40: coefficient(exp_series,40) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\frac{1}{81591528324789773434 56112695961158942720 00000000} Type: Expression(Integer) ==See also== *List of computer algebra systems ==References== == External links == * FriCAS Homepage * FriCAS Wiki * Try FriCAS online * Documentation at fricas.github.io * FriCAS API (sphinx) * Source code repositories: SourceForge,GitHub mirror * Rosetta stone (pdf) * rosettacode.org, Category:SPAD * Forum: fricas-devel Related: * Axiom * OpenAxiom * A# programming language * Aldor programming language Category:Common Lisp (programming language) software Category:Computer algebra system software for Linux Category:Free computer algebra systems Category:Free software programmed in Lisp Category:Software using the BSD license ",
