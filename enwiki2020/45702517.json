    "text": "Although most of Percy Pitt's compositions seem to have been performed during his lifetime, not everything was published; and not every published work received an opus number. Many of his works were published by Augener, who also published Bridge, Delius and Ireland.See Augener at imslp. A partial list of Pitt's published compositions (both with and without opus numbers) appears in (34 volumes, published between 1904-1910). Some works appear to have been given an opus number after the volume was published some time before 1910. However, gaps still apparently remain in the sequence of opus numbers, e.g. Op. 2, 7, 12, 13 etc.Opus 32 was used for the Oriental Rhapsody, Op. 32a, and for Behold the Name of the Lord, Op. 32 no. 2, although information on Op. 32 no. 1 is not forthcoming. Op. 33 seems to have been used twice. Nevertheless, the opus numbers seem to have been chronologically assigned in approximate composition order. A number of works exist both in versions for orchestra and for piano reduction (solo or duet), and the dates assigned to many of the entries in this incomplete list should be treated with caution. According to his own introduction in Pitt's biography, Henry Wood gave the first performances of most of Pitt's major works after 1896 except the G minor Sinfonietta which was written at the request of Hans Richter, who conducted it at the 1906 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. ==List of works without opus number== ;Orchestra :Suite in D major - Prelude & Bourr\u00e9e (1891) :Orchestral Suite (Suite d'Orchestre?) in four movements (1895) :Overture, \"Taming of the Shrew\".

To the orchestra is assigned, after the manner of Wagner, the most important part. The performance was not satisfactory. Mr. Davies's voice was not in the best condition ; moreover, the orchestral playing was rough and too loud. Even had the rendering of them been faultless, so much thought is pressed into small space \u2014 all the five songs are brief \u2014 that they need more than one hearing.
