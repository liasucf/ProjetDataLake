    "text": "Robert Roy MacGregor (; baptised 7 March 1671 \u2013 died 28 December 1734) was a Scottish outlaw, who later became a folk hero. ==Early life== Rob Roy was born at Glengyle, at the head of Loch Katrine, as recorded in the baptismal register of Buchanan, Stirling. His parents were Donald Glas MacGregor and Margaret Campbell. He was also descended from the Macdonalds of Keppoch through his paternal grandmother.Rob Roy MacGregor His Life and Times, W. H. Murray In January 1693, at Corrie Arklet farm near Inversnaid, he married Mary MacGregor of Comar (1671\u20131745), who was born at Leny Farm, Strathyre. The couple had four sons: James Mor MacGregor (1695\u20131754), Ranald (1706\u20131786), Coll (died 1735:File:Grave of Rob Roy MacGregor.jpg) and Robert (1715\u20131754\u2014known as Robin Oig or Young Rob). It has been argued that they also adopted a cousin named Duncan, but this is not certain. ==Jacobite rising== Along with many Highland clansmen, at the age of eighteen Rob Roy together with his father joined the Jacobite rising of 1689 led by John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, known as Bonnie Dundee, to support the Stuart King James II who had fled Britain during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although victorious in initial battles, Dundee was killed in 1689, deflating the rebellion. Rob's father was taken to jail, where he was held on treason charges for two years. Rob's mother Margaret's health failed during Donald's time in prison. By the time Donald was finally released, his wife was dead. The Gregor chief never returned to his former spirit or health. ==Glen Shira== The remains of Rob Roy MacGregor's house in upper Glen Shira Factor's Island, Loch Katrine, where Rob Roy once imprisoned the Duke's factor Grave site of Rob Roy MacGregor, marking his wife (Helen) Mary, and sons Coll and Robert (Balquhidder) Rob Roy's Putting Stone, a boulder he supposedly used for stone putting, near Lochan nan Eireannaich at the head of Kirkton Glen where the pass leads from Balquhidder to Glen Dochart In 1716 Rob Roy moved to Glen Shira for a short time and lived under the protection of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, also known as Red John of the Battles, \"Iain Ruaidh nan Cath.\" Argyll negotiated an amnesty and protection for Rob and granted him permission to build a house in the Glen for the surrendering up of weapons. \"Traditionally the story goes that Argyll only received a large cache of rusty old weapons.\"Nigel Tranter, Rob Roy MacGregor, New York: Barnes and Noble. (2005 reprint) A sporran and dirk handle which belonged to Rob Roy can still be seen at Inveraray Castle. Rob Roy only used this house occasionally for the next three or four years. In July 1717, Rob Roy and the whole of the Clan Gregor were specifically excluded from the benefits of the Indemnity Act 1717 which had the effect of pardoning all others who took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.Peter Hume Brown, A History of Scotland to the Present Time, p. 154 Despite many claims to the contrary, Rob Roy was not wounded at the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719, in which a British Government army with allied Highlanders defeated a force of Jacobite Scots supported by the Spanish. However,The Jacobite Attempt of 1719, ed by WK Dickson, SHS 1895, Introduction li and p. 272 two of the Jacobite commanders, Lord George Murray and the 5th Earl of Seaforth, were badly wounded. Robert Roy MacGregor is claimed in many accounts to have been wounded, but the actual text of Ormonde's account of the battle has the following: \"Finding himself hard-pressed, Lord Seaforth sent for further support. A reinforcement under Rob Roy went to his aid, but before it reached him the greater part of his men had given way, and he himself had been severely wounded in the arm.\" Note that this does not state that Rob Roy was wounded, but Seaforth. Sometime around 1720 and after the heat of Rob's involvement at the Battle of Glen Shiel had died down, Rob moved to Monachyle Tuarach by Loch Doine and sometime before 1722 Rob finally moved to Inverlochlarig Beag on the Braes of Balquhidder. ==Later life== Rob Roy became a respected cattleman\u2014this was a time when cattle raiding and selling protection against theft were commonplace means of earning a living.Carol Kyros Walker (1997). Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland by Dorothy Wordsworth. Yale University Press. See Appendix 5. Rob Roy borrowed a large sum to increase his own cattle herd, but owing to the disappearance of his chief herder, who was entrusted with the money to bring the cattle back, Rob Roy lost his money and cattle, and defaulted on his loan. As a result, he was branded an outlaw, and his wife and family were evicted from their house at Inversnaid, which was then burned down. After his principal creditor, James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose, seized his lands, Rob Roy waged a private blood feud against the Duke until 1722, when he was forced to surrender. Later imprisoned, he was finally pardoned in 1727. He died in his house at Inverlochlarig Beg, Balquhidder, on 28 December 1734,Louis Albert Necker, A voyage to the Hebrides, or western isles of Scotland;: with observations ..., p. 80 aged 63. Another version of this series of events states that Rob Roy's estates of Craigrostan and Ardess were forfeited for his part in the rebellion of 1715. The Duke of Montrose acquired the property in 1720 by open purchase from the Commissioners of Enquiry. K. Macleay, M.D., in Historical Memoirs of Rob Roy and the Clan MacGregor quotes, \"but he had taken the resolution of becoming a Roman Catholic, and he accordingly left the lonely residence we have described, and returning to Perthshire, went to a Mr. Alexander Drummond, an old priest of that faith, who resided at Drummond Castle.\" Macleay takes the view that Rob did this out of sorrow for his crimes. ==Legacy== Glengyle House, on the shore of Loch Katrine, dates back to the early 18th century, with a porch dated to 1707, and is built on the site of the 17th century stone cottage where Rob Roy is said to have been born. Since the 1930s, the Category B-listed building had been in the hands of successive water authorities, but was identified as surplus to requirements and put up for auction in November 2004, despite objections from the Scottish National Party. The Rob Roy Way, a long distance footpath from Drymen to Pitlochry, was created in 2002 and named in Rob Roy's honour. Descendants of Rob Roy settled around McGregor, Iowa, United States, and in 1849 it was reported that the original MacGregor seal and signet was owned by Alex McGregor of Iowa. The Scots Gaelic clan seal was inscribed \"S' Rioghal Mo Dhream \" (\"Royal is my race\"). The signet was a bloodstone from Loch Lomond, and was sketched by William Williams. In 1878, the football club Kirkintilloch Rob Roy was founded and named in his memory. ==In popular culture== Rob Roy on the Rock, a statue located on the spot where Rob Roy leapt across the Culter Burn, Peterculter, Aberdeen, while on the run from Montrose's men The year 1723 saw the publication of a fictionalised account of his life, The Highland Rogue.English Short-Title Catalogue T109114. Earlier attributions to Daniel Defoe are not accepted today on stylistic grounds; see The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature II 902 and John Robert Moore, A Checklist of the Writings of Daniel Defoe. 2nd edition.

Rob Roy became a legend in his own lifetime, and George I was moved to issue a pardon for his crimes just as he was about to be transported to the colonies. The publication of Rob Roy, by Sir Walter Scott in 1817, further added to his fame and fleshed out his biography. Hector Berlioz was inspired by the book to compose an overture. William Wordsworth wrote a poem called \"Rob Roy's Grave\" during a visit to Scotland.; via Internet Archive (The 1803 tour was documented by his sister Dorothy in Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland. The editor of the book changed the place of burial to the present location.) Adaptations of his story have also been told in film, including the silent film Rob Roy (1922), the Walt Disney Productions film Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue (1953), and the Rob Roy (1995) film directed by Michael Caton-Jones, starring Liam Neeson as the title character, and shot entirely on location in the Scottish Highlands. In 1894, a bartender at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City created the Rob Roy cocktail in honour of the premiere of Rob Roy, an operetta by composer Reginald De Koven and lyricist Harry B. Smith loosely based upon Robert Roy MacGregor. In 2017, a new statue of Rob Roy was commissioned to be installed in Peterculter, Aberdeen. The sculptor appointed was David J. Mitchell, a graduate of Grays School of Art in Aberdeen. The statue was publicly unveiled at a ceremony on the bridge on Saturday 16th September 2017. ==See also== * Auchenbathie Tower * Clan MacGregor * Gilderoy (Outlaw) * Rob Roy (dog), US First Lady Grace Coolidge's pet collie featured in a life-size portrait in the White House ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==External links== * McGregor village museum with a King James Bible bearing Rob Roy's signature * Rob Roy on the Web * FAQs about Rob Roy * \"Robert 'Rob Roy' MacGregor: outlaw and folk hero\", by Brendan O'Brien, from Scotsman.com, 27 Jan 2005. * Category:1671 births Category:1734 deaths Category:Burials in Scotland Category:Scottish outlaws Category:People from Argyll and Bute Category:18th- century Scottish people Category:Scottish folklore Category:Scottish Jacobites Category:People of the Jacobite rising of 1719 ",
