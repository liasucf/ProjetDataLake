Its first edition took place on 29 March 2012 in Caracas and was broadcast on Venevisi\u00f3n. Since its second edition in 2013, it has been broadcast by Televen. ==History== The Pepsi Music Awards were created to recognize Venezuela's musical talent in all its genres, connecting musicians among themselves, with their fans, and with the general public. Each year, the process begins in October through nominations on the website. After that, nominations close and voting begins with a jury chosen by the Pepsi Music Academy. This culminates with ceremonies that take place in September of the following year. The awards have more than 60 categories in which bands or artists who have worked actively from 1 January to 15 December can be nominated. Each winning artist in a category receives a personalized statuette with their name and the name of the category. The awards are delivered through two galas \u2013 one private (not televised) and another broadcast nationwide. ==Pepsi Music Academy== The awards' governing body is the Pepsi Music Academy, comprising connoisseurs of Venezuela's music industry, independent of Pepsi- Cola Venezuela. It is responsible for the dissemination and design of the categories and regulations of each edition of the awards, ensuring compliance for the selection of the five nominees for each category, and later of the winners. It is made up of two types of members differentiated by their participation in the awards' phases: Advisory Members \u2013 personalities with extensive experience and commitment to the country's music industry \u2013 and Specialist Members \u2013 knowledgeable opinion leaders of the music industry with specific strengths in one or more musical genres. ==General categories== ==Specific categories== ==Editions== ===Summary=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\" |- !Year !Edition !Location !Ceremony date !Broadcaster !Presenter(s) !Nominations |- |2012 |1st | Quinta Esmeralda, Caracas |29 March 2012 |Venevisi\u00f3n | Ram\u00f3n Castro and |35 |- |2013 |2nd | rowspan=\"3\" |Eurobuilding Hotel, Caracas |28 May 2013 |Televen | Erika de la Vega and Ram\u00f3n Castro |38 |- |2014 |3rd |24 September 2014 |E! \u2013 Televen | Ram\u00f3n Castro |39 |- |2015 |4th |7 September 2015 | rowspan=\"3\" |Televen | rowspan=\"2\" | Ram\u00f3n Castro and Daniela Kos\u00e1n |48 |- |2017 |5th | rowspan=\"2\" | |16 February 2017 |56 |- |2018 |6th |27 September 2018 |Nacho |68 |} ===2012=== The first edition of the awards took place on 28 March 2012 at the Quinta Esmeralda in Caracas and was broadcast by Venevisi\u00f3n.
