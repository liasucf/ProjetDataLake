Safi Pirak Sibi ==Historical significance== The historical importance of this site in the South Asia is because of its very early horse remains. Also, the site has some very early ironwork and iron artefacts. The ironwork seems to have had a gradual introduction.Raymond Allchin, Bridget Allchin, The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan. Cambridge University Press, 1982 ==Architecture and material culture== The excavator records three phases of unbroken occupation in Safi Pirak. *In the first period, structures of unburnt brick associated with a large platform were found. A major part of the pottery was a coarse ware decorated with applique bands and fingertip impressions. Both terracotta and unburnt clay figurines of horses and camels were found, along with numerous bones of both the species. The earliest indubitable evidence of domestic horse comes from Safi Pirak, during period I (c.1700 BC), well after Mature Harappan period. Terracota button seals of circular, square or curved forms were common. *The second period also showed a similar assemblage with large numbers of terracota and clay figurines, which include not only Bactrian camels and horses but also human figures, including riders. Along with numerous tools of copper and bronze, first pieces of iron are also found. *The third period (c.1000-800 BCE) produced a greater quantity of iron and a continuation of all the elements of the earlier periods. Along with three varieties and two varieties of barley, rice and sorghum were also found here, which is the first recorded appearance of these two cereals in this region.Alchin, Bridget and Frank Raymond Alchin (2003). The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan, Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, , pp.233-4 ==Artefacts found== In addition to pottery items, wheeled camel figures (terracotta) as per Harappan tradition were also found at Pirak. Items made of Iron were also present in this site.S.Settar, Ravi Korisettar (2002) Prehistory, Aracheology of the Harappan Civilisation Different seals were also found. ==Cultivation== Rice was cultivated as main crop in Post urban Pirak and the Kachi Plain was irrigated.
