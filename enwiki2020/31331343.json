It was produced by Albert Broccoli for Warwick Films and features extensive use of footage from Gilling's previous Zarak. ==Plot== A bandit with a price on his head, is seen this time blind for revenge. He thinks that the British have massacred his people, his family, his wife and child. But he is wrong.

Filming started 11 August 1958. ==Critical reception== Variety said \"it cannot be taken seriously.\"Review at Variety *TV Guide wrote, \"it's all chase and melodrama with little care for characterizations.\" *The Radio Times called it a \"very silly Northwest Frontier romp, with Victor Mature in dark make-up as Kasim Khan...romantic interest from forgotten starlet Anne Aubrey and some wince- inducing comic mugging from Anthony Newley. Quite a lot of money was thrown at it, but this remains a B-movie at heart.\" *Sky Movies called the film \"a fiery 19th century adventure yarn that makes little sense but bulges with action that keeps coming at you.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1959 films Category:British historical adventure films Category:1950s historical adventure films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by John Gilling Category:Films set in the British Raj Category:British films Category:Columbia Pictures films ",
