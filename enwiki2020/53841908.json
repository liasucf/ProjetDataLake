In the editor article of the magazine, Sameh Samy sees that \"Ibrahim Aslan\" Ibrahim Aslan is the best writer of the relationship of literature in cinema .. Aslan's novel \"Heron/ malek alhazeen\", which turned to the film \"Kit kat\" by Dawood Abdel-Sayed, a landmark in the relationship literature in cinema, \"literature can be a (mature sight) of cinema. Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed newspaper wrote a newspaper file on the work of Sameh Sami and the film magazine:\"Despite the years of decline in the film industry in Egypt, it must be realized that it is a retreat in \"industry\" rather than \"art.\" The decline comes largely on the heads of manufacturers, the logic of how much production compared to the past, and the relationship with the economic and political situation miserable and extended for a long time, the ratio between exchange and revenue, and so on. On the other hand, you are in front of a much better artistic era than in previous eras with respect to individual awareness and remarkable talents at the level of writing, directing, photography, acting and music. The equation was stimulated by what the Egyptian writer Sameh Samy, the editor of the magazine , put forward in his opening article, which quoted the title of the famous book by Ala Deeb as a \"pause before the slope\", calling on those interested to stand collectively before falling into the slope. Sami talked about crises related to the lack of interest in presenting an idea and does not pay attention to the awareness and expression of people's issues, stressing that there are exceptions\". ==See also== * List of Egyptian authors *:nl:Sameh Samy *:arz:\u0633\u0627\u0645\u062d \u0633\u0627\u0645\u064a ==References== ==External links== *Press Statement *dailynewsegypt *e3lam *article about Sameh Sami And Al film Magazine *Interview *e3lam *wataninewsnet *almdon *shorouknews *alfilm *almasry alyouim *TV Interview *Samy's article Category:Egyptian journalists Category:Egyptian writers Category:Living people Category:1978 births ",
