This allows the stations to drop onto 2nd adjacent frequencies in Salt Lake City, without interfering with other stations in the main market area. All of the stations listed above use booster signals that are synchronized with the main station. These fill in the gaps that the main signal otherwise wouldn't cover well. For example, KSQN has 6 boosters to cover the Salt Lake metro area, which is behind the Wasatch Mountain Range from the main transmitter.KSQN Radio Station Information Stations like this are generally known as \"rimshots.\" ==Geology== Humpy Peak is located on the northwestern flank of the Uinta Mountain range in central Summit County. Geology of the peak is common with Uinta Mountain range as well. The peak is accessible via a road on private property, that begins at Utah State Route 150. The peak is from the Mirror Lake recreation site. Because of its height, and the terrain shadow the Wasatch Range provides, Humpy was likely chosen because signals from the peak cover a significant distance, well into Wyoming. This provides Evanston and surrounding communities in southwestern Wyoming with more radio stations. Stations on the peak often can be received as far northeast as Green River, Wyoming.Green River FM DX ==References== Category:Features of the Uinta Mountains Category:Mountains of Utah Category:Mountains of Summit County, Utah Category:Mass media in Salt Lake City Category:Mountains of Uinta County, Wyoming ",
