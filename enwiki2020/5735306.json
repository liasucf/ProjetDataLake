    "text": "The Body Snatchers is a 1955 science fiction novel by American writer Jack Finney, originally serialized in Colliers Magazine in 1954, which describes real-life Mill Valley, California being invaded by seeds that have drifted to Earth from space. The seeds, grown from plantlike pods, replace sleeping people with perfect physical duplicates with all the same knowledge, memories, scars, etc. but are incapable of human emotion or feeling. The human victims disappear forever. The duplicates live only five years and cannot sexually reproduce; consequently, if unstopped, they will quickly turn Earth into a dead planet and move on to the next world. One of the duplicate invaders claims this is what humans do \u2013 use up resources, wipe out indigenous populations, and destroy ecosystems in the name of survival. The novel has been adapted for the screen four times; the first film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1956, the second in 1978, the third in 1993, and the fourth in 2007. It was also the basis of the 1998 movie The Faculty. Unlike the first three film adaptations, which elected for darker, far more dystopian narratives, the novel contains an optimistic ending, with the aliens voluntarily vacating after deciding that they cannot tolerate the type of resistance they see in the main characters and leaving behind a small population of duplicates who are all hunted and killed shortly after. ==Critical reception== In 1967, Damon Knight criticized the novel's scientific incoherence: Under Jack Finney's entry in The Science Fiction Encyclopedia, John Clute remarks concerning the novel: Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin faulted the original edition, declaring that \"Too many s-f novels lack outstanding originality, but this one lacks it to an outstanding degree.\" F&SF;| reviewer Anthony Boucher found it to be \"intensely readable and unpredictably ingenious\" despite noticeable inconsistencies and its sometimes lack of scientific accuracy. Astounding Science-Fiction reviewer P. Schuyler Miller reported that, once Finney sets out his premise, the novel becomes \"a straight chase yarn, with several nice gimmicks and a not entirely convincing denouement.\" ==Editions== ===First edition=== * * ===Revised edition=== * ===Photonovel=== * It features 350 color stills from the 1978 remake ==See also== * The Day of the Triffids (1951), a science fiction novel by English author John Wyndham, involving tall venomous carnivorous plants capable of locomotion and communication. * The Puppet Masters (1951), a science fiction novel by Robert A.
