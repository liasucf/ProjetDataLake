His brother Alonso recognized what would be Trujillo. We should point out the first Simon Bolivar, from Zenarruza, royal clerk and secretary of the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, who from Santo Domingo passed, in 1589, to Caracas as the first perpetual regidor and procurator general. He was responsible for the creation of schools of first letters and a seminary of grammar directed by Juan de Arteaga and Sim\u00f3n de Basauri (1591). Captain Antonio de Berrio, a pearl seeker in Guayana, goes down the rivers to the Orinoco where he founds San Jose de Oru\u00f1a (1592) and Santo Tom\u00e1s de Guayana (1593, later Angostura). A further mention deserves the new adventure of El Dorado (1561) with Lope de Aguirre and Pedro de Urs\u00faa as protagonists and Barquisimeto as the end point of it. Already in the c. XVII, ranch owners, such as Francisco de Arrieta, Pedro Hern\u00e1ndez de Galarza and Antonio Arraez de Mendoza in the Bobures Valley, Juan F\u00e9lix de Arr\u00faa in the Chama valley, etc. Among the governors and members of the Caracas chapter, Basque's surnames such as Alquiza, Hernani, O\u00f1ate, Aguirre, Hoz de Berrio, Ybarra, Bol\u00edvar, Lezama, Arguinzoniz, Zabala, Arechederra, Mendoza, Arteaga, M\u00faxica and Butr\u00f3n, Villela, Echeverria, Landaeta, Guevara, Zuazo, Arraez, Ochoa, Bera settled on the city. In Barinas, the Ochagav\u00eda, in Barquisimeto the Ansola, in M\u00e9rida the Uzcategui, etc. In the fight against the Dutch pirates of the first third of the century, Navarre Lope D\u00edaz de Armend\u00e1riz (Marquis of Cadreita), Admiral Manuel de Red\u00edn and his brother, Captain Tiburcio Red\u00edn, who in 1637 entered Capuchin and died in 1651 in La Guaira. ===Capuchin missionaries=== They were part of the white population penetration, for which they learned the aboriginal languages. In 1672 Francisco de Puente la Reina and 10 other friars, passed to Cuman\u00e1 where they resided during 40 years. This Navarrese founded the Conversion of the Christian Doctrine for the Chaima Indians. Francisco Javier de Alfaro (Manuel Fr\u00edas) moved from the convent of Los Arcos to Maracaibo; wrote a catechism for each group of native coianos, chaques and anatomists. Nicol\u00e1s de Renteria missioned in Los Llanos in 1663. Antonio de Idiazabal arrived in Venezuela in 1672 and died, ill, in Cuman\u00e1. ===Real Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guipuzcoana de Caracas=== Logo of the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas It was the most important mercantile company of its time (1728-1785); Its objective to displace the Dutch from the Venezuelan cocoa trade (also tobacco and hides). The royal permit authorized the Guipuzcoans to bring it in exchange for carrying their own merchandise from Pasaia and Cadiz and to pay a canon to the monopolistic port of Cadiz. The main factor in Caracas was Pedro de Olavarriaga. Factories were opened in La Guaira, Caracas, Puerto Cabello, San Felipe, Maracaibo, Cuman\u00e1 and Guayana. Not only did he carry goods from Gipuzkoa, but also supplies and troops and enabled his own ships to defend Venezuela from the English attacks, a war in which Blas de Lezo was distinguished. It was due to the colonization of Cumana and several fishing trials. The free trade declaration of 1778 and the English harassment determined its closure. The Basques established in Venezuela continued colonization mainly in the valleys of Aragua, in the plains of Cojedes, Portuguesa, Orinoco and coasts of Caracas. They introduced, among other things, the indigo of dye, the cotton and the sugar cane. The link with Pasaia-San Sebasti\u00e1n remained until the end of the century. ===Second wave of Basque immigration=== In 1939 as a result of the Spanish Civil War, begins the arrival at Venezuelan ports of what is considered the largest migration of Basques to Venezuela since the colony. With the support of the Basque Government in exile, the Venezuelan Government of General Eleazar L\u00f3pez Contreras and with the approval of a large number of Venezuelan intellectuals such as Arturo Uslar Pietri and Antonio Arra\u00edz, on June 24 of the same year, 82 Basques addressed the Transatlantic \"Cuba\" in the French port of Le Havre departing for Venezuela under the notes of the Txistu de Segundo de Atxurra who interprets the Agur Jaunak, many of them said goodbye to their land to not see it again. The arrival of this first contingent was an event in the Caracas of the time and the local press echoed the same dedicating some reviews, in the same it is mentioned that on Sunday July 6, 1939 after hearing Mass in the Church of Santa Rosal\u00eda in the city of Caracas, the group accompanied by Arturo Uslar Pietri and Sim\u00f3n Gonzalo Salas make a wreath to the remains of the Liberator Simon Bolivar in the National Pantheon, singing the Agur Jaunak, the National Anthem of Venezuela and the Eusko Abendaren Ereserkia, creating this last great controversy since some media criticized this, erroneously, for having been interpreted communist hymns in the national pantheon, a situation that was not taken into account by the Venezuelan Government. To this first contingent others occurred almost consecutively and with a larger number of people. ==Caracas Basque Center== On March 3, 1950, the Basque Center of Caracas was inaugurated with the presence of the Lehendakari Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre and the Basque delegate in New York, Jes\u00fas de Gal\u00edndez, where they keep alive the legacies and customs of the exiles and publish Caracas'ko Eusko Etxea. At present it is the most populous Basque Center (600 families, predominantly Vizcainos and Alaveses) and one of the most important in the world. Built in the neighborhood of El Para\u00edso. ==Euzko Gaztedi and the extraterritorial press== EG was created in 1948 in the heart of the Centro Vasco de Caracas (Basque Center of Caracas) with the purpose of grouping the youth and promoting cultural and social activities. Its presidents were: Mart\u00edn Ugalde, Sabin Zenarruzabeitia, Jon Urrezti, I\u00f1aki Elguezabal, Jon Aretxabaleta, Jesus Dolara, Joseba Leizaola, Rosario Amestoy, I\u00f1aki Aretxabaleta, Joseba Bilbao, Joseba Iturralde, Txomin Bizkarret, Bilgen Am\u00e9zaga, I\u00f1aki Anasagasti, Jes\u00fas Azpiritxaga, I\u00f1aki Goikoetxea, Xabier Azpiritxaga, Adolfo Urrutia and Ander Amenabar. From the work of this group invigorated by Jokin Intza emerges Euzko Gaztedi of the Basque Interior- Resistance (EGI), dependent of the PNV, that clandestinely introduced the magazine \"Gudari\" in Overseas between 1960-1974 and published important titles (Steer, Land\u00e1buru, Azpiazu, Aguirre, Leizaola, Abrisketa, etc.). Some of its members and the new refugees of the 60 establish a group related to ETA. The Basque-Venezuelan impulse to the Basque press in America, France and underground was very important with about 30 different modalities among which the magazine \"Noticentro\" of the Caracas Basque Center. ==Notable people== Monument to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, in Ziortza-Bolibar (Basque Country) * Fernando Amorebieta, professional footballer who plays for Independiente as a central defender. * Jos\u00e9 Antonio Anzo\u00e1tegui, Brigadier General in the Battle of Boyac\u00e1, helping to lead a republican army of Colombians and Venezuelans against Spanish royalist forces during the Venezuelan War of Independence. * Fernando Aristeguieta, professional footballer who plays for Caracas as a striker. * Goizeder Az\u00faa, TV Host, anchorwoman, model, journalist, and beauty queen who won Miss International 2003. * Doris Benegas, political lawyer specialising in criminal law, particularly causes related to women and left- wing politics. * Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Benegas, politician for the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). * Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, military and political leader who played a leading role in the establishment of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Panama as sovereign states, independent of Spanish rule. * Xabier Elorriaga, contemporary film and TV actor, writer and director. * Jos\u00e9 Esparza, virologist. * Unai Etxebarria, retired road racing cyclist.
