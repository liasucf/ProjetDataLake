    "text": "The Revillagigedo Islands (, ) or Revillagigedo Archipelago are a group of four volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean, known for their unique ecosystem. They lie approximately from Socorro Island south and southwest of Cabo San Lucas, the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, and west of Manzanillo. They are located around . Technically part of the Mexican state of Colima, the islands are under Mexican federal jurisdiction. In July 2016, the Revillagigedo Archipelago were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2017 they were declared to be a marine reserve and a national park of Mexico. ==Geography== Mont\u00edculo Ciner\u00edtico (front) and B\u00e1rcena (behind), volcanic cones on San Benedicto, one of the Revillagigedo Islands. B\u00e1rcena has existed only since 1952. The total area is 157.81 km2 (60.93 mi2), spread over an east-to-west extent of about 420 km (261 mi). A naval station in the south of Socorro Island has a population of 45 (staff). On Clari\u00f3n is a small naval garrison with nine men. The islands are otherwise uninhabited. The islands are named after Don Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the 53rd viceroy of New Spain. {| class=\"wikitable\" |-align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#999999\" |style=\"padding-left:3em\"|Island (alternate name) || Length by width (km) || Area (km2) || Highest peak (m) |- |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"|Inner islands (UTC-7, Mountain Time Zone) |- |style=\"padding-left:3em\" |San Benedicto ||align=\"right\"| 4.315 by 2.490 ||align=\"right\"| 5.94 || B\u00e1rcena (310) |- |style=\"padding-left:3em\" |Socorro (San Tom\u00e1s) ||align=\"right\"| 16.813 by 15.629 ||align=\"right\"| 132.06 || Mount (Cerro) Evermann (1130) |- |style=\"padding-left:3em\" |Roca Partida ||align=\"right\"| 0.246 by 0.073 ||align=\"right\"| 0.014 || (34) |- |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"|Outer island (UTC-8, Pacific Time Zone) |- |style=\"padding- left:3em\" |Clari\u00f3n (Santa Rosa) ||align=\"right\"| 8.544 by 3.686 ||align=\"right\"| 19.80 || Monte Gallegos (335) |-bgcolor=\"#999999\" |Revillagigedo Islands||align=\"right\"| 420 by 115 ||align=\"right\"| 157.81 || Mount (Cerro) Evermann (1130) |} The three eastern islands are called the inner islands. They fall in the time zone UTC-7 (Mountain Time), while the major part of Colima is UTC-6 (Central Time Zone). Clari\u00f3n is comparatively far to the west, by more than 200 km in comparison with the inner islands, and in UTC-8 (Pacific Time Zone). The Revillagigedo Islands are one of three Mexican island groups in the Pacific Ocean that are not on the continental shelf; the others are Guadalupe Island and Rocas Alijos. ==History== ===Sixteenth to nineteenth century=== Location of Socorro Island and the rest of the Revillagigedo Archipelago, and extent of Mexico's western EEZ in the Pacific No evidence of human habitation on Socorro exists before its discovery by Spanish explorers. Hernando de Grijalva and his crew discovered an uninhabited island on 19 December 1533, and named it Santo Tom\u00e1s (Socorro Island) and on 28 December they discovered Isla de los Inocentes (San Benedicto) which owed its name to having been found on the day of the Holy Innocents.American Geographical Society of New York (1967), Special publication, issue 38, p. 370, American Geographical Society, ISSN 0065-843X In November 1542, Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos, while exploring new routes across the Pacific, rediscovered Inocentes and Santo Tom\u00e1s and charted the latter as Anublada (\"Cloudy\"). Villalobos was the first to report sighting of Roca Partida Island giving it its present-day name. In 1608, Mart\u00edn Y\u00e1nez de Armida, in charge of another expedition, visited Anublada and changed its name to Socorro. In 1779 Jos\u00e9 Camacho was the first to report sighting of the island remaining, that he charted as Santa Rosa (\"Saint Rose\"). Santa Rosa was later renamed Clarion after the vessel commanded by Henry Gyzelaar at that time. The Revillagigedo Islands have been visited by a number of other explorers: Domingo del Castillo (1541), Miguel Pinto (1772), Alexander von Humboldt (1811), Benjamin Morrell (1825), Sir Edward Belcher (1839) who made the first botanical collections and Reeve, who witnessed the eruption of Mount Evermann in 1848.Geological Survey (U.S.) U.S. Geological Survey professional paper, issue 492\u2013493, p. 281, ISSN 1044-9620 On 25 July 1861, President Benito Ju\u00e1rez signed a decree awarding territorial control over the four islands to the state of Colima. His plan was to build an offshore penitentiary on Isla Socorro; although this never happened, the decree whereby they were attached to Colima has never been repealed. In 1865, the island was explored by ornithologist Andrew Jackson Grayson, who discovered the Socorro dove, Socorro mockingbird and the Socorro elf owl which were later given scientific names in his honor. ===Twentieth century=== Socorro and B\u00e1rcena on San Benedicto are indicated on this map of Mexican volcanoes At the beginning of the twentieth century, Dr. Barton Warren Evermann, director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, California, promoted the scientific exploration of the islands. The most comprehensive biological collections were obtained at this time. The volcano on Isla Socorro was renamed in his honor. In 1957 the Mexican Navy established a naval base on Socorro and has had a permanent presence on the island since then. A tiny outpost also exists on Clari\u00f3n, as noted above. On 21 March 1972, Pablo Silva Garc\u00eda became the first Governor of Colima to visit his state's island territories. A plaque was unveiled to mark the event and cement Colima's claim. The seas surrounding the larger islands are popular with scuba divers; a variety of marine life such as cetaceans, sharks and manta rays can be observed. Visitors usually stay aboard expedition vessels during their visit to the islands, which is desirable from an ecological standpoint to prevent introduction of further invasive species. The islands are occasionally visited by amateur radio operators, who usually use the ITU prefix XF4. Because of their distance from the mainland, for award credit they are considered to be an \"entity\" separate from Mexico. Expeditions from organizations engaged in biological conservation of the islands visit the islands for fieldwork on a regular basis. No tourism facilities exist; the islands have no reliable sources of fresh water of their own. ===Twenty-first century=== On 24 November 2017, President of Mexico Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto created North America's largest marine protected area around the Revillagigedo Islands. This protected area covers 57,000 square miles or 150,000 square kilometers around the islands, and bans fishing, mining, and tourism development in the protected area and on the islands. ==Ecology== The Revillagigedo Islands are home to many endemic plant and animal species, and are sometimes called Mexico's \"little Hawaii\". They are recognized as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, part of the Neotropical realm. Socorro is the most diverse in flora, fauna, and topography. The Mexican Government established the islands as a Biosphere Reserve on June 4, 1994. Socorro as seen from space. North is to the upper left corner. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 14 of the islands' 16 generally accepted resident taxa of landbirdsIncluding one waterbird, the local yellow-crowned night heron subspecies. as well as one seabird are endemic, as are all of the islands' native terrestrial vertebrates. The latter, however, consist only of a whip snake (Masticophis anthonyi), a night snake (Hypsiglena unaocularis) and two Urosaurus iguanids (U. auriculatus and U. clarionensis). Numerous seabird taxa breed no further north(east)wards than San Benedicto; storm-petrels are notably absent as breeders though they breed in the region and visit the islands to forage. Albatrosses are also not normally found here. Among landbirds, the absence of the house finch, widespread on northeastern Pacific offshore islands, is the most conspicuous one. Apart from the native birds, migrant shorebirds and others are often found on the islands. Bahia Azufre (Sulfur Bay) on Clari\u00f3n seems to be a favorite stopover location, as it is one of the few longer stretches of beach in the islands; mostly, the shoreline is steep cliffs. The archipelago is also a part of wintering grounds for humpback whales in north pacific.Urban J., Jaramillo A.L., Aguayo A., Baker S.C., 2000, Migratory destinations of humpback whales wintering in the Mexican Pacific, Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 2(2), pp.101\u2013110, Retrieved on January 29, 2017 Socorro has numerous endemic plant taxa, whereas Clari\u00f3n which is farthest from land has but a few. The San Benedicto ecosystem was nearly wiped out in the devastating eruption of B\u00e1rcena volcano on August 1, 1952, but has since recovered; apparently just the San Benedicto rock wren became entirely extinct. Most if not all native plants found on San Benedicto today are shared with Clari\u00f3n, not with the closer Socorro to the south, due to the prevailing winds and ocean currents. The native flora of Clari\u00f3n is about equally shared with both other large islands. As opposed to the interchange between the islands, the animals and plants that colonized them initially are apparently all from mainland populations generally to the northeastward of the Revillagigedos. Plants are most often derived from Baja California founder populations, whereas the endemic nonavian reptiles seem to be rather derived directly from mainland populations of the Sonora-Sinaloa area. The ancestors of the islands' terrestrial birds probably came from the general area of southern North and northern Central America. As illustrated by the fact that no endemic landbird taxon occurs on more than one island and the cases of the Socorro and Clari\u00f3n wrens as well as the Socorro dove and Clari\u00f3n mourning dove, each bird population seems to have arisen independently. ===Threats and conservation=== The Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni), as of 2019, survives only in captivity As late as 1956 it was said that > \"The future of the avifauna of the islands appears to be secure at present. > There are no human inhabitants, and no mammals of any kind except the > moderate and apparently stable population of sheep on Socorro.\" The unique ecology of the islands has since then come under threat from these and other exotic species. Sheep were introduced to Socorro in 1869, and cats have become established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s. Pigs were introduced to Clari\u00f3n in 1979, and rabbits became feral at some earlier date. Several endemic species of Socorro are now threatened with extinction. The Socorro mockingbird (Mimodes graysoni) numbers less than 400 individuals altogether. The endemic Socorro parakeet (Aratinga brevipes) and Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis), are also endangered. The Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni) is now extinct in the wild, but is being bred in captivity. The elf owl's Socorro subspecies Micrathene whitneyi graysoni appears to be extinct.Weick, Friedhelm (2006), Owls (Strigiformes): annotated and illustrated checklist, Springer, p. 187, Other plant and animal taxa in the archipelago are also considered threatened or nearly so. A number of conservation initiatives are dedicated to halting the destruction of the native ecosystems of the islands. Dr. Harmunt Walter of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Dr. Luis F. Baptista of the California Academy of Sciences have coordinated breeding and reintroduction efforts for the Socorro dove since 1988, through the Island Endemics Institute. The Comit\u00e9 Cient\u00edfico para la Conservaci\u00f3n y Restauraci\u00f3n del Archipi\u00e9lago Revillagigedo (\"Scientific Committee for the Conservation and Restoration of the Revillagigedo Islands\") was founded in 1996, and is a committee representing several organizations, including the Island Conservation & Ecology Group, Island Endemics Institute, the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis (UMSL), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and others. It is chaired by Dr. Walter and Dr. Luis Medrano of UNAM is its secretary. The committee has been advocating removal of the exotic species from the islands, especially the estimated 2000 sheep on Socorro, to allow the islands' ecology to recover, and adoption of a management plan to promote the recovery of the islands' native species, including reintroduction of the Socorro dove. Brattstrom and Howell who gave the optimistic outlook in 1956 went on to caution that > \"it may be hoped that the Mexican government will guard against the > introduction of mammals such as rabbits, cats, goats and others that have > invariably brought disaster to the flora and fauna of insular regions.\" On 25 November 2017, President of Mexico Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto acted to protect the biodiversity of the region by creating North America's largest marine protected area around the islands, and prohibiting mining, fishing, and tourism development on or near the islands. ==References== ==External links== * * * Contemporary report of Jos\u00e9 Camacho's sighting of Roca Partida and Clarion Category:Islands of Colima Category:Pacific islands of Mexico Category:Archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean Category:Volcanoes of Colima Category:Volcanoes of the Pacific Ocean Category:Volcanoes of Mexico Category:Natural history of Colima Category:Pacific Coast of Mexico Category:Neotropical dry broadleaf forests Category:Ecoregions of Mexico Category:Neotropic ecoregions Category:Ramsar sites in Mexico ",
