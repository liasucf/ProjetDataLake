    "text": "Henry Cary Jr. was an American building contractor, active during the early 1700s. ==Biography== Cary was born in Colonial Virginia around the mid to late 1600s to Henry Cary Sr. and Judith Lockey Cary. There are few surviving records of his early life but it is likely that he learned about contracting through his father, who also worked as a contractor. Cary married three times and had seven children, three with his first wife Sarah Sclater and four with his second wife, Ann Edwards. ==Construction== Cary became visibly active in construction after his father's retirement in 1710 and in December 1720 he was authorized to work on the Governor's Palace, in Williamsburg, Virginia, a project that his father had begun but was unable to complete. This was one of several jobs that Cary performed at Williamsburg and in 1726 he was hired to construct new gates for the Capitol. He went on to oversee the construction of several buildings at the College of William & Mary (also in Williamsburg): a chapel wing (1729) and the President's House (1732), and Cary was also likely in charge of constructing the Brafferton building (1723). Around 1733, Cary moved to the bank of the James River, where he built Ampthill, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which served as the Cary family home for many generations. ==See also== * List of people from Virginia ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Place of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Place of death unknown Category:17th-century births Category:18th- century deaths Category:17th-century American businesspeople Category:18th- century American businesspeople Category:American builders Category:People from Chesterfield County, Virginia Category:People from Williamsburg, Virginia Henry Jr. ",
