Leslie Savage (Revelstoke, BC: Crabtree Communications, 2007). ==Early life== Crabtree Family circa 1920. Crabtree was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the son of Charles Archie Crabtree and Elvina Kennedy Greenham. Raised in the family home on McKinnon Road in Rockliffe Park with siblings John, Betty, and Graham, Crabtree was born into a family of artists. His father, an art department head at William Notman\u2019s photographic studio in Montreal and later owner and operator of Crabtree Gravure Limited, an engraving business; his mother, an artist and cartoonist, was a student of painter John Singer Sargent, and graduated from the Royal Academy in 1903.Grant Crabtree, A Wide-Angled Lens: Stories From Life, ed.

In addition to playing for the Lisgar team, Crabtree was a member of the New Edinburgh Intermediate City Hockey League and the New Edinburgh Canoe Club. Following high school and during the Great Depression, Crabtree helped his father in his business, working with plates and developing prints, and learning how to produce quality images. Crabtree's interest in photography began in 1928, when he obtained his first postcard print-size Kodak Camera. He soon joined a local camera club, where his annual contest submission, a portrait of his brother Graham, won first prize. Inspired by Edward Steichen\u2019s Vanity Fair portraits, and encouraged by positive reaction to his work, Crabtree began his long career in photography and film. ==Career== Crabtree filming on set circa 1950s. Crabtree's foray into the film business came in 1939 when he met John Grierson, founder and head of the National Film Board of Canada, and received an offer from filmmaker Budge Crawley to shoot Bacon For Britain, a work highlighting the contributions of the country's agriculturalists to the war effort.http://everything2.com/title/Crawley+films Crabtree continued work for Crawley Films until 1950, and remained a freelancer with the NFB until the late 1970s.

In 1973, Crabtree purchased a farmhouse in East Margaree, Cape Breton, where he spent most of his time in the remainder of his life.

In retirement, he continued his artistic pursuits, taking keen interest in nature and landscape photography and woodworking, producing furniture and crafts. He also produced his own maple syrup and assortment of jams, marmalade, and jellies. Crabtree was widowed following his wife's death in 2000.
