It was her first suite based on the Xenogenesis novels of American science fiction writer Octavia Butler.Xenogenesis Suite at Firehouse 12 ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Fran\u00e7ois Couture states \"Moving, intricate, and immediate, this album marks a paradigm shift in her work as a composer, toward a much more personal voice.\" The Down Beat review by Greg Burk notes \"Though the intent is to prod rather than please, Mitchell\u2019s dyspeptic horn harmonies possess a coarse beauty.\"Burk, Greg. Xenogenesis Suite review. Down Beat October 08: page 83. Print. The All About Jazz review by Troy Collins says \"A surprisingly effective combination of disturbing surrealism delivered with raw emotion and lyrical experimentation, Xenogenesis Suite is an endlessly rewarding listen.\"Collins, Troy. Xenogenesis Suite review at All About Jazz The Penguin Jazz Guide observed \"Mitchell has made a considerable splash with her Black Earth Ensemble, whose music is not so much a throwback to 40 years ago as a strong reminder of how much has moved forward in cultural politics. Some of the creative ethos is still the same though, and there is no mistaking the power in Mitchell's writing. ... The ensemble is tightly disciplined but still free to explore the dimensions of Mitchell's big ideas on their own individual terms\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Nicole Mitchell # \"Wonder\" \u2013 4:56 # \"Transition A\" \u2013 5:54 # \"Smell of Fear\" \u2013 5:36 # \"Sequence Shadows\" \u2013 4:42 # \"Oankali\" \u2013 4:22 # \"Adrenalin\" \u2013 5:43 # \"Transition C\" \u2013 5:49 # \"Before and After\" \u2013 6:39 # \"Down of a New Life\" \u2013 7:01 ==Personnel== *Nicole Mitchell - flute *David Boykin \u2013 tenor sax *David Young \u2013 trumpet *Mankwe Ndosi \u2013 vocals *Tomeka Reid \u2013 cello *Justin Dillard \u2013 piano *Josh Abrams \u2013 bass *Marcus Evans \u2013 drums *Arveeayl Ra \u2013 percussion ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Nicole Mitchell (musician) albums ",
