She ordered the island's 200 residents to leave, and banned hunting and fishing on grounds of animal cruelty. The protracted legal battle that followed may have turned violent with the fire that consumed much of the island in 1934 (the cause of the fire was never determined, though Bonham-Christie blamed the Boy Scouts and forbade them to camp on the island afterwards). Fearing further threats, she hired a bodyguard to eject intruders to the island. While unpopular, her minimal interference with the island's natural contents meant that it became a flourishing habitat for red squirrels,\"Brownsea Island Squirrels Suffering from Leprosy\" Bournemouth Echo (9 May 2016). Sandwich tern, avocet, and other wildlife. \"The old lady knew she wasn't popular but I don't think she cared,\" said a former boatman who served the island during her tenure there.Adam Lee-Potter, \"The People Who Have Helped Make Brownsea Island the Nation's Favourite Nature Reserve\" Dorset (12 March 2014). ==Death and legacy== St. Mary's Church on Brownsea Island Mary Bonham-Christie died on 28 April 1961, aged 96 years, in a local nursing home off the island where her family had moved her.\"Recluse Dies at 96; Lived Alone in 80 Room Castle\" The Bee (1 May 1961): 11. via Newspapers.com Her grandson and heir John Bonham-Christie had plans to develop the island. A group of environmental conservationists, led by Helen Brotherton, organized to oppose his plans. They succeeded in raising sufficient funds to persuade the Treasury to take Brownsea Island as settlement of death duties, which was accepted provided that the National Trust took over the island.Victoria Ward, \"Father and Son Locked in Legal Battle over Trust Fund\" The Telegraph (1 August 2013). However, this was also subject to payment to the Treasury of \u00a3100,000 - which the National Trust did not have. An arrangement was finally reached whereby three other parties contributed \u00a325,000 each: The Dorset Wildlife Trust - provided they could run half the island; the John Lewis Partnership - for a 99-year lease of the castle & grounds (for staff holidays); and the Scout & Guide Movements - provided they could have access to the rest of the Island for their members.Brownsea Island There is a monument to Mary Bonham-Christie in the churchyard at Marston Bigot; her remains were cremated at Bournemouth, and although the local paper said her ashes were scattered at Brownsea Island, the memorial at Marston Bigot states that her ashes are at Bournemouth crematorium.
