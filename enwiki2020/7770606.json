Vikramshila Setu is 5th longest bridge over water in India. The 4.7 km long two lane bridge serves as a link between NH 33 and NH 31 running on the opposite sides of the Ganges. It runs from Barari Ghat on the Bhagalpur side on the south bank of the Ganges to Naugachia on the north bank. It also connects Bhagalpur to Purnia and Katihar. This has reduced considerably the road travel between Bhagalpur and places across the Ganges. However, there is intense traffic congestion on the bridge due to increased traffic and there is now a demand to construct another bridge parallel to it. On 21 September 2020 Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of another 4 lane road bridge of 4.445 km length over Ganga river parallel to Vikramshila Setu at cost of Rs. 1110.23 crore.https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/roadways/infra-boost- for-bihar-pm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-for-9-highway-projects-inaugurates- optical-fibre-services/2088198/ In June 2018, another 24 km-long Vikramshila - Kataria rail-cum-road bridge between Vikramshila railway station (near Pirpainty south of Ganga) and Kataria railway station (near Naugachia railway station) north of the Ganga, with an expenditure of Rs 4,379.01 crore was approved. ==See also== *Bridges in Bihar *List of longest bridges in the world *List of longest bridges above water in India ==References== Category:Transport in Bhagalpur Category:Bridges over the Ganges Category:Tourist attractions in Bihar Category:Bridges in Bihar Category:Road bridges in India Category:Toll bridges in India Category:Bridges completed in 2001 ",
