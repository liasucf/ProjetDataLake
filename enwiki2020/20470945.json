It was unable to improve on the previous season's output of 8\u20138, winning only one game.1980 New Orleans Saints The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourteenth consecutive season and had the dubious distinction not only of winning only a single game, but winning it by a single point against the equally disappointing Jets, who like the Saints had widely been predicted before the season to advance to their first playoff appearance since 1969.Finney Jr., Peter; \u201cSaints Near Record\u201d; in The Bryan Times; December 12, 1980; p. 13 ==Season in review== Disgruntled fans called their team \u201cthe Aints\u201d, going so far as to show up to games wearing brown paper bags over their heads after their team was 0\u201312Litzky, Frank; \u201cDick Nolan, 75, N.F.L.

In embarrassment they called themselves the Unknown Fan (a spinoff from The Unknown Comic) in a practice that would become the trademark of disgruntled fans across various sports in the United States. Coach Dick Nolan was fired after this game, replaced by Dick Stanfel, and then a most notable loss occurred in Week 14. Playing the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park, the Saints charged out to a 35\u20137 lead at halftime, led by three touchdown passes from Archie Manning and a pair of one-yard touchdown runs from Jack Holmes. However, the 49ers would rally behind quarterback Joe Montana, who would rush for a touchdown and pass for two more. The 49ers would tie the game 35\u201335 on a fourth-quarter touchdown run by Lenvil Elliott and go on to win in overtime, 38\u201335, on a Ray Wersching field goal. The 28-point comeback by the 49ers was, at the time, the greatest comeback in NFL history, and currently remains the greatest comeback in NFL regular season history (the 1992 AFC Wildcard game between the Buffalo Bills and Houston Oilers is currently #1, with the Bills overcoming a 32-point deficit to win).

The 1980 Saints were the first team to end the season at 1\u201315. The 1989 Dallas Cowboys, 1990 New England Patriots, 1991 Indianapolis Colts, 1996 New York Jets, 2000 San Diego Chargers, 2001 Carolina Panthers, 2007 Miami Dolphins, 2009 St. Louis Rams and 2016 Cleveland Browns later matched the 1980 Saints by finishing 1\u201315, but the 2008 Detroit Lions and 2017 Cleveland Browns both exceeded it by finishing with an 0\u201316 record. The 1991 Colts (vs. Jets) and 2000 Chargers (vs. Chiefs) also won their lone games by a single point. ==Offseason== ===NFL draft=== ==Personnel== ===Staff=== ===Roster=== ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
