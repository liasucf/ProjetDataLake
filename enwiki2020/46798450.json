    "text": "The 2010\u201311 National League 2 South was the second season (24th overall) of the fourth tier of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. The league system was 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw and additional bonus points being awarded for scoring 4 or more tries and/or losing within 7 points of the victorious team. In terms of promotion the league champions would go straight up into National League 1 while the runners up would have a one-game playoff against the runners up from National League 2 North (at the home ground of the club with the superior league record) for the final promotion place. Ealing Trailfinders finished the season as champions pipping newly promoted Jersey to the title by just four points in a season where both sides dominated the league. Jersey did join Ealing in the 2011\u201312 National League 1 by beating the 2010\u201311 National League 2 North runners up Loughborough Students in a playoff game watched by 3,000 fans in Saint Peter, Jersey. At the opposite end of the table, Newbury Blues had a terrible season, suffering a third consecutive relegation dropping to National League 3 South West, having won just one game and conceded over 2,000 points (a divisional all-time worst which also included a record 132\u20130 defeat by Old Albanian). Joining Newbury in relegation would be Hinckley who dropped to National League 3 Midlands, while the third and final place went to the wire with relegation rivals Canterbury and Westcombe Park meeting in a rescheduled game on the 7 May 2011 \u2013 a week after the season had finished. Westcombe Park won 25\u201318 at Canterbury to condemn the Kent side to National League 3 London & SE. The season was also notable for the incredible try scoring feats of Ealing Trailfinders winger Phil Chesters who scored an amazing 70 tries in 27 games \u2013 an English league record, as well as the dedicated support for Jersey who had regular attendances of over a thousand \u2013 outstanding for tier 4. Chesters also became the first top try scorer in the league to also become the top points scorer as well. ==Participating teams== Eleven of the teams listed below participated in the 2009\u201310 National League 2 South season; Newbury Blues were relegated from National League 1, Jersey (champions) and Old Albanian (playoffs) were promoted from National League 3 London & SE while Taunton were promoted from National League 3 South West. In order to address an imbalance between divisions \u2013 Hinckley were transferred from National League 2 North having achieved a late promotion from National League 3 Midlands as a consequence of Ampthill being stripped of that divisions title due to a breach of RFU rules. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !width=25%|Team !width=25%|Stadium !width=25%|Capacity !width=25%|City/Area |- |Canterbury |Merton Lane |1,075 (75 seats) |Canterbury, Kent |- |Clifton |Station Road |2,500 (400 seats) |Cribbs Causeway, Patchway, Bristol |- |Dings Crusaders |Landseer Avenue |1,500 |Lockleaze, Bristol |- |Ealing Trailfinders |Trailfinders Sports Ground |3,020 |Ealing, London |- |Henley Hawks |Dry Leas |4,000 |Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire |- |Hinckley |Leicester Road |2,000 |Hinckley, Leicestershire |- |Jersey |St. Peter |5,000 |Saint Peter, Jersey |- |Lydney |Regentsholme |1,500 |Lydney, Gloucestershire |- |Newbury Blues |Monk's Lane |8,000 |Newbury, Berkshire |- |Old Albanian |Woollam Playing Fields |1,000 |St Albans, Hertfordshire |- |Richmond |Richmond Athletic Ground |4,500 |Richmond, London |- |Shelford |The Davey Field |2,000 (150 seats) |Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire |- |Southend |Warners Bridge Park | |Southend, Essex |- |Taunton |Hyde Park |2,000 (198 seats) |Taunton, Somerset |- |Westcombe Park |Goddington Dene |3,200 |Orpington, London |- |Worthing Raiders |Roundstone Lane |1,500 (100 seats) |Angmering, West Sussex |- |} ==League table== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|2010\u201311 National League 2 South table |- |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"| |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"195\"|Club |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Played |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Won |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Drawn |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Lost |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points For |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Against |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Difference |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Bonus Points |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points |-style=\"background-color:#d8ffeb;text- align:center;\" | 1 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ealing Trailfinders (C) || 30 || 27 || 1 || 2 || 1490 || 424 || 1066 || 22 || 132 |- style=\"background- color:#ccccff;\" | 2 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jersey (P) || 30 || 27 || 0 || 3 || 1071 || 482 || 589 || 20 || 128 |- | 3 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Richmond || 30 || 24 || 0 || 6 || 1125 || 526 || 599 || 21 || 117 |- | 4 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Southend || 30 || 20 || 1 || 9 || 959 || 658 || 301 || 21 || 103 |- | 5 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Old Albanian || 30 || 18 || 1 || 11 || 1080 || 668 || 412 || 27 || 101 |- | 6 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Henley Hawks || 30 || 18 || 1 || 11 || 888 || 668 || 220 || 13 || 93 |- | 7 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Taunton || 30 || 18 || 0 || 12 || 881 || 847 || 34 || 16 || 88 |- | 8 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Worthing Raiders || 30 || 17 || 0 || 13 || 897 || 685 || 212 || 19 || 87 |- | 9 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Clifton || 30 || 14 || 0 || 16 || 712 || 757 || -45 || 12 || 68 |- | 10 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dings Crusaders || 30 || 12 || 1 || 17 || 718 || 765 || -47 || 12 || 62 |- | 11 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Lydney || 30 || 12 || 0 || 18 || 669 || 955 || -286 || 13 || 61 |- | 12 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Shelford || 30 || 9 || 0 || 21 || 754 || 852 || -98 || 20 || 56 |- | 13 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Westcombe Park || 30 || 9 || 0 || 21 || 612 || 889 || -277 || 15 || 51 |- style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;\" | 14 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Canterbury (R) || 30 || 7 || 1 || 22 || 724 || 940 || -216 || 20 || 50 |- style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;\" | 15 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Hinckley (R) || 30 || 4 || 0 || 26 || 494 || 1282 || -778 || 8 || 24 |- style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;\" | 16 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Newbury Blues (R) || 30 || 1 || 0 || 29 || 379 || 2055 || -1676 || 4 || 8 |- |colspan=\"15\"| *If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: # Number of matches won # Difference between points for and against # Total number of points for # Aggregate number of points scored in matches between tied teams # Number of matches won excluding the first match, then the second and so on until the tie is settled |- |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px\"| Green background is the promotion place.
