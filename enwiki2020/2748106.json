    "text": "Jack Taylor (born George Brown Randall, October 21, 1936), is a Spanish-based American actor best known for starring in many European low-budget exploitation films of the 1970s, in particular several directed by Spanish cult filmmaker Jes\u00fas Franco. == Career == Born in Oregon in 1936, George Brown Randall adopted the stage name Jack Taylor and began his acting career in small roles in 1950s American TV shows such as The Jack Benny Program and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. He relocated to Mexico in the late 1950s and starred in a number of films for director Federico Curiel, often vehicles for the Mexican characters Nostradamus the Vampire and the superhero Neutron. Reportedly, he moved to Europe to appear in Elizabeth Taylor's epic Cleopatra (1963), but his small part ended up uncredited. In 1967, Taylor began his prolific collaboration with Jesus Franco in Succubus (1968, his first onscreen lead role) and Eugenie\u2026 The Story of Her Journey into Perversion (1970). He went on to play Quincey Morris in the 1970 Franco opus Count Dracula alongside Christopher Lee, Herbert Lom, Soledad Miranda and Klaus Kinski, before appearing in many of Franco's softcore films, most famously Female Vampire (1973) with Lina Romay. During this period, Taylor also co-starred with Spanish horror star Paul Naschy in Dr. Jekyll vs. The Werewolf (1971) and The Mummy's Revenge (1975) and worked for director Amando de Ossorio on three occasions, on The Ghost Galleon (1974), Night of the Sorcerers (1974) and The Sea Serpent (1985). He appeared in Le\u00f3n Klimovsky's The Vampires Night Orgy (1972) and the Italian giallo film Red Rings of Fear (1978). Juan Piquer Sim\u00f3n directed him in two films, a Jules Verne adventure film called Where Time Began (1978) and the gory cult film Pieces (1982). Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Larraz directed him in two other Spanish slasher films, Rest in Pieces (1987) and Edge of the Axe (1988). Over the years, Taylor has played supporting roles in international co-productions such as Robert Siodmak's Custer of the West (1966), John Milius' Conan the Barbarian (1982), Richard Lester's The Return of the Musketeers (1989), Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate (1999), Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's Far (2001) and Milo\u0161 Forman's Goya's Ghosts (2006) while continuing to work in low-budget film and television in Spain. ==Select filmography== * Neutron, the Man in the Black Mask (1960, dir.
