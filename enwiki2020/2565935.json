    "text": "Breach of Trust is a Canadian hard rock band originally from La Ronge, Saskatchewan. The band currently consists of vocalist/guitarist Marty Ballentyne, guitarist Terry Aubut, bass guitarist Colin Cheechoo (originally guitarist for the band) and drummer William Aubut. The band's members are all of First Nations heritage. == History == The band was formed in 1994 by the original lineup of Ballentyne, Aubut, bassist Zane Kryzanowsky, and guitarist Darryl Lavallee. In 1995 they independently released a 5-song CD called Dead Issue EP. Lavallee, who briefly left the band in 1995, was not featured on the CD. In 1997, Lavallee again left the group. He was replaced by Colin 'Cheech' Cheechoo. They released their debut full-length album, Songs for Dying Nations, in 2000. Shows across Canada that summer, a music video for the song \"Who Am I?\", and rave reviews from online sites such as theprp.com helped to create a buzz around the band, and major labels began attending shows. In 2001 Breach of Trust signed with EMI and \"Songs For Dying Nations\" was re released that year in June. The band won three awards at the 2001 Aboriginal Music Awards, including Best Group and Best Rock Album. While radio never embraced the group, MuchMusic, particularly the shows Going Coastal, The New Music and Loud, were big supporters of the band, and Breach of Trust performed live in the Much studios on two occasions. In 2001, the band toured with Amen, Flybanger, Finger Eleven, Slurpymundae (later Idle Sons), and Headstrong. They played the 3rd stage at Edgefest in Barrie, Ontario on July 1, 2001 alongside Billy Talent and The Dears. In 2002, bassist Kryzanowsky left the band. Cheechoo followed suit six months later. The band recruited bassist Brent Stutsky and guitarist Dean Zabolotney in 2003, and recorded a new album in the summer. The album was held back from release until 2004 at the request of the band, who were unhappy with some of the mixes. Finally, in November 2004, the album Breach of Trust was released. The band did shows with The Tea Party around the time of the album's release and the single, \"Bad Trip,\" received some airplay on MuchMusic. Aside from sporadic live appearances, the band has been inactive since shortly after the release of the self-titled album. Bassist Stutsky and guitarist Zabolotney left the band during this period. ==Reformation== The band regrouped in early 2007 with Cheechoo on bass and singer/guitarist Donovan Bruyere. This lineup performed at the 2007 National Aboriginal Achievement Awards in Edmonton, Alberta, and at shows until the end of 2009. Fan shot live videos from the awards performance and a 2009 show in Saskatoon can be found on YouTube. In 2011, Donovan left the band. In 2012, Breach of Trust welcomed guitarist Terry Aubut as the newest member of the band. ==Discography== * Dead Issue EP (1995) * Songs for Dying Nations (2000) * Songs for Dying Nations - EMI re release (2001) * Eyes of A Stranger (Payolas cover), FUBAR Soundtrack - (2003) * Breach of Trust (2004) ==See also== Category:Canadian alternative rock groups Category:Musical groups from Saskatchewan Category:First Nations musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Saskatchewan ",
