Head office in Fauske The company is owned by the City of Bod\u00f8 (47.72%), Troms Kraft (20.35%), Municipality of Fauske (12.83%), Nordkraft (8.86%), Sj\u00f8fossen Energi (6.92%) and Skjerstad Kraftlag (3.32%).

In 2010, DONG Energy sold its stake to Troms Kraft. ==Operations== Salten Kraftsamband operates the Daja, Fagerli, Lomi, and Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 power stations on the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 River in Sulitjelma and the Fors\u00e5, Langvann, Sundsfjord, and Oldereid power stations in Salten. It also owns 58% of R\u00f8d\u00f8y-Lur\u00f8y Kraftverk and 60% of Nord-Norsk Vindkraft and part of Fauske Lysverk. ==History== SKS was founded in 1956 by the municipalities of Bod\u00f8, Bodin and Fauske to create a power grid from the power stations in Sulitjelma to Outer Salten where the largest population was located. The municipalities had cooperated in building the power plants, but needed a separate company to transport the electricity. In the end of the 50s SKS built the Deja station. The current structure of the company arose in 1975 with a merger of Salten Kraftlag. In the 1980s there was major work on creating a vertical integrated power company for all of Salten, and in the long term a county municipality owned company for all of Nordland. But local fluctuation and concern for every petty local job made a consolidation impossible. In 1991 the new energy law was passed, killing the process. In 2000 SKS tried to merge with Bod\u00f8 Energi and Fauske Lysverk, but the fusion failed.
