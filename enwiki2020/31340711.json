His publications on antitrust law and international economic law were seminal and influenced German, Greek, European, Japanese and Taiwanese (RoChina) legislation and theory of competition law (PRChina). Fikentscher consulted German, European and UN authorities and the U.S. Senate on antitrust and unfair trade practices law. He authored a textbook on obligations (contracts, quasi contracts, torts). In his later years, Fikentscher contributed to the cultural anthropology of law, or comparative legal cultures, a field less known in Germany.
