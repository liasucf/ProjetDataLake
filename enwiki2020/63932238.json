    "text": "Philippines's 1st senatorial district, officially the First Senatorial District of the Philippine Islands (), was one of the twelve senatorial districts of the Philippines in existence between 1916 and 1935. It elected two members to the Senate of the Philippines, the upper chamber of the bicameral Philippine Legislature under the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands for each of the 4th to 10th legislatures. The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the northern Luzon provinces of Batanes, Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and Isabela. Abra was added in 1917 upon its re-establishment as a regular province separate from Ilocos Sur. The district was represented by a total of six senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large. It was last represented by Elpidio Quirino and Melecio Arranz of the Nacionalista Democr\u00e1tico. ==List of senators== {| class=wikitable |- ! colspan=7 | Seat A | rowspan=99 | ! rowspan=3 | Legislature | rowspan=99 | ! colspan=7 | Seat B |- style=\"height:3em\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history |- !Start!!End !Start!!End |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Vicente Singson Encarnaci\u00f3n | rowspan=\"2\" | October 16, 1916 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"2\" | Progresista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1916. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4th | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 1 | style=\"background:;\" | | Juan Villamor | October 16, 1916 | June 3, 1919 | Nacionalista | Elected in 1916. |- | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 5th | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Santiago Fonacier | rowspan=\"2\" | June 3, 1919 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 2, 1925 | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1919. |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | style=\"background- color:#191970 | | rowspan=\"2\" | Isabelo de los Reyes | rowspan=\"2\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 5, 1928 | Nacionalista Colectivista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1922. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6th | style=\"background-color:#191970 | | Nacionalista Colectivista |- | style=\"background:;\" | | Nacionalista Consolidado | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7th | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | 3 | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"4\" | Elpidio Quirino | rowspan=\"4\" | June 2, 1925 | rowspan=\"4\" | September 16, 1935 | rowspan=\"3\" | Nacionalista Consolidado | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1925. |- | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | 3 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Melecio Arranz | rowspan=\"3\" | June 5, 1928 | rowspan=\"3\" | September 16, 1935 | rowspan=\"2\" | Nacionalista Consolidado | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1928. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 8th |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9th | rowspan=\"2\" | Re-elected in 1931. |- | style=\"background:;\" | | Nacionalista Democr\u00e1tico | Re-elected in 1934. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 10th | style=\"background:;\" | | Nacionalista Democr\u00e1tico |} ==See also== *Legislative districts of the Philippines ==References== Category:Senatorial districts of the Philippines Category:1916 establishments in the Philippines Category:1935 disestablishments in the Philippines Category:Politics of Abra (province) Category:Politics of Batanes Category:Politics of Cagayan Category:Politics of Ilocos Norte Category:Politics of Ilocos Sur Category:Politics of Isabela (province) ",
