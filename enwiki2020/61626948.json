    "text": "\"Babushka Boi\" is a song by American rapper ASAP Rocky, released as a single through ASAP Rocky Recordings and RCA Records on August 28, 2019. The music video was released the same day. ==Background== ASAP Rocky began wearing a babushka to cover the resulting cut on his face after he fell off his scooter in September 2018. This inspired Frank Ocean, who posted a picture on his Instagram of himself in a babushka, with ASAP Rocky commenting \"Babushka Boi\" on the image and later adding the phrase to his own Instagram. ==Music video== The Nadia Lee Cohen-directed music video was also released on August 28. It was inspired by Dick Tracy and features ASAP Rocky, ASAP Ferg and Schoolboy Q among several prosthetic-enhanced gangsters on the run from police, who are portrayed as anthropomorphic pigs. It has been noted that it was filmed before ASAP Rocky's arrest and detainment in Sweden. The video was produced by Virgin Soil Pictures. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 60 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 12 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 21 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 5 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 32 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal Streaming (AFP) | 2997 |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:ASAP Rocky songs Category:Songs written by ASAP Rocky Category:Songs written by Boys Noize ",
