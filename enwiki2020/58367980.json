The Civic Museum of Palazzo Mosca (Musei Civici di Palazzo Mosca) is the main civic museum of Pesaro, displaying art and decorative works, located in Piazza Mosca in this town of the region of the Marche, Italy. ==History== Since 1936, the main collection has been displayed in the Palazzo Mosca, once belonging to a wealthy merchant family. In the 16th century they built this palace and the rural Villa Caprile outside of town. The palace was refurbished in the 18th century under the patronage of the marquis Francesco. He commissioned the work from Luigi Baldelli, a pupil of Giovanni Andrea Lazzarini. The Mosca family retained the palace well into the 19th century, until it became property of the commune. The art collections held in the Palazzo Ducale were moved here. The simple facade has a stone portal with the coat of arms of the Mosca family. ==Collection== Pesaro altarpiece depicting Coronation of the Virgin by Bellini. Fall of the Giants by Reni The displays occupy five halls in the first floor, and include works from diverse centuries. Among the Renaissance works is the large altarpiece, called the Pesaro Altarpiece or Pala di Pesaro, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin (1475) by Giovanni Bellini. It was originally located in the church of San Francesco, Pesaro. The second hall contains ceramic works including maiolica from the region. Part of the collection was donated by the marchesa Vittoria Toschi Mosca. Among the works of the Baroque era are a Magdalen and St Joseph Penitent by Simone Cantarini and a Fall of the Giants by Guido Reni.
