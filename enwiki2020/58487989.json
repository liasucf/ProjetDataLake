Bost studied from 1979 to 1983 (qualifying in 1981 for the agr\u00e9gation des math\u00e9matiques) at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS), where he was from 1984 to 1988 agr\u00e9g\u00e9-pr\u00e9parateur (teacher) and worked under the direction of Alain Connes. From 1988 he was charg\u00e9 de recherches and from 1993 directeur de recherches at CNRS. From 1993 to 2006 he was ma\u00eetre de conferences at the \u00c9cole polytechnique. He has been a professor at l'Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay (Paris XI) in Orsay since 1998. Bost deals with noncommutative geometry (partly in collaboration with Alain Connes) with applications to quantum field theory, algebraic geometry, and arithmetic geometry. The eponymous Bost conjecture is a generalization of the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture. In 1990 he received the Prix Peccot-Vimont of the Coll\u00e8ge de France. In 2002 he received the Prix \u00c9lie Cartan of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences. In 1986 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress on Mathematical Physics in Marseille. In 2006 he was an invited speaker with talk Evaluation maps, slopes, and algebraicity criteria at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid. From 2005 to 2015 Bost was a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France. He was elected in 2012 a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society and in 2016 a member of Academia Europaea. ==See also== *Bost\u2013Connes system ==Selected publications== * as editor with Fran\u00e7ois Loeser and Michel Raynaud: Courbes semi-stables and groupe fondamental en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique (Luminy, December 1998), Birkh\u00e4user 2000 * Introduction to compact Riemann Surfaces, Jacobean and Abelian Varieties.
