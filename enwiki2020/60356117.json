    "text": "Deep Inside Clint Star is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Clint Alberta and released in 1999.\"A time to look forward: A new wave of aboriginal filmmakers is determined to leave portrayals of natives as victims where they feel they belong -- in the past\". National Post, June 18, 1999. A first-person video essay, the film features Alberta, in the persona of a character named Clint Star, interviewing his own group of friends about their personal conceptions of racial and sexual identity.\"Deep Inside Clint Star\". Variety, May 8, 2000. The film had its theatrical premiere on June 18, 1999, as part of the Reel Aboriginal Film Series at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre.\"Aboriginal Voices\". Toronto Star, June 10, 1999. Later that same year, with the national launch of the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, it was one of the first films ever broadcast by that network.\"Aboriginal Peoples Television Network Launches September 1\". Canada NewsWire, August 27, 1999. Vancouver Sun film critic Katherine Monk favourably reviewed the film, writing that \"Keeping the camera pretty much fastened on his own navel, regardless of who he's shooting at any given moment, Star (a.k.a Alberta) also achieves an interesting filmic stance as documentarist-participant-Dear Abby. It's exciting to watch anyone create his own artistic form, but here, the thrill is amplified tenfold as Star grapples with everything from technique to tell-all confessions before your very eyes.\"\"Adrenaline pumpers to heart massagers\". Vancouver Sun, October 4, 1999. The film won the Donald Brittain Award for best television documentary on a social or political topic at the 15th Gemini Awards in 2000.\"Prime time night for Canada\". The Province, October 31, 2000. While producer Silva Basmajian was accepting the award, Alberta began to perform a traditional First Nations dance behind him, but was ushered off stage by security because they did not realize he was the filmmaker.\"Filmmaker was 'very tortured'\".
