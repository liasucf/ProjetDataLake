Subsequently, he supported opposition candidate Abdoulaye Wade in the 2000 presidential election,\"Election pr\u00e9sidentielle du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2000 - Le pays semble \u00eatre \u00e0 un tournant de son histoire\" , Afrique Express . and after Wade's victory he was named Minister of Urban Planning and Housing in the new government formed in April 2000.\"Le gouvernement du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal form\u00e9 le 3 avril 2000\" , Afrique Express . However, he became critical of Wade and was dismissed from the government in November 2000,Ambroise Ebonda, \"Wade brise l'aile gauche du Sopi\" , Le Messager, number 1,837, March 14, 2005 .\"Senegal's president sacks key leftist members\", Agence France-Presse, March 10, 2005. becoming the first of Wade's leftist allies from the 2000 election to be jettisoned. As a candidate on his party's national list, Dansokho was the only PIT candidate to be elected to the National Assembly in the April 2001 parliamentary election.. He also served as the Eighth Vice-President of the National Assembly during the parliamentary term that followed the election.. Speaking in 2002, Dansokho said that Wade was too arrogant and that his relations with other African leaders were lacking due to that characteristic; he also said that \"if [Wade] had become president of Senegal in the 1960s, he would have proclaimed himself emperor.\"Norimitsu Onishi, \"Senegalese Loner Works to Build Africa, His Way\", The New York Times, April 10, 2002. The PIT joined the Coalition Alternative 2007 for the 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections. In December 2006, Moustapha Niasse was designated as the coalition's candidate in the February 2007 presidential election and Dansokho was designated to head the coalition's list in the parliamentary election,\"Senegalese opposition leader heads new coalition\" , African Press Agency, December 22, 2006. which was later scheduled to be held in June 2007. After the presidential election, in which Wade was re-elected, Wade mentioned Dansokho as one of several opposition politicians who would be facing prosecution for corruption. Dansokho was accused of selling lands around the international airport while he was Minister of Urban Planning and of embezzling 17 million CFA francs as mayor of K\u00e9dougou. He dismissed these charges, calling Wade a coward.Pape Noel Fall, \"Wade Threatens to sue Niasse, Idy, Tanor, Dansokho Following his victory in Senegal Elections\", The Point, March 5, 2007.\"Senegal: Dansokho And Niasse React to Wade\", Foroyaa, March 5, 2007. Dansokho, acting as spokesman for 12 opposition parties, announced a boycott of the parliamentary election on April 2, 2007,Diadie Ba, \"Senegal's opposition to boycott elections\", Reuters, April 2, 2007. and as a result of this the PIT did not participate in the election. Dansokho was not included on the municipal candidate list of the Benno Siggil Senegaal opposition coalition for K\u00e9dougou in the March 2009 local elections. According to Dansokho, he had already told the PIT Secretariat that he did not want to be mayor again due to poor health, but he still felt able to serve as a municipal councillor; nevertheless, he was not included on the opposition's municipal list. Dansokho said that he was excluded from the candidate list because he was known to be averse to corruption. He remained a regional councillor.\"Entretien avec Amath Dansokho : ' Dans l'opposition, des gens souhaitaient ma mort'\", Wal Fadjri, April 20, 2009 . Dansokho and the PIT supported Macky Sall against President Wade in the February-March 2012 presidential election. Sall defeated Wade, and after taking office he appointed Dansokho as Special Adviser to the President, with the rank of Minister of State, in April 2012. Speaking at the PIT's sixth congress in July 2016, Dansokho, as Honorary President of the PIT, reaffirmed the party's support for Sall, \"as long as he remains on the right track\".Serigne Mansour Sy Cisse, \"6\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s du Pit : Amath Dansokho r\u00e9it\u00e8re son soutien au chef de l\u2019Etat\", Le Soleil, 25 July 2016 . ==References== Category:Members of the National Assembly (Senegal) Category:1937 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from K\u00e9dougou Category:Mayors of places in Senegal Category:Government ministers of Senegal Category:Party of Independence and Labour politicians ",
