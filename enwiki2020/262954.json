    "text": "Taglish or Englog is code-switching in the use of English and Tagalog, the most common languages of the Philippines. The words Taglish and Englog are portmanteaus of the words Tagalog and English. The earliest use of the word Taglish dates back to 1973, while the less common form Tanglish is recorded from 1999.Lambert, James. 2018. A multitude of 'lishes': The nomenclature of hybridity. English World-wide, 39(1): 31. DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam Taglish is widely used in the Philippines, but is also used by Filipinos in overseas communities. It also has several variants, including Co\u00f1o English, Jejenese and Swardspeak. ==Characteristics== Taglish is a manner of speaking of Manila involving the mixing of English and Tagalog together. Virgilio S. Almario. Wikang Taglish, Kamulatang Taglish.PAGASA VOWS : No more jargon, just plain 'Taglish,' in weather reports. The Philippine Daily Inquirer. March 23, 2011. However, this practice has spread to other areas where both English and Tagalog are spoken. Next to switching between sentences in \"pure\" Tagalog and English, Taglish speech especially consists of sentences that follow the rules of Tagalog grammar with Tagalog syntax and morphology, but that employ English nouns and verbs in place of their Tagalog counterparts. Examples: {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Tagalog ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Taglish / Englog |- |Could you explain it to me? |Maaaring ipaunaw\u00e0 mo sa akin. |Maaaring i-explain mo sa akin. |- |Could you shed light on it for me? |Pakipaliwanag mo sa akin. |Paki-explain mo sa akin. |- |Have you finished your homework? |Natapos mo na ba iyong takd\u00e1ng-aral\u00edn mo? |Finished na ba yung homework mo? |- |Please call the driver. |Pakitawag ang tsuper. |Pak\u00ed-call ang driver. |} English verbs and even some nouns can be employed as Tagalog verb roots. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the noun or verb. The English verb drive can be changed to the Tagalog word magda-drive meaning will drive (used in place of the Tagalog word magmamaneho). The English noun Internet can also be changed to the Tagalog word nag-Internet meaning have used the Internet. Taglish also uses sentences of mixed English or Tagalog words and phrases. The conjunctions used to connect them can come from any of the two. Some examples include: {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Tagalog ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Taglish / Englog |- |I will shop at the mall later. |Bibil\u00ed ako sa p\u00e1milihan m\u00e1may\u00e2. |Magsya-shopping ako sa mall m\u00e1may\u00e2. |- |Have you printed the report? |Nailathala mo na ba ang ulat? |Na-print mo na ba ang report? |- |Please turn on the aircon. |Pakibuks\u00e1n yung erkon. |Pakibuksan yung aircon. |- |Take the LRT to school. |Mag-tren ka papunt\u00e1ng paaral\u00e1n. |Mag-LRT ka papunt\u00e1ng school. |- |I cannot relate to the topic of his lecture. |Hindi ak\u00f3 makaintind\u00ed sa paks\u00e2 ng talumpat\u00ec niya. |Hindi ak\u00f3 maka-relate sa topic ng lecture niya.\"Taglish is not the enemy\".

The Philippine Daily Inquirer. 20:58:00 11/04/2009 |} Because of its informal nature, experts of English and Tagalog discourage its use.\"Tagalog, English, or Taglish?\". Manila Bulletin. March 20, 2005\"Filipino English, not Taglish\". Manila Bulletin. September 7, 2004.\"Stop using 'Taglish,' teachers, students told\". Manila Bulletin. June 1, 2006.\"Manila Journal; Land of 100 Tongues, but Not a Single Language\". The New York Times. Published: December 02, 1987. There are examples of modern books in Taglish: the adventure novel Bullet With A Name (2018) by Kirsten Nimwey, the love novel Aeternum Dream (2018) by Harkin Deximire, and more. ==Forms== ===Swardspeak=== Swardspeak is a kind of Taglish/Englog used by the bakla demographic of the Philippines. It is a form of slang that uses words and terms from Tagalog, English, Spanish, Cebuano and Hiligaynon as well as Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Sanskrit, and several other languages. Names of celebrities, fictional characters, and trademarks are also used. ===Co\u00f1o English=== Co\u00f1o English (Tagalog: Konyo) or Colegiala English () is a creole of Taglish/Englog that originated from the younger generations of rich families in Manila.The Routledge concise history of Southeast Asian writing in English. Routledge. 2010. New York City. The word co\u00f1o itself came from the Spanish word co\u00f1o. It is a form of Philippine English that has mixed Spanish, English, and Tagalog words. The most common aspect of Co\u00f1o English is the building of verbs by using the English word make with the base form of a Tagalog action word: {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Tagalog ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Co\u00f1o English |- |Let's skewer the fishballs. |Tusukin natin ang mga pishbol. |Let's tusok-tusok the fishballs. |- |Tell me the story of what happened... |Ikuwento mo sa akin kung ano ang nangyari... |Make kuwento to me what happened... |} And adding conjunction word like so before using a Tagalog adjective to finish the sentence. Examples: {| class=\"wikitable\" !English !Tagalog !Co\u00f1o English |- |He stinks! |Ang baho niya! |He's like so mabaho! |- |We were all annoyed with him. |Kinaiinisan namin siya. |We're like so inis sa kaniya! |} Sometimes, Tagalog interjections such as ano, naman, pa, na (or nah), no (or noh), a (or ha), e (or eh), and o (or oh) are placed to add emphasis. No and a (from the Tagalog word ano) are used for questions and are added only to the end of a sentence. Ano (meaning what) is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end. E (added to answers to questions) and o (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. Pa (meaning not yet, not yet done, to continue, or still) and na (meaning now, already, or already done) can be placed in the middle or end. Naman (the same as na but mostly only for emphasus) is placed anywhere. The interjection no? (equal to the Spanish \u00bfno? and the German nicht?) is pronounced as or , with a pure vowel instead of the English glide, which shows influence from Spanish. {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Tagalog ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Co\u00f1o English |- |I feel so hot already; please fan me now. |Naiinitan na ako; paypayan mo naman ako. |I'm so init na; please paypay me naman. |- |You wait here while I fetch my friend, all right? |Hintayin mo ako habang sinusundo ko ang kaibigan ko, a? |You make hintay here while I make sundo my friend, a? |- |What, you will still eat that apple after it already fell on the floor? |Ano, kakainin mo pa ang mansanas na'yan matapos mahulog na iyan sa sahig? |Ano, you will make kain pa that apple after it made hulog na on the sahig? |} English adjectives are often replaced with Tagalog verbs. The language also has many Spanish words like ba\u00f1o (\"bathroom\"), tostado (\"toasted\") and jam\u00f3n (\"ham\"). {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Tagalog ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Co\u00f1o English |- |They're so competent! |Magaling sila! |They're so galing! |- |Where's the bathroom? |Nasaan ang palikuran? |Where's the ba\u00f1o? |- |Keep my ham on the grill. |Itago mo lang ang hamon ko sa ihawan. |Make tago my jam\u00f3n on the grill. |- |I want my ham toasted. |Gusto kong tostado ang hamon ko. |I want my jam\u00f3n tostado. |} The feminine sound of Co\u00f1o English makes male speakers sometimes overuse the Tagalog word pare (which means \"pal\" or \"buddy\") to make it sound more masculine. Sometimes tsong (same meaning) is used instead of pare or with it: {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | English ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Tagalog ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Co\u00f1o English |- |Dude, he's so unreliable. |Pare, ang labo niya. |Pare, he's so malabo, pare. |- |Dude, he's so unreliable. |Tsong, ang labo niya. |Tsong, he's so malabo, tsong. |} ==See also== *Pseudo-anglicism *Code-switching *Bislish, code-switching between Visayan and English ==References== ==External links== *Wikang Taglish, Kamulatang Taglish, article by Virgilio S.
