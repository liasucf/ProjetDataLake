    "text": "Gerbert de Montreuil was a 13th-century French poet from the north of France. He wrote Le Roman de la violette or G\u00e9rard de Nevers,Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, French, 1553, f. 288r-325v one of the most outstanding medieval poems, famous for its vivid narrative and faithful depiction of contemporary customs. The poem underwent countless adaptations and imitations. It tells the trials of the unfortunate and innocent Euriant, who becomes an object of public dispute between G\u00e9rard de Nevers and Lisiard de Forez, the former taking her defense while the other suggests she is guilty of misconduct by claiming he knows of a violet-shaped mark on her bosom. The story percolated into Shakespeare's Cymbeline via Giovanni Boccaccio, and Carl Maria von Weber's opera Euryanthe. Gerbert is possibly the author of \"Gerbert's Continuation\", one of the Four Continuations of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. ==References== *Part of this article was translated from :de:Gerbert de Montreuil ==External links== * Category:13th-century births Category:13th-century deaths Category:13th-century French writers Category:Writers of Arthurian literature Category:French male writers ",
