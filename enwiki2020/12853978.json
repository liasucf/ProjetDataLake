In 1902 he graduated from the Saint Petersburg University and became a professor. He also worked in the British Museum, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde, Mus\u00e9e Guimet etc. In 1907, he travelled along with \u00c9douard Chavannes through several Chinese provinces, describing ancient sculptural monuments previously unknown to international scholarship, in particular the Song monuments of Henan and Tang monuments of Shaanxi.Victor Segalen, \"Chine. La grande statuaire\", and \"Les origines de la statuaire en Chine\", pp. 6-7. Segalen, and some other French sources, give V.M. Alexyev (Alexeieff) unlikely initials \"J.X.\"; this is probably a typo resulting from transcribing a handwritten text. ln addition to his Professorship, Alexeev became the Curator and Senior Researcher at the Asiatic Museum. In that role, he contributed a paper on Chinese folklore to a 1918 Museum symposium, published by its parent group, the Russian Academy of Sciences. Alexeev's situation at this time, though perilous like everybody else's, had great potential, which he quickly proceeded to realize. His position at the Museum gave him a realia basis: he had custody of artifacts for the study of Chinese popular tradition, including a large trove of Dunhwang documents brought back from a Russian expedition of 1914-1915. In 1919, Alexeev became associate editor, and chief of the Eastern division, of the newly founded Publishing House for World Literature. This provided a publishing outlet. Under his direction, the Museum's Sinological library was expanded, catalogued, and systematically employed in research, by a team of young persons Alexeev gradually gathered around him, among them the brilliant Shchutsky. Alekseyev has produced an acclaimed translation of the Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. The first volume was published in 1922 under the title Fox's Wiles. According to Tatyana Tolstaya, \"academician Alekseyev has found a special way of selecting and connecting Russian words which creates a distinctive brand of the Russian language, the one with a unique crystal grid, so to speak. The substance has not changed but has obtained new properties. While reading his texts, you get an illusion of reading a text in Chinese\". Alekseyev's translations from the World War II era were collected as The Chinese Classical Prose (\u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430) in 1958. ==Notable works== *Lisyi chary (Fox's Wiles, 1922) *Monakhi volshebniki (The Wizard Monks, 1923) *Kitayskaya ieroglificheskaya pis'mennost' i ee latinizatsiya (The Chinese Character Script and Its Romanization, 1932) *Rasskazy o lyudyakh neobychainykh (Stories About Extraordinary People, 1937) ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Soviet philologists Category:20th-century philologists Category:Russian sinologists Category:Writers from Saint Petersburg Category:Saint Petersburg State University alumni Category:Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917\u20131925) Category:Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Category:Chinese\u2013Russian translators Category:Soviet literary historians Category:Soviet male writers Category:20th-century Russian male writers Category:20th-century translators ",
