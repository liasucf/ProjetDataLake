He served the Kolhapur regency, too. == Early Life == Hambirrao was born in Talbid 1630. Sambhaji Mohite had 3 sons Harifrao, Hambirrao, Shankarji and 2 daughters Soyarabai and Annubai. Hambirrao's father Sambhaji Mohite was a very mighty and courageous chief. Hambirrao inherited all the qualities from his father. After the sacrifice of Prataprao Gujar, Shivaji made Hambirarao his Sersenapati (commander). == Battle of Koppal == At that time, the Koppal province of Karnataka was under Adilshah's general Abdul Rahimkhan Miyana and his brother Hussain Miyana. Both brothers used to take the grain of the farmers forcefully. The people of Koppal complained to Shivaji, then Shivaji sent his sersenapati Hambirrao. In Yelburga on January 1677, both the armies collided. Hambirrao and Dhanaji Jadhav did incomparable valor in this battle. More than half of Adilshahi's army was killed in this battle. Hambirrao killed Abdul Miyana and imprisoned Hussain Miyana. == Battle between Hambir Rao and Vyankoji == Hambirrao had two sisters, Soyarabai married Shivaji and the Annubai married Vyankoji (step-brother of Shivaji). When Shivaji came to Karnataka to Dakshin Digvijay (South conquest). When Vyankoji (Ekoji) refuses to share father's property with Shivaji then war starts between them and then Hambirrao won major provinces of Vyankoji such as Jagdevagad, Kaveripattam, Chidambaram, and Vriddhachalam. Vyankoji was very upset that Shivaji captured his states. On 6 November 1677, the battle started in Vyankoji and Hambirrao. Vyankoji won in battle, but later Hambirrao suddenly attacked Vyankoji's army and won the defeated battle. After two months Shivaji's intervention ended the fight. Hambirrao won the important fort of Vellore on 22 July 1678 from Adilshahi general Abdullakhan. == Role of Hambirrao in coronation of Sambhaji == Shivaji died on 3 April 1680. On 21 April, the corrupt ministers of Swarajya crowned Rajaram. At that time Rajaram was only ten years old. Rajaram was the nephew of Hambirrao. The ministers of Swarajya ordered Sambhaji to be imprisoned. When Hambirrao came to know about this, Hambirrao captured all the ministers and presented them to Sambhaji. This shows how deep Hambirao's undying loyalty to Swarajya was. == Attack on Burhanpur == Burhanpur was a major trade center connecting southern and northern India. There were a total of 17 trade centers in Burhanpur. On 30 January 1681, commanders Hambirrao Mohite and Sambhaji suddenly attacked Burhanpur. At that time the Subedar of Burhanpur was Khanjahan. For the protection of Burhanpur there was only an army of 200 and Hambirrao had an army of 20,000. The Mughals did not even have the strength to oppose Hambir Rao's army. The Marathas looted all the trade centers of Burhanpur for three days. Marathas got assets worth more than 1 crore hons in this battle. On 17 March 1683, Hambirrao defeated Ranamast khan, one of the most powerful chieftains of Aurangzeb, in Kalyan Bhiwandi. == Death == In 1687, in a battle fought near Wai province, Hambirrao defeated Rustumkhan, but a cannonball hit Hambir Rao, killing him. ==References== Book :- Senapati Hambirrao Mohite by Dr Sadashiv Shivde Category:People of the Maratha Empire ",
