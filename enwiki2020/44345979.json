Chigger was so small that we had to keep him taped up to prevent him from getting broken up . . . We had only 18 men on the squad. If we wanted to scrimmage we had to bend the line around.\" ===1909=== Browne was quarterback on the SIAA champion 1909 team. ==Coaching career== ===University of Florida=== He coached the Florida Gators track team of the University of Florida in 1926 and 1927. ==See also== *1909 Sewanee Tigers football team *1910 College Football All-Southern Team *Tick Tichenor ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Memphis, Tennessee Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Sewanee Tigers football players Category:Players of American football from Tennessee Category:All-Southern college football players Category:Florida Gators track and field coaches Category:Florida Gators football coaches ",
