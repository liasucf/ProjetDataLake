    "text": "Arbab Sikandar Khan Khalil () (1913\u20131982) was a governor of the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. He was of the National Awami Party, which won the 1970 elections in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and later formed the provincial governments. He was dismissed as Governor by the Federal government in 1973 and subsequently arrested as part of the Hyderabad tribunal. He was released in 1979 and was assassinated in 1981. His father was arrested in connection to Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre event in 1930 and died in 1932 in prison. So this what I say that Arbab Sikandar actually took my care as father from the age when I was just 2 and half year old. There were many ups and downs in Arbab Sikandar's political life which I will be reported later. Arbab Sikandar has six books in market and I am read proof of his English book \"Other side of the picture\", which will probably be available in few months. ==References== Category:Governors of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Pashtun people Category:1913 births Category:1982 deaths Sikandar Khan ",
