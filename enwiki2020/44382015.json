    "text": "The .45-60 Winchester is a centerfire rifle cartridge intended for 19th- century big-game hunting. Nomenclature of the era indicated the .45-60 cartridge contained a diameter bullet with of black powder. Winchester Repeating Arms Company shortened the .45-70 government cartridge to operate through the Winchester Model 1876 rifle's lever-action. The Colt Lightning Carbine and the Whitney Arms Company's Kennedy lever-action rifle were also chambered for the .45-60. These early rifles' advantage of faster loading for subsequent shots was soon eclipsed by the stronger and smoother Winchester Model 1886 action capable of handling longer cartridges including the popular full length .45-70. The .45-60 and similarly short cartridges designed for the Model 1876 rifle faded into obsolescence as 20th-century hunters preferred more powerful smokeless powder loadings of cartridges designed for stronger rifles. Winchester production of .45-60 cartridges ended during the great depression. ==References== Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges Category:Winchester Repeating Arms Company cartridges ",
