    "text": "ABC Radio Grandstand is a live radio sports focused commentary and talk-back program which runs on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation local radio network across Australia and on one digital-only station. The program runs on Saturdays and Sundays, typically from noon or an hour before, until 6 pm. Sports that are covered by ABC Radio under the Grandstand banner include Test and One Day International cricket, Rugby league (mostly in Queensland and New South Wales), the Summer Olympics, Australian Football League games, Australian Open tennis and soccer matches, including games involving the Socceroos and the A-League competition. However, when there are major football, cricket or tennis matches in progress, or the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, the coverage is often continued for the entirety of the relevant time frame if Grandstand is broadcasting the competition, as opposed to simply reporting the results. This can result in broadcasts in the early hours of the morning if Australia is playing in a cricket Test on another side of the world. Being a national program with significant local content, Grandstand includes live crosses to local ABC radio stations for sporting updates as well as centralised broadcasts of major events. ==Presenters== ===Simone Thurtell=== Simone Thurtell was a presenter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's ABC Local Radio's Grandstand program.profiles She formerly shared the hosting of the summer Grandstand program with others, including Karen Tighe, Tracy Holmes and Peter Walsh. She was ABC's around-the- ground reporter during international cricket matches played at the SCG. She is probably best known for her Grandstand Active Show, which featured regular guests from Kerry O'Keeffe, Geoff Huegill and Al Baxter among others and covered the sporting issues of the day, overnight scores and live crosses to sport. Thurtell also took the programme to the people with many outside broadcasts across NSW and Queensland.info needed Simone's career began in TV news journalism for Prime in Canberra and then freelancing for NBN in Newcastle before joining the ABC. Initially she worked for ABC TV Sport, before switching into the ABC Radio Grandstand team. She covered events such as the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 2004 Athens Olympics, 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, 2002 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, 2006 New Delhi Commonwealth Games. She called many sports, particularly Netball, including Australia's Gold medal campaign in the World Championships in Singapore in 2011. She also commentated a variety of sports at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, including the Gold Medal for Beach Volley Ball, won by Australia's pair of Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst. In 2009, Thurtell returned to host ABC Local Radio's Grandstand program after previously presenting Drive on 1233 ABC Newcastle in 2007 and 2008. During this time she was a key anchor during the 2007 Newcastle floods, for which the 1233 team won a Walkley Award. Thurtell described firsthand the grounding of the Pasha Bulker on Nobby's Beach and the rescue from the ship of the crew. ==Programming== ===Grandstand Cricket=== ABC Grandstand has been broadcasting cricket since the 1930, and is the only national Australian radio station to broadcast live Test, One Day and domestic cricket.
