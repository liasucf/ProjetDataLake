The definition has become more robust in recent decades, and has been revised and adapted by American Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians to be someone who \u201crecognizes that God\u2019s manifest presence transforms lives and cultures.\u201dCourse Curriculum - Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry A revivalist can also include someone that either presides over, or actively pursues, a religious re-awakening or restoration to spiritual ideas, orthodoxy, religious or personal experiences, and/or communal pursuit of divine occurrences. Revivals are defined as \u201ca period of heightened spiritual activity in a section of the church, brought about by a renewing and empowering work of the Holy Spirit, bringing a new sense of the presence of God, especially in his holiness, resulting in a deeper awareness of sin in the lives of believers, followed by new joy as sin is confessed and forgiven.\u201dWalter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Baker Academic Common jargon for these meetings or series of meetings can include, \u201chaving a revival meeting\u201d or \u201cto hold a revival.\u201d The meetings and gatherings can last for days, several weeks, or for many years on rare occasions. ==History== Revivalists have been prominent in all major evolutions of the Christian church.

Charles Finney also introduced the concept that revivals were not necessarily sovereign acts of God, but could be initiated by believers following Biblical precedents and prescriptions. Pastor Finney exclaimed, \"A revival is not a miracle, not dependent on a miracle, in any sense. It is purely philosophical result of the right use of the constituted means.\" Lyman Beecher, another prominent Second Great Awakening preacher,The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists, Barry Hankin, Greenwood Publishing Group was largely known for encouraging and expanding temperance. ==Revival from 1900-1950s== At the beginning of the 20th century, several \u201crevivals\u201d began across the United States, Europe, and eventually effected many parts of the world.
