Just as we love every member of the family, I love and cherish my fans and call them my dears.\u201d == Humanitarianism == In 2015, Dimash Kudaibergen gave a charitable concert, named \"From Heart to Heart\", in Atyrau, Kazakhstan, to provide essential medical treatment for a 5-year-old girl.

In 2016, he also gave a benefit performance at the \"100 Grandmas and Grandpas\" Charity Evening of the \"Zaman Are We\" Project in Astana, Kazakhstan. The elderly of the regional retirement homes were invited as honorary guests and the funds of the event were used for social, economic and medical help for elderly residents. Kudaibergen donated all profits of his 2016 \"Unforgettable Day\" concert, held in his home town Aktobe, to a regional charity organization. With the funds of the concert, seven families in need were supplied with water, utilities, medical care and clothing. A wheel chair accessibility ramp was also set up for a wheelchair-bound resident. He gave a benefit performance at the Grand Charity Ball 2016, in Uralsk, Kazakhstan. The teenage students of the local boarding school for visually impaired students were invited as honorary guests of the Ball. Several of these students performed a song on stage with him, and Kudaibergen also danced, in the Waltz part of the event, with the visually impaired invited guests. The Grand Charity Ball was organized by the Alpamys Sharimov Foundation, and the funds were donated to children with visual impairments, to this boarding school and to the regional orphanage. At the Top Chinese Music Awards 2017, within the \"Love Recycling\" Campaign, he donated the suit from his first performance at Hunan Television's Singer 2017 competition. The suit was auctioned by the Jingdong Platform and all the proceeds were donated to the Care of Children Foundation for children with blood lead poisoning. Kudaibergen gave charitable performances at the Global Gift Galas 2017 in Paris and Cannes. He was invited by Eva Longoria, Hollywood actress and Honorary Chair of the Global Gift Foundation.

Kudaibergen gave a charity performance at the \"Chinese National Wind Charity Concert\", in Beijing, that was held under the motto \"Pray for the Year\". It was hosted by the China Children's Fund and the China Youth Foundation. The funds from the concert were used to enable music classes in rural Chinese primary schools that could not afford them. He gave another charitable performance at the Villa International \"Beauty Touching\" charity event that was jointly hosted by the China Children and Teenagers Fund and \"Bridge Culture\" (supported by the China Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Association).

All proceeds went to promote young talent from Kazakhstan and sponsor youth\u2019 participation in prestigious international contests. Within the frame of the Shanghai Pet Adoption Day 2019, he became a supporter of the \"Love is Home\" initiative that aims to improve awareness and to increase adoptions of stray animals. On his 25th birthday he visited a nursing home for the elderly and the physically impaired in his hometown Aktobe. As it is customary for him on his birthday since his school days, he brought gifts and spent time with the residents. He also performed for them a cappella. A few days before his \"Arnau\" Concert of 29 June 2019, in Astana, Kazakhstan, there were explosions near the Kazakhstan city of Arys that caused injuries and casualties. Kudaibergen decided to donate funds from his concert to the victims. When he was in the Russian city of Kazan for his performance at the WorldSkills 2019, he visited the local children's hospice, to see a seriously ill fan who couldn't attend Kudaibergen's concert due to chemotherapy. When he was in Kyiv, Ukraine, for his Arnau Tour, he donated clothes and other belongings to an auction for the Ukrainian Okhmatdyt Center for Pedriatric Toxicology that aims to save the lives of children with acute poisoning, and also enables hemodialysis for children with low weight, heart problems and unstable blood pressure. During COVID-19 pandemic in Kazakhstan, Kudaibergen provided 102 needy families in Nur-Sultan and Aktobe with five tons of food. ==References== == External links == * Dimash Kudaibergen on Facebook * Dimash Kudaibergen on Instagram * Dimash Kudaibergen on Youtube Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Opera crossover singers Category:Kazakhstani pop singers Category:Kazakh folk singers Category:Kazakhstani male singers Category:Kazakh-language singers Category:Mandarin-language singers Category:Russian-language singers Category:Italian-language singers Category:21st-century male singers Category:21st-century multi-instrumentalists Category:Singers with a six- octave or greater vocal range Category:People from Aktobe Category:Russian National Music Award winners Category:Slavianski Bazaar winners ",
