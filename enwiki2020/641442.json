    "text": "\"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt\" is a traditional children's song that originates from the United States and Canada. The song consists of one verse repeated over and over again (usually repeated four times) with increasing in volume (or decreasing). Quieter and quieter, it is repeated four more times except for the closing \"DA-DA-DA...!\" phrase for each iteration. On the \"DA- DA-DA...!\", it's always louder. However, there have also been versions where it also speeds up. There are other ways of singing this song such as increasing (accelerando) or decreasing (ritardando) in tempo after each repetition. The lyrics of the song depend on who is singing. ==Lyrics and melody== There are various lyrics to the song; for example, the following is one version, which is repeated several times (four times), often while altering the tempo or pitch:\"Bug Juice Days\" Lynch, Dan { \\key d \\major \\time 4/4 \\repeat volta 2 { fis'2 e'4 d' a8 fis'8 fis'8 f'8 fis'4 r g'8 g'4 g'8 a'4 e'4 fis'2. r8 fis'8 a fis' fis' eis' fis'4. ais8 b8 g' g' fis' g'4 fis'8 g' a'4 a'8. b'16 a'8 g' fis' e' d' a' a' b' a' g' fis' e' } } \\addlyrics { John Ja- -cob Jin- -gle- -heim- -er Schmidt!

(Ya da da da da da da...) } ==Origin== While the origins of the song are obscure, some evidence places its roots with vaudeville and theatre acts of the late 19th century and early 20th century popular in immigrant communities. Some vaudeville acts during the era, such as the work of Joe Weber and Lew Fields, often gave voice to shared frustrations of German-American immigrants and heavily leaned on malapropisms and difficulties with the English language as a vehicle for its humor. Further, \"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt\" shares many characteristics with \"My Name Is Jan Jansen\", a song that can trace its origin to Swedish vaudeville in the late 19th century. By the mid-20th century, the song appears to have already become widely known. In 1931, the Elmira Star Gazette, a newspaper in upstate New York, reported that at a Boy Scout gathering at Seneca Lake, as scouts entered the mess hall \"Troop 18 soon burst into the first camp song, 'John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith'.\"Elmira Star-Gazette. \"Scouts Open Camp Seneca Term Sunday\".
