Two of these characters, Kendra Maibaum and Herbal Thought, did not return for the second season, and a third main character, Colonel Donald Michael Lydecker, was written out of the show shortly into the second season. Four new characters, however, become regulars for the series second and final season. The series was continued with three canonical novels; \"Skin Game\" picks up directly where season two ended, and was followed by the final media in the Dark Angel universe, \"After the Dark\". A prequel novel, \"Before the Dawn\", chronicles Max's life between escaping from Manticore, the government facility that created her, and the beginning of season one of the television series.
