    "text": "\"Heaven\" is the third posthumous single by Swedish DJ Avicii, featuring vocals by singer Chris Martin of British band Coldplay. The song was released on 6 June 2019, as the third single from Avicii's posthumous studio album Tim. The song became his third single, and his second posthumously, to reach number one on Billboards Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart in its 27 July 2019 issue.\"Avicii's 'Heaven' Hits No. 1 On Dance/Mix Show Airplay Chart\" from Billboard (25 July 2019) == Recording == The song was recorded with Chris Martin in 2014, at the same time they did \"A Sky Full of Stars\". It first premiered during Avicii's set at Future Music Festival in 2015. During the period of 2014 until 2019, there have been different versions of the song circulating the web. Finally Avicii chose the one with Chris Martin. In 2015, Avicii premiered \"Heaven\" at 2015 Ultra Music Festival with a different singer, Simon Aldred, and said he thought he did the track justice. In 2016, Avicii worked on a version of \"Heaven\" with producer Carl Falk, with a revamped vocal from singer Simon Aldred and electric guitars added to the track. Avicii played this version of the track during the course of 2016, until he retired that year. Before his death, he eventually decided to release the version with Chris Martin instead. The song was played in his memory by Nicky Romero during Kingsland Festival in 2018. As Nicky said, Tim sent to him a folder full of new music, mostly unfinished but still usable for the shows. On 27 May 2018, the song was leaked online after being played by NRJ radio. In April 2019, it was announced that the album Tim, which Avicii was working on before his death, would include the song \"Heaven\" in the album, which was released on 6 June 2019. In December 2019, \"Heaven\" was played live by Aldred at the Avicii Tribute Concert benefiting the Tim Bergling Foundation. ==Music video== The lyric video was released on 6 June 2019. The music video, called a \"tribute video\", which used old clips of Avicii, was released on 24 June 2019. ==Remixes== On 27 July 2019, David Guetta played the remix of the song of \"Heaven\" at the Tomorrowland festival featuring Morten. The song was released on 23 August 2019. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from YouTube and Expressen. *Avicii \u2013 songwriter, producer, bass guitar, keyboards, drum programming, programming *Chris Martin \u2013 vocals, songwriter, guitar *Simon Aldred \u2013 demo vocals (2015 & 2016 versions) *Carl Falk \u2013 mixer and mastering, electric guitar (2016 demo version) *Marcus Thunberg Wessel \u2013 engineer, assistant mixer *Kevin Grainger \u2013 mixer and mastering *Julio Rodriguez Sangrador \u2013 assistant mixer and mastering *Christopher Thordson \u2013 manager *Per Sundin \u2013 designer *Neil Jacobson \u2013 designer *Nick Groff \u2013 designer *Johnny Tennander \u2013 designer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia Dance (ARIA) | 3 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Croatia (HRT) | 75 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Euro Digital Songs (Billboard) | 5 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Germany Dance (Official German Charts) | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI)IFPI Greek Digital Singles (International) | 25 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 12 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mexico Ingles Airplay (Billboard) | 1 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Mega Top 50)\"Lijst van 22-06-2019 - MEGA TOP 50\" (in Dutch).
