    "text": "Baldwin Hall, also known as the Cross Roads Church, was built as the Severn Crossroads Methodist Episcopal Church and is currently a historic church at Millersville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It is a one-story gable-front frame structure in the Italianate and Carpenter Gothic-styles built in 1861. It was moved about 1930 and again in 1981. An addition, constructed about 1933, duplicates the exterior detailing of the original part. It is currently operated by the Severn Cross Roads Foundation, Inc., as a wedding and banquet facility known as Historic Baldwin Hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==References== ==External links== *, including photo from 1997, at Maryland Historical Trust *The Historical Marker Database website entry *Severn Cross Roads Foundation, Inc. website Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in Maryland Category:Churches in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Churches completed in 1861 Category:19th-century Methodist church buildings in the United States Category:Italianate architecture in Maryland Category:Methodist churches in Maryland Category:1861 establishments in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Methodist Episcopal churches in the United States ",
