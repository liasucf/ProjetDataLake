    "text": "One More Time was a Swedish pop group. Its members are Peter Gr\u00f6nvall, his wife Nanne Gr\u00f6nvall and Maria R\u00e5dsten. A fourth member, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se L\u00f6f, left the group shortly after the first album was released. In 1992, they began their international career with the release of the single \"Highland\", which peaked at #2 in Sweden and #80 in the UK. The Highland album, on which the single was featured, went gold in South Africa. Their second self-titled album followed in 1994 but wasn't as successful as the previous album. The group never dissolved and there are plans of a fifth album. Nanne Gr\u00f6nvall has had a successful solo career in Sweden since her first solo album in 1998. Peter Gr\u00f6nvall is the son of ABBA's Benny Andersson. == Eurovision Song Contest == One More Time has participated in Melodifestivalen two times, the Swedish selections for the Eurovision Song Contest. At the Melodifestivalen 1995, they entered as composers of the ballad \"Det vackraste\" (\"The Most Beautiful Thing\"), interpreted by Cecilia Vennersten. The song was runner-up of Jan Johansen and \"Se p\u00e5 mig\". \"Det vackraste\" was awarded a Grammis for Best Song of 1995. The group later recorded the song in English, named \"Living in a Dream\". At Melodifestivalen 1996, the group composed and performed the etno ballad \"Den vilda\" (\"The Savage\"), which won the selections and propelled them to third place in the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 in Oslo, Norway. == Band members == *Peter Gr\u00f6nvall (1991-1997) *Nanne Gr\u00f6nvall (1991-1997) *Maria R\u00e5dsten (1991-1997) *Th\u00e9r\u00e8se L\u00f6f (1991-1992) == Discography == *1992: Highland *1994: One More Time *1996: Den vilda *1997: Living in a Dream (English version of the Den vilda album) == References == == External links == *Official page for Nanne Gr\u00f6nvall (Swedish) * Official page for Maria R\u00e5dsten (Swedish) * Lyrics for Den vilda at diggiloo.net Category:Melodifestivalen contestants Category:Melodifestivalen winners Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Sweden Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1996 Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Swedish pop music groups ",
