This provides trainee input into the work of the Scottish Academy and also acts as an independent, coordinated trainee voice in Scotland. The Academy produced a report entitled \"Learning from serious failings in care\" in July 2015. The investigation was launched after recent scandals in the health service and found the problems had been predominantly caused by the failure of clinical staff and NHS management to work together. They found leadership and accountability were often lacking but bullying was endemic Their 20 recommendations for improvements in the NHS included a set of minimum safe staffing levels for consultants, doctors, nurses and other staff in hospital settings. They criticised a target driven culture, saying: \"Quality care must become the primary influence on patient experience... and the primary indicator of performance.\" ==References== ==External links== * Scottish Academy Category:Royal Colleges Category:Scottish medical associations ",
