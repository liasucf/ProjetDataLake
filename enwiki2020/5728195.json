    "text": "Fabio Celestini (born 31 October 1975) is a Swiss football manager and former player. A defensive midfielder, he started and finished his 15-year professional career with Lausanne, and also played for ten years in France and Spain, representing four clubs. He appeared with the Swiss national team at Euro 2004. After retiring as a player, he moved into management, and is now the manager of FC Luzern. ==Club career== Born in Lausanne, Celestini started playing professionally with hometown's FC Lausanne-Sport, then had a four- season spell in France, spending two years each with Troyes AC and Olympique de Marseille. Whilst with the latter he played the 2004 UEFA Cup final, coming on as a substitute in the second half of the 0\u20132 loss to Valencia CF. Celestini moved to Spain in 2004, playing one season with Levante UD. After the team's immediate relegation he stayed in the country, joining fellow La Liga club Getafe CF where he never was an undisputed starter, but managed to feature heavily in consecutive seasons. In 2007\u201308, as the Madrid outskirts side reached the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup, he scored against R.S.C. Anderlecht in a 2\u20131 group stage home win. On 16 February 2010, after having been regularly used in the past two seasons, albeit not as a usual first- choice, the 34-year-old Celestini announced he would not renew his contract with Getafe, choosing to return to Lausanne on a one-year deal. However, due to a break in negotiations over his future role at the club after his playing career, he decided to retire before the end of the campaign, playing his last game on 15 December against U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo in the Europa League group stage. On 24 March 2015, after a spell as assistant manager at Spanish club M\u00e1laga CF and head coach with Italian amateurs Terracina Calcio 1925, Celestini replaced Marco Simone at Lausanne-Sport in the latter capacity, as the side was in a poor run of results in the Swiss Challenge League. Two months later, he was confirmed in this role for the next three years. In 2015\u201316, Celestini led his team back to the Swiss Super League after a two- year absence. On 3 October 2018, he was appointed at FC Lugano in the same division. Just over a year later, he was ousted from his job due to bad results, and replaced by Maurizio Jacobacci. Celestini signed as manager of FC Luzern on 2 January 2020, on a contract until 30 June 2021. ==International career== A Switzerland international since 1998, Celestini collected 35 caps and was a participant at the UEFA Euro 2004 (appearing in two incomplete matches, as the nation exited in the group stage). ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lausanne Category:Swiss people of Italian descent Category:Swiss footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Swiss Super League players Category:FC Lausanne-Sport players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Troyes AC players Category:Olympique de Marseille players Category:La Liga players Category:Levante UD footballers Category:Getafe CF footballers Category:Switzerland international footballers Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:Swiss expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Swiss expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Swiss expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Swiss football managers Category:FC Lausanne-Sport managers Category:FC Lugano managers Category:FC Luzern managers Category:Swiss expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Italy Category:Swiss expatriate sportspeople in Italy ",
