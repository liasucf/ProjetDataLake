Healy stated: > \"We wrote Medicine for our chosen scenes. Medicine, its title and sentiment, > goes all the way back to the original the 1975 project that was based in my > bedroom. It's a new piece of music informed by the genesis of our band and > our love for 'Drive' as a film. ... The movie itself plays with the duality > of resignment and hope - and this is most obvious and stirring in the scenes > we chose to score. The song is a testament to that same idea and has in turn > become one of our most personal and best loved pieces of music to date.\" It was premiered on BBC Radio 1 at 7:30 pm on 30 October 2014, a few hours before Drive was shown on BBC Three.
