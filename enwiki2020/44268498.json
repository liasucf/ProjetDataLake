The gasoline-powered aircraft has a two- bladed rotor and is remote-controlled by a line-of-sight user. It was designed primarily for agricultural use, and is capable of precise aerial spraying of crops. The R-MAX has been used in Japan and abroad for agriculture and a variety of other roles, including aerial surveys, reconnaissance, disaster response and technology development. ==Development== The Yamaha R-MAX and its predecessor, the Yamaha R-50, were developed in the 1990s in response to demand in the Japanese market for aerial agricultural spraying. Fixed-wing manned crop dusters had been in use in Japan for many years, but the small size of most Japanese farms meant that this method was inefficient. Manned helicopters were sometimes used for spraying, but were very expensive. The R-MAX allowed much more precise small-scale spraying, at a lower cost and lower risk than manned aircraft.Sato, Akira. \"The R-MAX Helicopter UAV\" (PDF). DTIC.mil. 2 September 2003.

The R-MAX allowed scientific observers to spot and measure build-ups of volcanic ash which would have otherwise been missed, and improved the observers' ability to predict hazardous volcanic mudslides. ===Fukushima nuclear disaster=== Yamaha R-MAXs were used in the wake of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami to monitor radiation levels around the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster from inside the \"no-entry\" zone.\"Yamaha Motors Monthly Newsletter\" (PDF).

In 2002, Georgia Tech's UAV Research Facility began using a Yamaha R-MAX for research into autonomous aerial guidance, navigation, and control systems.\"System Integration and Operation of a Research Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\".
