    "text": "Graphics32 is a free graphics library for Borland Delphi and Kylix optimized for 32-bit pixel formats which is licensed under the Mozilla Public License. Graphics32 provides fast operations for pixels and graphic primitives and is almost a hundred times faster in per-pixel and about 2\u20135 times faster in drawing lines access than the standard components by Embarcadero which are wrappers for the Windows GDI. Additionally, it provides alpha blending, anti- aliasing as well as filters for resampling and deforming bitmaps. ==Features== Some of Graphics32 features include: *Fast per-pixel access up to 100 times faster compared to standard TBitmap *High-performance Bitmap alpha blending (including per-pixel alpha blending) *Pixel, line and polygon antialiasing with sub-pixel accuracy (combined with alpha blending) *Bitmap resampling with high quality reconstruction filters (e.g. Lanczos, Cubic, Mitchell) *Flexible supersampling implementation for maximum sampling quality *Flicker-free image displaying components with optimized double buffering via advanced MicroTiles based repaint optimizer ==Link== * *Additional information Category:Graphics libraries Category:Pascal (programming language) software ",
