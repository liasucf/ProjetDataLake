Greekazo started his career on 31 July 2019 with the music single \"HotSpot\" which has received over 23 million streams on Spotify. His other songs have been streamed over 60 million times on Spotify. He released his debut studio album G\u00f6r Nu, T\u00e4nk Sen on 30 March 2020, which peaked at number three on the Swedish Albums Chart. In December 2019, Greekazo appeared in a much publicized interview with Malou von Sivers on her talkshow Malou efter tio broadcast on TV4. He had been invited to talk about his career, but the interview soon turned into questions about his views on criminality and drugs. The interview received a lot of criticism and a debate about if one person can be held accountable for crime sprees in the suburbs. Greekazo later received an invitation to come back to the show for another interview, but denied the request, since he believed he didn't have the need to \"prove anything\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| SWE |- ! scope=\"row\"| G\u00f6r Nu, T\u00e4nk Sen | * Released: 30 March 2020 * Label: HotSpot Music * Formats: Digital download, streaming | 3 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"HotSpot\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2019 | 3 | G\u00f6r Nu, T\u00e4nk Sen |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sprayad\" | 3 | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Apoteket\" | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ice Cream\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2020 | 2 | rowspan=\"2\"| G\u00f6r Nu, T\u00e4nk Sen |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Puta\" | 56 |} ====Featured on==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"F\u00f6rsent\" | 2019 | 2 |1 \u00c5r |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sig Sauer\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2020 | 21 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"F\u00f6rsent 2\" | 97 | G\u00f6r Nu, T\u00e4nk Sen |} ===Other charted songs=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Big Mac\" | 2020 | 33 |G\u00f6r Nu, T\u00e4nk Sen |} ==References== == External links == Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:People from Stockholm Category:Swedish people Category:Swedish rappers Category:Swedish people of Greek descent ",
