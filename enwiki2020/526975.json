    "text": "Animositisomina is the eighth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on February 17, 2003 by Sanctuary Records. ==Background== The album's title is a palindrome made of the word \"animosity\" spelled without the final letter and both forward and backward. According to an interview on Fuse's Uranium, Jourgensen was bored at the time he was coming up with an album title. It is Ministry's first album to feature lyrics in the album sleeve, which prior albums did not provide. \"The Light Pours Out of Me\" was written and originally recorded by Magazine for their Real Life album in 1978 and it is the only song in the album to have more than one word in the title. Ministry performed the song several times in concerts in the late 1980s, but it was never released or recorded officially. Animositisomina is the last Ministry album with Paul Barker, thus ending the band's \"Hypo Luxa/Hermes Pan\" production duo. In addition, it is also the last album to feature Ministry performing in their traditional industrial metal style before switching to a more thrash-oriented sound on their next album, Houses of the Mol\u00e9. In April 2016, Jourgensen called Animositisomina his least-favourite Ministry album, declaring it was \"not fun to make\" as he was finally quitting heroin cold turkey during the recording sessions. Additionally, his relationship with Barker's had become antagonistic, which prompted the latter to quit the band after the Animositisomina tour. \"Leper,\" the last song on the album, was left as an instrumental as Jourgensen had left the studio earlier than scheduled and was uninterested in writing lyrics.http://thequietus.com/articles/20135-al-jourgensen-favourite-ministry- albums-interview?page=14 Jourgensen considers Animositisomina a \"non-album\" and left most of the recording responsibilities to Barker. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Ministry=== *Al Jourgensen \u2013 vocals (1-8), guitars (1-8, 10), keyboards (1, 4-6, 8, 10), de-programming, production *Paul Barker \u2013 bass, programming, keyboards (2, 5, 7, 9, 10), vocals (9), rhythm guitar (5, 7, 9), production ===Additional personnel=== *Max Brody \u2013 drums and percussion, programming (1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10), sax (9) *Adam Grossman \u2013 guitars (1) *Rey Washam \u2013 drums and percussion (2\u20134, 8) *Louis Svitek \u2013 guitars (2\u20134, 8) *Angela Lukacin-Jourgensen \u2013 background vocals (4) *Kathryn Kinslow \u2013 chorus vocals (8) *Justin Leeah - engineer *Joey Cazares - assistant engineer *Bobby Torres - assistant engineer *Paul Elledge - art & direction *Leasha Elledge - art & direction *Tim Bruce - design *Tom Baker - mastering ==Chart positions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2003) !Peak position |- |The Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|157 |- |French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|125 |- |German Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|93 |- |UK Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|186 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2003 albums Category:Albums produced by Al Jourgensen Category:Ministry (band) albums Category:Sanctuary Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Sonic Ranch ",
