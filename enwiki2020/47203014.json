During the first month of its work, it worked as a part of I Grammar School, but gained its independence the next month, on November 8, and named itself The State IV Grammar School for boys in Zagreb. IV Grammar School shared its building with the II Classical Grammar School in the Izidor Kr\u0161njavi Street, today a primary school. The first principal was dr. Dane Medakovi\u0107. In the report for 1940, 8 Ph.D.s worked in the school. The school moved again in 1943, to the university. With the end of the Second World War, IV Grammar School moved to the building of the Real Grammar School, in the southern wing, across the hotel Continental. In 1947 the school moved to Roosevelt square, where it remained until its abolishment in the year 1977, when it entered the composition of the Center. When the school building was turned into the Mimara Museum in 1986, the school moved to various places in the city, with the directory in the Var\u0161avska Street. Since the school year 1953/1954 the school has been co-educational, after working as a boys' school for 20 years. In 2015, three quarters of the students were girls. Up until then, the school had 14 to 20 classes every year. With the loss of its old building on the Roosevelt square, the City of Zagreb promised to build a new building for the needs of I and IV Grammar School. This promise was fulfilled with the completion of a modern building in Novi Zagreb, in the neighborhood Utrine. In 2014 the school moved again, having its own building for the first time. Ever since, the school has been in the neighborhood Kajzerica. ==Programs== In Croatia, grades are restarted upon entering high school, so the grades are 1st-4th.
