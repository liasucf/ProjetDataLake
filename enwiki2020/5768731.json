This species has an erect trunk, usually 2\u20134 m tall. Fronds are 1\u20132 m long and bi- or tripinnate. The stipe is warty near the base and covered with scattered scales that are dark, glossy, and have fragile edges. Sori occur near the midvein of fertile pinnules and are covered by small, dark indusia which resemble small scales. The specific epithet amboinensis refers to Ambon or Amboina, an island in the Moluccas. ==References== amboinensis Category:Flora of Sulawesi Category:Flora of the Maluku Islands Category:Plants described in 1916 ",
