As member of Heinz Zemanek's \"Mail\u00fcfterl-Team\", he worked on the country's first transistor computer. After finishing his dissertation he was hired by IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, retiring in 1995.O. Univ.-Prof. Dr. Heinz Zemanek: 60 Jahre Vorlesungen an der TU Wien. Abgerufen am 28. September 2015. ==Career== Team Mail\u00fcfterl Rothauser worked on the Mail\u00fcfterl with Zemanek and a team of students. In 1960, he finished his dissertation about the Vocoder at TU Wien.Verbundkatalog: A pulse method for voice transmission according to the vocoder principle. Dissertation 1960. It was first used in the Siemens studio for electronic music, before being used in popular music in the 1970s.
