It was introduced in Brazil by the Portuguese during the colonial period.Monjolo Equipamento r\u00fastico para moagem de gr\u00e3os custa 200 reais, economiza energia, funciona bem e tem vida longa por Gustavo Laredo - Revista Globo Rural It can be used to peel and grind dry beans, resulting in a thicker flour.A Hist\u00f3ria do Uso da \u00c1gua no Brasil: Do descobrimento ao S\u00e9culo XX, um projeto da Ag\u00eancia Nacional de \u00c1guas, 2007 It is formed by a wooden beam suspended so that the part that supports the pestle is larger than the other, which ends with a trough. A spout fills the trough with the water, thus raising the pestle. When the trough is full, it lowers the trough, and when the trough spills the water, the beam falls, causing the pestle to hit the mortar. As such, the monjolo is an important tool for agricultural facilitation. It is common for rural people to seek to live near a river or stream as a source of water. The monjolo is considered one of the most useful machines for planters of multiple crops. == See also == * Pestle * Shishi-odoshi * Trip hammer * Water mill * Water wheel == References == ==External links== * Monjolo construction by Primitive Technology Category:Equipment Category:Hydraulics ",
