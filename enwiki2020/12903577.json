The overall length of the bridge is , with the western span measuring and the eastern span one foot less. The bridge has an overall width of , with a roadway of . The bridge is covered by a corrugated metal gable roof, and is sided in vertical boarding that extends only partway to the eaves. The siding extends around to the insides of the portals. The bridge was built in 1911 by the Berlin Construction Company, replacing one that was washed away by flooding in 1905. It is one of only two Howe truss bridges over the Connecticut River; the other, the Columbia Bridge, was built in 1912. The two bridges are among the last to be built during the historic period of covered bridge construction in either state. The costs of construction and maintenance are shared by the two towns. The most recent rededication of the bridge took place on November 23, 1983. == See also == * List of crossings of the Connecticut River * List of covered bridges in Vermont * List of covered bridges in New Hampshire * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire * National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Vermont * National Register of Historic Places listings in Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire ==References== == External links == * Category:1911 establishments in Vermont Category:1911 establishments in New Hampshire Category:Buildings and structures in Lunenburg, Vermont Category:Covered bridges in New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges in Vermont Category:Bridges over the Connecticut River Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:Bridges completed in 1911 Category:Wooden bridges in Vermont Category:Wooden bridges in New Hampshire Category:Tourist attractions in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Essex County, Vermont Category:Tourist attractions in Essex County, Vermont Category:Road bridges in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, Vermont Category:Lancaster, New Hampshire Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:Howe truss bridges in the United States Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States ",
