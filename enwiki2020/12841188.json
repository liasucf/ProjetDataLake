It is connected by a western ridge to the 2nd-highest peak in the range, Caherconree . Baurtregaum has several subsidiary peaks including, Baurtregaum NW Top , Baurtregaum NE Top (with northern spur Scragg), and Baurtregaum Far NE Top . The most notable of Baurtgreaum's \"three hollows\" is the northerly Derrymore Glen, through which the Derrymore River runs, and which contains three scenic lakes, bounded by the steep valley walls of Baurtregaum and Caherconree and the peak of Gerhane . Also notable is the easterly Curraheen Glen, through which the Curraheen River runs, is bounded by the long easterly ridge from Baurtregaum to Baurtregaum Far NE Top. Baurtregaum's prominence of qualifies it as a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 6th-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres. == Hill walking == The popular route is the Derrymore Glen Horseshoe, a 11-kilometre 5-hour loop that starts from the base of the Derrymore Glen and ascends to the first summit of Gearhane , and then around the \"horseshoe\" to Caherconree and the summit of Baurtregaum. Options for the descent use either the Baurtregaum NW Top spur or the Baurtregaum NE Top Spur (and the Scragg) to get back to the base of the Glen. The route is recommended for its views of the Glen as well as incorporating most of the main peaks of the Slieve Mish range, and thus is also called The Slieve Mish Circuit in some guidebooks. ==Gallery== File:Baurtregaum North West Top.jpg|Baurtregaum NW Top File:Baurtregaum Summit Trig Point.jpg|Baurtregaum summit File:Baurtregaum, Derrymore Glen lakes.jpg|Lakes of Derrymore Glen File:Lakes in Derrymore Glen, Baurtregaum.jpg|Baurtregaum from Caherconree File:Baurtregaum NW Top.jpg|Baurtregaum NW Top ==Bibliography== * * * ==See also== *Lists of mountains in Ireland *List of mountains of the British Isles by height *List of P600 mountains in the British Isles *List of Marilyns in the British Isles *List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland == References == ==External links== *MountainViews: The Irish Mountain Website, Baurtregaum *MountainViews: Irish Online Mountain Database *The Database of British and Irish Hills , the largest database of British Isles mountains (\"DoBIH\") *Hill Bagging UK & Ireland, the searchable interface for the DoBIH Category:Mountains and hills of County Kerry Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Hewitts of Ireland Category:Mountains under 1000 metres ",
