    "text": "The Black Flux is the second studio album by Norwegian avant-garde metal band Virus. It was released on 10 November 2008 via Season of Mist. ==Background== The Black Flux was recorded between June 2007 and July 2008 at Amper Tone Studios, Oslo. This is the band's only studio album that was released by the label Season of Mist. ==Track listing== ==Critical reception== The album received generally positive reviews. AllMusic reviewer Greg Prato stated: \"Most times, this Oslo, Norway-based outfit sounds comparable to Voivod, but at other times sound like a distant musical disciple of the Melvins (with far less distortion on the guitar and more discernible vocals). Either way, one thing's for certain. These chaps like to stretch a guitar part until your brain goes numb, as evidenced by the album's title track, which rambles on for nearly three minutes before the vocals finally kick in. Elsewhere, a tune like \"Lost Peacocks\" cuts to the chase quicker when it comes to the vocals, with a singing style (courtesy of Virus' singer/guitarist, Czral) that sounds patterned after the late/great Ian Curtis from Joy Division.\" ==Personnel== ;Virus * Czral \u2014 vocals, guitars * Plenum \u2014 bass guitar * Einz \u2014 drums ;Additional personnel * B\u00e5rd Ingebrigtsen \u2014 baritone guitar, violin, piano, slide guitar, effects, production * B9 \u2014 soundscapes, ambience (tracks 3, 5) ;Other staff * Tom Kv\u00e5lsvoll \u2014 mastering * Sapfo Stavrides \u2014 photography * Kvohst \u2014 lyrics ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Virus (Norwegian band) albums Category:Season of Mist albums ",
