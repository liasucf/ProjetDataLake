    "text": "The NWA National Television Championship was a secondary singles championship in the National Wrestling Alliance's Georgia Championship Wrestling territory. It started as the NWA Georgia Television Championship before becoming the National Television Championship. From 1983 to 1985, it was renamed the NWA World Television Championship, but when Jim Crockett Promotions purchased Georgia Championship Wrestling back from the World Wrestling Federation, the Georgia version of the NWA World Television Championship was reduced back to the NWA National Television Championship, in favor of the Crockett version. On April 21, 1985, the championship was abandoned. == Title history == {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !Name !Duration |- |NWA Georgia Television Championship |1969\u20131979 |- |NWA National Television Championship |1979\u20131984 |- |NWA World Television Championship |1984\u20131985 |- |NWA National Television Championship |1985 |} == List of combined reigns == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|RankEach reign is ranked highest to lowest; reigns with the same number are tied for that rank. !style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Wrestler !style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|No. of reigns !style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Combined days |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- |rowspan=2| | | | |- | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- |rowspan=2| | | | |- | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- |rowspan=2| | | | |- | | | |- |rowspan=2| | | | |- | | | |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *NWA National Television Championship history at Wrestling-Titles.com *NWA World Television Championship history at Wrestling-Titles.com Category:Georgia Championship Wrestling championships Category:Television wrestling championships Category:Regional professional wrestling championships ",
