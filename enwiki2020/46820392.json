    "text": "Shamakami was an early newsletter for South Asian lesbians and bisexual women. It was launched in June 1990 and was published until at least 1997. Feminist Collections described Shamakami as a \"ten-page publication offers news of relevant conferences and resources, poetry, lengthy editorials, and various personal essays.\" It was initially launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts, primarily published out of San Francisco, and edited by the Shamakami Collective. According to Willy Wilkinson, \"the Bengali term shamakami literally means 'love for your equal or same,' and is a reclaimed word that describes a woman who desires other women.\" Monisha Das Gupta describes shamakami as an \"excavated indigenous term\" meaning \"those who desire their equals.\" Subscriptions cost $10 per year. == Issues== * June 1990: Volume 1 * January 1991: Volume 2, #1 * June 1991: Volume 2, #2 * February 1992: #4 * June 1994: special edition * November 1994: #7 * February 1997: #9, special edition published by Khuli Zaban Alt URL == See also == * Anamika newsletter, 1985-1987 ==References== Category:LGBT-related magazines published in the United States Category:Asian-American culture in San Francisco Category:Asian- American feminism Category:Asian-American magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Feminism in California Category:Feminist magazines Category:Lesbian culture in California Category:Lesbian feminist literature Category:Lesbian-related magazines Category:LGBT Asian-American culture Category:LGBT culture in San Francisco Category:Magazines established in 1990 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1997 Category:Magazines published in Boston Category:Magazines published in San Francisco Category:Newsletters ",
