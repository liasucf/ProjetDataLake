He married Mary Louise Laurie on December 24, 1906, and they had three children. A politician and businessman, he served as Prime Minister of Newfoundland for 33 days in 1924 as leader of a caretaker administration after the successive collapses of the Liberal Reform Party governments of Prime Ministers Sir Richard Squires and William Warren. The governor asked Hickman to form an administration to govern the province when the government of William Warren was defeated in a Motion of No Confidence. Hickman invited members of various former members of the Liberal Reform Party as well as members of other parties into his government which he called the Liberal-Progressive Party. His new party was defeated in the 9 June 1924 election by former supporters of Warren who joined with the conservative opposition to form the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party. Hickman served as Leader of the Opposition until he retired from politics in 1928, by which time his party had degenerated and a new Liberal Party had emerged led by Squires. Albert Hickman died at his home in St. John's on February 9, 1943. ==References== ==External links== *Newfoundland in the 1920s Category:1875 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Prime Ministers of the Dominion of Newfoundland Category:People from Grand Bank ",
