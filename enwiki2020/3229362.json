Sathariel (Hebrew \u05e1\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc, Greek: \u03a3\u03b1\u03b8\u03b9\u03ae\u03bb) is one of the Qliphoth, corresponding to the Sephirah Binah on the kabbalistic Tree of life. It represents the Concealment of God, which hides the face of Mercy. The form of the demons attached to this Qliphah are of black veiled heads with horns, with hideous eyes seen through the veil, followed by evil centaurs. The Qliphoth are the shadow of the Sephirot, the chaotic force that exists when the Sephirah is unbalanced. Binah is the Sephirah that gives birth to form, the great mother of the cosmos, the eternal womb. Through her, the spiritual energy of Keter and Chokmah are woven into the matrix that eventually becomes matter. But when this force is unbalanced, then the spiritual principle is hidden, matter is taken to be simply matter, and is not understood to be simply condensed energy, which is crudified spirit. Binah, the giver of form, becomes Sathariel, the concealer of spirit. Sathariel is described in the Book of Enoch as the 17th Watcher of the 20 leaders of the 200 fallen angels. The name is believed to be of Babylonian origin and a combination of shetar and el (God) with the name meaning \"side of God\". Michael KnibbThe Ethiopic Book Of Enoch. Knibb, Michael A., Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978, repr. 1982. believes the name to mean \"Moon of God\" or \"Dawn of God\" based on the Ge'ez copies of the Book of Enoch. The cortex or outer shell of Sathariel is called the order of Sheireil, \"The Hairy Ones of God\". This demonic order has been describedThomas Karlsson: Qabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic (English title, ). as a black labyrinth of chaotic riddles, where Lucifuge reigns. The magician's third eye is opened and darkness becomes light if ascension progresses through this order. This results in the magician learning to see the light of Lucifer and becoming clairvoyant. In qliphotic kabbalah, Sathariel is the third qliphah after Thamiel and Chaigidel. Sathariel is directly connected to Thamiel, Chaigidel, Da'at, Gamchicoth and Golachab. These connections are described as gateways or tunnels, similar to the paths between the sephiras. == See also == * The Temple of the Black Light == References == Category:Watchers (angels) Category:Qliphoth Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases ",
