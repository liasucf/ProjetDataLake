    "text": "The Pshdar dog () or Kurdish mastiff is an ancient dog landrace native to the Kurdistan region. This dog is often used as a livestock guardian against predators. It is the oldest dog breed in the Asian regionand one of the oldest in the world. Its history dates back to 6,000 years, when its ancestors were used by Assyrians and Babylonians as war dogs and for protection against wild animals. It was, and still is, specially prized for its high stamina while fighting external threats, especially wild animals and other dogs. It has a fish-like body, broader at the chest and narrower at the waist, which enables it to twist and turn at high speeds irrespective of its huge frame. The breed is found in Iran in the cities of Bukan, Mahabad, Saqez, Sanandaj, Piranshahr; most of the cities of West Azerbaijan; and parts of Iraqi Kurdistan. The name is most likely derived from the Pshdar region of Iraqi Kurdistan. This breed has been a native breed which formed due to natural selection and a bit of human interference. The coats of Kurdish mastiffs can be yellow, white, red, burgundy, blue and black. The breed has loose skin, large dewlaps, and non- cartilaginous (soft and floppy) ears. The breed is longer and stronger than the other Asian mastiffs. Its body length is especially eye-catching, since it has a long and slender body resembling the lion. This breed has a significantly larger amount of endurance comparative to other dog breeds. It also has high body strength and is usually longer than other giant dog breeds. ==Weight and height== Kurdish mastiff Males weigh between 50 and 92 kilograms (even crossing 100 kg in rare cases), females 45 to 80 kilograms. The height of these dogs at the shoulder is between 75 and 90 centimeters in males and between 70 and 85 in females. == Age == The Kurdish mastiff has a surprisingly longer life span than most dog breeds because it was formed by natural selection thousands of years ago and is very adaptable and suited to the Kurdish climate. If the proper nutrition and home are provided, these dogs live on average 9 to 13 years. If they are used in combat, their expected lifespan is reduced to 6-8 years. ==Maintenance== Kurdish mastiffs need long walks during the day to drain their energy. Besides this, they also need other exercises like running and hiking. A large garden or a large courtyard is a must. They are not suited to living in apartments. ==Image gallery== File:Pshdar Dog From Kurdistan-Kurdish Dog-Kurd Mastiff.jpg|Pshdar dog from Kurdistan File:Kurdish Dog-Pshdar Dog-Kurd Mastiff-Kurdish Dog Breed.jpg|Kurdish mastiff File:Assyrian dog dog Inscription-Assyrian mastiff History-Pshdar dog-Assyrian Dog-Mesopotamia.jpg|Mesopotamian inscription File:Assyrian dog-Assyrian mastiff-Pshdar dog History-Inscription.jpg|Assyrian War Mastiff dog inscription ==See also== *Kurdistan *Pshdar District *List of dog breeds *Mesopotamia ==References== * * * * * Category:Livestock guardian dogs Category:Rare dog breeds ",
