The Muses themselves are sometimes called by this name.Quintus Smyrnaeus. The Fall of Troy, Book 6.76.Harry Thurston Peck. Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, s.v.

And now was heard the sound of pennons in the air, and > voices, too, gave salutations from the lofty trees. Minerva (Athena), > thinking they were human tongues, looked up in question whence the perfect > words; but on the boughs, nine ugly jays (with \u039a\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 and Pica often > erroneously translated as magpies by later commentators) perched, those > mockers of all sounds, which now complained their hapless fate. And as she > wondering stood, Urania, goddess of the Muse, rejoined;\u2014\u201cLook, those but > lately worsted in dispute augment the number of unnumbered birds.\u2014Pierus was > their father, very rich in lands of Pella; and their mother (called Evippe > of Paeonia) when she brought them forth, nine times evoked, in labours nine, > Lucina's (Eilethyia) aid.\u2014Unduly puffed with pride, because it chanced their > number equaled ours these stupid sisters, hither to engage in wordy contest, > fared through many towns;\u2014through all Haemonia and Achaia came to us, and > said;\u2014`Oh, cease your empty songs, attuned to dulcet numbers, that deceive > the vulgar, untaught throng. If aught is yours of confidence, O Thespian > Deities contend with us: our number equals yours. We will not be defeated by > your arts; nor shall your songs prevail.\u2014Then, conquered, give Hyantean > Aganippe; yield to us the Medusean Fount;\u2014and should we fail, we grant > Emathia's plains, to where uprise Paeonia's peaks of snow.\u2014Let chosen Nymphs > award the prize\u2014.' The nymphs became the judges of the musical contest. One of the Pierides sang about the flight of the Olympian gods from the monster Typhoeus: > Twas shameful to contend; it seemed more shameful to submit. At once, the > chosen Nymphs swore justice by their streams, and sat in judgment on their > thrones of rock. At once, although the lot had not been cast, the leading > sister hastened to begin.\u2014She chanted of celestial wars; she gave the Giants > false renown; she gave the Gods small credit for great deeds.\u2014She droned > out, `Forth, those deepest realms of earth, Typhoeus came, and filled the > Gods with fear. They turned their backs in flight to Egypt; and the wearied > rout, where Great Nile spreads his seven-channeled mouth, were there > received. \u2013 Thither the earth-begot Typhoeus hastened: but the Gods of > Heaven deceptive shapes assumed.\u2014Lo, Jupiter (Zeus as Libyan Ammon's crooked > horns attest) was hidden in the leader of a flock; Apollo in a crow; Bacchus > in a goat; Diana (Artemis) in a cat; Venus (Aphrodite) in a fish; Saturnian > Juno (Hera) in a snow-white cow; Cyllenian Hermes in an Ibis' wings. Urania and Athena continued their conversation about the great match: > Such stuff she droned out from her noisy mouth: and then they summoned us; > but, haply, time permits thee not, nor leisure thee permits, that thou > shouldst hearken to our melodies.\u201d \"Nay doubt it not,\u201d quoth Pallas > (Athena), \u201cbut relate your melodies in order.\u201d And she sat beneath the > pleasant shadows of the grove. And thus again Urania; \u201cOn our side we > trusted all to one.\u201d Which having said, Calliope, mother of Orpheus of > Leivithra, arose. Her glorious hair was bound with ivy. She attuned the > chords, and chanted as she struck the sounding strings: Calliope sang many stories from myths during the contest with the Pierides. The Muse recounted the abduction of Persephone by god of underworld, Hades and the sorrow of the young girl's mother, the goddess Demeter for the loss of her beloved daughter. Calliope also told the account of the unrequited love of the river god Alpheus to the nymph Arethusa and also the adventure of hero Triptolemus in Scythia where he encountered the envious King Lyncus. The following lines described the punishment of the victorious Muses to their vanquished opponents, the Pierides, being transformed into birds:Ovid, Metamorphoses, 5.662 > \"The greatest of our number ended thus her learned songs; and with > concordant voice the chosen Nymphs adjudged the Deities, on Helicon who > dwell, should be proclaimed the victors. But the vanquished nine began to > scatter their abuse; to whom rejoined the goddess; `Since it seems a > trifling thing that you should suffer a deserved defeat, and you must add > unmerited abuse to heighten your offence, and since by this appears the end > of our endurance, we shall certainly proceed to punish you according to the > limit of our wrath.\u2019 But these Emathian sisters laughed to scorn our > threatening words; and as they tried to speak, and made great clamour, and > with shameless hands made threatening gestures, suddenly stiff quills > sprouted from out their finger-nails, and plumes spread over their stretched > arms; and they could see the mouth of each companion growing out into a > rigid beak.\u2014And thus new birds were added to the forest.\u2014While they made > complaint, these jays that defile our groves, moving their stretched-out > arms, began to float, suspended in the air. And since that time their > ancient eloquence, their screaming notes, their tiresome zeal of speech have > all remained.\" Pierides Changed into Magpies by Richard van Orle (1683-1732) at Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent, Belgium === Antoninus' Account === Another retelling of the contest of Pierides and Muses appeared in Antoninus Liberalis' Metamorphoses:Nicander tells this tale in his fourth book of his Heteroeumena (\"Metamorphoses\"). > Zeus made love to Mnemosyne in Pieria and became father of the Muses. Around > about that time Pierus, was king of Emathia, sprung from its very soil. He > had nine daughters. They were the ones who formed a choir in opposition to > the Muses. And there was a musical contest in Helicon. > Whenever the daughters of Pierus began to sing, all creation went dark and > no one would give an ear to their choral performance. But when the Muses > sang, heaven, the stars, the sea and rivers stood still, while Mount > Helicon, beguiled by the pleasure of it all, swelled skywards tilI, by the > will of Poseidon, Pegasus checked it by striking the summit with his hoof. > Since these mortals had taken upon themselves to strive with goddesses, the > Muses changed them into nine birds. To this day people refer to them as the > grebe, the wryneck, the ortolan, the jay, the greenfinch, the goldfinch, the > duck, the woodpecker and the dracontis pigeon. == References == == Sources == * Ovid.
