    "text": "Reuben College is a new constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. The plans for the new graduate college, preliminarily named Parks College, were announced in December 2018. It is the first new Oxbridge college since 1990, when the graduate Kellogg College was established. It will be located in the Science Area on the historic Radcliffe Science Library site. ==History== The establishment of Parks College was approved by a vote in the university congregation on 7 May 2019. On 11 June 2020, the University announced that it had received an \u00a380 million gift from the Reuben Foundation towards an endowment and scholarships, which would be marked by changing the name of the college to Reuben College. The college was formally renamed on 30 June 2020. The planned initial intake of graduate students is in the 2021\u20132022 academic year with an eventual annual intake of 200 students, studying for research degrees and on taught courses. Initially there will be a focus on three interdisciplinary research clusters, which will be increased to six or eight clusters once there is a full complement of graduate students. Professor Lionel Tarassenko (head of the Department of Engineering Science) was invited by the Vice-Chancellor, Louise Richardson, to oversee the development of the college as its founding president. The college appointed its first fellows in 2019, including Jane A. McKeating and E. J. Milner-Gulland. == Buildings == The current Radcliffe Science Library (RSL) building is located next to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and consists of three parts: * The Jackson Wing, parallel to South Parks Road, is Grade II listed. Designed by Sir Thomas Jackson it opened in 1901. It is arranged over 3 floors, all above ground. * The Worthington Wing, parallel to Parks Road, was designed as an extension to the Jackson Wing in 1934 by Hubert Worthington. The wing extends to the north of the western end of the Jackson Wing and contains the entrance hall on the ground floor. * The Lankester Room and Main Stack, a two-storey extension under the lawn of the museum, built between 1972 and 1975. Reuben College will also consist of the western wing of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory and Abbot\u2019s Kitchen. Completion of the redevelopment of the RSL building is scheduled for the start of the 2021\u20132022 academic year. Completion of the redevelopment of the western wing of the Inorganic Chemistry Lab (the potential space for the dining hall), Abbot\u2019s Kitchen and connecting spaces is scheduled for the start of the 2022\u20132023 academic year. Student accommodation will be offered in the newly refurbished building at Farndon Court. ==Academic focus== The college has identified three key areas of knowledge which will be the focus of its research: *Artificial intelligence and machine learning *Environmental change *Cellular life. ==Administration== Together with Kellogg and St Cross, Reuben is one of only three Oxford colleges without a royal charter. It is officially a society of the university rather than an independent college. The main difference from an independent college is that the governing body only recommends a president, who is then appointed by Council; in other colleges, the head of house is elected and appointed by the governing body directly. For accounting purposes, the societies are considered departments of the university. ==References== ==External links== * Reuben College website Category:Colleges of the University of Oxford Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Oxford Category:Grade II listed buildings in Oxford Category:Grade II listed educational buildings Category:Proposals in the United Kingdom Category:Educational institutions established in 2019 Category:2019 establishments in England ",
