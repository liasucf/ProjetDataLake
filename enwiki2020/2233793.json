    "text": "Smilin' Buddha Cabaret is an album by Canadian rock band 54-40. The album is named after a live music club in Vancouver, British Columbia, the band's hometown. The singles released from the album were \"Blame Your Parents\", \"Assoholic\", \"Ocean Pearl\" and \"Radio Luv Song\". The Smilin' Buddha Cabaret was a Vancouver \"Supper Club\", originally called the \"Smilin' Buddha Dine and Dance\". It opened in 1953 by Albert Kwan. Its iconic neon sign, now found at the Museum of Vancouver, was a city landmark, and one of the most ornate pieces of neon signwork ever made in Vancouver. \"The Buddha\" or \"Smileys\" (just a few of many nicknames for the place) had a licence which allowed it to operate an hour later than other bars. Although many great musicians played its small stage from the 1950s to the 1990s, it was more simply known as a place for touring and local musicians to congregate. The venue closed for good in 1993, serving its last 16\u201317 years as Vancouver's epicentre of punk rock. ==Track listing== # \"Blame Your Parents\" \u2013 4:26 # \"Radio Luv Song\" \u2013 2:08 # \"Assoholic\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Daisy\" \u2013 2:17 # \"Once a Killer\" \u2013 3:46 # \"Punk Grass\" \u2013 2:35 # \"Lucy\" \u2013 3:04 # \"Beyond the Outsider\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Don't Listen to That\" \u2013 2:27 # \"Ocean Pearl\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Higher\" \u2013 2:32 # \"Friends End\" \u2013 4:06 # \"What Buddy Was\" \u2013 4:24 # \"Save Yourself\" \u2013 4:05 ==References== Category:1994 albums Category:54-40 albums ",
