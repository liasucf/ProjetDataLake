    "text": "Senegal competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. The country's appearance marked the second time it had competed at a Winter Olympics. This was the first time the country has entered more than a single athlete, with skiers Lamine Gu\u00e8ye and Alphonse Gomis both taking part. The lack of support staff meant that Gu\u00e8ye sought medical assistance from another team. Neither competitors won a medal, and Gomis was noted by the media for the number of falls he had on the slopes. ==Background== Senegal made their Winter Olympic debut at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. This followed a campaign by alpine skier Lamine Gu\u00e8ye, who as a teenager, had also founded the country's ski federation. At those Games, Gu\u00e8ye had become the first black African to compete at the Winter Olympics. Following the Sarajevo Games, Gu\u00e8ye retired temporarily from competing professionally and instead took up employment as a model and an actor, in addition to earning a living in the finance sector. Upon viewing the performance of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Gu\u00e8ye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying \"I have to tell the people what snow is, what skis are, I have to tell them what big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things.\" Joining Gu\u00e8ye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Gu\u00e8ye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Gu\u00e8ye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him. == Alpine skiing== Both the members of the Senegalese team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Lamine Gu\u00e8ye and Alphonse Gomis, took part in the same skiing events; the men's downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, slalom and the combined competition. The first event to take place was the downhill, on 9 February. This consisted of a single run each; Gu\u00e8ye finished in last position with a time of 2:12.84, over 22 seconds behind Patrick Ortlieb of Austria who took the gold medal. Gomis was one of nine skiers who failed to complete their run, the first of several incomplete runs by the ski instructor during the course of the Games. This would later be referred to by The Washington Post as a \"world-class agony-of-defeat spill\". His performances were referenced by The Record as \"Gomis was the one you may have seen on the highlights, doing unplanned cartwheels, nosedives, and slides down the hill\". Over the next two days, the combined event took place. Neither skier from Senegal finished their runs. The Super-G competition took place on 16 February, with an improved standing for Gu\u00e8ye, who finished 78th out of the 93 skiers who completed the course with a time of 1:29.18. Gomis did not finish. The giant slalom was next, on 18 February, and was the only event in which both skiers completed the course. Gu\u00e8ye recorded a time of 2:44.98 in 66th place, while Gomis completed the run in 74th place with a time of 2:48.08. Both were some distance behind the winner, Alberto Tomba of Italy who had a time of 2:06.98. The duo's final event was the slalom, on 22 February. Both were among the 52 skiers who failed to complete their runs in the competition. The 1992 Winter Olympics were the last Winter Games to be run before the introduction of more strenuous qualification standards. This meant that at the 1994 Winter Olympics, Senegal was unable to field a second skier, and Gu\u00e8ye would be limited to competing in a single event. ;Key *N/A = Round not applicable for the event ;Skiing events {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Run 1 (DH) !colspan=\"2\"|Run 2 (Sl) !colspan=\"2\"|Run 3 (Sl) !colspan=\"3\"|Final/Total |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Diff !Rank |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" rowspan=5|Alphonse Gomis |align=\"left\" |Downhill |colspan=6 |colspan=3|Did not finish |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Super-G |colspan=6 |colspan=3|Did not finish |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Giant slalom |1:24.29 |89 |1:23.79 |74 |colspan=2 |2:48.08 | +41.10 |74 |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Slalom |colspan=4|Did not finish |colspan=2 |colspan=3|Did not finish |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Combined |2:00.56 |57 |colspan=7|Did not finish |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" rowspan=5|Lamine Gu\u00e8ye |align=\"left\" |Downhill |colspan=6 |2:12.84 | +22.47 |45 |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Super-G |colspan=6 |1:29.18 | +16.14 |78 |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Giant slalom |1:21.60 |77 |1:23.38 |71 |colspan=2 |2:44.98 | +38.00 |66 |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Slalom |1:10.90 |60 |colspan=2|Did not finish |colspan=2 |colspan=3|Did not finish |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" |Combined |2:00.38 |58 |colspan=7|Did not finish |} ==References== Category:Nations at the 1992 Winter Olympics 1992 Winter Olympics Winter Olympics ",
