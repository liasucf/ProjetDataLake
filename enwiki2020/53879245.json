    "text": "John \"Jackie\" Carney (1906 - November 1984) was an Irish Gaelic footballer and trainer. His league and championship career with the Mayo senior team spanned ten years from 1931 to 1941. Carney made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Mayo senior team during the 1930\u201331 league. After being dropped from the team the following year he was recalled in 1933 after winning an All-Ireland medal with the Mayo junior team. Over the course of the next eight seasons, Carney won one All-Ireland medals as left wing-forward on the team in 1936. He also won five Connacht medals and seven National Football League medals. He played his last game for Mayo in June 1941. As a regular member of the Connacht inter-provincial team, Carney won a total of four Railway Cup medals. Carney was appointed co-trainer of the Mayo senior team along with Gerald Courell in 1948. His tenure in charge saw the team win back- to-back All-Ireland titles in 1950 and 1951. Carney's nephew, Martin Carney, had a lengthy inter-county career with Donegal and Mayo. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|National League !colspan=\"2\"|Connacht !colspan=\"2\"|All-Ireland !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score |- |rowspan=\"11\"|Mayo |1930-31 |rowspan=\"11\"|Division 1 |1||0-00||0||0-00||1||0-00||2||0-00 |- |1931-32 |0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00 |- |1932-33 |0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00 |- |1933-34 |6||0-04||2||0-07||0||0-00||8||0-11 |- |1934-35 |8||2-03||2||0-00||1||0-00||11||2-03 |- |1935-36 |7||2-05||2||0-00||2||1-00||11||3-05 |- |1936-37 |8||4-04||1||0-02||1||0-02||10||4-08 |- |1937-38 |7||1-06||1||0-00||0||0-00||8||1-06 |- |1938-39 |7||3-01||2||0-00||2||0-01||11||3-02 |- |1939-40 |0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00||0||0-00 |- |1940-41 |2||0-02||1||0-01||0||0-00||3||0-03 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total |46||12-25||11||0-10||7||1-03||64||13-38 |} ==Honours== ;Mayo *All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (1): 1936 (c) *Connacht Senior Football Championship (5): 1931, 1935, 1936 (c), 1937, 1939 *National Football League (7): 1933-34, 1934-35, 1935-36 (c), 1936-37, 1937-38, 1938-39, 1940-41 *All- Ireland Junior Football Championship (1): 1933 *Connacht Junior Football Championship (5): 1933 ;Connacht *Railway Cup (4): 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938 ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Ballina Stephenites Gaelic footballers Category:Mayo inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Connacht inter-provincial Gaelic footballers Category:Winners of one All-Ireland medal (Gaelic football) Category:People from Ballina, County Mayo ",
