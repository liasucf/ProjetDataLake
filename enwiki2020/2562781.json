It was completed in 1637 as the second of the Lascaris towers. The tower is in good condition. ==History== View of the tower G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a Tower was built in 1637 on the cliffs overlooking G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a Bay close to Mellie\u0127a and M\u0121arr on the northwest coast of Malta. The tower has Lippija and Nadur Towers in its line of sight. The tower was designed by the Italian architect Vincenzo Maculani. It is almost identical to Lippija Tower, having a square plan and two floors topped by a flat roof with a parapet. Each floor has a single room, and access to the upper floor was originally by a wooden ladder. G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a Tower was built on the site of a medieval watchpost. It was originally armed with a \u00bd-pounder gun, and its garrison consisted of a captain and three men, who were paid by the Universit\u00e0 of Mdina. ==Present day== The tower overlooking G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a The tower was in poor condition until it was restored in 2000 with the support of the Director of Public Projects and Din l-Art \u0126elwa. In 2012, vandals sprayed graffiti on two sides of the tower. This has been removed. The tower continued to be renovated by the Gaia Foundation, and it opened to the public in 2013 as part of a peace grove containing over 20 species of indigenous plants. The tower is threatened by coastal erosion, and cracks can be seen on the cliffs upon which the tower is built. The terrain may be dangerous for risky walkers, when next to the cliffs, with some people having lost their life due to falls. Some incidents are investigated as it may potentially be used for voluntarily suicides. ==References== ==External links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Lascaris towers Category:Towers completed in 1637 Category:M\u0121arr Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:1637 establishments in Malta ",
