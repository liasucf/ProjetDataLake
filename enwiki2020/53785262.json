    "text": "Ronald Pennell is a British artist, engraver and sculptor. ==Early life== Pennell was born and grew up in Birmingham. He received early training at the Moseley School of Art, and subsequently at Birmingham School of Art (1952\u20131956) was a pupil of Cyril Shiner. ==Gem engraving== In 1957 Pennell received a German scholarship to study gem engraving. Working under the gem- engraver Hermann Waldmann in Idar-Oberstein, Pennell began a long association with German and central European art and education. He later developed a personal friendship and professional relationship with the Czech glass engraver Jiri Harcuba, as well as with teachers and students at the Prague Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design.Sylva Petrova, The relationship of Ronald Pennell to the history and current state of Central European thinking and culture, in Modern Myths: The art of Ronald Pennell in glass and bronze, Antique Collectors\u2019 Club, 1999 On his return to England Pennell was appointed lecturer at Birmingham College of Art where he met his wife, Betty, and taught metal engraving, drawing and design. In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Pennell continued to maintain contacts in Germany, entering exhibition and design competitions.Gesellschaft fur Goldschmeidekunst, Hamburg, 1961 In 1964, he and Betty left teaching to establish freelance studios in rural Herefordshire. Concentrating on developing his range, including bronze medallic art, Pennell refrained from exhibiting his work until 1974, when he was offered a solo showCrafts Council of Great Britain.

Initially working with commercially available glass vessels, he later transferred to working on vessel blanks, free-blown to his specification by the glass artist Carl Nordbruch. In addition to working on clear, colourless glass, Pennell broadened his approach to include cased, flashed and graal glasses. In 1979, he exhibited at the Corning Museum World Glass Exhibition and World Tour, which brought his work to international attention. He was also represented in the Corning Museum New Glass Review throughout the 1980s. His work displays a complex, humorous iconography, in which an everyman figure (often represented by the artist, watched over by his Jack Russell terrier) engages with forces of nature which may be agrarian, or embodied in the forms of crocodiles, owls, women and mythical beings. ==Sculpture== Pennell also works as a sculptor, producing medals and reliefs in cast bronze,Mark Jones, The Medallic Art of Ronald Pennell, in Modern Myths: The Art of Ronald Pennell in Glass and Bronze, Antique Collectors Club, 1999 examples of which are in the collections of the British MuseumP Attwood, 'Acquisitions of medals (1983-1987)', British Museum Occasional Paper 78, London, 1991 and Goldsmiths' Hall in London. A group of larger scale animal sculptures in stained wood date mainly from the 1990s. He created a new series of figurative sculpture in cast glass following his professorship at the University of Wolverhampton. ==Exhibitions and collections== Since 1974, Pennell has exhibited in Britain, Europe, the United States and Japan, including regular exhibitions this century in London and internationally with Contemporary Applied Arts. In 1999 a comprehensive retrospective exhibition of his work, Modern Myths: The Art of Ronald Pennell in Glass and Bronze organised by Wolverhampton Art Gallery toured the UK.Modern Myths: The art of Ronald Pennell in glass and bronze, Antique Collectors\u2019 Club, 1999 In 2013 he and Betty held a joint exhibition, Gardens \u2013 Myths \u2013 Magic, at the Ruthin Craft Centre.Gardens \u2013 Myths \u2013 Magic: Betty Pennell \u2013 Ronald Pennell, Ruthin Craft Centre, The Centre for the Applied Arts, Ruthin, Denbighshire.
