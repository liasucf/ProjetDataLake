    "text": "Alash (1917\u20131920) was a constitutional democratic party, and a liberation movement, in the Alash Autonomy on the territory of the present-day Kazakhstan and Russia. They advocated for equal treatment between Kazakhs and Russians and the cessation of Russian settlement on the Kazakh lands. It was notably the first modern organized political Kazakh elite group. Alash party attempted to reinforce Kazakh identity rather than embracing Russian identities. Western secularism and ties to the Muslim world were the major dividing issues among the party intelligentsia and the Kazakh elites, through the Russian Civil War. Chairman of the party, and president of the Alash Autonomy was Alikhan Bokeikhanov. Prior to the formation of Alash party, he and other notable members of the party were members of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party. Alash party ceased to exist in August 26, 1920, after the Bolsheviks defeated White Army that was occupying territory of the Alash Autonomy, and formed Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic. == See also == *Akhmet Baitursynov *Alash Orda *Basmachi movement *Ismail Gasprinski *Jadid *Pan- Turkism ==References== Category:Defunct political parties in Kazakhstan Category:History of Kazakhstan Category:Political parties of the Russian Revolution Category:Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Category:Anti-communist organizations ",
