    "text": "Op zoek naar Zorro (Looking for Zorro) is a Dutch television talent series broadcast on AVRO from late 2010 until early 2011. It documented the search for a new, undiscovered musical theatre performer to play the role of Zorro in the then-forthcoming stage production of Zorro, the musical with book written by Stephen Clark and Helen Edmundson and music by the Gipsy Kings and John Cameron. Produced by Eyeworks for the AVRO, the series was be hosted by Frits Sissing and judged by Willem Nijholt. The series follows previous collaborations between the AVRO and Willem Nijholt to find new musical theatre performers: Op zoek naar Evita which was won by Brigitte Heitzer, Op zoek naar Joseph which was won by Freek Bartels and Op zoek naar Mary Poppins which was won by Noortje Herlaar. ==Auditions== Applications for the series from those from 20 to 35 were solicited in March 2010 all over the Netherlands. ==Finalists== Eleven potential Zorros made it through the audition rounds and will perform during the live shows starting from 1 January 2011 but this time, the live shows will be shifted from Sunday to Saturday nights. The final will be broadcast on 19 February 2011. Each potential Zorro wore a black jacket and a sash of a certain colour, which made identification easier. At the end of every live show, the losing Zorro would have his jacket and sash stripped by the Zorro who survived the sing off, then takes the lead song of the farewell song: Slotlied The eventual winner, Tommie Christiaan, had previously initially made it to the finals in Op zoek naar Joseph in 2008, but had dropped out when he had been offered a lead role in High School Musical. Fourth-placed Dennis de Groot was offered a part in the ensemble in Zorro when he was eliminated, which he accepted. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Finalist ! Age & Date of Birth * ! Sash colour !
