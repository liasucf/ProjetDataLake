It is along the Egypt/Libyan brief east coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the northwest corner of Egypt. It is, geodesically, east of the border with Libya, and from the notable port of Tobruk, Libya. Sallum is mainly a Bedouin community of the families of merchants, fishermen and herdsmen. It has little tourist activity and few organized historical curiosities. It is a key trading center of the community. It has a World War II Commonwealth war cemetery and is north of Halfaya Pass. Its own pass, improved since World War II has become the main pass ascending the related ridge, obstructive to east- west trade. The ridge extends away from its northern part, east-facing sea cliffs, south by , there encroaching increasingly east. This escarpment is the Akabah el-Kebir, once called the Akabah el Sallum, such as in the 12th century - a descriptor meaning graded (evened out) as to this ascent, then making the name of the town. It has no other roadworthy passes. Sallum was a small ancient Roman port. Some Roman wells remain locally. Sometimes called Baranis, it should not be confused with the medieval-noted branch of the Berbers, the al-Baranis. Its southern end scattered homes mark out the end of the Northern coast of Egypt. Amenities include a post office and a National Bank of Egypt branch. == History == Wider context, broad reach of the Ottoman Empire such as in 1795, highlighting the local province ===Early settlement=== Local people are mentioned in some Roman accounts of Catabathmus Maior/Magnus (referring to the local, obstructive ridge to east-west land trade, Akabah el Solum, or more commonly today el-Kebir, the great). It may have been Plynos Limen and Tetrapyrgia mentioned in less context-clear early courses. ===Sovereignty and battles=== Sallum was part of the Eyalet then Vilayet of Tripolitania, 1551-1911, the year before its fall mainly to Italy. That year, during the Italo-Turkish War, an Anglo-Egyptian force took it over, alleviating its garrison, to prevent its falling into Italian hands. When the border between Italian Libya and Egypt was settled by treaty in 1925, Sallum was left on the Egyptian side.Anna Baldinetti, The Origins of the Libyan Nation: Colonial Legacy, Exile and the Emergence of a New Nation-State (Routledge, 2010), p. 2. During the Senussi Campaign of the First World War, Sallum was captured by the Senussi in November 1915 with Ottoman and German assistance. It was re-taken by the British in March 1916.John Slight (2014), \"British Understandings of the Sanussiyya Sufi Order\u2019s Jihad against Egypt, 1915\u201317\", The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs, 103(2) pp. 233\u2013242. In December 1941, during Operation Crusader in World War II (and the two other operations affecting nearby Halfaya Pass Sallum hosted fighting between the British Empire associated allied Commonwealth forces and Nazi Germany who were retreating from gains they had made deeper into Egypt. On July 21, 1977, Libya attacked Sallum, starting the Libyan-Egyptian War. ===Solar eclipse=== Sallum was a destination in the total solar eclipse on March 29, 2006 among expeditions.\"Valoria La Buena annular eclipse expedition\" (report), Solar Physics Group, Astrophysics Lab, University of Rome, January 10, 2007, webpage (mostly Italian): ICRA-solar: mentions Sidi Barrani observation area. == Climate == K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt, but typically as the northern coast of Egypt, has its temperatures moderated by blowing winds from the Mediterranean Sea. == See also == * Halfaya Pass * Military history of Italy during World War II * Military history of Egypt during World War II * Libyan\u2013Egyptian War ==Notes== == External links == * Photograph of twilight Sidi Barrani solar eclipse (Oct. 2005, copyright 2005-2007 Magyar Csillag\u00e1szati Egyes\u00fclet): Hungarian-foto Sidi-twilight (540x345, 38 KB). * Photograph of solar eclipse at Sidi Barrani (Oct. 2005, copyright 2005-2007 Magyar Csillag\u00e1szati Egyes\u00fclet): Hungarian-foto Sidi-eclipse (9 kb). * Photograph of Sidi Barrani observers (Oct. 2005, copyright 2005-2007 Magyar Csillag\u00e1szati Egyes\u00fclet): Hungarian-foto Sidi-people (50 kb).
