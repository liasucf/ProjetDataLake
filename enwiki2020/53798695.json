Following her sophomore campaign, Jones announced that she intended to transfer from Duke to be closer to home. Ultimately, Jones decided to transfer to Baylor University. ===Baylor University=== Due to the NCAA Transfer Rules, Jones sat out the 2014-2015 season for the Baylor Bears. This gave her time to recover from her ACL surgery that she had from her sophomore season. During her junior season, Jones made her Baylor debut against UT-Arlington, where she recorded 15 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 steals. Her impact was felt right away at Baylor.

Jones had gotten a bruised knee that caused her to miss time towards the end of the season. She was able to make it back in time for the NCAA Tournament. Despite the injury, Jones was named to the First Team All-Big 12 Team, which she received unanimously. ==College statistics== Source {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Team !GP !Points !FG% !3P% !FT% !RPG !APG !SPG !BPG !PPG |- |2012-13 |Duke |36 |342 |42.8 |34.2 |79.5 |4.4 |4.0 |1.8 |0.3 |9.5 |- |2013-14 |Duke |28 |366 |47.2 |38.8 |78.8 |4.1 |5.3 |2.1 |0.1 |13.1 |- |2015-16 |Baylor |38 |570 |43.5 |41.2 |76.4 |4.2 |4.4 |2.0 |0.0 |15.0 |- |2016-17 |Baylor |30 |397 |41.6 |41.1 |72.2 |4.7 |4.8 |1.2 |0.3 |13.2 |- |Career |Duke |64 |708 |45.0 |36.9 |79.2 |4.3 |4.6 |1.9 |0.2 |11.1 |- |Career |Baylor |68 |967 |42.6 |41.1 |75.1 |4.4 |4.6 |1.2 |0.1 |14.2 |} ==Professional career== Jones in 2018 ===WNBA=== ====Minnesota Lynx==== Jones was selected 12th overall in the 2017 WNBA Draft by the Minnesota Lynx.
