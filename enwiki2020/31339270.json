MacPherson started his career at Footscray in 1982, the same year that younger brother Stephen made his debut for the club. A utility, he kicked a goal in each of his first three league appearances and finished the year with seven games.AFL Tables: Rod MacPherson The Tasmanian would never play more than 11 games in a single season at Footscray but played some good football in 1986 to average 19 disposals. He badly injured his anterior cruciate ligament during a reserves final in 1986 and opted to have the ligament replaced with artificial fibre. When he returned to action in 1987 it was at a new club, Brisbane, with whom he would play seven games that year. It would be his last season in the VFL, as his leg became infected and he again needed surgery on his knee.Herald Sun, \"Knee Victims Say Nick Has Made Big Mistake\", 16 March 2008, Emma Quayle From 2000 to 2004, MacPherson was coach of the Bendigo Pioneers in the TAC Cup. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Tasmania Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Brisbane Bears players Category:Clarence Football Club players Category:Living people ",
