    "text": "Charles Honor\u00e9 Berthelot La Villeheurnois (c. 1750, Toulon - 10 July 1799, Sinnamary, Guyana) was a French politician. He was ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates to Louis XVI and with Charles Brottier and Thomas Laurent Madeleine Duverne de Presle was one of the heads of the plot called the \"camp de Grenelle\". Thinking they could count on generals Malo and Jean-Pierre Ramel, who had crushed the Conspiracy of Equals, they envisaged taking the troops under their orders (stationed at Grenelle camp), leading them against the Directors and re-establishing the monarchy. In fact the two generals warned the Directory of the conspirators' approaches and all three conspirators were arrested before they could do anything. Condemned to only a year in prison, Charles Honor\u00e9 de La Villeheurnois was deported after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797), and died in Guyana.
