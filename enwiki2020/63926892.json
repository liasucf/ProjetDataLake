He referred to ibn Taymiyyah as \"our sheikh.\" Most of his scholarship deals with Islamic legal theory and theology. His writings did not attract a large following of Hanbalis, though his Mukhtasar al-Rawdah has been commented upon up to the 16th century. He is known for his writings on ma\u1e63la\u1e25a, in that averting harm is a general obligation which can only be set aside by a specific legal ruling, such as the hudud punishments. His theory on ma\u1e63la\u1e25a later influenced Islamic Modernism. == Life == At-T\u016bf\u012b received his first upbringing in his birthplace and traveled to Baghdad in 1282, where he studied Arabic grammar, fiqh, hadith, and logic. After a one-year stay in Damascus in 704 AH, where he used to attend the classes of Ibn Taymiyya and al-Mizz\u012b, he moved to Cairo in 1305, where he continued his training with various scholars and as a tutor (mu\u02bf\u012bd) at Mans\u016br\u012bya and N\u0101sir\u012bya. In 1311 CE he was imprisoned in Cairo for a few days for accusations of Shia leanings and then banished from the city. After a stopover in Damietta went to the city of Qus in Upper Egypt, where he worked through the libraries and wrote his own books. In 1315 he undertook the Hajj, after which he stayed in Mecca for another year. In 1316 he traveled to Palestine, where he died in the city of Hebron. === Accusations of Shi'a Leanings === There is some scholarly debate on at-T\u016bf\u012b's biography about his possible inclination for the Shi'a. During his stay in Mecca he was in active contact with the Imamite scholar as-Sak\u0101k\u012bn\u012b. In Cairo, he was accused of representing Shi'a positions and insulting the Prophet's companions. Al-Safadi (d.764/1362) reports that he renounced his associations with Shi'ism,Al- \u015eafad\u012b, \u015eala\u0125 al-D\u012bn (2000) \u2018al-W\u0101f\u012b bi al-Wafay\u0101t\u2019, Beirut: D\u0101r I\u0125y\u0101\u2019 al- Tur\u0101th, Ed. A\u0125mad al-Arna\u2019\u016b\u0163 and Turk\u012b Mu\u015f\u0163aph\u0101, (29 vol) 19/43 however Ibn Rajab (d.795/1393) believed this renunciation was a form of taqiyya, accusing him of lying.Ibn Rajab, Zayn al-D\u012bn (2005) \u2018Dhayl \u021aabaq\u0101t al-\u0124an\u0101bilah\u2019, Riyadh: Maktabat al-\u2018Ubayk\u0101n, Ed. \u2018Abd al-Ra\u0125m\u0101n al-\u2018Uthaym\u012bn, (5 vol) 4/404-421 Mustafa Zayd refutes this and quotes al-Tufi criticizing Shi'a doctrines and states that al-Tufi is not cited in any Shi'a biographies of scholars.Zayd, Mustaf\u0101 (1954) al-Ma\u015fla\u0125ah f\u012b al-Tashr\u012b\u2019 al-Isl\u0101m\u012b, Egypt: D\u0101r al-Yusr, p.59-70 Muhammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti argues otherwise and adds that al-Tufi's criticism of Shi'ism shows his volatile character.Al-But\u012b, Rama\u0111\u0101n Sa\u2019\u012bd (2007) \u2018\u0110aw\u0101bi\u0163 al-Ma\u015fla\u0125ah f\u012b al-Shar\u012b\u2019at al-Isl\u0101miyyah\u2019, Damascus: D\u0101r al-Fikr, p.217-219 == Ma\u1e63la\u1e25a == His most complete writings on maslaha are in his commentary on imam Nawawi's (d. 1277 CE) collection of 40 hadith, where he comments on the 32nd hadith, la darar wa la diraar. He states that this means to inflict harm (mafsada) upon someone else and to inflict harm in requital, therefore neither harm nor requital should be inflicted upon someone. He supports this hadith with verses from the Qur'an and other hadith that Allah does not intend to burden the believers, but gave us Islam for benefit and maslaha. In his opinion, this hadith has priority over all of the Shari'a except where punishment is stipulated, such as in the hudud, because they are stated to be obligatory in the revelation and are of stronger basis than the general statement of \"there is no harm or requital of harm.\" He states that, by ijma, the harm caused by these punishments is permissible. Therefore averting harm is a general obligation which can only be superseded by a specific legal injunction. al-Tufi states in his theory of ma\u1e63la\u1e25a that it can only apply to muamalat (social dealings) and \u0101d\u0101t (customs and habits) and not ibadat (worship) and muqaddar\u0101t (fixed stipulations), because acts of worship can only be known via revelation whereas our minds can be applied to social dealings. He stated that if the Qur'an, hadith, and ijma contradict the maslaha, then the maslaha would take precedence. A major issue with his theory is that he was unable to provide any practical examples of applying his theory in his era, whereas imam al-Ghazali was able to provide clear examples of when it can override a text and where it cannot. This is one major reason that scholars like al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, al-Qar\u0101f\u012b and al-Sh\u0101\u1e6dib\u012b had far more influential theories of ma\u1e63la\u1e25a than al-Tufi. It also appears that al-Tufi was influenced by the writings of imam al-Qar\u0101f\u012b, as he seems to exactly quote from him in citing the nineteen evidences of Islamic law.Al-Qar\u0101f\u012b, Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn (1973) \u2018Shar\u0125 Tanq\u012b\u0125 al-Fu\u015f\u016bl\u2019, Egypt: Shirkat al-\u021aab\u0101\u2019at al-Funniyyat al-Mutta\u0125idah, Ed. \u2018Abd al-Ra\u2019\u016bf S\u2019ad, p.445 === Islamic Modernism === His interpretation of maslaha did not take hold until the early 20th century when Jamal ad-Din al- Qasimi (1866-1914 CE) and Rashid Rida (1865-1935 CE) revived his concept of maslaha in the Islamic magazine al-Manar to counter secular reformers. Al- Tufi's theory of maslaha was appealing to reformers as it opened the door for them to \"update\" the Shari'a in a dynamic world. At that time, Islamic law was being displaced by Western models of jurisprudence after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and creation of modern nation states in the Middle East and North Africa. Most of these new nation states created legal codes based on European law, such as French and British law. In the 1950s, for example, Egypt and Tunisia abolished their Shari'a courts and turned to secular law. These modernists wanted to \"modernize\" Islam partly as a response to European influence and to \"catch up\" with the West, where Islamic scholars were seen as an obstacle to modernization and advancement. This theory of maslaha provided the avenue for keeping the Shari'a and Islamic scholars relevant in their changing world, by using an \"interal\" theory rather than something perceived as foreign. Tufi's theory helped Rashid Rida prove that the Shari'a is not antithetical to reason and served Rida's desire to use maslaha to derive rulings, as it was easier to just use maslaha instead of going through the traditional processes of usul al-fiqh. Additionally, it helped Rida and al- Qasimi to depart from the traditional Sunni schools of thought and usul al- fiqh, as it freed them from following the fatwas and methodologies of the early scholars (taqlid) and from following a madhhab. Through this they ironically sought to keep Islamic scholars relevant and provide an alternative to the growing European-influenced secular jurisprudence and reforms of the Muslim states at the time. Rida also blamed the weakness of the Muslim world in comparison to Western hegemony and colonialism on ikhtilaf between the schools of thought. By proposing maslaha as a universally accepted legal standard, Rida desired to unite the Muslim world on one school of thought and strengthen them against Western domination. Shortly after, Rida's revival of maslaha was criticized by Al-Kawthar\u012b, al-B\u016b\u1e6d\u012b, and other Islamic scholars. Some scholars likened it to a type of utilitarianism similar to the ideas of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, as he used the fallible human mind to restrict Allah's rulings (ahkam). Wael Hallaq states that al-Tufi's theory was too vague, since he never defined its scope or concept in sufficient detail, and therefore his theory was \"inferior to the average theoretical discourse.\" == Works == Of the more than 50 works that at-T\u016bf\u012b wrote, 19 have been preserved. * Mukhtasar al-Rawdah, an abridgement of Rawdat al-Nazir by Ibn Qudamah * al-Ta'l\u012bq 'al\u0101 al-An\u0101j\u012bl al-arba'a wa-al-ta'l\u012bq 'al\u0101 al-Tawr\u0101h wa-'al\u0101 ghayrih\u0101 min kutub al-anbiy\u0101' (Critical Commentary on the Four Gospels, the Torah and other Books of the Prophets) * Kit\u0101b at-Ta\u02bfy\u012bn f\u012b \u0161ar\u1e25 al-Arba\u02bf\u012bn (\"Book of Specification for Commenting on the Forty\"), commentary on an-Nawaw\u012b's collection of the forty hadiths, which was particularly popular in the 20th century. In this work, at-T\u016bf\u012b, in connection with the commentary on the 32nd hadith \u201cNo harm and no harmful retribution\u201d (l\u0101 \u1e0darar wa-l\u0101 \u1e0dir\u0101r), developed his theory of the \u201ccommon good\u201d (ma\u1e63la\u1e25a), which generally weights more would have to be as text documents from Koran and Sunna. The modern Syrian scholar Jam\u0101l ad-D\u012bn al-Q\u0101sim\u012b (1866\u20131914) published this text separately and provided it with his own explanations.Zaid: al-Ma\u1e63la\u1e25a f\u012b t-ta\u0161r\u012b\u02bf al-isl\u0101m\u012b . 2004, p. 133. Rasch\u012bd Rid\u0101 reprinted the text with the explanations of al-Q\u0101sim\u012bs in his magazine al-Man\u0101r in 1906, thereby making it known to a larger Islamic public. At-T\u016bf\u012b's commentary was only fully edited in 1998 by A\u1e25mad \u1e24\u0101\u01e7\u01e7 Mu\u1e25ammad \u02bfU\u1e6fm\u0101n. * at-Ta\u02bf\u0101l\u012bq \u02bfal\u0101 l-an\u0101\u01e7\u012bl al-arba\u02bfa (\"The Glosses of the Four Gospels\") has been critically edited and translated by Lejla Demiri. * al-\u01e6a\u1e0fal f\u012b \u02bfilm al-\u01e7adal (\"The banner of cheerfulness about the science of dispute \").
