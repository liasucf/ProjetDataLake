GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2019-07-14. ==Events== The number of athletics events on the Jamaican Championship competition programme varies according to demand. Several events almost always feature on the programme for both men and women, including: the three sprint events (100 m, 200 m and 400 m), the two middle-distance events (800 m and 1500 m), two hurdles events (sprint hurdles and 400 m hurdles), two horizontal jumping events (long jump and triple jump) and three throwing events (shot put, discus throw and javelin throw). Beyond these 12 core events, it is common for other national championship events to be skipped due to lack of entrants. These include long- distance events (5000 m and 10,000 m), the pole vault and high jump, and the hammer throw. On rare occasions, national championships events for steeplechase and combined track and field events have taken place. ;Track running *100 metres, 200 metres, 400 metres, 800 metres, 1500 metres, 5000 metres (non-regular), 10,000 metres (non-regular) ;Obstacle events *100 metres hurdles (women only), 110 metres hurdles (men only), 400 metres hurdles ;Jumping events *Pole vault (non-regular), high jump (non-regular), long jump, triple jump ;Throwing events *Shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, hammer throw (non-regular) ==References== Category:Athletics competitions in Jamaica Category:National athletics competitions Athletics ",
