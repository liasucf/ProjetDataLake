Joe discovers a single mother and her young daughter, Jenny and Angelina, living there now. He respects their privacy and sleeps outdoors, unprepared for the frigid night in his thin leather jacket and risking a relapse of his illness. After looking up his pal Billy in an assisted-living center, Joe accepts an offer by Angelina to share the apartment and rent. Leery at first of the little girl, he soon takes a liking to her, and she to him. He also takes an instant dislike to Jenny's boyfriend, an abusive police detective named Buczkowski. In need of money, Joe seeks permission from a local crime figure, Lenny, to move some stolen meat. The scheme goes badly, Joe having great difficulty in carrying a heavy side of lamb by himself, with a hungry dog pursuing him through an alley. Cold, broke and lonely, he has little seemingly to live for, so when Jenny's boyfriend becomes violent again, Joe comes to her rescue, with fatal consequences. ==Cast== *Dennis Farina as Joe May *Jamie Anne Allman as Jenny *Ian Barford as Stanley Buczkowski *Meredith Droeger as Angelina *Chelcie Ross as Billy Tidrow *Gary Cole as Lenny *Matt DeCaro as Chevy *Phil Ridarelli as Landlord *Ernest Perry Jr. as Driver *Mike Bacarella as George *Rich Komenich as Seymour *Craig Bailey as Cab Driver *Roderick Peeples as Butcher Shop Manager *Brian Boland as Scotty ==Release== The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 22, 2011.
