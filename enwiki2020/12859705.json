    "text": "The NMBS/SNCB Class 77 (also known as HLD 77 or HLR 77) is a class of 4 axle B'B' road switcher diesel hydraulic locomotive designed for shunting and freight work manufactured at the beginning of the 2000s by Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik and later by Vossloh at the Maschinenbau Kiel plant in Kiel, Germany for the National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB/NMBS). ==Background and design== The initial order for 90 locomotives was given to Siemens in 1997 to replace an aging diesel fleet; the railway opted for a locomotive suitable for both shunting and mainline use, rather than separate classes. The locomotives were variants of the standard MaK G1200 series design, and are considered a development of the MaK G1205 type. The locomotive is an off-centre cab design with a two-speed voith hydraulic transmission driving all axles via cardan shafts. Auxiliary electrical supply is provided by an engine mounted alternator. Unlike many other MaK locomotives which use a MTU or CAT 12-cylinder V engine the locomotive has an ABC 6-cylinder inline engine. The first locomotive was delivered in October 1999, and worked satisfactorily; a second order for 80 locomotives was given in June 2001. ==Operations== The first locomotive entered service in February 2004. All 170 units were operational by June 2005. Due to its relatively low power the locomotives work in multiple on heavy freight trains. ===Equipment variations === Sets of the class vary in the type of equipment they carry: {|class =\"wikitable\" |- !NMBS/SNCB number !Radio control !Cab Radio !ATB !Notes |- |7701\u20137708 |rowspan=2|Yes |rowspan=4|Yes |rowspan=3|No |7701-7708 Fitted with Automatic coupler for hill shunting; not approved for Netherlands |- |7709\u20137728 |rowspan=2|Approved for limited operations in Netherlands |- |7729\u20137770 |rowspan=4|No |- |7771-7790 |rowspan=1|Yes |Approved for Netherlands and Germany (2004); PZB system |- |7791\u20137865 |No |No |Can operate in Netherlands when in multiple with locos with ATB or radio |- |7866\u20137870 |~ |Yes |Fitted with ATB and PZB in 2008 for work in Germany (Iron Rhine line) |} ==See also== *NS Class 6400 similar concept diesel electric freight locomotives built by MaK/Siemens between 1988 and 1995 for the railways of the Netherlands. ==References== ==External links== * Images: SNCB s\u00e9rie 77, www.rail.lu * Images: Belgian freight diesel class 77, www.railfaneurope.net NMBS/SNCB Class 77 Category:Diesel locomotives of Belgium Category:B-B locomotives Category:Vossloh locomotives Category:MaK locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1990 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Belgium Category:Diesel-hydraulic locomotives ",
