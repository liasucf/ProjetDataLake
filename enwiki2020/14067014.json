You play as the warrior of light, Artemis, shooting down the forces of darkness. The game is divided into different dungeons, which the hero must hack and slash his way through. The game has an overhead vantage point, making it stylistically similar to the dungeon levels in the first Legend of Zelda game. The hero begins with three \"stars\" of energy, which are replenished by collecting hearts. In addition to hearts, diamonds, keys and crescent moons are also collected. Dark Mist uses the Sixaxis controls to perform a spinning attack that blows back enemies and clears the blinding 'dark mist' from your path. Dark Mist has a resolution of 720p and is available for download from the Japanese and European PSN stores. == Depths of Darkness Expansion == On the 28 February 2008 an expansion pack for Dark Mist was released entitled Depths of Darkness.
