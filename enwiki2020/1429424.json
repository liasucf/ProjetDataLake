    "text": "Ricky Ulric Bascombe Shakes (born 25 January 1985) is a professional footballer who plays as a winger for National League club Boreham Wood. He has played in the Football League for Bristol Rovers, Bury, Swindon Town and Brentford. Born in England, Shakes represented the Trinidad and Tobago national football team once in a friendly, and thereafter has represented Guyana internationally. ==Club career== Born in Brixton, Greater London, Shakes began his career at Bolton Wanderers in 2004, and made his debut in an FA Cup third-round replay against Tranmere Rovers in January 2004, scoring a last-minute equaliser to take the match into extra time. He failed to make a league appearance for Bolton, and after spells on loan with Bristol Rovers and Bury, joined Swindon Town in July 2005. Shakes made almost 70 league appearances in two seasons at Swindon but was released at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. He joined Brentford in August 2007 after training with the club during the summer and scored a late goal on his debut in September 2007 to give Brentford victory away to Bury. However, after making 39 league appearances, he was released at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. He joined Conference Premier club Ebbsfleet United in July 2008. In August 2010, it was reported that he was on trial with League Two club Stockport County, before re-signing for Ebbsfleet a few weeks into the season. Having scored 11 goals in 46 matches for Ebbsfleet in the 2010\u201311 season, he added to that statistic by scoring eight goals in 45 appearances for the club during the 2011\u201312 season. On 29 June 2012, Shakes signed for Kidderminster Harriers. Shakes made 18 appearances for Kidderminster in the 2012\u201313 season, helping the club finish second in the Conference Premier. On 3 July 2013, Shakes signed for Conference South club Boreham Wood. Shakes suffered a serious knee injury in pre-season training and was expected to be out for six months. ==International career== Shakes made his international debut in March 2006, coming on as a half-time substitute for Trinidad and Tobago in a 2\u20130 victory against Iceland. In October 2011, Shakes was called up to Guyana for their 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Barbados and Bermuda. Originally, Shakes failed to meet FIFA's age regulations for changing international allegiance, however, Guyana won an appeal in 2010 which allowed him to do so. He made his debut for Guyana in a 2\u20130 away win against Barbados on 7 October 2011, before scoring his first goal four days later in a 1\u20131 draw with Bermuda. Shakes' third international appearance came in the 2\u20131 victory over Trinidad & Tobago on 11 November 2011 which sealed Guyana's qualification to the third round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. In that game, Shakes scored the first goal and created the second for Burnley's Leon Cort, before Kenwyne Jones' consolation for Trinidad & Tobago. Shakes was eligible to play for Trinidad and Tobago through his mother's heritage, and Guyana through his father's birth. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Bolton Wanderers |2003\u201304 |Premier League |0||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- |2004\u201305 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !0||0||1||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0 |- |Bristol Rovers (loan) |2004\u201305 |League Two |1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||2||0 |- |Bury (loan) |2004\u201305 |League Two |7||2||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||7||2 |- |rowspan=3|Swindon Town |2005\u201306 |League One |37||3||2||0||1||0||0||0||40||3 |- |2006\u201307 |League Two |32||2||3||0||1||0||1||0||37||2 |- !colspan=2|Total !69||5||5||0||2||0||1||0||77||5 |- |Brentford |2007\u201308 |League Two |39||3||2||0||0||0||1||1||42||4 |- |rowspan=5|Ebbsfleet United |2008\u201309 |Conference Premier |34||4||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||11||0||47||4 |- |2009\u201310 |Conference Premier |42||4||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||44||4 |- |2010\u201311 |Conference South |34||6||6||2||colspan=2|\u2014||6||3||46||11 |- |2011\u201312 |Conference Premier |41||7||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||1||45||8 |- !colspan=2|Total !151||21||10||2||colspan=2|\u2014||21||4||182||27 |- |Kidderminster Harriers |2012\u201313 |Conference Premier |17||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||18||0 |- |rowspan=8|Boreham Wood |2013\u201314 |Conference South |8||1||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||8||1 |- |2014\u201315 |Conference South |40||9||4||1||colspan=2|\u2014||4||1||48||11 |- |2015\u201316 |National League |45||2||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||48||2 |- |2016\u201317 |National League |29||7||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||0||34||7 |- |2017\u201318 |National League |42||3||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||7||1||51||4 |- |2018\u201319 |National League |46||2||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0||52||2 |- |2019\u201320 |National League |16||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||16||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !226||24||11||1||colspan=2|\u2014||20||2||257||27 |- !colspan=3|Career total !510||55||29||3||3||0||45||7||587||65 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |Trinidad and Tobago |2006||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!1!!0 |- |rowspan=4|Guyana |2011||3||2 |- |2012||7||0 |- |2015||2||1 |- |2016||2||2 |- !colspan=2|Total!!14!!5 |} ===International goals=== :As of match played 4 June 2016.
