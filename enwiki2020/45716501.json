He graduated from Georgetown University and in 1997 earned his doctorate from University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.. Cornell University. == Career == Baptist is a professor of history at Cornell University. His areas of interest are 19th-century United States and especially the history of enslavement in America. Baptist is the author of many articles and books including The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism and the award-winning Creating an Old South. In September 2014, Baptist's work came to prominence when The Economist published a review of The Half Has Never Been Told, criticizing Baptist's thesis that growth in cotton productivity was driven primarily by increasing cruelty. The review sparked widespread outrage for its statement, \"Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy.\" This prompted a rare withdrawal of the article and an apology from the magazine. |publisher=The Economist |title=Our withdrawn review \"Blood cotton\" |accessdate=17 August 2020 |date=4 September 2014}} Baptist wrote a response in Politico magazine in which he states, > Had the Economist actually engaged the book's arguments, the reviewer would > have had to confront the scary fact that the unrestrained domination of > market forces can sometimes amplify existing forms of oppression into > something more horrific.

What the Economist > Doesn't Get About Slavery\u2014And My Book. Politico. Retrieved May 23, 2015. The Half Has Never Been Told received mixed reviews from academics. A number of historians, including Eric Foner of Columbia University and Daina Ramey Berry of the University of Texas at Austin, have praised the book. \\- \\- \\- Economic historians have sharply criticized The Half Has Never Been Told. Reviewing the book in The Journal of Economic History (JEH), Alan Olmstead writes, \"Edward Baptist\u2019s study of capitalism and slavery is flawed beyond repair.\" Olmstead criticizes Baptist's \"torture hypothesis\" that increasing cruelty drove increases in cotton picking output, citing research that finds that increases in productivity resulted primarily from planting of improved cotton varieties. Olmstead additionally writes that \"carelessness with numbers when coupled with his fundamental misunderstanding of economic logic\" leads Baptist to vastly overstate the importance of cotton to the antebellum American economy. In a separate review of the book in the JEH, Eric Hilt writes, \"much of its economic analysis is so flawed that it undermines the credibility of the book.\" Hilt argues that Baptist's calculation of the share of cotton in antebellum America's Gross Domestic Product \"is a disastrously mishandled undertaking, full of obvious manipulations that overstate cotton's contribution.\" A 2020 study in the Economic History Review rejects Baptist's thesis that slavery was necessary for American economic development. In 2017, Baptist was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship for a new project on the history of the policing of African Americans from Jamestown to Ferguson. == Personal life == Baptist lives in Ithaca, New York. == Bibliography == * (2002).
