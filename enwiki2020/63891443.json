    "text": "Rudolf Elmayer von Vestenbrugg (Pula 1881 - Graz 1970), also known als Elmar Brugg, Rudolf Elmar von Vinibert or Elmar Vinibert von Rudolph, was a technical engineer and a prolific Nazi-writer from Austria, who published several popular surveys on the work of cosmologist Hanns H\u00f6rbiger and his now- defunct Cosmic Ice (Glacial Cosmogony) Theory, as well as a range of popular antisemitic and nationalsocialist books, including a biography of the antisemitic politician Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer. Up to 1938 Elmayer lived in Graz, where he later returned. During the War he was a SA-lieutenant colonel (Obersturmf\u00fchrer) and a military trainer, stationed in Slovenia. After 1945 he wrote on several other subjects, but he stayed true to his former political beliefs. He published a national-socialist novel and a 1958 dissertation on the Beowulf as a Germanic text.Jan M. Ziolkowski, The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity, Vol. 6: War and Peace, Sex and Violence, Cambridge 2018, Ch. 3. His last book Eingriffe aus den Kosmos (Interventions from Outer Space) was published posthumously in 1971 by Hans Schindler Bellamy. ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Atlantis proponents Category:Catastrophism Category:Pseudoastronomers Category:Pseudohistorians Category:Pseudoarchaeology Category:Religious cosmologies Category:Science writers Category:Antisemitism in Austria Category:Austrian Nazis ",
