His name also appears as Schurmann and in Hochdeutsch as Scheuermann. ==Life== Sch\u00fcrmann studied music, including voice, in his native Lower Saxony. By 1693, he was singing at the Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt as a young alto. In 1694 he composed a cantata for the inauguration of the Castle Salzdahlum in Wolfenb\u00fcttel. In 1697, he went to L\u00fcneburg (about 50 km southeast of Hamburg) for a guest performance. His singing there so impressed Duke Anton Ulrich of Brunswick- Wolfenb\u00fcttel that the Duke hired him on the spot. From 1702 to 1707 he was principal conductor and composer for the Meiningen Court Orchestra. In 1707 Sch\u00fcrmann officially succeeded Reinhard Keiser as Cammer-Componist (court composer). He served the court of Brunswick, with but a few brief interruptions, for 54 years until he died at the age of 79. ==Work== Sch\u00fcrmann wrote over thirty operas, many of which have not survived. His music was characterized by harmonic richness, careful contrapuntal elaboration, flexible handling of form and theatrically effective delineation of characters. Among his operas were: *Salomon, in einem Singespiel. (Libretto: Anton Ulrich (Braunschweig-Wolfenb\u00fcttel)). Wolfenb\u00fcttel, o.J. [1697?] *Daniel, in einem Sing-Spiel. (Libretto: Christian Knorr von Rosenroth). Braunschweig 1701 *Telemaque. (Libretto: Johann Beer). Naumburg 1706 *L'amor insanguinato oder Holofernes. (Libretto: Joachim Beccau). Braunschweig 1716. *Die Pleiades oder das Siebengestirne. (Libretto: Friedrich Christian Bressand). Braunschweig 1716 (und Wolfenb\u00fcttel 1735) *Der Edelm\u00fchtige Porsenna. (Libretto: Friedrich Christian Bressand). Wolfenb\u00fcttel 1718 *Heinrich der Vogler. (Libretto: Johann Ulrich K\u00f6nig). Wolfenb\u00fcttel 1718 (u.\u00f6.) *Die getreue Alceste in einer Opera. (Libretto: Johann Ulrich K\u00f6nig). Braunschweig 1719 (u.\u00f6.) *Ludovicus Pius oder Ludewig der Fromme. (Louis the Pious). Braunschweig 1726 *Clelia, in einer Opera vorgestellet.
