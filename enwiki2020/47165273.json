He now represents the Gopalpur constituency of Odisha and is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP). His concern for his own birthplace is what pushes him to work harder each day towards its development. He could figure out from the very start of his political career that on what grounds Berhampur is still to get better. Problems like women empowerment, proper sanitation, basic health care, poor infrastructure, backward education system, pollution and above all poverty are acting as hindrances towards the development of The Silk City. He has till now proved to be successful in eradicating the most widely spread endemic, i.e. corruption and violence under his constituency, maintaining peace and harmony throughout. There is no telling how much problems has he faced in doing so. He is one alarmed politician among all in his party. He's aware that only providing basic education to children won't solve the problem of illiteracy because as many adults are also untouched by education and remain jobless. Bhrugu Baxipatra since time immemorial has promoted peace and safety of the people not only under his constituency but for the people of Odisha. He and his activists are there to lead the crowd and enlighten the society everytime. Bhrugu Bhai hopes to be successful in getting good response from the people of Berhampur this time. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/BJP-Yet-to- Decide-Bhrugu%E2%80%99s-Fate/2014/03/20/article2119767.ece * https://www.zaubacorp.com/director/BHRUGU-BAXIPATRA/01692412 * https://web.archive.org/web/20150706140826/http://www.orissadiary.com/CurrentNews.asp?id=49848 * http://www.empoweringindia.org/new/preview.aspx?candid=568581&cid;=143 * https://odishanewsinsight.com/odisha/biju-yuva-vahini-behind-attack-on- kharabela-swain-bhrugu-baxipatra/ * https://odishatv.in/odisha/body- slider/imfa-protests-state-sponsored-bjps-bhrugu-baxipatra-291497 * http://www.orissapost.com/bhrugu-sets-up-battle-with-veteran-greenhorn/ * https://odishanewsinsight.com/odisha/17-people-killed-in-gajapati-district- during-cyclone-titli-bhrugu-baxipatra/ * https://nationfirstnews.in/views/bhrugu-baxipatra-expected-to-give-a-tough- fight-in-berhampur/ * Official Website Category:People from Odisha Category:Odisha politicians Category:Living people Category:1976 births Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Odisha ",
