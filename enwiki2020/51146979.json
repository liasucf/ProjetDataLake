Eveillard and his wife, and the British vice-consul Stephen Page, by \"some hundreds of Hadramites, inhabitants of Southern Arabia\". 24 others, mostly Greeks and Levantines, some \"under British protection\" plus the daughter of the French consul Elise Eveillard and the French interpreter M.

Emerat, the French dragoman (interpreter) and chancellor. According to him, the events were provoked by a commercial dispute which ended by the rehoisting of the British flag on an Indian ship and the hauling down of the Ottoman one, which provoked a riot. He added that the \"agitators\" actually resented the presence of non-Muslims \"whose presence, in their eyes, defiled the sacred soil of the Hejaz\".\"The Massacre at Jeddah\", The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 22 October 1858 The massacre was discussed in the British House of Commons on 12 and 22 July 1858.\"The Massacre at Jeddah \u2013 Question\", Hansard, Commons Sitting, 12 July 1858\"The Outrage at Jeddah \u2013 Question\", Hansard, Commons Sitting, 22 July 1858 According to The Church Review (1859), the Jeddah population of about 5,000 was \"often much increased by the influx of strangers\", \"the inhabitants are nearly all foreigners, or settlers from other parts of Arabia\". ==References== ==Scientific bibliography== * Freitag, Ulrike, \"Symbolic Politics and Urban Violence in Late Ottoman Jeddah\", in: Ulrike Freitag, Nelida Fuccaro, Claudia Ghrawi, Nora Lafi, Urban Violence in the Middle East: Changing Cityscapes in the Transition from Empire to Nation State, Berghahn Books, 2015 * Ochsenwald, William, 'The Jidda Massacre of 1858', Middle Eastern Studies, 13:3 (1977), 314\u201326 * P\u00e9triat, Philippe, \"D\u2019une histoire locale \u00e0 une histoire mondiale du massacre de Djedda (1858)\", Vacarme, 1998/1 (n\u00b0 6) * P\u00e9triat, Philippe, \"Fitna Djeddah\", les Hadramis dans l'\u00e9meute du 15 juin 1858, M\u00e9moire de Master 2, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sorbonne, 2010 ==See also== * Istanbul pogrom * Damascus affair (1840) * Massacre of Aleppo (1850) * 1955 Madaba riot * Christianity in the Ottoman Empire * Christianity in Saudi Arabia (pre-Saudi History section) Category:Massacres in the Ottoman Empire Category:Persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire Category:Persecution of Greeks in the Ottoman Empire before the 20th century Category:1858 riots Category:Jeddah Category:June 1858 events Category:1858 in the Ottoman Empire ",
