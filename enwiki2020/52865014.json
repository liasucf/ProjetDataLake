    "text": "James Lewis (1832 \u2013 July 11, 1914) was notable as a soldier and Republican Party politician in Louisiana. Born into slavery and of mixed race, during the American Civil War he left a position as steward on a Confederate steamboat to move to New Orleans, which had been taken over by Union troops. There he helped organize the First Louisiana Volunteer Native Guards, becoming captain of Company K and serving until 1864. After the war he became politically active in the Republican Party during the Reconstruction era, where he was an ally of several other leading men of color in the city and state. This was an especially violent time in Louisiana and New Orleans politics, but Lewis survived for decades as a political leader. He initially worked for the Freedmen's Bureau, where he was an agent to raise money and establish schools for freed slaves. He was appointed as a federal custom's inspector for a short period, the first man of African descent to gain a federal civil position in the state. He was recalled for political reasons. Lewis entered the New Orleans Metropolitan Police force, but left in 1872 after more political machinations. He emerged from the immediate postwar period as a leader in the New Orleans Republican Party . For much of the 1870s, 1880s, 1890s, and 1900s, he held state and federal-level Republican-appointee government positions, usually in the United States Treasury Department. He also served for years under Republican administrations as the surveyor-general of Louisiana and Mississippi. He was a Freemason and a leader in the Grand Army of the Republic, a civil war veterans organization. ==Early life== James Lewis was born into slavery in Wilkinson County, Mississippi in 1832.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner.

Smock, and Barbara S. Kraft. \"The Booker T. Washington Papers, Volume 5, 1899\u20131900.\" (1977): p239 Before the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), Lewis worked on steamboats on the Mississippi River, including the steamboat Ingomar, where he served and formed a friendship with Robert Reed Church; he also befriended Norris Wright Cuney by steamboat work. All three became political leaders after the Civil War.Ingham and Feldman (1994), p135Lewis may have been free by the outset of the Civil War. Historian David C. Rankin lists Lewis as an illiterate free steward in 1860\u201361, see: Rankin, David C. \"The Origins of Black Leadership in New Orleans During Reconstruction,\" The Journal of Southern History 40, no. 3 (1974): 417\u2013440. p438 ==Civil War== At the beginning of the Civil War, Lewis served as a steward on the CSS De Soto and was present at the fighting at the Battle of Belmont in November 1861 and the Battle of Island Number Ten and New Madrid in February, March, and April 1862. Lewis believed the war was a chance to fight for the freedom of all blacks. He fled through danger to New Orleans shortly after its capture by Union Forces under David Farragut and Benjamin Butler in late April and early May 1862, to join Union forces. In New Orleans, Lewis resolved to become a soldier. Together with other blacks, he asked for permission to raise a regiment of colored troops. Lewis raised two companies of colored infantry and was mustered into the First Louisiana Volunteer Native Guards as captain of one of these, Company K. While a minority of the members had been free men of color before the war, the majority of troops were slaves newly freed by their escape from plantations and joining Union lines. Lewis resigned his commission after the Red River Campaign led by Nathaniel Banks in 1864. Lewis later wrote that he resigned because he was ordered to appear before a Board of Examiners that would rule on his ability to continue as captain, and a member of the board told him that no black officers would be passed. In November 1864, Lewis was authorized to recruit another company of infantry to join the 1st United States Colored Infantry. He offered to do so if allowed to appear before a Board of Examiners and be commissioned as an officer.Berlin, Ira, ed. Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation 1861\u20131867: Series 11: The Black Military Experience. Cambridge University Press, 1982. p332-334 In 1864 Lewis married Josephine Joubert of New Orleans, a free woman of color whose family had been slaveholders. For many years the couple lived in a fine house on Canal Street across from Straight University. ==Reconstruction era== Lewis was at various times an ally and an opponent of Louisiana Republican leader, Henry Clay Warmouth (pictured). After the war, Lewis returned to New Orleans, where he worked as a permit and custom-house broker until the opening of ocean trade and the start of the Reconstruction Era. He was appointed as traveling agent for the educational department of the Freedmen's Bureau and worked to establish schools for freed slaves throughout Louisiana. He was frequently threatened during his work by ex-Confederates who opposed his efforts. At one point he was captured in North Louisiana and risked death but was rescued by the intervention of a group of fellow Freemasons. He may have been one of the injured in the 1866 New Orleans riot at the Mechanics Institute, when whites rioted against a parade of blacks celebrating suffrage.United States. Congress. House. Select Committee on the New Orleans Riots, Thomas Dawes Eliot, Samuel Shellabarger, Benjamin Markley Boyer. Report of the Select Committee on the New Orleans Riots. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1867, p13 When the Freedmen's Bureau closed, Lewis was appointed by Republican Governor William P. Kellogg as the United States inspector of customs for Louisiana, making him the first black man to have a civil position in the Federal service in Louisiana. In 1869, Lewis refused to support Seymour and Blair's presidential ticket, and as a result, Perry Fuller removed him from the position. Lewis became sergeant of the Metropolitan Police in New Orleans. He was successful in this position and was promoted to captain of the police. In 1870, Governor Henry Clay Warmouth appointed Lewis as colonel of the Second Regiment of the State Militia. That year Lewis was also elected to a two-year term as administer of police. Support for Warmouth among black Louisiana Republicans flagged, and opposition to Warmouth coalesced in what was called the Custom House Ring. It was headquartered at the U. S. Custom House and was led by federal appointees, including Lewis, Stephen B. Packard, a US Marshal; and James F. Casey, Collector of the Port of New Orleans and brother-in-law to President Ulysses S. Grant. The Custom House Ring supported the gubernatorial bid of Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives George W. Carter, and Carter and Warmouth violently clashed in late 1871 and early 1872. James Longstreet was the head of the Louisiana state militia, and was called to defend the statehouse from an attempt by Carter and the Ring to take over the government. Lewis did not respond to Longstreet's call-up of the militia. Members of his unit were reorganized under more politically reliable officers and did play a role in supporting Warmouth.Hogue, James Keith.

LSU Press, 2006. p76\u201383 ==Republican appointee== In 1872, at the state Republican Party convention, Lewis was nominated for Congress and made chairman of the Louisiana delegation to the 1872 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. When he returned to New Orleans, party divisions threatened unity. Lewis declined his congressional nomination in favor of P. B. S. Pinchback. He campaigned for William P. Kellogg for governor and was nominated and elected as administrator of public improvements in New Orleans. His opponents in that race were former Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard and Major E. A. Burke. Lewis was well appreciated as a civil servant and noted for his economic efficiency.[No Headline], The Donaldsonville Chief (Donaldsonville, Louisiana) November 2, 1872, page 2. Retrieved January 13, 2017 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8329719/no_headline_the_donaldsonville_chief/ In the mid-1870s, Lewis was the only Republican appointee in New Orleans city government. In 1876 he campaigned with then-Governor Packard and was elected by the state legislature to the United States Senate. But he did not take his seat as the state government was taken over by Democrats, and Lewis refused to press his claim. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Lewis as naval officer of the port at New Orleans, and he held that position until 1880. In December 1879, Lewis attempted to resolve a political feud between fellow Republicans Emile Detiege and Ernest and Onezyphore Delahoussaye. The four men met in Lewis' office in the Custom House and peace had seemingly been achieved. However, shortly later, Detiege shot and killed the two Delahoussaye brothers.\"A Political Feud,\" The Times-Picayune (New Orleans, Louisiana) December 4, 1879, page 1.

Grant until the final vote, which was won by eventual president, James A. Garfield. Lewis in 1887 Lewis returned to public life on May 1, 1883, when he was appointed United States Surveyor-General for the Louisiana District to replace James A.

Folger to superintendent of the United States bonded warehouse in New Orleans and continued to hold the position of surveyor-general of Louisiana. He continued to serve as surveyor general during the administrations of William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft, from 1897 to 1913. During this period, Louisiana was dominated by white conservative Democrats, and the legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised Lewis and most African Americans. But Lewis was appointed deputy collector of customs and immigration inspector by President Benjamin Harrison in the early 1890s.\"Col Jas Lewis, Race Leader, Dead in N.

Shakspeare to investigate the murder that month of Police Chief Hennessy. Italian suspects were rounded up by police. Lewis was one of the signatories of a letter to the Italian community, urging people to inform the committee about the suspects, and threatening extrajudicial action. He was the only man of color on the committee. Nineteen men were arrested. Ultimately eleven Italians were lynched on March 14, 1891 by a mob of 10,000 that stormed the prison where the suspects were held. Some of the victims had already been acquitted at trial and others had not yet been tried. In the 1890s and early 1900s, Lewis and Walter L. Cohen were the most important political allies in Louisiana of Booker T. Washington, president of Tuskegee Institute and a proponent of moderation in race issues. Lewis was a member of the National Afro-American Council founded by T. Thomas Fortune and heavily influenced by Washington.Guridy, Frank Andre.
