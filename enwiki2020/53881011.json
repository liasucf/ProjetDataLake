The music video starts out with a group of Swedish campers exiting out of a brown and white colored station wagon estate vehicle. In the kitchen, a blond haired Swedish guy with a white bucket hat on licking peanut butter from a jar with his finger, which a blonde haired Swedish woman grabs away from him. The blond haired Swedish man with a white bucket hat on gets slightly upset and exits the house, later to be seen stone skipping on a nearby body of water. A brown haired Swedish man with a mustache and goatee walks into the kitchen with groceries in his hands, with one of the two Swedish woman glancing at him after walking pass her from behind. A group of other Swedish people are seen helping a wavy blond haired Swedish man axing wood from a tree. The blond haired Swedish man with a white bucket hat on hears something and walks off into the forest area, where he sees something, presumably a spiritual being, and is frightened. Now at nighttime, the other group of fellow Swedes are inside the red wooden camp building roasting marshmallows from a fire using fire wood they've axed from earlier. A blond haired Swedish man asks the rest of the group to join him for a game of Monopoly, where a couple, consisting of a brown haired Swedish woman seducing a brown haired Swedish man with a moustache and goatee to go to another room for intimate privacy whilst on the lower bunk bed. The Monopoly game turns out to be a game of strip poker, as a blonde haired Swedish woman is seen losing a round and takes off her blue and white stripped shirt off, exposing her upper cleavage from her white bra and a wavy haired blond haired Swedish man with a red Georgia jersey on is later seen taking his jersey off. The blond haired Swedish man with a white bucket hat is seen on the top bunker of a bunk bed while the brown haired Swedish women and brown haired Swedish man with a moustache and goatee are making out. Another blonde haired Swedish women is seen taking a shower nude and is the second from the group to get frightened by an unknown presence, third a wavy blond haired Swedish man with a red Georgia jersey on while washing his face with water, fourth a brown haired Swedish man while inside an outhouse, and fifth the blonde haired Swedish women with a blue and white stripped shirt. The couple, the brown haired Swedish women and a brown haired Swedish man with a moustache and goatee, are later seen in the kitchen calling on a land line phone, presumingly for help, where they both end up being in a blackout because the mysterious unknown character manages to short circuit the wooden camp building's breaker box, and the scene turns out to be on a production studio set as a staged act, then the hand from the unknown being is seen in direction of the brown haired Swedish man with a moustache and goatee. ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
