    "text": "Leonard Barlab\u00e1ssy de H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja (; 1455 \u2013 May/September 1525) was a Hungarian nobleman at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, who served as Vice- voivode of Transylvania from 1501 to 1525. ==Family and early life== Leonard Barlab\u00e1ssy (also Barlabassy or Barlab\u00e1si) was born around 1455 into a Transylvanian noble family. His father was John II, the castellan of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (present-day Alba Iulia, Romania). Leonard had two brothers, John III and Michael II. They also had a stepbrother, the famous Humanist poet and pilgrim John L\u00e1szai. The centre of the family landholdings located in Csesztve (today part of Ocna Mure\u0219 town in Romania), where Leonard was born too. It is possible that his mother was an unidentified noblewoman from the illustrious Erd\u00e9lyi de Somker\u00e9k family. Through the intercession of his father, the young Leonard had the opportunity to serve as a royal page in the court of Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. There, he became acquainted with the Renaissance arts and Humanist scholarship. Following that, he became a familiaris of Stephen B\u00e1thory, a successful military general and the most powerful baron in Transylvania since the 1470s. Leonard was first mentioned by a contemporary record of the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 5 January 1492; the document styled him as \"egrerius\" (knightly noble), which implies that Leonard participated in several of B\u00e1thory's military campaigns against the Ottomans, although there are no explicit sources about his possible military career. By the early 16th century, Leonard and his brothers possessed extensive landholdings throughout in Transylvania, mainly in Kolozs, Doboka, Torda, Feh\u00e9r and K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 counties, in addition to the Sz\u00e9kely seat of Marossz\u00e9k. John and Leonard bought the lower part of Mikl\u00f3slaka (Mico\u0219laca) from Emeric T\u0151ki de L\u00f3na in January 1492. According to a lawsuit from July 1498, the brothers and their children unlawfully acquired the whole settlement by that time. Leonard was granted the estates of \u00d3zd (Ozd) and T\u00e1t\u00e9 (Totoi) by King Vladislaus II of Hungary in a lawsuit of 1492 against Ladislaus Ger\u00e9b, the Bishop of Transylvania. John and Leonard bought the villages of H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja (Idrifaia) and Mikefalva (Mica) from the Farkas de Harina family in March 1495. In addition, they also acquired portions of Somostelke (\u0218omo\u0219telnic), K\u00e1polna (C\u0103p\u00e2lna de Sus) and Cserged (Cerg\u0103u) in K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 County. As a familiaris of Stephen B\u00e1thory, the Barlab\u00e1ssy brothers gradually increased their influence in Transylvania, sometimes abusing their power. According to a complaint to the royal court in 1493, they unlawfully forced privileged Sz\u00e9kely communities to pay local taxes in Sepsisz\u00e9k (another seat in Sz\u00e9kely Land). The Diocese of Transylvania also sent a complaint to Vladislaus II in 1500; accordingly, Leonard and his brothers refused to pay tithe in their landholdings regarding the year 1499. ==Career== Leonard Barlab\u00e1ssy was appointed Vice-voivode of Transylvania in 1501. In this capacity, he functioned as a substitute of Voivode Peter Szentgy\u00f6rgyi, who also held the dignity of Judge royal since 1500, thus he was staying in Transylvania infrequently following that. Barlab\u00e1ssy retained his position during the term of the next voivode, John Z\u00e1polya too, who was also a close political ally of his predecessor, Szentgy\u00f6rgyi. During Barlab\u00e1ssy's extremely long office- holding (24 years), several Hungarian nobles simultaneously held the office of vice-voivode alongside him: Paul Magyi (1502\u20131503), Benedict T\u00fari (1505\u20131507), Ladislaus Czertinger (1505\u20131508), Nicholas T\u00far\u00f3ci (1512\u20131516), Nicholas Hagym\u00e1s de Bereksz\u00f3 (1517\u20131519), Stephen B\u00e1thory de Somly\u00f3 (1521\u20131522) and Stephen Tomori de Cs\u00facs (1523\u20131525). Barlab\u00e1ssy was also referred to as Viscount of the Sz\u00e9kelys during his first appearance as vice-voivode on 7 June 1501. By that time, the former dignity of Count of the Sz\u00e9kelys was an accessory title to the dignity of Voivode of Transylvania (except the years 1504\u20131507). Beside that, Barlab\u00e1ssy was also styled himself as isp\u00e1n (comes) of G\u00f6rg\u00e9ny (today Gurghiu, Romania) in his letter with the date 22 July 1504. The title means that Barlab\u00e1ssy acted as castellan of G\u00f6rg\u00e9ny Castle (official seat of the counts of the Sz\u00e9kelys). Barlab\u00e1ssy built a Renaissance-style country-house in H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja in 1508, which was elevated into the status of his official residence. Based on the sources, it is plausible that he bought the portions of his brothers and exclusively owned the settlement alone by that time. Barlab\u00e1ssy exercised the performance of his administrative and judicial duties from here, therefore contemporary sources began to call him \"Barlabassy de Hederfaya\", while his brothers, John and Michael and their descendants were continued to refer with the prefix \"Chezthwe\" (Csesztve). He also possessed another country-house in \u00d3zd. Altogether 363 charters were preserved, which contained the activity of Barlab\u00e1ssy as vice-voivode. He had a professional personal staff, who were employed in the chancellery. His personal notaries were Simon Kereszt\u00fari (1501) and Ambrose Szucs\u00e1ki (1520\u20131525). One of his documents, issued on 17 July 1507, is the first of the contemporary documents, which mentions the name of Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f3zsa de Makfalva, who later led a nationwide a peasants' revolt against the magnates. According to Barlab\u00e1ssy's letter, D\u00f3zsa and his soldiers robbed and murdered some local Saxon traders near Hermannstadt (present-day Sibiu, Romania). After John Z\u00e1polya was appointed voivode, Barlab\u00e1ssy became a member of his inner advisory council, alongside, for instance, Stephen Werb\u0151czy, Michael Szobi and Nicholas Bethlen. The Ottomans began invading the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Hungary in April 1511. Z\u00e1polya ordered the city council of Bistritz (Bistri\u021ba) to gather their armies and sent them under the command of Barlab\u00e1ssy in June 1511, who repeated his overlord's command in 1512. Alongside his co-vice-voivode Nicholas T\u00far\u00f3ci and other lords, Barlab\u00e1ssy invited the Saxon communities to attend a general diet summoned to Hermannstadt in 1513. Barlab\u00e1ssy participated in the suppression of the 1514 peasant revolt, led by D\u00f3zsa. His army, composing of Sz\u00e9kely and Saxon troops, joined John Tornallyai's garrison, stationed near Kolozsv\u00e1r (Cluj-Napoca). On 29 June, he instructed Fabian, judge of Bistritz to send gunpowder to the castle of G\u00f6rg\u00e9ny. Barlab\u00e1ssy's banderium clashed with the insurgent troops of friar Lawrence M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, D\u00f3zsa's lieutenant at the walls of Kolozsv\u00e1r. Amid brutal retaliations, which followed D\u00f3zsa's revolt, Barlab\u00e1ssy sent an unusual letter to the council of Beszterce on 11 February 1515, in which he instructed any former insurgents should be granted amnesty and put them back into the service of their former lords. The suppression of the revolt strengthened Z\u00e1polya's political positions. Barlab\u00e1ssy supported his efforts without question. He declared the general assemblies of Sz\u00e9kelys, which were held without the consent of the Count of the Sz\u00e9kelys (i.e. Z\u00e1polya) as unlawful and invalid, and forbade the Sz\u00e9kely communities from attendance. Barlab\u00e1ssy acquired several villages and lands during his 24-year term as vice-voivode. For instance, he was granted the village of Cs\u00fcd\u0151telke (Cu\u0219telnic) by Martin Erd\u00e9lyi for his long-time support and friendship in 1517. He also acquired some portions at Mez\u0151szengyel (S\u00e2nger) in 1522. ==Patron of arts== Leonard Barlab\u00e1ssy was known to have been a patron of arts, who contributed significantly to the spread of the Renaissance in Transylvania. He bequeathed different sums to several ecclesiastical institutions and monasteries. For instance, he handed over the church of Segesv\u00e1r (Sighi\u0219oara) to the Dominican Order. He also financially supported a Humanist scholar circle in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, which centered around its bishop Ladislaus Ger\u00e9b and the clergymen (including his nephew John IV). His coat-of-arms, which depicts a bison head with a dragon biting its own tail and the insignia of Sun and Moon, can be found in the cathedral of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and the church of Sz\u00e9kelyd\u00e1lya (Daia). He supported the expansion and reconstruction of the latter church with monetary donations. Barlab\u00e1ssy held the right of patronage over the Fortress Church at Sz\u00e9kelyv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely (T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219). Its frescoes, which survived in fragments, depicts the legend of St. Leonard of Noblac. According to art historian Lajos Kelemen, its donator was Leonard Barlab\u00e1ssy. Art historian Jol\u00e1n Balogh emphasized the country-house of H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja is the earliest surviving Renaissance-style building in the province of Transylvania, excluding the reconstructions of some royal castles. Barlab\u00e1ssy's stepbrother, John L\u00e1szai erected a Renaissance-style chapel in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r around the same time. A stone lintel at H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja preserved the date of the construction of the country-house (1508) and Barlab\u00e1ssy's coat-of-arms and its subscription, which depicts Italian calligraphic style. Its condition gradually deteriorated into annihilation after the Romanian Revolution. It was restored in 2009. ==Personal life== Leonard Barlab\u00e1ssy married Margaret Bog\u00e1ti de Radn\u00f3t, the daughter of Stephen Bog\u00e1ti and Helena Farkas de Harina. Their marriage produces five children: John V, Leonard II, Catherine, Magdalene and Sophia. After the death of his first wife at an unknown time, Barlab\u00e1ssy married Magdalene Ger\u00e9b de Ving\u00e1rt, who came from a prominent Transylvanian noble family of Saxon origin. They had four children: Anne, Farkas I, Barbara and Euphrosyne. Barlab\u00e1sy's daughters were engaged to local nobles from prominent families. For instance, Magdalene became the wife of Gregory Erd\u00e9lyi de Somker\u00e9k, while Sophia married to Nicholas III V\u00edzaknai. Leonard provided for the proper education of his sons; in his last will he forbade his adult sons \u2013 John V and Leonard II \u2013 not to interrupt their university studies in any way. John V attended the University of Krak\u00f3w in 1527, and was a schoolmate of J\u00e1nos Sylvester. Barlab\u00e1ssy compiled his last will and testament on 28 January 1525 in H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja. He was last mentioned as a living person on 8 May 1525. He died by 29 September 1525. In accordance with his last will, Barlab\u00e1ssy was buried in the Fortress Church of Sz\u00e9kelyv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely. His large wealth and extensive possessions were distributed among his sons and grandsons in the following decades, according to his division of property diploma issued on 2 February 1521, which was presented to John Z\u00e1polya. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1450s births Category:1525 deaths Category:15th- century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Hungarian people Category:Vice- voivodes of Transylvania Category:People from Ocna Mure\u0219 Leonard ",
