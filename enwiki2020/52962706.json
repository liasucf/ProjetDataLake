    "text": "Identity was supposed to be a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Asylum Entertainment, Inc. for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In the game, players would have the freedom to do a variety of activities in an open world setting, including karaoke and paintballing and join a wide set of career options. The game was to allow players to customize and furnish their own homes. During it's one month Kickstarter campaign, Identity raised CA$187,859 by 4,218 backers. In September 2018 the developers announced that the Town Square Module, an Early Access version of the game with limited features, would be available to those who pledged on the game's Kickstarter campaign or paid a set fee before the Town Square's release. It was released on Steam on November 30, 2018. == Controversy == Identity developers maintained it's fan base for several years by promising progress to their backers and late pledges, despite showing little progress during their infrequent updates. In 2019 they sent out an official newsletter in which they claimed their obligations toward their backers were filled and they were unable to fund anymore development, thus rendering further progress either slow or impossible. The released gameplay footage and play testing of Asylum Entertainment, Inc.'s Identity reveals an empty shell of 3D game assets with bare bones intractability, becoming one of many video game Kickstarter campaigns that failed to release the advertised product. In another official newsletter, Asylum Entertainment, Inc. claimed to be contracted as publishers to a mobile game called Furballs, calling on their supporters to back the Furballs Kickstarter campaign after abandoning the game they already funded. Later investigations revealed that Asylum Entertainment, Inc. Director John VanderZwet occupies Phony Games Inc. Director's position as well. There has been concern that Furballs will follow in the same footsteps Identity did, with backers questioning if Asylum Entertainment, Inc. is a legitimate company or not. Despite being reported to Steam, Identity remains available for purchase, costing $29.99. It has a Mostly Negative rating. == References == == External links == * * Kickstarter page Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games ",
