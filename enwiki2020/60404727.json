    "text": "Ultraforce is a 1984 supplement published by AutoVentures for Car Wars, Battlecars, and Highway 2000. ==Gameplay== Ultraforce is the third in a series of adventure modules for auto-combat games, and in this scenario the players are members of an elite strikeforce known as \"Ultraforce\". ==Reception== Chris Baylis reviewed Ultraforce for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"It is in no way a necessity for auto-combat gaming but might awaken some latent ideas in players bored with the routine run of play.\" Jerry Epperson reviewed Ultraforce in Space Gamer No. 72. Epperson commented that \"I found Ultraforce to be the most useful and interesting of the AutoVentures modules (and also the deadliest). If you want to put some new thunder in your auto-combats or overhaul your campaign, Ultraforce will provide all the motorvation you need. At last, we closet-duellists can put our skills to a real test, for a real cause! And remember . . . the good guys always win.\" ==References== Category:Car Wars ",
