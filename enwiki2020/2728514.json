Steam locomotives are operated on a few World Heritage sites and also run occasionally as heritage trains. A locomotive is also known as a loco or more popularly as an engine. The country's first steam locomotive ran on the Red Hill Railway (built by Arthur Cotton to transport granite for road-building) from Red Hills to the Chintadripet bridge in Madras in 1837. == Classification == Locomotives were classified by track gauge, motive power, function and power (or model number) in a four- or five-letter code. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes motive power (diesel or electric), and the third letter denotes use (goods, passenger, mixed or shunting). The fourth letter denotes a locomotive's chronological model number. In 2002, a new classification system was adopted. For newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter denotes their horsepower range. Not all diesel locomotives were reclassified, and the fourth letter continues to denotes their model number. A locomotive may have a fifth letter, generally denoting a technical variant, subclass or subtype: a variation in the basic model or series, or a different motor or manufacturer. Under the new system, the fifth letter further refines horsepower in 100-hp increments: A for 100 hp, B for 200 hp, C for 300 hp and so on. A WDP-3A is a locomotive, and a WDM-3F is . The system does not apply to steam locomotives, which are no longer used on main lines. They retain their original class names, such as M- or WP-class. === Syntax === *First letter (gauge): **W \u2013 Broad gauge (wide) \u2013 **Y \u2013 Metre gauge (yard) \u2013 **Z \u2013 narrow gauge **N \u2013 narrow (toy) gauge *Second letter (motive power): **D \u2013 Diesel **C \u2013 DC electric (DC overhead line) **A \u2013 AC electric (AC overhead line) **CA \u2013 DC and AC (AC or DC overhead line); CA is considered one letter **B \u2013 Battery (rare) *Third letter (job type): **G \u2013 Goods **P \u2013 Passenger **M \u2013 Mixed (goods and passenger) **S \u2013 Shunting (switching) **U \u2013 Multiple unit (electric or diesel) **R \u2013 Railcar In WDM 3A, W denotes broad gauge; D denotes diesel power; M denotes mixed use (goods and passenger service), and 3A denotes (3,000 + 100). In WAP 5, W is broad gauge; A is AC electric; P is passenger service, and 5 indicates that the locomotive is the fifth model used. == Broad-gauge (5 ft 6 in) locomotives == === Steam === Nineteenth-century railway companies ordered custom-built locomotives, usually from British manufacturers. The multiplicity of similar-but-not-identical designs increased manufacturing cost and slowed production. During the 1890s, British manufacturers were busy and Indian railway companies looked to Germany and the United States for locomotives. Engines used were: *Bengal Nagpur Railway: **Class F: 0-6-0 **Class GM: 2-6-0 (probably modified) **BNR class HSG: 2-8-0+0-8-2 Garratt, India's first successful Garratts **Class M: 4-6-2 (probably modified) **BNR class N: 4-8-0+0-8-4 Garratt, India's largest locomotive. One is preserved at the National Rail Museum, New Delhi **BNR class NM: Similar to N class; ten were built in 1931 by Beyer Peacock, and it was withdrawn in the late 1960s. **BNR class P: 4-8-2+2-8-4 Garratt; four were built by Beyer Peacock in 1939. During the early 1970s, they were at the Bhilai (BIA) shed before being withdrawn. *Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway: **BB&CI; class P: 4-6-2 **Class A: 2-4-0T, probably an Atlantic; was at the Palej shed. **Class U36: 0-4-2, used on hauling suburban trains in Bombay **Class D1: 4-4-0; one was named Princess May. **Class M: 4-6-2 (probably modified) *East Indian Railway Company: **Class CT: 0-6-4T, probably converted to a superheater. **EIR class G: 2-2-2T. First two named Express and Fairy Queen. Built in 1855, the latter is the world's oldest locomotive to be in working order. Later rebuilt by Perambur Loco Works. Housed at East Indian Railway (EIR) **EIR class P: 4-6-0 *Great Indian Peninsula Railway: **GIPR classes Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4: 0-8-4T. Used on Thal Ghat as bankers for pushing trains up the Western Ghats. **GIPR Class F and F3: 2-6-0 **GIPR class J1: 0-6-0 **Class D4: 4-6-0; one is named Hero. **Class D5: 4-6-0 passenger locomotive **Class E1: 4-4-2 Atlantic built by the North British Locomotive Company in 1907\u20138. Rebuilt with a superheater between 1925 and 1928. **Class T: Tank locomotive used for hauling Mumbai suburban trains **Class Y: 2-8-4T **Crane tank: 0-6-0T; one is preserved at the National Rail Museum in New Delhi. *Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway: **M&SM; class V: 4-4-0; one is preserved. **Class BTC: 2-6-4T, based on BESA specifications **Class T: 0-4-2; one is preserved in Madras. *Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway: **NSR class A: 2-6-0T (No. 48, probably an Atlantic) preserved at the National Rail Museum, Delhi. *North Western State Railway: **Class EM: 4-4-2 (probably modified); one is preserved at the National Rail Museum **NWR class GAS: 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt; one built in 1925, and retired in 1937. **NWR class P: 2-4-0 **Class E1: 4-4-2 **Class N1: 4-8-0 *Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway: **Class B26: 0-6-0; one is preserved at the National Rail Museum. *Others: **Class B: 2-6-0 **Class E: 2-4-0 **Class F: 2-8-2, built between 1926 and 1950 by Nasmyth Wilson for service on Central Railway (CR). **Class G: 2-6-0, probably intended for freight **Class NA2 **Class PTC: 2-6-4T, owned by Northern Railway (NR); probably a converted passenger locomotive **Class Y2: 2-8-2T, reclassified L2 **Phoenix: 0-4-0T; one is at the National Rail Museum. **Ramgotty: 2-2-0T; the National Rail Museum's oldest locomotive, it was converted to broad gauge. **Sultan, Sahib and Sindh: Hauled the train from VT to Thana in 1853. ==== Designs ==== Vulcan Foundry class SPS, 1911 After acrimonious words in The Times and Parliament, the British Engineering Standards Committee (later the British Engineering Standards Association) began designing a series of locomotives for use by Indian railways. The first two designs emerged in 1903: a 4-4-0 passenger and 0-6-0 goods. They were revised in 1905 and 1906 with additional heavier, more- powerful locomotives: * Class SP: Standard passenger (4-4-0) * Class SG: Standard goods (0-6-0) * Class PT: Passenger tank (2-6-4T) * Class HP: Heavy passenger (4-6-0) * Class AP: Atlantic passenger (4-4-2) * Class HG: Heavy goods (2-8-0) * Class HT: Heavy tank (2-8-2T) These advisory BESA designs were customized by the railway companies, which used different classification systems; only the state-operated railways used the class designations SP, SG, PT, HP, AP, HG and HT. When superheating was accepted, superheated versions were classified SPS, SGS and so on (if built with superheaters) and SPC, SGC and so on (if converted from saturated to superheated). After World War I, larger and more-powerful locomotives were designed by British consulting engineers for the Indian government. They began to appear in 1927: * Class XA: branch passenger 4-6-2 design, 12.5-ton axle load * Class XB: light passenger 4-6-2 design, 17-ton axle load * Class XC: heavy passenger 4-6-2 design, 19.5-ton axle load * Class XD: Light goods 2-8-2 design, 17-ton axle load * Class XE: heavy goods 2-8-2 design, 22.5-ton axle load * Class XF: light shunting 0-8-0 design, 18-ton axle load * Class XG: heavy shunting 0-8-0 design, 23-ton axle load * Class XH: 4-cylinder 2-8-2, 28-ton axle load; none were built * Class XP: experimental passenger 4-6-2, 18.5-ton axle load * Class XS: experimental 4-cylinder 4-6-2, 21.5-ton axle load * Class XT: light tank 0-4-2T, 15-ton axle load During World War II, large numbers of 2-8-2 locomotives were acquired from the United States and Canada and classified AWD and CWD. The Baldwin Locomotive Works adapted the USATC S160 Class locomotive design for India, and it became class AWC. Sixty broad-gauge locomotives were built in 1944 as part of an order of 180 S160 engines. In addition to modified frame spreaders, axles, cylinders, and cab, the Indian locomotives had a turbo generator and electric lighting (not included in the standard European design). Many parts (including boilers) were identical to those in standard- gauge locomotives.Baldwin Locomotive Works drawing index and bill of materials for special order 43306, locomotive design 2-8-0 19S, numbers 666 to 845 for the U.S. Government, War Department. Although new classes were designed shortly before the war, many did not enter service until the post-war period. The new classes were indicated by the change of broad-gauge prefix from X to W, and plans were implemented to begin manufacturing locomotives in India. The new classes were: * Class WP: passenger 4-6-2, 18.50-ton axle load * Class WG: goods 2-8-2, 18.50-ton axle load * Class WL (1st): light 4-6-2, 16.00-ton axle load (four for North Western Railway in 1939; all to Pakistan during partition of India) * Class WL (2nd): light 4-6-2, 16.75-ton axle load * Class WM: 2-6-4T, 16.25-ton axle load * Class WT: 2-8-4T, 18.00-ton axle load * Class WU: 2-4-2T, 16.50-ton axle load * Class WV: 2-6-2T, 16.25-ton axle load * Class WW: 0-6-2T, 16.50-ton axle load All broad-gauge steam locomotives in India have been withdrawn from normal service, with only occasional steam specials continuing to operate. === Diesel === Broad-gauge diesel classification codes are: * WDM \u2013 Wide diesel mixed * WDP \u2013 Wide diesel passenger * WDG \u2013 Wide diesel goods * WDS \u2013 Wide diesel shunter * WCDS \u2013 Wide converted diesel shunter * DEMU - Diesel electric multiple unit * DHMU - Diesel Hydraulic multiple unit ==== Mixed class (WDM Series) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDM-1 |ALCO |Co-Co |100 |1957-1959 |1950 HP |Retired |1 |First mainline diesel locomotive |frameless |- |WDM-2 |ALCO/DLW |Co-Co |1440 |1962\u20131998 |2600 HP |In service |9 |A few still in service |frameless |- |WDM-2G |DLW |Co-Co |2 |2013 |2400 HP |In Service | | | |- |WDM-3 |Henschel |Bo-Bo |8 |1970 |2500 HP |Retired |None | |frameless |- |WDM-3A |DLW |Co-Co |1402 |1994\u20131998 |3100 HP |In service |1 Earmarked | |frameless |- |WDM-3B |DLW |Co-Co |8, all rebuilt back to WDM-3D |2005-2006 |3100 HP |In service | |All rebuilt back to WDM-3D |frameless |- |WDM-3C |DLW |Co-Co |10 |2002 |3300 HP |In service |None |All rebuilt back to WDM-3A | |- |WDM-3D |DLW |Co-Co |500 |2003-2013 |3300 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDM-3E |DLW |Co-Co |8 |2008 |3500 HP |In service | | | |- |WDM-3F |DLW |Co-Co |3 |2008 |3600 HP |In service | | | |- |WDM-4 |GM |Co-Co |72 |1962 |2600 HP |Retired |2 | |frameless |- |WDM-6 |DLW |Bo-Bo |2 |1981-1982 |1350 HP |Retired |2 |Both units earmarked for preservation |frameless |- |WDM-7 |DLW |Co-Co |15 |1987\u20131989 |2000 HP |In service |1 Earmarked |Currently used for shunting uses only |frameless |} ==== Passenger class (WDP Series) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDP-1 |DLW |Bo-Bo |69 |1995\u20131999 |2300 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-3A |DLW |Co-Co |69 |1998\u20132002 |3100 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-4 |EMD/DLW |Bo1-1Bo |100 |2002\u20132011 |4000 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-4B |DLW |Co-Co |86 |2010\u20132014 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-4D |DLW |Co-Co |525 |2010\u20132018 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |} ==== Goods class (WDG Series) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDG-3A |DLW |Co-Co |1998 |1995\u20132010 |3100 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-3B |DLW |Co-Co |4 |2004 |3200 HP |In service | | | |- |WDG-3C |DLW |Co-Co |1 |2001 |3300 HP |In service | | | |- |WDG-3D |DLW |Co-Co |1 |2001 |3400 HP |In service | | | |- |WDG-4 |EMD/DLW |Co-Co |1188 |1999\u20132012 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-4G |GE |Co-Co |209 |2017\u2013present |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-4D |DLW |Co-Co |583 |2013\u20132018 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-5 |DLW |Co-Co |7 |2012-2017 |5500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-6G |GE |Co-Co |4 |2018\u2013present |6000 HP |In service | | |frameless |} ==== Shunter Class (WDS Series) ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDS-1 |GE |Bo-Bo |15 |1944-1945 |386 HP |Retired |1 |India's first diesel locomotive |frameless |- |WDS-2 |Kraus Maffei |C |30 |1954-1955 |440 HP |Retired |None | |frameless |- |WDS-3 |Maschi- nenbau Kiel |C |7 |1961 |618 HP |Retired |None | |frameless |- |WDS-4 |CLW |C |27 |1968-1969 |600 HP | Few are still in service |4 |A few still in service |frameless |- |WDS-4A |CLW |C |5 |1968 |660 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4B |CLW |C |450 |1969 |700 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4C |CLW |C |7 |1976-78 |700 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4D |CLW |C |120 |1984-97 |700 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-5 |ALCO/DLW |Co-Co |21 |1967 |1065 HP |In service |None |A few still in service |frameless |- |WDS-6 |DLW |Co-Co |270 |1975\u2013 |1400 |In service |2 Earmarked | |frameless |- |WDS-6AD |DLW |Co-Co |270 |1975\u2013 |1400 |In service |2 Earmarked | |frameless |- |WDS-8 |CLW |Bo-Bo |5 |1979-1982 |800 HP |Retired |None | |frameless |} ==== Converted shunter class (WCDS series) ==== The WCDS6, a YDM4 locomotive, was converted to broad gauge by the Golden Rock Railway Workshop for large industrial companies;
