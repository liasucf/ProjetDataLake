During her lifetime, she was considered one of Europe's leading intellects and one of the most intelligent women of the time. She became acquainted with her husband, the poet and author Johann Christoph Gottsched, when she sent him some of her own works. He apparently was impressed, and a long correspondence eventually led to marriage. After marriage, Luise continued to write and publish, and was also her husband's faithful helper in his literary labours. Her uncle was the anatomist Johann Adam Kulmus. ==Works== She wrote several popular comedies, of which Das Testament is the best, and translated The Spectator (9 volumes, 1739\u20131743), Alexander Pope's Rape of the Lock (1744) and other English and French works. After her death her husband edited her S\u00e4mtliche kleinere Gedichte with a memoir (1763). ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1713 births Category:1762 deaths Category:18th-century German writers Category:18th-century German women writers Category:18th-century German women Category:Writers from Gda\u0144sk Category:People from Royal Prussia Category:Translators to German ",
