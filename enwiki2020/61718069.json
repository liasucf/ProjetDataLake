Since 1861 it has been misattributed to Piero della Francesca, a young Leonardo da Vinci and Cosimo Rosselli Aldo Galli, I Pollaiolo, collana \"Galleria delle arti\" n.7, 5 Continents Editions, Milano 2005.. It forms part of a group of profile portraits of women which also includes one in Milan, one at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and another at the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin Gloria Fossi, Uffizi, Giunti, Firenze 2004. . Berenson attributes the more accomplished works in the group to Antonio and the others (along with the weaker sections of the better works) to Piero.
