    "text": "Misty Copeland in Copp\u00e9lia in 2014 The history of African-American ballerinas in the American ballet world is a scarce one due to racial issues and the question of whether or not African Americans had the body type to fit into this world. The ballet world changed its look about half a century ago. More companies are catering to the idea of talented African Americans in ballet, and some have even made them the faces of their companies. The idea of African Americans in the world of ballet was a rarity, because many of them lacked the opportunity to participate in the art. Black dancers typically fit into rebellious dance, practicing Graham, Lim\u00f3n, and Horton. However, some dancers managed to stay true their techniques and commit to making a mark in the American ballet industry. In 1969 Arthur Mitchell, the first African-American principal male dancer with a major ballet company, the New York City Ballet, founded the Dance Theatre of Harlem as a reaction to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. That predominantly \"colored\" company gave many opportunities to all races to dance the classics as well as ballets by Balanchine and other living choreographers. ==African-American ballerinas== ===Raven Wilkinson=== Raven Wilkinson was one of the first African-American ballerinas allowed to join a ballet company.
