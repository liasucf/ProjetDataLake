Opened in 1886, the station was closed when the new railway and bus terminal was opened in 2011. ==History== The station was opened in 1886 Mar del Plata in 1910 Platforms and sign In August 1861, Edward Lumb, a British entrepreneur, requested the concession of a railway line, initially projected to run from Constituci\u00f3n to Chascom\u00fas, 120 km from Buenos Aires. During a visit to Mar del Plata, Governor of Buenos Aires, Dardo Rocha, saw the potential of the city, assuring a promising future for it. Before leaving the city, he promised to call manager of Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (the British company that had built the lines in the south of the province), Guillermo Moores, to request the extension of the railway line from Maip\u00fa to Mar del Plata. Moreover, Rocha stated that in case the BAGSR declined the request, the Provincial Government would finance the construction of the line to the coast city. On September 26, 1886, the first train arrived to the city of Mar del Plata, which was the main tourist destination during summer season. By 1910 Mar del Plata was the main beach city of Argentina, receiving a huge number of tourists during the summer. Due to the intense traffic of passengers, the railway station exceeded its capacity and the Municipality demanded the company to increase the facilities. The company had always denied to this request alleging that the station was only overcrowded during two months per year (the period of summer season in Argentina).Estaci\u00f3n Mar del Plata Norte on Fotos Viejas de Mar del Plata blog, 14 Jun 2010 During the first decade of the 20th century, the urban development of Mar del Plata moved from the downtown to the South West (nearest to the coast) so the train station was far from the residences and hotels where the tourist were hosted. In June 1908, the Congress promulgated Law 5.535, authorizing the BAGSR to build a new station in Mar del Plata. Although the construction of a new station had been approved, a residents' committee (led by Mar del Plata pioneer Pedro Luro) opposed the old station being demolished, requesting its preservation. Percy Clarke, manager of the company had to accept the residents' claim. The other point of conflict with the inhabitants of the city was the path of the new line. While the company wanted to build the new station near to the coast (to reduce costs), the residents demanded that the station should be located far from the most populated areas of the city. Eventually, the BAGSR agreed to build the new station where the neighbours had demanded.Estaci\u00f3n Mar del Plata Sud on Fotos Viejas de Mar del Plata blog, 28 Feb 2011 With a project designed by Belgian Architect Jules Dormal, works began in 1909 and finished one year later, when the station building began to be constructed. The project of the company also included to extend the tracks to the city of Miramar. The new station in Mar del Plata (named \"Mar del Plata Sud\") was opened on December 1, 1910, although the main building was not still finished, so a provisional wooden-structure was opened to the public for the 1910\u201311 summer season. As Mar del Plata Norte remained active, the Sud station would be only used during the summer seasons. It had two large platforms, the main building, a post warehouse, and a signal cabin. When the new station opened, all the trains that arrived to the old station were reprogrammed to make their arrival to the South station. It totalled four services per day, including the two express services. Nevertheless, a few days before the inauguration, the BAGSR requested to the Government that only the express services arrived to the new station, due to the other three trains programmed having to end their routes in Miramar and could not change their path to the south station. The request was approved and therefore only the express services stopped at the new station. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised in 1948,Ferrocarriles: de los or\u00edgenes a la estatizaci\u00f3n de Per\u00f3n by Claudia Ferri on La Izquierda Diario, 17 Apr 2015 Mar del Plata became part of General Roca Railway, one of the six divisions of state-owned Ferrocarriles Argentinos. On May 3, 1949, the Mar del Plata Sud station was definitively closed so Mar del Plata Norte became the only station in the city. In 1951 Ferrocarriles Argentinos acquired a total of 46 coaches from American Budd Company, used for The Marplatense, a luxury service from Buenos Aires to Mar del Plata. In 1952 the FADEL locomotives were added to tow the Marplatense express with a journey time of 3 hours and 45 minutes. FA ran trains until 1993 when the service was taken over by Ferrobaires, a company owned by the Buenos Aires Province.\"Ferrobaires: La idea que no fue\" on Portal de Trenes website Ferrobaires operated the standard services between Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires until its closure in 2018.Se oficializ\u00f3 traspaso de Ferrobaires a Naci\u00f3n, Infocielo, 26 Jul 2017 In 2009, the bus terminus (that operated in old Mar del Plata Norte station building) moved to a new building, very close to the still active railway station in the centre of the city. It was also announced that the old building would be preserved as a cultural centre, designed by Arq. C\u00e9sar Pelli. Two years later, rail tracks were extended to connect with the bus station, adding new platforms to receive trains arriving from Constituci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, therefore the old station entered into disuse. ==See also== * Mar del Plata railway and bus station * Ferrobaires * Mar del Plata ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:Railway stations in Buenos Aires Category:Railway stations opened in 1886 Category:Railway stations closed in 2011 Category:Mar del Plata ",
