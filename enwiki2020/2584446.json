    "text": "Richard F. MacPherson (November 4, 1930 - August 8, 2017) was an American football coach. He served as the head coach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1971 to 1977 and at Syracuse University from 1981 to 1990, compiling a career college football record of 111\u201373\u20135. MacPherson was the head coach of the National Football League's New England Patriots from 1991 to 1992, tallying a mark of 8\u201324. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2009. ==Coaching career== MacPherson's record at Syracuse was 66\u201346\u20134 and included an undefeated season in 1987, when his team finished 11\u20130\u20131 and tied Auburn in the 1988 Sugar Bowl. After the 1990 season he left Syracuse to become head coach of the New England Patriots and was replaced by assistant Paul Pasqualoni. MacPherson coached the Pats from 1991 to 1992 and received strong consideration for Coach of the Year honors in 1991, turning around a team that went 1\u201315 in 1990 and leading them to a 6\u201310 record in his first season. However, in his second season the team started four different quarterbacks and went 2\u201314. MacPherson was subsequently fired at the end of the season. MacPherson also served as an assistant coach with the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns. ==Later life== MacPherson provided commentary during radio coverage of Syracuse football games for several seasons. He was honored as the Grand Marshal at the 28th Annual Syracuse St. Patrick's Parade in 2010. MacPherson died surrounded by his family at the Crouse Hospital in Syracuse, New York, on August 8, 2017, at the age of 86. ==Head coaching record== ===College=== ===NFL=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular Season !! colspan=\"4\"|Post Season |- !Won !!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!Won!!Lost!!Win %!!Result |- !NE||1991 ||6||10||0||||4th in AFC East|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- !NE||1992 ||2||14||0||||5th in AFC East|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- ! colspan=\"2\"| NE Total || 8 || 24 || 0 || |||| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Total || 8 || 24 || 0 || |||| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Dick MacPherson at Pro-Football-Reference.com * Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American football centers Category:American football linebackers Category:Cincinnati Bearcats football coaches Category:Illinois Fighting Illini football coaches Category:Maryland Terrapins football coaches Category:Syracuse Orange football coaches Category:UMass Minutemen football coaches Category:Cleveland Browns coaches Category:Denver Broncos coaches Category:New England Patriots head coaches Category:New England Patriots coaches Category:Springfield Pride football players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Old Town, Maine Category:Coaches of American football from Maine Category:Players of American football from Maine ",
