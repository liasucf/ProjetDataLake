Guy d'Hardelot (August 1858 \u2013 January 7, 1936) was the pen name of Helen Rhodes (n\u00e9e Helen Guy), a French composer, pianist, and teacher. == Biography == D'Hardelot was born Helen Guy, to an English father and a French mother. She was born at Ch\u00e2teau d'Hardelot, near Boulogne-sur-Mer. At the age of fifteen she went to Paris, where she studied at the Conservatoire de Paris under Marie Renaud-Maury (1852-1928) and came under the notice of Charles Gounod and Victor Maurel, who were much impressed with her ability. She also met Jules Massenet, who encouraged her to compose. On coming to London she became a pupil of Clarence Lucas. Emma Calv\u00e9 was a good friend to d'Hardelot, and did much to bring her songs into notice. Most of her life, d'Hardelot was engaged in teaching singing and diction at her home in London, and many of her pupils attained success. In 1896 she toured the United States with Calv\u00e9. Her first real success as a composer was won with \"Because\", though her song \"Sans Toi\" had previously been favorably received. Among her other successes may be mentioned \"I Know a Lovely Garden\", \"I Think\", \"I Hid My Love\", \"Dawn\", and \"A Bunch of Violets\". She was singularly successful as a writer of songs, in which she combined French delicacy with English solidity. Few women composers became more popular in the early 20th century than did d'Hardelot, and her success was won on merit alone. In spite of the help of many friends, it was some time before she achieved this success. Her sister Edith Dick was also a composer.\"Popular Lady Composers\" (Jul\u2013Dec 1895) Strand Musical Magazine p.251, London ==References== == Sources == (Original publication date: February 1911.) ==External links== * *Sheet music for \"All for you\", Cincinnati: The John Church Company, 1899, from the Alabama Sheet Music Collection Category:1858 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:19th-century classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:French classical composers Category:French female classical composers Category:Female classical composers Category:French people of English descent Category:19th-century French composers Category:20th-century French women musicians Category:French women classical pianists Category:French classical pianists Category:20th- century French composers Category:20th-century women composers Category:19th- century women composers ",
