    "text": "Alice Recoque (n\u00e9e Arnaud; born 1929) is a French computer scientist, computer engineer and computer architecture specialist. She worked on the designs of mini-computers in the 1970s and led research focused on artificial intelligence. == Early life == She was born in 1929 in Chechell, Algeria. She finished \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles in 1954 with a title of graduate engineer. == Career == Mitra 15 She started working at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9lectronique et d'automatisme (SAE) in 1954. At SAE she worked on core memories of CAB1101. In 1956 Alice Recoque and Fran\u00e7oise Becquet started designing the mini-computer CAB500 - the first conversational desktop computer. The computer was released in 1960. The CAB500 was a French low cost mini-computer, the purpose of which was to do complex, scientific calculations. After the merger of SAE and CAE, the Compagnie internationale pour l'informatique (CII) was born in 1966. She continued her work at CII when she worked on designing Mitra computers. The first design, Mitra 15, launched in 1972. Both the Mitra 15 and CAB500 were commercial successes in France. She led the Bull Group at CII. In 1985 the Bull Group focused on the research on highly parallel machines and artificial intelligence. During that period she helped develop the language KOOL (knowledge representation object-oriented language) with its implementation in LISP. She was a speaker at The European Association for microprocessing and microprogramming in August 1975. == Achievements == In 1979 she received the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite - Au grade de Chevalier. In 1985 she was promoted for the Officier de l'ordre national du M\u00e9rite.Journal Officiel du 10/08/1985 In 2016 she became an honor member of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 informatique de France. == References == Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:French women computer scientists Category:French computer scientists Category:People from Cherchell ",
