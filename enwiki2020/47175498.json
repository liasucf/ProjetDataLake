    "text": "Bryonympha is a monotypic moth genus in the family Immidae. Its only species, Bryonympha silvana, is found on Grande Comore of the Comoros in the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa. Both the genus and species were first described by Edward Meyrick in 1930. The wingspan is about 28 mm. The forewings are green, irregularly sprinkled with blackish with the costal edge whitish, on the basal fourth and a median spot dark grey. There are irregular ill-defined markings of black suffusion, consisting of some small spots near the base, costal spots at one-fourth and the middle and some marbling from three-fourths to near the apex, a vague streak from the first costal spot to the middle of the dorsum, a large blotch above the middle at two-thirds connected only by the black second discal stigma with a vague streak running to join the first streak on the middle of the dorsum, some marking towards the termen beneath the apex, and a spot on the tornus. The hindwings are dark grey.Meyrick, Edward (1930).
