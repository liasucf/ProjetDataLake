Snehalatha (Siva Reddy's daughter) sees this, falls for Indrasena, and tells him that she will marry him. The town has been suffering from drought. When one of the villagers tell Indrasena this, he goes to Chenna Kesava Reddy, previously a collector, and asks to build a reservoir because the poor don't have enough water supply. The government is unable to help because the place where the reservoir can be constructed is owned by Veera Shankar Reddy and his family who are not giving it up. Indrasena calls a meeting and asks them to hand over the land in exchange for whatever they want. The brothers ask for all of his property and a promise that he will leave the village while Snehalata asks Indrasena to marry her. Indrasena agrees and the reservoir is built. On the day of the wedding, unknown to Snehalata, her elder brother murders Indrasena's sisters and their husbands. In a state of rage, Indrasena goes on a rampage, killing three of the brothers. Snehalata swears revenge and sends her nephew, Veera Manohar Reddy, to seduce Indrasena's niece. Indrasena then returns to his village of Rayalaseema. Later Snehalata realizes the truth of her brother killing Indrasena's family by Veera Shankar Reddy's brother-in-law as she tells it to her brother, and asks Veera Manohar Reddy to go ahead and marry Indrasena's niece. Veera Shankar Reddy starts a chase for them as they go in the car and finally Indrasena battles all of them but does not kill Veera Shankar Reddy and suggests that they end the rivalry here only.
