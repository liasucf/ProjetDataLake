    "text": "The Dai Khitai () are a tribe of Hazara, found in Afghanistan. The Dai Khitai are often listed among the eight overarching Hazara tribes, though not among the five \"original tribes\". However, other resources list them as being among the \"real\" Hazara tribes, \"the Dai groups\", or as one of the \"original\" tribes. == Origin == Regardless of their position among the major groupings, the Dai Khitai are often seen as coming together with the Dai Chopan tribe to form the larger Uruzgani Hazara tribe. The Khitans were the Central Asian people, whose Liao dynasty in Southern Mongolia fell to a Jurchen invasion by the Jin Empire. Fleeing the Jurchen people, nomadic Khitans escaped west, settling in modern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan founding the Kara- Khitan Khanate. ==See also== *Hazara tribes *Hazara people *Dai Chopan ==References== Category:Hazara tribes ",
