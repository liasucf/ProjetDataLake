It was held at the Liverpool City Raceway in Sydney. The Final was easily won by six time World Champion Ivan Mauger who scored a 15-point maximum to win his second Australasian Championship. Surprisingly, Australia's leading riders Phil Crump and reigning Australian Champion Billy Sanders (who was actually riding on his home track) failed to qualify for the Overseas Final to be held at the White City Stadium in London, England.
