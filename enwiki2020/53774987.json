In 1870 Konstanty Zamoyski became the grounds' owner. The palace was built to architect Leonard Marconi's Renaissance Revival design. It comprises a main corpus and two perpendicular wings, to either side, flanking a courtyard. The driveway to Foksal Street is closed by a late-Baroque gate. During World War II, the palace was slightly damaged. In 1949 the building complex was transferred to the Association of Polish Architects (Stowarzyszenie Architekt\u00f3w Polskich). The palace has also housed the Association of Polish Painters and Graphic Artists (Zwi\u0105zek Polskich Artyst\u00f3w Malarzy i Grafik\u00f3w). The palace now houses the Association of Polish Architects, the Association of House Builders, and the restaurant and club Endorfina Foksal.
