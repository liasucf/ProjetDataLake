In November of that year, however, he agreed to a one-year deal with Swedish Football Division 2 club KSF Prespa Birlik. Bardhi played ten matches and scored five goals for the club during his spell, helping in their narrow escape from relegation. ===\u00dajpest=== In August 2014, Bardhi moved to Hungarian Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I club Ujpest on trial, and signed a three-year contract late in the month. ===Levante=== On 17 July 2017, Bardhi agreed to a three- year deal with La Liga side Levante UD for an estimated \u20ac1.5 million.

Bardhi desired to represent Albania, stating \"I do not believe there is an Albanian born in Skopje, with Albanian families, who would not want to play for Albania\". Redi Jupi, who was appointed as scouting manager for the Albanian Football Association, never approached Bardhi or respond to Bardhi's managers call out. With Macedonia showing genuine interest and Bardhi viewing the FSHF handling of the situation and response as unprofessional, accepted the call-up for Macedonia. However, Jetmir Salihu, a representative for the FSHF, dismissed Bardhi's claim, who unveiled all the messages between him and the player, replying that Bardhi was never interested to come to Albania in the first place. He also accused the player of trying to damage the image of Albanian Football Association with the aim to be seen as hero to Albanian people, stating: \"Since 2010 I've had hundreds of such cases, footballers that have refused the national team and at the end they came out with such statements because they want to make FSHF guilty so they can win the sympathy of Albanians.\" Bardhi represented Macedonia at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels before making his full international debut on 27 March 2015, coming on as a first-half substitute for Artim Polo\u017eani in a 1\u20132 UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying home loss against Belarus. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Prespa Birlik |2014 |Division 2 |10||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||10||5 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !10!!5!!0!!0!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!!0!!0!!10!!5 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|\u00dajpest |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"3\"|NB I |21||2||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0||29||2 |- |2015\u201316 |29||5||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||6 |- |2016\u201317 |29||12||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||13 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !79!!19!!12!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!3!!0!!94!!21 |- | rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\" |Levante |2017\u201318 | rowspan=\"3\" |La Liga |26||9||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||9 |- |2018\u201319 |36||3||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||38||3 |- |2019\u201320 |30 |7 |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |32 |7 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !92!!19!!8!!0!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!!0!!0!!100!!19 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career totals !181!!43!!20!!2!!0!!0!!4!!0!!205!!45 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Macedonia |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2015||4||0 |- |2016||2||0 |- |2017||5||1 |- |2018||8||2 |- |2019||6||2 |- !Total||25||5 |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list North Macedonia's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!
