    "text": "Pinheiros is a train station on CPTM Line 9-Emerald, with connection with ViaQuatro Line 4-Yellow. It is located in the district of Pinheiros in S\u00e3o Paulo. ==History== Pinheiros station was opened, with temporary installations, by Sorocaba Railway (EFS), along with the Jurubatuba branch, on 25 January 1957. The definitive installations were opened in 1958. In 1971, Fepasa incorporated EFS and began a modernization plan of the Jurubatuba branch. The station was considered of difficult access, because any passenger who leaves that station, had to, obligatorily, cross two ways of Marginal Pinheiros, one of the most crowded roads of the city, what caused many trampling cases. Pinheiros station was rebuilt, being reopened on 4 May 1981. The station was transferred to CPTM in 1996. To give more comfort to the commuters, specially commuters from Line 5-Lilac who use Line 9-Emerald to access Line 4-Yellow, CPTM does a special operation during peak hours, where this station is used as terminus, avoiding overcrowding in the trains. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1981 Category:1981 establishments in Brazil ",
