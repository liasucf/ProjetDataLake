    "text": "The mineral pyrite (), or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS2 (iron (II) disulfide). Pyrite is the most abundant sulfide mineral. Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold. The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle, and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal. The name pyrite is derived from the Greek (pyrit\u0113s lithos), \"stone or mineral which strikes fire\",. in turn from (pyr), \"fire\".. In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against steel; Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what we now call pyrite. By Georgius Agricola's time, , the term had become a generic term for all of the sulfide minerals. Pyrite under normal and polarized light Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulfides or oxides in quartz veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in fossils, but has also been identified in the sclerites of scaly-foot gastropods. Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. A substantial proportion of the gold is \"invisible gold\" incorporated into the pyrite (see Carlin-type gold deposit). It has been suggested that the presence of both gold and arsenic is a case of coupled substitution but as of 1997 the chemical state of the gold remained controversial. == Uses == An abandoned pyrite mine near Pernek in Slovakia Pyrite enjoyed brief popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries as a source of ignition in early firearms, most notably the wheellock, where a sample of pyrite was placed against a circular file to strike the sparks needed to fire the gun. Pyrite has been used since classical times to manufacture copperas (iron(II) sulfate). Iron pyrite was heaped up and allowed to weather (an example of an early form of heap leaching). The acidic runoff from the heap was then boiled with iron to produce iron sulfate. In the 15th century, new methods of such leaching began to replace the burning of sulfur as a source of sulfuric acid. By the 19th century, it had become the dominant method. Pyrite remains in commercial use for the production of sulfur dioxide, for use in such applications as the paper industry, and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Thermal decomposition of pyrite into FeS (iron(II) sulfide) and elemental sulfur starts at ; at around , pS2 is about . A newer commercial use for pyrite is as the cathode material in Energizer brand non-rechargeable lithium batteries. Pyrite is a semiconductor material with a band gap of 0.95 eV. Pure pyrite is naturally n-type, in both crystal and thin-film forms, potentially due to sulfur vacancies in the pyrite crystal structure acting as n-dopants. During the early years of the 20th century, pyrite was used as a mineral detector in radio receivers, and is still used by crystal radio hobbyists. Until the vacuum tube matured, the crystal detector was the most sensitive and dependable detector available\u2014with considerable variation between mineral types and even individual samples within a particular type of mineral. Pyrite detectors occupied a midway point between galena detectors and the more mechanically complicated perikon mineral pairs. Pyrite detectors can be as sensitive as a modern 1N34A germanium diode detector. Pyrite has been proposed as an abundant, non-toxic, inexpensive material in low-cost photovoltaic solar panels. Synthetic iron sulfide was used with copper sulfide to create the photovoltaic material. More recent efforts are working toward thin-film solar cells made entirely of pyrite. Pyrite is used to make marcasite jewelry. Marcasite jewelry, made from small faceted pieces of pyrite, often set in silver, was known since ancient times and was popular in the Victorian era. At the time when the term became common in jewelry making, \"marcasite\" referred to all iron sulfides including pyrite, and not to the orthorhombic FeS2 mineral marcasite which is lighter in color, brittle and chemically unstable, and thus not suitable for jewelry making. Marcasite jewelry does not actually contain the mineral marcasite. The specimens of pyrite, when it appears as good quality crystals, are used in decoration. They are also very popular in mineral collecting. Among the sites that provide the best specimens, highlights the exploited in Navaj\u00fan, La Rioja (Spain). China represents the main importing country with an import of around 376,000 tonnes, which resulted at 45% of total global imports. China is also the fastest growing in terms of the unroasted iron pyrites imports, with a CAGR of +27.8% from 2007 to 2016. In value terms, China ($47 million) constitutes the largest market for imported unroasted iron pyrites worldwide, making up 65% of global imports. ==Research== In July 2020 scientists reported that they have transformed the abundant diamagnetic material into a ferromagnetic one by inducing voltage, which may lead to applications in devices such as solar cells or magnetic data storage. Researchers at Trinity University Dublin, Ireland have demonstrated that FeS2 can be exfoliated into few-layers just like other two-dimensional layered materials such as graphene by a simple liquid-phase exfoliation route. This is the first study to demonstrate the production of non-layered 2D-platelets from 3D bulk FeS2. Furthermore, they have used these 2D-platelets with 20% single walled carbon-nanotube as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries, reaching a capacity of 1000 mAh/g close to the theoretical capacity of FeS2. ==Formal oxidation states for pyrite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite== From the perspective of classical inorganic chemistry, which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, pyrite is probably best described as Fe2+S22\u2212. This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S\u2013S bonds. These persulfide units can be viewed as derived from hydrogen disulfide, H2S2. Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide, not iron disulfide. In contrast, molybdenite, MoS2, features isolated sulfide (S2\u2212) centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo4+. The mineral arsenopyrite has the formula FeAsS. Whereas pyrite has S2 subunits, arsenopyrite has [AsS] units, formally derived from deprotonation of H2AsSH. Analysis of classical oxidation states would recommend the description of arsenopyrite as Fe3+[AsS]3\u2212. ==Crystallography== Crystal structure of pyrite. In the center of the cell a S22\u2212 pair is seen in yellow Iron-pyrite FeS2 represents the prototype compound of the crystallographic pyrite structure. The structure is simple cubic and was among the first crystal structures solved by X-ray diffraction. It belongs to the crystallographic space group Pa and is denoted by the Strukturbericht notation C2. Under thermodynamic standard conditions the lattice constant a of stoichiometric iron pyrite FeS2 amounts to . The unit cell is composed of a Fe face-centered cubic sublattice into which the ions are embedded. (Note though that the structure is simple cubic with four iron atoms per cubic unit cell, not face-centered cubic. The iron atoms in the faces are not equivalent by translation alone to the iron atoms at the corners.) The pyrite structure is also used by other compounds MX2 of transition metals M and chalcogens X = O, S, Se and Te. Also certain dipnictides with X standing for P, As and Sb etc. are known to adopt the pyrite structure. In the first bonding sphere, the Fe atoms are surrounded by six S nearest neighbours, towards six of the eight faces of a distorted octahedron. The material is a semiconductor and the Fe ions should be considered to be in a low spin divalent state (as shown by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy as well as XPS), rather than a tetravalent state as the stoichiometry would suggest. The material as a whole acts as a Van Vleck paramagnet, despite its low-spin divalency. The positions of X ions in the pyrite structure may be derived from the fluorite structure, starting from a hypothetical Fe2+(S\u2212)2 structure. Whereas F\u2212 ions in CaF2 occupy the centre positions of the eight subcubes of the cubic unit cell ( ) etc., the S\u2212 ions in FeS2 are shifted from these high symmetry positions along <111> axes to reside on (uuu) and symmetry-equivalent positions. Here, the parameter u should be regarded as a free atomic parameter that takes different values in different pyrite-structure compounds (iron pyrite FeS2: u(S) = 0.385). The shift from fluorite u = 0.25 to pyrite u = 0.385 is rather large and creates an S\u2013S distance that is clearly a binding one. This is not surprising as in contrast to F\u2212 an ion S\u2212 is not a closed shell species. It is isoelectronic with a chlorine atom, also undergoing pairing to form Cl2 molecules. Both low spin Fe2+ and the disulfide S22\u2212 moeties are closed shell entities, explaining the diamagnetic and semiconducting properties. The S atoms have bonds with three Fe and one other S atom. The site symmetry at Fe and S positions is accounted for by point symmetry groups C3i and C3, respectively. The missing center of inversion at S lattice sites has important consequences for the crystallographic and physical properties of iron pyrite. These consequences derive from the crystal electric field active at the sulfur lattice site, which causes a polarisation of S ions in the pyrite lattice. The polarisation can be calculated on the basis of higher-order Madelung constants and has to be included in the calculation of the lattice energy by using a generalised Born\u2013Haber cycle. This reflects the fact that the covalent bond in the sulfur pair is inadequately accounted for by a strictly ionic treatment. Arsenopyrite has a related structure with heteroatomic As\u2013S pairs rather than homoatomic ones. Marcasite also possesses homoatomic anion pairs, but the arrangement of the metal and diatomic anions is different from that of pyrite. Despite its name a chalcopyrite () does not contain dianion pairs, but single S2\u2212 sulfide anions. ==Crystal habit== Pyritohedron-shaped crystals from Italy Pyrite usually forms cuboid crystals, sometimes forming in close association to form raspberry-shaped masses called framboids. However, under certain circumstances, it can form anastamozing filaments or T-shaped crystals. Pyrite can also form shapes almost the same as a regular dodecahedral, known as pyritohedra, and this suggests an explanation for the artificial geometrical models found in Europe as early as the 5th century BC.The pyritohedral form is described as a dodecahedron with pyritohedral symmetry; Dana J. et al., (1944), System of mineralogy, New York, p 282 ==Varieties== Cattierite (CoS2) and vaesite (NiS2) are similar in their structure and belong also to the pyrite group. Bravoite is a nickel-cobalt bearing variety of pyrite, with > 50% substitution of Ni2+ for Fe2+ within pyrite. Bravoite is not a formally recognised mineral, and is named after the Peruvian scientist Jose J. Bravo (1874\u20131928).Mindat \u2013 bravoite. Mindat.org (2011-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-05-25. ==Distinguishing similar minerals== It is distinguishable from native gold by its hardness, brittleness and crystal form. Natural gold tends to be anhedral (irregularly shaped), whereas pyrite comes as either cubes or multifaceted crystals. Pyrite can often be distinguished by the striations which, in many cases, can be seen on its surface. Chalcopyrite is brighter yellow with a greenish hue when wet and is softer (3.5\u20134 on Mohs' scale).Pyrite on. Minerals.net (2011-02-23). Retrieved on 2011-05-25. Arsenopyrite is silver white and does not become more yellow when wet. ==Hazards== A pyrite cube (center) has dissolved away from a host rock, leaving behind trace gold Iron pyrite is unstable at Earth's surface: iron pyrite exposed to atmospheric oxygen and water decomposes into iron oxides and sulfate. This process is accelerated by the action of Acidithiobacillus bacteria which oxidize pyrite to produce ferrous iron, sulfate, and protons (). These reactions occur more rapidly when pyrite is finely dispersed (framboidal crystals initially formed by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in argillaceous sediments or dust from mining operations). ===Pyrite oxidation and acid mine drainage=== Sulfate released from decomposing pyrite combines with water, producing sulfuric acid, leading to acid mine drainage. An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill. :2FeS2{\\scriptstyle (s)} + 7O2{\\scriptstyle (g)} + 2H2O{\\scriptstyle (l)} -> 2Fe^{2+}{\\scriptstyle (aq)} + 4SO4^{2-}{\\scriptstyle (aq)} + 4H+{\\scriptstyle (aq)}.Acid Mine Drainage ===Dust explosions=== Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high- sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. The solution is to hermetically seal the mined-out areas to exclude oxygen. In modern coal mines, limestone dust is sprayed onto the exposed coal surfaces to reduce the hazard of dust explosions. This has the secondary benefit of neutralizing the acid released by pyrite oxidation and therefore slowing the oxidation cycle described above, thus reducing the likelihood of spontaneous combustion. In the long term, however, oxidation continues, and the hydrated sulfates formed may exert crystallization pressure that can expand cracks in the rock and lead eventually to roof fall. ===Weakened building materials=== Building stone containing pyrite tends to stain brown as pyrite oxidizes. This problem appears to be significantly worse if any marcasite is present.Bowles, Oliver (1918) The Structural and Ornamental Stones of Minnesota. Bulletin 663, United States Geological Survey, Washington. p. 25. The presence of pyrite in the aggregate used to make concrete can lead to severe deterioration as pyrite oxidizes. In early 2009, problems with Chinese drywall imported into the United States after Hurricane Katrina were attributed to pyrite oxidation, followed by microbial sulfate reduction which released hydrogen sulfide gas. These problems included a foul odor and corrosion of copper wiring.Angelo, William (28 January 2009) A Material Odor Mystery Over Foul-Smelling Drywall. Engineering News-Record.

EN 13242:2002 Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction certify such materials as free of pyrite. ==Pyritised fossils== Pyrite and marcasite commonly occur as replacement pseudomorphs after fossils in black shale and other sedimentary rocks formed under reducing environmental conditions. However, pyrite dollars or pyrite suns which have an appearance similar to sand dollars are pseudofossils and lack the pentagonal symmetry of the animal. ==Images== File:Bullypyrite2.jpg|As a replacement mineral in an ammonite from France File:Pyrite from Ampliaci\u00f3n a Victoria Mine, Navaj\u00fan, La Rioja, Spain 2.jpg|Pyrite from Ampliaci\u00f3n a Victoria Mine, Navaj\u00fan, La Rioja, Spain File:Pyrite-Tetrahedrite-Quartz-184642.jpg|Pyrite from the Sweet Home Mine, with golden striated cubes intergrown with minor tetrahedrite, on a bed of transparent quartz needles File:Pyrite-200582.jpg|Radiating form of pyrite File:Paraspirifer bownockeri.fond.jpg|Paraspirifer bownockeri in pyrite File:Fluorite-Pyrite- tmu38b.jpg|Pink fluorite perched between pyrite on one side and metallic galena on the other side File:Pyrite in pyrrhotite SEM image.png|SEM image of intergrowth of pyrite cuboctahedral crystals (yellow) and pyrrhotite (pinkish yellow) ==References== ==Further reading== * American Geological Institute, 2003, Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms, 2nd ed., Springer, New York, . * David Rickard, Pyrite: A Natural History of Fool's Gold, Oxford, New York, 2015, . ==External links== * Educational article about the famous pyrite crystals from the Navajun Mine * How Minerals Form and Change \"Pyrite oxidation under room conditions\". * Category:Disulfides Category:Firelighting Category:Pyrite group Category:Iron(II) minerals Category:Cubic minerals Category:Sulfide minerals Category:Alchemical substances Category:Semiconductor materials Category:Transition metal dichalcogenides ",
