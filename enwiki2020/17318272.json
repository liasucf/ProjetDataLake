He was born in Herefordshire. As part of Gen. James Edward Oglethorpe's 42nd (old) Regiment of Foot, he commanded Georgia's Northern Company of Marines during the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739\u201348). He was the father of Noble Wimberly Jones, a physician, Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, and prominent leader of the Georgia patriots during the American Revolution. Noble Jones established the Wormsloe Plantation eight miles from Savannah in the late 1730s.
