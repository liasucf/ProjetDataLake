    "text": "Index Seminum meaning in Latin \"seed index\", is a catalog of seeds of wild or cultivated plants offered free of charge or in exchange of seeds of equivalent value by botanical gardens or arboretums. It is published annually or biennially by these institutions, traditionally in A5 format (148 \u00d7 210 mm). Seeds presented in Index Seminum are readily available and kept in seed banks. More than 1000 institutions from 48 countries publish Index Seminum with the intention of establishing a free and fare exchange. Juan Armada El Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Madrid (1755-2005): ciencia, colecci\u00f3n y escuela 245 pages, Lunwerg, 2005, , The exchange of seeds and spores constitutes one of the main ways of increasing the living collections of the Botanical Gardens, and is also a way of obtaining material for the development of research work. == Components of an Index Seminum == Generally there are several items that are included in the listings: * Complete botanical garden references, name, address, etc. * A concise but complete presentation of the botanical garden. * The general climatology of the botanical garden referred to. * Geographical location of the botanical garden. * A page of information explaining useful services related to the operation of the activity related to seeds. * A list of the plant s of the towns near the botanical garden. * Occasionally, a list of available species brought from tropical or other locations. * A bibliography of the reference works. * Sometimes a list of the people dedicated to caring for the seedbed and exchanges is attached. The classification of plant species is made by alphabetical order of the families to which they belong, and another by genus. The seeds collected in the botanical garden itself must have a separate classification. It is important that the origin of the seeds is well specified, clarifying whether they were collected outside or inside the botanical garden itself. == History == Tradition of collecting and exchanging seeds dates back to XVIII century. The first Index seminum is the Viridarium Florentinum published by Saverio Manetti, director of the Orto Botanico di Firenze, in 1751. In XXI century this tradition is reexamined in the context of the conservation of biodiversity and the fight against invasive species. In terms of nomenclature, the old Index Seminum are precious because they sometimes contain the description of new species such as Telanthera bettzickiana, described in 1862 by Eduard August von Regel in the Index Seminum of the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden Telanthera bettzickiana International Plant Names Index. In Spain The preparation of the catalog of the seeds available in a botanical garden is a traditional activity, which began in Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and has remained in the same conditions to this day. In 1800 Casimiro G\u00f3mez Ortega published the first Index Seminum G\u00f3mez Ortega, Casimiro (1800), Index seminum plantarum, quae in R. Matr. H. desiderantur, anno MDCCC., Madrid: Royal Botanical Garden. 12 pp. of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid. The Botanical Garden of Valencia published its first seed catalog in 1862. Every year the Ibero-Marcaronesic Network of Botanical Gardens offers the Index Seminum pro mutual commutatione of the twenty one gardens associated with this network. The Index Seminum of the University Botanical Garden of Granada in Sierra Nevada offers the seeds of the 1980s endemisms of the Sierra. == References == == External links == === Conservation International === * The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) * The global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture * The World Heritage Convention * The convention on the conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) * The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) * Habitats and Species Directive 92/43 / EEC * The Pan-European Biodiversity and Landscape Diversity Strategy * The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance * The European Community Biodiversity Strategy * UNESCO Man and the Biosphere program (MAB) === In Spain === * Ministry of the Environment * Bulletin of the Plants Commission of the Spanish Committee of IUCN * Royal Decree 1997/1995 on biodiversity * Micro-reserves capture Valencia\u2019s special flora * Conservation within the Community Category:Botanical gardens ",
