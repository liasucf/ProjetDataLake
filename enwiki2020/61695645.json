    "text": "Motuaiko Island is an island within Lake Taupo on the North Island of New Zealand. The lake's largest island, it sits near the town of Motutere. ==Natural features== Motutaiko is formed out of a column of rhyolitic lava, connected to the geologic systems of Lake Taupo. The island was likely formed after an underwater magma vent's releases cooled and hardened into a cone, with Motutaiko forming the apex. Several endangered species live on the island, including Wainuia clarki. Other animals present on the island include small skinks and a colony of cormorants. ==Maori tradition== The island is spiritually significant to the M\u0101ori people, and landing on the island is therefore prohibited by the government. Rangituamatotoru, a major chief of the Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa, was buried in a sacred cave on the island in the 18th century. The taniwha of Lake Taupo, Horomatangi, is said to live in a cave on the island's northeastern face. The creature is also said to be the pet of Ng\u0101toro-i-rangi. ==References== Category:Islands of Waikato Category:Volcanic islands Category:Taupo District Category:M\u0101ori mythology ",
