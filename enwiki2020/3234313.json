    "text": "PEDOT Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT or PEDT; IUPAC name poly(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxane-5,7-diyl)) is a conducting polymer based on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene or EDOT. It was reported in 1991. ==Polymer== Advantages of this polymer are optical transparency in its conducting state, high stability and moderate band gap and low redox potential. A large disadvantage is poor solubility, which is partly circumvented in the PEDOT:PSS composite, and the PEDOT-TMA material. Applications of PEDOT include electrochromic displays, antistatics, photovoltaics, electroluminescent displays, printed wiring, sensors, and potentially interfacing electronic hardware with human tissue. The polymer is generated by oxidation. This process begins with production of the radical cation of EDOT monomer, [C2H4O2C4H2S]+. This cation attacks a neutral EDOT followed by deprotonation. The idealized conversion using peroxydisulfate is shown :n C2H4O2C4H2S + n (OSO3)22\u2212 \u2192 [C2H4O2C4S]n \\+ 2n HOSO3\u2212 For commercial purposes, the polymerization is conducted in the presence of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). The resulting composites, PEDOT coatings are deposited on a conductive support (platinum, gold, glassy carbon, indium tin oxide, etc.) in organic solvents or in aqueous suspensions. ==Uses== Pedot has been proposed for use in biocompatible interfaces. ==Further reading== * * * ==References== ==External links== Category:Organic polymers Category:Organic semiconductors Category:Transparent electrodes Category:Conductive polymers ",
