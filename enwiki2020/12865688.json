    "text": "Nacona (Greek: ), was a small Greek town of Sicily mentioned only by Stephanus of Byzantium, who cites Philistus as his authority. The accuracy of the name is, however, confirmed by coins, the earliest of which bear the legend \"NAKONAION\", while those of later date have \"\u039d\u0391\u039a\u03a9\u039d\u0391\u0399\u03a9\u039d\". From one of the latter we learn that the town had been occupied by the Campanians, apparently at the same period with Aetna and Entella.James Millingen, Ancient Coins, pp. 33-35; Sestini, Lett.
