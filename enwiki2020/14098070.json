Fisher, owner of KPRO in Riverside, California \u2014 for $385,000. The new owner changed the station's call sign to KPRD in March 1983.

The following April, the station adopted the KSZL call letters. In December 1998, First American sold KSZL and FM sister stations KDUC and KDUQ to Pleasant Gap, Pennsylvania-based Tele-Media Broadcasting LLC for $875,000.
