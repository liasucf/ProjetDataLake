    "text": "Geotomus punctulatus also known as the Cornish shieldbug, is a species of burrowing bug in the family Cydnidae, found in Europe. ==Description== A small black shieldbug, 3.5 mm to 4.5 mm in length, with sparse, long hairs around the head, forewings and pronotum. The corium and rear margin of the pronotum often has reddish markings. It feeds on lady's bedstraw (Galium verum) in sparsely vegetated areas of loose sand in sand dunes. ==Distribution and status== The species is widely distributed in the southern Palaearctic from Great Britain to Japan. In Great Britain it has been found in the towans at Whitesand Bay, near Sennen Cove, Cornwall for over one hundred years and two specimens were taken from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan in the 19th-century. The population is not known but probably numbers in the hundreds rather than thousands. In 1962 it was present \u2033in considerable numbers\u2033 and on 31 May 1882 it was numerous. This location is above a popular beach so is under threat from excessive public pressure. ==References== Category:Cydnidae Category:Hemiptera of Asia Category:Hemiptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1847 Category:Penwith Category:Taxa named by Achille Costa ",
