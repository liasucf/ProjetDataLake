This marks another step in moving from a slow pace to the Baucom-led uptempo style of play. At least one player changed his plans as a result of a photo that surfaced on social media which showed cadets dressed as ghosts, but widely interpreted as similar to Ku Klux Klan garb. == Roster == ==Schedule and results== The Citadel travelled to play opponents in the Pac-12, Big 12, and ACC, and host an exempt tournament to be known as the Holy City Hoops Classic. |- ! colspan=8 style=|Exhibition |- ! colspan=8 style=|Non-conference regular season |- ! colspan=8 style=|SoCon regular season |- ! colspan=8 style=|SoCon Tournament ==References== Category:The Citadel Bulldogs basketball seasons Citadel Category:2017 in sports in South Carolina Category:2016 in sports in South Carolina ",
