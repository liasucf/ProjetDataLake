    "text": "The 1977\u201378 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team represented the University of Illinois. ==Regular season== The most significant recruit in the three years of Head Coach Lou Henson's tenure at Illinois came prior to the 1978-79 season. Eddie Johnson was considered to be the most significant piece to reviving the Illini basketball program, a program that had not been to a post-season tournament for 16 years. Johnson, who played at Chicago Westinghouse High School, was one of the state's top senior and a Parade Magazine All-American. During his senior year at Westinghouse, Johnson, along with teammate Mark Aguirre, became part of a team that went 29-0, losing only in the Public League Final to Wendell Phillips. Prior to choosing Illinois, Johnson visited Southern Cal, Iowa, Michigan and DePaul, but with the encouragement of assistant coach Tony Yates, he selected Illinois. Along with Johnson, Henson recruited Mark Smith from Peoria Richwoods High School. By season's end, Smith would develop into the team's second leading scorer, finishing the season with 312 points. The team's starting lineup included Neil Bresnahan and Levi Cobb as forwards, Audie Matthews and Reno Gray at the guard positions, and Rich Adams playing center. ===Roster=== SourceMen's Basketball Roster All-Time Illini Rosters ==Schedule== SourceUniversity of Illinois Fighting Illini Statistics Summary for 1977-78 , FightingIllini.com |- !colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season |- !colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season |- ==Player stats== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"\"| Player !style=\"\"| Games Played !style=\"\"| Minutes Played !style=\"\"| Field Goals !style=\"\"| Free Throws !style=\"\"| Rebounds !style=\"\"| Assists !style=\"\"| Blocks !style=\"\"| Steals !style=\"\"| Points |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Audie Matthewspg. 119 Season Stats||27||780||136||55||87||50||0||12||327 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Mark Smithpg. 119 Season Stats||27||680||111||90||163||36||7||37||312 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Rich Adamspg. 119 Season Stats ||27||618||108||58||133||37||32||25||274 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Eddie Johnsonpg. 119 Season Stats||27||469||100||20||84||16||8||11||220 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Rob Judsonpg. 119 Season Stats ||27||605||76||45||49||57||1||20||197 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Neil Bresnahanpg. 119 Season Stats ||27||670||94||31||195||68||2||21||219 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Reno Graypg. 119 Season Stats ||20||434||90||6||29||66||1||18||186 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Levi Cobbpg. 119 Season Stats||27||610||72||28||131||23||10||17||172 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Mike Jones ||27||232||35||2||16||20||2||8||72 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Ken Ferdinand ||15||80||13||5||18||2||2||2||31 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Larry Lubin ||17||112||8||8||9||19||0||6||24 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Tom Gerhardt ||21||105||4||2||22||3||0||1||10 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Matt Meyer ||6||5||0||0||1||1||0||0||0 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |} ==Awards and honors== * Eddie Johnson **Fighting Illini All-Century team (2005) *Audie Matthews **Team Most Valuable Player List of MVPs ==Team players drafted into the NBA== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"500\" |- !style=\"\"| Player !style=\"\"| NBA Club !style=\"\"| Round !style=\"\"| Pick |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Rich Adams||San Antonio Spurs||4||86 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Audie Matthews||Detroit Pistons||6||117 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |}1978 NBA Draft ==Rankings== ==References== Illinois Fighting Illini Category:Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball seasons Category:1977 in sports in Illinois Category:1978 in sports in Illinois ",
