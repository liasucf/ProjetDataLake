    "text": "Selenopidae, also called wall crab spiders, wall spiders and flatties, is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1897. It contains over 280 species in nine genera, of which Selenops is the most well- known. This family is just one of several families whose English name includes the phrase \"crab spider\". They are a variety of colors, including shades of grey, brown, yellow, and orange, with darker markings on the cephalothorax and spots or mottling on the abdomen, and annulations on the legs of most species. They are very flat dorsoventrally, and have two tarsal claws and laterigrade legs. Their running and striking speeds place them among the world\u2019s fastest animals, making them difficult to capture, while their coloring often makes them difficult to see. Like most other Entelegynae, they have eight eyes arranged in two rows; one with six and one with two. They occur worldwide, from sea level to over , and are primarily tropical and subtropical, though several species are found in deserts. They are commonly found on walls or under rocks. Selenops is the most widely distributed and Anyphops is found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. The remaining genera have more specific distributions. At least one (possibly extinct) species of Garcorops, G. jadis, is known only from subfossil copal. ==Genera== , the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera: *Amamanganops Crews & Harvey, 2011 \u2014 Philippines *Anyphops Benoit, 1968 \u2014 Africa *Garcorops Corronca, 2003 \u2014 Comoros, Madagascar *Godumops Crews & Harvey, 2011 \u2014 Papua New Guinea *Hovops Benoit, 1968 \u2014 Madagascar *Karaops Crews & Harvey, 2011 \u2014 Australia *Makdiops Crews & Harvey, 2011 \u2014 India, Nepal *Selenops Latreille, 1819 \u2014 Asia, North America, Caribbean, South America, Africa, Central America *Siamspinops Dankittipakul & Corronca, 2009 \u2014 Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan ==See also== * List of Selenopidae species ==References== ==External links== Category:Araneomorphae families ",
