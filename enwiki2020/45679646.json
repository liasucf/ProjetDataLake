    "text": "Glad All Over is the debut studio album by the English rock band the Dave Clark Five. Epic Records released the album in March 1964 in the United States to capitalize on the success of the albums' title track by the same name, and despite the caption saying \"Featuring Bits and Pieces\", the single did not become a hit until two months later. The album contains some of their hit songs like \"Glad All Over\", \"Bits and Pieces\" and \"Do You Love Me\". In Canada, it was released as Bits and Pieces on Capitol Records. ==Reception== In his AllMusic retrospective review of the release, Richie Unterberger wrote \"The Dave Clark Five's first album might seem a bit on the meager side outside of the context of the first flush of the British Invasion. At the time, though, it was a pretty exuberant slab o' vinyl that rocked pretty hard for the most part, paced by the three Top 10 singles \"Glad All Over,\" \"Do You Love Me,\" and \"Bits and Pieces.\" And it does have a few decent, though not great, original songs that don't show up on greatest hits compilations: the solid pop/rocker \"I Know You,\" the raucous \"Twist and Shout\" rip-off \"No Time to Lose,\" and the surprisingly savage instrumental \"Chaquita,\" an inversion of \"Tequila\" with its snaky, growling guitar riffs and dirty sax. There's also some pure filler, like the jazzy instrumental \"Time\" and the infantile \"Doo Dah.\" It certainly ranks among their best non-greatest-hits albums, which isn't as high a recommendation as it sounds, since the group's LPs weren't that good overall.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== The Dave Clark Five *Dave Clark: backing vocals *Mike Smith: keyboards, lead vocals *Lenny Davidson: guitars, backing vocals *Rick Huxley: bass guitar, backing vocals *Denis Payton: saxophone, backing vocals * Bobby Graham: drums ==References== Category:The Dave Clark Five albums Category:1964 debut albums Category:EMI Columbia Records albums Category:Epic Records albums ",
