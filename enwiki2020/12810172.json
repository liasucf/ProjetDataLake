The company made headlines in several major newspapers in Sweden in March 2009 when a consultant hired through a recruitment company was fired because he, outside work, had expressed political views belonging to the Pirate Party in a public chat interview organized by the newspaper Nerikes Allehanda. == References == Category:Computer companies of Norway Category:Telenor Category:2010 disestablishments in Norway ",
