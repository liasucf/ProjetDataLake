The creative process was heavily influenced by other post-hardcore musical groups the Fall of Troy and Hot Cross, and was dubbed \"a sort of paradigm shift in the way post-hardcore can be played, combining a progressive hammer-on-pull-off heavy style of guitar playing and more free range drumming with a huge decrease in riffage, conventional time signatures and simplistic song structures resulted in a spastic, technically savvy sound which fit right in with the high energy mood and feel post- hardcore was known for.\" ===2014\u201317: Wake, Culture Scars, and Secret Wars EP=== After three years of extensive touring, Hail the Sun became acquainted with Sacramento, California-based post-hardcore band Dance Gavin Dance, eventually signing to Will Swan's independent record label Blue Swan Records.

Speaking about the band's third album, Culture Scars, guitarist Shane Gann said \"Culture Scars is a term we came up with to refer to those scars, both physical and emotional, that come about due to certain things that society deems as normal and acceptable. We don\u2019t normally put much thought into the amount of pain that may be caused by dirty politics, found within a family with a 'problem child', or existing behind the scenes of an adult entertainment shoot. These themes are so commonplace in the world, and yet there is often so much trauma and hurt that is brought about by all these scenarios. We wanted to shed some light on the darker side of what we think of as normalcy.\" On November 8, 2017, Hail the Sun released the single \"1109\" and announced their extended play (EP), Secret Wars, which was released on November 10, 2017. ===2018: Mental Knife=== On January 2, 2018, Hail the Sun published a statement confirming that they were recording their upcoming fourth studio album with producer Beau Burchell of American post-hardcore band Saosin.
