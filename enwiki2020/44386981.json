    "text": "Lake St. Martin First Nation is a First Nations government and Treaty 2 signatory. The First Nation was based primarily at Lake St. Martin about northwest of Winnipeg until May 2011. When a massive flood hit Manitoba, the Government of Manitoba decided to divert water to Lake St. Martin in order to protect cottage, and agricultural properties on other bodies of water. As a result all the housing at Lake St. Martin First Nation was destroyed. As of 2019, approximately 1,000 flood evacuees are still displaced. ==Reserves== *The Narrows 49 *The Narrows 49A ==References== Category:First Nations governments in Manitoba ",
