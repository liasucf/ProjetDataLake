In 1752 the center of trade was given the rights of doing business with national goods. From the beginning of the 19th century, \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand, was a lively export harbor for lumber, of which most was exported to the Netherlands. By the end of the sail ship era, the trade stagnated. The municipality was founded as \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand formannskapsdistrikt in 1837. Merchant and ship owner Anders Riddervold was elected as the first mayor. Dating from the 1880s, the town had been increasingly known as an important center for artists and painters. A number of internationally noted painters has either visited or lived in the town including Edvard Munch, Christian Krogh and Hans Heyerdahl. In 1898 Edvard Munch bought a house in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand where he spent the first of many summers. The house is now operated as a small museum which is associated with the Vestfold Museum (Vestfoldmuseene). Since the 1920s \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand has been a popular vacation and recreational spot. Visitors come to the small town each summer and spend their holidays in one of the four hotels. From 2007, the town has had the classification of a Tourist Town, which gives the shop owners in the oldest part closest to the sea the right to keep open every day of the week. In order to become a Tourist Town the number of visitors needs to greatly exceed the number of residents throughout the year. In June every year, \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand celebrates Midsummer - the longest day of the year - with a large fire on the shore. ==Notable people from \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand== Edvard Munch's house *Hans Anton Apeness (1842\u20131930), lumber merchant born in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand.
