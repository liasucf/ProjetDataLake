    "text": "Br\u00e4us (or Brus) is an old Swedish card game from the island of Gotland that differs from all others in that not all cards are actually playable.Smith (1993), pp. 36/37 The game is descended from the oldest known card game in Europe, Karn\u00f6ffel, a fact testified by its unusual card ranking and lack of a uniform trump suit.Br\u00e4us regler at kortspelonline.se. Retrieved 21 May 2019. Br\u00e4us is designed for four players and is played with 36 cards of a French pack, each of the four suits comprising the cards 6-10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. However, only 22 of these cards may be played. == Background == Br\u00e4us is one of a family of games descended from Karn\u00f6ffel, the oldest European card game with a continuous tradition of play down to the present day.Dummett (1981), p. 130 These games are characterised by \"the wildly disturbed ranking order in the chosen suit and particularly by the special role of the chosen Seven.\"McLeod (1996), pp. 54/55 Close relatives include Russian Bruzbart or Dulya, Livonian Brusbart, Polish Dru\u017cbart, Danish and Estonian Brus and Greenlandic Voormsi. More distant cousins include Faroese St\u00fdrivolt and Schleswig Kn\u00fcffeln.Smith (1997), pp. 45-51 Gotland is a Swedish island in the Baltic Sea that has been ruled at various times in history by the Danes and the Teutonic Knights, among others. It has been Swedish since 1645. The game of Br\u00e4us is one of a family of games played in the Baltic region and Scandinavia that descend from Karn\u00f6ffel, a card game that has been recorded since 1426. Gotland is the only place in Sweden where Br\u00e4us is still played. It underwent a brief revival in the 1980s possibly due to the \"touristic rediscovery of folklore and customs\", and has remained popular enough that an annual Br\u00e4us world championship is still held. It is still being actively taught.Bli bekant med Br\u00e4us\u2019n.

Not all the cards are playable. The playable cards rank as follows, from highest to lowest: * - Spit or Spiten * - Dull or Dullen * - Br\u00e4us or Br\u00e4usen * Nines * Aces * Jacks * Sixes The three highest cards\u2014Spit, Dull and Br\u00e4us\u2014are called matadors (makdoros). The Nines, Aces, Jacks, and Sixes rank among themselves in suit order, for example the beats the , , and , but any Ace is beaten by any Nine. The Sevens only have power if they are led, when they count individually as a trick. The remaining 14 cards are 'unplayable cards' or 'duds'\u2014they serve to pad out the players' hands but have no value or to \"randomise the distribution of playable cards.\" The is known as the pl\u00e5gu or \"torment\" because it may force an opponent to play a matador rather than hold it back. The is called grodballen or \"frog's testicles.\" == Rules == In Br\u00e4us, there are always two teams. If four play, partners sit opposite one another; if six play, the team players sit alternately. The overall aim is to win six 'strokes' (game points) for the game. In each deal the aim is to win six tricks. === Dealing === The dealer shuffles the cards before offering them to his right for cutting. He then deals the cards individually and in clockwise order. If four play, each receives nine cards; if six play, each player gets six cards. === Playing === Forehand (the player to the left of the dealer) begins by laying out any Sevens he holds, each Seven counting by itself as a trick. He then leads a playable or 'live' card. The other players follow in clockwise order by playing a higher card if possible; otherwise they pass. They may never discard. The player who has played the highest card wins the trick. The trick winner then plays any Sevens he has and leads a playable card. If he can do neither, he passes and the lead transfers to the player on his left. Play continues until one team takes six tricks. If a team has five tricks and the King of Clubs, they may count it as a sixth trick. If neither side takes six tricks, it is a draw and the same dealer deals again. === Scoring === One point is scored for winning six tricks. If the winners score 6\u20130, they have made Jan and score 2 points. Game is six points. == Footnotes == == References == == Literature == * * Dummett, Michael (1978).
