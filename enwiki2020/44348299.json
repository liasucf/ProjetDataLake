He also decorated a number of Danish churches with paintings and frescos. ==Biography== Born in Allerslev near Lejre in northwestern Zealand, S\u00f8ndergaard studied painting at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1898 to 1900. He completed his education at Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler under Kristian Zahrtmann in 1902. S\u00f8ndergaard was a versatile artist, remembered for his portraits and landscapes of the countryside around Roskilde. His paintings reveal his association with his friend L.A. Ring, especially his winter scenes with stooping figures shovelling snow. For his Roskilde Fjord ved Marb\u00e6k, he received the Eckersberg Medal in 1945. Other notable works are Kirken og smedjen i Jystrup and Snekasten, Jystrup, both painted in the early 1930s. Another important aspect of S\u00f8ndergaard's work was church decoration. On assignments for the National Museum of Denmark, he participated in the restoration of frescos in the churches of Lyngby, Ballerup, M\u00e5l\u00f8v, Vallensved and Vallensb\u00e6k, as well as the cathedrals of Aarhus and Roskilde. He also decorated a number of Danish churches including the Church of Our Saviour, Esbjerg, (1929), St John's, Vejle, (1934), Jerslev Church (1944), and the apse vault of Sct Nikolai Church in Holb\u00e6k (1930). ==Awards== In 1945, S\u00f8ndergaard was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1952, the Thorvaldsen Medal. ==References== Category:1876 births Category:1958 deaths Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:Danish landscape painters Category:People from Lejre Municipality Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni ",
