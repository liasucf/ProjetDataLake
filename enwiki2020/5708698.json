It is also known as the giant warthog. ==Description== Restoration Metridiochoerus was a large animal, in length, resembling a giant warthog. It had two large pairs of tusks which were pointed sideways and curved upwards. Based on the complicated, knobbly pattern of the creature's molars, Metridiochoerus is considered to have been an omnivore. ==References== *Barry Cox, Colin Harrison, R.J.G.
