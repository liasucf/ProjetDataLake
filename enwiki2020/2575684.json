Her maternal grandfather was Field Marshal Sir Lintorn Simmons.Benewick, Robert, Political Violence and Public Order, London: Allan Lane, 1969, p. 27. The Orman family would adopt the surname of Lintorn-Orman in 1912. Rotha Orman, with her friend Nesta Maude, was among the few girls who showed up at the 1909 Crystal Palace Scout Rally wanting to be Scouts which led to the foundation of the Girl Guides. In 1908 they had registered as a Scout troop, using their initials rather than forenames. In 1911 she was awarded one of the first of the Girl Guides' Silver Fish Awards.District History: Pre-1950, Liphook District Guides In the First World War, Lintorn-Orman served as a member of the Women's Volunteer Reserve and with the Scottish Women's Hospital Corps.M. Durham, 'Britain', K. Passmore (ed.), Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe 1919\u201345, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003, p. 216. She was decorated for her contribution at the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917Thurlow, Richard, Fascism in Britain, London: IB Tauris, 1998 but invalided home with malaria. In 1918 she became head of the British Red Cross Motor School to train drivers in the battlefield.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 85. In these early years she developed a strong sense of British nationalism, and became a staunch monarchist and imperialist. ==Fascism== Following Lintorn-Orman's war service, she placed an advertisement in the right-wing journal The Patriot seeking anti-communists.Durham, 'Britain', p. 215 This led to the foundation of the British Fascisti (later the British Fascists) in 1923 as a response to the growing strength of the Labour Party, a source of great anxiety for the virulently anti-Communist Lintorn-Orman.Thurlow, Fascism in Britain, p. 34 She felt Labour was too prone to advocating class conflict and internationalism, two of her pet hates.J.A. Cole, Lord Haw-Haw: The Full Story of William Joyce, Faber & Faber, 1987, p. 29 Nicholas Mosley would claim that she got the idea to save Britain from communism one day while she was weeding her kitchen garden.Nicholas Mosley, Rules of the Game: Sir Oswald and Lady Cynthia Mosley 1896\u20131933, Fontana, 1983, , p. 229 Emblem of the British Fascists Financed by her mother Blanch, Lintorn-Orman's party nonetheless struggled due to her preference for remaining within the law and her continuing ties to the fringes of the Conservative Party. Lintorn-Orman was essentially a Tory by inclination but was driven by a strong anti-communism and attached herself to fascism largely because of her admiration for Benito Mussolini and what she saw as his action- based style of politics.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, p. 86 The party was subject to a number of schisms, such as when the moderates led by R. B. D. Blakeney defected to the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies during the 1926 General Strike or when the more radical members resigned to form the National Fascisti, and ultimately lost members to the Imperial Fascist League and the British Union of Fascists when these groups emerged. For her part Lintorn-Orman would have nothing to do with the BUF as she considered Oswald Mosley to be a near-communistS.

G. Harnett, who sought to breathe new life into the group by seeking to ally it with Ulster loyalism.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, p. 92 She died at the age of 40 on 10 March 1935 at Santa Br\u00edgida, Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, with her organisation all but defunct. Her body was buried at Las Palmas' 'English Cemetery'.Entry for Rotha Lintorn-Orman in the Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/150969653/rotha-lintorn-orman ==Bibliography== *'Feminine Fascism': Women in Britain's Fascist Movement, Julie V.
