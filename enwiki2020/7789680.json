It is also connected by Shatuozi Border Road bridge to the Chinese city of Hunchun in the Yanbian autonomous prefecture. ==History== Under Joseon period Kyongwon was invaded by Jurchens tribes in 1409. Therefore, to safeguard his people from the hostile Chinese and Jurchen people (later known as Manchus) living in Manchuria, King Sejong the Great of Joseon ordered to establish there one of the six post/garrisons (hangul :\uc721\uc9c4 hanja :\u516d\u93ad) in 1433. In 1977 the county's name was changed to Saebyol, but it was later reverted. ==Administrative divisions== Kyongwon County is divided into 1 town (\"\u016dp\") 21 villages (\"ri\") and 3 worker's districts (\"rodongjagu\", abbreviated as \"gu\"). {| |valign=\"top\"| *Ky\u014fngw\u014fn-\u016dp () *Hamy\u014fl-lodongjagu () *Kog\u014fnw\u014fl-lodongjagu () *Ryongbung-rodongjagu () *Anw\u014fl-li () *Chongsal-li () *Chung'y\u014fng-ri () *Hunyung-ri () *Hus\u014fng-ri () *K\u016dmdong-ri () *Nongp'o-ri () *Pongsal-li () *Ryangdong-ri () |valign=\"top\"| *Ryongdang-ri () *Ryonggye-ri () *Ryonghy\u014fl-li () *Ryongmul-li () *Ryongnam-ri () *Ryongsil-li () *Ryudas\u014fm-ri () *Sasu-ri () *Sing\u014fl-li () *Songnae-ri () *Tongrim-ri () *Y\u014fnsal-li () |} Note: The Korean syllabe \"som\" (\uc12c) in Ryudasom-ri, is converted into hanja \"do\" \u5cf6 because both of them means island in that case. ==See also== *North Hamgyong *Geography of North Korea *Administrative divisions of North Korea ==External links== *Location of the four forts and the six posts * ==References== Category:Counties of North Hamgyong ",
