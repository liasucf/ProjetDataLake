    "text": "Ugo Mochi (pronounced 'Mokey') (1889-1977) was a 20th-century illustrator, sculptor and designer whose artistic abilities working with the silhouette earned him worldwide notoriety as the greatest living exponent of 'Shadows in Outline'.Alton Tobey \u2013 \"Ugo Mochi: Shadows in Outline\" \"He took the idea of the silhouette in new and original directions, beyond the arena of the simple profile. His illustrations adorned the pages of Women\u2019s Home Companion, Collier\u2019s, and American. He sold works to the Duke and Duchess of York, Windsor Castle, and ex-King Manuel of Portugal. Mochi is represented in public and private collections including The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Berlin Museum of Natural History.\" (from unpublished book by David Alexander, The Illustrated History of 20th Century Silhouettes and Guide to Collectibles). He was famous as an animal silhouettist. His most impressive accomplishment was the series of 14 panels created for the American Museum of Natural History. There is a website dedicated to his life and work. ==Biography== Mochi was born on 11 March 1889 in Florence, Italy. At a young age he began to display an interest in animals which he displayed through various mediums of art. At age 6 he first began to cut out his figures from simple white paper, using matchboxes and toothpicks to build miniature wagons pulled by cardboard horses he had drawn and cut out himself. At age 8 he took lessons from a Florentine painter; when he was ten, he enrolled in Florence\u2019s Fine Arts Academy, where he studied sculpting, anatomy, and drawing. After a series of tragic events in his life \u2013 his father and his mother died within a few months from each other, between 1903 and 1904 \u2013 Mochi moved to Milan and later, in 1909, to Germany. In those years, he illustrated books, postcards, and decor items. He often went to the Berlin zoo and portrayed animals with his cutouts, but also sang at caf\u00e9s and beer taverns. In the 1920s, he continued to pursue his passion for singing and, once back in Italy, performed under the stage name \u201cSignore Fiorentino\u201d. Meanwhile, his paper silhouettes gained growing success, and he continued to produce them for clients as important as noted Italian brands Campari and Pirelli.[https://www.italianways.com/animals-by-ugo-mochi-the-poet-of-shadows/ In 1928, Mochi and his wife \u2013 an opera singer \u2013 moved to the United States and settled in New Rochelle, New York, where he lived for the rest of his life. During the Second World War, in 1941-1943, he created the Ladies of the White House series, commissioned by World Book Encyclopedia. Portraits ranged from Martha Washington to Eleanor Roosevelt, whom he met after completing the project.[https://ugomochi.com/pages/1928-1945 His animals are some of his major works. New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History currently has fourteen huge panels on display showcasing his dinosaurs, penguins, and majestic rainforest creatures. In the 1970s, still in the United States, he published a series of books in collaboration with Dorcas MacClintock (who wrote the copy), including \u201cA Natural History of Giraffes\u201d (1973) and \u201cA Natural History of Zebras\u201d (1976). The \u201cPoet of Shadows\u201d \u2013 as he became known in the United States \u2013 died at the age of eighty-eight in New Rochelle (New York). ==Books published== * \"African Images\", 1984 * \"Horses as I See Them\", 1980 * \"Hoofed Mammals of the World\", 1971 * \"A Natural History of Giraffes\" (text by Dorcas MacClintock), 1973 * \"A Natural History of Zebras\" (text by Dorcas MacClintock), 1976 ==References== Category:American illustrators Category:Artists from New Rochelle, New York Category:1889 births Category:1977 deaths Category:People from Florence Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:American male sculptors Category:Sculptors from New York (state) ",
