    "text": "Whitworth Park Academy is a co-educational secondary school located in Spennymoor, County Durham, England. ==History== The school was formerly known as Spennymoor Comprehensive up until 2012, when it merged with Tudhoe Grange School. The school was subsequently renamed Whitworth Park School. The school moved into new buildings in 2013 that were officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. The existing buildings remained in use but were not of the same standard of the new build. While the new building were in construction, portable classrooms were put into use on the field where R.E, Maths and Languages were taught to the pupils. \u00a311 million was spent revitalising the school. The school used to operate a sixth form provision which offered a range of A-levels and vocational courses for students. However, in August 2017 the sixth form provision was closed 2 days before the start of the new school year. The existing sixth form students were allowed to finish their respective courses, however those intending to go there were not allowed to start and had to find other options. In December 2016 Whitworth Park School was rated 'Inadequate' by Ofsted who identified poor achievement and lack of leadership in their report. A new leadership team was then appointed and in June 2018 the school received a very positive report from HMI of schools. Previously a foundation school administered by Durham County Council, in September 2018 Whitworth Park School converted to academy status and renamed Whitworth Park Academy. The school is now sponsored by the Advance Learning Partnership. ==Academics== Whitworth Park Academy offers GCSEs, BTECs and Cambridge Nationals as programmes of study for pupils. ==References== ==External links== *Whitworth Park Academy official website Category:Secondary schools in County Durham Category:Academies in County Durham Category:Spennymoor ",
