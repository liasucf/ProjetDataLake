    "text": "DPANN is a superphylum of Archaea first proposed in 2013. Many members show novel signs of horizontal gene transfer from other domains of life. DPANN is an acronym formed by the initials of the first five groups discovered, Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota and Nanohaloarchaeota. Later Woesearchaeota and Pacearchaeota were discovered and proposed within the DPANN superphylum. In 2017, another phylum Altiarchaeota was placed into this superphylum. The DPANN groups together different phyla with a variety of environmental distribution and metabolism, ranging from symbiotic and thermophilic forms such as Nanoarchaeota, acidophiles like Parvarchaeota and non-extremophiles like Aenigmarchaeota and Diapherotrites. DPANN was also detected in nitrate-rich groundwater, on the water surface but not below, indicating that these taxa are still quite difficult to locate. == Classification == * Diapherotrites. Found by phylogenetic analysis of the genomes recovered from the groundwater filtration of a gold mine abandoned in the USA.Genomes Online Database * Parvarchaeota and Micrarchaeota. Discovered in 2006 in acidic mine drainage from a US mine. They are of very small size and provisionally called ARMAN (Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms). * Woesearchaeota and Pacearchaeota. They have been identified both in sediments and in surface waters of aquifers and lakes, abounding especially in saline conditions. * Aenigmarchaeota. Found in wastewater from mines and in sediments from hot springs. * Nanohaloarchaeota. Distributed in environments with high salinity. * Nanoarchaeota. They were the first discovered (in 2002) in a hydrothermal source next to the coast of Iceland. They live as symbionts of other archaea. == References == == External links == * Category:Archaea Category:Extremophiles Category:Superphyla ",
