He has sold 1.1 million albums as a soloist and an additional 4.2 million with Wanna One. Following the end of Wanna One's activities as a group, Kang released his first solo EP, Color on Me, in July 2019 under his newly formed one-man agency Konnect Entertainment. The EP debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and entered Japan's Oricon Albums Chart at number 23. It also broke two records selling over 500,000 physical copies within the first month of its release. In March 2020, Kang released his second EP, Cyan, which served as the first installment of his colors trilogy project. It peaked atop South Korea's Gaon Album Chart with its lead single \"2U\" giving Kang his first top ten track in Korea, which peaked at number seven on the Gaon Digital Chart. His third EP, Magenta, was released in August 2020 and served as the second installment of his three-part color series. ==Extended plays== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of extended plays, with selected chart positions, sales, and certifications !
