    "text": "Josip \"Joe\" \u0160imuni\u0107 (; born 18 February 1978) is a Croatian former footballer and current manager of the Croatia national U19 football team. Born in Australia to Bosnian Croat parents, \u0160imuni\u0107 started his career at Melbourne Knights then moved to Germany where he spent 14 seasons in the Bundesliga with Hamburger SV, Hertha BSC and TSG 1899 Hoffenheim before finishing his career in Croatia with Dinamo Zagreb. He played for Croatia from 2001 to 2013, appeared in five major tournaments for Croatia \u2013 2002 and 2006 World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008 and 2012 European Championships \u2013 and is the third most capped player in the history of the Croatia national team. ==Club career== \u0160imuni\u0107 was born in Canberra, Australia, to Bosnian Croat immigrants from Otigo\u0161\u0107e near Fojnica. He received early football training at Croatia Deakin in his hometown of Canberra before attending the Australian Institute of Sport program. The defender broke into the Melbourne Knights first team as a teenager in the 1995\u201396 season and ended it with a championship medal and 1996 NSL Youth Player of the Year award. \u0160imuni\u0107 scored his first goals the following term, three in 14 outings, before moving to Europe to join Hamburger SV in 1997. ===Hertha BSC=== \u0160imuni\u0107 moved to Hertha BSC in 2000 after having fallen out with Hamburg coach Frank Pagelsdorf and has since become an integral member of a team which has enjoyed occasional forays in the UEFA Cup. He expressed on The World Game on SBS television that he wishes to return to Australia to live after concluding his career in Europe. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, \u0160imuni\u0107 was named the best centre-half in the Bundesliga by kicker magazine. Hertha finished in fourth place that season, with a defence that conceded only 41 goals, tied for third in the league with VfL Wolfsburg. ===1899 Hoffenheim=== After nine years with Hertha, he left the club on 30 June 2009 to sign with TSG Hoffenheim on a contract which was to run out on 30 June 2012. ===Dinamo Zagreb=== On 31 August 2011, the board of Dinamo Zagreb confirmed signing of \u0160imuni\u0107 on a free transfer in a contract that expires on 30 June 2013. \u0160imuni\u0107 was signed by the club in order to re-enforce their team for UEFA Champions League matches. He made his official debut in Croatian biggest derby match, between eternal rivals Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split, on Poljud Stadium. During his first season with the club he made only 11 domestic league appearances, as he struggled to find his regular spot in the starting lineup due to injuries and tough competition in the team's defensive lineup that included Tonel, Leandro Cufre, Igor Bi\u0161\u0107an and Domagoj Vida. He made his UEFA Champions League debut against Lyon on Stade de Gerland. At the end of the season he won his first double with the club, as Dinamo won both the Croatian league and Croatian Cup. In the beginning of his second season with the club he established himself as the first choice centre-half and regular starter. He played fully 90 minutes in each of six Dinamo's group-stage matches in 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League. On 14 December 2014, \u0160imuni\u0107 officially retired from professional football. ==International career== \u0160imuni\u0107 was educated at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). He was eligible to play for Australia but opted to play for Croatia, even though his parents were from Bosnia and Herzegovina and not Croatia, albeit of Croatian ethnicity in Bosnia. After obtaining dual citizenship in October 2001 he made his international debut in Croatia's friendly match against South Korea on 10 November 2001. \u0160imuni\u0107 did not play in any of Croatia's qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup, but was given a place in the squad for the finals after injury forced Igor Tudor out. He played all three of Croatia's matches in Korea and Japan. He also played in the Euro 2004, the 2006 World Cup, and Euro 2008, performing well in the latter tournament. In a well-publicised incident, \u0160imuni\u0107 was sent off in Croatia's final 2006 World Cup match against Australia. \u0160imuni\u0107 having picked up a booking in the 61st minute, the referee Graham Poll took out a yellow card for his tackle in the 90th minute, but did not actually send him off. At the conclusion of the game three minutes later, however, \u0160imuni\u0107 remonstrated with Poll and received a \"third\" yellow card, this time followed by a red card. The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) initially noted all three bookings in its match report, before later removing the 90th minute (second) booking. This prompted the removal of Poll from the knockout stages referee pool. Shortly after the World Cup, Poll retired from refereeing international games, citing this game as a direct cause. Upon the release of his autobiography in 2007, Poll revealed that, upon booking \u0160imuni\u0107 for the second time, he had erroneously recorded him as \"Australia #3\" (who was defender Craig Moore), due to \u0160imuni\u0107's Australian accent. \u0160imuni\u0107 is known for having great football technique, despite being a centre-half. His national teammate Niko Kranj\u010dar says that, \"on a training pitch, he does feints like Ronaldinho.\" ===Controversies=== ====Salute after Croatia-Iceland game==== \u0160imuni\u0107 was involved in controversy following a 2\u20130 win for Croatia against Iceland in Zagreb on 19 November 2013. He was accused of neo-Nazi sympathies for having directed the crowd in a chant following the game. The use of the salute Za dom (\"For homeland\"), with the fans responding, Spremni (\"Ready!\"), was identical to the salute used by the fascist Usta\u0161e movement in Croatia during World War II. He defended his actions saying that he was driven by \"love for his Croatian homeland\". After the match, \u0160imuni\u0107 responded to his critics: \"Those who are bothered by those shouts should study history. If it bothers someone, then it's their problem. I'm not afraid.\" For this incident \u0160imuni\u0107 was fined 25,000 kunas (around \u20ac3,000) by the Croatian State Attorney's Office for inciting racial hatred and harassment of other participants of a public gathering. After an investigation FIFA suspended \u0160imuni\u0107 for ten official matches, banned him from entering the confines of the stadiums for those ten matches and imposed a fine of CHF 30,000 (around \u20ac24,000). \u0160imuni\u0107's behaviour was denounced by the Croatian Minister of Sports \u017deljko Jovanovi\u0107, the Association of Anti-Fascist Fighters of Croatia (SABH) and various foreign and domestic media. The severity of suspension by FIFA was both criticized and embraced \u2013 while Jovanovi\u0107 called it expected and deserving, sending a strong message that Croatians do not want to be perceived by Europe as backward rightists, and as a country where minority rights are being violated to promote and glorify fascism, others such as the Croatian Football Federation and Niko Kova\u010d, manager of the national football team, have described the suspension as excessive and draconian. \u0160imuni\u0107 appealed to FIFA to rescind his suspension, but lost his appeal in March 2014. His lawyers responded by claiming that a \"Greater Serbian lobby\" was to blame for FIFA's decision. On 9 April 2014, \u0160imuni\u0107 and his lawyers filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) located in Lausanne, Switzerland, and requested that the sanctions be cancelled or, alternatively, be stayed for a probation period of one year. The parties were heard at a hearing which took place at the CAS offices on 8 May 2014. The CAS arbitration committee in charge of this matter unanimously rejected the arguments of the player and dismissed his appeal, on 12 May 2014. A three-member committee was composed of Hendrik Kesler from the Netherlands, Luigi Fumaggalli from Italy and Marc Balmelli from Switzerland. The CAS confirmed the sanction imposed by FIFA against the player, who remained suspended for ten official matches, the first of which had to be served during the final competition of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and banned from entering the confines of the stadiums for those ten matches and also fined CHF 30,000. In 2019, he's said for Sportske novosti: \"I wasn't aware of implications because I hadn't lived in Croatia for a long period of time and I hadn't felt such division about certain questions, even if they were Za dom spremni. Therefore, it's very clear that I wasn't glorifying fascism, Nazism, or any other kind of totalitarianism. I was glorifying Croatia. I was convinced that was the right way.\" and \"Being aware of the context and everything that had happened, today I would chant Croatia, Croatia\". ==Coaching career== On 22 September 2015, \u0160imuni\u0107 was appointed an assistant manager of the Croatia national football team under the coaching staff of Ante \u010ca\u010di\u0107, who was sacked in October 2017. On 10 May 2019, he became a new manager of the Croatia national under-19 football team. ==Personal life== \u0160imuni\u0107 is married to Christina Koloper, a Canadian-Croat. On 5 September 2014, Koloper gave birth to the couple's first child. The child passed away in 2018. \u0160imuni\u0107 donated for the production of the 2016 Croatian documentary Jasenovac \u2013 istina. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== :Sources: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Hamburger SV |1997\u201398 |Bundesliga||2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- |1999\u20132000 |Bundesliga||6||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !8!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!8!!0 |- |rowspan=\"10\"|Hertha |2000\u201301 |Bundesliga||14||0||2||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||0 |- |2001\u201302 |Bundesliga||27||0||5||1||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||1 |- |2002\u201303 |Bundesliga||22||1||4||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||1 |- |2003\u201304 |Bundesliga||28||0||2||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||2 |- |2004\u201305 |Bundesliga||30||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||0 |- |2005\u201306 |Bundesliga||18||0||5||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||0 |- |2006\u201307 |Bundesliga||25||1||5||0||4||0||1||0||35||1 |- |2007\u201308 |Bundesliga||29||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||0 |- |2008\u201309 |Bundesliga||29||1||0||0||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||36||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !222!!3!!27!!3!!25!!0!!1!!0!!275!!6 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|1899 Hoffenheim |2009\u201310 |Bundesliga||31||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||1 |- |2010\u201311 |Bundesliga||10||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0 |- |2011\u201312 |Bundesliga||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !41!!1!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!42!!1 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Dinamo Zagreb |2011\u201312 |Prva HNL||11||0||2||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- |2012\u201313 |Prva HNL||25||1||0||0||10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||1 |- |2013\u201314 |Prva HNL||27||2||6||2||11||0||1||0||45||4 |- |2014\u201315 |Prva HNL||5||0||1||0||9||1||1||0||16||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !68!!3!!9!!2!!33!!1!!2!!0!!112!!6 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !339!!7!!37!!5!!58!!1!!3!!0!!437!!13 |} ===International=== :Sources: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=\"3\"|Croatia |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2001||2||0 |- |2002||8||0 |- |2003||9||1 |- |2004||13||1 |- |2005||8||1 |- |2006||9||0 |- |2007||9||0 |- |2008||11||0 |- |2009||6||0 |- |2010||8||0 |- |2011||9||0 |- |2012||7||0 |- |2013||6||0 |- !Total!!105!!3 |} ===International goals=== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !No. !Date !Venue !Cap !Opponent !Score !Result !Competition |- !1 |6 September 2003 |Estadi Comunal d'Aixovall, Aixovall, Andorra |17 | |2\u20130 |3\u20130 |Euro 2004 Qualifying |- !2 |18 August 2004 |Stadion Varteksa, Vara\u017edin, Croatia |28 | |1\u20130 |1\u20130 |Friendly |- !3 |26 March 2005 |Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb, Croatia |34 | |2\u20130 |4\u20130 |World Cup 2006 Qualifying |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Melbourne Knights * National Soccer League: 1995\u201396 Herta BSC *DFL- Ligapokal: 2001, 2002 Dinamo Zagreb * Prva HNL: 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314 * Croatian Cup: 2012 * Croatian Supercup: 2013 ==See also== *List of footballers with 100 or more caps ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Canberra Category:Australian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent Category:Australian people of Croatian descent Category:Australian emigrants to Croatia Category:Croatian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent Category:Association football central defenders Category:Australian soccer players Category:Australian expatriate soccer players Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatia international footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:UEFA Euro 2012 players Category:Hamburger SV players Category:Hamburger SV II players Category:Hertha BSC players Category:TSG 1899 Hoffenheim players Category:Melbourne Knights FC players Category:GNK Dinamo Zagreb players Category:National Soccer League (Australia) players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:Australian Institute of Sport soccer players Category:FIFA Century Club Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
