It is located on the north side of the Comuneros Square, in the historic center of the city of Zipaquir\u00e1 (Cundinamarca) in the South American country of Colombia. == Description == It is the main church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zipaquir\u00e1. The church is better known simply as Diocesan Cathedral of Zipaquira to distinguish it from the Salt Cathedral, which is located in the same municipality, this being actually a parish church and a tourist site and not a bishopric. The cathedral was designed by Fray Domingo de Petres (the same who designed the cathedrals of Bogot\u00e1 and Santa F\u00e9 de Antioquia), its construction began in 1805 and took 111 years to finalize, until it was inaugurated and consecrated on November 19, 1916 by the Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1, Bernardo Herrera Restrepo. The historic Zipaquir\u00e1 sector (including the cathedral), was declared a National Monument of Colombia by resolution 002 of 12 March 1982. == Gallery == File:Zipaquira - Cathedrale (2).JPG|Cathedral File:Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Zipaquir\u00e1.jpg|Remote view File:Catedral Diocesana de zipaquira (1).JPG|Clock File:Zipaquira - Cathedrale (4).JPG|Interior File:Nazareno.JPG|Jesus sculpture == See also == * Roman Catholicism in Colombia * Salt Cathedral of Zipaquir\u00e1 == References == Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Colombia Category:Buildings and structures in Zipaquir\u00e1 Category:Tourist attractions in Cundinamarca Department Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1916 ",
