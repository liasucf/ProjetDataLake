    "text": "\"Pick a Bale o' Cotton\" is a work song from the repertoire of Leadbelly. Johnny Cash released his adaptation as a single for Columbia Records (Columbia 4-42512, with \"Bonanza!\" on the opposite side) in July or August 1962. The Billboard magazine evaluated the single upon its release as having a \"moderate sales potential\", but \"Bonanza\" only grazed the Hot 100 and entirely missed the Billboard country chart, while \"Pick a Bale o' Cotton\" didn't make either. == Background == == Track listing == Johnny Cash version == Personnel == * Johnny Cash \u2013 vocal, guitar * Joe Hancock \u2013 banjo * Marshal Grant \u2013 bass * W.
