The community lands were cultivated during 700 years, which resulted in the formation of agro- landscapes. Due to lack of irrigation and low land fertility the community was relocated several times. In the vicinity of the village there are numerous remnants of the 17th-18th century dwellings. The community is known for its medieval kahrezes (qanat), a system of underground water channels and intake facilities. These deep channels are located 50-60m from each other. There are 5 kahrezes in Shvanidzor. Four of them were constructed in the 12th-14th centuries, even before the village was founded. The fifth kahrez was constructed in 2005. Potable water runs through I, II and V kahrezes. Kahrez III and IV are in quite poor condition. In summer, especially in July and August, the amount of water reaches its minimum, creating critical situation in the water supply system. ==Culture== Shvanidzor is famous for its historical monuments. Close to the community there is an old bridge (17th century), as well as Gyumerants, St. Stepanos (17th-19th centuries), Berdikar (12th-13th century) churches.
