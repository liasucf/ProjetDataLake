He recorded 25 points his rookie year, but suffered a broken neck while body surfing during the offseason. He spent the next season split between the AHL and NHL while recovering. He suffered his 2nd back surgery and was left unprotected on the NHL Intra League Draft. His best season came in 1976-77 when he played 79 games for the Penguins and scored 28 goals; he also appeared in the playoffs for the only time of his career. The Edmonton Oilers acquired Bianchin in the 1979 NHL Expansion Draft but he would serve just eleven games with them due to a nagging back. He chose to play a reduced schedule and played two seasons in Italy with HC Asiago and AS Mastini Varese. He was a member of the Italian national team at the Group B World Championships in 1981 and lead the tournament with scoring and was selected to the First Line All- Star Team. ==Family== His son, Jordan Bianchin, played professional hockey for three seasons in the Central Hockey League and in Italy's Serie A.http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=80776 ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular Season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
