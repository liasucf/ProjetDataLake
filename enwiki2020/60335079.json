The Mayor is entitled to appoint and release the members of his government. Since 1993 the Mayor is elected directly by Caserta's electorate: in all mayoral elections in Italy in cities with a population higher than 15,000 the voters express a direct choice for the mayor or an indirect choice voting for the party of the candidate's coalition. If no candidate receives at least 50% of votes, the top two candidates go to a second round after two weeks. The election of the City Council is based on a direct choice for the candidate with a preference vote: the candidate with the majority of the preferences is elected. The number of the seats for each party is determined proportionally. ==Italian Republic (since 1946)== ===City Council election (1946-1993)=== From 1946 to 1993, the Mayor of Caserta was elected by the City's Council. {|class=\"wikitable\" ! class=unsortable| !
