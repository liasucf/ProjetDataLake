They initially played in Supreme Indoor Football as a travelling team known as the Cap City Bulls in 2017 and scheduled for four games as travelling team as an affiliate member in the American Arena League (AAL) in 2018. For the 2018 season, they initially announced to play home games against local semiprofessional teams at the H-E-B Center, but they never played there and instead hosted their two home games at Luedecke Arena in the Travis County Expo Center. After the 2018 season, owner Keith Clay left the AAL due to its members instability and being based on the east coast. He then helped to create the new International Arena Football League (IAFL) based in the southwestern United States. Seven other teams were added, including the Tamps- Mex Lagartos, Rio Grande Valley Dorados, and Mexico City Mexicah. The league finished the season with only three teams still active and the championship game was played in Mexico between Mexicah and the Dorados. , all websites and social media pages have ceased to exist or have not been updated since the beginning of the 2019 season. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Original website * IAFL website Category:International Arena Football League Category:American football teams in Texas Category:Sports in Austin, Texas ",
