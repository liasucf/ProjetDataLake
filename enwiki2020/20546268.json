He graduated from Findlay in 1985 with a degree in physical education. ==Coaching career== ===Assistant coach=== Beckman began his coaching career at Auburn as a graduate assistant under Pat Dye from 1988 to 1989. Auburn were SEC co-champions in those seasons, and Beckman earned a master's degree in education from Auburn. From 1990 to 1995, Beckman was secondary coach and recruiting coordinator at Western Carolina. He later became defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator at Elon, a position he would hold from 1996 to 1997. Beckman coached at Bowling Green as defensive coordinator and associate head coach from 1998 to 2004 and at Ohio State under Jim Tressel as cornerbacks coach from 2005 to 2006, where he was a three-time nominee for the Frank Broyles Award. Beckman was the defensive coordinator at Oklahoma State University from 2007 to 2008. The Cowboys posted a record of 16\u201310 during those seasons. ===Toledo=== On December 4, 2008, Beckman was hired as the head coach at Toledo, to replace Tom Amstutz, who resigned during the 2008 season. Beckman's teams at Toledo saw consistent improvement. The 2008 team he inherited went 3\u20139. In 2009, his first year as a head coach, his team improved to finish 5\u20137. In the following year, his team finished 8\u20135, 7\u20131 in the MAC, earning a berth to the 2010 Little Caesar's Pizza Bowl, which they lost 34\u201332 to the FIU Golden Panthers. In his final year at Toledo, Coach Beckman finished 9\u20134, 7\u20131 in the MAC to be West Division co-champions with Northern Illinois. This team earned a berth to the 2011 Military Bowl. However, Beckman left after the regular season to become the head coach for Illinois. ===Illinois=== At Illinois, Beckman went 12\u201325 in three seasons, and only won four games in Big Ten play. In his third season, the Illini managed to qualify for a bowl with a 6\u20136 record, but lost 35\u201318 to Louisiana Tech in the Heart of Dallas Bowl. On August 28, 2015\u2014just a week before what was to be his fourth season\u2014Beckman was fired after the preliminary results of an internal investigation substantiated accusations of gross player mistreatment. Most seriously, the investigation found that he'd forced players to play through serious injuries and had the medical staff clear these players too soon. In a statement, Beckman called his ouster a \"rush to judgment\" that violated the terms of his contract, and stated that he intended to \"vigorously defend both my reputation and my legal rights.\" On April 11, 2016, Beckman settled with the university for a one time payment of $250,000 with the decision of firing \"for cause\" due to the mistreatment of players standing. http://www.thechampaignroom.com/2016/4/12/11414200/tim-beckman-settlement- illinois-football-news ===North Carolina=== On August 24, 2016; Beckman was hired to serve as a volunteer assistant defensive coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels, working under head coach Larry Fedora. Beckman and Fedora have a working history together, having both served as assistant coaches on Mike Gundy's staff at Oklahoma State in 2007. However, after a firestorm of criticism, Beckman resigned from this position the next day, claiming he did not want to be a \"distraction.\" It was later revealed that UNC chancellor Carol Folt had strongly objected to Beckman's presence, even in a volunteer role, once she learned about the arrangement. ==Controversies== ===Toledo=== In 2013, a former Toledo football player, Kyle Cameron, sued Beckman, the University of Toledo, and five members of Beckman's staff at Toledo for negligence and for violating Ohio's anti-hazing law. Cameron's lawsuit and appeal were dismissed as the suit was filed through the incorrect division of the Lucas County Court. However, Cameron's legal counsel has asked the Supreme Court of Ohio to review the case. ===Illinois=== Beckman was hired on December 9, 2011, by Illinois athletic director Mike Thomas. Prior to the start of the 2012 season, Beckman sent six Illinois assistant coaches to State College, Pennsylvania to recruit Penn State football players who the NCAA deemed eligible to transfer without missing playing time due to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. In October 2012 season, Illinois self-reported secondary violations to the NCAA as television cameras caught Beckman using chewing tobacco on the sidelines during a football game at Wisconsin. ==Head coaching record== ==See also== * List of Auburn University people ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Illinois profile * Oklahoma State profile * Ohio State profile * Bowling Green profile Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Auburn Tigers football coaches Category:Auburn University alumni Category:Bowling Green Falcons football coaches Category:Elon Phoenix football coaches Category:Findlay Oilers football players Category:Illinois Fighting Illini football coaches Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football coaches Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys football coaches Category:Toledo Rockets football coaches Category:Western Carolina Catamounts football coaches Category:Sportspeople from Beaumont, Texas Category:People from Berea, Ohio Category:Players of American football from Ohio Category:Sportspeople from Cuyahoga County, Ohio Category:College football controversies ",
