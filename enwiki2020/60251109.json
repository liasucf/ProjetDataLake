Although women had recently been enfranchised in France, the lack of time to prepare a new voter roll meant that female suffrage was not introduced for the 1945 elections in New Caledonia. Despite not being able to vote, women were allowed to run as candidates, and two were nominated by the Social Progress bloc. ==Campaign== A total of 50 candidates contested the 15 seats in the first round, five of whom were independents. Seventeen withdrew prior to the second round. The candidates were from three main groupings; the Comit\u00e9 Caledonien led by Pierre Berg\u00e8s, Social Progress (also known as the Labour group) led by Florindo Paladini and the Union Party (also known as the Conservatives or Ballande Party due to its association with Maison Ballande, the main commercial company in the territory). The Union Party represented commercial and financial sectors and put forward a manifesto calling for autonomy in the areas of customs and economic and financial policy. The Social Progress group called for the breakup of large agricultural estates and improved job opportunities for the local population. Prior to the elections, eleven Comit\u00e9 Caledonien members published an advertisement in the local media naming four of the Union Party candidates as supporters of Philippe P\u00e9tain.Election Skirmishes in New Caledonia Pacific Islands Monthly, February 1945, p28 ==Results== Voter turnout in the first round was around 50%. Berg\u00e8s was the only candidate elected in the first round. Prior to the second round, the Comit\u00e9 Caledonien and Social Progress blocs formed a Popular Front alliance to run against the Union Party. The Comit\u00e9 Caledonien and Union Party drew most of their support from rural areas, whilst the Social Progress group's voter base was concentrated in Noum\u00e9a. {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !rowspan=2|Party !colspan=3|First round !colspan=3|Second round !rowspan=2|Total seats |- !Votes!!%!!Seats!!Votes!!%!!Seats |- |align=left|Union Party||10,523|| ||0|| || ||2||2 |- |align=left|Comit\u00e9 Caledonien||8,452|| ||1|| || ||7||8 |- |align=left|Social Progress||8,417|| ||0|| || ||5||5 |- |align=left|Independents|| || ||0|| || ||0||0 |- |align=left|Total|| || ||1|| || ||14||15 |- |align=left colspan=8|Source: Pacific Islands Monthly |} ==References== New Caledonia Category:Elections in New Caledonia Category:1945 in New Caledonia ",
