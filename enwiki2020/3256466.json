It took over TRM's transmitter network, with 99 repeater stations serving 72% of the population.\"Aimed At Working Class: Mexico To Get New TV Network.\" United Press International, May 16, 1985: The new Red Nacional 7 (7 National Network) was positioned as targeting the working class and rural areas, while Red Nacional 13, based from XHDF, targeted a more middle- and upper-class audience. The insertion of a channel 7 into Mexico City required a shuffle of frequencies in neighboring areas, with stations in Mexico City, Toluca and on Altzomoni moving to accommodate the last VHF station in the nation's capital. From 1990 to 1993, Imevisi\u00f3n consolidated the programming of the channel 7 and 13 networks; this ended when both were privatized and Televisi\u00f3n Azteca was formed. == Digital television == === Digital subchannels === The station's digital channel is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

Azteca Noticias moved to XHTVM-TDT 40.2. ===Analog- to-digital conversion=== In 2007, TV Azteca began testing its HD channel, but with different programming to analog. The HD channel had films, documentaries and some series, along with the news and a select few Azteca HD productions (such as soccer games). This, however, was not permitted under the digital television transition which required that digital companions carry the same programs as their analog counterparts. In 2010, XHIMT-TDT began transmitting a direct Azteca 7 HD feed. 4:3 programs were stretched to fill the 16:9 space. On December 17, 2015, at 12:00 a.m., XHIMT analog channel 7 ceased broadcasts, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. ===Repeaters=== XHIMT-TDT has eight direct repeaters: |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Programming== ===Prime time=== ==References== Category:Azteca 7 affiliates Category:Television stations in Mexico City Category:Spanish- language television stations in Mexico Category:Television channels and stations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Mexico ",
