Esposito had been with the Black Hawks since 1969, appearing in 873 games, and earning a 418-302-147 record with a 2.93 GAA and 74 shutouts. On June 9, the Black Hawks traded away goaltender Bob Janecyk, their first round, sixth overall pick, as well as their third and fourth round draft picks in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for the Kings first round, third overall draft pick and their fourth round pick in the draft. By moving up three spots in the draft, the Black Hawks drafted local prospect Ed Olczyk. Olczyk, born in Chicago, spent the 1983\u201384 season playing with the U.S. National Team, scoring 21 goals and 68 points in 62 games. At the 1984 Winter Olympics, Olczyk scored two goals and seven points in six games for the USA. On June 19, the Hawks traded away defenceman Don Dietrich, forward Rich Preston and future considerations to the New Jersey Devils for forward Bob MacMillan and future considerations. MacMillan appeared in 71 games for the Devils in 1983-84, scoring 17 goals and 40 points. He was a former winner of the Lady Byng Trophy in 1979 while playing for the Atlanta Flames. ==Regular season== The Black Hawks started the season off with a solid 9-6-2 record in their first 17 games, which had the team in first place in the Norris Division. The Hawks slumped to a 13-22-1 record over the next 36 games, dropping them to a 22-28-3 record overall, and into second place in the division. Following a 6\u20134 loss to the St. Louis Blues on February 3, the team fired head coach Orval Tessier, as he was replaced with general manager Bob Pulford. Under Pulford, the Black Hawks finished the season on a 16-7-4 run in last 27 games, finishing the season 38-35-7, earning 83 points and second place in the division. This was a 15-point improvement over the 1983-84 season, as the club qualified for the post-season for the sixteenth consecutive season. Chicago was led offensively by Denis Savard, who scored 38 goals and a team high 105 points in 79 games. Steve Larmer led the club with 46 goals, and was second in points with 86 while appearing in all 80 games. Rookie Ed Olczyk had 20 goals and 50 points in 70 games. Al Secord led the Black Hawks in penalty minutes, getting 193 in only 51 games. On defence, Doug Wilson scored 22 goals and 76 points in 78 games to lead the blueline in scoring. He also had a team high +23 rating. Bob Murray had five goals and 43 points in 80 games, while Behn Wilson scored 10 goals and 33 points in 76 games, as well as earning 185 penalty minutes. In the net, Murray Bannerman appeared in a club high 60 games, earning a 27-25-4 record with a 3.83 GAA and a .884 save percentage. Warren Skorodenski backed him up, earning a record of 11-9-3 in 27 games, with a 3.22 GAA and a league leading save percentage of .903. He also earned two shutouts. ===Final standings=== ==Schedule and results== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\" |- ! width=\"2%\" | No. ! width=\"3%\" | R ! width=\"10%\" | Date ! width=\"5%\" |
