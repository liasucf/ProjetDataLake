It closed in 2007, with its operations relocated to nearby Mossend. Following the closure of the depot, the office space was taken over by site owners Network Rail as a new maintenance depot for the Motherwell area. It was later reopened by Direct Rail Services who currently use it to stable Class 68 locomotives and Mark 2 carriages operated on Fife Circle services for Abellio ScotRail. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * ==External links== An overhead view of the depot.
