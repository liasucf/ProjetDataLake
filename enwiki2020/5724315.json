It occurred on Muko-jima and Nakodo- jima in the northern group of the Ogasawara Islands. The last record were specimens taken in January 1930 on Muko-jima; by then, the bird was already gone from Nakodo-jima. In 1941, the subspecies was found to have gone extinct in the meantime. ==References== * Kittlitz, Heinrich von (1830): [Description of Apalopteron familiare] Mem. presentes a l'Acad.
