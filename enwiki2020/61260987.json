He is the director of the Center for Molecularly Optimized Networks, a NSF Phase I Center for Chemical Innovation. ==Career== Craig received his B.S. in chemistry from Duke University in 1991. The following year, he completed the M.Phil. in theoretical chemistry at University of Cambridge as a Churchill Scholar. He then began his studies in physical organic chemistry at Stanford University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1997 working with John Brauman. Upon completion of his Ph.D., he spent two years as a research chemist at DuPont, and one year as a postdoctoral researcher with Julius Rebek at The Scripps Research Institute. He was appointed assistant professor of chemistry at Duke University in 2000, where he was later promoted to associate professor in 2007, and professor in 2012. The following year he was named the William T. Miller Professor of Chemistry, the position he currently holds. He was the chair of the chemistry department from 2012 to 2017. At Duke, his studies have focused on the mechanisms and reaction dynamics of chemical reactions coupled to mechanical forces (\u201ccovalent polymer mechanochemistry\u201d), including single-molecule studies of associative exchange reactions as well as mechanochemical pathways that violate orbital symmetry principles in the absence of force. Chemical concepts that have emerged from these studies include \u201ctension trapping\u201d transition states and reactive intermediates, covalent \u201cstress relief\u201d, and \u201cbackbone lever arm effects\u201d. Materials concepts demonstrated by his group include stress-responsive polymers that strengthen in response to destructive mechanical forces and chemomechanically active soft devices like soft robots and electroactive displays. Work in his group in the area of supramolecular polymers led to the development of a \u201cmacromolecular analogue of the kinetic isotope effect\u201d that has been used to probe complex non-linear material properties and material toughening through otherwise \u201cmechanically invisible\u201d interactions. ==Current research== Ongoing research in the Craig lab bridges physical organic and materials chemistry. Current topics of research include the design and synthesis of self-healing polymers and the use of contemporary mechanochemistry in new stress-responsive polymers, catalysis, and the study of reactive intermediates and transition states. These areas require an interdisciplinary and nontraditional mix of synthetic organic and polymer chemistry, single-molecule spectroscopy, supramolecular chemistry, and materials characterization. ==Major publications== (Publications listed below have been cited more than 200 times) *AL Black, JM Lenhardt, and SL Craig, \"From molecular mechanochemistry to stress-responsive materials\", J.
