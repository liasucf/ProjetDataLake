    "text": "Tremacebus is an extinct genus of New World monkeys from the Early Miocene (Colhuehuapian in the SALMA classification). The type species is T. harringtoni. == Description == Tremacebus was about in length, and would have resembled a modern night monkey, to which it may have been related. However, its eyes appear to have been smaller than the modern species, CT scans of the cranium suggest a relatively small olfactory bulb and poor sense of smell, compared with night monkeys. These features suggest that it may not have been nocturnal. Only a few fossils have been found, including a skull from the Sarmiento Formation, Patagonia.Tremacebus at Fossilworks.org == References == == External links == * Mikko's Phylogeny Archive Category:Prehistoric monkeys \u2020Tremacebus Category:Prehistoric primate genera Category:Miocene primates of South America Category:Colhuehuapian Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Fossil taxa described in 1974 ",
