He was a sovereign king or chief, who deposed the indigenous chief, Kapawa.Social Performance: Symbolic Action, Cultural Pragmatics, And Ritual by Jeffrey C. Alexander, Bernhard Giesen, Jason L. Mast, page 157. ==Name== Pili \u2014 Heteropogon contortus The Hawaiian word pili is the native Hawaiian name of Heteropogon contortus. == Biography == Pilika\u02bbaiea was called a 'grandchild' of Lanakawai of the Ulu line, but he was born and brought up in \"Kahiki\" (Tahiti). The parents of Pilika\u02bbaiea were La\u02bbau and Kukamolimaulialoha, whilst the wife of Pilika\u02bbaiea was his sister, Hina-au-kekele. Because the chiefs of (the island of) Hawai\u02bbi had carelessly intermarried with junior chiefly lines, kahuna Pa\u02bbao went to Kahiki to find a relative of pure blood who could compete in rank with the chiefly lines of the other islands. He recites a chant to invite Lonokaeho to return with him. Lonokaeho declines the invitation, but sends Pilika\u02bbaiea in his place. Pilika\u02bbaiea becomes high chief and wins the support of the people and he becomes the ancestor of the chiefs of Hawai\u02bbi on the Ulu line down to the late 19th century.Beckwith 1970:372-373 His successor was his descendant, Chief Kukohou.David Malo, Hawaiian Antiquities.
