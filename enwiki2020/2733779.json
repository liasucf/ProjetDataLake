He sang it with a big band in an arrangement by Nelson Riddle. Riddle was a fan of Maurice Ravel and said that this arrangement was inspired by the Bol\u00e9ro. Sinatra aficionados usually rank this as one of his finest collaborations with Riddle's orchestra. The slide trombone solo is by Milt Bernhart. Sinatra usually included the song in his concerts\u2014a tradition carried on by his son, Frank Sinatra Jr.Obituary: Milt Bernhart, trombonist who got under Sinatra's skin, The Guardian, London, 4 February 2004 He recorded a studio version with Nelson Riddle's orchestra for his 1956 album Songs for Swingin' Lovers!. Sinatra re-recorded \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" for the album Sinatra's Sinatra (1963), an album of re-recordings of his favorites. This time the trombone solo was by Dick Nash because Bernhart was unavailable. A live version of the song appears on the 1966 album Sinatra at the Sands with Count Basie and his orchestra. Another version of the song is an electronically assembled duet featuring Sinatra and U2 lead singer Bono on Sinatra's 1993 Duets album. The track was released on a \"double A-side\" with U2's \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\". The single peaked at number four on the UK charts. ==Neneh Cherry version== Swedish singer-songwriter and rapper Neneh Cherry's hip-hop interpretation of \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" in 1990 was the lead single for the Red Hot + Blue charity album, and reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart. The music video was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. Cherry replaced most of the lyrics with a rap on AIDS victims and how society reacts to them. Of the original Cole Porter lyrics, she kept only the first four lines and \"Use your mentality, wake up to reality\". ===Critical reception=== Music & Media called the song an \"utterly brooding version of the old Cole Porter song, in a splendid production fro the Jungle Brothers' Baby Afrika Bambaataa.\" David Browne from Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"the words have special urgency\" in Cherry's \"stark, bass-line-propelled take\" on \"I\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin\", because the song begins with a rap about AIDS. Marc Andrews from Smash Hits said the track \"is the closest any of the artists here get to really putting the message across\" in his review of the album Red Hot + Blue. ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1990) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia (ARIA Charts) |align=\"center\"|61 |- |- |align=\"left\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |align=\"center\"|23 |- |align=\"left\"|Greece (IFPI) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References == ==External links== * * Cole Porter's \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" Piano Solo Category:1936 songs Category:1966 singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Frank Sinatra songs Category:Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Category:Neneh Cherry songs Category:Philips Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Bob Crewe Category:Song recordings produced by Brendan O'Brien (record producer) Category:Songs written by Cole Porter Category:Songs written for films Category:The Four Seasons (band) songs Category:Song recordings produced by Cameron McVey Category:Song recordings produced by Jonny Dollar Category:Screamin' Jay Hawkins songs ",
