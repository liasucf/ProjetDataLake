    "text": "An Electric Storm is the debut album by electronic music group White Noise. The band recorded the first two tracks with the intention of producing a single only, but were then persuaded by Chris Blackwell of Island Records to create an entire album. At this point the group had established the Kaleidophon Studio in a flat in Camden Town, London, and spent a year creating the next four tracks. The last track was put together in one day when Island demanded the completion of the album.An Electric Storm, sleeve notes, 1995 CD version, 3DCID 1001, Island Records Although not very successful on its initial release, the album is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music.
