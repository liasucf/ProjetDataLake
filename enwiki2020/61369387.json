Pumpkin Center is located on U.S. Route 190, west of Hammond. ==Name origin== In the late 1800s a popular vaudeville comedy show called \"Tales of Pun'kin Centre\" was distributed as a phonograph record and later broadcast over radio featuring a monologue by a fictional character named Uncle Josh Weathersby. The character resided in a fictional farming town called \"Pun'kin Center.\" Some of the local residents formed a baseball team to compete with the surrounding Hammond, Springfield and Albany teams. The team members named themselves the \"Pumpkin Center\" baseball team. The residents of the surrounding cities and villages began referring to the area as Pumpkin Center and the name stuck. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Louisiana ",
