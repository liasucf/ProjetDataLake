Franco explained that Towers liked doing co-productions with others and that the film was going to be an Anglo-American-German- Spanish-French-Italian co-production. This led to many changes to suit producers in each countries needs, with Franco recalling that the film was at first a horror film with a historical backdrop, then more of a historical film with a background of inquisition, then primarily about the inquisition, then an erotic film. ==Release== The Bloody Judge was released in Italy on 5 February 1970.
