The primary objective is to follow their investment strategies using copy trading or mirror trading. Social trading requires little or no knowledge about financial markets, and has been described as a low-cost, sophisticated alternative to traditional wealth managers by the World Economic Forum. ==History== One of the first social trading platforms was eToro in 2010, followed by Wikifolio in 2012.

As the users are not playing against each other but rather \u2013 against the market, this situation becomes a non zero-sum game, hence incentivizing the users to share as much information as possible.\" His paper concludes that \"social trading provides much better opportunities for profiting compared with individual trading,\" but that users make \"excellent but sometimes not optimal decisions in selecting experts when they can see others\u2019 choices.\" A 2015 World Economic Forum report described social trading networks as disruptors, which \"have emerged to provide low-cost, sophisticated alternatives to traditional wealth managers. These solutions cater to a broader customer base and empower customers to have more control of their wealth management,\" and \"pose a tangible threat to the traditional practices of the wealth management industry\". Economist Nouriel Roubini's thinktank predicted in 2016 that \"newer forms of investment, such as socially responsible investments and social trading will bring some of the largest industry growth in the coming years.\" A 2017 St. John's University study found that 'leader' traders, or those with followers, are more susceptible to the disposition effect than investors that are not being followed by any other traders, with the authors suggesting the observation may be explained by \"leaders feeling responsible towards their followers and an urge to not let them down, by fear of losing followers when admitting a bad investment decision and signaling confidence in their initial investment choice, or by an attempt of newly appointed leaders to manage their self-image.\" == Characteristics == Social trading is an alternative way of analyzing financial data by looking at what other traders are doing and comparing and copying their techniques and strategies.

Other variations offered on some platforms allow users to copy another trader's portfolio (copy portfolio), and follow a trader's dividends (copy dividends), where whenever a followed trader withdraws money from his or her account, a proportional amount of money will be withdrawn from the balance of their follower, in real time. ===Key features=== * Information flow: Unencumbered access to information is important in financial marketsAbout.com April 4, 2011. and that makes the free exchange of information of interest to small scale as well as individual investors. * Cooperative trading: Social trading offers traders the opportunity to work together in trading teams which can trade the markets collaboratively, whether by pooling funds, dividing research or through sharing information. * Monetization: As with social networks in the broader sense, monetization strategies are not always clear.
