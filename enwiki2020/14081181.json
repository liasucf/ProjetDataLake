    "text": "\"No Particular Place to Go\" is a song by Chuck Berry, released as a single by Chess Records in May 1964 and released on the album St. Louis to Liverpool in November 1964 (see 1964 in music). \"No Particular Place to Go\" was recorded on March 25, 1964 in Chicago, Illinois and features the same music as Berry's earlier hit \"School Days\". ==Lyrics== The song is a comical four verse story. In the first verse the narrator is cruising in his car with his girlfriend, and they kiss. In the second they start to cuddle, and drive slow. In the third they decide to park and take a walk, but are unable to release the seat belt. In the last verse they drive home, defeated by said recalcitrant seat belt. == Recording == The session(s) during which \"No Particular Place to Go\" was recorded were produced by Leonard and Phil Chess, and backing Berry were pianist Paul Williams, drummer Odie Payne, and bassist Louis Satterfield. == Charts == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1964) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Canada (RPM Top Forty-5's) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- | |- |New Zealand (Listener)Flavour of New Zealand, 6 August 1964 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |US Billboard R&B; Singles |style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |} ==Cover versions== A 1994 performance by George Thorogood & the Destroyers is captured on their live album Live: Let's Work Together. == References == ==External links== * Category:Chuck Berry songs Category:1964 singles Category:Chess Records singles Category:Songs written by Chuck Berry Category:Songs about cars Category:1964 songs ",
