Critics acknowledged that the minceur versions by Gu\u00e9rard tasted better and were less filling than their nouvelle cuisine originals.Aldo Buzzi L'uovo alla kok ==History== In 1974 chef Gu\u00e9rard arrived in Eug\u00e9nie-les-Bains and, with his wife Christine Barthelemy, began renovating a spa resort which Barthelemy had been running, and which was owned by Gu\u00e9rard's father-in-law. Gu\u00e9rard began thinking about how he could persuade Parisians to make the 500-mile trek to the spa and his restaurant. The spas were for health benefits and his creation - cuisine minceur - became the logical avenue for his new form of low-calorie cooking. == Books == *Cuisine Gourmande By : Michel Guerard *Michel Guerard La Grande Cuisine minceur ==References== ==External links== *Michel Guerard website Category:French cuisine ",
