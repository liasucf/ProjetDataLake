It is considered a landmark of the City of Perth. ==History== Aerial view looking west across Perth Historically it was much larger in size. The shorelines have been regularly changed. Considerable reclamation has taken place on both sides of the river. For example, in 1879, landfill of Perth Water was used to create The Esplanade. History of water use in the Perth- Bunbury region Dr Mark Lund and Helen Martin, 16 November 2005. Retrieved 29 December 2006. ==Narrows bridge reclamation== For the construction of the Narrows Bridge and its approaches, considerable amounts of the north-west section of Perth Water were reclaimed. The former river bank in that area is equivalent to the edge of Mounts Bay Road. The whole new Convention Centre lies on the river side of the former river bank. ==Events== The Perth leg of the Red Bull Air Race World Series 2006 In 2006, the last race in the Red Bull Air Race World Series was the first held in Australia, and was held in Perth, with the competition being centred over Perth Water.Red Bull Air Race: Swan River access restricted Department for Planning and Infrastructure.

Post-cards, calendar images, posters and photographs from most decades of the twentieth century exist, that show the view from the Park looking across Perth Water to the city. ==Uses== Barrack Square moorings, Perth Water Since the establishment of Perth, there have been either jetties or landing and mooring facilities at the location of Barrack Square at the jetty. The long running Transperth ferry service travels between Perth and the Mends Street Jetty in South Perth. Commercial companies also use the jetties for trips to Rottnest via Fremantle, and Swan River wine and leisure cruises. Ferry companies at the terminal have improved re-fuelling techniques to reduce the amount of oil pollution in Perth Water. ==Historical photos== The most accessible photographs that show the degradation of the space over time is in the collection in The West Australian book produced for the 150th anniversary of Western Australia in 1979.Edmonds, Jack (editor) (1979) Swan River colony : life in Western Australia since the early colonial settlement, illustrated by pictures from an exhibition mounted by West Australian Newspapers Ltd. as a contribution to celebrations for the state's 150th year Perth: West Australian Newspapers. \u2013 front cover, pages 2\u20133, 6,7, 36,37,54,68,70,84,88 all have views of Perth Water. ==Early maps== In the 1950\u20131951 Lord Mayor's report for the City of Perth an early map of Perth from 1838 was reproduced.

From some earlier photographs and images made from Kings Park it is possible to ascertain the earlier river-edges, or banks, from tree lines. The photo here is of the part of the river that was filled in to accommodate the Narrows Bridge works.

The channel was dredged from as early as 1908 to keep the South Perth to Perth ferry channel clear; such maintenance is an ongoing issue.
