    "text": "The Yellow Turban Army, also known as the Yellow Turban Bandits (after the publishing of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms), was a peasant rebel force led by the late Eastern Han Dynasty mystic Zhang Jue from Julu Commandery. The Yellow Turbans launched an uprising against the central government in 184, the year of the Jiazi in the Sexagenary cycle. The Yellow Turban Rebellion became one of the biggest rebellions in Chinese history, but it was mostly quelled within a year by the Eastern Han government. As result, the Chinese historiography has always placed it as the progenitor of the Three Kingdoms Era. Some Yellow Turban factions continued their insurgency for decades, however, and the last known remnants of the movement were defeated in the first decade of the 3rd century. ==Yellow Turban Army== The Yellow Turban Army was composed of commoners, rabble and other people of opportunity. Zhang Jue and his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang treated many of them, and thus were very popular. When Zhang Jue saw that followers of the Way of the Taiping grew more numerous by the day, he openly revolted in the large-scale Yellow Turban Rebellion. The scale of the Rebellion involved almost a million people, Zhang Jue passed away during the rebellion, with his brothers falling in battle. The Rebellion was put down within the year, but laid the foundations of the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. ==Impact== The Rebellion may have been put down within the year, but it laid the foundations of the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The central government handed local officials immense authority with regards to the recruitment of soldiers, which resulted in the warlordism of the late Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms Era, undeniably a fatal blow to the Eastern Han. The Rebellion accelerated the demise of the Eastern Han, and even after the defeat of the rebellion, small scale conflicts continued under the Yellow Turban banner along the Yellow River. This is also why the Yellow Turban Rebellion is often documented in Chinese historiography as the beginning of the Three Kingdoms Era. ==Leaders== *Zhang Jue\uff0chead of the Yellow Turban Army, passed away from illness during the Rebellion. Declared himself the \"Great Teacher\" (\u5927\u8ce2\u826f\u5e2b), and \"General of Heaven\" (\u5929\u516c\u5c07\u8ecd). *Zhang Bao\uff0cZhang Jue's second youngest brother\uff0cdied from a hail of arrows during battles between Eastern Han soldiers from Qing Province and Xu Province, with the army he led dissolving thereafter. Declared himself \"General of Land\" (\u5730\u516c\u5c07\u8ecd). *Zhang Liang\uff0cZhang Jue's youngest brother\uff0ca leading general of the Yellow Turban Army. Declared himself \"General of the People\" (\u4eba\u516c\u5c07\u8ecd). ==Notable Individuals== *Ma Yuanyi (\u99ac\u5143\u7fa9)\uff0cin the early days of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, Ma led tens of thousands of the Yellow Turban Army in secret, and plotted with close officials (Zhong Chang Shi \u4e2d\u5e38\u4f8d) of the Emperor to rise up in Ye. The plot leaked and he was pulled apart by chariots in Luoyang. *Zhang Mancheng (\u5f35\u66fc\u6210)\uff0cZhang was from Nanyang, and he rose up with tens of thousands of the Yellow Turban Army, killing the Junshou (Jun Governor), Chu Gong \u891a\u8ca2. Two months later he was in turn killed by the newly appointed Taishou of Nanyang, Qin Jie \u79e6\u9821. *Zhao Hong (\u8d99\u5f18)\uff0cafter the death of Zhang Mancheng, Zhao Hong became the leader of his faction of the Yellow Turban Army. Zhao occupied and held Wancheng, but was killed in a shock attack led by Zhu Jun. *Han Zhong (\u97d3\u5fe0)\uff0cafter the death of Zhao Hong, Han Zhong led the remainder of his faction of the Yellow Turban Army, and reoccupied Wancheng, holding out against Zhu Jun. Zhu caught Han in a surprise attack and Han surrendered. Han was killed in a fit of rage by Qin Jie. *Sun Xia (\u5b6b\u590f)\uff0cafter the death of Han Zhong, Sun Xia became the commander of Han's Yellow Turban Army remains. He led the defence of Wancheng against Zhu Jun, only to fall in battle. This faction of the Yellow Turban Army thus dispersed. *Bo Cai (\u6ce2\u624d)\uff0cBo Cai defeated Zhu Jun in battle. A month later, the combined forces of Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun won a great victory against Bo. *Peng Tuo (\u5f6d\u812b)\uff0cHuangfu Song and Zhu Jun chased Peng's Yellow Turban Army in Xihua, and shattered it. *Luo Ji (\u535c\u5df1)\uff0cHuangfu Song and Zhu Jun then went on to engage Luo Ji's Yellow Turban Army, which was based in Dong Jun, near present-day Puyang. Huang and Zhu caught up to Luo's Army near Cangting, north of present-day Yanggu County, Shandong, and managed to capture Luo alive, decapitating over 7,000 of his soldiers. ==Beihai Jun Yellow Turbans== *Zhang Rao (\u5f35\u9952)\uff0cled 200,000 Yellow Turbans from Ji Province, and defeated Kong Rong in battle. *Guan Hai (\u7ba1\u4ea5)\uff0cGuan besieged Kong Rong, and this led Kong to send Taishi Ci from Donglai Commandery (\u6771\u840a\u90e1) to request the then Chancellor (\u76f8) of Pingyuan State (\u5e73\u539f\u570b) Liu Bei for aid. == White Wave Bandits == * Guo Tai(\u90ed\u6cf0)\uff0cBetween 16 March and 13 April 188, Guo Tai (\u90ed\u592a) led some 100,000 Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Xihe Commandery (\u897f\u6cb3\u90e1; around present-day Fenyang, Shanxi). As they originated from Baibo Valley (\u767d\u6ce2\u8c37; \"White Wave Valley\") in Xihe Commandery, they later became known as the \"White Wave Bandits\" (\u767d\u6ce2\u8cca). They allied with the Xiongnu leader Yufuluo and attacked Taiyuan Commandery (\u592a\u539f\u90e1; around present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi) and Hedong Commandery (\u6cb3\u6771\u90e1; around present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi).([\u4e2d\u5e73\u4e94\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\uff0c ...]\u9ec3\u5dfe\u9918\u8cca\u90ed\u592a\u7b49\u8d77\u65bc\u897f\u6cb3\u767d\u6ce2\u8c37\uff0c\u5bc7\u592a\u539f\u3001\u6cb3\u6771\u3002) Houhanshu vol. 8.(\u9b4f\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u65bc\u592b\u7f85\u8005\uff0c\u5357\u55ae\u4e8e\u5b50\u4e5f\u3002\u4e2d\u5e73\u4e2d\uff0c\u767c\u5308\u5974\u5175\uff0c\u65bc\u592b\u7f85\u7387\u4ee5\u52a9\u6f22\u3002\u6703\u672c\u570b\u53cd\uff0c\u6bba\u5357\u55ae\u4e8e\uff0c\u65bc\u592b\u7f85\u9042\u5c07\u5176\u8846\u7559\u4e2d\u570b\u3002\u56e0\u5929\u4e0b\u6493\u4e82\uff0c\u8207\u897f\u6cb3\u767d\u6ce2\u8cca\u5408\uff0c\u7834\u592a\u539f\u3001\u6cb3\u5167\uff0c\u6284\u7565\u8af8\u90e1\u70ba\u5bc7\u3002) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1.
