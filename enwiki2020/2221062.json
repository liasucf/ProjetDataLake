    "text": "Clarenceux King of Arms, historically often spelled Clarencieux (both pronounced ), is an officer of arms at the College of Arms in London. Clarenceux is the senior of the two provincial kings of arms and his jurisdiction is that part of England south of the River Trent. The office almost certainly existed in 1420, and there is a fair degree of probability that there was a Claroncell rex heraldus armorum in 1334. There are also some early references to the southern part of England being termed Surroy, but there is not firm evidence that there was ever a king of arms so called. The title of Clarenceux is supposedly derived from either the Honour (or estates of dominion) of the Clare earls of Gloucester, or from the Dukedom of Clarence (1362). With minor variations, the arms of Clarenceux have, from the late fifteenth century, been blazoned as Argent a Cross on a Chief Gules a Lion passant guardant crowned with an open Crown Or. The current Clarenceux King of Arms is Patric Dickinson . ==Holders of the office== Brackets indicate a date for which there is evidence the named person held this office Clarenceux King of Arms Thomas Hawley in a 1556 grant of arms The current Clarenceux King of Arms, Patric Dickinson, on Garter Day, dressed in the robe of the Secretary of the Order of the Garter {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! style=\"width:5%\" |Arms ! style=\"width:30%\" |NameOffice-holders down to 1963 are from Godfrey and Wagner 1963, pp. 75\u2013101 ! style=\"width:10%\" |Dates of office ! style=\"width:50%\" |Notes ! style=\"width:5%\" |Ref |- | !Andrew |(1334) |This otherwise obscure figure was named as \"Clarencell rex Heraldus\" in a Wardrobe Account record dated 19 June 1334. |Godfrey and Wagner 1963, p. 75 |- | !Richard Spenser |(1383) |Spenser is recorded as \"Heraud Mariscall del Suth\" on 16 September 1383.

He was married to one Margaret and apparently died poor; one of his books was later divided into four parts (the Military Roll, a roll relating to the Aldermen of London, another to the Kings of England and the last relating to Parliament) which were divided between the British Museum (MSS.

He died in 1536 and was buried in the Church of St. Mary Overy in Southwark, now Southwark Cathedral. His wife was Susanna White, a daughter of Richard White of Hutton, Essex.

He was a Parliamentarian who took the covenant, intruded in Garter's office (c. 1643) and served on committees to regulate the heralds in 1641 and 1645. Parliament confirmed him as Garter on 20 October 1646 and as Clarenceux in 1650. Although he resigned from the latter eight years later, he was re-appointed in 1661, shortly after he was deposed as Garter during the Restoration. According to Godfrey and Wagner, he was a good armourist; however, his visitations provide only brief accounts of the families concerned, and he neglected his duties, both parliamentary and heraldic, from the 1660s. Despite these failings, he had ensured that the college and its records remained open during the Interregnum, much to the benefit of antiquaries, including his colleague Sir William Dugdale. |Godfrey and Wagner, 1963 pp. 53, 88Peter Sherlock, \"Bysshe, Sir Edward (c.1610\u20131679)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 |- |100px !William Ryley |1658 \u2013 1661 | | |- |100px !Sir Edward Bysshe |10 March 1661 \u2013 15 December 1679 |Reappointment (see above). | |- |100px !Sir Henry St George |28 January 1680 \u2013 16 June 1703 (promoted) |The eighth son of Sir Henry St George, Garter, Henry the younger became Clarenceux King of Arms after appointments as Richmond Herald (1660) and Norroy King of Arms (1677); he succeeded his brother, Sir Thomas, as Garter King of Arms in 1703. He was remembered by contemporaries as \"a timorous animal\" and \"incommunicative, sordid and of little learning\", but he visited 12 counties as Clarenceux and donated the profits from six towards the rebuilding of the college after the Great Fire of London.

Despite this and work at the Navy Office, the family lost out in the South Seas crash and Leake was forced to find employment. After joining the Society of Antiquaries and publishing Nummi Britannici historia, he joined the college as Lancaster Herald in 1727 and was promoted to Norroy in 1729; after serving as Clarenceux, he was promoted to Garter King of Arms in 1754. Leake was less interested in genealogy than the rights and history of the heralds; he petitioned for the college to have a monopoly on the researching of arms and unsuccessfully tried to revive the visitations, a proposal which Anstis and the government opposed. He also opened the college's register for Dissenting and Jewish births and carried out two Garter missions. On his death, his collections passed to his brother and were eventually bought by the college. |Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 58-59, 91C. E. A.

He was apprenticed to a cheesemonger in 1728 and, after 9 years service, he entered his own trade and carried out his practice for over 20 years. He travelled to the Low Countries and Scotland and supplied cheese to the allied armies during the War of the Austrian Succession; it was on these travels that he began noting down memorial inscriptions, a pursuit to which he would devote his life. He compiled a huge collection of inscriptions relating to Gloucestershire, where he travelled extensively from 1750 onwards. These interests brought him to the college, where he was appointed Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1757 and promoted to Somerset Herald in 1759, Norroy in 1773, Clarenceux and then Garter in 1780. A competent and methodical genealogist and draughtsman, he took a particular interest in parish registers and campaigned for their indexing and the inclusion of greater detail in them. After his death, the majority of his Gloucestershire notes and transcriptions were published, although a number remained in manuscript form until the 1990s. |Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 61, 92P. L.

Heard was a proponent of the landscape heraldry which proved popular in the late Georgian period, and, inspired by his earlier travels, took a precocious interest in American genealogy. As a long-serving herald, his genealogical practice was large and much of his manuscript collection ended up in the college. |Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 61-62, 92D. V.

Further appointments as King of Arms to the Royal Guelphic Order and the Order of St Michael and St George (1815 and 1818 respectively) followed before he became Clarenceux, served as deputy Garter at George IV's Coronation in 1821 and was promoted to Garter in 1822. In the latter office, he continued to run a large practice at the college and conducted missions to France, Denmark, Russia and Portugal. Much of his earlier heraldic career involved disputes with the other heralds about his sole right to record pedigrees of the Knight of the Bath; despite objections, he compiled 47 volumes, which are now in the college's possession. He also worked on a history of George IV's Coronation, which was only partially published in his lifetime, and a manuscript history of the Order of the Bath, also owned by the college. |Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 63-65, 93Thomas Woodcock, \"Nayler, Sir George (bap. 1764, d. 1831)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 |- |100px !Ralph Bigland |4 June 1822 \u2013 26 November 1831 (promoted) |Bigland was born on 1 May 1757, the son of Joseph Owen of Salford, Lancashire, but changed his surname in 1774 at the desire of his maternal uncle, Ralph Bigland, Garter.
