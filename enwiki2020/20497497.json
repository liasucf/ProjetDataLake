Livengood had blocked the student from leaving the restroom before questioning him on why he was in there instead of the \"girl's\" restroom. According to the Associated Press (AP), after the student replied that it is his legal right to use that restroom, Livengood instructed him to \"prove\" his male sex by using the urinal in front of him. Upon leaving the restroom, Livengood said to him \"Not going to lie, you freak me out.\" According to NBC news, the ACLU's West Virginia chapter stated that it has asked the Harrison County schools superintendent to take administrative action against Livengood. Also according to NBC, the West Virginia ACLU chapter stated that \"it is seeking best-practice policies and training in the school system for dealing with transgender students and issues.\" According to the AP, the ACLU West Virginia executive director Joseph Cohen responded to this event, calling it \"a life or death issue.\" In their report, the AP cited The American Academy of Pediatrics, which published a study in 2018 showing 51% of trans male adolescents had attempted suicide. As of date of this entry, the superintendent of Liberty High School, Dr. Mark Manchin, has not responded to news media's requests for comment. Livengood has since then regained his status as assistant principal. Student charged with Assault of an officer On March 11, 2019, a 2nd year student named Robert Talkington assaulted the school resource officer with a knife. The attack happened around 3pm on school property. Robert has not been allowed back on the property since the incident.
