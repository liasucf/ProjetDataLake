In 1972, the station changed its callsign to WKSJ. In 1974, the licensee changed to Capitol Broadcasting Corp. Later in the 1970s, former AM sister station WZAM (now WIJD) changed its callsign to WKSJ which forced a change in this station's call letters to the current WKSJ-FM. For legal and accounting purposes, the licensee of WKSJ-FM applied to the FCC to shift the license from Capitol Broadcasting Corp. (A West Virginia Corporation) to Capitol Broadcasting Corp. (An Alabama Corporation) in December 1985. The transfer was approved by the FCC on December 24, 1985. ===1990s=== In May 1992, Capitol Broadcasting Corporation agreed to sell this station to Franklin Communications Partners, L.P. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 16, 1992, and the transaction was consummated on September 30, 1992. In October 1993, Franklin Communications Partners, L.P., reached an agreement to sell this station to WAVH-FM, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 13, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on February 15, 1994. This would prove to be a very short-lived ownership as in January 1994, WAVH-FM, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Pourtales Radio Partnership. The deal was approved by the FCC on February 10, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on February 14, 1994. In January 1996, Pourtales Radio Partnership reached an agreement to sell this station to Gardner Broadcasting, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 28, 1996, and the transaction was consummated on June 10, 1996. This ownership stint would also prove short- lived as in March 1996, Gardner Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Capitol Broadcasting Company, LLC. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 8, 1996, and the transaction was consummated on May 31, 1996. In April 1997, Capitol Broadcasting Company, LLC, reached an agreement to sell this station to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) through Clear Channel Radio License, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 21, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on December 31, 1997. ===The Breakfast Club=== WKSJ's morning show has always been known as The Breakfast Club since the station hit airwaves in 1971.
