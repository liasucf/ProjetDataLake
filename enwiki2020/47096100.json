    "text": "Barrio Libre is a neighborhood in Tucson, Arizona notable for its existence as a relatively unchanged 19th-century Hispanic neighborhood of close-packed row houses. Houses in the barrio are typically adobe with very plain detailing, reflecting the area's history as a district of townhouses for Mexican ranching families. The district includes more than 200 contributing structures, with relatively few non-conforming buildings. The district is bounded by 14th and 18th streets to the north and south, and by Stone and Osborne to the east and west. Meyer Avenue runs through the center of the barrio. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 18, 1978. ==References== ==External links== * Barrio Libre at the National Park Service * Tucson's Barrio Libre online chapter from Barrio Historico Tucson, University of Arizona * , with additional surveys of individual houses in the district , , , and many others Category: Neighborhoods in Tucson, Arizona Category: Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category: National Register of Historic Places in Tucson, Arizona Category: Buildings and structures completed in 1885 Category: Historic American Buildings Survey in Arizona ",
