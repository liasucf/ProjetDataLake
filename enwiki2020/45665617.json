    "text": "Nordstromia simillima is a moth in the family Drepanidae. It was described by Moore in 1888. It is found in Kashmir in what was north-western British India. Adults are pale brownish ochreous, both wings crossed by a similar antemedial and a postmedial line. Both these lines are of a paler tint than the ground colour of the wings. The costal spots are larger, and there is a small spot at the lower end of the cell, as well as those on the outer margin of both wings.Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 1888: 402 ==References== Category:Moths described in 1888 Category:Drepaninae ",
