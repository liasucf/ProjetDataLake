    "text": "Doc Hudspeth Redman (born December 27, 1997) is an American professional golfer. ==High school career== Redman was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was the North Carolina AAAA state champion as a senior and all-state four years in high school. ==College career== Competing for the Clemson Tigers, Redman won both the Jackrabbit and the Ka'anapali Classic in the fall of his freshman year. ==Amateur career== Redman won the 2017 U.S. Amateur, after finishing 62nd out of 64 in the stroke play qualifier. He was also runner-up at the 2017 Western Amateur, losing in a playoff. Redman competed in the 2017 Walker Cup. ==Professional career== Redman turned professional following the 2018 NCAA Golf Championship and made his professional debut at the Memorial Tournament. By turning pro, he forfeited his exemptions into the 2018 U.S. Open and 2018 Open Championship which he earned via his U.S. Amateur win. In June 2019, Redman shot a 62 to Monday qualify for the Rocket Mortgage Classic. In the tournament, he shot 68-67-67-67 and finished solo second to Nate Lashley, who ironically got into the field as an alternate after failing to secure his spot through the same qualifier. This earned him $788,400, entry into the 2019 Open Championship and Special Temporary Membership on the PGA Tour for the rest of the season, after starting 2019 on the third-tier Mackenzie Tour. Although he played in only six PGA events during the 2018-19 season, the 400 points he earned as a nonmember were just enough to surpass the 376 points needed to qualify for PGA Tour membership in the 2019-20 season. ==Amateur wins== *2013 Carolinas Junior *2016 The Jackrabbit, Ka'anapali Collegiate Classic *2017 U.S. Amateur Source: ==Results in major championships== Results not in chronological order before 2019 and in 2020. {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2018!!2019!!2020 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T29 |- |align=left|U.S. Open |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T20 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |} CUT = missed the half-way cut \"T\" = tied NT = No tournament due to COVID-19 pandemic ==U.S. national team appearances== Amateur *Walker Cup: 2017 (winners) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:American male golfers Category:Clemson Tigers men's golfers Category:Golfers from North Carolina Category:Sportspeople from Raleigh, North Carolina Category:1997 births Category:Living people ",
