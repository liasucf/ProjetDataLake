    "text": "Sect\u00e9ra phone with its Security Module Sect\u00e9ra is a family of secure voice and data communications products made by General Dynamics Mission Systems which are approved by the United States National Security Agency. Devices in the family can use either the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or SCIP to provide Type 1 encryption, with communication levels classified up to Top Secret. The devices are activated with a Personal Identification Number (PIN). ==Sect\u00e9ra Secure Module== The Sect\u00e9ra Secure Module is a device that can provide encryption of both voice and data. It is used in the Sect\u00e9ra Wireline Terminal for use with standard PSTN devices and has been incorporated into a slim module to use with a Motorola GSM cell phone. The module is placed between the battery and the body of the phone. The phone may be used as a regular GSM phone when the security module is not activated by the PIN. ==Sect\u00e9ra Edge== Another member of the Sect\u00e9ra family, Sect\u00e9ra Edge, is a smart phone that supports both classified and unclassified voice and data communication, including access to the SIPRNET. The Sect\u00e9ra Edge costs approximately $3,000. The Sect\u00e9ra Edge was developed by General Dynamics competing against a product by L-3 under an $18 million contract from the National Security Agency. Available since mid-2008, it is already used by tens of thousands of employees in the intelligence community and the Defense, Homeland Security, and State Departments among others. It was reported in 2009, that the Sect\u00e9ra Edge could be the device to replace the BlackBerry of President Barack Obama in order to provide him with secure communications. But instead of the Sect\u00e9ra Edge, a standard BlackBerry device was secured with the SecurVoice encryption software.Electrospaces.net: How Obama's BlackBerry got secured, April 20, 2013. The Sect\u00e9ra Edge was discontinued in 2015.https://gdmissionsystems.com/cyber/products/secure- voice/sectera-edge/ GDMS Product Page ==References== ==External links== *Product Details - Sect\u00e9ra Category:Encryption devices Category:General Dynamics Mission Systems ",
