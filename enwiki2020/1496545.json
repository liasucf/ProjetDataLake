Cenotaph in front. Founded in 1846, the Club's first premises were located along Queen's Road, from the corner of Wyndham Street to the corner of D'Aguilar Street. The three-storey building was designed in a classic style. The cost of construction and furniture of \u00a315,000 was raised through an issue of \u00a3100 shares.A social institution with its beginnings in Colony history, South China Morning Post, 6 July 1980 A chronicle article from 1847 said: :\"It is a handsome three-storey building and with the out offices covers nearly the third of an acre of ground... :\"The interior arrangements are very elegant and reflect great credit on the architect (Mr. S. Strachan) for whose design for the building a premium was awarded.... The entrance hall and grand staircase in the centre supported on fluted columns with capitals in the Corinthian order has a very noble effect...\" In 1897, the club moved to more spacious accommodation next to the war memorial, on a sea-front plot of land created by the Central Praya reclamation.

The club held a referendum in around 1974, when the members voted to retain the building and not to redevelop. In 1977 and again in 1978, a demolition plan was rejected by members. The club committee became increasingly alarmist with arguments to redevelop, including the assertion in 1978 that the building was a fire safety hazard; that, in November 1979, it made inflated claims that it would cost HK$25 million to renovate, and eventually won the day. In 1981, architects who designed the building but who lodged an application to demolish it were quoted as saying that the existing building was old, traditional and would fall to pieces if leaned on heavily. A spokesman said it would \"come down like a pack of cards\". ====Preservation campaign==== To update the club facilities, the members had opted to have the building renovated at a cost of HK$20 million.'THE CLUB' \u2013 After the reprieve, South China Morning Post, 1 November 1978 However, the parlous state of the club's finances tempted the club to explore options to redevelop the valuable site.

The decision was denounced by conservationists as being influenced by \"powerful vested interests\" and against public opinionExco misled about Club, The Star, 18 Sep 1980 The Hong Kong Conservancy Association also appealed to the then Governor Murray MacLehose not to undervalue its cultural importance and not to allow the decision to be taken purely on economic grounds. \"If even the Government appears to value nothing but money, Hong Kong's youth cannot be expected to have higher standards,\" said Dr. L.
