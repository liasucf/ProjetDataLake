He contributed to the Yiddish press and to nearly all the Hebrew periodicals in the Diaspora over 50 years. ==Biography== Samuel Leib Zitron was born in Minsk, Russian Empire to Chana and Ya'akov Zitron, a merchant who died when Samuel Leib was ten years old. Zitron entered the Wolozhin Yeshiva at the age of 13, where he was the youngest of a class of 300. Attracted to the Haskalah, he made his first appearance as a Hebrew author at the age of fourteen in the periodical Ha- Maggid. He briefly moved to Vienna in 1876, where he befriended editor Peretz Smolenskin, and shortly thereafter began studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. He left for Prostken in 1882\u2014where he worked as a teacher of Hebrew\u2014and returned to Minsk the following year to devote himself to Jewish literature and publishing. He joined the staff of Ha-Maggid and also contributed to Ha-Shachar. He joined \u1e24ibbat Zion in its early days, and in 1884 translated Leon Pinsker's Auto-Emancipation from German into Hebrew, under the title Im en ani li mi li. He translated other (mainly Yiddish) works into Hebrew, including works by Lev Levanda, , S. Ansky, and Heinrich Graetz. During the 1890s, Zitron's articles appeared in the major Hebrew newspapers and journals, including Ha-Melitz, Ha-Shiloa\u1e25, and Lua\u1e25 A\u1e25i\u2019asaf. From 1904 Zitron lived in Vilna and edited various newspapers and anthologies. He began his Yiddish writing in 1915. ==Literary career== In the 1880s to 1890s, Zitron wrote short stories, one of which, Yonah Potah ('A Na\u00efve Dove', 1887), aroused popular attention.

He completed his major work, Leksikon Tziyyoni, in 1924, which provides the biographies of major Zionist figures. Zitron's main works in Hebrew also include Toledot \u1e24ibbat \u1e92iyyon ('The History of \u1e24ibat Tsiyon', 1913), on the Zionist movement and its precursors; Herzl, \u1e25ayav u-fe\u2018ulotav ('Herzl, His Life and His Activities', 1921); Yotzerei ha-Sifrut ha-Ivrit ha-\u1e24adashah ('Creators of the New Hebrew Literature', 1922), on Hebrew literature and its writers; and Anashim ve- Soferim ('Men and Writers', 1921).
