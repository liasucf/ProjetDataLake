    "text": "Kenneth L. Odinet Sr. (born October 9, 1930) is a retired businessman from Arabi in St. Bernard Parish in suburban New Orleans, Louisiana, who is a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. As a Democrat, he represented District 103, encompassing Orleans and St. Bernard parishes, from 1988 to 2008. In 2008, he switched parties and ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Another Republican, Eric Skrmetta, won the election and remains on the commission. In 2015, Odinet is still a registered Republican. ==Background== In 1951 and 1957, Odinet received bachelor's and master's degrees, respectively, from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\"Louisiana: Odinet Sr., Kenneth L.\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008 (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2007), p. 668. From 1952 to 1954, he served in the United States Army and attended infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was an engineer from 1954 to 1957, a construction engineer/manager from 1958 to 1973, and a consulting engineer/contractor from 1973 to 1986. In 1957, he wed the former Rosemary Popich (also born October 1930). The Roman Catholic couple has thirteen children. Odinet is affiliated with the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Association of Retired Persons. ==Elections== Odinet ran unsuccessfully for the state House in 1983, when he finished third to the incumbent Edward S. Bopp and the runoff election winner, Republican Edward Ripoll. Four years later on November 21, 1987, he unseated Ripoll, best known as the owner of the popular Bud Rip's Bar in New Orleans. Odinet polled 6,160 votes (59.1 percent) to Ripoll's 4,269 (40.9 percent). Four other candidates, all Democrats, were eliminated in the primary election held a month earlier. Odinet won reelection over two Democrats in 1991 with 56.4 percent of the vote. He went on to defeat with ease the Republicans Pamela Nevle in 1995 and Robert Breaud Jr. in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, Odinet, still a Democrat, ran for the District 1 seat in the Louisiana State Senate, vacated by Walter Boasso, who instead ran unsuccessfully as a Republican-turned-Democrat for Governor of Louisiana against Bobby Jindal. Odinet lost the Senate race to State Representative A. G. Crowe of Pearl River in St. Tammany Parish, 11,625 (52 percent) to 10,811 (48 percent). In the 2008 race for the Public Service Commissioner, Odinet narrowly lost a general election berth with the front- running candidate, former Commissioner John F. Schwegmann, an Independent, by 736 votes. He received 33,470 votes (22.6 percent) to Schwegmann's 61,711 (41.8 percent). Schwegmann entered the runoff with Eric Skrmetta, the primary runner-up who received 34,206 ballots (23.1 percent). Another Independent or No Party candidate, Bruce C. Kincade, held the remaining 18,440 votes (12.4 percent). The position opened when incumbent Jay Blossman did not seek reelection. Skrmetta then defeated Schwegmann in the November 4 general election. ==House record== Odinet carried generally low ratings from the conservative Louisiana Family Forum, which ranked him 38 percent in 2006 and 2007, his last two years in the House. Planned Parenthood of America ranked him 50 percent in 2001. The American Civil Liberties Union rated him 22 percent and 50 percent in 2001 and 2003, respectively.
