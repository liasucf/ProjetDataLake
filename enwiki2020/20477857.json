    "text": "The Pocdol Mountains, also known as the Bacon-Manito Volcanic Group are a volcanic group of stratovolcanoes in the Philippines. ==Location== The Pocdol Mountains form part of the boundary between the provinces of Albay and Sorsogon, in Region V, on the island of Luzon, in the Philippines. The group is located south-east of Mayon Volcano, between Albay Gulf and Sorsogon Bay, at latitude 13.05\u00b0N (13\u00b03'0\"N), longitude 123.958\u00b0E (123\u00b057'30\"E). ==Physical features== The Pocdol Mountains have a triangular footprint of about . There are several peaks above 1000 metres in elevation. The highest point is reported as above sea level. A fumarole field that contains sulfataras and chloride hot springs, is reported to be located near the summit of the volcanic group. The group is described by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program as fumarolic. ==Eruptions== There are no reports of eruptions. ==Geology== Several Pleistocene K-Ar dates have been obtained from the volcanic complex. Most igneous rocks in the Pocdol Mountains consist of pyroxene andesites with minor amounts of dacite and basalts. The area is traversed by the San Vicente-Linao Fault, a splay of the Philippine Fault. Volcanic cones in the western part of the complex are dissected, but those in the eastern part are morphologically youthful. The volcanic area is the host of various geothermal systems collectively called the Bacon-Manito geothermal field. ==Listings== *The Global Volcanism Program lists the Pocdol Mountains as Fumarolic. *Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) lists Pocdol Mountains as Inactive. ==See also== *List of active volcanoes in the Philippines *List of potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines *List of inactive volcanoes in the Philippines *Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology *Pacific ring of fire *Volcanic group ==References== ==External links== *Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) List of Inactive Volcanoes * Category:Stratovolcanoes of the Philippines Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Luzon Category:Mountains of the Philippines Category:Landforms of Albay Category:Landforms of Sorsogon Category:Volcanic groups Category:Inactive volcanoes of the Philippines ",
