El Pollo Loco, Spanish for \"The Crazy Chicken\", is the name of two independent restaurant chains that are controlled by different companies, U.S.-based El Pollo Loco, Inc. and Mexico-based El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies specialize in Mexican-style grilled chicken and were founded by Juan Francisco Ochoa. Ochoa established the first El Pollo Loco restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico in 1974 and then expanded his chain into the United States in 1980. Ochoa then sold his U.S. restaurants in 1983, which became El Pollo Loco, Inc., while keeping the ones in Mexico, which became El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. Both companies have since occupied non- overlapping global territories, and have offered different fare. ==See also== * List of fast-food chicken restaurants ==External links== * * Category:Fast- food Mexican restaurants Category:Fast-food chains of the United States Category:Fast-food franchises Category:Fast casual restaurants Category:Fast- food poultry restaurants Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Restaurants in Greater Los Angeles Category:Restaurants in California Category:Companies based in Costa Mesa, California Category:Restaurants established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in Mexico Category:1980 establishments in California Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Economy of the Southwestern United States Category:2014 initial public offerings ",
