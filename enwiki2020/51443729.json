Steve leaves for California, where wealthy stable owner Henrietta Fairfax hires him to train Memento, her own top thoroughbred. Gloria's guilt results in her following Steve out west. She needs to borrow $1,000 to race Galaxy, but is banished from the track when officials discover that Joe gave her the money. Henrietta is in love with Steve but realizes he has feeling for Gloria, permitting him to train Galaxy on her behalf in an upcoming stakes race, which Galaxy wins. ==Main cast== ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * Category:1937 films Category:1930s sports drama films Category:American sports drama films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American horse racing films Category:1937 drama films Category:Films directed by Milton Carruth ",
