    "text": "Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki (; 1 December 18672 October 1946) was a Polish chemist, politician, and President of Poland from 1926 to 1939. He was the longest serving President in Poland's history.August Zaleski was president of the Polish Government in Exile for 25 years, from 1947 until his death. He was serving as the president of Poland when Germany invaded the country on 1 September 1939, starting World War II. ==Early life and career== Mo\u015bcicki was born on 1 December 1867 in Mierzanowo, a small village near Ciechan\u00f3w, Congress Poland. After completing school in Warsaw, he studied chemistry at the Riga Polytechnicum. There he joined the Polish underground leftist organization, Proletariat. Upon graduating, he returned to Warsaw, but was threatened by the Tsarist secret police with life imprisonment in Siberia and was forced to emigrate in 1892 to London. In 1896 he was offered an assistantship at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. There he patented a method for cheap industrial production of nitric acid. In 1912 Mo\u015bcicki moved to Lemberg (; modern Lviv, Ukraine), in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where he accepted a chair in physical chemistry and technical electrochemistry at the Lemberg Polytechnic.Norman Davies, God's Playground, vol. II, Oxford University Press, 1986, , p. 422. In 1925 he was elected rector of the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic (as it was now called), but soon moved to Warsaw to continue his research at the Warsaw Polytechnic. In 1926, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society. ==Presidency== Mo\u015bcicki bestows the bulawa (the Marshal of Poland's baton) on Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y After J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat, on 1 June 1926, Mo\u015bcicki, once an associate of Pi\u0142sudski in the Polish Socialist Party, was elected president of Poland by the National Assembly on the Pi\u0142sudski's recommendation after Pi\u0142sudski had refused the office for himself. As president, Mo\u015bcicki was subservient to Pi\u0142sudski and never openly showed dissent from any aspect of the Marshal's leadership. After Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935, his followers divided into three main factions: those supporting Mo\u015bcicki as Pi\u0142sudski's successor, those supporting General Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y, and those supporting Prime Minister Walery S\u0142awek. With a view to eliminating S\u0142awek from the game, Mo\u015bcicki concluded a power-sharing agreement with Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y, which saw S\u0142awek marginalized as a serious political player by the end of the year. As a result of the agreement, Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y would become the de facto leader of Poland until the outbreak of the war, and Mo\u015bcicki remained influential by continuing in office as president. Mo\u015bcicki was the leading moderate figure in the regime, which was referred to as the \"colonels' government\" because of the major presence of military officers in the Polish government. Mo\u015bcicki opposed many of the nationalist excesses of the more right-wing Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y, but their pact remained more or less intact. Mo\u015bcicki remained president until September 1939, when he was interned in RomaniaStanislaw Mikolajczyk, The Pattern of Soviet Domination, Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1948, p. 6. following the German invasion of Poland and was forced by France to resign his office. He transferred the office to General Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski, who held it for only one day before General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski and the French government ousted him in favour of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz. ==Later life== Mo\u015bcicki's grave in the basement of the St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw Mo\u015bcicki was planning to leave for Switzerland after leaving office as President. From 1908 to 1920, he was a citizen of Switzerland; he was also an honorary citizen of the Fribourg commune. The Romanian authorities gave their provisional consent to his departure, but Germany opposed it. Mo\u015bcicki was offered to US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was determined to have Mo\u015bcicki go to Switzerland. The intervention of the US government forced the Romanian authorities to agree. General Sikorski also ordered the Polish embassy in Bucharest to provide all assistance to Mo\u015bcicki. The president stayed in Romania until December 1939. Mo\u015bcicki came to Switzerland through Milan, where he met with Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski. Initially, he lived in Friborg, where he was allowed to continue his scientific work. During this period, among others, he wrote down his memories, which were published by the New York magazine Independence. Mo\u015bcicki donated money to soldiers of the Polish Army in France, Warsaw residents in prisoner-of-war camps, concentration camps and labor camps. For five months, he taught at the University of Fribourg. Later, he was forced to take up paid work. In 1940, he moved to Geneva, where he worked in the Hydro- Nitro Chemical Laboratory. Mo\u015bcicki's health deteriorated rapidly after 1943. He died on 2 October 1946, in Versoix, near Geneva. In 1984, his descendants requested that the remains of Mo\u015bcicki and his wife be moved from Switzerland to Poland. The relevant Polish authorities agreed that a funeral was to be held in Warsaw and be completely private, without any state ceremonies. However, the authorities of the Canton of Geneva in Switzerland withdrew their agreement for political reasons after protests related to Solidarity from emigrants. In 1993, Mo\u015bcicki's remains were transported, on behalf of incumbent President Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, to Poland and deposited in the crypt of St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw. Mo\u015bcicki's symbolic grave is located in the Avenue of Merit at the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery in Warsaw, where his second wife is buried next to him. ==Gallery== File:I.
