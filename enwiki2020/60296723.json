Emily Cooke writing for The New Yorker called the novel \"too long, often awkward, sometimes tedious\" and yet praised the \"book\u2019s crudeness [as] exactly its strength\". Kirkus Reviews called the novel \"long and sometimes slow moving\" while also noting that \"the book has considerable merit\". The Daily Beast criticized it as a book\"that just isn\u2019t ready to see the light of day.\" ==References== Category:1996 novels ",
