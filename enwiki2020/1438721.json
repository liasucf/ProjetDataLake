Located on the Tonbetsu Plain, it faces the Sea of Okhotsk to the east where, during the winter, there is drift ice. 80% of the village's total area is covered by forests. * Mountains: Mount Horoshiri * Rivers: Sarufutsu River * Lakes: Poro Swamp, Kamuito Swamp, Mokeuni Swamp ===Settlements/Localities in Sarufutsu=== *Ashino (\u82a6\u91ce) *Asajino (\u6d45\u8305\u91ce) *Chiraibetsu (\u77e5\u6765\u5225) *Hamaonishibetsu (\u6d5c\u9b3c\u5fd7\u5225) *Hamasarufutsu (\u6d5c\u733f\u6255) *Onishibetsu (\u9b3c\u5fd7\u5225)(Town Hall is located here) *Koishi (\u5c0f\u77f3) ===Neighbouring municipalities=== * Hokkaido ** Wakkanai ** Toyotomi ** Hamatonbestu ** Horonobe ==Economy== Sarufutsu is famous for its large and particularly excellent scallops, among other seafood. Likewise, a relatively large part of the village is utilized for dairy farming. Sarufutsu has a fledgling tourist industry, as it is a highlight for motor bikers in the summer, who stop overnight at one of the biker camps. The tourist center is located a few kilometers south of Hamaonishibetsu. ==History== ===World War II=== During World War II, many Korean prisoners of war were sent to Sarufutsu, where they were kept as a labor force building an air field in Asajino. Approximately 80 Korean prisoners of war died over the course of construction from abuse or malnutrition. The air field was never completed, and since that time, has almost completely vanished. In recent year, the village made attempts to construct a monument in memory of the Korean prisoners who died there. However, construction was cancelled after Japanese nationalists orchestrated a protest movement via the internet. The village office was overwhelmed with threatening phone calls, who called the office workers traitors, and threatened the village with a boycott of its scallop industry. ===Settlements=== ====Koishi==== In the 1960s to early-1970s, Koishi was the largest settlement in Sarufutsu with several thousand people working in the coal industry. It had its own hospital, as well as a movie theater. With the decline of the coal industry across Japan, the population also drastically dropped in Koishi, and its current population is less than 50 people. ====Asajino==== As previously mentioned, Asajino was the potential site for an air field during World War II. ==Education== *Primary Schools ** Onishibestu Elementary School ** Hamaonishibestu Elementary School ** Hamasarufutsu Elementary School (closed spring 2015) ** Asajino Elementary School ** Ashino Elementary School (closed spring 2017) ** Chiraibetstu Elementary School * Junior High Schools ** Takushin Junior High School ==Recreation== *Onishibetsu Sports Center has weekly sports activities for residents and guests. ===Summer=== *Onishibetsu swimming pool is open during the summer into early fall. ===Winter=== *Onishibetsu has a small single-lift ski hill. ==See also== * Esanbe Hanakita Kojima (\u30a8\u30b5\u30f3\u30d9\u9f3b\u5317\u5c0f\u5cf6) formerly an island, now underwater ==References== * https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/world/asia/japanese-village-grappling-with- wartime-sins-comes-under-attack.html?_r=0 ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Villages in Hokkaido ",
