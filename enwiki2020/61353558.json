It is named after the renowned naturalist and explorer Carlos Ameghino. It is currently located in the \"Pichi Ruca\" house which belonged to General Manuel Fern\u00e0ndez Oro and is located within the land of the \"La Esmeralda\" estate. The Museum is placed in Belgrano 2150, Cipolletti (8324), R\u00edo Negro Province, Argentine Republic. == History == In the beginning, it was located at the Peuser Manor, located in the Los Tordos neighbourhood in the city of Cipolletti. It currently belongs to the School of Humanities of the National University of Comahue. In 1987 the museum was moved to the \"Pichi Ruca\" house, which was a part of the \"La Esmeralda\" estate. The manor belonged to General Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Oro, the city's founder, and his wife, Lucinda Gonz\u00e1lez Larrosa. The Senate of Argentina declared the Museum a place of social, cultural and educational interest in 2015, as a recognition of its institutional work. The proposal was submitted by national senator Magdalena Odarda and passed on the 25th of November in that year. == Collections == The museum hosts collections of recent and fossil species, minerals, as well as objects related to the early history of Cipolletti. Remains of recent species include birds, reptiles and mammals.
