    "text": "Andrzej Zaremba. Andrzej Zaremba from Czermina of the Zaremba coat of arms (died 1317 or 1318) was bishop of Pozna\u0144. Son of Szymon, castellan of Gniezno, brother of the cousin of Kalisz, Miko\u0142aj Jankowic and S\u0119dziw\u00f3j of Jarocin. A representative of one of the most powerful families of Wielkopolska in the 13th and 14th centuries. No mention has been made of his childhood and studies. For the first time he appears in the sources as a chaplain of Boles\u0142aw the Pious.Antoni G\u0105siorowski, Jerzy Topolski [red.]: Wielkopolski S\u0142ownik Biograficzny. Warszawa-Pozna\u0144: Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1981, p24. In 1280 he became the chancellor of Przemy\u015bl II, and in 1282 he was also Archdiocese of Kalisz. After the death of the king, he works in the office of W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141okietek. In a document from 1297, he appears as a provost of the Pozna\u0144 chapter. ==Episcopal career== In the same year, he left the court of \u0141okietek to embrace the Pozna\u0144 bishop's throne.Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 407 In 1298 he was the main negotiator of the settlement in Ko\u015bcian, between \u0141okietek, Henry III G\u0142ogowczyk and wielkopolskie Wielkieks, who in exchange for the support of \u0141okietek's embrace of the Crown left by Przemysl guaranteed a number of privileges to Pozna\u0144 bishops, including the title of the Crown Chancellor and the Pozna\u0144 throne. Soon after, along with the majority of the magnates of Wielkopolska, he found himself in opposition to \u0141okietek. In 1299, W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141okietek placed the interdict in the diocese of Pozna\u0144 (by some historians, this fact is questioned). After that he became one of the main architects of Wenceslas II's coronation as the king of Poland. After the death of Wac\u0142aw II, and soon after him Wac\u0142aw III supported in the summer of 1306 Henryk G\u0142ogowczyk, who mastered Greater Poland. The support of the Silesian Piasts of German and Silesian influences in Wielkopolska quickly caused that the majority of the nobles stood in opposition to Henry and his sons. Jakub \u015awinka and Andrzej Zaremba were in the forefront of this movement. In 1312, both priests laid a curse on Henryk and his sons, which accelerated the end of their rule over Wielkopolska. In 1313 bp. Andrzej ultimately spoke on the side of \u0141okietek. During the office of the Pozna\u0144 Bishop, he reformed the archdiocese of Pozna\u0144, dividing it into three smaller ones and planning to create a fourth one in the lands located on the northern bank of the Note\u0107. He issued laws that would put an end to the distribution of tithing from both new parishes and help to regain those assignments that his predecessors left behind. In the episcopal administration, he created a permanent general office, settled matters of cathedral vicars, created their permanent college, and recognized the bishops' chancellors as prelates. He also issued, in 1302, permission for an uprising at a Pozna\u0144 friend. ==References== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:14th-century deaths Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops ",
