    "text": "Los Guerreros Laguneros (Spanish for \"The Warriors from the Lagoon\") is a Lucha Libre (Professional wrestling) group, referred to as a \"stable\", based in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in Mexico. The stable was created in 2001 and has, since its inception, been led by \u00daltimo Guerrero and has been the top rudo (those that portray the \"bad guys\" in lucha libre) group in CMLL. Los Guerreros Lagunero currently consists of \u00daltimo Guerrero, his younger brother Gran Guerrero, Euforia and Templario. \u00daltimo Guerrero, Euforia and Gran Guerrero are the reigning and two-time holders of the CMLL World Trios Championship. The group originally was created as a splinter group of Los Infernales founded by \u00daltimo Guerrero, Rey Bucanero and Tarzan Boy. The group initially used the \"Los Infernales\" name until they were forced to change their name in 2001. At that point the group adopted the name Los Guerreros del Infierno (\"The Infernal Warriors\"). When Atlantis joined the group in 2005 they adopted the name Los Guerreros de la Atlantida (\"The Warriors of Atlantis\"), which was used interchangeably with the \"Guerreros del Infierno\" name. In 2011 Atlantis departed the group and it was renamed Los Guerreros Laguneros, referring to the fact that all members of the group were from the Lagunero area of Mexico. Since its inception various members of the team have held the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and the CMLL World Trios Championship as well as several individual championships. From 2004 until 2007 Los Guerreros were associated with Pandilla Guerrera (\"Gang of Warriors\"), a lower ranked group of wrestlers. ==Group history== ===Los Infernales (2001)=== In 1999 El Sat\u00e1nico reformed the group Los Infernales, recruiting \u00daltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero; Bucanero's uncle Pirata Morgan had been part of the original Los Infernales. Working with the veteran El Sat\u00e1nico allowed both Rey Bucanero and \u00daltimo Guerrero to rise up the ranks as well as develop into a regular tag team in CMLL. In the summer of 2000 Bucanero and Guerrero were one of sixteen teams entered into a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Tag Team Championship. In the end they defeated Villano IV and Mr. Niebla to win the championship. Throughout the summer of 2000 El Sat\u00e1nico had been working a storyline against Tarzan Boy, which was used to turn both Bucanero and \u00daltimo Guerrero against El Sat\u00e1nico. Bucanero, Guerrero and Tarzan Boy claimed that they deserved the name Los Infernales and that El Sat\u00e1nico was holding them back. For the storyline El Sat\u00e1nico recruited two other wrestlers to even the numbers, which on TV was presented as if he used his \"Satanic powers\" to turn wrestler Rencor Latino into Averno (Spanish for \"Hell\") and transformed the Astro Rey Jr. into a character known as Mephisto. When Tarzan Boy was injured and unable to wrestle Bucanero and Guerrero recruited M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica to even the numbers. The storyline between the two factions reaches its high point at the CMLL 68th Anniversary Show where all seven wrestlers faced off in a steel cage match. The stipulation of the match was that the winning side would gain the rights to use the name Los Infernales while the loser on the opposite side would be forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off. In the end El Sat\u00e1nico pinned M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica, forcing him to unmask. After losing the match Guerrero, Bucanero and Tarzan Boy became known collectively as Los Guerreros del Infierno (The Infernal Soldiers). ===Los Guerreros del Infierno (2001\u20132005)=== Finally, Sat\u00e1nico's Infernales retained their name and the name Guerreros del Infierno was adopted by Guerrero, Bucanero and Tarzan Boy. Soon GdI was the powerful rudo trio in CMLL. Bucanero and Guerrero successfully took the Tag Team Titles from the respected veterans Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo. \u00daltimo was successful in taking the CMLL Light Heavyweight Title (the most prestigious singles title in the promotion) by defeating Shocker. Tarzan Boy went on to main event the CMLL 70th Anniversary Show against Shocker in a Caballera contra Caballera match. Tarzan lost the match and his hair. 2004 was a tough year for the Guerreros. Guerrero and Bucanero lost and then regained the tag titles from L.A. Park and Shocker. Then Bucanero suffered a knee injury when his leg was caught in a seat and he was hit by a dive. Tarzan began teaming with Pierroth Jr. and Vampiro Canadiense to create a new top (in CMLL's eyes at least) heel trio. When Bucanero returned, they quickly lost the tag titles to Atlantis and Blue Panther. Tarzan soon started teaming with yet another trio called La Furia del Norte with H\u00e9ctor Garza originally Perro Aguayo Jr. but later El Terrible. It was then that \u00daltimo Guerrero raised an army of mid carders to counter Shocker's University de 1000% Guapo group and the two groups faced in a Torneo Cibern\u00e9tico. Olimp\u00edco won the match for Los Guerreros and was considered a full-time member, helping revitalize the group. When H\u00e9ctor Garza had his legal problems, Tarzan stepped back into the scene with allies Averno and Mephisto being treated like full- time members. 2005 was looking good for Los Guerreros until Ol\u00edmpico injured his neck on a dive in a tag title match with Bucanero against Atlantis and Panther on the first show in Arena Mexico. ===Los Guerreros de Atlantida (2005\u20132011)=== Rey Bucanero, founding member and later enemy of Los Guerreros In September, Averno and Mephisto took the CMLL tag titles back for the Guerreros, just weeks after Doctor X, Sangre Azteca and Nitro managed to finally wrestle away the National Trios Titles away from Volador Jr., Felino and Safari after several unsuccessful attempts. On May 28, 2006, in Arena Coliseo, Bucanero turned against Guerrero and Tarzan Boy during a match with Negro Casas, Heavy Metal and M\u00edstico, bringing a temporary end to the trios. Later on, Tarzan Boy would turn Tecnic\u00f3 and compete under the name \"Toscano\". \u00daltimo Guerrero and Atlantis kept the \"Guerreros del Infierno\" name alive, even after Ol\u00edmpico left CMLL and the group of mid-carders broke away to form Los Guerreros Tuareg. In 2008 Rey Bucanero returned to the group making Los Guerreros del Infierno a trio once more. On November 2, 2010, Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr. replaced an injured Atlantis and teamed with \u00daltimo Guerrero to defeat Mr. \u00c1guila and Hector Garza for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. After the match it was announced that Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr. had left his old stable Poder Mexica to become the newest member of Los Guerreros de la Atlantida. On April 8, 2011, \u00daltimo Guerrero and Escorpi\u00f3n won CMLL's Torneo Gran Alternativa, an eight tag team tournament where veterans form teams with newcomers. Following the win, Escorpion joined Los Guerreros de la Atlantida under the new ring name Rey Escorpi\u00f3n. ===Los Guerreros Laguneros (2011\u2013present)=== After weeks of tension between Atlantis and \u00daltimo Guerrero, CMLL held a press conference on August 11, where Atlantis officially turned t\u00e9cnico and left Los Guerreros de la Atlantida. The following day, Guerrero lost the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship to H\u00e9ctor Garza, who also turned at the same press conference, ending his reign at 963 days, the third longest in the title's history. In July 2012, Guerrero officially kicked Rey Escorpi\u00f3n from Los Guerreros del Infierno, though he had turned on the group weeks earlier, and named Euforia and Niebla Roja as his replacements. On August 3, Guerrero and Rojo Jr. lost the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to Atlantis and Diamante Azul, ending their reign at 640 days, the longest reign in the title's history. During the celebration of Atlantis' 30th anniversary as a wrestler Guerrero appeared after a match to berate Atlantis, which turned out to only be a distraction for the real \u00daltimo Guerrero to attack Atlantis from behind. The two identically dressed Guerreros proceeded to beat up Atlantis and tear his mask apart. Following the match \u00daltimo Guerrero introduced his brother \"Gran Guerrero\". It has not been verified if Gran Guerrrero actually is the brother of \u00daltimo Guerrero, someone not related to Guerrero, or as speculated by many his son who wrestled for CMLL as Taurus. On May 9, 2013 Gran Guerrero was officially introduced as an addition to Los Guerreros del Infierno. On March 28, 2014, Guerrero, Euforia and Niebla Roja defeated Los Estetas del Aire (M\u00e1scara Dorada, M\u00edstico and Valiente) to win the CMLL World Trios Championship. They lost the title to Sky Team (M\u00edstico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) on February 13, 2015. In the spring of 2017 CMLL began a storyline where Niebla Roja started having problems with his fellow Los Guerreros Laguneros teammates, initially by accidentally causing them to lose matches due to miscommunication between Niebla Roja and Euforia and Gran Guerrero. As the storyline progressed Niebla Roja refused to participate in Los Guerreros rudo antics such as double or triple teaming an opponent. On May 19 Niebla Roja's tecnico turn was completed as he kicked Los Guerreros leader \u00daltimo Guerrero in the face during a match. Afterward \u00daltimo Guerrero and Gran Guerrero beat Niebla Roja up, tore his mask off and demanded that Niebla Roja had to come up with a new mask instead of wearing the \u00daltimo Guerrero inspired mask. During the attack he was aided by his brother \u00c1ngel de Oro. On November 23, 2018 Los Guerreros introduced Templario as their newest member, pronouncing him an adopted Lagunero even though he was not from the Lagoon area. ==Members== Euforia, a member since July 2012. ;Current {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Member !Time !Notes |- |\u00daltimo Guerrero |January 2001 |Leader / Founder |- |Euforia |July 2012 | |- |Gran Guerrero |May 2013 | |- |Templario |November 2018 | |} ;Former {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Member !Joined !Left !Notes |- |rowspan=2|Rey Bucanero |January 2001 |May 2006 |rowspan=2 |Founder |- |January 2008 |August 2010 |- |Tarzan Boy |January 2001 |July 2008 |Founder |- |M\u00e1scara M\u00e1gica |June 2001 |February 2002 | |- |Ol\u00edmpico |October 2004 |November 2008 | |- |Sangre Azteca |November 2006 |December 2008 | |- |Eclipse |July 2006 |September 2007 | |- |Averno |May 2005 |December 2006 |Associate |- |Mephisto |May 2005 |December 2006 |Associate |- |Atlantis |September 2005 |August 2011 |Former co-leader |- |Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr. |July 2010 |September 2012 | |- |Rey Escorpi\u00f3n |August 2011 |September 2012 | |- |Niebla Roja |July 2012 |May 2017 | |} ===Timeline=== Mephisto, an associate of Los Guerreros after originally being their arch enemy. ==Championships and accomplishments== Champions Los Guerreros Laguneros (right) and challengers Car\u00edstico, M\u00edstico, and Volador Jr. (left) before a match in November 2018. ;Only titles won when they were members of Los Guerreros are listed. *Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre **CMLL World Heavyweight Championship \u2013 \u00daltimo Guerrero (2 times, current) **CMLL World Middleweight Championship \u2013 Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr. (1 time) **CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship \u2013 \u00daltimo Guerrero (1 time) **CMLL World Tag Team Championship (7 times)\u2013 Atlantis and \u00daltimo Guerrero (1 time), \u00daltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero (3 times), \u00daltimo Guerrero and Dr. Wagner Jr. (1 time), \u00daltimo Guerrero and Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr. (1 time) Euforia and Gran Guerrero (1 time) **CMLL World Trios Championship \u2013 Atlantis, \u00daltimo Guerrero and Tarzan Boy (1 time), Atlantis, \u00daltimo Guerrero and Negro Casas (1 time), Euforia, Niebla Roja and \u00daltimo Guerrero (1 time), Euforia, Gran Guerrero and \u00daltimo Guerrero (2 times, current) **Mexican National Welterweight Championship \u2013 Sangre Azteca (1 time) **NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship \u2013 Drag\u00f3n Rojo Jr. (1 time) **NWA World Light Heavyweight ChampionshipThe NWA has not sanctioned this title since 1990 when CMLL withdrew. \u2013 Tarzan Boy (1 time) **CMLL Universal Championship \u2013 \u00daltimo Guerrero (2014) **Reyes del Aire: 2020 \u2013 Templario *Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards **Best Tag Team of the Decade (2000\u20132009) \u2013 Rey Bucanero and \u00daltimo Guerrero ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre teams and stables ",
