    "text": "Excell International School was a small independent, co-educational, day and boarding school located in Boston, Lincolnshire, England for children aged between 3 and 18. An amalgamation of two previous schools, Conway School and Maypole House School. Parents were told in a letter that the school and the Chatterbox Nursery associated with it would close on 16 July 2010, as they had been suffering \"financial difficulties due to dwindling numbers\". ==History== ===Conway School=== The school was established in 1851 by Martha and Mary Gee as Boston Middle Girls School at George Street, Boston and was \"intended for female children whose parents are in the rank next above the actual poor\".The History and Antiquities of Boston: And the Villages of Skirbeck, Pishey Thompson, page 294, 1856 It subsequently moved to its current site at Tunnard Street, at a rebuilding cost of \u00a3800.\"Conway's History - About the History of Conway\", Google cache, accessed 25 February 2008 In 1905 the school was renamed as Conway School and established a good local reputation. The school became coeducational in the 1950s, achieving high levels of annual passes in the 11+ examination. In 2000 Conway School had 100% passes in the 11+ for the third year running. ====Head teacher controversy and problems with new ownership==== Former owner and head teacher Simon McElwain was jailed for two years, in October 2007, after admitting the possession of child pornography images. He stepped down from his position in November 2004.\"Ex-teacher jailed over child porn\", BBC News, 26 October 2007\"Ex-teacher admits porn offences\", BBC News, 18 September 2007 Under McElwain the school had 140 pupils and employed 19 staff. In April 2005 McElwain sold the school to David and Caroline Wilson. The new head teacher at this point was Philomena Rynne.\"Former head charged with 25 offences of child porn\", Boston Standard, 18 May 2005 Around this time, as the charges against McElwain became public, student numbers declined, although on the whole parents were supportive of the teaching staff, whom they knew to be doing their best for the pupils under difficult circumstances. The contribution of staff was also recognised in a report by one of Her Majesty's Inspectors following a visit in October 2007. The pupil roll dropped after the transfer of ownership, and the school closed on 3 January 2007.\"Conway school closes\", Boston Standard, 3 January 2007 There was an attempt to make the school a limited company, but this was not generally known to parents before the closure, when a letter headed \"Conway School (Boston) Ltd\" dated 22 December was sent to the remaining parents. However the matter of the proposed transfer to limited company status was mentioned in at least one of the Employment Tribunals brought against the new owners by members of staff. ===Maypole House school=== Maypole House School was founded in 1884, occupying Well Vale Hall in Well near Alford.\"Maypole House School\", Ofsted, 17 October 2006 Maypole House received a Food Hygiene Award from the East Lindsey District Council in May 2006.\"Food Hygiene Award \", East Lindsey District Council, accessed 25 February 2008\"Maypole House School, Lincolnshire\" , Which School?, accessed 25 February 2008 In January 2007 the Maypole management team took over the site at Tunnard Street and renamed as Excell International School. ===Merger=== Conway School and Maypole House merged in January 2007 to form the Excell International College. They also started to take boarders and extended the age range of pupils from 3-18. In January 2008 it was announced that none of its students attained five or more A*-C GCSEs.\"Excellent GCSE results from our schools\", Skegness Standard, 11 January 2008 ===Closure=== Parents were sent an unsigned letter, dated 2 July 2010, confirming that the school and nursery would close on 16 July 2010. Director Anthony Omokhodion said \"we have received an offer from the landlords for the present premises and we have accepted their offer\". Citing \"financial difficulties\" in the letter, Mr Omokhodion thanked parents for their \"support during these trying times\". No future plans for the building in Boston have been announced. The premises belong to St Botolph's Church (\"Boston Stump\") and were leased to the various owners of the school, the Misses Gee having given the land for the purpose of providing an educational establishment. ==References== *Schools Shock, Boston Standard 9 July 2010 ==External links== * Category:Boarding schools in Lincolnshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1851 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2010 Category:Defunct schools in Lincolnshire Category:Boston, Lincolnshire Category:1851 establishments in England Category:2010 disestablishments in England ",
