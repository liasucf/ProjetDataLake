    "text": "Antonio Ballard (born April 30, 1988) is an American professional basketball player, who lastly played for ESSM Le Portel of the LNB Pro A. He played with the Summerside and Island Storm from 2012 to 2014 and was named a National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) All-Star in both seasons. Ballard was also the Most Valuable Player of the 2014 game. He played college basketball at Miami University, where he represented the RedHawks. Michael Stinnett, a coach, commented on him, \"He is a versatile small forward who can do a little bit of it all.\" == Early life == In his childhood, Ballard moved around cities such as Louisville, Kentucky and areas in Indiana. He said that he moved around two to three times each year. Ballard did not know his own father while growing up, and his mother introduced him when he was nine years old. He told one newspaper, the Dayton Daily News, that all of his brothers got into some kind of trouble. Brian, his older brother, was sent to prison for several years for murder during a failed robbery attempt as a teenager. Two of his other brothers, Corey and BJ, went to jail in 2010 after running away from the police with possession of a gun. Ballard's youngest brother, Ricky, had experience in jail as well. In addition, some of his cousins had been shot or killed. Antonio himself had a gun pointed in his face. The presence of gangs limited the time Ballard could practice basketball. Because many of them were his family members, he was allowed to shoot. He said, \"It was rough basketball\u2014kind of like prison ball, I guess. Fights would break out and you had to hold your own, but you couldn't take it too far or something bad would happen.\" In Jeffersonville, Indiana, there was an old basketball rim, where gangs such as the \"Money Hungry Gangsters\" would park their cars. Ballard said, \"I've taken the good parts of my past life\u2014and one thing you do get from a gang is having each other's back.\" == High school career == Ballard did not play Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball because his family did not have enough money to pay for it. He solely competed at Jeffersonville High School. == References == == External links == *Antonio Ballard at Eurobasket.com Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Canada Category:American expatriate basketball people in Finland Category:American expatriate basketball people in France Category:American expatriate basketball people in Greece Category:American expatriate basketball people in Lebanon Category:American expatriate basketball people in Switzerland Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Indiana Category:ESSM Le Portel players Category:Island Storm players Category:Kymis B.C. players Category:Lions de Gen\u00e8ve players Category:Lugano Tigers players Category:Miami RedHawks men's basketball players Category:Shooting guards Category:Sportspeople from Lafayette, Indiana Category:Union Neuch\u00e2tel Basket players ",
