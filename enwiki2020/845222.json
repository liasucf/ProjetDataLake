    "text": "Doctor Mid-Nite (also Doctor Midnight) is the name of multiple fictional superheroes in DC Comics. The figure has been represented in the comics by three different individuals, Charles McNider, Beth Chapel, and Pieter Anton Cross. Dr. Mid-Nite was originally created by writer Charles Reizenstein and artist Stanley Josephs Aschmeier in 1941. The hero, represented first by Charles McNider, appeared for the first time in All-American Comics #25 (April 1941). He continued in All-American Comics until issue #102 (Oct 1948). Like many Golden Age heroic characters, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's Justice Society of America. His two successors were also represented as members of the group or an offshoot. Doctor Mid-Nite has never appeared as the solo protagonist of a regular title magazine, but the figure has been the subject of an anthology and a mini-series. All three versions of Doctor Mid-Nite have exhibited the same basic features: a cowled costume featuring a crescent moon symbol, keen ability to see in the darkness at the cost of near or total blindness in sunlight, the use of special visors and \u201cblackout\u201d smoke bombs to gain tactical advantage in combat, a high degree of skill in martial arts, and jobs as physicians serving both normal human beings and \"metahuman\" superheroes. Additionally, two of the doctors have been accompanied by sidekick owls. As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of Daredevil of Marvel Comics by more than twenty years. Charles McNider made his live-action debut in the second season of DC's Legends of Tomorrow played by Kwesi Ameyaw. Charles McNider also appears in the DC Universe series Stargirl, portrayed by Henry Thomas, alongside Beth Chapel, portrayed by Anjelika Washington. ==Fictional character biographies== ===Charles McNider=== Charles McNider is the original Doctor Mid-Nite appearing in All American Comics #25 (April 1941) in the Golden Age of Comic Books and is a common member of the Justice Society of America. McNider, a young surgeon, was blinded when a grenade went off in front of him caused by gangster \"Killer\" Maroni, but he found that he could see in the dark. He made special goggles that allowed him to see in the daylight, and decided to use his special power to fight crime. In his civilian identity, he pretends to be a helpless blind man. ===Beth Chapel=== Beth Chapel as Doctor Midnight. Art by Todd MacFarlane. As the aging McNider spent less time in action, Beth Chapel, a medical doctor, stepped into the role of Doctor Midnight. Beth Chapel was a native of Orangeburg, South Carolina, with a pastor father, a mother who sang in the church choir, and four brothers.Infinity Inc. #21. DC Comics. Chapel first appeared when Jade of Infinity, Inc. was rushed to her hospital for treatment after encountering Mister Bones' cyanide touch. During the onset of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Beth was blinded by an oxygen explosion, only to be rescued by Hourman's son Rick Tyler, who had taken McNider's drug that enhances ability to see in the dark. Beth used the formula to similarly treat her blindness, and she and Rick assume the mantles of their predecessors as Doctor Midnight and Hourman, with her mother crafting a super hero costume from a choir robe. Along with a new Wildcat, Chapel and Tyler applied for membership in Infinity, Inc, eventually gaining admission; however, the association was short-lived, as Infinity, Inc. disbanded shortly thereafter, though Chapel and Tyler began a romantic relationship during their tenure. Doctor Midnight and Wildcat were subsequently recruited by the U.S. government for a mission to defeat the supervillain Eclipso, only for Chapel to die on the mission along with Wildcat, the Creeper, Commander Steel, Peacemaker, and Major Victory.Eclipso #13. DC Comics. During the events of the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock\", Beth Chapel was returned to life alongside the rest of the restored Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes thanks to the influence of Doctor Manhattan. She now sports a more traditional costume resembling that of McNider and Cross. Following the fight against Black Adam's group and the foreign superheroes, Doctor Mid-Nite is mentioned to have opened a metahuman medical clinic called the All-Star Clinic where Ronnie Raymond is receiving treatment.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. ===Pieter Cross=== Pieter Cross first appeared in Doctor Mid-Nite #1. He is a doctor who develops the same abilities as Charles McNider after being drugged by enforcers from Praeda Industries and being in a car accident. ==Owls of Doctor Mid-Nite== Both Charles McNider and Pieter Anton Cross train owls as sidekicks. McNider trains the same owl which crashes through his window, an event that leads to the discovery of his powers. This owl named \"Hooty\" (sometimes \"Hootie\") shares many adventures during the Golden Age. Cross keeps company with an owl named \"Charlie\". The bird is named after the original Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider. Charlie keeps a mini-camera around his neck that can feed video directly to a display in Cross's goggles. ==Enemies== Each incarnation of Doctor Mid-Nite has fought different enemies: * \"Gallows\" Gallagher - A gangster who had his brother take his place in prison with help from a corrupt prison warden.All-American Comics #27.

The story written by Norwood and illustrated by Steve Sabo features a doctor named Tom Benson who is blinded in battle. He discovers that his other senses are super-sensitive and dons the Doctor Midnight costume to fight crime. Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' JSA: The Liberty File as a World War II United States intelligence agent code-named the Owl.

In the Tangent: Superman's Reign series, a version of Doctor Mid-Nite his body completely covered by a black cloak is briefly seen. In the new Earth-2 created in the wake of Infinite Crisis and 52, a version of Beth Chapel is shown to be a member of the Justice Society Infinity.Justice Society of America Annual #1 ==In other media== ===Television=== ====Live- action==== * Doctor Mid-Nite appears in the Smallville episode \"Absolute Justice\", in the painting depicting the Justice Society of America. * The Charles McNider incarnation of Doctor Mid-Nite appears in The CW's Arrowverse series Legends of Tomorrows second season as a member of a 1940s incarnation of the JSA, portrayed by Kwesi Ameyaw.
