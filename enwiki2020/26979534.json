In January 2010, he said that the proposed 10% equity share policy on infrastructural development in the Niger Delta region would make vandalism and crisis a thing of the past. ==Controversy== On 31 March 2015, Orubebe, acting as a polling agent for the PDP, made attempts at disrupting the proceedings of the 2015 presidential election collation. Orubebe alleged that INEC Chairman, Attahiru Jega, had taken side with the main opposition political party, APC. He however subsequently apologized to Nigerians over his conduct by tendering an unreserved apology urging them not to follow in his footsteps and explaining that he regretted his action. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Federal ministers of Nigeria Category:Delta State politicians Category:Ijaw people Category:Ambrose Alli University alumni Category:University of Lagos alumni ",
