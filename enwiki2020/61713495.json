The magazine was first published in 1946. It was published on a monthly basis by the Union of Soviet Writers, in several languages including English, French, German, Spanish, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, and Slovak. Earlier incarnations of the magazine in the 1930s and 1940s were titled Literature of the World Revolution and International Literature. Having been renamed in 1946, it ran continuously until 1990, when publication ended with the dissolution of the USSR. For many years, the editor-in-chief was Savva Dangulov. The last editor-in-chief was Natasha Perova. After the closure of Soviet Literature in 1990, Perova started the magazine Glas in January 1991. ==References== Category:Defunct magazines published in Russia Category:Literary magazines published in the Soviet Union Category:Magazines established in 1946 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1990 Category:Magazines published in Moscow Category:Monthly magazines published in Russia Category:Multilingual magazines ",
