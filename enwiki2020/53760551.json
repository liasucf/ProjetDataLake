For Recording Britain, Puller was sent at short notice to the village of Sudbourne in Suffolk, arriving just hours before it was appropriated for tank training by the British Army and the local population departed. Her other contributions included six studies of Tetbury in Gloucestershire. The War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, purchased two watercolours by Puller of bomb damage in the City of London. Her work for Recording Britain is now part of the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum, while the Imperial War Museum holds the paintings purchased from her by WAAC. Puller appears to have been an amateur artist, with no record of having a professional artistic career. In 1913 she was living in Elsecar near Barnsley and in 1926 she designed a number of panels for an illustrated, limited edition book about Wilthamstow and Highham. In 1940 Puller had one work shown in a Royal Academy exhibition and appeared to be living in London at that time. ==References== ==External links== * Works by Puller in the Victoria & Albert Museum * Works held by the Imperial War Museum Category:1884 births Category:1963 deaths Category:20th-century English painters Category:20th-century British women artists Category:British war artists Category:English women painters Category:World War II artists ",
