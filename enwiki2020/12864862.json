A selection of Columbia cartoons appeared in early NBC telecasts of King Leonardo And His Short Subjects, and were a holdover from the network's run of Hanna-Barbera's Ruff And Reddy. Despite this, these erroneous Columbia titles appear to be part of the series' official records and are even used to identify certain cartoons in episode descriptions for King Leonardo And His Short Subjects on AOL's In2TV.) ==Tooter Turtle== \"Tooter Turtle\" cartoons were repeated on Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales, replacing \"The Hunter\" at the start of the 1964\u20131965 season. \"Tooter Turtle\" later resurfaced on The Dudley Do-Right Show, which aired Sunday mornings on ABC-TV from April 27, 1969 to September 6, 1970 (\"Tooter\" does not appear in the syndicated Dudley Do Right And Friends).
