The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Para\u00edba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraiba do Sul river. ==History== Fielded hills surround the entirety of Taubate. Taubat\u00e9 was part of the ancient Tupinamba Territory, along the Paraiba do Sul River. The Tupinamba Territory in the 16th century, stretched from the Juqueriquer\u00ea River on the shores of Caraguatatuba to the Cape of Saint Thomas (Cabo de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9) in the State of Rio de Janeiro. The first village was created in 1640 being proclaimed as an autonomous locality on December 5, 1645, by a pioneer named Jacques Felix. It was the first location in the Vale do Paraiba region to obtain autonomy. The locality got its current city status in 1842. By that time, it was one of the most important coffee production centers in the country, hosting the Taubat\u00e9's Agreement in 1906. In 1908, the city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Taubat\u00e9. In 1900 was the largest city in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo. The county name comes from the Guarani language and means village (taba) high (ybat\u00e9). In 1891, Taubat\u00e9 was one of the first cities in Brazil to industrialize with the CTI (Companhia Taubat\u00e9 Industrial), a Textile Industry. ==Weather== The climate is classified as a humid subtropical climate, under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification with the average annual temperature around , with a maximum of and a minimum of , with average humidity of 60% and the annual rainfalls of , the extremes temperatures recorded on the city are and , there is also an unofficial record of . ==Demographics== Male: 120.288; Female: 123.819; Urban: 229.810; Rural: 14.297 (Source: Censo 2000 - IBGE) Panorama of Taubat\u00e9 ==Education and literature== Inside a class room of the University of Taubate Taubate is home to a large Brazilian Army Aviation base. Taubat\u00e9 is also a university city. The University of Taubat\u00e9, UNITAU, is a municipal institution of higher learning run by the state, but also by the private initiative. Brazil, like France, is a country where state-owned universities are free and rank as the best, but UNITAU isn't free. UNITAU attracts young people from all over the country who come to study in one of its many colleges, such as Medical School, Law, Dentistry, Engineering, Business Management, and also at the Department of Architecture where several alumni have excelled and won national prizes for their work, notable the Opera Prima Award. Monteiro Lobato, reputedly one of the most significant Portuguese-language writer of books for children, was born in Taubat\u00e9. His books have been translated into many other languages, especially S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo, the first and one of the largest tomes in the series of twelve. The unique way in which the narrative unfolds, gripping as they are for the many generations of children - and adults - who have read them, evolves in a style which can be likened to the sort of magic realism that permeates later styles of Latin American literature, and is set in rural S\u00e3o Paulo State where legends and myths naturally abound as the Portuguese colonial culture is fertilised by the fusion of amerindian and African cultures. The scene of his books is a fictional small farm - the S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo ( loosely translated as the Yellow Woodpecker Estate) owned by the central character to all of M L's books, one Dona Benta, a cultivated widow living alone in the farmlet with her black female servant Nast\u00e1cia. Dona Benta's grandchildren spend their summer holidays with her and most stories revolve around that scenario, which incidentally was inspired in M L's own property. Jos\u00e9 Bento de Monteiro Lobato was the grandnephew of the Viscount of Trememb\u00e9, a historical figure who lived in the region of Taubat\u00e9 during the second half of the 19th century, in the days when Brazil, a constitutional monarchy independent from Portugal, was an expanding economy largely dependent on its coffee plantations. Unsurprisingly, in 06/01/10 Taubat\u00e9 was granted, by the Chamber of Deputies, the title of National Capital of Children's literature.http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/EDUCACAO-E- CULTURA/148516-CAMARA-APROVA-TAUBATE-COMO-CAPITAL-NACIONAL-DA-LITERATURA- INFANTIL.html Another very important man in Taubatean and Brazilian history was Amacio Mazzaropi who was one of the pioneers in the movie industry, creating many classics that show a rural Brazil in the first half of the 20th century. Mazzaropi embodies what might be described as a rural Brazilian stereotype, the Jeca \u2013 a dude \u2013 whose emotions and sentiments are universal but which nevertheless reflect his immediate environment and culture. Mazzaropi the actor and film maker was himself epitomic of another influence in that part of the country: the son of Italian immigrants who falls in love with his new homeland, although, it must be said, none of his roles reflects this, since what Amacio endeavoured to portray at all times was the somewhat raw, idillyc and also very dainty environment of the coffee growing regions of his birthplace and their pretty cities in the lush tropical landscape. ==Sports== Esporte Clube Taubat\u00e9 is a football club based in the city. The main competition played by the club is the Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A2, the second level of the S\u00e3o Paulo state professional football championship. Taubat\u00e9 have a volleyball team, one of top 4 of Brazil. ==Quality of life== View of Taubat\u00e9.
