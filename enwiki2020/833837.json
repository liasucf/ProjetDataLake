The club was founded in 1922 and it is currently active in the First League of the Republika Srpska. The club plays its home matches at the Dr. Milan Jeli\u0107 Stadium, which has a capacity of 6,000 seats. Modri\u010da became champions in the First League of RS in the 2002\u201303 season, which secured them a place in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club's big success came in the 2003\u201304 season when it won the national cup. Due to this victory, Modri\u010da qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup tournament. It played against FC Santa Coloma of Andorra and won both games, but was later knocked out by Bulgarian side PFC Levski Sofia. However, its biggest success was when it won the 2007\u201308 Bosnian Premier League and qualified for the 2008\u201309 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds where they played against FK Dinamo Tirana and Aalborg BK. == History == The origins of Modri\u010da's history of professional sports are connected to football, and they date back to 1921. The first football was brought from Prague by a student \u0110oka Petrovi\u0107. The first football club was founded in Modri\u010da in 1922. The club was originally named Rogulj, but it soon changed its name to Zora. In the first years of development of the sport, there were no official competitions \u2013 only friendly matches played between teams from neighbouring locations, and the players purchased sports equipment for themselves alone. The first official match Zora played was against the neighbouring team of \"Bosanac\" from Bosanski \u0160amac in 1923, which resulted in a 2\u20132 draw. Zora existed up until 1927, when the authorities forbade its operation. Soon after, however, another club was founded under the name Olimpija, which existed under this name until 1938, when it changed its name to FK Dobor. After the beginning of the Second World War, all sports activities ceased, and only when the war was over, in August 1945, a new football club was founded, named Sloga. The club later changed its name to Napredak until it finally got the name Modri\u010da. For sponsoring reasons, Modri\u010da later received for a long time the surname Maxima. What was later changed again in summer 2017 because of sponsor change to Alfa. The biggest successes of the club during the years of the former Yugoslavia were in the season 1968/69, when it won first place and the title of amateur champion of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the second place in the competition for amateur champion of Yugoslavia. The shirt of FK Modri\u010da Maxima has been worn, among others, by: Nikola Niki\u0107, Goran Pele\u0161, D\u017eemal \u0110edovi\u0107, Slavko Cviji\u0107, Dragan Vo\u0107ki\u0107, Rade Radulovi\u0107, Slavko Mamuzi\u0107 and Mustafa \u010corali\u0107.

The 2003\u201304 season saw Modri\u010da's first participation in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The same season saw Modri\u010da lift the Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup on 26 May 2004. In the 2008\u201309 season, Modri\u010da won its first and so far only league title, which ranks as the biggest success in the long history of the club. == Stadium == The stadium was built and opened in 1962. FK Modri\u010da was formed in 1922 as a club and played its home games at Vranjak. At the time, the stadium was mainly built with wooden stands and could have an attendance of 3,000 spectators. Modri\u010da, being an industrial city and having the oil refinery as the main provider for most of the population of the city, needed to provide some kind of job offer for its hard workers. Now, the decision was made to build a larger stadium since FK Modri\u010da was taking part in the country's top league. The stadium \"Dr. Milan Jeli\u0107\" was named after the former president of Republika Srpska. After Dr. Milan Jeli\u0107's death on 30 September 2007, the club decided to change the name of their stadium in his honour. The stadium has changing rooms, offices for the hosts, chairs for its main stand, and the capacity altogether is 6,000.
