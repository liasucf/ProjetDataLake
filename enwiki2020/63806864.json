In the Asia/Oceania Zone there were four different tiers, called groups, in which teams compete against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group II advanced to the Asia/Oceania Zone Group I. Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group II, whereas teams who lost their play- offs were relegated to the Asia/Oceania Zone Group III in 2000. ==Participating nations== * * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Qatar vs. Indonesia=== ===Philippines vs. Chinese Taipei=== ===Sri Lanka vs. Iran=== ===Thailand vs. Kazakhstan=== ==Second round== ===Indonesia vs. Philippines=== ===Iran vs. Thailand=== ==Relegation play-offs== ===Chinese Taipei vs. Qatar=== ===Kazakhstan vs. Sri Lanka=== ==Third round== ===Thailand vs. Philippines=== ==References== ==External links== *Davis Cup official website Category:Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone Asia/Oceania Zone Group II ",
