    "text": "A blanagram (from blank+anagram) is a word which is an anagram of another but for the substitution of a single letter. The term has its origin in competitive Scrabble, where a blank tile on a player's rack may be used to form any of several possible words in conjunction with the player's other tiles. ==Examples of blanagrams== *On the list of currently acceptable words for club and tournament Scrabble in North America (OWL2), the anagram pair EPICOTYL/LIPOCYTE has 18 blanagrams: **Replacing C with L or N yields POLITELY or LINOTYPE; **Replacing I with A or F yields CALOTYPE or COPYLEFT; **Replacing L with C or D yields ECOTYPIC or COPYEDIT; **Replacing O with H or I yields PHYLETIC or PYELITIC; **Replacing P with R or V yields CRYOLITE or VELOCITY; **Replacing T with N yields POLYENIC; **Replacing Y with A, H, N, R, or U yields POETICAL, CHIPOTLE/HELICOPT, LEPTONIC, LEPROTIC/PETROLIC, or POULTICE. :Note that in this case no blanagram is available by replacing the E, so EPICOTYL and LIPOCYTE are the only eight-letter words that can be formed from the Scrabble tiles CILOPTY plus a blank. *The eight-letter word ANGRIEST (and anagrams such as GANTRIES and INGRATES) has over 100 blanagrams that are common words, and many more that are more obscure. *The word FILMCARD has only one acceptable blanagram: FLUIDRAM. (However, some other dictionaries list other possibilities, such as FRICADEL and FILECARD). *Turkish is a blanagram of Kurdish. *Pangram, Tangram and Managua are blanagrams of the word anagram. Many seven- and eight-letter words, such as KILOVOLT and QUIXOTIC, have no acceptable blanagrams; such words typically contain a subset of the letters JKQVWXZ. ==References== Category:Scrabble Category:Word play ",
