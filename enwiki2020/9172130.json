Mount Webster is flanked to the northeast by Mount Jackson; to the southwest it faces Mount Willey across Crawford Notch. The west face of Mount Webster drains directly into the Saco River, thence into the Gulf of Maine at Saco, Maine. The north and southeast faces drain into the Saco via Silver Cascade and Webster Brook respectively. Mount Webster is on the western boundary of the Presidential Range - Dry River Wilderness. The Appalachian Trail, a 2,170-mile (3,500-km) National Scenic Trail from Georgia to Maine, runs along the ridge of the Presidentials, across the summit of Webster. == See also == * List of mountains in New Hampshire * White Mountain National Forest == External links == * * Mount Webster on Topozone * PeakBagger.com: Mount Webster * summitpost.org: Mount Webster Category:Mountains of New Hampshire Category:White Mountains (New Hampshire) Category:Mountains of Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Mountains of Carroll County, New Hampshire Category:Mountains on the Appalachian Trail ",
