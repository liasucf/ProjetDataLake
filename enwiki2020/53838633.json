    "text": "Canastra from Minas Gerais Canastra is a type of cheese from Brazil. Its name comes from the surroundings where it's produced, a highland known as Serra da Canastra, located in the southwest region of the Minas Gerais state. The climate, altitude, pasture and water of this area are specific for its manufacturing and for this reason this delicacy is only made in a handful of towns, under supervised production. In 2008 the Canastra cheese was entitled an intangible cultural heritage of Brazil. == Characteristics == The Canastra cheese is made out of raw cow's milk and has a mildly spicy, full bodied flavour. It is found under three types of maturation: fresh, half and fully cured. The fresh stage means a four-day period and the fully cured forty days. A mature Canastra's taste resembles that of Grana Padano. If proper care is taken however, over the days it continues to cure. This is simply done by turning the chunk once a day and keeping it at a cool, ventilented place. The Canastra cheese goes well with red wine, dark beer or cacha\u00e7a and should not be kept in the fridge to avoid drying. To produce a standard 1.3 kg piece, approximately 10 litres of milk is used. ==See also== * List of cheeses == References == ==External links== * Queijos no Brasil - Queijo Canastra Category:Brazilian cheeses ",
