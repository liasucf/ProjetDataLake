Ordalaget Bokf\u00f6rlag. . ==Bishop== In 1888 Johansson was appointed Bishop of H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand and was consecrated on November 11, 1888, by Archbishop Anton Niklas Sundberg. Johansson was considered more aligned to the Low church tradition. He was also in favor of dividing the Diocese of H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand into two dioceses, something which occurred in 1904 when the Diocese of Lule\u00e5 was created from part of the Diocese of H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand. Johansson died in H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand on June 26, 1908, and is buried at Uppsala old cemetery.Hofberg, Herman \"Johansson, Martin\", Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon, 1906.
