    "text": "Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert The Pimer\u00eda Alta (Upper Pima Land) was an area of the 18th century Sonora y Sinaloa Province in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, that encompassed parts of what are today southern Arizona in the United States and northern Sonora in Mexico. The area took its name from the Pima and closely related O'odham (Papago) indigenous peoples residing in the Sonoran Desert. Pimer\u00eda Alta was the site of the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert established by the Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. A significant Pima rebellion against Spanish rule occurred in 1751. ==Bibliography== * Albrecht Classen, \"Transcultural Encounters: German Jesuit Missionaries in the Pimer\u00eda Alta,\" in Martinson, Steven D. / Schulz, Renate A.
