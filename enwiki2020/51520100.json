Formerly the cathedral of the Diocese of Fossombrone, since 1986 it has been a co-cathedral of the Diocese of Fano- Fossombrone-Cagli-Pergola. ==History== The church site was formerly that of a Benedictine abbey. Between 1776 and 1784 the church was completely rebuilt in Neoclassical style, with the exception of the 15th-century campanile, by the architect Cosimo Morelli. It has a tall central fa\u00e7ade with monumental columns supporting a triangular tympanum. The interior contains three naves with polychrome altars, made of marble and scagliola, designed by Nicola Vici. The altarpieces depict: the Madonna and Child with Saints Joseph and Francis and a Madonna and Child with St Anne by Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri; as well as a Madonna and Child with Saints Anne and Aldebrandus by Claudio Ridolfi. The niches inside have bas-reliefs with images of the Virgin and Child, and Saints Aldebrandus, Peter, Paul, and Blaise. The organ was constructed in 1785 by Gaetano Callido, with a restoration in 1996\u201397.Turismo Marche, entry on church.
