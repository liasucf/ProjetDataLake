It still hangs there, between Horace Vernet's The Battle of Bouvines, 27 July 1214 and Charles-Philippe Larivi\u00e8re's The Battle of Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le, 18 August 1304. It is Delacroix's only work in the Gallery and probably his only work in the whole Versailles complex. ==References== category:War paintings Category:Paintings by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix Category:1837 paintings category:Paintings of Versailles Category:Horses in art ",
