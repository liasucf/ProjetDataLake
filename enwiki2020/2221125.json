It was founded in Grahamstown under that title on 6 January 1871 (as a resurrection of the previous Great Eastern paper), and was moved to the Witwatersrand sixteen years later by its owners, brothers Thomas and George Sheffield. In 1889, the name Eastern Star was changed to the one currently in use. ==Supplements== *Business Report (Monday-Friday) *Tonight (Monday-Friday) *Workplace (Monday & Wednesday) *Motoring (Thursday) *Play (monthly) ==Distribution areas== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:400px; height:150px;\" |+Distribution | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|2008 | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|2013 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Eastern Cape | Y | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Free State | Y | Y |- ! scope=\"row\"| Gauteng | Y | Y |- ! scope=\"row\"| Kwa-Zulu Natal | Y | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Limpopo | Y | Y |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mpumalanga | Y | Y |- ! scope=\"row\"| North West | Y | Y |- ! scope=\"row\"| Northern Cape | Y | Y |- ! scope=\"row\"| Western Cape | Y | |} ==Distribution figures== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:400px; height:150px;\" |+CirculationAudit Bureau of Circulations (S.A) | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Net Sales |- ! scope=\"row\"| Jan - Mar 2015 | 91 735http://www.marklives.com/2015/05/abc-analysis-q1-2015-the- biggest-circulating-newspapers-in-south-africa/?category=media |- ! scope=\"row\"| Jan - Mar 2014 | 101 711 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Oct - Dec 2012 | 102 244 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Jul - Sep 2012 | 105 686 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Apr - Jun 2012 | 117 874 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Jan - Mar 2012 | 124 641 |} ==Readership figures== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:400px; height:100px;\" |+Estimated ReadershipSAARF AMPS (Previous Presentations)SAARF AMPS (Industry Presentations) | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|AIR |- ! scope=\"row\"| January \u2013 December 2012 | 615 000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| July 2011 - June 2012 | 683 000 |} ==See also== * List of newspapers in South Africa ==References== ==External links== *The Stars Official Website * SAARF Website Category:Daily newspapers published in South Africa Category:Mass media in Johannesburg Category:Publications established in 1871 ",
