They were not an official club in that time, playing friendly games on this field. The main team at this stadium was Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. They used this field between 1902 and 1913 before moving to Campo de O'Donnell from 1913 to 1923.http://urbanity.cc/forum/espa%C3%B1a/comunidad-de-madrid/espacios-de- deporte-comercio-y-ocio_aa/23031-madrid-real-madrid-y-atl%C3%A9tico-de-madrid- tuvieron-un-campo-originario-com%C3%BAn Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Campo de O'Donnell had the same name as Real Madrid's Campo de O'Donnell for 10 years because their locations were very close to each other, less than 200 meters on the main boulevard called Calle de O'Donnell. Tiro del Pich\u00f3n hosted three Spanish Cup finals: 1904, 1905, and 1910.http://clubatleticodemadrid.com/atm/nuestros- estadios-del-retiro-al-vicente- calderonhttp://www.fotomadrid.com/verArticulo/97 ==References== Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Category:Real Madrid CF Category:Defunct football venues in Spain Category:Former sports venues in Madrid ",
