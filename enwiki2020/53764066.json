    "text": ", often abbreviated PDAS, is a Japanese space tourism company based in Nagoya founded in 2007 by Shuji Ogawa. The \"PD\" in the company's name stands for \"pulse detonation\". PDAS is developing a suborbital spaceplane to carry two pilots and six passengers using a hybrid of jet and rocket power. Initial tickets are planned for \u00a5 14,000,000 (about $125,000 USD as of April 2017) eventually lowering to \u00a5400,000 (about $3,600). PDAS plans to develop a hybrid engine that produces jet and rocket thrust, using pulse detonation jet and pulse combustion rocket modes. To reduce the cost of development and keep the vehicle low-cost, PDAS plans to use commercially available hardware, instead of custom-designed parts. PDAS plans to launch an unmanned prototype in 2019, perform manned testing by 2020, and start commercial flights in 2023. H.I.S. and ANA own 10% and 7% of the company, respectively. ==See also== * Blue Origin * Interstellar Technologies, a Japanese rocket startup * Virgin Galactic ==References== ==External links== * Category:Airlines established in 2007 Category:Transport companies established in 2007 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 2007 Category:Japanese companies established in 2007 Category:Companies based in Nagoya Category:Transport companies of Japan Category:Travel and holiday companies of Japan Category:Commercial spaceflight Category:Human spaceflight programs Category:Private spaceflight companies Category:Space tourism Category:Aerospace companies of Japan ",
