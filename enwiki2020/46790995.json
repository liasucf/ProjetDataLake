    "text": "\"OctaHate\" is the debut single by Ryn Weaver, taken from her Promises EP as well as debut album, The Fool. It was released by Interscope and Friends Keep Secrets Records on August 8, 2014. The song's lyrics were written by Weaver and fellow musician Charli XCX, while music and production were handled by Benny Blanco, Michael Angelakos of Passion Pit and Norwegian electronic musician Cashmere Cat. ==Music video== The original music video for \"OctaHate\" was taken down, and replaced by a new one on May 14, 2015. During an interview with NY Mag, Weaver talked about why she took down the original. She claims the video wasn't executed properly and chose to create a new one because she \"wanted people to understand [her] cohesive vision.\" The new music video for \"OctaHate\" was inspired by the 1966 film Daisies by director V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1. Weaver explained, \"For the second one, we ripped a page from this '60s Czech film called Daisies\u2014this feminist, absurdist piece. In this scene, they talk about how the whole world is spoiled and how as a result, they should spoil themselves,\" a theme which can be seen mirrored in the music video. ==Live performances== Ryn made her live TV debut with OctaHate on the Late Show with David Letterman on January 15, 2015. ==Critical reception== Chris Deville from Stereogum praised the song saying, \"Even at a time when it seems like every upstart on SoundCloud is pushing sparkly pan-genre synthpop, 'OctaHate' stood out for its sleek exterior and the effortless manner in which it swung from playful sway to magnificent sweep.\" The song was also given a positive review by Michelle Geslani of Consequence of Sound saying, \"'OctaHate' is as catchy as a pop number can possibly hope to be. Between the twinkling xylophones, airtight melodies, and frothy beats, Weaver already sounds radio-ready, just in time for summer.\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014\u201315) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists | 1 |- |} == Certifications == ==External links== * ==References== Category:2014 songs Category:2014 debut singles Category:Interscope Records singles Category:American pop songs Category:Songs written by Charli XCX Category:Songs written by Cashmere Cat Category:Songs written by Benny Blanco Category:Song recordings produced by Benny Blanco Category:Song recordings produced by Cashmere Cat Category:Songs written by Ryn Weaver ",
