    "text": "Arsenic trifluoride is a chemical compound of arsenic and fluorine with the chemical formula AsF3. It is a colorless liquid which reacts readily with water. ==Preparation and properties== It can be prepared by reacting hydrogen fluoride, HF, with arsenic trioxide: :6HF + As2O3 \u2192 2AsF3 \\+ 3H2O It has a pyramidal molecular structure in the gas phase which is also present in the solid. In the gas phase the As-F bond length is 170.6 pm and the F-As-F bond angle 96.2\u00b0.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition Oxford Science Publications Arsenic trifluoride is used as fluorinating non- metal chlorides to fluorides, in this respect it is less reactive than SbF3.

However, the authors conclude the formed product cannot be viewed only as an ionic compound nor entirely as a neutral adduct of AsF3SbF5. The crystal structure of formed compound displays characteristics of both an ionic pair and neutral adduct structural motives, taking the middle ground in between both models of molecule description.
