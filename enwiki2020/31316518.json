Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 ==Design and development== The original model, the LP-46 was first flown in 1966, with the LP designating Laister Products. The LP-46 features a wingspan and the first LP-46 has fixed monowheel landing gear. The LP-49 is an improved version of the LP-46, designed for the Standard Class with a wingspan. The LP-49 has a metal wing with a NACA 64(3)-618 laminar flow airfoil and all-metal tail surfaces. The control surfaces are all counter-weighted with internal weights. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque fiberglass design, mounting a shock-strut suspended retractable monowheel landing gear with an automatic swivelling and retractable tailwheel. The ailerons and dive brakes automatically hook up on aircraft assembly. Due to the fuselage construction the aircraft type certificate contains the restriction \"All external portions of the fuselage exposed to sunlight must be painted white, except for a minimum amount of light shaded markings.\" The LP-49 was static-tested to 12 g and is approved for aerobatics including loops, spins and wing-overs. The aircraft is often called The Forty-Niner. ==Operational history== In March 2011 there were two of the three LP-46s built registered with the Federal Aviation Administration in the US, all certified aircraft. Also in March 2011 there were 24 LP-49s registered. Of the registered LP-49s 17 are certified and seven are amateur- built. ==Variants== ;LP-46 :Original version with a wingspan, first flown in 1966 and certified on 22 October 1971. Vne is .
