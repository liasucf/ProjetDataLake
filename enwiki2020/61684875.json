    "text": "Live at Sugar Hill is a live album by blues musician John Lee Hooker recorded in California in 1962 and released by the Galaxy label. The album was reissued in 1974 by Fantasy as the first disc of the double LP Boogie Chillun which added ten additional previously unreleased recordings from the same concerts. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger stated: \"Recorded live in November 1962 in San Francisco, this dates from the period in which Hooker often presented himself as a sort of blues/folk singer for the coffeehouse crowd, toning down his volume and aggressiveness somewhat. There's something of a muted \"unplugged\" feel to these solo performances (though an electric guitar is used). It's not ineffective, though not among his best work; it's the kind of Hooker you might want to put on past midnight, just before going to sleep\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker except where noted # \"I Can't Hold On\" \u2013 4:07 # \"I'm Gonna Keep on Walking\" \u2013 3:28 # \"I Was Standing by the Wayside\" \u2013 4:46 # \"T.
