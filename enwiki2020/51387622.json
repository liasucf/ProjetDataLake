    "text": "Raimbault Creek was a watercourse on the Island of Montreal in present-day C\u00f4te-des-Neiges and Saint-Laurent which drained into the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies. C\u00f4te-des-Neiges Road follows the path of the former creek between the two summits of Mount Royal. In the 1950s or early 1960s, the city of Montreal covered over the creek, making it into an underground collector sewer. It was possibly named after Pierre Raimbault (1671\u20131740), landowner and notary. ==References== Category:Rivers of Quebec Category:C\u00f4te-des-Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame- de-Gr\u00e2ce Category:Saint-Laurent, Quebec ",
