    "text": "Vayetze, Vayeitzei, or Vayetzei ( \u2014 Hebrew for \"and he left,\" the first word in the parashah) is the seventh weekly Torah portion (, parashah) in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading. It constitutes . The parashah tells of Jacob's travels to, life in, and return from Haran. The parashah recounts Jacob's dream of a ladder to heaven, Jacob's meeting of Rachel at the well, Jacob's time working for Laban and living with Rachel and Leah, the birth of Jacob's children, and the departure of Jacob's family from Laban. The parashah is made up of 7,512 Hebrew letters, 2,021 Hebrew words, 148 verses, and 235 lines in a Torah Scroll (, Sefer Torah). Jews read it the seventh Sabbath after Simchat Torah, generally in November or December. Landscape with the Dream of Jacob, by Michael Willmann, c. 1691 ==Readings== In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , aliyot. In the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Parashah Vayetze is unusual in that it is entirely contained in one single \"open portion\" (, petuchah) (roughly equivalent to a paragraph, often abbreviated with the Hebrew letter (peh)). And within that single open portion, Parashah Vayetze does not have any \"closed portion\" (, setumah) divisions (abbreviated with the Hebrew letter (samekh)).See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Bereishis/Genesis. Edited by Menachem Davis, pages 157\u201385. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2006. . Jacob's Ladder (painting circa 1800 by William Blake) ===First reading \u2014 Genesis 28:10\u201322=== In the first reading (, aliyah), when Jacob left Beersheba for Haran, he stopped at a place for the night, using a stone for a pillow. He dreamed that he saw a ladder to heaven on which God's angels ascended and descended. And God stood beside him and promised to give him and his numerous descendants the land on which he lay, said that through his descendants all the earth would be blessed, and promised to stay with him wherever he went and bring him back to the land. Jacob awoke afraid, remarked that surely the place was the house of God, the gate of heaven, and called the place Bethel (although the Canaanites had called the city Luz). Jacob took the stone from under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on it. And Jacob vowed that if God would stay with him, give him bread and clothing, and return him to his father's house in peace, then God would be his god, the stone pillar would be God's house, and he would give God a tenth of what he received. The first reading (, aliyah) ends here with the end of chapter See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Bereishis/Genesis. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 160. Jacob and Rachel (painting circa 1520\u20131525 by Palma il Vecchio) ===Second reading \u2014 Genesis 29:1\u201317=== In the second reading (, aliyah), in chapter Jacob came to an eastern land where he saw a well with a great stone rolled upon it and three flocks of sheep lying by it. Jacob asked the men where they were from, and they said Haran. Jacob asked them if they knew Laban, and they said that they did. Jacob asked if Laban was well, and they said that he was, and that his daughter Rachel was coming with his sheep. Jacob told the men to water and feed the sheep, but they replied that they could not do so until all the flocks had arrived. When Jacob saw Rachel arrive with her father's sheep, he rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered Laban's sheep. Jacob kissed Rachel, wept, and told her that he was her kinsman, and she ran and told her father. When Laban heard of Jacob's arrival, he ran to meet him, embraced and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all that had happened, and Laban welcomed Jacob as family. After Jacob had lived with Laban for a month, Laban asked Jacob what wages he wanted for his work. Laban had two daughters: The elder, Leah, had weak eyes, while the younger, Rachel, was beautiful. The second reading (, aliyah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Bereishis/Genesis. Edited by Menachem Davis, pages 163\u201364. Jacob Tells Laban that He Will Work for Rachel (woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld from the 1860 Die Bibel in Bildern) Jacob Talks with Laban (illustration from the 1897 Bible Pictures and What They Teach Us by Charles Foster) ===Third reading \u2014 Genesis 29:18\u201330:13=== In the third reading (, aliyah), Jacob loved Rachel and, responding to Laban's enquiry in verse 15, offered to serve Laban seven years for Rachel's hand, to which Laban agreed. Jacob served the years, but his love for Rachel made them seem like just a few days. Jacob asked Laban for his wife, and Laban made a feast and invited all the men of the place. In the evening, Laban brought Leah to Jacob, and Jacob slept with her. Laban gave Leah Zilpah to be her handmaid. In the morning, Jacob discovered that it was Leah, and he complained to Laban that he had served for Rachel. Laban replied that in that place, they did not give the younger before the firstborn, but if Jacob fulfilled Leah's week, he would give Jacob both daughters in exchange for another seven years of service. Jacob did so, and Laban gave him Rachel to wife, and gave Rachel Bilhah to be her handmaid. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, so God allowed Leah to conceive, but Rachel was barren. Leah bore a son, and called him Reuben, saying that God had looked upon her affliction. She bore a second son, and called him Simeon, saying that God had heard that she was hated. She bore a third son, and called him Levi, saying that this time her husband would be joined to her. She bore a fourth son, and called him Judah, saying that this time, she would praise God. Rachel envied her sister, and demanded that Jacob give her children, but Jacob grew angry and asked her whether he was in God's stead, who had withheld children from her. Rachel told Jacob to sleep with her maid Bilhah, so that Bilhah might bear children upon Rachel's knees who might be credited to Rachel, and he did. Bilhah bore Jacob a son, and Rachel called him Dan, saying that God had judged her and also heard her voice. And Bilhah bore Jacob a second son, and Rachel called him Naphtali, saying that she had wrestled with her sister and prevailed. When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she gave Jacob her maid Zilpah to wife. Zilpah bore Jacob a son, and Leah called him Gad, saying that fortune had come. And Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, and Leah called him Asher, saying that she was happy, for the daughters would call her happy.

Mandrake roots (illustration from a 7th-century manuscript of Pedanius Dioscorides De Materia Medica) ===Fourth reading \u2014 Genesis 30:14\u201327=== A Shepherd (illustration from the 1897 Bible Pictures and What They Teach Us by Charles Foster) In the fourth reading (, aliyah), Reuben found some mandrakes and brought them to Leah. Rachel asked Leah for the mandrakes, and when Leah resisted, Rachel agreed that Jacob would sleep with Leah that night in exchange for the mandrakes. When Jacob came home that evening, Leah told him that he had to sleep with her because she had hired him with the mandrakes, and he did. God heeded Leah and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son, and called him Issachar, saying that God had given her a reward. Leah bore Jacob a sixth son and called him Zebulun, saying that God had endowed her with a good dowry. And afterwards Leah bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah. God heeded Rachel and she conceived and bore a son and called him Joseph, invoking God to add another son. Then Jacob asked Laban to allow him, his wives, and his children to return to his own country. Laban conceded that God had blessed him for Jacob's sake. The fourth reading (, aliyah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Bereishis/Genesis. Edited by Menachem Davis, page 172. ===Fifth reading \u2014 Genesis 30:28\u201331:16=== In the fifth reading (, aliyah), Laban asked Jacob to name how much he wanted to stay. Jacob recounted how he had served Laban and how Laban had benefited, and asked when he could provide for his own family. Laban pressed him again, so Jacob offered to keep Laban's flock in exchange for the speckled, spotted, and dark sheep and goats, and thus Laban could clearly tell Jacob's flock from his. Laban agreed, but that day he removed the speckled and spotted goats and dark sheep from his flock and gave them to his sons and put three day's distance between Jacob and himself. Jacob peeled white streaks in fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees and set the rods where the flocks would see them when they mated, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted young. Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the stronger sheep, but not before the feeble, so the feebler sheep became Laban's and the stronger Jacob's. Jacob's flocks and wealth thus increased. Jacob heard that Laban's sons thought that he had become wealthy at Laban's expense, and Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him as before. God told Jacob to return to the land of his fathers, and that God would be with him. Jacob called Rachel and Leah to the field and told them that Laban had changed his opinion of Jacob, but Jacob had served Laban wholeheartedly and God had remained with Jacob. Jacob noted that Laban had mocked him and changed his wages ten times, but God would not allow him to harm Jacob, but had rewarded Jacob, giving Laban's animals to Jacob. Jacob said that in a dream God told him to return to the land of his birth. Rachel and Leah answered that they no longer had any portion in Laban's house and all the riches that God had taken from Laban were theirs and their children's, so Jacob should do whatever God had told him to do. The fifth reading (, aliyah) ends here.See, e.g., Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary. Edited by David L. Lieber, page 181. New York: The Rabbinical Assembly, 2001. . Jacob Flies Away from Laban (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) Laban Looks for Idols (18th- century painting by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo) ===Sixth reading \u2014 Genesis 31:17\u201342=== In the sixth reading (, aliyah), Jacob set his sons and his wives on camels and headed out toward Isaac and Canaan with all the animals and wealth that he had collected in Padan-aram. Jacob tricked Laban by fleeing secretly while Laban was out shearing his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's idols. On the third day, Laban heard that Jacob had fled and he and his kin pursued after Jacob seven days, overtaking him in the mountain of Gilead. God came to Laban in a dream and told him not to speak to Jacob either good or bad. But when Laban caught up with Jacob, he asked Jacob what he meant by carrying away his daughters secretly, like captives, without letting him kiss his daughters and grandchildren goodbye. Laban said that while he had the power to harm Jacob, God had told him the previous night not to speak to Jacob either good or bad, and now Laban wanted to know why Jacob had stolen his gods. Jacob answered that he fled secretly out of fear that Laban might take his daughters by force, and not knowing Rachel stole the gods, he told Laban that whoever had his gods would die. Laban searched Jacob's tent, Leah's tent, and the two maid-servants' tent, finding nothing, and then he entered Rachel's tent. Rachel had hidden the idols in the camel's saddle and sat upon them, apologizing to her father for not rising, as she was having her period. Laban searched and felt about the tent, but did not find the idols. Angered, Jacob questioned Laban what he had done to deserve this hot pursuit and this searching. Jacob protested that he had worked for Laban for 20 years, through drought and frost, bearing the loss of animals torn by predators, and not eating Laban's rams, only to have his wages changed 10 times. Had not the God of Isaac been on Jacob's side, surely Laban would have sent Jacob away empty, Jacob said, and God had seen his affliction and awarded him what he deserved. The sixth reading (, aliyah) ends here.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Bereishis/Genesis, page 183. The Heap of Witnesses (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible) ===Seventh reading \u2014 Genesis 31:43\u201332:3=== In the seventh reading (, aliyah), Laban answered Jacob that they were his daughters, his children, and his flocks, but asked what he could do about it now. Instead, Laban proposed that they make a covenant, and Jacob set up a stone pillar and with his kin heaped stones, and they ate a meal by the heap. Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. Laban called the heap as a witness between him and Jacob, and invoked God to watch, when they were apart, if Jacob would afflict Laban's daughters and take other wives. And Laban designated the heap and the pillar as a boundary between him and Jacob; Laban would not pass over it to Jacob, and Jacob would not pass over it to Laban, to do harm. Laban invoked the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of Terah, and Jacob swore by the Fear of Isaac and offered a sacrifice. In the maftir () reading of that concludes the parashah, early in the morning, Laban kissed his sons and his daughters, blessed them, and departed for his home. And when Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him, and Jacob told them that this was God's camp, and he called the place Mahanaim.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. . ===Genesis chapter 28=== In Jacob received three blessings: (1) by Isaac when Jacob was disguised as Esau in (2) by Isaac when Jacob was departing for Haran in and (3) by God in Jacob's dream at Bethel in Whereas the first blessing was one of material wellbeing and dominance, only the second and third blessings conveyed fertility and the Land of Israel. The first and the third blessings explicitly designated Jacob as the conveyor of blessing, although arguably the second blessing did that as well by giving Jacob \"the blessing of Abraham\" in Only the third blessing vouchsafed God's Presence with Jacob. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:Ivory;\" |- ! style=\"background:Navajowhite;\"| Isaac Blessing the Disguised Jacob ! style=\"background:Navajowhite;\"| Isaac Blessing Jacob on Departure ! style=\"background:Navajowhite;\"| God Blessing Jacob at Bethel |- |28 God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fat places of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine. 29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you.

In Jacob took the stone on which he had slept, set it up as a pillar (, matzeivah) and poured oil on the top of it. would later direct the Israelites to break the Canaanites' pillars into pieces (, matzeivoteihem). would direct the Israelites not to rear up a pillar (, matzeivah). And would prohibit them to set up a pillar (, matzeivah) \"which the Lord your God hates\". Hosea recounted that at Bethel, Jacob met and communed with God. ===Genesis chapter 29=== Jacob's meeting of Rachel at the well in is the Torah's second of several meetings at watering holes that lead to marriage. Also of the same type scene are Abraham's servant's meeting (on behalf of Isaac) of Rebekah at the well in and Moses' meeting of Zipporah at the well in Each involves (1) a trip to a distant land, (2) a stop at a well, (3) a young woman coming to the well to draw water, (4) a heroic drawing of water, (5) the young woman going home to report to her family, (6) the visiting man brought to the family, and (7) a subsequent marriage.See Victor P.

Similarly, God remembered Noah to deliver him from the flood in God promised to remember God's covenant not to destroy the Earth again by flood in God remembered Abraham to deliver Lot from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in God remembered God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage in and Moses called on God to remember God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to deliver the Israelites from God's wrath after the incident of the Golden Calf in and God promised to \"remember\" God's covenant with Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham to deliver the Israelites and the Land of Israel in the Israelites were to blow upon their trumpets to be remembered and delivered from their enemies in Samson called on God to deliver him from the Philistines in Hannah prayed for God to remember her and deliver her from childlessness in 1 Samuel and God remembered Hannah's prayer to deliver her from childlessness in Hezekiah called on God to remember Hezekiah's faithfulness to deliver him from sickness in 2 Kings and Jeremiah called on God to remember God's covenant with the Israelites to not condemn them in Jeremiah called on God to remember him and think of him, and avenge him of his persecutors in God promises to remember God's covenant with the Israelites and establish an everlasting covenant in God remembers the cry of the humble in Zion to avenge them in Psalm David called upon God to remember God's compassion and mercy in Asaph called on God to remember God's congregation to deliver them from their enemies in God remembered that the Israelites were only human in Ethan the Ezrahite called on God to remember how short Ethan's life was in God remembers that humans are but dust in God remembers God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in God remembers God's word to Abraham to deliver the Israelites to the Land of Israel in the Psalmist calls on God to remember him to favor God's people, to think of him at God's salvation, that he might behold the prosperity of God's people in God remembered God's covenant and repented according to God's mercy to deliver the Israelites in the wake of their rebellion and iniquity in the Psalmist calls on God to remember God's word to God's servant to give him hope in God remembered us in our low estate to deliver us from our adversaries in Job called on God to remember him to deliver him from God's wrath in Nehemiah prayed to God to remember God's promise to Moses to deliver the Israelites from exile in and Nehemiah prayed to God to remember him to deliver him for good in ==In classical rabbinic interpretation== The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:For more on classical rabbinic interpretation, see, e.g., Yaakov Elman. \"Classical Rabbinic Interpretation.\" In The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition. Edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, pages 1859\u201378. ===Genesis chapter 28=== Rabbi Judan taught in Rabbi Aibu's name that the words, \"the righteous comes out of trouble,\" in allude to Jacob, as reports, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba\" (and away from Esau, who sought to kill him).Genesis Rabbah 67:13. Land of Israel, 5th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 615. London: Soncino Press, 1939. . A Midrash noted that reports that Abraham sent Eliezer to woo Rebekah with ten camels and \"having all goodly things of his master's in his hand,\" but Jacob traveled to Haran without a single ring or bracelet. Rabbi Haninah taught that Isaac sent Jacob away empty-handed. Rabbi Joshua, however, taught that Isaac sent Jacob well provided, but Esau arose and stripped him of all he had. The Midrash taught that Jacob then thought to himself that he would not lose confidence in God, for as teaches, his help would come from God. As teaches, God would not suffer his foot to be moved (, la-mot) and the Midrash taught that this meant that God would not allow Jacob to die (la-mayt). As teaches, God would keep him from all evil, and thus from the evil Esau and Laban. And teaches, God would guard his going out, and thus as reports, \"Jacob went out from Beer-sheba.\"Genesis Rabbah 68:2. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 616. Hezekiah taught that Jacob was 63 years old when Isaac blessed him (as a Baraita taughtBabylonian Talmud Megillah 17a. Babylonia, 6th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Taanit \u2022 Megillah. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 12, page 297. Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2014. .), and Jacob spent another 14 years secluded in the Land of Israel studying under Eber and a further 7 years working for the Matriarchs. Thus he married at the age of 84, whereas Esau married at the age of 40 (as reports). Thus we learn that God hastens the happiness of the wicked and delays that of the righteous.Genesis Rabbah 68:5. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 618. Rabbi Hoshaya noted that already stated, \"And Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan- aram,\" and thus Rabbi Hoshaya asked why says, \"and Jacob went out from Beer- sheba.\" Rabbi Hoshaya taught that Jacob reasoned that when his father desired to emigrate from the Land of Israel, he first sought permission at Beer-sheba, so Jacob too went to Beer-sheba to seek God's permission.Genesis Rabbah 68:5. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 618\u201319. Jacob took one of the stones, put it under his head, and lay down to sleep (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) Rabbi Judan and Rav Huna commented on why says, \"and Jacob went out from Beer-sheba.\" Rabbi Judan taught that it means that Jacob sought to leave \"out of the well of the oath.\" (Be'er, , means \"well.\" And Rabbi Judan connected Sheba, , with shevuah, , which means \"oath,\" as in the oath that reports Abraham and Abimelech swore to each other.) Rabbi Judan taught that Jacob reasoned that he did not want Abimelech to demand that Jacob swear to Abimelech (a commitment of nonaggression) as Jacob's grandfather Abraham swore to him, and so delay Jacob's descendants from entering the Land of Israel for seven generations. (As a result of Abraham's oath to Abimelech, seven generations \u2014 from Abraham to Joshua \u2014 passed before the Israelites entered the Land of Israel. Thus to avoid another seven generations of delay, Jacob went \"out of the well of the oath\" to evade a further commitment of nonaggression.) Rav Huna taught that the words of mean \"out of the well of the birthright.\" Rav Huna taught that Jacob reasoned that he did not wish to allow Esau to rise up against him and assert that Jacob had cheated him by taking his birthright, and thus lose the advantage of Esau's oath (when Esau conveyed his birthright in ). Rabbi Berekiah taught that the words of mean \"out of the well of the blessings.\" Rabbi Berekiah taught that Jacob reasoned that he did not want Esau to rise up against him and assert that Jacob had cheated Jacob by taking Esau's blessings, and so frustrate his mother Rebekah's labors on his behalf.Genesis Rabbah 68:7. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 619\u201320. Jacob's Dream (1639 painting by Jusepe de Ribera) Our Rabbis taught that Jacob reached Haran on that same day as reports that he \"went toward Haran.\" Rabbi Berekiah said in Rabbi Isaac's name, however, that merely speaks as people do colloquially when they say, \"So-and-so has gone to Caesarea,\" when in fact So-and-so has not actually arrived in Caesarea. (Similarly, here does not mean that Jacob reached Haran on the same day that he set out.)Genesis Rabbah 68:8. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 620. Once in the meat market of Emmaus, Rabbi Akiva asked Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua about the words of \"And the sun rose on him,\" inquiring whether the sun rose on only him and not on everyone. Rabbi Isaac said that it meant that the sun which had set early for his sake now rose early for him. Rabbi Isaac noted that reports that Jacob left Beersheba in the south of the Land of Israel and went toward Haran north of the Land, and reports that \"he lighted upon the place\" identified (in ) as Bethel in the center of the Land. Rabbi Isaac explained that when he reached Haran, he asked himself how he could have passed through the place where his fathers had prayed and not have prayed there too. So Rabbi Isaac deduced that he immediately resolved to turn back, and as soon he did, the earth contracted and he immediately \"lighted upon the place.\" After he prayed, he sought to return to Haran, but God chose to give this righteous man a night's rest and immediately (as reports) \"the sun was set.\"Babylonian Talmud Chullin 91b. Jacob's Dream (watercolor circa 1896\u20131902 by James Tissot) Reading the words, \"And he lighted upon the place,\" in to mean, \"And he met the Divine Presence (Shechinah)\" Rav Huna asked in Rabbi Ammi's name why assigns to God the name \"the Place.\" Rav Huna explained that it is because God is the Place of the world (the world is contained in God, and not God in the world). Rabbi Jose ben Halafta taught that we do not know whether God is the place of God's world or whether God's world is God's place, but from which says, \"Behold, there is a place with Me,\" it follows that God is the place of God's world, but God's world is not God's place. Rabbi Isaac taught that reading \"The eternal God is a dwelling place,\" one cannot know whether God is the dwelling-place of God's world or whether God's world is God's dwelling-place. But reading \"Lord, You have been our dwelling-place,\" it follows that God is the dwelling-place of God's world, but God's world is not God's dwelling-place. And Rabbi Abba ben Judan taught that God is like a warrior riding a horse with the warrior's robes flowing over on both sides of the horse. The horse is subsidiary to the rider, but the rider is not subsidiary to the horse. Thus says, \"You ride upon Your horses, upon Your chariots of victory.\"Genesis Rabbah 68:9. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 620\u201321. In his dream he saw a stairway reaching from Earth to Heaven. (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) The Gemara noted that reports that \"he took of the stones of the place\" (in the plural) but reports that \"he took the stone\" (in the singular). Rabbi Isaac deduced that all the stones gathered themselves together into the same place so as to be the stone upon which this righteous man would rest his head, and as a Tanna taught in a Baraita, all the stones merged into one. Rabbi Levi taught that on the night described in God showed Jacob all the signs. God showed Jacob a ladder standing from the earth to the heaven, as says, \"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven.\" And Rabbi Levi taught that the ministering angels were ascending and descending on the ladder, and they saw the face of Jacob, and they said that Jacob's was the face like the face of one of the living creatures (, chayot) that Ezekiel saw in on the Throne of Glory. The angels who had been on earth ascended to see Jacob's face. Some angels ascended and some descended, as says, \"And behold the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.\" Rabbi Levi taught that God showed Jacob the four kingdoms, their rule and their destruction. God showed Jacob the prince of the kingdom of Babylon ascending 70 rungs, and descending. God showed Jaocb the prince of the kingdom of Media ascending 52 rungs and descending. God showed Jacob the prince of the kingdom of Greece ascending 180 rungs and descending. And God showed Jacob the prince of the kingdom of Edom (Rome) ascending, and he was not descending, but was saying (in the words of ), \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\" Jacob replied to him (in the words of ): \"Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit.\" God affirmed that this would be so, even (in the words of ), \"though you should make your nest as high as the eagle.\"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 35.

Jacob's Ladder (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) Rabbi Joshua ben Levi (according to the Jerusalem Talmud and Genesis Rabbah) or a Baraita in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yose the son of Rabbi Haninah (according to the Babylonian Talmud) said that the three daily prayers derived from the Patriarchs, and cited for the proposition that Jews derived the evening prayer from Jacob, arguing that within the meaning of \"came upon\" (, vayifga) meant \"pray,\" just as a similar word (, yifge'u) did in (according to the Jerusalem Talmud) or another similar word (, tifga) did in (according to the Babylonian Talmud and Genesis Rabbah).Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 43a.

Bar Kappara taught that every dream has its interpretation. The \"ladder\" in symbolizes the stairway leading up to the altar in the Temple in Jerusalem. \"Set upon the earth\" implies the altar, as (20:21 in NJPS) says, \"An altar of earth you shall make for Me.\" \"And the top of it reached to heaven\" implies the sacrifices, the odor of which ascended to heaven. \"The angels of God\" symbolize the High Priests. \"Ascending and descending on it\" describes the priests ascending and descending the stairway of the altar. And the words \"and, behold, the Lord stood beside him\" in once again invoke the altar, as in the prophet reports, \"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar.\"Genesis Rabbah 68:12. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 625. The Dream of Jacob (1835 painting by the school of Francesco Solimena) The Rabbis related Jacob's dream in to Sinai. The \"ladder\" symbolizes Mount Sinai. That the ladder is \"set upon (, mutzav) the earth\" recalls which says, \"And they stood (, vayityatzvu) at the nether part of the mount.\" The words of \"and the top of it reached to heaven,\" echo those of \"And the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven.\" \"And behold the angels of God\" alludes to Moses and Aaron. \"Ascending\" parallels \"And Moses went up to God.\" \"And descending\" parallels \"And Moses went down from the mount.\" And the words \"and, behold, the Lord stood beside him\" in parallel the words of \"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai.\" Interpreting Jacob's dream of a ladder in a Tanna taught that the width of the ladder was 8,000 parasangs (perhaps 24,000 miles). The Tanna noted that reports \"the angels of God ascending and descending on it,\" and thus deduced from the plural that at least two angels were ascending and two descending, and when they came to the same place on the ladder, there were four angels abreast. And reports of an angel that \"His body was like the Tarshish,\" and by tradition the sea of Tarshish is 2,000 parasangs long. reports that Jacob \"had a dream.\" And reports that \"God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night.\" The Gemara taught that a dream is a sixtieth part of prophecy.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 57b. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Tractate Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 372. Rabbi Hanan taught that even if the Master of Dreams (an angel, in a dream that truly foretells the future) tells a person that on the next day the person will die, the person should not desist from prayer, for as says, \"For in the multitude of dreams are vanities and also many words, but fear God.\" (Although a dream may seem reliably to predict the future, it will not necessarily come true; one must place one's trust in God.)Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 10b. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Tractate Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 65. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that a person is shown in a dream only what is suggested by the person's own thoughts (while awake), as says, \"As for you, Oh King, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed,\" and says, \"That you may know the thoughts of the heart.\"Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 55b. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Tractate Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 361. When Samuel had a bad dream, he used to quote \"The dreams speak falsely.\" When he had a good dream, he used to question whether dreams speak falsely, seeing as in God says, \"I speak with him in a dream?\" Rava pointed out the potential contradiction between and The Gemara resolved the contradiction, teaching that \"I speak with him in a dream?\" refers to dreams that come through an angel, whereas \"The dreams speak falsely,\" refers to dreams that come through a demon.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 55b.

Jacob at Bethel (illustration from a Bible card published 1900 by the Providence Lithograph Company) A Midrash taught that those angels who escort a person in the Land of Israel do not escort that person outside of the Land. Thus \"the angels of God ascending\" in refers to those who had escorted Jacob in the Land of Israel (who were then returning to heaven) while \"descending\" refers to those who were to escort him outside of the Land.Genesis Rabbah 68:12. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 627. A Tanna taught that the angels ascended to look at the sight of Jacob above and descended to look at the sight below, and they wished to hurt him, and thus immediately (as reports) \"the Lord stood beside him.\" Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish said that were it not expressly stated in the Scripture, we would not dare to say it, but God is made to appear like a man who fans his son to protect him from the heat. Rabbi Johanan taught that the wicked stand over their gods, as says, \"And Pharaoh dreamed, and, behold, he stood over the river.\" (The Egyptians worshiped the Nile as a god.) But God stands over them, as says, \"and, behold, the Lord stood over him.\" (Thus, idolaters must stand over and protect their idols, but God protects God's people.)Genesis Rabbah 69:3. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 631. The Gemara asked what the significance was of God's promise in to give Jacob \"the land on which you lie,\" which would have been about 6 feet of land. Rabbi Isaac deduced that God rolled up the whole Land of Israel and put it under Jacob, thus indicating that his descendants would easily conquer it. A Midrash taught that God's promise to Jacob in \"The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed,\" caused Jacob to ask Joseph in \"Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt.\" The Midrash taught that God's promise in \"The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed,\" implied that if Jacob lay in the land, it would be his, but if not, it would not be his.Mishnat Rabbi Eliezer 346\u201347.

(1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) Rabbi Judan said that Jacob declared that Isaac blessed him with five blessings, and God correspondingly appeared five times to Jacob and blessed him ( and ). And thus, in Jacob \"offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac,\" and not to the God of Abraham and Isaac. Rabbi Judan also said that Jacob wanted to thank God for permitting Jacob to see the fulfillment of those blessings. And the blessing that was fulfilled was that of \"Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you,\" which was fulfilled with regard to Joseph. (And thus Jacob mentioned Isaac then on going down to witness Joseph's greatness.)Genesis Rabbah 94:5. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 872\u201373. Rabbi Akiva taught that for Jacob's sake God divided the sea for Jacob's descendants, for in God told Jacob, \"You shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east.\"Exodus Rabbah 21:8. 10th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by Simon M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 271. London: Soncino Press, 1939. . The Rabbis taught that God's promise in \"and, behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go,\" answered all of Jacob's requests, except that for sustenance. Jacob prayed in \"If God will be with me,\" and God assured Jacob, \"Behold, I am with you.\" Jacob prayed, \"And will keep me,\" and God assured Jacob, \"And I will keep you.\" Jacob prayed, \"In this way that I go,\" and God assured Jacob, \"wherever you go.\" Jacob prayed in \"So that I come back to my father's house in peace,\" and God assured Jacob, \"and will bring you back.\" But the Rabbis taught that God did not answer Jacob's request for sustenance. Rabbi Assi, however, taught that God answered Jacob's request for sustenance, too, for in God says, \"for I will not forsake you,\" and forsaking applies to sustenance, as in , \"Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.\"Genesis Rabbah 69:6.

Jacob's Vision and God's Promise (illustration from a Bible card published 1906 by the Providence Lithograph Company) Rabbi Jacob bar Idi pointed out a contradiction between God's promise to protect Jacob in and Jacob's fear in ; Rabbi Jacob explained that Jacob feared that some sin might cause him to lose the protection of God's promise.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 4a.

Reading the words \"and Jacob vowed a vow\" in a Midrash taught that of four who made vows, two vowed and profited, and two vowed and lost. The Israelites vowed and profited in and Hannah vowed and profited in Jephthah vowed and lost in and Jacob vowed in and lost (some say in the loss of Rachel in and some say in the disgrace of Dinah in for Jacob's vow in was superfluous, as Jacob had already received God's promise, and therefore Jacob lost because of it).Genesis Rabbah 70:3. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 637. Jacob poured oil on the stone (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) Reading the words, \"love the stranger, in giving him food and clothing,\" in Akilas the proselyte asked Rabbi Eliezer whether food and clothing constituted all the benefit of conversion to Judaism. Rabbi Eliezer replied that food and clothing are no small things, for in Jacob prayed to God for \"bread to eat, and clothing to put on,\" while God comes and offers it to the convert on a platter. Akilas then visited Rabbi Joshua, who taught that \"bread\" refers to the Torah (as in Wisdom \u2014 the Torah \u2014 says, \"Come, eat of my bread\") while \"clothing\" means the Torah scholar's cloak. A person privileged to study the Torah is thus privileged to perform God's precepts. Moreover, converts' daughters could marry into the priesthood, so that their descendants could offer burnt-offerings on the altar. The Midrash offered another interpretation: \"Bread\" refers to the showbread, while \"clothing\" refers to the priestly vestments. The Midrash offered yet another interpretation: \"Bread\" refers to challah, while \"clothing\" refers to the first shearings of the sheep, both of which belong to the priests.Genesis Rabbah 70:5.

Reprinted in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 1275. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson Publishers, 2002. . Rabbi Ilai taught that the Sages ordained at Usha that if a person wishes to give charity liberally, the person should not give away more than a fifth of the person's wealth. Rav Nahman (or some say Rav Aha bar Jacob) cited as proof for the proposition, as in the words \"And of all that You shall give me, I will surely give a tenth to You,\" repetition of the verb \"to give a tenth\" or \"tithe\" implies two tenths or one fifth. The Gemara did the math and questioned whether the second tenth would not be less than the first tenth, as it would be taken from the nine-tenths that remained after the first tenth had been given away and thereby represented only 1/10 x 9/10 = 9/100 of the original capital. Rav Ashi replied that the words \"I will . . . give a tenth of it\" in implied that he would make the second like the first.Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 50a. The Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer taught that Jacob wished to ford the Jabbok and was detained there by an angel, who asked Jacob whether Jacob had not told God (in ), \"Of all that you shall give me I will surely give a tenth to You.\" So Jacob gave a tenth of all the cattle that he had brought from Paddan-Aram. Jacob had brought some 5,500 animals, so his tithe came to 550 animals. Jacob again tried to ford the Jabbok, but was hindered again. The angel once again asked Jacob whether Jacob had not told God (in ), \"Of all that you shall give me I will surely give a tenth to You.\" The angel noted that Jacob had sons and that Jacob had not given a tithe of them. So Jacob set aside the four firstborn sons (whom the law excluded from the tithe) of each of the four mothers, and eight sons remained. He began to count from Simeon, and included Benjamin, and continued the count from the beginning. And so Levi was reckoned as the tenth son, and thus the tithe, holy to God, as says, \"The tenth shall be holy to the Lord.\" So the angel Michael descended and took Levi and brought him up before the Throne of Glory and told God that Levi was God's lot. And God blessed him, that the sons of Levi should minister on earth before God (as directed in ) like the ministering angels in heaven.Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 37. Reprinted in, e.g., Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. Translated and annotated by Gerald Friedlander, pages 283\u201384. Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Ahi taught in the name of Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani that Jacob would not have told God, \"of all that You shall give me, I will surely give a tenth to You,\" in unless God had already offered Jacob, \"Ask what I shall give you,\" as God offered Solomon in Rabbi Jonathan taught that God invited three people to ask what God could give them: Solomon in Ahaz in , and the Messiah in Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Ahi in the name of Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani cited two more: Abraham in and Jacob in teaching that neither Patriarch would have asked God unless God had first offered to give them what they asked.Genesis Rabbah 44:8.

Jacob and Rachel at the Well (watercolor circa 1896\u20131902 by James Tissot) ===Genesis chapter 29=== Jacob Meets Rachel at the Well (early to mid-19th-century painting by William Dyce) The Gemara cited the words \"And it came to pass\" (, wa-yehi) in as an exception to the general rule taught by Rabbi Levi, or some say Rabbi Jonathan, in a tradition handed down from the Men of the Great Assembly, that wherever the Bible employs the term \"and it was\" or \"and it came to pass\" (, wa-yehi) it indicates misfortune, as one can read wa-yehi as wai, hi, \"woe, sorrow.\" Thus the words, \"And it came to pass when man began to multiply,\" in are followed by the words, \"God Saw that the wickedness of man was great,\" in And the Gemara also cited the instances of followed by followed by followed by the rest of followed by followed by followed by close after followed by followed by the rest of and followed by Haman. But the Gemara also cited as counterexamples the words, \"And there was evening and there was morning one day,\" in as well as and So Rav Ashi replied that wa-yehi sometimes presages misfortune, and sometimes it does not, but the expression \"and it came to pass in the days of\" always presages misfortune. And for that proposition, the Gemara cited and Babylonian Talmud Megillah 10b. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Taanit \u2022 Megillah. Commentary by Adin Even- Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 12, pages 251\u201352. The Gemara read to employ the euphemistic expression \"not clean,\" instead of the brief, but disparaging expression \"unclean,\" so as not to speak disparagingly of unclean animals. The Gemara reasoned that it was thus likely that Scripture would use euphemisms when speaking of the faults of righteous people, as with the words, \"And the eyes of Leah were weak,\" in Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 123a. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Yosef Asher Weiss; edited by Hersh Goldwurm, volume 46, page 123a3. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1994. . Jacob and Rachel at the Well (19th-century illustration by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld) Rabbi Eleazar interpreted the words \"He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous\" in to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, \"Will you marry me?\" She replied, \"Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you.\" Jacob replied, \"I am his brother in trickery.\" She said to him, \"Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?\" He replied, \"Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle.\" He asked her, \"What is his trickery?\" She replied: \"I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her.\" So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, \"Now my sister will be put to shame,\" so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when reports, \"And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah,\" we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants.Babylonian Talmud Megillah 13a\u2013b. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Taanit \u2022 Megillah.

Dante's Vision of Rachel and Leah (1855 watercolor by Dante Gabriel Rossetti) Rabbi Helbo quoted Rabbi Jonathan to teach that the firstborn should have come from Rachel, as says, \"These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph,\" but Leah prayed for mercy before Rachel did. On account of Rachel's modesty, however, God restored the rights of the firstborn to Rachel's son Joseph from Leah's son Reuben. To teach what caused Leah to anticipate Rachel with her prayer for mercy, Rav taught that Leah's eyes were sore (as reports) from her crying about what she heard at the crossroads. There she heard people saying: \"Rebecca has two sons, and Laban has two daughters; the elder daughter should marry the elder son, and the younger daughter should marry the younger son.\" Leah inquired about the elder son, and the people said that he was a wicked man, a highway robber. And Leah asked about the younger son, and the people said that he was \"a quiet man dwelling in tents.\" So she cried about her fate until her eyelashes fell out. This accounts for the words of \"And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb,\" which mean not that Leah was actually hated, but rather that God saw that Esau's conduct was hateful to Leah, so he rewarded her prayer for mercy by opening her womb first.Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 123a.

Rachel and Leah (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) The seven days of Jacob's wedding feast in are reflected in the Sages' ruling that if a groom developed symptoms of skin disease (tzaraat) they granted him a delay of inspection to the end of the seven days of his marriage feast.Babylonian Talmud Moed Katan 7b. The Pesikta de-Rav Kahana taught that Leah and Rachel were two of seven barren women about whom says (speaking of God), \"He . . . makes the barren woman to dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children.\" The Pesikta de-Rav Kahana also listed Sarah, Rebekah, Manoah's wife, Hannah, and Zion. The Pesikta de-Rav Kahana taught that the words of \"He . . . makes the barren woman to dwell in her house,\" apply to Leah, for reports: \"And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb,\" implying that she had previously been barren. And the words of \"a joyful mother of children,\" apply to Leah, as well, for reports that Leah said, \"I have borne him six sons.\" The Pesikta de-Rav Kahana taught that the words of \"He . . . makes the barren woman to dwell in her house,\" apply to Rachel, for reports: \"Rachel was barren.\" And the words of \"a joyful mother of children,\" apply to Rachel, as well, for reports, \"the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.\"Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, piska 20, paragraph 1. 6th\u20137th century.

A poor person is accounted as dead, for says, \"for all the men are dead who sought your life\" (and the Gemara interpreted this to mean that they had been stricken with poverty). A person affected by skin disease (, metzora) is accounted as dead, for says, \"And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous (, metzora'at). And Aaron said to Moses . . . let her not be as one dead.\" The blind are accounted as dead, for says, \"He has set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.\" And one who is childless is accounted as dead, for in Rachel said, \"Give me children, or else I am dead.\"Babylonian Talmud Nedarim 64b.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000. . Rachel and Leah (watercolor circa 1896\u20131902 by James Tissot) Rabbi Simeon taught that because Rachel treated the righteous Jacob so slightingly (as to trade away sleeping with him for some mandrakes, as reported in ) she was not buried with him. Thus in Rachel said (in unwitting prophecy) \"Therefore, he [Jacob] shall lie with you [Leah],\" hinting that Jacob would lie with Leah in death, and not with Rachel. Rabbi Berekiah taught that Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman commented on this. Rabbi Eleazar said that each wife lost (by the transaction) and each gained. Leah lost the mandrakes and gained the tribes (of Issachar and Zebulun) while Rachel gained the mandrakes and lost the tribes (of Issachar and Zebulun). (And some say, Leah lost the birthright and Rachel gained the birthright. The birthright belonged to Reuben, but as a punishment for Reuben's causing this transaction, the birthright was taken from him and given to Joseph.) Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman said that Leah lost mandrakes and gained (two) tribes and the privilege of burial with Jacob, while Rachel gained mandrakes and lost the tribes and burial with Jacob.Genesis Rabbah 72:3. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 663. Alluding to Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that when a wife summons a husband to his marital duty, they will have children such as were not to be found even in the generation of Moses. For with regard to the generation of Moses, says, \u201cTake wise men, and understanding and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.\u201d But says, \u201cSo I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise men and known,\u201d without mentioning \u201cunderstanding\u201d (implying that Moses could not find men with understanding). And says, \u201cIssachar is a large-boned donkey\u201d (alluding to the Midrash that Leah heard Jacob's donkey, and so came out of her tent to summon Jacob to his marital duty, as reported in ). And 1 Chronicles says, \u201cof the children of Issachar . . . were men who had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do.\u201d But the Gemara limited the teaching of Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani in the name of Rabbi Jonathan by counseling that such behavior is virtuous only when the wife ingratiates herself to her husband without making brazen demands.Babylonian Talmud Eruvin 100b.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000. . Rabbi Johanan taught that the words \"and he lay with her that night\" in in which the word , hu (\"He\") appears in an unusual locution, indicate that God assisted in causing Issachar's conception. Rabbi Johanan found in the words \"Issachar is a large-boned donkey\" in an indication that Jacob's donkey detoured to Leah's tent, helping to cause Issachar's birth.Babylonian Talmud Niddah 31a. Rebbi (or some say Rabbi Judah ben Pazi) said in the name of the academy of Yannai that Dinah was originally conceived as a boy, but when Rachel prayed for another son in God transformed Dinah's fetus into a girl, and that is why the description of Dinah's birth in uses the word \"afterward,\" showing that this happened after Rachel prayed.Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 92a.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2006. . And Rav taught that the word \"afterward\" in signified that Leah bore Dinah \"after\" she passed judgment on herself, reasoning that twelve tribes were destined to issue from Jacob and six had already issued from her and four from the handmaids, and if the child of the current pregnancy were to be a boy, then Rachel would not have as many sons as one of the handmaids.

A Midrash taught that the words of \"He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel,\" allude to the report of \"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her.\"Genesis Rabbah 73:2. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 668. Rabbi Judan said in Rabbi Aibu's name that Rachel was remembered through many prayers. First, for her own sake, as says, \"And God remembered Rachel (, et- Rachel),\" and , et-Rachel, implies for the sake of her sister. \"And God hearkened to her\" for Jacob's sake; \"and opened her womb\" for the sake of the matriarchs.Genesis Rabbah 73:3. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 668-69. A Midrash taught that when says, \"And God remembered Rachel,\" it reports that God remember in her favor her silence on her sister Leah's behalf, for when Leah was being given to Jacob, Rachel knew it, yet was silent.Genesis Rabbah 73:4. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 669. For the Gemara taught (as recounted at greater length above) that when Jacob asked Rachel to marry him, Jacob entrusted Rachel with certain signs by which he might know her in the dark. While Leah was being led into the bridal chamber, Rachel realized that Leah would be disgraced, so Rachel gave Leah the signs. And thus because of what Rachel did, Jacob did not know that it was Leah until the morning. A Midrash taught that it was only just that \"God remembered Rachel,\" because Rachel had allowed her rival Bilhah into her home. Rav Huna and Rabbi Aha in Rabbi Simon's name quoted \"Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin,\" and taught that for the sake of Dan, Rachel was remembered; for the sake of Dan, Joseph and Benjamin were born (as a reward for Rachel's giving her rival Bilhah to Jacob, from whom was born Dan). Rabbi Johanan taught that God holds three keys that God does not entrust to any messenger: the key of rain, the key of childbirth, and the key of the revival of the dead. The Gemara cited to support the proposition that God holds the key of childbirth, as the verse says, \"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.\"Babylonian Talmud Taanit 2a\u2013b. And the Gemara noted that Scripture uses the verb \"bear\" with regard to both childbirth, in \"she conceived, and bore a son,\" and rain, in \"the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, but waters the earth, and makes it bear and bud.\"Babylonian Talmud Taanit 8b. Rabbi Akiva read the words \"God . . . opened her womb\" in to support the proposition that just as there is key to a house, there is a key to a woman's fertility.Babylonian Talmud Bekhorot 45a. Rabbi Judah ben Pazi said in the name of the academy of Rabbi Yannai that Rachel showed that she was a prophetess when in she prophesied that she would bear another son, and by using the singular \"son\" she foretold that Jacob would have just one more son.Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 92a.

Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani, citing Rabbi Johanan, noted that 1 Chronicles reports that \"the children of Issachar . . . had understanding.\" Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani noted that reports that Jacob and Leah conceived Issachar after \"Leah went out to meet him, and said: \u2018You must come to me, for I have surely hired you.'\" In contrast, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani noted that in God told Moses, \"Get you from each one of your tribes, wise men and understanding, and full of knowledge,\" but in Moses reported, \"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men and full of knowledge,\" and Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani thus deduced that Moses could not find men of \"understanding\" in his generation. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani concluded that a woman who solicits her husband to perform the marital obligation, as Leah did, will have children the like of whom did not exist even in the generation of Moses.Babylonian Talmud Eruvin 100b.

The Tosefta deduced from that before Jacob arrived, Laban's house had not received a blessing, and deduced from that it was because of Jacob's arrival that Laban was blessed thereafter.Tosefta Sotah 10:7. Reprinted in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 1, pages 876\u201377. Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon in the name of Hezekiah employed the meaning of the pilgrim's recitation in to help interpret Jacob's statement to Laban in Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon noted that the word \"little\" or \"few\" (, me'at) appears both in Jacob's statement to Laban in \"For it was little (, me'at) that you had before I came, and it has increased abundantly,\" and also in the pilgrim's recitation in \"few (, me'at) in number\" (went down to Egypt). Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon said in the name of Hezekiah that just as in \"few\" (, me'at) means 70 (people), so in \"little\" (, me'at) must also mean 70 (head of cattle and sheep).Genesis Rabbah 73:8 Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis.

Jacob's Flight (1829 illustration by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld) ===Genesis chapter 31=== It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Akiva said that one of three things that he liked about the Medes was that when they held counsel, they did so only in the field. Rav Adda bar Ahabah said that where Jacob called Rachel and Leah to the field, could be cited in support of the practice.Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 8b. Reprinted in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 1, page 52. In the heart can be stolen. A Midrash catalogued the wide range of additional capabilities of the heart reported in the Hebrew Bible.Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:36. The heart speaks,Ecclesiastes sees, hears,1 Kings walks, falls, stands, rejoices, cries, is comforted, is troubled, becomes hardened, grows faint, grieves, fears, can be broken, becomes proud, rebels, invents, cavils, overflows, devises, desires, goes astray, lusts, is refreshed, is humbled, is enticed, errs, trembles, is awakened,Song of Songs loves, hates, envies, is searched, is rent, meditates, is like a fire, is like a stone, turns in repentance, becomes hot, dies, melts, takes in words, is susceptible to fear, gives thanks, covets, becomes hard, makes merry, acts deceitfully, speaks from out of itself, loves bribes, writes words, plans, receives commandments, acts with pride, makes arrangements, and aggrandizes itself. Laban found out that Jacob had left. (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) The Rabbis taught that God appears to non-Jews only in dreams, as God appeared to Laban the \"in a dream of the night\" in God appeared to Abimelech \"in a dream of the night\" in and God appeared to Balaam \"at night\" in The Rabbis taught that God thus appeared more openly to the prophets of Israel than to those of other nations. The Rabbis compared God's action to those of a king who has both a wife and a concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he goes stealthily.Genesis Rabbah 52:5. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, pages 453\u201354. And a Midrash taught that God's appearance to Laban in and God's appearance to Abimelech in were the two instances where the Pure and Holy One allowed God's self to be associated with impure (idolatrous) people, on behalf of righteous ones.Midrash Tanhuma Vayeitzei 12. Laban searched through all the tents. (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) Similarly, a Midrash cited as an application of the principle that all miracles that God did for Israel, and the punishment of the wicked on their behalf, took place at night. To this end, the Midrash cited \"And he divided himself against them by night\"; \"But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night\"; \"And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night\"; \"It was a night of watching unto the Lord . . . this same night\"; \"And it came to pass at midnight\"; \"And there was the cloud and the darkness here, yet gave it light by night there\"; and \"And God came to Balaam at night.\"Numbers Rabbah 20:12. A Midrash taught that the words of \"And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night,\" indicated God's distance from Laban. Rabbi Leazar taught that the words of \"The Lord is far from the wicked,\" refer to the prophets of other nations. But the continuation of \"He hears the prayer of the righteous,\" refers to the prophets of Israel. God appears to nations other that Israel only as one who comes from a distance, as says, \"They came from a far country to me.\" But in connection with the prophets of Israel, says, \"And the Lord appeared,\" and says, \"And the Lord called,\" implying from the immediate vicinity. Rabbi Haninah compared the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of other nations to a king who was with his friend in a chamber (separated by a curtain). Whenever the king desired to speak to his friend, he folded up the curtain and spoke to him. (But God speaks to the prophets of other nations without folding back the curtain.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who has a wife and a concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he repairs with stealth. Similarly, God appears to non-Jews only at night, as says, \"And God came to Balaam at night,\" and says, \"And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night.\" The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that Laban took all the men of his city, mighty men, and pursued after Jacob, seeking to slay him. Then the angel Michael descended, and drew his sword behind Laban, seeking to slay him. Michael told Laban (as reported in ): \"Do not speak to Jacob, either good or bad.\"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 36. Reprinted in, e.g., Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. Translated and annotated by Gerald Friedlander, page 273. Rabbi Johanan taught in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that all the favors that the wicked do for the righteous are in fact evil for the righteous. For in God told Laban, \"Take heed to yourself that you speak not to Jacob either good or evil.\" Rabbi Johanan observed that one can understand why God would direct Laban not to speak evil to Jacob, but asked why God would direct him not to say anything good. From here Rabbi Johanan inferred that even if Laban had tried to speak good to Jacob, it would have resulted in bad for Jacob.Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 103a\u2013b. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Yosef Davis, Dovid Kamenetsky, Moshe Zev Einhorn, Michoel Weiner, Israel Schneider, Nasanel Kasnett, and Mendy Wachsman; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr, Chaim Malinowitz, and Mordechai Marcus, volume 25, pages 103a4\u2013b1. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2005. . The Reconciliation of Jacob and Laban (17th-century painting by Ciro Ferri) Rabbi Aibu taught that when Laban's grandchildren heard Laban ask in \"Why have you stolen my gods?\" they exclaimed that they were ashamed that in his old age their grandfather could say that these idols were his gods.Genesis Rabbah 74:8. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, pages 681\u201382. Laban and Jacob Make a Covenant Together (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) A Midrash taught that Rachel's death ensued because Jacob told Laban in \"With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live.\" The Midrash thus taught that Jacob's words were (in the words of Ecclesiastes ) \"like an error that proceeds from a ruler.\"Ecclesiastes Rabbah 10:6. Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Levi's name may have drawn on for the proposition that Laban tried to destroy Jacob. Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Levi's name read to say, \"The blessing of the destroyer (, oved) came upon me,\" and interpreted \"The blessing of the destroyer (, oved)\" to allude to Laban the Syrian. Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Levi's name thus read to say, \"An Aramean (Laban) sought to destroy (, oved) my father (Jacob).\" (Thus Laban sought to destroy Jacob by, perhaps among other things, cheating Jacob out of payment for his work, as Jacob recounted in This interpretation thus reads , oved, as a transitive verb.) Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Hama ben Haninah thus explained that Rebekah was remembered with the blessing of children only after Isaac prayed for her, so that the heathens in Rebekah's family might not say that their prayer in caused that result. Rather, God answered Isaac's prayer, as reports, \"And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife . . . and his wife Rebekah conceived.\"Genesis Rabbah 60:13. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 2, page 536. The Gemara interpreted the words, \"If you shall afflict my daughters, and if you shall take wives beside my daughters,\" in to mean that Jacob forswore two kinds of affliction. The Gemara read \"if you shall afflict\" to mean by denying conjugal duty, and the Gemara read \"if you shall take\" to refer to marrying rival wives. Thus the Gemara deduced that abstention from marital intercourse is considered an affliction.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 77a\u2013b. ===Genesis chapter 32=== Rav taught that Jacob's merit saved later Israelites. reports that after King David ordered a census of the Israelites, God punished the Israelites with a plague. then reports, \"And as He was about to destroy, the Lord beheld, and He repented Him.\" The Gemara asked what God beheld that caused God to withhold destruction. Rav taught that God beheld (the merit of) Jacob, as says, \"And Jacob said when he beheld them (the angels that would protect Israel): 'This is God's camp.'\"Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 62b.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997. . ==In modern interpretation== The parashah is discussed in these modern sources: Gunkel ===Genesis chapters 25\u201333=== The early 20th century German scholar Hermann Gunkel wrote that the legend cycle of Jacob-Esau-Laban divided clearly into the legends (1) of Jacob and Esau ( ), (2) of Jacob and Laban ( ), (3) of the origin of the twelve tribes (), and (4) of the origin of ritual observances ( 22\u201332).Hermann Gunkel.

Professor Walter Brueggemann, formerly of Columbia Theological Seminary, suggested a chiastic structure to the Jacob narrative (shown in the chart below), moving from conflict with Esau to reconciliation with Esau. Within that is conflict with Laban moving to covenant with Laban. And within that, at the center, is the narrative of births, in which the birth of Joseph (at ) marks the turning point in the entire narrative, after which Jacob looks toward the Land of Israel and his brother Esau. In the midst of the conflicts are the two major encounters with God, which occur at crucial times in the sequence of conflicts.Walter Brueggemann.

Fretheim. \"The Book of Genesis.\" In The New Interpreter's Bible. Edited by Leander E. Keck, volume 1, page 519. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1994. . Archeologists Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University and Neil Asher Silberman argue that the stories about Jacob and Laban metaphorically express the complex and stormy relations between the nations of Aram and Israel over many centuries.Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, page 39. New York: The Free Press, 2001. . Professor Cynthia Chapman of Oberlin College suggested that Judeans compiled and edited the ancestor narratives in Genesis after the Babylonian captivity to serve as stories of national origin. Chapman noted that several recurring themes of the Patriarchal narratives spoke to the exilic reality of those who preserved the stories. These stories emphasize God's presence and power transcending national boundaries, the special covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, the eternal nature of their covenant relationship, and the everlasting gift of the Promised Land. The stories also acknowledge tensions that threaten the protagonists. Jacob spent most of his adult life in Mesopotamia, and stories of hard-won children who were born into a land inheritance spoke powerfully to an exilic community that had lost many children to war and sickness during the long journey to exile. The Israelites viewed their world as a family tree; the story of Jacob's family became the basis for how the Israelites understood themselves socially and politically as an alliance of 12 tribes; and where tribes stood in relation to each other. The process by which Jacob became Israel involved fleeing, exile, and hard labor. From the perspective of a people exiled from their land living in Mesopotamia, Jacob's story was a powerful story of redemption. The Tribe of Judah also endured hard labor, took wives and had children, replenishing themselves into something resembling a nation. Many would build wealth in exile, and when they returned during the Persian period, they returned not as Judah, but as Israel, renamed before they crossed the Jordan River back into the Promised Land.Cynthia R. Chapman. \u201cAncestor Narratives in Genesis.\u201d In The World of Biblical Israel, lecture 3. Chantilly, Virginia: The Great Courses, 2013. ===Genesis chapter 28=== Professor Ephraim Speiser of the University of Pennsylvania in the mid 20th century saw in two accounts about Jacob's first stay at Bethel that were blended into a single sequence. and 17 use the Divine name Elohim (), while and 16 use the Tetragrammaton (). Speiser argued that taken as a unit, the fused version is repetitious, but separately, each strand represents an independent tradition. Speiser thus cited as an instance when the Tetragrammaton and Elohim occur in otherwise duplicate narratives, and the presence of the Priestly source is ruled out on other grounds, evincing the probability that the passages with Elohim point to a source that is neither the Jahwist nor the Priestly source, and thus evidently the Elohist. Similarly, Speiser saw further evidence in the doublet of where Jacob's wealth is attributed to his own shrewdness, but Jacob refers to the Tetragrammaton, while the next account in 11, credits Jacob's success to the advice of an angel of God \u2014 called Elohim \u2014 who conveyed it to Jacob in a dream.Ephraim A. Speiser. Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes, volume 1, page xxx. New York: Anchor Bible, 1964. . Brueggemann noted that reflects the standard promise to the Patriarchs, but in God addressed a promise peculiarly to Jacob. Brueggemann identified three parts to the promise: (1) \u201cI am with you.\u201d In a central thrust of Biblical faith, God commits to accompany the empty-handed fugitive in places of threat. (2) \u201cI will keep you.\u201d Like a shepherd, the Keeper of Israel guarantees the lives of those who are exposed and defenseless. (3) The promise of homecoming. Brueggemann argued that makes clear that God does watch over God's promise and bring it to fulfillment.Walter Brueggemann. Genesis: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching, pages 244\u201346. ===Genesis chapter 29=== Professor Nahum Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, reported that modern scholars deduce from the Genesis listings of Jacob's sons the evolution of the league of Israelite tribes. These scholars deduce from the listing of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah as Leah tribes that they were politically related. As their tribal territories were not contiguous, their organizing principle could not have been geographical, and their association must therefore reflect a presettlement reality. These scholars conclude that the six Leah tribes must have originated as a separate fraternity in Mesopotamia that evolved in two distinct stages. The account of the birth of Jacob's sons in preserves the earliest traditions. The position of Judah as the fourth son reflects the situation prior to Judah's ascendancy, reflected in The handmaid tribes had a subordinate status. And the tribe of Benjamin was the last to join the Israelite league and came into being in Canaan.Nahum M. Sarna.

Shlomo Ganzfried, editor of the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch told how some Jews emulate Jacob's action in by sleeping with a stone under their head on Tisha B'Av, the annual fast day to commemorate the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that on Tisha B'Av, people should make themselves uncomfortable when they go to bed at night. If they are used to sleeping with two pillows, on Tisha B'Av, they should sleep on one. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch reported that some thus have the custom on the night of Tisha B'Av of sleeping on the ground with a stone under their head as a reminder of what says of Jacob: \"He took from the stones of the place.\" The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch told that on that night, Jacob had a vision of the destruction of the Temple and said (in the words of ), \"How awesome is this place.\"Shlomo Ganzfried.

The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that it is forbidden to hold two weddings for two siblings on the same day, because one should not mix one celebration with another celebration. And the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch reported that some authorities taught that one should not hold two weddings for two siblings in the same week, because speaks of Jacob fulfilling \"the week\" of the newlywed Leah before marrying her sister Rachel.Shlomo Ganzfried.

Based on Jacob's words in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that just as an employer is enjoined not to steal a poor worker's wages nor pay them late, a worker is warned not to neglect the employer's work, and is obliged to work with all the worker's might, as Jacob said of his working for Laban in \"with all my power I have served your father.\" Therefore, workers are not allowed to work at night and then hire themselves out during the day, because they will already be weak from their night work. Similarly, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that one is not allowed to work one's animal by night and then hire it out during the day. And workers are not allowed to starve or stint themselves, because this weakens their strength so that they will not be able to do their work properly.Shlomo Ganzfried.
