The group, which had not released an album since 2001's Iron Flag, signed a one-album deal with Steve Rifkind's SRC Records in December 2006. Wu-Tang's four previous albums were all released on Rifkind's now-defunct Loud Records. On Sunday, August 5, 2007, at the Virgin Festival in Baltimore, RZA announced that the release date for the album would be November 13, 2007, noting that this is the third anniversary of the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard. However, the date was delayed to December 11, 2007. In a released statement, group leader RZA commented on the need for the group's return, stating \"This is the perfect time for us to come back; the stars are aligned. It's like when we first started with Steve. We put out real hip-hop at a time when it was turning into pop or R&B.; We brought the focus back to the music in its rawest form, without studio polish or radio hooks.... People want something that gives them an adrenaline rush. We're here to supply that fix. How could hip-hop be dead if Wu-Tang is forever? We're here to revive the spirit and the economics and bring in a wave of energy that has lately dissipated\".Strong, Nolan. Wu-Tang Clan Reunites, Preparing '8 Diagrams' . AllHipHop.com.

USA Todays Steve Jones commended the group members' performances despite the absence of Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard, stating \"the lyrical swords wielded by the nine surviving members are as razor-sharp as ever\". Rolling Stone writer Christian Hoard called it \"a terrific mix of classic Clan grime and enough new tricks to justify Inspectah Deck's claim that 'Wu-Tang keep it fresh like Tupperware.'\". Marisa Brown of Allmusic praised RZA's production, writing that \"It's beautifully, impeccably produced, from the soundtrack strings and horns, to the philosophical samples and guitars that are interspersed throughout ... it deepens and grows with every listen.\" Brown elaborated on its production and perceived 8 Diagrams as a departure from previous RZA-produced Wu-Tang Clan work, stating: However, Entertainment Weeklys Neil Drumming commented that the album is \"... a drab dilution of the Wu's signature sample-heavy, raucous sound.\" Thomas Golianopolous of Spin viewed that \"The beats are mostly to blame [...] skeletal, low-key tracks that rarely match the rappers' palpable energy\". Giving the album 2 out of 4 stars, Los Angeles Times called its arrangements \"largely tepid\" and wrote that several songs lack the rappers' \"distinctive personalities\". Slant Magazine's Dave Hughes wrote that the album \"fails to cohere into anything greater than the sum of its parts\" and expressed a mixed response towards RZA's production, stating \"when RZA isn't attempting to tone-deafly integrate other people's old sounds into his old sounds, he just sticks with his old sounds\".Hughes, Dave (2007-12-11).

That word has never been more appropriate than with 8 Diagrams. RZA taps into his Ghost Dog and Kill Bill experiences to create imaginary film music, moody would-be scores to Westerns, martial arts, sci-fi and gangster films.\" Blenders Jonah Weiner commended RZA's production as well, stating \"RZA has always been hip-hop\u2019s reigning minimalist, but his work scoring Kill Bill, most recently, seems to have strengthened his ear for ambiance and texture.\" Weiner also complimented Method Man's delivery and rhymes on the album, stating that he sounds \"rejuvenated.\" Pitchfork Media's Nate Patrin complimented the group members' lyricism. Sam Richards of Uncut gave 8 Diagrams 4 out of 5 stars, and stated \"RZA\u2019s lurching beats and raw, spectral productions, peppered with kung-fu film samples, are back to their thrillingly weird best. RZA\u2019s dictatorial rule has ostracised Ghost and Raekwon, but you can\u2019t argue with the results.
