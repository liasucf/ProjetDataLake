    "text": "Seal of Constantine, patrikios, hypatos, and anagrapheus of Bulgaria Anagrapheus () was a Byzantine fiscal office in the 9th\u201312th centuries. The title does not appear in the lists of offices (taktika), but is attested on seals and monastic charters, with the first occurrence ca. 750\u2013850, and the last secured mention in 1189. Franz D\u00f6lger thought that the office continued in existence until 1204, after which it was replaced by the apographeus. The duties of the office were related with the revision of the cadaster; each anagrapheus was usually sent to a particular theme. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, his \"functions were hardly distinguishable from those of the epoptes\". == References == == Sources == * Category:Byzantine fiscal offices ",
