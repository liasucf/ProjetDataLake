    "text": "Wanderson Souza Carneiro (born 23 February 1987), known as Baiano, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Turkish club Alanyaspor as a right back. ==Club career== Born in Correntina, Bahia, Baiano spent most of his career in his country in the lower leagues. His professional input consisted of six S\u00e9rie B games for Vila Nova Futebol Clube, who finished in 20th and last position. In late July 2008, Baiano moved to Portugal where he would remain the following decade, starting with C.F. Os Belenenses. He appeared rarely for the Lisbon-based club in his only season, as the team suffered relegation from the Primeira Liga only to be reinstated due to C.F. Estrela da Amadora's financial irregularities. Baiano signed with fellow league side F.C. Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira in summer 2009, where his performances were eventually noted. He scored his first goal in the Portuguese top division on 19 September 2010, helping to a 2\u20132 home draw against S.C. Braga. In the 2011 off-season, Baiano joined Braga on a free transfer. He played 42 competitive games in the 2015\u201316 campaign, including the final of the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, won on penalties against FC Porto after a 2\u20132 draw in 120 minutes. On 2 September 2017, free agent Baiano signed for Spanish Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Rayo Vallecano. He totalled more than 3,000 minutes of action during his only season, helping them return to La Liga after two years. On 28 June 2018, Baiano joined Alanyaspor as a free agent. ==Honours== Braga *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 2015\u201316 *Ta\u00e7a da Liga: 2012\u201313 Rayo Vallecano *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C players Category:Vila Nova Futebol Clube players Category:Clube Recreativo e Atl\u00e9tico Catalano players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:C.F.
