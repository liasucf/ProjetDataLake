It is the fourth-highest peak in the Hayes Range, a subset of the Alaska Range. This remote peak is situated southeast of Mount Hayes, and southeast of Fairbanks. Mount Shand, the nearest higher neighbor, is set to the east. The first ascent of this unofficially named mountain was made in 1964 by Christopher Goetze, Lydia Goetze, Tom Knott, and Larry Muir. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Moby Dick is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Susitna and Tanana River drainage basins. ==See also== *List of the highest major summits of the United States (#154) *List of mountain peaks of Alaska (#34) *Geology of Alaska *Moby Dick (whale) ==References== ==External links== * Moby Dick: Flickr photo * Weather forecast: National Weather Service Mt.
