    "text": "Graph of Kampyle of Eudoxus with a = 1 The Kampyle of Eudoxus (Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 [\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ae], meaning simply \"curved [line], curve\") is a curve with a Cartesian equation of :x^4 = a^2(x^2+y^2), from which the solution x = y = 0 is excluded. ==Alternative parameterizations== In polar coordinates, the Kampyle has the equation :r = a\\sec^2\\theta. Equivalently, it has a parametric representation as :x=a\\sec(t), \\quad y=a\\tan(t)\\sec(t). ==History== This quartic curve was studied by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 408 BC \u2013 c.347 BC) in relation to the classical problem of doubling the cube. ==Properties== The Kampyle is symmetric about both the x- and y-axes. It crosses the x-axis at (\u00b1a,0). It has inflection points at :\\left(\\pm a\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2},\\pm a\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) (four inflections, one in each quadrant). The top half of the curve is asymptotic to x^2/a-a/2 as x \\to \\infty, and in fact can be written as :y = \\frac{x^2}{a}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^2}{x^2}} = \\frac{x^2}{a} - \\frac{a}{2} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty C_n\\left(\\frac{a}{2x}\\right)^{2n}, where :C_n = \\frac1{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n} is the nth Catalan number. ==See also== * List of curves ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Curves ",
