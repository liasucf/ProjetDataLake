Pathirana suffered permanent injuries to his left hand and arm. As of 2016 he serves as a staff sergeant in the Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment of the Sri Lanka Army. As well as his Paralympic success, Pathirana has also won medals at both IPC World Championship and Asian Para Games level. ==Athletics career== After watching soldiers with a disability undertaking various sports, Pathirana was asked by his superiors if he wanted to join. He eventually took up para- athletics in 2010 and that year he was classified as a T46 athlete and entered his first international competition, the 2010 Asian Para Games. In 2012 Pathirana represented Sri Lanka at the Paralympics in London. He entered two events, the 200 metres and 400 metres sprints.
