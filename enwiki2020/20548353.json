    "text": "Delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2 also known as ALAS2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ALAS2 gene. ALAS2 is an aminolevulinic acid synthase. The product of this gene specifies an erythroid-specific mitochondrially located enzyme. The encoded protein catalyzes the first step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Defects in this gene cause X-linked pyridoxine- responsive sideroblastic anemia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. Its gene contains an IRE in its 5'-UTR region on which an IRP binds if the iron level is too low, thus inhibiting its translation. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * *GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on X-Linked Sideroblastic Anemia and Ataxia ",
