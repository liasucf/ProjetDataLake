    "text": "' is a trans-Neptunian object first observed on 26 March 2014, at Cerro Tololo Observatory, La Serena. It is a possible dwarf planet, a member of the scattered disc, whose orbit extends into the inner Oort cloud. Discovered by Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo, the object's existence was revealed on 29 August 2016. Both the orbital period and aphelion distance of this object are poorly constrained. has the largest barycentric aphelion until 2018. However, the heliocentric aphelion of is second among trans-Neptunian objects (after the damocloid ). == Orbit == 2014 FE72 is seen at the top here in green, moving away from the Sun Its elongated orbit (eccentricity = 0.977) has a perihelion of 36.19 AU, an aphelion of ~3,060 AU and a barycentric orbital period of ~60,900 years. The latter values are the largest known for any Solar System body that is not a long-period comet. Based on the barycentric orbital period, takes roughly 5 times longer than Sedna to orbit the Sun. last passed through perihelion around late 1965. == See also == *List of Solar System objects by greatest aphelion *List of Solar System objects most distant from the Sun in 2015 ==Notes== == References == == External links == * * # # Category:Inner Oort cloud Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) # 20140326 ",
