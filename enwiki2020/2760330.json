    "text": "Hamish Rosser (born 16 May 1974) is an Australian rock musician. He is best known for his time in The Vines and his current position in Wolfmother ==Early life == Hamish\u2019s musical journey began when he took up the guitar at the age of eight. By the time he turned eleven he had switched to drums and bought his first set of drums with money saved up from a paper round in his Sydney neighbourhood. Rosser's first gig was with high school punk band called \"The Warthogs\" who covered The Clash, The Ramones and the Sex Pistols. Rosser studied chemical engineering at Sydney University and stayed there for four months until he left to pursue a career as a musician. ==Career== Rosser was asked to join The Vines to replace the band's previous drummer, David Oliffe. He left the Vines, along with guitarist Ryan Griffiths, in December 2011. Rosser started touring with Australian hard rock band Wolfmother in 2012, where the band were looking to start working on their third studio album. After a year of touring with the band, Wolfmother split up temporarily while frontman Andrew Stockdale worked on his solo album Keep Moving. Rosser performed drums and percussion on several tracks for the album. However, before embarking on a tour for the album, Stockdale reformed Wolfmother and prepared a tour under the band's name instead performing both Wolfmother and his solo tracks. Rosser left the band in 2013, then rejoined in 2017. ==Personal life== Rosser and his wife Kirsty have one child, Oscar Rosser, born in June 2012 in Queensland, Australia. In 2011, Rosser was living in Redfern, New South Wales. ===Skinny Blonde beer=== In 2008, Rosser launched a beer called Skinny Blonde along with winemaker Richie Harkham and artist Jarod Taylor. The beer won the Peoples Choice awards at the 2008 Australian Beer Festival held at the Rocks in Sydney. In June 2009, Skinny Blonde attracted national controversy across Australia over its beer bottle packaging which, through the use of modern ink technology, has a 1950s style pin up girl called 'Daisy' on the beer bottle label, slowly revealing herself as the beer level drops and the bottle temperature rises. This angered feminists who claimed the beer was \"another blatant example of the alcohol industry objectifying women to move product\". In response, Rosser stated, He was also quoted as saying that the beer was a \"bit of cheeky fun\". ==Discography== ;Studio albums ;with The Vines * Winning Days (2004) * Vision Valley (2006) * Melodia (2008) * Future Primitive (2011) ;with Andrew Stockdale *Keep Moving (2013) AUS #32 == References == Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rock drummers Category:Male drummers Category:The Vines (band) members Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:Australian brewers Category:21st-century drummers Category:21st-century male musicians Category:Wolfmother members ",
