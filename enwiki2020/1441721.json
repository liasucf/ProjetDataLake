    "text": "In paradisum, m. 413, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris Gabriel Faur\u00e9 composed his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral setting of the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Faur\u00e9's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but do not appear to have had anything to do with the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900. In seven movements, the work is scored for soprano and baritone soloists, mixed choir, orchestra and organ. Different from typical Requiem settings, the full sequence is omitted, replaced by its section . The final movement is based on a text that is not part of the liturgy of the funeral mass but of the burial. Faur\u00e9 wrote of the work, \"Everything I managed to entertain by way of religious illusion I put into my Requiem, which moreover is dominated from beginning to end by a very human feeling of faith in eternal rest.\"Steinberg, 132\u2013133. Quote's cited date is 1921. The piece premiered in its first version in 1888 in La Madeleine in Paris for a funeral mass. A performance takes about 35 minutes. ==History== Faur\u00e9's reasons for composing his Requiem are uncertain. One possible impetus may have been the death of his father in 1885, and his mother's death two years later, on New Year's Eve 1887. However, by the time of his mother's death he had already begun the work, about which he later declared, \"My Requiem wasn't written for anything \u2013 for pleasure, if I may call it that!\"Letter from Faur\u00e9 to the composer Maurice Emmanuel, quoted in Nectoux (1991), p. 116 (English translation by Roger Nichols). in the original French, Faur\u00e9's words were \"\" Some English versions translate \"\" as \"for fun\": see Steinberg, p. 135 The earliest composed music included in the Requiem is the Libera me, which Faur\u00e9 wrote in 1877 as an independent work.Duchen, p. 81 The organ by Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll in La Madeleine, Paris, where the first version of the Requiem was first performed In 1887\u201388, Faur\u00e9 composed the first version of the work, which he called \"\"Rutter, p. 3 with five movements ( and , , , and ), but did not include his . This version was first performed on 16 January 1888 for the funeral of Joseph Lesoufach\u00e9, an architect, at La Madeleine, Paris. The composer conducted his work; the treble soloist was Louis Aubert. In 1889, Faur\u00e9 added the portion of the Offertory and in 1890 he expanded the Offertory and added the 1877 . This second version was premiered on 21 January 1893, again at the Madeleine with Faur\u00e9 conducting. The church authorities allowed no female singers and insisted on boy treble and alto choristers and soloists; Faur\u00e9 composed the work with those voices in mind, and had to employ them for his performances at the Madeleine, but in the concert hall, unconstrained by ecclesiastical rules, he preferred female singers for the upper choral parts and the solo in the Pie Jesu.Nectoux (1991), p. 122 In 1899\u20131900, the score was reworked for full orchestra. This final version was premiered at the Trocad\u00e9ro in Paris on 12 July 1900, during the Exposition Universelle. Paul Taffanel conducted forces of 250 performers.Nectoux (1991), p. 514 The composer said of the work, \"Everything I managed to entertain by way of religious illusion I put into my Requiem, which moreover is dominated from beginning to end by a very human feeling of faith in eternal rest.\" He told an interviewer, In 1924 the Requiem, in its full orchestral version, was performed at Faur\u00e9's own funeral. It was not performed in the United States until 1931, at a student concert at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. It was first performed in England in 1936.Steinberg, p. 135 == Text == Most of the text is in Latin, except for the Kyrie which is Koine Greek. As had become customary, Faur\u00e9 did not set the Gradual and Tract sections of the Mass. He followed a French Baroque tradition by not setting the Requiem sequence (the ), only its section . He slightly altered the texts of the Introit, the Kyrie, Pie Jesu, , and , but substantially changed the text of the Offertory (described below). He did not set the (the conclusion of the ), and added two texts from the Order of Burial, and In Paradisum.Nectoux, pp. 117\u2013120 Faur\u00e9 made changes to the text of the Offertory; at the beginning, he adds an \"O\". He changed \"\" (\"deliver the souls of all the faithful departed\") to simply \"\" (\"deliver the souls of the departed\"). He replaced \"\" (\"Deliver them\") at the beginning of the next verse with a repetition of \"\", and he omitted the third verse (beginning \"\"). He concludes with an added \"Amen\".Park, 192\u2013195. == Structure and scoring == The composition is structured in seven movements: The piece has a duration of about 35 minutes. Faur\u00e9 scored the work for two soloists, chorus and orchestra. Its movements and their sections are listed in a table for the scoring in voices, key, time signature (using the symbol for common time, equivalent to ) and tempo marking. The voices are abbreviated, S for soprano, A for alto, T for tenor, B for bass. The composer divides the choir into as many as six parts, SATTBB, but frequently uses unison of one part or several. Given the liturgical nature of the work, boy trebles are often used instead of sopranos. === Details === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! No. !! Title !! Solo !! Choir !! Key !! Time !! Tempo !! Notes !!

Both works have seven movements, both employ a baritone and a soprano soloist, the baritone singing with the choir in movements 2 and 6, the soprano in a central movement, movement 4 in Faur\u00e9, movement 5 in Brahms where she appears with the choir. In both works, the four remaining movements are sung by the choir alone, whereas Verdi, for example, has the soloists sing several arias and ensembles in his Requiem. === Intro\u00eft et Kyrie === Intro\u00eft and Kyrie bars 4\u20137 of the Introit and Kyrie Similar to Mozart's Requiem, the work begins slowly in D minor. After one measure of just D in the instruments, the choir enters in six parts on the D minor chord and stays on it in homophony for the entire text \"\" (eternal rest). In gradual progression of harmony and a sudden , a first climax is reached on \"\" (and lasting light), diminishing on a repeated \"\" (may shine for them). The tenors repeat the prayer alone for eternal rest on a simple melody. The sopranos continue similarly that praise is due in Jerusalem, then all voices exclaim \"\" (hear). The Kyrie begins with the same melody that the tenor sang before, but now in unison of soprano, alto and tenor, repeated in the following four measures in four-part harmony. The call \"Christe\" is strong and urgent the first time, repeated more softly a few more times. The final call \"\" appears pianissimo. === Offertoire === Offertoire The Offertoire begins in B minor with a canon of alto and tenor in short succession on a simple modal melody with little ambitus, in a prayer \"\" (O Lord, Jesus Christ, King of Glory) to free the souls of the departed from eternal punishment and the deep lake, ending in unison. The sequence is repeated beginning one step higher for the next line, and again one step higher for the following more urgent call to Jesus, enforced by the basses. The voices add only softly, broken by rests, what the prayer is about: \"\" (that they may not fall into the darkness). The baritone enters with \"\", offerings brought with praises, beginning on one repeated note, but asking with more melody \"\" (make them, Lord, transcend from death to life). The choir repeats the first line of the text on the same motif as in the beginning, but in more elaborate polyphony in four parts, concluded by an uplifting Amen in B major. === Sanctus === Sanctus (Holy), in contrast with other compositions of mass and Requiem where it is often illustrated with great vocal and instrumental forces (particularly Verdi's Requiem), is here expressed in extremely simple form. The sopranos sing softly in a very simple rising and falling melody of only three notes, which the male voices repeat, accompanied by arpeggios on the harp and a dreamy rising melody in the violins (sometimes just a solo violin). The pattern appears several times, with the melodies increasing in ambitus, and the volume reaching forte on \"\" (the highest). The orchestra changes tone, the dreamy accompaniment is replaced by firm and powerful major chords with a horn fanfare marked forte, and the male voices declare \"\" (praise in the highest). This is answered by the sopranos in diminuendo, and the music softens and reverts to the dreamy harp arpeggios that it began with as the violin melody floats upwards to the final note in E flat major and the full choir repeats,with the altos finally joining: \"\". === Pie Jesu === Pie Jesu The solo soprano (or treble) sings the prayer to the \"good Jesus\" for everlasting rest. The one line of text is repeated three times, the first two times asking for \"requiem\" (rest), then intensified for \"sempiternam requiem\" (everlasting rest). The first call is a modal melody in B-flat major of six measures, the second call is similar but reaching up higher. The words \"\" begin with more expansion, but reach alternating between only two notes on two repetitions of \"\". The last call begins as the first and leads again to alternating between two notes in even lower range, until the last \"requiem\" has a gentle upward motion. === Agnus Dei === Agnus Dei \"Agnus Dei\", in many settings of Mass and Requiem set with dark expression, begins in F major with a fluent expansive melody in the orchestra. After six measures, the tenors sing a melody to it that gently rises and falls, and repeats it almost the same way. Then, while the motion in the orchestra stays the same, the key changes to the minor mode, and the Lamb of God is asked for rest in chords of daring harmonic progression. Then the tenors, without instrumental introduction, repeat the first line, leading to a peaceful \"\". The sopranos alone begins the following section \"\" (Light eternal shine for them) with a long \"\", then the choir, divided in six parts, lets that light shimmer. The choir closes with a reprise of the Introit, the opening of the mass (\"Requiem aeternam\"), before the orchestra picks up the \"\" melody to close the movement. === Libera me === Libera me The baritone soloist sings the first section alone. On a bass in an ostinato rhythm of two quarter notes, a rest and the upbeat to the next two quarters, he sings the text \"\" (Free me, Lord, from eternal death on that terrible day when the heavens will move and the earth, when you come to judge the world with fire.), embarking on a melody of wide range, with some sharp leaps. The text is continued by the choir in four parts in homophony: \"\" (I am trembling). In more motion, \"\" (day of wrath) is expressed by fortissimo chords, giving way to the prayer for rest in the same motion, but piano, with a crescendo on \"\", but suddenly softening on a last \"\". Then the choir repeats the opening statement of the baritone fully in unison. Soloist, then choir, end the movement softly, repeating \"\". === In Paradisum === In paradisum The text of the last movement is taken from the Order of Burial. \"\" (May angels lead you to paradise) rests on a continuous shimmering motion in fast broken triads in the orchestra. The sopranos sing a rising expressive melody, enriched by chords of the other voices, divided in six parts, on the final \"Jerusalem\". A second thought is again sung by the sopranos, filled on the last words by the others: . == Versions == Faur\u00e9 revised and enlarged the Requiem in the years between its first performance in 1888 and the publication of the final version in 1901. The latter is scored for full orchestra; since the 1970s attempts have been made by several Faur\u00e9 scholars to reconstruct the composer's earlier versions, scored for smaller orchestral forces. === First version === Five of the seven sections of the Requiem were completed by January 1888 and performed that month at the Madeleine for the funeral of the architect Joseph Lesoufach\u00e9.Nectoux (1991), p. 116 This version lacked the and , which Faur\u00e9 added at some time in the following decade.Nectoux (1991), p. 117 The predates the rest of the Requiem, having been composed eleven years earlier as a baritone solo. The forces required for the original 1888 version were a choir about forty in number consisting of boys and men (the Madeleine did not admit female choristers), solo boy treble, harp, timpani, organ, strings (solo violin, divided violas, divided cellos and basses). For a performance at the Madeleine in May 1888 Faur\u00e9 added horn and trumpet parts.Shrock p. 431 ===1893 version === Faur\u00e9 continued to work intermittently on the Requiem, and by 1893 he judged the score ready to be published (although the proposed publication fell through). Several attempts have been made to reconstruct the score as it was in 1893. The Faur\u00e9 specialist Jean-Michel Nectoux began working on it in the 1970s,Langham Smith. Richard, \"Review \u2013 Requiem (1893 Version) by Gabriel Faur\u00e9, ed John Rutter\", Music & Letters, Vol. 71, No. 1 (February 1990), pp. 143\u2013144 but the first edition to be published was by the English conductor John Rutter in 1989. Nectoux's edition, jointly edited with Roger Delage, was published in 1994. They had the advantage of access to important source material unavailable to Rutter: a set of orchestral parts discovered in 1968 in the Madeleine and a score made in the 1890s by a bass in the Madeleine choir and annotated by Faur\u00e9. Music and Letters judged the Rutter edition, \"makeshift and lacking in the standards of scholarship one expects from a university press\". The Musical Times considered the Nectoux and Delage edition \"invaluable\".Thomson, Andrew. \"Review \u2013 Faur\u00e9's Requiem (1893 Version) ed Jean-Michel Nectoux; Roger Delage\", The Musical Times, Vol. 136, No. 1834 (December 1995), pp. 670\u2013671 Faur\u00e9's own manuscript survives but, as the critic Andrew Thomson puts it, \"the waters were muddied by his overwritings on the original MSS, adding two bassoons and two more horns and trumpets, together with modifications of the cello and bass parts.\" Reviewing the Nectoux and Delage edition, Thomson wrote of \"several pleasant surprises [including] the restoration of the urgent timpani rolls underlining 'Christe eleison', and the ethereal harp chords which so enhance the spiritual atmosphere of 'Lux aeterna'\". For the 1893 version a baritone solo, two bassoons, four horns and two trumpets are added to the original scoring. When possible Faur\u00e9 employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist, partly because the soprano lines, particularly the solo in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.Duchen, p. 83 ===Final version=== At the end of the 1890s Faur\u00e9's publisher, Julien Hamelle, suggested that the composer should rescore the Requiem for performance in concert halls. The intimate sound of the earlier versions was effective in liturgical performances, but for the large concert venues, and large choral societies of the time, a larger orchestra was required. The autograph of the resulting 1900 version does not survive, and critics have speculated whether Faur\u00e9, who was not greatly interested in orchestration, delegated some or all of the revision to one of his pupils. Many details of the augmented score differ from Faur\u00e9's own earlier amendments to the original 1888 manuscript. The new score was published in 1901 at the same time as a vocal score edited by one of Faur\u00e9's favourite pupils, Jean Roger-Ducasse,Thomson; and Duchen, p. 125 and some critics have speculated that he reorchestrated the full score at Faur\u00e9's instigation.Ford pp. 299\u2013302 Others have questioned whether so skilled an orchestrator as Roger-Ducasse would have \"perpetrated such pointlessly inconspicuous doublings\", or left uncorrected the many misprints in the 1901 edition. Alan Blyth speculates that the work may have been done by someone in Hamelle's firm.Blyth, p. 217 The misprints have been corrected in later editions, notably those by Roger Fiske and Paul Inwood (1978) and Nectoux (2001).Gilbert, David. \"Review of Requiem, Op. 48, pour soli, choeur et orchestre symphonique. Version de concert, 1900 by Gabriel Faur\u00e9, ed Jean-Michel Nectoux\", Notes, Second Series, Vol. 57, No. 4 (June 2001), pp. 1018\u20131020 The orchestration of the final version comprises mixed choir, solo soprano, solo baritone, two flutes, two clarinets (only in the ), two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets (only in the Kyrie and ), three trombones, timpani (only in the ), harp, organ, strings (with only a single section of violins, but divided violas and cellos, as before). Nectoux has expressed the view that what he terms the \"church\" (1893) and the \"concert\" (1900\u20131901) versions of the Requiem should both be performed, the choice of edition being dictated by the size of the venue. It is not clear whether the composer favoured either version over the other. Blyth comments \"All of his comments about the Requiem ring truer as descriptions of the 1888 and 1894 [sic] versions than of the published text of 1901\". Faur\u00e9, however, complained in 1921 that the orchestra at a performance of the work had been too small,Jones, p. 193 and commented to Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe on the \"angelic\" violins during the in the full orchestral version.Nectoux (1991), p. 119 == Selected editions == * Faur\u00e9: Messe de requiem, Op. 48, ed.

Those singled out for particular mention by critics are listed below. The Requiem is often combined in recordings and concert performances with Faur\u00e9's early Cantique de Jean Racine, an award-winning composition originally for choir and organ which the composer wrote aged 19 in his last year of ten years at the school of church music \u00c9cole Niedermeyer de Paris.Nectoux (1991), p. 255 === 1888 version reconstruction === * Lisa Beckley; Nicholas Gedge; Schola Cantorum of Oxford; Oxford Camerata Instrumental Ensemble; Jeremy Summerly (1994). === 1893 version === * Caroline Ashton; Stephen Varcoe; Cambridge Singers; City of London Sinfonia; John Rutter (1984).
