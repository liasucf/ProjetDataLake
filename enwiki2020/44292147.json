Mesa is a city in Maricopa County located east of Phoenix. Mesa is the third largest city in Arizona, after Phoenix and Tucson. ==Brief history== The early Mormon pioneers founded a settlement which they named Utahville. They shortly renamed their settlement Lehi. They rebuilt the ancient canals that the Hohokam tribe had once built and the area became successful as an agricultural haven. However, on March 5, 1877, the pioneers built a Fort with adobe bricks which they named \"Fort Utah\" to protect their families and fields from the Apaches who often attacked them. In 1886, the town Post Office name was changed to Zenos. In 1889, the Post Office Department finally allowed the name Mesa City. There was a flood in Lehi in 1891, which destroyed Fort Utah and carried away acres of valuable farmland in low-lying areas.History of Mesa There are numerous properties in Mesa which are historical and which have either been listed in the National Register of Historic Places or in the list of the Mesa Historic Properties.
