    "text": "Housedon Hill is a hill on the northwestern edge of the Cheviot Hills in Northumberland, England. It is the northernmost Marilyn in England, the summit lying only about 4 miles (7 km) from the Scottish border, which runs to the north and west. The hill lies just outside the boundary of the Northumberland National Park. Until recently there was no legal right of access to the hill. This has now changed, as the western side of the hill up to the summit is designated \u2018access land\u2019 under the terms of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The simplest route of ascent starts from Housedonhaugh on the southwest flank of the hill, utilising the new access rights. The northwestern side of the Housedon Hill is cloaked in forestry plantations. Category:Cheviot Hills Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hills of Northumberland Category:Volcanism of England ",
