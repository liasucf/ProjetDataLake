    "text": "Mark Cagaanan Aguhar (May 16, 1987 \u2013 March 12, 2012) was an American activist, writer and multimedia fine artist known for her multidisciplinary work about gender, beauty and existing as a racial minority, while being body positive and transgender femme-identified. Aguhar was made famous by her Tumblr blog that questioned the mainstream representation of the \"glossy glorification of the gay white male body\". == Life == Aguhar was born May 16, 1987 in Houston, Texas in a Filipino American family. She attended the University of Texas at Austin. Aguhar's works include performance-based pieces, watercolors, collages, and photography. Often the work was of self-portraits with hair extensions, make-up, gender-specific clothing and a beautiful, unashamed portrait of herself, curves and all and reminds the viewer that Aguhar's life and mere existence was an act of confronting white hegemony. Aguhar maintained an online presence on Tumblr, which hosted both her professional and personal websites. As Tumblr user \"calloutqueen,\" she titled her blog \"BLOGGING FOR BROWN GURLS,\" posting her thoughts about sexuality, sex, dating, gender, and her work. Aguhar was only a few months away from earning her MFA degree from University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) when she died by suicide in Chicago, Illinois, on March 12, 2012. == Legacy == Since 2012, there is a \"Mark Aguhar Memorial Grant\" available through Chances Dances for queer artists of color. In 2013, artist Edie Fake had the exhibition titled, \"Memory Palaces\" in Chicago and paid tribute to five artists and friends that had died, one of which was Mark Aguhar. The 2015\u20132016 exhibition, Bring Your Own Body: Transgender between archives and aesthetics, started the tour at Cooper Union and was created in order to explore the meaning of trans and what defines transgender aesthetic in many different forms of artwork. Other transgender artists and archieves participating in this exhibition included: Niv Acosta, Math Bass, Effy Beth, Justin Vivian Bond, Pauline Boudry / Renate Lorenz, Vaginal Davis, Zackary Drucker, Chloe Dzubilo, Reina Gossett with Sasha Wortzel, Juliana Huxtable, Greer Lankton, Pierre Molinier, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, Flawless Sabrina, Buzz Slutzky, and Chris Vargas with the Museum of Transgender Hirstory and Art. Her poem \"Litanies to My Heavenly Brown Body\" was widely circulated after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. In the publication \"Proximity: On the Work of Mark Aguhar,\" (2015), writer Roy P\u00e9rez examines Aguhar's drawings, videos, live acts, and writings as performances of closeness, and as critiques of racism, transphobia, and fat phobia. P\u00e9rez highlights the complexity of Aguhar's queerness and \"not wanting to form attachments within the dominant normative society\". == Select exhibitions == * 2009: No Lone Zone, Creative Research Lab, Austin, Texas * 2009: New American Talent, The Twenty-fourth Exhibition, Arthouse at the Jones Center, Contemporary Art for Texas, Austin, Texas * 2010: Ideas of Mountains, Creative Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas * 2011: M4M, Lawndale Art Center, Houston, Texas * 2012: Torch Song, Gallery 400, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Chicago, Illinois * 2012: The Dragon is the Frame Performances, Gallery 400, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Chicago, Illinois *2015: Bring Your Own Body: Transgender between archives and aesthetics, 41 Cooper Gallery, The Cooper Union, New York City, New York * 2016: Bring Your Own Body: Transgender between archives and aesthetics, Glass Curtain Gallery, Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois *2016: Bring Your Own Body: Transgender between archives and aesthetics, Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery, Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania *2019: \"Nobody Promised You Tomorrow\": Art 50 Years After Stonewall, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, New York == References == ==External links== * Mark Aguhar's portfolio on Tumblr * In memoriam: Mark Aguhar, 1987\u20132012 in TimeOut Chicago * Mark Aguhar, 1987\u20132012 Obituary in The Awl * Essay on Hyperallergic * Mark Aguhar's Critical Flippancy on Bully Bloggers Category:Artists from Houston Category:University of Texas at Austin College of Fine Arts alumni Category:University of Illinois at Chicago alumni Category:Transgender and transsexual artists Category:LGBT artists from the United States Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Internet celebrities Category:1987 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Activists from Houston Category:Queer artists Category:Gay artists Category:American artists of Filipino descent ",
