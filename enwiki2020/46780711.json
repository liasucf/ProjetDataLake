Within Filintern, they could: * collect stamps and paper money, * publish philatelic bulletins, journals and catalogues, * most importantly, conduct foreign exchange. Using philately, scripophily and Esperanto, the Soviet authorities also hoped for promoting communist propaganda among the foreign proletariat.
