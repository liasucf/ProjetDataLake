    "text": "Pandanus microcarpus is a species of plant in the family Pandanaceae, endemic to Mauritius. ==Description== This small (5-6m), slender, freely branching tree can be distinguished from its closest relatives by its drooping, dark yellow-green leaves with red marginal spines. It can also easily be distinguished by its small (7\u20139 cm), oval, red to purple fruit-head, which is born on a twisted, recurved stalk. Each fruit-head is packed with 75-200 2.5 cm-long drupes. The exposed top of each drupe is flat or slightly convex (not forming a domed or pyramid shape). Unusually for its genus, it sometimes bears staminodes. ==Habitat== It is endemic to Mauritius, where it was once widespread. Its habitat is now largely destroyed. Its natural habitats are rivers and swamps in medium-rainfall areas of Mauritius. ==References== microcarpus Category:Endemic flora of Mauritius Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour ",
