It tells of the battles and events during the war between the coalition of Medes and Babylonians against the Assyrians. ==Plot== The main heroes are Sardanapalus, King of Nineveh and of all the Assyrian empire; Arbaces, the prince of Medes; and a Babylonian priest, Belesis. Sardanapalus is portrayed as a womanizer, coward, and cruel tyrant. When defeated by Arbaces he burns his own palace with all his concubines inside and dies in the fire. All Nineveh is destroyed. ==Excerpt== The poem can be interpreted as praise of modern democracy. It begins: Of Nineveh the mighty city of old, The queen of all the nations,\u2014at her throne Kings worshipp'd, and from her their subject crowns, Humbly obedient, held, and on her state Submiss attended, nor such servitude Opprobrious named\u2014from that high eminence How, like a star, she fell, and passed away,\u2014 Such the high matter of my song shall be.Book the First, lines 1-8, in . ==Notes== ==References== * The Fall of Nineveh.
