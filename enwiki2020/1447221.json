    "text": "Nenad Bjelica (; born 20 August 1971) is a Croatian professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Croatian First Football League club Osijek. ==Club career== Born in Osijek, Bjelica started playing for a small club, Metalac Olt, in the 1989\u201390 season. He quickly moved to NK Osijek and spent almost four seasons there, before moving abroad to Spain. Bjelica played for Albacete Balompi\u00e9 for four years, during which the team reached the Copa del Rey semi-final in the 1994\u201395 season. In 1996 he moved to Real Betis and was in the team that was the runner-up in the 1996\u201397 campaign. The next season, Bjelica spent at UD Las Palmas, but returned to Real Betis a year later. Due to injuries, he played very few games in this period, and would again spend a season at Las Palmas until the end of 1999. Bjelica then returned home to Osijek for two seasons and recovered his form, playing with the team in three stages of the UEFA Cup. He then moved to 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 2000, where he spent four seasons until semi-retiring top- tier football in 2004. During the 2004\u201305 season, Bjelica played for VfB Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling. After that, he played for the Austrian club FC K\u00e4rnten in the Austrian Football First League before retiring on 30 June 2008. ==International career== Bjelica represented Croatia nine times from 2001 until 2004. He was part of the UEFA Euro 2004 squad, but retired from the team in that year, at the same time the manager Otto Bari\u0107 was replaced. ==Managerial career== Bjelica with Austria Wien in October 2013. Bjelica began his coaching career on 15 September 2007 at FC K\u00e4rnten, as player-caretaker manager. On 1 July 2008, he signed a full managing contract, just a day after ending his playing career. Bjelica was the head coach of Lustenau 07 from March to December 2009, as well as WAC St. Andr\u00e4 from May 2010 to June 2013. Bjelica moved to Austria Wien on 17 June 2013 as their new head coach, and qualified for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League group stage, defeating the Croatian champion Dinamo Zagreb in the last round of qualification, with the club. Bjelica was sacked on 16 February 2014. As Austria Wien failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League nonetheless at the end of the season, his contract expired. In June 2014, he was hired by Serie B side Spezia. On 30 August 2016, he was appointed new head coach of Polish side Lech Pozna\u0144. On 10 May 2018, he was released from his contract at Lech. On 15 May 2018, Bjelica signed a two-year contract with the Croatian champion Dinamo Zagreb, being appointed as their head coach. Four days later, he celebrated winning the Croatian First League championship, while on 23 May, he won the Croatian Cup. On 8 November, beating Spartak Trnava, Dinamo managed to qualify for the Europa League knockout phase. On 18 September 2019, Bjelica led Dinamo in the club's inaugural match in the UEFA Champions League campaign after two seasons, with a 4\u20130 home win against Atalanta. On 16 April 2020, following the sacking of the entire coaching staff by the club, it was announced Dinamo terminated the contract with Bjelica. In September 2020, after failing to win three opening games of their season, Croatian club Osijek sacked their head coach Ivica Kule\u0161evi\u0107 and appointed Bjelica instead. ==Personal life== Bjelica is of paternal Montenegrin and maternal Croatian origin. In 1997 he married his wife, Senka.
