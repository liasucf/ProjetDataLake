He teamed with Dick Joyce, Wybo Veldman, John Hunter, Lindsay Wilson, Joe Earl, Trevor Coker and Tony Hurt and Simon Dickie (cox) to win the gold medal in the coxed eight. Robertson is one of only two New Zealand Olympic gold medallists who never won a national premier title. Robertson is the nephew of famed New Zealand rowing coach Rusty Robertson. His daughter, who is also a rower, married Olympic champion rower Eric Murray. The Robertsons lived in Australia for a while but returned to live in Cambridge, New Zealand when their daughter was pregnant. Gary Robertson later worked as a full-time rowing coach in Christchurch. He now coaches at Waikato Diocesean School for Girls, previously Sydney Rowing Club. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of New Zealand Category:Olympic gold medalists for New Zealand in rowing Category:Rowers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Oamaru Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:World Rowing Championships medalists for New Zealand Category:European Rowing Championships medalists ",
