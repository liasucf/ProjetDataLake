The scheme makes use of the large height difference created by Radyr Weir to push water through two , Archimedean screw turbines. The scheme was constructed in 2015 by Dawnus Construction, being designed by Renewables First and operated by Cardiff Council. Cardiff Council built the scheme to supply renewable electricity to three of the city's leisure centres, lowering their carbon emissions in order to help Cardiff become a \"one planet city\" by 2050. == References == Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Wales ",
