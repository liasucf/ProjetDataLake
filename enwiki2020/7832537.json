He began the year with Tampa Bay and also played with the Cubs, in addition to Texas and Toronto. The last to do so was Dave Kingman (1977). Before him, according to historian Scott Flatow, the four-in-one players were Frank Huelsman (1904), Willis Hudlin (1940), Paul Lehner (1951), Ted Gray (1955), Wes Covington (1961) and Mike Kilkenny (1972). *August 8 \u2013 Trailing 3\u20132 entering the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees hit back-to-back home runs on back-to-back pitches from Oakland closer Jason Isringhausen. Bernie Williams jumped on the first pitch and sent it over the right field fence to tie the game, then David Justice sent the very next offering from Isringhausen over the center field wall to give the Yankees the win. *August 19 \u2013 The Yankees beat the Angels 9\u20131, hitting a major league record-tying three sacrifice flies in the 3rd inning. *August 19 \u2013 In the Houston Astros' 10\u20138 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, Jeff Bagwell has two home runs and five RBI.

Snead has a batting average of .242 and a .338 on-base percentage. It's the 10th time in the last 20 years that a minor-leaguer has stolen 100 or more bases in a season. According to Howe Sports data, the eight players who stole 100 or more bases in the minors were: **Vince Coleman (Macon, South Atlantic, 1983\u2014145) **Donell Nixon (Bakersfield, California, 1983\u2014144) **Jeff Stone (Spartanburg, South Atlantic, 1983\u2014123) **Alan Wiggins (Lodi, California, 1980\u2014120) **Marcus Lawton (Columbia, South Atlantic, 1985\u2014111) **Esix Snead (Potomac, Carolina, 2000\u2014106) **Lenny Dykstra (Lynchburg, Carolina, 1983\u2014105) **Donell Nixon (Chattanooga, Southern, 1984\u2014102) **Vince Coleman (Louisville, American Association, 1983\u2014 101) **Albert Hall (Durham, Carolina, 1980\u2014100) *August 22 \u2013 The Dodgers defeat the Expos 14\u20136, as Eric Karros becomes the first Dodger player to hit two home runs in a single inning (6th). *August 27 \u2013 The Anaheim Angels edge the Cleveland Indians 10\u20139, as outfielder Tim Salmon hits his 30th home run of the year in the 5th inning. Anaheim become the first team in AL history to have four players (Troy Glaus, Mo Vaughn, Garret Anderson, Salmon) reach the 30-homer mark in a single season. The Toronto Blue Jays are close with two hitters over 30 and two at 28. It's been done seven times in the NL. ===September=== *September 1 \u2013 For the second time in the season, pitcher Ryan Rupe of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays gives up a grand slam to Kansas City Royals outfielder Jermaine Dye. The other slam was on April 26. *September 3 \u2013 Kenny Lofton of the Cleveland Indians ties a major league record by scoring in his 18th straight game in the first inning of the Cleveland Indians' 12\u201311, 13-inning victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Red Rolfe set the record in 1939 for the New York Yankees. *September 4 \u2013 At Fenway Park, Carl Everett of the Boston Red Sox becomes only the sixth major-league switch-hitter to drive in 100 runs in both leagues when he knocks in his 100th RBI of the year. Boston wins over the Seattle Mariners, 5\u20131. Everett drove in 108 runs for the Houston Astros in 1999. The other five 100\u2013100 switch-hitters were Ted Simmons, Ken Singleton, Eddie Murray, Bobby Bonilla and J. T. Snow. Before the game, the Red Sox honor Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk. Fisk, who played his first nine seasons with Boston, joins Bobby Doerr (1), Joe Cronin (4), Carl Yastrzemski (8) and Ted Williams (9) in having his number (27) be retired at Fenway. *September 6 \u2013 Scott Sheldon of the Texas Rangers becomes just the third player in major league history to play all nine positions in one game when he does it in a 13\u20131 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Sheldon joins Bert Campaneris (September 8, 1965) and C\u00e9sar Tovar (September 22, 1968) as true utility players. *September 6 \u2013 After reaching an agreement with Morgan, Lewis and Bockis LLP, Major League Baseball can now use the URL http://www.mlb.com. The law firm registered the domain name in 1994 and refused to release it, making it necessary for the league to use http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com. *September 10 \u2013 Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks becomes the 12th pitcher to reach the 3,000-strikeout plateau, fanning a season-high 14 in seven innings as the Diamondbacks lose to the Florida Marlins 4\u20133 in 12 innings. Johnson's 3,000 strikeout victim is Mike Lowell, who fans to end the 4th inning. In the first inning, Johnson also records his 300th strikeout for the third consecutive season and the fourth time overall. Nolan Ryan is the only other pitcher to accomplish the feat, and is the only pitcher who has reached 300 strikeouts more times with six (1972\u201374, 1976\u201377 and 1989). *September 12 \u2013 The Diamondbacks edge the Dodgers 5\u20134, despite Dave Hansen's major league record- breaking seventh pinch-hit home run of the season.

Henderson moves into second place on the all-time list of runs (2,175), one ahead of Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron. *September 16 \u2013 The St. Louis Cardinals defeat the Chicago Cubs 7\u20136, despite Sammy Sosa's 50th home run of the season.

He is the first major leaguer to reach the mark as a pinch-hitter. *September 22 \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Lima of the Houston Astros sets an NL single-season record by allowing his 47th home run in the Astros' 12\u20135 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. The major league record for home runs allowed in a season is 50, set by the Minnesota Twins' Bert Blyleven in 1986. *September 26 \u2013 Longtime broadcast partner NBC declines to renew its rights. NBC had televised baseball since 1947, with the exception of 1990\u201393, and had been the exclusive home of the World Series for 26 years. *September 27 \u2013 In an Oakland 9\u20137 victory over the Angels, Anaheim's Darin Erstad hits a home run in the 2nd inning for his 99th RBI of the year from the leadoff spot to set a new record. Nomar Garciaparra drove home 98 in 1997 for the previous mark. SEASON NOTE \u2013 This was the first time in MLB history that no team finished with a winning percentage either below .400 or above .600. It is also the first time, in a full 162-game season, that no team achieved 100 wins or 100 losses. ===October\u2013December=== *October 8 \u2013 Bobby Jones of the New York Mets one-hits the San Francisco Giants in Game Four of the NLDS to advance the Mets to the NLCS. *October 26 \u2013 The New York Yankees defeat the New York Mets 4\u20132, to win their 26th World Series, 4-games to 1.
