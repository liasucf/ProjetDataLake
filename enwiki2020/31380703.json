    "text": "James Roy Ozanne (June 30, 1882 \u2013 January 11, 1963) was an All-American basketball player at the University of Chicago in 1904\u201305. He was part of the first group of college basketball players to be honored as such. The Helms Athletic Foundation, which began in 1936, retroactively named the All-American teams from 1905 to 1935. Between 1905 and 1929, the Helms All-American teams are considered to be consensus selections. ==References== # # # Category:1882 births Category:1963 deaths Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Illinois Category:Chicago Maroons men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players ",
