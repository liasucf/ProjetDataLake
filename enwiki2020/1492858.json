The Armenian name of the district is Karvachar (), which corresponds to the ancient district of Vaykunik, one of 12 cantons of Artsakh (historical Nagorno-Karabakh).Robert H. Hewsen, Armenia: A Historical Atlas. The University of Chicago Press, 2001, pp. 40, 101-102, 264-265. It was also known as Upper-Khachen or Tsar (after its chief town) and was ruled by one of the branches of the House of Khachen, who held it until the Russian conquest of the Karabakh region in the early 19th century. However, Kalbajar was deliberately excluded from the Nagorno- Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in 1923. As a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the area was occupied by Armenian forces on April 3, 1993. == Cultural monuments == Karvachar is rich in important Armenian cultural monuments, close to 750, which include monasteries, churches, chapels, fortresses, khachkars and inscriptions. The most important of them is the monastery of Dadivank. ==Under Armenian control== The district was made into the Shahumyan Region, one of the 8 regions of NKR. The region remains the least populated of the NKR regions with a total population of 2,800. The town of Karvachar is home to 500 people.Armeniapedia, Karvachar == See also == *Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh *Battle of Kalbajar ==References== Category:Districts of Azerbaijan Category:Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh ",
