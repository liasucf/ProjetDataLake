    "text": "Sivappu Nila is a 1998 Tamil action thriller film directed and produced by J. George Prasad, who had previously directed the film Killadi Mappillai (1994). The film features Raja and Vineetha in lead roles, with Vinu Chakravarthy, Venniradai Moorthy, Vadivelu, Delhi Ganesh, Chinni Jayanth and Alex playing supporting roles. The film had musical score by Deva and was released on 25 December 1998. ==Plot== Raja (Raja) is a CID inspector of police who is charged to solve the murder of the smuggler Durai (Banerjee). The only clue he would have is that the killer rode a white horse, wore a monster mask and a black coat. In the meantime, Raja falls in love with the soft-spoken college student Raani (Vineetha). He then meets the tomboy Jhansi fighting with some goons who looks exactly like Raani and she lies to him that she is Raani's twin sister. The same killer murders the smuggler Maruthu (Alex). Raja eventually finds the killer who turns out to be Raani (who is also Jhansi) and Raani tells him her bitter past. In the past, Ramachandran (Delhi Ganesh) was an ex-police officer who lived happily with his two daughters: Lakshmi (Vahini) and Raani. Lakshmi then found a job as a school teacher in the village Ammalur but Ramachandran didn't want her to go there. A few years ago, Ramachandran clashed with the smuggler Manikkam who severely injured his leg. In spite of his guidance, Lakshmi went to Ammalur alone. Manikkam and his associates Maruthu and Durai spread terror among the villagers. One day, Lakshmi clashes with Manikkam and slapped him. The vengeful Manikkam, Maruthu and Durai then raped Lakshmi in her school in broad daylight. Lakshmi, Raani and Ramachandran lodged a complaint against the rapists but the court discharged them. Lakshmi immediately committed suicide in the court. Raani and Ramachandran decided to take revenge on the rapists. Raja advises her to stop it and to surrender to the police but Raani has to satisfy her thirst for revenge. She finally kills Manikkam in Ammalur and Raja arrests her. The court then acquitted her due to the lack of evidence. ==Cast== *Raja as Raja *Vineetha as Raani/Jhansi *Vinu Chakravarthy as Manikkam *Venniradai Moorthy as 'Don't Care' Moorthy *Vadivelu as Thirteen Seventy-Four *Delhi Ganesh as Ramachandran *Chinni Jayanth as Thangappan *Alex as Maruthu *Banerjee as Durai *Loose Mohan as Veerappan *Omakuchi Narasimhan *C.
