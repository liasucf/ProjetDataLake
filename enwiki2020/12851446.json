    "text": "Chenanisuchus (\"Chenane crocodile\") is a genus of dyrosaurid crocodyliform from the Late Cretaceous of Mali and the Late Palaeocene of Sidi Chenane in Morocco. It was described in 2005, after expeditions uncovered it in 2000. The type species is C. lateroculi (\"lateralis\", lateral; \"oculi\", eyes), in reference to the laterally facing eyes. Currently, Chenanisuchus is the most basal known dyrosaurid. == Material == Two specimens of C. lateroculi \u2013 OCP DEK-GE 262 (holotype, nearly complete skull with mandibular fragments) and OCP DEK-GE 61 (nearly complete skull) \u2013 come from the Sidi Chenane area in Morocco, which is Late Palaeocene (Thanetian) in age.Jouve et al., 2005. Fossils of Chenanisuchus were also found in Maastrichtian age strata in Mali, showing that Chenanisuchus survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. == Systematics == Chenanisuchus lateroculi is referred to Dyrosauridae by Jouve et al. (2005), based on three morphological characters: * Presence of occipital tuberosities * Presence of an anterolateral postorbital process * Large participation of the quadratojugal and surangular to the jaw joint == Palaeobiology == Chenanisuchus lateroculi has an estimated adult length between 4 and 4.5 meters, based on the 60 centimeter long skull. It has the shortest snout relative to the dorsal skull length among all dyrosaurids. == References == === Bibliography === * Jouve, S., Bouya, B. & Amaghzaz, M., (2005).
