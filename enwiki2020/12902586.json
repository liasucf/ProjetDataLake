    "text": "Ocotea catharinensis is a member of the plant family Lauraceae. It is a slow- growing evergreen, a valuable hardwood tree of broad ecological importance, and it is threatened by habitat loss and by overexploitation for its timber and essential oils. ==Distribution== The tree is endemic to southeastern Brazil in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion. It is found in Paran\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and S\u00e3o Paulo states.Arboles de Am\u00e9rica: Ocotea catharinensis It can be a dominant canopy tree in the tropical rainforests of these states. It grows on deep, rich, well-drained soils on slopes between in elevation. ==Description== Ocotea catharinensis is a slow- growing monoecious evergreen hardwood up to 40m tall. Its flowers are small and hermaphrodite. The ovary is glabrous with a well developed ovule. Often not all the locelli are fertile. It is a honey-bearing tree and its fruits are eaten by birds and mammals, including the endangered monkey Brachyteles arachnoides.Paulo Backes & Bruno Irgang, Mata Atl\u00e2ntica - as \u00e1rvores e a paisagem, Porto Alegre, 2004, Paisagem do Sul, page 211 ==Uses== The tree is badly overexploited for its valuable hardwood, its essential oils with their (linalool) content, and for various pharmaceutical compounds or prospects such as neolignans. From the early- to mid-20th century the wood was popular for the flooring of houses in the Brazilian coastal State of Santa Catarina. ==Conservation== In 1997 it appeared in the IUCN Red List as a Vulnerable species, which it retains currently.

Since then it has been described as \"on the verge of extinction\" and research is being published on prospects for its somatic propagation. ==References== ===Further reading=== * Irgang, B.
