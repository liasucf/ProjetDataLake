The lyc\u00e9ens of Janson are called les jansoniens and they usually refer to their high school as Janson, or JdS. It is the biggest academic institution in the region: 3,200 boys and girls from 11 to 20 attend classes ranging from junior high school to Classes Pr\u00e9paratoires. ==History== Monsieur Janson de Sailly was a wealthy Parisian lawyer, who found out that his wife had a lover. Therefore, he decided to disinherit her and to bequeath all of his fortune to the State, under the condition that it be used to establish a modern high school that would offer an excellent education and in which no women would be allowed. The lyc\u00e9e was built in the 1880s. Victor Hugo who lived nearby made a speech for the inauguration. A decade later it was opened to girls as well. The lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly was the first Republican lyc\u00e9e of France (the others started as royal or imperial establishments); it aimed at training the future French scientific, literary, military, industrial, diplomatic and political male \u00e9lites of the young Third Republic. It gained a national reputation, and attracted students from around the country. It also became one of the lyc\u00e9es of Parisian high society. The motto of the lyc\u00e9e was Pour la Patrie, par le livre et par l'\u00e9p\u00e9e (For the Homeland, by the book and by the sword). Many alumni joined the military, and participated in the conquest of the French Colonial Empire, especially in Africa. In 1944, a few hundred Jansonians managed to leave the lyc\u00e9e and joined the French Free Forces (the 1st Army of Jean de Lattre de Tassigny): they founded le 2\u00e8me Bataillon de Choc, also known as Bataillon Janson-de-Sailly. They faced the German divisions in Alsace (especially in the battles of Masevaux and Colmar) during the counter-attack of Ardennes, and entered Germany with General Patton's forces in 1945. Commemorative plaques near the entrances of several classrooms and halls in the school buildings honor the memories of its alumni - including the war hero Roland Garros. ==Teaching== Nowadays, the 3,200 students are equally divided into the three traditional formations of the French Education System : coll\u00e8ge (30 classes with coll\u00e9giens from 11 to 14), lyc\u00e9e (30 classes with lyc\u00e9ens from 14 to 18) and Classes Pr\u00e9paratoires aux Grandes \u00e9coles or pr\u00e9pas (30 classes with students from 18 to 20). In France, students must study two foreign or regional languages. The first choice at Janson is English or German. The second choice is larger: English, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese or Russian. In classes pr\u00e9paratoires, there is even more choice with German, English, Arabic, Spanish, Italian, Russian as first language and all the aforementioned languages plus Japanese and Chinese as a second language. A student in Classes pr\u00e9paratoires can also take another second language not amongst those above. But those languages are available only through a partnership (the \"Langues Inter-\u00e9tablissement\") with other lyc\u00e9es with a wilder range of languages. The student would then study at Janson but go to another lyc\u00e9e to attend its foreign language class. For instance, the lyc\u00e9e Montaigne provides Portuguese and Polish and the lyc\u00e9e Buffon offers Hebrew and Swedish. The Lyc\u00e9e offers an ABIBAC section, with German history classes taught by a native speaker. The students taking part in the section will take the Abitur and the Baccalaur\u00e9at exams at the end of 12th grade. ==Ranking== Due to its geographical location, and to the number of its important alumni, Janson de Sailly has a high reputation. Its scholastic ranking puts it at or above the median for area schools.France Examen \"Analyse des r\u00e9sultats En 2015, les candidats du lyc\u00e9e Janson De Sailly qui se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au bac ES (s\u00e9rie \u00e9conomique et sociale) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 98,6 % \u00e0 d\u00e9crocher leur dipl\u00f4me et 59,7 % \u00e0 se voir d\u00e9cerner une mention.

Pin\u00e7on and Monique Pin\u00e7on-Charlot the school is predominantly attended by children from the upper class or from the aristocracy because of its location (the prestigious 16th arrondissement of Paris). ==Noted alumni== ===Politics and government=== * Jacques Attali (born 1943), political adviser * Robert Badinter (born 1928), French Minister of Justice * Jean-Louis Bianco (born 1943),
