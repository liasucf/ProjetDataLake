The central shopping is at Cowley Road is also the main shopping street of East Oxford, and in the evenings it is the area's main leisure district. Cowley Road, like most of Oxford, has an ethnically and economically diverse population. This includes significant, long-standing South Asian and Afro-Caribbean communities, who have been joined more recently by East European, Chinese and African arrivals. Alongside these ethnic groups, East Oxford plays host to many members of the city's academic population, both undergraduate and academic staff, and is home to many politically active groups. Cowley Road has high levels of both road traffic and pedestrian traffic, and space for both is limited. In 2005, Oxfordshire County Council invested about \u00a31,000,000 from central government to re-model the busiest part of Cowley Road. The carriageway has been realigned and colourfully resurfaced, the pavements have been repaved, cycle lanes have been enhanced in some places and removed from others and in one section the speed limit has been reduced to . ==Music and culture== The Cowley Road area has played a prominent part in the Oxford music scene. A number of successful bands made their formative performances in local venues such as the O2 Academy Oxford (formerly known as The Zodiac), and The Bullingdon (formerly The Art Bar). Famous Oxford bands have included Supergrass, Radiohead and Ride. Cowley Road is also home to the Cowley Road Carnival, an annual event when the road is pedestrianised, and which features live music, static sound systems, a parade, and food from around the world. Cowley Road Carnival has become an integral part of contemporary Oxford. Held on the first Sunday in July it celebrates the multicultural diversity of the city and regularly attracts around 50,000 visitors. A house party on the Cowley Road was the site to the UK band Foals' first ever gig. ==See also== * Cowley Road Carnival * CowleyRoad.org - an open access visual archive of the road * Ultimate Picture Palace, Jeune Street, off Cowley Road ==References== ==Sources and further reading== * * * Category:Roads in Oxfordshire Category:Shopping streets in Oxford ",
