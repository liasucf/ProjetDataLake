Pivot Legal Society asked participants to photograph things that were important to them, with the intent that this would give the participants a voice and recognition for their efforts. The initial contest led to the creation of a yearly calendar project where each year's winners are asked to share their story along with their image. This calendar is released in October of every year, and contains the winning photos of the participants chosen by local artists in the city. The calendars are sold through Megaphones vendor program which hires 200 people from low-income backgrounds each season, each vendor keeps half of their sales. There have been 75,000 calendars sold since 2003. In 2008 the book Hope in Shadows by Jerome and Brad Cran was released through Arsenal Pulp Press and the Pivot Legal Society that compiled 35 different stories attached to winning images from the photo contest. Their book took the stories associated with the winning photographs and expanded them with interviews of the photographers from the photo contest. They wrote about the traumas, abuse and mental illness but also friendship, laughter and love, which were reoccurring themes in the stories of the images. The stories capture the lives of First Nations people who survived residential schools, individuals coping with addictions, and others overcoming loss of loved ones. Hope in Shadows was published in 2009 and soon after this date the calendar sold 5000 more copies. Hope in Shadows won the City of Vancouver Book Award, was shortlisted for the Roderick Haig- Brown Regional Prize, and was longlisted for the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature. === University of British Columbia === Jerome has been teaching narrative, research writing and literature in the Department of English Language and Literatures at the University of British Columbia since 2004. === EVENT magazine === Jerome was an editor and author for the EVENT magazine, a literary magazine that has been publishing poetry, fiction and non-fiction for 46 years in Western Canada.
