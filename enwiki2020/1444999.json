    "text": "JCDecaux Group (JCDecaux SA, ) is a multinational corporation based in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris, France, known for its bus-stop advertising systems, billboards, public bicycle rental systems, and street furniture. It is the largest outdoor advertising corporation in the world. The company was founded in 1964 in Lyon, France by Jean-Claude Decaux. Over the years it has expanded aggressively, partly through acquisitions of smaller advertising companies in several countries. JCDecaux currently employs more than 13,030 people worldwide and maintains a presence in over 75 countries. In France alone, JCDecaux employs more than 3,500 people. == History == Jean-Claude Decaux (b. in 1937) first created a company in 1955 that specialised in Outdoor advertising alongside motorways. However, as these billboards were heavily taxed by law, Jean-Claude Decaux turned towards a business model in 1964 which was based on city billboards and invented the concept of advertising street furniture - well-maintained bus shelters fully funded by advertisers. Since the first concept of the bus shelter in 1964, JCDecaux has continued to innovate and offer different types of street furniture. During the 70s, JCDecaux launched its first Citylight Information Panels (CIPs), a 2m\u00b2 billboard with signage to indicate directions in cities to drivers. The first fully accessible automatic amenities were installed in San Francisco in 1994, although, in 1981, JCDecaux established a system of automatic public amenities in France. In 1981, JCDecaux also developed the News Electronic Journal, which broadcast news relating to culture, sport, associations and information about the city. JCDecaux then bought the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fermi\u00e8re des Colonnes Morris. The Senior billboards, which measure 8m\u00b2 and allow multiple ads on a single site, were created in the 1980s. The first scrolling billboards appeared in 1988, which increased the number of advertising panels without raising the number of structures. In 1999, the group acquired Havas Media Communication and Avenir. This acquisition allowed the Group to expand into the large format advertising market and into advertising in airports. In 2001, JCDecaux entered the Euronext Stock Exchangehttp://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2001-09-19/news-in-brief-jc- decaux-enters-euronext-index?ea9c8a2de0ee111045601ab04d673622 with an opening share price of \u20ac16,50. In 2002, Jean-Claude Decaux passed the management of the company on to two of his three sons, Jean-Charles Decaux and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Decaux, who then became co-CEOs of the company. JCDecaux installed its first rental system of self-service bicycles in Vienna in 2003 and then in Lyon in 2005. In 2007, JCDecaux won a tender for Paris\u2019 street furniture and bicycle rental system. Today, JCDecaux is ranked the number one company worldwide in self-service bicycles, with a fleet of 52,000 bicycles now present in 70 cities. JCDecaux operates this service under the brand Cyclocity. In 2011, JCDecaux acquired MediaKiosk (a company which own kiosks in France) as the main shareholder. As part of the open data movement, JCDecaux made available its data system of the rental bike service in 2013. The company is also recognized for its commitment to sustainable development and holds an ISO 14001 certification. == Activities == The JCDecaux Group specialises in advertising street furniture, large format billboards, advertising on public transport, and self-service bicycle rental systems. === Street furniture === Advertising street furniture was a concept invented by Jean-Claude Decaux. Street furniture includes bus shelters, Morris Columns, City Information Panels (CIP/MUPIs) and kiosks. Such formats enable advertisers to reach city centres, where large format billboards are not available. Cities can retain a portion of the advertising panels for their own use. In some countries, JCDecaux holds a contract in shopping malls. In order to adapt street furniture to the environment, JCDecaux works with internationally renowned designers, such as: Mario Bellini, Philip Cox, Peter Eisenman, Norman Foster, Patrick Jouin, Philippe Starck, Robert Stern, Martin Szekely and Jean-Michel Wilmotte. JCDecaux also has a Design Office, which works to improve and modernise furniture. Street furniture also includes a range of non-advertising sites, such as self-service toilets, electronic newspapers and interactive kiosks next to public benches, bins, columns, road signs, glass batteries and paper containers. === Transport advertising === The term transport includes Outdoor advertising in airports, on the underground, on buses, trams, and on taxis. JCDecaux operates concessions in 150 airports and over 300 subways, trains, trolleys and bus stations. In 2013, advertising in Transport accounted for 37.9% of JCDecaux's revenue. === Billboard advertising === Billboard advertising includes advertising billboards of more than 8m\u00b2. These formats can be adapted for many different purposes, such as for event artworks (for example: building wraps), which is operated by JCDecaux under the brand Artvertising. Individuals are offered the opportunity to lease part of their property (i.e. wall or garden) to JCDecaux as a billboard site. ==Bicycle rental systems== V\u00e9lib' bicycle hire station at S\u00e8vres \u2013 Lecourbe (Paris M\u00e9tro). JCDecaux van in France. The public bicycle rental systems are each financed by local advertising operators, in most cases in return for the cities signing over a 10-year licence to exploit citywide billboards. The overall scheme is called Cyclocity by the company, but each city's system is branded under an individual name. The cities that have implemented its bicycle rental systems are listed below.
