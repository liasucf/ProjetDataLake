These were the first matches with WT20I status to be played by Zimbabwe after the International Cricket Council announced that all matches played between women's teams of Associate Members after 1 July 2018 would have full T20I status. The venue for all of the matches was the Sparta Cricket Club Ground in Walvis Bay. Zimbabwe won the series 5\u20130.
