Owned by the Aboriginal Multi-Media Society, it broadcasts programming targeting southern Alberta's First Nations communities, including mainstream country music, and specialty shows featuring indigenous music or presented in native languages. == History == Following the collapse of the Aboriginal Voices Radio Network (which broadcast on 88.1 MHz in Calgary as CKAV-FM-3), the CRTC pursued new applicants for indigenous radio stations to fill its frequencies. The Aboriginal Multi-Media Society (owner of the indigenous network CFWE) was granted stations in Calgary and Edmonton. The Calgary station, named CJWE-FM, began testing its signal in April 2018, and officially launched in June. The station features similar programming to its Edmonton-based counterpart CFWE, including a mix of mainstream country music, and specialty programs targeting Southern Alberta's indigenous communities in the Blackfoot, Cree, Nakoda, and T'suutina languages. In December 2018, the CRTC granted approval for AMMSA to convert the CFWE rebroadcaster CFWE-FM-2 (Piikani 147) to a rebroadcaster of CJWE, as it would broadcast content of greater relevance to the region. == References == ==External links== * * CJWE-FM history - Canadian Communications Foundation * JWE JWE Category:Radio stations established in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in Alberta ",
