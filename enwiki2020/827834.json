    "text": "St Carannog in Llangrannog Llangrannog (sometimes spelt as Llangranog) is both a village and a community in Ceredigion, Wales, southwest of New Quay. It lies in the narrow valley of the River Hawen, which falls as a waterfall near the middle of the village. Llangrannog is on the Wales Coast Path. Llangrannog's population was 775, according to the 2011 census; a 2.6% fall since the 796 people noted in 2001. The 2011 census showed 46.5% of the town's population could speak Welsh, a fall from 51.8% in 2001. ==History== Llangrannog village was established around the church during the 6th century, although there is evidence of an early Celtic settlement at nearby Lochtyn. The church is dedicated to Caranog or Carantoc, son of Corun ab Caredig ab Cunedda, a sixth-century saint and founder of several churches in Wales. Originally built of wood 500AD, the present building dates from 1885, albeit containing earlier features; it consists of a nave and chancel connected through a pointed arch. On either side of the entrance to the chancel is an ornamental pew. The one on the left bears the date 1674 and belonged to a local mansion, Pigeonsford. The other one is dated 1718 and belonged to Moel Ivor and Cwmowen.Meyrick, Samuel Rush. (1907) The History of Cardiganshire. Stephen Collard.pg. 230. The 'church village' is hidden by a twist of the valley and cannot be seen from the sea. This protected it from the attention of the Vikings and the Irish sea marauders. After the mid-eighteenth century, a small seaport developed. By 1825, Llangrannog commercial activity was largely concerned with the sea, including the shipment of coal. A number of ships were built on the sands, the largest being the \"Ann Catherine\" a brig of 211 tons. The most recent developments, in the 1860s, were the 'ribbon village' which connected the beach and church villages and an extension of the beach village onto the southern slopes of the valley. St Mary's Well () was a popular destination for pilgrims who would take the water for health purposes. The waterfall on the River Hawen used to drive a woollen mill situated a few yards away. Examples of cloth manufactured here are on display at the museum at Drefach Velindre near Newcastle Emlyn. ==Geography== The large rock between Llangrannog and Cilborth Beaches is Carreg Bica, a stack of Ordovician rock weathered by the sea, one of many along the coastline. A large piece of Carreg Bica fell away some years ago. Llangrannog's beach has received Blue Flag beach status. An RNLI lifeguard service is provided. Two streams flow down the beach to the sea - the Hawen and the smaller Nant Eisteddfa. There is a waterfall on the Hawen, known as Y Gerwn. Located within the community is the tiny island of Ynys Lochtyn. ==Urdd== The summer camp (Gwersyll) of Urdd Gobaith Cymru \u2013 a Welsh youth movement \u2013 is located near the village of Llangrannog. The first summer camp held here was in 1932, in a field on Cefn Cwrt farm. In its early days, the camp consisted of wooden huts for the girls and tents for the boys. Basic catering was provided by the campers. The field was rented by the movement until 1968 when the whole farm was put up for sale. Urdd purchased the 160 acre farm, constructing permanent buildings on the site to provide a quality leisure and educational facility. Also on site is a dry ski slope, a go-kart track and a swimming pool; horse-riding is also offered. Catering today is provided professionally.The Story of Llangrannog, by Mervyn Davies, Gomer Press, 2003Llangrannog, by J.
