Dean Martin scored his only UK number-one single this year with \"Memories Are Made of This\", which spent four weeks at the top of the chart. Johnnie Ray spent seven weeks at number-one with \"Just Walking in the Rain\", which also became the Christmas number-one of 1956. Tennessee Ernie Ford was one of two artists to reach the top 10 with \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\". His version peaked at number three in January, while Bill Hayes took it to number two in the same month. Ford also reached number-one with \"Sixteen Tons\" around the same time. The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles. This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1956, as well as singles which peaked in 1955 and 1957 but were in the top 10 in 1956. The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). Eighty-four singles were in the top ten in 1956. Eight singles from 1955 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while \"Make It a Party\" by Winifred Atwell, \"Singing the Blues\" by Guy Mitchell and \"True Love\" by Bing Crosby & Grace Kelly were all released in 1956 but did not reach their peak until 1957. \"Meet Me on the Corner\" by Max Bygraves, \"Suddenly There's a Valley\" by Petula Clark and \"Twenty Tiny Fingers\" by The Stargazers were the singles from 1955 to reach their peak in 1956. Eighteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1956. Elvis Presley, Frankie Vaughan and Lonnie Donegan were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1956. The 1955 Christmas number-one, \"Christmas Alphabet\" by Dickie Valentine, remained at number-one for the first week of 1956. The first new number-one single of the year was \"Sixteen Tons\" by Tennessee Ernie Ford. Overall, eleven different singles peaked at number-one in 1956, with eleven unique artists having the most singles hit that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== Eighty-four singles charted in the top 10 in 1956, with seventy-nine singles reaching their peak this year. The EP All Star Hit Parade consisted of six songs by different artists who are all credited for the individual songs but only counts as one entry in the table. Fourteen songs were recorded by several artists with each version reaching the top 10: *\"A Tear Fell\" - Lita Roza (on All Star Hit Parade), Teresa Brewer *\"Blue Suede Shoes\" - Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley *\"It's Almost Tomorrow\" - David Whitfield, The Dream Weavers *\"Memories Are Made of This\" - Dave King with The Keynotes, Dean Martin *\"More\" - Jimmy Young, Perry Como *\"My September Love\" - David Whitfield, Joan Regan (on All Star Hit Parade) *\"No Other Love\" - Dave King (on All Star Hit Parade), Ronnie Hilton *\"Only You (And You Alone)\" - The Hilltoppers, The Platters *\"Sixteen Tons\" - Frankie Laine with The Mellomen, Tennessee Ernie Ford *\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" - Bill Hayes, Tennessee Ernie Ford *\"The Great Pretender\" - Jimmy Parkinson, The Platters *\"The Green Door\" - Frankie Vaughan, Jim Lowe & The High Fives *\"Theme from The Threepenny Opera\" - Dick Hyman Trio, Louis Armstrong with His All-Stars, Winifred Atwell *\"The Wayward Wind\" - Gogi Grant, Tex Ritter Eighteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1956. Bill Haley & His Comets secured the record for most top 10 hits in 1956 with six hit singles. Ronnie Hilton was one of a number of artists with two top-ten entries, including the number-one single \"No Other Love\". David Whitfield, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Young, Perry Como and Tennessee Ernie Ford were among the other artists who had multiple top 10 entries in 1956. ===Chart debuts=== Thirty-six artists achieved their first top 10 single in 1956, either as a lead or featured artist. Of these, three went on to record another hit single that year: Dave King, The Goons and The Platters. Lonnie Donegan achieved two more chart hits in 1956. Elvis Presley had three other entries in his breakthrough year. The following table (collapsed on desktop site) does not include acts who had previously charted as part of a group and secured their first top 10 solo single. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c; |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Artist ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Number of top 10s ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| First entry ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" data-sort- type=\"number\"| Chart position ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Other entries |- | |1 |\"Join In and Sing Again\" |9 |-- |- |Bill Hayes |1 |\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" |2 |-- |- |Lonnie Donegan |3 |\"Rock Island Line\" |8 |\"Lost John\"/\"Stewball\" (2), \"Bring a Little Water, Sylvie\"/\"Dead or Alive\" (7) |- |Eve Boswell |1 |\"Pickin' a Chicken\" |9 |-- |- |Gary Miller |1 |\"Robin Hood\" |10 |-- |- |Lou Busch |1 |\"Zambezi\" |2 |-- |- | |1 |\"Only You (And You Alone)\" |3 |-- |- | |1 |\"It's Almost Tomorrow\" |1 |-- |- |Don Cherry |1 |\"Band of Gold\" |6 |-- |- |Edmund Hockridge |1 |\"Young and Foolish\" |10 |-- |- |Dave King |2 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Memories Are Made of This\" |rowspan=\"2\"|5 |\"No Other Love\" (2) |- |The Keynotes |1 |-- |- |Jimmy Parkinson |1 |\"The Great Pretender\" |9 |-- |- |Dick Hyman Trio |1 |\"Theme from The Threepenny Opera\" |9 |-- |- |Billy May |1 |\"Main Title Theme from The Man with the Golden Arm\" |9 |-- |- |Don Robertson |1 |\"The Happy Whistler\" |8 |-- |- |Elvis Presley |4 |\"Heartbreak Hotel\" |2 |\"Blue Moon\", \"Blue Suede Shoes\" (9), \"Hound Dog\" (2) |- |Carl Perkins |1 |\"Blue Suede Shoes\" |10 |-- |- |Morris Stoloff |1 |\"Moonglow and Theme from Picnic\" |7 |-- |- |Johnny Dankworth |1 |\"Experiments with Mice\" |7 |-- |- |Various Artists |1 |\"All Star Hit Parade (EP)\" |2 |-- |- | |2 |\"I'm Walking Backwards for Christmas\"/\"Bluebottle Blues\" |4 |\"The Ying Tong Song\"/\"Bloodnok's Rock 'N' Roll Call\" (3) |- |Frankie Lymon |rowspan=\"2\"|1 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" |rowspan=\"2\"|1 |rowspan=\"2\"|-- |- | |- |Gogi Grant |1 |\"The Wayward Wind\" |9 |-- |- |Tex Ritter |1 |\"The Wayward Wind\" |8 |-- |- |Mel Torm\u00e9 |1 |\"Mountain Greenery\" |4 |-- |- |Anne Shelton |1 |\"Lay Down Your Arms\" |1 |-- |- | |1 |\"Born to Be with You\" |8 |-- |- | |2 |\"The Great Pretender\"/\"Only You (And You Alone)\" |5 |\"My Prayer\" (4) |- | |1 |\"Hound Dog\" |2 |-- |- |Freddie Bell and the Bellboys |1 |\"Giddy Up a Ding Dong\" |4 |-- |- |Jim Lowe |rowspan=\"2\"|1 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"The Green Door\" |rowspan=\"2\"|8 |rowspan=\"2\"|-- |- | |- |Mitchell Torok |1 |\"When Mexico Gave Up the Rhumba\" |6 |-- |- |Grace Kelly |1 |\"True Love\" |4 |-- |} ;Notes The EP All Star Hit Parade, which peaked at number two in July, featured the following songs: \"Out of Town\" by Dickie Valentine; \"My September Love\" by Joan Regan; \"Theme from The Threepenny Opera\" by Winifred Atwell; \"No Other Love\" by Dave King; \"A Tear Fell\" by Lita Roza and \"It's Almost Tomorrow\" by David Whitfield.

Elvis Presley re-recorded his song \"Blue Suede Shoes\" for the 1960 film he starred in, G.I. Blues. \"Hound Dog\" was first recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets and featured in Rock Around the Clock, but Elvis Presley took the song into the top ten.

However in 2011 the Official Charts Company released a list of the best-selling single of each year in chart history from 1952 to date. According to the list, \"I'll Be Home\" by Pat Boone is officially recorded as the biggest-selling single of 1956. ==Top-ten singles== ;Key {| Class=\"wikitable\" !Symbol !Meaning |- |bgcolor=lightblue|\u2021 |Single peaked in 1955 but still in chart in 1956. |- |bgcolor=#DDFFDD|\u2666 |Single released in 1956 but peaked in 1957. |- |(#) |Year-end best-selling single. |- !Entered |The date that the single first appeared in the chart. |- !Peak |Highest position that the single reached in the UK Singles Chart. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
