    "text": "\"LoveStoned\" (also known as \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\") is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake for his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006). It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Nate \"Danja\" Hills. In contrast to the album's theme about sexual innuendos with themes of love, \"LoveStoned\" contains sexually suggestive lyrics. Musically \"LoveStoned\" is an upbeat dance song, contrasting with the interlude of \"I Think She Knows\" which has a more slow, quiet, guitar-driven sound. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording at the 2008 ceremony. The official remix by Justice, Ti\u00ebsto and Kaskade was released later. == Background == \"LoveStoned\" was recorded at the Thomas Crown Studios, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia (pictured). After the release of his debut solo album Justified in 2002, Timberlake thought he \"lost his voice\" in the sense that he did not like what he was doing. He felt \"burnt out\" after Justified; this partly changed his career's direction, wherein he took a break from the music industry and instead appeared in films. When he felt inspired to compose songs again, he did not choose to reunite with his former band NSYNC, although he considered doing it after his first record. Instead, he went to former Justified collaborator Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia to begin sessions for his second album. However, not one of them had an idea of what the album would be\u2013no plan for it and even a title. \"LoveStoned / I Think She Knows\" was written by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Nate \"Danja\" Hills as a sexual love song. In an interview with MTV News, while promoting his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake revealed that the first half of the album generally focuses on sex. \"LoveStoned\" contains sexually suggestive lyrics, with the line, \"She's going home with me tonight\". == Composition == \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\" is an R&B; and art rock song. The song is composed in the key of F minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The first part of the song, \"LoveStoned\", starts off to \"a boast\" and the interlude \"I Think She Knows\" transitions into \"an adoring two-minute love song about someone special\". The song also includes \"human beatbox sounds\". The musicscape features string arrangements on both songs and includes Timberlake's \"famous falsetto\". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Timberlake admitted that the \"drony guitar interlude\" featured in \"I Think She Knows\" was inspired by the alternative rock band Interpol. The Guardian's Alexis Petridis said of the unexpected shift in tone, \"the sweaty, slap-bass funk vanishes, in favour of vigorously strummed, vaguely Sonic Youth-ish guitars, luscious strings and a gorgeous Kraftwerk-inspired counter-melody.\" Martin Turenne of The Georgia Straight described \"LoveStoned\" as \"a space-age disco track in which he [Timberlake] rhapsodizes about a statuesque goddess who casts a lustfully narcotic spell, leaving him defenceless against her predatory wiles\". Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald reported that the song has a \"prowling funk\" sound. Jon Pareles of The New York Times noted that the sound was similar of recording artist Michael Jackson's 1983 song \"Billie Jean\". Pareles concluded that the track's \"pulsating guitar arrangement\" were those similar to rock band U2. Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described the theme of the song as, \"Justin sees a gorgeous girl on the floor and longs to bring her back to the VIP Room and/or just cut to the chase and take her directly home\". Barry Schwartz of Stylus magazine interpreted Timberlake's point of view, citing that \"LoveStoned\" is \"high from sex\". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun said that FutureSex/LoveSounds is a \"bedroom\" album and included \"LoveStoned\" as part of it. Turenne concluded that the single is not just a song, \"it's the start of an S&M; porno script\". == Critical response == Justin Timberlake performing \"LoveStoned\" during his 2007 FutureSex/LoveShow concert tour In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: \"Superior tracks, like 'LoveStoned' and 'What Comes Around', suggest a happy middle path, where Timberlake can equally embrace Timbaland's canny beats and his own vocal helium.\" Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media described the song as \"brilliantly ... tight, clipped disco funk\" and went onto say that it \"descends precipitously into the gorgeous melancholy of 'I Think That She Knows', all MOR-rock guitar churn and weightless strings, the same chorus ... transformed from infatuation to the paranoid and elegiac admission of an addict\". Lauren Murphy of Entertainment.ie noted \"LoveStoned\" as excellent and \"a sexy, layered affair with inspired violin intervals, and the consecutive interlude is a classy sliver of deftly-produced pop\". Lucy Davies of the BBC wrote: \"'LoveStoned' is a great track, with chopping violins, beatboxing, and bongos. 'I Think She Knows', the interlude which follows, is quite beautiful, shimmering, and brilliantly constructed.\" Jonah Weiner of Blender wrote, \"From the grinding 'SexyBack' to the percolating 'LoveStoned' ... the vibe is all infectious, feverish build-up.\" Rolling Stone believed that \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\" was the \"madcap peak\" of the \"historic creative roll\" of Timberlake and Timbaland, describing the song as \"flowing from hip-hop bump- and-grind to an ambient wash of Interpol-inspired guitar drone.\" In November 2007, musician John Mayer wrote in his blog that he very much preferred the interlude. \"Not so much for the 'LoveStoned' part, but for the 45 seconds of ultimate sonic bliss that is 'I Think She Knows'.\" Mayer went onto say that the song was Timberlake's \"breakthrough moment as an artist\" and complimented him on the musical style of the song.
