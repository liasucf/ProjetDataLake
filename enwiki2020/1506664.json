    "text": "Colegio Nacional Enrique Nv\u00f3 Okenve (or Enrique Nv\u00f3 Okenve National College) is a college in Equatorial Guinea. The college has two campuses, based in the cities of Bata (seat) and Malabo. It was originally created in 1959, under Spanish colonial administration, under the name of Centro Laboral La Salle de Bata. After independence in 1968, the college was renamed to honor Enrique Nv\u00f3 Okenve, a martyr for independence and founder of the Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial. Okenve's nationalist ideas and his rise to power in sections of northern R\u00edo Muni concerned Spanish-appointed Governor-General Faustino Ruiz Gonz\u00e1lez, who has been alleged to be responsible for contract killers who assassinated Okenve in 1959. Renovation of the Malabo site and reconditioning of the Bata site has been funded by USAID.\"TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROJECT FOR SOCIAL INVESTMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING IN EQUATORIAL GUINEA\", Design and Implementation Plan, Contract No. DFD-I-00-05-0020 TO #2, (September 2006 through August 2008). ==Notable people== *Teodoro Obiang (student at \"La Salle de Bata\") - military and political;Revendo \"Minha vida pelo meu povo\" III.
