Place, identity, culture, and social justice are frequent themes in her work. Many of Ekua's collages are reminiscent of works by African and African American artists such as the late Romare Bearden and Njideka Akunyili. About her work, Holmes said, > \u201cIn everything I create I hear them saying, \u2018Remember Me,\u2019 and through my > work I honor their legacies by bringing them forward to life with torn and > cut shapes of found colors and textures. With these scraps and remnants, > assembled like a down-home quilt, I rebuild my world, putting in what speaks > to my personal and cultural narrative.\u201d === Google Doodle === On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2015, Holmes's Google Doodle illustration honoring the civil rights leader was the featured image on Google's U.S. homepage.
