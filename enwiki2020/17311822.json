His films have been described as animated still life as they are made from various drawings in which the images change to trigger responses within the human mind. He uses his paintings and collages by overlapping the colors and textures to seem as if they are in fact \u201cmoving\u201d in a hypnotic fashion. Images of influential behaviorists, Hermann Rorschach and Ivan Pavlov, appear in some of his films. The films are highly irrational in their juxtapositions, but this is the intention of the filmmaker. Scher wants his viewers to create their own stories from the visuals he provides. Films such as All the Wrong Reasons seek to create of feeling of dreaming. One should have a sense of dreaming while awake and a connection to the subconscious mind. Scher\u2019s abstract films are all approximately two and a half minutes long. He feels that this amount of time is more than enough to allow the viewer to become engaged. Although digital tools are cheaper and faster for creating film, Scher prefers vintage machinery and technologies to create his image-rich films to effectively affect the senses. He uses the rotoscopic technique which involves projecting film frames on to paper and then tracing them by hand. After this, the paper images are animated by separately shooting each sheet as a single frame. ==Films== * NYC (1976) Re:Voir * Reasons To Be Glad (1980) * Aria Striata (1985) * Prisoners of Inertia: full-length film that Scher both wrote and directed (1989) * Milk of Amnesia (1992) * Garden of Regrets (1994) * Four Letter Heaven (1995) * Nerve Tonic (1995) * Trigger Happy (1997) * Yours (1997) * Shorts International Film Festival Trailers (1997/98) * Bang Bang (1998) * SID (1998) * Turkish Trailer (1998) * Postcards From Warren (1998) * Grand Central (1999) * Goodnight Moon (opening for an HBO special) (1999) * You Won\u2019t Remember This (2002)New York Times * Spin Cycle (2003) * Still Loaf with Guitar (2003) * Lost and Found (2004) * Tick Tock (2005) * Coke Girl (2005) Encyclopedia.com * Woman on the Beach (2005) * Memento Mickey (2005) * Oxygen (2006) * Paper View (2007)New York Times * White Out (2007)New York Times * L\u2019eau Life (2007)New York Times * Tulips (2008)New York Times * All the Wrong Reasons (2008) ==Accolades== * Creative Arts Emmy Award: Animation for The Number on Great-Grandpa's Arm Adjunct Jeff Scher wins Emmy-NYU-TISCH ==References== ==External links== * Jeff Scher Web site * Scher's official YouTube channel * BTS: The Studio of Jeff Scher | The Number on Great- Grandpa's Arm | HBO Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Bard College alumni Category:American animators Category:American animated film directors Category:Primetime Emmy Award winners Category:American experimental filmmakers ",
