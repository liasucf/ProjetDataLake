    "text": "The Story So Far is the third album by the Tewkesbury ska punk band Spunge. It was released on 26 August 2002 on the B-Unique Records label and recorded at two studios, Sawmills and Jacobs. The record was produced by John Cornfield (Supergrass, Muse) and Chris Sheldon (Foo Fighters, Therapy?). The album perhaps marks a change in the band's sound, from a more laid-back ska style to a more rock sound. Two singles, \"Jump on Demand\" and \"Roots\", were released from the album.. The Story So Far includes a new version of the single \"Ego\", from Room For Abuse. ==Track listing== # \"The Story So Far\" \u2013 4:16 # \"Roots\" \u2013 3:51 # \"Give It A Try\" \u2013 2:34 # \"Change of Scene\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Skanking Song\" \u2013 2:23 # \"Dotted Line\" \u2013 3:28 # \"Ego\" \u2013 3:05 # \"Jump on Demand\" \u2013 3:35 # \"It's Over\" \u2013 2:41 # \"Friend Called Fred\" \u2013 3:55 # \"Too Little Too Late\" \u2013 3:59 Category:2002 albums Category:Spunge albums Category:Albums produced by John Cornfield ",
