    "text": "The Argentine presidential election of 1862 was held on 4 September to choose the first president of Argentina. Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre was elected president. ==Background== These elections were all indirectly decided in the electoral college, and not reflective of popular vote (whose turnout averaged 10% of male suffrage). The cosmetic nature of this electoral system, which became known locally as the voto cantado (the \"vote song,\" for its predetermined script), resulted from a period of intermittent civil wars between those who favored a united Argentina with a strong central government (Unitarians) and Buenos Aires Province leaders who favored an independent nation of their own (Federalists). These conflicts had dominated local political life since 1820, and did not immediately subside with the enactment of the Argentine Constitution of 1853. The military guarantor of the Argentine Confederation, General Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza, lost control over his appointed successor, Santiago Derqui, and this led Buenos Aires Governor Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre to take up arms in defense of autonomy against what he saw as Derqui's reneging on their 1860 gentlemen's agreement. Victorious at the 1861 Battle of Pav\u00f3n, Mitre obtained important concessions from the national army - notably the amendment of the Constitution to provide for indirect elections through an electoral college comprised - by design - somewhat disproportionately of electors from the nation's hinterland provinces.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. A skilled negotiator, Mitre placated restive sentiment in Buenos Aires and Entre R\u00edos Provinces (where separatist sentiment was highest), and nominated Marcos Paz, a Federalist and former Mitre foe, as his running mate. Arranging an electoral college election on 4 September 1862, he and Paz received the body's unanimous support.Todo Argentina: 1862 ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" ! colspan=2| Argentine Republic |- | align=left| Population | 1,400,000 |- | align=left| Voters | 14,000 |- | align=left| Turnout | 1% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"45%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Presidential Candidates !width=\"30%\"| Party !width=\"20%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre | Liberal Party | 133 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 133 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 23 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 156 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"45%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Vice Presidential Candidates !width=\"30%\"| Party !width=\"20%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Marcos Paz | Liberal Party | 91 |- | Manuel Taboada | Unitarian | 16 |- | Tadeo Rojo | \u2014 | 6 |- | Domingo Faustino Sarmiento | \u2014 | 5 |- | Mariano Fragueiro | Unitarian | 5 |- | Dalmacio V\u00e9lez Sarsfield | Unitarian | 3 |- | Manuel Anselmo Ocampo | \u2014 | 3 |- | Manuel Urdinarrain | \u2014 | 3 |- | Valent\u00edn Alsina | Unitarian | 1 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 133 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 23 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 156 |} === Results by Province === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2| Province !
