    "text": "' (\"Article 52 of the Italian Football Federation regulations for internal organisation\") governs the status of phoenix clubs in football in Italy. The article was revised in 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2014. ==Comma 3== According to Comma 3 of the article, a new company from the same city could be admitted to the same division to replace a bankrupted football club company, if the company had acquired the bankrupted company as well as being willing to take over the liabilities to pay sports related debt, as well as any outstanding taxes. ===Examples=== ;Serie B * F.C. Bari 1908: (2014) ;Lega Pro * Ascoli Picchio F.C. 1898: (2014) * Carrarese Calcio 1908: (2016) * U.S. Foggia: (2004) * S.S. Virtus Lanciano 1924: (2008) * A.C. Monza Brianza 1912: (2004) * Delfino Pescara 1936: (2009) * Aurora Pro Patria 1919: (2009) * S.S. Sambenedettese Calcio: (2006) * Savona F.B.C.: (2012) ;Serie D * A.R.L.S.S.D. Atletico San Paolo Padova: (2014) * A.S.D. Citt\u00e0 di Foligno 1928: (2015) *U.S. Imperia 1923: (2000) * A.C.R. Messina: (2009) * S.S.D. Vivi Altotevere Sansepolcro: (2014) ;Eccellenza *S.S.D. Massese: (2009) * Fulgor Maceratese: (2009) * F.C. Sezze Latina: (2003) ;Promozione * A.C. Cesenatico: (2000) * A.C. Trento S.C.S.D.: (2014) * A.S.D. Amici del Verbania: (2006) ==Comma 6 to 7 (Lodo Petrucci)== Lodo Petrucci ('Petrucci Award') was a ruling named after Gianni Petrucci. Ratified in 2004, instead of acquiring the sports title by clearing the debt, FIGC could award the title to a new company based on the historic sporting merit of the old club. However, in such a situation the new club was automatically relegated to one level below the original club. In 2008 this changed to an automatic relegation two levels below the original club, and was limited to Serie A and B clubs only. However, the ruling was abolished completely in 2015 as its criteria were too subjective. ===Examples=== ;Serie A \u2192 Serie B * Societ\u00e0 Civile Campo Torino: (2005) ;Serie B \u2192 Serie C1 *Perugia Calcio: (2005) *Salernitana Calcio 1919: (2005) ;Serie C1 \u2192 Serie C2 * A.S. Andria BAT: (2005) * Benevento Calcio: (2005) * Reggio Emilia F.C.: (2005) * SPAL 1907: (2005) * S.S.C. Venezia: (2005) Some clubs unsuccessfully tried the \"Lodo\" so they had to pay part of the old debts to create the new phoenix club. These cases were privately managed by the FIGC without specific rules as the ACF Fiorentina case in 2002: *Napoli Soccer: (2004) * A.C. Ancona: (2004) ==Comma 10== Comma 10 of the article allowed a new company could be admit to Serie D to replace the old football club that not admitted to professional leagues. It was the Comma 9 but became 10 in the 2010 amendment. One of the example was the failed auction of Parma F.C., which the debt was stood at \u20ac22.6 million. (reduced from over \u20ac70 million by the resettlement during administration) ===Examples=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! City ! Team ! Year !
