In 2006, the NSW government released a planning strategy for Metropolitan Sydney, known as the City of Cities plan for Sydney. The plan identified Bankstown as a 'major centre' for the south west Sydney region. Bankstown Airport was also identified as a 'specialist centre' and the Hume Highway as part of a potential transport corridor. Under the most recent Draft Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney released in 2013, the NSW Government has reaffirmed Bankstown as a major centre, and Bankstown Airport as a specialised centre. The last Mayor of the City of Bankstown Council was Clr Khal Asfour, a member of the Labor Party. A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Bankstown merge with the City of Canterbury to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 351,000.

In 1826, bush rangers were hanged on the site where the water tower now stands. District of Bankstown was named by Governor Hunter in 1797 in honour of botanist Sir Joseph Banks, who travelled to Australia with Captain James Cook in 1770. The area was discovered during an expedition of the Georges River by George Bass and Matthew Flinders. The area of first European settlement along the river has been partially preserved as part of the Mirrumbeena Regional Reserve. Bankstown also includes large areas of the Georges River National Park. Railway formed an important part of the development of Bankstown. After the extension of the railway from Belmore to Bankstown in the 1890s, rapid development of the area followed \u2013 so much so that the commercial centre of Bankstown moved from its former position in Irish Town (Now Yagoona) on Liverpool Road to the vicinity of Bankstown railway station. In March 1895 a petition was submitted to the NSW Colonial Government by 109 residents of the Bankstown area, requesting the establishment of the \"Municipal District of Bankstown\" under the Municipalities Act, 1867. The petition was subsequently accepted and the Municipal District of Bankstown was proclaimed by Lieutenant Governor Sir Frederick Darley on 7 September 1895. The first six-member council, standing in one at-large constituency, was elected on 4 November 1895. With the passing of the Local Government Act 1906, the council area became known as the Municipality of Bankstown. Bankstown's city status was proclaimed in 1980 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the \"City of Bankstown\". On 12 May 2016, the City of Bankstown was merged with the City of Canterbury to form the Canterbury-Bankstown Council. ===World War II=== The Bankstown Bunker was an exact replica of the underground Ops rooms of wartime England, which directed Britain's air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German Luftwaffe. Entrance to the bunker was obtained through a concrete passageway which was well screened by a grassy slope; a stairway led to a virtual maze of corridors and hallways leading to various sections. There were two points into the bunker (escape hatches) which were guarded by military police, and access was gained via the bottom level.(information supplied by R. Eyers VAOC worker) The walls of the bunker could almost withstand a direct hit from a bomb. It had all the attenuated fixtures necessary to run a top secret operational defence base. It consisted of three Fixer Stations and one Homing Station. The bunker was also equipped with its own code room, plotting rooms, two escape tunnels and a radio transmitter room. In the centre of the bunker was a large room of about two stories in height. This was the main operations room and control centre for all RAAF Missions in the Pacific area. ==Geography== The former Bankstown City region was approximately and had a population density of about 21.46 people per hectare.\"Community Profile \u2013 Summary .\" Retrieved 29 July 2007.

Salt Pan Creek is a saltmarsh and mangrove swamp that extends from Canterbury Road to Georges River. Paul Keating Park, in the centre of Bankstown, stands on the old site of the Council Administration building, which burned down in an accidental fire in 1997. The Park is used for a variety of concerts and festivals (including the annual Bankstown Christmas Carols), and is otherwise a large playing field. Nowadays, all of the Council operations are contained in the Civic Tower, adjacent to the Park. Bankstown Town Hall faces opposite.Bankstown Civic Tower, home to the Bankstown City Council The three-storey complex of Central Bankstown Library, opened in 1983. ===Parks=== Bankstown had 293 parks covering within its city limits.
