    "text": "In quantum information theory, the channel-state duality refers to the correspondence between quantum channels and quantum states (described by density matrices). Phrased differently, the duality is the isomorphism between completely positive maps (channels) from A to Cn\u00d7n, where A is a C*-algebra and Cn\u00d7n denotes the n\u00d7n complex entries, and positive linear functionals (states) on the tensor product :\\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n} \\otimes A. ==Details== Let H1 and H2 be (finite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces. The family of linear operators acting on Hi will be denoted by L(Hi). Consider two quantum systems, indexed by 1 and 2, whose states are density matrices in L(Hi) respectively. A quantum channel, in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, is a completely positive (CP for short), trace-preserving linear map :\\Phi : L(H_1) \\rightarrow L(H_2) that takes a state of system 1 to a state of system 2. Next we describe the dual state corresponding to \u03a6. Let Ei j denote the matrix unit whose ij-th entry is 1 and zero elsewhere. The (operator) matrix :\\rho_{\\Phi} = (\\Phi(E_{ij}))_{ij} \\in L(H_1) \\otimes L(H_2) is called the Choi matrix of \u03a6. By Choi's theorem on completely positive maps, \u03a6 is CP if and only if \u03c1\u03a6 is positive (semidefinite). One can view \u03c1\u03a6 as a density matrix, and therefore the state dual to \u03a6. The duality between channels and states refers to the map :\\Phi \\rightarrow \\rho_{\\Phi}, a linear bijection. This map is also called Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism or Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism. == Applications == This isomorphism is used to show that the \"Prepare and Measure\" Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, such as the BB84 protocol devised by C. H. Bennett and G. BrassardC. H. Bennett and G. Brassard, \u201cQuantum Cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing\u201d, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems, and Signal Processing, Bangalore, 175 (1984) are equivalent to the \"Entanglement-Based\" QKD protocols, introduced by A. K. Ekert. More details on this can be found e.g. in the book Quantum Information Theory by M. Wilde.M. Wilde, \"Quantum Information Theory\" - Cambridge University Press 2nd ed.
