Her work surrounds themes of the daily life, portraiture, and realism and is known for her large scale artworks. She is a member of the Royal Chicano Air Force (RCAF) artist collective since 1973. == Early life and education == Garcia-Nakata was born in Yuba City, California as the third generation in her family to reside in the United States. She grew up in the Central Valley and identifies as Chicana. Lorraine lived in Oroville, California before moving to Olivehurst, California with her family where they worked on the fields. Lorraine earned an Associates of Arts Degree from Yuba College, in Marysville, CA in 1973. She transferred to California State University, Sacramento as an Art major and graduated with honors in 1974. In 1979 she earned her final degree in the University of Washington, School of Art, in Seattle,n. == Current affiliations == Garcia- Nakata is currently part of the Chairman's Advisory Committee at the Friends of National Museum For the American Latino since 2017. She is a founding member of the San Francisco Latino Historical Society since 2015. In 1997 she became part of the International Advisory for the Diego Rivera Mural in San Francisco City College and in 1995 she was an Advisory Board member for the Kearny Street Art Workshop, also located in San Francisco. == Major artworks == === Southside Park Mural, 1977 === The famous multi panel mural project in Sacramento, California was restored in 2001 by the RCAF group, including Garcia-Nakata who designed, outlined, and painted two Amerindian women with their hands open. These murals provide a culturally appropriate setting for community events such as Cinco de Mayo, Dia de Los Muertos, or the Barrio Olympics. Each panel has its own distinctive artistic style and make references to pre-Columbian, Neo-Amerindian, and Chicanx youth iconography. === Friends, No Matter What, 2008 === This artwork is done with charcoal and pastel on paper and was exhibited online at the Museo Eduardo Carrillo website. It represents the artist herself and her African American friend playing hide and seek, while standing back to back and blindfolded. It references the racial tension that has existed throughout American culture and personal experiences of the artists. === Facio Nova Omnia II: Colonia and Facio Nova Omnia II: Indigena, 2005 === This diptych consists of two unidentified women with their backs towards the viewers dressed in complete different attire. Colonia has a blue formal dress on completely faceless, while Indigena is slightly turned towards her left shoulder wearing her indigenous attire and long braided hair. Both of these women are assumed to come from different backgrounds and their juxtaposition makes it easier for viewers to distinguish this cultural gap between them. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * 2015- Navigating By Hand: Lorraine Garc\u00eda-Nakata Retrospective 1964-2015, September 5-October 16, 2015, Galeria de la Raza/Studio 24, San Francisco, CA * 2013/14- Navigating By Hand: Lorraine Garc\u00eda-Nakata, Museo Eduard, September 15, 2013 \u2013 February 2014, Santa Cruz, CA * 2008- RCAF In Flight: Lorraine Garcia Nakata, solo exhibition, Galer\u00eda Posada, Aug. 8 \u2013 Oct.19, Sacramento, CA * 1993- So Do You Want the Truth, Intercultural Gallery, Sonoma State University, CA. * 1990- The Red Shoes ( an Installation), Squiggle Performance and Installation Gallery, San Francisco, CA.Mar. 1 - 31 * 1983- Eye Dream Space, Sacramento, CA * 1981- Progressive Gallery, Sonoma State University, CA * 1980- Nicole's, Sacramento, CA * 1978- California State University, Sacramento, CA * 1974- Lorraine Garcia Exhibition, California State University, Sacramento, CA === Group exhibitions (past 10 years) === * 2013/14- Navigating By Hand: Lorraine Garc\u00eda-Nakata, Museo Eduard, September 15, 2013 \u2013 February 2014, Santa Cruz, CA * 2008- RCAF In Flight: Lorraine Garcia Nakata, solo exhibition, Galer\u00eda Posada, Aug. 8 \u2013 Oct.19, Sacramento, CA * 1993- So Do You Want the Truth, Intercultural Gallery, Sonoma State University, CA. * 1990- The Red Shoes ( an Installation), Squiggle Performance and Installation Gallery, San Francisco, CA.Mar. 1 - 31 * 1983- Eye Dream Space, Sacramento, CA * 1981- Progressive Gallery, Sonoma State University, CA * 1980- Nicole's, Sacramento, CA * 1978- California State University, Sacramento, CA * 1974- Lorraine Garcia Exhibition, California State University, Sacramento, CA * 2013- If Gender Is A Kind of Doing, Lorraine Garc\u00eda-Nakata, Regina Jos\u00e9 Galindo, Deborah Roberts, Rye Purvis, Laura Luc\u00eda Sanz, Ana Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez, Elizabeth Maynard, Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts, San Francisco.
