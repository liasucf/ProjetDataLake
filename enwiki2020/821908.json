    "text": "Dirk Franciscus \"Danny\" Blind (; born 1 August 1961) is a former Dutch international football player. He played as a defender for Sparta Rotterdam, Ajax and the Netherlands national team. He is one of only two Dutch players, together with Arnold M\u00fchren, to have won all UEFA club competitions and the Intercontinental Cup. ==Playing career== ===Club career=== Blind made his professional football debut on 29 August 1979 with Sparta Rotterdam. He stayed under contract with Sparta for seven seasons when in July 1986 he transferred to Ajax, attracted there by manager Johan Cruyff. Blind's signing, however, was much to the chagrin of Ajax superstar Marco van Basten, who was upset that his manager had brought in a relatively unknown, defensive player from a fairly small club like Sparta, instead of splashing out on a big-money, big- name transfer.Danny Blind returns to Ajax World Cup Blog, 7 May 2008 With Ajax, Blind amassed an impressive trophy list, winning all three European trophies (UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1987, the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995). He also secured the Intercontinental Cup in 1995 against Brazil's Gr\u00eamio by scoring the winning penalty in the penalty shoot- out. Blind was again a penalty hero when he converted twice against Real Zaragoza in the European Super Cup Final of 1995, which Ajax won 5\u20131 over the two legs. The two penalties Blind converted were in the 65th and 69th minutes of the second leg. Domestically, with Ajax, he won five Dutch Eredivisie Championships and four national cups. He retired on 16 May 1999. Blind was known for being a solid, dependable defender and a leader on the field. However, he was also a technically gifted and cultured player who could pass and strike the ball well for a non-attacking player. Whilst famous for being a centre back, Blind started his career as a right full-back. ===International career=== Blind gained 42 caps for the Netherlands over a ten-year period, scoring once against Greece in a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifier. He made his debut in 1986 against Scotland but was not capped at all in 1987 or 1988, an absence which meant he missed being a part of the triumphant UEFA Euro 1988 side. He did, however, appear at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups and the 1992 and 1996 European Championships, retiring after the latter. ==Management career== Blind was head coach at Ajax from 14 March 2005 (appointed as successor to Ronald Koeman) until 10 May 2006, after only 422 days in charge. He led Ajax to victory in the KNVB Cup and the Johan Cruyff Shield. In 2007\u201308, Blind became football director at his old club, Sparta Rotterdam. On 15 May 2008, he returned to Ajax to become the new football director in Amsterdam but switched roles when Martin Jol joined the club to assistant-trainer. Moving to the position of technical director for Ajax at the beginning of the 2011\u201312 season, on 9 February 2012 it was announced that Blind would retire from his duties as technical director at Ajax, concluding a heated dispute surrounding the club's board of directors.Ajax board including Johan Cruyff and Edgar Davids step down en masse The Guardian, 9 February 2012 On 1 July 2015, Blind was named Guus Hiddink's successor as manager of the Dutch national team. He failed to lead them to Euro 2016, and he put the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign at stake after more meagre results. He was sacked by the Dutch FA on 26 March 2017, the day after losing 2-0 away at Bulgaria, which left their chances of qualification in serious doubt. ==Personal life== Blind is the father of professional footballer Daley Blind, who played for Ajax from 2008 to 2014, and returned in 2018 after a 4-year stint with Manchester United. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performanceDanny Blind Level-KDirk Franciscus Blind \"Danny Blind\" World-Soccer.org ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
