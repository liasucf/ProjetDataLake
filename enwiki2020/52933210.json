    "text": "Gul\u00eestan, Land of Roses (French title: Gul\u00eestan, terre de roses) is a 2016 feature-length documentary film about women guerillas in a Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) Free Women's Unit, in combat against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, directed by Kurdish Montreal filmmaker Zayn\u00ea Akyol. Shot in Iraqi Kurdistan, the film is co-produced Montreal's P\u00e9riph\u00e9ria Productions, Germany's MitosFilm and the National Film Board of Canada. The film was conceived and named for a woman, Gul\u00eestan, who'd been a role model for the director in her adopted home in Montreal, until she left to fight with the PKK. Akyol went to Iraq in 2010 in an unsuccessful effort to find her and make a film about her. Unable to locate Gul\u00eestan, she did find women who knew her and the focus of the documentary shifted to telling Gul\u00eestan's story through their memories of her. But when she returned to Iraq to film in 2014, some of those women were now dead while others were in combat, and so the focus of the film shifted yet again, to documenting the experiences of women like Gul\u00eestan. ==Release and reception== The film had its World Premiere during Visions du R\u00e9el festival in 2016. The film had its Canadian premiere at the 2016 Hot Docs festival. In August 2016, it won the Doc Alliance Selection Award, presented by a collective of seven European documentary film festivals during Locarno Festival in Switzerland. In November 2016, the filmmaker received the award for Best New Talent from Quebec/Canada at the Rencontres internationales du documentaire de Montr\u00e9al. In January 2017, the film was nominated at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards for Best Feature Length Documentary and Best Editing in a Documentary. ==See also== *Peshmerga (2016 film), a documentary film ==References== ==External links== * * (NFB) Category:2016 films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:Documentary films about women in war Category:Films shot in Iraq Category:German documentary films Category:Iraqi Kurdistan Category:Kurdistan Workers' Party Category:National Film Board of Canada documentaries Category:Quebec films Category:2016 documentary films ",
