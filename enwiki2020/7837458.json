Between 1898-1900, Feyearts was one of the main people responsible for the development of water polo in Belgium, and in 1900, his club the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, traveled to Paris, France, to compete in the 1900 Summer Olympics, after beating French clubs in the first two rounds, his team met the Osbourne Swimming Club who were representing Great Britain in the final, but unfortunately in front of 5000 spectators they lost 2-7, so he won a silver medal. Feyearts was back at the Olympics eight years later competing for Belgium, at the 1908 Summer Olympics being held in London, in the first round Belgium beat the Netherlands 8-1, with Feyearts scoring six of those goals, in the next round they beat Sweden 8-4, with Feyearts scoring another point, so again they had reached the final and again they were against Great Britain, but again he had to settle for silver medal as they were beaten 2-9, Feyearts scored again and was the tournaments top scorer. Feyearts also competed in the 100 metre freestyle at the 1900 Summer Olympics, but failed to finish in the top two, so didn't qualify for the next round. Feyearts became a volunteer during World War I, but in 1917 he was severely wounded and ten years later died of those injuries in 1927. ==See also== * List of Olympic medalists in water polo ==References== ==External links== * Category:1880 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Belgian male swimmers Category:Belgian male water polo players Category:Olympic swimmers of Belgium Category:Olympic water polo players of Belgium Category:Olympic silver medalists for Belgium Category:Water polo players at the 1900 Summer Olympics Category:Water polo players at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in water polo Category:Medalists at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1900 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Brussels ",
