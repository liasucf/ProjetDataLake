Unlike members of Physonectae and Cystonectae, Calycophorans lack a pneumatophore (float) and only have a siphosome and a nectosome. In the nectosome are typically only one or two nectophores (swimming bells), except in Hippopodiidae which have many. The zooids in the siphosome repeat in a pattern, and each iteration is called a cormidium. Except for in Hippopodiidae, which lack them, each cormidium has a single hydrophyllium (protective bract). Occasionally the cormidia detach and become eudoxid (the sexual stage). Calycophoran colonies are monoecious, containing male and female zooids. ==References== ==Further reading== *Totton, Arthur Knyvett 1965. A Synopsis of the Siphonophora.
