Steam engines, train models and miniature trains were exhibited along with the story of world railway systems. == History == There was a large exhibition hall containing relics and was run by the Thai Railfan Club. There were numerous steam engines, and model and miniature trains on display. In the 1970s the building had been designated as a train museum but the official opening occurred much later, in 1990. The railway enthusiasts collated historic rolling stock and restored it before putting it on display. Due to dropping visitor numbers the museum was permanently closed on 23 October 2012.Richard Barrow: Railway Museum in Bangkok to Open for the Last Time Today. == Exhibits == Several types of wagons, two small steam locomotives by Kyosan Kogyo from 1949 and 1959The Last Steam Trains of Bangkok.
