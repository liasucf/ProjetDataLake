    "text": "The Vespa-Caproni armored car was an Italian military vehicle, designed by the aircraft manufacturer Caproni. Only one prototype was built, which was tested on February 2, 1942 at the Motor Study Center.[ \u0423\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u044f (Vespa Caproni)]. The vehicle never entered serial production. The initial idea was to equip the Italian army with an armored vehicle that is small, light, agile and fast. == Characteristics == The Vespa-Caproni was able to accommodate two crew. Its most striking characteristic was the position of the wheels, which were arranged in rhombus or lozenge configuration: one front and one rear wheel (like a motorcycle), and two central wheels, placed on the sides of the hull; basically a 1x2x1 configuration. This gave the vehicle a particularly small turning radius, useful for an armored car intended primarily for rapid exploration and reconnaissance. Vespa-Caproni had an 8 cylinders Lancia Astura 82 Horsepower engine, which could reach speeds of 86 km/h with operational range of 200 km on road. It was 3.90 meters long, 2 meters wide and 1.85 meters high. The weight was 3.4 tons, with 26 mm frontal armor and 14 mm side armor. Main armament was a 8mm Breda 38 machine gun.Italian Vehicles: Vespa- Caproni .h Le targhe e i veicoli dell'esercito italiano (PDF)].Nico Sgarlato: L'autoblindo Caproni Vespa, article published on Eserciti nella Storia (2008). == See also == * Leichter Panzersp\u00e4hwagen * Humber * BA-64 == Note == Category:Armoured cars of Italy Category:World War II armoured cars Category:World War II armoured fighting vehicles of Italy ",
