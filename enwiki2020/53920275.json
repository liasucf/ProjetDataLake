    "text": "Security vote in Nigeria is a monthly allowance that is allocated to the 36 states within the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the sole purpose of funding security services within such states. The monthly fund runs into billions of naira and vary based on the level of security required by the individual state. States such as Rivers State, who face security threats such as pipeline destructions and kidnapping, receive one of the largest security vote funds. Security votes have not been widely accepted by citizens, as most have claimed that such funds are being abused by the state governments, because how the funds are disbursed is not accountable to any agency. The state governments are advised to use their discretion in ways on how to spend the funds. == Security votes by states== ===SOUTH EAST=== Imo State: N333.333M Monthly (N4B Annually) Enugu State: N600M Monthly (N7.2B Annually) Anambra State: N850M Monthly (N10B Annually) Abia State: N700M Monthly (N8.4B Annually) *Ebonyi State: No Record Available SOUTH SOUTH: Cross River State: N500M Monthly (N6B Annually) Rivers State: N1.5B Monthly (N18B Annually) Akwa Ibom State: N1.8B Monthly (N21.6B Annually) Edo State: N900M Monthly (N10.8B Annually) Delta State: N2B Monthly (N24B Annually) *Bayelsa State: No Record Available === SOUTH WEST === Lagos State: N1.429B Monthly [N1.297B (Public order and safety) + N132.5M (Social Protection)] (N17.149B Annually [N15.559B + N1.59B]) Ondo State: N600M Monthly (N7.2B Annually) Osun State: N400M Monthly (N4.8B Annually) Ogun State: N80-N100M Monthly (N960M-N1.2B Annually) Ekiti State: N100M Monthly (N1.2B annually) === NORTH EAST === Borno State: N806.25M Monthly (N9.675B Annually) Yobe State: N316.667M Monthly (N3.8B Annually) Taraba State: N200M Monthly (N2.4B Annually) Bauchi State: N1.417B Monthly (N17B Annually) === NORTH WEST === Kano State: N0.00 Kaduna State: N400M Monthly [N175M (Security vote) + N225M (Security Vote (Preventive and Supportive) for the SSG's office)] N4.8B Annually [N2.1B + N2.7B] Katsina State: N17.583M Monthly (N211M Annually) Zamfara State: N600M Monthly (N7.2B Annually) === NORTH CENTRAL === Benue State: N3.092B allocation to personnel and overhead costs monthly which cover security vote, among others.
