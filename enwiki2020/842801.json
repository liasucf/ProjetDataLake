He has been called the father of the modern poster. ==Biography== L'Etendard Fran\u00e7ais, Ch\u00e9ret's 1891 poster for the bicycle shop on the Quai d'Orsay Born in Paris to a poor but creative family of artisans, Ch\u00e9ret had a very limited education. At age thirteen, he began a three-year apprenticeship with a lithographer and then his interest in painting led him to take an art course at the \u00c9cole Nationale de Dessin. Like most other fledgling artists, Ch\u00e9ret studied the techniques of various artists, past and present, by visiting Paris museums. From 1859 to 1866, he was trained in lithography in London, England, where he was strongly influenced by the British approach to poster design and printing. On returning to France, Ch\u00e9ret created vivid poster ads for the cabarets, music halls, and theaters such as the Eldorado, the Olympia, the Folies Berg\u00e8re, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra, the Alcazar d'\u00c9t\u00e9 and the Moulin Rouge. He created posters and illustrations for the satirical weekly Le Courrier fran\u00e7ais. His works were influenced by the scenes of frivolity depicted in the works of Rococo artists such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and Antoine Watteau. So much in demand was he, that he expanded his business to providing advertisements for the plays of touring troupes, municipal festivals, and then for beverages and liquors, perfumes, soaps, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Eventually he became a major advertising force, adding the railroad companies and a number of manufacturing businesses to his client list. As his work became more popular and his large posters displaying modestly free- spirited females found a larger audience, pundits began calling him the \"father of the women's liberation.\" Females had previously been depicted in art as prostitutes or puritans. The women of Ch\u00e9ret's posters, joyous, elegant and lively\u2014'Cherettes', as they were popularly called\u2014were neither. It was freeing for the women of Paris, and heralded a noticeably more open atmosphere in Paris where women were able to engage in formerly taboo activities, such as wearing low-cut bodices and smoking in public. These 'Cherettes' were widely seen and recognised, and a writer of the time said \"It is difficult to conceive of Paris without its 'Cher\u00e9ts' (sic).\"History and Development of Advertising 1929, page 496 In 1895, Ch\u00e9ret created the Ma\u00eetres de l'Affiche collection, a significant art publication of smaller sized reproductions featuring the best works of ninety-seven Parisian artists. His success inspired an industry that saw the emergence of a new generation of poster designers and painters such as Charles Gesmar and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. One of his students was Georges de Feure. In his old age Ch\u00e9ret retired to the pleasant climate of the French Riviera at Nice. He died in 1932 at the age of ninety-six and was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre quarter of Paris. He was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by the French Government in 1890 for his outstanding contributions to the graphic arts. Although his paintings earned him a certain respect, it was his work creating advertising posters, taken on just to pay his bills but eventually his dedication, for which he is remembered today. In 1933 he was honoured with a posthumous exhibition of his work at the prestigious Salon d'Automne in Paris. Over the years, Ch\u00e9ret's posters became much sought after by collectors from around the world. ==Selected works== File:Cheret, Jules - Les Palais de Glace.jpg|Palais des Glaces File:Cheret, Jules - Les Saxoleine.jpg|Saxol\u00e9ine, P\u00e9trole de suret\u00e9 File:Cheret, Jules - Taverne Olympia (pl 217).jpg|Taverne Olympia, Restaurant File:Cheret, Jules - Pippermint (pl 213).jpg|Pippermint, Get Fr\u00e8res File:Cheret, Jules - Pan (pl 81).jpg|Pan, a Journal of Satire File:Cheret, Jules - Carnivale Poster.jpg|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra, Carnaval 1894 File:Cheret, Jules - Paris Courses (pl 61).jpg|Hippodrome de la Porte Maillot, Paris Courses File:Cheret, Jules - L\u00b4Amant des Danseuses (pl 45).jpg|L'Amant des Danseuses Roman Moderniste par F\u00e9licien Champsaur File:Cheret, Jules - Emilienne d\u00b4Alencon (pl 113).jpg|Folies Berg\u00e8res, \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on File:Cheret, Jules - Concert des Ambassadeurs (pl 165).jpg|Concert des Ambassadeurs, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es File:Cheret, Jules - Le Pays des Fees (pl 181).jpg|Exposition Universelle 1889, Le Pays des Fe\u00e9s File:Cheret, Jules - Casino d\u00b4Enghien (pl 129).jpg|Casino d'Enghien File:Cheret, Jules - L\u00b4Aureole du Midi (pl 233).jpg|L\u00b4Aureole du Midi, P\u00e9trole de suret\u00e9 File:Cheret, Jules - Eau des Sirenes (pl 153).jpg|Recoloration des Cheveux par l'Eau des Sir\u00e8nes ==See also== * Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice * Poster ==References== ==External links== * Poster Gallery * Father of modern poster * Jules-Cheret.org Hundreds of works by Jules Ch\u00e9ret *, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Ch\u00e9ret (pp. 10, 93, 111, 146, 148, 149, 150, 203, 204, 126) * High Res Images of Jules Ch\u00e9ret available for download Category:1836 births Category:1932 deaths Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French poster artists Category:French lithographers Category:Art Nouveau painters Category:Art Nouveau illustrators Category:Artists from Paris Category:20th-century French printmakers ",
