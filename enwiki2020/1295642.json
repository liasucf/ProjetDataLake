    "text": "Somerville is a small lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Moon. It lies to the east of the prominent crater Langrenus, and was designated Langrenus J before being given a name by the IAU. This is a roughly circular, bowl-shaped formation, with the larger but less conspicuous Langrenus H attached to the northwest rim. The rim has a protruding lip that extends slightly toward the southwest. This is one of a handful of lunar craters named after a woman, Mary Somerville. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
