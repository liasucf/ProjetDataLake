    "text": "The 1981 Grand National was the 135th renewal of the Grand National horse race that took place at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England, on 4 April 1981. It is remembered for the winning horse Aldaniti, who had recovered from chronic leg problems, and his jockey Bob Champion, who had recovered from cancer. Aldaniti's injuries dated back to 1976, while Champion had been diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1979. However, Aldaniti was nursed back to optimum form ahead of the race, and Champion overcame lengthy hospitalisation and chemotherapy to win the National by a distance of four lengths. In second place was the 8/1 favourite, Spartan Missile, ridden by 54-year-old amateur jockey and grandfather John Thorne. The story of Bob Champion and Aldaniti was made into a film Champions, with John Hurt portraying Champion. The film is based on Champion's book Champion's Story, which he co-wrote with close friend and racing journalist and broadcaster Jonathan Powell. ==Finishing order== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Position !Horse !Jockey !Age !Handicap (st-lb) !SP !Distance |- |01 |Aldaniti |Bob Champion |11 |10-13 |10/1 |4 lengths |- |02 |Spartan Missile |John Thorne |9 |11-5 |8/1 F | |- |03 |Royal Mail |Philip Blacker |11 |11-7 |16/1 | |- |04 |Three To One |Geordie Dun |10 |10-3 |33/1 | |- |05 |Senator Maclacury |John Burke |7 |10-12 |20/1 | |- |06 |Royal Exile |Ben De Haan |12 |10-0 |16/1 | |- |07 |Rubstic |Maurice Barnes |12 |10-7 |11/1 | |- |08 |Coolishall |Bill Smith |12 |10-3 |25/1 | |- |09 |Rathlek |Paul Barton |11 |10-1 |50/1 | |- |10 |So |John Francome |12 |10-8 |40/1 | |- |11 |Sebastian V |Ridley Lamb |13 |10-2 |33/1 | |- |12 |Cheers |Peter Scudamore |9 |10-0 |20/1 |Last to finish |} ==Non-finishers== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Fence !Horse !Jockey !Age !Weight (st-lb) !SP !Fate |- |01 |Another Captain |Colin Hawkins |9 |10-0 |40/1 |Fell |- |01 |Barney Maclyvie |Martin Lynch |10 |10-8 |33/1 |Unseated rider |- |04 |Bryan Boru |John Carden |10 |10-0 |100/1 |Refused |- |04 |Delmoss |Frank Berry |11 |10-1 |50/1 |Fell |- |04 |Kilkilwell |Niall Madden |9 |10-6 |33/1 |Refused |- |06 (Becher's Brook) |Chumson |Aiden O'Connell |10 |11-7 |50/1 |Fell |- |08 (Canal Turn) |Another Prospect |Jim Wilson |9 |10-8 |40/1 |Fell |- |09 (Valentine's) |Drumroan |Marcus Graffe |13 |10-6 |50/1 |Unseated rider |- |09 (Valentine's) |No Gypsy |John Suthern |12 |10-0 |100/1 |Fell |- |10 |Carrow Boy |Gerry Newman |9 |11-6 |33/1 |Fell |- |10 |Kininvie |Philip Hobbs |12 |10-0 |100/1 |Unseated rider |- |11 (open ditch) |Tenecoon |Charlie Mann (jockey)|Charlie Mann |12 |10-0 |100/1 |Unseated rider |- |13 |Lord Gulliver |Colin Brown |8 |10-0 |50/1 |Fell |- |15 (The Chair) |Dromore |Peter Duggan |13 |10-8 |100/1 |Refused |- |17 |Kylogue Lady |Richard Quinn |9 |10-0 |100/1 |Fell |- |19 (open ditch) |Deiopea |Linda Sheedy |10 |10-0 |100/1 |Refused |- |19 (open ditch) |Son and Heir |Sam Morshead |11 |10-0 |100/1 |Refused |- |19 (open ditch) |The Vintner |Chris Grant |10 |10-8 |20/1 |Refused |- |20 |Royal Stuart |Hywel Davies |10 |10-2 |16/1 |Unseated rider |- |22 (Becher's Brook) |Pacify |Steve Jobar |11 |10-0 |50/1 |Fell |- |22 (Becher's Brook) |Zongalero |Steve Smith-Eccles |11 |10-11 |14/1 |Fell |- |24 (Canal Turn) |Three Of Diamonds |Paul Leach |9 |10-4 |100/1 |Fell |- |26 |Might Be |Anthony Webber |10 |10-0 |50/1 |Fell |- |27 (open ditch) |Choral Festival |Marcus Low |10 |10-2 |66/1 |Unseated rider |- |27 (open ditch) |Martinstown |Malcolm Batters |9 |10-7 |33/1 |Unseated rider |- |27 (open ditch) |My Friendly Cousin |Alan Brown |11 |10-2 |100/1 |Pulled up |- |28 |Casamayor |Paul Webber |11 |10-6 |100/1 |Refused |} The Grand National : the history of the Aintree spectacular, by Stewart Peters & Bernard Parkin, ==References== ==External links== * 1981 Grand National Grand National Grand National Category:20th century in Merseyside ",
