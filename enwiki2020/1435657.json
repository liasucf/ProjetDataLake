    "text": "Early peoples and kingdoms of Ireland, c.800 Aidhne, also known as U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhni, Mag nAidni, later Maigh Aidhne (\"Plain (of) Aidhne\"), was the territory of the U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhni, a t\u00faath (tribal kingdom) located in the south of what is now County Galway in the south of Connacht, Ireland. (Aidhne is nominative case, Aidhni genitive). Aidhne is coextensive with the present diocese of Kilmacduagh. The territory of Aidhne is bounded on the west by Loch Lurgan (Galway Bay) and the barony of Burren in County Clare in the province of Munster. County Clare also bounds Aidhne on its south and south- east side. Aidhne is bounded on the east by the low mountains of Sliabh Echtghe / Slieve Aughty (modern Sliabh Eachta\u00ed), which separate U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhni from the territory of U\u00ed Maine (modern U\u00ed Mhaine) in eastern County Galway. On the north-east Aidhne is bounded by the plains of U\u00ed Mhaine and on the north by Mag Mucruime (modern M\u00e1 Mucraimhe, the area around Athenry). On the north-west Aidhne is bounded by the parish of Meara\u00ed (earlier Medraige, Meadhraighe) / Maree (Ballynacourty, Baile na C\u00fairte) which is in the territory of U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Seola (modern U\u00ed Bhriain Seola). In placename lore the kingdom took its name from the mythological Aidhne, one of the ten daughters of Parthol\u00f3n by his first wife, Topha. Aidhne was married to Breac. In a later age, a branch of the Fir Bolg made Aidhne their home. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Book of Genealogies states that the Tuath mhac nUmh\u00f3ir[settled in]in D\u00e1l gCais and in U\u00ed Fhiachrach of Aidhne. Their leader is given as Conall Caol, son of Aonghus mac \u00damh\u00f3r. Conall was killed at the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe in 195 AD, and his body brought back to Aidhne where it was interred at a leacht called Carn Chonaill (itself the site of a major battle some centuries later). The territory of U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhni is coextensive with the diocese of Cill Mhic Dhuach / Kilmacduagh, which contains the civil parishes of Kinvarradoorus, Killinny, Killeenavarra, Drumacoo, Kilcolgan, Ardrahan, Stradbally, Killeeneen, Killeely, Killora, Killogilleen, Kilchreest, Isertkelly, Killinan, Kilthomas, Kilbeacanty, Beagh, Kilmacduagh, Kiltartan. The diocese of Kilmacduagh contains the present Catholic parishes of Kinvara, Ballinderreen, Gort, Ardrahan, Craughwell, Beagh, Kilbeacanty, Kilthomas (Peterswell), Clarinbridge, Kilchreest. ==Annalistic references== * M938.13.Aralt, grandson of Imhar, i.e. the son of Sitric, lord of the foreigners of Luimneach, was killed in Connaught by the Caenraighi of Aidhne. * M1033.9 - A conflict between the Eli and the Ui-Fiachrach Aidhne, in which Braen Ua Cleirigh and Muireadhach Mac Gillaphadraig, with many others, were slain. ==External links== * http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005B/index.html Category:Ui Fiachrach Category:Fir Bolg Category:Cycles of the Kings Category:Irish texts Category:History of County Galway Category:Kingdoms of ancient Ireland ",
