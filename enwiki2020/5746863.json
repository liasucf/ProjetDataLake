    "text": "Erwin Pr\u00f6ll Erwin Pr\u00f6ll (born 24 December 1946, in Ziersdorf-Radlbrunn), is an Austrian conservative politician (\u00d6VP). From 1992 to 2017, he was the Governor of Lower Austria. He was born in Radlbrunn, Lower Austria and after obtaining his Matura at Tulln he studied at the University of Natural Resources (BOKU), Vienna. == Political life == The transfer of the regional administration of Lower Austria from Vienna to Sankt P\u00f6lten took place during his administration. Pr\u00f6ll is seen as a supporter of a Grand Coalition between the \u00d6VP and Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6). In the year 2000 he was still a supporter of the \"black-blue\" coalition (\u00d6VP with the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6)), but two years later argued against such an arrangement. Pr\u00f6ll also has a good relationship with Viennese mayor Michael H\u00e4upl (SP\u00d6). Great interest was aroused in Europe when he proposed a tax on mobile phone masts in the state of Lower Austria. Together with the SP\u00d6 he suggested legally regulating mobile phone transmitters, with the aim of reducing the overall number. At the same time the state planned to set up a local telecommunications infrastructure by means of a Wireless LAN. After an agreement with the mobile radio companies, the taxation was not realized. The agreement in fact was used as an example for other regions. In 2006 he hosted a conference with EU politicians over subsidiarity in Sankt P\u00f6lten. Pr\u00f6ll is married with four children. He is the uncle of Josef Pr\u00f6ll, former Austrian Vice Chancellor and Minister of Finance. The magazine Falter in 2002 reported the response by regional party secretary Ernst Strasser to criticism of Pr\u00f6ll's confession that he had only ever managed to finish one book, Karl May's cowboy novel Der Schatz im Silbersee (The Treasure of Silver Lake): \"People like that, at least it shows the governor isn't a know-all.\"Gerald John and Nina Weissensteiner, \"Hohe Stirn, flaches Land\", Falter, 28 August 2002 In September 2014, in an interview with the newspaper Kurier, he denied any interest in being a candidate for the Presidential election due in 2016, saying the idea left him cold: \"My life plan is different\".http://kurier.at/politik/inland/hofburg-proell-will-nicht- bei-bundespraesidentenwahl-kandidieren/83.888.024 Reports in April 2015, however, suggested that he had sounded out the idea with his staff.http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/kulisse/4710280/Wenn- Proll-Bundespraesident-werden-will-will-auch-die-OVP == References == == External links == * * Erwin Pr\u00f6ll at the website of the Lower Austrian Government * An article about Erwin Pr\u00f6ll at the Austrian Lexikon of AEIOU Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of Lower Austria (after 1918) Category:Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna alumni ",
