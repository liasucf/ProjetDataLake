    "text": "Bad Boy is an American rock band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The band originally formed under the name Crossfire, and released one single under that name in 1975, until they changed their name to Bad Boy after signing to United Artists in 1977. The group released their first two albums, The Band that Milwaukee Made Famous and Back to Back on United Artists in 1977 and 1978. After being dropped from United Artists, the band released Private Party on the Streetwise label in 1981, followed by self-releasing the Electric Eyes album in 1984. The band broke up sometime in the late 1980s, and reformed in 1998 to release a greatest hits compilation on Surgeland Records. In 2002, the band reformed a second time. Since their 2002 reformation, they have released one studio album and one live album on the Legend label, and continue to perform as a regional act in the American Midwest. The British label Rock Candy reissued their first two albums in 2018. == Discography == === As Crossfire=== * \"I Gotta Move\" / \"Why Keep Me Waiting\" (1975, Real To Reel) (single) === As Bad Boy === * The Band That Milwaukee Made Famous (1977, United Artists) * Back to Back (1978, United Artists) * Private Party (1981, Streetwise) * Electric Eyes (1984, self-released) * Girl On The Run (1985, Legend) * Best Of Bad Boy (1998, Surgeland) * We Should Have Been Dead By Now (2003, Legend) * Live Northern Lights (2005, Legend) (live album) == Members == === Current === * Steve Grimm- Guitar and vocals * Randall \"Xeno\" Hogan- Guitar and vocals * Craig Evans- Bass * Scott Berendt- Drums === Past === * Joe Luchessi- Guitar * John Marcelli- Bass * Lars Hansen- Drums * Ted Mueller- Drums * Joey La Vie- Guitar * Kelly Peterson- Guitar ==References== == External links == * Official Facebook page * Steve Grimm official website Category:American rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in the 1970s Category:Musical groups disestablished in the 1980s Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Musical groups established in 2002 ",
