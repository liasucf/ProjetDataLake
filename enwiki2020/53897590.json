She played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels and South Carolina Gamecocks. After she was selected 4th overall by the Wings in the 2017 WNBA Draft, Gray quickly wowed her fans, winning the WNBA Rookie of the Year award, and also there to lend her team a hand as they went into the playoffs. ==High School career== She was a member of the U18 USA Basketball National Team as well as the 3-on-3 National Team. Named 3A state player of the year three times. She Led Washington County to a three-year record of 88-4 that included a perfect 32-0 record and a 3A state championship in 2010-11. As a junior, Gray averaged 32.0 points and 8.5 rebounds en route to a state runner-up finish. She then missed most of her senior season with a knee injury ==College career== Heavily recruited by power programs, she was ranked the 7th overall player as part of a high profile 2013 recruiting class. After receiving offers from Maryland, Kentucky, South Carolina, etc., she eventually chose to attend North Carolina to play for Coach Sylvia Hatchell. After two years in Chapel Hill, Gray shockingly announced that she would be transferring. It was then reported that her reason for transferring was due to UNC's athletic-academic scandal. In May 2015, it was announced that Gray had transferred to South Carolina to play for Dawn Staley. Gray eventually won a National Championship in her first season of eligibility. ===North Carolina and South Carolina statistics=== Source {| class=\"wikitable\" |Year |Team |GP |Points |FG% |3P% |FT% |RPG |APG |SPG |BPG |PPG |- |2013-14 |North Carolina |36 |501 |48.1% |41.8% |73.6% |5.5 |1.3 |1.4 |0.4 |13.9 |- |2014-15 |North Carolina |35 |552 |45.2% |30.9% |70.7% |7.6 |2.2 |1.3 |0.6 |15.8 |- |2015-16 |South Carolina | colspan=\"10\" |redshirt |- |2016-17 |South Carolina |37 |487 |51.0% |31.6% |73.5% |5.0 |2.5 |1.3 |0.6 |13.2 |- |Career | |108 |1540 |47.9% |34.8% |72.3% |6.0 |2.0 |1.4 |0.6 |14.3 |} ==Professional career== ===WNBA=== After helping lead South Carolina to the NCAA Championship, Gray opted to enter the 2017 WNBA Draft.

She was drafted 4th overall by the Dallas Wings placing her in the city where she won a national title two weeks prior, and eventually pairing her with South Carolina teammate, Kaela Davis, who was selected 10th.
