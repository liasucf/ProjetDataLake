    "text": "Archbishop Stepinac High School is an all-boys Roman Catholic high school in White Plains, New York, United States. It was operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York until the 2009\u20132010 school year, when it became independent. It was founded in 1948 and named for Aloysius Stepinac, the Archbishop of Zagreb in Croatia, which was then part of Yugoslavia. In 1952, Stepinac was appointed a cardinal by Pope Pius XII. == History == Archbishop Stepinac High School opened in 1948 with a capacity of 1,360 students. It began with freshman and sophomore years and reached its full complement in 1950. The school was established subsequent to fundraising by the Catholic parishes of Westchester County, under the leadership of Cardinal Francis Spellman, the Archbishop of New York, and the educational officials of the Archdiocese. The initial purpose of the school was to establish a full educational program with a diversity of subject choices leading to a well- rounded student. In addition to the college preparatory program it offered a general course for boys who wanted to finish their education with high school and enter a trade. Boys were taught by an all-male faculty, almost entirely religious in makeup. In its early years the administration of the school was in the hands of diocesan priests, assisted by religious brothers and an occasional layman. Students from the school were used as extras in the 1972 film Child's Play directed by Sidney Lumet. In many sports, Stepinac has many rival schools that include Iona Prep, Fordham Prep, Holy Cross, St. Francis Prep, Holy Trinity, St. Anthony's, Chaminade, Monsignor Farrell and White Plains High School (the now defunct annual post-season football \"Turkey Bowl\" on Thanksgiving Day). Fr. John O'Keefe, president of Archbishop Stepinac from 1992 to 2004, was permanently removed from ministry in 2016 because of allegations of sexual abuse of a minor. O'Keefe's suspension was announced in a December 16, 2015, letter to parishioners from New York's archbishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who called the allegation \"credible.\" == Demographics == ===Race=== The high school is 8.5% Asian, 12.5% Black, 14% Hispanic, 60% White and 5% other. == Program == The current administration and faculty of Stepinac is a mix of priests and lay men and women.

The school offers a college prep program, an honors program offering 22 AP classes, and starting in the 2016\u20132017 school year, an honors academy designed to give students a head start in their respective field.
