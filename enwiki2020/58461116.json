    "text": "Sodium hydrogenoxalate is the sodium salt of hydrogenoxalate. The only difference from oxalic acid is that one of the two hydrogen atoms has been replaced with a sodium atom. Like oxalate, it is toxic for the kidney function if swallowed because of the precipitation of poorly soluble calcium oxalate stones that can obstruct the kidney tubules. ==Stability== Upon being heated, sodium hydrogenoxalate undergoes cation-pairing to become oxalic acid and sodium oxalate, the latter of which decomposes into sodium carbonate and carbon monoxide. :2 \u2192 + : \u2192 + ==References== Category:Organic sodium salts Category:Oxalates Category:Carboxylate anions ",
