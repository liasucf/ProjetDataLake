When she was ten, she did not went through the entrance exam to Paris Opera Ballet School.

In 2005, at age 15, Baulac finally entered Paris Opera Ballet School as a paying student. ==Career== In 2008, Baulac joined the Paris Opera Ballet's corps de ballet. She only had a handful of opportunities during her first few years in the company. She also danced with Samuel Murez's 3e \u00e9tage. In 2014, when she was considering leaving the company, she was promoted to coryph\u00e9e. She was trained by Aur\u00e9lie Dupont for her coryph\u00e9e exam. Benjamin Millepied became the artistic director later that year, and Baulac was immediately casted in The Nutcracker. She was promoted to sujet in 2015 and premi\u00e8re danseuse a year later. In 2016, Baulac was assigned to understudy Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, and replaced an injured dancer on 31 December. After her performance, Dupont, now the artistic director, promoted Baulac to \u00e9toile on stage. She has danced roles such as Kitri in Don Quixote, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and The Sylph in La Sylphide.
