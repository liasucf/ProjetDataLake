    "text": "A Different Kind of Human (Step 2) is the second studio album by Norwegian singer-songwriter and record producer Aurora. It was released on 7 June 2019 through Decca Records and Glassnote Records. It succeeds the album's first and previous chapter Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1), which was released in September 2018. ==Background== On the same day of the release of Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1), Aurora confirmed in an interview with NME that Step 2 would be released either in 2019 or 2020. Months later, Aurora posted a photo which seems to be an alien invasion with a text that said \"Something is coming in 2019\" in Morse code, which hinted that Step 2 would be set to be released in 2019. On 24 December 2018, Aurora announced in an interview for Bergen Tindende that Step 2 is coming faster than expected, most likely because she and Magnus Skylstad had been in the studio for a very long time. The album's first single, \"Animal\", was released on 24 January 2019. On 18 February 2019, Aurora announced that the title would not be under the assumed title of Infections of a Different Kind (Step 2), and it would have a different name. \"It's kind of what I would hope for the music to do to us\", Aurora said about Step 2s title. On 12 March 2019, in an interview on B-Sides On-Air, Aurora confirmed Step 2 has already been recorded since November 2018. Then in the end of March, \"The Seed\" was confirmed to be the second single from the project. Following the announcement, the album title and track list were revealed on 4 April 2019. On 10 May 2019, the song \"The River\" was released as the album's third single. It was followed by the promotional single \"A Different Kind of Human\", released on 31 May 2019. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream publications, A Different Kind of Human (Step 2) received an average score of 77, based on 7 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". ==Track listing== Note: Track listing and credits adapted from Apple Music metadata.
