It was established in 1909, making it one of Europe's oldest national parks. Following a land extension in 1989, it now covers . The mountainous area is filled with large boulders, intersected by streaming lakes. Trailing around the mountain area is also a widespread forest area. The park is noted for the animals living in it: a resident bear tribe, and a large elk tribe. Other animals are also common, including wolves and lynx. == Etymology == The national park is named after the mountain Sonfj\u00e4llet which reaches above sea level. The exact meaning of the word son in this context is not known. It may be related to the Old West Norse word sunna, meaning Sun, and Sonfj\u00e4llet would thus literally mean \"the sun fell\". This theory has however been disputed and claimed to be inconsistent with the local pronunciation.Svenskt ortnamnslexikon, SOFI 2003 From 1919 to 2010, the name was officially spelled as S\u00e5nfj\u00e4llet, which the governing body thought better represented the pronunciation, however in June 2010, the official spelling was reverted to Sonfj\u00e4llet. == References == == External links == * * Sweden's National Parks: S\u00e5nfj\u00e4llet National Park from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency Category:National parks of Sweden Category:Protected areas established in 1909 Category:1909 establishments in Sweden Category:Geography of J\u00e4mtland County Category:Tourist attractions in J\u00e4mtland County ",
