    "text": "Concise presentation of Mesa Yitonia Mesa Geitonia () is a municipality of Cyprus, located in the district of Limassol, 2 km north of the city center. Although it is the smallest municipality in Cyprus in respect of its size, it is not in any aspect the least important. Having as its emblem the Medieval Cistern, which for centuries has represented the water and life, Mesa Yitonia Municipality is a vivid and full of life place. The voices of the children are spread all around the traditional tiled center of the municipality, taking the visitor on a romantic trip back to the old stone built village which existed before this area became an extension of Limassol city. == References == Category:Municipalities in Limassol District ",
