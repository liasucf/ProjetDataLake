    "text": "The 1992 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 110th season in Major League Baseball, their 35th season in San Francisco since their move from New York following the 1957 season, and their 33rd at Candlestick Park. The team finished in fifth place in the National League West with a record of 72 wins and 90 losses. This year, Giants owner Bob Lurie agreed in principle to sell his team to a Tampa Bay-based group of investors led by Vince Naimoli, who would then move the team to St. Petersburg. However, in November 1992, National League owners nixed the move under pressure from San Francisco officials, and the Giants were sold to a group that kept them in San Francisco. ==Offseason== * December 11, 1991: Kevin Mitchell was traded by the San Francisco Giants with Mike Remlinger to the Seattle Mariners for Bill Swift, Mike Jackson, and Dave Burba.Kevin Mitchell Statistics Baseball- Reference.com *January 13, 1992: Cory Snyder was signed as a Free Agent with the San Francisco Giants.Cory Snyder Statistics Baseball-Reference.com * January 30, 1992: Steve Lake was signed as a Free Agent with the San Francisco Giants.Steve Lake Statistics Baseball-Reference.com ==Regular season== ===Opening Day starters=== ===Season standings=== ===Record vs. opponents=== ===Notable transactions=== *April 2, 1992: Steve Lake was released by the San Francisco Giants. *June 1, 1992: Marvin Benard was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 50th round of the 1992 amateur draft.
