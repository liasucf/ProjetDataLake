Provincial corps were regiments with both British and Loyalist forces. ==Officers== * Colonel John Hamilton * Colonel/Captain John Leggett: One of the most prominent Loyalists was John Leggett, a rich planter in Bladen County. He organized and led one of the few loyalist brigades in the South (the North Carolina Volunteers, later known as the Royal North Carolina Regiment). After the war, Colonel Leggett and some of his men moved to Nova Scotia; the British gave them free land grants in County Harbour as compensation for their losses in the colony. The great majority of Loyalists remained in North Carolina and became citizens of the new nation.Carole Watterson Troxler, \"'The Great Man of the Settlement': North Carolina's John Leggett At Country Harbour, Nova Scotia, 1783\u20131812,\" North Carolina Historical Review, July 1990, Vol. 67 Issue 3, pp. 285\u2013314 * Daniel McLean * Lieutenant McCraw * Lieutenant Campbell * Ensign John Shaw Gent * Adjutant Roderick McLeod * Ensign Charles Atkins ==Known engagements== *June 20, 1779 \u2013 Battle of Stono Ferry, South Carolina *March 29 \u2013 May 12, 1780 \u2013 Siege of Charleston, South Carolina *August 6, 1780 \u2013 Battle of Hanging Rock, South Carolina *August 16, 1780 \u2013 Battle of Camden, South Carolina *May 7, 1781 \u2013 Halifax, North Carolina *August 2, 1781 \u2013 Rockfish, North Carolina *August 19, 1781 \u2013 New Bern, North Carolina ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * , NCHR 67 * * * Category:Loyalist military units in the American Revolution ",
