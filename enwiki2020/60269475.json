    "text": "Emil Hoffmann Reif (born March 5, 1998), better known as Magisk (formerly Magiskb0Y), is a Danish professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player for Astralis. He has won 3 majors in a row, a record tied with only his teammates, and also 3 in total. == Career == === 2015/2016 === Magisk started his career floating around low-level Danish teams, before joining SK Gaming along with Andreas \"MODDII\" Fridh, Asger \"AcilioN\" Larsen, Michael \"Friis\" J\u00f8rgensen, and Casper \"cadiaN\" M\u00f8ller. The team was not very successful together, however, and the roster was soon dropped in favour of the Brazilian Luminosity Gaming. Magisk eventually transferred to Dignitas, replacing Jesper \"TENZKI\" Plougmann, and joining Mathias \"MSL\" Lauridsen, Kristian \"k0nfig\" Wienecke, Ren\u00e9 \"cajunb\" Borg, and Ruben \"RUBINO\" Villarroel. The team found moderate success, culminating at a win at EPICENTER 2016. Magisk won an EVP at the event, and ended up on the HLTV top 20 players of the year, being nominated for 14th place. === 2017 === In early 2017, Dignitas was signed by F.C. Copenhagen in a new team known as North. After signing aizy in place of RUBINO, the team would struggle to find success. In July, North elected to replace Magisk with Valdemar \"valde\" Bj\u00f8rn Vangs\u00e5 as the former's form declined after the addition of aizy and ensuing change of roles within the team. Magisk joined OpTic's new European roster, which was formed off of other benched players from European rosters. === 2018/2019 === Optic found little success, and in early January, Magisk was signed by Denmark's #1 team at that time, Astralis. Despite some question marks at first, Magisk turned out to be the player Astralis needed for success. Astralis went on to win 12 events in 2018 and early 2019, including 2 majors and the Intel Grand Slam, and following this, many people described Astralis as the greatest CS:GO team of all time. For Magisk, who was the 3rd best player on Astralis, 2018 was another very good individual year, and he received the 7th spot on HLTV's top 20. Magisk became the 14th major MVP from HLTV at the IEM Katowice 2019 Major. == Individual awards == *MVP of BLAST Pro Series: Lisbon 2018 *MVP of IEM Katowice Major 2019 *HLTV Top 20 Players: 14th (2016), 7th (2018), 5th (2019) == References == Category:Astralis players Category:Counter-Strike players Category:Danish esports players Category:1998 births Category:Living people ",
