Most of his professional life he spent in Scotland at the courts of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her son James VI. While in Scotland, he was embroiled in marriage projects and several upheavals. In 1568-1569 he was sent on a special embassy to Russia, visiting the court of Ivan the Terrible. Randolph was also a Member of Parliament: for New Romney in 1558, Maidstone 1584, 1586 and 1589, Grantham 1559 and St Ives 1558 and 1572. ==Exile in France== Thomas Randolph was born in 1523, the son of Avery Randolph of Badlesmere, Kent. He entered Christ Church, Oxford at the time of its foundation, and graduated B.A. in October 1545, and B.C.L. in 1548. Shortly afterwards he became a public notary; and in 1549 he was made principal of Broadgates Hall (now Pembroke College), Oxford. He continued there until 1553, when the Protestant persecutions under Queen Mary compelled him to resign and retire to France. Sir James Melville refers to Randolph's indebtedness to him \"during his banishment in France\"; Randolph seems to have mainly resided in Paris, where he was still living as a scholar in April 1557. It was probably during his stay in Paris that he came under the influence of George Buchanan, to whom, in a letter to Peter Young, tutor of James VI, he refers in very eulogistic terms as his 'master'. Among his fellow-students and intimates in Paris was Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange. ==In the service of Elizabeth I== Soon after the accession of Elizabeth, in 1558, Randolph was acting as an agent of the English government in Germany, but in a few months returned to England; and, probably soon afterwards, bought a farm in Kent--\"the house where he was born\". Doubtless his acquaintance with the Scottish Protestants in Paris suggested to Elizabeth the employment of Randolph in the task of bringing the Earl of Arran, who had been compelled to flee from France, from Geneva to England. ===In Scotland=== Under the name of Barnabie, and using the codename Pamphilus he was also sent in the autumn of 1559 to secretly conduct James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran into Scotland.'Zurich Letters', (1842), 56-57 citings Forbes, 'Full View', ii,(1740) He left for London on 25 November, but was again sent to Scotland in March 1560, where his representations had considerable influence in encouraging the Protestants against the queen-regent, and in effecting an understanding between them and Elizabeth. The success of his mission suggested his continuance in Scotland as the confidential agent of Elizabeth; but being an ardent Protestant, he was as well a representative of William Cecil, Elizabeth's secretary of state, as of the Queen. Although by no means a match for Maitland of Lethington as a diplomatist, the fact that he possessed the confidence of the Protestant party enabled him to exercise no small influence in Scottish politics. His numerous letters are among the most valuable sources of information for this period; they abound in interesting details regarding the Queen of Scots and her court, and the political plots and social intrigues.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5, (1907), 375, sums up his Scottish career. Mary, Queen of Scots, c.1558-1560 In the autumn of 1562 Randolph accompanied the Queen of Scots, who meanwhile professed for him a warm friendship, in the expedition to the north of Scotland which resulted in the defeat and death of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly; and he even took part in the campaign, \"being ashamed to sit still where so many were occupied\". In January 1563 he went to Castle Campbell in Fife to the wedding of James Stewart, Commendator of Inchcolm and Margaret Campbell. Randolph had hoped to meet James MacConnel at the wedding.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1603, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 678. ===Marriage negotiations with Mary, Queen of Scots=== In June 1563 he obtained license to go to England on private business; but on 20 April 1563 he was again sent to Scotland with the special aim of entangling the Scottish queen in negotiations for an English marriage: In 1563, Elizabeth suggested Lord Robert Dudley, her own favourite, as a consort to Mary, whom she thus hoped to neutralise by a marriage to an Englishman. Ambassador Randolph tried his best to further the project, which was strongly advocated by Cecil, many of whose instructions to Randolph survive. At first Mary was not enthusiastic; however, when it became clear, that Elizabeth would declare Mary her official heir on condition that she marry Dudley, the proposal was taken very seriously on the Scottish part. In September 1564 Elizabeth bestowed on Dudley the earldom of Leicester to make him more acceptable to Mary. In the beginning of 1565, Mary accepted the proposal at last.Chamberlin pp. 151-152 To the amazement of Randfolph, however, Leicester was not to be moved to comply with the proposal: > But a man of that nature I never found any...he whom I go about to make as > happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to make him > Prince of a mighty people, to lay in his naked arms a most fair and worthy > lady...nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby...but so > uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him.Chamberlin p. 158 Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning of the affair, that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand, and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. This Randolph had repeatedly tried to overcome by his letters.Chamberlin pp. 143-144, 151-152, 158 Elizabeth herself now had second thoughts regarding declarations concerning the succession. But as Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley became a serious candidate for Mary's marriage, Elizabeth wanted to prevent it. Randolph again received instructions to press for a marriage \"with the Earl of Leicester or some other; and if he find it so far passed as it cannot be revoked, then he shall...declare, how much it shall miscontent her Majesty\".Chamberlin p. 158-159 Randolph had time to report on a Roman antiquity discovered near Edinburgh at Musselburgh where there was an inscribed altar and a hypocaust.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 144. He was fond of Mary Beaton, one of Mary, Queen of Scots, companions. In April 1565 Beaton and Randolph teamed up to play bowls with the queen and Lord Darnley at Stirling Castle. They won, and Darnley gave Beaton a ring and a brooch with two agates worth fifty crowns.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 142. One of Randolph's Scottish contacts, Alexander Clark sent him a letter teasing him about their relationship in a joke using nonsense words; \"And as to your mistress Marie Beton, she is both darimpus and sclenbrunit, and you in like manner without contrebaxion or kylteperante, so you are both worth little money.\"Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 148. Randolph, to his utter chagrin,Chamberlin pp. 445-447 could not prevent the marriage of Beaton to Lord Darnley, yet after the marriage, he declined to recognise Darnley's authority. His representations and promises were mainly responsible for the rebellion of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, known as the Chaseabout Raid. On 14 February 1566 Randolph wrote to the Earl of Leicester that he was unable and unwilling to commit his opinions on Mary's actions on paper for fear of appearing \"malicieus foolyshe and unadvised\".V. Smith, 'Perspectives on Female Monarchy', in J. Daybell & S. Norrhem, Gender and Political Culture in Early Modern Europe (Abingdon, 2017), 152. In February 1566 he was accused by Mary of having assisted Moray and her rebellious subjects with a gift of three thousand crowns, and was required to quit the country within six days. Ultimately he retired to Berwick upon Tweed, and while there he was, after the murder of Riccio, accused by Mary of having written a book against her, called Mr. Randolph's Phantasy. ===Embassy to Russia and Scotland=== He was recalled to England about June 1566, and apparently it was shortly after his return that he was appointed \"Master of the King's Post,\" a position that later became postmaster general. On 2 November 1567 he obtained from Robert Constable an assignment of the office of constable or keeper of the Queenborough Castle and steward of the lordship or manor of Middleton and Merden in the county of Kent. In June 1568, he was sent on a special embassy to Russia in behalf of the English merchants trading in that country; and he succeeded in obtaining from Ivan IV a grant of certain privileges to the merchant adventurers, which led to the formation of the Muscovy Company. He returned from Russia in the autumn of 1569. Following representations made by Regent Moray's agent Nicolas Elphinstone in January 1570 he was sent to Scotland, although uncertain news of the Regent's assassination had reached London.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 58-61. He remained in Scotland for a year. ===Again in France and Scotland=== In October 1573 and April 1576 he went on special embassies to France. He was sent to Scotland in February 1578, but too late to prevent the fall of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. After the imprisonment of Morton in 1580 he returned to Scotland to conduct negotiations on his behalf. At a convention of the estates, held on 20 February 1581, besides presenting a paper declaring the \"Intention of the Queen's Majesty and her Offers to the King of Scotland', he, in a speech of two hours\" duration, denounced Esme Stewart, created by the king Duke of Lennox, as an agent of Rome. If anything, however, his bold intervention only helped to seal Morton's fate. Having failed to thwart the purposes of Lennox by a public accusation, he now attempted, with Elizabeth's sanction, to concoct a plot for the seizure of him and the young king; but, the plot having been betrayed, he fled to Berwick, after he had narrowly escaped death from a shot fired into the room he occupied in the provost's house at Edinburgh. Randolph was sent on his last mission to Scotland in January 1586 with instructions for the negotiation of a treaty between the two kingdoms, to which he succeeded in obtaining the signature of James VI. He held the joint offices of Chamberlain of the Exchequer and Master of the Post till his death, which took place in his house in St. Peter's Hill, near Thames Street, London, on 8 June 1590, when he was in his sixty-seventh year. He was buried in the church of St. Peter's, Paul's Wharf. Randolph, during his embassies, was kept very short of money, and had frequent difficulty in paying his expenses. Nor, important as had been his services, did he receive any reward beyond the not very remunerative offices above mentioned. The statement of Wood that he was knighted in 1571 is not supported by any evidence. Randolph is supposed to have been the author of the original short Latin Life of George Buchanan, but this must be regarded as at least doubtful. He took a special interest in the progress of Buchanan's History, and offered his aid with money if necessary towards its completion. ===Marriages=== Towards the close of 1571, he married Anne Walsingham, sister of Francis Walsingham, and daughter of Thomas Walsingham of Chiselhurst. Before the marriage he received, on 1 October 1571, an assignment from Thomas Walsingham and William Crowner of letters patent of the custody of the manor and hundred of Middleton and Merden, at the rent of 100 pounds per annum, to be paid to his intended wife. In 1572 he obtained the position of Chamberlain of the Exchequer for life. By Anne Walsingham, Randolph had a son, Thomas, who succeeded him. He had also another son, Ambrose, and a daughter, Frances, who married Thomas Fitzgerald. He is said to have married, probably as second wife, Ursula Copinger. His old friend the bachelor George Buchanan teased him about his second marriage in 1572; > If you had been in your right wit, you being once escaped the tempestous > storms and naufrage (shipwreck) of marriage, had never entered again the > same dangers, for I cannot take you for a Stoic philosopher, having one head > inexpugnable (not to be captured) with the frenetic tortures of jealousy, or > a careless heart sceptic that takes cuckoldry as thing indifferent.Ellis, > Henry, ed., Original Letters illustrative of English History, 3rd series, > vol. 3 (London, 1846) pp. 373-375, Buchanan to Randolph, 6 August 1572. ==References== *Chamberlin, Frederick: Elizabeth and Leycester Dodd, Mead & Co. 1939 ;Attribution Category:1523 births Category:1590 deaths Category:16th- century English diplomats Category:Ambassadors of England to Scotland Category:Ambassadors of England to Russia Category:Ambassadors of England to France Category:Court of Mary, Queen of Scots Category:Court of James VI and I Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:People from Kent (before 1889) Category:Principals of Broadgates Hall, Oxford Category:English Protestants Category:English expatriates in France Category:University of Paris alumni Category:English spies Category:16th-century English soldiers Category:English letter writers Category:English political writers Category:English civil servants Category:English merchants Category:English biographers Category:16th-century spies Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall Category:English MPs 1558 Category:English MPs 1559 Category:English MPs 1572\u20131583 Category:English MPs 1584\u20131585 Category:English MPs 1586\u20131587 Category:English MPs 1589 ",
