The Saltillo Rancho Seco, a Central Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games at Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo in Saltillo, the capital of the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. The team was led by owner/general manager Marco Antonio Davila De Leon and head coach Elizandro Campos with assistant coach Jesus Monroy. Saltillo won only 2 games, both at home, giving them a 2\u201317 record and leaving them out of the playoffs. ==Season summary== Saltillo struggled to find its footing in the MASL and lost the first 8 games of the season. The team finally won a game on January 9 hosting the Dallas Sidekicks at the outdoor Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo amidst freezing fog and frigid temperatures. Saltillo dropped another 8 consecutive games before splitting their final homestand against the Brownsville Barracudas. With the collapse of Hidalgo La Fiera leaving them one game short of the usual 20, Saltillo finished 2\u201317 and in 5th place in the Southern Division. They did not qualify for post-season play. ==History== In 2013, Saltillo became the third team based in Mexico to join the Professional Arena Soccer League. In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six refugee teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. With the league expansion and reorganization, Saltillo moved from the Central division to the new Southern division. The other Southern teams for 2014\u201315 are the Brownsville Barracudas, Dallas Sidekicks, Hidalgo La Fiera, Monterrey Flash, and Beaumont-based Oxford City FC of Texas. For the past four seasons, Saltillo has been a successful member of the Liga Mexicana de Futbol R\u00e1pido Profesional (LMFR) and remains a member of both leagues. The team struggled in the 2013\u201314 PASL season, earning a 6\u201310 record and failing to qualify for post-season play. ==Off-field moves== Revenues from the team's November 28 home opener against the Monterrey Flash were donated in support of the annual Telet\u00f3n which raises funds for rehabilitation centers for disabled children. ==Schedule== ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Saturday | November 1 | 6:00pm | at Brownsville Barracudas | L 11\u201312 | 0\u20131 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 850 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 2 | Saturday | November 22 | 7:05pm | at Oxford City FC of Texas | L 7\u20139 | 0\u20132 | Ford Arena | 1,243 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 3 | Friday | November 28 | 8:35pm | Monterrey Flash | L 5\u20139 | 0\u20133 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 980 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 4 | Friday | December 5 | 8:35pm | Monterrey Flash | L 3\u20139 | 0\u20134 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 635 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 5 | Friday | December 12 | 8:35pm | Hidalgo La Fiera | L 10\u201311 | 0\u20135 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 200 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 6 | Friday | December 19 | 8:35pm | Las Vegas Legends | L 6\u20137 | 0\u20136 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 200 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 7 | Sunday | December 28 | 3:05pm | at Oxford City FC of Texas | L 8\u201316 | 0\u20137 | Ford Arena | 986 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | January 3 | 6:00pm | at Brownsville Barracudas | L 6\u20137 (OT) | 0\u20138 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 225 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 9 | Friday | January 9 | 8:35pm | Dallas Sidekicks | W 7\u20136 | 1\u20138 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | ?? |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 10 | Wednesday | January 14 | 8:35pm | at Monterrey Flash | L 1\u201313 | 1\u20139 | Arena Monterrey | 1,134 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 11 | Sunday | January 18 | 5:05pm | at Monterrey Flash | L 0\u201315 | 1\u201310 | Arena Monterrey | 1,328 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 12 | Friday | January 23 | 8:35pm | Missouri Comets | L 8\u201314 | 1\u201311 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | ?? |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 13 | Friday | January 30 | 7:05pm | at Tulsa Revolution | L 8\u20139 | 1\u201312 | Expo Square Pavilion | ?? |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | January 31 | 7:00pm | at Dallas Sidekicks | L 3\u201311 | 1\u201313 | Allen Event Center | 3,833 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 15 | Saturday | February 7 | 5:00pm | Monterrey Flash | L 4\u201311 | 1\u201314 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 500 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 16 | Friday | February 13 | 8:35pm | Oxford City FC of Texas | L 7\u201313 | 1\u201315 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | ?? |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! 17 | Sunday | February 15 | 3:05pm | at Hidalgo La Fiera | CANCELLED | 1\u201315 | State Farm Arena | |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 18 | Sunday | February 22 | 1:00pm | at Brownsville Barracudas | L 8\u201311 | 1\u201316 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 140 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 19 | Friday | February 27 | 8:30pm | Brownsville Barracudas | W 15\u201310 | 2\u201316 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 70 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 20 | Saturday | February 28 | 5:00pm | Brownsville Barracudas | L 4\u20138 | 2\u201317 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 145 |} Originally scheduled for January 2 but moved forward due to availability and to avoid holiday travel.
