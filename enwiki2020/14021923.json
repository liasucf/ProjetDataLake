He is best known for his discovery of previously unknown texts in the Archimedes Palimpsest, and for his edition of Euclid's Elements that T. L. Heath translated into English. He also published an edition of Ptolemy's Almagest. == Biography == Heiberg was born in Aalborg, the son of Johanne Henriette Jacoba (n\u00e9e Schmidt) and Emil Theodor Heiberg.http://genealogy.munthe.net/database/g0004629.html#I3348 His sister married biochemist Max Henius. Heiberg was Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Copenhagen from 1896 until 1924. Among his more than 200 publications were editions of the works of Archimedes (1880 and 1912), Euclid (with Heinrich Menge) (1883\u20131916), Apollonius of Perga (1891\u201393), Serenus of Antinouplis (1896), Ptolemy (1898/1903), and Hero of Alexandria (1899). Many of his editions are still in use today. === Awards === The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Prix Binoux for 1912. === Notable students === * Ingeborg Hammer-Jensen, philologist and historian of science. ==Archimedes Palimpsest== Heiberg inspected the vellum manuscript in Constantinople in 1906, and realized that it contained mathematical works by Archimedes that were unknown to scholars at the time. Heiberg's examination of the manuscript was with the naked eye only, while modern analysis of the texts has employed x-ray and ultraviolet light. The Archimedes Palimpsest is currently stored at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. ==References== ==External links== * The Archimedes Palimpsest at the Walters Art Museum * PDF scans of Heiberg's edition of the works of Archimedes, now in the public domain (in Classical Greek) * PDF scans of Heiberg's edition of Ptolemy's Almagest (in Classical Greek) * How do we know about Greek mathematics? * How do we know about Greek mathematicians? * * Category:1854 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from Aalborg Category:Danish historians Category:Danish philologists Category:Historians of mathematics Category:Burials at the Cemetery of Holmen ",
