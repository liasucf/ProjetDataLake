    "text": "\"Save Tonight\" is a song by Swedish rock musician Eagle-Eye Cherry and the lead single from his debut album, Desireless. It is the album's opening track and gained substantial radio success, reaching number three in Ireland, number five in the United States, number six in the United Kingdom, and number two in Cherry's native Sweden. It was voted song of the year by New Zealand radio station The Edge in 1997. \"Save Tonight\" is considered the signature song of Eagle-Eye Cherry. It was awarded a Rockbj\u00f6rnen award in the \"Swedish song of the year 1997\" category. ==Music video== The monochrome video for the song was filmed at Sk\u00e5negatan 92-94 in Stockholm's S\u00f6dermalm district,https://www.gq.com/story/eagle-eye-cherry-save-tonight and features Cherry playing different characters and seeing the story from different perspectives. The first is a man readying for a date by buying roses and a bottle of wine at a deli. He then tells the butcher \"goodbye\" and the camera reveals that the butcher is in fact Cherry himself. A robber wearing tights on his head as a means of disguise (bought in the very first scene of the music video, which is watched by Cherry via shop window) then comes and takes the money out of the cash register. As he leaves, he is hit by a pickup truck, and as bystanders help him up he is revealed to actually be Cherry, as well as the driver in the truck. Another Cherry is seen playing a guitar and another is a bum on the street. The \"first\" Cherry appears once again at the end of the video, walking to the home of his date. The video gives the illusion of being presented as one continuous take. ==Formats and track listings== These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Save Tonight\".
