The lawsuit has been widely derided, and has been described on Groklaw as \"the stupidest lawsuit since the world began\". Although the company has already lost once in the Briey commercial tribunal, it is now pursuing the women in a higher court, the Court of Bankruptcy. ==External links== *The Stupidest Lawsuit Since the World Began - Groklaw *Bus firm takes car sharers to court - Guardian *Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer sa voiture au bus peut vous conduire au tribunal - Lib\u00e9ration (in French; Google translation) *89/524/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 September 1989 on a dispute between Luxembourg and France on the establishment of a special regular passenger service between these two States: an earlier dispute involving Transports Schiocchet Excursions Category:Anti-competitive practices Category:Bus companies of France ",
