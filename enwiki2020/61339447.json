    "text": "350px Portrait of Don Pedro de Barberana y Aparregui is an oil on canvas painting attributed to Vel\u00e1zquez and painted around 1631\u20131633. It has been in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas since 1981. V\u00e9lasquez uses a similar technique to portray the figure's contours and the reflections on the clothing to his portraits of Portrait of Don Diego del Corral y Arellano and his wife Portrait of Do\u00f1a Antonia de Ipe\u00f1arrieta y Gald\u00f3s and her son don Luis. However, in this case, he makes the space more neutral by leaving it empty to reinforce the strength of the figureJonathan Brown, Vel\u00e1zquez. Pintor y cortesano, Madrid, Alianza \u00e9dition, 1986 (), p 141. ==Provenance== No contemporary documents survive for this full-length portrait. It is first mentioned as a V\u00e9lasquez work in 1992 by Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Rey, who gave it the title A Knight of CalatravaL\u00f3pez-Rey, J., \"An unpublished Vel\u00e1zquez: A Knight of Calatrava\", Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 80 (1972), p. 61-70.. It was then in a private collection in New York. The only earlier reference to the work shows that it was bought in Europe around 1950. Other art critics supported L\u00f3pez- Rey's conclusion and Jos\u00e9 Gudiol identified the work's subject as Pedro de Barberana (Briones, 1579- idem 1649), a lord, high treasurer and member of the royal privy councilVel\u00e1zquez, 1990, exhibition catalogue, p. 198.. In October 1630 he joined the Order of Calatrava, whose cross is shown on his breast and his cape. However, in October 1630 V\u00e9lasquez was still in Italy, meaning it must date from after that yearL\u00f3pez-Rey, 1996, p. 142.Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Rey, Vel\u00e1zquez.
