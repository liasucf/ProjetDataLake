    "text": "I Saw My Lady Weepe performed. \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" is a lute song from The Second Book of Songs by Renaissance lutenist and composer John Dowland.Holman and O'Dette It is the first song in the Second Book and is dedicated to Anthony Holborne.Leech Wilkinson pg. 227 It is an example of Dowland's use of chromaticism. ==Composition== While composing \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" , Dowland was influenced by what has been referred to as the \"Elizabethan Melancholy\" or \"Cult of Darkness.\" Wells pg. 514, Leech-Wilkinson pg. 230 \"Flow my tears\", the song that follows it, and other songs in the Second Booke also show this influence.Wells pg. 523 There is also a song by Morley called \"I Saw My Lady Weeping\". Robin Headlam Wells stated that Dowland's songs follow this convention about transmitting feelings. According to Wells, the subject of the song is the power of the lady's beauty\u2014or in other words the overriding power of female beauty, whether spiritual or physical. This idea of power coming from a woman's beauty is one that is quite common in the poetry of the Elizabethan era.Wells pg. 524 The poetry of \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" breaks with some of the conventions of its day in its treatment of the lady's beauty and charms. Rather than grouping them together, Dowland presents a paradox in which the lady herself becomes more beautiful than her sorrow; at this time, it was the emotion itself that was generally considered to be the beauty or charm, rather than the human subject itself. Like most examples of this type, it ends with an ironic admission of the power of love has to conquer over reason. The composer can then take liberties regarding the theoretical nature of the music to which he sets the text. The joining of the text with the music enhances the sense of the melancholy that pervades the verse of the time and through this merger, the music of the epoch takes on this same sense.Wells pg. 524Wells pg. 526 ===Relation to \"Flow My Tears\"=== It has been asserted that \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" is not complete in and of itself. Rather, it is dependent upon the song that directly succeeds it, \"Flow My Tears\", to be complete. In comparison to the other lute songs in the Second Booke, \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" ends on the fifth; looking at the chordal structure, the final note of the sung line is the leading-tone. It is the only work that ends this way in the book, when theoretically, it should resolve back to the tonic.Leech-Wilkinson pg. 229 This ending on the fifth is what leads Leech- Wilkinson to assert the necessity of \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" being concluded by \"Flow My Tears\", because \"Flow My Tears\" provides the necessary resolution, by beginning on the tonic note of \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\". Looking at \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" on its own, the relationship created by ending on the fifth \"...might seem easily explicable in traditional modal terms, the harmonic language of the song cannot sensibly be read as mode 4 (a-a', but with the final on e).\" It is the movement within the song, leading away from a sense of the tonic along with the aforementioned final of the sung line on the seventh, that brings questions about how to analyze the work because ending on the seventh within mode 4 seems unallowable and because of this, the song is unresolved whether viewed as modal or tonal. When viewed in relation to Wells' idea of the melancholy, it may begin to appear these two songs are not a pair, as Leech-Wilkinson suggests, but rather that the sense of a need for resolution left behind at the end of \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" could be intentional on the part of the composer, in order to leave the listener with a deeper sense of the emotions of the work. One of the other devices used by Dowland suggesting that the compositions are a pair is his use of syncopation at the end of the last phrase of \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\". The syncopation disrupts the sense of rhythm within the song, and the addition of what could be considered extra notes leading to a necessary textual repeat leaves the rhythm also wanting a metrical resolution; this resolution is given by the opening material of the following song. This melodic joining of the songs lends itself to the idea that \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" may have been composed as an introduction to \"Flow My Tears\". This idea is built upon the knowledge that \"Flow My Tears\" is a setting of an earlier Dowland pavane for lute, while, according to Leech-Wilkinson, \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" most likely originated as a song. Leech-Wilkinson also asserts that it is possible that \"I saw my Lady weepe\" is in some ways a continuation of the dedication of the Second Booke to the Countess of Bedford. However, it seems unlikely given that \"I Saw My Lady Weepe\" is dedicated to Anthony Holborne. == Lyrics == ==Notes== ==References== *Holman, Peter with Paul O'Dette. \"John Dowland\", Grove Music Online, ed.
