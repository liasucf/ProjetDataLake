    "text": "Fort Fincastle Fort Fincastle is a fort located in the city of Nassau on the island of New Providence in The Bahamas. It was built to provide protection to Nassau. The fort was built in 1793 by Lord Dunmore to protect Nassau from pirates. Built on Society and Bennet's Hills, the fort overlooks the city of Nassau and the Queen\u2019s Staircase, and is often accessed that way by visitors on foot. This fort shaped like a paddle-steamer, Lord Dunmore called Fort Fincastle, after his second title, Viscount Fincastle. The fort overlooked Nassau and Paradise Island and the eastern approaches to New Providence. It mounted two 24-pounders, two 32-pounders, two 12-pounder cannons and one howitzer and served as a lighthouse until September 1817 when it was replaced by the lighthouse on Paradise Island (and was subsequently used as a signal station). ==See also== * Fort Montagu * Fort Charlotte (Nassau) * Old Fort of Nassau ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Nassau, Bahamas Category:New Providence Category:History of the Colony of the Bahamas Category:Forts in the Bahamas Category:Piracy in the Atlantic Ocean Category:1793 establishments in the British Empire ",
