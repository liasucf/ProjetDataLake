    "text": "The Yerba Buena Steam Tram (Spanish Tranvia rural a vapor de Yerba Buena) was a long narrow-gauge railway with a gauge of in the Argentine city of Yerba Buena. It was inaugurated on 29 June 1916 during the centennial of Argentine independence and was shut down a decade later in 1926. == Route== Ready for departure at Plaza Alberdi The trains started at Plaza Alberdi (the square at the Central Argentino railway station) and went west on Calle Santiago del Estero, turned right into Avenida Mitre and followed it until they turned left into Avenida Manuel Belgrano. Here they passed the depot and the workshops. From here they drove west again to the Avenida Ej\u00e9rcito del Norte. They then turned south until they continued on Calle C\u00f3rdoba (now Calle Don Bosco) to the west. On the Calle Aconquija (now Calle Luis Federico Nougu\u00e9s) they drove to the Avenida Mate de Luna, which they followed to the terminus Horco Molle at today's El Corte roundabout at the foot of the San Javier Hill. == Operation== Bad weather ride The railway ran 6 to 8 times a day. It was colloquially called \"Trencito\" (little train) or \"La Chorbita\" (choo choo train). A single trip through the then still rural suburbs took between 45 minutes and one hour. The stops were named with numbers, some of which are still used colloquially today. == Closure == Although a total of 135,505 passengers had been carried by 1925, rail operations were discontinued in 1926 due to a lack of profitability. == External links == * Fotos y postales de Trenes y Tranv\u00edas de Tucum\u00e1n, cortes\u00eda de Eduardo Iglesias == References == El chisporroteo de la chorbita mand\u00f3 a v\u00eda muerta al \u201cTrencito\u201d de Yerba Buena.
