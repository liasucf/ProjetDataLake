The club was Ish\u00f8j IF in the Denmark Series.Offenberg afviser karrierestop: Forts\u00e6tter i DS, bold.dk, 28 June 2019 ==International career== In September 2018, the Danish Football Association and players' union were scheduled to sign a new national team agreement for the players of the Denmark national team prior to a friendly against Slovakia and their opening UEFA Nations League match against Wales. However, a contract dispute arose regarding the commercial rights of the players, resulting in a failure to sign a new agreement. Despite an offer from the squad to extend the previous deal to allow for further negotiations, the DBU instead named an entirely uncapped squad under the temporary management of coach John Jensen to avoid punishment from UEFA for cancelling the matches. The squad consisted of a mixture of players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), along with futsal players from the Denmark national futsal team. On 4 September 2018, Offenberg was one of 24 players to be named in the replacement squad. The following day, he made his international debut in the friendly match against Slovakia. He was the captain of the team and played the entire match, which finished as a 0\u20133 away loss. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Denmark |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2018||1||0 |- !Total!!1!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:K\u00f8ge BK players Category:BK Avarta players ",
