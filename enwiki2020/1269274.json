    "text": "The 1994\u201395 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the third season of the Premier League, the top division of professional football in England. ==Overview== ===Transfers=== Just before the start of the 1994\u201395 season, the English transfer record was broken when Blackburn Rovers paid \u00a35 million for 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton. But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid \u00a36 million for Newcastle United's Andy Cole, in a deal which also saw \u00a31 million-rated Keith Gillespie move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994\u201395 season included: Vinny Samways (Tottenham to Everton, \u00a32 million), David Rocastle (Manchester City to Chelsea, \u00a31.25 million), J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann (Monaco to Tottenham Hotspur, \u00a32 million), John Scales (Wimbledon to Liverpool, \u00a33 million) and Paul Kitson (Derby County to Newcastle United, \u00a32.2 million). ===Summary=== The title race was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (last 1927\u201328 FA Cup). Kenny Dalglish's side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2\u20131 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham. This meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the European Cup for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a UEFA Cup place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Newcastle United briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season. Also qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth League Cup in the club's first full season following the appointment of Roy Evans) and fifth placed Leeds United. The number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two. ===Controversial incidents=== In January 1995, Manchester United's 28-year-old French striker Eric Cantona (then holder of the PFA Players' Player of the Year award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan in his team's 1\u20131 draw at Selhurst Park. Cantona was banned from football for eight months, fined \u00a320,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Chelsea midfielder Dennis Wise was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a taxi driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal. Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to cocaine and gambling. He underwent a three-month drug rehabilitation programme before being allowed to resume his playing career. Crystal Palace striker Chris Armstrong failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in 1994\u201395, helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the First Division just one season after winning promotion. Arsenal manager George Graham was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of \u00a3425,000 from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players P\u00e5l Lydersen and John Jensen three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the FA. ==Teams== Twenty-two teams competed in the league \u2013 the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and Leicester City (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Sheffield United, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town, ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively. ===Stadiums and Locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" !
