The term is often used in chemical patent literature to protect claims over a broad scope. ==Examples== * Acetonyl group * Acyl group (e.g. acetyl group, benzyl group) * Alkyl group (e.g., Methyl group, ethyl group) * Alkenyl group (e.g., Vinyl group, allyl group) * Alkynyl group (propargyl group) * Benzyloxycarbonyl group (Cbz) * tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc) * Carboxyl group ==References== Category:Functional groups ",
