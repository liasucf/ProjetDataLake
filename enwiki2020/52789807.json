Eddy served on the Coolgardie Municipal Council from 1901 to 1903.William Tresize Eddy \u2013 Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 5 January 2017. He first stood for parliament at the 1901 Coolgardie by-election, a ministerial by-election caused by the appointment of Alf Morgans as premier. He also stood unsuccessfully at the 1904 state election, losing to Henry Ellis. At the 1905 state election, Eddy was elected to Coolgardie with a 23-vote margin, standing as a Ministerialist. However, the election was declared void in May 1906, due to voting irregularities.\"COOLGARDIE ELECTION PETITION\", The Daily News, 31 May 1906. A by-election was held in July 1906, at which Eddy increased his margin to 100 votes. His opponent at the by-election, Charles McDowall of the Labor Party, recontested the seat at the 1908 state election and was elected, defeating Eddy by 340 votes. After leaving politics, Eddy worked as an auctioneer, initially in Coolgardie and then from 1913 based in Merredin.
