    "text": "Presidential elections were held in Egypt between 26 and 28 March 2018, though Egyptians abroad voted from 16 to 18 March 2018. On 19 January, incumbent President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi formally announced he would run for a second and final term. El-Sisi won the election with 97%, according to the official results. A runoff would have taken place 19 to 21 April outside the country and 24 to 26 April within the country if no candidate had reached 50% of the vote. The election had a turnout of roughly 41%, lower than the 2014 election's 47%. Fourteen human rights groups dismissed the poll as \"farcical\". They said the authorities had \"trampled over even the minimum requirements for free and fair elections\", stifling basic freedoms and eliminating key challengers. The only approved challenger to Sisi was another pro-government politician, Moussa Mostafa Moussa. ==Electoral system== The president of Egypt is elected using the two-round system.Arab Republic of Egypt IFES The winner will be announced on 2 April (if no run-off is needed). If a run-off is needed, the final result will be announced on 1 May 2018. If only one person runs for the presidency, he or she can win with a yes vote from five percent of the eligible voters. ==Boycotts== The Civil Democratic Movement announced on 30 January 2018 that it would boycott the vote. ==Candidates== ===Abdel Fattah el-Sisi=== Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is the incumbent president of Egypt. After playing a key role in overthrowing the regime of the Muslim Brotherhood- affiliated president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 after massive protests against the latter's rule, el-Sisi retired from his military career in 2014 and subsequently won that year's presidential election. In the announcement of his candidacy, he stated, \"There are people I know who are corrupt, I will not allow them to come near this chair.\u201d President Sisi received the endorsement of 464 members of Egyptian Parliament, approximately two thirds of the body. ===Moussa Mostafa Moussa=== Ghad Party chairman Moussa Mostafa Moussa, a pro- Sisi politician who had an active role in collecting nomination pledges for Sisi's second term until 20 January, announced that he found endorsements from 26 members of parliament, as well as 47,000 signatures from the public, although he declared his intention to run just a day before the deadline of the elections commission. Moussa submitted his nomination pledges and official paperwork to the commission just 15 minutes before the deadline. In an interview with Egypt Today, Moussa said he was not a \"phony\" candidate, and that he had \"a vision that can be achieved by being part of the system\". ==Declined candidates== *Ahmed Shafik, former Egyptian prime minister and leader of the Egyptian Patriotic Movement and 2012 presidential candidate. ==Withdrawn candidates== *Khaled Ali, a human rights lawyer and former head of the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and 2012 presidential candidate, announced his intention to run for the presidency on 6 November 2017. Ali withdrew on 24 January 2018 after the arrest of another candidate, Sami Anan. He had also been convicted of making \"an obscene gesture\" outside a courthouse and was in the appeal process. *Sami Hafez Anan, former Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, officially announced his candidacy in a Facebook video on 19 January 2018. He was arrested on 23 January after being accused by the Egyptian Armed Forces of forging his release from military service. It is illegal in Egypt for active military personnel to participate in politics. Anan retired from military service in 2012 after being removed by then-president Mohamed Morsi. The Defense Ministry claims that it has documentation that he is still a reserve member of the military. Anan's campaign manager claimed in a television interview that Anan had submitted the paperwork to request a discharge from his reserve status, and said Anan had followed the precedent set by President Sisi in his 2014 run. *El-Sayyid el-Badawi, chairman of the New Wafd Party. *Mortada Mansour, chairman of Zamalek Sporting Club. *Anwar Essmat Sadat, expelled MP, chairman of the Reform and Development Misruna Party, former chairman of the Egyptian House of Representatives' Human Rights Committee and nephew of Anwar Sadat. ==Conduct== Supporters of former presidential candidates Sami Hafez Anan and Khaled Ali faced difficulties in registering pledges for them. It was reported that el-Sisi exerted pressure on former presidential candidates so that they would not run against him. According to Foreign Policy, \"the March vote will in no way confirm President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's popularity among the Egyptian people. This election campaign is merely an extension of the internal power struggle among the military and the regime's security services, and it has nothing to do with democratic mechanisms worthy of the name.\" ==Results== Following the elections, it was reported that large number of spoilt ballot papers, possibly more than a million, involved voters crossing out both names and writing that of football player Mohamed Salah. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% |- |align=left|Abdel Fattah el-Sisi||align=left|Independent||21,835,387||97.08 |- |align=left|Moussa Mostafa Moussa||align=left|El-Ghad Party||656,534||2.92 |- |align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes (Mohamed Salah)||1,762,231||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||24,254,152||100 |- |align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout||59,078,138||41.05 |- |align=left colspan=4|Source: HEC |} ==References== Category:2018 elections in Africa Presidential election Category:March 2018 events in Africa 2018 ",
