    "text": "Radical Action to Unseat the Hold of Monkey Mind is a box set of live performances by King Crimson, released on 2 September 2016. The box set was recorded during King Crimson's 2015 tours of Japan, Canada and France, mostly in Takamatsu, Japan. The material performed is mostly from the 1969\u20131974 period, and most had not been performed live since the 1970s, although the songs were rearranged to suit the current line-up. Also included are some pieces from 1995 and onward, alongside new material. The title is derived from a song of the same name that the band has been playing in concert. The set was released in two editions: a 4-disc standard edition featuring the complete concert in one Blu-ray disc and three CDs (individually themed \"virtual studio albums\" with no audible audience); and a 6-disc deluxe limited edition, featuring the same as the standard edition plus two DVDs with the complete concert and an expanded booklet. The Blu-ray disc has a \"picture off\" mode which allows listening to the music without the video. ==Track listing== ===Disc one, Mainly Metal=== ===Disc two, Easy Money Shots=== ===Disc three, Crimson Classics=== ==Personnel== ;King Crimson * Pat Mastelotto \u2013 drums, electronic drums, percussion * Bill Rieflin \u2013 drums, electronic drum, percussion, sampled Mellotron, synthesizer * Gavin Harrison \u2013 drums, electronic drums, percussion, audio pre-production * Mel Collins \u2013 saxophones, flutes * Tony Levin \u2013 bass, extended-range bass, funk fingers, electric upright bass, Chapman Stick, backing vocals * Jakko Jakszyk \u2013 guitar, voice, flute, audio pre-production * Robert Fripp \u2013 guitar, guitar synth, keyboards, Soundscapes, production, mixing, additional footage ;additional staff * DGM \u2013 management * David Singleton \u2013 mixing, production, video compiling, liner notes * Chris Porter \u2013 engineering, mixing * Alex R.
