It is endemic to the Western Ghats of India and is known from its type locality, \"Malabar\" in Kerala, and from the Nilgiri mountains in Tamil Nadu. It is known with several common names: Malabar tailed caecilian, Nilgiris caecilian, Malabar caecilian, and white-lipped caecilian. ==Description== Adult measure including the tail. The body is short and stout, violet-coloured dorsally and lighter ventrally. The eyes are distinct and surrounded by a light ring. The tentacles are placed ventrally, close to the lip. Light-coloured areas are present around the nostrils, snout tip, and tentacles. The upper lips and lower jaw are also of a light cream colour. There is a light spot present near vent, and the tip of the tail is whitish. ==Habitat and conservation== Uraeotyphlus malabaricus has been collected in evergreen tropical forest ( above sea level), but its ecology is generally poorly known. Presumably, the adults are fossorial. It is probably an oviparous species laying terrestrial eggs and having aquatic larvae. Threats to this species are not known. It occurs in the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve. ==References== malabaricus Category:Amphibians of India Category:Endemic fauna of the Western Ghats Category:Taxa named by Richard Henry Beddome Category:Amphibians described in 1870 ",
