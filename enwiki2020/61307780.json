The 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, operating in the foothills southwest of Hu\u1ebf, conducted spoiling attacks into Base Area 114 from the bases they had built along Route 547 in March and April. The division also exchanged mobile training teams with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 1st Division. ==Operation== At 12:30 on 21 May, a PAVN battalion, augmented by personnel from a sapper demolition team, launched a ground attack against Camp Eagle, following a covering barrage of more than 400 rounds of 122mm rockets, 82mm mortars, B-40 and B-41 rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) into the Division headquarters area. The ground attack struck the southwest edge of the perimeter and was beaten back by headquarters troops of the 1st Brigade, members of the 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment and helicopter gunships.
