    "text": "The Kcskeh\u00e1t Limestone is a Jurassic geologic formation in Hungary. Indeterminate fossil Sauropod tracks have been reported from the formation. It is abundant on Illite and very little Kaolinite that indicates a change from the humid-subtropical climate of the Mecsek Coal Formation to the monsoon-like semi-arid climate of the Pliensbachian formations. The dominance of illite indicates a relatively fast erosion of the source area and a moderate input of terrigenous clastics relative to the underlying formations.Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r G., Szinger B., Piros O.
