    "text": "Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya, also known as K.C. Bhattacharya, (12 May 1875 \u2013 11 December 1949) was a philosopher at the University of Calcutta known for his method of \"constructive interpretation\" through which relations and problematics of ancient Indian philosophical systems are drawn out and developed so that they can be studied like problems of modern philosophy. He was especially interested in the problematic of how the mind (or consciousness) creates an apparently material universe. Bhattacharya encouraged the idea of an immersive cosmopolitanism in which Indian systems of philosophy were modernized through assimilation and immersion rather than to through a blind imitation of European ideas.https://www.academia.edu/29275455/Freedom_in_Thinking_The_Immersive_Cosmopolitanism_of_Krishnachandra_Bhattacharya_2017_ ==Early life== Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya was born on 12 May 1875 at Serampore in a family of Sanskrit scholars.
