L. Whyte ==Early Life and Career== Whyte, the son of Dr. Alexander Whyte, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland into the privileged childhood of a great house; Alexander Whyte was at the time a renowned Presbyterian minister. Lancelot received his education at Bedales School (England). He was a soldier during the First World War, returning to enter Trinity College, Cambridge and studying physics under Ernest Rutherford. Subsequently, he studied at G\u00f6ttingen University in Germany. Whyte\u2019s interest developed as much along lines of human evolution and philosophy as that of theoretical physics. To earn a living, White entered industry and banking in Britain, but he returned to Germany for a year, where he met Albert Einstein. Back in Britain, in 1935 Whyte met Frank Whittle, one of the pioneers of the turbojet engine, and became a backer of the development of this invention, the eventual result being the British Air Ministry's initial commitment to the development of turbojet-powered planes, nearly five years later. ==Unified field theory== He claimed to have worked with Albert Einstein on the unified field theory.Focus and Diversions, L L Whyte, Cresset Press, London 1963 He further claimed that this work was based on the theory of the 18th century natural philosopher Roger Boscovich.Roger Joseph Boscovich SJ FRS, 1711 -1787 Studies of his life and work on the 250th anniversary of his birth, edited L L Whyte, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1961 Whyte proposed something he called \"the unitary principle\" to unify physics theories.The Unitary Principle in Physics and biology, LL Whyte, London, 1949 Experimental work on this theory was carried out by Leo Baranski.Scientific Basis for World Civilization: Unitary Field theory, Leo J Baranski, The Christopher Publishing House, USA, 1960 ==Evolution== Whyte was the author of the book Internal Factors in Evolution (1965). He proposed that Darwin's theory of natural selection is limited to external factors, and internal factors are a second directive agency in evolution.Clovis, Jesse F. (1968). Internal Factors in Evolution by L. L. Whyte. Castanea. Vol. 33, No. 2. p. 156. Whyte proposed the term \"internal selection.\" John Tyler Bonner in the American Scientist positively reviewed the book. According to Bonner: > [Internal selection] is simply that there are two kinds of selection; an > external Darwinian one and an internal one which is independent of the > adaptability of the organism to a particular environment. The internal > selection takes place by the machinery of the organism passing upon whether > or not a particular mutation can survive considering the nature of internal > milieu.Bonner, John Tyler. (1965). Internal Factors in Evolution by L. L. > Whyte. American Scientist. Vol. 53, No. 2. p. 198A, 200A. In 2014 the philosopher Hans-Joachim Niemann wrote about Whyte: > Whyte's ideas were beyond the long-established tracks but do not sound too > far-fetched today. He postulated the existence of \u00bbdirective factors\u00ab in the > machinery of the cell. These factors control mutations as well as an > \u00bbinternal selection\u00ab, a particular kind of evolution separately optimizing > processes in the cell. Whyte\u2019s \u00bbinternal selection\u00ab explained \u00bbthe > directions of evolutionary change by internal organizational factors\u00ab. His > model demonstrates why some well-corroborated genes are protected, and why, > on the other hand, sensible variations of certain traits are supported by > well-directed mutations of the related genes. The cell is the conductor, and > the genome is its score to be interpreted wisely.Niemann, Hans-Joachim, Karl > Popper and the Two New Secrets of Life, T\u00fcbingen: Mohr Siebeck 2014, chap. > I, sect. 6, subsection 'Lancelot L. Whyte', p. 36-37. Other scientists have been more critical. Biologist Robert E. Hillman gave the book a negative review, commenting \"in a weak and ill-supported effort to deemphasize the role of natural selection in evolution Whyte has detracted from what could have been a fine analysis and philosophical discussion of the latest advances in the chemical basis of heredity and evolution.\"Hillman, Robert E. (1965). Internal Factors in Evolution by Lancelot Law Whyte. Chesapeake Science. Vol. 6, No. 2. pp. 123\u2013124. ==Works== ===Scientific papers=== *Z. Phys., 56, 809, 1929.
