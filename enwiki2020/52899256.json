He was elected as Penang State Legislative Assemblyman for Pantai Jerejak in 2013 election with a bigger majority vote than his predecessor and was appointed as the Deputy Chief Minister 1 of Penang.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said in a statement later that Dr Wan Azizah had never approved the speech text that was delivered and had also not delegated anyone to read out the text of the speech at the event. It also denied that the government would extend its full cooperation to the implementation of the EM-IIG project. Rashid had denied that he represented the Deputy Prime Minister at the event. He demanded the organisers to act immediately to correct the situation and clear his name of any confusion or he would consider legal action against them. ==Election results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\" |+ Penang State Legislative Assembly Results only available from the 2004 election (GE11). !|Year !|Constituency !colspan=2| !|Votes !|Pct !colspan=2|Opponent(s) !|Votes !|Pct !|Ballots cast !|Majority !|Turnout |- |2013 |N36 Pantai Jerejak, P52 Bayan Baru | | | (PKR) | align=\"right\" | 11,805 | 64.66% | | |Wong Mun Hoe (Gerakan) | align=\"right\" | 6,451 | 35.34% |18,464 |5,354 |85.64% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:90%\" |+ Parliament of Malaysia Percentage figures based on total turnout. !|Year !|Constituency !colspan=2| !|Votes !|Pct !colspan=2|Opponent(s) !|Votes !|Pct !|Ballots cast !|Majority !|Turnout |- |rowspan=\"3\" |2018 |rowspan=\"3\"|P150 Batu Pahat, Johor | rowspan=\"3\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | (PKR) | rowspan=\"3\" |45,929 | rowspan=\"3\" |55.92% |- | | |Halizah Abdullah (UMNO) |28,035 |34.13% | rowspan=\"3\" |83,234 | rowspan=\"3\" |17,894 | rowspan=\"3\" |84.81% |- | | |Mahfodz Mohamed (PAS) |8,173 |9.95% |} ==Honours== * : ** 50px Companion of the Order of the Defender of State (DMPN) \u2013 Dato' (2013) ==See also== * Batu Pahat (federal constituency) * Pantai Jerejak (state constituency) == Notes == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from Muar Category:People from Johor Category:Malaysian people of Malay descent Category:Malaysian Muslims Category:Members of the Dewan Rakyat Category:People's Justice Party (Malaysia) politicians Category:Members of the Penang State Legislative Assembly Category:Penang state executive councillors Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield Category:National University of Malaysia alumni Category:21st-century Malaysian politicians ",
