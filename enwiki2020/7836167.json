Having been a professor of rhetoric at Chartres and then a tutor at Paris, Danchet gave up teaching to write for the theatre. He wrote some opera libretti which, set to music by Andr\u00e9 Campra, met with success. By contrast, his tragedies, mediocre imitations of Racine, almost all failed. He died in Paris. An associate member of the Acad\u00e9mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres from 1705, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1712 thanks to the patronage of Mesdames de Ferriol et de Tencin. Voltaire wrote an epigram about him stating that his membership was more for his good deeds than his writing.:fr:Antoine Danchet He died in Paris. His works, published in 1751 include, in addition to dramatic works, odes, cantatas, and letters. ==Principal works== * H\u00e9sione (1700) ; * Tancr\u00e8de (1702) ; * Cyrus (1706) ; * Les Tyndarides (1708) ; * Les f\u00eates v\u00e9nitiennes (1710) ; * Les H\u00e9raclides (1719) ; * Nit\u00e9tis (1724). ==References== == External links == * Antoine Danchet on Data.bnf.fr Category:1671 births Category:1748 deaths Category:People from Riom Category:18th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise Category:French opera librettists ",
