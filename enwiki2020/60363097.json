After developing an interest in art and graduating from Southport High School, he studied graphic design, painting and photography at the Herron School of Art and Design at IUPUI in Indianapolis (BFA, 1990).Crone, Katrina. \"Uncovering the mystery that is 'Chester,'\" The Encounter, Joliet, IL, April 27, 2006, p. 11. He moved to Chicago in 1993, and initially photographed artists, musicians, and transients while living in a warehouse district on the city's South Side, near Chinatown. In 1994, he enrolled in graduate school at Columbia College Chicago (MFA, 1998), where he studied with photographers Bob Thall and Melissa Ann Pinney, and painter Corey Postiglione.Sturgess, L.

Although Alamo-Costello's work has included drawings, painting and journals, his artistic practice primarily lies in two areas: art-related public interventions, performances and social experiments that may be site-specific or placed in public space;Camper, Fred. \"Lots of Meaning,\" The Reader, September 16, 1994, p. 30\u20131. and photographic series in which he often takes on the role of archivist or journalist, collecting and documenting everyday, contemporary experiences and encounters. === Public and ephemeral art and social experiments === Alamo-Costello has worked on a range of public, temporary and experimental projects that present artwork in non-traditional settings to \"non-art\" audiences and explore themes of ephemerality, randomness, communication, and trust.Baran-Unland, Denise. \"Art in the park,\" The Herald News, December 19, 1999, p. E1, E6. His first forays into this work came about as a founding member of \"Armpit\" (1992\u20138), a performance and public art group that included himself and artists Jesse Bercowetz, Nick Nuccio and Michael Plaza. Between 1993\u20135, they embarked on three \"art walks\"\u2014the longest, a 298-mile Chicago-to-St. Louis trip\u2014wheeling carts of their own sculpture as a \"roving street gallery\" bringing contemporary art to communities and viewers that normally have little contact with it in their own environments.Bibbs, Rebecca. \"Exhibit Art...Walking,\" The Indianapolis News, May 30, 1993, p. 13. In 1994, they created a temporary display of large \"urban drop-offs\" or \"urban totems\" in empty Chicago city lots that they made from refuse (cinder blocks, hunks of concrete, scrap wood, tubes and old tires) found on-site. The Chicago Reader's Fred Camper described it as a \"guerrilla installation\" of \"near-chaotic accretions\" that \"gains much from its relationship to the site, and from the social goals that made the group choose it.\" ==== \"Art Drop\" series ==== Alamo-Costello extended the urban drop-off concept with his \"art drop\" series (1998\u2013 ), an art-based social experiment that sought to break through the inaccessibility of art galleries and markets by introducing artworks in unexpected public places, thus involving a broader base of viewers in responding to and collecting art.McNichols, Kate. \"Art in the park,\" The Encounter, Joliet, IL, November 1, 2002, p. 11. For the first drop, \"Searching for Geomantricks\" (1998), Alamo- Costello created sixty 4\" x 5\" lightboxes with abstract color images inlaid in glass and encased in stained oak frames, which he placed in 20 Chicago public parks for passersby to find, keep and respond to; each was accompanied by a note describing the piece and project, a pen, and a self-addressed, stamped envelope for responding. The images, which resembled spider-like lairs, doubled as \"puzzle\" pieces that combined to form a large-scale image called Geomantrick's Blessing, which Alamo-Costello created by shooting sections of a string composition with a large format camera, varying exposure times, focus points and color balance.Weiss, Andrea. \"Searching for Geomantrick\", Public Art Review, Vol. 11, No. 2, Fall/Winter 1999, p. 43. Between 1999\u20132004, he produced \"Appleseed International\"\u2014named for the American folk-hero, Johnny Appleseed\u2014in which he distributed 280 similarly conceived works to 20 U.S. and 20 international city parks.Weiss, Andrea. \"Appleseed\", Public Art Review, Vol. 12, No. 1, Fall/Winter 2000, p. 52. For New Street Agenda (2005-2013), he created 280 framed graffiti-like prints that comment on contemporary modes of deceptive communication and distributed them in 80 international cities from St. Petersburg, Russia through Europe to the United States. Alamo-Costello has received responses from about 30% of the left pieces, from places as widespread as Edinburgh and Paris to Joliet, Illinois. In 2000, Alamo-Costello produced \u201cThe Men Who Sold The World\u201d with Scottish artist Donald McGhie, an interactive exhibition and performance at the Hyde Park Art Center that explored contemporary \"savage\" capitalism and aggressive marketing techniques in the guise of a \"fly-by-night upstart company\" willing to buy or sell anything. The show transformed the center into \"an enterprise zone\" including modern office cubicles, product displays, flashing lights, and money-themed imagery; performative elements\u2014at the opening and a second performance\u2014included aggressive entrepreneurs offering to buy ideas, telemarketing of cellphone users from across the room, a liquidation auction down to the walls, and a money giveaway in the street.

From The Globe, 2010. === Documentary photographic practice === Alamo-Costello has created distinct photographic series since 1993, produced throughout the Midwest and Europe, using an approach informed by art and documentary photographers such as Barbara Crane, Mitch Epstein, Walker Evans, Susan Meiselas, Daid\u014d Moriyama, and August Sander. These series include \"Chicago Portraits\" (1993- ), depicting Chicago creatives, passersby, and neighborhoods; \"7 Minutes SW of the Loop\" (1996-2012), portraits and neighborhood studies of Chicago's near south side; \"Street Notes\" (1993- ), images of ephemeral street art, messages and signage; and \"University\" (2002- ), images taken at USF. Additional series have formed the basis of his three books. Chester Alamo-Costello, Chicago Street, Vicinity of Damen Ave. and North Ave., photograph, Chicago, IL, 2012. From Somewhere In-Between Chicago, 2018. Alamo-Costello's first sustained photographic subject was his grandfather, Danny Uberto, who he memorialized in his first book, Grandpa Danny (2008). The book combines sections compiling family mementos and snapshots, catalogued personal artifacts, and photos taken by Alamo-Costello; it was described as straddling the genres of fine arts monograph and personal visual tribute documenting a century of everyday life. His second book, The Globe (2010), also took on a personal subject: football (soccer) fan support at The Globe, a pub in Chicago\u2019s Northcenter neighborhood that Alamo-Costello frequented and documented over five years.Garcia, Martin. \"The Globe: A Photobook of Soccer Fandom,\" Gapers Block, May 10, 2010.Guth, Amy, \"The Globe,\" Chicago Tribune, June 5, 2010. The book was noted for its emotional universality, capturing in unpolished, snapshot-like compositions of \"unusual rawness and immediacy,\" the interactions of fans, clubs, and televised contests. Somewhere In-Between Chicago (2018) documents people (artists, musicians, commuters, passersby), places, architecture and experiences Alamo-Costello encountered in Chicago over a 25-year period\u2014many compiled through over 170 artist/musician interviews and portraits\u2014along with essays from four writers mirroring the city's diversity and energy. == Publishing and writing == Alamo-Costello launched The COMP Magazine, a digital publication focusing on art and design, in 2014 with Egzon Shaqiri.
