    "text": "La Comuna (The Commune) was a controversial Mexican rock band formed by a highly intellectual, multidisciplinary and idealistic group of individuals who were part of the counterculture movement known as La Onda (The Wave). == Origins and influences == Influenced by classical music, jazz and rock acts like Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd and Procol Harum, La Comuna was formed in 1969 in Mexico City. After playing at local parties they switched to perform concerts playing original materials and singing in both English and Spanish. They soon gained national notoriety after winning the second place at the Festival Pop del Naranjazo, losing the first prize to jazz-rock band Tinta Blanca. == Recording and touring == They signed a record contract in 1971 with Peerless Records and recorded an EP. A single of their hit song No hay ma\u00f1ana (There is no tomorrow) was also produced. They often toured with other La Onda bands like Three Souls in my Mind and El Amor, La Comuna being notorious for their often long improvisations and happenings of 30 minutes long mixing poetry and visual arts. As it happened with their peers, the band Peace and Love, they were one of the few La Onda music acts that were allowed to perform at Mexico's most prestigious hall for the performing arts; El Palacio de Bellas Artes (The Palace of Fine Arts). == Collapse == Due to their radical views of society and their own strict counterculture values, they refused to appear six times in a row on the famous Telesistema Mexicano program Siempre en Domingo, hosted by Ra\u00fal Velasco. This caused Peerless to cancel their projected LP and the band was soon without a record contract eventually disbanding in 1975 due to lack of work opportunities caused by the Avandarazo phenomenon and the end of the hippie trend worldwide. == Brief comeback == In the 1980s, Blanco, Mekler and Darszon formed Las Plumas At\u00f3micas playing in cultural hubs around Mexico City. They resumed to play from time to time until the mid-2000s. == Discography == *La Comuna, extended play, Peerlees 1971 *\"No hay ma\u00f1ana\", single, Peerless 1971 == Notable members == *Alberto Blanco: Musician, chemist, painter and poet.
