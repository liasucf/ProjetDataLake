Operation Atlantic Resolve, though not a \"named\" operation, is ongoing efforts in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, mainly the War in Donbass. It is funded under the European Deterrence Initiative.

A NATO deployment in the early January 2017 was welcomed by Polish officials who described it as a necessary response to Russian military exercises near its border and its military intervention in Ukraine and members of the public as the materiel crossed into south-western Poland from Germany. The same deployment sparked protests in Germany and prompted a critical reaction among the country\u2019s centre-left political parties, but was defended by the country\u2019s ruling Christian Democrat Party (CDU) coalition and German military officials. An article about the deployment that was published by the Donbas News International (DNI) agency and its subsequent circulation in the Western conspiracy-theory cybersphere and Russian mediasphere was cited as an example of the creation and spread of fake news. An editorial by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette cautioned anyone against using the deployment as a domestic political tool. ==See also== *Fort Trump ==References== == External links == * * Category:2010s in Europe Category:Military operations involving NATO Category:Military operations of the 21st-century Category:Ukraine\u2013United States relations Category:War in Donbass ",
