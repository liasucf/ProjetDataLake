Most of his work was published in Paris from 1633 to 1635. Among his colleagues were Melchior Tavernier (1594\u20131665), S\u00e9bastien Cramoisy (1584\u20131669) and Michael van Lochum (1601\u20131647). Little is known of his personal life. == Career == Up to 1631 Christophe Tassin was a French Royal Engineer and Geographer (Ingenieur et Geographe du Roy)., working on assigned political and military projects. As part of his appointment, he received the right to publish his work for ten years, though he used it only for 1633\u20131638. (His successor as Royal Engineer and Geographer and publisher was S\u00e9bastien de Beaulieu [1612\u20131674].) In 1633 Tassin published an atlas of France and Spain, Cartes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis des provinces de France et d\u2019 Espagne; one of Germany, Cartes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis des royaumes et provinces de la haute et basse Allemagna; and one of the Low Countries, Plans et profils des principales villes du duch\u00e9 de Lorraine, avec les cartes generale et partuculieres de chacun gouvernement d\u2019iucelles. View of Amiens in 1634 In 1634 he published an atlas with maps and drawings of cities and other places in France, Les plans et profils de toutes les principales villes et lieux considerables de France, and a coastal atlas of France Carte g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de toutes les costes de France. In 1635 he published at atlas of Switzerland, . His inclusion of the low countries in a single volume had a practical reason: In 1631 a great part of the region had been conquered by King Louis XIII of France, which caused a need for rapidly published information. In 1644 Tassin ended his work, and sold his copper plates of maps to Antoine de Fer (16xx\u20131673), who published them in many subsequent editions. == References == * Wolfgang Reiniger: Beaulieu: Die Kupferstiche zu den Feldz\u00fcgen Ludwig XIV., insbesondere zu denen in Deutschland: Katalog, W.
