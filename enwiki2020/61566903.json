    "text": "The V\u00e4rldsungdomsspelen (translation: World Youth Games), also known as the Gothenburg Youth Games, is an annual youth outdoor track and field competition open to the public, with age category competitions between the ages of twelve and nineteen, as well as senior level events. First organised in 1996, it is held over three days each July at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg. It is a mass participation event, typically attracting around 3500 mostly Swedish athletes, and its popularity has led to the introduction of qualifying standards for the throwing events.Gothenburg Youth Games 28-30/6 2019, Ullevi Arena in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.
