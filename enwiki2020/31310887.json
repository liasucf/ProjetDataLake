The name is attributed to the village of Rubielos de la C\u00e9rida located in the central uplift of the most northerly part of the structure. Originally the Rubielos de la C\u00e9rida structure was limited to and described as a 40 km-diameter circular impact crater with a prominent central uplift but is now considered to comprise a whole crater chain forming an impact basin accompanied by a central uplift chain., Ernstson, K., Sch\u00fcssler, U., Claudin, F., and Ernstson, T. (2003). An impact crater chain in northern Spain. Meteorite, 9, no 3, 35-39. In the eastern part, the morphology of the original basin is in parts buried beneath post-impact Neogene sediments. Conventionally, the impact basin is considered to represent tectonic structures, the Jiloca-Calatayud graben and the Alfambra-Teruel graben. Since a tectonic graben is typically characterized by tensional features, the common interpretation meets basic difficulties with the structurally dominant compressive style that was observed. ==Impact features== The impact nature is documented by impact melt rocks, suevite, abundant polymictic and monomictic breccias, breccia dikes (dike breccias), extensive megabreccias, impact ejecta, dislocated megablocks, peculiar geological structures in the rim and central uplift zones, and shock metamorphism. Shock effects comprise melt glass, diaplectic glass from quartz and feldspar, planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz and feldspar and moderate shock effects like intense kink banding and multiple sets of planar fractures (PFs) in quartz, multiple sets of kink bands in mica, and intense micro-twinning in calcite. Moderately developed shatter cones add to the impact signature. ==Controversy== The origin of the Rubielos de la C\u00e9rida structure has been debated, and Spanish geologists still remain opposed to an impact origin.Cort\u00e9s A.

In their opinion and with regard to the Spanish impact event, the shock effects are tectonic features, the impact ejecta are Cenozoic alluvial fans or conglomerates and supposed impact breccias and dike breccias are interpreted as karst features and soil formations. The opposition against the impact origin for Rubielos de la C\u00e9rida (and Azuara) has been supported by an analysis and paper (Langenhorst & Deutsch 1996)Langenhorst F. and Deutsch A.

Despite the impact evidence for Rubielos de la C\u00e9rida underlined by the occurrence of strong shock metamorphism, the crater (like Azuara) is not listed in the Canadian Earth Impact Database. Rubielos de la C\u00e9rida is however listed as a confirmed impact structure in other data bases, e.g. Moilanen,J.; Moilanen J.
