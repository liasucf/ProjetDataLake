    "text": "World on a Wire (German: Welt am Draht) is a 1973 science fiction television serial, starring Klaus L\u00f6witsch and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Shot in 16 mm, it was made for German television and originally aired in 1973, as a two-part miniseries. It was based on the 1964 novel Simulacron-3 by Daniel F. Galouye. An adaptation of the Fassbinder version was presented as the play World of Wires, directed by Jay Scheib, in 2012. Its focus is not on action, but on sophistic and philosophic aspects of the human mind, simulation, and the role of scientific research. A movie based on the same novel entitled The Thirteenth Floor starring Craig Bierko was released in 1999. == Plot == In the present day, Cybernetics and Future Science's (Institut f\u00fcr Kybernetik und Zukunftsforschung) new supercomputer hosts a simulation program that includes an artificial world with over 9,000 \"identity units\" who live as human beings, unaware that their world is just a simulation. Professor Vollmer (Adrian Hoven), who is technical director of the program, is apparently on the verge of an incredible secret discovery. He becomes increasingly agitated and anti- social before dying in a mysterious accident. His successor, Dr. Fred Stiller, has a discussion with G\u00fcnther Lause, the security adviser of the institute, when the latter suddenly disappears without trace, before passing on Vollmer's secret to Stiller. More mysterious still is the fact that none of the other IKZ employees seem to have any memory of Lause. Meanwhile, one of the identity units in the simulation attempts suicide. This unit is deleted by Stiller's colleague Walfang, to keep the simulation stable. To investigate the reasons for the suicide, Stiller contacts the contact unit of the simulated world. The unit, called Einstein, is the only identity unit who knows about the simulation, and this is necessary to run the program. In an attempt to become a real person, Einstein switches his mind into Walfang's body while Stiller is in contact with the simulated world. Einstein gives Stiller an explanation for the mysteries, vanishing memories, and vanishing persons. He tells him that the real world is nothing else but a simulation of a real world that is one level above. This knowledge causes Stiller to slip into insanity. The other \"real\" people interrogate Stiller, and he is threatened with death, incarceration, and involuntary commitment. Stiller is finally able to convince Hahn, the IKZ psychologist, of his theory. The latter soon dies in an accident that is pinned on Stiller, marking him as the suspected murderer of both Hahn and Vollmer. Stiller flees and searches for the necessary contact unit who can connect the \"real\" world with the real world a level above. He survives several assassination attempts and discovers the contact is Eva, projected into the simulation as Vollmer's daughter after his death, with whom he believed he had once had a romance. Eva tells him he was modeled on the real Fred Stiller, a person whom Eva loved, but became mad with power from directing the simulation in the world above. While Stiller is programmed to die in an ambush, Eva switches the minds of the two Stillers and brings the simulated Stiller into the real world. == Music == The martial folk song \"Westerwaldlied\" and standard German love song \"Lili Marleen\" are both featured in an extended scene in which Stiller seeks temporary respite in a cabaret. The instrumental \"Albatross\" by Fleetwood Mac plays during the credits of both parts, as well as a scene in Part 2. == Cast == * Klaus L\u00f6witsch as Fred Stiller * Mascha Rabben as Eva Vollmer * Karl-Heinz Vosgerau as Herbert Siskins * Adrian Hoven as Professor Henry Vollmer * Ivan Desny as G\u00fcnther Lause * Barbara Valentin as Gloria Fromm * G\u00fcnter Lamprecht as Fritz Walfang * Margit Carstensen as Maya Schmidt-Gentner * Wolfgang Schenck as Franz Hahn * Joachim Hansen as Hans Edelkern * Gottfried John as Einstein * Rudolf Lenz as Hartmann * Kurt Raab as Mark Holm * Karl Scheydt as Detective Stuhlfauth * Ernst K\u00fcsters Bodyguard * El Hedi ben Salem Bodyguard * Rainer Hauer as Inspector Lehner * Ulli Lommel as Rupp * Heinz Meier as Von Weinlaub * Ingrid Caven as Uschi * Eddie Constantine as Man in car * Rainer Langhans as Waiter at party == Release == A completely restored version was shown at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival in 2010.
