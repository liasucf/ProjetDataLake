    "text": "Providence Canyon State Outdoor Recreation Area is a Georgia state park located in Stewart County in southwest Georgia. The park contains Providence Canyon, which is sometimes called Georgia's \"Little Grand Canyon\". It is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. Providence Canyon actually is not a purely natural feature\u2014the massive gullies (the deepest being 150 feet) were caused by erosion due to poor farming practices in the 19th century. It is also home to the very rare plumleaf azalea. This old story of the origin of the canyons has been commonplace since the 1940s. Although there were probably a few early arrivals before 1825, the first heavy influx of settlers in Stewart county came after the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825) by which the Creek Indians were forced to cede all their lands east of the Chattahoochee river. Evidence of the existence of the canyons is their mention in a deed by James S Lunsford to William Tatam recorded in 1836. The park lies on marine sediments\u2014usually loamy or clayey, with small areas of sand. Loamy sand topsoils overlie subsoils of sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in most of the uneroded section. Nankin, Cowarts, Mobila, and Orangeburg are the most prominent soil series. The canyons have much exposure of clay, over which water often seeps. Water is mobile in this well-drained area. One of the quirkier attractions of the state park is an abandoned homestead including nearly a dozen rusty, 1950s-era cars and trucks. Due to the environmental damage that removing the vehicles would cause, park officials have decided to leave them alone. ==Facilities== * * 2 picnic shelters * 6 back country campsites * 3 pioneer campsites ==Yearly events== * Christmas Workshop (December) * Astronomy Night (September) * Fall Wildflower Day (October) * Geology Day (October) ==Images== Image:15 15 173 providence canyon.jpg|Entrance Sign Image:15 08 118 providence canyon.jpg|Providence Methodist Church Image:16_07_001_providence_canyon.jpg|Interior of Providence Methodist Church Image:15 08 154 providence canyon.jpg|View from canyon rim Image:Providence Canyon floor.jpg|View from the canyon floor Image:15 27 0250 providence canyon.jpg|Informational sign Image:Providence Canyon old car.jpg|Rusted car Image:Providence canyon car1.jpg|1950s-era car ==See also== *Red Bluff, Mississippi ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * Category:Canyons and gorges of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:State parks of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Protected areas of Stewart County, Georgia Category:Landforms of Stewart County, Georgia ",
