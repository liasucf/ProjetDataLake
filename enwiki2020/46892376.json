They were labeled with the inscription (\"Post of the USSR\"). In the thematics, Soviet stamps reflected to a large extent the history, politics, economics and culture of this world's first socialist state. Notable designers of Soviet postage stamps were Ivan Dubasov (who designed the Lenin Mourning issue, the first stamps portraying Vladimir Lenin in 1924) and Vasily Zavyalov. By the mid 1970s, over 4,000 stamps came out in the USSR. In 1970, the Catalogue of Postage Stamps of the USSR, 1918\u20131969 was published in Moscow, the yearly supplements being produced afterwards. The history and design of Soviet postage stamps were elucidated in the annual publication Soviet Collector and the monthly magazine Filateliya SSSR. == First stamps == The first postage stamps of the newly proclaimed Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were designed by Georgy Pashkov and issued in August 1923 in relation to the First All-Russian Agricultural and Handicraft Exhibition.

The first series of the USSR definitive stamps known as the Gold Standard issue appeared in October 1923. Their design proposed by Ivan Shadr included the busts of the worker, Red Army soldier and peasant. Also, there was a plan to sell more stamps in the international market. By targeting stamps for sales abroad, the Soviet government reckoned on earning hard currency.

Stamp denominations continued including international postage rates. For instance, most new issues during 1939 and 1940 had face values between 10 and 30 kopecks, i.e. more than those for standard internal postage.

It was usually done in two ways: * dedicating stamps to numerous remarkable Party members, both the living and the deceased, * placing the Party slogans and resolutions.

File:Stamp of USSR 0879.jpg|\"Long live the victory of the Anglo- Soviet-American fighting alliance! (Stalin)\", a 1943 stamp marking the Tehran Conference. Vladimir Lenin was pictured on Soviet stamps most often among the Bolsheviks, with the first Leniniana stamps appeared after his death on January 1924. Lifetime images of Party members on stamps were used to emphasize the theme of state power. One of such examples was a 1935 set of stamps commemorating Mikhail Kalinin's 60th birthday and depicting him as a worker, a farmer, and an orator. These Kalinin stamps illustrated the motive powers of the Soviet state: the worker, the farmer, and the Communist Party. Such a practice is considered a worldwide trend when in-power politicians are shown on postage stamps symbolizing the state. The Party slogans and resolutions on Soviet stamps changed over time. Earlier stamp themes in the 1920s reflected, though indirectly, the spirit of New Economic Policy. Since 1929, stamps had been used for a clear declaration of the changed economic policies. When Joseph Stalin initiated industrialisation, a special set of stamps was issued to support this effort. For example, the 10-kopecks stamp showed a series of tractors, saying \"Let us increase the harvest by 35%\". An inscription on the 20-kopecks stamp called for \"More metal, more machines!\". The 28-kopecks stamp pictured a blast furnace, a chart for iron-ore production and the slogan \"Iron, 8 million tons\".

A 1946 stamp issue summoned: \"Give the country annually 127 million tons of grain\", \"60 million tons of oil\", \"60 million tons of steel\", \"500 million tons of coal\", and \"50 million tons of cast iron\". File:Stamp of USSR 1082.jpg|\"Give the country annually 127 million tons of grain\", 1946 File:The Soviet Union 1962 CPA 2963 stamp (Animal industries, Decisions of the XXII Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\u2014into Life).jpg|\"By 1980 livestock, cattle and chickens will be significantly increased. Production of meat will grow almost 4 times, milk almost 3 times\", 1962 Short heroic slogans of the Stalin period calling for economic mobilization were substituted on Soviet stamps in the post-Stalin years. Party platforms with rather lengthy excerpts from Party documents and congresses' resolutions appeared on stamps at that time. Such was, for instance, the series of \"Decisions of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\u2014into Life\" that was designed by Vasily Zavyalov and A. Shmidshtein, and issued in 1962. In later years, the style of stamp messages continued, differing from those of the Stalin times. They were no longer brief imperative commands but rather promises and explanations by the Party to Soviet society. For example, on a 1971 souvenir sheet from the 24th Party Congress series designed by Yu. Levinovsky and A. Shmidshtein, there was an inscription saying that \"the main problem is to provide a significant increase of the material and cultural level of life of the people on the basis of high rates of development of socialist production, an increase of its effectiveness, scientific-technical progress, and an acceleration of the growth of the productiveness of labor\". Such messages were typical of stamps for the Brezhnev and post-Brezhnev period until the changes occurred under Mikhail Gorbachev. New slogans, \"perestroika\", \"uskoreniye\", \"demokratizatsiya\", and \"glasnost\", were coined and appeared on the postage stamps of the USSR. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+colspan=2|Perestroyka issues of 1988 |-style=\"text-align:center; font- size:80%\" |rowspan=2|290px |290px |- |290px |} File:Stamp of USSR 1918.jpg|1956 Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR File:1980.

Designed by Vasily Zavyalov A unique complete pane of 25 early Soviet Union stamps is known as Soviet Air Post \"Wide 5\" surcharged. The stamp itself was produced in 1924 as a surcharge of 10 kopecks on 5-ruble green type II, basic stamp wide \"5\". In 1925, a 15-kopeck yellow stamp of \"Peasant\" design was printed in a very small quantity within the Gold Standard issue. Named Limonka, it is considered very rare, especially if in mint condition.

Its design was created by Vasily Zavyalov. In 1932, the All-Soviet Philatelic Exhibition was organized in Moscow. On that occasion, a souvenir sheet of four stamps known as Personalised Kartonka was produced on thick card, with three-line overprint \"To the best shock worker of the All Russian Philatelic Society \u2013 President of the Moscow Philatelic Organization E.M. Nurk\". It is considered rare because only 25 souvenir sheets were issued. A San Francisco inverted surcharge with small Cyrillic \"\u0444\" (\"f\") is characteristic of a rare Soviet stamp called Levanevsky with overprint. Possibly unique, it was designed by Vasily Zavyalov and issued in 1935.
