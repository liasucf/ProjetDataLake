Although he primarily played wide receiver at Cal, he chose to transition to tight end. He was limited to performing the bench press, vertical jump, and broad jump due to a hamstring injury. Anderson was the lightest tight end and tied UCLA's Thomas Duarte as the shortest of the tight ends at 6'2\". Among his position group at the combine, he finished first in the vertical jump (38\"), fourth in the broad jump (9'11\"), and tenth in the bench press (16). On March 18, 2016, Anderson opted to participate at Cal's pro day, along with Jared Goff, Bryce Treggs, Daniel Lasco, Maurice Harris, Kenny Lawler, Trevor Davis, Kyle Kragen, Stefan McClure, Darius Powe, and two others. His performance in the 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, and 10-yard dash would've finished first among his position group at the combine. Anderson's time in the three-cone drill would've garnered him fourth place. He also ran positional drills and caught passes for the team representatives and scouts from all 32 NFL teams. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Anderson was projected to be selected as early as the fourth to fifth round or as late as the sixth to seventh round. He was ranked as the top fullback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. ===Houston Texans=== Anderson went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft.

Anderson received a bulk of first team reps during training camp after C. J. Fiedorowicz and Ryan Griffin missed stretches of camp due to injuries. Head coach Bill O'Brien named Anderson the Texans' third tight end, behind C. J. Fiedorowicz and Ryan Griffin, to begin the regular season. Offensive coordinator George Godsey developed a hybrid H-back role for Anderson, better utilizing his speed and receiving ability. He made his professional regular season debut in the Houston Texans' season- opener against the Chicago Bears and caught three passes for 25-yards during the 23-14 victory. He made his first career reception at the start of the second quarter, catching a 12-yard pass from Brock Osweiler before being tackled by Bears' safety Adrian Amos. In Week 3, Anderson suffered a hamstring injury during the Texans' 27-0 loss at the New England Patriots. Unfortunately, the injured hamstring caused him to miss the next three games (Weeks 4-6). On November 13, 2016, Anderson caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Brock Osweiler, as the Texans defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 24-21. He was wide open for the touchdown reception after Brock Osweiler rolled out and caused the Jaguars to blow their coverage. He finished his rookie season in with a total of 11 receptions for 93 receiving yards and one touchdown in 13 games and zero starts. The Houston Texans finished atop the AFC South with a 9-7 record in 2016. On January 7, 2017, Anderson made his playoff debut in the Texans 24-17 AFC Wildcard victory over the Oakland Raiders. They were eliminated the following game after losing a 34-16 game to the eventual Super Bowl LI Champions the New England Patriots. ====2017==== He competed for a roster spot throughout training camp against Rashaun Allen, Evan Baylis, and Zach Conque. He was named the Texans' third tight end on their depth chart behind Fiedorowicz and Griffin. He earned his first career start in the Houston Texans' season-opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars and caught two passes for 14-yards before leaving the game after suffering a concussion. C. J. Fiedorowicz and Ryan Griffin also suffered concussions during the Texans' 29-7 loss. He remained in concussion protocol and was inactive for the Texans' Thursday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals four days later. On October 8, 2017, Anderson caught two passes for a season-high 63-yards in Houston's 42-34 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Anderson became the second tight end on the Texans' depth chart after C.
