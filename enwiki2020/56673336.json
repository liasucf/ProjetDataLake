It was in her job that she met a Jewish friend, through who she was introduced to a Jewish circle of leftist Hashomer Hatzair. This group of Jewish and non-Jewish Communist friends formed in 1943 the resistance group P\u0159ehledy. Among them, H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 met Jany Lebovi\u010d from eastern part of Czechoslovakia, with whom she fell in love. When the transports to Theresienstadt started in fall 1941, H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 and her family helped the deportees with food and preparation for transports.Bo\u0159ivoj \u010celovsk\u00fd, ed., Alenka: K osmdes\u00e1tin\u00e1m dr Aleny H\u00e1jkov\u00e9 (\u0160enov u Ostravy: Tilia, 2004), festschrift Later, the gentiles in the group supported the Jewish members avoid transports under a false, non-Jewish identity. Among those who had gone to hiding was Lebovi\u010d. H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 participated in help for Jewish friends and other resistance: in the first months of Terez\u00edn ghetto, she visited a few times and smuggled food to her friends. Later, she actively organized papers for those who went into illegality. In March 1944, she was arrested and deported to Small Fortress Theresienstadt and in July 1944 to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. Before her liberation in April 1945, she was forced to do forced labor for the German armament industry, firm Hasag in the Schlieben and Altenburg satellite camps of Buchenwald. H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 escaped in April 1945 from a death march during a bomb raid in Zwickau. ==Postwar== Upon her return to Prague, H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 learned that her fianc\u00e9 had been arrested together with most of the P\u0159ehledy in August 1944, and murdered in Auschwitz. She and a friend from P\u0159ehledy, Milo\u0161 H\u00e1jek, married and had two sons. Her granddaughter Anna is a historian at the University of Warwick. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1971. She started studying in 1945 at the University of Political and Social Affairs (Vysok\u00e1 \u0161kola politick\u00e1 a soci\u00e1ln\u00ed), but her studies were interrupted when her children were born. Via long distance, H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 studied history at the Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University and, in 1960, received her PhD. All the while, she was supporting her husband who was doing academic career. In 1952, at the height of Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trials, she was one of the few who supported her friends when they were arrested. In 1960, she started working full time as historian: until 1965, she worked as lecturer of humanities at \u010cVUT, next five years at the Czechoslovak committee for history of antifascists resistance. During normalization, she spent her last working years as specialist in the defense ministry, where it was her job to write confirmations about participation in resistance according to the law 255/1946. This law enabled many former resistance fighters, who were now dissidents, to live on an early pension. ==Research== H\u00e1jkov\u00e1's expertise was leftist and Communist resistance in Second World War; she focused on individual people and wrote about Jewish Communist resistance fighters who were politically unpopular. Her books and articles are still in circulation, unlike most of contemporary Czech scholarship. In 1989, H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 was reunited with her old Jewish friends from resistance who had emigrated to Israel and US. In 1991, she was awarded the title Righteous among the nations.\" In 1995, she coedited a critical edition of Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk's Notes from the Gallows. She cooperated with Miroslav K\u00e1rn\u00fd on researching the Holocaust and resistance in the Protectorate, and contributed to the research of the Terez\u00edn Memorial, including their prisoner database. H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 continued researching until her 80s; and died in Prague in 2012. Her papers are at the Czech National Archive. ==Publications== * * * * * * * * == References == * Dalibor St\u00e1tn\u00edk, \"Spravedliv\u00e1 mezi n\u00e1rody: Alena H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 (1942-2012),\" D\u011bjiny a sou\u010dasnost 34,9, (2012), p. 6 == External links == *H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 FAMILY - at Yad Vashem website Category:Czech communists Category:1924 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Czech Righteous Among the Nations Category:People from Prague Category:Czech historians Category:Czech resistance members Category:Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp survivors Category:Historians of the Czech Republic ",
