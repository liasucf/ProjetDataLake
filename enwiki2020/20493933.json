    "text": "Danijel Stojanovi\u0107 (born 18 August 1984) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as a left-back. A part from playing as a left-back as his main position, he can even play in a more advanced left wing-back role. ==Career== Stojanovi\u0107 began his professional football career at the youth team of Croatian 1. HNL club Cibalia, where he played for two years under a youth contract. In 2005, he earned his first professional contract with, at the time, Bosnian Premier League side Posu\u0161je. In the three years he spent at the club, for the most time Stojanovi\u0107 was the first choice left-back and made 55 league appearances, scoring five goals. These performances merited a move to the ambitious club Zrinjski Mostar in 2008. He was immediately a starter for the club. In the title winning season of 2008\u201309, Stojanovi\u0107 made 29 appearances and scored six goals while in the previous season, due to injuries he managed only 17 league appearances. At the end of the 2009\u201310 season, his contract with Zrinjski came to an end and so Stojanovi\u0107 decided to continue his career in Portugal, signing as a free agent on a two-year deal with Nacional. He became only the second Zrinjski Mostar player to move to Portugal, after Lamine Diarra made the switch in 2007. He struggled to acclimatise to the speed and quality of the Portuguese Primeira Liga and only made 19 appearances during his time at the club. He then moved back to his homeland, signing for Hajduk Split as a replacement for the departing R\u00faben Lima. Stojanovi\u0107 was officially unveiled as a new player of Hajduk on 4 July 2012. He won the Croatian Cup with the club in May 2013. In June 2013, Stojanovi\u0107's contract with Hajduk was terminated, and on 29 December 2013, he returned to Zrinjski Mostar. He played for Zrinjski until January 2017, winning 2 more league titles in the process. After Zrinjski, Stojanovi\u0107 spent a short time with \u017deljezni\u010dar from January to June 2017. In June 2017, he signed a contract with, at the time, First League of FBiH club Olimpik. Stojanovi\u0107 scored his first goal for Olimpik on 19 May 2019, in a 6\u20131 home league win against TO\u0160K Te\u0161anj. On 26 May 2020, the 2019\u201320 First League of FBiH season ended abruptly due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina and, by default, Stojanovi\u0107 with Olimpik were crowned league champions and got promoted back to the Bosnian Premier League. After his contract with the club expired, he left Olimpik on 15 June 2020. ==Honours== Zrinjski Mostar *Bosnian Premier League: 2008\u201309, 2013\u201314, 2015\u201316 Hajduk Split *Croatian Cup: 2012\u201313 Olimpik *First League of FBiH: 2019\u201320 ==References== ==External links== *Danijel Stojanovi\u0107 at Sofascore Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Na\u0161ice Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Portugal Category:Expatriate footballers in Portugal Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:Croatian Second Football League players Category:Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina players Category:HNK Cibalia players Category:NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac players Category:H\u0160K Posu\u0161je players Category:H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar players Category:C.D.
