    "text": "The Million Dollar Band (sometimes shortened to MDB) is the official marching band of the University of Alabama. Founded in 1912, the Million Dollar Band is the largest student organization at the University of Alabama. The band performs during pregame and halftime of every home and neutral-site Alabama football game; it also supplies at least a pep band to every away football game, as well as home men's basketball, women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and volleyball games. In 2003, the band was awarded the Sudler Trophy, recognizing it as the top college band in the United States. == History == The band performing its pregame show prior to a football game in 2010. The Million Dollar Band, which was first known simply as the \"Alabama Band\", was formed as a military band in 1912. In its first year, the band consisted of just 14 members under director Dr. Gustav Wittig, who was also an engineering and physics professor at the university. He served as director for five years before stepping down; the band was then student-led until 1927, when Captain H. H. Turner took over as director. The story of how the band earned its name is contested, but the account recognized by the university (released in the 1948 football media guide) is as follows: during the 1922 football season, Alabama visited Georgia Tech and got blown out, 33\u20137. Champ Pickens, a notable Alabama alumnus who was present at the game, was asked by a local sportswriter, \"You don't have much of a team, what do you have at Alabama?\". In response, Pickens quipped, \"A million dollar band.\" His inspiration for the term came from his observation of the impressive effort the small band had put into soliciting funds from local merchants in order to accompany the football team to off-campus games. In 1936, Colonel Carleton K. Butler (for whom the band\u2019s practice field is named) took over the band and led it to national prominence among collegiate marching bands. He remained director for the next 33 years until Earl Dunn took charge in 1969. After Dunn\u2019s two-year stint at the Capstone, Dr. James Ferguson was named director, where he remained until 1983. Alabama coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant often voiced his support for the band during his tenure, sometimes partially crediting it after victories. Dr. Kenneth Ozzello has been in charge of the band since 2002, taking over for Kathryn B. Scott. One year after he was named director, the band won the Sudler Trophy, awarded by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. === Directors === {| class=wikitable ! Name !!

The Leadership team responds with \"Go Bama!\" and then all members shout \"Roll Tide!\" This is similar to a scene from the 1995 movie Crimson Tide. *Elephant Stomp - Prior to every home game the MDB performs the elephant stomp. Each section warms up then meets on the steps of the Gorgas library. The MDB and cheerleaders lead the crowd in several cheers in a short pep rally, usually lasting less than 10 minutes. The MDB then lines up on Colonial Drive and marches to Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium. *Big B-A-M-A Spellout - During the Pregame show, the PA announcer directs the crowd to shoutout 'B', 'A', 'M', 'A' while the band forms the block letters on the field. == Songs and Cheers == *Yea Alabama - The University of Alabama's official fight song. *Tusk - This song was recorded by Fleetwood Mac in collaboration with the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band at Dodger Stadium. From the Fleetwood Mac version, \"Tusk\" being shorthand for the university's home city of Tuscaloosa, accompanied by the school's dancing elephant mascot, Big Al. The band forms a large elephant on the field, with Big AL being introduced to the crowd of 100,000+ fans. *Rammer Jammer Cheer - (informally known as the \"Ole Miss Cheer\") is played at the end-of-the game, after the team has won the game. Dr. Ferguson introduced the cheer to the band during the early 1980s. The lyrics to the cheer were based upon the Ole Miss' Hotty Toddy cheer, the school which Dr. Ferguson was teaching at prior to coming to Bama. *Basket Case - Beginning in mid-1996, the Million Dollar Band began playing a Fred Chang arrangement of the Green Day song \"Basket Case\" in the break between the 3rd and 4th quarters. This continued until midway through the 2006 season, when the Marketing Department decided to play \"Sweet Home Alabama\" over the PA system instead. The MDB continued to play the song, just at different points of the game. \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was still played during 2007 up to the Houston game. Since that game the MDB has played \"Basketcase\" during the 4th quarter break once again. *Low Rider - Song played by the Trombone section in the fourth quarter of the football game. It has been in existence since at least 1986, when it was recorded on an LP. Mark Foster wrote the arrangement from a similar version that was played at his high school. *Defense Cheer # 1 - Since 2002, the band has used the song \"Look Down\" from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables as the main defense cheer. This arrangement was taken from the 1996 \"Les Miserables\" Halftime Show. The band currently has six defense cheers. *The band also plays upon occasion You Can Call Me Al, the theme from the TV show The A-Team and My Home's in Alabama from the country group, Alabama. == Band Recordings == *Million Dollar Band LP - [1986?] *Million Dollar Band CD - [1993] The band's first professional produced CD. *Million Dollar Band CD - [1998] *Million Dollar Band CD - [2002] Tribute CD to Kathryn Scott's career as director of the MDB. *Million Dollar Band CD - [2003-present] Under the direction of Dr. Ken Ozello, the band produces a CD every year which includes the three halftime performances of that year, pregame music, stand tunes, and other school songs. == Appearances == Clemson marching band prior to the 2008 Chick-fil-A College Kickoff.
