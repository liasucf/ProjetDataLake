The northern area roughly corresponded to the present day Sunnm\u00f8re District Court. The name of the northern court was later changed to simply Sunnm\u00f8re District Court. In 1967, the municipalities of Ulstein and Hareid were transferred from the S\u00f8re Sunnm\u00f8re District Court to the Sunnm\u00f8re District Court. ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:District courts of Norway Category:Organisations based in \u00c5lesund ",
