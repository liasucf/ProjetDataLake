Rough Guides, 2010. == Name == Several explanations are behind the name Kuopio. The first is that in the 16th century, a certain influential person named Kauhanen in Tavinsalmi changed his name to Skopa and the people's pronunciation was Coopia and finally Cuopio. The second explanation is that it comes from the verb kuopia, meaning \"paw\", as when a horse paws the ground with its hoof. A third explanation is that it came from a certain Karelian man's name Prokopij, from Ruokolahti in the Middle Ages. This explanation is the most likely, and is supported by the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. == History == In the 1550s, under the influence of Mikael Agricola, a church and a parish were founded in Kuopionniemi. Governor Peter Brahe founded the city of Kuopio in 1653, but the official date is recognized as 17 November 1775, when King Gustav III of Sweden ordered the formal establishment of the city. The period of Russian rule (1809\u20131917) brought notable transportation development within Eastern Finland. The Saimaa Canal (1856) opened up a summer route towards the Baltic Sea, and the Savo railroad (1889) improved transport in winter. Kuopio's old railway station building and passengers in 1910. After the World War II, the city's population grew significantly, due in part to the settlement of Karelian evacuees and the high birth rate. The rapid growth of the population forced the expansion of schools; at the end of the 1940s, support was also provided for school transportsKaupungin el\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4 1947 (in Finnish) and the provision of free school meals (the poor people had received it in Kuopio since 19021872 Koulun arkea: Rangaistukset (in Finnish)). The large number of young people and the occasional lack of activity also gave rise to various phenomena in the city, such as the Kuopio Market Riot in 1965.YLE: Torimellakka Kuopiossa 1965 (in Finnish)Erikoislehti kertoo: Miksi nuoriso riehui Kuopion torilla? - Savon Sanomat (in Finnish) In the 1960s, the first construction of the actual suburb, Puijonlaakso, began.

Winters are long and cold, with average highs staying below freezing from November until March, and summers are short and relatively mild. Most precipitation occurs in the late summer and early fall.
