    "text": "Min fanglei The Min fanglei () is an ancient Chinese bronze lei vessel from the late Shang dynasty or early Western Zhou dynasty (12th \u2013 11th century BC). It is one of the largest of its kind, and called the \"King of Fanglei\". After its accidental discovery in 1919 in Hunan, its lid remained in China but the body was sold to collectors overseas, and set a world-record auction price for an Asian art work in 2001 when it fetched US$9.24 million. In 2014, a group of Chinese collectors bought it for a price between US$20 and 30 million, and donated it to the Hunan Museum, where it was reunited with its lid. ==Description== The inscription inside the lid reads: \u76bf\u800c[or \u5929]\u5168\u4f5c\u7236\u5df1\u5c0a\u5f5d (Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji). The Min fanglei is dated to the late Shang dynasty or early Western Zhou dynasty (12th \u2013 11th century BC). It is a fanglei, or square or rectangular lei, a type of ancient Chinese ritual bronze vessel. The Min fanglei is tall, and its mouth measures . Without the lid, it is 64 cm (25 inches) tall and weighs 42 kg (92.5 pounds). It is finely decorated on each of its four sides, with pairs of dragons cast on its shoulders and a horned dragon mask on its handle. Because of its size and workmanship, it is called the \"King of Fanglei\". The fanglei is named for the bronze inscription inside its body, which reads \"Min zuo Fu Ji zun yi\" (), or \"Min made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji\". On the inside of its lid, the inscription has two extra characters: \"Min Er [or Tian] Quan zuo Fu Ji zun yi\" (\u76bf\u800c[or \u5929]\u5168\u4f5c\u7236\u5df1\u5c0a\u5f5d), or \"Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji\". ==Modern history== The Min fanglei was accidentally discovered in 1919 in Maoshanyu, Shuitian Township (now Jiaqiao Town), Taoyuan County, Hunan Province. According to local records, a boy named Ai Xinzhai () found the vessel lying partly exposed on a mountain slope and told his father Ai Qingyan (), who then dug it out. In 1924, Shi Yuzhang () bought the body of the vessel for a substantial sum. Ai Qingyan kept the lid, which he gave to his son's school, Xinmin School (), in lieu of tuition. The staff of the school read the inscription inside the lid and recognized its significance. After the Ta Kung Pao in Changsha reported the discovery of the artifact on June 11, 1925, Zhang Shizhao, the provincial education director, attempted to retrieve the vessel but was unable to locate it. Zhou Pan (), a local military officer, purchased the lid for 3,000 silver dollars. When Zhou was arrested in Kunming, Yunnan in 1950, the lid was confiscated and given to the Hunan Cultural Relics Management Committee, which was merged into Hunan Museum in 1956. In 1928, French scholar George Souli\u00e9 de Morant published A History of Chinese Art, which included a photograph of the Min fanglei (without the lid) and noted that it had been collected by prominent art dealers including C. T. Loo, A. W. Bahr, and C. F. Yau (). The vessel was bought by Japanese collector Umekichi Asano () in 1930, and then sold to Taiwanese-Japanese collector Munachi Nita (\u65b0\u7530\u680b\u4e00; Chinese name Peng Kaidong \u5f6d\u6977\u68df) in 1950. When Nita put it on auction with Christie's in 2001, Shanghai Museum and Poly Museum raised a large sum to make a bid for the vessel, but were outbid by a French collector for US$9.24 million. At the time it was a world-record price for an Asian artwork. In 2014, the Min fanglei was again put on auction by Christie's. On March 19, a day before the auction was scheduled to take place, Christie's announced that the owner had agreed to sell the vessel to a group of private Chinese collectors, who then donated it to Hunan Museum to be reunited with its lid, from which it had been separated for 90 years. Christie's did not disclose the sale price, but Sina News reported it to be US$20 million, while another estimate gave $30 million. On January 14, 2018, the Min fanglei was featured on the Chinese TV program National Treasure. ==Gallery== ==References== Category:Taojiang County Category:History of Yiyang Category:Collections of the Hunan Museum Category:Shang dynasty bronzeware Category:1919 archaeological discoveries ",
