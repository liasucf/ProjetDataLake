The electoral district was created in 1999 when provincial ridings were defined to have the same borders as federal ridings. It generally encompasses the western portion of Downtown Toronto. In the 2001 Canadian census, the riding had 106,094 people of which 74,409 were eligible to vote. Its Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) elect is Chris Glover of the Ontario New Democratic Party, who unseated short lived MPP Han Dong in the 2018 general election. Major landmarks within the riding include the western portion of the University of Toronto, the CN Tower, Rogers Centre (formerly Skydome), Air Canada Centre, the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, 299 Queen Street West, the Toronto Eaton Centre, the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Toronto City Hall, Kensington Market, Chinatown, Christie Pits, Trinity Bellwoods Park and Palmerston Boulevard. The riding is one of the most ethnically diverse in Canada containing the heart of Toronto's Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Italy and Little Portugal. The northern section of the riding is the trendy Annex district, while the eastern edge contains part of the University of Toronto and thousands of students. The riding has been the most left-leaning in Toronto and has voted NDP provincially for a number of years. In 2018, the district was dissolved into Spadina\u2014Fort York, University\u2014Rosedale and Toronto Centre. ==Demographics== Average family income: $81,415 Median family income: $50,047 Unemployment: 6.7% Language : English - 51%, French - 2%, Other - 45%, Multiple - 2% Language : English only - 75.3%, French only - < 0.1%, English and French - 15.4%, Neither English nor French - 9.1% Religion: Catholic - 32.1%, Protestant - 15%, other Christian - 5.3%, Buddhist - 5.2%, Jewish - 4.2%, Muslim - 2.8%, No religious affiliation - 32.9%, Other - 2.4% Visible Minority: Chinese - 18.2%, Black - 4%, South Asian - 3.5%, Southeast Asian - 1.8%, Filipino - 1.7%, Korean - 1.5%, Latin American - 1.5%, Others - 3.3% Immigrant Status: Non-immigrant - 52%, Immigrant - 45%, Non-permanent resident - 3% ==Geography== It consists of the Toronto Islands and the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Harbour, and on the west, north and east by a line drawn from the harbour north on Spencer Avenue, east along the Gardiner Expressway, north on Dufferin, east on Queen Street West, southeast along the Canadian Pacific Railway line, north along Dovercourt Road, east along Dundas Street West, north along Ossington Avenue, east along the Canadian Pacific Railway situated north of Dupont Street, south along Avenue Road and Queens Park Crescent West, east along College Street and south along Yonge Street to the Harbour. These borders were changed in the 2004 redistribution. The northwestern corner, a generally pro-NDP area was lost to Davenport. A large, but mostly business area of Toronto Centre\u2014Rosedale between University Avenue and Yonge St. was added to the riding. This region tends to support the Liberals. The Toronto Islands were also added to the riding from Toronto Centre\u2014Rosedale. This area is very strongly NDP and while it has a small population it is a highly activist one that provides many campaign workers for the New Democrats.

In Toronto's 2010 municipal elections, Adam Vaughan was re-elected for a second four-year term; the previous Ward 19 Councillor, Joe Pantalone, stood (unsuccessfully) for mayor.
