C\u2019est > sans doute aussi une forme de folie. C\u2019est moins spectaculaire, peut-\u00eatre, > mais je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que le public puisse aller \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel. Je ne veux pas > qu\u2019il s\u2019arr\u00eate \u00e0 la performance, tout en la remarquant, mais qu\u2019il puisse > s\u2019abandonner d\u2019abord \u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 de la musique. > There are two types of artists: those that strive their whole life to show > how much what they're doing is difficult - they [do] have their audience -, > then there are those who spend their life trying to make people believe it > is not at all difficult, which is the category I belong to.

I do > not want them to stop at [being impressed with] the performance, even though > they might notice it, but that they be able to abandon themselves to the > beauty of the music. ==Recordings== She has over fifty recordings on labels including EMI, Erato, Deutsche Grammophon, Harmonia Mundi, Philips, RCA and Sony and Virgin.
