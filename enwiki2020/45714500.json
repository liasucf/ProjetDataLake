From the year 2014 to 2016, as many as 60 partners steadily quit the KPMG India to join PwC, Deloitte and Ernst and Young. Increasing politicisation, some conflict of interest issues and arbitrary organisational changes,\" were among the reasons for the brewing disaffection. This sparked complaints by partners over Rekhy\u2019s management style, as a result Richard Rekhy\u2019s leadership role at KPMG India was curtailed by the KPMG Global leadership by handing over effective charge to deputy CEO Akhil Bansal. On 6 November 2016, a Week after the global leadership made changes to the KPMG India leadership team, Richard Rekhy, the incumbent CEO of the firm, advised KPMG India Board of his decision to retire as CEO of the India firm. In a statement, by accepting his retirement, the firm said: \"The India Board, after due deliberations and after recognising Richard\u2019s stellar professional and personal contributions to the India firm over the last many years as the CEO and in his prior leadership roles, respectfully accepted Richard\u2019s decision to retire.\" ==References== Category:Living people Category:University of Delhi alumni Category:Indian chief executives Category:KPMG people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
