Maps are 2D and in a top-down perspective. At the Hollow, the player can interact with the townsfolk, purchase food items that replenish the player's health at the Bakery, and progress the main plot.

Surrounding her are balloons and skull-masked figures in purple robes. Their leader, a non-human entity called Grimm, informs her that she has died and reincarnated as a Reaper in the game's town, the Hollow. The dead in this world can reincarnate as ghosts, or Reapers; a type of psychopomp who defeats ghosts. Lavender does not believe Grimm's story, and starts to think of escape as soon as he leaves. However, a ghost appears and tells her that her brother, Timmy, has arrived with her into the Hollow. The game begins with Lavender embarking on a journey to find her missing brother and return home. == References == Category:2019 video games Category:RPG Maker games Category:Windows-only freeware games Category:Windows games Category:Adventure games Category:Indie video games Category:Art games Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Single-player video games Category:Role-playing video games == External links == *Official website ",
