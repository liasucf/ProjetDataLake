The first congregation, named Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church, was established in 1969 by Father Dean Gigicos at 17 Old Pali Place. The church was named after Constantine the Great and St. Helena. By the 1980s the congregation grew and relocated to a larger facility. The current location of the cathedral was purchased by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in 1988. The church was consecrated in 1990 by Archbishop Iakovos, assisted by two Metropolitan bishops, two bishops, two priests, and an archdeacon. The cathedral's congregation is made up of Greek, Slavic, and Arabic Orthodox Christians, as well as local converts. The primary services are in English, Greek, and Slavonic.
