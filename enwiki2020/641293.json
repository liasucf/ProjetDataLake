    "text": "Green Eggs and Ham is a children's book by Dr. Seuss, first published on August 12, 1960. As of 2019, the book has sold 8 million copies worldwide. The story has appeared in several adaptations, starting with 1973's Dr. Seuss on the Loose starring Paul Winchell as the voice of both Sam-I-Am and the first- person narrator, Guy-Am-I, and more recently an animated TV series of the same name on Netflix starring the voices of Adam DeVine as Sam and Michael Douglas as Guy. ==Plot== A character named \"Sam-I-Am\" pesters an unnamed character to eat a dish of green eggs and ham. However he refuses while responding, \u201cI do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.\u201d He continues to repeat similar responses while Sam persistently follows him. Finally, the character accepts Sam\u2019s offer and samples the green eggs and ham. When he finds that he likes them, he ends the story, saying, \"I do so like green eggs and ham. Thank you. Thank you, Sam-I-Am.\" == Background == Green Eggs and Ham is one of Seuss's \"Beginner Books\", written with very simple vocabulary for beginning readers. The vocabulary of the text consists of just 50 words and was the result of a bet between Seuss and Bennett Cerf, Dr. Seuss's publisher, that Seuss (after completing The Cat in the Hat using 236 words) could not complete an entire book without exceeding that limit. The 50 words are: a, am, and, anywhere, are, be, boat, box, car, could, dark, do, eat, eggs, fox, goat, good, green, ham, here, house, I, if, in, let, like, may, me, mouse, not, on, or, rain, Sam, say, see, so, thank, that, the, them, there, they, train, tree, try, will, with, would, you. == Reception and cultural impact == Woman reading and showing Green Eggs and Ham to children.
