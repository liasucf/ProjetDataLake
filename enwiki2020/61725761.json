    "text": "Alexandru P. Mavrodi (December 7, 1881\u2013September 24, 1934) was a Romanian journalist, theater figure and politician. Born in Dorohoi, he studied dramatic arts at the Ia\u0219i Conservatory. He then earned two doctorates, in Law from Paris and in Philosophy from Bonn. He entered journalism in 1898, writing for several Ia\u0219i newspapers: Opinia, Evenimentul, Ordinea and Gazeta Moldovei,Nicolae Titulescu, Opera politico-diplomatic\u0103, p. 1121. Bucharest: Funda\u021bia European\u0103 Titulescu, 2003 where he became editor. In 1903, he became a \u201csecond-rate\u201d actor at the Ia\u0219i National Theatre. Initially unpaid, his roles were minor but demanded stage presence; the young actor was tall, spoke clearly and looked well in formal costume. Likely due to the insignificance of his roles, Mavrodi emerged as a malcontent, ready to defend perceived victims of injustice, particularly actresses \u201cinsulted\u201d by directors. He would respond to personal slights by recruiting seconds and asking for a duel. After leaving Ia\u0219i, he went to Paris, where he studied journalism for two years on a scholarship. Returning to Romania and moving to Bucharest, he briefly worked as a political reporter at Adev\u0103rul and Diminea\u021ba. He was chief editor and later manager of the official National Liberal journal Viitorul. There, he wrote about politics and reviewed plays under the pen name Alexandru Fronda (a character in Haralamb Lecca\u2019s play C\u00e2inii). While at Viitorul, he became embroiled in a scandal regarding the re-election of Duiliu Zamfirescu as President of the Chamber of Deputies. The newspaper\u2019s constant attacks on Zamfirescu prompted him to challenge Mavrodi to a duel, sending seconds to the editor\u2019s office. Mavrodi also chose seconds, but they were unable to agree to terms.Mihai Chiper, Pe c\u00e2mpul de onoare, e-book. Bucharest: Editura Humanitas, 2017, In 1915, he became director of the National Theater Bucharest and general director of theaters. He was brought in to save an institution in chaos and on the verge of bankruptcy; unlike his predecessors, he was an insider.Ioan Massoff, Teatrul rom\u00e2nesc: privire istoric\u0103, vol. V, p. 103. Bucharest: Editura pentru Literatur\u0103, 1974 He held this position until 1918, again in 1922-1923 and finally from 1931.George Enescu (ed. Laura Manolache), George Enescu: 1898-1936, p. 79. Bucharest: Editura Muzical\u0103, 1988 He was head of the Radio Society and of the journalists\u2019 union. A key member of King Carol II\u2019s camarilla, he was treasured by the king and Elena Lupescu for the information he provided regarding senior Liberal figures.Ioan Scurtu, Istoria rom\u00e2nilor \u00een timpul celor patru regi (1866-1947), p. 110. Bucharest: Editura Enciclopedic\u0103, 2004 He sat as a Liberal in the Chamber of Deputies (1931) and in the Senate. He was deputy state secretary in the prime minister\u2019s office from November 1933 until his death. ==Notes== Category:1881 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Dorohoi Category:University of Paris alumni Category:University of Bonn alumni Category:Camarilla (Carol II of Romania) Category:National Liberal Party (Romania) politicians Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Members of the Senate of Romania Category:Adev\u0103rul writers Category:Romanian newspaper editors Category:Chairpersons of the National Theatre Bucharest Category:Romanian male stage actors Category:Romanian theatre critics Category:Romanian trade union leaders ",
