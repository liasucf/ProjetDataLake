    "text": "The Janice Peaslee Bridge (formerly known as the Maidstone-Stratford Hollow BridgeNew Hampshire law renaming the Bridge) is a pin-connected steel & wrought iron Pratt through truss bridge crossing the Connecticut River between Stratford, New Hampshire and Maidstone, Vermont. == History and construction == The bridge was originally completed in 1893 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, East Berlin, Connecticut. It was closed \"temporarily\" in 1990 for safety reasons. Due to the perseverance of Vermont State Representative Janice L. Peaslee, it underwent a total rebuild which was completed in 2005. In order to facilitate reconstruction of the abutments, the bridge was placed on land for repairs while the foundations were rebuilt and a new approach was created. Since the bridge was resurrected as a result of Janice Peaslee's efforts, the bridge was renamed in her honor in 2006. == Image gallery == Image:IMG 4246 old bridge maker's mark.jpg|Original maker's mark circa 1893 Image:IMG 4256 new bridge maker's mark.jpg|New maker's mark circa 2005 == See also == * List of crossings of the Connecticut River ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bridges over the Connecticut River Category:Buildings and structures in Maidstone, Vermont Category:Bridges completed in 1893 Category:Bridges completed in 2005 Category:Bridges in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Essex County, Vermont Category:Road bridges in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:Wrought iron bridges in the United States Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:1893 establishments in New Hampshire Category:1893 establishments in Vermont Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States ",
