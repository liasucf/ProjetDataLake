In 2009, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 2011, he underwent Tommy John surgery.

In 2013, he played for the Modesto Nuts. Pitching for the Double-A Tulsa Drillers in 2014, Oberg appeared in only 27 games due to injury. When the Rockies placed John Axford on family leave on April 12, 2015, the Rockies promoted Oberg to the major leagues. Oberg was the winning pitcher in the 2018 National League Wild Card Game against the Chicago Cubs, becoming the first reliever to win a postseason game when facing at least four batters and striking out all of them. On August 19, the Rockies placed Oberg on the 60-day injured list due to issues with blood clots in his arms, ending his season. In 2019, Oberg produced a 6\u20131 record with a 2.25 ERA, 5 saves, and 58 strikeouts in 56 innings.
