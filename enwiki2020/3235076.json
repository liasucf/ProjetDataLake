Its main base was Domodedovo Airport. == History == ===Development=== A Moskovia Airlines Sukhoi Superjet 100 at Prague Ruzyne Airport in 2014. Moskovia introduced the type in 2013. At least one aircraft of the type that had been operated by Moskovia entered serviced with Red Wings Airlines. The airline was established on as a wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the Gromov Flight Research Institute and named Gromov Air, which was registered on 10 October the same year. In its beginnings the carrier operated cargo flights only; regular scheduled passenger services commenced in 2000. The airline was renamed Moskovia Airlines in 2006. Russian-manufactured aircraft (An-12s, An-24s, Tu-134s, Tu-154s and Yak-40s) made up the fleet until 2009, when leased Boeing 737s were phased in. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 was incorporated into the fleet in 2013. ===Grounding=== Moskovia Airlines filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 but planned to continue its operations. Delays with flights returning passengers from the Montenegrin resort of Tivat and also with services from Astrakhan to Turkey were revealed in mid-; at this time, it was informed the airline was unable to pay for the fuel. An inspection that came after these delays resulted in the Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency Rosaviatsia suspending the commercialisation of tickets and the airline shrinking its operations to serve just the Moscow\u2013Tivat route. That month, it was reported that the company would apparently continue its operations as a charter airline. In , Rosaviatsia suspended the Moskovias's air operator's certificate (AOC) following the carrier's CEO stating the carrier could no longer operate due to financial difficulties. One of the causes for the suspension of the AOC responded to the fact that Moskovia did not meet the Russian regulations for the minimum number of aircraft to operate scheduled passenger services. After months of suspension, the AOC was finally cancelled in . == Destinations == This is a list of destinations served by Moscovia Airlines (as of December 2013): ===Asia=== ; * Yerevan \u2013 Zvartnots International Airport ; * Ganja \u2013 Ganja International Airport ; * Antalya \u2013 Antalya International Airport ; * Bukhara \u2013 Bukhara International Airport * Fergana \u2013 Fergana Airport * Karshi \u2013 Karshi Airport * Namangan \u2013 Namangan Airport * Navoiy \u2013 Navoi International Airport * Samarkand \u2013 Samarkand International Airport ===Europe=== ; * Sarajevo \u2013 Sarajevo International Airport ; * Prague \u2013 Prague V\u00e1clav Havel Airport ; * Berlin \u2013 Berlin-Tegel Airport * Munich \u2013 Munich International Airport ; * Tivat \u2013 Tivat Airport ; * Belgorod - Belgorod Airport * Moscow - Domodedovo Airport Base * Stavropol - Shpakovskoye Airport == Fleet == A Moskovia Airlines Boeing 737-700 at Domodedovo Airport in 2011.
