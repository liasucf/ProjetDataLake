During 1964\u20131967, he studied at \u00c9cole Centrale Paris. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Utah College of Engineering in 1971, working with Dave Evans and Ivan Sutherland, for a dissertation entitled Computer Display of Curved Surfaces. In 1971 Gouraud made the first CG geometry capture and representation of a human face in Wire-frame model and applied his shader to produce the famous human face images showing the effect of his shading were done using his wife Sylvie Gouraud as the model. ==Original publications== * H.
