This percentile is tabulated by combining three basic criteria: the student's bachelor's degree cumulative G.P.A., as per the calculations of the Law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS), their LSAT results, and their EXADEP results. The three criteria receive the same weight at the time of calculating the numeric ranking. Admission is offered to the best ranking students. Also, 15 spaces are offered to the applicants selected by the Admissions Committee recommendations, chosen from a group composed of the 60 applicants following the students admitted. Throughout this process, the Committee evaluates the personal statement and writing sample, and any socioeconomic disadvantages, academic achievement, graduate studies, propensity towards academic progress, publications, extracurricular activities, and other aspects which show student's aptitude for the study of Law. ==Post-graduation employment== According to the University of Puerto Rico's 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 18.24% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.

Built during David Helfeld's incumbency as Dean, it was extensively remodeled by architect Segundo Cardona, FAIA of Sierra Cardona Ferrer Architects under Antonio Garc\u00eda Padilla's sixteen-year term (1986-2001) as the law school dean.http://www.primerahora.com/noticias/puerto- rico/nota/antoniogarciapadillasevaperonodesualmamater-334399/ ==UPR Law School Building== The original Law School building of the University of Puerto Rico (UPR), built during David Helfeld's incumbency as Dean, replaced a converted tobacco storage facility which housed the Law school for many years. It was designed by Henry Klumb in 1961 and inaugurated in 1962. Klumb, a German architect of international renown and a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright, was based in Puerto Rico for the latter part of his life. He left a vast body of impressive work that marked the beginning of the modern Latin American movement and exercised significant influence over contemporary tropical architecture. ===Law school expansion and new library=== As the Law School grew, expansion of the existing facilities became necessary. In 2001, the Law School Building was extensively remodeled and expanded under Antonio Garc\u00eda Padilla's term as the law school dean. Klumb's designs are organic in nature and adapt well to growth and change. In the expansion of the Law School, it was decided to preserve the original stylistic expression\u2014an architectural celebration of modernity\u2014and to employ a vocabulary of restraint out of respect for the character of the original structure. The expansion project and new library were designed by Puerto Rican architect Segundo Cardona FAIA (Sierra Cardona Ferrer Architects), who has worked as student intern for Henry Klumb before becoming an architect himself. The program for the project required a substantial expansion of the library and the faculty offices area, as well as construction of new facilities for the legal aid clinic and an updating of the infrastructure. The new structures were joined to the original building, preserving the integrity of the whole without concealing the individual character of each unit. Together, the reception and security areas of the library form a great open space where routes through the library converge. Visually, this area opens onto the exterior through a tall glass fa\u00e7ade, which floods the interior with natural light, while from the exterior Klumb's original fa\u00e7ade is reflected. This articulates the union of the old structure with the new library and maintains the continuity between the exterior and the interior, a constant in Klumb's architectural works. The large space provides an area in which to exhibit the 70-foot-long tapestry \u201cMadrugada\u201d designed by the calligrapher Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez-Ben\u00edtez. This monumental work forms a symbiotic relationship with its surroundings, thanks to the shape of the space, the placement of the stairs, and the interior and exterior perspectives. From the outside, the whole is unified by the restrained forms, textures and brises-soleil. The inauguration of the new library and expansion was on January 24, 2001 The design for the expansion won the 2001 Honor Award in the VI Bienal de Arquitectura - Colegio de Arquitectos y Arquitectos Paisajistas de Puerto Rico. ==See also== * University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus * Rio Piedras ==References== Category:University of Puerto Rico Category:Law schools in Puerto Rico Category:Educational institutions established in 1913 Category:1913 establishments in Puerto Rico ",
