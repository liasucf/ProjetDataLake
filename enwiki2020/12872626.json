    "text": "Blair Montgomery Thornton (born July 23, 1950) is a rock guitarist and songwriter most widely known for his work with the Canadian rock band Bachman- Turner Overdrive (BTO). He also played in the Vancouver-based band Crosstown Bus prior to joining BTO. Thornton joined the group in early 1974 during the supporting tour for the Bachman-Turner Overdrive II album, replacing Tim Bachman shortly after that album was released. Thornton made his live debut with BTO at a March 1974 televised event for Don Kirshner's In Concert program hosted by Don E. Branker.Donbranker.com Retrieved April 3, 2011 Thornton's first album with BTO was the highly successful Not Fragile LP, released in the fall of 1974. With Thornton's arrival, BTO began incorporating \"dual-lead\" guitar solos in many new songs, with Thornton playing the lead guitar parts along with primary lead guitarist Randy Bachman.Liner notes on Not Fragile album, 1974 BTO release Such solos were not a major feature on the band's first two albums. In interviews years later, Randy noted that Blair Thornton was a welcome addition: > He was known for playing in the Eric Clapton/Bluesbreakers style. [He] was > more advanced on the guitar than my brother Tim, who was basically a rhythm > player who left all the lead to me. I'm not that good. I would repeat > myself, my vocabulary is limited and I didn't have time to go out and learn. > So Blair brought in a new style. We now had twin lead guitars, and that made > my job a lot easier; it gave us more versatility. As a songwriter, Thornton contributed two compositions to the Not Fragile album: \"Givin' It All Away\" and an instrumental called \"Freewheelin'\" that also wound up as the B-side of the No. 1 hit \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\". He also co-wrote three songs for the follow-up 1975 album, Four Wheel Drive, including the title track (with Randy Bachman),Liner notes on Four-Wheel Drive album, 1975 BTO release and co-wrote the Top 40 hit \"Take It Like a Man\" (with Fred Turner) for the late 1975 album Head On. Two other songs on Head On, \"It's Over\" and \"Wild Spirit\", also credit Thornton and Turner as songwriters. Following Randy Bachman's departure from the group in 1977, Thornton took over as primary lead guitarist on their next two albums: Street Action (1978) and Rock n' Roll Nights (1979), also contributing several compositions. Thornton rejoined the \"classic\" Not Fragile line-up (Randy Bachman, Rob Bachman, and Fred Turner) in 1988 for a reunion tour. In 1991, Randy Bachman left the group again and this time was replaced by Vancouver guitarist-singer Randy Murray. This version of BTO proved to be the most enduring, as they toured together until the latter part of 2004. In 2014 Thornton along with original band members Fred Turner, Rob and Randy Bachman were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Thornton currently enjoys a quiet semi-retirement with his wife, Shane. ==Awards and Recognitions== ===Juno Awards=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"80\" | Year !! width=\"400\" | Award !! width=\"100\" | Result |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=2 | 1974 || Most Promising Group of the Year || |- | Contemporary Album of the Year || |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=2 | 1975 || Group of the Year || |- | Best Selling Album of the Year || |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=3 | 1976 || Group of the Year || |- | Best Selling Album of the Year || |- | Best Selling Single of the Year || |- | align=\"center\" | 1978 || Group of the Year || |- | align=\"center\" | 2014 || Canadian Music Hall of Fame Inductee || |} ==References== ==External links== * Website for current version of BTO Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive members Category:Canadian male guitarists Category:Canadian male singer-songwriters Category:Canadian male singers Category:Canadian rock guitarists Category:Canadian rock singers Category:Lead guitarists Category:Musicians from Vancouver ",
