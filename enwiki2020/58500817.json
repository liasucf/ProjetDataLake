Its well-known product is its Jaffa Cakes, sharing the same name as the original McVitie's cakes. ==History== Jaffa was established in 1975, upon the initiative of several entrepreneurs from the area of Crvenka. The following year, in 1976, production of Jaffa Cakes biscuits commenced. In 1978, \"Jaffa\" biscuits as brand were legally protected. Later, in 1981, a new product entitled Munchmallow was introduced, which consists of an egg white cream filling on a thin biscuit, covered in a chocolate layer. From 2004 onward, Jaffa began expanding its assortment of products, starting with the O'cake wholegrain biscuits, introducing new flavors of Jaffa Cakes and Munchmallow and, later in 2006, introducing Doma\u0107i keks (\"Homemade biscuits\") teacakes. In 2007, Jaffa introduced its own versions of the Petit Beurre and Polo biscuits. In 2008, Jaffa entered the salty snacks market with the introduction of the Tak brand, consisting of crunchy salty crackers, and the same year they introduced their own brand of Neapolitan wafers \u2013 Napolitanka. As of 2013, annual production of the company is 12,000 tonnes of confectionery products. In 2017, Jaffa acquired the confectionery company Banini Kikinda for \u20ac15 million, after Banini had been ordered to sell its factory in Kikinda as to repay its debt to creditors. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1975 establishments in Serbia Category:Economy of Vojvodina Category:D.o.o. companies in Serbia Category:Food and drink companies established in 1975 Category:Food and drink companies of Serbia Category:Serbian brands Category:Serbian chocolate companies Category:Kula, Serbia ",
