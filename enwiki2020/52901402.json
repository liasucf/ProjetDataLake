    "text": "Joan Faber McAlister is an American rhetorician and associate professor, and contributes research to women's studies in communication. Her research primarily focuses on how images and space communicate messages in public culture through perceptions of beauty and critical theory. McAlister received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa, and an M.A. in communication and B.A. in anthropology from Boise State University. She is currently an associate professor of communication at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. McAlister was also the editor of Women's Studies in Communication, an international academic journal founded by the Organization for Research on Women and Communication (ORWAC). ==Early life and education== Joan Faber Mcalister was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She attended Boise State University, from which she received a B.A. in anthropology in 1994 with an emphasis in cultural studies and ethnography. In 1996 she completed her M.A. in communication at the same institution. Faber received her Ph.D. in rhetorical studies from the University of Iowa in 2005 with a special certificate in the project on the rhetoric of inquiry. ==Scholarly work== McAlister's research focuses primarily on how images and space communicate messages in public culture through perceptions of beauty and critical theory. Her research using critical theory confronts ideological, societal, and structural binds found in culture and literature. McAlister focuses on analyzing topics including Congressional hearings, popular films, national news coverage, magazine advertisements, reality television, urban planning, and architecture. She approaches these documents with a focus on the relationship between social location and rhetoric, i.e.: how different individuals are placed in power and how the factors of class, gender, race, and sexuality impact these individuals. Her research is concerned with the different factors that are impacting cultural performance and create a sense of belonging that could have detrimental outcomes. She focuses on a concept of \"home\" being more than just a physical location. McAlister has stated that home is \"about relationships between you and your environment [...] between your desires and your limitations [...and] associations between regional identities and cultures.\" ===Collecting the Gaze=== McAlister's essay Collecting the Gaze: Memory, Agency, and Kinship in the Women's Jail Museum, Johannesburg discusses the views of Walter Benjamin in the Women's Jail museum in Johannesburg, South Africa. Benjamin was a German-Jewish philosopher who died in 1940 at the Women's Jail while avoiding deportation to either a French concentration camp or to Nazi Germany. The Women's jail is now a site that rests on the grounds of a former racially segregated prison that was in use from 1020 to 1983, during which apartheid laws sought to assure the dominance of white people. Those who resisted often faced repercussions, drawing a parallel between the Women's Jail and a Nazi regime. The Women's Jail holds visible memories of former inmates, directing the tourists' gaze through haunting collections of personal items such as newspaper clippings. Benjamin's collection often included very personal items such as wedding photographs, shoes, and quotes that were placed where women had once lived and worked, to present more depth into their personal experiences. McAlister then discusses how feminist critics of visual and public memories have concerns about the use of the gaze and the ability it has to change subjects into objects that then create a uniform story. The male gaze, in feminist theory, is associated with objectifying, defining, and exploiting females into objects for sexual pleasure to be viewed. The \"tourist gaze\" is a way of viewing culture as a commodity and can shift tragic sites of trauma into a site that offers pleasure at the expense of others' pain, often with a consumerist goal. McAlister discusses how the gaze of visual and memorial culture causes concern about re-establishing hierarchical systems of race, class, gender, and sexuality that construct identities either through places of public memory or through the objectification of females. She also discusses how the Women's Jail displays the daily life of the prisoners such as the humiliating conditions that menstruating inmates were forced to live through. This includes exhibits detailing how inmates were not allowed to wear undergarments and were forced to push their thighs together or utilize shoe laces to hold pads in place while working. This shows the notable different between the experiences of female and male prisoners which provides visitors with a different gaze into the particular details of daily life while being incarcerated. McAlister's article discusses how the Women's Jail asks visitors to share the responsibility to collect and preserve the past in order to change views of both the past and the future. ===Lives of the Mind/Body=== McAlister's article Lives of the Mind/Body: Alarming Notes on the Tenure and Biological Clocks seeks to draw attention to the biological clocks that women are encouraged to constantly worry about throughout their careers. It discusses the idea that women are torn between achieving academically, in McAlister's situation, and keeping reproductive \"expiration dates\" to themselves. If women pay too much attention to their biological clocks in order to begin a family they will seemingly struggle to stay at the same pace as their male colleagues. McAlister discusses her fear that bringing children into her life would cause her to be viewed as feminine and motherly which would contradict her outward professional persona as a scholar. She noted that having children was often viewed as being uncommitted to academic work by her male colleagues who were published or more revered. It was only after discussing this dilemma with her advisor, a well-established scholar, that McAlister decided to have children. After gaining this approval, the article discusses how McAlister conceived her first child who was stillborn on April 3, 2000. She later had a daughter and twins (one male and one female) who altered both her physical and academic life. While she continued to pursue a tenured position, McAlister found that she needed to keep her bodily connections with her babies private. For example, she discusses hiding in a corner of a conference room to prepare for her \"job talk\" when in fact she needed time to breast pump. She discusses how asking for time for this specific task would have made her seem potentially less fit for the position she was ultimately offered. The article also discusses the biological clock point-of-view in McAlister's missing many \"firsts\" from first steps to first words while working on her dissertation and pursuing her scholarly goals. The article concludes by underlining the need to draw attention to how scholarly discourse is gendered and requires more discussion on what defines productivity. ==Other contributions== * 2016\u2013present \u2013 Membership Officer for the Rhetoric Society of America * 2013\u2013present \u2013 Director, Drake University Speaking Center * 2013 \u2013 Chair of the Jane Jacobs Urban Communication Book Award Committee * 2012\u20132016 \u2013 Editor of Women's Studies in Communication for the Organization for Research on Women and Communication (ORWAC) * 2012 \u2013 Editorial board member for the Quarterly Journal of Speech * 2011\u2013present \u2013 Associate Professor, Department for the Study of Culture and Society, Drake University * 2010\u2013present \u2013 Coordinator of Public Speaking Instruction, Drake University * 2005\u20132011 \u2013 Assistant Professor \u2013 Department for the Study of Culture and Society, Drake University * 2010 \u2013 Chair of the American Studies and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Communication Studies Divisions of the National Communication Association (NCA) * 2003\u20132005 \u2013 Speaking Center Director, Rhetoric Department, University of Iowa * 2002\u20132005 \u2013 Lecturer, Rhetoric Department, University of Iowa * 1999\u20132002 \u2013 Writing Center tutor, Rhetoric Department, University of Iowa * 1998\u20132002 \u2013 Graduate instructor, Rhetoric Department, University of Iowa * 1999 \u2013 Administrative assistant, University of Iowa Writing Center * 1996\u20131998 \u2013 Teaching assistant, Department of Communication Studies, University of Iowa * 1998 \u2013 Research assistant, Department of Communication Studies, University of Iowa * 1995\u20131996 \u2013 Research assistant, Boise State University ==Awards and honors== * 2016 \u2013 Francine Merritt Award for outstanding contributions to women's lives in communication \u2013 Women's Caucus, NCA * 2016 \u2013 Distinguished Engagement Award \u2013 College of Arts & Sciences, Drake University * 2013 \u2013 Article of the Year Award \u2013 \"Collecting the Gaze: Memory, Agency, and Kinship in the Women's Jail Museum, Johannesburg.\" Women's Studies in Communication. 2013 (36:1) 1\u201327.
