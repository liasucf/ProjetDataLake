    "text": "Restorations is an American rock band, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. They formed after the dissolution of Jena Berlin, post-hardcore band from Philly that featured guitarist/singer Jon Loudon on vocals, guitarist Dave Klyman, plus third guitarist Lee Hartney and original drummer Jeff Meyers (Belgrade, Ma Jolie). Originally considered to be a \"once-a- month/easy-band\" with limited touring the band now tours regularly. The band initially released a 7\" with Evil Weevil records featuring the songs \"Frankford\" and \"Of Trees\" and then partnered with Paper + Plastick for their Strange Behavior EP release both digitally and on 10\" vinyl. After that financial arrangement fell through the band moved on to release their first LP on Tiny Engines. Following this they partnered with SideOneDummy to release LP2 and LP3, both recorded by Jon Low, who has engineered and worked on records for the National, Twin Sister and more at Miner Street Studio. The band's fourth album LP5000 was released on September 28, 2018 by Tiny Engines.https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/restorations-lp5000/ ==Discography== ===LPs=== * Restorations (2011) * LP2 (2013) * LP3 (2014) * LP5000 (2018) ===EPs=== * Strange Behavior (2010) ===Singles and 7 inches=== * \"See/Sea\" * \"Call and Response IV\"https://dcist.com/story/14/10/06/listen- restorations-alright-boys-wh/ * \"New/Old\" * \"A/B\" * Split with Rosetta * \"Frankford/Of Trees\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Musical groups from Philadelphia Category:Musical groups established in 2010 ",
