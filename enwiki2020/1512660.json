    "text": "Danger Danger is an American melodic hard rock band, formed in 1987 in Queens, New York, United States. ==History== Danger Danger was formed in 1987 by former Hotshot members lead vocalist Mike Pont, bassist Bruno Ravel (born May 1, 1964), and drummer Steve West (born May 30, 1964). This line-up also featured then future Hotshot guitarist Al Pitrelli (born September 26, 1962) and the former keyboardist of Jazz/Rock/Fusion group Get With It, Kasey Smith (born November 25, 1960 Flushing, New York). Mike Pont later left the band and was replaced by Ted Poley (born January 5, 1962), who previously played in the band Prophet as drummer, and sometimes lead vocalist. Somewhere during this time, they made a failed attempt at recording a demo. They made another attempt at recording a demo and this time it landed them a recording contract with Epic Records. In 1988, Pitrelli left Danger Danger. Shortly after, Pont and Pitrelli reunited to form a new line-up of Hotshot. Since then, Pitrelli has played in various other bands. Pitrelli played on most of the Danger Danger compilation album Rare Cuts. In 1989, Saraya guitarist Tony \"Bruno\" Rey joined briefly and played on part of their debut album, before returning to his previous band. Andy Timmons (born July 26, 1963) replaced him and played on the rest of their debut album, which was released the same year. The album spawned two hits with \"Naughty Naughty\" and \"Bang Bang,\" with the former gaining a spot in MTV's Headbangers Ball. The band went on tour opening for KISS, Alice Cooper, Extreme and Warrant. After that, the band went on to record their follow-up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, releasing Screw It! in 1991. The album spawned two other hits with \"Monkey Business\" and \"I Still Think About You\" and again they went on tour with KISS. After the tour, Kasey Smith left the band and started a new project titled Shock together with friend and former Get With It drummer Michael Bellusci. In 1993 the band had finished work with their third album titled Cockroach. However, the band fired singer Poley. Subsequent lawsuits from Poley prevented the album from being released. In the meantime, Paul Laine (born October 12, 1967) was hired by Ravel and West as the new singer and he re-recorded the vocals for the new album. When they were about to release the album, Epic thought it was in their best interest to shelve the record. Shortly after that the band and the label parted ways. In addition, guitarist Timmons left the band to pursue a solo career. Timmons went on to play guitar on both of Kip Winger's solo albums. Ravel and West formed their own label, Low Dice Records, and started working on a new album with Laine. They released Dawn in 1995 which featured a more somber and introspective tone. The album was partly marketed through the band's fan club, newsletter and website. The band recruited bassist Scott Brown, who had previously played with Paul Laine as a solo artist, and they went on tour again in the U.S. The band went back in the studio and released Four the Hard Way in 1997. Former band members Andy Timmons and Kasey Smith contributed to the album, and the band went back on tour. In 2000 they released The Return of the Great Gildersleeves. In 2001 the band made a unique move after talks with Epic, releasing Cockroach, which was supposed to be their third album, but could not be released for legal issues. The album featured two discs with two versions of the album, one with Laine on vocals and the other with Ted Poley. In 2002 the song \"Naughty Naughty Christmas\" was featured in the Tim Allen movie The Santa Clause 2. They followed Cockroach with Rare Cuts in 2003, a collection of unreleased and rare tracks including early demos with original member Pitrelli, now playing with Megadeth and Trans-Siberian Orchestra, that were recorded in his mother's laundry room. In 2004 Laine left the band and original singer Poley returned. However, in 2005 the band still released, Live and Nude, which was recorded in 2003 and featured Laine on vocals. In 2008 rock and roll comic C.C. Banana recorded a song called \"Ted Poley,\" released on the album Kiss My Ankh. The song is a parody of the Kiss song \"Unholy,\" inspired by the story of Poley's first encounter with Kiss lead singer Paul Stanley. On September 19, 2009, the independent label Frontiers Records released Revolve, featuring the return of Poley as lead singer, as well as new member, guitarist Rob Marcello (born September 9, 1977). The album coincided with the 20th anniversary of their debut release for Imagine Records. The classic lineup of Ted Poley, Bruno Ravel, Steve West, Andy Timmons, and Kasey Smith reunited in 2014 for a series of touring dates. ==Members== ===Current members=== *Bruno Ravel - bass (1987-1995; 1997-present), guitars (1993-1995, 1997-2000), keyboards (1993-1995, 1998-2014, 2014-present) *Steve West - drums, percussion (1987-1995; 1997\u2013present) *Ted Poley - lead vocals (1987-1993, 2004\u2013present) *Rob Marcello - guitars (2003\u2013present) *Steve Brown - guitars (2016-present, performance only, unofficial member) ===Former members=== *Phil Naro - lead vocals (1987) (no performance or recordings) *Mike Pont - lead vocals (1987) *Al Pitrelli - guitars (1987-1988) *Tony \"Bruno\" Rey - guitars (1988-1989) *Kasey Smith - keyboards (1987-1993, 1997-1998, 2014) *Andy Timmons - guitars (1989-1993, 1997-2003, 2014) *Paul Laine - lead vocals (1993-1995; 1997-2004) *Scott Brown - bass (1995) (tour member) ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:10 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1987 till:07/01/2017 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1988 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1987 Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitars value:green legend:Guitars id:Keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Live value:yellow legend:touring id:Lines value:black legend:Studio_releases id:bar value:gray(0.9) BackgroundColors = bars:bar LineData = at:06/06/1989 color:black layer:back at:01/10/1991 color:black layer:back at:01/01/1995 color:black layer:back at:05/05/1998 color:black layer:back at:01/06/2000 color:black layer:back at:01/06/2001 color:black layer:back at:01/06/2009 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Pont text:\"Mike Pont\" bar:Poley text:\"Ted Poley\" bar:Laine text:\"Paul Laine\" bar:Pitrelli text:\"Al Pitrelli\" bar:Rey text:\"Tony Rey\" bar:Timmons text:\"Andy Timmons\" bar:Marcello text:\"Rob Marcello\" bar:Smith text:\"Kasey Smith\" bar:Ravel text:\"Bruno Ravel\" bar:Brown text:\"Scott Brown\" bar:West text:\"Steve West\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Pont from:01/01/1987 till:06/16/1987 color:Vocals bar:Poley from:06/06/1987 till:10/01/1993 color:Vocals bar:Laine from:10/01/1993 till:04/01/1995 color:Vocals bar:Laine from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2004 color:Vocals bar:Poley from:01/01/2004 till:end color:Vocals bar:Pitrelli from:01/01/1987 till:01/01/1988 color:Guitars bar:Rey from:01/01/1988 till:01/01/1989 color:Guitars bar:Timmons from:01/01/1989 till:03/01/1993 color:Guitars bar:Timmons from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2003 color:Guitars bar:Timmons from:05/03/2014 till:11/08/2014 color:Guitars bar:Marcello from:01/01/2003 till:end color:Guitars bar:Ravel from:01/01/1987 till:04/01/1995 color:Bass bar:Ravel from:03/01/1993 till:04/01/1995 color:Guitars bar:Ravel from:03/01/1993 till:04/01/1995 color:Keys width:7 bar:Ravel from:03/01/1993 till:04/01/1995 color:Bass width:3 bar:Ravel from:01/01/1997 till:end color:Bass bar:Ravel from:01/01/1997 till:01/01/2000 color:Guitars width:3 bar:Ravel from:09/01/1998 till:01/01/2000 color:Keys width:7 bar:Ravel from:01/01/2000 till:05/03/2014 color:Keys width:3 bar:Ravel from:11/08/2014 till:end color:Keys width:3 bar:Smith from:01/01/1987 till:03/01/1993 color:Keys bar:Smith from:01/01/1997 till:09/01/1998 color:Keys bar:Smith from:05/03/2014 till:11/08/2014 color:Keys bar:West from:01/01/1987 till:04/01/1995 color:Drums bar:West from:01/01/1997 till:end color:Drums bar:Brown from:01/11/1994 till:04/01/1995 color:Bass bar:Brown from:01/11/1994 till:04/01/1995 color:Live width:3 ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
