The finish was in Meerbeke (Ninove). ==Course== The Koppenberg climb, stirring much controversy for its steep and unevenly cobbled surface, was included in the route for the first time. Only the first five riders managed to make it all the way riding, the rest had to shoulder their bikes to the top. Cycling legend Eddy Merckx was seen strolling helplessly through a tangle of riders and spectators.Vanwalleghem, Rik (2003), De Ronde van Vlaanderen, Lannoo, Belgium, , p27 In the final kilometers a group of five headed to the finish. Freddy Maertens and Roger De Vlaeminck, two of Belgium's star riders, were favourites to win the sprint, but the two did not get on and let themselves jointly be dropped 4 km before the finish.
