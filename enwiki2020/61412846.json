    "text": "Norway has been the stage of one mass shooting in the 21st century, as of 2014. The attack carried out on Ut\u00f8ya in 2011 killed 69 people, being the deadliest attack on Norway since World War II. The high lethality of this shooting and relative low population gives Norway a rate of 1.3 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people between 2000 and 2014. August 19, 2019 a 21-year-old man attempted a mass shooting in a mosque, but a member of the congregation pinned him down. ==References== ",
