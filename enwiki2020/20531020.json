    "text": "The 2009 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival was held June 11\u201314, 2009 at a farm in Manchester, Tennessee, United States. There were roughly 75,000 people in attendance. The onset of Bonnaroo 2009 was punctuated by monstrous thunderstorms. Thursday night included heavy rain, lightning, strong winds and hail. A lighter storm passed over the farm on Friday. The resulting mud became a hardship for some and a plaything for others. ==Lineup== The initial lineup was released on the festival's website at midnight on February 3, 2009. Phish performed a traditional 2-set headlining spot on Sunday night as well as a late night set on Friday night. Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band performed Saturday. Down and The Ting Tings appeared on the initial lineup but were later removed. The previously annual Superjam did not take place, and for the first time in Bonnaroo's eight-year history, not a single The Grateful Dead member performed at the festival. ===June 11th=== (artists listed from earliest to latest set times) *This Tent: **Erick Baker **White Rabbits **Hockey **Chairlift **Passion Pit **Delta Spirit *That Tent: **Charlie Allen **Alberta Cross **Portugal.
