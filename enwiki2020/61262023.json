    "text": "RepresentWomen is a 501(c)(3) organization that aims to help women achieve gender parity in public office in the United States. The organization conducts research and advocacy work to advance women\u2019s representation through candidate recruitment rules (ie gender targets for political parties and political action committees) so more women run, electoral reforms (ie ranked choice voting) that promote \"fairer\" voting systems so more women win, and the modernization of legislative rules (ie onsite childcare and nursing rooms) so more women can serve and lead effectively, once elected. Their mission, according to their website, is to \u201cstrengthen our democracy by advancing reforms that break down barriers to ensure more women can run, win, serve, and lead.\u201d RepresentWomen, originally called Representation2020, started in 2013 as a project of FairVote, a nonprofit that advocates for electoral reform in the United States. The organization changed its name to RepresentWomen and achieved nonprofit status in 2018. RepresentWomen is based in Takoma Park, Maryland. == Research Projects == === The Gender Parity Index (2014-present) === RepresentWomen has put out a Gender Parity Index every year since 2014. This report scores local, state, and federal U.S. governments on the degree to which they are composed of women. Each state is given a letter grade reflecting how close they are to gender parity. Grades are based on a point system measuring the proportion of women in Congress, state legislatures, state executive positions, and local executive positions. States receive an \"A\" grade if they score a 50.0 and above, a \"B\" if they score between 49.9 and 33.0, a \"C\" if they are between 32.9 and 25.0, a \"D\" if they are between 24.9 and 10.0, and an \"F\" if they score below 10.0. \"A\"-grade states are considered to have reached gender parity across all levels of elected government. The only state to have received an \"A\" grade on their index is New Hampshire, though in 2019, its grade dipped to a \"B\" with a score of 49.1. With the majority of states ranking between a \"C\" and \"D\", the 2018 report found that \u201cwomen are underrepresented at the national, state, and local level, and that parity for men and women in elected office is unlikely to occur without structural changes in recruitment, electoral, and legislative rules.\u201d It also found that in 2018, women made up only 25.3 percent of state legislators. The 2019 report found that women are still underrepresented, despite the fact that \"women in 2018 filed to run, became party nominees, and won against other candidates live never before.\" According to the 2019 index, the 2018 \"Year of the Woman\" yielded record breakthroughs for women, including the largest-ever class of women in the U.S. Congress (127, up from 110 prior to the 2018 elections), gender-balanced state legislatures in Nevada, and new firsts for women of color, members of the LGBT community, and young people. Still, no state achieved gender parity in the 2019 index. === Individual and PAC Giving to Women Candidates (2016) === In 2016, RepresentWomen partnered with The Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and Common Cause to explore political giving to congressional candidates with a gender lens and create transparency on how political giving impacts the \"viability\" of candidates. This partnership terminated with the release of a report titled, \"Individual and PAC Giving to Women Candidates.\"The Center for Responsive Politics, Common Cause and Representation2020. \"Individual and PAC Giving to Women Candidates\" RepresentWomen. (2016-11). Retrieved 2019-11-13. === International Research: Why Rules and Systems Matter (2018, 2019) === RepresentWomen released an international report in 2018, titled, \u201cWhy Rules and Systems Matter: Lessons from Around the World.\u201d This report reviewed how different policies and systems affect women\u2019s representation in 193 countries and ranked countries based on their levels of women\u2019s representation. The research found that proportional representation voting systems and gender quotas were associated with the increased representation of women. == Advocacy == === Fair Representation Act === RepresentWomen advocates for fair representation voting implementation in the United States through the use of ranked choice voting and multi-member districts. They identify the Fair Representation Act (HR 3057), introduced by Rep. Donald Beyer Jr., as a way to achieve this reform to electoral systems. RepresentWomen\u2019s executive director Cynthia Richie Terrell played a role in creating the Fair Representation Act. == See also == * FairVote * Women in government == References == == External links == *Official website *Gender Parity Index *International Report *Fair Representation Act Category:Electoral reform groups in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Maryland Category:Organizations established in 2013 ",
