This means that the election must be held by or before 12 October 2023. ==Background== ===2018 elections=== General elections were held in Pakistan on Wednesday 25 July, 2018 after the completion of a five-year term by the outgoing government. At the national level, elections were held in 272 constituencies, each electing one member to the National Assembly. At the provincial level, elections were held in each of the four provinces to elect Members of the Provincial Assemblies (MPA). As a result of the elections, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) became the single largest party at the national level both in terms of both popular vote and seats. At the provincial level, the PTI remained the largest party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP); the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) remained the largest party in Sindh and the newly-formed Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) became the largest party in Balochistan. In Punjab, a hung parliament prevailed with Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) emerging as the largest party in terms of directly elected seats by a narrow margin. However, following the joining of many independent MPAs into the PTI, the latter became the largest party and was able to form the government. Opinion polling prior to campaigning had initially shown leads for the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) over the PTI. However, from an 11-point lead, the PML-N's lead began to diminish in the final weeks of the campaign, with some polls close to the election showing PTI with a marginal but increasing lead. In the final result, the PTI made a net gain with 31.82% of the vote (its highest share of the vote since its foundation), while the PML-N made a net loss with 24.35%. In the lead-up to the elections, there had been allegations by some pre-poll rigging being conducted by the judiciary, the military and the intelligence agencies to sway the election results in favour of the PTI and against the PML-N. The opposition to the winning parliamentary party alleged large-scale vote rigging and administrative malpractices. However, Reuters polling suggested PML-N's lead had narrowed in the run-up to the elections, and that the party had suffered \"blow after blow\" which caused setbacks to any hopes of re-election. Some had termed the ruling PML-N \"embattled... facing a number of desertion and corruption charges\". Imran Khan proceeded to form the coalition government, announcing his cabinet soon after. The newly formed coalition government included members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Pakistan Muslim League (Q). Regarding the voting process, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) outrightly rejected reports of rigging and stated that the elections were conducted fair and free. A top electoral watchdog, Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN), also said that the 2018 general elections in Pakistan had been \"more transparent in some aspects\" than the previous polls. In its preliminary report, the European Union Election Observation Mission said that no rigging had been observed during the election day in general, but found a \"lack of equality\" and criticized the process more than it had in the Pakistani election of 2013. ==Electoral system== The 336 seats of the National Assembly consist of 266 elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies,Electoral system IPU 60 seats are reserved for women and 10 for minority groups. The reserved seats are elected by proportional representation based on the national vote share in the single-member constituencies with a 5% electoral threshold.Pakistan IFES == Parties == The table below lists each party that either received a share of the vote higher than 0.5% in the 2018 Pakistan general election or had representation in the 15th National Assembly of Pakistan. Political parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2018 elections. Independent Candidates bagged 11.46% of the vote and 13 national assembly seats (both general seats and total seats in the 15th National Assembly, as reserved seats for women and minorities, are given to political parties). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! colspan = \"3\" |Name !Political Position !Party Leader ! data-sort-type=number |Voteshare in 2018 ! data-sort-type=number |General National Assembly Seats won in the 2018 elections ! data-sort-type=number |Total seats in the 15th National Assembly |- ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|PTI ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Centre | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imran Khan | style=\"text- align:center;\"|31.82% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|PML(N) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Centre-Right | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Shehbaz Sharif | style=\"text-align:center;\"|24.35% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|PPP ! style=\"text- align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Centre-Left | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Bilawal Bhutto Zardari | style=\"text-align:center;\"|13.03% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#004000;\"| ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|MMA ! style=\"text- align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Right to Far-Right | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Fazl-ur-Rahman | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.85% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#01B045;\"| ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|TLP ! style=\"text- align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Far-Right | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Khadim Hussain Rizvi | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.21% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#800080;\"| ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|GDA ! style=\"text- align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Big Tent | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Pir Pagaro | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.37% | style=\"text- align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:red;\"| ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|ANP ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Centre-Left to Left | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Asfandyar Wali Khan | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.54% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#C80000;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|MQM ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Centre to Centre-Left | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Altaf Hussain | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.38% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:lime;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|PML(Q) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Centre to Centre-Right | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Shujaat Hussain | style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.97% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#006537;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|BAP ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Centre | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Jam Kamal Khan | style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.60% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:yellow;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|BNP(M) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Left | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Akhtar Mengal | style=\"text- align:center;\"|0.45% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#80FF80;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|AML ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Centre | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad | style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.22% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! style=\"background:#D984E3;\"| ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|JWP ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Left | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Nawabzada Shahzain Bugti | style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.04% | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |} == Opinion polls == In the run up to the next Pakistani general elections, various organisations will carry out opinion polling to gauge voting intention throughout Pakistan and the approval rating of the civilian Pakistani government, led by Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The results of such polls are displayed in this section. The date range for these opinion polls are from the previous general election, held on 25 July 2018, to the present day. === Nationwide voting intention === The results in the table below (excluding the column on undecided voters and non-voters) exclude survey participants who said they wouldn't vote or they didn't know who they would vote for and add up to 100%. In polls which included undecided voters or non-voters, percentages are adjusted upwards in order to make the total equal 100%. Margins of error are also adjusted upwards at the same rate to account for the increase. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:20px;\" |- style=\"height:40px;\" ! style=\"width:105px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Polling firm ! style=\"width:105px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Last date of polling ! rowspan=\"2\" |Link ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"|PTI ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"|PML(N) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"|PPP ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"|MMA ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:40px;\"|TLP ! style=\"width:40px;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Other ! rowspan=\"2\" |Lead ! rowspan=\"2\" |Margin of error ! rowspan=\"2\" |Sample size ! rowspan=\"2\" |Undecideds & Non-voters ! rowspan=\"2\" |Polling method |- ! style=\"background:;\" data-sort- type=\"number\"| ! style=\"background:;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| ! style=\"background:;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | ! style=\"background:#004000;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| ! style=\"background:#01B045;\" data-sort- type=\"number\"| ! style=\"background:;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| |- |IPOR (IRI) | |PDF |33% | style=\"background:rgb(153, 255, 153)\" |38% |15% |3% |3% |8% | style=\"background:\" |+5% |\u00b12.95% |2,024 |26% | |- |IPOR (IRI) | |PDF |32% | style=\"background:rgb(153, 255, 153)\" |36% |15% |4% |3% |10% | style=\"background:\" |+4% |\u00b13.17% |1,702 |25% | |- |Gallup Pakistan | |PDF | style=\"background:rgb(248, 193, 190)\" |31% |28% |15% |5% | colspan = \"2\" |21% | style=\"background:\" |+3% |\u00b13-5% |~1,400 |N/A |In-Person Interviews |- |IPOR (IRI) | |PDF | style=\"background:rgb(248, 193, 190)\" |43% |27% |15% |1% |1% |13% | style=\"background:\" |+16% |\u00b12.05% |3,991 |22% |In-Person Interviews |- !2018 Elections ! !ECP ! style=\"background:rgb(248, 193, 190)\" |31.82% !24.35% !13.03% !4.85% !4.21% !21.74% ! style=\"background:\" |+7.47% !N/A !53,123,733 !N/A !Final Election Results |} ===Government approval rating=== The results in this table show polls that surveyed whether people approved or disapproved of either the overall (not on a single issue) performance of the PTI federal government in Islamabad or Imran Khan's overall performance as prime minister since 25 July 2018.

This is a column that lists the percentage of undecided voters and non-voters in certain polls that publish this data. As some polls do not publish any data whatsoever on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants that had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the Margin of Error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100-UndecidedPercentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the different types data they provide. :B. This poll did not include any data about undecided voters or non-voters and cut them out completely from the published results. == References == 2019 Category:Future elections in Asia Category:Pakistan politics-related lists ",
