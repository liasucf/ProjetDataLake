    "text": "Isabelle Druet (born 19 September 1979) is a French operatic coloratura mezzo- soprano who has performed internationally. She began her career as an actress and co-founded a theatre company, La Carotte. She has performed in concert and recorded with the ensemble Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique. On stage, she has performed at opera houses in Paris, Nancy, Lyon and D\u00fcsseldorf, among others. == Career == Born in Niort (Deux-S\u00e8vres), Druet started as an actress, taking theatre courses in high school in Salins-les-Baths. She then pursued a Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes universitaires scientifiques et techniques (DEUST) (Diploma of scientific and technical university studies) degree in Besan\u00e7on, studying at the University of Franche-Comt\u00e9. Though she sang in the university choir, her musical preferences were for reggae and Indian music. In 2000, she co-founded a theatre company based in Besan\u00e7on, La Carotte, where theatre, mime, music, dance and storytelling performances were mixed. Torn between theatre and music, she finally moved to Paris and studied music for two years in the 7th arrondissement before entering the National Conservatoire. Studying voice at the Conservatoire de Paris, Druet graduated summa cum laude in 2007. She obtained a master's degree, writing a thesis, La construction du personnage \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ra, and attending masterclasses with Ren\u00e9 Jacobs and Agn\u00e8s Mellon, among others. In June 2007 she won a first prize in singing with unanimous praise from the jury at the Conservatoire in Isabelle Guillaud's class. That same year, she was elected in the category \"R\u00e9v\u00e9lation classique lyrique\" of the Adami. Simultaneously with her final two years at the Conservatoire, Druet performed in the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, as well as at regional festivals. Among her roles were Za\u00efde in Europa Galante by Andr\u00e9 Campra under the direction of William Christie, which toured in 2005; playing the sorceress in Dido and Aeneas, singing roles in The Clemency of Titus, and playing in the Conservatoire's productions of Eug\u00e8ne Onegin as Mme Larina and in Handel's Alcina as Ruggiero, among many other performances. In 2008, she was awarded second place in the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels, Belgium and sang at Carnegie Hall in New York City with the baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants under the direction of William Christie. The following year, she co-created with Marc Mauillon a presentation for the Emergence Festival. Premiering together, they performed La Valse perdue (The Lost Waltz) by Jacques Offenbach at the Musical Theater of Besan\u00e7on. The duo continued to perform together, singing at the concert of the Revelations of Victories in 2010, when each of them were awarded the distinction of \"laureate\" in the Victoires de la musique classique. After touring throughout Europe, performing both operatic roles and singing baroque lyric concert music, Druet made her US orchestral debut performing with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in 2015. Combining music from two different composers, Argentine Alberto Ginastera and French Maurice Ravel, the concert under the direction of Leonard Slatkin was praised for the thoughtful presentation. Druet was praised for her passionate performance in Ravel's Two Hebraic Melodies, based upon an Aramaic version of the Kaddish. Particularly noted was her performance in Ravel's Sheharazade, for her \"intelligent phrasing that was seemingly attuned to every nuance embedded in the text\". === Opera === In 2010, Druet performed the role of Arcabonne in Lully's Amadis. In 2011, she appeared in the title role of Bizet's Carmen at both the op\u00e9ra national de Lorraine in Nancy and at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in D\u00fcsseldorf. She sang the title role of Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri in Metz. She appeared as Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Druet made her debut at the Paris Opera in 2011 as the Page in Salome by Richard Strauss. In 2013, she was Orph\u00e9e in Gluck's Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice in the revised version by Hector Berlioz at the , alongside Marion TassouMarion Tassou biography as Eurydice. She appeared as Concepci\u00f3n in Ravel's L'heure espagnole in Lyon, which was recorded, and as Baba Turk in Britten's The Rake's Progress. She has appeared at the Paris Opera as Tisbe in Rossini's La Cenerentola, as Annina in Verdi's La traviata, and as Ciesca in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi. === Concert === Druet began performing with the ensemble Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique, as the group allowed her to explore her interest in a variety of music styles. In 2010, she was featured in a production of Cadmus et Hermione by Lully at the Op\u00e9ra Comique accompanied by Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique and Vincent Dumestre. Druet appeared in concert with Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique, performing and recording rarities such as music by Luis de Brice\u00f1o and his contemporaries. In Firenze 1616, they focused on Domenico Belli's Orfeo dolente, and music of his time by Claudio Saracini, Giulio Caccini and Cristofano Malvezzi. She recorded Shakespeare Songs with pianist Anne Le Bozec, works inspired by characters from plays such as Juliet and Desdemona, including songs by Schubert, Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Korngold, the ballad \"La mort d'Oph\u00e9lie\" by Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Five Ophelia Songs by Brahms. A review notes her \"fine, cultured voice\", in four languages. == Awards == * 2007: R\u00e9v\u00e9lation Adami (Lyric artist revelation) of the , Paris * 2008: Second prize of the Queen Elisabeth Competition, Brussels * 2010: Victoires de la musique classique \u2013 Laureate in the category \"Lyric artist revelation\" == Discography == * 2004 Plaisir d'amour with Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique (CD ALPHA 513)Isabelle Druet \u2013 Mezzo-soprano les-ombres.fr * 2008 Queen Elisabeth Competition in singing (CD CMIREB) * 2007 Firenze 1616 with Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique (CD ALPHA) * 2008 Lully's Cadmus et Hermione with Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique (DVD ALPHA701)Lully: Phaeton / Perruche, Arquez, Caton, Druet, Rousset, Les Talens Lyriques arkivmusic.com * 2010 Monteverdi & Marazzoli: Combattimenti! \u2013 Po\u00e8me Harmonique with Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique (CD ALPHA172) Monteverdi* & Marazzoli* \u2013 Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique, Vincent Dumestre \u2013 Combattimenti! discogs.com * 2010 Mozart: Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (Third Lady), with Ren\u00e9 Jacobs (CD Harmonia Mundi HMC 902068.70)Mozart: Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, K620 prestoclassical.co.uk * 2011 Luis de Brice\u00f1o: El Fenix de Paris with Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique (CD ALPHA) * 2011 Jardin Nocturne; M\u00e9lodies by Berlioz, Chausson, Faur\u00e9, Hahn, Halphen, Massenet and Poulenc with Johanne Ralambondrainy,Johanne Ralambondrainy on data.bnf.fr piano (CD Apart\u00e9). * 2011 S\u00e9bastien de Brossard: Oratorios and L\u00e9andro with La R\u00eaveuse (CD Mirare MIR125S\u00e9bastien de Brossard: Oratorios \u2013 Leandro prestoclassical.co.uk * 2012 Lully: Pha\u00e9ton, live at Salle Pleyel * 2013 Bizet: Le docteur Miracle (DVD)Bizet: Le Docteur Miracle prestoclassical.co.uk * 2013 Lully, Campra, Marie Mancini: Presque Reine, Le premier amour de Louis XIV. \u00c9ditions Eveil et D\u00e9couvertesPresque Reine, Le premier amour de Louis XIV Livre-disque; Musical tale by Damien Pouvreau.Damien Pouvreau * R\u00e9volutions 1830-1848-1870 * Cl\u00e9rambault: Miserere, Couperin: Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres (Le Po\u00e8me Harmonique) (CD Alpha)Bizet: Le Docteur Miracle chandos.net * 2016 Shakespeare Songs with Anne Le Bozec (CD NoMadMusic) == References == == External links == * Isabelle Druet (W) / Mezzo-soprano www.rsbartists.com * * Isabelle Druet Operabase * Palmar\u00e8s du concours Reine \u00c9lisabeth * Isabelle Druet aime les militaires et ils le lui rendent bien Le Monde, 13 December 2017 * Isabelle Druet Op\u00e9ra national de Paris * Recordings with Isabelle Druet arkivmusic.com * French mezzo soprano Isabelle Druet makes American Orchestral debut The Oakland Press, 6 April 2015 * D\u2019ombre et de lumi\u00e8re \u2013 Une interview d\u2019Isabelle Druet concertclassic.com, 2011 * Isabelle Druet opera-online.com * Isabelle Druet: Clair de lune by Faur\u00e9 on YouTube * La Carotte \u2013 her theatre company * Isabelle Druet / chanteuse lyrique (mezzo-soprano) francemusique.fr Category:People from Niort Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century French singers Category:French operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Prize-winners of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition Category:21st-century French women singers ",
