He was a colonel of the Registered Cossacks and self- proclaimed Hetman of Ukraine. He led two consecutive rebellions against local Ruthenian nobility, known as the Kosi\u0144ski Uprising. His forces were first defeated by Duke Janusz Ostrogski in the Battle of Pi\u0105tek on 2 February 1593. Kosi\u0144ski promised to subject his forces to the Polish Monarchy; however, he soon escaped to Zaporizhia, where he began organizing a new army. In 1593 he set out for Cherkasy but was soon killed. == See also == * Severyn Nalyvaiko ==References== ==External links== * Kosynsky, Kryshtof in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 2 (1989).
