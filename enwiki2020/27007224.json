    "text": "The Memphis Blues Tour is the eleventh concert tour by American recording artist, Cyndi Lauper. In support of her eleventh studio album, the tour visited the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. During the trek, Lauper performed at numerous jazz festivals including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Jazz \u00e0 Vienne and Jazz Fest Wien. In the Fall of 2011, Lauper will continue the tour as a co-headlining show entitled From Memphis to Mardi Gras. The singer will be joined by blues musician, Dr. John. Lauper performed over a hundred concerts beginning in June 2010 and ending in November 2011. ==Background== Lauper announced the tour in April 2010 via her official website. The singer stated the show will focus heavily on the blues sound of her album alongside her past hits. The tour was designed to be an intimate tour. mimicking the jazz culture of the 1920s. Lauper wanted the show to emulate hearing good music in a \"smoky cafe\". While on tour, concertgoers were able to donate to charities supported by the singer including the Give a Damn Foundation. Lauper was joined on tour by Charlie Musselwhite and Allen Toussaint, who helped contribute to the making of her recent album. While on tour in Japan, Lauper concerts occurred during the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake. Although the singer was urged to leave the island, Lauper stayed and continued to perform her shows as scheduled. She donated the funds from her shows to help relief efforts. In Argentina, Lauper gave an impromptu performance of her hit \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery. ==Opening acts== *David Rhodes (North America--Leg 1, select dates)

The show omitted \"All Through the Night\", with \"Cross Road Blues\" and \"Down So Low\" not broadcast in full. A DVD/ CD of her performance on December 2, 2010 at The Warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee was released in October 2011 and was titled \"Cyndi Lauper To Memphis, with Love.\" It was a unique film with documentary footage but included the performances of the entire set list of the show that night. The package includes a booklet that looked like a concert program with photos from the Memphis show in particular but also photos of Cyndi and her band in various places on the Memphis Blues tour. ==Critical reception== The tour was praised by music critics and concertgoers. Katherine Feeny (Brisbane Times) gave the pop singer's concert at the QPAC Concert Hall four out of five stars. She says, \"It's just one of example of her ability to endear herself to the room, an ability testament to her skill and experience. So too is Lauper's lack of need for showy stage and lighting. The sheer scale and gutsy thrust of her vocal range coupled with a dynamic presence more than fills the stage\". Michael Dwyer (The Sydney Morning Herald) gave the singer three and a half out of five stars. He writes, \"Maybe the subtleties between thought and expression are redundant when a Broadway dynamo in a leather pantsuit is prowling the theatre, standing on chairs and bellowing that 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'. But when she hit the right blend of power and soul--such as with Robert Johnson's Cross Roads Blues--Lauper channelled something more profound\". The praise for the tour continued as Lauper began to perform in England. Kate Watkins (City Life) gave the performance at the Bridgewater Hall four out of five stars. She explains, \"The night ended with a sombre performance of 'True Colors' which showcased the depth and feeling of her vocals which have only improved since she started singing the Blues\". Catherine Meek (The Argus) gave the concert at the Brighton Dome Concert Hall a positive review. She states, \"Whether she was singing a track from her most recent album, 'Memphis Blues', with full backing, or a solo of an old favourite with nothing but the microphone and her dulcimer, Lauper's voice bellowed harmony\". ==Personnel== ;Band *Orris Warner \u2013 drums *Michael Toles \u2013 guitar *William Wittman \u2013 bass guitar *Archie Turner \u2013 keyboards *Stephen Gaboury, Sr. \u2013 piano *Kay Hanley, Tara Stone \u2013 backing vocals ==External links== *Lauper's Official Website ==References== Category:2010 concert tours Category:2011 concert tours Category:Cyndi Lauper concert tours ",
