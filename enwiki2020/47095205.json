    "text": "In algebraic geometry, Bloch's higher Chow groups, a generalization of Chow group, is a precursor and a basic example of motivic cohomology (for smooth varieties). It was introduced by Spencer Bloch and the basic theory has been developed by Bloch and Marc Levine. In more precise terms, a theorem of Voevodsky implies: for a smooth scheme X over a field and integers p, q, there is a natural isomorphism :\\operatorname{H}^p(X; \\mathbb{Z}(q)) \\simeq \\operatorname{CH}^q(X, 2q - p) between motivic cohomology groups and higher Chow groups. == Motivation == One of the motivations for higher Chow groups comes from homotopy theory. In particular, if \\alpha,\\beta \\in Z_*(X) are algebraic cycles in X which are rationally equivalent via a cycle \\gamma \\in Z_*(X\\times \\Delta^1), then \\gamma can be thought of as a path between \\alpha and \\beta, and the higher Chow groups are meant to encode the information of higher homotopy coherence. For example, > \\text{CH}^*(X,0) can be thought of as the homotopy classes of cycles while > \\text{CH}^*(X,1) can be thought of as the homotopy classes of homotopies of cycles. == Definition == Let X be a quasi-projective algebraic scheme over a field (\u201calgebraic\u201d means separated and of finite type). For each integer q \\ge 0, define :\\Delta^q = \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}[t_0, \\dots, t_q]/(t_0 + \\dots + t_q - 1)), which is an algebraic analog of a standard q-simplex. For each sequence 0 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\cdots < i_r \\le q, the closed subscheme t_{i_1} = t_{i_2} = \\cdots = t_{i_r} = 0, which is isomorphic to \\Delta^{q-r}, is called a face of \\Delta^q. For each i, there is the embedding :\\partial_{q, i}: \\Delta^{q-1} \\overset{\\sim}\\to \\\\{ t_i = 0 \\\\} \\subset \\Delta^q. We write Z_i(X) for the group of algebraic i-cycles on X and z_r(X, q) \\subset Z_{r+q}(X \\times \\Delta^q) for the subgroup generated by closed subvarieties that intersect properly with X \\times F for each face F of \\Delta^q. Since \\partial_{X, q, i} = \\operatorname{id}_X \\times \\partial_{q, i}: X \\times \\Delta^{q-1} \\hookrightarrow X \\times \\Delta^q is an effective Cartier divisor, there is the Gysin homomorphism: :\\partial_{X, q, i}^*: z_r(X, q) \\to z_r(X, q-1), that (by definition) maps a subvariety V to the intersection (X \\times \\\\{ t_i = 0 \\\\}) \\cap V. Define the boundary operator d_q = \\sum_{i=0}^q (-1)^i \\partial_{X, q, i}^* which yields the chain complex :\\cdots \\to z_r(X, q) \\overset{d_q}\\to z_r(X, q-1) \\overset{d_{q-1}}\\to \\cdots \\overset{d_1}\\to z_r(X, 0). Finally, the q-th higher Chow group of X is defined as the q-th homology of the above complex: :\\operatorname{CH}_r(X, q) := \\operatorname{H}_q(z_r(X, \\cdot)). (More simply, since z_r(X, \\cdot) is naturally a simplicial abelian group, in view of the Dold\u2013Kan correspondence, higher Chow groups can also be defined as homotopy groups \\operatorname{CH}_r(X, q) := \\pi_q z_r(X, \\cdot).) For example, if V \\subset X \\times \\triangle^1Here, we identify \\triangle^1 with a subscheme of \\mathbb{P}^1 and then, without loss of generality, assume one vertex is the origin 0 and the other is \u221e. is a closed subvariety such that the intersections V(0), V(\\infty) with the faces 0, \\infty are proper, then d_1(V) = V(0) - V(\\infty) and this means, by Proposition 1.6. in Fulton\u2019s intersection theory, that the image of d_1 is precisely the group of cycles rationally equivalent to zero; that is, :\\operatorname{CH}_r(X, 0) = the r-th Chow group of X. == Properties == === Functoriality === Proper maps f:X\\to Y are covariant between the higher chow groups while flat maps are contravariant. Also, whenever X is smooth, any map from X is covariant. === Homotopy invariance === If E \\to X is an algebraic vector bundle, then there is the homotopy equivalence > \\text{CH}^*(X,n) \\cong \\text{CH}^*(E,n) === Localization === Given a closed equidimensional subscheme Y \\subset X there is a localization long exact sequence > \\begin{align} \\cdots \\\\\\ \\text{CH}^{*-d}(Y,2) \\to \\text{CH}^{*}(X,2) \\to > \\text{CH}^{*}(U,2) \\to & \\\\\\ \\text{CH}^{*-d}(Y,1) \\to \\text{CH}^{*}(X,1) \\to > \\text{CH}^{*}(U,1) \\to & \\\\\\ \\text{CH}^{*-d}(Y,0) \\to \\text{CH}^{*}(X,0) \\to > \\text{CH}^{*}(U,0) \\to & \\text{ }0 \\end{align} where U = X-Y. In particular, this shows the higher chow groups naturally extend the exact sequence of chow groups. == Localization theorem == showed that, given an open subset U \\subset X, for Y = X - U, :z(X, \\cdot)/z(Y, \\cdot) \\to z(U, \\cdot) is a homotopy equivalence. In particular, if Y has pure codimension, then it yields the long exact sequence for higher Chow groups (called the localization sequence). == References == *S.
