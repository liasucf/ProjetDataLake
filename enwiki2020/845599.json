    "text": "Wonder Boys is a 1995 novel by the American writer Michael Chabon. It was adapted into a film with the same title in 2000. ==Plot summary== Pittsburgh professor and author Grady Tripp is working on an unwieldy 2,611-page manuscript that is meant to be the follow-up to his successful, award-winning novel The Land Downstairs, which was published seven years earlier. On the eve of a college-sponsored writers' and publishers' weekend called WordFest, Tripp's wife walks out on him, and he learns that his mistress, the chancellor of the college, Sara Gaskell, is pregnant with his child. To top it all off, Tripp finds himself involved in a bizarre crime committed by one of his students, an alienated young writer named James Leer. During a party, Leer shoots and kills the chancellor\u2019s dog and steals her husband\u2019s prized Marilyn Monroe collectible: the jacket worn by the actress on the day of her marriage to Joe DiMaggio. The New York Times reviewed the novel as \"...the ultimate writing-program novel. If that sounds insulting, I don't mean it to be. But anyone who has ever served time in a writing program and gone to the \"writing festivals\" at various universities will instantly recognize the milieu and the characters.\" ==Inspiration== The novel grew from Chabon\u2019s concerns with completing an unrealized novel, Fountain City, about the construction of a perfect baseball park in Florida. He decided to write a story about, in part, an author who couldn\u2019t finish his own work. The main character of Grady Tripp is admittedly based on University of Pittsburgh professor, Chuck Kinder, who taught the undergraduate Chabon in the early 1980s. Kinder\u2019s great opus, a novel inspired by his friendship with author Raymond Carver, was reportedly more than 3000 pages long at one point. It was finally published in a very slimmed-down version in 2001 as Honeymooners: A Cautionary Tale. ==References== ==External links== * San Francisco Chronicle article Category:1995 American novels Category:Novels by Michael Chabon Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels about writers Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh Category:Villard (imprint) books Category:Novels about teachers ",
