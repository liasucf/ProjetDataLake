    "text": "Paul Blobel (13 August 1894 \u2013 7 June 1951) was a German SS commander and convicted war criminal. He was the key figure in organising and executing the Babi Yar massacre of 1941. In June 1942, Blobel was put in charge of Sonderaktion 1005, with the task of destroying the evidence of Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe. After the war, he was convicted at the Einsatzgruppen Trial and executed. ==Early life== Born in the city of Potsdam, Blobel fought in the First World War, in which by all accounts he served well, being decorated with the Iron Cross first class. After the war, Blobel studied architecture and practiced this profession from 1924 until 1931, when upon losing his job he joined the Nazi Party, the SA, and the SS (he had joined all of these by 1 December 1931). Early war-time ID issued to Paul Blobel by the \"Volkswohlfahrt\", Nazi Germany's welfare organization. ==SS career== Blobel in SS uniform In 1933 Blobel joined the police force in D\u00fcsseldorf. In June 1934 he was recruited into the SD Security Service. During World War II, following Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941 Blobel became the commanding officer of Sonderkommando 4a of Einsatzgruppe C, active in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Both, Einsatzgruppen and the Order Police battalions were responsible for massacres of Jews behind the Wehrmacht lines in the Soviet Union. The murder campaign included all political and racial undesirables. In August 1941 Blobel was put in charge of creating a Nazi ghetto in Zhytomyr to enclose around 3,000 Jews who were murdered a month later.Ogorreck, Ralf (2010). Les Einsatzgruppen, Tallandier, p. 150, On 10 or 11 August 1941, Friedrich Jeckeln ordered him, on behalf of Adolf Hitler, to exterminate the entire Jewish population.Ogorreck, Ralf, op. cit. p. 203. On 22 August 1941, the Sonderkommando murdered Jewish women and children at Bila Tserkva with the consent of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau, commander of the 6th Army. SS- Obersturmf\u00fchrer August H\u00e4fner testified at his own 1942 trial: Blobel, in conjunction with Reichenau's and Friedrich Jeckeln's units, organised the Babi Yar massacre in late September 1941 in Kiev,Christopher Browning: The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 - March 1942 (With contributions by J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us), Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004. pp. 291\u2013292 where 33,771 Jews were murdered. In November 1941, Blobel received and activated the first gas vans at Poltava. Blobel was relieved of his command on 13 January 1942, officially for health reasons, but mostly due to his alcoholism. In June 1942 he was put in charge of Aktion 1005, with the task of destroying the evidence of all Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe. This entailed exhumation of mass graves, then incinerating the bodies. Blobel developed efficient disposal techniques such as alternating layers of bodies with firewood on a frame of iron rails. In October 1944 he headed an anti-partisan group in Yugoslavia. Gitta Sereny related the conversation about Blobel she once had with one-time Chief of the Church Information Branch at the Reich Security Head Office, Albert Hartl. ==Trial and conviction== Blobel is sentenced to death at the Einsatzgruppen trial, 10 April, 1948. Up to 59,018 killings are attributable to Blobel, though during testimony he was alleged to have killed 10,000\u201315,000 people. He was later sentenced to death by the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Einsatzgruppen trial. He was hanged at Landsberg Prison shortly after midnight on June 7, 1951.\"Five death sentences were confirmed: the sentence against Oswald Pohl, as well as those passed against the leaders of the Mobile Killing Units, Paul Blobel, Werner Braune, Erich Neumann and Otto Ohrlendorf. ... In the early morning hours of 7 June, the [] Nazi criminals were hanged in the Landesburg prison courtyard.\" Norbert Frei, Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past: The Politics of Amnesty and Integration.
