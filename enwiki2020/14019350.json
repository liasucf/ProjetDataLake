The New York Times recommends both volumes, in conjunction with Rhino's Girl Group Greats, for listeners seeking \"the biggest girl-group hits\".Staff. (November 25, 2005). The good, the rare and the nostalgic in boxed sets The New York Times. Accessed November 1, 2007. == Song selection == The compilation collects a broad range of the era's well-known hits, featuring seven #1 hit singles and an additional 14 top ten hits among its 36 tracks, but it includes lesser-known material as well, enough\u2014according to AllMusic\u2014to \"keep the collection interesting for more serious fans of girl group pop\". The collection includes two representative tracks of Ellie Greenwich, a prolific charting songwriter whose own material both solo and with The Raindrops was often overlooked. The included solo single \"You Don't Know\" was described by journalist Alan Betrock in his book Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound as \"the kind of record that not only transcends and expands the boundaries that come to mind when someone says, 'Girl-group record,' but...also can stand alone, totally unique and unmatched by any other competition\". \"I Can't Let Go\", a 1965 song by Evie Sands which did not chart, was critically described as \"superb\" though the song failed to capture popular interest until covered by The Hollies a year later. \"The One You Can't Have\" is one of several \"outstanding\" singles by popular backing vocalists The Honeys that failed to achieve commercial success. Cher's brush with the girl group genre is also represented, by the 1965 \"Dream Baby\", a \"girl group classic\" if not a charting single. == Track listing == === The Best of the Girl Groups, Volume 1 === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !# !
