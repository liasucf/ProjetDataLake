In total, at least 64 to at least 88 people were killed and at least 94 were wounded, with at least three attackers also being killed. Other attacks may have taken place. == Bombings == ===First bombing=== The first attack was a twin suicide bombing in front of the National Assembly of Afghanistan in the capital Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for this attack that killed at least 46 people, mostly parliament workers, and wounded over 70, while they claimed that 70 were killed. The target was a National Directorate of Security minibus. There were two bombers, one on foot and one in a car. ===Second bombing=== The second attack occurred at Governor Humayun Azizi's guesthouse in Kandahar, when the United Arab Emirates ambassador Juma Al Kaabi and his fellow diplomats were being hosted for dinner.

Among both the dead and the injured were many prominent Afghan politicians and diplomats, including 5 Emirati diplomats who were killed in the blast. The UAE Ambassador to Afghanistan, Juma Al Kaabi, was also injured during the attack, and died of his injuries more than a month later, on February 15. Abdul Ali Shamsi, Kandahar's deputy governor, was also among those killed. Although suspected, the Taliban did not claim responsibility for the bombing and instead blamed it on \"internal local rivalry\". Much of the bombing was orchestrated by a longtime cook named Sayeed Mahboob Agha. Agha had previously worked as a cook for members of the Taliban, and was known to have ongoing contact with the Taliban. Agha moved from Farah province to Kandahar to work at the Kandahar governor's guesthouse, on the recommendation of Taliban acquaintances. He was later offered $30,000 and a residence in Pakistan in exchange for smuggling a bomb into the guesthouse. ===Third bombing=== A third bombing occurred in Lashkargah, where at least seven to 16 civilians were killed and six to nine were injured, not including the deceased suicide bomber.
