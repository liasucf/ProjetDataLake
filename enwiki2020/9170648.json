She was sent to Belgium in the late 1920s and enrolled in Dental School. Upon graduating from Dental School, she is believed to have considered moving to the Belgian Congo to undertake humanitarian work. However, Abdolhossein Teymourtash's fall from grace in 1932 prompted her to return to Iran where along with Teymourtash's wife and children she endured eight years of house arrest and exile to the family's farflung estates in Khorasan. Upon Reza Shah's abdication in 1941, pursuant to a general amnesty, all political prisoners were released, and Badri Teymourtash moved to Mashad where she pursued dentistry. == See also == * Abdolhossein Teymourt\u0101sh * Iran Teymourtash ==References== ==External links== *Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry Category:Iranian dentists Category:Iranian women physicians Category:Women dentists Category:1908 births Category:1989 deaths Category:20th-century Iranian physicians ",
