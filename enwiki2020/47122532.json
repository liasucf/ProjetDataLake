    "text": "Ivo Ricardo Abreu Vieira (born 10 January 1976) is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a defender, and is the current manager of Saudi club Al-Wehda. ==Playing career== Vieira was born in Machico, Madeira. His entire ten-year professional career was spent with local C.D. Nacional, which he represented in all three major levels since being promoted to the main squad at the age of 18; during his tenure, he also acted as captain. From 2002 to 2004, Vieira competed in the Primeira Liga. His first game in the competition took place on 22 September 2002, as he came on a last-minute substitute in a 2\u20130 away win against S.C. Beira-Mar; in the latter season, he contributed with 19 appearances to help his team to a best-ever fourth position. ==Coaching career== After retiring at the age of only 28, Vieira started working as a coach, first being named assistant manager at Nacional under Casemiro Mior. On 14 March 2011, after a spell with the club's juniors, he was handed the reins of the first team after Predrag Jokanovi\u0107 was fired. However, he himself was replaced by Pedro Caixinha at the end of October. On 20 January 2013, Vieira was announced as the new manager of C.S. Mar\u00edtimo B, the reserves of neighbouring C.S. Mar\u00edtimo. In early March 2015, after Leonel Pontes' resignation, he was appointed his successor, leading the club to the final of the Ta\u00e7a da Liga the following month later after disposing of FC Porto in the last-four stage; he resigned on 18 January 2016, due to poor results. On 27 May 2016, Vieira was appointed at Segunda Liga club C.D. Aves for one year. He left on 15 February 2017, with the team nine points clear in the second promotion place after a run of one point from four games. In May 2017, Vieira became manager of Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra and stated his aim to end their exile from the top flight. He left in November with the side in sixth and took the helm at G.D. Estoril Praia, leaving after their top division relegation. On 28 May 2018, Vieira signed a one-year deal at Moreirense FC. He left at the end of this contract, having taken the team from Moreira de C\u00f3negos to a best-ever sixth place, and in June 2019 he was hired by neighbours Vit\u00f3ria SC. After finishing seventh in his only season, he announced a sabbatical to spend time with his family. On 10 September 2020, Vieira was appointed as the manager of Al-Wehda in the Saudi Professional League. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Team ! rowspan=\"2\" |Nat ! rowspan=\"2\" |From ! rowspan=\"2\"|To ! colspan=\"8\" |Record |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=left|Nacional | |align=left|14 March 2011 |align=left|31 October 2011 |- |align=left|Mar\u00edtimo B | |align=left|20 January 2013 |align=left|1 July 2014 |- |align=left|Mar\u00edtimo | |align=left|2 March 2015 |align=left|18 January 2016 |- |align=left|Aves | |align=left|27 May 2016 |align=left|15 February 2017 |- |align=left|Acad\u00e9mica | |align=left|30 May 2017 |align=left|13 November 2017 |- |align=left|Estoril | |align=left|13 November 2017 |align=left|16 May 2018 |- |align=left|Moreirense | |align=left|28 May 2018 |align=left|19 May 2019 |- |align=left|Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es | |align=left|17 June 2019 |align=left|Present |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total |} ==See also== *List of one- club men ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:People from Machico, Madeira Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:C.D.
