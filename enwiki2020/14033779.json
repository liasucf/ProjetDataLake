It was established by the Selangor state government in 1987 and has been managed by the Malaysian Nature Society who have proposed that it be declared a wetland of international importance.Grace Chen. 2018. 'Kuala Selangor out to get Ramsar listing for wetlands'. The Star (Malaysia), 26 October.Man-made lake With a total area of , the park is a combination of secondary forest and wetland with a man-made coastal bund separating the wetland from the forest. Inside the park itself is a large pond surrounded by another bund. A water lock connecting the pond with the river controls the water level of the pond. The park, as part of the Selangor River estuary, is home to a number of large bird species such as milky storks and herons as well as primates, namely silver leaf monkeys and long-tailed macaques. The area was a breeding ground of an endangered milky stork species before the program was suspended. An abandoned aviary still stands in the middle of the park. ==History== There were mangrove virgin forest in Kuala Selangor until the 1940s. However, the land was cleared to make salt plans from 1965 to the 1970s. Furthermore, in 1986, the land clearing started to create a marina, prawn farm and golf course. Sand dredging for the project killed wide range of mangrove forest, and the existing secondary forest was created since then. For these reasons, Malayan Nature Society (now the Malaysian Nature Society) and the Asian Wetlands Bureau (now Wetlands International) made a petition to the government of Selangor state, and the land was established as a park by the government on 27 September 1987. Endangered silvered-leaf monkey was adopted as a logo mark of the park. After that, the park have been managed by Malaysian Nature Society under a cooperative arrangement with the Selangor state government. It became the first park to be managed by a NGO in Malaysia. In 1997, Kuala Selangor Nature Park was recognised as a nature reserve for conservation and ecotourism, and recognised as Important Bird Area (IBA) by Birdlife International.Malaysian Nature Society (2010).
