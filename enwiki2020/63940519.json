Antoine river\" by Samuel de Champlain on his 1632 map, and \"R. de S. Anthome\" by Jean Boisseau, in 1643, the South river \"seems to appear on the map from Jean Bourdon, drawn up around 1641, in the form of Grande Rivi\u00e8re du Sud. The act of concession of the seigneury of Rivi\u00e8re-du-Sud to Charles Huault de Montmagny, in 1646, expressly states \"the river called from the South to the point where it discharges into the Saint Lawrence River. Very stable thereafter, the toponym is part of the official designation of three municipalities drained by this course of water: Saint-Pierre-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-du- Sud, Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-du-Sud and Sainte-Euph\u00e9mie-sur-Rivi\u00e8re-du- Sud.Source: Quebec names and places, work by the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and in that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary. The toponym Rivi\u00e8re du Sud was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec - Bank of place names - Toponym: Rivi\u00e8re du Sud. == Notes and references == == Appendices == === Related articles === * St. Lawrence River * Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire, a municipality * Sainte-Euph\u00e9mie-sur-Rivi\u00e8re- du-Sud, a municipality * Armagh, a municipality * Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, a municipality * Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-du-Sud, a municipality * Saint- Pierre-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-du-Sud, a municipality * Montmagny, a municipality * Montmagny Regional County Municipality === External links === Category:Rivers of Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches Category:Montmagny Regional County Municipality ",
