It is mainly located in the parish of Church Stretton, 2\u00bd miles southwest of Little Stretton and 4 miles from the market town of Church Stretton. The parishes of Church Stretton, Wistanstow and Lydbury North come together at Hamperley and some dwellings, at Hamperley Plantation, are in the Wistanstow parish, whilst Little Hamperley is just within the Lydbury North parish. At the centre of the hamlet lies a crossroads of four lanes: one leads to the B4370 road, half a mile southeast at Cwm Head; another leads to the hamlet of Minton, 1\u00bc miles to the northeast; the third leads to Priors Holt and Churchmoor, to the west; and the fourth is a green lane heading to farms to the southwest. The centre of Hamperley lies at 233m above sea level. The area is very rural and is at the southern end of the Long Mynd hill range.Geograph Churchmoor There is an outdoors activity centre located on the lane between Minton and Hamperley, the Longmynd Adventure Camp, with overnight accommodation and camping ground.Longmynd Adventure Camp There is also a low impact campsite at http://hamperleycampsite.co.uk. ==Nearby minor localities== Churchmoor, Priors Holt and Priors Holt Hill are just to the west of the hamlet and the hill rises to 383m.
