Over 2,500 swell across Turkish-Syrian border in one day, the highest ever recorded. * July, 2012: Refugee flow ahead of fighting in Aleppo. * September, 2012: UNHCR reports that more than 11,000 Syrians flee into Turkey in a day's time. == Settlement (repatriation, transit) == In 2014, the capacity of the camps established in 2012 and 2013 became insufficient. In 2014, refugees according to their own preferences begin to migrate across provinces. About 30% live in 22 government-run camps near the Syrian border. The number of refugees in transit to Europe dramatically increased in 2015. \\ === Citizenship === Up to 300,000 Syrian refugees living in Turkey could be given citizenship under a plan to keep wealthy and educated Syrians in the country. == Conditions == Suru\u00e7 refugee center Syrian refugee center on the Turkish border 80 kilometres from Aleppo, Syria (3 August 2012).

Over 13 million Syrians received aid from the Turkish Aid Agency (AFAD). Turkey has spent more than any other country on Syrian refugee aid, and has also been subject to criticism for opening refugee camps on the Syrian side of the border. Financial aid from other countries to Syrian Refugees has been limited, though \u20ac3,200,000,000 was promised by the EU in November 2015. In March 2016, the EU and Turkey agreed on the EU-Turkey Statement, which involved a number of political concessions as well as 'another \u20ac3 billion in aid, if Turkey agreed to a readmission of Syrians arriving in Greece and tighter border controls.' === Employment === Under Turkish law, Syrian refugees cannot apply for resettlement but only temporary protection status. Registering for temporary protection status gives access to state services such as health and education, as well as the right to apply for a work permit in certain geographic areas and professions. Over a third of urban refugees are not registered. A study which was supported by the Istanbul University Scientific Research Projects unit and conducted by academics from a number of universities, revealed that the vast majority of Syrians in Turkey are employed in unregistered work for significantly lower wages compared to their Turkish counterparts. However compared to the increase in refugees, benefits towards them weren't increased as much as only 712,218 were given residency permits only 56,024 work permits were given to the Syrians by 2017. === Housing === Turkey's response to the refugee crisis is different from most other countries. As a World Bank report noted: It is a non-camp and government financed approach, as opposed to directing refugees into camps that rely on humanitarian aid agencies for support. === Racism === Influx of Syrian refugees to Turkey has significantly increased anti-Arabian sentiments in the country. == Education == The goal of the Turkey is providing efforts to ensure that all refugee children can access a form of learning and be fully integrated into the formal education system. The facts are: As of [unknown date], Currently, 30% of Syrian refugee children have access to education, 4,000 businesses have been opened, and several Syrian refugee camps have grown into small towns with amenities from healthcare to barber shops.[?citation] As of March 2018, about 60% (600,000 primary and secondary education) of Syrian school-aged children under temporary protection remain in school.
