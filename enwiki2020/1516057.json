On November 24, 2000, after three days of stunting, KKNB flipped back to Top 40/CHR as \"Kiss 104 FM\", and changed call letters to KSLI-FM. On March 17, 2004, KIBZ and its active rock format known as \"The Blaze\" moved to 104.1 from 106.3 FM.https://journalstar.com/news/local/clear-channel-pulls-plug-on-kiss- fm/article_544812eb-759c-50c4-a351-042c1f888147.htmlhttps://journalstar.com/news/local/radio- musical-chairs-endures-with-brand-new-formats- talent/article_a50a2a29-6ec7-576d-9ead-6e67b7e3d6bc.html Clear Channel Communications sold KIBZ to Three Eagles Communications on April 10, 2007.
