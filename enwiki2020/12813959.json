    "text": "Mauricio An\u00edbal Isla Isla (; born 12 June 1988) is a Chilean footballer who currently plays for Brazilian team Flamengo and for the Chile national team. Isla started his career in the youth system of Universidad Cat\u00f3lica, and later moved to Italian club Udinese in 2007, where he made his professional debut. His performances earned him a transfer to defending Serie A Champions Juventus where he won consecutive league titles during his first two seasons with the team. In 2014, he was sent on loan for a season to English side Queens Park Rangers, while he also spent the next season on loan with French club Marseille. Isla has earned over 110 caps for Chile since his debut in 2007, and represented the nation in two FIFA World Cups (2010 and 2014) as well as four Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments (2011, 2015, 2016 and 2019), winning the 2015 and 2016 editions. ==Club career== ===Early years=== Isla started in the youth ranks of Universidad Cat\u00f3lica in 1999 as a forward. However his lack of height caused him to switch positions to defender, as U Cat\u00f3lica lacked quality youth defenders. Isla played well enough in the new position to earn a call-up to the first team in 2006, but never played an official match and in 2007, coach Jos\u00e9 del Solar sent him back to the youth team. ===Udinese=== Isla (left) and fellow Chilean Alexis S\u00e1nchez in a UEFA Cup match against Spartak Moscow, on 6 November 2008. Isla had a notable performance during the summer of 2007 in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada and was thereafter signed by Udinese of the Serie A in Italy on a five-year contract. He can both defend and attack and has been known to turn innocent possession-based games into quick-paced counter-attacks with ease. His technique is well accompanied by a surprising pace and stamina. Isla made his professional debut on 19 December 2007 versus Palermo in the Coppa Italia. On 8 March 2008, Isla played his first game as a starter in Serie A also against Palermo, a game which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. After the departure of Simone Pepe, Isla often played as a right wing-back in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation during Udinese's 2010\u201311 Serie A campaign, due to a long- term injury to Du\u0161an Basta. In that season, he was instrumental in helping Udinese finish fourth, thus gaining qualification to the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League play-off round. ===Juventus=== On 15 June 2012, Juventus announced Isla's arrival to a medical ahead of a prospective move to join the team for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season. Following his move to Juventus, Isla said moving to Juventus was his dream come true and that he was excited to join his Chilean team-mate Arturo Vidal. Isla told TVN: > This is a dream come true: We are going to be the strongest team in Italy. > It is important for me as a player, but it is also vital for my family. I > have been working for years to get to this point. In Udine I became a > professional. But I have always said that sooner or later I would go to a > bigger club like Juve. There I can challenge for trophies. I want to play > and win something important, like the Champions League. ====Queens Park Rangers (loan)==== On 6 August 2014, Isla joined Queens Park Rangers on loan for the 2014\u201315 Premier League season, with an option of a permanent deal at the end of the season for a reported \u00a38 million fee. He made his debut away against Tottenham Hotspur. He made his home debut in the next league game against Sunderland, adapting to a new right-back role in a changed formation, helping the R's to their first league win and clean sheet of the season. Isla adapted quickly to the Premier League and this was helped when he was joined at QPR by his national teammate and close friend Eduardo Vargas, who plays just in front of him in QPR's 4\u20134\u20132 formation. This started to show when he provided an assist for Charlie Austin against reigning Premier League champions Manchester City. After settling into life in West London, Isla signaled his intention to take up the option of making the loan permanent at the end of the season. ====Marseille (loan)==== On 31 August 2015 Isla was loaned to Marseille by Juventus.http://www.juventus.com/media/native/investor- relations-docs/english/price-sensitive-press- releases/2015-2016/comunicato%2031082015%20accordi%20marsiglia%20eng.pdf ===Cagliari=== On 10 August 2016, Isla moved to Cagliari for a transfer fee of \u20ac4 million. He signed a three-year contract with his new club. ===Fenerbahce=== On 21 July 2017, Isla signed for S\u00fcper Lig side Fenerbah\u00e7e on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. ===Flamengo=== On 19 August 2020, Isla signed for Brazilian side Flamengo on a two and a half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. ==International career== ===2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup=== Isla took part with Chile in the 2007 South American Youth Championship, where Chile qualified for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. During the U-20 World Cup Isla was noticed worldwide for his skill with the ball and versatility. Isla was an integral part of the team that finished in third place. In the quarterfinal game versus Nigeria, Isla played defender, midfield, and forward due to a number of injuries to other squad members. The game went into extra time after finishing scoreless in regulation and in the added time, Chile scored four goals. Two of the goals came from Isla, one from the penalty spot. After each goal Isla ran over to the Chilean telecast camera (which was marked by a Chilean flag) and dedicated his goals to his grandmother and aunt, who was pregnant. This tournament and his performance in it led Isla to be transferred to Serie A team Udinese before his professional debut in the Chilean league, a very rare occurrence. ===Senior=== New Chilean coach Marcelo Bielsa called Isla up at the age of 19 for his first full Chile senior squad international cap in September 2007 in a friendly against Switzerland versus his club-mate G\u00f6khan Inler. He started as a center midfielder. This was his debut as a professional player, before making his first team debut on Udinese. His strong performances earned another call-up in the next friendly against Israel, where he came on as a second-half substitute. He played his first 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match in March 2009 as a starter versus Peru. Isla made another start against Uruguay where, in a scoreless draw, he was sent off after 33 minutes following two yellow cards. He was a starter in all of Chile's four 2010 World Cup games. He also played in 3 of 4 matches in the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, and playing in 13 of 16 matches in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. At the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica on home soil, Isla scored the only goal in the 81st minute of a quarter-final win over holders Uruguay at the Estadio Nacional, putting Chile into the last four for the first time since 1999,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33085788 as the team went on to win the tournament. === International === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! colspan=3 | Chile |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2007||1||0 |- |2008||2||0 |- |2009||7||0 |- |2010||8||1 |- |2011||13||1 |- |2012||3||0 |- |2013||10||0 |- |2014||13||0 |- |2015||14||1 |- |2016||14||0 |- |2017||14||1 |- |2018||6||0 |- |2019||10||0 |- |2020||1||0 |- !Total||116||4 |} ====International goals==== :Scores and results list Chile's goal tally first.Profile {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!

This is possible due to his stamina, technique, strength, and pace. ==Honours== ===Club=== Juventus *Serie A: 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314 *Supercoppa Italiana: 2012, 2013, 2015 ===International=== Chile *Copa Am\u00e9rica: 2015, 2016 ===Individual=== *Copa Am\u00e9rica Team of the Tournament: 2016 ==See also== *List of footballers with 100 or more caps ==References== ==External links== * * *Profile at La Gazzetta dello Sport Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:People from Maipo Province Category:Chilean footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Chile under-20 international footballers Category:Chile youth international footballers Category:Chilean expatriate footballers Category:Chilean expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Chilean expatriate sportspeople in Brazil Category:Association football midfielders Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in Brazil Category:2010 FIFA World Cup players Category:2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:2014 FIFA World Cup players Category:2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario players Category:2017 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica-winning players Category:Serie A players Category:Premier League players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:S\u00fcper Lig players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica footballers Category:Udinese Calcio players Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Olympique de Marseille players Category:Cagliari Calcio players Category:Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. footballers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:FIFA Century Club ",
