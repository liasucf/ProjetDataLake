    "text": "Giancarlo Parretti (born 23 October 1941) is an Italian financier. In 1989, he took over Cannon Film Group Inc. from Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. Almost immediately, he made plans to take over the storied French studio Path\u00e9, and changed Cannon's name to Path\u00e9 Communications. However, the French government blocked his bid due to concerns about his background. Undaunted, Parretti bought Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1990 for $1.2 billion, using money borrowed from a Dutch subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and contingent on future profits financing the purchase from mogul Kirk Kerkorian. Parretti then merged the former Cannon with the MGM purchase to create the short-lived MGM-Path\u00e9 Communications. Under Parretti's control, MGM released almost no films (one victim being the James Bond franchise), while Parretti enjoyed a Hollywood mogul lifestyle. He fired most of the accounting staff and appointed his 21-year-old daughter to a senior financial post. He used company money for presents to several girlfriends, including a former runner-up for Miss Universe. His reign at MGM became the basis for the film Get Shorty, which was produced by MGM. In 1991 his ownership dissolved in a flurry of lawsuits and a default to Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and Parretti faced securities fraud charges in the United States and Europe. In March 1999, he was found guilty of misuse of corporate funds and fraud and he was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison and fined 1 million francs by a Paris court.AFP-Extel News Limited.
