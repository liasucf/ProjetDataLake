    "text": "Ata-ur-Rahman () is a masculine Islamic given name. It is built from the Arabic words Ata, al- and Rahman. The name means \"gift of the most merciful\", ar-Rahman being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, usually by u. Because the letter r is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic and Urdu with letters corresponding to Ata al- Rahman, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Ata ur-Rahman. The transliteration Atta often appears for the first element and Rehman for the last, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
