It is located in Hsinchu County. == History == The Neiwan Line was completed on 11 September 1951. Although this line is a branch line, its standards are comparable to those of a main line except that it is not electrified. It became a popular tourist site in the early 2000s. The Neiwan Line closed temporarily between Hsinchu and Zhudong on 28 February 2007. This was to allow construction of the Liujia Line. The line was reopened on 11 November 2011. == Liujia branch == The Liujia Line, which connects TRA Hsinchu Station and THSR Hsinchu Station, branches off from the Neiwan Line at Zhuzhong Station. == Operations == All trains run between Hsinchu and Neiwan. The headway between each number of runs is about one hour. There has been one through- service between Neiwan and Taipei on Saturdays and Sundays since 2004. The Neiwan Line is principally serviced by Local Trains (\u5340\u9593\u8eca). Until the renovation of the Neiwan Line which accompanied the construction of the Liujia Line, only diesel-powered trains serviced the Neiwan Line as it was not electrified. Now, diesel-powered trains are only required on the segment between Zhuzhong and Neiwan. On some special occasions diesel-powered versions of the Tzu-Chiang Limited Express (\u81ea\u5f37\u865f) have been used on the route. == Stations == {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" !Name!!Chinese!!Taiwanese!!Hakka!!Transfers and Notes!!colspan=2|Location |- |Hsinchu||||Sin-tek||S\u00een-chuk |align=left|\u2192 West Coast line |rowspan=4|East||rowspan=4|Hsinchu |- |North Hsinchu||||Pak Sin-tek||Pet S\u00een- chuk |align=left|\u2192 West Coast line |- |Qianjia||||Chhian-kah||Chhi\u00ean- kap||align=left| |- |Xinzhuang||||Sin-chng||S\u00een-ch\u00f4ng||align=left| |- |Zhuzhong||||Tek-tiong||Chuk-ch\u00fbng |align=left|\u2192 Liujia line to Hsinchu HSR station |rowspan=4|Zhudong||rowspan=9|Hsinchu County |- |Shangyuan||||Si\u014dng-go\u00e2n||S\u00f4ng-y\u00e8n||align=left| |- |Ronghua||||\u00cang- h\u00f4a||Y\u00f9ng-f\u00e0||align=left| |- |Zhudong||||Tek-tang||Chuk-t\u00fbng||align=left| |- |Hengshan||||Ho\u00e2i\u207f-soa\u207f||V\u00e0ng-s\u00e2n||align=left| |rowspan=5|Hengshan |- |Jiuzantou||||K\u00e1u-ch\u00e0n-th\u00e2u||Ki\u00fa-chan-the\u00f9||align=left| |- |Hexing||||Ha\u030dp-heng||Ha\u030dp-h\u00een||align=left| |- |Fugui||||H\u00f9-ku\u00ec||Fu- kui||align=left| |- |Neiwan||||L\u0101i-oan||Nui-v\u00e2n||align=left| |} ==References== == External links == * Railway Reconstruction Bureau project page for the Liujia branch (in Chinese) Category:TRA routes Category:Railway lines opened in 1951 Category:1951 establishments in Taiwan Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Taiwan ",
