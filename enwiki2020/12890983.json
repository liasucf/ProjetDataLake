The Florida Entomoloical Society, Lutz, FL (USA) is a species of plant in the Juglandaceae family. This large, fast-growing tree can grow to tall at altitudes of 0.5\u20141.5 km in the \"Yungas\" or Montane Cloud Forest of Argentina (including the provinces of Tucum\u00e1n, Salta and Jujuy) and in Bolivia. It is more frost resistant than the Persian Walnut (J. regia). It is threatened by habitat loss. J. australis is a spreading deciduous tree, up to 25 m. wide which produces first quality lumber, with a straight trunk up to 6 m. tall and up to 5 dm. in diameter. The wood is dense (640 kg/m3), hard, and strong. Upon drying, the radial shrinkage is 2.2%, the tangential 4.7%. The pinnately compound leaves are borne alternately, and bear up to fifteen oval-lanceolate finely serrate leaflets. The immature fruits are pickled whole for human consumption. The mature nuts are also eaten. Like most walnuts, J. australis produces juglone, an allelopathic substance which decreases competition from other plants growing nearby. The concentrated extract of the husk is also used as a vermifuge. ==References== australis Category:Edible nuts and seeds Category:Near threatened plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Plants described in 1879 ",
