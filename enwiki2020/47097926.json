He was tried and convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to prison, only to be later transported to Australia. ==Early life== O'Mahony was born about 1840 in Macroom, County Cork, Ireland but later moved to Dublin. He grew up in a time where starvation and disease were commonplace, particularly in the countryside, during the period commonly referred to as the Potato Famine. Given his later pursuits it is fair to say he came from a family which either owned land or had the money with which to educate him. ==The Fenian movement== By the time O'Mahony was 20 years old he had become a close follower of James Stephens and his fight to create a free and independent Ireland by removing the perceived tyranny of the British. To this extent he became a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood or IRB. Joseph Denieffe (1906) writes of him as \"good and earnest Cornelius O'Mahony ...an unsophisticated but gifted school teacher\".Joseph Denieffe, 1906.

O'Mahony resigned from his post with the National Board of Education, and the National schools of Ireland, in 1863 to concentrate on his work with the IRB and its newspaper The Irish People. He remained on the paper's staff as assistant bookkeeper and part-time journalist until it was raided and closed down in 1865 when the British felt that an armed uprising was imminent. At that time he was arrested along with Charles Kickham, Thomas Clarke Luby, John O'Leary, Jeremiah O'Donovan and others. The charges laid at Kilmainham Gaol included, \"Conspiring To Depose The Queen, To Compel Her Majesty To Change Her Measures And Counsels, To Move And Stir Foreigners To Invade Ireland\"\"Ireland Prison Registers, 1790-1924,\" (Database with images) Retrieved on 21 June 2015 from FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KM34-P6P An abortive uprising known as the Fenian Rising took place in 1867 but was quickly put down. ==Conviction and Transportation== For his participation in the rebellion O'Mahony was convicted at the Assizes in Dublin on 16 January 1866 following a retrial, as the first jury was dismissed by the judge. The defence implored the subsequent jury to show leniency in his case and he was eventually sentenced to five years penal servitude.The Freemans Journal (Dublin, Ireland) 17 January 1866 p.4.

He left behind both the grim reminders of his convict past and his young family. On arriving in Melbourne he chose to settle in the suburb of West Melbourne which had a large Irish population. With his prior experience he was asked to take up the position of head teacher at St Mary's Primary School, West Melbourne. In 1878 he was made an honorary member of the Melbourne branch of the St Patrick's Society which was dedicated to supporting local Irish Catholics, promoting Irish culture and independence for Ireland.
