Born into the noble family of Schack, he was the third child and eldest son of the Danish field marshal and privy councillor Hans Schack, and his wife Anna Blome.Danmarks Adels Aarbog, 1932, p. 62. In 1667, he was made a hofjunker at the Danish court. From 1670 to 1671 he was educated at the knight academy in Saumur that prepared aristocratic youth for state and military service, and in 1671, he was made a kammerjunker at the Danish court. In 1674 he was appointed amtmann of the Amt of Riberhus, and on 14 June the same year he was awarded the Order of the Dannebrog. At the death of his father in 1676, he inherited the large manors of Schackenborg and Gram in Southern Jutland, and Gisselfeld in Zealand. Later in the same year, on 23 June 1676, he was awarded the title of feudal count (), as the County of Schackenborg was created from the manors of Schackenborg, S\u00f8damg\u00e5rd, Solvig, and Store T\u00f8nde.
