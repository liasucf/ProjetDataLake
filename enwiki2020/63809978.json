    "text": "Community is an American comedy television series created by Dan Harmon. The show ran for six seasons and 110 episodes, with its first five seasons airing on NBC from September 17, 2009 to April 17, 2014 and the final season airing on Yahoo! Screen from March 17, 2015 to June 2, 2015. Set at Greendale Community College, the series stars an ensemble cast playing members of a diverse study group. The main cast includes Joel McHale (Jeff), Gillian Jacobs (Britta), Danny Pudi (Abed), Yvette Nicole Brown (Shirley), Alison Brie (Annie), Donald Glover (Troy), Ken Jeong (Chang), Chevy Chase (Pierce), and Jim Rash (the Dean). A comedy about friendships and relationships, the show uses frequent pop culture references and meta-humor, as well as high-concept episodes including documentary spoofs, action movie homages and storylines inspired by movies. Despite being critically acclaimed and gaining a cult following, the show faced production issues and repeatedly came close to cancellation. The third season was subject to a mid-season replacement, its second half airing months later than originally planned. Dan Harmon was fired as showrunner for the fourth season, though he was rehired by the fifth season. The end of the fourth season and middle of the fifth season saw the departures of Chevy Chase as Pierce and Donald Glover as Troy, respectively. The show was cancelled by NBC and moved to Yahoo! Screen for its sixth and final season, which saw the departure of Yvette Nicole Brown as Shirley. Community was effectively cancelled when Yahoo! Screen shut down in 2016. Over the course of its run, the series was nominated for many awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards (winning one), ten Critics' Choice Television Awards (winning one), and six Satellite Awards (winning one). Among the main cast, McHale and Pudi were the most nominated individuals with seven nominations each; McHale won two awards and Pudi won one. Several episodes, including \"Introduction to Statistics\", \"Modern Warfare\", \"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\", and \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", received individual nominations for awards. == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%\" summary=\"Eleven wins and forty- seven nominations\" |+ |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Award ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:33%;\"| Category !
