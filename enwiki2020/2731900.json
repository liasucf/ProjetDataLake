    "text": "The United States Air Force established the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS) in June 1996. AFAMS mission is to facilitate integrated, realistic and efficient operational training across warfighting domains to enable full-spectrum readiness. AFAMS manages the enterprises level programs in the Live/Virtual/Constructive, Operational Training Infrastructure, and constructive environments. AFAMS directly supports the USAF & DoD training mission in five functional areas: mission rehearsal, exercises & operational training, warfighter M&S; technology improvements, database and model management, enterprise requirements and standards. Air Force Mission Directive 56 established AFAMS with the following mandates: * Implementation of Air Force, Joint, and DoD M&S; policy and standards. * Support for corporate Air Force M&S; planning, requirements, and investment. * Establishment, transition, and integration of major Air Force M&S; initiatives and programs. * Support for Air Force decision making and mission execution. AFAMS is a field operating agency operating under the Training and Readiness (AF/A3T) directorate within the Headquarters Air Force organization at the Pentagon. AFAMS is located in the Central Florida Research Park, adjacent to the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division and Naval Support Activity Orlando, along with numerous DoD, joint, service, contractor, and educational organizations focused on modeling, simulation and training. Proximity to these other agencies is intended to provide the Air Force \"the maximum leverage and advantage of the developing programs and technologies enhancing the Air Force ability to provide ready forces.\" ==References== ==External links== * AFAMS Homepage Agency for Modeling and Simulation Category:Scientific organizations based in the United States Category:1996 establishments in the United States Category:Military units and formations established in 1996 Category:Organizations based in Orlando, Florida ",
