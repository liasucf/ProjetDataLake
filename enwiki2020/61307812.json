    "text": "Free is the eighteenth studio album by American rock singer Iggy Pop, released by Caroline International and Loma Vista Recordings on September 6, 2019. It features contributions from Noveller and Leron Thomas, and the title track was released along with the album announcement. A music video for the album's second single, \"James Bond\", was released on August 14, 2019. ==Background and recording== The album has been described as \"reflect[ing]\" the exhaustion of post-tour life\" as well as \"uniquely somber and contemplative\" by Iggy Pop, who also called it \"an album in which other artists speak for me, but I lend my voice\". He went on to say that after touring in support of Post Pop Depression, he felt \"drained\" and wanted to be \"free\", so the album \"just kind of happened to me, and I let it happen\". In an interview with Exclaim!, he elaborated: \"I wanted to wiggle out of the frame of rock instrumentation that I'd gotten encased in over time. There's nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't what I felt at this time. I was interested in working with some fine musicians who broke out of the normal time and space.\" Pop first learned of Sarah Lipstate, who records under the name Noveller, and Thomas while hosting his BBC Radio 6 Music show; he contacted them to express his appreciation, which eventually led to collaborations. In 2016, Pop invited Lipstate to open for him during the Post Pop Depression tour. Of Thomas, Pop said, \"little by little, his stuff was knocking me out, and I really wanted to sing [on] his songs.\" The track \"We Are the People\" features lyrics written by Lou Reed in 1970 but first published posthumously in 2018. The words \"totally resonated\" with Pop: \"Like, 'wham', like 'pow'. It was the first poem in a book of lyrics and when I saw it, I thought, 'My God, this is the country today as I understand it, or at least one legitimate portrayal of the country today. It really spoke to me.\" \"Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night\" is a reading of the poem of the same name by Dylan Thomas. Pop had previously done a recording of the poem at the request of an advertising agency, who wanted it for a commercial; Pop provided a reading, but initially didn't think much of it. By the time of the recording of Free, Pop had grown to like it and decided to rerecord the poem and have Lipstate and Thomas improvise around it. ==Critical reception== Free received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 73, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 18 reviews. ==Production== * Iggy Pop \u2013 vocals * Leron Thomas \u2013 trumpet (all tracks except 10), keyboards (tracks 2, 7 and 8) * Noveller \u2013 guitar \"guitarscape\" (tracks 1, 9 and 10) * Kenny Ruby \u2013 bass (tracks 3, 5, 6), piano (track 3), synthetizer (tracks 5 and 6) * Tibo Brandalise \u2013 drums (tracks 3, 5 and 6) * Gr\u00e9goire Fauque \u2013 guitar (tracks 5 and 6) * Aaron Nevezie \u2013 guitar, bass (tracks 2 and 7), keyboards (track 7) * Chris Berry \u2013 drums (track 2) * Thomas Glass \u2013 drums (track 4) * Robin Sherman \u2013 bass (track 4) * Ari Teitel \u2013 guitar (track 4) * Faith Vern \u2013 vocals (track 4) * Florian Pellissier \u2013 keyboards (track 6) * Rangeard Mickael \u2013 mix and mastering ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 91 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 18 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italian Albums (FIMI) | 42 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 31 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) | 183 |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Iggy Pop albums Category:Loma Vista Recordings albums ",
