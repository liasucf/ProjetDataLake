Initially the cemetery was located on several hills in the borough of Lychakiv, following the imperial Austro-Hungarian edict ordering that all cemeteries be moved outside of the city limits. The original project was prepared by , the head of the Lviv University botanical garden. In mid-1850s the cemetery was expanded significantly by Tytus Tch\u00f3rzewski, who created the present network of alleys and round-abouts. It then became the main city cemetery, and soon most other cemeteries were closed. The two largest that remained were the Yanivskiy Cemetery (), with many working class graves and the adjacent New Jewish Cemetery. Lychakivskiy Cemetery was used by all Christian sects in the city: in addition to Roman Catholics, it also included Eastern Rite Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox. After World War II the city was annexed by the Soviet Union to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the majority of the surviving pre-war inhabitants of the city were expelled to the former German areas awarded to Poland after the Yalta Conference. This started a period of devastation of historical monuments located at the cemetery. Up to 1971 many of the sculptures were destroyed. However, in 1975 the cemetery was declared a historical monument and the degradation ended. Since the late 1980s, the cemetery has seen constant rebuilding and refurbishment and continues to be one of the principal tourist attractions of Lw\u00f3w. In late 2006 the city administration announced plans to transfer the tombs of Stepan Bandera, Yevhen Konovalets, Andriy Melnyk and other key leaders of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) / Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) to a new area of the cemetery dedicated to the Ukrainian national liberation struggle.NKVD victims to be buried in Lviv on November 7 // \u00abForUm\u00bb (www.for-ua.com) 25 October 2006. == Cemetery sections == {| | |Lychakiv Cemetery plan : :Plan legend: :: 1 \u2014 Field of Mars :: 2 \u2014 NKVD victims' graves (1941 \u0433.) :: 3 \u2014 Outstanding Poles Pantheon :: 4 \u2014 The eldest graves :: 5 \u2014 Main gates :: 6 \u2014 1863 January rebels' quarter :: 7 \u2014 1830\u22121831 November rebels' quarter :: 8 \u2014 Ukrainian National Army Memorial :: 9 \u2014 Lviv Defenders' Cemetery (Cemetery of Lw\u00f3w Eaglets) |} Members of the National Scout Organization of Ukraine \u00abPlast\u00bb near the Monument to the SS-Division \u00abGalicia\u00bb, 2008. === Ukrainian National Army Memorial === The Ukrainian National Army Memorial (Number 8 on the plan) is devoted to the Ukrainian National Army soldiers buried in the cemetery, including soldiers of the SS Division \"Galicia\".

Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw\u00f3w Stefan Stec, Stefan Bastyr and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Toru\u0144 === Lviv Defenders' Cemetery === The Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw\u00f3w (Cemetery of Eaglets, ) is a memorial and a burial place for the Poles and their allies who died in Lviv during the hostilities of the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918\u22121919) and Polish-Soviet War (1919\u22121921). The complex is a part of the city's historic Lychakiv Cemetery. There are about 3000 graves in that part of the cemetery; some from the Lw\u00f3w Eaglets young militia volunteers, after whom that part of the cemetery is named. It was one of the most famous necropolises of the interwar Poland. In 1925 the ashes of one of the unknown defenders of Lviv were transferred to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw. After that was built the \u00abPolish mausoleum\u00bb (Lw\u00f3w Eaglets Memorial). After World War II the cemetery of Lw\u00f3w Eaglets was completely destroyed and turned into a truck depot and at one time Eaglets Cemetery was damaged with a bulldozer.Symbolic Reconciliation, 20 July 2005, Warsaw Voice. Last accessed on 22 March 2006. Due to the history of complex Polish-Ukrainian relations, the Polish Eaglets Cemetery was neglected because the Ukrainian authorities did not want to rebuild this monument of young Polish soldiers defending the city in 1920s. Though in the late 1980s, workers of a Polish company which were working in Khmelnytskyi started to redecorate and rebuild the necropolis from its ruins (which was not always legal according to Ukrainian law). Although the Ukrainian authorities tried to stop the works several times, the Poles managed to renovate this important memorial of great Lvovians. Since 1999 there is also a monument to the Sich Riflemen located just outside the Polish mausoleum. Since the fall of communism, the cemetery had been rebuilt and refurbished. It was finally reopened on 24 June 2005. === 1863 January rebels' hill === In the back part of the cemetery (\u2116 6 on the plan) on a separate field indicated original steel crosses, located \u00ab1863 rebels' hill\u00bb.
