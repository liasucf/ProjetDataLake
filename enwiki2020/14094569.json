The station is owned by a consortium of Equinor (formerly Statoil) and \u00d8rsted A/S, and will be operated by the latter. Construction costs are estimated at NOK 4 billion.European CO2 Test Centre Mongstad (Vattenfall AB) The power station will have an installed effect of 280 MW in electricity production and 350 MW in heat. The energy will be used to operate the Mongstad Refinery as well to supply the Troll Gas Field with power. The plant will use 0.7 billion normal cubic meter (BCM) of gas per year. Emissions of carbon dioxide will be 1.2 million tonnes.Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage in Norway (Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy) The power station has been subject to controversy in Norway, based upon the potential increase in emission of greenhouse gases. Statoil has entered into an implementation agreement in cooperation with Gassnova which representing the Norwegian government in matters relating to Carbon capture and storage, to develop solutions for carbon dioxide capture at Mongstad. Early in 2009, Statoil delivered a master plan for full-scale CO2 capture at Mongstad.CO2 Master Plan Mongstad (Statoil) ==References== ==Related Reading== *CCS projects in Norway by Bj\u00f8rn-Erik Haugan Category:Natural gas-fired power stations in Norway Category:Equinor Category:\u00d8rsted (company) Category:Proposed natural gas-fired power stations ",
