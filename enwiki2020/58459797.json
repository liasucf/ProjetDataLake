    "text": "The Tupolev OOS was a Soviet concept for an air-launched, single-stage-to- orbit spaceplane. The orbiter's carrier aircraft, the Antonov AKS, was to have been built from two conjoined Antonov An-225 airframes. The launch system was proposed in the late 1980s, but never developed past the design stage. ==See also== * Buran programme * Scaled Composites Stratolaunch * Conroy Virtus ==References== ==External links== * 3-D renders of this and other proposed launch systems by Vadim Lukashevich on Buran.ru Category:Spaceplanes Category:Soviet and Russian military aircraft Category:Single-stage-to-orbit ",
