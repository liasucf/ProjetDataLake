The term is also used for the stiffened supporter or supportasse used to hold such a collar in place. The term may originate from a conjectured Spanish word picadillo, from picado meaning punctured or pierced or the Welsh word pica meaning pointed. This is similar to the Spanish word picadura, used for the lace collars of the seventeenth century that contained much elaborate cut work point lace. Examples of a piccadill can be seen on portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and other portraits of her contemporaries such as Sir Walter Raleigh. Piccadilly, a street in central London, is believed to be named after the piccadill, perhaps because a landowner in the area once made his fortune from them.\"piccadill\", Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition 1989 ==See also== *Ruff (clothing) a similar, contemporary fashion. ==References== Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) ",
