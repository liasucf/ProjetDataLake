Later he was employed as an organist by the prince Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy in Eisenstadt, where he also conducted opera performances. From 1814, Henneberg was organist at the Hofkirche in Vienna, and from 1818 to 1822 also in the Imperial Court Music Chapel. Henneberg played a decisive role in the rehearsal of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. After Mozart himself conducted the premiere on 30 September and 1 October 1791, Henneberg also took over the direction of the following performances. Henneberg also created several operas himself, which enjoyed great popularity at the time. In 1797 he composed together with Ludwig van Beethoven menuets and allemandes for a mask ball of the Pensionsgesellschaft bildender K\u00fcnstler, which was performed on 26 November 1797 in the Gro\u00dfer Redoutensaal der Wiener Hofburg. == Work (Operas) == * Der Stein der Weisen, together with Benedikt Schack, Franz Xaver Gerl, Emanuel Schikaneder and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, premiered 11 September 1790 in Theater auf der Wieden (and also produced by Bampton Classical Opera in 2002) * Der redliche Landmann, 1792 * ', 1793 * Die Eisenk\u00f6nigin, 1793 * Die Waldm\u00e4nner, 1793 * Der Scherenschleifer, 1795 * Das J\u00e4germ\u00e4dchen, 1798 * Konrad Langbart von Friedburg, 1799 * Mina und Peru, 1799 == Further reading == * Peter Branscombe and David J.
