    "text": "The UM12C is a type of diesel-electric locomotive manufactured by GE for Southeast Asian rail companies. It is currently in service with the State Railway of Thailand. It was also operated by the Manila Railroad Company (later the Philippine National Railways) from 1956 until the late 1990s. While the units for both companies feature a shovelnose layout, the MRR locomotives were single-ended and had a cowl unit cab, the SRT locomotives are double- ended cab forward units. ==References== UM12C Category:C-C locomotives Category:Metre gauge diesel locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1963 Category:3 ft 6 in gauge locomotives ",
