    "text": "Feynman diagram of the muon capture. A negatively charged muon is captured by a proton. The proton is transformed into a neutron and a muon-neutrino is emitted. The interaction is mediated by a W-boson. Muon capture is the capture of a negative muon by a proton, usually resulting in production of a neutron and a neutrino, and sometimes a gamma photon. Muon capture by heavy nuclei often leads to emission of particles; most often neutrons, but charged particles can be emitted as well. Ordinary muon capture (OMC) involves capture of a negative muon from the atomic orbital without emission of a gamma photon: : + -> \u03bc + Radiative muon capture (RMC) is a radiative version of OMC, where a gamma photon is emitted: : + -> \u03bc + + Theoretical motivation for the study of muon capture on the proton is its connection to the proton's induced pseudoscalar form factor gp. == Practical application - Nuclear waste disposal == Muon capture is being investigated for practical application in radioactive waste disposal, for example in the artificial transmutation of large quantities of long-lived radioactive waste that have been produced globally by fission reactors. Radioactive waste can be transmuted to stable isotopes following irradiation by an incident muon () beam from a compact proton accelerator source. ==References== * * * Nagamine, Kanetada (2016) \"Nuclear Waste Disposal Method and its apparatus using muon-nuclear-absorption\".
