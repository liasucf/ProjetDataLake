Born in Taylorville, Illinois, he was known by his middle name, Eugene, or as \"Gene.\" New York Times - August 31, 1924 In the 1870s, thirteen-year-old Leigh became involved in Quarter Horse racing on bush tracks in his native Illinois. After learning to condition Thoroughbreds for flat racing he set himself up as a trainer in a partnership with jockey Tom Kiley.

Milton Young for $101 an acre then bought it back in 1899 for $24 an acre.New York Times - January 16, 1899 The December 4, 1898 issue of the New York Times reported that going into the 1899 racing season, Eugene Leigh had the largest stable in the United States.
