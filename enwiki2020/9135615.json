Wu's father was an engineer at Ford Motor Company and his father lived in Detroit, Michigan. In his book Yellow and other writings, Wu recounts how his childhood experience of being the only Asian American among his classmates and the schoolyard taunting he endured as a result of his race alerted him to racial inequalities at an early age. He further describes how his attempts to assimilate and reject what was \"Asian\" only seemed to reinforce his marked difference to his peers. When Wu was a teenager, a Chinese American man, Vincent Chin, was killed by two white autoworkers in Highland Park, Michigan. The multiple criminal and civil cases that ensued throughout the 1980s have been recognized as birthing the Asian American victims and Asian American movement, and were marked as the 34th Michigan Legal Milestone in 2009.Hwang, Roland. \"Killing Spawned Asian American Civil Rights Movement,\" Michigan Bar Journal 30 (2009).
