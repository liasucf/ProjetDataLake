The series stars Paul Stanley and Roxana Castellanos. The series has been renewed for a second season, that premiered on October 5, 2020. == Plot == Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n is a partying and irresponsible man who lives off his father's money. When he dies, his father decides to leave his fortune to Carlos, with one condition: he must get married. Otherwise, the inheritance would go to the hands of his cousin Diego, an ambitious man, capable of everything for money. Carlos fulfills the condition imposed on him by his father and marries Deyanira, a waitress with a brother and sister and severe economic problems. Carlos never imagined that the will would have a clause stipulating that his marriage should last a minimum of 5 years. In the second season, Carlos and Deyanira continue to pretend that they love each other and maintain a solid relationship. Diego now seeks to divorce them and keep the money, next to his faithful and innocent squire, Mat\u00edas. Pamela, Carlos's ex- girlfriend, after finding out about this marriage, will seek to separate them, as she does not overcome that Carlos has chosen Deyanira and not her as his wife. == Cast == * Paul Stanley as Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n \"Charly\" * Roxana Castellanos as Deyanira Rub\u00ed * B\u00e1rbara Islas as Britny * Luz Ald\u00e1n as Jeny (season 1) * Luis Orozco as Mat\u00edas * Agust\u00edn Arana as Diego Ru\u00edz * Mauricio Mancera as Javier * Macaria as Pilar * Ceci Flores as Dayana * Alexander Taviz\u00f3n as Max * Patricio Castillo as Gregorio * Eva Cede\u00f1o as Pamela (season 2) * \u00c9dgar Vivar as Licenciado (guest, season 1; main, season 2) == Episodes == === Series overview === === Season 1 (2019) === === Season 2 (2020) === == References == == External links == * Category:2019 Mexican television series debuts Category:Las Estrellas original programming Category:Mexican television sitcoms Category:Television series by Televisa Category:Spanish-language television shows ",
