    "text": "The Snake Nebula (also known as Barnard 72) is a dark nebula in the Ophiuchus constellation. It is a small but readily apparent SP-shaped dust lane that snakes out in front of the Milky Way star clouds from the north-north-west edge of the bowl of the Pipe Nebula. Its thickness runs between 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 and runs around 6\u2032 in the north-west / south-east orientation. A good view in a 4\" to 6\" telescope requires clear dark skies. It is part of the much larger Dark Horse Nebula. To the right side of the Snake Nebula is found Barnard 68. Below it are found Barnard 69, Barnard 70, and Barnard 74. ==External links== * * Category:Dark nebulae Category:Barnard objects ",
