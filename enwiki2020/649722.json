    "text": "The Batchawana River is a river in Algoma and Sudbury Districts of Ontario, Canada, which empties into Batchawana Bay on Lake Superior north of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The name \"Batchawana\" is derived from an Ojibwe word meaning \"turbulent waters\". The Hudson's Bay Company established a fur trading post on the bay during the 19th century. North of Batchawana Bay is Pancake Bay, so named because fur traders travelling east from Fort William had only enough flour left to make pancakes. Batchawana River Provincial Park encompasses portions of the river, and Batchawana Bay Provincial Park, with a large sandy beach, is located on Batchawana Bay. The Algoma Central Railway crosses the river at the settlement of Batchewana. ==Tributaries== *Kerwin Creek (left) *Norberg Creek (left) *Griffin Creek (left) *Little Batchawana River (right) *Mongoose Creek (left) *St. Clair Creek (left) *Alder Creek (right) *Quinn River (left) *Emerson Creek (left) *Percy Creek (right) *Toll Creek (right) ==See also== *List of Ontario rivers ==References== * * Category:Rivers of Algoma District Category:Tributaries of Lake Superior Category:Rivers of Sudbury District ",
