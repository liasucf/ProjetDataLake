During the government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, he served as chief of staff to Mullah Omar, as well as his personal secretary, translator, and press spokesman. In addition to Pashto, he speaks English, Arabic, Urdu, and Persian. He was born in 1976 in Jelahor village, Arghandab District, Kandahar Province and belongs to a prominent religious family from the Sayyid tribe. On 3 August 2015, following the death of Taliban founder Mohammed Omar and the ascension of Mullah Akhtar Mansour, Agha resigned as head of the Taliban political office in Doha, Qatar which he served from 2009. He stated he was stepping down to avoid \"expected future disputes\" while also questioning the legitimacy of the newly appointed leader of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansour. He was succeeded by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, a former anti- Soviet fighter. ==References..== Category:Afghan politicians Category:Living people Category:Taliban leaders Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
