    "text": "thumb Eydon Hall is a Palladian stately home near the village of Eydon, in Northamptonshire. It is a Grade I listed building, and is currently in use as a private residence. ==Architecture== The house, built of ironstone, remains broadly as it was originally designed, with nine bedrooms and four major reception rooms across two main floors. The top floor, with servants quarters, is hidden from view by balustrades around the side of the roof, and there is a large basement. The house has a number of unusual features - perhaps the most interesting being that the large portico traditional on such houses is placed at the rear, not the front. Each of the four facades are designed differently, with the west facade having a large semi-circular bow in it to contain an oval drawing room.Elegance at a price , Banbury Today, 15 May 2004 ==History== The site was originally occupied by Eydon Lodge, which was acquired in 1788 for \u00a36,600 by the Reverend Francis Annesley.
