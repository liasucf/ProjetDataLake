    "text": "The following is a list of AM radio stations transmitting in C-QUAM stereo throughout the world, which can be sorted by their call signs, frequencies, cities of license, country of origin, licensees, and programming formats. Australian callsigns omit the ITU prefix VL when said on-air, leaving just the district number and suffix. The VL prefix is listed here to keep the stations in their correct order from a worldwide callsign standpoint. Similarly, Japanese stations sometimes omit the JO prefix in favor of just the last two letters of their callsigns. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Call sign or name (in quotes) ! data-sort-type=\"number\" |kHz !City of License !Country !Owner (Licensee) !Format |- |CFCO |630 |Chatham-Kent, Ontario |Canada |Blackburn Radio |Country |- |CHQR |770 |Calgary, Alberta |Canada |Corus Entertainment |News/Talk |- |CHQT |880 |Edmonton, Alberta |Canada |Corus Entertainment |All- news |- |CKJH |750 |Melfort, Saskatchewan |Canada |Jim Pattison Group |Adult Hits |- |DWRS |927 |Vigan, Ilocos Sur |Philippines |Solidnorth Broadcasting System |News/Talk |- |DWWW |774 |San Juan, Metro Manila |Philippines |Interactice Broadcast Media, Inc. |Full service |- |DZME |1530 |Pasig, National Capital Region |Philippines |Capitol Broadcasting Center |Variety |- |DZRH |666 |Pasay, National Capital Region |Philippines |Manila Broadcasting Company |News/Talk/Drama |- |HLSQ |792 |Ilsan, Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province |South Korea |Seoul Broadcasting System |Trot Music/K-Pop |- |JOAR |1053 |Nagoya |Japan |Chunichi Shimbun |Talk, Sports |- |JOLF |1242 |Tokyo, Kanto Region |Japan |Nippon Broadcasting System |Talk, sports |- |JOUF |1314 |Osaka, Kansai Region |Japan |Sankei Shimbun |Talk, sports |- |JOVF |1431 |Wakayama |Japan | | |- |KALV |1430 |Alva, Oklahoma |United States |MM&K; of Alva |Country |- |KAZG |1440 |Scottsdale, Arizona |United States |Hubbard Broadcasting |Oldies |- |KBPS |1450 |Portland, Oregon |United States |Portland Public Schools |High school radio |- |KCLI |1320 |Clinton, Oklahoma |United States |Wright Broadcasting Systems |Sports |- |KCSR |610 |Chadron, Nebraska |United States |Chadrad Communications, Inc. |Country |- |KDIA |1640 |Vallejo, California |United States |Baybridge Communications |Religion |- |KDTH |1370 |Dubuque, Iowa |United States |Radio Dubuque, Inc. |Adult standards/MOR |- |KDYA |1190 |Vallejo, California |United States |Baybridge Communications, LLC |Urban gospel |- |KEYZ |660 |Williston, North Dakota |United States |Cherry Creek Radio |News/talk, country |- |KFRO |1370 |Longview, Texas |United States |RCA Broadcasting, LLC |Talk |- |KGRN |1410 |Grinnell, Iowa |United States |Alpha Media |Adult contemporary |- |KIKO |1340 |Apache Junction, Arizona |United States |John Low |Classic Country |- |KJAA |1240 |Globe, Arizona |United States |Globecasting, Inc. |Oldies |- |KJAN |1220 |Atlantic, Iowa |United States |Wireless Communications Corp. |Adult Contemporary |- |KLXX |1270 |Bismarck, North Dakota |United States |Townsquare Media |Talk |- |KQWB |1660 |West Fargo, North Dakota |United States |Radio FM Media |Sports |- |KRIB |1490 |Mason City, Iowa |United States |Alpha Media |Adult standards |- |KRML |1410 |Carmel, California |United States |CVAC, Inc. |Adult album alternative |- |KROS |1340 |Clinton, Iowa |United States |KROS Broadcasting, Inc. |Variety |- |KSIB |1520 |Creston, Iowa |United States |G.
