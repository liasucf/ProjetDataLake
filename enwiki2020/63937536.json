A speech scroll issues from the mouth of Diocr\u00e8s' corpse. Raymond Diocr\u00e8s (died 1084) was a professor of the University of Paris. Diocr\u00e8s is known for a miracle that took place at his funeral, which was depicted in several artistic works. The story goes that at his funeral Diocr\u00e8s briefly returned to life, in order to swear to the assembly that God had judged and condemned his soul. One of his students, Bruno of Cologne, upon witnessing this miracle, decided to abandon civil life and become a monk, thus founding the Carthusian order. The funeral of Raymond Diocr\u00e8s figures in illuminated scenes from the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. Painters such as Vincenzo Carducci, Gregorio Baus\u00e1, and Eustache Le Sueur also depicted scenes from Diocr\u00e8s' life, especially those related to Bruno of Cologne. Category:1084 deaths ",
