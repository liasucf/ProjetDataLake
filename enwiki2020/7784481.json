    "text": "Mvoly\u00e9 or Mvolye is a neighbourhood of Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon. Around 1900, during Cameroon's colonial period, the site was part of the lands ruled by Karl Atangana. Atangana donated part of the area to the German Pallottine Fathers, a Roman Catholic missionary group. The Ewondo people had previously been unable to settle it due to a large rock there. The Fathers built a permanent mission, which opened Central and Eastern Cameroon to Christianisation. Atangana remained chief of the area. == Local culture and heritage == ===Places and monuments=== ====Basilica Mary Queen of the Apostles of Mvoly\u00e9==== The basilica is located at the southern exit of Yaound\u00e9 on the hill of Mvoly\u00e9.
