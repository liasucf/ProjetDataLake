The season marked the 102nd season of Big Ten play. Ohio State won the Big Ten Conference regular season championship by two games over Wisconsin. Wisconsin's Alando Tucker was named Big Ten Player of the Year. Ohio State also won the Big Ten Tournament by defeating Wisconsin. As a result of the win, Ohio State received the conference's automatic bid to the 2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Six Big Ten teams (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue, and Wisconsin) were invited to the NCAA Tournament. Ohio State advanced to the National Championship game before losing to Florida. Michigan received a bid to the National Invitation Tournament and lost in the second round. ==Preconference schedules== ===Tournaments=== ===ACC\u2013Big Ten Challenge=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- align=\"center\" !ACC Team !Big Ten Team !Outcome !Location !ACC !B10 |- |NC State |Michigan |NCSU 74\u201367 |Raleigh, North Carolina |align=center|X | |- |No. 19 Maryland |Illinois |UMD 72\u201366 |Champaign, Illinois |align=center|X | |- |Florida State |No. 13 Wisconsin |WISC 81\u201366 |Madison, Wisconsin | |align=center|X |- |No. 24 Georgia Tech |Penn State |GT 77\u201373 |Atlanta, Georgia |align=center|X | |- |No. 10 Duke |Indiana |Duke 54\u201351 |Durham, North Carolina |align=center|X | |- |Miami |Northwestern |NW 61\u201359 |Evanston, Illinois | |align=center|X |- |Boston College |Michigan State |BC 65\u201358 |Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts |align=center|X | |- |Virginia |Purdue |PUR 61\u201359 |West Lafayette, Indiana | |align=center|X |- |Virginia Tech |Iowa |VT 69\u201365 |Blacksburg, Virginia |align=center|X | |- |No. 6 North Carolina |No. 1 Ohio State |UNC 98\u201389 |Chapel Hill, North Carolina |align=center|X | |- |Clemson |Minnesota |CLEM 90\u201368 |Minneapolis, Minnesota |align=center|X | |-class=\"sortbottom\" !Result !! !!
