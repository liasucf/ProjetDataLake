Subsequent investigations revealed that he also murdered a woman at Yimoon-dong. Before Jeong Nam Gyu confessed his murder at Yimoon- dong, another serial killer Yoo Young-Chul falsely confessed that he also had committed the Yimoon murder. On April 12, 2007, he was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court and detained in Seoul Detention Center.

He was rushed to the hospital, but died the following morning.\uc5f0\uc1c4\uc0b4\uc778\ubc94 \uc815\ub0a8\uaddc \uc11c\uc6b8\uad6c\uce58\uc18c\uc11c \uc790\uc0b4(2\ubcf4), \uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4, 2009\ub144 11\uc6d4 22\uc77c. == References == == See also == * Yoo Young-chul * Kang Ho-sun * Chijon family Category:1969 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody Category:South Korean people convicted of murder Category:South Korean serial killers Category:Suicides by hanging in South Korea Category:Psychopathy Category:Male serial killers ",
