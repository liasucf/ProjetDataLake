At the Police Station, Jenna suddenly appears, and tells Marco and Spencer that she was trying to protect herself from Noel the night she was holding a gun at the school for the blind, and now she has been hiding since. Jenna further tells them that Noel wanted money from Jenna, which Charlotte gave her for her eye surgery, and that he is Sara's killer, which Spencer is skeptical of.
