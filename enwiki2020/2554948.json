    "text": "Druh\u00e1 Tr\u00e1va (\"Second Grass\" in Czech) is a Czech bluegrass band originally formed in Czechoslovaia in 1991 by Robert K\u0159es\u0165an and Lubo\u0161 Malina, and currently based in Czech Republic. They have released 13 studio albums, plus a variety of live albums, collaborative albums, and side projects. They have been described as evolving from underground musicians who subverted Communism to international artists who \"upend convention\". ==History== Czech musicians have long been interested in Americana, bluegrass, folk, and early country music, leading to the development of the Czech bluegrass genre in the mid-1960s. A regional tour by Pete Seeger in 1964 was a particular inspiration to Czech musicians.[ allmusic.com biography of Druh\u00e1 Tr\u00e1va], retrieved 7 Mar 2013 The Communist regime was hostile to such music, and Czech musicians with Western folk and rock influences helped advocate for the country's eventual independence. Singer/songwriter/mandolinist Robert K\u0159es\u0165an had been a fan of American roots music since age 10 in the late 1960s, listening to records that had been smuggled into the then-Communist Czechoslovakia; K\u0159es\u0165an was particularly fond of bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe. K\u0159es\u0165an went to great pains to find records and learned how to play the music on homemade instruments. He joined the band Poutnici in 1979. K\u0159es\u0165an and another member of Poutnici, banjo player Lubo\u0161 Malina, formed Druh\u00e1 Tr\u00e1va in 1991. The original lineup of Druh\u00e1 Tr\u00e1va also included dobroist/guitarist Lubo\u0161 Novotn\u00fd, bassist Ji\u0159\u00ed Meisner, and guitarist Pavel Malina. The band's lineup has changed considerably over its history, though K\u0159es\u0165an, Malina, and Novotn\u00fd have been in the band consistently since 1991. The current lineup also includes guitarist Emil Formanek and bassist Tomas Liska. The band's first album, Robert Krestan & Druha Trava, was released in 1991. Druh\u00e1 Tr\u00e1va has been noted as the preeminent band in the Czech bluegrass scene, and critics have cited the band's unique mix of Americana and Central European influences. Druh\u00e1 Tr\u00e1va has toured internationally and has performed with Ricky Skaggs, Peter Rowan, Davy Spillane, and B\u00e9la Fleck. The band's international appearances attracted attention for their ability to master many different genres and eras of American roots music. Their 1999 album Czechmate was their first to be released in the United States, and gained attention from international critics for its covers of jazz standards, opera numbers, and Appalachian folk songs. Several of their later albums were released by Universal Music Group, and their most recent album Pojd'me se Nap\u00edt was released by EMI in 2013. == Discography == Robert K\u0159es\u0165an performing with the group in 2008.
