    "text": "The L\u00fd\u2013Song War was a significant war fought between the kingdom of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t under the house of L\u00fd and the Song dynasty of China between 1075 and 1077. The war began in 1075 when the Vietnamese king ordered a preemptive invasion of the Song dynasty using more than 80,000 soldiers, where \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's forces defeated the Song army and razed the city of Yongzhou (modern day Nanning) to the ground after a forty-two day siege. In response, in 1076 the Song led an army of over 300,000 to invade \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and by 1077 nearly reached Th\u0103ng Long, the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, before being halted by general L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t at the Nhu Nguy\u1ec7t River in modern B\u1eafc Ninh Province. After a long battle at the river with high casualties on both sides, L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t offered peace to the Song, and the Song commander Guo Kui agreed to withdraw his troops, ending the war. ==Background== Tension and border hostilities were already high in the years prior to the war; in the 1050s, N\u00f9ng Tr\u00ed Cao, the head of the local N\u00f9ng people in Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean (now Cao B\u1eb1ng Province) attempted to fight for independence and establish a frontier state for his people, but his rebellion was crushed by Song general Di Qing (1008\u20131061).Anderson (2008), 191. While the Vietnamese court did not intervene in the matter, the threat of Song expansion was always on the horizon due to increasing numbers of Han Chinese settlers, such as the soldiers from Di Qing's division and those north of the Yangzi River settled in areas that the Vietnamese relied upon for the extraction of natural resources.Anderson (2008), 198.Anderson (2008), 195\u2013198. In 1075, Wang Anshi, the chancellor of the Song dynasty, told Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067-1085) that \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was being destroyed by Champa, with less than ten thousand soldiers surviving, so hence it would be a good occasion to annex \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. The Song emperor then mobilized his troops and passed a decree to forbid all the provinces of Song to trade with \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, block \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's goods to Western Xia; this prompted the Vietnamese court under Emperor L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (r. 1072-1127) to authorize a preemptive invasion of Guangxi in the Song dynasty. L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng then sent general L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t and N\u00f9ng T\u00f4ng \u0110\u00e1n, a kinsman of the N\u00f9ng rebel N\u00f9ng Tr\u00ed Cao, to lead more than a hundred thousand soldiers to invade the Chinese province of Guangxi.Anderson (2008), 206-207. ==Conflict== ===Early stages=== Vietnamese forces invaded into modern day Nanning (Yongzhou) in Guangxi Province, highlighted in dark blue In the October 1075, N\u00f9ng T\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ea3n led 23,000 soldiers advanced into Song territory in Guangxi while a naval fleet commanded by L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t consisted 40,000 soldiers captured Qinzhou and Lianzhou prefectures.Anderson (2008), 207\u2013208. L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t calmed the apprehensions of the local Chinese populace, claiming that he was simply apprehending a rebel who took refuge in China and that the local Song authorities had refused to cooperate in detaining him.Anderson (2008), 208. News about the battlefield reached the Song Chinese court in early 1075. In the early spring of 1076, L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t and N\u00f9ng T\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ea3n defeated the Song reinforcements to Yongzhou, and during a battle at Kunlun Pass, their forces beheaded the Governor-General of Guangnan West Circuit, Zhang Shoujie (d. 1076). Afterwards, the Vietnamese forces then marched towards the city of Yongzhou, where they were temporarily held up by a fierce resistance led by the Yongzhou governor Su Jian, who with three thousand soldiers prevented the city from falling for forty-two days. Vietnamese engineers deployed and launched trebuchets and fire arrows into the city, inflicted heavy casualties for Song defenders and caused fires and water shortages for its inhabitants. After the forty-two-day siege, on March 1, 1076, Yongzhou was finally breached and then razed to the ground, as Vietnamese forces massacred 58,000 people within the city. Prior to the massacre, after the city was lost, governor Su Jian and thirty-six members of his family in the city committed suicide, with Su Jian stating \"I won't die at the hands of those thieves.\"History of Song, vol. 446 Several sources estimate that the total number of people killed by the Vietnamese troops during this campaign totaled 100,000. When Song forces attempted to challenge L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t's forces, the latter retreated, with their spoils of war and thousands of prisoners. ===Later stages=== Song forces reached Nhu Nguy\u1ec7t River in B\u1eafc Ninh Province (highlighted in red) near the capital of Th\u0103ng Long L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t had fought a war with the Chams in 1069, and in 1076, the Song called upon their vassal states the Khmer Empire and Champa to go to war again against \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. At the same time, the Song commander Guo Kui (1022\u20131088) led the combined Song force of approximately 300,000 men against \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, who were at the time simultaneously defending against incursions from the Khmer Empire and Champa. The Song quickly regained Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean prefecture and in the process captured the resistance leader L\u01b0u K\u00fd, the chieftain of Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean that had attacked Yongzhou in 1075. By 1077, the Song had destroyed two other Vietnamese armies and marched towards their capital at Th\u0103ng Long (modern Hanoi). Song forces were halted at the Nhu Nguy\u1ec7t River (in modern B\u1eafc Ninh Province), where L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t had built a defense system by placing spikes under the Nh\u01b0 Nguy\u1ec7t riverbed before tricking Song troops into the death trap, killing more than 1,000 Chinese soldiers and sailors. In avoiding this strong defense system, the commander of the Song army, Guo Kui decided to change the army's direction towards the nearby region of Ph\u00fa L\u01b0\u01a1ng, where they then defeated L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t's forces in a major battle. As the Song forces took the offensive, while the Vietnamese had to strenuously hold on to their costly defensive front, L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t tried to boost the morale of his soldiers by citing a poem before his army named \"Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\u00e0\". However, Song forces eventually broke through his defense line and their cavalry advanced to within several kilometers of the capital city.Anderson (2008), 209. The Vietnamese counterattacked and pushed Song forces back across the river while their coastal defenses distracted the Song navy. L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t also launched an offensive, but lost two Vietnamese princes in the fighting at Kh\u00e1o T\u00fac River. According to Chinese sources, \"tropical climate and rampant disease\" severely weakened Song's military forces while the Vietnamese court feared the result of a prolonged war so close to the capital. Chinese forces lost about 50%\u201360% before retreating, half of them died due diseases. ==Peace agreement== As a result of mounting casualties on both sides, Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t made peace overtures to the Song in 1077; the Song commander Guo Kui agreed to withdraw his troops since they had lost 400,000 men, but kept five disputed regions of Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean (renamed Shun'anzhou or Thu\u1eadn Ch\u00e2u), T\u01b0 Lang Ch\u00e2u, M\u00f4n Ch\u00e2u, T\u00f4 M\u1eadu Ch\u00e2u, and Qu\u1ea3ng L\u0103ng, while \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t held control of the Yong, Qin and Lian prefectures. These areas now comprise most of modern Vietnam's Cao B\u1eb1ng Province and L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Province. In 1082, after a long period of mutual isolation, King L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t returned Yong, Qin, and Lian prefectures back to Song authorities, along with their prisoners of war, and in return Song relinquished its control of four prefectures and the county of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, including the N\u00f9ng clan's home of Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean. Further negotiations took place from July 6 to August 8, 1084 and were held at Song's Yongping garrison in southern Guangnan, where \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's Director of Military Personnel L\u00ea V\u0103n Th\u1ecbnh (fl. 1038-1096) convinced Song to fix the two countries' borders between Qu\u1ea3ng Nguy\u00ean and Guihua prefectures.Anderson (2008), 210. ==Legacy== The war resulted in an agreement between both sides that fixed the two country's borders; the modern border is largely unmodified from the resulting line of demarcation.Anderson (2008), 191\u2013192. The view of the war remained very controversial in both countries. Song China considered the expedition a success. The expedition caused loss of land for the Vietnamese, as well as the death of their crown Prince in the hands of Guo Kui. Guo Kui was honored for his achievements in punishing Vietnam. In Vietnam, the view was different, as Guo Kui was banished for life over his failure, the war highlighted Vietnamese independence and considered as the marking point of Vietnam's militaristic successes, having stampeded to deep of modern days Guangxi and Guangdong in China. It remains the only time Vietnam managed to invade China in its history.http://baotanglichsu.vn/vi/Articles/3096/8270/ly-thuong-kiet-noi-kinh- hoang-cua-quan-tong.html ===In Vietnam === During the Vietnamese defense against the Song counteroffensive in which Song forces nearly breached into the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t capital of Th\u0103ng Long, general L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t wrote a famous poem named Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\u00e0 which he then recited in front of his army in order to boost the morale of his men before the battle of Nhu Nguy\u1ec7t River. The poem, dubbed retroactively as Vietnam's first Declaration of Independence asserted the sovereignty of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t rulers over its lands. The poem reads:James Anderson The Rebel Den of N\u00f9ng Tr\u00ed Cao: Loyalty and Identity 2007 p. 214 note 88 {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Original Chinese !! Sino-Vietnamese !!

The illustration on page 142, painted by Xiong Kong Cheng (\u718a\u5b54\u6210), describes the bravery of Su Jian, who, with only three thousand men was able to put up a fierce, forty-two day, resistance against Vietnamese forces before finally succumbing to vastly superior numbers. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== *Anderson, James A.
