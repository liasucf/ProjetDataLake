    "text": "Coventry Godcakes are baked puff pastry pasties containing sweet mincemeat, which originate from the city of Coventry, England. They are in the form of a right angled isosceles triangle, marked with three slits on the top and sprinkled with sugar. The triangular shape and the markings are said to be reference to the Holy Trinity. Godcakes are a New Year tradition in the city, and are given by godparents to their godchildren along with a blessing for the year ahead. In 2010, Leigh Waite, a local Blue Badge Tourist Guide with an interest in baking, was given a recipe by a local historian David McGrory. Leigh tried out the recipe, producing them to sell during the annual Heritage Open Weekend event in the city. In August 2012, the Coventry God Cake was officially re-launched at a celebration event at Coventry Transport Museum attended by the Lord Mayor and guests, including the Coventry Mummers. The term God cake is derived from the triangles created in country lanes where three lanes meet. A triangle is created by the passing of farm vehicles, originally horse drawn carts, as they turn. The so-called \"Coventry God cakes\" take their name from these triangle shapes which are not particular to any one county or city as they are found everywhere. ==See also== * List of pastries == References == Category:British cakes Category:British pastries Category:English cuisine ",
