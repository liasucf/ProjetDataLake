This is one of Uganda's critical oil roads because it facilitates oil exploration in the Albertine Graben, as well as tourism, due to its proximity to Kabalega National Park. ==Location== The road starts at Hoima, and continues northwest through Butiaba and Buliisa and ending in Wanseko, in the oil-rich Albertine Graben, a distance of approximately .

The coordinates of the road near Butiaba are:01\u00b047'28.0\"N, 31\u00b023'05.0\"E (Latitude:1.791111; Longitude:31.384722). ==Upgrading to bitumen== The government of Uganda has earmarked this road for upgrading through the conversion of the existing gravel road to bitumen surface and the building of bridges and drainage channels. Kolin Insaat, a construction firm from Turkey, was selected, with the approval of the cabinet of Uganda, to carry out the improvements at a projected cost of approximately US $140 million (UGX:454 billion).
