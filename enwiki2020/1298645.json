    "text": "Georges Izambard about 1890, photographer unknown Georges Alphonse Fleury Izambard (born 11 December 1848 in Paris- February 1931) was a French school teacher, best known as the teacher and benefactor of poet Arthur Rimbaud. He taught at the Coll\u00e8ge de Charleville in Charleville, where his nickname was \"Zanzibar\". 0n 4 May 1870, Rimbaud's mother wrote to Izambard to complain about him giving Rimbaud Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables to read. In May 1871, Rimbaud sent an important letter to Izambard. In this letter, (which includes the poem \"Le C\u0153ur supplici\u00e9\"), he affirms that he wants to be a poet, and that he is working to become a \"voyant\": :Je veux \u00eatre po\u00e8te, et je travaille \u00e0 me rendre voyant : vous ne comprendrez pas du tout, et je ne saurais presque vous expliquer. Il s'agit d'arriver \u00e0 l'inconnu par le d\u00e9r\u00e8glement de tous les sens. Les souffrances sont \u00e9normes, mais il faut \u00eatre fort, \u00eatre n\u00e9 po\u00e8te, et je me suis reconnu po\u00e8te. Ce n'est pas du tout ma faute. C'est faux de dire : Je pense : on devrait dire : On me pense. \u2212 Pardon du jeu de mots. \u2212 Je est un autre. Tant pis pour le bois qui se trouve violon, et nargue aux inconscients, qui ergotent sur ce qu'ils ignorent tout \u00e0 fait ! Translated: :I wish to be a poet, and I am working to make myself into a seer: you will not understand at all, and I would not nearly know how to explain it to you. It's a question of coming to the unknown through the disordering of all the senses. The suffering is enormous, but one must be strong, be born a poet, and I have come to terms with my destiny as a poet. It's not at all my fault. It's wrong to say \"I think\"; one ought to say \"I am being thought\" \\- Forgive the play on words - I is another. Too bad for the wood which finds itself a violin, and brush off the oblivious, who quibble over things they know nothing about! ==Published works== * ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * == External links == *Letter from Rimbaud to Izambard Category:1848 births Category:1931 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:French academics Category:Arthur Rimbaud ",
