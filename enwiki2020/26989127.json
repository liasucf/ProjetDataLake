The tank was based on the T-80's chassis, using a new turret, and was armed with a 152.4 mm rifled gun. The rifled variant of tank's armament was never finished. In September 1990 the tank was completed and in 1991 underwent trials. The trials showed high stability and reliability of the gun and the tank itself. However, the absence of funding discontinued further work on the tank's improvement. Main profit of this variant was fact that new turret was completely interchangeable with the standard T-80 main battle tank turret. Ammo rack consisted of only 16 152 mm rounds.\u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442 292 ==See also== * Object 785 * CATTB * Leopard 2-140 * Pz 87-140 * Object 195 * Type 99KM ==References== Category:Main battle tanks of the Soviet Union Category:Cold War tanks of the Soviet Union Category:Abandoned military projects of the Soviet Union Category:Main battle tanks of the Cold War Category:History of the tank Category:Trial and research tanks of the Soviet Union ",
