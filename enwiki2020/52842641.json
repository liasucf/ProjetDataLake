    "text": "SunCommon is a Vermont-based installer of residential solar power systems. It is headquartered in Waterbury, Vermont. The business was co-founded by Duane Peterson https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelldebevoise/2018/12/11/beyond-the-why- duane-peterson-on-how-suncommon-is-good-for-the-world/#21f9fff30c1d and James Moore. https://vermontbiz.com/news/2019/october/17/rev-it-honors-renewable- energy-leaders The company originated with advocacy group Vermont Public Interest Research Group (VPIRG), which in September 2010 started a program to install solar power and hot water systems for homeowners. To meet the demand for clean energy, a new entity was needed that could take in outside capital and scale up, so Duane and James launched SunCommon. SunCommon was officially launched in March 2012 after finding funding via private investment; when it began operations, it had 16 employees and annual revenue of about $2 million. SunCommon installed its 1,000th residential solar system in December 2014, and by late 2016 had reached 2,000 installations, with a workforce of about 100. Its 2015 revenue was about $22 million. In May of 2018, SunCommon expanded into New York after merging with Hudson Solar. https://vermontbiz.com/news/2018/may/22/suncommon-expands-new-york-hudson- solar-merger As of March 2020, SunCommon employed 189 people and added over 80 Megawatts of solar to the electric grids of Vermont and New York. This number includes over 8,000 residences and 37 Community Solar Arrays. https://www.facebook.com/suncommon/posts/2822133081174498 == Products == === Residential Solar === SunCommon installs both roof and ground mounted systems https://suncommon.com/home-solar-power/ in both Vermont and New York. As of March 2020, they have installed over 8,000 residential systems. https://www.facebook.com/suncommon/posts/2822133081174498 === Solar Canopy === The Solar Canopy is a unique stand-alone structure with bifacial solar panels. https://suncommon.com/solar-canopy/ The Solar Canopy comes in single, double, and triple bay sizes and is now offered in both Vermont and New York.

SunCommon has installed many Community Solar Arrays (CSAs) throughout Vermont and New York. Some of their most notable CSAs are in New York. ==== Orange County Citizens Foundation Community Solar Array ==== The CSA at the Orange County Citizens Foundation (OCCF) in Sugar Loaf, NY hosts solar panels on the foundation's land, capable of powering over 60 area homes and businesses. SunCommon announced a grant to local artists https://occitizensfoundation.org/initiatives/suncommon-grant/ for an outdoor installation near the CSA at the 55-acre Seligmann Center at OCCF. The winners of the grant were Maxine Leu and Michael Asbill. https://suncommon.com/occf-art-installation/ The sculptures double as a shelter and a food source for local wildlife. One of the installations is planted with blackberries and grapes, and the other element is essentially a giant bird feeder. https://suncommon.com/occf-art-installation/ ==== The Pointe of Praise Family Life Center Community Solar Array ==== This CSA in Kingston, NY was built in two phases and has the capacity to serve about 60 households. \"The Pointe of Praise church has received panels in exchange for the use of their land to host the array... They are donating 75 percent of their panels to low- and moderate-income seniors in the congregation. Pollinator-friendly vegetation will be planted around the array.\" https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/03/26/community-solar-projects-getting-up- and-running/ ==== Red Hook Community Solar Array ==== In January 2020, SunCommon hosted a ribbon cutting event for their CSA in Red Hook, NY. \"The project will power municipal buildings in Tivoli, Red Hook, and local homes. Red Hook officials say this will save the community thousands each year, providing electric bill credits to 270 homes and 16 municipal electric accounts.\" https://www.news10.com/news/red-hook-celebrates-community-solar- array-project/ ==== Columbia County's First Community Solar Array ==== In December 2017, \"the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and Hudson Solar (now SunCommon) announced the completion of the first community solar project in Columbia County. This 214 kilowatt CSA is located on one acre... and can accommodate up to 40 customers.
