It was published by Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, with a foreword by the eminent Bengali Scholar Suniti Kumar Chatterjee. However, the work is presently out of print, with the only copy available at the National Library in Kolkata. The second translation was by E. C. Sastri in 1974, and the third translation appeared in 1993 by N. Ramanuja Das. The second and third translations too were made in prose. There appears to be another translation by T. N. Senapathy, the details of which are not known. The first verse translation was made by S. Krishnamoorthy, who has also translated Cilappadikaaram into English published by M. P. Birla Foundation, Kolkata. ==Published translations== * ==See also== * Tirukkural translations * List of Tirukkural translations by language == Notes == Bengali Category:Translations into Bengali ",
