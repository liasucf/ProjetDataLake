    "text": "The European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance (EC/DA) is a conservative group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. It was founded as the Group of Independent Representatives in 1970 by British and Scandinavian members of PACE. It has 76 members from countries including the UK, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Italy. It was known as the European Democrats Group until its renaming in 2014, and the European Conservatives Group until 2019. It is affiliated to the European Conservatives and Reformists Party and Identity and Democracy Party. While it was only the third group to be founded in PACE (after the Socialist Group and the Christian Democrat Group), it was the first to have an official secretariat, which was established in 1977. On 6 July 1978, a proposal to rename the group was submitted, leading to the new name in September 1980. For many years Vladimir Putin's United Russia party were members of the European Democrat Group. ==Membership== ===2020=== As of March 2020, the European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance has the following members: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! rowspan=2| Country ! rowspan=2| Party name ! rowspan=2| Members ! colspan=3| Other affiliations |- !
