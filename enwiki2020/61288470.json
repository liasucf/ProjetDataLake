In mid-1987, S\u00e3o Paulo Metro hired a study for the expansion of East-West Line from Itaquera to Guaianazes. Besides the studies didn't recommend the extension of the line, because of risk of collapse caused by overcrowding, Qu\u00e9rcia administration started the construction of the branch (called East Extension) on November 1987. The construction included P\u00eassego, Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio and Guaianazes stations and were made by constructor Andrade Gutierrez. Shortly after, the construction were put on hold by Metro for lack of BNDES financing, which claimed for Metro debt in the paying of other financings. The work of East Extension continued in a slow way, though the conclusion was scheduled to 1991, and with constant paralyzations until being totally put on hold in 1992 during Fleury administration. Meanwhile, Metro hired architects Jo\u00e3o and Odil\u00e9a Toscano do project the new station. Named P\u00eassego, because of the proximity with the homonymous brook, the station project predicted the massive use of steel and glass. The structure, of 2 levels connected by stairs and elevators, formed a cross where north and south branches were formed by accesses, linear bus terminal, mezzanine and ticket offices and the east and west branched is where the platforms were located. The project of P\u00eassego station received the Great Prize in 4th Architecture International Biennual, in 1999. In 1995, during Covas administration, S\u00e3o Paulo Government renegotiated the construction contracts. P\u00eassego station construction was resumed by constructor Constran, with the work supervision transferred from the Metro to the CPTM. On 25 May 2000, the station, renamed to Dom Bosco, was opened and integrated to the CPTM network. ==Toponymy== Toponymic studies coordinated by Metro in the end of 1980s concluded that the new station show be named P\u00eassego, for crossing the old Peach Road. Until 1998, the name P\u00eassego was used to call the station. In 1998, State Deputies Walter Feldman (PSDB), Roberto Gouveia (PT), Ricardo Tripoli (PSDB) and Vitor Sapienza (PMDB) elaborated projects and indication to rename P\u00eassego station to Dom Bosco, with the reason to pay tribute to Dom Bosco Social Work, and get votes from the local catholic community.
