She married late in life to Joseph Pearson, who had been a friend and taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. ==Personal life== Monhegan Island Harbor Looking Toward Manana, 1910, The Monhegan Museum, Maine Alice Kent Stoddard was born in Watertown, Connecticut in 1883.

She painted her mother and sister in Mother and Virginia in Sitting Room about 1934. Woodmere Art Museum states, \"Here she masterfully conveys the intimacy of family life... Virginia pauses while knitting, seemingly lost in thought. Across the room, Stoddard's mother focuses on a game of solitaire. The large, rectangular space between the two women emphasizes the psychological distance between them in their respective moments of quiet contemplation. Stoddard visited and lived in Monhegan, Maine, and integrated the people and scenery in her paintings.\" She painted Manville Davis, a fisherman in Mending the Nets and a portrait of artist Andrew Winter. The area became an enclave for artists, some of the other artists who painted and visited there were Robert Henri, the Wyeth family (N. C., Andrew, and Jamie), and Charles Ebert. During World War II she worked as a mechanical draftsperson for airplane design for Budd Company and as a combat artist. Her work was exhibited at Woodmere Art Museum, where she also volunteered her time. Stoddard painted a mural in one of the courtrooms of the Family Court Building in Philadelphia. The mural featured a couple planting a tree and a family scene, within a construction area. It was one of 37 murals made in the building to depict the societal usefulness of the jurisprudence system. She won a \"Small Oils Painting\" medal at a Philadelphia Sketch Club. ==Collections== * Alderney Library, Channel Islands ** Beatrice Fox Griffith of Haverford, West Pennsylvania, 1949 * Dallas Museum of Art ** Fisherman's Little Sister, 1915 * Ewell Sale Stewart Library, Academy of National Sciences, Philadelphia ** Charles M.
