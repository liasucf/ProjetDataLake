In the shot put he reportedly had the longest efforts (albeit in the absence of defending champion Ralph Rose), but was disqualified for throwing the shot. In the javelin he finished fifth behind four Swedes, less than a meter behind silver medalist Knut Lindberg. In the discus he finished third, with defending champion Martin Sheridan taking the top spot. Finally, on 1 May, J\u00e4rvinen won the gold medal in the Greek-style discus competition. === Olympic Games === At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, Great Britain, J\u00e4rvinen finished third in the Greek-style discus and fourth in the regular discus. Both competitions were won by Sheridan. J\u00e4rvinen also competed in the shot and the javelin, but without any notable success.

At age 42, he finished 15th in the regular discus and 12th in the both hands competition. === National === He won nine medals at the Finnish Championships in Athletics: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center;\" |+ Verner J\u00e4rvinen at the Finnish Championships in Athletics |- !Year !Event !Rank !Result !References |- |rowspan=3| 1909 | Two handed shot put | 6th | 20.77 | |- | Two handed discus throw |style=background-color:#cc9966| 3rd | 72.60 | |- | Greek discus throw |style=background-color:gold| 1st | 37.12 | |- |rowspan=3| 1910 | Two handed discus throw |style=background-color:#cc9966| 3rd | 71.17 (31.80 + 39.37) | |- | Greek discus throw |style=background- color:gold| 1st | 37.43 | |- | Hammer throw |style=background-color:#cc9966| 3rd | 28.48 | |- |rowspan=3| 1911 | Two handed discus throw |style=background-color:#cc9966| 3rd | 68.62 (30.41 + 38.21) | |- | Greek discus throw |style=background-color:gold| 1st | 38.03 | |- | Hammer throw |style=background-color:silver| 2nd | 30.97 | |- |rowspan=2| 1912 | Two handed discus throw | 5th | 60.36 (27.33 + 33.03) | |- | Greek discus throw |style=background-color:silver| 2nd |colspan=2| 31.84 or 31.57 |} In discus throw, he is credited with the following Finnish records: * 44.00 metres, in 1901 * 44.30 metres, in Saint Petersburg, on 12 August 1906.
