Brazelton's name does not appear on either the 1860 and 1870 US Census records. Historian Erik J. Wright has published widely on the life and crimes of William Brazelton, yet has concluded that his life remains shrouded in mystery. Wright's last study on the outlaw pinpointed the site of his death at the southeast corner of what is now Mission and Ajo in Tucson, Arizona.[Journal of the West, Vol. 56, no. 1] ==Coming to Arizona== About 1876 Brazelton came to the courthouse in Prescott, Arizona and claimed that in a show he would eat a wagon wheel. After collecting money he left by explaining he would rustle up the rest of the troupe; of course he never returned.
