    "text": "Gabriele Ambrosetti (born 7 August 1973) is an Italian football manager and former player, who played as a winger. ==Playing career== Born in Varese, Ambrosetti made his professional debut with his hometown club, and later played for several Italian sides, including Brescia, Venezia, and Vicenza. He won the 1996\u201397 Coppa Italia at Vicenza, defeating Napoli 3\u20131 on aggregate in the final, and in April 1998 played in a Cup Winners Cup semi-final against Chelsea, where his performances inspired the English Premier League club to sign him for \u00a33.5 million in August 1999. He arrived as, according to his manager, Gianluca Vialli, the 'Italian Ryan Giggs', but struggled to live up to the tag and in four years made only a handful of appearances. He made his Chelsea debut as a substitute on 21 August in a 1\u20130 home win against Aston Villa, replacing compatriot Gianfranco Zola for the last three minutes. The only goal he scored for Chelsea was in a 5\u20130 win against Galatasaray in Istanbul, on 20 October 1999 during the UEFA Champions League Group Stage. Ambrosetti also contributed one appearance to Chelsea's victorious 1999\u20132000 FA Cup campaign. He spent his final seasons with Piacenza and Pro Patria, before retiring. ==Style of play== Capapble of playing both as a forward and as a midfielder, Ambrosetti was a quick and technically gifted winger, who was known for his pace, ability to get past players, and his powerful and accurate shot from distance. ==Coaching career== In January 2016 Ambrosetti joined the coaching staff of Swansea City under their newly appointed manager Francesco Guidolin, who had previously coached Ambrosetti at Vicenza. When Guidolin was sacked, Ambrosetti also left the club. ==Honours== ;Brescia *Anglo-Italian Cup: 1993\u201394 ;Vicenza *Coppa Italia: 1996\u201397 ;Chelsea *FA Cup: 1999\u20132000 *FA Community Shield: 2000 ==References== Category:Brescia Calcio players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Italian expatriate footballers Category:Italian footballers Category:Living people Category:Premier League players Category:Serie A players Category:Serie B players Category:Serie C players Category:L.R.
