    "text": "Masters of Evolution is a 1959 science fiction novel by American writer Damon Knight. It first appeared in 1954 in Galaxy Science Fiction as the novella \"Natural State\". Knight subsequently expanded the text by about 5000 words, and the longer version was published by Ace Books in 1959 as Masters of Evolution, in a dos-a-dos paperback that included George O. Smith's Fire in the Heavens (Ace Double D-375). ==Synopsis== In the near future, the world is divided into two antagonistic groups: city dwellers and country dwellers, called \"muckfeet\". The muckfeet control most of the land area and have a much higher population. The mayor of New York convinces a popular actor, Alvah Gustad, to negotiate an agreement with the muckfeet: technology in exchange for their scarce metals. Alvah reluctantly agrees and is given a chance to present his wares at a fair in the Midwest. No one is interested; an altercation ensues and Alvah realizes that he is stranded. He is taken in by a pretty young woman named B. J.; gradually he comes to accept and understand the muckfeet way of life, which includes novel uses of genetic engineering in place of machines. Alvah falls in love with B. J. and when the cities launch an attack on the muckfeet, Alvah is forced to reexamine his beliefs about the superiority of the city way of life. ==Reception== The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction considered that when \"Natural State\" was \"expanded from (its original novella form)\", it lost its \"compressed drivenness\".Knight, Damon , by Malcolm Edwards, John Clute and David Langford; updated April 4, 2017; retrieved February 1, 2018 Kirkus Reviews was far harsher, calling it a \"mediocre, tired comic's vision of city folk and country types in collision\".Three Novels, reviewed at Kirkus Reviews, originally published January 6, 1966; retrieved February 1, 2018 ==Origins== Mike Ashley has noted that the story was shaped by editor Horace Gold, and that Knight \"accepted that the end result was better than his original\", but was disappointed that the original \"had been still-born\".Transformations: The Story of the Science-fiction Magazines from 1950 to 1970, by Mike Ashley; published 2005 by Liverpool University Press ==References== == External links == * * Knight's novella \"Natural State\" was originally published in the January 1954 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction Category:1959 American novels Category:Novels by Damon Knight Category:American science fiction novels Category:1959 science fiction novels Category:Works originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction Category:Ace Books books ",
