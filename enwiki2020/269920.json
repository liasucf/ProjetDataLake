    "text": "Xeon ( ) is a brand of x86 microprocessors designed, manufactured, and marketed by Intel, targeted at the non-consumer workstation, server, and embedded system markets. It was introduced in June 1998. Xeon processors are based on the same architecture as regular desktop-grade CPUs, but have advanced features such as support for ECC memory, higher core counts, support for larger amounts of RAM, larger cache memory and extra provision for enterprise-grade reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) features responsible for handling hardware exceptions through the Machine Check Architecture. They are often capable of safely continuing execution where a normal processor cannot due to these extra RAS features, depending on the type and severity of the machine-check exception (MCE). Some also support multi- socket systems with two, four, or eight sockets through use of the Quick Path Interconnect (QPI) bus. Some shortcomings that make Xeon processors unsuitable for most consumer-grade desktop PCs include lower clock rates at the same price point (since servers run more tasks in parallel than desktops, core counts are more important than clock rates), usually an absence of an integrated graphics processing unit (GPU), and lack of support for overclocking. Despite such disadvantages, Xeon processors have always had popularity among some desktop users (video editors and other power users), mainly due to higher core count potential, and higher performance to price ratio vs. the Core i7 in terms of total computing power of all cores. Since most Intel Xeon CPUs lack an integrated GPU, systems built with those processors require a discrete graphics card or a separate GPU if computer monitor output is desired. Intel Xeon is a distinct product line from the similarly-named Intel Xeon Phi. The first-generation Xeon Phi is a completely different type of device more comparable to a graphics card; it is designed for a PCI Express slot and is meant to be used as a multi-core coprocessor, like the Nvidia Tesla. In the second generation, Xeon Phi evolved into a main processor more similar to the Xeon. It conforms to the same socket as a Xeon processor and is x86-compatible; however, as compared to Xeon, the design point of the Xeon Phi emphasizes more cores with higher memory bandwidth. ==Overview== The Xeon brand has been maintained over several generations of IA-32 and x86-64 processors. Older models added the Xeon moniker to the end of the name of their corresponding desktop processor, but more recent models used the name Xeon on its own. The Xeon CPUs generally have more cache than their desktop counterparts in addition to multiprocessing capabilities. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:0; font-size:95%;\" |+ Intel Xeon processor family: Server |- ! width=\"10px!\" style=\"background-color: #FFF;

The first Xeon-branded processor was the Pentium II Xeon (code-named \"Drake\"). It was released in 1998, replacing the Pentium Pro in Intel's server lineup. The Pentium II Xeon was a \"Deschutes\" Pentium II (and shared the same product code: 80523) with a full-speed 512 kB (1 kB = 1024 B = 1024 B), 1 MB (1 MB = 1024 kB = 10242 B), or 2 MB L2 cache. The L2 cache was implemented with custom 512 kB SRAMs developed by Intel. The number of SRAMs depended on the amount of cache. A 512 kB configuration required one SRAM, a 1 MB configuration: two SRAMs, and a 2 MB configuration: four SRAMs on both sides of the PCB. Each SRAM was a 12.90 mm by 17.23 mm (222.21 mm\u00b2) die fabricated in a 0.35 \u00b5m four- layer metal CMOS process and packaged in a cavity-down wire-bonded land grid array (LGA). The additional cache required a larger module and thus the Pentium II Xeon used a larger slot, Slot 2. It was supported by the 440GX dual-processor workstation chipset and the 450NX quad- or octo-processor chipset. ===Pentium III Xeon=== In 1999, the Pentium II Xeon was replaced by the Pentium III Xeon. Reflecting the incremental changes from the Pentium II \"Deschutes\" core to the Pentium III \"Katmai\" core, the first Pentium III Xeon, named \"Tanner\", was just like its predecessor except for the addition of Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and a few cache controller improvements. The product codes for Tanner mirrored that of Katmai; 80525. The second version, named \"Cascades\", was based on the Pentium III \"Coppermine\" core. The \"Cascades\" Xeon used a 133 MHz bus and relatively small 256 kB on-die L2 cache resulting in almost the same capabilities as the Slot 1 Coppermine processors, which were capable of dual-processor operation but not quad-processor operation. To improve this situation, Intel released another version, officially also named \"Cascades\", but often referred to as \"Cascades 2 MB\". That came in two variants: with 1 MB or 2 MB of L2 cache. Its bus speed was fixed at 100 MHz, though in practice the cache was able to offset this. The product code for Cascades mirrored that of Coppermine; 80526. ==Netburst-based Xeon== ===Xeon (DP) & Xeon MP (32-bit)=== ====Foster==== In mid-2001, the Xeon brand was introduced (\"Pentium\" was dropped from the name). The initial variant that used the new NetBurst microarchitecture, \"Foster\", was slightly different from the desktop Pentium 4 (\"Willamette\"). It was a decent chip for workstations, but for server applications it was almost always outperformed by the older Cascades cores with a 2 MB L2 cache and AMD's Athlon MP. Combined with the need to use expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM, the Foster's sales were somewhat unimpressive. At most two Foster processors could be accommodated in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system built with a mainstream chipset, so a second version (Foster MP) was introduced with a 1 MB L3 cache and the Jackson Hyper-Threading capacity. This improved performance slightly, but not enough to lift it out of third place. It was also priced much higher than the dual- processor (DP) versions. The Foster shared the 80528 product code with Willamette. ====Prestonia==== In 2002 Intel released a 130 nm version of Xeon branded CPU, codenamed \"Prestonia\". It supported Intel's new Hyper-Threading technology and had a 512 kB L2 cache. This was based on the \"Northwood\" Pentium 4 core. A new server chipset, E7500 (which allowed the use of dual- channel DDR SDRAM), was released to support this processor in servers, and soon the bus speed was boosted to 533 MT/s (accompanied by new chipsets: the E7501 for servers and the E7505 for workstations). The Prestonia performed much better than its predecessor and noticeably better than Athlon MP. The support of new features in the E75xx series also gave it a key advantage over the Pentium III Xeon and Athlon MP branded CPUs (both stuck with rather old chipsets), and it quickly became the top-selling server/workstation processor. === \"Gallatin\"=== Subsequent to the Prestonia was the \"Gallatin\", which had an L3 cache of 1 MB or 2 MB. Its Xeon MP version also performed much better than the Foster MP, and was popular in servers. Later experience with the 130 nm process allowed Intel to create the Xeon MP branded Gallatin with 4 MB cache. The Xeon branded Prestonia and Gallatin were designated 80532, like Northwood. ===Xeon (DP) & Xeon MP (64-bit)=== ====Nocona and Irwindale==== Due to a lack of success with Intel's Itanium and Itanium 2 processors, AMD was able to introduce x86-64, a 64-bit extension to the x86 architecture. Intel followed suit by including Intel 64 (formerly EM64T; it is almost identical to AMD64) in the 90 nm version of the Pentium 4 (\"Prescott\"), and a Xeon version codenamed \"Nocona\" with 1 MB L2 cache was released in 2004. Released with it were the E7525 (workstation), E7520 and E7320 (both server) chipsets, which added support for PCI Express, DDR-II and Serial ATA. The Xeon was noticeably slower than AMD's Opteron, although it could be faster in situations where Hyper-Threading came into play. A slightly updated core called \"Irwindale\" was released in early 2005, with 2 MB L2 cache and the ability to have its clock speed reduced during low processor demand. Although it was a bit more competitive than the Nocona had been, independent tests showed that AMD's Opteron still outperformed Irwindale. Both of these Prescott-derived Xeons have the product code 80546. ====Cranford and Potomac==== 64-bit Xeon MPs were introduced in April 2005. The cheaper \"Cranford\" was an MP version of Nocona, while the more expensive \"Potomac\" was a Cranford with 8 MB of L3 cache. Like Nocona and Irwindale, they also have product code 80546. ===Dual-Core Xeon=== ====\"Paxville DP\"==== The first dual-core CPU branded Xeon, codenamed Paxville DP, product code 80551, was released by Intel on October 10, 2005. Paxville DP had NetBurst microarchitecture, and was a dual-core equivalent of the single- core Irwindale (related to the Pentium D branded \"Smithfield\") with 4 MB of L2 Cache (2 MB per core). The only Paxville DP model released ran at 2.8 GHz, featured an 800 MT/s front side bus, and was produced using a 90 nm process. ====7000-series \"Paxville MP\"==== An MP-capable version of Paxville DP, codenamed Paxville MP, product code 80560, was released on November 1, 2005. There are two versions: one with 2 MB of L2 Cache (1 MB per core), and one with 4 MB of L2 (2 MB per core). Paxville MP, called the dual-core Xeon 7000-series, was produced using a 90 nm process. Paxville MP clock ranges between 2.67 GHz and 3.0 GHz (model numbers 7020\u20137041), with some models having a 667 MT/s FSB, and others having an 800 MT/s FSB. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Model ! scope=\"col\" | Clock Frequency ! scope=\"col\" | L2 Cache ! scope=\"col\" | FSB ! scope=\"col\" | TDP |- | 7020 | 2.66 GHz | 2 \u00d7 1 MB | 667 MHz | 165 W |- | 7030 | 2.80 GHz | 2 \u00d7 1 MB | 800 MHz | 165 W |- | 7040 | 3.00 GHz | 2 \u00d7 2 MB | 667 MHz | 165 W |- | 7041 | 3.00 GHz | 2 \u00d7 2 MB | 800 MHz | 165 W |} ====7100-series \"Tulsa\"==== Released on August 29, 2006, the 7100 series, codenamed Tulsa (product code 80550), is an improved version of Paxville MP, built on a 65 nm process, with 2 MB of L2 cache (1 MB per core) and up to 16 MB of L3 cache. It uses Socket 604. Tulsa was released in two lines: the N-line uses a 667 MT/s FSB, and the M-line uses an 800 MT/s FSB. The N-line ranges from 2.5 GHz to 3.5 GHz (model numbers 7110N-7150N), and the M-line ranges from 2.6 GHz to 3.4 GHz (model numbers 7110M-7140M). L3 cache ranges from 4 MB to 16 MB across the models. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Model ! scope=\"col\" | Speed ! scope=\"col\" | L2 Cache ! scope=\"col\" | L3 Cache ! scope=\"col\" | FSB ! scope=\"col\" | TDP |- | 7110N | 2.50 GHz | 2 MB | 4 MB | 667 MHz | 95 W |- | 7110M | 2.60 GHz | 2 MB | 4 MB | 800 MHz | 95 W |- | 7120N | 3.00 GHz | 2 MB | 4 MB | 667 MHz | 95 W |- | 7120M | 3.00 GHz | 2 MB | 4 MB | 800 MHz | 95 W |- | 7130N | 3.16 GHz | 2 MB | 8 MB | 667 MHz | 150 W |- | 7130M | 3.20 GHz | 2 MB | 8 MB | 800 MHz | 150 W |- | 7140N | 3.33 GHz | 2 MB | 16 MB | 667 MHz | 150 W |- | 7140M | 3.40 GHz | 2 MB | 16 MB | 800 MHz | 150 W |- | 7150N | 3.50 GHz | 2 MB | 16 MB | 667 MHz | 150 W |} ====5000-series \"Dempsey\"==== On May 23, 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5000 series) codenamed Dempsey (product code 80555). Released as the Dual-Core Xeon 5000-series, Dempsey is a NetBurst microarchitecture processor produced using a 65 nm process, and is virtually identical to Intel's \"Presler\" Pentium Extreme Edition, except for the addition of SMP support, which lets Dempsey operate in dual-processor systems. Dempsey ranges between 2.50 GHz and 3.73 GHz (model numbers 5020\u20135080). Some models have a 667 MT/s FSB, and others have a 1066 MT/s FSB. Dempsey has 4 MB of L2 Cache (2 MB per core). A Medium Voltage model, at 3.2 GHz and 1066 MT/s FSB (model number 5063), has also been released. Dempsey also introduces a new interface for Xeon processors: LGA 771, also known as Socket J. Dempsey was the first Xeon core in a long time to be somewhat competitive with its Opteron-based counterparts, although it could not claim a decisive lead in any performance metric \u2013 that would have to wait for its successor, the Woodcrest. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Model ! scope=\"col\" | Speed (GHz) ! scope=\"col\" | L2 Cache (MB) ! scope=\"col\" | FSB (MHz) ! scope=\"col\" | TDP (W) |- | 5020 | 2.50 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 667 | 95 |- | 5030 | 2.66 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 667 | 95 |- | 5040 | 2.83 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 667 | 95 |- | 5050 | 3.00 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 667 | 95 |- | 5060 | 3.20 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 1066 | 130 |- | 5063 | 3.20 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 1066 | 95 |- | 5070 | 3.46 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 1066 | 130 |- | 5080 | 3.73 | 2 \u00d7 2 | 1066 | 130 |} ==Pentium M (Yonah) based Xeon== ===LV (ULV), \"Sossaman\"=== On March 14, 2006, Intel released a dual-core processor codenamed Sossaman and branded as Xeon LV (low-voltage). Subsequently, an ULV (ultra-low-voltage) version was released. The Sossaman was a low-/ultra-low- power and double-processor capable CPU (like AMD Quad FX), based on the \"Yonah\" processor, for ultradense non-consumer environment (i.e., targeted at the blade-server and embedded markets), and was rated at a thermal design power (TDP) of 31 W (LV: 1.66 GHz, 2 GHz and 2.16 GHz) and 15 W (ULV: 1.66 GHz). As such, it supported most of the same features as earlier Xeons: Virtualization Technology, 667 MT/s front side bus, and dual-core processing, but did not support 64-bit operations, so it could not run 64-bit server software, such as Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, and therefore was limited to 16 GB of memory. A planned successor, codenamed \"Merom MP\" was to be a drop-in upgrade to enable Sossaman-based servers to upgrade to 64-bit capability. However, this was abandoned in favour of low-voltage versions of the Woodcrest LV processor leaving the Sossaman at a dead-end with no upgrade path. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Model ! scope=\"col\" | Speed (GHz) ! scope=\"col\" | L2 Cache (MB) ! scope=\"col\" | FSB (MHz) ! scope=\"col\" | TDP (W) |- | ULV 1.66 | 1.66 | 2 | 667 | 15 |- | LV 1.66 | 1.66 | 2 | 667 | 31 |- | LV 2.00 | 2.00 | 2 | 667 | 31 |- | LV 2.16 | 2.16 | 2 | 667 | 31 |} ==Core-based Xeon== ===Dual-Core === ====3000-series \"Conroe\"==== The 3000 series, codenamed Conroe (product code 80557) dual-core Xeon (branded) CPU,Intel Adds Low End Xeons to Roadmap, DailyTech released at the end of September 2006, was the first Xeon for single-CPU operation. The same processor is branded as Core 2 Duo or as Pentium Dual-Core and Celeron, with varying features disabled. They use LGA 775 (Socket T), operate on a 1066 MHz front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support Hyper-Threading.

It is a server and workstation version of the Intel Core 2 processor. Intel claims that it provides an 80% boost in performance, while reducing power consumption by 20% relative to the Pentium D. Most models have a 1333 MT/s FSB, except for the 5110 and 5120, which have a 1066 MT/s FSB. The fastest processor (5160) operates at 3.0 GHz.

The 36xx-series follows the 35xx-series Bloomfield uni-processor model while the 56xx-series follows the 55xx-series Gainestown dual-processor model and both are socket compatible to their predecessors. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Model ! scope=\"col\" | Speed (GHz) ! scope=\"col\" | L3 Cache (MB) ! scope=\"col\" | QPI speed (GT/s) ! scope=\"col\" | DDR3 Clock (MHz) ! scope=\"col\" | TDP (W) ! scope=\"col\" | Cores ! scope=\"col\" | Threads ! scope=\"col\" | Turbo-Boost |- | W3670 || 3.20 || 12 || 4.8 || 1066 || 130 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | W3680 || 3.33 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 130 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | W3690 || 3.46 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 130 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | E5603 || 1.60 || 4 || 4.8 || 800 || 80 || 4 || 4 || N |- | E5606 || 2.13 || 8 || 4.8 || 1066 || 80 || 4 || 4 || N |- | E5607 || 2.26 || 8 || 4.8 || 1066 || 80 || 4 || 4 || N |- | L5609 || 1.86 || 12 || 4.8 || 1066 || 40 || 4 || 4 || N |- | L5618 || 1.86 || 12 || 5.86 || 1066 || 40 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | E5620 || 2.40 || 12 || 5.86 || 1066 || 80 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | L5630 || 2.13 || 12 || 5.86 || 1066 || 40 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | E5630 || 2.53 || 12 || 5.86 || 1066 || 80 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | L5638 || 2.00 || 12 || 5.86 || 1333 || 60 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | L5639 || 2.13 || 12 || 5.86 || 1333 || 60 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | L5640 || 2.26 || 12 || 5.86 || 1333 || 60 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | E5640 || 2.66 || 12 || 5.86 || 1066 || 80 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | L5645 || 2.40 || 12 || 5.86 || 1333 || 60 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | E5645 || 2.40 || 12 || 5.86 || 1333 || 80 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | E5649 || 2.53 || 12 || 5.86 || 1333 || 80 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5650 || 2.66 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 95 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5660 || 2.80 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 95 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5667 || 3.06 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 95 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | X5670 || 2.93 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 95 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5672 || 3.20 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 95 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | X5675 || 3.06 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 95 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5677 || 3.46 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 130 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | X5679 || 3.20|| 12 || 6.4 || 1066 || 115 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5680 || 3.33 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 130 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5687 || 3.60 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 130 || 4 || 8 || Y |- | X5690 || 3.46 || 12 || 6.4 || 1333 || 130 || 6 || 12 || Y |- | X5698 || 4.40 || 12 || 6.4 || 1066 || 130 || 2 || 4 || Y |} ===6500/7500-series \"Beckton\"=== Beckton or Nehalem-EX (EXpandable server market) is a Nehalem-based processor with up to eight cores and uses buffering inside the chipset to support up to 16 standard DDR3 DIMMS per CPU socket without requiring the use of FB-DIMMS. Unlike all previous Xeon MP processors, Nehalem-EX uses the new LGA 1567 package, replacing the Socket 604 used in the previous models, up to Xeon 7400 \"Dunnington\". The 75xx models have four QuickPath interfaces, so it can be used in up-to eight-socket configurations, while the 65xx models are only for up to two sockets. Designed by the Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) Santa Clara and Hudson Design Teams, Beckton is manufactured on the P1266 (45 nm) technology. Its launch in March 2010 coincided with that of its direct competitor, AMD's Opteron 6xxx \"Magny-Cours\".Intel's next bunch of fun CPUs moves to 2010 Most models limit the number of cores and QPI links as well as the L3 Cache size in order to get a broader range of products out of the single chip design. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Model ! scope=\"col\" | Speed ! scope=\"col\" | L3 Cache ! scope=\"col\" | QPI speed ! scope=\"col\" | DDR3 Clock ! scope=\"col\" | TDP ! scope=\"col\" | Cores ! scope=\"col\" | Threads ! scope=\"col\" | Turbo-Boost |- | E6510 || 1.73 GHz || 12 MB || 2\u00d74.8 GT/s || 800 MHz || 105 W || 4 || 8 || |- | E6540 || 2.00 GHz || 18 MB || 2\u00d76.4 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 105 W || 6 || 12 || |- | X6550 || 2.00 GHz || 18 MB || 2\u00d76.4 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 130 W || 8 || 16 || |- | E7520 || 1.86 GHz || 18 MB || 3\u00d74.8 GT/s || 800 MHz || 95 W || 4 || 8 || |- | E7530 || 1.86 GHz || 12 MB || 3\u00d75.8 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 105 W || 6 || 12 || |- | E7540 || 2.00 GHz || 18 MB || 4\u00d76.4 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 105 W || 6 || 12 || |- | X7542 || 2.66 GHz || 18 MB || 4\u00d75.8 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 130 W || 6 || 6 || 0/1/1/1 |- | L7545 || 1.86 GHz || 18 MB || 4\u00d75.8 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 95 W || 6 || 12 || 0/1/3/5 |- | X7550 || 2.00 GHz || 18 MB || 4\u00d76.4 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 130 W || 8 || 16 || |- | L7555 || 1.86 GHz || 24 MB || 4\u00d75.8 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 95 W || 8 || 16 || 1/2/4/5 |- | X7560 || 2.26 GHz || 24 MB || 4\u00d76.4 GT/s || 1066 MHz || 130 W || 8 || 16 || |} ===E7-x8xx-series \"Westmere-EX\"=== Westmere-EX is the follow-on to Beckton/Nehalem-EX and the first Intel Chip to have ten CPU cores. The microarchitecture is the same as in the six-core Gulftown/Westmere-EP processor, but it uses the LGA 1567 package like Beckton to support up to eight sockets. Starting with Westmere-EX, the naming scheme has changed once again, with \"E7-xxxx\" now signifying the high-end line of Xeon processors using a package that supports larger than two-CPU configurations, formerly the 7xxx series. Similarly, the 3xxx uniprocessor and 5xxx dual-processor series turned into E3-xxxx and E5-xxxx, respectively, for later processors. == Sandy Bridge\u2013 and Ivy Bridge\u2013based Xeon == === E3-12xx- series \"Sandy Bridge\" === The Xeon E3-12xx line of processors, introduced in April 2011, uses the Sandy Bridge chips that are also the base for the Core i3/i5/i7-2xxx and Celeron/Pentium Gxxx products using the same LGA 1155 socket, but with a different set of features disabled. Notably, the Xeon variants include support for ECC memory, VT-d and trusted execution that are not present on the consumer models, while only some Xeon E3 enable the integrated GPU that is present on Sandy Bridge. Like its Xeon 3400-series predecessors, the Xeon E3 only supports operation with a single CPU socket and is targeted at entry-level workstations and servers. The CPUID of this processor is 0206A7h, the product code is 80623. === E3-12xx v2-series \"Ivy Bridge\" === Xeon E3-12xx v2 is a minor update of the Sandy Bridge-based E3-12xx, using the 22 nm shrink, and providing slightly better performance while remaining backwards compatible. They were released in May 2012 and mirror the desktop Core i3/i5/i7-3xxx parts. === E5-14xx/24xx series \"Sandy Bridge-EN\" and E5-16xx/26xx/46xx-series \"Sandy Bridge-EP\" === The Xeon E5-16xx processors follow the previous Xeon 3500/3600-series products as the high-end single-socket platform, using the LGA 2011 package introduced with this processor. They share the Sandy Bridge-E platform with the single-socket Core i7-38xx and i7-39xx processors. The CPU chips have no integrated GPU but eight CPU cores, some of which are disabled in the entry-level products. The Xeon E5-26xx line has the same features but also enables multi-socket operation like the earlier Xeon 5000-series and Xeon 7000-series processors. === E5-14xx v2/24xx v2 series \"Ivy Bridge-EN\" and E5-16xx v2/26xx v2/46xx v2 series \"Ivy Bridge-EP\" === The Xeon E5 v2 line was an update, released in September 2013 to replace the original Xeon E5 processors with a variant based on the Ivy Bridge shrink. The maximum number of CPU cores was raised to 12 per processor module and the total L3 cache was upped to 30 MB. The consumer version of the Xeon E5-16xx v2 processor is the Core i7-48xx and 49xx. === E7-28xx v2/48xx v2/88xx v2 series \"Ivy Bridge-EX\" === The Xeon E7 v2 line was an update, released in February 2014 to replace the original Xeon E7 processors with a variant based on the Ivy Bridge shrink. There was no Sandy Bridge version of these processors. == Haswell-based Xeon == === E3-12xx v3 series \"Haswell-WS\" === Intel Xeon E3-1241 v3 CPU, sitting atop the inside part of its retail box that contains an OEM fan-cooled heatsink Intel Xeon E3-1220 v3 CPU, pin side Introduced in May 2013, Xeon E3-12xx v3 is the first Xeon series based on the Haswell microarchitecture. It uses the new LGA 1150 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Haswell processors, incompatible with the LGA 1155 that was used in Xeon E3 and E3 v2. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts. The main benefit of the new microarchitecture is better power efficiency. === E5-16xx/26xx v3 series \"Haswell-EP\" === Intel Xeon E5-1650 v3 CPU; its retail box contains no OEM heatsink Introduced in September 2014, Xeon E5-16xx v3 and Xeon E5-26xx v3 series use the new LGA 2011-v3 socket, which is incompatible with the LGA 2011 socket used by earlier Xeon E5 and E5 v2 generations based on Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge microarchitectures. Some of the main benefits of this generation, compared to the previous one, are improved power efficiency, higher core counts, and bigger last level caches (LLCs). Following the already used nomenclature, Xeon E5-26xx v3 series allows dual-socket operation. One of the new features of this generation is that Xeon E5 v3 models with more than 10 cores support cluster on die (COD) operation mode, allowing CPU's multiple columns of cores and LLC slices to be logically divided into what is presented as two non-uniform memory access (NUMA) CPUs to the operating system. By keeping data and instructions local to the \"partition\" of CPU which is processing them, thus decreasing the LLC access latency, COD brings performance improvements to NUMA-aware operating systems and applications. === E7-48xx/88xx v3 series \"Haswell-EX\" === Introduced in May 2015, Xeon E7-48xx v3 and Xeon E7-88xx v3 series provide higher core counts, higher per-core performance and improved reliability features, compared to the previous Xeon E7 v2 generation. Following the usual SKU nomenclature, Xeon E7-48xx v3 and E7-88xx v3 series allow multi-socket operation, supporting up to quad- and eight-socket configurations, respectively. These processors use the LGA 2011 (R1) socket. Xeon E7-48xx v3 and E7-88xx v3 series contain a quad-channel integrated memory controller (IMC), supporting both DDR3 and DDR4 LRDIMM or RDIMM memory modules through the use of Jordan Creek (DDR3) or Jordan Creek 2 (DDR4) memory buffer chips. Both versions of the memory buffer chip connect to the processor using version 2.0 of the Intel Scalable Memory Interconnect (SMI) interface, while supporting lockstep memory layouts for improved reliability. Up to four memory buffer chips can be connected to a processor, with up to six DIMM slots supported per each memory buffer chip. Xeon E7-48xx v3 and E7-88xx v3 series also contain functional bug-free support for Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX), which was disabled via a microcode update in August 2014 for Haswell-E, Haswell-WS (E3-12xx v3) and Haswell-EP (E5-16xx/26xx v3) models, due to a bug that was discovered in the TSX implementation. == Broadwell-based Xeon == === E3-12xx v4 series \"Broadwell-WS\" === Introduced in June 2015, Xeon E3-12xx v4 is the first Xeon series based on the Broadwell micro architecture. It uses LGA 1150 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Haswell processors. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts. The main benefit of the new microarchitecture is the new lithography process, which results in better power efficiency. == Skylake-based Xeon == === E3-12xx v5 series \"Skylake-WS\" === Introduced in October 2015, Xeon E3-12xx v5 is the first Xeon series based on the Skylake microarchitecture. It uses new LGA 1151 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Skylake processors. Although it uses the same socket as consumer processors, it is limited to the C200 server chipset series and will not work with consumer chipsets like Z170. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory in the Xeon-branded parts. == Kaby Lake-based Xeon == === E3-12xx v6 series === Introduced in January 2017, Xeon E3-12xx v6 is the first Xeon series based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture. It uses the same LGA 1151 socket, which was introduced with the desktop Core i5/i7 Skylake processors. As before, the main difference between the desktop and server versions is added support for ECC memory and improved energy efficiency in the Xeon-branded parts. == Coffee Lake-based Xeon == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !
