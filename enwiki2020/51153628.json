    "text": "Margareta Wechsler \"Medi\" Dinu ( \u2013 July 18, 2016) was a Romanian classical painter of Jewish origin. ==Early life== Margareta Wechsler Dinu was born in Brezoi, V\u00e2lcea County, the daughter of a Jewish accountant, Daniel Wechsler, and a violin player, Amalia Hirschfeld. Due to the rise in power of the Iron Guard, at the age of 8, she was forced to leave her hometown of Brezoi and in the next few years lived in several cities: Bucharest, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, Cluj, Oradea, R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea. She was spared deportation due to her father's veteran status. Medi pursued her studies, graduated from the bourgeois \"Choisi Mangru\" high-school in Bucharest and learned to speak in four languages: Romanian, German, Hungarian and French. Encouraged by her arts teacher, painter Costin Petrescu, she continued her studies at the Academy of Belle Arte, under Ipolit Str\u00e2mbu and Jean Alexandru Steriadi. At the same time, she studied at the Faculty of Mathematics under Dan Barbilian and the Faculty of Philosophy under Dimitrie Gusti and Nae Ionescu. ==Career== Dinu debuted in 1932 at the \"Official Salon of White and Black\" exhibition in Bucharest, with a self- portrait. She joined the Syndicate of Artists a year later, which enabled her to travel to Balchik, a meeting place of the (mostly Jewish) avant-garde artists of the time. Between 1934 and 1939, she visited the city of Balchik on several occasions and completed a number of works, befriending personalities such as Victor Brauner, Gellu Naum, Sa\u0219a Pan\u0103, Geo Bogza. Here, she also met poet Gheorghe Dinu, who became her husband. In 1939, the mayor of Balchik, Octavian Mo\u015fescu, invited Dinu to exhibit her works alongside other artists in the city's school. After the Second World War, Dinu was prohibited by the authoritarian Romanian Communist Party from publishing her works and began working as a school teacher at a Jewish school in Bucharest. Between 1940 and 1986, she traveled and worked in various cities in Romania, Bulgaria and France. Her work remained largely unknown until 2003, when she returned to her artistic life and took part in the \"Senior contemporary painters of Romanian\" exhibition in Bucharest, receiving critical acclaim. In 2008, Dinu created two exhibitions at the Museums of Art in Constan\u021ba and Tulcea, donating a part of her works to these institutions. In January 2009, at her centenarian anniversary, the National Foundation for Sciences and Art of the Romanian Academy hosted a retrospective exhibition of her works. In 2010, she was awarded the \"Victor Brauner Trophy\" by the Niram Art Publishing House in Madrid. In 2016, on International Women's Day, Dinu's works from various periods were displayed as part of the exhibition \"Ages of Youth\" at the \"House of Arts\" Cultural Center in Bucharest. Dinu's works can be found at the municipal Museums of Art of Constan\u021ba, Tulcea, R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea; at the Metropolitan Library \"Mihail Sadoveanu\", at Eminescu's Memorial in Ipote\u0219ti and private collections. ==Artistical style== The body of her work includes pencil drawings and paintings (water colors or oil) depicting portraits, nature or marine landscapes. Her work belongs to the classical style and can be described as lyrical figurative art, en plein air, almost mathematical in simplicity, nature being stripped down to its essentials. Even though she worked and befriended various personalities of the Romanian interbellum avant- garde, she did not approve nor understand their movement, claiming that it was disconnected from the past. ==Death== Dinu died on July 18, 2016, at the age of 107, at a Jewish nursing home in Bucharest.Famous painter Medi Dinu dies at 107 In regards to her age, at 101, she remarked that \"maybe that's why God gave me so many years, to tell small things which have not been passed down.\" ==References== ==External links== *Gallery of works \u2013 wikiart.org *Niram Art Awards: Medi Dinu - video includes interview in Romanian with the artist (with Spanish subtitles) and slideshow of her works Category:1909 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Romanian Jews Category:Romanian centenarians Category:Romanian painters Category:Romanian avant-garde Category:People from V\u00e2lcea County Category:Women centenarians ",
