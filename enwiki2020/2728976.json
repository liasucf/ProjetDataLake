The Geographical Names Board decided to name the area Bonnet Bay in 1969. Construction started in late 1969 at Fillmore Rd. completion of all house plots in 1985.

It extends for about two kilometres. The reserve effectively surrounds Bonnet Bay, with the only two roads leading into the suburb, cutting through it. Burnum Burnum Reserve hosts some plants that are almost extinct and are protected. However, it also represents a constant fire threat to Bonnet Bay, most notably manifesting in the 1994 Como bushfires. The reserve was originally known as \"Jannali Reserve\" but the name was changed in 2005 to commemorate Burnum Burnum, the prominent aboriginal Sutherland Shire resident. A small plaque details his speech in England at Australia's bicentenary in 1988. A noteworthy feature of this suburb is that all of the streets are named after American Presidents. Washington Drive runs through the length of the suburb and is twice split into one-way 'Upper' and 'Lower' sections due to the steep hills it runs across. Nixon is the last President a street is named after. The only street not named after an American president is Tudar Road, which originates in NW Sutherland and cuts through Burnum Burnum reserve to enter Bonnet Bay. ==Commercial area== Bonnet Bay is mostly residential, with a small shopping centre located in Kennedy Crescent, known as the Bonnet Bay Shopping Village. Bonnet Bay Public School is located on Tudar Road. ==Recreation== Bonnet Bay has a boat ramp, a number of picnic and recreational areas, including a cricket oval, soccer oval, two netball courts, two tennis courts and two baseball fields. ==Events== Bonnet Bay was well known in southern Sydney for its extensive displays of Christmas decorations and lights during the festive season, though the tradition reached its peak in the mid-1980s and has since spread to other areas throughout the Sutherland Shire. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Bays of New South Wales Category:Sutherland Shire ",
