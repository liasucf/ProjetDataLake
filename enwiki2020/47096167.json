Before his death in 2001 he gave his grandson his service medals, which started the collection.

The display in the period chemist's shop was acquired from the Yesterday's World attraction in Great Yarmouth following its closure in 2014. ==Blitz Street== The museum is housed along 'Blitz Street', and is based on the British Home Front during World War II; it features two period shops including a chemist's and a grocer's, a fully equipped 1940s kitchen and living room, an Anderson shelter complete with contents, a display of World War II uniforms, helmets and other artifacts, and a reconstruction of Captain Mainwaring's church hall office from Dad's Army.
