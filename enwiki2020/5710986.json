ROMS is a body designated by Russian law for collecting and distributing statutory copyright royalty payments from radio stations and Internet download sites in Russia. It is disputed whether they are authorized by law to allow music for download. This is currently pending in the Russian legal system. ==Timeline== * Was created in 2000 by Russian Authors Society. * Banned from payment services by its credit card processor company Chronopay due to a law dispute. ROMS filed a complaint with the Prosecutor's Office against ChronoPay and its owner Pavel Vrublevsky, claiming a market monopolisation by it. This complaint resulted in neither judicial nor criminal action. * Out of operations from 2009 after changing Russian copyright law in 2008. ==Websites== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
