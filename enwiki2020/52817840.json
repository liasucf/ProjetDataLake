The Bombing of Hannover was a series of eighty-eight air raids by RAF Bomber Command and the United States Army Air Forces on the German city of Hanover during World War II.

R\u00f6hrbein (ed.s): Hannover Chronik: Von den Anf\u00e4ngen bis zur Gegenwart, Zahlen \u2022 Daten \u2022 Fakten, Schl\u00fctersche, Hannover, 1991 Around 1,000 aerial mines, 34,000 high explosive bombs, 900,000 incendiary bombs and 50,000 fire bombs were dropped. The heaviest raid was that by the RAF on the night of 8/9 October 1943, killing 1,245 people. This was an example of the carpet bombing of suburban and residential civilian targets laid out in the 14 February 1942 Area Bombing Directive.J\u00f6rg Friedrich: Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940\u20131945, S. 83 At the end of the war 90% of the city centre was destroyed, with 52% of buildings heavily damaged or completely destroyed. Ausstellung des Volksbund Niedersachsen: \u201eNiedersachsen im Krieg\u201c \u2013 Der Bombenkrieg (pdf, 533 kB) A total of 7.5 million cubic metres of rubble had to be removed. Of the 147,222 dwellings recorded at the end of 1939, 51.2% were heavily damaged or totally destroyed, 43.6% lightly or moderately damaged and only 7,489 dwellings (5.2%) completely undamaged. The Aegidienkirche and Nikolaikapelle were both destroyed but it was decided to leave them in ruins after the war as a war memorial == Strategic importance== The Deurag-Nerag refineries at the end of the war The Aegidienkirche Before the war Hannover was the thirteenth largest city in Germany and Austria, with 471,000 inhabitants \u2013 on average this fell to 287,000 during the war (mainly due to evacuations) and in May 1945 was down to 217,000. It was the headquarters of 19th Infantry Division, military district XI and a military training facility. Klaus Mlynek, Waldemar R. R\u00f6hrbein (ed.): Stadtlexikon Hannover: Von den Anf\u00e4ngen bis zur Gegenwart, Schl\u00fctersche, Hannover 2009, S. 694 Hannover was an important railway junction at the intersection of two major east-west and north-south routes. It was the fifth most active industrial centre in the Third Reich, producing tyres for military vehicles and aircraft and other rubber parts and products in three Continental AG factories. Its Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen Hannover and Hanomag factories also produced guns and tracked-vehicles.,vffwts.de whilst an AFA (Accumulatoren Fabrik Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 laterVARTA) factory built in 1938 produced batteries for submarines and torpedoes from 1940 onwards.Burkhard Nadolny, Wilhelm Treue: VARTA \u2013 Ein Unternehmen der Quandt Gruppe 1888\u20131963, Verlag Mensch und Arbeit M\u00fcnchen 1964 A new Vereinigten Leichtmetallwerke (VLW) factory had been built in 1935 on a site in the Linden-S\u00fcd district formerly used by the Hannoversche Waggonfabrik after the latter went bankrupt. The VLW also built a factory in Laatzen outside the city limits in 1936 which was not directly attacked. Two large refineries Deurag and Nerag in Misburg on the northeastern outskirts of the city produced gasoline and motor oils for the Luftwaffe, meaning they were targeted early and continued to be attacked, especially late on in the war. ==Raids== Lancaster on a bombing run Raids on Hannover involved a relatively short flying-time from bases in the United Kingdom and the nearby Steinhuder Meer provided a useful navigational aid. The 78 hectare Maschsee on the southern edge of the city centre was partly covered with wooden boards and artificial islands to make it less recognizable from the air, but the geometrical patterns in the 50 hectare Gro\u00dfer Garten remained undisguised and were used by the RAF's H2S radar from mid 1943 onwards. === 1939 and 1940 \u2013 initial raids === The first raid was on 4 September 1939, the day after the British declaration of war \u2013 it involved just one RAF Armstrong Whitworth Whitley dropping leaflets. On 19 May 1940 the RAF bombed the Misburg refineries, killing nineteen people. 1 August the same year saw the first raid on Hannover itself, with a raid on the Seilerstra\u00dfe in the south of the city. On 30 September 1940 six planes destroyed several buildings in W\u00fclfel and Linden. ===1941=== On 10 February 1941, the city was raided by 220 British planes, mainly hitting the eastern district and killing 101 people. Another British raid followed on the night of 15/16 April on the Vahrenwald and Hainholz and on 15/16 June on the VLW-Werk factory and the Misburg refineries. Although these raids damaged the factories' productivity, they were repeatedly able to resume production. === 26 July 1943 \u2013 Destruction of the city centre === Alten Rathauses (1943) === 22\u201323 September 1943 === === 27\u201328 September 1943 === === 9 October 1943 \u2013 The \"Black Day\" === === 18 October 1943 === Schloss Herrenhausen \u2013 19th century view of the gardens. === 1944 === === 28 March 1945 \u2013 final raid === The destroyed Hauptbahnhof (1945) \u2013 to the left are the ruins of the post and telegraph building, now the site of the Ernst-August- Galerie shopping centre. == Bibliography == * Neue Presse, Hannover: Als die Stadt in Tr\u00fcmmern lag, Serie von Juli bis Oktober 2003 * J\u00f6rg Friedrich: Der Brand.
