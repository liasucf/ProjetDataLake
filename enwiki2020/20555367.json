    "text": "The Electra Tower, previously Amkor Tower or Elco Tower, is an office skyscraper in Tel Aviv, Israel, located on Yigal Allon Street. At 165 meters, it is one of the tallest buildings in the city. Originally it was planned to be Tel Aviv's tallest tower, and one of the country's tallest towers upon completion, but the final plan lowered this to a 45-floor skyscraper. The building was completed in January 2011. Fifteen (initially fivehttp://www.calcalist.co.il/real_estate/articles/0,7340,L-3468302,00.html ) of the tower's floors, totaling 8000 m2 are rented by Google Israel.
