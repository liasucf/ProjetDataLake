    "text": "Tupanvirus is the name of two giant viruses, Tupanvirus deep ocean and Tupanvirus soda lake. They are named after Tup\u00e3 (Tupan), a Guaran\u00ed thunder god, and the places they were found. These are the first viruses reported to possess genes for amino-acyl tRNA synthetases for all 20 standard amino acids. Tupanvirus measure up to 1.2 \u03bcm in complete virion length, with a capsid similar to that of amoebal mimiviruses in size (~450 nm) and structure. However, the Tupanvirus virion presents a large cylindrical tail (~550 nm \u00d7 450 nm diameter) attached to the base of the capsid. Some particles can reach up to 2.3 \u03bcm because of the variation in tail size. == Genome == The genome contains roughly 1.5 million base pairs of double-stranded DNA, coding for 1276\u20131425 predicted proteins. Many genes that encode for processes found in cellular organisms are found in Tupanvirus genome. As a giant virus, Tupanvirus present the largest translational apparatus within the known virosphere. The analysis of tupanviruses constitutes a new step towards understanding the evolution of giant viruses. == Host == Tupanviruses are able to infect protists and amoebas, but probably pose no threat to humans. ==References== Category:Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses Category:Unaccepted virus taxa Category:Mimiviridae ",
