    "text": "Overnight Sensation is the thirteenth studio album by the band Mot\u00f6rhead released 15 October 1996, their second on the Steamhammer label. ==Recording== The album was Mot\u00f6rhead's third album with producer Howard Benson. Following the departure of W\u00fcrzel (Michael Burston) in 1995, the band returned to the same three-man \"classic Mot\u00f6rhead line up\"; bass guitar/vocals, lead guitar, and drums. In a rare outside songwriter credit, Swedish Erotica guitarist Magnus Axx contributed to writing the song \"Civil War\". This album was also the first since Ace of Spades (1980) to have a picture of the band on the cover. Despite being only a three-piece band, the band had a heavier style on this work than on its previous album, Sacrifice. Vocalist and bassist Lemmy Kilmister recalls that, amidst the touring, the record took about four weeks to write new songs and four weeks to record in the studio.Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss White Line Fever (2002) \u2014 Simon & Schuster pp. 276\u2014277 . Lemmy talked about the return to being a three piece: ==Release== In Joel McIver's 2011 book Overkill: The Untold Story of Mot\u00f6rhead, drummer Mikkey Dee is quoted saying that the songwriting was affected by guitarist W\u00fcrzel's departure: The album is notable for featuring a picture of Lemmy without his trademark mutton chops. He regrew them in 2001 and would retain them until his death. When Lemmy appraised the album in the 2004 Mot\u00f6rhead documentary The Guts and the Glory, Lemmy stated: ==Reception== Overnight Sensation was the band's first official record for CMC. Sacrifice (1995) was already partly in the States on import, but the label proved itself with Overnight Sensation and it became the best-distributed record the band had for some time. It charted in Germany, Sweden and Finland. AllMusic calls the LP: Lee Marlow of Classic Rock stated in 2013 that Overnight Sensation was: ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Per the Overnight Sensation liner notes. * Lemmy \u2013 lead vocals, bass, harmonica on \"Crazy Like A Fox\", acoustic guitar on \"Overnight Sensation\" and \"Listen To Your Heart\" * Phil Campbell \u2013 lead guitar * Mikkey Dee \u2013 drums ===Production=== * Howard Benson \u2013 producer * Duane Baron \u2013 producer, Mixing * Ryan Dorn \u2013 producer, mixing * James Ornelas \u2013 assistant engineer * Evan Levy \u2013 assistant engineer * Dwayne Baron \u2013 assistant engineer * Dan Hersch \u2013 mastering * Mot\u00f6rhead \u2013 executive producers * Diane Medak \u2013 production coordinator * Annamaria DiSanto \u2013 album cover * Shannon Crawford \u2013 album cover == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart !Peak position |- |German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) | align=\"center\" |71 |- |Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | align=\"center\" |60 |- |Finland (YLE) | align=\"center\" |39 |- |} == References == ==External links== *Sample tracks at Rolling Stone *Mot\u00f6rhead official website Category:Mot\u00f6rhead albums Category:1996 albums Category:Albums produced by Howard Benson Category:Albums produced by Duane Baron ",
