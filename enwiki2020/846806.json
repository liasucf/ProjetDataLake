In the early stage of the company development, the neoprene sheets needed to produce such a line were dearly priced and tightly controlled by a handful of Japanese suppliers. Therefore, the founder, Mr, Pi-goon Sheiue, and his son, Min Shiue, were intent on bringing the neoprene in-house. By 1983, the experimentation was a success and the first neoprene production line of the company was established. In 1996, the company's vertical integration was expanded to create \"Shei Heng Hsin Sheiflex Ind. co., Ltd.\" and began producing spandex yarn. Two spandex manufacturing facilities were established in Taiwan and mainland China. A spandex brand, Sheiflex, is created in order to promote their spandex yarn. ==See also== *Sportswear (activewear) *Wetsuit *Neoprene ==References== ==External links== * Category:1968 establishments in Taiwan Category:Clothing companies established in 1968 Category:Clothing manufacturers Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of Taiwan Category:Water sports equipment manufacturers ",
