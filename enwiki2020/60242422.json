In 1989 the building was deemed \"architecturally and historically significant in the commercial history of Henderson, Kentucky. The property is an unusually good example of turn-of-the-century service businesses architecture of the time. Although not a highly visible Main Street retail establishment, the property's facade displays a pleasing design of brick arch-work within a recessed plane. The property is in good condition and a high degree of integrity has been maintained.\" With Henderson post office, on the site ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Henderson County, Kentucky Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1897 ",
