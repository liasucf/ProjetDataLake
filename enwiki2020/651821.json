Many critics have praised Generations of Winter as a new Doctor Zhivago-style, large-scale Russian novel, which tells the story of a Russian/Georgian family, the Gradovs, struggling to survive in the Stalinist era. As the Wall Street Journal put it: \"Aksyonov has ambitiously set out to challenge Tolstoy on his own ground, creating a gigantic historical novel on the grand pre-revolutionary model.\" In late 2004 a television-series based on the novel premiered on Russian television. It has 22 episodes. ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * * * The series on DVD, in Russian.
