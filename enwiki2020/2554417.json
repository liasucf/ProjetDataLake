The provincial government named the highway the Jubilee Highway on December 21, 2012 in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. The highway is part of the Prince Edward Island loop of the Trans-Canada Highway and connects the Northumberland Ferries terminal in Caribou in the north with the mainline Trans-Canada at Highway 104 near Mount William in the south, east of New Glasgow. == Route description == Highway 106 begins at a trumpet interchange with Highway 104\\. The route bypasses to the west side of New Glasgow by running along the centre of Abercrombie Point. It crosses Pictou Harbour to the town of Pictou using the Harvey A. Veniot Causeway, which opened in 1968. A traffic circle at the west end of Pictou, known as the Pictou Rotary, connects Highway 106 with the centre of town as well as Trunk 6 (the Sunrise Trail) and Route 376. The route is a super two expressway except for a short section of at-grade two lane highway near the northern terminus. The route ends in Caribou at the Northumberland Ferries terminal to Prince Edward Island, where the Trans-Canada Highway designation continues as Prince Edward Island Highway 1. ==Major intersections== == References == 106 Nova Scotia 106 Category:Roads in Pictou County Category:Limited-access roads in Canada ",
