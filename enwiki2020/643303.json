It is located on St Mary Axe, within the Aldgate ward, and is a rare example of a City church that survived both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz.The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches Tucker, T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 The present building was constructed in 1532 but a church has existed on the site since the 12th century. Today, St Andrew Undershaft is administered from the nearby St Helen's Bishopsgate church. ==History== St Andrew Undershaft in 2001 The first church on the site, which today is bordered by St Mary Axe and Leadenhall Street, was built in medieval times, being recorded in 1147.The London Encyclopaedia Hibbert, C.; Weinreb, D.; Keay, J.: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993, 2008) It was rebuilt in the 14th century and again in 1532;London:the City Churches Pevsner, N./Bradley, S.: New Haven, Yale, 1998 this third incarnation of the building survives today. It is in the Perpendicular styleThe City of London Churches Betjeman, J. Andover, Pikin, 1967 with its entrance located at the base of its off-centre tower. The interior is divided into six bays, with many of the original fittings that survived Victorian renovation. Formerly, St Andrew Undershaft had one of London's few surviving large stained-glass windows, installed in the 17th century, but this was destroyed in the Baltic Exchange bombing in 1992. The church's curious name derives from the shaft of the maypoleThe City Churches Tabor, M. p. 27:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 that was traditionally set up each year opposite the church.Cobb, G. London city churches: London, B T Batsford Ltd., 1977 The custom continued each spring until 1517, when student riots put an end to it, but the maypole itself survived until 1547 when it was seized by a mob and destroyed as a \"pagan idol\". St Andrew Undershaft is now administered from the nearby church of St Helen's Bishopsgate. St Andrew Undershaft was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. The tower holds a peal of six bells in the key of G, with the tenor being cast in 1597 by Robert Mot. These are now hung dead (they can only be rung stationary) inside the tower.http://london.lovesguide.com/andrew_undershaft.htm ==Organ== The organ in St Andrew Undershaft The organ was installed in 1696 by Renatus Harris.
