He was elected Co-President of Volt Europa (together with Valerie Sternberg of Volt Deutschland) at the 2019 General Assembly in Sofia, 12-13 October 2019. About the EU he declared that he agreed with the view of eurosceptics but that instead of destroying it he wants to improve it by making it more transparent, democratic and social. Lanschot claims that the Brexit and the recent spike in popularity of Thierry Baudet have strengthened the party. He and his party also believe in the cause of environmentalism. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Dutch politicians ",
