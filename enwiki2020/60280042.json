    "text": "Iddin-Sin (: DI-ti-n S\u00een) was a King (\ud808\ude17 \u0160\u00e0r, pronounced Shar) of the Kingdom of Simurrum circa 2000-1900 BCE. Simurrum was an important city state of the Mesopotamian area, during the period of the Akkadian Empire down to Ur III. The Simurrum Kingdom disappears from records after the Old Babylonian period. According to an inscription (the stela now located in the Sulaymaniyah Museum), Iddin-Sin seems to have been contemporary with Lullubi king Annubanini.History of Iddin-Sin's stela Several rulers of the Simurrum Kingdom are known, such as Iddin-Sin and his son Zabazuna. Various inscriptions suggest that they were contemporary with king Ishbi-Erra (1953\u2014c.1920 BCE). In inscriptions, the name of Iddin-Sin is written \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udd3f\ud808\udefe\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udc97\ud808\udf6a, with one silent honorific (\ud808\udc2d, \"Divine\") before the phonological part of the name, \ud808\udd3f\ud808\udefe\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udc97\ud808\udf6a, where the second \ud808\udc2d (An) has the value of \"n\". The last part \ud808\udc97\ud808\udf6a was initially En-Zu but is pronounced S\u00een, name of the Moon God. Four inscription and a relief of the Simurrum have been identified at Bitwata near Ranya in Iraqi Kurdistan, near the border with Iran, including the large relief now in the Israel Museum, and one from Sarpol-e Zahab. It is thought that the design of the relief is derived from the Victory Stele of Naram-Sin, King of the Akkadian Empire (2254-2218 BCE), in which the king is also seen trampling enemies. It is also similar to other reliefs in the area, such as the Anubanini rock relief. The Sarpol-e Zahab relief, representing a beardless warrior with axe, trampling a foe, and inscribed with the name \"Zaba(zuna), son of ...\", may be the son of Iddin-Sin. Iddi-Sin is also known from a stele, which he inscribed in the Akkadian language, now in the Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq. A seal showing Iddin-Sin and his son Zabazuna (: Za-ba-zu-na), is also known from the Rosen collection.
