    "text": "Nello Cristianini (born 1968) is a Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol. ==Education== Cristianini holds a degree in Physics from the University of Trieste, a Master in Computational Intelligence from the University of London and a PhD from the University of Bristol. Previously he has been an associate professor at the University of California, Davis. ==Research== His research contributions encompass the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence and bioinformatics. Particularly, his work has focused on statistical analysis of learning algorithms, to its application to support vector machines, kernel methods and other algorithms. Cristianini is the co-author of two widely known books in machine learning, An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis and a book in bioinformatics \"Introduction to Computational Genomics\". Recent research has focused on the big-data analysis of newspapers content, the analysis of social media content, and the ethical implication of data-driven approaches to science and society. Previous research had focused on unified theoretical frameworks for statistical pattern analysis; machine learning and artificial intelligence; machine translation; bioinformatics. As a practitioner of data-driven AI and Machine Learning, Cristianini frequently gives public talks about the need for a deeper ethical understanding of the effects of modern data-science on society. ==Awards and honours== Cristianini is a recipient of the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award and a current holder of a European Research Council Advanced Grant. In June 2014, Nello Cristianini was included in a list of the \"most influential scientists of the decade\" compiled by Thomson Reuters (listing the top one per cent of scientists who are \u201cthe world\u2019s leading scientific minds\u201d and whose publications are among the most influential in their fields). In December 2016 he was included in the list of Top100 most influential researchers in Machine Learning by AMiner - . In 2017 Nello Cristianini was the keynote speaker at the Annual STOA Lecture at the European Parliament. ==References== == External links == * Support Vector Machines: Book and Resources * Personal Web Page * Bioinformatics Text Book * Bristol University fab five among world's finest scientists; The Bristol Post | August 08, 2014 * Five Bristol scientists named among \u201cthe world\u2019s leading scientific minds\u201d, University of Bristol * AMiner 2016 most influential scholars in Machine Learning Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:People from the Province of Gorizia Category:Academics of the University of Bristol Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:University of California, Davis faculty Category:Italian scientist stubs Category:Italian computer scientists Category:European Research Council grantees ",
