    "text": "The Pas is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created in 1912 following the expansion of the province's northern border, and has existed continuously since that time. It is named for the rural city of The Pas. Until the 1960s, elections in The Pas were deferred until a few weeks after the rest of the province for logistical reasons. It was not unheard of for politicians from the south of the province to run in The Pas after being chosen as cabinet ministers by newly elected provincial governments; Edward Brown and John Bracken were both elected in this manner. The Pas is located in the north of the province. It is bordered by Rupertsland to the east and south, Thompson and Flin Flon to the north, Swan River and Lake Winnipeg to the south, and the province of Saskatchewan to the west. Besides The Pas, it also includes Easterville and Norway House. The riding's population in 1996 was 19,449. In 1999, the average family income was $42,878, and the unemployment rate was 17.80%. Health and social services account for 14% of the riding's economy, with retail trade accounting for another 14%. Sixty-seven per cent of the riding's residents are aboriginal, the second- highest rate in the province. The Pas has been represented by candidates of the New Democratic Party since 1969 (and for all but 11 years since 1943), and is now considered safe for the party. The district is currently held by Amanda Lathlin, daughter of former NDP MLA Oscar Lathlin following the resignation of Frank Whitehead on May 16, 2014. He had previously won a by-election on March 24, 2009 following the death in office of his predecessor Oscar Lathlin. Following the 2018 redistribution, the riding will be abolished into The Pas- Kameesak, Flin Flon and Keewatinook. ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Party !
