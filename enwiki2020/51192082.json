The species C. minuta has been published and validated, and C. timonensis and C. massiliensis have been proposed as novel species of the genus Christensenella, all isolated from human feces. C. minuta in the gut has been associated with reduction in body weight and adiposity of mice.The human gut bacterium Christensenella minuta reduces weight and adiposity gains in mice, Jillian L. Waters, Julia K. Goodrich, Ruth E. Ley, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Department of Microbiology, Cornell University Basic presentation of results. In a test on 977 volunteers, humans with higher levels of Christensenella in their guts were found to be more likely to have a lower body mass index than those with low levels. ==References== Category:Clostridiaceae Category:Gram- negative bacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2011 ",
