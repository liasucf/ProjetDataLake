The Wichita Wings, in this formation, were a revitalized version of the original Wings franchise that played in the MISL and NPSL for 22 years, before folding in 2001. This incarnation of the Wings shut down after the 2012-13 Major Indoor Soccer League season. They were replaced by a new team called the Wichita B-52s who play in the Professional Arena Soccer League, which later became the Major Arena Soccer League. ==Year-by-year== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Season !League !Regular Season !Playoffs !Avg.
