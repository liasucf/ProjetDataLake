The website's critics consensus reads, \"A stunning, lyrical piece of neon noir, P-Valley explores the unseen lives of strippers in Mississippi through Katori Hall's singular gaze, celebrating the beauty of the craft without sugarcoating the challenges.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Referred to as a Southern Gothic by critics, season one was praised for its portrayal of the Black women strippers' lives. Hannah Giorgis of The Atlantic wrote, \"P-Valley is lush, resplendent, and sometimes haunting. All of the women\u2019s strife occurs against the backdrop of sweeping southern vistas or kaleidoscopic lighting, often with eerily bouncing beats soundtracking their dances.\" Similarly, Tambay Obenson reviewed the show for IndieWire, \"These are richly crafted characters in what is essentially a quasi-family. It\u2019s obvious Hall did her homework, talking to dozens of strippers over six years, to make the production as authentic as possible.\" Critics also noted the portrayal of social issues. Eric Deggans stated in a review for NPR, \"...between the storylines about domestic abuse and a secret casino project, we see takes on colorism, closeted gay men and the struggle to survive when you're poor, Black and outside polite society in the South.\" Brandee Evans' acting received positive reception. Writing for The Ringer, Allison Herman stated, \"Evans is more than capable of carrying the show herself, and discovery of a freshly minted actress adds to the thrill.\" ===Ratings=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American black television series Category:2020s American drama television series Category:2020s American LGBT- related drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Starz original programming Category:Television series based on plays Category:Television shows set in Mississippi Category:Feminist television Category:LGBT African-American culture Category:Works about the sex industry ",
