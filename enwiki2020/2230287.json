The squadron is permanently stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island with a radio callsign of \"Thunder\". ==Early years== left Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron One Three Five was established on May 15, 1969, to provide electronic warfare and aerial refueling support to carrier air wings. It was stationed at Naval Air Station Alameda. The squadron first flew the EKA-3B Skywarrior and deployed to both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. In 1973, VAQ-135 relocated to NAS Whidbey Island and transitioned to the Grumman EA-6B Prowler. The squadron first deployed with the EA-6B to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) and the Indian Ocean from January to September 1976 with Carrier Air Wing 2 (CVW-2) aboard . Following that deployment, VAQ-135 transitioned to the Improved Capability Prowler (ICAP) and became the first fleet EA-6B ICAP squadron. The squadron deployed with Carrier Air Wing 8 (CVW-8) aboard from November 1977 to July 1978 to the Mediterranean Sea. In January 1979, VAQ-135 commenced refresher training with Carrier Air Wing 15 (CVW-15) aboard and deployed to the Western Pacific in May 1979. During deployment, they received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations in the Indian Ocean during the Iranian hostage crisis, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and their first Chief of Naval Operations Safety \u201cS\u201d Award.
