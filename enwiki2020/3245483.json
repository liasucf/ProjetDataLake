    "text": "Geographical renaming is the changing of the name of a geographical feature or area. This can range from the change of a street name to a change to the name of a country. Some names are changed locally but the new names are not recognised by other countries, especially when there is a difference in language. Other names may not be officially recognised but remain in common use. Many places have different names in different languages, and a change of language in official or general use has often resulted in what is arguably a change of name. There are many reasons to undertake renaming, with political motivation being the primary cause; for example many places in the former Soviet Union and its satellites were renamed to honour Stalin. Sometimes a place reverts to its former name (see for example de-Stalinization). One of the most common reasons for a country changing its name is newly acquired independence. When borders are changed, sometimes due to a country splitting or two countries joining together, the names of the relevant areas can change. This, however, is more the creation of a different entity than an act of geographical renaming. Other more unusual reasons for renaming have included getting rid of an inappropriate or embarrassing name and as part of a sponsorship deal or publicity stunt A change might see a completely different name being adopted or may only be a slight change in spelling. In some cases established institutions preserve the old names of the renamed places in their names, such as the Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea; the Peking University in Beijing; Bombay Stock Exchange, IIT Bombay and the Bombay High Court in Mumbai; University of Madras, Madras Stock Exchange, the Madras High Court, and IIT Madras in Chennai; the University of Malaya, Keretapi Tanah Melayu, in Malaysia; and SWAPO (South West Africa People's Organization), the ruling party of Namibia. Often the older name will persist in colloquial expressions. For example, the dish known in English as \"Peking duck\" retained that name even when the Chinese capital changed its transliteration to \"Beijing\". ==Romanisation== Changes in romanisation systems can result in minor or major changes in spelling in the Roman alphabet for geographical entities, even without any change in name pronunciation or spelling in the local alphabet or other writing system. Names in non-Roman characters can also be spelled very differently when Romanised in different European languages. ===Chinese names=== China developed and adopted the pinyin romanisation system in February 1958 in place of previous systems such as the postal romanization and Wade\u2013Giles. Many Chinese geographical entities (and associated entities named after geographical names) thus had their English names changed. The changes sometimes appear drastic, since it is sometimes the case that the former romanisations were derived from Cantonese\u2014the common language in British-held Hong Kong\u2014while the newer romanisations are derived entirely from Mandarin. However, the pronunciation in Mandarin has mostly stayed the same both before and after the change. Pinyin was adopted by the International Organization for Standardisation in 1982 and officially adopted in Singapore (resulting in several geographical name changes of its own). However it is usually not applied in the autonomous regions of the PRC (e.g. Lhasa, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Hohhot, Xigaz\u00ea, Ili, Altay, Kaxgar, Hulunbuir, Erenhot, with a notable exception being place names in Ningxia, whose native Hui people speak Mandarin as their native language) and has not resulted in any geographical name change in the SARs of Hong Kong and Macau, and is adopted only in parts of Taiwan, particularly within Taipei and other Kuomintang controlled cities and counties, in a recent push to adopt Pinyin by the Kuomintang government. Examples of changes: In the People's Republic of China *Peking \u2192 Beijing *Canton \u2192 Guangdong *Nanking \u2192 Nanjing *Sian \u2192 Xi'an *Chengtu \u2192 Chengdu *Chungking \u2192 Chongqing *Tientsin \u2192 Tianjin *Sinkiang \u2192 Xinjiang *Heilungkiang \u2192 Heilongjiang In the Republic of China (Taiwan) *Shih-lin \u2192 Shilin *Chung- cheng \u2192 Zhongzheng *Tamsui \u2192 Danshui (since reverted) In Singapore *Peck San \u2192 Bishan *Ao Kang \u2192 Hougang *Nee Soon \u2192 Yishun ===Korean names=== The introduction of the Revised Romanization of Korean in place of the McCune\u2013Reischauer system in 7 July 2000 by the South Korean government has resulted in a string of changes to geographical names. The system is not used by North Korea. Examples of changes include: *Inch\u014fn \u2192 Incheon *Ky\u014fngju \u2192 Gyeongju *Pusan \u2192 Busan *Taegu \u2192 Daegu *Taej\u014fn \u2192 Daejeon ==Exonyms and endonyms== For geographical entities with multiple pre-existing names in one or more languages, an exonym or endonym may gradually be substituted and used in the English language. *Transfer of a city between countries with very different patterns of phonology can result in seeming changes of name. Changes can be as slight as Stra\u00dfburg (Germany) and Strasbourg (France). Some are less subtle: Thessaloniki, built in 4th century BC in ancient Macedonia became Selanik in the Ottoman Empire and sometimes being referred to as Salonica, now Thessaloniki in Greece; Pilsen in the Austro-Hungarian Empire became Plze\u0148 in Czechoslovakia; Chi\u0219in\u0103u, now the capital of Moldova, was in Russian and Soviet times part of Romania and known as Kishinev (the latter name is used in English in certain historical contexts, e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Some are translations; Karlsbad become Karlovy Vary. *When the formerly-German city of Danzig came under Polish rule, it became known in English by its Polish name of Gda\u0144sk. But when Winston Churchill gave his Iron Curtain speech he still spoke of a city in Poland by its German name (Stettin) instead of its contemporary Polish name Szczecin even though Churchill fully accepted the transfer of the formerly-German city to Poland, probably because it is German phonology, not Polish, that is closer to English. The pattern is far from uniform, and it takes time. *The Soviet Union replaced German city names in the former East Prussia that became the Kaliningrad Oblast and Japanese place names in southern Sakhalin Island with Russian names unrelated to the old German and Japanese place names after annexing them in the aftermath of World War II. *The military junta changed the official English name of Burma to Myanmar in 1988, even though both were pre-existing names which originated from the Burmese language and used interchangeably depending on contexts (see Names of Myanmar). *Decolonisation in India saw a trend to change the established English names of cities to the names in the local language. Since then, changes have included Chennai (from Madras in August 1996), Kolkata (from Calcutta in January 2001) and Mumbai (from Bombay in 1995), amongst many others. *The People's Republic of China, upon its founding and new nationalities policy, changed the names of cities in ethnic minority regions from sometimes patronising Chinese language names to those of the native language. For example, it changed Dihua to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi and Zhenxi to Barkol. *After the occupation of the communist North Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War, the city of Saigon changed its name to Ho Chi Minh City (after the late leader of North Vietnam Ho Chi Minh) to symbolize the north's victory in the war. Despite the official name change, however, many older Americans (especially those who fought in the Vietnam War) still refer to the city as Saigon. Even many Vietnamese still refer to the city as Saigon. The name of the river, however, remains unchanged, the Saigon River. ==Changes resulting from splits and mergers== *Czechoslovakia got its name from the agglomeration of the Czech and Slovak peoples in 1918. It peacefully dissolved into the Czech and Slovak Republics in 1993. *Yugoslavia (\"Land of the South Slavs\") was originally Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, created by joining Kingdom of Serbia, Kingdom of Montenegro and parts of Austro-Hungarian Empire inhabited by South Slavs (today comprising Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Vojvodina (i.e. the Northern part of modern Serbia)) . It became Yugoslavia in 1929. It subsequently split into the modern states of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, North Macedonia and Montenegro between 1991\u20132006. Serbia's autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija unilaterally declared its independence in 2008. *The Gambia and Senegal became one as Senegambia Confederation 1982\u20131989 *Tanganyika and Zanzibar joined to become Tanzania *Egypt and Syria were briefly joined as the United Arab Republic *Malaya merged with the northern Borneo territories of Sabah and Sarawak to become Malaysia in 1963. *Various places split by compass directions, such as North and South Dakota, West Virginia and Virginia, North and South Korea, East and West Germany, etc. South Yemen was previously known as the Aden Protectorate and by other names. Some of these were subsequently unified, such as Vietnam, Germany, and Yemen. ==List of significant name changes== This is a list of internationally important or significant renamings. ===Countries=== *Terra de Santa Cruz \u2192 Brazil (1530) *Kingdom of Great Britain \u2192 United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801) \u2192 United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1927) *Temasik \u2192 Singapore (1819) *New Spain \u2192 Mexico (1821) *Upper Peru \u2192 Bolivia (1825) *Duchy of Brabant \u2192 Burgundian Netherlands (1384) \u2192 Habsburg Netherlands (1482) \u2192 Spanish Netherlands (1581) \u2192 Austrian Netherlands (1713) \u2192 United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815) \u2192 Kingdom of the Netherlands/Kingdom of Belgium (1830) *United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia \u2192 Romania (1859) *New Granada \u2192 Colombia (1819) \u2192 New Granada (1831) \u2192 Colombia (1863) *Santo Domingo \u2192 Dominican Republic *North German Confederation \u2192 Germany (1870) *Spanish East Indies \u2192 Philippines (1898) *Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd \u2192 Saudi Arabia (1932) *British Mandate of Mesopotamia (1920) \u2192 Iraq (1932) *Persia \u2192 Iran (1935) *Ireland \u2192 Southern Ireland (1921) \u2192 Irish Free State (1922) \u2192 Ireland (1937) *Abyssinia \u2192 Ethiopia (1941) *Dutch East Indies \u2192 Indonesia (1945 or 1949) *Transjordan \u2192 Jordan (1946) *Siam \u2192 Thailand (1949) *Gold Coast \u2192 Ghana (1957) *French Sudan \u2192 Mali (1960) *Ubangi-Shari \u2192 Central African Republic (1958) \u2192 Central African Empire (1976) \u2192 Central African Republic (1979) *French Congo \u2192 Republic of the Congo (1960) *Belgian Congo \u2192 Democratic Republic of the Congo (1960) \u2192 Za\u00efre (1971) \u2192 Democratic Republic of the Congo (1997) *Ruanda-Urundi \u2192 Rwanda/Burundi (1962) *British Kenya \u2192 Kenya (1963) *Nyasaland \u2192 Malawi (1964) *Northern Rhodesia \u2192 Zambia (1964) *Southern Rhodesia \u2192 Rhodesia (1965) \u2192 Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (1979) \u2192 Zimbabwe (1980) *Bechuanaland \u2192 Botswana (1966) *Basutoland \u2192 Lesotho (1966) *British Guiana \u2192 Guyana (1966) *Spanish Guinea \u2192 Equatorial Guinea (1968) *Sultanate of Muscat and Oman \u2192 Oman (1970) *Eastern Bengal and Assam (1905) \u2192 East Bengal (1947) \u2192 East Pakistan (1955) \u2192 Bangladesh (1971) *The Trucial States of the Coast of Oman \u2192 United Arab Emirates (1971) *Ceylon \u2192 Sri Lanka (1972) *British Honduras \u2192 Belize (1973) *Portuguese Guinea \u2192 Guinea-Bissau (1974) *Dutch Guiana \u2192 Suriname (1975) *Dahomey \u2192 Benin (1975) *Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire \u2192 Ivory Coast (1975 as another official name) *Spanish Sahara \u2192 Western Sahara (1975) \u2192 Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (1976;

According to the city's Royal Charter of 10 April 1662 the official name is Londonderry. This was reaffirmed in a High Court decision in January 2007 when Derry City Council sought guidance on the procedure for effecting a name change. The name Derry is preferred by nationalists and it is broadly used throughout Northern Ireland's Catholic community, as well as that of the Republic of Ireland, whereas many unionists prefer Londonderry; however in everyday conversation Derry is used by most Protestant residents of the city. Apart from this local government decision, the city is usually known as Londonderry in official use within the United Kingdom. In the Republic of Ireland, the city and county are almost always referred to as Derry, on maps, in the media and in conversation. *Shropshire \u2192 Salop (1974) \u2192 Shropshire (1980) ===Cities and towns=== *Amadora, Portugal, was known as Porcalhota until 1907.

Formerly known as Santa Mar\u00eda de Aguayo until 1863. *Cobh, Ireland - formerly known as Queenstown *Const\u00e2ncia, Portugal was known as Punhete until 1833. The name change was justified by the resemblance of the old toponym with the word punheta (Portuguese for \"hand job\"). *Dhaka, Bangladesh - previously Dacca *Daegu - spelt Taegu prior to the official adoption of the Revised Romanization by the South Korean Government in 2000. In ancient times, Dalgubeol (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c/\u9054\u53e5\u4f10) * Dnipro, Ukraine, was officially changed from Dnipropetrovsk in 2016, following Ukraine\u2019s decommunization laws (the former name is a contraction of the Ukrainian name of the river Dnieper and the surname of Soviet leader Hryhoriy Petrovsky).

Formerly known as Santa Mar\u00eda de los Remedios until 1831. *Florian\u00f3polis was known as Desterro until 1893, when the president of recent- founded Brazilian republic, Marshal Floriano Peixoto, crushed the Naval Revolts, and the supporters of Peixoto, after the imprisonment of all his opponents, changed the name of the city to honor the Marshal. *Gagarin, town in Russia ; formerly Gzhatsk, took current name after cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin's death in 1968 *Gda\u0144sk - in German Danzig, when part of Kingdom of Prussia or Germany (1793-1920 and 1940\u20135) and as a Free City (1920\u201339). *Gustavo A.

In Turkish times (1669\u20131898) it was called \"Kandiye\" by the Ottomans but from the locals \"Megalo Kastro\" (Great Castle) or simply \"Kastro\". During the time of the autonomous Cretan State (1898\u20131913) scholars proposed to reuse the ancient name \"Heraklion\" which eventually was accepted by the locals. *Hermosillo, Mexico. Known as Villa del Pitic until 1828. *Ho Chi Minh City - formerly Saigon, changed in 1975 after the fall of South Vietnam (see also Names of Ho Chi Minh City) *Huambo, formerly Nova Lisboa, changed in 1975 after the independence of Angola *Istanbul - since 28 March 1930, formerly Byzantium (under Greek rule) then Constantinople (under Roman and Ottoman rule); the latter name change inspired the popular song \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" (see also Names of Istanbul) *Iqaluit, capital of Nunavut Territory in Canada, known as Frobisher Bay until 1987. *Ivano-Frankivsk, founded as polish Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w in 1662, changed to Stanislau in 1772, under Austria.

All of which are changing annually and are met with opposition. *Naming disputes involving Israelis and Palestinians **West Bank/Judea and Samaria, disputed both between Israelis and Palestinians and between political factions inside Israel **Israel/The Zionist Entity/Palestine: People who refuse to recognize the State of Israel often call it The Zionist Entity. When such people refer to Palestine, they normally include Israel as part of Palestinian territory (along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip). *Kosovo/Kosova, disputed between Serbians and Albanians *Falkland Islands/Malvinas, disputed between Argentinians and British *Berlin to Kitchener name change, Canadian town's name changed during WWI *Australian place names changed from German names during WWI *S\u00f8nderjylland/Schleswig, disputed between Danes and Germans in the 19th Century *Disputes involving the name of a whole entity being used to refer to a part of it, and vice versa **US/America/North America: The terms 'America' and 'American' are frequently used to refer only to the United States and its people. This sometimes causes resentment among some non-US Americans, especially Latin Americans, who tend to respond by referring to the people of the US as Unitedstatesian (or 'estadounidenses' in Spanish), at least when not using the unofficial term 'gringos'. The practice is sometimes also followed by native English speakers who wish to show they are sympathetic to Latin Americans, and/or when translating texts into English. The practice can also be found in Mexico, even though Mexico is normally considered part of North America. A Canadian may sometimes be described as 'un norteamericano de Canada' (a North American of Canada). See also use of the word American. **EU/Europe: Just as the terms 'America' and 'American' are frequently used to refer only to the United States and its people, the terms 'Europe' and 'European' are also frequently used to refer only to the European Union and its people, and this similarly sometimes causes resentment among some non-EU Europeans, although the enlargement of the EU means that there are now fewer non-EU Europeans left to take offence than there used to be when the EU was smaller. **Russia/Soviet Union: In this case the part (Russia) was (and still is) often used to refer to the whole (the Soviet Union). **Partitioned States: When a country is or was divided, the name of the whole is often used to refer to one of the parts, sometimes causing resentment in the other part. The name of the whole is usually used to refer to the larger part, such as 'Korea' for South Korea, and 'Germany' for the former West Germany. Sometimes the term is used to refer to the smaller part for political reasons, such as when the US refused to recognize the People's Republic of China, so that, at least officially, 'China' meant the Republic of China on Taiwan (with 'Red China' or 'Communist China' then being used to refer to the People's Republic of China). Sometimes giving the part the name of the whole is unofficial, and sometimes not. South Korea is officially the 'Republic of Korea', not 'Korea', though, as with many such official names, 'Republic of Korea' can be interpreted as meaning 'Republic of all Korea', and indeed West Germany was officially the 'Federal Republic of Germany', which eventually became the official name of all Germany after reunification in 1990. But 'Ireland' is the official name (in English) of the Republic of Ireland (both according to its Constitution and according to the European Union). Cyprus (officially the Republic of Cyprus) was accepted into the EU as a whole in 2004, although the EU legislation is suspended in the territory occupied by Turkey since 1974 (the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), recognised only by Turkey), until a final settlement of the Cyprus problem. ==See also== *Africanization *Animal name changes in Turkey *Decoloniality *Dual naming *Exonym and endonym *Hebraization of Palestinian place names *Indigenization *Geographic Names Information System *List of administrative division name changes *List of city name changes *List of Australian place names changed from German names *List of renamed cities and towns in Russia *List of double placenames *List of entities and changes in The World Factbook *List of places *List of politically motivated renamings *South African Geographical Names Council *Street sign theft *Toponymy *United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names *United States Board on Geographic Names ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== *Branford, Becky (26 May 2005). \"City names mark changing times\" at BBC News.
