While The Times of India giving three stars out of five, gave a positive review \"Though the story has nothing new to offer except the plot surrounding the vessel, the film manages to entertain, thanks to some of the comic scenes which are devoid of double-entendre. The background score, however, reminds us of music from a few other movies. The two songs do not add much value to the story but look vibrant on the screen. An unapologetically made fun film, this may appeal to those who love watching movies in this genre.\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \"...the writing is all over the place and the director seems to have other concerns. He wants to project his heroine as a \u201cmass\u201d star. She gets to do slo-mo walks. She gets to beat up many men. She gets to mouth lines delivered on screen by other \u201cmass\u201d heroes. All this simply kills the mood\". == References == ==External links== * Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:2019 action comedy films Category:Indian action comedy films Category:Indian black comedy films Category:2010s heist films Category:Indian heist films Category:Films scored by Vishal Chandrasekhar Category:2019 comedy films Category:2019 films ",
