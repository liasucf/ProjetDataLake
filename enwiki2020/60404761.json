    "text": "The Bull Site in the West Bank is an open air ancient cult installationBloch- Smith & Nakhai 1999, p. 76. from 12th century BCE Canaan, and is the find spot for the Bull statuette. The bronze Bull Statuette discovered at the 12th century BCE cult site at Dhahrat et-Tawileh, West Bank == Location == The site is located on the Dhahrat et-Tawileh ridge in the hills of the northern West BankMazar 1982, pp. 32-33. in the Jenin Governorate, 75 meters above the ancient roadDorsey 1991, pp. 144-145.Miller II 2003, p. 161. through the Zababdeh valleyZertal 2008, p. 29. between Dothan and Tirzah.Nakhai 2001, p. 170. It lies approximately 6 km south of Jenin, and 4 km east of Qabatiya. The site provides commanding views of other high points in northern Canaan including Mount Carmel, Mount Tabor, Mount Meron, Mount Gilboa, and Jebel Tamun.Mazar 1982, p. 33. Dhahrat et-Tawileh Ridge == Discovery == The site was discovered in 1977 by Ofer Broshi, a member of Kibbutz Shamir and soldier in the Israeli army, where he unearthed an ancient bull statuette. He brought the figurine back to his kibbutz where it was put on display with other antiquities owned by the kibbutz.Mazar 1982, p. 41.Mazar 1983, p. 34. While on display it was spotted by archaeologist Amihai Mazar who arranged its transfer to the Israel Museum where it is now part of the permanent collection. Based on Broshi's description Mazar was able to locate the find spot at Dhahrat et- Tawileh and begin excavations.Mazar 1983, pp. 34-35. == Excavation history == Two short excavations were conducted by Mazar in April 1978 and September 1981 on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Mazar 1993, pp. 266-267. Results of the excavation show that the site was single-phase (Iron IA)Mullins 2012, pp. 590-592.Faust 2006, p. 119. and was abandoned after only a short period of use.Ahlstr\u00f6m 1990, pp. 80-81. The archaeological evidence indicates the site's use as a cultic installationMazar 1983, pp. 35-36. though the flint and pottery assemblage discovered potentially indicates domestic use.Miller II 2005, p. 46. A dating of the site to the Middle Bronze AgeFinkelstein 1998, pp. 94-98. is based on a misreading of the pottery evidenceNa'aman 1994, pp. 167-169. and as such an early 12th century dating should be retained.Mazar 1999, pp. 144-148. == Cult installation == The Standing Stone at the Bull Site Though there are a number of Iron Age I settlements in the area,Khirbet Abu Ghamam, Khirbet Tanin, Khirbet Anahum, Khirbet esh-Sheik Seffrin, and esh-Zababde. See Mazar 1983, p. 36. the Bull Site lacks any evidence of settlement. Instead it sits on the summit of Dhahrat et-Tawileh and is thought to have served as a cult site for the surrounding settlements due to its hilltop location.Mazar 1983, p. 39. Built on bedrock in the 12th century, the site comprises a perimeter wall made from large boulders brought in from elsewhere,Zevit 2003, p. 233. and what is thought to be a standing stone or altar with a paved area in front of it next to the enclosure's eastern entrance.Mazar 1982, p. 34. Mazar, the excavation director, speculates that a sacred tree likely grew within the site's walls.Mazar 1982, p. 35.Mazar 1983, p. 37. There is no agreement on the ethnicity of the local settlers who used the site, with suggestions ranging from the Israelites due to the site's location in Mannaseh's tribal allotment,Mazar 1982, p. 38. Nakhai 1994, pp. 19-29.Joshua 17:1\u201313 the Canaanites,Coogan 1987, p. 1. or migrants from north of Canaan.Ahlstr\u00f6m 1990, p. 81. Alternative views are that the site could have been a home for a family and their animals, or an enclosure for livestock. == Bull statuette == The statuette, found close to the western wall of the site,Ahlstr\u00f6m 1990, p. 79. is of a Zebu bull measuring 17.5 cm long by 12.4 cm high and is made of bronze.Mazar 1982, p. 27. It is notable not only for its naturalistic ears and eyes, but for being the largest such bull statuette found in Israel. Though Mazar suggests it may be the product of a local Israelite craftsman, other scholars such as Ahlstr\u00f6m believe it came either from Galilee, or further north again above the land of Canaan. There is no consensus about which deity the statuette represents;Ahlstr\u00f6m 1990, p. 80. it could be an image of El,KTU 1.14:2:22\u201324 \"Raise your hands toward the sky. Sacrifice to Bull El, your Father.\" Smith & Parker 1997, p. 14.
