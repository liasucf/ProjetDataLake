The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama 1932\u20131960. A History Through Biography. Melbourne University Press. 1994 In the early 1950s, Lloyd could not get acting work. After a year of selling clothing door- to-door to survive, he left Australia to live the rest of his life in Britain. He donated a copy of his 1994 unpublished autobiography to the National Library of Australia. The book reveals that he was not satisfied with his personal or professional achievements, despite his obvious talents and successes. ===Early career in Australia=== Before his voice broke, Lloyd Lamble became \u2018head boy\u2019 in the choir of All Saints' Church St Kilda, Melbourne and that gained him a scholarship for Wesley College, Melbourne. His academic record was not outstanding, though he was a keen swimmer and gymnast. At the age of 17, Lamble became a junior radio announcer for Melbourne commercial radio station 3DB \u2013 a post he describes as \u2018little more than an office boy\u2019. Senior announcing jobs followed at 3KZ and 3AW. At this time he also did some dance-hall crooning. His professional stage career started in 1934 when he was chosen for the lead juvenile role in J.C. Williamson\u2019s production of Fresh Fields. Two years later he played the role of Danny, a psychotic murderous Welsh pageboy, in Night Must Fall. While he was still at 3AW, he began acting with the Lee Murray Radio Players and that established him as a radio actor. In lighter vein, he was straight man to Roy Rene (\u2018Mo\u2019) and a compere and fall guy to Bob Dyer. Lamble opened a successful school of radio and theatre acting in 1937: the \u2018Radio-Theatre Guild\u2019. Lloyd's stage career developed fast in 1940 at Sydney\u2019s Minerva Theatre, where he played parts that included: Malvolio in Twelfth Night, Lennie in Of Mice and Men and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. He played 12 stage parts in that year and 35 in the 16 years between 1934 and 1950. From 1936 to 1950 Lamble toured Australia and New Zealand as an actor and director. In 1944 he was leading man and producer in a six-play tour for J.C. Williamson\u2019s in New Zealand. In 1945 he formed his own short-lived performing company \u2013 \u2018L.L. Enterprises\u2019 \u2013 and took plays on tour in Queensland, Australia. Lloyd Lamble was well known in both the Australian Lux Radio Theatre and the Australian Macquarie Radio Theatre. His first play for Lux was in 1939. Soon he was highly sought-after by other radio stations including the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and later the British Broadcasting Corporation. In spite of Lloyd's political left-leanings, he was enlisted by the Australian government to read war propaganda on radio, probably for his strong voice that easily commanded authority. Lloyd Lamble wrote several radio dramas, one of which is in the National Archives of Australia.The Rabbit Habit \u2013 A Preoccupation with Procreation (Copyright registered 23 January 1942). In his autobiography, Lloyd says he later revised the work and renamed it A Couple of Charlies. In 1947, he won a Macquarie Award. ===Career in the UK=== One of Lamble's first acting roles in Britain was in 1952, playing in the comedy Curtain Up, alongside Margaret Rutherford and Robert Morley. Lamble had earlier toured with them in his native Australia.
