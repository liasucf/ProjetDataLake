This event is been celebrated by Sonowal Kacharis every two year in Dibrugarh, Assam. ==Origination== The origination of the Bohua dance is very old. It is known that Lord Shiva or Khring Raja Baithow is the main God of the Sonowal Kacharis. It is mentioned in the Bhagavad and other Puranic texts that Dakshya, the son of Lord Brahma was the king of Tribhuvan. It so happened that his youngest daughter Sati, whom he most dearly lovedfell in love with Lord Shiva when she was a teenager. But King Dakshya didn't want to give his dear daughter's hand to Lord Shiva, who was always nude, had no wealth and whose companions were ghosts and demons. But Lord Brahma ordered Dakshya to marry of his daughter to him and so he obeyed. One day Shiva went to visit Dakshya along with other guests. When Dakshya came to see them everyone except shiva greeted him! Angered by his dishonour, Dakshya promised himself to take revenge upon him. One day Dakshya decided to organise a Mahayajna only to take revenge upon Shiva. He invited Yamraj, all the demi gods and even the kings and queens. Everyone except lord Shiva was invited. When Shiva and Sati came to know about this, she immensely desired to visit her father's Mahayajna. after much reluctance shiva let her go. But when she reached her father's house, Dakshya ridiculed her in front of everyone. Unable to bear this ridicule from her father, Sati left her body on the Mahajagya. When this news reached Kailash, ghosts and demons appeared on the yajna to vandalized it. When lord Shiva arrived, a drop of sweat from his forehead fell on the ground and a warrior named Birbharda was created. This fearless warrior with the order of Shiva beheaded Dakshya! After this incident the wife of king Dakshya came crying to Shiva and begged him to restore her husband's life. The powerful Lord Shiva then put the head of a sacrificed goat in Dakshya's body and lo!. he was alive again! After his resurrection, the king and his queen danced in joy. Everyone praised the mighty Lord Shiva for his divine powers. The Sonowal Kacharis therefore performs the Bohua dance in praise of Lord Shiva. This dance signifies the beginning of a new life, a clean society and the riddance of bad omen. In this way Bohua danced has been performed for many generations.:as:\u09ac\u09b9\u09c1\u09f1\u09be \u09a8\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09af ==References== ==External links== * https://www.facebook.com/sonowalkachari009?fref=ts facebook page * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppCazW84S8k youtube * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtV5cre2xBg Category:Dances of Assam Category:Festivals in Assam ",
