    "text": "The Wesley Chapel Methodist Episcopal Church in Eldersburg, Maryland is a characteristic small church of the period (built ~1822), with uncoursed stone rubble construction and a simple plan. The interior is a single barrel-vaulted room. It was erected to serve one of the earliest Methodist congregations in Carroll County, and hence in the United States, as Carroll County was a birthplace of Methodism in America. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==References== ==External links== *, including photo in 2006, at Maryland Historical Trust Category:Eldersburg, Maryland Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Churches completed in 1821 Category:Churches in Carroll County, Maryland Category:Methodist churches in Maryland Category:History of Methodism in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carroll County, Maryland Category:Methodist Episcopal churches in the United States ",
