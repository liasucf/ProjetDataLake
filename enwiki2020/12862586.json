    "text": "Mickelia nicotianifolia is a species of fern in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Elaphoglossoideae. It has a widespread distribution in Central America and northern South America. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described by Olof Swartz in 1806 as Acrostichum nicotianifolium. It has since been placed in several other genera, including Mickelia. In 1995, Robbin C. Moran and Benjamin \u00d8llgaard described a new species from Ecuador as Bolbitis riparia. Under this name, it was considered to be endemic to Ecuador and threatened. However, in 2010, Moran et al. treated Bolbitis riparia as a synonym of Mickelia nicotianifolia, a widespread species. ==References== riparia Category:Ferns of the Americas Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
