In the first century BC, the Celts settle here and during Great Moravia period the Slavs arrive. The village was first mentioned in 1257. The original Slav population was outnumbered by German settlers in the Middle Ages. In the upheavals of 1945 the Germans were expelled and now the population is formed by Slovak settlers mainly from Pohorela and region of Gorals and also by Roma ethnic group. The well preserved romano-gothic church of Catherine of Alexandria was built in the 13th century and rebuilt in the 15th century. It has unique gothic wall frescoes discovered in the 1950s. The fresco \"King Ladislaus fighting the Cumans\" is considered one of the most valuable in Slovakia. == Golf course == In 2005 had been opened a nine holes golf course and a year later additional nine holes course circuit, so in 2012 has Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Lomnica altogether 18 holes course.
