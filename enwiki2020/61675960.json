Good Lookin' is an album by blues musician Bo Diddley released on the Checker label in 1965.Both Sides Now: Checker Album Discography (1957-1971) accessed August 27, 2019Bo Diddley Discography accessed August 26, 2019 ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Bruce Eder stated \"One of Bo Diddley's least- known albums ... at the point when none of his records were selling in America. With an edgy, raunchy sound and modern record techniques (it's in stereo), Diddley and band come up with a solid '60s version of his original sound. The title track is a real jewel... Other tracks sound like they'd have worked well as part of extended jams of the kind that Diddley did on-stage ... There is some filler here ... but that can be forgiven in view of the strength of the rest of the material.\". == Track listing == All tracks credited to Ellas McDaniel except where noted # \"Hey, Good Lookin'\" (Chuck Berry) \u2013 2:55 # \"Mush Mouth Millie\" \u2013 2:03 # \"Bo Diddley's Hootenanny\" \u2013 2:21 # \"London Stomp\" \u2013 2:15 # \"Let's Walk Awhile\" \u2013 2:38 # \"Rooster Stew\" \u2013 2:18 # \"La, La, La\" \u2013 2:30 # \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\" \u2013 2:30 # \"Rain Man\" \u2013 3:15 # \"I Wonder Why (People Don't Like Me)\" \u2013 3:35 # \"Brother Bear\" \u2013 2:20 # \"Mummy Walk\" \u2013 2:10 == Personnel == *Bo Diddley \u2013 vocals, guitar *The Dutchess \u2013 guitar *Lafayette Leake \u2013 piano *Chester Lindsey \u2013 bass *Edell Robertson \u2013 drums *Jerome Green \u2013 maracas *The Bo-Ettes \u2013 vocals == References == Category:1965 albums Category:Bo Diddley albums Category:Checker Records albums ",
