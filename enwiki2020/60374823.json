    "text": "The twentieth season of the One Piece anime series was produced by Toei Animation, and directed by Tatsuya Nagamine. The season began broadcasting in Japan on Fuji Television on July 7, 2019. On April 19, 2020, Toei Animation announced that the series would be delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; they would later schedule the series' return for June 28, 2020, resuming from episode 930. Like the rest of the series, this season follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates. The main story arc, called \"Wano Country\", adapts material from the rest of the 90th volume onwards. It deals with the alliance between the pirates, samurai, and minks to liberate Wano Country from the shogun, who has allied with the Beast Pirates led by Kaido. Episodes 895 and 896 contain an original story arc, \"Carbonic Acid King\" which ties into the movie One Piece: Stampede. Episode 907 is an adaptation of Oda's one-shot manga Romance Dawn, which features \"the story of a Luffy slightly different from the one in One Piece\". Two pieces of theme music are used for this season. From episodes 890 to 934, the first opening theme is by Hiroshi Kitadani. From episodes 935 onwards, the second opening is \"Dreamin' On\" by Da-ice. __TOC__ ==Episode list== ===\"Wano Country\"=== ===\"Carbonic Acid King\"=== ===\"Wano Country (cont.)\"=== ==Home releases== ===Japanese=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 98%;\" |+ Avex Pictures (Japan, Region 2/A) |- ! colspan=\"3\" | Volume !
