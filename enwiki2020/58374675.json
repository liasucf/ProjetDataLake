It is the third single from her third studio album, Look Up Child. ==Background== \"Rescue is probably one of the most personal songs on the record. It was written for someone close to me who was going through a difficult time. I want people to listen to this song and leave feeling that while they may be struggling, there are better times ahead. I've had some time to sing this song around the world and the way that it is connected with people is something that is so surreal. Still to this day, when I listen to this song, I will cry. That's the beauty of this song, that's why it's so personal, that's why it means so much.\" Daigle A Spanish version of the song titled \"Rescuta\" was released on May 15, 2020, alongside You Say, titled \"T\u00fa Dices\".
