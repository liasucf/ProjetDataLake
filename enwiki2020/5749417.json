    "text": "The Pore\u010dka River ( / Pore\u010dka reka, \"Pore\u010d River\") is a river in eastern Serbia, a 50 km-long right tributary to the Danube in the \u0110erdap gorge. It originates from two headstreams, the \u0160a\u0161ka and the Crnajka rivers, which meet at the village of Milo\u0161eva Kula. == Origin == The Crnajka river, the shorter but natural headstream, originates from the central west slopes of the Deli Jovan mountain, and flows to the north, next to the villages of Tanda and Crnajka, in the valley between the Deli Jovan to the east and Veliki Kr\u0161 and Mali Kr\u0161 mountains to the west. The \u0160a\u0161ka river, the longer headstream (17 km), originates from the northern slopes of the Li\u0161kovac mountain, under the mountain's highest peak, Veliki Li\u0161kovac, east of the town of Majdanpek. The river flows to the south, curving around the western side of the Li\u0161kovac mountain and the northern slopes of the Mali Kr\u0161 mountain, next to the oldest copper mine in Europe and once prosperous mining village of Rudna Glava. It meets the Crnajka in the narrow valley between the southern Li\u0161kovac and northern Deli Jovan mountains, at the village of Milo\u0161eva Kula, forming the Pore\u010dka river. == Pore\u010d == For the remaining 23 km the river flows under the name of Pore\u010dka river, diving in two the narrow valley and region of Pore\u010d (Serbian for land alongside the river or river valley). The river continues Crnajka's northerly direction between the mountains of Li\u0161kovac (on the west) and Veliki Greben (on the east). The major settlements on the river are the villages of Kloko\u010devac, Topolnica and Mosna, and the small town of Donji Milanovac (in medieval times also called Pore\u010d) near the river's mouth into the Danube in the \u0110erdap gorge. After the construction of the \u0110erdap hydro electrical dam, the river flows into the artificial lake \u0110erdap, and the flooded final section of the Pore\u010dka river today forms a small bay of the lake. The Pore\u010dka river drains an area of 538 km\u00b2, belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable. == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan \u0110.
