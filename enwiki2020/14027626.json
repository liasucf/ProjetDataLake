    "text": "Antonio Bruno was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. He was born in Modena or Correggio, and painted at Parma in the manner of Correggio, of whom, if not a pupil, he was a great imitator and contemporary, as one of his works is dated 1530. He painted a Madonna and Saints for the parish church in Santi Senesio e Teopompo, Castelvetro di Modena. Antonio Bruni refers to both a poet (1593\u20131635) from Apulia; and also a painter (1767\u20131825). ==References== * * Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Parmesan painters Category:Modenese painters Category:Italian Renaissance painters Category:People from Genoa Category:16th-century Italian people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
