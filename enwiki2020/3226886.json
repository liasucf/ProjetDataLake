    "text": "Fulfillingness' First Finale is a 1974 album by Stevie Wonder; widely considered one of the albums from his \"classic period\". Released on July 22, 1974, on the Tamla label, it is Wonder's nineteenth album overall, and seventeenth studio album. Subsequent to the epic sweep and social consciousness of Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale projected a reflective, decidedly somber tone. While masterly, the musical arrangements used in several songs could be considered sparse in comparison to others among his 1970s masterworks, especially in the bleak \"They Won't Go When I Go\" and understated \"Creepin. Though Fulfillingness' First Finale was largely a stripped down and more personal sounding record, Wonder had not completely foregone social commentary on the world around him. The Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"You Haven't Done Nothin'\" launched a pointed criticism of the Nixon administration bolstered by clavinet, drum machine, and a Jackson 5 cameo. Fulfillingness' First Finale was Wonder's first album to top the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it remained for two weeks. It also reached number one on the Billboard Soul LPs chart, spending nine non- consecutive weeks there. Fulfillingness' First Finale won three Grammy Awards at the 16th Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The album was voted number 413 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). It was also included in the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ==Reception== Fulfillingness' First Finale won Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal, Best Male Rhythm and Blues Vocal Performance (for \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\"), and Album of the Year in 1974. == Track listing == All songs written by Stevie Wonder, except where noted. ;Side One #\"Smile Please\" \u2013 3:28 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, background vocal, Fender Rhodes, drums #*Michael Sembello \u2013 electric guitar #*Reggie McBride \u2013 electric bass #*Bobbye Hall \u2013 congas, bongos #*Jim Gilstrap \u2013 background vocals #*Deniece Williams (credited as Denise) \u2013 background vocals #\"Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away\" \u2013 5:02 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, background vocal, Hohner clavinet, drums, Moog bass #*Paul Anka \u2013 background vocal #*Syreeta Wright \u2013 background vocal #*Shirley Brewer \u2013 background vocal #*Larry \"Nastyee\" Latimer \u2013 background vocal #\"Too Shy to Say\" \u2013 3:29 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, piano #*James Jamerson \u2013 acoustic bass #*Sneaky Pete Kleinow \u2013 pedal steel guitar #\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" \u2013 4:56 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, Fender Rhodes, piano, harmonica, drums, Moog bass #*Rocky Dzidzornu \u2013 congas #\"Creepin'\" \u2013 4:22 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, background vocal, Fender Rhodes, harmonica, drums, Moog bass, T.O.N.T.O. synthesizer #*Minnie Riperton \u2013 background vocal ;Side Two #\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\" \u2013 3:23 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, Hohner clavinet, bass drum, hi-hat, cymbal #*Reggie McBride \u2013 electric bass #*The Jackson 5 \u2013 background vocals #*Robert Margouleff and Malcolm Cecil \u2013 synthesizers #*Horns, drum machine \u2013 uncredited #\"It Ain't No Use\" \u2013 4:01 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, background vocal, Fender Rhodes, drums, Moog bass #*Lani Groves \u2013 background vocal #*Minnie Riperton \u2013 background vocal #*Deniece Williams \u2013 background vocal #\"They Won't Go When I Go\" (Wonder, Yvonne Wright) \u2013 5:58 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, background vocal, piano, T.O.N.T.O. synthesizer #*Bob and Malcolm - programming Moog #\"Bird of Beauty\" \u2013 3:48 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, Fender Rhodes, Hohner clavinet, drums, percussions, Moog bass #*Bobbye Hall \u2013 cu\u00edca #*Shirley Brewer \u2013 background vocal #*Lani Groves \u2013 background vocal #*Deniece Williams \u2013 background vocal #*Sergio Mendes - Portuguese lyrics\"Bird of Beauty\" partial Portuguese lyrics provided by Sergio Mendes #*Drum machine - uncredited #\"Please Don't Go\" \u2013 4:07 #*Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, piano, Fender Rhodes, harmonica, handclaps, drums, hi-hat, Moog bass #*Michael Sembello \u2013 acoustic guitar #*The Persuasions \u2013 background vocal #*Shirley Brewer \u2013 background vocal #*Deniece Williams \u2013 background vocal == Selected cover versions == * \"Too Shy to Say\" - recorded by Diana Ross in 1978. * \"Too Shy to Say\" - George Michael performed the song in his Faith Tour. * \"Creepin'\" - Recorded by Luther Vandross for The Night I Fell in Love in 1985. * \"They Won't Go When I Go\" - recorded by George Michael for Listen Without Prejudice, Vol 1 in 1990. * \"They Won't Go When I Go\" - recorded by Kevin Max for The Blood in 2007. * \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" - covered that same year by Jamaican reggae singer Pat Rhoden, released as a single only in the UK, produced by Webster Shrowder. * \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" - recorded by Stanley Turrentine on his 1987 album Wonderland. * \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" - recorded by Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders on Legion of Mary: The Jerry Garcia Collection, Vol. 1. * \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" - regularly performed live by Phish and featured on Hampton Comes Alive (1999), among other concert recordings. * \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" - recorded by Marcus Miller on Silver Rain in 2005. * \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" - recorded by Vulfpeck, featuring singer Antwaun Stanley in 2015 * \"You Haven't Done Nothing\" - recorded by Curumin for Achados e Perdidos in 2005. == Charts == ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=2|1974 |Soul Albums | style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|1 |- |Top LP's & Tape |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Single !Billboard Hot 100 !Billboard Hot Soul Singles |- |rowspan=2|1974 |\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\" |style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\" |style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ==See also== *List of number-one albums of 1974 (U.S.) *List of number-one R&B; albums of 1974 (U.S.) ==References== ==External links== * Hughes, Tim.
