    "text": "A government bill is a bill which is proposed, introduced or supported by a government in their country's legislature. It is most significant in the Westminster system where most bills are introduced by the government. This is in contrast to private member's bills which are introduced by members of the legislature whom are not part of the executive or cabinet. Government bills are usually public bills and are often introduced into the chamber of government (in a bicameral system) where there are the most ministers. In the UK, forthcoming government bills are often listed in the Queen's Speech, a speech from the throne which precedes each session of Parliament. ==See also== *Private bill *Private member's bill *Public bill ==References== Category:Westminster system Category:Proposed laws Category:Statutory law Category:Legislatures ",
