    "text": "The Trial of Mary Dugan (Spanish:El proceso de Mary Dugan; French:Le proc\u00e8s de Mary Dugan) is a 1931 American drama film directed by Marcel De Sano and Gregorio Mart\u00ednez Sierra and starring Jos\u00e9 Crespo, Adrienne D'Ambricourt and Juan de Landa. It is based on Bayard Veiller's play The Trial of Mary Dugan. The film is a Spanish-language version of the 1929 hit The Trial of Mary Dugan. It was decided by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to remake the film for the Spanish market rather than subtitle or dub it as it contained long periods of static talking during the courtroom scenes.Jarvinen p.45 French and German versions were also made. The film re-used the sets designed by Cedric Gibbons for the original 1929 film. ==Cast== * Jos\u00e9 Crespo as Jimmy Dugan * Adrienne D'Ambricourt as Marie Ducrol * Juan de Landa as Insp.
