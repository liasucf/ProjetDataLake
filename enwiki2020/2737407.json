In 2010, B\u00fctikofer characterized his party as representing \u201ca certain lifestyle,\u201d noting that, mostly urbanized, many belong to the professions and are politically and socially engaged. \u201cThey sit on school boards. They are active in their churches or sports clubs. They support nongovernmental organizations,\u201d he said.Judy Dempsey (September 29, 2010), Greens in Germany Choose Path of Protest, Not Compromise International Herald Tribune. ===On public safety and civil liberties=== Under B\u00fctikofer\u2019s leadership, a two-year- long effort to negotiate a revised immigration law was abandoned by the Green Party in 2004, citing concerns about, among other things, that any regulations allowing easier detentions or expulsions of terror suspects would subvert Germany's civil rights protections.Richard Bernstein (May 5, 2004), German Security Plan Falters as Qaeda Suspect Faces Trial New York Times. ===On natural resources=== When the European Commission issued a strategy paper in 2010 which proposed pursuing more bilateral trade agreements and investing in infrastructure in Africa as a means to increase alternative sources of rare earth metals, hoping to break China\u2019s dominance of the market for the strategic minerals, B\u00fctikofer demanded an \u201cinnovative industrial policy that reduces the use of resources\u201d instead.Judy Dempsey (September 29, 2010), E.U. Seeks Strategy to Reduce Reliance on China for Rare Earths New York Times. ===On China=== When German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der announced in 2005 his intentions to lift an arms embargo on China that had been in place since the crackdown on student-led opposition demonstrators near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, B\u00fctikofer opposed the plan and instead called for a joint approach together with the United States.Richard Bernstein (April 1, 2005), Schr\u00f6der adamant on Chinese embargo International Herald Tribune.
