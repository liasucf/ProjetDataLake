    "text": "The Battle of Vilnius was a battle which took place on 16 April 1702 in Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, during the Great Northern War. After having seen the city early seized by the Swedish army, the grand notary of Lithuania, Ludwik Konstanty Pociej launched a surprise attack with 3,000 men, although some sources state as few as 2,000 and others 4,000 men. They were equally matched by the Swedes with 3,000 men under Carl Gustav M\u00f6rner stationed inside the city,Sliesori\u016bnas (2009), p. 81 although due to intense sickness it was realistically closer to 2,500. The Dala regiment alone had only 740 men prior to the battle in comparison to its original strength of 1,200.Loe (2012), p. 42 The attack was repulsed and the Polish-Lithuanian army had to withdraw with a loss of 100 men killed and two cannons lost while the Swedes lost 50 men killed in the action.Sliesori\u016bnas (2009), p. 83 The city remained in Swedish control until M\u00f6rner left it with his army in order to reinforce Charles XII in his battle against Agustus. It was later recaptured by the Swedish general Carl Gustaf D\u00fccker in 1706. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * Vilnius 1702 Vilnius 1702 Vilnius 1702 Vilnius 1702 Category:History of Vilnius ",
