    "text": "The Lady of Shalott by John Atkinson Grimshaw (c. 1875) \"The Lady of Shalott\" is a lyrical ballad by the English poet Alfred Tennyson. Based on the medieval La Damigella di Scalot, it tells the tragic story of Elaine of Astolat, a young noblewoman imprisoned in a tower up the river from Camelot. One of the poet's best-known works, its vivid medieval romanticism and enigmatic symbolism inspired many painters, especially the Pre-Raphaelites and their followers. Like his other early poems \u2013 \"Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere\" and \"Galahad\" \u2013 the poem recasts Arthurian subject matter loosely based on medieval sources. Tennyson wrote two versions of the poem, one published in 1833, of 20 stanzas, the other in 1842, of 19 stanzas. The revised version has a significantly different ending. This revision was designed to match Victorian morals regarding gender norms and the act of suicide. ==Origin== The poem is loosely based on the Arthurian legend of Elaine of Astolat, as recounted in a 13th-century Italian novellina titled La Damigella di Scalot (No. LXXXII in the collection Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike)Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike; the earlier version is closer to the source material than the latter. Tennyson focused on the Lady's \"isolation in the tower and her decision to participate in the living world, two subjects not even mentioned in Donna di Scalotta.\" ==Poem== The first four stanzas of the 1842 poem describe a pastoral setting. The Lady of Shalott lives in an island castle in a river which flows to Camelot, but the local farmers know little about her. Stanzas five to eight describe the lady's life. She suffers from a mysterious curse and must continually weave images on her loom without ever looking directly out at the world. Instead, she looks into a mirror, which reflects the busy road and the people of Camelot who pass by her island. The reflected images are described as \"shadows of the world\", a metaphor that makes it clear they are a poor substitute for seeing directly (\"I am half-sick of shadows\"). The Lady of Shalott by William Maw Egley (1858) Stanzas nine to twelve describe \"bold Sir Lancelot\" as he rides by and is seen by the lady. The remaining seven stanzas describe the effect on the lady of seeing Lancelot; she stops weaving and looks out of her window toward Camelot, bringing about the curse. She leaves her tower, finds a boat upon which she writes her name, and floats down the river to Camelot. She dies before arriving at the palace. Among the knights and ladies who see her is Lancelot, who thinks she is lovely. ==Themes== According to scholar Anne Zanzucchi, \"in a more general sense, it is fair to say that the pre-Raphaelite fascination with Arthuriana is traceable to Tennyson's work\". Tennyson's biographer Leon\u00e9e Ormonde finds the Arthurian material is \"Introduced as a valid setting for the study of the artist and the dangers of personal isolation\". Feminist critics see the poem as concerned with issues of women's sexuality and their place in the Victorian world. Critics argue that \"The Lady of Shalott\" centres on the temptation of sexuality and her innocence preserved by death. Christine Poulson discusses a feminist viewpoint and suggests: \"the Lady of Shalott's escape from her tower as an act of defiance, a symbol of female empowerment.\" Based on Poulson's view, escaping from the tower allows for the Lady of Shalott to emotionally break free and come into terms with female sexuality. The Lady of Shalott by Walter Crane (1862) The depiction of death has also been interpreted as sleep. Poulson says that sleep has a connotation of physical abandonment and vulnerability, which can either suggest sexual fulfillment or be a metaphor for virginity. Fairy tales, such as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, have traditionally depended upon this association. So, as related to the Lady of Shalott, Poulson says: \"for in death [she] has become a Sleeping Beauty who can never be wakened, symbols of perfect feminine passivity.\" Critics such as Hatfield have suggested that \"The Lady of Shalott\" is a representation of how Tennyson viewed society; the distance at which other people are in the lady's eyes is symbolic of the distance he feels from society. The fact that she sees them only reflected through a mirror signifies the way in which Shalott and Tennyson see the world\u2014in a filtered sense. This distance is therefore linked to the artistic licence Tennyson often wrote about. ==Cultural influence== ===Art=== Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of \"Immortals\", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including Keats and Tennyson. \"The Lady of Shalott\" was particularly popular with the Brotherhood, which shared Tennyson's interest in Arthuriana; several of the Brotherhood made paintings based on episodes from the poem. Two aspects, in particular, of \"The Lady of Shalott\" intrigued these artists: the idea of the lady trapped in her tower and the dying girl floating down the river towards Camelot. William Holman Hunt's The Lady of Shalott, c. 1888-1905 In Edward Moxon's 1857 edition of Tennyson's works, illustrated by Hunt and Rossetti, Hunt depicted the moment when the Lady turns to see Lancelot. In the background of the illustration, Hunt juxtaposes the window facing Lancelot with a painting of Christ's crucifixion. According to Christine Poulson, the Crucifixion is the archetype of self-sacrifice and further emphasises the ideal that the Lady of Shalott fails to represent. Poulson also considers this representation of the subject in the context of changing women's roles in the 1880s and 1890s, suggesting that it served as a warning of imminent death to women who stepped from their restricted roles and explored their desires. Rossetti depicted Lancelot's contemplation of the Lady's \"lovely face\". Neither illustration pleased Tennyson, who took Hunt to task for depicting the Lady caught in the threads of her tapestry, something which is not described in the poem. Hunt explained that he wanted to sum up the whole poem in a single image, and that the entrapment by the threads suggested her \"weird fate\". The scene fascinated Hunt, who returned to the composition at points throughout his life and finally painted a large scale version shortly before his death. He required assistants, as he was too frail to complete it himself. This deeply conceived evocation of the Lady, ensnared within the perfect rounds of her woven reality, is an apt illustration of the mythology of the weaving arts. This work is now in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut. The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse, 1888 John William Waterhouse painted three episodes from the poem. In 1888, he painted the Lady setting out for Camelot in her boat; this work is now in the Tate Gallery. In 1894, Waterhouse painted the Lady at the climactic moment when she turns to look at Lancelot in the window in The Lady of Shalott Looking at Lancelot; this work is now in the City Art Gallery in Leeds. Poulson argues that Waterhouse's impressionistic painting style in his 1894 rendering of The Lady of Shalott evokes a \"sense of vitality and urgency\". In 1915, Waterhouse painted I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott, as she sits wistfully before her loom; this work is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario. ===Literature=== * The poem is alluded to in Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), when Sibyl Vane says, \"I have grown sick of shadows.\" * Elizabeth Bishop's poem \"The Gentleman of Shalott\" (1946) describes a man who imagines his body is half object and half reflection. * The Lady of Shalott is mentioned in Annie Fellows Johnston's \"Three Weavers\", a fairy tale embedded in chapter XIV of the children's book The Little Colonel at Boarding-School (1903). * Nancy Mitford refers to the Lady of Shalott in her novel Love in a Cold Climate (1949). * A character in Eric Frank Russell's novel Next of Kin (1959) quotes the poem. * Miss Jean Brodie, in Muriel Spark's novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), reads the poem out loud to her class. * Agatha Christie used the line \"The mirror crack'd from side to side\" as the title of her 1962 novel, in which the poem plays a large part in the plot. * The Lady of Shalott is referred to several times in Bel Kaufman's novel Up the Down Staircase (1965), particularly involving a suicide attempt. * Jessica Anderson uses the line \"'Tirra lirra,' by the river\" to title her novel Tirra Lirra by the River (1978). * Sharyn McCrumb's first published novel was a murder mystery titled Sick Of Shadows (1984). * Robin Klein uses the line \"All in the blue unclouded weather\" to title her short story collection All in the Blue Unclouded Weather (1991). * In Diana Wynne Jones' novel Hexwood (1993) one of the main characters, Ann Stavely, compares herself to the Lady of Shalott in that she uses a mirror to look outside her window. *The poem is quoted several times in Connie Willis' 1997 To Say Nothing of the Dog, and Ned Henry believes Verity Kindle looks like the Lady in the painting by John William Waterhouse. * Patricia A.

The recording was released in 2002. * Dutch gothic metal band Autumn also refer to the Lady of Shalott in the songs \"Who Has Seen Her Wave Her Hand\", \"Mirrors Magic Sights\", \"When Lust Evokes the Curse\", \"Floating Towards Distress\" and, arguably \"Behind the Walls of Her Desire\" from their 2002 album When Lust Evokes the Curse. Each song retelling parts of the story from the poem. * The song titled \"Shalott\" on Emilie Autumn's 2006 album Opheliac tells the poem from her own perspective, where she quotes the Lady of Shalott as saying \"But then, I could have guessed it all along, 'cause now some drama queen is gonna write a song for me.\" She uses imagery from the poem, and quotes it directly: \"I'm half sick of shadows\". * Swedish pop band The Cardigans refer to the poem with the line 'Mirror cracked from side to side' in a bonus track on the UK edition of Super Extra Gravity, entitled \"Give Me Your Eyes\". * Danish Composer Bent S\u00f8rensen composed a piece for viola solo, based on John William Waterhouse's painting The Lady of Shalott at the Tate Gallery in London. The work has been also transcribed for solo violin and recorded by Dacapo Records, 8.226134. * The Band Perry's country music video \"If I Die Young\" makes clear visual references to the \"Lady of Shalott\". Lead vocalist Kimberly Perry holds a book of poems by Tennyson as she lies in a boat, floating down a river like the Lady of Shalott. As her recumbent form within the boat drifts downstream, Perry sings: 'Sink me in the river, at dawn / Send me away with the words of a love song'. The boat in the Perry video is similar to some illustrations of the poem, such as the image by W. E. F. Britten. The very last scene of the video shows a close-up of two pages of the poem. ===Television=== * Read aloud in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs titled \"The Understudy\" (1975). * A portion of the poem is quoted by Guy Burgess (Alan Bates) in the 1983 BBC film An Englishman Abroad. * In the 1985 television adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables, Anne Shirley (Megan Follows) reads various stanzas of the poem and acts out the Lady of Shalott's tragic end as she floats down the river; lines from Tennyson's \"Lancelot and Elaine\" are also referred to. In the book, the poem enacted is consistently \"Lancelot and Elaine\". *In Episode 1 of the 1995 BBC production of The Buccaneers, Laura Testvalley (Cheire Lunghi) reads part of it to Annabel St. George (Carla Gugino). \"The Lady of Shalott\" does not appear in the original book by Edith Wharton. * In the Lewis episode \"Old, Unhappy, Far Off Things\" (2011), D.S.
