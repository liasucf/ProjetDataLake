Nickel Family Nature and Wildlife Preserve, located in Cherokee County, Oklahoma is privately owned and managed by the Oklahoma Nature Conservancy. The preserve contains of forest and grassland. Spring-fed creeks meander amid a rugged topography of steep slopes and narrow valleys harboring a mosaic of oak-hickory forest, lofty pine woodland, and a diverse mix of savanna, shrubland, and prairie.

Elevations on the refuge range from to .Delorme, Topo USA, 6.0 The preserve was founded in 2000 due to a land gift from the John Nickel family. It is the largest privately owned conservation area in the Ozark Mountains. Most of the Preserve is forested with oak and pine trees mixed with tallgrass prairie. Through controlled burns, The Nature Conservancy helps re-create the open woodland and biological diversity that characterized this region in pre- settlement days. There are seven vegetation zones: Xeric (dry) forests; Mesic (moist) forests; floodplains, glades, tallgrass prairie, wetlands, and disturbed areas. A total of 597 plant species have been found on the Preserve, including 15 rare, endangered or threatened plant species.\u201cThe vascular flora of the J. T.

The Nature Conservancy has introduced Elk which have been absent from the Ozarks for more than 150 years. White tailed deer, coyote, bobcat, and many small mammals are also common in the preserve and black bears now make their home on the preserve after being absent for over a century. ==Bathtub Rocks== Bathtub Rocks is an area owned by the Nature Conservancy that lies within the J.T. Nickel Family Nature and Wildlife Preserve. Cold, fresh water flows over the rocks from a nearby spring before draining into Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Illinois River. The rocks can be visited by the public, and are accessible from any of three trails in the Nickel Preserve. In the last few years vandalism and littering have become more than a nuisance in this area, costing the Nature Conservancy scarce funds to try to keep the area clean for visitors. The Conservancy has even hinted that it may have to close Bathtub Rocks, if this willful and negligent activity continues.\"Bathtub Rocks.\"\"Bathtub Rocks at J.T.
