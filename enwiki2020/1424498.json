    "text": "Andalusian classical music (, trans. \u1e6darab andalusi, ) or Andalusi music is a genre of music originally developed in al-Andalus by the Moors then into different styles across the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya) after the Expulsion of the Moriscos. It originated in the music of Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) between the 9th and 15th centuries. Some of its poems derive from famous authors such as Al-Shushtari, Ibn al-Khatib and Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. ==Origins== Andalusian classical music was allegedly born in the Emirate of Cordoba (Al-Andalus) in the 9th century. Born and raised in Iraq, Ziry\u00e2b (d. 857), who later became court musician of Abd al-Rahman II in Cordoba, is sometimes credited with its invention. Later, the poet, composer, and philosopher Ibn Bajjah (d. 1139) of Saragossa is said to have combined the style of Ziry\u00e2b with Western approaches to produce a wholly new style that spread across Iberia and North Africa. By the 10th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to Provence, influencing French troubadours and trouv\u00e8res and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. The English words lute, rebec, guitar, and naker derive from the Arabic oud, rabab, qithara and naqareh, although some Arabic terms (qithara, for example) had been derived in their turn from Vulgar Latin, Greek and other languages like Persian. Mass resettlements of Muslims and Sephardi Jews from Cordoba, Sevilla, Valencia, and Granada, fleeing the Reconquista, further expanded the reach of Andalusian music, though not without changes. In North Africa, the Andalusian music traditions all feature a suite known as a n\u016bba (colloquial Arabic from the formal Arabic nawba: a \"turn\" or opportunity to perform), an idea which may have originated in Islamic Iberia, but took on many different forms in the new environments. Moreover, these migrants from the 13th century on encountered ethnic Andalusian communities that had migrated earlier to North Africa, which helped this elite music to take root and spread among wider audiences. In his book Jews of Andalusia and the Maghreb on the musical traditions in Jewish societies of North Africa, Ha\u00efm Zafrani writes: \"In the Maghreb, the Muslims and Jews have piously preserved the Spanish-Arabic music .... In Spain and Maghreb, Jews were ardent maintainers of Andalusian music and the zealous guardians of its old traditions ....\" Indeed, as in so many other areas of Andalusian culture and society, Jews have played an important role in the evolution and preservation of the musical heritage of al-Andalus throughout its history. From the very beginning, one of Ziry\u0101b's colleagues at the court of \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n II was a fine musician Man\u1e63\u016br al-Yah\u016bd\u012b (\"Mansur the Jew\"). The scholars Avraham Elam-Amzallag and Edwin Seroussi further highlight the important role played by Jews in the history of Andalusian music, pointing out that not only have many important North African Andalusian musicians been Jews, but also Moroccan Jewish communities today in Israel preserve Andalusian melodies and even song texts in their religious music.Elam-Amzallag, Avraham (1997) \"La ala andalouse chez les Juifs et les Arabes du Maroc\" in Relations Jud\u00e9o-Musulmanes au Maroc: Perceptions et R\u00e9alit\u00e9s, edited by Robert Assaraf and Michel Abitbol. Statvit. pp. 295-302. A number of old manuscripts preserve song texts and elements of Andalusian musical philosophy. The oldest surviving collection of these texts is found in two chapters from A\u1e25mad al-T\u012bf\u0101sh\u012b's al- Mut\u02bfat al-asm\u0101\u02bf f\u012b \u02bfilm al-m\u016bs\u012bq\u0101 wa-l-sam\u0101\u02bf (ca. 1253).Edited by al-\u1e6canj\u012b in Al-Abhath 21 (1968). See footnote 2 above. More recent is a document entitled, al-\u02bfAdhar\u0101 al-m\u0101\u02beis\u0101t f\u012b-l-azj\u0101l wa-l-muwashsha\u1e25\u0101t (\"The Virgins Swaying for Zajals and Muwashsha\u1e25s\"), which probably dates to the middle of the 15th century and seems to be linked to the Andalusian music of Tlemcen in Algeria. By far the best-documented Andalusian tradition is that of Morocco, with the first surviving anthology having been produced by Mu\u1e25ammad al-B\u016b\u02bfi\u1e63\u0101m\u012b (d. ca. 1738). But the most important collection was Kunn\u0101sh al-\u1e24\u0101\u02beik (the first of several versions is dated 1202/1788), which was revised by the waz\u012br al-J\u0101mi\u02bf\u012b in 1886 (numerous copies are found in libraries in Morocco, Madrid, London and Paris). Each of the modern nations of North Africa has at least one style of Andalusian music. In Morocco the secular instrumental version is called Al- \u0100la, while the religious a cappella style is called al-sam\u0101\u02bf wa-l-madih. In Algeria there are three styles: al-Gharn\u0101\u1e6d\u012b (referring to Granada) in the west, al-\u1e63an\u02bfa in the region around Algiers, and al-m\u0101l\u016bf in the east. The Tunisian and Libyan traditions are also called al-m\u0101l\u016bf, as well.(footnote 12) ==The music today== A suite form called the Andalusi nubah forms the basis of al-\u0101la. Though it has roots in al-Andalus, the modern n\u016bba is probably a North African creation. Each n\u016bba is dominated by one musical mode. It is said that there used to be twenty-four n\u016bb\u0101t linked to each hour of the day, but in Algeria there are only sixteen, and in Morocco eleven have survived (although some n\u016bb\u0101t in Morocco incorporate more than one mode\u201424 modes in all).See Davila (2013) p. 325. N\u016bba structures vary considerably among the various national traditions. In Morocco, each n\u016bba is divided into five parts called m\u00eez\u00e2n, each with a corresponding rhythm. The rhythms occur in the following order in a complete n _u_ ba (though an entire n\u016bba is never performed in one sitting): #bas\u00eet (6/4) #q\u00e2'im wa ni\u1e63f (8/4) #bt\u00e2yh\u00ee (8/4) #darj (4/4) #qudd\u00e2m (3/4 or 6/8) Andalusian classical music orchestras are spread across the Maghreb, including the cities of: * Algeria: Tlemcen, Nedroma, Cherchell, Algiers, Bejaia, Blida, Constantine, Annaba, Souk Ahras, Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s, Oran, Kol\u00e9a, Blida, Mostaganem **In Algeria, three main styles or schools are to be found: ***The Gharnati of the region of Tlemcen. ***The of the region of Algiers. ***The Ma'luf style in the east of the country in Constantine and Annaba. * Morocco: Fes, Meknes, Tetuan, Sal\u00e9, Oujda, Rabat, Tangiers, Chefchaouen, Safi **The Al-\u0100la, meaning \"instrumental music\", as opposed to religious music which is primarily vocal is predominant. **The al-sam\u0101\u02bf wa-l- madih, a religious a cappella style that makes use of very similar melodic, rythmic and textual materials as Al-Ala. **The Gharnati of the school of Tlemcen is also played, mainly, in Oujda. * Tunisia: Tunis, Testour, and Kairouan. * Libya: Tripoli **In Tunisia and Libya, the Ma'luf is the main style. * Outside of the Maghreb exists the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra, that plays classical Andalusian music together with piyyutim from the tradition of Sephardi Jews. They use instruments including oud (lute), rabab (rebec), darbouka (goblet drums), taarija (tambourine), qan\u00fan (zither), and kamanja (violin). More recently, other instruments have been added to the ensemble, including piano, contrabass, cello, and even banjos, saxophones, and clarinets, though these are rare. ==Influence of Andalusian music== Andalusia was probably the main route of transmission of a number of Near-Eastern musical instruments used in European music: the lute from the oud, rebec from the rebab, the guitar from qitara and Greek kithara, and the naker from the naqareh. Further terms fell into disuse in Europe: adufe from al-duff, alboka from al-buq, anafil from al-nafir, exabeba from al-shabbaba (flute), atabal (bass drum) from al-tabl, atambal from al-tinbal, the balaban, sonajas de az\u00f3far from , the conical bore wind instruments, and the from the sulami or fistula (flute or musical pipe). Most scholars believe that Guido of Arezzo's Solf\u00e8ge musical notation system had its origins in a Latin hymn, but others suggest that it may have had andalusian origins instead. According to Meninski in his Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum (1680), Solf\u00e8ge syllables may have been derived from the syllables of an Arabic (moorish) solmization system Durar Mufa\u1e63\u1e63al\u0101t (\"Separated Pearls\"). However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory, and no Arabian musical manuscripts employing sequences from the Arabic alphabet are known to exist. Henry George Farmer believes that there is no firm evidence on the origins of the notation, and therefore the Arabian origin theory and the hymnal origin theories are equally credible. Although the philosopher al-Kind\u012b (d. 259/874) and the author Ab\u016b l-Faraj al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (d. 355/967) both mention music writing systems, they were descriptive and based on lute fingerings, and thus complicated to use. No practical, indigenous system of music writing existed in the islamic world before the colonial era. Some scholars have speculated that the troubadour tradition was brought to France from al-Andalus by the first recorded troubadour, William IX of Aquitaine (d. 1126), whose father had fought in the siege and sack of Barbastro in 1064 and brought back at least one female slave singer. It is likely that young William's taste in music and poetry was thus influenced by al-Andalus. George T. Beech observes that while the sources of William\u2019s inspirations are uncertain, he did have Spanish individuals within his extended family, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak Arabic. Regardless of William's involvement in the tradition's creation, Magda Bogin states that Andalusian poetry was likely one of several influences on European \u201ccourtly love poetry\u201d. J.B. Trend has also asserted that the poetry of troubadours was connected to Andalusian poetry. ==See also== *Malhun *Andalusi nubah *Mohammed al-Haik *Abdessadeq Cheqara *Mohamed Bajeddoub *Music of Algeria *Music of Morocco *Music of Tunisia *Music of Libya ==References== ==Bibliography== *Benmoussa, Abdelfattah (2003) al-M\u016bs\u012bq\u0101 l-andalusiyya \"al-\u0100la\": al-ma\u1e63\u0101dir wa al-mad\u0101ris.
