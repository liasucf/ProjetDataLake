    "text": "2-Octanol (octan-2-ol, 2-OH) is a fatty alcohol. It is a secondary eight- carbon chiral compound. 2-Octanol is a colorless liquid that is poorly soluble in water but soluble in most organic solvents. 2-Octanol can be a biobased alternative of 2-ethylhexanol and its derivates in numerous applications. == Manufacturing == Cleavage of ricinoleic acid produces a mixture of 2-octanol and sebacic acid ((CH2)8(CO2H)2). == Uses== 2-Octanol is mainly used as: * FlavorFenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients, Fifth Edition George A.
