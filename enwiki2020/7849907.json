    "text": "Prisoner Visitation and Support is a non-profit organization based in Philadelphia. PVS visitors visit prisoners in the United States Federal Prison system and Military prisons. They offer companionship and friendship, with no religious or other agenda. Their particular focus is prisoners who don't receive regular visits, are facing long sentences, and/or are in solitary confinement.https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2019/0107/In- the-Quaker-tradition-this-man-helps-volunteers-connect-with-prisonersLevad, Amy. Redeeming a Prison Society: A Liturgical and Sacramental Response to Mass Incarceration. United States: Fortress Press, 2014. PVS visitors come from a variety of religious and non-religious backgrounds, and the organization is supported by a wide variety of religious groups. Prisoner Visitation and Support was founded in 1968 by long-time prison visitors and activists Fay Honey Knopp and Bob Horton in part as a support to conscientious objectors in the Federal system. As the Vietnam era ended and conscientious objectors were released, the group's mission expanded to embrace all federal and military prisoners in need of support and visitation. == References == ==External links== *Prisoner Visitation and Support (PVS) official web site Category:Prisons in the United States Category:Prison-related organizations ",
