The scenario gives good ground for an experienced team of proven ability, but will be a very hard task for novices.\" William A. Barton reviewed The Ruins of Chicago in The Space Gamer No. 72. Barton commented that \"for a team of veteran TMP players, The Ruins of Chicago can prove a most challenging and worthwhile roleplaying experience.\" ==Reviews== *Different Worlds #34 (May/June, 1984) ==References== Category:The Morrow Project adventures ",
