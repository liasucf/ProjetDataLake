    "text": "Lithospermum is a genus of plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. The genus is distributed nearly worldwide, but most are native to the Americas and the center of diversity is in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Species are known generally as gromwells or stoneseeds. ==Taxonomy== There are about 50 to 60Cohen, J. I., (2012).

Some species, such as Lithospermum arvense, are sometimes classified in the genus Buglossoides, but that genus is subsumed into Lithospermum by works such as the Flora of China. In addition, a 2009 molecular study showed that the genus Onosmodium should be included within Lithospermum. Species include:GRIN Species Records of Lithospermum.

In southwestern North America, a species of this genus was used as a contraceptive by the Shoshone Native American tribe. == References == == External links == * Category:Boraginaceae genera ",
