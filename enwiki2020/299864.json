    "text": "Outside Inside is a 1983 album by The Tubes. It was the second album by the group to be released by Capitol Records. The album was produced by David Foster. The Tubes had their biggest radio hit with the single from this album, \"She's a Beauty\". Early US copies of the album used embossed lettering for the eye chart on the front cover. This made the lettering hard to read. A later version of the cover had the eye chart along with artist and title information printed in red and blue. There are 2 different versions of the song \"The Monkey Time\". The original included guest vocals from Martha Davis of The Motels. Other copies used a version with Davis' vocal replaced by Michele Gray. Gray was one of The Tubes principal dancers from 1983\u20131985, and later married frequent Tubes collaborator and producer Todd Rundgren. ==Track listing== ===Side 1=== #\"She's a Beauty\" (Foster, Waybill, Lukather) \u2013 4:01 #\"No Not Again\" (Tubes) \u2013 3:28 #\"Out of the Business\" (Tubes) \u2013 3:30 #\"The Monkey Time\" (Curtis Mayfield, Tubes) \u2013 3:54 #\"Glass House\" (Tubes) \u2013 3:31 ===Side 2=== #\"Wild Women of Wongo\" (Tubes) \u2013 3:57 #\"Tip of My Tongue\" (M.
