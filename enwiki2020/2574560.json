In Reading they were replaced by Raging Speedhorn who appeared much lower on the bill. A weekend ticket cost \u00a390, a day ticket was \u00a339. Reel Big Fish pulled out of Leeds for undisclosed reasons. Antipop Consortium cancelled their Dance Stage appearance after they disbanded earlier that month. Feeder were invited by Melvin Benn to headline the main stage on the first day at Reading and the second day at Leeds. They later turned this down, as they did not want to play such a high- profile slot so soon after the death of their drummer Jon Lee in January of that year. As a result, Feeder would instead headline the Radio 1 Evening Session Stage. ==2003== ===Main Stage=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Reading Friday || Reading Saturday || Reading Sunday |- |Leeds Saturday || Leeds Sunday || Leeds Friday |- | *Linkin Park *Blink-182 *Placebo *The Darkness *Staind *The Datsuns *Less Than Jake *Finch *Bowling for Soup *InMe || *Blur *Black Rebel Motorcycle Club *Beck *Doves *The Streets *The Libertines *Junior Senior *Cave In *The Sleepy Jackson || *Metallica *System of a Down *Sum 41 *Primal Scream *Good Charlotte *The Used *The All-American Rejects *Biffy Clyro *Sugarcult |} ===Radio 1 Stage=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Reading Friday || Reading Saturday || Reading Sunday |- |Leeds Saturday || Leeds Sunday || Leeds Friday |- | *The Polyphonic Spree *Elbow *Interpol *Electric Six *Ladytron *Mull Historical Society *Alien Ant Farm *OK Go *Saves the Day *Young Heart Attack *Violent Delight || *AFI *Hundred Reasons *The Cooper Temple Clause *The Mars Volta *The Thrills *The Kills *The Rapture *Jet *My Morning Jacket *Stellastarr *The Futureheads || *The Music *Yeah Yeah Yeahs *Grandaddy *Hot Hot Heat *Hell Is for Heroes *The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster *Radio 4 *The Raveonettes *Serafin *Kinesis *The Applicators |} ===Smirnoff Dance Arena=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Reading Friday || Reading Saturday || Reading Sunday |- |Leeds Saturday || Leeds Sunday || Leeds Friday |- | *Death in Vegas *Richard Fearless *Blackalicious *DM & Jemini *Amon Tobin *Scissor Sisters *Buck 65 *My Computer || *2 Many DJs *Audio Bullys *Adam F *The Spooks *Photek *Free*land *Gold Chains *Outlandish *Majesticons *Zongamin || *Futureshock *Lamb *Mixologists and MC Trip *Squarepusher *Aphrodite *Just Jack *FC Kahuna *Blak Twang *Fat Truckers |} ===The Concrete Jungle Stage=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Reading Saturday |- |Leeds Sunday |- | *Pennywise *Lagwagon *The Ataris *Alkaline Trio *Mad Caddies *Turbonegro *Boysetsfire *The Movielife *Poison the Well *Thrice *King Prawn *Funeral for a Friend |} ===Carling stage=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Reading Friday || Reading Saturday || Reading Sunday |- |Leeds Saturday || Leeds Sunday || Leeds Friday |- | *Evan Dando *Sparta *The Black Keys *Mclusky *The Hiss *Vue *Jackson *Bell X1 *Rocket Science *Razorlight *Franz Ferdinand *Billy Talent *The Blueskins *Colour of Fire || *Billy Bragg *Brendan Benson *The Bandits *The Buff Medways *Soledad Brothers *The Sights *The Sons *Ima Robot *The Revs *The Sun *Whirlwind Heat *The Go *The Agenda *The Real || *British Sea Power *Manitoba *Hope of the States *Har Mar Superstar *Longview *Calla *Instruction *Winnebago Deal *The Stills *Keane *White Light Motorcade *Cardia *The Prosaics |} ===Notes=== Black Rebel Motorcycle Club played as a replacement for The White Stripes, who pulled out after Jack White was in a car crash with his then-girlfriend, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. Although they played second on the Main Stage, it was billed as with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, reflecting their smaller status. Jay-Z also pulled out, with The Darkness moving further up the bill to replace him. The Libertines were without Pete Doherty, who was at that time estranged from the band; he also missed their 2004 appearance. Other drop outs included Courtney Love, Lostprophets and Godsmack.

Crystal Fighters was announced as their replacement. G Flip, who was also due to perform on the Festival Republic Stage, also pulled out of the festivals for unknown reasons. UK drill rapper Loski has also been removed from the line-up. This may be because the rapper was arrested for being in possession with a firearm. Fellow UK drill rapper Unknown T was also removed after he was charged with murder and violent disorder after allegedly stabbing 20-year-old Steven Narvaez-Jara during a party. Geko was also supposed to perform on Radio 1Xtra Stage. It is unknown why he was removed. Brunswick who was also due to play on the Radio 1 Stage last year, was pulled from the line up again this year for unknown reasons. Two days before his performance at Leeds, Lil Uzi Vert pulled out of the festival for 'unforeseen circumstances'. Acts were pushed up, Yungblud and Mayday Parade swapped places, and SWMRS was upgraded from Festival Republic to the Main Stage. Comethazine and Masicka were replaced by DJ Grevious and M Huncho. King Princess was due to perform on the NME Stage, but had to pull out due to illness. Aitch was moved from the Radio 1Xtra tent, and took their slot. Drenge performed a secret slot on the BBC Introducing stage, Enter Shikari performed a secret acoustic slot on the same stage. This was the band's third set through the festival. Juice Wrld was scheduled to perform at Reading on the Friday of the festival but a minute before his scheduled appearance, the crew announced that he had been cancelled due to \"flight issues\". Blade Brown wasn't able to perform at Reading due to being stuck in traffic. ==2020== The 2020 Festival was cancelled for health concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
