    "text": "The 2020 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup was planned to be the 107th edition of the U.S. Open Cup, a knockout cup competition in American soccer. Atlanta United FC were the defending champions after defeating Minnesota United FC in the 2019 final. The competition was suspended on March 13, 2020, before the first round fixtures, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and later cancelled on August 17. ==Qualification== This edition was planned to feature 100 teams, including 62 professional sides\u2014both modern-era records. Entrants included the American clubs from across the soccer leagues system, with timing determined by league division. These include the 23 American clubs from Major League Soccer and clubs from the USL Championship and USL League One that are not owned or operated by an MLS team; MLS-affiliated clubs from these two leagues are eligible. Additionally, clubs from the National Independent Soccer Association (NISA), a sanctioned Division III league, were set to take part. This is the first time two professional leagues from the same tier have both competed in the tournament since 2017. USL League Two and the National Premier Soccer League qualified teams based on previous season standings. Quantity of teams is determined by U.S. Soccer. Local qualifying was done by tournament and held in 2019. It featured 88 mostly amateur teams representing 18 different states and the District of Columbia (21 different state soccer associations). 12 teams qualified out of this tournament. Finally, as with the previous year, the reigning champion of the National Amateur Cup, Newtown Pride FC, automatically qualify for the tournament proper. The 2020 edition of the U.S. Open Cup was planned to include a change in qualifying for professional teams. All Division II and Division III teams were to enter together in the second round, while Major League Soccer teams were planned to enter in the third and fourth rounds. The four 2020 CONCACAF Champions League qualifiers plus the four best American non-qualifiers in each 2019 MLS conference would enter in the fourth round; the remaining clubs would enter in the third round. The U.S. Open Cup was scheduled to begin in March 2020, its earliest calendar date since 1995. The final was scheduled to take place in either early August or late September. The earlier start would have overlapped with the NCAA soccer season, causing lower-division teams to be unable to field their full lineups; Reading United AC and Flint City Bucks, both of USL League Two, along with Midland-Odessa Sockers FC of the National Premier Soccer League, announced they would not take part in the tournament due to this reason. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#a6c059; text-align:center;\" | colspan=\"2\" | Enter in First Round | colspan=\"2\" | Enter in Second Round | Enter in Third Round | Enter in Round of 32 |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#a6c059; text-align:center;\" | colspan=\"2\" | Open Division | Division III | Division II | colspan=\"2\" | Division I |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#d6e2b3;\" | style=\"text- align:center | ANFEEU/USASA/USCS/USSSA 13 teams | style=\"text-align:center | NPSL/USL League Two 25 teams | style=\"text-align:center | NISA/USL League One 14 teams | style=\"text-align:center | USL Championship 25 teams | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"| MLS 23 teams |- valign=\"top\" | ;ANFEEU * Virginia United ;USASA * Cal FC * Christos FC * Louisiana Krewe FC * Miami United FC U23 * Nashville United * Newtown Pride FC (2019 NAC champion) * New York Pancyprian-Freedoms * NTX Rayados * Olympic Club * Vereinigung Erzgebirge ;USCS * Chula Vista FC ;USSSA * FC Boulder Harpos | ;NPSL * ASC San Diego * Atlantic City FC * Cleveland SC * Crossfire Redmond * Denton Diablos FC * FC Arizona * FC Davis * FC Motown * Fort Worth Vaqueros * Med City FC * Minneapolis City SC * Naples United FC * Tulsa Athletic * West Chester United SC ;USL League Two * Chicago FC United * Corpus Christi FC * Des Moines Menace * FC Golden State Force * GPS Portland Phoenix * North Carolina Fusion U23 * SC United Bantams * South Georgia Tormenta FC 2 * The Villages SC * Ventura County Fusion * Western Mass Pioneers | ;NISA * California United Strikers FC * Chattanooga FC * Detroit City FC * Los Angeles Force * Michigan Stars FC * Oakland Roots * San Diego 1904 FC * Stumptown Athletic ;USL League One * Chattanooga Red Wolves SC * Forward Madison FC * Greenville Triumph SC * Richmond Kickers * South Georgia Tormenta FC * Union Omaha | * Austin Bold FC * Birmingham Legion * Charleston Battery * Charlotte Independence * Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC * El Paso Locomotive FC * FC Tulsa * Hartford Athletic * Indy Eleven * Las Vegas Lights FC * Louisville City FC * Memphis 901 FC * Miami FC * New Mexico United * North Carolina FC * OKC Energy FC * Orange County SC * Phoenix Rising FC * Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC * Reno 1868 FC * Sacramento Republic FC * Saint Louis FC * San Antonio FC * San Diego Loyal SC * Tampa Bay Rowdies | * Chicago Fire FC * Colorado Rapids * Columbus Crew SC * FC Cincinnati * FC Dallas * Houston Dynamo * Inter Miami CF * Nashville SC * Orlando City SC * San Jose Earthquakes * Sporting Kansas City | * Atlanta United FC * D.C.
