North Sydney District Hockey Club was a dominant Men's hockey club in Sydney throughout the 1970s and 1980s, having all 7 men's team playing in the Grand Finals in 1979. It itself was a merger of North Sydney Police Boys Club and Cremorne-North Sydney Hockey Club in 1953, and later including Mosman Hockey Club in 1959\u201360. Gordon Hockey Club believed to be founded in the 1920s was also a merger, playing under the banner of Gordon-Wahroongah Hockey Club from 1952 until 1991 as it became incorporated. Its highest team was the current-day equivalent of PL2, known then as Premier B or Sydney Cup. Hence, in 1991 Gordon North Sydney Hockey Club emerged from the Merger of North Sydney District Hockey Club and Gordon Hockey Club, as North Sydney wasn't getting appraisal or help from the local council towards a future commitment to club infrastructure like a potential artificial turf field and declining player numbers, whereas Gordon had the newly built Ku-ring-gai Hockey Centre with increasing player numbers but still yet to crack the top Men's and Women's grades - To which the merger provided a top men's team for all.
