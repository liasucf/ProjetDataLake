    "text": "The East Division of the National Hockey League existed from 1967 until 1974 when the league realigned into two conferences of two divisions each. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size, going from six teams to twelve. The Original Six, as the pre-1967 teams became retroactively known, were grouped into the East Division, while the expansion teams were placed into the West Division. This was done in order to keep teams of similar competitive strength in the same division, regardless of geographic distance, and to ensure playoff revenue for the new franchises. This competitive imbalance would lead to East Division teams winning the Stanley Cup in six of the seven years the league was divided into two divisions. Another consequence was that in 1969\u201370, the Montreal Canadiens, who had finished the season with 92 points (more than any team in the West Division), missed the playoffs - the only time between 1948\u201349 and 1993\u201394 that they did so. When the NHL expanded again in 1970, the two new teams, the Vancouver Canucks and Buffalo Sabres, were placed into the stronger East Division. In an effort to create more balanced competition, the Chicago Black Hawks were transferred into the West Division. When the NHL expanded again in 1972, each division was given one of the expansion clubs, with the New York Islanders joining the East Division and the Atlanta Flames joining the West Division. By 1974, another two teams (the Washington Capitals and Kansas City Scouts) entered the NHL, and as a result the league underwent a major overhaul. The East and West Divisions were renamed the Prince of Wales and Clarence Campbell Conferences, respectively, composed of nine teams each. The conferences were further divided into two divisions: the Norris and Adams Divisions for the Wales Conference, and the Patrick and Smythe Divisions for the Campbell Conference. Because the Conferences were not geographically based, the league opted to name the conferences and divisions after notable persons associated with the NHL. ==Division lineups== ===1967\u20131970=== * Boston Bruins * Chicago Black Hawks * Detroit Red Wings * Montreal Canadiens * New York Rangers * Toronto Maple Leafs ====Changes from the 1966\u201367 season==== * The East Division is formed as the result of NHL realignment * All Original Six teams are placed in the division ===1970\u20131972=== * Boston Bruins * Buffalo Sabres * Detroit Red Wings * Montreal Canadiens * New York Rangers * Toronto Maple Leafs * Vancouver Canucks ====Changes from the 1969\u201370 season==== * The Chicago Black Hawks move to the West Division * The Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks are added as expansion teams ===1972\u20131974=== * Boston Bruins * Buffalo Sabres * Detroit Red Wings * Montreal Canadiens * New York Islanders * New York Rangers * Toronto Maple Leafs * Vancouver Canucks ====Changes from the 1971\u201372 season==== * The New York Islanders are added as an expansion team ===After the 1973\u201374 season=== The league was reformatted into two conferences with two divisions each.
