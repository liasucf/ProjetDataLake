    "text": "800 Bullets () is a 2002 Spanish comedy-drama film directed by \u00c1lex de la Iglesia and starring Sancho Gracia and Carmen Maura. The film is about the Westerns made in Almer\u00eda, Spain and the Spaghetti Western in general. The characters are old stuntmen. ==Plot== Juli\u00e1n Torralba is a former film stuntman in Almeria, Spain. He and several of his colleagues, who once made a living in American Westerns shot in Spain, now are reduced to doing stunt shows for minuscule audiences on the decaying set built for those old Westerns. Juli\u00e1n wrestles with dark memories of the death of his son, also a stuntman, and with estrangement from his daughter-in-law Laura and her son Carlos. Carlos, a young boy, becomes intrigued with his late father's life and runs away to join Juli\u00e1n and his band of has-beens. There Carlos is initiated into the rambunctious life of these hard-drinking faux cowboys. But when Laura, a powerful executive looking for a new site for a tourist resort, learns that Carlos has joined the hated Juli\u00e1n, she moves to destroy even this remnant of Juli\u00e1n's once-proud career. Juli\u00e1n and the cowboys decide to fight back the only way they know how. ==External links== * Category:2000s Western (genre) comedy-drama films Category:2002 films Category:English-language films Category:Films about stunt performers Category:Films directed by \u00c1lex de la Iglesia Category:Italian-language films Category:Spanish films Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda Category:Films scored by Roque Ba\u00f1os Category:Films with screenplays by Jorge Guerricaechevarr\u00eda Category:Spanish Western (genre) comedy films Category:2002 comedy films Category:2002 drama films ",
