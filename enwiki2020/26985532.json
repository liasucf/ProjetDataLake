Karnataka is one of the six states in India (formerly seven), where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly), and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Karnataka Legislative Council is a permanent body comprising 75 members. ==History== It was established as the Mysore Legislative Council in 1907 (under Regulation I of 1907) in the Princely State of Mysore with a view to associate with the Government certain number of non-official persons having practical experience and knowledge of local conditions and requirements to assist government in making Laws and Regulations. In addition to the Dewan, President and the Members of Council, who were ex-officio members, at that time the Council consisted of not less than 10 and not more than 15 additional members to be nominated by the Government, out of which not less than two-fifths were required to be non- officials. The minimum and maximum number of additional members was increased from 15 to 21 respectively by Regulation I of 1914 and the maximum was further increased to 30 by Regulation II of 1919.Rao, C. Hayavadana (ed.). (1929). Mysore Gazetteer, Vol. IV, Bangalore: Government Press, pp.96-7. In 1923, under the Mysore Legislative Council Regulation, (Regulation XIX of 1923), the strength of Legislative Council was fixed at 50. Of the 50 seats, 28 were allotted to the nominated members (official 20 and non-official 8) and 22 to elected members. In 1914 the Council was empowered to discuss the Budget and in 1923 it was given power to vote on the demands for grants. From 1919 onwards Resolution were discussed in the Council. The term of the Council was three years in 1917 and four years in 1940. After the implementation of the 1956 States Reorganisation Act, the strength of the Legislative Council of the re-organized Mysore State was increased to 63 under the Legislative Councils Act, 1957 and it remained same until 1987. Following adoption of a resolution in Karnataka Legislative Assembly on 18 August 1986 and subsequent approval by the Parliament of India, the strength of Legislative Council was increased to 75 with effect from 8 September 1987. ==Term== The Karnataka Legislative Council is a permanent body with one-third of its members retiring every two years. The term of members is 6 years (renewable). ==Constituencies and Members== At present, among the 75 members of the Legislative Council, 25 are elected by the Karnataka Legislative Assembly members, 25 are elected by local authorities, 7 are elected by the Graduates, 7 are elected by the Teachers and 11 members are nominated by the Governor of Karnataka.
