The cup triumph was sealed with two late goals from Frank McAvennie, signed in early October from West Ham United, as they had trailed 1\u20130 to Dundee United. Rangers, further strengthened with the signing of Englishmen Ray Wilkins and Mark Walters in midfield, had consolation for their failure to repeat title glory in the shape of a League Cup win. They could only finish third in the league, with Hearts finishing second \u2013 10 points adrift of champions Celtic. The Old Firm league fixture at Ibrox in October 1987, which ended in a 2-2 draw, saw three players red carded. Charges were later brought against four of the players (three from Rangers, one from Celtic) by the Procurator Fiscal. The resulting Court case ended up with Terry Butcher and Chris Woods being convicted of a breach of the peace. Graham Roberts was found Not proven, whilst Frank McAvennie was acquitted. Rangers enjoyed the longest run in Europe out of all the Scottish clubs, reaching the European Cup quarter finals where they were edged out by Steaua Bucharest. A reduction of the Premier Division from 12 clubs to 10 saw three clubs (Falkirk, Dunfirmline Athletic and Morton) relegated. The only promotion place went to Division One champions Hamilton Academical. ==Scottish Premier Division== Champions: Celtic Relegated: Falkirk, Dunfermline Athletic, Morton ==Scottish League Division One== Promoted: Hamilton Academical Relegated: East Fife, Dumbarton ==Scottish League Division Two== Promoted: Ayr United, St Johnstone ==Other honours== ===Cup honours=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=140|Competition !width=135|Winner !width=80|Score !width=135|Runner-up |- |align=left|Scottish Cup 1987\u201388 |Celtic |2\u20131 |Dundee United |- |align=left|League Cup 1987\u201388 |Rangers |3 \u2013 3 (5 \u2013 3 pen.) |Aberdeen |- |align=left|Youth Cup |Dunfermline Athletic |2\u20131 |Dundee |- |align=left|Junior Cup |Auchinleck Talbot |1\u20130 |Petershill |} ===Non-league honours=== ====Senior==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=180|Competition !width=140|Winner |- |Highland League 1987\u201388 |Inverness Caledonian |- |East of Scotland League |Whitehill Welfare |- |South of Scotland League |Newton Stewart |} ===Individual honours=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
