    "text": "John Anthony Hopkins (born June 16, 1953 in Maesteg) is a former Welsh cricketer who played for Glamorgan. Hopkins was a right-handed batsman and part-time wicket-keeper. He first kept for Glamorgan at the age of 17 years and 68 days which was a record for the county and the Sunday League competition. With Eifion Jones commanding a regular place behind the stumps he was forced to concentrate on his batting and was soon opening the batting for Glamorgan. His highest score of 230 was made against Worcestershire at New Road. His brother, Jeffris, also played first-class cricket. ==External links== * Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:Eastern Province cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers ",
