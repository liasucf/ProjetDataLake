Capella produced a number of aircraft designs, all of a strut-braced, high wing configuration. The first series were all enclosed cockpit designs, starting with the Capella SS, a single seat model introduced in 1988. In 1990 the Capella XS two-seat conventional landing gear model followed, along with a tricycle gear model, the Capella XLS. The Capella Fastback was introduced in 1995. In 1998 the open cockpit single-seat Capella Javelin I was introduced as a FAR 103 ultralight. This was followed by the Capella Javelin II the same year and finally the Capella T-Raptor, all variants of the basic Javelin design. == Aircraft == {| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style=\"font- size:90%;\" |- |+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| Summary of aircraft built by Capella Aircraft |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" !
