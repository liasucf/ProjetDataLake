He was the son of Huntington Wolcott Merchant (c.1870\u20131918) and Mary Cornelia (n\u00e9e Tallmadge) Merchant, who lived at 1172 Park Avenue in New York City. His sister was Elizabeth Wolcott \"Betty\" Merchant (b. 1902), who married Philip Gallatin Cammann. He was a descendant on his father's side of Oliver Wolcott Jr., the second Secretary of the Treasury under George Washington following Alexander Hamilton. Through his mother, he was descended from Sir Thomas Tallmadge, who emigrated to the colonies in 1632, Benjamin Tallmadge, and Gen. William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His maternal grandparents were Chester Livingston Tallmadge and Fanny Amelia Hamilton. Merchant was educated at the Hotchkiss School in 1922 and Princeton in 1926, where he was a member of the University Cottage Club and the Board of Trustees of Princeton University. ==Career== He joined Scudder Stevens and Clark, an investment counselling firm.
