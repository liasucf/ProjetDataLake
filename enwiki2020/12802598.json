Powell matriculated at Jesus College in 1581, obtaining his BA in 1584, MA in 1589, and BCL in 1593. He was elected Fellow of the college in 1589. He effectively ran the college during the principalships of his two predecessors, Francis Bevans and John Williams. Williams deprived him of his Fellowship, but it was restored on the Chancellor's orders. Powell wrote two volumes on Aristotelian philosophy, Analysis analyticorum posteriorum (1594) and De sophisticis elenchis (1598). He was awarded his DCL in 1599.

His careful approach to college finances also made it possible to increase the numbers of resident fellows and scholars, and the popularity of the college with students from South Wales in particular increased during his time as Principal. He died in 1620 and was buried in the Church of St Michael at the Northgate near the College. He left his whole estate to the college; lands in Flintshire were bought with the proceeds, and these remained in college ownership until 1966. The college chapel was completed within a year of his death. ==References== Category:1561 births Category:1620 deaths Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Principals of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Welsh philosophers Category:People from Carmarthenshire Category:16th-century Welsh people Category:17th-century Welsh people Category:16th-century philosophers Category:17th-century philosophers ",
