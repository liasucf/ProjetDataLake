Hamilton was charged in an Alabama court with breaking and entering a dwelling at night with intent to ravish, and had pleaded not guilty. He had then been convicted and sentenced to death. The Court ruled unanimously that the absence of counsel at the time of his arraignment violated Hamilton's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 368 *Alabama State Mercenaries ==External links== * * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Warren Court Category:United States Sixth Amendment appointment of counsel case law Category:1961 in United States case law Category:Legal history of Alabama Category:1961 in Alabama ",
