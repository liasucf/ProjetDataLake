    "text": "Masons Gin (also known as Masons Dry Yorkshire Gin) is a gin based alcoholic drink distilled by the Mason family in North Yorkshire, England. The brand has won many awards and accolades despite only being set up in 2013. It had a distillery and shop in Aiskew, North Yorkshire, which was moved to a new site in Leeming Bar, after a fire. ==History== Karl and Cathy Mason created the brand in 2012 and launched their first gin a year later on World Gin Day, 13 June 2013. Originally the business was located in Bedale Hall for the offices with the stills situated in Cambridge. The business expanded and moved into one site at Aiskew which was formerly a mechanics workshop. Known as Yorkshire Dry Gin, the gin is distilled in a traditional dry gin method using a copper alembic still, with all the botanicals (herbs, fruit and spices) present in the still. This process is known as the London Dry Gin method. The company also uses Harrogate Spring Water in its gins. Initially they started out with 120 bottles from the first still in 2013. In 2018, the company produced over 250,000 bottles of gin and vodka from its Aiskew distillery and recorded a \u00a33 million turnover. On 2 April 2019, one of the gin stills exploded and caused a fire in the distillery. Whilst everyone was evacuated safely and no injuries were reported, the fire caused extensive damage to the distillery. Whilst the directors of the company secured office space in Bedale Hall, their gin products have been bottled at a \"food-grade premises\" nearby. They confirmed that they were looking for a brand new location rather than returning to the old distillery at Aiskew. A new distillery has been installed at a location on the Leeming Bar industrial estate, and opened on 6 March 2020. Shortly after moving into their new premises, the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed their operations. However, they, like many other alcohol-based producers, turned to manufacturing hand sanitiser which they donated to RAF Leeming and businesses in their home town of Bedale. ==Products== ===Gins=== *Original *Lavender *Tea - a gin flavoured with Yorkshire Tea, also known as a G and Tea *Slow Distilled Sloe - this gin actually distills the sloe berries, as opposed to the traditional method of infusing them in gin *Steve's Apple - distilled with apples picked from an orchard in Thornton Watlass *Peppered Pear *G12 - only available through one supermarket (so called because it has 12 botanicals in it) *G12 - Grapefruit & mandarin *Smouldering Heights - a smoky gin infused with beech-smoked and peat-smoked malt, heather and Szechuan pepper.
