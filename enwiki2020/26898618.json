    "text": "VII Gates is a heavy metal band from Sweden, started in 1999 by Swedish guitarist and composer Jonas Arvidsson. The band got signed by Soundriot Records in 2002, and released the first album \"Fire, walk with me\" in 2003/2004. The album was very well received in most magazines and ezines around the world. One song from this album, \"The saviour\" was also released as a video. However, something happened between VII Gates and Soundriot Records, and the cooperation ended in late 2004. The band was then signed by Lion Music, but took almost 3 years to complete the second album \"In hoc signo vinces\". This album was far more complex than the first, and wasn't as well received either. ==Discography== Fire, walk with me (2003, Soundriot Records) In hoc signo vinces (2008, Lion Music) ==Current members== Mick van Slowfoot - Drums Criss Blackburn - Vocals Robert Makek - Guitars Nicola Posa - Bass ==Previous members== JJ Rockford - Guitars David Agnsvik - Bass Magnus Jacobsson - Bass Tim Diaz - Keyboards Morgan Andersson - Bass ==References== == Discography == *Fire, walk with me (2003, Soundriot Records) *In hoc signo vinces (2008, Lion Music) ==External links== * VII Gates official homepage * VII Gates official myspace Category:Swedish heavy metal musical groups ",
