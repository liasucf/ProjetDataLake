She was empress-consort of Emperor Takakura. Tokuko was also the last Heike Imperial survivor from the great naval battle of Dan-no-ura.Kitagawa, Hiroshi et al. (1975). The Tale of the Heike, pp. 652-678; Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, pp. 211-212. Her life became a compelling narrative which survives as both history and literature. ==In history== ===Daughter of an emperor=== Tokuko became the adopted daughter of , the 77th emperor of Japan who reigned from 1155 through 1158. In 1171, when Tokuko was adopted at age 17, the former emperor had abdicated the throne and entered the Buddhist priesthood, taking the Buddhist name of Gy\u014dshin. ===Consort of an emperor=== In 1172, Tokuko was married to Shirakawa's fourth son, Emperor Takakura.Titsingh, pp. 188-190; Brown, pp. 326-327; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinn\u014d Sh\u014dt\u014dki. pp. 205-208. Takakura was also her first cousin as both their mothers were half-sisters. The wedding was an arranged one, as to cement the alliance between the two co-fathers-in-law; Shirakawa sponsored Kiyomori's rise as Chancellor of the Realm, while Kiyomori provided military and financial support to Shirakawa. Tokuko and Takakura's son, Prince Tokihito, was born in 1178. Just a year later, Kiyomori launched a coup d'\u00e9tat, sacking his political rivals from their posts, banishing them, and replacing them with his allies and clansmen. He even had Shirakawa imprisoned; at this point they fallen out of their political alliance. In 1180, Emperor Takakura was forced to abdicate by Kiyomori; Tokihito ascended the throne as Emperor Antoku. Now an empress dowager, Tokuko received the name Kenrei-mon In.Brown, p. 331; Titsingh, p. 424; Kitagawa, p. 764. In this period, the names of the several gates in the walls surrounding the Imperial grounds refer not only to the wall-openings themselves; these names were also used to refer indirectly to a nearby residence of an empress whose husband had abdicated, or as an indirect way of referring to an empress dowager herself. the Kenrei-mon (\u5efa\u793c\u9580), one of the entrance gates to Kyoto Imperial Palace For example, , whose official home, after the abdication and death of Emperor Takakura, was located near the Kenrei Gate. ===Mother of an emperor=== Tokuko, now Dowager Empress Kenrei-mon In, was mother to Emperor Antoku. The child emperor reigned from 1180 through 1185.Titsingh, pp. 200-207; Brown, pp. 333-334; Varley, pp. 214-215. ===Survivor of Dan-no-ura=== Arguably, the most difficult moments in Kenreimon-In's life occurred near the close of the battle of Dan-no-ura, which took place near the southern tip of Honsh\u016b in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi. * Genryaku 2, on the 24th day of the 3rd month (April 25, 1185): The Taira and the Minamoto clashed for the last time.Kitagawa, Hiroshi et al. (1975). The Tale of the Heike, p. 787; Titsingh, pp. 211-212. The Taira were defeated decisively. Many of the Taira samurai threw themselves into the waves rather than live to see their clan's ultimate defeat at the hands of the Minamoto. Antoku's grandmother, Taira no Tokiko, Kiyomori's widow, leapt into the water with the young emperor clasped firmly in her arms.Kitagawa, pp. 676-677. Kenrei-mon In also tried to drown herself; but according to the conventionally accepted accounts, she was pulled out with a rake by her long hair.Kitagawa, pp. 678; Titsingh, p. 212. ===Buddhist nun=== This sometime daughter, wife, and mother of emperors became a recluse in her later years. * Bunji 1, on the 1st day of the 5th month (1185): Kenrei-mon In took the tonsure at Ch\u014draku-ji, a branch temple of Enryaku-ji on Higashiyama.Kitagawa, pp. 763-765. * Bunji 1, on the 30th day of the 9th month (1185): Kenrei-mon In retreated further from the world when she moved to , a Buddhist nunnery near the village of , northeast of the Heian-ky\u014d.Kitagawa, pp. 766-768, 787....Click for link to photos of Jakk\u014d-in and \u014chara * Bunji 2, on the 20th day of the 4th month (1186): Gy\u014dshin, the cloistered former-Emperor Go-Shirakawa, visited Kenrei- mon In at her rural retreat in \u014chara.Kitagawa, pp. 769-779, 788. * Kenky\u016b 2, in the 2nd month (1192): Kenrei-mon In dies in \u014chara.Kitagawa, pp. 780-782, 788. [Although The Tale of the Heike gives 1192 as the year of Kenrei-mon In's death, the Gukansh\u014d identifies 1213 as the year of her death -- cf. Brown, p. 333.] This once-pampered great lady is said to have composed this poem in her hermit's hut: ==In literature== Many stories and works of art depict this period in Japanese history, and it is through these sources that the life of Taira no Tokuko is best known. The Tale of the Heike is the most famous of the sources from which we learn about this historical character, although many kabuki and bunraku plays reproduce events of the war as well. The central theme of the Heike story\u2014and the mirrored theme of Taira no Tokuko's life story\u2014is a demonstration of the Buddhist law of impermanence. The theme of impermanence (muj\u014d) is captured in the opening passage: > The sound of the Gion Sh\u014dja bells echoes the impermanence of all things; the > color of the s\u0101la flowers reveals the truth that the prosperous must > decline. The proud do not endure, they are like a dream on a spring night; > the mighty fall at last, they are as dust before the wind.McCullough, Helen > Craig. (1988). The Tale of the Heike,. In this and other classic Japanese tales, the central figures are popularly well known, the major events are generally understood, and the stakes as they were understood at the time are conventionally accepted as elements in the foundation of Japanese culture. The accuracy of each of these historical records has become a compelling subject for further study; and some accounts have been shown to withstand close scrutiny, while other presumed \u201cfacts\u201d have turned out to be inaccurate.Brown, pp. 385-386. In English-language literature, Tokuko's life and reign are depicted throughout the two-volume historical fiction narrative, White as Bone, Red as Blood, by Cerridwen Fallingstar, published in 2009 and 2011, respectively.White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress (2009), and White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Storm God (2011). ==Notes== ==References== * Brown, Delmer M. and Ichiro Ishida.
