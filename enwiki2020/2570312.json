CHESS is currently dormant, and has not published minutes since April 2009.CHESS: Policies and Info CHESS was founded in 1999 out of the previous Scottish Ancients GroupUniversity of Glasgow :: Legal statements :: Freedom of Information :: FOI Publication Scheme when the Students' Association at Strathclyde demonstrated an interest in membership. Membership of CHESS was not incompatible with membership of the National Union of Students Scotland, though at the time the organisation went dormant all members except Aberdeen University Students' Association were non-affiliates of National Union of Students Scotland. The goal of CHESS was to provide a national forum for dialogue and policy enhancement on issues affecting students. The body provided a channel for representing the views of students in Scotland to national and governmental bodies. The CHESS Executive Committee was made up of two representatives from each member institution, usually the president and one other. There were two office bearers in CHESS; the convener, who chaired meetings and represented CHESS externally, and the secretary, who dealt with all administrative matters. ==Members== *Aberdeen University Students' AssociationMinutes of Aberdeen University Students' Association Annual General Meeting 1 December 2005 (Microsoft Word document) *Dundee University Students' Association *Glasgow University Students' Representative Council *University of St Andrews Students' Association *Open University Students Association in Scotland *Glasgow School of Art Students' Association *National Postgraduate Committee (dormant since 2007) ==Former members== *Edinburgh University Students' Association (joined in 2002 as a founding member; disaffiliated on 10 January 2006Minutes of the 6th Ordinary meeting of the 122nd Edinburgh University Students' Representative Council held on 10 January 2006\"Checkmate: EUSA vote in favour of leaving CHESS\" - Nick Mitchell, Student (newspaper) 24 January 2006)) *University of Strathclyde Students' Association (disaffiliated in March 2010)USSA President Philip Whyte explains on a Facebook discussion group why Strathclyde disaffiliated from CHESS ==See also== *National Union of Students Scotland ==References== ==External links== * Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland (CHESS) Category:Universities in Scotland Category:Groups of students' unions Category:2001 establishments in Scotland Category:Organizations established in 2001 Category:Higher education in Scotland ",
