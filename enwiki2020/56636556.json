    "text": "The gens Rasinia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions. In imperial times a Gaius Rasinius Silo was governor of Noricum.PIR, vol. III, p. 125. ==Origin== From the large number of inscriptions mentioning the Rasinii in and around Etruria, and especially from Arretium and Pisae, as well as the surnames Pisanus and Pisaurensis, referring to members who were natives of Pisae and of the Etruscan colony at Pisaurum, it seems beyond doubt that the Rasinii were Etruscans, and that their nomen, Rasinius, must be derived from the Etruscan Rasenna, the Etruscan name for their own culture.Dionysius, Romaike Archaiologia, i. 30. ==Praenomina== The chief praenomina of the Rasinii were Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus, with Decimus and Sextus being used to a lesser extent. Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus were the three most common names throughout Roman history, while Sextus was fairly common, and Decimus somewhat more distinctive. Other names occur infrequently among the Rasinii, although examples of Publius, Quintus, and Titus are known. ==Members== * Rasinia, buried at Rome, in a tomb built by Publius Julius Trophimus, together with Marcus Rasinius Hermadio, Javolena Capitolina, and Javolena Sempronia.. * Rasinia, built a sepulchre at Rome for herself, her husband, Decimus Rasinius Celadus, her son, Decimus Rasinius Memor, Rasinia Aucta, a house slave, and Decimus Rasinius, a freedman.. * Rasinia, a freedwoman named in an inscription from Aquinum in Latium, together with Rufa Rasinia.. * Decimus Rasinius, a freedman buried in the family sepulchre built by Rasinia at Rome. * Gaius Rasinius, a potter at Arretium in Etruria, whose works have been found all over the Roman world., , {{AE|1968|545}, , . * Rufa Rasinia, named in an inscription from Aquinum, together with a freedwoman named Rasinia. * Sextus Rasinius M. f., son of Marcus Rasinius Martialis, was buried at Thysdrus in Africa Proconsularis, aged two years, four months.. * Rasinius Amerimnus, built a tomb at Rome for himself and his daughter.. * Lucius Rasinius Antiochus, buried at Rome, together with Lucius Rasinius Daphnus, and two others.. * Rasinia Attica, daughter of Vesia Secunda, who built a tomb for her at Clusium in Etruria.NSA, 1974, Supp. 546. * Rasinia Aucta, a house-slave belonging to Rasinia, the wife of Decimus Rasinius Celadus, was buried in the family sepulchre at Rome, aged twenty-three. * Publius Rasinius L. f.
