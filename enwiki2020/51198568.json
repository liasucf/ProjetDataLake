DMG Clearances was founded in 1996 by Deborah Mannis-Gardner. The company clears musical compositions for use in films, video games, sampling and Broadway Theater. Clients include Drake, Coen Brothers, Martin Scorsese, Rockstar Games and The Roots. ==Deborah Mannis-Gardner== Deborah Mannis-Gardner is a graduate of Emerson College and began her career in the entertainment industry working on music videos and providing television clearances in New York City in 1989. Mannis-Gardner went into the business of sample clearances for hip hop music in 1992 with a UK business partner. In 1996, she created DMG Clearances to focus on sample clearances and music placement. Regarding the state of music sampling, Mannis-Gardner has always considered it an art. \"I think sampling is an art and I think it's incredible. When I first started, I was told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That it wasn't going to be around. All of that horrible, negative stuff. I kept saying \"well, a collage, that's not real art? Jambalaya isn't real food?\" That's a great meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that's what sampling is.\" ==Awards== The New Castle County Chamber of Commerce named Mannis-Gardner the 2016 Entrepreneurial Woman of the Year. ==DMG credits== ===Film=== Source: IMDB * 1997 A Life Less Ordinary (music clearances - as Debra Mannis-Gardner) * 1997 Kiss Me, Guido (music clearances) * 1998 Velvet Goldmine (music coordinator - as Debra Mannis-Gardner) * 1999 Dogma (music coordinator - as Debra Mannis- Gardner) * 1999 She's All That (music coordinator - as Debra Mannis-Gardner) * 2000 O Brother, Where Art Thou?
