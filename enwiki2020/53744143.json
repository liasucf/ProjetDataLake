This album is a little-known quartet set with pianist Albert Dailey, bassist George Duvivier and drummer Victor Lewis, Davis' only recording for Muse. Lockjaw had never worked with Dailey or Lewis before but they have little difficulty interpreting the tough-toned tenor's usual repertoire. == Track listing == # \"When Your Lover Has Gone\" (Einar Aaron Swan) \u2013 4:33 # \"Just One of Those Things\" (Cole Porter) \u2013 4:16 # \"Medley: Old Folks/Out of Nowhere\" (Dedette Lee Hill, Willard Robison/Johnny Green, Edward Heyman) \u2013 8:24 # \"Secret Love\" (Sammy Fain, Paul Francis Webster) \u2013 5:39 # \"Comin' Home Baby\" (Ben Tucker, Bob Dorough) \u2013 6:01 # \"You Stepped Out of a Dream\" (Nacio Herb Brown, Gus Kahn) \u2013 3:04 # \"Jim Dog\" (Gene Ammons) \u2013 5:01 == Personnel == * Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis \u2013 tenor saxophone * Albert Dailey \u2013 piano * George Duvivier \u2013 bass * Victor Lewis \u2013 drums == References == Category:Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis albums Category:1979 albums Category:Muse Records albums Category:Albums produced by Michael Cuscuna ",
