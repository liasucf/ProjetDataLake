The picture, which featured appearances by Eddie Foy, Jr., Lila Lee, and George Raft, is now considered a lost film.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p. 14 A still existing vintage movie trailer of this film displays no clip of the feature. ==Plot== After working as a hostess for Nick and Andy, Tex Malone leaves their employ and opens a club of her own. Looking for talent to book for the floor show, Tex hires Bee Walters and thereby breaks up Bee's act with Eddie Parr. Andy spitefully kills Tex's friend, Holland, and young Eddie is arrested for the crime on circumstantial evidence. Tex then learns from Eddie's father, Phil, that Eddie is her long-lost son. At the trial, Tex comes to Eddie's defense and persuades one member of the jury that there is reasonable doubt of Eddie's guilt. The jury repairs to Tex's club, where Tex discovers a piece of evidence that conclusively links Andy with the murder. Eddie is freed, and Tex and Phil get together for a second honeymoon. ==Cast== *Texas Guinan as Texas Malone *John Davidson as Don Holland *Lila Lee as Bea Walters *Arthur Housman as Andy Quinland *Eddie Foy, Jr. as Eddie Parr *Jack Norworth as Phil Parr *George Raft as Gigola *Jimmy Phillips as Nick *William B.

Warner Bros signed Guinan to make the film on 15 August 1928. Jack Norwood, John Davidson and Eddie Foy were signed to support her. Filming started in September 1928. Guinan had recently toured Los Angeles. According to George Raft's obituary, Raft made his movie debut in the film as a dancer, but his scenes were cut from the final film. However Variety did a review which said \"nite club scene introduces George Raft, the hot' stepper, as the m. c.and band leader, being brought down for one of his rip-snorting hoofing specialties.\" Filming started September 1928. In finished by November. ==Reception== The film was generally reviewed as mediocre by critics. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it \"a somewhat entertaining thriller\", though he found the ending \"amateurishly forced\". Variety wrote, \"Tex hasn't much to do, but does what she has pretty well... Texas Guinan and \"Queen of the Night Clubs\" is a double-barreled, come-on at the gate. The' ballyboo potentialities are limitless. Peasants will go for it like unexpurgated literature. \" Film Daily called it \"dull and uninteresting\", writing, \"This film was built solely to give Tex Guinan a chance to show how she runs her Broadway night club, but it has been done so often and so much better in other films of night club life that it carries no kick.\" John Mosher of The New Yorker expressed disappointment, writing, \"Rather to our surprise and much to our regret, Miss Guinan doesn't carry the picture with as much verve as it might seem that she would.\" ===Box office=== According to Warner Bros the film earned $459,000 domestically and $13,000 foreign. ==Preservation status== *No film elements are known to exist. The complete soundtrack (except the first reel), however, survives on Vitaphone disks. 1957 MOVIES FROM AAP Warner Bros Features & Cartoons SALES BOOK DIRECTED AT TV *A clip from this film featuring Guinan and Raft was incorporated into Winner Take All (1932), an early James Cagney vehicle. *Brief footage of Guinan, yelling \"Hello, suckers!\" in a restaurant (or perhaps her nightclub), appears in the 1980s HBO series Yesteryear...1927 hosted by Dick Cavett. This documentary series had Cavett cover a given year out of each decade from 1917 to 1969. Since this episode of Yesteryear was about 1927, the footage of Guinan could be newsreel footage from 1927 or extant 1929 footage from Queen of the Night Clubs (the same footage in Winner Take All). ==See also== *List of lost films ==References== ==External links== * Category:1929 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Lost American films Category:Films directed by Bryan Foy Category:1920s musical drama films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American musical drama films Category:1929 drama films ",
