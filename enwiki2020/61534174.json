Founded in 1995, it is an online directory that allows users to read and publish crowd-sourced reviews of local businesses and contractors. Prior to July 2016, Angie's List was a subscription-only service, but is now free to all home owners as a subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices Inc. ==History== William S. Oesterle and Angie Hicks founded Angie's List in 1995. The idea resulted from Hicks's search for a reliable construction contractor in suburban Columbus, Ohio, on behalf of Oesterle, a venture capitalist who was Hicks's boss. Hicks moved to Columbus to join Oesterle in creating Columbus Neighbors, a call-in service and publication with reviews of local home and lawn care services. The name and concept were based on Unified Neighbors in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hicks went door-to-door, signing up consumers as members and collecting ratings of local contractors. After Hicks recruited over 1,000 members in Columbus within one year, she turned to Oesterle to raise money from investors to develop the business. In 1996, the company bought Unified Neighbors from its creator and moved the company's headquarters to Indianapolis. By 1999, the database of local services and reviews was moved to the Internet. In the following years, the customer base and business relationships grew throughout the United States, while expanding coverage to include additional services, such as health care and auto care. In 2017, the company announced in a press release that they had 2 million subscribers in the year 2013. In August 2015, it reported 3.2 million paid members. In July 2016, Angie's List was made a freemium service; the basic membership tier, which includes access to more than 10 million reviews, was made free, alongside subscription tiers offering additional functionality. ==Ratings methodology== Angie's List members grade companies using a report-card-style scale, which ranges from A to F; these ratings are based on the following criteria: price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism. Each company has its own page, which is composed of a description of its business along with the customer reviews. The aggregate grade is drawn from the combined reviews and grades given to the businesses from the consumers. ==Criticism and controversies== A 2017 investigation by a Chicago news station found that many Local 'Angie's List Certified' contractors are unlicensed to do work. David Segal found that when subscribers post a negative review of a company to Angie's List, a staff member discusses it with the subscriber in an attempt to rectify the situation. After they \"fix the problem\" they will remove the complaint. ==Litigation== According to The Washington Post, in March 2007 SCS Contracting Group sued Angie's List and two members for libel because of negative reviews of the company. One of the sued members remarked, \"if [contractors are] able to sue, then the value of Angie's List depreciates.... People aren't going to be willing to submit reviews if they could be threatened with a lawsuit.\" On October 7, 2008, the plaintiffs dismissed the complaint against the two members. Summary judgment was later granted in favor of all defendants. In 2014, Angie's List Inc. paid $2.8 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that it automatically renewed members at a higher rate than they were led to believe. In August 2016, Angie's List has agreed to settle three lawsuits for a payment of $1,400,000. The class action lawsuits focused on Angie's List's acceptance of advertising payments from service providers, and whether those payments affect service providers\u2019 letter-grade ratings, reviews, and place in search- result rankings. Angie's List denies plaintiffs\u2019 claims, but disclosed that revenue from service providers can affect the order of search-result rankings of the service provider under certain settings. ==Financial information== In 2010, Angie's List raised a total of $25 million in capital from investors. In September 2010, Wasatch Funds and Battery Ventures invested $22 million. In November 2010, Saints Capital led an additional funding of $2.5 million. On November 17, 2011, Angie's List began trading on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ANGI. It priced 8.8M shares at $13 and opened for trading at $18, a 33% premium. Shares have remained below $13 since March 2014.Public Record, NASDAQ Before 2015, the company had been dependent on capital infusions from investors to stay afloat. Angie's List had its first profitable year since its founding in 1995 in 2015. In 2013, investors worried that the company had been in business for more than 18 years, yet never had shown an annual profit, and that valuations of the company were unrealistic based on the actual revenue the company produces. But by 2015 growth estimates indicate a significant earnings-per-share growth, with a long-term growth rate at 19%. Combine this with stock estimates rising in 2015 by 13.3%, some Securities research firms such as Zacks Investment Research indicated ANGI is well- positioned for future earnings growth. On May 2, 2017, IAC/InterActiveCorp, owner of HomeAdvisor, announced that it had agreed to acquire Angie's List for $8.50 per-share (valuing the company at over $500 million). On October 1, 2017, IAC merged Angie's List and HomeAdvisor, renaming the merged company to ANGI Homeservices, retaining Angie's List ticker symbol and stock history. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in Indianapolis Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:American review websites Category:American companies established in 1995 Category:Internet properties established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Ohio Category:2011 initial public offerings Category:IAC (company) Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions ",
