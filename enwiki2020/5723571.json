    "text": "Al-Ahli Sports Club ( ; ), known as Al Ahli Tripoli, is a Libyan football club based in Tripoli, Libya. The club is the second most successful Libyan club in history after Al-Ittihad, having won 12 Libyan Premier League titles, 6 Libyan Cups and 2 Libyan SuperCups. Alahly is known as the leader of Libyan Football clubs and has the largest number of fans in Libya. The club's crest consists of a green and white background, with a torch placed on an outline of Libya. The torch is meant to signify independence for the nation, as it was achieved just months after the club was founded. The club's crest changed after it won its 10th Libyan Premier League title in 2000, with a star being placed on top. Alahli's main rivalry is with Al-Ittihad. The two clubs are the biggest in the country, and together, have won 28 of the 45 national championships that have been contested, as well as 10 of the 18 domestic cups. The rivalry's name is the Tripoli Derby. The club won the first national championship in the 1963\u201364 season, but then suffered a period of seven years until its next win in 1970\u201371. The club won two of the next three titles, and picked up the last before the cancellation of the league in 1977\u201378. The 1980s was a very dire period for the club, as their own failure, coupled with Al Ittihad's success, meant that their rivals went into the 1990s with six titles to their own five. However, they reach the final of the African Cup Winners' Cup in 1984, where they withdrew from facing Al-Ahly Cairo, as the bad Libyan relationship with Egypt at that time meant that Libyan clubs were banned from facing Egyptian clubs. ==Foundation== In the middle of the 20th century, Libya, a country still looking for its independence, started to found many sporting clubs and youth clubs in a political move to unite the youth of the country in order to fight for its independence, and drive out the British forces. A young group of youngsters from Tripoli decided to name their club Al Istiqlal, meaning Independence, but the British administration, uncomfortable with this name as it may have caused a revolt against their power, refused it. The club was therefore named Alahly, meant as The People's Club, and chose the club's colours as green to signify independence, peace and hope for the country. The youngsters who put their names down for the first board meeting were: *Musbah Wanis (President and Owner) *Alaa Musbah Wanis (Vice-President) *Yousef Bin Abdallah (Treasurer) *Salem Bin Hussein (Board Member) *Mustafa Al Raqea'y (Board Member) *Mahmoud Bin Hadimah (Board Member) *Mohamed Sa'ad Bin Othman (Board Member) *Mustapha Al Khouga (Board Member) The club was founded on 19 September 1950. ===First squad === *Amir Al Mujraab *Mabrouk Al Misraty *Ahmed Al Taweel *Hassan Mohamed Al Amir *Mahmoud Abu Hadima *Mohamed Al Houny *Mohamed Al Yumni *Salem Bin Hussein *Mustafa Al Khouga *Al-hadi Al Khadaar *Mustafa Al Raqea'y *Mohamed Al Sadiq Abu Raqiqa *Ali Al Jundi *Abdesalam Bizaan *Ibrahim Kafaalah *Yousef Bin Abdallah Al Fazzani *Ali Al Jdeady *Manager: Othman Bizaan ==Crest== File:Al Ahly Tripoli logo.png|Former logo File:Al-Ahli SC Tripoli (logo).png|Former logo |Present logo ==Honours== *Libyan Premier League: 12 **Champions 1963-64, 1970-71, 1972-73, 1973-74, 1977-78, 1983-84, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 2000, 2013\u201314, 2015\u201316 **First official tournament in the Libyan Premier League season 1963-64 **First Cup in the Libyan Premier League Season 1976 **The First Team in Libya To get The Gold Star: 10 Championships **The First Team To Win the Libyan League after 17 February Revolution *Libyan Cup: 6 **Winners 1976, 1994, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2016 *Libyan Super Cup: 2 **Winners 2000 , 2016 ==Performance in CAF competitions== *CAF Champions League: 5 appearance **2000 \u2013 First Round **2009 \u2013 Second Round **2015 \u2013 Preliminary Round **2016 \u2013 Second Round **2017 \u2013 Quarter-finals * African Cup of Champions Clubs: 3 appearances **First Round 1981 **First round 1983 **Quarter-finals 1972 *CAF Cup Winners' Cup: 2 appearance **Runner-up 1984 **Second Round 2002 *CAF Confederation Cup: 5 appearances **Premliminary Round 2007 **Intermediate Round 2009 **First Round 2010 **Premliminary Round 2014 **Group stage 2016 ==Supporter== Ahly is a very popular club.
