    "text": "The Battle of Lyman's Wagon Train was an incident in 1874, near Canadian, Texas. A area at the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 for its information potential as an archeological site. As an archeological resource, the National Register does not disclose the location of the site. The engagement was part of the Red River War. From September 9 to September 14, Wyllys Lyman and his troops fought off Comanche and Kiowa warriors. It is also known as the Battle of the Upper Washita. Tehan, a white member of the Kiowa who was imprisoned by the army, escaped in the event and returned to his Kiowa home. A number of men received U.S. medals of honor for their performance. A historical marker titled \"Wagon Train Battle\" in Hemphill County, Texas commemorates the event. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hemphill County, Texas ==References== ==External links== Category:1874 in Texas Category:Battles involving the Comanche Lyman's Wagon Train Category:Conflicts in 1874 Category:Native American history of Texas Category:Texas\u2013Indian Wars Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hemphill County, Texas Category:Archaeological sites in Texas Category:September 1874 events ",
