    "text": "Lise Marie Morerod Lise-Marie Morerod (born 16 April 1956) is a Swiss former slalom skier. In 1977, she was women's overall season champion. She born in Les Diablerets, Vaud. In 1972, at age 15, she became Swiss champion in giant slalom. Her winning the bronze medal in the slalom race at the FIS Alpine Skiing World Championships was a great surprise because she was an unknown racer. (Best racers wear bib numbers between 1 and 15; she had 39.) It was the only medal won by the Swiss racers at their \"Home World Championships\". At the 1976 Winter Olympics, she took fourth place in the giant slalom but didn't finish the slalom race. She achieved 24 victories and another 17 podiums in World Cup races and was the first Swiss racer to win the Overall World Cup. A car accident in July 1978 left Morerod in a coma for six weeks and led to a six-month hospital stay. The injuries she sustained in the accident left her with long-term memory problems. She returned to the World Cup in 1979, but failed to find her previous form and did not qualify for the 1980 Winter Olympics. She retired after the 1979\u201380 season. ==World Cup victories== ===Overall=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Season!!Discipline |- |1975||Giant Slalom |- |1975||Slalom |- |1976||Giant Slalom |- |1977||Overall |- |1977||Giant Slalom |- |1977||Slalom |} ==Individual races== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Date!!Location!!Race |- |January 4, 1975|| Garmisch-Partenkirchen||Slalom |- |January 29, 1975|| Saint-Gervais||Slalom |- |March 13, 1975|| Sun Valley||Giant Slalom |- |March 20, 1975|| Val Gardena||Slalom |- |December 4, 1975|| Val-d'Is\u00e8re||Giant Slalom |- |December 11, 1975|| Aprica||Slalom |- |January 12, 1976|| Les Diablerets||Slalom |- |January 15, 1976|| Les Gets||Giant Slalom |- |January 25, 1976|| Kranjska Gora||Giant Slalom |- |January 26, 1976|| Kranjska Gora||Slalom |- |March 13, 1976|| Aspen||Giant Slalom |- |December 9, 1976|| Val-d'Is\u00e8re||Giant Slalom |- |December 16, 1976|| Cortina d'Ampezzo||Slalom |- |January 3, 1977|| Oberstaufen||Slalom |- |January 19, 1977|| Schruns||Slalom |- |January 20, 1977|| Arosa||Giant Slalom |- |February 2, 1977|| Maribor||Giant Slalom |- |March 6, 1977|| Sun Valley||Giant Slalom |- |March 24, 1977|| Sierra Nevada||Giant Slalom |- |December 8, 1977|| Val-d'Is\u00e8re||Giant Slalom |- |January 9, 1978|| Les Mosses||Giant Slalom |- |January 19, 1978|| Bad Gastein||Slalom |- |February 9, 1978|| Meg\u00e8ve||Giant Slalom |- |March 7, 1978|| Waterville Valley||Giant Slalom |} == References == == External links == * Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Aigle District Category:Swiss female alpine skiers Category:FIS Alpine Ski World Cup champions Category:Olympic alpine skiers of Switzerland Category:Alpine skiers at the 1976 Winter Olympics ",
