    "text": "Ginger Baker's Air Force is the eponymous debut album by Ginger Baker's Air Force, released in 1970. This album is a recording of a sold-out live show at the Royal Albert Hall, on 15 January 1970, with the original 10-piece line up. The gatefold LP cover was designed left-handed; i.e. the front cover artwork was on what traditionally would be considered the back and vice versa. == Critical reception == The album was not well received by critics, including Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone and Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who found the sound quality \"terrible\" and complained that \"bands led by drummers tend to leave a lot of space for drum solos\". By contrast, Bruce Eder from AllMusic later said the album sounded good for a Royal Albert Hall recording and called it \"a must-own for jazz-rock, Afro-fusion, blues-rock, or percussion fans\". ==Track listing== ===Side one=== # \"Da Da Man\" (Harold McNair) \u2013 7:16 #*Lead vocal by Jeanette Jacobs, organ solo by Stevie Winwood, guitar solo by Denny Laine, sax solo by Graham Bond. # \"Early in the Morning\" (Traditional, arranged by Ginger Baker) \u2013 11:13 #*Lead vocals by Ginger Baker & Denny Laine. ===Side two=== # \"Don't Care\" (Baker, Steve Winwood) \u2013 12:32 #*Lead vocals by Steve Winwood & Jeanette Jacobs. # \"Toad\" (Baker) \u2013 12:59 #*Drum solos by Ginger Baker, Remi Kabaka & Phil Seamen. ===Side three=== # \"Aiko Biaye\" (Remi Kabaka, Teddy Osei) \u2013 13:00 #*Lead Vocals by Graham Bond. # \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" (Traditional, arranged by Denny Laine) \u2013 3:50 #*Lead Vocal by Denny Laine, bass guitar by Steve Winwood, violin by Ric Grech. ===Side four=== # \"Do What You Like\" (Baker) \u2013 11:47 #*Lead vocal by Steve Winwood. # \"Doin' It\" (Baker/Grech) \u2013 5:26 ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== *Ginger Baker \u2013 drums, percussion, timpani, vocals *Denny Laine \u2013 guitars, vocals *Ric Grech \u2013 bass guitar, violin *Steve Winwood \u2013 Hammond organ, bass guitar, vocals *Chris Wood \u2013 tenor saxophone, flute *Graham Bond \u2013 Hammond organ, alto saxophone, vocals *Harold McNair \u2013 tenor and alto saxophones, alto flute *Jeanette Jacobs \u2013 vocals *Remi Kabaka \u2013 drums, percussion *Phil Seamen \u2013 drums, percussion ===Production=== *Ginger Baker \u2013 producer *Jimmy Miller \u2013 producer *Roy Thomas Baker \u2013 engineer *Andy Johns \u2013 engineer *Nigel Williamson \u2013 liner notes *Russ Landau \u2013 reissue coordination ==Charts== Album \u2013 Billboard {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1970 |Pop Albums (US) |align=\"center\"|33 |- |Pop Albums (UK) |align=\"center\"|37 |} Single \u2013 Billboard (UK) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Single !Year !Chart !Position |- |\"Man of Constant Sorrow\" (studio version) |1970liner notes Ginger Baker Do What You Like Compilation album Polydor Chronicles P2-58542 |Pop singles |align=\"center\"|86 |} ==References== Category:Ginger Baker's Air Force albums Category:Albums produced by Jimmy Miller Category:1970 live albums Baker, Ginger Category:Polydor Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Ginger Baker Category:Live albums recorded at the Royal Albert Hall Category:1970 debut albums ",
