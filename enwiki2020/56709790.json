He stood out for the beauty of his voice and the purity of his singing. Nevertheless, he acted coldly and never knew how to enliven the stage. The role which made him most honoured was that of Theseus in \u0152dipe \u00e0 Colone. Chardin was a composer, and we know of him several small operas that he wrote for the , such as: le Pouvoir de la nature, in one act, 1786; la Ruse d\u2019amour, in one act, 1786; le Clavecin, 1787; Clitandre et C\u00e9phise, 1788. In 1787 he had l\u2019Anneau perdu et retrouv\u00e9 performed at the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. He is also known for the music of a melodrama entitled: Annette et Basile. Chardin was one of the first to set music to Florian's romances Estelle and Galat\u00e9e. His oratorio Retour de Tobie was given at the Concert spirituel the same year. Chardin wrote the recitatives of Paisiello's Le Roi Th\u00e9odore \u00e0 Venise,Le Roi Th\u00e9odore \u00e0 Venise on Gallica when this work, translated by Moline, was performed at the Opera on 11 September 1787. It is also necessary to add to the list of his dramatic productions l'Amant sculpteur, op\u00e9ra comique in one act which was performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-comique et lyrique in 1790. When in 1792, Piis and Barr\u00e9 established the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville, they hired Chardin as a \"teacher\" of their young artists, and as a composer and arranger of the music for their plays. This job did not prevent Chardin from continuing to be part of the Opera staff, but it did give him the ability to place a relative, perhaps his brother, J. Chardin, in the orchestra of Vaudeville, where he played the cello parts. Having warmly embraced the party of the Revolution, Chardin was captain of an armed company of the when he died at age thirty- seven. Five days after his death, the vaudevillist Piis sent these verses about Chardin to the Journal des Spectacles : ::Opera loses a good artist, ::Music, a good harmonist, ::Vaudeville a good supporter, ::The god Comus a good guest; ::But what causes everyone a more severe pain, ::The Republic, in him, loses a good citizen. == Sources == * Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis, Biographie universelle des musiciens, Paris, Firmin-Didot, 1881, (). == References == == External links == * Louis-Claude-Armand Chardin, dit Chardiny on Gallica Category:1755 births Category:1793 deaths Category:People from F\u00e9camp Category:French opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:French operatic baritones Category:18th-century French singers ",
