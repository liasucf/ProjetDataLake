The current buildings date from the 1840s and were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1949. ==History== Sor\u00f8 Pharmacy was established on 20 March 1606 by Anders Christensen (1551\u20131606); but he died in November that same year, and a royal license was subsequently not issued to a new pharmacist. Magnus Hosum Klein Joachim Burser, who was a professor at Sor\u00f8 Academy, reopened the pharmacy in January 1631. The pharmacy was continued after Burser's death by his widow, son and grandson. His grandson Johannes Burser chose to close it when he opened the Swan Pharmacy in Slagelse on 30 April 1673. The pharmacy in Sor\u00f8 was reopened by Christian Ludvig Martini on 22 March 1748, and he operated it until his death in 1779. He was succeeded by Magnus Hosum Klein (1745\u20131815), who also served as the town's postmaster. S\u00f8ren Christian \u00d8rsted, the father of Gans Christian \u00d8rsted and Anders Sand\u00f8 \u00d8rsted, acquired the pharmacy in December 1807. The \u00d8rsted family left Sor\u00f8 in 1811\u201312, when \u00d8rsted became a pharmacist in Roskilde. The new owner of Sor\u00f8 Pharmacy was Hans Egede Glahn (1783\u20131874). He ceded it to his son, Heinrich Christopher Glahn (1820\u20131899), in 1850. The latter sold it to Harald Ulrik Viktor Clausen in 1893. ==Building== The pharmacy has been located at the corner of Storgade and Vestergade since the 1780s, but the current building complex dates from the 1840s, when the original half-timbered buildings were rebuilt in brick. It consists of an L-shaped two-storey brick building at the corner, two one-storey side wings and a one-storey rear wing. The buildings surround a central courtyard. The L-shaped main building contained the shop and a residence for the pharmacist. It has large shop windows facing the street. The ceiling of the former dining room was desorated by Christian Dalgaard in the 1890s. The buildings were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1949. == References == ==Further reading== * Emil Dam, Sor\u00f8 Apotek 1606\u20131906 (Sor\u00f8: H. U. V.
