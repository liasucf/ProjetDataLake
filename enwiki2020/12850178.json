    "text": "Slavica is a simple writing system for Serbo-Croatian language proposed by Rajko Igi\u0107 in his 1987 book, Nova Slovarica, published by Universal from Tuzla. The alphabet is a combination of Gaj's Latin and Serbian Cyrillic alphabets and was intended for people from Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that spoke the same language but wrote it using two different writing systems. == Organisation == Slavica uses 17 Latin letters, with 8 Cyrillic letters used in the cases where the native Slavic Latin script uses diacritics and digraphs. Five letters common to both alphabets \u2014 a, e, o, j, and k \u2014 are also used in this new script. Therefore, Slavica follows the principle of one grapheme for one phoneme. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Letter ! IPA sound ! Original alphabet !

According to media articles published in 1987 and 1988, it was especially attractive with people from Bosnia, Vojvodina and Istria. However, strong opposition was noted in these years by the Croatian media. Slavica was discussed both before and after the Yugoslav Wars in daily newspapers including (Ve\u010dernje novosti, Front slobode, Dnevnik, etc.) as well as magazines, such (American Psychologist in 1999; Pregled, Sarajevo, 2005; Prosvjetna poslanica, Tuzla, in 2006), and various online outlets.
