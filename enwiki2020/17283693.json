    "text": "Kongolo Bridge is a cantilever rail and road bridge that crosses the Lualaba River, and is one of only two major bridges (the other being Matadi Bridge) to cross any tributary of the Congo River basin. It was constructed by the Belgians in 1939, and was reconstructed in 1968 under the Mobutu regime by the German engineer Erich F. Weigl. It is located near the town of Kongolo. The width of the Lualaba river is about 440 m, while the main span of the bridge is 70 meters, and has a single 5-meter-wide lane for all traffic, including dual-gauge rails. == See also == * List of road-rail bridges == External links == * Structurae profile Category:Lualaba River Category:Bridges in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Road-rail bridges Category:Bridges over the Congo River ",
