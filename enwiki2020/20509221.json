    "text": "Lone Rhino is the debut solo album by American musician Adrian Belew. The album was recorded following years of Belew playing as a supporting guitarist for Frank Zappa, David Bowie, Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, and shortly after his 1981 debut as the new lead singer, songwriter, and guitarist of King Crimson. It features musicians and repertoire from Belew's pre-King Crimson band, GaGa. A video was produced for the track \"Big Electric Cat\", shot in New York City and opens with a shot of the World Trade Center. Belew's daughter Audie (at the time, four years old) duets with her father on the last track, \"The Final Rhino\" (which was produced when Belew secretly recorded a piano piece improvised by Audie and then added a guitar line). == Track listing == ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== * Adrian Belew \u2013 guitars, effects, drums, percussion, lead vocals, arrangements ===GaGa=== * Christy Bley \u2013 acoustic piano, vocals * William Janssen \u2013 saxophone, vocals * J.
