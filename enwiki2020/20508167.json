Its aim is \"to promote and encourage research and education in all branches of horticultural science and to facilitate cooperation and knowledge transfer on a global scale through its symposia and congresses (International Horticultural Congress), publications and scientific structure.\" Membership is open to all interested researchers, educators, students and horticultural industry professionals. The society dates from 1864, and was formally constituted in 1959. It is based in Leuven, Belgium, and is a founding member of the Global Horticultural Initiative. In 2008, it has over 7,000 members from about 150 countries. ==Publications== These ISHS publications are standard works in the field of horticulture: *Acta Horticulturae is a series of scientific technical publications, mainly the proceedings of ISHS Symposia and the ISHS International Horticultural Congress. All articles (over 42,000) are available online on a paid basis. *Chronica Horticulturae is a quarterly publication sent to ISHS members and other subscribers.
