    "text": "Tenor voice part of Jacob Handl's Ecce quomodo moritur iustus: over a century after its publication \"for use in the Catholic Church\" (\"Catholicae Ecclesiae vsv\") it was a well-known Protestant funeral motet. The righteous perishes are the words with which the 57th chapter of the Book of Isaiah starts.Isaiah 57:1\u20132 in WEB In Christianity, is associated with the death of Christ, leading to liturgical use of the text at Tenebrae: the 24th responsory for Holy Week, \"Ecce quomodo moritur justus\" (See how the just dies), is based on this text. More generally, the text is associated with the death of loved ones and is used at burials. As such, and in other versions and translations, the Bible excerpt has been set to music. ==Responsory \"Ecce quomodo moritur justus\"== \"Ecce quomodo moritur justus\", in the pre-Vatican II Catholic Church the 24th of 27 Tenebrae responsories, or the sixth responsory for Holy Saturday, is based on . In the Tenebrae service of the Holy Week this responsory is preceded by a reading taken from Saint Augustine's Commentary on Psalm 64 (63) \u00a7 13, interpreting (Vulgate Ps. 63:9 \u2013 \"Their own tongues shall ruin them\") in the light of (the soldiers at Jesus' grave bribed to lie about the whereabouts of the corpse).Catholic Church 1875, pp. 400\u2013401Gu\u00e9ranger 1870, pp. 533\u2013534Augustine The Versus of the responsory derives from . {| |- !

The Versus in Handl's setting is different from the Versus of the 24th Tenebrae responsory.Handl {| |- ! Versus (Handl's setting) !

The Episcopal Church provides a single Tenebrae service on Wednesday evening, the day before Maundy Thursday. That service reduces the total number of Tenebrae lessons, each followed by a responsory, to nine. Ecce quomodo moritur is the sixth responsory, and it follows after a reading from Augustine's commentary on Psalm 55 (54).Church Publishing 2004, pp. 74\u201383 ==In Lutheranism== Isaiah 57:1\u20132 was a theme for funeral sermons of the Reformation, among others at a funeral service for Martin Luther in Eisleben.McKee 1999, p. 127Walther 2008, p. 161 It also, along with Isaiah 53 and Isaiah 63: 1-3, was used in the context of the Passion story. ===Handl's Ecce quomodo moritur justus=== Jacob Handl's Ecce quomodo moritur justus motet was sung at Protestant burials in the 16th century.Je\u017c 2007, p. 40 In 1682, Gottfried Vopelius published Handl's motet with a singable German translation (\"Siehe, wie dahin stirbt der Gerechte\") on p. 263 of the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch, for performance on Good Friday.Gottfried Vopelius (editor). Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch. Leipzig: Christoph Klinger, 1682, pp. 263\u2013267. Handl's motet was performed on Good Friday in Protestant churches in Wroc\u0142aw and Leipzig.CPDL The music of Handl's setting, by that time perceived as a Protestant funeral motet,Unger 2010, p. 175 is quoted in George Frideric Handel's Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline, HWV 264.Bartlett 2008, p. IV ===Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um=== Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um, a chorus appearing in a pasticcio Passion oratorio from the early 1750s, has a German version of Isaiah 57:1\u20132 as text.Melamed 1995 pp. 148\u2013149 It is an arrangement attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach of a SSATB setting of Tristis est anima mea, a motet attributed to Johann Kuhnau.Bach Digital The arrangement may have been a stand-alone funeral motet.Morton 1992 {| |- !Luther Bible (1704)Jesaja 57:1\u20132 in Luther Bible (1704) !Motet textKantorei- noten !Translationbased on Isaiah 57:1\u20132 in WEB |- | style=\"padding-left: 2em;\" | | style=\"padding-left: 2em;\" | | style=\"padding-left: 2em;\" | |} ==References== ==Sources== ===Bible quotes=== * Luther Bible (1704): Luther Bible, ed.
