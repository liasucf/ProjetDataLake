    "text": "Mount Grace State Forest is a publicly owned forest with recreational features located in the town of Warwick. The state forest centers around Mount Grace, which at is the third highest point in Massachusetts east of the Connecticut River after Mount Wachusett and Mount Watatic. It is bordered by portions of Warwick State Forest to the east and west and is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. ==History== Mount Grace is said to be named after the baby daughter of Mary Rowlandson, a woman captured by Wompanoag warriors during King Philip's War, who according to legend buried her deceased infant at the foot of the mountain during the march to Canada. By the turn of the 20th century, the mountain had been largely deforested, and conservationists, including former Warwick resident Dr. Paul W. Goldsbury, promoted the idea of having the state purchase it to create a state forest. Picnic and skiing facilities were built beginning in 1930,Charles Morse, Warwick, Massachusetts: Biography of a Town (Cambridge: Dresser, Chapman, and Grimes, 1963), p. 179 after legislation for the purchase passed in 1920. Crews with the Civilian Conservation Corps contributed summer and winter recreational features that included a snowshoeing trail. The summit's fire lookout tower was built in 1939. It is accessible to the public and offers impressive views of the surrounding areas. It is the third tower to have been constructed on Mount Grace. ==Activities and amenities== Forest trails used for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing include a portion of the long-distance Metacomet-Monadnock Trail. The forest also offers picnicking and restricted hunting. ==References== ==External links== *Mount Grace State Forest Department of Conservation and Recreation *Mount Grace State Forest Trail Map Department of Conservation and Recreation Category:Massachusetts state forests Category:Parks in Franklin County, Massachusetts Category:Warwick, Massachusetts Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Massachusetts Category:Protected areas established in 1920 Category:1920 establishments in Massachusetts ",
