The college offers four areas of emphasis: Native American Law, Natural Resources and Environmental Law, Business Law and Entrepreneurship, and Intellectual Property and Technology Law. The college opened its Idaho Law and JusticexLearning Center in Boise in 2010, initially as a third-year program only. Second-year classes were added in 2014.

The Regents recognize the statewide mission of UI for legal education. UI is instructed to re-visit the issue of funding and support for a full dual location model, including a full three (3) year branch curriculum in Boise, to continue collaboration with the Idaho Supreme Court on the Idaho Law Learning Center with respect to those programs to be delivered in Boise, and to return to the Regents for further discussion.http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/meetings/minutes/2008/04_17_08/April16-18_2008%20_APPROVED_minutes.pdf were fully realized in 2017, after the Idaho Board of Education and the ABA approved the addition of first-year courses at the Boise campus. The Boise campus initially accommodated about 35 students annually; with the expansion to a full three-year program, it can now accept up to 60 first-year students. UI's addition of the Boise campus has led the University of South Dakota to consider establishing a second law school campus in Sioux Falls.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The building was constructed in the Art Deco style. Modern style and solid construction were intended to communicate confidence in the government and a positive outlook for the future at a difficult time in US history. ==Scholarly publications== The University of Idaho College of Law currently publishes two legal journals: * Idaho Critical Legal Studies Journalhttp://www.uidaho.edu/law/critical- legal-studies * Idaho Law Reviewhttp://www.uidaho.edu/law/law-review/ ==Alumni== Notable alumni include the current United States Attorney for the District of Idaho, three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, five Federal District Court Judges, three United States Senators, and four United States Representatives. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Law schools in Idaho Category:University of Idaho Category:Educational institutions established in 1909 Category:1909 establishments in Idaho ",
