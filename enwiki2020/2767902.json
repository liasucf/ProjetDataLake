    "text": "Robert \"Robbie\" Shakespeare (born 27 September 1953) is a Jamaican bass guitarist and record producer, best known as the one half of the reggae rhythm section and production duo Sly and Robbie, with drummer Sly Dunbar. Regarded as one of the most influential reggae bassists, Shakespeare is also known for his creative use of electronics and production effects units. He is sometimes nicknamed \"Basspeare\".Hansen, Adam. Shakespeare and Popular Music. Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep. 23, 2010. p. 143. As a part of Sly and Robbie, Shakespeare worked with various reggae artist such as U-Roy, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs, Sugar Minott, Augustus Pablo, Yellowman and Black Uhuru. His production work also extended beyond the reggae genre, covering various pop and rock artists such as Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, Cyndi Lauper, Joe Cocker, Yoko Ono, Serge Gainsbourg and Grace Jones. Prior to his involvement in Sly and Robbie, he was a member of the session groups The Revolutionaries and The Aggrovators. ==Career== Shakespeare grew up in East Kingston, Jamaica. He had a musical family, so that \"his family home was a rehearsal and hangout spot for a variety of upcoming musicians and singers.\" His brother Lloyd had a band called the Emotions which rehearsed in the house. Shakespeare's first instrument was an acoustic guitar that was always present in the home. Later, the band Familyman came into his yard, as it was near a popular location for selling marijuana. Shakespeare had been trying acoustic guitar and drums, but when he heard Familyman's bass player, he was attracted to the deep bass sound. Shakespeare recalled saying \"I wan fi learn how to play this thing [bass]. You haffi teach me\". Even though Familyman's bassist insisted that he was just learning the instrument himself, he agreed to give Shakespeare bass lessons. Shakespeare first went in a music studio when he helped carry his brother Carlie's drums into the studio and set up the drums. This developed into sneaking into the studio and waiting outside as bands recorded. Whenever Familyman recorded, Shakespeare would try to both listen to the session and watch the bass player's hands; then afterwards, the bassist would show Shakespeare the basslines that had been recorded in person at Shakespeare's family house. Shakespeare then studied electric bass with Aston Barrett, the bass player from the Upsetters.The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll. Third Edition. Edited by Holly George-Warren and Patricia Romanowski. Fireside, a Rolling Stone Press Book. London. 2001 He collaborated with the drummer Sly Dunbar for the first time when they played in the Channel One Studio house band, which was called The Revolutionaries. After Barrett joined the Wailers, Shakespeare took over the bass role in Barrett's former group, Hippy Boys. In 1974, Shakespeare and Dunbar started an independent music production company and record label called Taxi Records.
