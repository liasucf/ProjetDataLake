    "text": "Avalanche Gorge The Trail of the Cedars is a hiking trail accessible from Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, Montana. The path is paved and has a raised boardwalk in some sections. Some of the cedars visible are over tall. The trail splits into two sections: one loops, while the other continues to Avalanche Lake which can reached after a hike with a elevation gain. In the middle of the half loop is a beautiful waterfall that has carved through colorful rock to make a channeled stream. ==References== Category:Going-to- the-Sun Road Category:Protected areas of Flathead County, Montana Category:Hiking trails in Montana Category:Glacier National Park (U.S.) Category:Flora of Montana ",
