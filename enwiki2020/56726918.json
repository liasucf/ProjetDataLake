P. victori is sexually dimorphic, with males appearing much more slender, legs matching the green coloration of the carapace, and red abdomen. Like other species in the genus Psalmopoeus, the species lacks urticating hairs. This species is extremely reclusive, when searching at night, the time tarantulas are most active, it can still prove difficult to observe any specimen. When they are found, it is usually in tree cavities at a medium height. == Etymology == The specific name is a patronym in honor of V\u00edctor H. Jim\u00e9nez Arcos, a Mexican herpetologist who saw and collected the first specimen of the species. == References == Category:Theraphosidae Category:Spiders described in 2014 ",
