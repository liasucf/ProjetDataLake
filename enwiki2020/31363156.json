    "text": "Diego are an Indie rock band from Karlsruhe, Germany, formed in 2005. == History == After their formation in 2005, the band released eight songs on a self-titled EP in 2007 via Rookie Records. In April 2008 the first full-length studio Album Two was recorded which was published on 31 October 2008 by Noisedeluxe Records. The album received a favourable review from the Plattentests.de webzine that noted a melancholic and longing mood in the songs. The Sonic Seducer wrote about a \"cool elegance\" of this album and highlighted the guitar arrangements. In 2010 Diego met with producer Kurt Ebelh\u00e4user to record the second album Gold. It was released on 24 September 2010 via Unter Schafen Records. The Intro magazine called it \"generally a step ahead\" but also criticised Diego for again being too arbitrary, for showing too less characteristics and rough edges. Sonic Seducer though lauded the increasing use of basslines and called it a work of Post-punk \"with a throaty voice and twirling guitars\" which style was allegedly rare in Germany. Also the Motor.de webzine commented that Diego had a style of their own. ==Style== Diego play Indie rock with influences from New Wave and are often compared to bands like Joy Division, Editors and Interpol. In case of the album Two these similarities have even led to repeated accusations of plagiarism. ==Discography== ===EP=== *Diego (2007), Rookie ===Albums=== *Two (2008), Noisedeluxe *Gold (2010), Unter Schafen == References == == External links == * Category:German indie rock groups ",
