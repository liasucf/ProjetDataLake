He served in the War of American Independence. == Biography == P\u00e9russe des Cars was born to Marie-Fran\u00e7oise-Victoire de Verthamon and to Fran\u00e7ois de P\u00e9russe des Cars, Lieutenant-General governor or Limousin. He joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine in 1754. He was promoted to Ensign in 1757 and to Lieutenant in 1765. In 1772, he was given command of the 32-gun frigate Z\u00e9phyr, Brest. He was promoted to Captain in April 1777. In 1780, he captained the frigate Prudente, cruising from Saint-Servan to Saint-Malo, Cherbourg and Brest. After Prudente was in battle, Des Cars had an interview with Louis XVI. On 22 June 1779, Prudente was captured by the 64-gun HMS Ruby and HMS Aeolus. In March 1781, he was promoted to the command of the 74-gun Glorieux, in the squadron under De Grasse. Des Cars placed himself on a shroud of his ship to better direct the battle. In the opening of the battle, at 0900, he was wounded by a musket ball, and had to climb down to the deck, where he continued to command. He was then mortally wounded by a large-calibre musket ball, and died shortly afterwards. Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessy assumed command. Des Cars' defence of Glorieux was later lauded in the subsequent inquiry into the battle. Des Cars had married Louis-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Buttet in Saint- Domingue. He was a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis. == Sources and references == Notes Citations Bibliography * * * * * * External links * Category:French Navy officers Category:French military personnel of the American Revolutionary War ",
