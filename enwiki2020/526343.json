He was a proponent of formalist film theory. ==Career== Bal\u00e1zs was the son of Simon Bauer and Eug\u00e9nia L\u00e9wy, adopting his nom de plume in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Collegium. Bal\u00e1zs was a moving force in the Sonntagskreis or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos F\u00fclep, Arnold Hauser, Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs and K\u00e1roly (Karl) Mannheim. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Bal\u00e1zs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.Mary Gluck (1985) Georg Luk\u00e1cs and His Generation, 1900\u20131918. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. . pp. 14\u201316 He is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of Bluebeard's Castle which he originally wrote for his roommate Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly, who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet The Wooden Prince. The collapse of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic under B\u00e9la Kun in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union. In 1922, Bal\u00e1zs published Mantel der Tr\u00e4ume (translated and published in English as The Cloak of Dreams: Chinese Fairy Tales in 2010). The book, lauded by Thomas Mann as a \"beautiful book,\" is a collection of strange, sometimes chilling, fairy tales. In Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, Der sichtbare Mensch (The Visible Man) (1924), helped found the German \"film as a language\" theory, which also exerted an influence on Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for G. W. Pabst's film of Die Dreigroschenoper (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by Brecht (who admitted to not reading the script) during production. Later, he co-wrote (with Carl Mayer) and helped Leni Riefenstahl direct the film Das blaue Licht (1932).1931 \u201ethe blue light\u201c. walter-riml.at Riefenstahl later removed Bal\u00e1zs's and Mayer's names from the credits because they were Jewish.Hanno Loewy: \"Balazs' and Leni Riefenstahl's The blue Light.

His last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in Hungary, the Kossuth Prize. Also in 1949, he finished Theory of the Film, published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in cinematography. ==Selected filmography== * Modern Marriages (1924) * Madame Wants No Children (1926) * One Plus One Equals Three (1927) * The Girl with the Five Zeros (1927) * Grand Hotel (1927) * Do\u00f1a Juana (1927) * Sunday of Life (1931) ==See also== * Ballets by B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs * Film semiotics ==References== == External links == * * * * * * Article on the relationship between Riefenstahl and Balazs * B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs on Jewish.hu's list of famous Hungarian Jews Category:1884 births Category:1949 deaths Category:People from Szeged Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Hungarian male poets Category:Ballet librettists Category:Film theorists Category:Hungarian critics Category:Hungarian film critics Category:Philosophers of art Category:Jewish writers Category:Burials at Kerepesi Cemetery Category:20th-century Hungarian poets Category:20th-century Hungarian male writers Category:Hungarian people of German descent ",
