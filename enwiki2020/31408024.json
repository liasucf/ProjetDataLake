    "text": "Located in Warren in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, Warren Area Elementary Center (WAEC) was built in the 2000s, and its grand opening was in 2005 (2005-06 school year). WAEC is the area's sole public elementary school besides South Street Early Learning Center (SSELC), which currently teaches kindergarten and first grades. The school has about 900 students. The WAEC mascot is a dragon. WAEC is located on the Warren Area High School (WAHS) campus, along with the high school itself and Warren County Career Center (WCCC). This school opened due to the shutdown of former elementary schools, such as Jefferson, Home Street, Market Street, North Warren and Pleasant Elementary Schools. WAEC has two stories as well as a possible basement, and consists of a gymnasium, cafeteria, auditorium, courtyard, library, lobby, two playgrounds and much more. It has grades 2-5, while SSELC has kindergarten and first grades. The class of 2013 was the first class to graduate from this school (even though they only went there for one year). WAEC is owned and operated by the Warren County School District.
