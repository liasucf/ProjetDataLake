    "text": "Sister Joana Ang\u00e9lica de Jesus, registered as Joanna Angelica de Jesus (December 12, 1761 \u2013 February 19, 1822) was a Brazilian Conceptionist nun, belonging to the Reformed Order of Our Lady of Conception, and martyr of the Brazilian Independence.http://www2.camara.leg.br/a-camara/visiteacamara/cultura-na- camara/arquivos/mulheres-pioneiras-elas-fizeram-historia Born during the colonial period, she died at age 60, stabbed by a bayonet blow when resisting the invasion of the Convent of Lapa, in Salvador, by Portuguese troops. She became, thus, the first heroine of the independence of Brazil.http://www2.camara.leg.br/a-camara/visiteacamara/cultura-na- camara/arquivos/dois-de-julho-2014-a-independencia-do-brasil-na-bahia The nun became known as saying the famous phrase: \u201cPara tr\u00e1s, bandidos! Respeitai a casa de Deus! S\u00f3 entrar\u00e3o passando por cima do meu cad\u00e1ver! (Back off, bandits! Respect the house of God. You will only get in over my dead body!)\u201d. However, an extensive document search concerning the life of Joana Angelica found no evidence that the phrase was in fact uttered by the sister.http://www.filologia.org.br/xv_cnlf/tomo_2/161.pdf == Early life and ordination == She was the daughter of Jos\u00e9 Tavares de Almeida and Catarina Maria da Silva, a rich family from Salvador. She was baptized at Freguezia da Santa F\u00e9, at the Bahian capital. She was 20 years old when she was accepted, as an exception, to her novitiate in the Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa in 1782. Her profession of faith was made on May 18, 1783, when she joined the Order of the Reformed Religious of Our Lady of the Conception and was renamed Joana Angelica de Jesus. She remained secluded there for 20 years, and was a scribe, mistress of novices, counselor, vicar, and finally abbess, until her death. == Attack to the convent == left There are two conflicting versions of the episode of the attack on the Convent of Lapa. For the Brazilian historian Bernardino Jos\u00e9 de Souza, the Portuguese version, sponsored mainly by the Portuguese historian Jos\u00e9 d'Arriaga, has no support in documents. According to d'Ariaga's report, agents of the reactionary (pro- Independence) party had hidden in the convent and shot the soldiers inside the building. Brazilian historians, however, say that Portuguese troops broke in several buildings, practicing robberies and even deaths, under the pretext that shots had left from within a certain place; as had happened with the convent. The newspaper Di\u00e1rio da Bahia published in its edition of July 2, 1936, a complete report on the attack on the convent and the sister's martyrdom. It contains a description of the political crisis and excesses committed by the Portuguese soldiers:http://hdl.handle.net/bv2julho/245 > The city is surprised by the designation of Madeira de Mello for the > commando of the Arms of the Province. Victorious, the commanders of Madeira > seize the city (...) hatred and revenge. Fires and looting. Savagery and > homicides. A solid colonial construction, still existing in the capital of Bahia, the Convent of Lapa consists of a cloister, whose main entrance is garrisoned by an iron gate. A group of soldiers tried to break into the gate while Joanna Angelica ordered the sisters to flee from the back. In order to protect the cloister and integrity of the sisters, Ang\u00e9lica was placed as a last obstacle between the convent and the Portuguese troops. ==Resting place== The remains of Joana Ang\u00e9lica are found at the Convent of Lapa in close proximity to her place of death. A memorial housing her remains is located in a room to the rear of the name of the convent. ==Access== The Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne and memorial to Joana Ang\u00e9lica are open to the public and may be visited; the convent and the site of martyrdom of Joana Ang\u00e9lica are now a school and are closed to the public. == References == Category:1822 deaths Category:1761 births Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:People from Salvador, Bahia ",
