Having scored 5 goals in 19 league appearances it was reported that at one stage during 2010 Porta was a recruiting target for Sydney FC. ====2011\u20132012 season==== =====Loan to Al Wasl===== After five games of the Torneo Apertura, in October 2011, Porta announced that he was joining Diego Maradona in his new club Al Wasl FC in Dubai, the UAE. After three months in the Emirates, he returned to Nacional as his contract with Al Wasl was terminated. Even though he missed many games while in Al Wasl, Porta ended the Campeonato Uruguayo as the highest scorer with 17 goals in 16 games, including two consecutive hattricks, against Cerrito and Bella Vista. ===Dubai Club=== On 11 July 2012, it was reported that Porta had rejected an offer in England in favour of a two-year multimillion-dollar contract with UAE Pro- League side Dubai Club.http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/news/1112806/Porta- heads-to-the- UAEhttp://www.unoticias.com.uy/articulos/articulos_masinfo.php?id=8483&secc;=articulos&cr;=&path;=0.284 ===Independiente del Valle=== On 1 August 2014, Porta signed on to play with Ecuadorian Serie A club Independiente del Valle for the remainder of the season.http://www.futbolizados.com/30410/el-uruguayo-richard-porta-es-nuevo- jugador-del-independiente-del- valle/http://www.futbolecuador.com/stories/publica/46551 ===Rentistas=== Upon his departure from Independiente del Valle, Porta signed with Uruguayan football clubhttp://www.futbol.com.uy/auc.aspx?261830,1107 ==International career== In 1999 Porta was called up to a one-week training camp for the Australia U-17 team in Montevideo but was not selected for the squad that went on to claim silver medals at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Cup in New Zealand. Porta then went on to represent the Uruguay U-20 squad at the 2003 South American Youth Championship held in Uruguay where he scored in Uruguay's 4\u20131 win against Bolivia on 13 January. During 2006 and 2007 Porta was twice drafted into a home-based squad for the Uruguay national team without being capped, first in March 2006 for a friendly against Saudi Arabia which was later suspended and then in September 2007 for a friendly against South Africa where he was an un-used substitute. On 21 December 2007 it was reported by The Age that Porta, despite not speaking English, had stated that if someone from Australia asked him then he would not rule out \"wearing the green and gold\" for the Australia national side under coach Pim Verbeek. By 16 January 2008 it was again reported by The Age that Pim Verbeek was poised to invite Porta to join the squad for Australia's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. On 3 April 2011 it was reported that Porta, having been ignored by Australia's former coach Pim Verbeek, declared that he would consider playing for Australia should someone ask him first. Despite a chronic shortage of strikers leading up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it was reported that Verbeek became increasingly agitated whenever questioned about Porta's claims to represent the national side when Verbeek stated that Porta never officially contacted the FFA to express his interest in playing for Australia. However, Holger Osieck looked to have re-opened the door for Porta, to prepare for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, as Osieck's staff began to monitor Porta's progress following his switch from River Plate to Nacional. Osieck considered inviting Porta to Australia's training camp in Germany during April. Having become disillusioned by his treatment from Verbeek, Porta regained enthusiasm to play for Australia as his brother, Gonzalo, who lives in Sydney stated that Porta knew Osieck was a more serious coach than Verbeek and that he definitely wanted to play for Australia hoping that his chance would come soon. On 7 November, Holger Osieck stated in an interview that the paperwork to officially enable Richard to play for Australia was underway and that clarification from The Uruguayan FA and FIFA was imminent. This should ensure El Canguro is eligible to play for the Socceroos despite the fact that he has played for the Uruguay U-20 team.http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/osieck-opens-up-on- squad-and-porta/52213 As of May 2017, Porta has yet to be capped by either the Uruguayan or Australian national teams. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Porta effectively cut ties with the Australian national team; this came after he was repeatedly stood up by the FFA, despite clearly voicing his interest in playing for Australia. ==Personal life== Although Porta and his parents moved back to Uruguay shortly after his birth, Porta's maternal grandparents, cousins and his brother still live in Sydney. Porta declared his allegiance to Australia during the decisive 2006 FIFA World Cup CONMEBOL \u2013 OFC qualification play-off between Australia and Uruguay when he appeared as a television studio guest in Montevideo wearing a green and gold shirt. Porta is nicknamed 'El Canguro', translating to 'Kangaroo' in Spanish. During his period in Siena he thought to take the Italian citizenship because his maternal grandfather is Italian. ==Honours== ===Club=== ; Club Nacional de Football *Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2 ** 2011 Torneo Clausura **2010-11 Campeonato Uruguayo ** 2011 Torneo Apertura **2011-12 Campeonato Uruguayo ===Individual=== *Primera Divisi\u00f3n Uruguaya Golden Boot: **2007 Torneo Apertura: 19 Goals **2012 Torneo Clausura: 14 Goals **2011-12 Campeonato Uruguayo: 17 Goals ==References== ==External links== * OzFootball profile * AC Siena profile Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Australian soccer players Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Uruguay under-20 international footballers Category:River Plate Montevideo players Category:Club Nacional de Football players Category:Robur Siena players Category:C.F.
