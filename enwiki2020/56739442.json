    "text": "Matthew Elias Corbally (April 1797 \u2013 25 November 1870) was an Irish Liberal, Whig and Independent Irish Party politician. ==Family== Corbally was the son of Elias Corbally and Mary n\u00e9e Keogh. He married Matilda Margaret Preston, daughter of Jenico Preston and Margaret Southwell, in 1842. They had one child, Mary Margaret Corbally (1845\u20131925). They lived at Corbalton Hall in County Meath. Corbally and his wife are buried in a sealed vault at Saint Colmcille's Church, Skryne. ==Political career== Corbally was first elected unopposed as a Whig-Radical MP for Meath at a by-election in 1840 but he did not stand for re-election at the next general election in 1841. When Daniel O'Connell was elected for both Meath and County Cork a by-election was called at which Corbally was again elected as a Whig unopposed. He then held the seat for the remainder of his life in 1870, joining the Independent Irish Party shortly after the general election in 1852 and joining the Liberal Party when it was formed in 1859. He was a supporter of the abolition of tithes, reform of corporations, and reform of the ballot, and was opposed to privileges being given to the Bank of Ireland. ==Other activities== Corbally was also a Justice of the Peace and, in 1838, he was High Sheriff of Meath. He was also a captain in the Royal Meath Regiment. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1797 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Irish Liberal Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1837\u20131841 Category:UK MPs 1841\u20131847 Category:UK MPs 1847\u20131852 Category:UK MPs 1852\u20131857 Category:UK MPs 1857\u20131859 Category:UK MPs 1859\u20131865 Category:UK MPs 1865\u20131868 Category:High Sheriffs of Meath Category:Politicians from County Meath Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Meath constituencies (1801\u20131922) ",
