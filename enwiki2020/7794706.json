    "text": "The name Cater is part of the ancient legacy of the Stone-Age tribes of Great Britain. The name was taken on by someone who worked as a caterer. The surname Cater was official name, \"the cater\", derived from the Old French ale catour, a little meaning a buyer of groceries for the gentleman's house. They were in charge of maintaining provisions in minors and castles. The cater's job assumed a great importance during extended sieges of his lord's castle, which could last for years. English: occupational name for the buyer of provisions for a large household, from a reduced form of Anglo-Norman French acatour (Late Latin acceptator, an agent derivative of acceptare \u2018to accept\u2019). Modern English caterer results from the addition of a second agent suffix to the word. Slovenian (Cater): status name for a person who read out the Slovenian ceremonial text at the installation of the Carantanian rulers and, later, Carinthian dukes, derived from the dialect verb catiti \u2018to read\u2019. Carantania was the early medieval Slovenian state on the territory of present-day Carinthia and Styria, now divided between Austria and Slovenia. The people's installation of the Carantanian rulers was an exceptional example of democratic elections in medieval Europe. Thomas Jefferson knew about it and was influenced by it in his thinking about American Independence. Perhaps also an Americanized spelling of German K\u00f6ter. This family is also spread to the other countries for several reasons: the conquest of the British in other continents such as Asia, and another family moving overseas, especially America where so many this family living in that country. ==History== The name was brought into England in the wake of the Norman Conquest.
