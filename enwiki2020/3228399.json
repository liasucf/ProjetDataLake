According to the 2001 census it had a population of 428 in 186 households, the population increasing to 442 at the 2011 Census. ==History== Originally, Bergh Apton was two separate villages; Apton to the north-west and Bergh to the south-east, each with its own church. Apton was served by the church of St. Martin which lay near the present day Church Farm on Dodgers Lane, its last recorded use being in 1555 and the remains being finally cleared in 1834. Bergh was served by the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul which stands on a low hill overlooking the River Chet which marks the southern boundary of the now combined parish. The church appears to have been reconstructed in the 14th century, with local flint with ashlar and brick details. ==Today== The village school was closed in 1981 and the children transferred to Alpington and Bergh Apton CofE voluntary-aided school in Alpington. The village shop and Post Office closed on 31 December 2012. In August 2015 the Post Office reopened its Bergh Apton branch within the Green Pastures Plant Centre and Farm Shop on Mill Road. The village hall, opened on the day of Queen Elizabeth's coronation on 2 June 1953 was totally refurbished in 2013 and reopened in November of that year with new facilities and all- ability access. The hall is regularly used by village societies, the Parish Council, and numerous activities that include a microscopy study group, yoga, painting, singing and dog-training. Bergh Apton is served by bus route 570 operated by Konectbus providing five services a day into Norwich and out to Seething and Loddon.Anglian Coaches Timetable Timetable ==Sculpture Trail and Mystery Plays== Beginning in 1997 and repeated in 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011, the village hosted six sculpture trails with works from over 60 artists both local to Norfolk and from across the UK, displayed in private gardens and public places. The trails were organised by Bergh Apton Community Arts Trust and became significant South Norfolk tourist attractions. In the years 2005, 2008 and 2011, they drew over 10,000 visitors over three weekends in late May/early June. During the 2011 Sculpture Trail, the village, with assistance from the Bishop of Norwich, performed \u201cA Mighty Water\u201d. This Mystery Play, based on the story of Noah, was commissioned from internationally renowned story teller, Hugh Lupton. In May and June 2014, Bergh Apton was joined by inhabitants of 11 neighbouring villages to perform a Cycle of four Mystery Plays based on the Bible stories in the Legend of the Rood, also commissioned from Hugh Lupton. ==See also== *Bergh Apton Anglo-Saxon cemetery ==References== ==External links== *Bergh Apton website *2002/5 Sculpture Trail on Flickr Category:Villages in Norfolk Category:Sculpture gardens, trails and parks in the United Kingdom Category:Civil parishes in Norfolk ",
