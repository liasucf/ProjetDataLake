    "text": "Freddy Eusebio Rinc\u00f3n Valencia (; born 14 August 1966) is a retired Colombian footballer who played 84 games for the Colombia national team between 1990 and 2001. A versatile midfielder he was capable of playing on the left, in the centre or as an attacking midfielder. ==Club career== Rinc\u00f3n began his career at Atl\u00e9tico Buenaventura in 1986. He also played for Independiente Santa F\u00e9, Am\u00e9rica de Cali (Colombia), Napoli (Italy), Real Madrid (Spain), Palmeiras, Santos, and Corinthians (Brazil). For Am\u00e9rica de Cali won the Colombian Championship in 1990 and 1992. It was his combination with Faustino Asprilla in the 5\u20130 demolition of Argentina in the 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign that prompted Parma to sign the Colombian midfielder. However the three foreigner rule meant he was loaned out to Napoli, and was eventually sold onto Real Madrid. Rinc\u00f3n spent the latter part of his career playing club football in Brazil where he played for Palmeiras, Corinthians, Santos and Cruzeiro. During his time with Corinthians the club won the Brazilian championship in 1998 and 1999 and the first FIFA Club World Cup in 2000, his greatest title. ==International career== Rinc\u00f3n scored 17 goals in 84 caps for the Colombian national team, playing in the 1990, 1994, and 1998 World Cups. His most important and most memorable goal is the one he scored against West Germany in Milan, Italy on June 19 during the 1990 World Cup. Playing into injury time, Colombia needed a goal to draw the game and avoid elimination from the tournament at the group stages. When played through by a pass from Carlos Valderrama, Rincon held his nerve and calmly fired the ball through the legs of the German goalkeeper to secure the draw his team needed. During a qualifying match for the 1994 FIFA World Cup on September 5, 1993 against Argentina, he scored the first goal of the game receiving the ball from teammate Carlos Valderrama and passing the Argentine goalkeeper, Sergio Goycochea, before scoring. ===International goals=== Scores and results lists Colombia's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style= |- !
