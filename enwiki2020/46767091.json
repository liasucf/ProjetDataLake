It was a separate municipality but was amalgamated with Racib\u00f3rz in 1975. == History == The village was mentioned already in 1223. It became a seat of a Catholic parish in \u017bory deanery of Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, established probably in the second half of the 13th century, first mentioned in 1335 as Birkindorf in an incomplete register of Peter's Pence payment composed by Galhard de Carceribus. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Opole and Racib\u00f3rz, within feudally fragmentated Poland, ruled by a local branch of the Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the Upper Silesian duchies became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Silesian Wars it became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. After World War I in the Upper Silesia plebiscite 733 out of 1,444 voters (plus 5 out of 40 in manor goods) in Brzezie voted in favour of joining Poland, against 707 (plus 35 in manor goods) opting for staying in Germany. In 1922 it became a part of Silesian Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic. It lay on the border with Germany, where Racib\u00f3rz stayed. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods in Silesian Voivodeship Category:Racib\u00f3rz County ",
