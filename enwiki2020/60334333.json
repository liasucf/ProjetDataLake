In 1928, Kavanagh was part of the Easts side which claimed the minor premiership and reached the grand final against Souths who were looking for their 4th premiership in a row. Kavanagh played at second-row as Easts were comprehensively beaten 26\u20135 in the final which was played at the Royal Agricultural Society Grounds in front of 25,000 people. Kavanagh played on in 1929 before retiring at the end of the season.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players.
