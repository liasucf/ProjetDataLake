    "text": "Heart Break is the seventh studio album by American country pop trio Lady Antebellum. It was released on June 9, 2017, through Capitol Records Nashville. The album serves as the \"spiritual follow-up\" to 2010's Need You Now and is their first release since 2014's 747, with its three-year gap being the longest between two albums by the group to date. \"You Look Good\" was released in January 2017 as the record's lead single and has since become the group's thirteenth top 10 single on the Hot Country Songs chart. ==Background== In 2015, Lady Antebellum began experiencing declining success with the singles released from their sixth studio album, 747 (2014), which the band attributes to a \"fatigue\" amongst fans and radio programmers. After the completion of their accompanying Wheels Up Tour, the group announced a short hiatus from both recording and touring. During this time, the members all worked on individual projects - Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott on their solo debuts The Driver and Love Remains, respectively, and Dave Haywood on the production of Post Monroe's debut EP. When the group returned to work on their next album, they spent a month in Los Angeles, California and recruited pop producer busbee to oversee the project. The album was written and recorded primarily in Florida and California, due to the group feeling creatively stifled in Nashville. ==Singles== \"You Look Good\" was released to digital retailers on January 19, 2017, as the album's first single. The song impacted American country radio on January 23. \"You Look Good\" scored a \"hot shot debut\" of number 27 on the Country Airplay chart dated February 4, 2017, and has since peaked within the top 20. The song entered the Hot Country Songs chart at number 41. Following the group's performance of the single at the 2016 ACM Awards on April 2, 2017, \"You Look Good\" rose twelve positions to number 9 (on the chart dated April 22, 2017). This earned Lady Antebellum their thirteenth top 10 hit on that chart, and first since \"Bartender\" in 2014. The song rose to number 8 on the Hot Country Songs chart (on the chart dated July 1, 2017). On the chart dated July 15, 2017, \"You Look Good\" rose into the top 10 of the Country Airplay chart. It has since peaked at number 4. The title track, \"Heart Break\", was released as a digital promotional single on May 12, 2017. It was released to American country radio stations on September 25, 2017, as the second official single. ===Promotional singles=== The second promotional single, \"Somebody Else's Heart\", was released on May 19, 2017. The third promotional single, \"This City\", was released on May 26, 2017. The fourth promotional single, \"Hurt\", was released on June 2, 2017. ==Reception== ===Commercial performance=== Heart Break debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 with 53,000 album-equivalent units, of which 47,000 were pure album sales. It has sold 170,200 copies as of December 2018. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! Year ! Association ! Category !
