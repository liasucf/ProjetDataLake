    "text": "Javier \"Javi\" Gracia Carlos (; born 1 May 1970) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a defensive midfielder, and the current manager of Valencia. He played 430 matches both major levels of Spanish football combined, during a 15-year professional career. After retiring he began working as a manager, going on to coach several clubs in Spain, Greece and Russia before being appointed at Watford in January 2018. Gracia led Watford to the second FA Cup final in their history in 2019, but was sacked later the same year. ==Playing career== Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Gracia started playing professionally with Bilbao Athletic, Athletic Bilbao's reserves, never appearing officially for the first team during three years. In the 1992\u201393 campaign, he scored a career-best 12 goals in all 38 games as UE Lleida returned to La Liga after an absence of more than 40 years, as champions. Gracia spent the following six seasons in the top flight, appearing regularly for both Real Valladolid and Real Sociedad until his last year (15 matches, one goal). In 1999, he returned to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and signed for Villarreal CF, helping the Valencian club get promoted to the top division after one year and being regularly used in the following campaign \u2013 1,765 minutes of action \u2013 as the team retained their division status. In February 2003, after being scarcely played in his last one and a half seasons at Villarreal, the 32-year-old Gracia joined C\u00f3rdoba CF in the second level, closing out his career in June of the following year. He appeared in 229 Spanish top-tier games over the course of nine seasons, netting 17 goals. ==Coaching career== After starting his managerial career with the youth sides of his former club Villarreal, Gracia spent in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, with Pontevedra CF, finishing first and second with the team in the regular season, but always falling short in the promotion playoffs. In 2008\u201309, still in the third division, Gracia finally achieved promotion, now with C\u00e1diz CF, but he was fired midway through the following season as the Andalusians were immediately relegated. In the 2010\u201311 campaign, with Villarreal's reserves, he managed to avert a drop also in the second tier. After one year in Greece, Gracia returned to his country, leading UD Almer\u00eda back to the top flight in 2013 but leaving in June after failing to agree new terms. On 4 September of that year he was appointed at CA Osasuna, replacing fired Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar. On 30 May 2014, Gracia was named the new manager of M\u00e1laga CF. During his two-year tenure, he led the team to the ninth and eighth position, respectively. Before the start of the 2016\u201317 season, Gracia joined FC Rubin Kazan. After only achieving a ninth-place finish in the Russian Premier League, he left the club by mutual consent. On 21 January 2018, Gracia was named the new head coach of Premier League club Watford on an 18-month contract following the dismissal of Marco Silva. His first game in charge took place six days later, in a 0\u20131 away loss against Southampton for the fourth round of the FA Cup. In the 2018\u201319 campaign, Gracia again coached the team to domestic league safety, also taking them to the final of the FA Cup for the first time in 35 years, and for only the second time in the club's history. He was sacked on 7 September 2019, after a poor start to the season saw them bottom with just one point. Gracia returned to Spain's top division on 27 July 2020, agreeing to a two-year deal at Valencia CF. ==Personal life== Gracia's parents were both teachers. He is married with three sons, two of whom are twins. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record !rowspan=2| |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Pontevedra |align=left|20 March 2007 |align=left|30 June 2008 | |- |align=left|C\u00e1diz |align=left|11 July 2008 |align=left|9 January 2010 | |- |align=left|Villarreal B |align=left|24 June 2010 |align=left|12 May 2011 | |- |align=left|Olympiacos Volou |align=left|7 June 2011 |align=left|24 August 2011 | |- |align=left|Kerkyra |align=left|14 November 2011 |align=left|28 March 2012 | |- |align=left|Almer\u00eda |align=left|12 June 2012 |align=left|28 June 2013 | |- |align=left|Osasuna |align=left|4 September 2013 |align=left|30 May 2014 | |- |align=left|M\u00e1laga |align=left|30 May 2014 |align=left|24 May 2016 | |- |align=left|Rubin Kazan |align=left|27 May 2016 |align=left|8 June 2017 | |- |align=left|Watford |align=left|21 January 2018 |align=left|7 September 2019 | |- |align=left|Valencia |align=left|27 July 2020 |align=left|Present | |- !colspan=3|Career total !\u2014 |} ==Honours== ===Player=== Lleida *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1992\u201393 ===Manager=== Pontevedra *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B: 2006\u201307 C\u00e1diz *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B: 2008\u201309 Watford *FA Cup runner-up: 2018\u201319 Individual *Premier League Manager of the Month: August 2018 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Pamplona Category:Spanish footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:UE Lleida players Category:Real Valladolid players Category:Real Sociedad footballers Category:Villarreal CF players Category:C\u00f3rdoba CF players Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spain under-21 international footballers Category:Spanish football managers Category:La Liga managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:Pontevedra CF managers Category:C\u00e1diz CF managers Category:Villarreal CF B managers Category:UD Almer\u00eda managers Category:CA Osasuna managers Category:M\u00e1laga CF managers Category:Valencia CF managers Category:Super League Greece managers Category:Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C. managers Category:PAE Kerkyra managers Category:Russian Premier League managers Category:FC Rubin Kazan managers Category:Premier League managers Category:Watford F.C. managers Category:Spanish expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Greece Category:Expatriate football managers in Russia Category:Expatriate football managers in England Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Russia Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in England ",
