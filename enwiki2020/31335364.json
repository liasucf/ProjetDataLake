    "text": "The Walther Collection is an art foundation dedicated to the critical understanding of historical and contemporary photography and related media. Through a program of international exhibitions, in-depth collections, original research, and scholarly publications, The collection aims to highlight the social uses of photography and to expand the history of the medium. The Walther Collection retains a three-gallery museum campus in Neu-Ulm, Germany, a Project Space in New York City, and produces an expansive traveling exhibition program worldwide. The collection's exhibitions put in dialogue selective oeuvres of key European and American photography alongside expansive holdings of African photography and video art, with contemporary Chinese and Japanese photography and media art, and vernacular photographic imagery from across the globe. The collection's exhibition program is complemented by public lectures and screenings, international scholarly symposia, and a critically acclaimed series of catalogs and monographs co-published with Steidl. == The Collection == The Walther Collection is defined by its desire to establish a cross-cultural discourse in the fields of photography and media art, ranging across temporal and geographical differences to instigate in- depth analysis of the relationship between the history of the photographic medium and notions of subjectivity and social identity. By pairing works from African or Asian artists with that of their western counterpoints, The Walther Collection reimagines the poetic and political dimensions of the global photographic archive, with its diverse histories and changing meanings. Such an approach allows the collection to offer new perspectives on the legacy of anthropological and ethnographic visions of the Other. Featuring historical imagery alongside modern and contemporary works, and including select pairings with practitioners from across the globe, The Walther Collection puts forth a nuanced consideration of the ways that photography has provided a structure for exploring the bounds of identity across chronological, spatial, cultural, and social contexts. With over 15,000 works, the Walther Collection is considered one of the most significant holdings of contemporary Chinese, African, and vernacular photography in the world. The Walther Collection was founded on a nucleus of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) photographers such as August Sander and Karl Blossfeldt, and the industrial photographs of Bernd and Hilla Becher.[3]Central to the beginnings of the collection also include contemporary German artists Thomas Ruff, Candida H\u00f6fer, and Thomas Struth, all students of the Bechers. The methodological documentary approach favored by the artists of the school of Neue Sachlichkeit and the Kunstakademie Duesseldorf suggested a new, conceptual framework of taxonomies that became a defining influence on The Walther Collection's acquisitions and gallery presentation. For over three decades, Artur Walther traveled extensively across the globe, forging connections with artists and often accompanied by key curators within the field of photography. With a deeply investigative and research-driven approach, he focused on the work of practitioners in regions whose work provided significant contributions to expanding the history of the photographic medium. The core of the collection's Chinese works were acquired in the 1990s, often shortly after their production, and highlights some of the most significant works of Chinese performance photographers, including that of the Beijing East Village artists and Ai Weiwei, Cang Xin, Huang Yan, Song Dong, Zhang Huan, and Zhuang Hui. At a time when few western collectors took interest in the artistic landscape of the East, Walther was drawn to the experimental work coming out of the 1980s and 1990s by artists probing the socio-political changes they were witnessing. With continued research and artist engagement up to present-day, the collection charts the various trajectories of photography and video art in China from the end of the Cultural Revolution to the globalized works of contemporary media artists. Beginning in the early 2000s, Walther began a dialogue with curator and critic Okwui Enwezor, who curated the first extensive African photography exhibition, In/Sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present (Guggenheim, 1996). In the following years, the two began a long-term examination into photography across the African continent. Extensive travels with Enwezor throughout the continent resulted in the core works within the collection's holdings of African photography, including with masters in studio portraiture Seydou Ke\u00efta, J. D. \u2018Okhai Ojeikere, Malick Sidib\u00e9, and Samuel Fosso, as well as South African social documentary photographers David Goldblatt, Santu Mofokeng, Mikhael Subotzky, Guy Tillim, and Jo Ractliffe. The modern and contemporary African works featured in the collection now range from the 1950s to the present day, cutting across colonial and post-colonial histories while investigating the multivalent facets of social identity, questioning notions of belonging, and examining socio-political concerns of migration, lineage, and the legacies of colonialism. The Walther Collection also significant holdings of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century cartes de visite, postcards, albums, vintage portraits and books from Southern and Eastern Africa. Walther was inspired by Santu Mofokeng\u2019s The Black Photo Album and the way in which it created a \u2018counter-archive\u2019 of historical South African studio portraiture to expand his collection to include historical photography. The holdings of historical African photography are part of The Walther Collection's ongoing process of revising conceptions of photographic history according to Hal Foster's idea of the \u201carchival impulse,\u201d whereby confronting the archive, new systems of knowledge can be created. While the collection's engagements in these areas is ongoing, since 2015 it has accrued vast holdings of vernacular photography, non-fine art imagery. Rather than focusing on aesthetics, this view of vernacular photography concentrates on communal or ritual behaviors. It encompasses a broad social history, spanning from 1839 to the present, and retains a global scope, with particular attention to South Africa and the United States. By presenting exhibitions and initiating discussions around vernacular photography, the collection examines how photographic representations reinforce or subvert prevailing roles of class, gender, sexuality, and race. Taxonomy and seriality are key organizing and aesthetic motifs in the collection. Rejecting Henri Cartier-Bresson's notion of the \u201cdecisive moment\u201d in favor of ordering images according to types, movement, structure or time, the typological and serial approaches to photography interrogate and expose a set of formal similarities and methods, turning from pictorial representation toward systems of knowledge. Moreover, the formal concept of the typology allows The Walther Collection to stage a comprehensive conversation between artists of disparate geographic and cultural backgrounds. Bringing together portraits by modern photographic masters such as August Sander, Seydou Ke\u00efta, and Richard Avedon, or juxtaposing Karl Blossfeldt's studies of plant forms, Bernd and Billa Becher's typologies of industrial architecture, and J.D. \u2018Okhai Ojeikere's encyclopedic documentation of Nigerian hairstyles, such pairings open up a dynamic comparison that reveals not only similarities but also surprising new perspectives. == Exhibition Spaces == === The New York Project Space === Opened in 2011 and located in the West Chelsea Arts Building in New York City, The Walther Collection Project Space serves to extend the Collection's mission and program to American audiences. By functioning as an incubator, the Project Space allows The Walther Collection to stage dynamic and current exhibitions along with curatorial talks, gallery walkthroughs and screenings. === The Neu- Ulm Campus === The Neu-Ulm Museum space consists of three buildings: the White Cube, the Black House, and the Green House. The galleries of the 10,000 square-foot campus are distributed around three different buildings named for their architectural character. The main building, the White Cube, was designed by the Ulm-based architectural firm of Braunger-W\u00f6rtz, and is a light-filled three-story structure consisting of a 5,000-square-foot gallery on the sub- ground level and a smaller, 1,500-square-foot gallery and reading room on the second floor. The Green House is a renovated two-level structure. The house remains exactly as it was built more than half a century ago, and its fa\u00e7ade is covered with green ivy. There are two modest galleries on each floor, and their intimate scale allows for the exhibition of small-format works. The Black House is a one-level, bungalow-style structure with no windows on the sides of the building facing the street, lit by skylights and a glass curtain wall in the back. === Traveling Exhibitions === Travelling exhibitions are central to the Walther Collection's global scope and desire to facilitate dialogue within and outreach beyond the field, expanding perspectives and engagement. The Walther Collection has participated in major art fairs such as Rencontres Africaines de la Photographie, Biennale Africaine de la Photographie (2017\u20132018); the Photography Show presented by AIPAD (2017); and Rencontres d'Arles (2014). == Research == The Walther Collection has organized a symposium for each major exhibition series, cultivating a space for research and scholarly discussion between leading international academics, curators, artists, and cultural producers in the field. The result of these symposia form the basis of critical and scholarly writing featured in the collection's publications. === November 10, 2012: Encounters with the African Archive === NYU Tisch & University College London > Scholars were invited to discuss the colonial, ethnographic, anthropologial > and artistic categories that are often used to describe historic photographs > of Africans.
