The club's full name is Athlitikos Syllogos Papagou Athens Basketball Club, which is abbreviated as A.S. Papagou Athens B.C. (Greek: \u0391.\u03a3. \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1 K.A.E.). ==Logos== Papagou BC logo1.png | (The official logo of Papagou B.C.) Papagou BC logo2.jpg | (The official alternate logo of Papagou B.C.) ==History== The club's parent athletic association was founded in 1966. Ten years later, in 1976, the men's basketball club was founded. Papagou was promoted into the major Greek basketball division in 1990. The team spent seven seasons there in the 1990s, and had success in the 1996\u201397 season, and especially in the 1997\u201398 season, by beating Peristeri in the first round of the Greek League playoffs, before losing to PAOK in the second round. Led in that era by the great scorers Alphonso Ford and Georgios Diamantopoulos, they finished 7th in the Greek League in the 1996\u201397 season, and gained a qualification to the following 1997\u201398 season's FIBA Kora\u0107 Cup competition. They would make one more appearance in that European-wide 3rd- tier level competition, during the 1998\u201399 season. More recently, the Papagou basketball team struggled to hold on to its position in the top league in Greece, the first division Greek Basket League. In the 1998\u201399 season, the team competed in the Greek first division, for the last time in recent years. ==Arena== The team's home arena is \"Saloun\" Indoor Hall, which is located approximately two miles away from downtown Athens. ==Titles and honors== *Greek 2nd Division Champion (3): **1990, 1993, 1995 ==Retired numbers== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#006BB3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Papagou B.C. retired numbers |- ! style=\"width:40px; background:#006BB3; color:white;\"| N\u00b0 ! style=\"width:40px; background:#006BB3; color:white;\"| ! style=\"width:160px; background:#006BB3; color:white;\"|Player ! style=\"width:40px; background:#006BB3; color:white;\"|Position ! style=\"width:160px; background:#006BB3; color:white;\"|Tenure ! style=\"width:160px; background:#006BB3; color:white;\"|Date Retired |- | 9 || || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alphonso Ford || SG || 1996\u20131997 || |- | 13 || || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Michalis Yfantis || SF || || |} ==Notable players== Greece: * 20px Antonis Asimakopoulos * 20px Georgios Bosganas * 20px Kostas Charissis * 20px Georgios Diamantopoulos * 20px George Dikeoulakos * 20px Periklis Dorkofikis * 20px Nikos Filippou * 20px Memos Ioannou * 20px Sotiris Katoufas * 20px John Korfas * 20px Alexis Kyritsis * 20px Georgios Limniatis * 20px Sotiris Manolopoulos * 20px Nikos Michalos * 20px-20px Michalis Misunov * 20px George Papadakos * 20px Michalis Romanidis * 20px Georgios Sigalas * 20px Michalis Yfantis * 20px Alexandros Zabetakis * 20px-20px Anatoly Zourpenko Europe:' * 20px Stephen Arigbabu USA: * 20px Tony Costner * 20px Derrek Farr * 20px Alphonso Ford * 20px Greg Foster * 20px Lowell Hamilton * 20px Tony Harris * 20px Todd Mitchell * 20px Mikki Moore * 20px Lawrence Moten * 20px Anthony Pelle * 20px John Shasky * 20px Tony White * 20px Randy Woods Africa: * 20px Alaa Abdelnaby ==Head coaches== *20px David Stergakos *20px Kostas Diamantopoulos *20px Kostas Missas *20px Michalis Kyritsis *20px John Korfas *20px Minas Gekos *20px Dinos Kalampakos ==External links== *Official Team Site *Official Team Blog *Eurobasket.com Team Profile Category:Basketball teams in Greece Category:Basketball teams established in 1976 ",
