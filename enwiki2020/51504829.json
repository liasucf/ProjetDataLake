During World War II he was from 1940 to 1945 a paramedic and subsequently held in custody in a French prisoner-of-war camp in Bad Niedernau for half a year. He studied medicine and graduated in 1950 at the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen and joined the student fraternity T\u00fcbinger K\u00f6nigsgesellschaft Roigel only at a very late stage. He wrote his doctoral thesis from 1947 to 1950 at Carl Martius and Adolf Butenandt about Experiments on the chemical synthesis of an organophosphate of citric acid (Versuche zur Darstellung eines Phosphors\u00e4ure-Esters der Citronens\u00e4ure). The experiments themselves did not have positive results, but Ekkehard Kallee made very interesting observations, with which he could contradict the earlier conclusions of two chemists by acribic efforts. He married the pedagogue and later social pedagogue Barbara Kallee, n\u00e9e Weigmann, in 1965 and had with her one son, Stephan Kallee. In his spare time he maintained two Suabian meadow orchards in Ammerbuch, and arranged regularly an annual hiking tour with his dental medicine students to these. As a consequence, his brandies and liquors, which were branded with the Latin slogan ex hortis manibusque Kallee (from Kallee's gardens and hands) became well known within the student community. As a university professor and doctor for nuclear medicine, he was Head of the Radionuclide Laboratory of the University Hospital for Internal Medicine in T\u00fcbingen, until he became an emeritus in 1987. He was a Member of the European Thyroid Association, the German Association for Endocrinology and the German Association for Internal Medicine. == Education, research and public obligation == His scientific work \u2013 from the time of his doctorate until more than 20 years after becoming an emeritus \u2013 was based on the understanding of the reversibility of adsorption processes, as postulated by Irving Langmuir in his sorption isotherm. Ekkehard Kallee was the first to prove the existence of adsorption distribution levels with this. By understanding the adsorption processes, he succeeded in detecting protein traces by paper electrophoresis of radioactive-iodine-marked insulin. This was, at that time, a breakthrough by several orders of magnitude for the analytical clinical chemistry. Eventually, it was the base for all later immunological detection procedures for various active ingredients. He published already in 1954 two German articles about the detection method with 131I-marked insulin.Ekkehard Kallee: \u00dcber 131J-signiertes Insulin, I. Mitteilung. (Nachweis). Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung B, volume 7, 1952, page 661. Cited in B A Burrows, T Peters & F C Lowell: Physical Binding of insulin by gamma globulins of insulin-resistant subjects. Journal of Clinical Investigation. 1957 March; 36(3): 393\u2013397.Ekkehard Kallee: \u00dcber 131J-signiertes Insulin, II. Anwendungsbereich und Grenzen der Nachweismethode, In: Klinische Wochenschrift, 1954, 32, 508-509. By taking autoradiographs of capillary electrophoresis strips he could detect down to 10\u22129 gram 131I-marked insulin. He examined serums of humans, rats and guinea pigs and noted that these varied in their capability, to reduce the specific adsorption of veal insulin in filtration paper. Human serums were better suited for the specific insulin detection method than rat or guinea pig serums at the time, because they showed the characteristic 131I-marked insulin bands only, when non-radioactive carrier-insulin was added. In this field of research one half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was given to Rosalyn Sussman Yalow in 1977 for the development of radioimmunological methods for the detection of peptide hormones.Prof. Dr. Richard Wahl: Nachruf auf Professor Ekkehard Kallee, ein Pionier in seinem Fach.

Ekkehard Kallee determined from 1952 to 1959 the principles of the reversibility of protein adsorption together with his colleagues G. Seybold,A. D'Addabbo, G. Seybold und E.

The research team's idea about the passive transport of protein-bound substances was triggered by the medical examination of patients with disorders caused by a lack of albumin. One of Ekkehard Kallee's key research topics was the analbuminaemia, a rarely occurring genetic disorder, of which only 50 cases have been published worldwide.Register of Analbuminemia Cases, The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital Research Institute, Cooperstown, NY. Ekkehard Kallee examined two Suebian siblings with analbuminaemia over a period of 38 years.Bennhold's analbuminemia: A follow-up study of the first two cases (1953\u20131992), The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, volume 127, issue 5, pages 470-480 (May 1996). These are globally the first two patients, for whom this illness has been diagnosed and published.\u2019\u2019H. Bennhold, H. Peters & E. Roth: \u00dcber einen Fall von kompletter Analbuminaemie ohne wesentliche klinische Krankheitszeichen, Verh. Dtsch. Ges. Inn. Med. 60, 1954, 630-634.Mary S. Ruhoff, Michael W. Greene, Theodore Peters: Location of the mutation site in the first two reported cases of analbuminemia. In: Clinical Biochemistry. 43, 2010, page 525\u2013527, . The female analbuminaemia patient was treated with a substitution therapy mit human serum albumin. Laboratory analysis before and after the infusion of large amounts of albumin gave a hint about a mechanism, by which albumin-bound substances were transported passively in the blood within the circulatory system into the extracellular fluid volume and the other way round. She developed in the fourth decade of her life an extreme lipodystrophy. She had a juvenile osteoporosis, which could be normalised by the albumin substitution. She died at the age of 69 years from cancer. Her brother didn't ever get any albumin, although his serum contained only 60 \u00b5g/ml of an albumin-like protein. He suffered from an extreme osteoporosis and died at the age of 59 years from colorectal cancer. Although both patients had high cholesterol values and a high number of blood clotting factors, they did not have any disadvantages by that. Generally, most of Ekkehard Kallee's research projects were based on the interaction with patients. This is particularly relevant for the diagnosis and therapy of thyroid illnesses as one of the first doctors of nuclear medicine in Germany. Long before the Chernobyl disaster he assessed the risks and benefits of iodine prophylaxis at nuclear power plant disasters.Ekkehard Kallee: Nutzen und Risiko der Jodprophylaxe bei Kernreaktorunf\u00e4llen, Der Internist, May 1981; 22(5): 304-7. After the disaster, he examined food from the regions affected by the nuclear fallout and developed a method on decontaminating radioactively contaminated meet \u2013 especially rendeer and deer meet \u2013 by curing.R. Wahl, E. Kallee: Decontamination puts meat in a pickle. In: Nature, volume 323, Number 6085, 18\u201324 September 1986, page 208, . . . == Family == Ekkehard Kallee was from an academic family in W\u00fcrttemberg: His father Albert Kallee was director of the Landgericht Stuttgart and expert for employment law.G. W.: Ein liebenswerter Menschner Jurist \u2013 Verabschiedung von Landgerichtsdirektor Dr. Kallee. In: Heilbronner Stimme. Saturday 12 May 1951. His grandfather Richard Kallee was Lutheran parish priest in Feuerbach and as a local historian discovered 102 alamannic sandstone cists in Feuerbach and documented 760 archaeological finds.Heinz Kr\u00e4mer: Fertig Feuerbach! Richard Kallee, Pfarrer und Geschichtsforscher, DRW Verlag, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, 2004, . The Kalleestra\u00dfe in Stuttgart-Feuerbach is named after him. His great-grandfather, General Eduard von Kallee was probably an illegitimate son of King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg and devoted himself after an unusually steep military and diplomatic career to literary, artistic and archaeological studies, during which discovered several Roman sites along the Limes Germanicus. == Publications == * Zur Natur der Azorubin-Bindung an Serumalbumin, Hoppe- Seyler's Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie 290, 1952, pages 207-215. * with Hans Hermann Bennhold: Comparative studies on the half-life of 131I-labeled alubumins and nonradioactive human serum albumin in a case of analbuminemia.
