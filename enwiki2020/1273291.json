Upon graduating from Norway High School in 1944, he went to the University of California, Berkeley and played linebacker there on two Rose Bowl teams before earning his physical education degree in 1951. ==Coaching career== Ralston began his coaching career in 1952 at San Lorenzo High School in San Lorenzo, California, just south of Oakland. He subsequently was an assistant coach at Mt. Diablo High School in Concord, California. in 1953 and 1954. He then spent three seasons as an assistant coach at Cal from 1955\u20131958.

Ralston moved to Stanford University in 1963 and, over nine seasons, built a mark of 55\u201336\u20133. In his last two seasons, 1970\u20131971, Ralston's teams won two Pacific-8 titles and notched back-to-back Rose Bowl victories over Ohio State and Michigan, both of whom were undefeated coming into the Rose Bowl game. Under Ralston's tutelage, Stanford quarterback Jim Plunkett won the Heisman Trophy in 1970. In 1972, Ralston departed the San Francisco Bay Area again, this time for the Rocky Mountains and the Denver Broncos. The Broncos finished with a 5\u20139 record in 1972. In 1973, a year which included the \"Orange Monday\" game played in front of a prime-time national television audience in which the Broncos came from behind to earn a tie on Jim Turner's 35-yard field goal, Ralston coached the team into first place with a 6\u20133\u20132 record. With their first winning season in franchise history under their belt and with the AFC West title on the line, the Broncos' season ended with a 21\u201317 loss to the Oakland Raiders.

In 1975 the Broncos finished with a 6\u20138 record, but the following year the team improved and finished with a 9\u20135 record.

In five seasons with the Broncos, Ralston guided the team to winning seasons three times and an overall record of 34\u201333\u20133; despite this, he never went to the playoffs during his Bronco (and NFL head coaching) tenure.
