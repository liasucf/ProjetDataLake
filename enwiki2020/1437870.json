    "text": "Sir William Burrell (9 July 1861 \u2013 29 March 1958) was a Scottish shipping merchant and philanthropist. A collector of antiques, he donated his vast collection to the city of Glasgow, leading to the creation of the Burrell Collection art museum. ==Biography== His sister, Mary Born on 9 July 1861 in Glasgow, Burrell was the third of nine children to shipowner William Burrell (1832\u20131885) and Isabella Duncan (n\u00e9e Guthrie). Burrell's grandfather, George Burrell, had founded a shipping firm; Burrell joined this business in 1875, at the age of 14, and took over the firm when his father died. Burrell and his brothers were successful in business by ordering ships during economic downturns, and using these modern vessels to full capacity when the economy recovered. Using this method the family became rich. This allowed Burrell to spend his time collecting antiques, and he managed this by his eye for a bargain. Burrell was a faithful patron of Scottish artists including Joseph Crawhall II, George Henry and John Lavery. He commissioned Lavery to paint a portrait of his sister Mary Burrell in 1896. This portrait was exhibited widely and is considered one of Lavery's finest works.Lavery, John (1940) \"The Life of a Painter\" Boston: Little Brown In 1944 Burrell donated his collection to the city of Glasgow, with \u00a3250,000 to house it. The conditions of this include the request that the collection should be in a rural setting. This posed a problem until the council acquired Pollok Country Park. A custom- built museum, the Burrell Collection, was finally opened in 1983 \u2013 even this is large enough to display only a portion of Burrell's collection. Provand's Lordship in Glasgow also displays some of his collection of 17th century Scottish furniture. ==Freemasonry== Burrell was a Scottish Freemason, initiated in Lodge \"The Princes's\", No.607, on 9 May, Passed on 7 November 1892 and Raised on 12 March 1893.Famous Scottish Freemasons. The Grand Lodge of Antient Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland. 2010. P.35-36. ==Death== William Burrell died at Hutton Castle in the Scottish Borders on 29 March 1958, at the age of 96. He is buried in Largs, where he had a holiday home in Nelson Street, along with his wife Constance who died on 15 August 1961 aged 86. ==Awards and honours== Burrell was knighted in 1927 for services to art and for his public work. The Freedom of the City of Glasgow was conferred upon him on 26 May 1944. He was the recipient of the 1946 St Mungo Prize, awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow. ==Family== In 1901 Burrell married Constance Mary Lockhart Mitchell, the daughter of another ship owner. Constance suffered from poor health, and ended her life mentally unwell. They had a daughter, Marion (1902\u20131992); Constance resented the difficult labour she had experienced, and Sir William\u2014devoted to his wife, and encouraged by her to treat Marion harshly\u2014found his daughter's suitors wanting, breaking three of her engagements. A portrait of Constance painted by Lavery around this time shows some of her anguish. Marion, who in later life changed her name to Silvia, became estranged from her parents at the age of 47, and received no inheritance. https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13149634.book-reveals-secret- life-of-sir-william-burrells-daughter ==References== ==Further reading== *Marks, Richard (1983) Burrell, a portrait of a collector: Sir William Burrell 1858 - 1961.
