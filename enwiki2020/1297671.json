    "text": "P\u00e4r Anders Frid\u00e9n (born 25 March 1973), also known as just Anders Frid\u00e9n, is a Swedish singer and songwriter. He is best known as the vocalist/lyricist of metal band In Flames. Frid\u00e9n was also the vocalist of Passenger, a side project. ==Career== ===Early career=== Frid\u00e9n was originally the vocalist for Dark Tranquillity. He performed on their debut album, Skydancer, but left the band soon after. Two years later he joined In Flames. Coincidentally Mikael Stanne had left In Flames (being only a session player) and switched from rhythm guitar to lead vocals in Dark Tranquillity, so the two effectively traded places. Frid\u00e9n was also the lead vocalist for another band known as Ceremonial Oath with In Flames founder Jesper Str\u00f6mblad. === 1995\u2013present: In Flames === Frid\u00e9n started with In Flames on the 1996 album The Jester Race. On the album Whoracle, Niklas Sundin (of Dark Tranquillity) wrote the lyrics following the original synopsis by Frid\u00e9n. On the 1999 album Colony, Frid\u00e9n composed the lyrics himself, though Sundin still assisted by translating his lyrics from Swedish to English. He is also the vocalist for the band Passenger as a side project. Frid\u00e9n also has done guest vocals on the album The Phantom Novels, by the metal band Grievance. He is the lead vocalist on the tracks Atrocity Upon Deceptions, A Devil's Rhyme and The Mask of Sin. In 2007 Frid\u00e9n appeared as a guest vocalist on the Japanese bonus track \"See the Falling Sky\" on Caliban's 2007 album \"The Awakening\". As well as providing vocals for the track \"Dysfunctional Hours\" for the 20th anniversary Nuclear Blast Allstars compilation album, Out of the Dark. Frid\u00e9n in 2008 His look changed dramatically following the release of In Flames 2002 release Reroute to Remain. His previously clean-shaven look was replaced with a beard, and his long hair was put into dreadlocks. His vocal style has also changed, especially on the past three records. His low-tone, harsh death growl has evolved into a higher pitched scream, which is now supplemented by clean vocals and layers of backing vocals. In addition to being a vocalist, Frid\u00e9n is also a producer, with his most recent efforts being the albums: The Undying Darkness by Caliban in 2006 and Absolute Design by the band Engel in 2007. He also co-wrote and performed scream vocals on the song \"Self vs Self\", which appears on the third album of UK/Australian drum and bass band Pendulum alongside his bandmates Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte and Peter Iwers. In the summer of 2010, Frid\u00e9n changed his appearance again by making the decision to cut off his dreadlocks which he had grown since the release of Reroute to Remain. ==Personal life== Frid\u00e9n has a daughter named Agnes and a son named Edwin with his wife Helena Lindsj\u00f6. He has a younger brother named Magnus who is seen in \"The Quiet Place\" studio recording session. Frid\u00e9n owns an extensively large DVD collection. His favorite quote is, \"The one with the most DVDs when you die, wins.\" He is also a fan of alcohol and collects whisky. In an interview with Metal Hammer, he spoke about how over the years he has acquired a taste for fine whisky, and how \"it's stupid to get drunk on fine whisky, there's other stuff for that.\" Frid\u00e9n is a supporter of the Swedish football club IFK G\u00f6teborg. ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Album or Song!!Band!!Membership!!
