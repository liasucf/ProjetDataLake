    "text": "St Joseph's Gaelic Football Club was a Gaelic football club in County Donegal, Ireland. ==History== The club was formed in 1963 from the merger of Aodh Ruadh, based in Ballyshannon, and R\u00e9alt na Mara, based in Bundoran. Brian McEniff explained in 2013 that St Joseph's was formed when the clubs in the two towns \"were doing rather poorly. In spite of the great rivalry, they came together. The bonding factor was the De La Salle College in the upper part of our parish. The De La Salle Brothers ran a very good school. There were no more than 200 boys but they could play well above their lot. It was a great GAA school. All of the boys \u2014 except myself, I went to a boarding school in Monaghan \u2014 were from De La Salle. It was a natural transition\". St Joseph's won an unofficial Ulster Senior Club Football Championship against St John's in Irvinestown in 1966, reached the first official final in 1968 and won the official tournament in 1975; they remained the only Donegal club to do so until 2018 when Gaoth Dobhair won Ulster. The clubs separated in 1977. ==Notable players== * S\u00e9amus Grenadian * Brian McEniff \u2014 county manager * Danny McHugh * Mickey McLoone * Pauric McShea ==Honours== * Ulster Senior Club Football Championship: 1975 * Donegal Senior Football Championship: 1965, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 * Donegal Senior Football League: 4 * Gold Flake Cup: 1 ==References== Category:Former Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Donegal Category:Gaelic football clubs in County Donegal ",
