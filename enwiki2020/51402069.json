In 1787 her owner was \"Hitchie\", her master \"Jn Wolff\", and her trade London\u2014South Seas, indicating that she was a whaler.Lloyd's Register (1787), \u2116S216. More accurately, her master was John Wolfe, Woolf, or Wolf, and her owner Richard Cadman Etches. She sailed on 21 April 1787 for the South Seas.British Southern Whale Fishery Database \u2013 voyages: Duke of York. Etches had received a license from the South Sea Company to sail around Cape Horn into the Pacific. He dispatched her to reinforce the settlement at New Years Harbour (now Puerto Ano Nuevo) on Staten Island (now Isla de los Estados), off Tierra del Fuego. Seal hunters established a factory there in 1786, which was also well-located for vessels rounding Cape Horn to refresh and replenish their water. On 4 June, Duke of York sailed from St Jago, \"all well\". By August, she was at the Falkland Islands, \"all well\". On 11 September, shortly after she arrived at New Years Harbour, Duke of York was lost. Her crew, however, was saved. The loss of Duke of York ended the factory. The people took to their boats and left the island. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * * Category:1780 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1787 Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Age of Sail merchant ships Category:Whaling ships ",
