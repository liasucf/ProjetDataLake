After a fire about 1250, almost the whole settlement was destroyed. Shortly after Rauschenberg was founded by the Counts of Ziegenhain, it was granted town rights. When the \"von Ziegenhain\" family died out in 1450, the castle and the town fell to the House of Hesse. In this time, the castle was expanded and made into a hunting lodge. During the Thirty Years' War, Rauschenberg was mostly destroyed and thoroughly plundered by Swedish troops. Ever since the castle was blown up at a Kassel colonel's behest two years before the war ended, there has been nothing left of it but a ruin. ==Politics== ===Town council=== Results of municipal election on 06 March 2016: {| class=\"wikitable\"shradha |colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" | Parties and voter coalitions |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" | Share in % |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" | Seats |---- |CDU |Christian Democratic Union |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |26.1 |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |6 |---- |SPD |Social Democratic Party of Germany |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |23.1 |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |5 |---- |Greens |Alliance '90/The Greens |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |21.1 |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |5 |---- | FBL | Freie B\u00fcrgerliste (citizens' coalition) |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |29.7 |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |7 |---- |colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |total |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |100 |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EECFA1\" |23 |---- |} ==Coat of arms== Rauschenberg's civic coat of arms might be described thus: Party per fess; above, in sable a six-pointed star argent; below in Or.
