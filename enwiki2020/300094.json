In the legendary account of the founding of the city, a lion came out of the forest when the site was chosen; hence the city was called Ban Singh Tha (), Home (of) Imposing Lion. (For facts behind the legend, and of two men called Singh, see the city's history).

The provincial tree is Anisoptera costata. ==Administrative divisions== Yasothon with 9 districts ===Provincial government=== The province is divided into nine districts (amphoe).
