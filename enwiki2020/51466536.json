He is a radio host and has a current events show, Devil's Advocate with Jon Caldara, that airs on Colorado Public Television. ==Early life and education== Caldara was born in Trenton, New Jersey. His family moved to Colorado when he was six years old. He graduated from Heritage High School and the University of Colorado Boulder. While in college, he drew a comic strip called B Street. After college, Caldara worked as a roadie setting up stage equipment for rock bands. He later started a stage lighting business. ==Public policy career== Caldara was elected to the board of directors for the Regional Transportation District, eventually becoming chairman. He replaced Tom Tancredo as president of the Independence Institute, a Colorado think tank, in 1998. ===Voter registration protest=== When the Colorado legislature relaxed voter registration requirements to allowed people to register in a jurisdiction if they declared their intent to move there, Caldara objected. He decided to test the law by declaring his intent to move to Colorado Springs (Caldara is a long-time resident of Boulder, Colorado) in order to vote in a recall election there. In September 2013, Caldara cast a blank ballot, but never moved to Colorado Springs, although he sublet a room there for a brief time.Lynn Bartels, \u201cNew El Paso County resident Jon Caldara turns in blank recall ballot,\u201d Denver Post, 24 April 2016. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers investigated Caldara for voting fraud, but decided against prosecuting him. Suthers called the incident \"suspicious,\" and said that it was questionable that Caldara ever intended to become an El Paso County resident. However, Suthers noted \"arguable ambiguity\u201d in the same-day voter law, and took no action. Caldara\u2019s answer to his critics was: \"I told you what I did was legal, neener-neener-neener.\"Lynn Bartels, \u201cColorado AG: No criminal charges in Jon Caldara's voter registration,\u201d Denver Post, 4 Jan. 2014. ==Personal life== Caldara is the father of three children, one of whom died of cancer when she was one year old. His son has Down syndrome. ==See also== * Roe Award ==References== ==External links== * * Jon Caldara biography * Jon Caldara on Ballotpedia Category:Living people Category:American libertarians Category:Radio personalities from Colorado Category:People from Boulder, Colorado Category:People from Trenton, New Jersey Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
