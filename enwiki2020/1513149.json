    "text": "{| |} De Grasse is a F67 type large high-sea frigate of the French Marine Nationale specialised in anti-submarine warfare, though she also has anti-air and anti-surface capabilities. She is named after the 18th century admiral count Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse. ==Service history== Between 1994 and 1996, De Grasse and her sister were refitted with the modern SLAMS anti- submarine system, an active Very Low Frequencies sonar. In April 2006, De Grasse lost her towed sonar array during an exercise in heavy seas. The incident was reported by the Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9; an investigation was launched to ascertain responsibilities for the loss of the 3 million euro worth sonar array. Meanwhile, the spare sonar of the decommissioned was fitted on De Grasse. De Grasse was decommissioned on 5 May 2013 and is now moored in the Penfeld. ==Gallery== File:De_Grasse_2.jpg|The frigate De Grasse File:De_Grasse_3.jpg|Aft of the frigate De Grasse; the towed sonar is clearly visible File:De_Grasse_4.jpg|The command bridge of De Grasse File:De_Grasse_5.jpg|The frigate De Grasse, harboured in Portsmouth, for the International Festival of the Sea (25 August 2001).
