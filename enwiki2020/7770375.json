    "text": "Oulu Cathedral () is an Evangelical Lutheran cathedral and the seat of the Diocese of Oulu, located in the centre of Oulu, Finland. The church was built in 1777 as a tribute to the King of Sweden Gustav III and named after his wife as Sofia Magdalena's church. The wooden structures burned in the large fire of the city of Oulu in 1822. The church was built again on top of the old stone walls with famous architect Carl Ludvig Engel as the designer. The restoration works were completed in 1832, but the belfry was not erected until 1845. == External links == *Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Oulu *Oulu Cathedral \u2013 Official website Cathedral Category:Carl Ludvig Engel buildings Category:Lutheran cathedrals in Finland Category:Churches completed in 1777 Category:Neoclassical architecture in Finland Category:Pokkinen ",
