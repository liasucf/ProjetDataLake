    "text": "The Epigram of Amazaspos () is a funerary epigram written in Ancient Greek on an inscription found in Rome.Toumanoff, p. 13 It memorialises the death of the PharnavazidToumanoff, p. 14 royal prince Amazaspos, brother of kings Mihrdat I and Rhadamistus, son of king Pharasmanes I of Iberia, who died at Nisibis while accompanying the emperor Trajan on his Parthian expedition during the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars.Rapp, p. 224University of Sydney, p. 101 The epigram seems to be a work of some litterateur in emperor Trajan's company during his Parthian expedition and it seems he was personally aware of Amazaspos' charms where he is compared to \"modest maidens\". It is suggested that this poet may have been emperor Hadrian himself. Authorship of the epigram for prince Amazaspos by Hadrian would explain how the text was available to be inscribed in Rome as the stone may have been erected there in a public place during Hadrian's reign as a reminder of the cost to the Roman Empire of its policy of expansion as Hadrian quickly gave up almost all the lands Trajan had conquered.Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud & Tybout, p. 335 Presumably the prince's remains had also been transferred by Hadrian to Rome.Braund, p. 48 The inscription is dated 114-117 AD.Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud & Tybout, p. 334 Amazaspos is also mentioned in Stele of Vespasian, though according to Cyril Toumanoff that Amazaspos is King Amazasp I of Iberia.Toumanoff, p. 15 ==Inscription== ==References== ==Bibliography== *Cyril Toumanoff (1969) Chronology of the Early Kings of Iberia, Fordham University *A.
