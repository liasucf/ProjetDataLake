    "text": "Didier Hern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez (born July 18, 1979 in Havana) is a Cuban singer who was a member of the well known boy band Menudo. He was one of the last members of the group to join while the band was still named \"Menudo\". He was the second member of Cuban descent, after Ashley Ruiz (whom he replaced). ==Musical career== Didier Hern\u00e1ndez was chosen as a member of Menudo in 1995; two years later, Edgardo D\u00edaz had sold the band's original name and renamed it MDO. Bandmates were Abel Talam\u00e1ntez, Alexis Grull\u00f3n, Edgar Antonio \"Anthony\" Galindo, Daniel Ren\u00e9, Pablo Portillo, Troy Tuminelli, and Caleb Avil\u00e9s. During his seven years as a member of MDO, Hern\u00e1ndez became a teen idol in Puerto Rico and across Latin America. He visited Europe and Asia, a total of 39 countries around the world, becoming a known artist among teenage Hispanic females in the United States. Hern\u00e1ndez recorded a total of seven CDs during this period, including Tiempo de Amar (\"Time to Fall in Love\"), MDO, Un Poco M\u00e1s (\"A Little More\"), Subir Al Cielo (which was also recorded in English as Little Piece of Heaven), and a greatest-hits CD. Hern\u00e1ndez continued with his singing career, trying to become a solo singer. After one year of music production he opened a record label called DGMUSIC, which was distributed by Sony/BMG, through Avalon and, on August 23, 2005, his first solo CD, titled Destino (\"Destiny\"), was released. That same day, he announced a deal with American retail chain Wal-Mart, where he would hold \"sign and greet\" sessions with fans who bought his CD. The first single \"Diva\" was released, followed by \"Te Juro Amor\" (I Swear to You My Love), finishing a promo tour in May 2006. In 2006 Hern\u00e1ndez opened a production company, Rec International, and recorded several music products that were later on released in 2008 via Synergy Entertainment, another company own by Hern\u00e1ndez. Didier Hern\u00e1ndez is currently the president of Trading Connections, an artist-booking agency. In 2011 Didier Hern\u00e1ndez got together with former MDO members to do a reunion tour that lasted until 2015, and the band released a single, \"Ya no queda mas\". An album, MDO Is Back, is scheduled to be released in 2018. A new musical production is to be released in 2018. ==See also== *List of Cubans ==External links== *didierhernandez.com *menudoonline.com Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Cuban male singers Category:Menudo (band) members ",
