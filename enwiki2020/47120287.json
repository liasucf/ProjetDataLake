    "text": "The Bravest is a fireboat operated by the Fire Department of New York City. She was commissioned on May 27, 2011. The FDNY currently has three large fireboats, including the Bravest, supplemented by approximately a dozen smaller high speed patrol craft. The two largest fireboats, Firefighter II and Three Forty Three, are among the largest and most powerful fireboats in the world. At 20 knots they are relatively fast. Bravest, at 65 feet, is comparable in size and power with many cities' largest fireboats, but it has the high speed and shallow draft of a modern high speed patrol craft. Bravests shallow draft of just 1 metre means she can fight fires in the shallow waters off New York City's airports. Her nameplate was carved from a plate of steel recovered from the World Trade Center. thumb {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Specifications |- | Length: || |- | Width: || |- | Draft: || |- | Air draft: || |- | Speed: || |- | Engines: || 3 x diesels |- | Propulsion || waterjets |- | Gallons/minute: || 6000 |- | Builder: || Safe Boats International |- | Cost: || $2.4 million |- | Tonnage: || |} ==See also== * Fireboats of New York City == References == Category:Fireboats of New York City ",
