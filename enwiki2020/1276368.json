It was established in 1939. ==Overview== On the Br\u00fcck aerial testing facility there are two wood-framework towers built in 1963, made without any metallic parts and used for mounting aerials to measure their characteristics. One of these towers, the Messturm III, consists of two towers connected by a bridge on top, while the other, the Messturm II, is from conventional design. A third wood tower, the former Messturm I, which was built in 1958, was destroyed in a fire in 1979. ==See also== *List of towers ==References== ==External links== * * * * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b41640 * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b41641 * Satellite photograph Messturm II * Satellite photograph Messturm III Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1963 Category:Towers in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Potsdam-Mittelmark Category:Wooden towers ",
