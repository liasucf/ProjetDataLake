He studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Lun\u00e9ville and in 1860 entered the Rabbinical Seminary of Paris. On completing his studies he became rabbi at Dijon for two years, and then was rabbi of Lun\u00e9ville for twelve years. In 1880 he became chief rabbi of the consistory of Lyon. In that role, in July 1880 he was named a member of the public education committee of the department of the Rhone. He came to be known as a philanthropist, a French patriot and an eloquent speaker. He was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1888. In 1907 L\u00e9vy succeeded Zadoc Kahn as head of the central consistory, and thus as Chief Rabbi of France. The election was opposed by one other candidate, Isra\u00ebl L\u00e9vi, who was appointed Deputy Chief Rabbi in 1914. At the start of World War I (1914\u201318) Alfred L\u00e9vy established a list of military chaplains. Each year of the war he published the soldier's Tefila, ritual prayers for use by Israelite soldiers on campaign. His health deteriorated during the last two years of the war, and Isra\u00ebl L\u00e9vi acted as Chief Rabbi of France in his place. Alfred L\u00e9vy died at Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques on 23 July 1919 and was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. In 1923 his grandson Robert Gamzon founded the first chapter of the \u00c9claireurs Isra\u00e9lites de France (EIF) in Paris. This scouting organization brought together native-born and immigrant Jewish youth, and affirmed their Jewish identity. Alfred L\u00e9vy's granddaughter Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy (1906\u20131943) aided the Resistance during World War II and was executed by the Germans. She is one of the 16 representatives of Fighting France who is buried at the M\u00e9morial de la France combattante. ==Publications== L\u00e9vy's publications include: * Le Deuil et les C\u00e9r\u00e9monies Fun\u00e8bres chez les Isra\u00e9lites Paris, 1879 * Notice sur les Isra\u00e9lites du Duch\u00e9 de Lorraine 1885 * Notice sur les Isra\u00e9lites de Lyon 1894 * Les Doctrines d'Israel, Recueil de Sermons Lyons, 1896. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * Category:1840 births Category:1919 deaths Category:People from Lun\u00e9ville Category:Chief rabbis of France Category:19th-century rabbis Category:20th-century rabbis Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
