    "text": "Jani Petteri Hurme (born January 7, 1975) is a Finnish professional ice hockey goaltender. He was drafted by the Ottawa Senators in the third round of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft with the 58th overall pick. After playing three seasons for TPS in Finland's SM-liiga, Hurme made his North American debut in the International Hockey League with the Indianapolis Ice during the 1997\u201398 season. He played 48 games with the Senators over three seasons before being traded to the Florida Panthers. He appeared in another 28 games with the Panthers during the 2002\u201303 season. Hurme was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers, but due to very serious illness he did not play a single game in Atlanta. Suffering from the crippling effects of hospital infections, Hurme needed over two years to recuperate. Eventually Hurme returned to the ice, and in the 2005\u201306 season he played with the Columbia Inferno of the ECHL and Chicago Wolves of the AHL before joining the Portland Pirates, for whom he started sixteen playoff games. Hurme's NHL rights are currently owned by the Tampa Bay Lightning. For the 2006\u201307 season, Hurme returned to Finland and played again for TPS. He played for Malm\u00f6 Redhawks from 2007 to 2009. He returned to Finland to play for Ilves in December 2009. He spends his off-season in Turku, Finland, where he owns a house in the neighbourhood of Hirvensalo. ==Awards== * Lasse Oksanen trophy (top player in SM-liiga): 1996\u201397 season * Urpo Yl\u00f6nen trophy (top goaltender in SM-liiga): 1996\u201397 season * Jarmo Wasama memorial trophy (top rookie in SM-liiga): 1995\u201396 season ==External links== * Category:1975 births Category:Chicago Wolves players Category:Cincinnati Cyclones (IHL) players Category:Columbia Inferno players Category:Detroit Vipers players Category:Finnish ice hockey goaltenders Category:Florida Panthers players Category:Grand Rapids Griffins (IHL) players Category:Ice hockey players at the 2002 Winter Olympics Category:Indianapolis Ice players Category:Living people Category:Malm\u00f6 Redhawks players Category:Olympic ice hockey players of Finland Category:Ottawa Senators draft picks Category:Ottawa Senators players Category:Portland Pirates players Category:Sportspeople from Turku Category:HC TPS players ",
