Coren's internal Times email used profanity, the use of which he defends, to take issue with a colleague's removal of an indefinite article (an \"a\") from his piece, which he believed ruined a joke in his last line. Coren said a joke was lost in the change from \"a nosh\" (meaning fellatio) to \"nosh\"\u2014a word derived from Yiddish meaning \"food\", which he doubted his editors knew better than he. The Daily Telegraph said the incident was \"not the first time the critic has been caught out writing abusive emails to colleagues\". The exchange was reprinted in the American magazine Harper's in October 2008. ===Polish controversy=== In his next article, on 26 July 2008, Coren said his Jewish ancestors had been persecuted by Poles. He stated that Poles used to burn Jews in synagogues for entertainment at Easter; and that Poland is in denial about its role in the Holocaust. He referred to immigrant Poles as \"Polacks\", arguing that \"if England is not the land of milk and honey it appeared to them three or four years ago, then, frankly, they can clear off out of it\". Coren's comments led to a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, an early day motion in the UK parliament,Early day motion 2529 \u2013 PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION AND GILES COREN UK Parliament, 19 November 2008 and a critical editorial in The Economist. Coren responded: \"I wrote in passing that the Poles remain in denial about their responsibility for the Holocaust. How gratifying, then, to see so many letters in The Times in the subsequent days from Poles denying their responsibility for the Holocaust.\" He also told The Jewish Chronicle: \"Fuck the Poles\". After the Press Complaints Commission rejected their complaint because the criticism had been of a group rather than an individual, the Federation of Poles in Great Britain lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. Professor G\u00e1bor Halmai of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency said \"I completely share the criticisms\" of the piece made by The Economist. He said that amid an internal debate about an FRA response, a Cypriot colleague had said \"it is not even certain that what Coren stated with regard to his past had taken place at all\". Halmai responded that while the generalization used by Coren was unacceptable, it was protected under freedom of expression. The Neighbours\u2019 Fear. Anti-Semitism in Poland Before and After World War II. Fundamentum, English Edition, 5/2008. 82-87, G\u00e1bor Halmai ===Mediawatch complaint over Twitter posting=== On 14 January 2010, Coren attracted criticism after he posted on his Twitter feed: \"Next door have bought their 12-year-old son a drum kit. For fuck's sake! Do I kill him then burn it? Or do I fuck him, then kill him then burn it?\" Vivienne Pattison, director of watchdog Mediawatch UK, condemned the remark as \"very bad taste\". Coren later posted: \"Oh hell's bells. Look, can I just say I didn't kill the kid, or have sex with him. And anyway he's not real. And I live in Vienna.\" ===Privacy injunction and alleged contempt of court=== On 13 May 2011, Coren attracted more controversy after joking about a privacy injunction by posting on his Twitter feed: \"god, ANOTHER injunction tonight. another footballer. and SUCH a boring one. fucking shit midfielder... he's yet another very ugly married man who's been carrying on with a gold-digging flopsie he should have seen coming a MILE away\". Then on 14 May he tweeted \"Gareth Barry looks remarkably relaxed when you consider that... first touch for Gareth Barry... not according to what I've heard... time for a bet. what chance Barry to score? tiny fiver on barry to score at 22\u20131. wdv been nice to get a double with Giggs in the match before... Barry's been pulled off...\". This was later deleted but was archived. On 22 May 2011, it was reported that lawyers at Schillings acting for an England footballer had persuaded the High Court judge Mr Justice Tugendhat to ask the Attorney General for England and Wales, Dominic Grieve, to consider the criminal prosecution of \"a top journalist\" over a matter that breached a privacy injunction. Coren acknowledged on Twitter that he could face jail for contempt of court, saying: \"A funny fucking day. The support of twitter has been almost tear-jerking. But I am afraid there won't be room for all of us in the cell. xxx.\" On 23 May 2011, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament John Hemming spoke in the House of Commons and used parliamentary privilege to identify Coren as the person involved, leading to an immediate rebuke from Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow.Sky News Giggs Named In Commons As Footballer Identified On Twitter In Context Of Injunctions YouTube, 23 May 2011 In an interview with The Sunday Times on 29 May 2011, Hemming stated that he considered naming both footballers in the Coren controversy, before the Speaker stopped him. Hemming commented that the Speaker was \"probably right to do so\", and added: \"I couldn't be guaranteed his family didn't know, whereas Giggs' name had been chanted on the terraces.\" According to The Daily Telegraph, the Premier League footballer identified by Coren in the tweets was not Ryan Giggs, and was known in the privacy injunction by the pseudonym TSE. The case at the High Court of Justice was TSE & ELP v News Group Newspapers Ltd, with TSE being described as \"a married footballer\" who had been involved in an extra-marital relationship with a woman known as ELP. Neither person had wished The Sun to publish the details of the relationship. The injunction was granted on 13 May 2011 by Mr Justice Tugendhat, who accepted claims from the footballer that publication of the details of the relationship \"would provoke the cruel chants of supporters.\" Tugendhat said that aspects of the case had been published on \"various electronic media, including Twitter\", but added: \"the fact that these publications have occurred does not mean that there should be no injunction in this case\". ===Fake Polish Twitter account=== In December 2018, it was discovered that Giles Coren had an alternative Twitter account that \"he uses to accuse people critical of him of antisemitism\". The account stated to be of a Polish plumber with a bio composed in broken English and Coren's book cover as avatar. ==Bibliography== *Coren, Giles Winkler; London: Jonathan Cape Ltd, 2005 *Coren, Giles Anger Management for Beginners: A Self-Help Course in 70 Lessons; London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2010 *Coren, Giles How to Eat Out: Lessons from a Life Lived Mostly in Restaurants; London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2012 ==References== == External links == *Giles Coren articles Times Online *Giles Coren reviews Times Online *Five Minutes With: Giles Coren Interview with BBC News, 20 December 2012.
