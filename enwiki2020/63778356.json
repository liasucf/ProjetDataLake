    "text": "The Labrador ice sheet was a major ice sheet that periodically covered large parts of North America during glacial periods over the last ~2.6 million years. The seam between the two ice sheets passed over the northern tip of the Ugava Peninsula passing south across Hudson Bay and on to the Ontario shore near Fort Stevens. This seam continued southward across Lake Superior, east of the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan. Southward into Wisconsin, along the Lake Michigan shoreline, crossing into western Illinois. Reaching down the Mississippi River valley to its junction with the Missouri River, it reaches its most southern point.John P.

The primary Quebec Dome, centered over of Ungava Peninsula. A second some, called the Hudson Bay Dome was to the west on shore of Hudson Bay, near Churchill, Manitoba. ==See also== *Laurentide Ice Sheet **Cordilleran ice sheet **Keewatin ice sheet **Labrador ice sheet **Baffin ice sheet ==References== ==Bibliography== *Fulton, R.
