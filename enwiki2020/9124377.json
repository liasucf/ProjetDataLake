    "text": "Southbound was an arts, camping and music festival. A variety of Australian and international artists perform at this event. The festival occurred annually around New Years, at the Sir Stewart Bovell Park in Busselton, Western Australia. ==History== Southbound began as a single day music festival in 2005, located at Sir Stewart Bovell Park in Busselton, Western Australia. In 2006 the event expanded, allowing festival-goers to camp on the festival grounds. In 2007, campers were allowed to camp the night before the festival, with special acoustic performances that same night. The 2010 event expanded into a 3-day festival for campers (2 days for non-campers). The 2016 event was cancelled the night before the event after bushfires in the Waroona area closed both the South Western Highway and Forrest Highway causing traffic to detour between Perth and Busselton. Main Roads Western Australia's advice to organisers was that the only other viable alternative route may also be restricted. After requests from patrons, event organisers made arrangements to allow ticket refunds to be donated to relief efforts, and also donated food intended for catering at Southbound to bushfire relief. The festival was partly revived as a bush-fire benefit concert held at HBF Stadium on Sunday 10 January. The event was rested in 2017. Some fans hoped it might come back in 2018, but the organisers have moved onto other projects and state it is time for the Southbound crowd to do likewise.https://studentedge.org/article/southbound-organisers-say-its-now- time-to-move-on ==The Event== ===ArtBound=== ArtBound started at Southbound 2006, as a showcase of works from the local art community. ===EcoBound=== Southbound 2014 offered incentives for attendees to help collect recycling and displayed the results in an art installation. EcoBound displayed how recyclable materials and alternative energy were implemented to reduce the environmental impact of the festival. Solar power and biodiesel were used to meet energy needs. ===StageBound=== StageBound gave unsigned artists an opportunity to perform at Southbound. A requirement of these artists was that they were from the south west regional areas of Western Australia. ==Artist lineup by year== ===2005=== Sunday 2 January 2005: Pete Murray, Regurgitator, Eskimo Joe, Machine Gun Fellatio, The Thrills, Little Birdy, Wolfmother, Veruca Salt, Koolism, Rhibosome, Bodyjar, James De La Cruz, Sharif Galal, Dakota Star, The Panda Band, Spencer Tracy, The Fuzz, Red Jezebel, Phil\u2019s Finest Hour ===2006=== Monday 2 January 2006: The Dandy Warhols, Ozomatli, Ian Brown, Hoodoo Gurus, Pete Murray, Xavier Rudd, Butterfingers, The Shins, Downsyde, End Of Fashion, The Beautiful Girls, Eric Bibb, Katalyst, Dexter, Dallas Crane, The Grates, True Live, The Panics, TZU, The Vasco Era, Fdel, Sharif Galal, Dan Stinton, Dan The Man, Adima, Em Dee, As a Weapon ===2007=== 2007 Southbound promotional poster Friday 5 January 2007: John Butler Trio, Michael Franti, Matt Costa, The Audreys, Blue King Brown & Dallas Frasca.
