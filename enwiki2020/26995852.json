She consistently appears on the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated net worth of \u00a345 million, based on family assets she inherited in 1948. ==Early life and education== Lady Juliet was born to Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, Viscount Milton, the only son of the 7th Earl Fitzwilliam, and his wife, Olive Plunket. Through her mother, Juliet is a granddaughter of Benjamin Plunket, Bishop of Meath, and a great-granddaughter of Lord Plunket, Archbishop of Dublin. In 1943, when she was eight, her father inherited the title of Earl Fitzwilliam, and she became Lady Juliet. By this time, her parents' marriage was strained, and there was talk of divorce. In 1948 Earl Fitzwilliam died in a plane crash in France with his lover, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, the widow of the heir to the Dukedom of Devonshire and a sister of the future U. S. President John F. Kennedy. As her father's only child, Lady Juliet, still aged only thirteen, inherited his whole unentailed estate and his huge art collection. The following year, she and her mother left Wentworth Woodhouse, and most of its contents were sold.Lady Juliet also owned a large estate in Ireland, Coolattin Park, situated outside the village of Shillelagh in County Wicklow, which had been the seat of the Fitzwilliam family in Ireland since the 17th century. That was sold in 1977, and the famous \"Tomnafinogue wood\", one of the largest ancient oak woodlands in the British Isles and part of the former Coolattin Estate, is now under state ownership.The DiCamillo Companion Lady Juliet holds a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Oxford. ==Marriages and family life== In 1960, Lady Juliet married Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol, twenty years her senior, eighteen days after he inherited his title upon his father's death.
