    "text": "Betty Shine (1929 \u2013 March 2002) was an English author, opera singer and Spiritualist. Shine claimed to be a psychic, medium and spiritual healer.Biography for Betty Shine, Random House author page. ==Career== Shine is best known for her \"Mind\" series of books including Mind to Mind (1989), Mind Magic (1991) and Mind Waves. Together, the first two books spent 19 weeks in The Sunday Times Top 10 best seller lists.Linda Joffee article \"She's so down-to-earth... it's spooky\", The Independent, 14 January 1993 Later, she claimed to have foreseen the events of 9-11.Katy Rice \"Gone but not forgotten\", The Argus, 30 April 2012 She started her global Healing Network, along with her daughter, Janet Shine who continues the network and continues to make Betty Shine materials available. ==Controversial claim== Shine had spoken with David Icke when he went to her for a consultation, when she told him he was the Son of God among other claims.\"The 10 worst decisions in the history of sport\", The Observer Sport Monthly, 12 January 2003 It may be possible that in the Rosicrucian tradition that Betty Shine is referring to in relation to Icke, the term \"Son of God\" (or \"Daughter of God\") simply means someone who has purified themselves and developed such high levels of self- sacrifice that they have reached a level of consciousness that rises above bodily desires and selfishness to the greater good and the brotherhood of mankind. In his book The Great Initiates, French philosopher \u00c9douard Schur\u00e9, indicates that Hindu, Egyptian and Ancient Greek initiation traditions use the description \"Son of God\" to mean \"a consciousness identical with divine truth, a will capable of manifesting it\".Schur\u00e9, \u00c9douard, 1841-1929. The Great Initiates. Translation of Les grands initi\u00e9s \u00a9 1961 by Rudolf Steiner Publications Inc., printed by Harper & Rowe Publishers, New York. Icke directly compared himself to Jesus Christ whilst being interviewed on Wogan in 1991. Icke appeared on the show in a turquoise tracksuit and claiming to be \"a son of the Godhead\". When the studio audience began to laugh, Wogan responded, \"They're not laughing with you; they're laughing at you.\" ==Death== Shine died on 26 March 2002 of heart failure. ==Bibliography== * Mind to Mind (1989) * Mind Magic (1991) * Mind Waves (1993) * Mind Workbook * My Life as a Medium (1996) * The Infinite Mind * Clear your Mind * Free your Mind * A Mind of Your Own (1998) * A Free Spirit (2002) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1929 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century English singers Category:20th-century British opera singers Category:20th-century women opera singers Category:English psychics Category:English spiritual mediums Category:English opera singers Category:English women writers Category:English writers ",
