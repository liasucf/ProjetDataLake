Since 2016, Schwamb has held the post of assistant scientist at the Gemini Observatory. She is the creator and co-founder of Astrotweeps, a Rotation Curation account on astronomy. Schwamb is involved in citizen science projects. She is a founding science team member for Planet Four, project intended for mapping seasonal fans on the South Pole of Mars. She is also part of the science team leading at Planet Hunters a project in which users analyze data from the NASA Kepler Space Mission while searching for exoplanets. == Awards and honors == In 2017 she received a Carl Sagan Medal for excellence in public communication, for the creation of the Astrotweeps and Planet Four projects. On 13 April 2017, asteroid 11814 Schwamb, discovered by Schelte Bus at the Siding Spring Observatory in 1981, was named in her honor (). == Research discoveries== She specialized in studying sednoids, and co-discovered several trans-Neptunian objects. === List of discovered minor planets === Megan Schwamb is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery and co-discovery of 16 minor planets during 2007\u20132010 (see list). In addition to the confirmed discoveries, she also participated in the first observations of the unnumbered objects , and . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; height: 280px; |- | || 10 May 2007 || |- | 229762 G\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0 || 17 July 2007 || |- | 225088 Gonggong || 17 July 2007 || |- | || 25 August 2008 || |- | ' || 11 January 2008 || |- | || 9 September 2010 || |- | || 7 August 2007 || |- | ' || 11 November 2010 || |- | || 14 August 2010 || |- | || 3 November 2010 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; height: 280px; |- | || 14 August 2010 || |- | || 24 September 2008 || |- | ' || 8 October 2010 || |- | || 11 September 2007 || |- | || 26 September 2008 || |- | || 24 September 2008 || |- ! colspan=3 style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left; padding: 6px 12px 80px;\" |Co-discovery made with: M.
