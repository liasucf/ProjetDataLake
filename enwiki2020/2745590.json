He is often surnamed al-Fihri in reference to the Banu Fihri, a clan connected to the Quraysh. His descendants would be known as the \u02bfUqbids or Fihrids. \u02bbUqbah is the founder of the cultural city of Kairouan in Tunisia. \u02bbUqbah accompanied Amr in his initial capture of cities in North Africa starting with Barca, then proceeding to Tripolitania in 644. In 670 now the emir or commander, \u02bbUqbah led an Arab army to North Africa, crossing the Egyptian deserts, and setting up military posts at regular intervals along his route. In a region of what is now Tunisia, he established the town now called Kairouan (meaning \"camp\" or \"caravanserai\" in Persian) about 99 miles south of present-day Tunis, which he used as a base for further operations. According to one legend, one of \u02bbUqbah's soldiers stumbled across a golden goblet buried in the sands. It was recognized as one that had disappeared from Mecca some years before, and when it was dug out of the sand a spring appeared, with waters said to come from the same source as those of the sacred Zamzam Well in Mecca.Places of peace and power - Kairouan, Tunisia - Sacredsites.com This story led to Kairouan becoming a place of pilgrimage and then a holy city (\"the Mecca of the Maghreb\") and the most important city in North Africa. In 683 \u02bbUqbah was ambushed and killed by the Berber Christian king Kusaila after winning the Battle of Vescera. He died beside his hated rival, Abu al-Muhajir Dinar. His armies evacuated Kairouan and withdrew to Barca, though it was recaptured in 688. Al-Watiya Air Base in Libya is also known as \"Okba ibn Nafa Air Base\" after him. ==Historical accounts== Great Mosque of Kairouan Most of the accounts describing Arab conquests of North Africa in general and Uqba's conquests in particular date back to at least two centuries after the conquests have happened. One of the earliest reports come from the Andalucian chronicler Ibn Idhari in his Al-Bayan al-Mughrib. In it, Ibn Idhari describes the moment when Uqba reached the Atlantic Ocean, where he allegedly said, \"O God, if the sea had not prevented me, I would have galloped on for ever like Alexander the Great, upholding your faith and fighting the unbelievers!\"Ibn Idhari, Al-Bayan al-Mughrib fi akhbar al-Andalus, 1 ed. G. S. Colin and E. L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al, 2 vols. (Leiden 1949) p. 27 Edward Gibbon, referring to Uqba ibn Nafi as Akbah, gives him the title \"conqueror of Africa,\" beginning his story when he \"marched from Damascus at the head of ten thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the genuine force of the Moslems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many thousand Barbarians.\" He then marched into North Africa. Gibbon continues: \"It would be difficult, nor is it necessary, to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah.\" On the North African coast, \"the well-known titles of Bugia, and Tangier define the more certain limits of the Saracen victories.\" Gibbon then tells the story of Akbah's conquest of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana: Although much scholarship on the life and conquests of ibn Nafi are available, most have not been translated from their original Arabic into English or French. == See also == * Wheelus Air Base * Medieval Muslim Algeria * Berbers and Islam * Kusaila * Early Muslim conquests ==References and notes== ==External links== *Edward Gibbon, History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Chapter 51 Category:622 births Category:683 deaths Category:Generals of the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Arab generals Category:Umayyad governors of Ifriqiya Category:Medieval Arabs killed in battle Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Muslim conquest of the Maghreb Category:Fihrids ",
