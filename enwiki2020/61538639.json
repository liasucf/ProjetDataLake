He made two first-class appearances in 1861, playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Hampshire and for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club against the Gentlemen of Kent, before playing once for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club the following year in a repeat of the fixture. Continuing his military career, Clayton purchased the rank of lieutenant in March 1863. Four years later in March 1867, he was promoted to the rank of captain, before transferring to the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers in June 1867.
