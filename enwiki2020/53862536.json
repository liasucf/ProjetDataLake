This Greek nun introduced her to the beauty of byzantine art toward which Dragana inclined ever since. During her over 30 years long career she has researched style of the great late byzantine masters whose monumental frescoes influenced and refined her own work. Her admiration toward Michael Astrapas and Eutychios or Panselinos encouraged her to mimic their styles in order to improve her own skill and only through that acquire particular trait of her art. Today she is praised as someone whose icons are of exceptional quality.http://www.spc.rs/eng/node/19660 Since 1988 Dragana has presented her icons on numerous exhibitions in Serbia and abroad and has participated in a number of art colonies, thus actively participating in defining development of contemporary religious art.Du\u0161an Milovanovi\u0107, Savremena pravoslavna srpska umetnost, Muzej primenjene umetnosti, Beograd 1995. She painted two icons of Serbian Patriarch Pavle who was considered saint by many in Serbia even before he deceased in 2009, and whose image is still very well-known. A few years after his death Dragana tried to incorporate his familiar facial features into the traditional technique of icon painting. In 1997 she also became a member of UPIDIV.http://www.upidiv.org.rs/dekorativno-slikarstvo/ Dragana \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 has pained hundreds of icons, some of which were commissioned even for the monasteries and homes of the catholic Christians.
