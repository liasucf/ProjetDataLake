    "text": "Gavialidae is a family of reptiles within the order Crocodilia. Gavialidae have conventionally consisted of only one surviving species, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), which is native to India and Nepal. Many extinct species are also known. The false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) has usually been thought to be a member of the family Crocodylidae based on several characters including skull morphology, but has sometimes been viewed as a member of this family due to general similarities in morphology and habit. Numerous molecular studies have consistently shown the two species to be each other's closest living relative, supporting the view that they are in the same family. Gavialids are large semiaquatic reptiles, resembling crocodiles, but with much thinner snouts. The thin snout is used to catch fish. Gavialids lack the jaw strength to capture the large mammalian prey favoured by crocodiles and alligators of similar size. == Taxonomy == The family Gavialidae was proposed by Arthur Adams in 1854 for reptiles with a very long and slender muzzle, webbed feet and nearly equal teeth. Taxonomists have proposed three different ways to fit Gavialidae members among Crocodilians: * Palaentologists refer to the broad lineage of gharial-like creatures using the term Gavialoidea. * If the three surviving groups of crocodilians are regarded as separate families, then the gharial is one of two members of the Gavialidae, which is related to the families Crocodylidae (crocodiles) and Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans). * Alternatively, the three groups are all classed together as the family Crocodylidae, but belong to the subfamilies Gavialinae, Crocodylinae, and Alligatorinae. === Genera === Family Gavialidae * Subfamily Gavialinae ** Genus \u2020Eogavialis *** \u2020Eogavialis africanus *** \u2020Eogavialis andrewsi ** Genus Gavialis *** Gavialis gangeticus, gharial * Subfamily \u2020Gryposuchinae ** Genus \u2020Aktiogavialis ** Genus \u2020Gryposuchus ** Genus \u2020Hesperogavialis ** Genus \u2020Ikanogavialis ** Genus \u2020Piscogavialis ** Genus \u2020Siquisiquesuchus In addition, molecular evidence indicates that the tomistomines belong to this group, although morphological evidence has been cited to place them in Crocodylidae: * Subfamily Tomistominae ** Genus \u2020Gavialosuchus ** Genus \u2020Kentisuchus ** Genus \u2020Paratomistoma ** Genus \u2020Rhamphosuchus ** Genus \u2020Thecachampsa ** Genus Tomistoma *** \u2020Tomistoma cairense *** \u2020Tomistoma? lusitanicum *** Tomistoma schlegelii, false gharial or Malayan gharial ** Genus \u2020Toyotamaphimeia === Species (Extant) === File:Gavialis gangeticus.jpg|Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) File:Tomistoma schlegelii (2).jpg|False gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) \u2020 Indicates extinct group == Phylogeny == The phylogeny of gharials is significantly impacted by homoplasy. These endangered reptiles are made up of two different species: Gavialis gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii. An important distinction between the two is that under morphological analysis of extant species and fossils, Tomistoma is considered a true crocodile, while Gavialis is not, with the two species' shared characteristic of fish eating being a product of homoplasy. However, molecular data suggests that the gharials are sister taxa, with their shared fish eating trait being a result of homology. Further complicating matters is molecular and morphological data suggesting that the genus of thoracosaurs emerged within the lineage of gharials, despite the fact that the now extinct thoracosaurs actually emerged much sooner than gharials. Lee and Yates conducted a study aiming to combine molecular and morphological methods in order to address this anomaly and distinguish which traits were due to homology, and which were due to homoplasy. They checked living and fossilized crocodiles for a comprehensive list of known traits, and created a supermatrix made up of 10 nuclear genes. The resulting data were analyzed by parsimony and tip dating methods. From their research, they confirmed that the two species of gharials were indeed sister taxa, meaning that the shared traits between Tomistoma and true crocodiles were a result of homoplasy. They also concluded that the only possible explanation for the data placing thoracosaurs within the gharial lineage was a significant amount of homoplastic convergence between thoracosaurs and Gavialis. Molecular studies consistently and unambiguously show the Gavialidae to be a sister group of the Crocodylidae to the exclusion of Alligatoridae, rendering Brevirostres paraphyletic and Gavialoidea perhaps polyphyletic. The clade including crocodiles and gharial has been suggested to be called Longirostres. ==References== Category:Crocodilians Category:Reptile families Category:Taxa named by Andrew Leith Adams Category:Extant Eocene first appearances Category:Priabonian taxonomic families Category:Rupelian taxonomic families Category:Chattian taxonomic families Category:Aquitanian taxonomic families Category:Burdigalian taxonomic families Category:Langhian taxonomic families Category:Serravallian taxonomic families Category:Tortonian taxonomic families Category:Messinian taxonomic families Category:Zanclean taxonomic families Category:Piacenzian taxonomic families Category:Gelasian taxonomic families Category:Calabrian taxonomic families Category:Ionian taxonomic families Category:Tarantian taxonomic families Category:Holocene taxonomic families ",
