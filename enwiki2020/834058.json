    "text": "Coat of Arms of the Dauphins of Viennois. The Counts of Albon (Comtes d'Albon) were members of the medieval nobility in what is now south-eastern France. Guigues IV, Count of Albon (d. 1142) was nicknamed le Dauphin or the Dolphin. His nickname morphed into a title among his successors. By 1293, the lands ruled by the Counts Albon, the old comitatus Albionis, were known as the Dauphin\u00e9 of Viennois (Dalphinatus Viennensis).. The titles and lands had been part of the Holy Roman Empire since 1032. They passed to Philip VI of France in 1349 on condition that the heir apparent to the French crown always be titled Dauphin, and be personal holder of the lands and titles. By condition of the Emperor, the Dauphiny could never be united to France. When the King of France had no son, he would personally rule the Dauphiny separately, as Dauphin. Thus, the province technically remained in the Holy Roman Empire even after 1349, and it was administered separately from France well into the early modern period; it was incorporated into France only de facto with the rise of absolutism, in the 17th century. ==Lords of Ch\u00e2teau d'Albon== ===House of Albon=== * Guigues I of Albon the Old (c. 1000\u20131070), Count in Oisans, Gr\u00e9sivaudan and Brian\u00e7onnais, Lord of Ch\u00e2teau d'Albon, ruled until 1070 * Guigues II of Albon the Fat (c. 1020\u20131079), Count in Gr\u00e9sivaudan and Brian\u00e7onnais, Lord of Ch\u00e2teau d'Albon, ruled 1070\u20131079 ==Counts of Albon== ===House of Albon=== * Guigues III of Albon the Count (c. 1050\u20131133), first Count of Albon (the southern part of the ancient County of Vienne; the northern part was granted to the first Count of Savoy), ruled 1079\u20131133 * Guigues IV of Albon, le Dauphin (c. 1095\u20131142), Count of Albon, ruled 1133\u20131142 ==Counts of Albon and Dauphins of Viennois== * Robert V, Count of Auvergne married Marquise d'Albon, a daughter of Guigues IV.
