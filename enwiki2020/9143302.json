On each page, readers search for four items (and for the bonus \"Uh! Oh!\" speech bubble) that provide information about each festival. The books contain facts, songs, and religious texts (such as a haggadah for the Pesach (Passover) version), as well as games, comics and drawings. The series is written and illustrated by various authors. Pitspopany Press published an entire line of \"UH! OH!\" Holiday titles that \"not only presented the basics of each Jewish holiday on a simple, easy-to-understand level, but also asked the reader to find the Holiday symbol within the busy full color spreads that appeared throughout the book\".

Oh! characters and the 4 hidden objects within one hour, then one qualifies as \"Uh! Oh! Tester\". ==Reception== The Jewish Agency for Israel describe the books as \"a wonderful activity for children and a good starting point for discussing holiday themes.\" \"Uh! Oh! Jewish Holidays\" has been described on JBooks.com as being \"[an] interactive haggadah [which] entertains children as they search for characters cleverly interspersed in Zwebner's lively illustrations.

Haggadah'\": \"interspersed among the pages of this haggadah are seek-and-find illustrations that will both teach children about the holiday (by depicting scenes from the Passover story) but keep kids busy during long stretches of the seder\" \"Teaching Jewish Holidays: History, Values, and Activities\" describes Uh!
