    "text": "Minatamis na saging (literally \"sweetened banana\") is a Filipino dessert made with saba bananas cooked in a sweet syrup (arnibal) made with muscovado sugar and water. Some recipes also add a little bit of salt and pandan leaf or vanilla extract. Other ingredients can also be added like sweet potato, sago, or other fruits. It can be eaten on its own or added as an ingredient to other desserts (notably for halo-halo). Adding the dessert over milk and shaved ice also results in another dessert known as saba kon-yelo (spelled sab\u00e1 con hielo in Spanish). ==See also== * Ice buko * Banana cue * Ginanggang * List of banana dishes * Maruya * Turon ==References== Category:Banana dishes Category:Philippine desserts Category:Snack foods ",
