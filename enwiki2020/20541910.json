In August, it participated in the raid on Belgium which led to the siege of Li\u00e8ge, then Neufch\u00e2teau, Fleurus and Orbais, and then was back in France in Maubeuge on August 21. From August 23 to September 4, the regiment covered the retreat of the French Army after the defeat at the Battle of Charleroi. The regiment was near Versailles on September 5. In the First Battle of the Marne, from September 5 to 14, the 5th Dragoons were engaged in Betz, Nanteuil, Margny, Rosi\u00e8re and Senlis. Following these successes, the regiment received the honour of adding \"L'Ourcq 1914\" on its banner.

On November 11, it arrived near Ypres, where it dug in the trenches. In February 1915, the regiment embarked for Champagne, then in March for the Vosges, where it has the honour of inscribing \"Vosges 1915\" on its banner. In May, the 5th Dragoon is in Amiens, in June in Artois where it goes back to serving in the trenches. 1916: The regiment still serves in the trenches, in groups of 200 men. Colonel Massiat replace Colonel Dauve at the commandment of the regiment. 1917: On March 19, the 5th Dragoon reaches Noyon, where it is employed in discovery missions in the surroundings of Chauny-Tergnier and then, by foot, goes back in the trenches in the Coucy sector. On August 15, Lieutenant-Colonel Bucant succeeds to Colonel Massiat. 1918: Until the end of May, the regiment remains inactive, stationed for rest. On March 18, a new change in the corps commandment brings Lieutement-Colonel Letexerant at the head of the 5th Dragoon. On May 28, the regiment brings itself towards Meaux, after a long horse march. The 5th Dragoon sets foot in Mareuil and occupies Montigny. On June 2, it attacks the enemy by foot in Marizy and Passy-en-Valois. This surprise attack, without artillery preparation, stops the progression of German troops. In July, in Villesaint, the Germans, who had taken over Dermans and Ch\u00e2teau-Tierry and has crossed the Marne are driven back, after several counter-attacks, by-foot members of the 5th Dragoon. On July 17, the regiment participates in the recapture of \u0152uilly and to the enemy's rejection on the Marne. The Second Battle of the Marne is won and the banner now bears the name of that victory: \"La Marne 1918\".

The 5th Dragoon Regiment participated in the final offensive, entering the Palatinate on December 6 and was stationed in Pirmasens from December to January 1919, then in Landau in February, then Nierstein Oppenhiem on the Rhine in July 1919.

It was not until 1925 that the 5th Dragoon returned to France, first in Auxonne and then in Gray, where it was disbanded on October 28, 1928. In November 1929 the regimental banner was entrusted to the 5e Battaillon de dragons port\u00e9s, a unit that had just been created, on March 9, 1929, replacing the 6e groupe de Chasseurs Cyclistes.: Regimental march log ===World War II=== In 1939 the 5e bataillon de dragons port\u00e9s was transformed into the \"5th Dragoon Regiment\". As part of the 1st Cavalry Division it embarked for Aisne on August 27. Following a reorganization in 1940 it passed in the 11th B.L.M. of the Arras General in February. On May 10, it is in Revin, crossed over the Meuse in Dinan and foght in Belgium until May 15, where it participated in the beautiful feat of arms of Morville which allowed the banner to bear the inscription \"Meuse 1940\". Significantly diminished, the remaining elements pulled back and took position from Hirson, after which they regrouped in Le Nouvion on May 16. On May 17, they settle as support in Oisy. On May 18, what remained of the regiment, 10 officers and 130 brigadiers and dragoons carrying about 5 cartridges each, withdraw in Bohain. While moving, they were intercepted by German tanks. After this last combat with no ammunition left, they remaining elements were taken prisoner. The survivors and the regimental batch withdraw in la Souterraine, where the regiment is disbanded. The banner was taken from the Germans and hidden in the castle of Meyrieu, where it remained until the Lib\u00e9ration. Following the model of the armistice army, the regiment was reformed in M\u00e2con in August 1940. On November 8, 1942, following the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, the regiment was sent to Toulon to participate in coastal defence, which lasted 10 days. Under Case Anton, the Germans occupied Vichy France and the regiment was disarmed at Macon on September 27. ===The Resistance=== Most of the demobilized dragoons fought on in clandestinity. Many of them, arrested by the Gestapo were tortured, massacred or died in deportation. Their sacrifice allows for the inscription \"R\u00e9sistance Bourgogne 1944\" on the regimental banner. The 5th in resistance participated in the liberation of M\u00e2con, Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne and Autun.

On April 22 and 23, 1944, it took the La Roche-la- Croix and Saint-Ours forts and participated in the capture of the Col de Larche.
