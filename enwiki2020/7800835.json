The Krupp factory was an important industrial target, Essen was a \"primary target\" designated for area bombing by the February 1942 British Area bombing directive. As part of the campaign in 1943 known as the Battle of the Ruhr, Essen was a regular target. The Germans built large-scale night-time decoys like the Krupp decoy site (German: Kruppsche Nachtscheinanlage) which was a copy of the Krupp steel works in Essen. During World War II, it was designed to divert Allied airstrikes from the actual production site of the arms factory. In the period 1939 to 1945 the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropped a total of 36,429 long tons of bombs on Essen.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html ==Bombing== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Essen World War II bombingsBomber Command Campaign Diary !width=12% | Date !width=10% | Target ! Notes |- |- | March 8/9, 1942 | | 211 RAF aircraft destroy a few Essen houses and a church, 10 people killed and 19 missing. |- | March 9/10, 1942 | |187 RAF aircraft destroy 2 buildings in Essen (72 damaged) and cause damage in 24 other Ruhr towns (particularly Hamborn and Duisburg).

No. 106 Squadron RAF was one of the bombing units. |- | March 17, 1942 | |1 RAF Wellington on a cloud-cover raid to Essen dropped its bombs somewhere in the Ruhr. |- | March 18, 19, & 21, 1942 | | RAF Wellingtons to Essen returned because of lack of cloud. |- | March 25/26, 1942 | | In the largest force sent to 1 target so far (254 aircraft), much of the Essen effort was drawn off by the decoy fire site at Rheinberg and 1 house was destroyed and 2 seriously damaged. 5 people were killed and 11 injured. |- | March 26/27, 1942 | | 2 Essen houses destroyed, 6 people killed and 14 injured. 11 of the 115 RAF bombers were lost. |- | March 31/April 1, 1942 | | 4 RAF Wellingtons, with selected crews, to Essen but only random targets were bombed by 2 aircraft. No losses. |- | June 2/3, 1942 | | The second of thousand-bomber raids on German cities: 956 RAF bombers took part. |- | March 2/3, 1943 | Krupp | 6 RAF Mosquitos to the Ruhr without loss. The aircraft which bombed Essen scored direct hits in the middle of the main Krupp factory. |- | March 5/6, 1943 | Krupp | 442 aircraft in the first raid of the Battle of the Ruhr on the night that marked RAF Bomber Command's 100,000th sortie of the war. Fourteen aircraft (4 Lancasters, 4 Wellingtons, 3 Halifaxes, 3 Stirlings) were lost: 3.2 per cent of the force. A further 56 aircraft turned back early. Three of these were Oboe-equipped Mosquito marker aircraft leaving five to mark the target. Marking was carried out 'blind', avoiding the effects of the industrial haze that usually concealed Essen. The Main Force bombed in 3 waves. Two thirds of the bomb tonnage was incendiary, the rest high-explosive. One third of the high-explosive bombs were fused for long delay. The attack lasted for 40 minutes. Reconnaissance photographs showed of destruction with buildings within the Krupp works hit by bombs. |- | March 10/11 1943 | | 2 RAF Mosquitos to Essen |- | March 12/13, 1943 | |457 RAF aircraft fly a successful Oboe-marked raid. The centre of the bombing area was across the giant Krupp factory, just west of the Essen centre, with later bombing drifting back to the north-western outskirts. Going by photographic evidence, it was believed by Bomber Command that Krupp received 30 per cent more damage on this night than on 5/6 March. |- |25/26 July 1943 | |Last raid on Essen during the Battle of the Ruhr. 705 aircraft of which 3.7 were lost.
