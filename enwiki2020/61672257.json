    "text": "Mourn the Southern Skies is the third studio album by American metal band Exhorder, released on September 20, 2019 through Nuclear Blast. It is the band's first studio release in 27 years, after their 1992 album The Law. It is also the last album to feature founding guitarist Vinnie LaBella, who left the band in February 2020. ==Overview== In November 2017, Exhorder reunited after a six-year hiatus under a new management deal with the All Independent Service Alliance (AISA). A new lineup was formed, with guitarist Marzi Montazeri, formerly of Superjoint Ritual and Philip H. Anselmo & The Illegals, bassist Jason Viebrooks, currently of Heathen and formerly of Grip Inc., and drummer Sasha Horn of Forbidden; with vocalist Kyle Thomas and guitarist Vinnie LaBella as the only two remaining original members. In February 2018, they performed two shows at the Saint Vitus Bar in Brooklyn, New York City, and later that year, they signed with Nuclear Blast. In July 2019, the band released the single \"My Time\", and announced that Mourn the Southern Skies is to be released on September 20, 2019. The album contains a re-recording of \"Ripping Flesh\", a song taken from their 1986 demo album Get Rude. Chris Nail, former drummer of the band, played drums on the re-recording. ==Critical reception== ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. ===Exhorder=== * Kyle Thomas \u2013 vocals * Vinnie LaBella \u2013 guitars, executive producer * Marzi Montazeri \u2013 guitars * Jason Viebrooks \u2013 bass * Sasha Horn - drums ===Additional musicians=== * Mikey \"B3\" Burkart \u2013 organ * Chris Nail \u2013 drums ===Production=== * Duane Simoneaux \u2013 production, recording * Jens Bogren \u2013 mixing, mastering * Tony Lindgren \u2013 mastering * Travis Smith \u2013 artwork * Dante Torrieri \u2013 photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Mourn the Southern Skies at nuclearblast.com Category:2019 albums Category:Exhorder albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums ",
