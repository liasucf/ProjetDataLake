Guatemala had a massive immigration of Germans in the nineteenth century. The government of Justo Rufino Barrios provided them with farmlands for coffee in the departments of Quetzaltenango, Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz, and by the early 20th century Germans populated Guatemala City, Zacapa and Jutiapa. Guatemala currently has a strong community of Germans who make up the majority of European immigrants in the country, and it is also the most numerous German community in all Central American countries. In the 1940s, 8,000 German immigrants lived in Guatemala. During World War II several hundred Germans were expelled to the United States by the Guatemalan government as part of the Deportation of Germans from Latin America during World War II.

Cob\u00e1n later came to be monopolized by German trade in wholesale stores, but they and, to a greater extent, the fincas dispersed throughout almost the entire region of Alta Verapaz. They paid workers with coins minted by each owner. These currencies could only purchase in the company store of the finca, whereby the employer obtained extra pecuniary gain.Revista D Deutschland en la Verapaz Retrieved, 07/12/2014. The first German immigrant to Guatemala was Rodolfo Dieseldorff, (My great great grandfather, Herman Kunze, came to Guatemala earlier than 1863, since he married my great great grandmother, Dolores de Le\u00f3n in Xelaj\u00fa in 1861, when he was 23 years old, so Mr. Dieseldorff couldn't have been the first) in 1863, whereof he spoke very well of the place, and many Germans followed. According to the book The Germans in Guatemala, 1828-1944 by Regina Wagner, what attracted Germans to Verapaz was its \"natural insulation, mild climate and fertile soil, and the possibilities of agricultural and commercial development.\" By the end of 1890, two-thirds of coffee production in that region was in hands of Germans. Delivery of coffee on a German farm. With the passage of time, the economy of Alta Verapaz became entirely headed by Germans, and formed its own world in Alta Verapaz, organized in a very united and supportive community. They had social activities at the German Club, or Deutsche Verein, in Cob\u00e1n, founded in 1888, later renamed the Charitable Society. Initially, this group had only German members. The Cob\u00e1n German Club was improved upon, being equipped so as to lend a pleasant environment where Germans could feel at home. A library was formed with donated books and magazines brought back by those who traveled to Germany. Today it is the Charitable Society. Dieseldorff formed a complex of farms over three periods: between 1890 and 1898 it acquired the Seact\u00e9, Chiachal, Click, SECAC-Ulpan, Santa Margarita, Paija, Panzal and El Salto farms; between 1898 and 1910 became the Raxpec, Santa Cecilia, Cubilg\u00fcitz, Chamcarel and Sacchicagua of Secol, San Diego-Yalpemech, Chichochoc, Chicha\u00edc Santa Margarita, Rio Frio Pocola and estates; and, after 1924, it acquired the Sachamach, Tzimajil, Chiquixj\u00ed Raxah\u00e1 and haciendas.

This is the largest German community in Central America. It is difficult to know exactly the number of Guatemalans of German descent, counting only in Alta Verapaz, Zacapa and Guatemala City there are a large number of descendants of German (and without other strong areas of Quetzaltenango, Baja Verapaz, El Peten, Sacatepequez and El Progreso). It should be taken into account that in Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz many German settlers were mixed with indigenous Q'eqchi' women, and German settlers in the capital and eastern were mixed with mestizo or white/Spanish origin women. In conclusion, the number of Guatemalans of full German origin is very low. Currently, there are still people with German last names like Winther, Euler, Buechsel, Henstenberg, Quirin, Kouffer,Wellmann, Noack, etc. Guatemalans with German ancestry share Spanish language and German. The majority professes Protestantism or Catholicism followed by those who are Atheists, Agnostics and Jews. Many kept German traditions and holidays. The descendants of the Gregg and Dieseldorff family still have several fincas in Alta Verapaz where coffee is still grown. === Notable Guatemalan Germans === * Luis von Ahn, Professor, Entrepreneur. * Jacobo Arbenz, president of Guatemala (1951-1954). * Arabella Arbenz, actress and model. * Eduardo Suger, politician.

Several Lutheran German missionaries arrived in Guatemala . Some of these belonged to the Nazi Party. ==== Otto Langmann ==== The arrival of Pastor Otto Langmann (1898\u20131956) in 1930 in Guatemala can be described as the beginning of the Nazis in the German Colony. He supported an evangelical community in Guatemala; a year later he joined the NSDAP and founded the first Nazi groups abroad,In: Die Deutschen in Guatemala 1930-194, 30. November 2009, Ein Pfarrer f\u00fcr Guatemala Shortly after his arrival in Guatemala, which came with some members of the congregation, Langmann was the founder of the Epiphany of the Evangelical Church in Guatemala, Langmann had a very important role in rural areas of Guatemala and Guatemala City === the family Dieseldorff === The Family Dieseldorff in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala The name Dieseldorff means a lot to the people of Alta Verapaz. Besides having several coffee farms in the region, were the first Germans who came to the department. In 1934, when the German consul invited all members of the community to receive the new German ambassador; the Dieseldorff family were not invited, because they were not considered as pure Aryans, as they had Jewish blood. By the end of his long career at sea, Dieseldorff Gual\u00e1n chose, Zacapa as his place to retire. There, he experimented with the cultivation of cotton, but lost his crops due to pests. This forced him to start a new trade (coffee) which brought him to Alta Verapaz, where he settled. The descendants of this family still have several farms in Alta Verapaz where coffee is still grown. === Nazi Sympathizers === Among Germans who immigrated in the 1930s were followers of National Socialism. Not all immigrants were followers. The older, present generations in Alta Verap\u00e1z were not demonstrably attracted to the movement nor the Nazi party. In 1933, with the accession of National Socialist Movement in Germany, Nazi patriotic and cultural anniversaries began to appear in the small confines of Cob\u00e1n and Alta Verap\u00e1z, and a local National Socialist Party formed among Germans there. It has been claimed that in the mid-1930s all Germans in Alta Verapaz were Nazis; however, this claim is unfounded, as it is only anecdotal, and not all of German descent were in effect also Nazi. One writer does note that \"there wasn't a German finca where the Nazi flag did not occupy a place of honor, nor a German finquero who did not participate in local events organized by the Nazis.\" In 1938, a seminal event impacted the German community in La Verapaz; the Third Reich asking their expatriate citizens to vote on the German annexation of Austria, the Anschluss. Some Germans in Guatemala held dual citizenship. A German boat anchored in Puerto Barrios to facilitate the vote. Those who attended were designated as sympathizers of Adolf Hitler. In 1936, 381 Germans in Guatemala voted for Adolf Hitler. Subsequently, most of these were deported, under pressure from the United States, for supporting the Nazi Party. Cabinetry-maker Heinrich Gundelach and Protestant pastor Otto Langmann were founders of the Party's organization in Cob\u00e1n. According to the book Almas Gemelas by Regina Wagner, that same year (1938) the long-since present German School formed a Hitler Youth, practiced the salute, and discussed National Socialist race theory, disregarding that the German school also had students of Jewish descent. Thomas M. Leonard notes in The General History of Guatemala that the Buenos Aires newspaper Cr\u00edtica de Buenos Aires reported in 1938 that Germany was building airfields in Guatemala. This claim was found to be untrue, but nonetheless garnered Washington's alarm, considering Guatemala to be the core of Nazi propaganda in Central America, as three quarters of the German population of the entire Central American isthmus at the time lived in Guatemala.Gemma Gil Fascismo en Guatemala Revista D Guatemala, 18/12/2007.
