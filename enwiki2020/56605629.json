It was written by Shakira, Paul, Guetta, Majasty Jones, Emily Warren, Rosina Russell, Ina Wroldsen, Raoul Lionel Chen, Jack Patterson and Giorgio Tuinfort, with production handled by Guetta, Patterson, Tuinfort, Jason Jigzagula Henriques, Banx & Ranx and 1st Klase. The song was released via Island Records on 16 February 2018, as the fourth single from Paul's EP Mad Love the Prequel. ==Background== The song was first revealed in June 2017; by local Islands label singer/song wrighter Majasty Jones. It initially featured Colombian singer Shakira instead of Becky G. Speaking about the song, Sean Paul explained: \"I got something kind of more poppy coming in a little while, with Shakira. The song's called 'Mad Love', it's about being mad and having love, it's more sexy. It's not about love, it's the sexiness.\" Paul later revealed in an interview with Billboard in August 2017 that the song was intended to be titled \"Temple\". Paul said of the song in a press release: \"I've been working on this record for a long time. It was a pleasure to work with David Guetta and his team as we got the production to the perfect sound. It was also great to work with Becky G and her team. Nuff love to all of them! The song is full of energy and I can't wait for people to hear it!\" Guetta added that they spent two years working on the song, and he is grateful that the song is finally getting released. He is proud of the track, praising Paul for his \"unique style\" and Becky G for her vocals, which \"just make everything come together\". Becky G declared that she appreciates the opportunity to work with \"an icon like Sean\". She regarded \"Mad Love\" as a song that \"brings people together\" and \"give you the energy you need to get up and get on the dance floor\". ==Critical reception== Xavier Hamilton of Vibe wrote that the song manages to \"embody every aspect of a modern pop record\" and \"add to all of the artists' cross-cultural popularity\". Rap-Up called it an \"island-flavored collaboration\" and a \"dance floor-ready track\". Chantilly Post of HotNewHipHop deemed it \"a pop, radio-friendly track\", writing \"David provides a bouncy EDM beat that hears Becky and Sean sing about vibing and hitting it off to the 'tempo' of a song.\" ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Sean Paul \u2013 composition, vocals * David Guetta \u2013 composition, production * Shakira \u2013 composition, production * Becky G \u2013 vocals * Emily Warren \u2013 composition * Jack Patterson \u2013 composition, production * Rosina Russell \u2013 composition * Giorgio Tuinfort \u2013 composition, production * Ina Wroldson \u2013 composition * Raoul Lionel Chen \u2013 composition * Jason Jigzagula Henriques \u2013 production * Banx & Ranx \u2013 production * 1st Klase \u2013 production * Chris Athens \u2013 master engineering * Zacharie Raymond \u2013 bass guitar, background vocals, drums, programming, synthesizer * Yannick Rastogi \u2013 bass guitar, background vocals, drums, programming, synthesizer * Serban Ghenea \u2013 mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Bolivia (Monitor Latino) | 11 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Colombia (National-Report) | 79 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Croatia (HRT) | 48 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ecuador (National-Report) | 55 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 43 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI) | 64 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Guatemala (Monitor Latino) | 18 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 63 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (Latvijas Top 40) | 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mexico Airplay (Billboard) | 40 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Norway (VG-lista) | 20 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Romania (Airplay 100) | 10 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Serbia (Radiomonitor) | 3 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 4 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Venezuela (National-Report) | 48 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Germany (Official German Charts) | 62 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Dance Top 40) | 55 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (R\u00e1di\u00f3s Top 40) | 31 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | 45 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Top 100) | 85 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Poland (ZPAV) | 45 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal Full Track Download (AFP) | 155 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Romania (Airplay 100) | 36 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 31 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1855 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | 16 February 2018 | | Island | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | 20 February 2018 | Rhythmic contemporary radio | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy | 16 March 2018 | Contemporary hit radio | Universal | http://radiodate.it/radio-date/sean-paul-david-guetta-feat-becky-g-mad- love-177556-16-03-2018-radiodate/ |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Sean Paul songs Category:David Guetta songs Category:Becky G songs Category:Island Records singles Category:Songs written by Sean Paul Category:Songs written by David Guetta Category:Songs written by Emily Warren (songwriter) Category:Songs written by Shakira Category:Songs written by Jack Patterson (Clean Bandit) Category:Songs written by Giorgio Tuinfort Category:Songs written by Ina Wroldsen Category:Song recordings produced by David Guetta ",
