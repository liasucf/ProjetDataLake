While working for Rogers, Moore helped broker a deal to gain control of national broadcast rights for the NHL over BCE Inc., including Hockey Night In Canada. However, ratings declined due to the lack of success for Canadian teams in the NHL and the replacement of Ron MacLean with George Stroumboulopoulos. Moore left the company in 2018. ==References== Category:Canadian television executives Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Ryerson University alumni Category:Canadian investigative journalists Category:Canadian sports journalists Category:Canadian Screen Award winning people ",
