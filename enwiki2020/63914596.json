(1984\u20132000) and deputy mayor of Naxxar (1992\u20132000). ==Early life== Described by Armstrong and Mitchell as \"a wealthy individual from a patrician background with a love of football\", \"fast-talking, ebullient and indiscreet\", \"diminutive yet confident\", Michael Zammit Tabona is the son of an entrepreneur who established Malta's second hotel in British colonial times, with a distant family connection to Lord Mountbatten. Michael attended St. Edward's College, where he was a difficult boarding pupil, then studied languages and hotel management in Switzerland. In 1973, at 21, he was back in Malta, managing a hotel from the family properties. He also started purchasing second-hand vessels and renting them for advertising to the Captain Morgan rum company; he later retained the brand for a new cruising company, today among the leading ones in Malta. Zammit Tabona led the development of package holidays for British tourists to Malta in the 1970s and 1980s, catering to up to 30,000 holidaymakers annually.

Mitchell, Routledge 2008 He also held shared of Manchester United and had good connections in the board of directors of the British football club. == Presidency of Naxxar F.C. == In 1984 Zammit Tabona bought a palace in Naxxar; he went on to become President of the local FC Naxxar football club, bringing it from third division to the Maltese premiere league, thanks to an influx of former British players, including Paul Mariner, David Johnson, Paul O'Berg, as well as coach Simon Lane. Naxxar F.C. also became a cradle for Maltese- Nigerian football players. In 1987 he invited Manchester United F.C. to play a friendly match with Naxxar F.C., which became a local feat, right the day before the 1987 Maltese general election; the sources of financing for the 3-days event have remained disputed since. Zammit Tabona's Naxxar F.C. got embroiled in a dispute with the Malta Football Association around match- fixture, with Zammit Tabona claiming to denounce such fixture to the media. Naxxar F.C. was relegated two divisions and Zammit Tabona was suspended from the club presidency (which was offered to his wife), until he was reinstated two years later. Naxxar F.C. earned its budget of 35,000 Maltese lira per year from the income of the club bar in the village square, as well as control of parking lots at the annual trade fair, and supporters' club barbeques. Zammit Tabona is reported to have personally invested in the club 40 to 50,000 Lm per season, including for the wages and accommodation of foreign players.

He then left the post in the local council to his 18-year-old daughter.

A donor to the Labour Party, after the 2013 elections Zammit Taboona was rewarded with a diplomatic post as non-resident ambassador to Finland. He kept posting racist and xenophobic memes, as well as links to fear-mongering articles, on his Facebook profile.

Zammit Tabona\u2019s cooperative was also awarded by Transport Malta the exclusive rights to the jetties in \u010airkewwa, Blue Lagoon, and Santa Marija Bay. His company also won the tender for the proposed Gozo fast ferry, which was later shot down by the Public Contracts Review Board because of irregularities.
