He first worked as an actor in films as a child, portraying roles in the Vijayakanth-starrer Periya Marudhu (1994) and in Sakthi Chidambaram's Samrat (1997). ==Career== In 2012, Kumar finished working on a coming-of-age film titled Hi Da directed by Brindha Das, which had music composed by Vishal Chandrasekhar.Though the soundtrack and an official trailer were released, the film did not have a theatrical release. He then appeared in Radha Mohan's bilingual film Gouravam (2013), in both the Tamil and Telugu version. In early 2013, he completed a film titled Ayul Regai Neeyadi, where he worked alongside a new technical team. Despite having an audio launch event, the film also failed to have a theatrical release. Vijay Sekar's Kaathal Kasakkuthaiya was also completed but unreleased. Another film titled Kalaintha Kanavugal by director Kabilan, examining the relationship between parents and their children, also failed to be completed. In 2013, Kumar worked in the lead role in Rasu Jaganathan's Saranalayam co-starring actress Sri Priyanka. Upon completion, the film failed to find distributors and remained unreleased for five years. It later had a low-profile release across Tamil Nadu in February 2018, with a reviewer from Iflicks.com noting, \"Ashwin Kumar plays the protagonist and has done a decent job\". Kumar has enjoyed more success in television. His most high-profile work to date has been appearances in the lead role in the serials Thamarai and Kula Deivam since 2014 and 2015, respectively. In early 2017, he began work on the television serial Lakshmi Kalyanam as Kalyan, one of the lead roles. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Film !Role !Language |- | 1994 || Periya Marudhu || Child artist || Tamil |- | 1997 || Samrat || Child artist || Tamil |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2013 || Gouravam || rowspan=\"2\"| || Tamil |- | Gouravam || Telugu |- | 2018 || Saranalayam || || Tamil |} ==Television== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Channel ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes |- | 2009\u20132012 || Chellamay || Maniyarasu ||rowspan=4|Sun TV || Supporting role |- | 2014 || 10 Mani Kathaigal || Ethir Veetu Paiyan ||rowspan=2| Male lead |- | 2014\u20132018 || Thamarai || Dwarakesh Raghavan |- | 2017\u20132018 || Kula Deivam || Arjun || Supporting role |- |rowspan=2|2017 || Lakshmi Kalyanam || Kalyaan|| Vijay TV || Male lead |- |Neeli || Sathya || Vijay TV || Cameo |- | 2017\u20132019|| Azhagiya Tamil Magal || Gowtham || Zee Tamil || Supporting role |- | 2018 || Sumangali || Selvam ||rowspan=3|Sun TV || Supporting role |- | 2019 || Tamil Selvi || Amudhan ||Male lead (Replaced by Vijay) |- | 2020\u2013Present || Chithi 2 ||Anbuselvan || Supporting role |- |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:Tamil male actors Category:Tamil male television actors Category:Television personalities from Tamil Nadu Category:Male actors from Tamil Nadu Category:Male actors in Tamil cinema Category:21st-century Tamil male actors Category:1987 births ",
