    "text": "The Church of Saint Augustine (Italian: Chiesa di Sant'Agostino) is a Gothic church of Palermo. It is located near the market of the Capo, in the quarter of the Seralcadio, within the historic centre of Palermo. The church is also called Santa Rita, because of the devotion to this Augustinian saint. The church was built during the Angevin period replacing an earlier church that dated back to the Hauteville era. The building was subject to subsequent changes over the centuries. In the 18th century the sculptor Giacomo Serpotta created a sumptuous stucco decoration inside the church. == External links == * Gaspare Palermo, Guida istruttiva per potersi conoscere tutte le magnificenze della Citt\u00e0 di Palermo, Volume IV, Palermo, Reale Stamperia, 1816 Agostino Category:Gothic architecture in Palermo Category:13th-century Roman Catholic church buildings ",
