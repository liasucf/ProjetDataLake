    "text": "Mt Ebenezer in 1986 Mount Ebenezer Station is a pastoral lease that operates as a cattle station in the Northern Territory. It is situated about north east of Yulara and south west of Alice Springs. The lease shares a boundary with other pastoral leases including Angas Downs to the west, Lyndavale to the south, Erldunda to the south east and Palmer Valley to the north west. The Lasseter Highway bisects the property from east to west. The property takes its name from the peak Mount Ebenezer that is found in the Baselow Range within the station boundaries. Mount Ebenezer is named after Ebenezer Flint who was delivering supplies to telegraph stations in the area in 1871. The pastoralist, Richard Warburton, took up Erldunda Station to the east of Mount Ebenezer in 1822. Warburton is thought to have passed through the area while mustering stray cattle. William Liddle took up the nearby Angas Downs Station in 1922. The Mount Ebenezer Roadhouse was closed for several months in 2012. When William O'Donnell signed a lease to reopen the roadhouse he was driven from the property by a spear wielding Indigenous man. The owners of the roadhouse terminated the contract shortly afterward. As of 2014 the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others in the Kimberley and Northern Territory. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==References== ==Further reading== Robert Casey's trip to Australia in April 1986 Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:Pastoral leases in the Northern Territory ",
