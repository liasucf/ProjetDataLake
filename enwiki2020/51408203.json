    "text": "The knockout stages of the 2016 Copa do Brasil was played from August 24 to November 26, 2014. A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout stages. A draw by CBF was held on August 2 to set the matches for this round. The 16 qualified teams were divided in two pots. Teams from pot 1 are the ones who competed at the 2016 Copa Libertadores and the best placed team in the 2015 Brazilian S\u00e9rie A not taking part in the 2016 Copa Libertadores plus the two highest CBF ranked teams qualified via the Third Round. Pot 2 is composed of the other teams that qualified through the Third Round. Each pot was divided into 4 pairs according to the CBF ranking. That division makes sure that each team within a pair will not face each other before the finals as they will be placed in opposite sides of the bracket. There was a draw to decide the home team of the round of 16. The following stages will have other draws to determine the order of the matches as the tournament advances. ==Seeding== *2016 CBF ranking shown in brackets. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=\"190\"|Pot 1 !width=\"190\"|Pot 2 |- | * Corinthians (1) * Gr\u00eamio (2) * Cruzeiro (3) * Santos (4) * S\u00e3o Paulo (5) * Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro (7) * Palmeiras (8) * Internacional (9) | * Fluminense (10) * Vasco da Gama (11) * * Botafogo (13) * Ponte Preta (17) * Fortaleza (42) * Botafogo (56) * Juventude (59) * |} === Bracket === ==Round of 16== The first legs was played on August 24\u2013September 1 and the second legs was played on September 21\u201322, 2016. |} ===Match 71=== \\---- Tied 2\u20132 on aggregate, Juventude won on away goals. ===Match 72=== \\---- Corinthians won 2\u20131 on aggregate. ===Match 73=== \\---- Santos won 5\u20133 on aggregate. ===Match 74=== \\---- Palmeiras won 3\u20131 on aggregate. ===Match 75=== \\---- Tied 1\u20131 on aggregate, Gr\u00eamio won on penalties. ===Match 76=== \\---- Internacional won 3\u20131 on aggregate. ===Match 77=== \\---- Cruzeiro won 6\u20132 on aggregate. ===Match 78=== \\---- Tied 3\u20133 on aggregate, Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro won on away goals. ==Quarterfinals== The first leg was played on September 28 and the second leg was played on October 19, 2016. |} ===Match 79=== \\---- Tied 1\u20131 on aggregate, Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro won on penalties. ===Match 80=== \\---- Internacional won 3\u20132 on aggregate. ===Match 81=== \\---- Gr\u00eamio won 3\u20132 on aggregate. ===Match 82=== \\---- Cruzeiro won 5\u20134 on aggregate. ==Semifinals== The first leg was played on October 26 and the second leg was played on November 2, 2016. |} ===Match 83=== \\---- Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro won 4\u20133 on aggregate. ===Match 84=== \\---- Gr\u00eamio won 2\u20130 on aggregate. ==Finals== The first leg will be played on November 23 and the second leg will be played on November 30, 2016. |} ===Match 85=== ===Match 86=== Gr\u00eamio won 4\u20132 on aggregate. ==Notes== ==References== knockout stages ",
