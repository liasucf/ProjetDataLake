It's mainly oriented on the LGBT citizens of Split. == History == It was established on March 4, 2013, by 2012 Split Pride volunteers. Ri\u0161pet founded LGBT Center Split, place dedicated to LGBT community, their families, friends and all those who want to take part in the activities of the Centre. Ri\u0161pet also co-organized Split Pride. The purpose of Ri\u0161pet is to deal with problems of violence towards LGBT persons, to empower and educate the community, thereby making it more sensible to LGBT problematics. Ri\u0161pet also organized various formal and informal activities for the local LGBT community, including film screenings, thematic workshops, exhibitions, public forums, Pride marches, festivals and conferences in Croatia and the region. Past achievements of Ri\u0161pet are based on a large volunteer potential of the local LGBT community. Given that those accomplishments are achieved only thanks to the volunteers and collaboration with other NGOs, without any financial resources. Ri\u0161pet educated volunteers about the position of LGBT people in Croatia, as well as on methods and possibilities of their participation in the struggle for realization of the rights for a decent life, free of violence and discrimination. It wants to encourage them to think critically questioning the patriarchy, heteronormativity and the generally process of re- traditionalization and models that inhibit the development of democratic processes based on the principles of equality, justice and freedom. The intention of Ri\u0161pet is that young volunteers take part as the leaders in various activities of the LGBT center. == Status == As of 2018 Ri\u0161pet is no longer active and organizing of Split Pride and managing of LGBT Center Split have been picked up by group of organizations from the city with the support of City of Split. Organization is officially removed from register of NGOs in February, 2020. ==References== Category:Split, Croatia Category:Human rights organizations based in Croatia Category:2013 establishments in Croatia Category:Organizations established in 2013 Category:LGBT organizations based in Europe ",
