    "text": "The Virgin Wolves are an American rock band that formed in Denton, Texas, featuring five members, many of whom have been involved in other successful projects: Chase Robbins (of Memphis May Fire), Jaimeson Robbins, Kristin Leigh (solo), Steve Phillips, and Carson Coldiron. ==Biography== Drawing inspiration from artists like Led Zeppelin and legendary bluesman Howlin' Wolf, The Virgin Wolves are predominantly upbeat rock 'n roll with a twist of fierce, bluesy, in your face vocals. Their live shows are unparalleled in terms of energy and sex appeal. Guitarist Chase Robbins and vocalist Jaimeson Robbins, who alongside a single Macbook, formed The Virgin Wolves in early 2010 by playing venues and house shows in the North Texas area. With the addition of bass player Kristin Leigh and drummer Steve Phillips, their live show was catapulted to a new level of energy. In late 2010, guitarist Carson Coldiron became the fifth and final member added to the band's rock 'n roll repertoire, filling out their overall sound. What started as humble beginnings, steadily developed into one of the best indie rock \u2018n roll-blues bands in the region. TVW has been featured on \u201cThe Local Show,\" on Dallas's Clear Channel station 102.1 The Edge, as well as radio stations ranging from Houston to Maine. In just a short time on the scene, the band has garnered the attention of numerous music blogs, college newspapers and various other media outlets. Their first EP, \"V,\" released in June 2010, set the stage for the band to play larger shows, as they began drawing in an eager and diverse audience. In March 2011, TVW played the 35 Conferette, Denton's annual music festival which boasts larger national acts such as Reggie Watts, Mavis Staples, Dr. Dog and more. One month later they released \"Bad Blood,\" their second and most highly praised EP, for which audiences have responded to with excitement. During the summer of 2011, The Virgin Wolves toured up and down the East Coast, making fans and impressing venues, leaving a lasting and longing impression wherever they went. This year, TVW has opened for such acts as The Darkness, and has begun pre-production for their third studio album, and first full length, set to be released December 21, 2012. As Robbie D. Love from rockandrollblues.com puts it, \"We definitely believe The Virgin Wolves will leave their stain on rock 'n roll as innovators of the genre. They know how to get down and dirty, tell a shipwrecked story, break some shit and get out before anybody realizes the walls just burnt down to the ground.\" Bio By: Rachel Watts Contributing Writer with NTDaily.com and DayBowBow.net, and Kristin Spencer. ==Members== * Chase Robbins \u2013 vocals, guitar * Jaimeson Robbins \u2013 vocals * Kristin Leigh \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Steven Phillips \u2013 drums, percussion * Carson Coldiron- guitar, backing vocals ==Discography== === Studio Albums === * Pretty Little Thing (2012) === EPs === * V (2010) * Bad Blood (2011) Bad blood- Recorded at The School of Rock in Dallas, TX by Seth Falkner.
