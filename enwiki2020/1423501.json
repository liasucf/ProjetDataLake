Ben Johnson's Former Coach, Charlie Francis Dies of Cancer www.adriansprints.com. Retrieved 2011-05-10 Francis was coach at the Scarborough Optimists track and field club when Johnson joined the club at age 15. He later admitted under oath at the Canadian Federal Justice Charlie Dubin Inquiry into Drug Use in Sport that Ben Johnson had used steroids to improve his performances since 1981; Francis had coached Johnson until the latter's infamous 1988 Seoul Olympics disqualification. He was also a vocal critic of the IOC testing procedure and claimed that performance-enhancing drug use is rampant within the sport. Francis also coached famous sprinters Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones for a time in 2003; Francis, Jones, and Montgomery initially attempted to cover up their association but it soon became clear that the athletes were working with him. Francis had claimed for years that elite athletes could not compete at the highest levels without steroids, but when the media became aware of Francis' association with Jones and Montgomery, he stated that he had never worked with such talented athletes and that they did not need steroids to succeed at the elite level. Both were later implicated, with Montgomery admitting his drug use to a grand jury and Jones going to prison for lying to a grand jury about her drug use. Francis was not named as being involved in these specific drug use cases. He also became a highly sought after personal trainer, working with clients ranging from businessmen to professional athletes in the NBA, NFL, and NHL, including former Toronto Maple Leaf forward Tie Domi, who hired Francis to help him become a better all-round athlete.Francis was more than just a coach - London Free Press He authored two books on sprinting: Speed Trap and Training for Speed, and was the owner/operator of a highly popular (amongst sprinters) internet sprint training forum. ==Death== In 2005 he was diagnosed with Mantle Cell Lymphoma, a form of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Francis died Wednesday May 12, 2010 at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital after a five-year battle with the disease shortly after a match had been found for stem cell therapy, according to statement from his family.
