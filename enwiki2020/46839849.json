    "text": "Psycho Bunny is a men\u2019s clothing company based in New York, founded in 2005 by Robert Godley and Robert Goldman. Founders Godley and Goldman have each spent decades working within the luxury menswear industry, with Godley gaining expertise through working with numerous high-end European designers, and Goldman, who grew up in the family business of luxury neckties. Handmade from English silk, their first collection of neckties introduced the signature long-eared, crossbone-clad lagomorph icon to the world. Inspired by the 17th- century non-conformist maritime marauders and secret societies like the infamous Skull & Bones, Godley sketched a logo on a napkin. \"When I showed that tie to a buyer, she said, 'Look at the psycho bunny!'\" Godley says. \"The name stuck.\" \"The schoolboy romance of it is this whole Jolly Roger thing,\" says Godley. \"In the 17th century, pirates were the democracy. They're all about risk and reward.\" Psycho Bunny's staple polos are \"made in Peru with luxury detailing like mother of pearl buttons. They\u2019re also embroidered with the Psycho Bunny logo, a maniacal-looking rabbit over skull and bones insignia.\" Since the launch of the Psycho Bunny neckwear collection, the brand has expanded into polo shirts; T-shirts; bottoms; cashmere scarves and socks; and golf apparel. Psycho Bunny opened its first US retail presence, a pop-up shop, in Miami's Aventura Mall in November 2018. A formal store is anticipated there in 2019. The US store joins the brand's other global retail outlets in markets such as Japan and South America. In May 2019, The Psycho Bunny pop-up store at Aventura mall won the Gold Award for \u201cMost Creative Pop-up Store Design\u201d at the 2019 International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) awards. The annual competition recognizes the outstanding work done by exceptional visual merchandisers and retailers all across the globe. The store evokes cutting edge design and visual appeal, setting the stage for the future of retail shop concepts. == References == Category:Clothing manufacturers ",
