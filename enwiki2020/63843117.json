    "text": "St. Valentine's Day Massacre was a planned live television supercard event that would have been presented by Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). The event would have taken place February 10, 1996, at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California and been broadcast on Prime Sports Network.https://i.imgur.com/UiRZ1W9.jpg The event was the planned sequel to the Blackjack Brawl event from September 1994. That show concluded with the promise of a rematch between Steve Williams and Sid Vicious inside a steel cage. However, Vicious signed a one-year contract with WWE at the beginning of 1995, and was therefore unavailable until the beginning of 1996. Zoogz Rift worked for the promotion at the time and confirmed that although a deal was signed with Prime Sports Network, Herb Abrams spent the money on his cocaine addiction.http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm The show never occurred, and Abrams died from a cocaine-related heart attack in July 1996. ==Cancelled card== ==See also== *UWF Beach Brawl *UWF Blackjack Brawl *UWF Fury Hour ==References== Category:1996 in professional wrestling Category:1996 in sports in California Category:February 1996 events in the United States Category:Prime Network Category:Professional wrestling in Los Angeles Category:Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) ",
