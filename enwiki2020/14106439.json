(IABA) is the national governing body for amateur boxing on the island of Ireland, developing and controlling the sport. Founded in 1911, the IABA operates from the National Stadium in Dublin, the only purpose built amateur boxing stadium in the world. ==Structure== The Irish Athletic Boxing Association organises, develops, fosters and controls amateur boxing across Ireland (including Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland); it is the national governing body (NGB) for amateur boxing. Boxing clubs in Ireland are represented and supported at county, provincial and national level. Boxing clubs affiliate to the IABA and are then entitled to compete at each of these three levels. The IABA has established six 'provincial councils' for Ulster, Leinster, Connacht, Munster, Antrim, and Dublin. Although Antrim and Dublin are not among the four traditional provinces of Ireland, separate councils were set up due to large volumes of boxing clubs in these two areas. Each county in Ireland is also represented by its own 'county board'. ==History pre-1936== The association was originally called the Irish Athletic Boxing Association. It led a nomadic existence, holding events, tournaments and boxing shows at many different venues. With the popularity of amateur boxing surging amongst the working class population, it was decided that a headquarters for the IABA and amateur boxing was required. ==National Stadium== In 1937, the IABA proposed to construct a stadium solely for the purposes of boxing. The cost of building the National Stadium was over \u00a312,000 (IEP), a considerable sum at the time. In 1939, the National Stadium, located in Dublin, was completed and officially opened. It was later renovated and modernised in 2000. The National Stadium is the only purpose built boxing stadium in the world. The Stadium is still managed by the IABA and has been in use for national and international boxing events ever since its official opening. The High Performance Unit is based at the National Stadium. The IABA changed its company name from Irish Amateur Boxing Association to Irish Athletic Boxing Association (IABA) in January 2016, following a directive issued by AIBA, the international governing body, to all National Boxing Federations to remove the word 'Amateur' from the name of each individual Federation.http://www.sportireland.ie/Media/Latest_News/2016/February/Irish_Amateur_Boxing_Association_IABA_Set_To_Change_Name_To_Irish_Athletic_Boxing_Association_.html ==Olympic success== Michael Carruth and Katie Taylor are the only Irish boxers to win a gold medal in the sport. Michael Carruth won Gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and exactly 20 years to the week later, Katie Taylor won Gold at the London 2012 Olympics. She was the first Irish woman to qualify and compete in an Olympic boxing event. Taylor won her Olympic debut over Great Britain's Natasha Jonas with a 26\u201315 score. An International Olympic Committee official said that the decibels hit 113.7 \u2013 the highest crowd levels recorded at London 2012 so far. Paddy Barnes made history in 2012 by being the first Irish boxer to ever win two Olympic Medals at two consecutive Olympics \u2013 only two Irish athletes have managed this. The team that represented Irish boxing at the London 2012 Olympics has been the most successful IABA boxing Olympic Team since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. The London 2012 team consisted of: * Darren O'Neill 75 kg Paulstown BC (Team Captain) * Adam Nolan 69 kg Bray BC * Katie Taylor 60 kg Bray BC * John Joe Nevin 56 kg Cavan BC * Michael Conlan 52 kg St John Bosco Belfast BC * Paddy Barnes 49 kg Holy Family Belfast BC ==2016 Rio Olympics== In October 2015 the head coach of the IABA's High Performance Unit, Billy Walsh, left for the US to train the USA women's team.http://sportsnewsireland.com/other_sports/loss-of-billy-walsh-what-has- happened-since/ Although discussions on a new contract for Walsh had been on- going for several months, Walsh claimed the IABA \"changed their stance on virtually every detail\" of a new contract offer.http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/structural-changes-rather- than-financial-motives-behind-billy-walshs-decision-to-quit-for- us-31481440.html The Irish Sports Council (Sport Ireland) publicly blamed the IABA for the loss of Walsh. The IABA, in return, refuted what it called the \"disgraceful allegations\" of Sports Ireland and claimed that Walsh left for financial reasons, and that Sports Ireland was using this loss to take control of the IABA's High Performance Unit.http://sportsnewsireland.com/other_sports/boxing-iaba-launches- astonishing-attack-on-irish-sports-council-let-battle-commence/ Ireland's performance in the 2016 Rio Olympics boxing events was unsuccessful, with Ireland not featuring in any medal positions, despite having a number of seeded boxers. The USA women's team had its best performance ever. ==Developments after 2016 Rio Olympics== In 2017 Sports Ireland published a review, the \u2018Rio Review\u2019, which said the boxing team's performance at the 2016 Games was not \u2018a blip in an otherwise outstanding success story\u2019 but the result of \u2018underlying failings in the high performance programme.\u2019 The 212-page review on Ireland's Olympic and Paralympic campaigns also said blaming the departure of head coach Billy Walsh, questionable judging decisions and a positive drugs test only masked \u2018the real root causes.\u2019 The Irish Athletic Boxing Association's (AIBA) high performance funding for 2017 was cut by \u20ac200,000.http://www.the42.ie/boxing-rio-olympics- review-3325331-Apr2017/ Disagreements among senior members of the IABA has led to warnings from Sports Ireland that further steps will be taken against the IABA.https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/comment-iaba-civil-war- undermines-dunne-s-role-1.3101933 Successful Irish boxer Bernard Dunne (13 Irish amateur championships and the WBA Super Bantamweight world title in 2009) was appointed director of the high-performance unit in April 2017. The IABA also announced that their High Performance Unit would move to the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus on a permanent basis following the completion of an agreement with the Sport Ireland Institute.http://www.sportireland.ie/Media/Latest_News/2017/ In the following month the feud both within the IABA and with Sports Ireland flared up again, with two people claiming to be the chairman of the IABA: Dublin barrister Joe Christle and Waterford's David O\u2019Brien.https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other- sports/comment-iaba-civil-war-undermines-dunne-s-role-1.3101933 O'Brien claimed that a meeting of the board of directors was held on 27 March, which Joe Christle did not attend. The IABA president Pat Ryan did attend. O'Brien claimed that he was voted in as the chairman of the board of directors, as Christle's time on the board had finished, and he (O'Brien) called for both Christle and the CEO of the IABA, Fergal Carruth, to step down. Christle, in turn, claimed that the vote taken at that meeting was invalid, as there were insufficient members present to form a forum. Joe Christle is recognised by Sport Ireland, while five members of the board of directors approved David O\u2019Brien as an alternative chairman, leading to deep divisions within the body.http://sportsnewsireland.com/other_sports/boxing-iaba-execs-summoned-to- government-buildings-for-crisis-talks/ On 7 June both the minister for sport, Patrick O'Donovan, and John Treacy, Sport Ireland chief executive, said they recognised Christle as chairman. They set a 30 June deadline for the IABA to get its act together and introduce a new rule book, which would ensure the autonomy of the High Performance Unit and ensure Dunne's sole right to make team selections in keeping with recommendations made in the post-Olympic \u2018Rio Review\u2019. In response, the following day IABA president Ryan penned a strongly- worded letter to Christle, criticising many of Christle's recent decisions as well as outlining concerns in relation to the organisation's current leadership, among other issues.Michael Verney in the Irish Independent One day later the IABA board of directors (who support Christle's position as chairman) published a statement replying to Pat Ryan's letter, which had been leaked. The statement was posted on the IABA website. The board members emphasised that they had received legal advice to support Christle's position as chairman. The board's statement also reiterated their intention to introduce a new IABA Rule Book as demanded by Sport Ireland.https://www.rte.ie/sport/boxing/2017/0609/881594-iaba/ ==IABA Olympic medals== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
