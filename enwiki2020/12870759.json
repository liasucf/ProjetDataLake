    "text": "The Gotland National Conscription () was a Swedish Army infantry unit that traced its origins back to the 19th century. It was split into two new regiments in 1887. The regiment's soldiers were recruited on the island of Gotland. ==History== Gotland National Conscription was raised in 1811 through an agreement, a convention between the people of Gotland and the king. It became Sweden's first military conscript defence with exercise duty even in peacetime. It mobilized nearly 20% of the population and raised four battalions in addition to artillery. The officers were appointed by the king; other commanders were chosen by the congregation. In 1887, the Gotland National Conscriptio was reformed into two separate units, the Gotland Infantry Regiment and the Gotland Artillery Corps. ==Organisation 1861== thumb|Battalion commanders of the Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4ring (the Gotland National Conscription), 1880s.
