    "text": "The Japan\u2013South Korea trade dispute is an ongoing economic conflict which has asymmetric nature between Japan and South Korea, the world's third and eleventh largest national economies. It is also known as Japan\u2013South Korea economic war on the Korean side. The cause of the conflict on export control about hi-tech materials was officially cited by the Japanese government as the South Korean government not complying with export control and regulations to prevent resale of strategic goods, and ignoring the Japanese government's request to hold export control dialogue for three years. However, on the South Korean side, it was regarded as retaliation to the Supreme Court of South Korea's decisions regarding compensation, and further retaliation was agitated by Moon Jae-in. The trade dispute has caused a significant deterioration in Japan\u2013South Korea relations to the lowest point since the two countries normalized their diplomatic relations in 1965. == Background == Japan and South Korea are some of the world's largest economies, ranking 3rd and 11th, respectively, in terms of GDP. South Korea, the largest memory chip producer in the world, and Japan, the largest supplier of crucial materials in chip production, have so far served as the cradle for technological products such as smartphones and personal computers. South Korea is home to Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, companies that together produce two-thirds of the world's memory chips. In Japan, 3 companies (JSR Corporation, Showa Denko, and Shin-Etsu Chemical) as well as Kanto Denka Kogyo, produce 90% of the world's Fluorinated polyimide and Photoresist, both of which are used for LCD and OLED displays, and 70% of Hydrogen Fluoride, used to make LSI, DRAM and NAND flash memory. South Korea imports 94% of Fluorinated polyimide, 92% of Photoresists, and 44% of Hydrogen Fluoride from Japan, according to data from Korea International Trade Association. On the other hand, Japan had export dependency on South Korea for these three materials at 22.5%, 11.6%, and 85.9%, respectively. The two countries established diplomatic relations in December 1965, following the signing of the normalization treaty in June of the same year when Japan recognized South Korea as the only legitimate government of the whole Korean Peninsula. As the relations continued to develop over the next few decades, both countries became two of the strongest allies of the United States in Asia, to counter the influence of China, Russia, and North Korea. However, their relations have been negatively impacted by many ongoing disputes, such as the Liancourt Rocks dispute (known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese) and differing interpretations on Imperial Japan's treatment of the people in then-colonial Korea. === MITI's support for South Korea to become a member of global export control regime === South Korea began to establish its export control system in the 1980s, conflicting domestic and international pressures meant that it was not fully implemented. In the early 1990s, South Korea was still not a member of global export control regime. Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) made approaches to other member countries and frequently visited South Korea to support their undertaking to implement export control system. As the result, South Korea could become a member of the multilateral export control regime in 1996, except for missiles, and they had been expressing appreciation to Japan for MITI's efforts so far. It was in 2001 that South Korea could become a member about missiles after additional supporting efforts by Japanese MITI. Such relationship made METI, after Japanese 2001 Central Government Reform, to allow special treatment as a \u201cwhite country\u201d to give special preferential measures in 2004. In World Trade Organization (WTO), there is an agreement about \"security exceptions\" as Article 21. It has been considered obvious that export control for security is the exception. === Court decisions regarding compensation === The two countries' bilateral relations then declined in late 2018, after Supreme Court of South Korea and other high courts made a decision that ordered several Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nachi-Fujikoshi and Nippon Steel, to make compensations to the families of South Koreans who were unfairly treated and illegally forced to supply labour for World War II war efforts, such as building ships and aircraft for Japan without pay at a Mitsubishi shipyard and machine tool factory in Nagoya in 1944. These decisions infuriated the Japanese government, claiming that the issue was settled under the 1965 treaty of Normalization of Diplomatic relations between the two countries. It means that the legal foundation of the friendly and cooperative relationship developed between two countries since 1965 had overthrown. The legal foundation is \"Agreement on the Settlement of Problems concerning Property and Claims and on Economic Co-operation between Japan and the Republic of Korea\". Under this severe situation surrounding the relationship caused by the South Korea side, the government of Japan will be taking necessary measures against South Korea. On October 30th, the Supreme Court rejected appeals to overturn a 2013 order requiring Nippon Steel to pay compensation to four South Korean workers who underwent forced labour which occurred during the war and ordered to pay each of the workers an individual sum of 100 million won (US$87,700). A month later, on 30 November 2018, Gwangju High Court rejected an appeal by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries regarding 2013 appeals of court decision that the company must pay 80 million won ($71,000) to compensate each of the 23 plaintiffs and ordered to compensate the remaining 5 South Korean elderly people who forced to work in a Japanese company where the company in a separated rulling by Supreme Court on November 28 ordered to pay 150 million won ($134,000) to each of 28 plaintiffs, elderly people which is still alive or their families. On 18 January 2019, Seoul High Court dismissed Nachi- Fujikoshi appeal of October 2014 Seoul Central District Court decision against an order that it must pay each 17 South Korean women 80 million to 100 million won (US$69,000 to US$89,000) because the victims were \u201ctricked\u201d into forced labour in harsh conditions. On January 8th, 2019, Daegu District Court approved a request by paintiff to seizure of 81,075 shares held by Nippon Steel in POSCO-Nippon Steel RHF Joint Venture (PNR), a South Korea-based joint venture with POSCO, which is part of 2.34 million shares worth about 11 billion won ($9.78 million) owned by the Japanese steelmaker. These decision was followed in March 2019 by same decision for seizure of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries trademark and patent assets by Daejeon District Court. On June 19th, South Korea proposed to join funds with Japan to give compensation to forced labour victims but Japan rejected the offer. Instead, Japan called for the establishment of an arbitration panel in accordance with the rules of the 1965 Japan-Korea Normalization Agreement. The panel would consist of one member each from third-party countries. == Chronology == From left to right: Kang Kyung-wha, Mike Pompeo, and Tar\u014d K\u014dno in Bangkok, at a trilateral meeting in August 2019 July 2019 On July 1st, Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) applied updated licensing policies and procedures on the export and transfer of controlled items and their relevant technologies to South Korea. These decisions, effective on July 4th, put updated licensing policies on the industry, including a licensing process, forcing exporters to seek approval for each shipment up to 90 days. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura has said that the curbs were due to security concerns. The South Korean government has replied that the Japanese government is showing \"economic retaliation\" towards a matter that was decided by Supreme Court of South Korea, whose decisions cannot be altered by the Government of South Korea. In the press release regarding the export control and regulation, Japanese METI begins the process for removing South Korea from \u201cWhite Countries\u201d, and required exporters in Japan to have individual export licenses for certain items, fluorinated polyimide, resist, and hydrogen fluoride, and their relevant technologies. As METI did not give specific examples, some Japanese media doubted that South Korea may have passed on restricted chemicals to the United Arab Emirates, Iran, or North Korea. For example, a Japanese broadcaster Fuji TV and a Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun on July 10th reported that over the past four years (from 2015 to March 2019), South Korea found 156 strategic goods with potential weapon being secretly exported. The list included ingredients for the nerve agent VX, used in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and hydrofluoric acid that had been smuggled to the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere. The South Korean government denied Japanese media's allegations. South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Sung Yun-mo stated that an emergency inspection on companies importing chemicals from Japan came up with no evidence those chemicals were being exported to North Korea, and that Japan's claims were groundless and should be stopped. A Bareunmirae Party lawmaker Ha Tae-kyung made a further claims that Japanese authorities uncovered suspected smuggling of strategic items by Japanese companies to North Korea, citing data from the Center for Information on Security Trade Controls (CISTEC), a non-governmental organization that tracks data on export controls. Others view Japan's trade restrictions as partially being an excuse to retaliate against suspected intellectual property infringement by South Korean companies. Then South Korea, on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced a plan to withdraw Japan's export restrictions during the meeting of the WTO Council on Trade in Goods in Geneva on July 8\u20139th. Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong travelled to Japan on July 7th to seek support from Japanese suppliers. He returned from Japan on the 12th and reportedly secured resources needed for its production for long term. On July 12th, representatives from Japan and South Korea held a meeting in Tokyo to discuss the worsening diplomatic relations between the two countries, but failed to resolve the issue. A week later, as the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of South Korea held a press conference on the administrative briefing held on July 12th and following exchanges of e-mails, and the press conference included some misinformation, METI disclosed the facts as press release. On July 24th, the two countries took the issue over high-tech exports to WTO in Geneva, where they sent senior officials. Japan sent the director-general of economic affairs of Foreign Ministry, Shingo Yamagami. South Korea also sent deputy trade minister Kim Seung-ho. On the day, the minister of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of South Korea (ROK) made claims about their catch-all control, the policy dialogue between Japan and South Korea, the South Korea's export control system, and possible global impact on free trade caused by Japan's update. Responding to this, METI clarified Japan's position on the South Korea's catch-all system which South Korea claims as appropriate for both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and explained the background to the current lack of bilateral policy dialogue. August 2019 On August 2nd, Japanese cabinet approved the removal of South Korea from the \"white-list\". The countries that have the most-favoured status as trade partners, consisted of 27 countries. The loss of \u201cmost-favoured trade status\u201d will apply to dozens more products on a list of items that potentially could be converted to weapons. The decision came after public comments from 40,000 people, which to more than 90% are in favour. The Trade Minister Hiroshige Sek\u014d said that the trade measure was not intended to hurt bilateral ties of both countries. Then, the government officially promulgates the revision bill that excluded the country from the list of preferential trade status and published in KANPO, Japan's official gazette on August 7th. However, the bill did not stipulate any additional items that Japan will apply restrictions on, aside from the three chip and display materials. Japanese government decision to downgrade and remove South Korea from white-list takes effect on August 28th, 2019, 21 days after promulgation. With the new revision, South Korea falls to Group B under revised Japanese export control system. That means the Japanese manufacturers must apply for approval for each technology-related contract for 1,120 strategic materials that will exported to South Korea, rather than the simpler checks granted a preferential trade partners. South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha and her then Japanese counterpart Tar\u014d K\u014dno clashed at the ASEAN Plus Three meeting in Bangkok, with Kang condemning the Japanese export control was \"unilateral and arbitrary\". But K\u014dno insist that the export control is fully compatible with WTO rules. On August 8th, the Japanese government, at a news conference held by Seko, approved shipments of a key material used in making chip and displays to South Korea in order to ease tensions between the two countries. The approval was granted on August 7th, and according to South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon, there was a material known as EUV photoresists, which is crucial for Samsung's advanced contact chipmaking production. But Japan warned that if these three high-tech materials are found to be improperly used, the country will expand their strict checks of exports, including expanding application examination. The same material were also approved by Japan on August 20th. On August 12th, South Korean government is taking measures to remove Japan from the country's own so-called \"White-list\", consisted of 29 preferred trade partners as retaliation of Japan's move, which was delayed on August 8th. The decision takes effect on September 18th after the government complete its public opinion gathering process through government websites and emails from August 14th to September 3rd which 91% of the opinions were in favour of revision. Upon the revision takes effect, Japan's status has changed. Japan falls into the newly established group A-2 under Korea's export control system. As a member of group A-2, Japan will be treated the same as countries in group B with some exceptions. On August 28th in Japan, partial amendment to the export trade control order was enforced. There was an announcement by the government of South Korea on the day. In response to the announcement, METI provided their notes as press release to deny South Korean views. On August 29th, Japan approved the first export materials since South Korea's removal from the most- favoured trade status. There is a shipment of a Hydrogen fluoride, whose the materials exported for the first time since Japan tightened its exports. The main recipient of the material is Samsung Electronics. But Japan refused to confirm the export. September 2019 On September 3rd, METI submitted opinions and questions regarding the plans of South Korea to revise the public notice of the exportation and importation of strategic items. South Korean Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry announce to file a complaint with the WTO over Japanese tighter export controls and restrictions of three materials. The trade minister Yoo Myung-hee, told media on September 11th that she described the restrictions as a \u201cdiscriminatory act directly targeting South Korea, and it was politically motivated\u201d. Japanese Trade Minister Isshu Sugawara agree to hold talks with South Korea under WTO dispute settlement in a press conference on September 20th. On September 26th, newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi meet with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in New York City. The two countries fail to make a progress to resolve the bilateral issue, says that are \"big disagreements\" between the two countries, but agree to continue the dialogue. October 2019 South Korean Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry issued a statement on October 1st that the Japanese government has not approved shipment of Hydrogen fluoride to the country even though 90 days have passed since a Japanese exporter submitted an application to export the materials. On October 11th, Japan held consultations under the WTO Agreement in Geneva with the government of South Korea regarding Japan's update of licensing policies and procedures on exports to South Korea. This is part of the WTO Dispute Settlement procedure under which South Korea requested bilateral talks. If it does not resolve the issue on 60 days, South Korea will request the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to establish a panel to rule on the issue. November 2019 On November 19th, the second round of bilateral consultation under the WTO Agreement was held. Japan pointed out that the allegation of WTO-inconsistency is completely baseless. And, Japan explained once again that export licenses are granted once items in concern are confirmed to be for civil use and no risk of diversion for military use exists, that Japan's measure is not an export ban, and no impact to supply chains has been found. These talks fail to resolve the trade dispute between two countries. On November 22nd, South Korea decided to suspend WTO petition against Japan's export control. December 2019 On December 4th, Japanese METI held a Director-General level preparatory meeting for the 7th Japan-Korea Export Control Policy Dialogue with the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE). During the preparatory meeting, both sides discussed details of the forthcoming policy dialogue including dates and agendas. On December 16th, Japanese METI held the 7th Japan-Korea Export Control Policy Dialogue with Korean MOTIE. During the Dialogue, experts from the two sides exchanged views on circumstances and challenges regarding critical technology control and their export control systems. Both sides agreed to continue the Dialogue and communications in order to contribute to resolving issues of concern. January 2020 Moon Jae-in said in new year's address, \"In the face of Japan's export restrictions, business, labor, the Government and the people all joined forces to localize production of key materials, components and equipment. The whole nation came together to realize the goal of building a country that cannot be shaken. This task had been left undone for several decades; however, we made significant achievements in just half a year.\" February 2020 On February 21st, Japanese METI held a Director-General level preparatory meeting with Korean MOTIE. As a result of the meeting, both sides agreed to hold the 8th Japan-Korea Export Control Policy Dialogue on March 10th. March 2020 On March 6th, Japanese METI and Korean MOTIE have agreed to hold the 8th Japan-Korea Export Control Policy Dialogue on March 10th via video conference system. On March 10th, Japanese METI and Korean MOTIE held the 8th Japan-Korea Export Control Dialogue. At the Dialogue, both sides updated and exchanged views on improvements in system and implementation of trade and sensitive technology transfers controls, in order to contribute to exploring resolution of issues of concern. June 2020 On June 19th, responding to the resumption of WTO dispute settlement process which was announced by South Korea, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kajiyama mentioned that such a unilateral action is deeply regrettable as it would undermine agreements at the previous Japan-Korea Export Control Policy Dialogues where both sides agreed to explore resolution of issues of concern through dialogues and communications. On June 30th, after blocking South Korea's initial request for the establishment of WTO panel, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Kajiyama mentioned that he wants to urge South Korea to come back to the table and suspend the WTO process so that we can relaunch the Export Control Policy Dialogues. == Reactions == === South Korea === ==== Government ==== The South Korean government's stance on the dispute is that Japan's export control is groundless and unfair. It argues that it has a sufficient catch-all control system and the lack of communication was on Japan's end. They further stated that Japan's export control is in violation of international law and will be both disruptive and harmful to both countries economies and the global market. The South Korean government urged Japan to withdraw its export control as they claim would damage their relationship further. ===== Before whitelist removal ===== The South Korean government, led by the First Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-Young, summoned the Japanese ambassador to lodged the protest against the export curbs by Japan on 1 July. The Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Sung Yun-Mo called Japan's move \"deeply regrettable\". Then, on 10 July, President Moon Jae-in in a meeting with executives from the country's 30 conglomerates, urged Japan to \u201creturn to the principle of free trade that Japan has been pushing for\u201d and said he would \u201ctake responsive measures\u201d if South Korean companies were harmed by the new restrictions aimed by Japanese government. ===== After whitelist removal ===== In response to Japan's removal of the country from the list, the government held emergency cabinet meeting on the same day as Japan's announcement (August 2nd) and broadcast live on television across the country. Moon warned Japan against the decisions. He warned that the country will \u201cresolutely take corresponding measures\u201d. He also said that \"we will never again lose to Japan.\" The government announced to tighten its import quota on fishery and agricultural products from Fukushima, which was introduced due to concerns of radioactive contamination. On August 15th, 74th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese rule, President Moon delivered a speech, urged Japan to return to dialogue to ease the tensions. Moon also saying South Korea has \"not dwelt on the past\" and expressed hope that Japan will play a leading role together in facilitating peace and prosperity in East Asia. In order to reduce its reliance on Japanese Industries, the government announced a comprehensive research and development strategy. This includes a plan to spend 7.8 trillion won ($6.48 billion) in research and development for local materials, parts, and equipment over the next seven years. The government also pledged to spend 5 trillion won ($4.12 billion) to increase its own capabilities in the development of key industrial materials. The massive R&D; investment will take place starting in 2020 until 2022. South Korea propose a record budget about 513.5 trillion won ($423.7 billion) for 2020 to boost its slowing economy, represents a 9.3 percent hike from 2019 budget. A key centrepiece of the spending proposals is 24.1 trillion won ($19.9 billion) set aside for research and development (R&D;) in 2020, which is up 17.3 percent from 2019, the highest in a decade. ==== Regional governments ==== In response to Japanese trade restrictions to South Korea, regional governments across the country launched a boycott of Japanese products and exchange programmes. The action includes the suspension of various activities such as public procurement and leasing of Japanese products, official business trips to Japan and \u201csisterhood\u201d relationships with Japanese cities. Two regional legislative bodies, Seoul Metropolitan Council and Busan Metropolitan Council on 6 September, passed non-binding ordinance labelling 284 Japanese companies including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as \"war criminal companies\" to denounce the alleged use of forced labour by these companies. Under the ordinances, these Japanese companies are to be given the designation, with the mayors and other officials of the cities being requested not to purchase products from the companies in the future. In the case of Busan, there is also a provision that stickers saying \"product of a war crime company\" be attached to products that have already been purchased. ==== Political parties ==== The Liberty Korea Party, while calling on Japan to remove the export restriction, have also criticized President Moon's handling of the issue. Rep. Na Kyung-won claimed that Moon's administration have exacerbated the issue and have also damaged relationship with the US to the point where US will not intervene. The LKP called for the government to focus on finding a diplomatic solution with Japan rather than a take hard-line stance. All political parties in South Korea have voiced the need to restrict Japanese imports. So far, they have announced plans to create a \"Pan-national\" emergency body in response to the situation. South Korea's major political parties have agreed to establish a bipartisan body on 31 July 2019. ==== Others ==== Anti-Japanese banner in Mokpo South Koreans are very unhappy with the Japanese government's decision to removing the country from the whitelist. They fear that the restriction will hurt the South Korean economy and blame the Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe. Many South Koreans also feel that these restrictions are unjust and unfair, because of what Japan did during colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 until the end of World War II in 1945. In response to Japan's move, on 5 July, a group of a South Koreans took to the street to announce a boycott of Japanese products. Since then, many South Koreans decided to boycott all Japanese products and imports, including food and beverages, cosmetics, vehicles, and clothes. Some also cancelled scheduled trips to Japan. On Blue House presidential petition website in July 2019, nearly 27,000 people signed a petition calling for a boycott of Japanese products and an end to tourism to Japan. According to the petition website, if 200,000 people sign the petition within a month, the government is obligated to respond to the matter officially. A website called NoNoJapan.com, created by Kim Byung-kyu was launched on 11 July to provide information about Japanese products and services that Koreans boycotted and alternative Korean products to these Japanese one. As more Koreans join the boycott, the website experienced a server crash due to a spike in traffic. About 5,000 people, including members of 596 civil groups, held a candlelight vigil on 27 July, in Gwanghwamun Plaza and in front of the Japanese embassy to criticize Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for imposing trade restrictions. They also held another candlelight vigil in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, on 3 August, with more than 15,000 people according to organizer, participating in the rally. A similar protest was held on 10 August, now with a declaration was signed by 1,000 students. The protesters also demand South Korea's removal from GSOMIA, which is a military information-sharing pact with Japan. The number of participants was similar to second rally. They also held large scale candlelight vigil rally at Gwanghwamun Plaza, Chosun Ilbo headquarters, and the Japanese Embassy on 15 August, which is the 74th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule. They estimate that 30,000 to 100,000 people participate in the rally. In contrast, conservative groups also held simultaneous rally, called for pushback of anti-Japanese sentiment. There are two people that set himself in fire to protest Japanese government decision, which held in front of the Japanese Embassy In Seoul. The first incidents was occurred on 19 July, at 3:24 am local time, which a men died after the incident, and second incident occurred on 1 August by a 72-year-old man, which is in critical condition. The boycott of Japanese products spread into the cultural sector, with release of latest Doraemon film series Doraemon: Nobita's Chronicle of the Moon Exploration, which is originally scheduled on 14 August, had been postponed indefinitely even after the film's Korean dubbing was finished. In July, another Japanese animation films, Butt Detective the Movie and Detective Conan: The Fist of Blue Sapphire, was subjected to unfavourable online reviews on internet and sold only 134,000 and 200,000 tickets respectively. A poll conducted by Realmeter involving 504 adults reveal that, as of 24 July, 62.8% of respondents say they are boycotting Japanese goods. Another poll conducted by Gallup Korea involving 1,005 adults found that only 12% held favourable views on Japan, while 77% have negative views. Likewise the poll found that 61% of respondents blame the Japanese government for the conflict, while 17% hold the South Korean government responsible. There were calls by many South Korean lawmakers to restraint or stopping their Investment in Japanese companies involved in their war crime against the many Korean slave labour. Korea Investing Corporation and National Pension Service faced pressure to do so. The pension fund then started to reviewing 1.23 trillion won ($1.1 billion) worth of investment of Japanese companies whether the companies, as many as 75 companies should be dropped if proved to companies that linked to Japanese war efforts in World War II. Some South Korean media have expressed concerns about the trade dispute; such as the large dependency on Japanese materials, the dispute prolonging, doubts about US intervention, and the government having few options to tackle the dispute. The Korea Times editorial have criticized the Blue House's response to the issue. === Japan === ==== Government ==== The Japanese government's stance is based on global export control regime to prevent resale of strategic goods, and it is a case of updating implementation due to significantly undermined trust with South Korea. They argue that, while South Korea's catch-all control covers WMD- related goods, it has never clarified whether it covers conventional weapons as well. The Japanese government also claimed that South Korea has repeatedly postponed policy dialogues between the two nations. Japan also maintains that South Korea will simply be treated as a normal trade partner in same other Asian countries and will not get incentive measures as a \"white country\", the change does not break international law and that it is not an embargo. In response to South Korea's move to remove Japan from the list of most favoured trade partners, the Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Twitter on August 13th that South Korea failed to show how Japan had purportedly fallen short of international export control measures. He also said Japan does not understand why it has been removed from neighbouring country's list of trusted trade partners. ==== Others ==== Soon after the METI's press release, a professor who had been in charge of export control at MITI started to provide corrections and commentaries on this issue in media, as there had been many misunderstandings in media provided by non-expert editors and commentators. The Japanese government's decision to update implementation of export export control prompted criticism from many people, a group of 75 people including writer Satoshi Kamata, economic analyst Katsuto Uchihashi and Akira Kawasaki, signed an online petition that called both countries to hold a dialogue to resolve the conflict. According to a survey conducted by Asahi Shimbun on July 15, 56 percent of respondents support the government's export control while 21 percent did not. Among those who support Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, 74 percent of respondents support it. Among those who disapprove of Shinz\u014d Abe, 43% say they support the export control while 36% say they're against it. Despite the majority of Japanese supporting the government's actions, on August 4 there was a group of 200 Japanese and Korean demonstrators who protested Abe's government in the streets of Shinjuku. They called Abe to stop the export curbs to South Korea. The amount of protesters increased on August 8. There were calls by the protestors for Abe to resign as the Prime Minister. The organizer of the protests enlisted new participants through many social media platforms. In the midst of the trade dispute between the two countries, Japanese author Hirokazu Kore-eda urged Japanese and Korean artists to show support for one another to overcome their countries' political situation. === Other countries and viewpoints === Many countries showed concern to the actions of the two countries hurting the global tech industry. Tech companies in the United States issued a letter to both countries urging the two nations to negotiate a resolution to the dispute. Five of America's largest tech industry groups including the Semiconductor Industry Association, which Qualcomm and Intel Corporation as a members, among its other companies, issued a joint letter to Japanese Economy Minister Hiroshige Sek\u014d and South Korean Minister of Trade Yoo Myung-hee. They asked both sides to refrain from escalating their conflict. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Japan and South Korea to show goodwill and resolve their trade spat through negotiations and dialogue. U.S. President Donald Trump voiced concern about the worsening ties between Japan and South Korea. He said on 9 August that trade and history dispute put the country (United States) in a \"very difficult position\". He urged the two countries to \"get along\". Some observers have pointed out that the dispute may have been exacerbated by both of the countries' leaders to drum up political support. During the beginning of the trade dispute Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party were gearing up for Upper House election on 21 July. At the same time, President Moon Jae-in faced criticism for his economic policy and lack of progress in relationship with North Korea. Observers noted that both leaders are unlikely to back down from the dispute due to political pressure. Many analysts and experts have viewpoints about the trade dispute as well. Political analyst Paul Triolo, who also practice head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group, told CNBC that since Japan and South Korea are U.S. allies, the United States will likely to involved in mediating the two countries in addition to China because from U.S. perspective, this is a \"lose-lose confrontation\", which could also inadvertently benefit China. On the other hand, Waqas Adenwala, Asia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit said it may be \u201cawkward\u201d for China to mediate in this dispute, as both South Korea and China were victims of Japan's invasion and brutal killings during World War II. Other analyst and experts, such as Kim Hyun-Chul, an expert on Japanese enterprise at Seoul National University, told ABC News unlike trade of finished goods, high-tech industry goods that are sourced globally are interdependent. Countries that rely on South Korea's semiconductors such as the United States, China and even Japan will all be adversely affected, causing a domino effect on the global supply chain in computer and smartphone industries. Meanwhile, Rajiv Biswas, Asia- Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit, said U.S. electronics companies, many of which have large production hubs in both the U.S. and China, are vulnerable to supply shortages of South Korean memory chips, given the importance of South Korea as a supplier of chips not only hardware such as mobile phones and electronic products but also data processing programs. === Business leaders === On the annual conference of the Korea-Japan Economic Association in Seoul, 300 business leaders from the two countries have urged both governments to find a diplomatic solution for the trade disputes. === International organization === The WTO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, where South Korea filed a complaint On July 14, 2019, at the request of South Korea, the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreed to formally discuss at its General Council meeting about Japan's semiconductors export curbs to South Korea.
