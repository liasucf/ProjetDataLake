    "text": "Algorta is a station of line 1 of Metro Bilbao. It is located in the neighbourhood of Algorta, in the municipality of Getxo. On its current form, the station opened on 11 November, 1995 replacing an older station. == History == The original station opened in 1893 as part of the Getxo-Plentzia extension of the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway. The station was at-grade open air station with one side platform and one island platform. The station building, now disappeared, followed the same architectural design as others of the same line, with the only remaining example being that of Neguri station. Next to the station there was a small train depot. Starting in 1947, the narrow-gauge railway companies that operated within the Bilbao metropolitan area were merged to become Ferrocarriles y Transportes Suburbanos de Bilbao S.A. (Railways and Suburban Transports of Bilbao), shortened FTS and the first precedent of today's Metro Bilbao. In 1977, the FTS network was transferred to the public company FEVE and in 1982 to the recently created Basque Railways. In the decade of 1990s, it was decided the station, just like the most of the former railway line, would be integrated into Metro Bilbao's line 1. The rail line was then put underground and a new also underground station was built, opened in 1995. The former station building, platforms and train depot were demolished and replaced with a public plaza named Algorta Station Plaza. == Station layout == It is an underground station with a single island platform. The main hall is above the ground. === Access === * 20px 1 Telletxe St. (Telletxe exit) * 20px Bolue St. (Bolue exit, closed during night services) * 20px 20px 1 Telletxe St. (Telletxe exit) == Services == === Metro services === The station is served by Line 1 to Etxebarri, Ibarbengoa and Plentzia.
