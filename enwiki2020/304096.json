    "text": "Ozra (or Ozro) Amander Hadley (June 30, 1826 - July 18, 1915) was an American politician who during the Reconstruction era was the acting governor of the U.S. state of Arkansas, from March 5, 1871, to January 6, 1873. ==Early life and education== Hadley was born in Cherry Creek, New York, and was educated in the public schools. He attended Fredonia Academy, now State University of New York at Fredonia. Hadley moved to Rochester, Minnesota in 1855, where he was a farmer and became active in local politics and government, including appointment as Olmsted County Auditor. In 1865, he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he opened a general store. ==Political career== Hadley was elected as a Republican to serve in the Arkansas Senate from 1869 to 1871; he was elected president of the Senate in 1871. In 1871, as part of a political compromise (see: Brooks-Baxter War), Hadley was appointed acting governor after the resignation of his fellow Republican, Powell Clayton, a controversial figure associated with the Brooks-Baxter War. During his two- year term, Hadley sided with the Radical Republicans during the Reconstruction Era, including efforts to assist former slaves to obtain schooling, own land, vote, and hold office. After his gubernatorial term, Hadley served as registrar of the U.S. Land Office. He was appointed as Little Rock's postmaster in 1878, and served until 1882. ==Later life== In his later years, Hadley moved to Watrous, Mora County, New Mexico, where he developed a ranch. He died in Watrous in 1915. == See also == *National Governors Association *Brooks\u2013Baxter War *Arkansas Militia in Reconstruction ==References== ==External links== *National Governors Association Category:1826 births Category:1873 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Acting Governors of Arkansas Category:American merchants Category:Arkansas state senators Category:Arkansas postmasters Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:Minnesota Republicans Category:New Mexico Republicans Category:People of the Brooks\u2013Baxter War Category:People from Chautauqua County, New York Category:Politicians from Little Rock, Arkansas Category:People from Mora County, New Mexico Category:Ranchers from New Mexico Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:State University of New York at Fredonia alumni ",
