The relationship between Naseem, a 15-year-old schoolgirl belonging to a middle class Bombay based Muslim family and her ailing grandfather takes the story forward as the family watches with increasing horror on their TV the news of the growing tension between Muslims and Hindus. The grandfather keeps regaling her with stories of life marked by communal harmony in the pre-independence city of Agra. As communal tension erupts in the city of Bombay, Naseem notices changing dynamics at her school and in the neighborhood, while her grandfather watches helplessly at a city getting deeply divided on communal lines. The old man dies on 6 December coinciding with the news of the destruction of the mosque. == Cast == *Mayuri Kango as Naseem *Kaifi Azmi as Naseem's Grandfather *Seema Kelkar as Naseem's Grandmother *Kay Kay Menon as Religious Fundamentalist *Salim Shah as Mushtaq *Makrand Deshpande *Kulbhushan Kharbanda *Surekha Sikri == Accolades == The movie bagged the National Award for Best Direction and Screenplay for Saeed Akhtar Mirza. == References == == External links == * * * Category:Indian films Category:1995 films Category:1990s Hindi-language films Category:Films whose director won the Best Director National Film Award Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay National Film Award Category:Films directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza ",
