    "text": "Apache Lucene is a free and open-source search engine software library, originally written completely in Java by Doug Cutting. It is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is released under the Apache Software License. Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including Object Pascal, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby and PHP. ==History== Doug Cutting originally wrote Lucene in 1999.KeywordAnalyzer Lucene was his fifth search engine, having previously written two while at Xerox PARC, one at Apple, and a fourth at Excite. It was initially available for download from its home at the SourceForge web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta family of open-source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top- level Apache project in February 2005. The name Lucene is Doug Cutting's wife's middle name and her maternal grandmother's first name. Lucene formerly included a number of sub-projects, such as Lucene.NET, Mahout, Tika and Nutch. These three are now independent top-level projects. In March 2010, the Apache Solr search server joined as a Lucene sub-project, merging the developer communities. Version 4.0 was released on October 12, 2012. ==Features and common use== While suitable for any application that requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene is recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching. Lucene includes a feature to perform a fuzzy search based on edit distance. Lucene has also been used to implement recommendation systems.J. Beel, S. Langer, and B. Gipp, \u201cThe Architecture and Datasets of Docear\u2019s Research Paper Recommender System,\u201d in Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications (WOSP 2014) at the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2014), London, UK, 2014 For example, Lucene's 'MoreLikeThis' Class can generate recommendations for similar documents. In a comparison of the term vector-based similarity approach of 'MoreLikeThis' with citation-based document similarity measures, such as co-citation and co- citation proximity analysis, Lucene's approach excelled at recommending documents with very similar structural characteristics and more narrow relatedness.M. Schwarzer, M. Schubotz, N. Meuschke, C. Breitinger, V. Markl, and B. Gipp, https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite- data/pdf/schwarzer2016.pdf \"Evaluating Link-based Recommendations for Wikipedia\" in Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), New York, NY, USA, 2016, pp. 191-200. In contrast, citation- based document similarity measures tended to be more suitable for recommending more broadly related documents, meaning citation-based approaches may be more suitable for generating serendipitous recommendations, as long as documents to be recommended contain in-text citations. ==Lucene-based projects== Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain crawling and HTML parsing functionality. However, several projects extend Lucene's capability: * Apache Nutch \u2013 provides web crawling and HTML parsing * Apache Solr \u2013 an enterprise search server * Compass \u2013 the predecessor to Elasticsearch * CrateDB \u2013 open source, distributed SQL database built on Lucene * DocFetcher \u2013 a multiplatform desktop search application * Elasticsearch \u2013 an enterprise search server released in 2010 * Kinosearch \u2013 a search engine written in Perl and C and a loose port of Lucene. The Socialtext wiki software uses this search engine, and so does the MojoMojo wiki. It is also used by the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and the Toxin and Toxin- Target Database (T3DB). * Swiftype \u2013 an enterprise search startup based on Lucene ==See also== * Enterprise search * Information extraction * List of information retrieval libraries * Text mining ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Lucene Category:Free search engine software Category:Java (programming language) libraries Category:C Sharp libraries Category:Cross-platform software Category:Software using the Apache license Category:Search engine software Category:Pascal (programming language) software Category:1999 software ",
