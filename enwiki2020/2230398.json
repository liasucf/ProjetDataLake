It has a playground down the right field line. Hawks field is the first collegiate venue to use the SubAir system, which can heat and cool the field year round. For the Saltdogs, it's been selected as the \"Best Playing Field\" in each of its years of existence (Northern League award, 2001\u20132005; American Association award, 2006\u20132018). In November 2007, Hawks Field won the Baseball Field of the Year Award in the College/University division by the Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA) for the second time. The field earned its first honor in 2003 and is the only college park in the country to be a two-time winner. In 2012, college baseball writer Eric Sorenson ranked the field as the fourth best big game atmosphere in Division I baseball. The stadium replaced Buck Beltzer Stadium, the Cornhuskers' on-campus baseball field. === Nebraska home records === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\";\"|2002 ! style=\";\"|2003 ! style=\";\"|2004 ! style=\";\"|2005 ! style=\";\"|2006 ! style=\";\"|2007 ! style=\";\"|2008 ! style=\";\"|2009 ! style=\";\"|2010 ! style=\";\"|2011 ! style=\";\"|2012 ! style=\";\"|2013 ! style=\";\"|Total |- | 29-5 | 28-7 | 19-9 | 33-4 | 20-7 | 14-10 | 28-3-1 | 16-14 | 18-7 | 21-11 | 20-10 | 12-7 | 214-88-1 |} === Saltdogs records === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2001 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2002 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2003 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2004 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2005 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2006 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2007 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2008 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2009 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2010 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2011 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2012 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2013 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2014 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|2015 ! style=\"background:#001D38; color:#B6A010;\"|Total |- |31-14 |28-20 |23-22 |26-22 |28-20 |35-13 |31-17 |27-21 |27-21 |29-20 |27-22 |24-26 |28-22 |54-46 |34-66 |452-372 |} Hawks Field ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I baseball venues ==References== ==External links== *Hawks Field *Bowlin Stadium Category:2001 establishments in Nebraska Category:Sports venues completed in 2001 Category:College baseball venues in the United States Category:Minor league baseball venues Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball Category:Baseball venues in Nebraska Category:Tourist attractions in Lincoln, Nebraska ",
