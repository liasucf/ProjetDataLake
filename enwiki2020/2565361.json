    "text": "Mae Clarke (born Violet Mary Klotz; August 16, 1910 - April 29, 1992) was an American actress. She is widely remembered for playing Henry Frankenstein's bride Elizabeth, who is chased by Boris Karloff in Frankenstein, and for being on the receiving end of James Cagney's halved grapefruit in The Public Enemy. Both films were released in 1931. ==Early life== Mae Clarke was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father was a theater organist. She studied dancing as a child and began on stage in vaudeville and also worked in night clubs.Halliwell 1987, p. 130. ==Career== Mae Clarke started her professional career as a dancer in New York City, sharing a room with Barbara Stanwyck.Madsen 1994, pp. 16\u201317, 20. She subsequently starred in many films for Universal Studios, including the original screen version of The Front Page (1931) and the first sound version of Frankenstein (1931) with Boris Karloff. Clarke played the role of Henry Frankenstein's fianc\u00e9e, Elizabeth, who is attacked by the Monster (Karloff), on her wedding day. Clarke in Tod Browning's Fast Workers (1933) The Public Enemy, released that same year, contained one of cinema's most famous (and frequently parodied) scenes, in which James Cagney pushes a half grapefruit into Clarke's face, then goes out to pick up Jean Harlow.Clarke 1996, p. back cover. The film was so popular that it ran 24 hours a day at a theater in Times Square upon its initial release; Clarke's ex-husband had the grapefruit scene timed and would frequently buy a ticket, enter the theater to again enjoy that sequence, then immediately leave the theater.Cagney 1981, p. 211. Clarke appeared as Myra Deauville in the 1931 pre-Code version of Waterloo Bridge. In the film she portrays a young American woman who is forced by circumstance into a life of prostitution in World War I London; both the film and Clarke's performance were well received by the critics. Clarke also appeared in the modest pre-code Universal film Night World (1932), with Lew Ayres, Boris Karloff, Hedda Hopper, and George Raft. In 1933 she was the female lead in John Gilbert's last film as a contracted MGM star, Fast Workers. Clarke remained a leading lady up to and including 1937, but in increasingly low budget and lower status films. She slipped into supporting roles from 1940, although she had a few last leading roles in the late 1940s, notably as the heroine in the Republic serial King of the Rocket Men (1949). In 1933, Clarke and actor Phillips Holmes were in a single-car accident that left her with a broken jaw and facial scarring. In the 1950s and 1960s, Clarke played uncredited bit parts in several notable films, including Singin' in the Rain, The Great Caruso, and Thoroughly Modern Millie. Her last screen appearance was in the 1970 film Watermelon Man. Clarke with fellow actor John Beradino in the daytime drama General Hospital (1963) On television, Clarke appeared in many episodic series, including General Hospital, Perry Mason and Batman. Clarke retired in 1970 and taught drama. ==Personal life and death== Clarke was married and divorced three times: to Fanny Brice's brother Lew Brice,Goldman 1992, pp. 136-7, 144. Stevens Bancroft, and Herbert Langdon.Clarke 1996, p. 221. All of the unions were childless. In later years Clarke resided at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. Clarke died from cancer on April 29, 1992, at age 81. She is buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery. ==Selected filmography== ===Features=== *Big Time (1929) - Lily Clark *Nix on Dames (1929) - Jackie Lee *The Fall Guy (1930) - Bertha Quinlan *The Dancers (1930) - Maxine *Men on Call (1930) - Helen Gordon / Helen Harding *The Front Page (1931) - Molly Molloy *The Public Enemy (1931) - Kitty (uncredited) *The Good Bad Girl (1931) - Marcia Cameron *Waterloo Bridge (1931) - Myra *Reckless Living (1931) - Bee *Frankenstein (1931) - Elizabeth *Three Wise Girls (1932) - Gladys Kane *The Final Edition (1932) - Ann Woodman *Impatient Maiden (1932) - Ruth Robbins *Night World (1932) - Ruth Taylor *Flaming Gold (1932) - Claire Gordon *Breach of Promise (1932) - Hattie Pugmire *The Penguin Pool Murder (1932) - Gwen Parker *Parole Girl (1933) - Sylvia Day *Fast Workers (1933) - Mary *Turn Back the Clock (1933) - Mary Gimlet / Mary Wright *As the Devil Commands (1933) - Jane Chase *Penthouse (1933) - Mimi Montagne *Lady Killer (1933) - Myra Gale *Nana (1934) - Satin *This Side of Heaven (1934) - Jane Turner *Let's Talk It Over (1934) - Pat Rockland *The Man with Two Faces (1934) - Daphne Flowers *Silk Hat Kid (1935) - Laura Grant *The Daring Young Man (1935) - Martha Allen *Hitch Hike Lady (1935) - Judith Martin *The House of a Thousand Candles (1936) - Carol Vincent *Hearts in Bondage (1936) - Constance Jordan *Wild Brian Kent (1936) - Betty Prentice *Hats Off (1936) - Jo Allen *Great Guy (1936) - Janet Henry *Trouble in Morocco (1937) - Linda Lawrence *Outlaws of the Orient (1937) - Joan Manning *Women in War (1940) - Gail Halliday *Sailors on Leave (1941) - Gwen *Flying Tigers (1942) - Verna Bales *Lady from Chungking (1942) - Lavara *And Now Tomorrow (1944) - Receptionist (uncredited) *Here Come the Waves (1944) - Ens.
