There are 1,061 people (2017 Census) living on with the main village being Asau. ==Geography== The island, which covers approximately , includes swamps, mangroves, a fringing coral reef and a large lagoon. Vaitupu atoll consists of at least 9 isles, which are: * Luasamotu * Mosana (group of 2) * Motutanifa * Temotu * Te Motu Olepa * Tofia * Vaitupu proper * And at least 1 other islet :The biggest island is Vaitupu proper, followed by Tofia. The population of the villages of Vaitupu in the 2012 census were: * Apalolo - Saniuta with 263 people; * Tumaseu with 248 people; * Potufale with 230 people; * Asau with 198 people. Motufoua Secondary School was recorded in the 2012 census with 502 people. Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Vaitupu on 30 January and 1 February 1990 with around 85 percent of residential homes, trees and food crops were destroyed. In the 2011 Tuvalu drought Vaitupu experienced the loss of coconut palm trees, pulaka and taro due to the high temperatures and arid soil. In March 2015 Vaitupu suffered damage to houses, crops and infrastructure as the result of storm surges caused by Cyclone Pam. ==History== The exact date of Vaitupu's first settlement is unknown. According to oral history, the founder of the Vaitupuan community was a Samoan by the name of Telematua, who arrived in the 16th or 17th century. However, it is possible that Tongans may have first reached the atoll during the mid-13th century. Vaitupu has maintained contacts with Tonga throughout its history, both peaceful (alliances through marriage) and hostile (visits by Tongan slave-seekers). Vaitupu was also visited by I-Kiribati, and was thus far from isolated.Donald G. Kennedy, Field Notes on the Culture of Vaitupu, Ellice Islands, Journal of the Polynesian Society, vol.38, 1929, pp.2\u20135 Vaitupu means 'the fountain of water'. Despite what earlier sources on the discovery of Vaitupu state, namely that Obed Starbuck, captain of whaler Loper of Nantucket, had sighted this island in 1825, it wasn't until 26 April 1826, that he in fact would. William Plaskett, captain of the Nantucket whaler Independence II, called at Vaitupu on 21 August 1827. In view of Starbuck's earlier sighting of the island, the log entry by Plaskett for the day that he rediscovered it may appear somewhat remarkable: \u201c[...] At daylight found it to be a small low island about 6 miles long. [...] Having one native and an interpreter on board who we brought from Rotumah, who formerly belonged to one of the islands about here and who understood their language we learned that they had never seen a ship before. The natives name of this island is voytopu. It is not laid down on the books or charts so we call it a new discovery. Lat.7\u00b0-25 [south] Longitude 178\u00b0-78 East\". It was named 'Tracy Island' by Starbuck.Keith S. Chambers & Doug Munro, The Mystery of Gran Cocal: European Discovery and Mis-Discovery in Tuvalu, 89(2) (1980) The Journal of the Polynesian Society, 167\u2013198 The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Vaitupu in 1841.Tyler, David B. \u2013 1968 The Wilkes Expedition. The First United States Exploring Expedition (1838\u201342). Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society Samoan pastors from the London Missionary Society successfully introduced Christianity in the 1860s. The pastors implemented religious regulations, outlawing many cultural practices. They also introduced the Samoan language, as their Bibles were written in Samoan. Vaitupuans became literate in Samoan rather than in their own language.Donald G. Kennedy, Field Notes on the Culture of Vaitupu, Ellice Islands, Journal of the Polynesian Society, vol.38, 1929, pp.5\u20136 Vaitupuans celebrate Te Aso Fiafia (Happy Day) on 25 November of each year. Te Aso Fiafia commemorates 25 November 1887 which was the date on which the final instalment of a debt of $13,000 was repaid to H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, Samoa. Vaitupu history is that Thomas William Williams, the Ruge agent, pretended to do his customers a favour by allowing them to obtain goods on credit. In 1883 the debt of the Vaitupuans was $13,000 and H. M. Ruge and Company had threatened to seize the entire island unless the debt was repaid. Neemia, a Vaitupuan pastor living in Samoa, returned and organised working parties to collect coconuts and prepare copra to sell to pay off the debt, with Henry Nitz, the Webber & Co agent on Vaitupu, contributing money to meet the final payment. The Vaitupuans, with the help of their friends from Funafuti, repaid the debt by the due date. Seven thousand dollars was repaid by 1886 and the balance was paid on 25 November 1887. Vaitupuan tradition is that chance favoured their efforts, a ship sent to collect the last payment sank, as did the second ship the trading schooner Vaitupulemele. By the time a third ship arrived most of the money had been collected. However, the trading schooner Vaitupulemele appears to have a different role in the history of Vaitupu. The creation of the debt that was repaid to Ruge & Co extended beyond the purchase of goods on credit to include the purchase price of the Vaitupulemele by the Vaitupu Company. While T.M. Williams had been the Ruge agent, he later formed the Vaitupu Company with the Vaitupuan community and purchased the Vaitupulemele from Ruge & Co. However the schooner was lost during a voyage from Samoan and soon after Williams died, leaving no accounting for copra that had been shipped from Vaitupu. In any event the Vaitupuans paid the full amount claimed by Ruge & Co, although that company soon after went into liquidation. Vaitupu Post Office opened around 1916. Donald Gilbert Kennedy, the resident District Officer in the administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1932 to 1938, describe the construction of paopao and of the variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea. ==Population of Vaitupu== The population of Vaitupu from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be 400 people.W.F. Newton, The Early Population of the Ellice Islands, 76(2) (1967) The Journal of the Polynesian Society, 197\u2013204.Richard Bedford, Barrie Macdonald & Doug Monro, Population Estimates for Kiribati and Tuvalu (1980) 89(1) Journal of the Polynesian Society 199 Vaitupu is home to the second-largest population in Tuvalu, numbering 1,576 (2002 Census) and 1,555 (2012 census). Despite its relatively large size, Vaitupu became so overcrowded during the 1940s that a number of families migrated to Fiji to live on Kioa Island. Neli Lifuka was the magistrate on Vaitupu from 1945 to 1951. He was instrumental in collecting the funds to purchase Kioa Island in Fiji.Michael Goldsmith, Review of Klaus- Friedrich Koch, Logs in the Current of the Sea, Journal of the Polynesian Society, 87:4 (1978), 361\u201362 Initially 37 people migrated from Vaitupu to live on Kioa Island; within a decade, more than 235 people followed. ==Schools on Vaitupu== The primary school on Vaitupu is called Tolise. There used to be a primary school called Elisefou (New Ellice) on Vaitupu. The school moved to Vaitupu in 1923 and closed in 1953 when the government primary school was established. Its first headmaster, Donald Gilbert Kennedy, was a known disciplinarian who would not hesitate to discipline his students. The two most famous Tuvaluans from the school were Tuvalu's first Governor General, Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo and its first Prime Minister, Toaripi Lauti. Kennedy published Field Notes on the Culture of Vaitupu, Ellice Islands in the Journal of the Polynesian Society in instalments between 1929 and 1932 and as a book in 1931. Motufoua Secondary School was established in 1905. Over time the school has evolved and it is now is a boarding school for boys and girls that is administered by the Department of Education. In 2009 the student roll at Motufoua Secondary School was 550. Vaitupu received worldwide attention in 2000, when a fire in a dormitory at the Motufoua school killed 18 girls and a female adult supervisor. It was later discovered that the fire was caused by a student using a candle to read during the night. The Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana declared a national tragedy and quickly travelled to the island to witness the aftermath. A memorial service was held the following year in memory of the 18 girls and their matron who tragically lost their lives. Tuvaluan leaders as well as parents of the victims attended the memorial service. == Power generation with solar-hybrid systems== In 2010 what was then described as the largest diesel-solar photovoltaic (PV) hybrid electricity system in the South Pacific was installed at Motufoua Secondary School. Prior to the instalment of the system the school relied upon a diesel powered generator, which needed to be turned off during the night. The hybrid system systems saves thousands of dollars in diesel costs and provides the school with a 24-hour supply of energy, with up to 200 kWh per day. In 2014 New Zealand and the European Union agreed to provide finance to the Government of Tuvalu to install battery-backed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for the outer islands. From January to March 2015 Powersmart, a New Zealand company, implemented German solar power technology to build the new Vaitupu powerhouse. ==Community activities== The only village on Vaitupu consists of the neighbourhoods Tumaseu and Asau. There is a church, Tolise Primary School, at least one guesthouse and a post office. An aquaculture project has been established in the lagoon. The community activities on Vaitupu include the Nafa Moa and Talo (Taro crops and chickens competition). In this contest the community is divided into two rival teams. Members of each team compete for who can grow the heavier taro or larger chickens; the climax comes with the weigh-off between the competitors, concluding a day of good-natured rivalry and fun. ==Transportation and tourism== There is a wharf on Vaitupu but no harbour, meaning one must board a smaller boat from the inter-island passenger/cargo ships to get to the Vaitupu. There are paths and small unpaved roads throughout the island. Only a few cars drive on Vaitupu. In the main village there is a guest house called Vivalia III located at the wharf near the main church. ==General election, 2019== The 2019 general election was held on 9 September 2019. Isaia Taape was returned to the parliament and Nielu Isake was elected to represent Vaitupu in the parliament. ==Notable local persons== Reverend Sir Filoimea Telito, GCMG, MBE, (19 March 1945 \u2013 11 July 2011) as a young man became a teacher at Motufoua Secondary School. After completing theological studies, he returned to Motufoua to serve as Pastor. Later he became Principal of Motufoua, then in April 2005 he was appointed to be the Governor-General of Tuvalu. Sir Tomasi Puapua, GCMG, KBE, PC represented Vaitupu in the Parliament of Tuvalu. He was the second Prime Minister (1981\u20131989). Puapua later served as Governor-General of Tuvalu (1998\u20132003). Apisai Ielemia (19 August 1955 \u2013 19 November 2018) represented Vaitupu in the Parliament of Tuvalu. He served as Prime Minister of Tuvalu (2006\u20132010). Taukelina Finikaso represents Vaitupu in the parliament. He served as Minister of Communications and Works (2006\u20132010) and was appointed the Foreign Minister on 5 August 2013 following Enele Sopoaga becoming prime minister. ==Further reading== * Kennedy, Donald Gilbert, 'Field notes on the culture of Vaitupu, Ellice Islands' (1931): Thomas Avery & Sons, New Plymouth, N.Z. ==See also== * List of villages and neighbourhoods in Tuvalu * List of islands of Tuvalu ==References== Category:Atolls of Tuvalu ",
