The centre is built with mud on a piece of land bought by Hika Kamau. It offers parental love, spiritual care, rehabilitation and formal education to these children, with the aim of naturing their potential and personal capacity through other myriad of activities such as non-formal learning. The foundation began as a structural project in 2009 to house and rehabilitate street children, orphans and vulnerable children. This however, did not stop an additional 16 children to seek refuge and education (a total of 30 in 2011). As of 2014, the school offered basic education to 91 pupils (47 boys & 44 girls).
