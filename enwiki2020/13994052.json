It was completely rebuilt as a full-scale ch\u00e2teau in the 19th century by the then owner, M. Pierre Camus (1845-1905), who also commissioned the landscape gardener Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Treyve to create the surrounding park. The building has been used since 2006 as a Russian Orthodox monastery. ==Notes== *Summed up and translated from the equivalent article at French Wikip\u00e9dia, 31 October 2007 Category:Houses completed in the 19th century Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Allier Category:Russian Orthodox monasteries in France ",
