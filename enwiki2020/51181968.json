However, Gabriel White Tenma, the top angel in her class, becomes addicted to video games upon arriving on Earth and turns into a complete slacker as a result. The story follows Gabriel, along with other angels and demons who have descended to Earth, as they attend high school. == Characters == ; : :An angel who was the top of her class but turned into a slob after becoming addicted to video games. She is often lazy and unmotivated and ignores or lashes out against anyone trying to order or boss her around. ; : :The complete opposite of Gabriel, she is very responsible and often looks after Gabriel, contrary to her actual role as a demon. The only exception where Vignette acts manipulative or threatening is to do things she enjoys, like celebrating Christmas (despite being a demon) and forcing Gabriel into a cute cat costume. She usually goes along with Satania\u2019s schemes, which often end horribly. ; : :An egotistical, childish and bratty demon who often thinks of weird or immature ways to cause mischief, which usually end in failure. She is often pestered by Raphiel and stray dogs, the latter which constantly steals her beloved melon bread. She is frequently bullied and made fun by her \"friends\" and is easily tricked due to her incompetence. Her parents own a bakery. ; : :The second ranked angel in Gabriel's class, who (despite normally having a constant angelic smile) has since become a sadistic stalker who takes delight in teasing and manipulating Satania. Despite this, she considers Satania one of her friends. She is afraid of frogs. ; : :An underclassman angel who admired Gabriel in angel school and presumes Satanichia was the one responsible for turning her into a slob. She also knows of Vignette and calls her senpai (senior) for her kindness, but knowing she is a demon, distrusts her. ; : :The class president of Gabriel's class, who is unaware that Gabriel is an angel and often finds her, along with Satania, Vignette, and Raphiel's actions bewildering. She gets upset when people don\u2019t listen to her. ; : :The owner of a coffee shop where Gabriel works part time. He is often bewildered by Gabriel's behavior, but assumes it is just because she is a foreigner. == Media == === Manga === Ukami began serializing the manga series in ASCII Media Works's sh\u014dnen manga magazine Dengeki Daioh G on December 27, 2013, where it was published every other month.
