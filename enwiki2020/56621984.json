With Jack Gant, the initials of the four architects were used to create the CPMG name. In 2011 Jack Gant and Bill Crampin retired, and four directors undertook a management buyout of the practice. It opened a branch office in London in 2015. ==Works== *Adams Building, Nottingham 1996-99 restoration for New College Nottingham *Rugby Art Gallery and Museum 2000 *Octagon, Derby Road, Nottingham 2000-01 (conversion to apartments) *Elective Orthopaedic Theatres, Nottingham City Hospital 2001 *Coopers Square, Burton on Trent 2001 *Network Rail HQ, York 2002 *Hicks Building, University of Sheffield 2002 (remodelling block of 1955-64) *Boots Building, High Street, Nottingham 2002 (refitting for Zara) *Bristol Airport Air Traffic Control Centre 2004 *Moat House Primary School, Coventry 2004 *Rolls-Royce Compressions, Sinfin, Derby 2004 *Nottingham Squash Club 2004 *Radiology Unit, Leicester General Hospital 2005 *Student Health Centre, University of Sheffield 2005 *Pharmacy Quality Control Unit, Queen's Medical Centre 2006 *Moseley Primary School, Coventry 2006 *WEBS Training Academy, Beeston, Nottingham 2006 *Phoenix Building, Teesside University 2006 *Huntingdon Library and Archive 2006 *Carnegie Museum, Melton Mowbray 2006 *Carrington Point, Nottingham 2006 *Bilborough College 2006-07 *Binding House, Hucknall Road/Caxton Road, Nottingham 2007 *Verde apartments, Glasgow Green 2007 *Park Inn Hotel, West George Street/Renfield Street, Glasgow 2007 (formerly the offices of Pearl Assurance) *Aston Customer Service Centre, Rotherham 2007 *Cambridgeshire County Council Offices, Huntingdon 2007 *Athena Building, Teesside University 2007 *Isle of Man Airport Air Traffic Control Centre 2007 *RNAS Yeovilton Air Traffic Control Centre 2007 *Litmus Building, Huntingdon Street, Nottingham 2008 *Huntingdon Criminal Justice Centre 2008 *East Midlands Air Traffic Control Centre and Departure Lounge 2009 *Darlington Campus, Teesside University 2009 *Riverbank Building, Stafford College 2009 *Papworth Hospital, Cambridge 2009 *The Ear Foundation Projects, Nottingham 2009 *Laing O\u2019Rourke ExpLORe Building, Steetley 2009 *GlaxoSmithKline, Coleford 2009 *12 Smithfield Street, London 2009 *Hugh Aston Building, De Montfort University, Leicester 2009 *Rolls-Royce Nelson, Barnoldswick 2010 *Wolverton Depot, Milton Keynes 2010 *Bannerbrook Park, Coventry 2010 *Prolog 5, Sherwood Park 2011 *Dunelm HQ, Leicester 2011 *School of Humanities, University of Nottingham, 2011 *Opus Energy HQ, Northampton 2013 *Park View House Offices, Nottingham 2014 *Kemball School, Stoke-on-Trent 2015 *Air Traffic Control Centre, Manchester Airport 2015 *Visitor Centre, HMS Belfast, London 2015 *Cavendish Road, Nottingham 2015 *XP School, Doncaster 2015-16 *Student Union hub, Portland Building, University of Nottingham 2015-16. *Castle College, Chilwell *The Gym and Green Wall, Teesside University 2015-16 *Quest Academy, Croydon, London 2015-16 *Rykneld Primary School, Staffordshire 2015-16 *Heathfield Primary School, Kersall Drive, Nottingham 2015-16 *Forster Academy, Bradford 2015-16 *The Venue, De Montfort University 2015-16 *Intercontinental London O2 Hotel, 2016 *Little Ilford School PSBP Barking, Dagenham and Newham 2016 *Bombardier VShop, Derby 2016 *Waterside Campus, University of Northampton 2016-17 *Aerospace Integrated Research Centre, Cranfield University 2016-17 *Vijay Patel Building, De Montfort University, Leicester 2016 *Student Accommodation, Broadgate, Beeston, Nottingham 2016 *Central Fire Station, London Road, Nottingham 2016 *New Building, BioCity Nottingham 2016-17 *Library, Teesside University 2017 *Chandos Pole, University of Derby 2017 *KP house, Express Buildings, Nottingham 2017 *Slimming World HQ, Alfreton, Nottinghamshire 2017-18 *Theatre building, Ecclesbourne School, Derbyshire *Walnut Tree Park, Guildford *John Pye Luxury Assets, Old Bond Street, London *Centre Parcs, Elvedon Forest ==References== Category:Architects from Nottingham Category:Architecture firms of England ",
