    "text": "A mass shooting occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States on September 6, 2018. At 9:10 AM EDT, Omar Santa Perez, 29, opened fire with a Taurus PT-809E 9mm pistol equipped with standard and hollow-point ammunition, in the lobby of the Fifth Third Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, killing three people. ==Incident== Prior to the attack, Santa-Perez had entered a sandwich shop and potentially visited other businesses in the building, before returning to the bank and opening fire. Those killed in the attack were identified as two bank employees and a contractor. Two other victims were injured in the attack. Santa-Perez's gun reportedly jammed at least once during his shooting spree. When officers approached the lobby of the Fifth Third Center, they encountered an active shooter situation, with Santa-Perez firing into the lobby. Four of the responding officers engaged the shooter with their weapons, striking Santa- Perez multiple times. Body camera footage of the shooting released by the Cincinnati Police Department showed Santa-Perez indiscriminately shooting at any person he saw, and the gunman was later shot dead through a glass pane by police. The Hamilton County Coroner told reporters \"He [Santa-Perez] had one weapon but a whole lot of rounds of ammunition. And he didn't hesitate. He didn't hesitate to pull the trigger, empty his magazine, release and do it again and again and again.\" === Victims === One of the victims was reported deceased by first responders at the scene, while two others were declared deceased after arriving at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Two other victims were also transported, with one listed in critical condition and the other in fair. ==Investigation== Speaking at a press conference, Cincinnati mayor John Cranley stated that initial reports appeared to show that the victims were shot at random and that, \"it didn't appear to be a dispute between people.\" During initial investigation, it was discovered by police that the shooter was carrying hundreds of rounds of ammunition and \"...could've killed over 100 people.\" Body camera footage was released by law enforcement on September 8, which documented the officers movements after confronting the gunman. ==References== Category:2018 in Ohio Category:2018 mass shootings in the United States Category:2018 murders in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2018 Category:Crimes in Ohio Category:Deaths by firearm in Ohio Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in Ohio Category:September 2018 crimes Category:September 2018 events in the United States ",
