    "text": "Cassandra Miller (born Metchosin, British Columbia, Canada, 1976) is a Canadian experimental composer currently based in London, England. Her work is known for frequently utilising the process of transcription of a variety of pre-existing pieces of music. She has been widely commissioned by international orchestras, ensembles and soloists, and has won the Jules L\u00e9ger Prize for New Chamber Music twice, in 2016 and in 2011. Since 2018 she has been Professor of Composition at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, UK. == Education == Miller studied with Christopher Butterfield at the University of Victoria (2005) and at the Royal Conservatory of the Hague (2008) with Richard Ayres and Yannis Kyriakides before studying privately with Michael Finnissy in 2012. Miller returned to academic research in 2014, as a PhD candidate at the University of Huddersfield, supervised by Dr Bryn Harrison and supported by the Jonathan Harvey Scholarship. == Career == Miller's music has been commissioned and performed by orchestras including BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Oslo Philharmonic, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. Ensembles who have performed her work include EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble, the London Sinfonietta, I Musici de Montr\u00e9al, Ensemble Plus-Minus, Ensemble contemporain de Montr\u00e9al, and Continuum Contemporary Music. She has ongoing artistic relationships with the soprano Juliet Fraser and the Canadian string quartet Quatour Bozzini, for whom she wrote the pieces About Bach (2015), Leaving (2011), Warblework (2011) and Just So (2008/2018). These four works were released as an album by the label Another Timbre in 2018, alongside a second album of her orchestra and ensemble music. From 2010 to 2013, Miller also was artistic director of the concert series \"Innovations en concert\" in Montreal. Miller moved to London to take up the post of Associate Head of Composition (Undergraduate) at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in September 2018. == Use of transcription == Miller often bases her work on pre-existing music, for example: a computer transcription of Kurt Cobain singing the folk song \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\", in For Mira (2012), written for violinist Mira Benjamin, a recording of Maria Callas singing \"Vissi d\u2019arte\" from Puccini's opera Tosca in Bel Canto (2010), and a recording of an anonymous mbira player from Mozambique in Philip the Wanderer (2012). Her work takes these transcriptions as starting points, investigating her response to the music through processes of repetition and looping. Often the source material is unrecognisable in Miller\u2019s finished works. Her works employ musical notation, but also sometimes recordings of the source music, which performers learn by memory, such as a recording of the blues singer Maria Muldaur, which Miller uses in her piece Guide (2013). == Selected works == * Round (2017) for orchestra, for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra * Tracery (2017\u20132018) for voice and tape, in collaboration with Juliet Fraser ** Tracery : Handanger (2017) ** Tracery : Lazy, Rocking (2017) ** Tracery : The Slits (2017) ** Tracery : attending to a task (2018) * Traveller Song (2017) for ensemble, for Plus Minus * About Bach (2015) for string quartet * Duet for cello and orchestra (2015) for Charles Curtis and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at Techtonics Festival * Guide (2013) for vocal ensemble, for EXAUDI * Philip the Wanderer (2012) for piano * For Mira (2012) for solo violin * Leaving (2011) for string quartet * Warblework (2011) for string quartet * Bel Canto (2010) for mezzo soprano and ensemble * A Large House (2009) for orchestra, for the Jan\u00e1c\u011bk Philharmonic at the Ostrava New Music Days * Just So (2008/2018) for string quartet * O Zomer!
