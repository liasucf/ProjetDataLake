Thanks to a scholarship, he was able to attend the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze, where he studied with Giuseppe Bezzuoli. In 1846, he won the Grand Prize there for his painting The Young Moses Tramples the Crown of Pharaoh (Now at the ).

He also participated in the of 1861. His success there resulted in an appointment as a professor at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna. In 1862, he married Francesca Guasconi, with whom he had been having a relationship for ten years. This was probably a last wish, as she died shortly thereafter and he married Adelaide Badioli, a cousin of one of his students.

In 1897, he retired from the Accademia in Bologna and died not long after. == References == ==Further reading== * Dario Durb\u00e9; Antonio Puccinelli, 1997, Cassa di risparmio di San Miniato, with essays by Gaspare Borsellino and Emanuela Andreoli * Luciano Bernardini and Laura Dinelli; Antonio Puccinelli: l'uomo e l'artista, 2010, Edizioni Via del vento == External links == * Biography from the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani @ Treccani * More works by Puccinelli @ ArtNet Category:1822 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Italian painters Category:Italian portrait painters Category:Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze alumni ",
