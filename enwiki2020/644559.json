He played college football for Michigan, where he led the Wolverines to a share of the national championship in 1997. Woodson, a \"two-way player\" who played both offense and defense, won the Heisman Trophy in the same year.1997 - 63rd Award Charles Woodson Michigan Cornerback from Heisman.com. To date, he is the only primarily defensive player to win the Heisman, and he is the most recent player to win the Heisman who was not either a running back or quarterback. Woodson went on to accomplish a storied career professionally with one of the most decorated professional football resumes of all time. He is considered by many of his peers to be one of the greatest defensive players to have ever played. Woodson was drafted by the Oakland Raiders fourth overall in the 1998 NFL Draft. In his first season with Oakland, Woodson was selected as the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. He was named to the Pro Bowl and earned All-Pro recognition three consecutive times (1999\u20132001). In a 2002 AFC playoff match against the New England Patriots, Woodson seemed to have clinched the game by forcing a fumble by sacking quarterback (and former Michigan teammate) Tom Brady, but the ruling was overturned. Woodson later battled several nagging injuries in consecutive seasons in Oakland, leading to his departure after the 2005 NFL season via free agency. On April 26, 2006, Woodson signed a seven-year, $52 million contract with the Green Bay Packers. He would later win Super Bowl XLV with the team over the Pittsburgh Steelers. In his first season in Green Bay, Woodson was the team's punt returner and led the National Football Conference with eight interceptions, surpassing his previous career high of five, in his rookie year. In his second season in Green Bay, the injury problems returned and Woodson was forced to sit out two games. He was the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the 2009 NFL season. He returned to the Raiders in 2013, playing three more seasons and once more being voted to the Pro Bowl. Woodson is one of the few players in NFL history to play in a Pro Bowl in three different decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s). He is currently tied for fifth on the all time interceptions list with 65, and is tied with Rod Woodson and Darren Sharper for most career defensive touchdowns with 13. He also is second all time in interceptions returned for touchdowns, with 11. After he retired in 2015, he signed with ESPN in 2016. ==Early life== Woodson was born in Fremont, Ohio. As a senior at Ross High School, Woodson was named Ohio's \"Mr. Football.\" He finished his high school football career with the school's records for rushing yards (3,861) and scoring (466 points). In his senior season, he was a USA Today All-America selection and Parade High School All- American and recorded 2,028 yards and 230 points. All colleges recruited Woodson as a running back, while Michigan recruited him as a defensive back. In addition to playing football, Woodson also played basketball (point guard) and competed in track & field (relay sprinter and long jumper). ==College career== Woodson attended the University of Michigan, where he played for coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1995 to 1997.

He finished the season with 74 total tackles, seven interceptions, one pick-six, 17 passes defensed, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and two sacks. Woodson started the 2012 season in a different role for the Packers, hoping to fill the void left by free safety Nick Collins, who had been out of football for almost a year with a neck injury. He described it simply as \"just playing football\". Defensive Coordinator Dom Capers' plan appeared to be to line Woodson up at the safety position, while also situationally deploying him as the nickel-back. This saw Woodson in a Polamalu-like position of the Pittsburgh Steelers, lining up on either side ready to rush or drop back in coverage. Against the 49ers in week 1, the 35-year-old Woodson recorded 5 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble in a losing effort. Against Chicago Bears in week 2, he recorded his 55th interception of his career, and first as a strong safety. The pass was intended for Earl Bennett.

He played in the preseason and started in week 1 against the Indianapolis Colts. On October 6, in a game against the San Diego Chargers, Woodson tied the NFL record (with Darren Sharper and former teammate Rod Woodson) for most defensive touchdowns by scoring on a fumble recovery for his 13th defensive touchdown. By season's end, he had played in 1,067 of 1,074 possible defensive snaps for the team amassing 97 tackles (75 solo), 2 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries, 3 pass defenses, 1 interception, and the aforementioned touchdown. In the 2014 season opener, Woodson recorded an interception against the New York Jets. On December 7, 2014, he picked off Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers for his 3rd interception of the year, which sealed a Raiders victory. Woodson finished the season with 111 total tackles, four interceptions, eight passes defensed, one fumble recovery, and one sack. On January 26, 2015, the Raiders announced via Twitter that they had agreed to a contract for Woodson to return for the 2015 season. In the 2015 season, Woodson was moved to strong safety. After this switch, Woodson became one of the few players in NFL history to play at all three spots in the secondary. Prior to Week 5 against the Broncos, Woodson said that he always wanted to intercept a pass from Peyton Manning, as he had never accomplished the feat over his career. Woodson lived up to his word and picked off Manning two times. However, the Broncos won 16\u201310. Woodson in a game against the Denver Broncos in 2015 On December 21, 2015, Woodson announced that he would retire at the end of the season.

On February 12, 2016 it was announced that Woodson would be joining ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown, replacing Keyshawn Johnson for the upcoming season. He served in that capacity until 2018 when he moved to Fox Sports to cover college football as an analyst. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\" ! colspan=\"2\"|Legend |- | style=\"background:#cfecec; width:3em;\"| |Led the league |- | style=\"background:#afe6ba; width:3em;\"| | Team won the Super Bowl |- | style=\"background:#00FFFF; width:3em;\"| | AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year |- | Bold |Career high |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=center ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Team ! colspan=\"2\"| Games ! colspan=\"4\"| Tackling ! colspan=\"4\"| Interceptions ! colspan=\"4\"| Fumbles |- !

He partnered with former Robert Mondavi winemaker Rick Ruiz to develop a signature wine label, \"Twentyfour by Charles Woodson\". The company is based in Napa, California, and is a small boutique winery, producing fewer than one thousand cases per year of its two varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Although the wine bears his name and signature, Woodson was warned by the NFL not to be seen endorsing the wine himself because of the league's alcohol policy. Woodson was previously arrested twice: in 2000 for DUI, and in 2004 for public intoxication after refusing to get out of a woman's car. Woodson is married to his wife April Dixon Woodson and they have two sons together. On November 26, 2009, Woodson contributed $2 million to the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children's Hospital for pediatric research. Woodson has his own charitable foundation to support the fight against breast cancer known as \"Charles Woodson Foundation\". In October 2012, Woodson donated $100,000 to the Hurricane Sandy relief effort. During the Green Bay Packers' 2010 Super Bowl winning season, Woodson publicly called out US President Barack Obama on the latter's support for longtime Packers' rivals, the Chicago Bears. In a post-game locker room interview, Woodson stated, \"The President don't want to come watch us win the Super Bowl? Guess what? We\u2019ll go see him\" (implying that Green Bay would win the Super Bowl and visit the White House as the winning team does each year; a statement that would come true). During the 2012 United States Presidential election campaign, Woodson publicly endorsed Obama at a political rally in Green Bay, stating \"I believe in what he's trying to do.\" ==See also== * List of celebrities who own wineries and vineyards ==References== ==External links== * Charles Woodson Foundation * Green Bay Packers bio * Michigan Wolverines bio * * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:African-American players of American football Category:All-American college football players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football cornerbacks Category:American football return specialists Category:American football safeties Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:National Football League Defensive Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:Oakland Raiders players Category:People from Fremont, Ohio Category:Players of American football from Ohio Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players Category:American winemakers Category:Big Ten Athlete of the Year winners ",
