    "text": "The Waltham Water Works Shop is a historic municipal public works building at 92 Felton Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. The two story brick building was built in 1894, as part of a major municipal construction campaign. It is distinctive as a well-preserved yet utilitarian municipal structure, whose construction embodies some significant advances for the period. Its basement level, which originally housed a workshop, had a cement floor and was illuminated by both gas and electrical fixtures, all then somewhat advanced features. The main floor, which housed offices, space for carriages, and stalls for six horses, was constructed of concrete and iron. The upper floor housed storage as well as hay and fodder for the stabled horses. By the 1980s the building had been readapted by the city for use as a dog pound. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1894 Category:Buildings and structures in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts ",
