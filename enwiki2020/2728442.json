    "text": "Differences in pronunciation between American English (AmE) and British English (BrE) can be divided into * differences in accent (i.e. phoneme inventory and realisation). See differences between General American and Received Pronunciation for the standard accents in the United States and Britain; for information about other accents see regional accents of English speakers. * differences in the pronunciation of individual words in the lexicon (i.e. phoneme distribution). In this article, transcriptions use Received Pronunciation (RP) to represent BrE and General American (GAm) to represent AmE. In the following discussion: * superscript A2 after a word indicates that the BrE pronunciation of the word is a common variant in AmE. * superscript B2 after a word indicates that the AmE pronunciation of the word is a common variant in BrE. * superscript A1 after a word indicates that the pronunciation given as BrE is also the most common variant in AmE. * superscript B1 after a word indicates that the pronunciation given as AmE is also the most common variant in BrE. ==Stress== Subscript a or b means that the relevant unstressed vowel is also reduced to or in AmE or BrE, respectively. ===French stress=== For many loanwords from French AmE has introduced a final-syllable stress, BrE stresses an earlier syllable or, as in the original French, uses equal stress on each syllable. French loanwords that differ in stress only are listed below. {| cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 border=1 rules=rows frame=void |- ! align=left | BrE ! align=left | AmE ! align=left | words with relevant syllable stressed in each dialect |- valign=\"top\" | 1st || 2nd || d\u00e9b\u00e2cleB2 |- valign=\"top\" | 2nd || 1st || artisanalA1, liaisonabA2*, macram\u00e9ab, Renaissanceab |- valign=\"top\" | 1st || last ||balletA2, bandeau, barragea, batonab*, beignet, bereta, bidet, blas\u00e9A2, bouffantA2, brasserieb, brassi\u00e8reab, brevetabA2, brochureb*B2, br\u00fbl\u00e9e, buffeta, bustier, cachetA2, caf\u00e9*a*b, caffeineA2, calvados, canardaB1, chagrina, chaletA2, ch\u00e2teau, chauffeurA2, clich\u00e9*a, collagea*B2, cornet, crochet, croissant*a, croquet, debrisaA2, debut, d\u00e9corA2, detailaA2, \u00e9p\u00e9e, figurineB2, filetb, flamb\u00e9, frapp\u00e9, fricandeau, frontier, garageaB2, g\u00e2teau, glac\u00e9, gourmetA2, lam\u00e9, massif, massage, matin\u00e9e, m\u00e9tier, mirageB2, negligeeA2, n\u00e9v\u00e9, nonchalantbA2, nondescript, nouveau, parfait, parquet*b, pastelbB2, pastilleb, p\u00e2t\u00e9, pension, pissoir, plateau, pr\u00e9cisA2, prot\u00e9g\u00e9bB2, pur\u00e9e, rentier, risqu\u00e9, rou\u00e9, rouleau, sachet, salona, saut\u00e9, savantabA2, soir\u00e9e, solf\u00e8ge, sorbeta, sortie, souffl\u00e9, soup\u00e7on, tableau, tonneau, touch\u00e9, toup\u00e9e, triage, trousseau, vaccine, valet, vermouthB2.

This includes castrate, collate, cremateA2, curate, dictateA2, donateA2, frustrate, gradate, gyrate, hydrate, locateA2, migrate, mutate, narratebA2, phonate, placatebB2, prostrate, pulsate, rotate, serrateA2, spectate, stagnate, striate, translateA2, truncate, vacateb*A2, vibrateA2. Examples where AmE and BrE match include conflate, create, debate, equate, elate, inflate, negate; and mandate and probate with first-syllable stress. Derived nouns in -ator retain the distinction, but those in -ation do not. Also, migratoryB2 and vibratoryB2 sometimes retain the distinction. Most longer -ate verbs are pronounced the same in AmE and BrE, but a few have first-syllable stress in BrE and second- syllable stress in AmE: elongateaA2, impregnate, inculcate, inculpate, infiltrateA2, remonstrateabA2, sequestrate, tergiversateaA1. For some derived adjectives ending -atory stress-shifting to -a(tory)- occurs in BrE. Among these cases are celebratorya (BrE: ), compensatorya, participatorya, regulatoryaB1. AmE stresses the same syllable as the corresponding -ate verb (except compensatory, where AmE stresses the second syllable). A further -atory difference is laboratoryB2: AmE and BrE . ===Miscellaneous stress=== There are a number of cases where same-spelled noun, verb and/or adjective have uniform stress in one dialect but distinct stress in the other (e.g. alternate, prospect): see initial-stress-derived noun. The following table lists words not brought up in the discussion so far where the main difference between AmE and BrE is in stress. Usually, it also follows a reduction of the unstressed vowel. Words marked with subscript A or B are exceptions to this, and thus retains a full vowel in the (relatively) unstressed syllable of AmE or BrE. A subsequent asterisk, *, means that the full vowel is usually retained; a preceding * means that the full vowel is sometimes retained. Words with other points of difference are listed in a later table. {| cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 border=1 rules=rows frame=void |- ! align=left | BrE ! align=left | AmE ! align=left | words with relevant syllable stressed in each dialect |- valign=\"top\" | 1st || 2nd || AdonaiAB2, adultBAB2, albumen/albumin, aristocrat, Bernard, cerebral/cerebrumA2, complex (adj.), converseA2(adj.), illustrativeA2, miniscule/minuscule, Mosul, omegaA, patinaA1, perfume (noun), pianistAB2, sitar, sojourn (verb), stalactiteA2, stalagmiteA2, SuezA2*, thanksgivingABB2, transferenceAA2, travail, UlyssesA |- valign=\"top\" | 2nd || 1st || accent (verb)A2, alternate (adj.), ancillaryB, archangelB1, Argyle, AugustineBA2, Azores, backfire (verb), baptize, Baghdad, Balthazar, capillary, capsize, catenary, (bi/quin/)centenaryB2, circulatory, controversyB1, Corfu, corollary, defence/offenseAA2(sports only), deficitB1, elsewhereABAB2, enquiry/inquiryAA2, fritillary, Galbraith, guffawA1, Hong KongA2, Mardi Gras, marshmallowAB, maxillary, medullary, miscellany, obligatory, patronal, predicative, pretence/pretenseAA1, princess*AB2, prospect (verb), recluse, recourse, research (noun)AB2, respiratory, saxophonistBB2, spinet, spread(-)eagledAB, Stonehenge, stonewall, substratumABA2, tracheaAB2, wastepaper, waylay, weekendABB2, Zoroaster |- valign=\"top\" | 1st || 3rd || opportuneABB2, wolverine |- valign=\"top\" | 3rd || 1st || Bucharest, Budapest, disciplinary, furthermore, h(a)emoglobinAB, manganese, manateeB2, margarineB, PakistanA2, Panama, PyreneesAB, Singapore, stewardessB2 |- valign=\"top\" | 2nd || 3rd || submarinerA2, Yom KippurB2 |- valign=\"top\" | 3rd || 2nd || aboveboard, arytenoidA1, centrifugalB2, chimpanzee, obscurantismABA2 |- valign=\"top\" | 4th || 1st || manageress |} ==Affixes== ===-ary, -ery, -ory, -mony, -ative, -bury, -berry=== Where the syllable preceding the suffixes -ary, -ery, -ory, -mony or -ative is unstressed, AmE pronounces the penultimate syllable with a full vowel sound: for -ary and -ery, for -ory, for -mony and -ative. BrE reduces the vowel to a schwa or even elides it completely: or (hereafter transcribed as in diaphonemic transcription), and . So military is AmE and BrE , inventory is AmE and BrE , testimony is AmE and BrE and innovative is AmE or and BrE . (The elision is avoided in carefully enunciated speech, especially with endings -rary,-rery,-rory.) Where the syllable preceding -ary, -ery, -ory, -mony or -ative is stressed however, AmE also usually reduces the vowel: , . Exceptions include library, primaryA2, rosemary. (Pronouncing library as rather than is stigmatized in the United States, for example as associated with African-American Vernacular English,Hartwell, Patrick. (1980). \"Dialect Interference in Writing: A Critical View\". Research in the Teaching of English, 14(2), p. 103. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/40170844 whereas in BrE, is common in rapid or casual speech.) The suffix -berry is pronounced by similar rules, except that in BrE it may be full after an unstressed syllable, while in AmE it is usually full in all cases. Thus we have strawberry: BrE , AmE , and whortleberry: BrE/AmE . The placename component -bury (e.g. Canterbury) has a similar difference: AmE has a full vowel: where BrE has a reduced one: . Note that stress differences between the dialects occur with some words ending in -atory (listed above) and a few others like capillary (included in #Miscellaneous stress above). Formerly the BrE\u2013AmE distinction for adjectives carried over to corresponding adverbs ending -arily, -erily or -orily. However, nowadays some BrE speakers adopt the AmE practice of shifting the stress to the penultimate syllable: militarily is thus sometimes rather than , and necessarily is in BrE either or . ===-ile=== Words ending in unstressed -ile derived from Latin adjectives ending -ilis are mostly pronounced with a full vowel in BrE but a reduced vowel or syllabic L in AmE (e.g. fertile rhymes with fur tile in BrE but with furtle in AmE). AmE will (unlike BrE, except when indicated withB2) have a reduced last vowel: * generally in facile, (in)fertile, fissile, fragile, missile, stabile (adjective), sterile, tensile, versatile, virile, volatile * usually in agile, decile, ductile, futile, hostile, juvenile, (im)mobile (adjective & phone), puerile, tactile * rarely in domicileB2, erectile, infantile, nubile, pensile, percentile, projectile, reptile, senile, servile, textile, utile * never in crocodile, exile, gentile, reconcile; nor to compounds of monosyllables (e.g. turnstile from stile) In some words the pronunciation also comes into play: * BrE , AmE : c(h)amomileAB2, mercantileA2, mobile/stabile (decorations) * BrE , AmE or : motile, prehensile, pulsatile, tractile * BrE , AmE or : imbecile * BrE , AmE : rutile (BrE, AmE also ) Related endings -ility, -ilize, -iliary are pronounced the same in AmE as BrE. ===di-=== The pronunciation of the vowel of the prefix di- in words such as dichotomy, digest (verb), dilate, dilemma, dilute, diluvial, dimension, direct, dissect, disyllable, divagate, diverge, diverse, divert, divest, and divulge as well as their derivational forms vary between and or in both British and American English. ===-ine=== The suffix -ine, when unstressed, is pronounced sometimes (e.g. feline), sometimes (e.g. morphine) and sometimes (e.g. medicine). Some words have variable pronunciation within BrE, or within AmE, or between BrE and AmE. Generally, AmE is more likely to favor or , and BrE to favor . BrE , AmE (1) : carbineA2, FlorentineA2, internecineA2, philistineA2, pristineB2, salineA2, serpentineA2. BrE , AmE (1) (2) : adamantineA2. BrE , AmE : uterineB2. BrE , AmE (1) (2) (3) : crystalline, labyrinthine. BrE (1) , AmE (1) (2) : strychnineA2. ===Effects of the weak vowel merger=== The weak vowel merger causes affixes such as -ate (as in climate), be- (before a consonant), de- (as in decide), -ed (with a sounded vowel), -es (with a sounded vowel), -est, -less, -ness, pre- (as in prepare) and re- (before a consonant) to be pronounced with the schwa (the a in about), rather than the unstressed (found in the second syllable of locksmith). Conservative RP uses in each case, so that before, waited, roses and faithless are pronounced , rather than , which are more usual in General American. The pronunciations with are gaining ground in RP and in the case of certain suffixes (such as -ate and -less) have become the predominant variants. The noun carelessness is pronounced in GA and modern RP and in conservative RP. This variation is denoted with the symbol in some of the dictionaries published by Oxford University Press and in the Routledge Dictionary of Pronunciation of Current English. In the latter, the British pronunciation of climate is transcribed , though carelessness is transcribed . Affixes such as dis-, in-, -ing and mis- contain in conservative RP as well as General American and Modern RP, so that words such as disloyal or teaching are phonemically and in all three varieties. The suffix -ist is pronounced in RP and in GA. The latter pronunciation is considered to be non-RP, so that machinist is pronounced in RP and in GA. ==Weak forms== The title Saint before a person's name has a weak form in BrE but not AmE: before vowels, . ==Miscellaneous pronunciation differences== Entry for \"Herb\" from Walker's Critical Pronouncing Dictionary, (London: Tegg, 1833), showing pronunciation without /h/ These tables list words pronounced differently but spelled the same. See also the table of words with different pronunciation reflected in the spelling. === Single differences === Words with multiple points of difference of pronunciation are in the table after this one. Accent-based differences are ignored. For example, Moscow is RP and GAm , but only the \u2013 difference is highlighted here, since both the presence of a contrastive vowel in RP (which falls together with in GA) and the RP use of rather than are predictable from the accent. Also, tiara is listed with AmE ; the marry\u2013merry\u2013Mary merger changes this vowel for many Americans. Many sources omit the length marks in transcriptions of AmE, so that words such as father or keep are transcribed and rather than and . Even though it is not phonemic, vowel length in GA works in a very similar manner to RP, so this is mainly a difference in transcription. A2 means that American speakers may also use the British pronunciation;B2 means that British speakers may also use the American pronunciation. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! BrE !!
