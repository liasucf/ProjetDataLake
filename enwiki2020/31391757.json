The album's lead single \"Velcro\" was playlisted by at least 15 different American radio stations, as well as others in Europe such as Kink FM, Motor FM and Radio Eins. * The album was streamed one week prior to its release on the official Bell X1 website, Myspace page and SoundCloud. == Tour 2011 == Following touring in 2010, Bell X1 followed this with an announcement that they would headline at Live at The Marquee in Cork City.

It currently holds a Metacritic score of 58/100. State described the album as \"rejuvenated\" and Gold Plectrum describing the album as \"...a real return to form from Bell X1 and leaves us with future hope of similar releases\". RT\u00c9 gave the album 3/5 and claimed that the album \"could be their strongest bet yet\". Andrew Leahey writing for Allmusic gave the album three stars, noting the band's shift towards electronica in a similar fashion to fellow Irish act U2 with Pop, adding that Bell X1 \"sidestep\" the problems they encountered, \"using synthesizers and drum machines to enhance, not dominate, the songs\", while noting a decline in quality in the lyricism of Noonan. == Track listing == ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2011 albums Category:Albums produced by Roger Bechirian Category:Bell X1 (band) albums ",
