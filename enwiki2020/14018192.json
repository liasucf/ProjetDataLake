    "text": "Mouth Maze Cave is a large, labyrinthine river cave in Trelawny, Jamaica. It is the only exit of the Mouth River from a small valley which, during intense rainfall, becomes flooded as the flow backs up. Because of this it can only safely be visited in very dry periods. ==Natural history== The cave contains many invertebrates including, post hurricane Ivan, a termite nest. ==See also== *List of caves#Jamaica *Jamaican Caves Organisation ==References== ==External links== *Aerial view. *Mouth Maze Cave - Jamaican Caves Organisation Category:Caves of Jamaica Category:Geography of Trelawny Parish Category:Caves of the Caribbean ",
