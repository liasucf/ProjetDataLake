    "text": "The Kalmar Regiment (), designations I 20, I 21 and Fo 18, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was merged with another unit to form a new regiment in 1928. It was later reraised and disbanded again in 1997. The regiment's soldiers were originally recruited from Kalmar County, and it was later garrisoned there. == History == The regiment has its origins in f\u00e4nikor (companies) raised in Kalmar County in the 16th century. In 1616, these units--along with f\u00e4nikor from the nearby Kronoberg County--were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Sm\u00e5lands storregemente, of which twelve of the total 24 companies were recruited in Kalmar County. Sm\u00e5lands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Kalmar Regiment was one. Sometime around 1623, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which Kalmar Regiment was one. Kalmar Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. The regiment's first commander was Patrick Ruthwen. The regiment was allotted in 1686. The regiment was given the designation I 20 (20th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816. The designation was changed to I 21 in 1892. The regiment was garrisoned in Eksj\u00f6 from 1906, before it was merged with J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Regiment to form J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping- Kalmar Regiment in 1927. Kalmar Regiment was reorganised in 1994 as a local defence district with the designation Fo 18, although disbanded again just three years later in 1997. == Campaigns == *The Northern Seven Years' War (1563-1570) *The Livonian War (1570-1582) *The Polish War (1600-1629) *The Thirty Years' War (1630-1648) *The Northern Wars (1655-1661) *The Scanian War (1674-1679) *The Great Northern War (1700-1721) *The Hats' Russian War (1741-1743) *The Seven Years' War (1757-1762) *The Gustav III's Russian War (1788-1790) *The First War against Napoleon (1805-1810) *The Finnish War (1808-1809) *The Second War against Napoleon (1813-1814) *The Campaign against Norway (1814) == Organisation == ;1686(?) *Livkompaniet *\u00d6verstel\u00f6jtnantens kompani *Majorens kompani *\u00d6stra H\u00e4rads kompani *Uppvidinge kompani *V\u00e4stra H\u00e4rads kompani *Aspolands h\u00e4rads kompani *Konga h\u00e4rads kompani ;18?? *Livkompaniet *Vedbo kompani *Aspelands kompani *\u00d6stra H\u00e4rads kompani *Seveds kompani *Uppvidinge kompani *V\u00e4stra H\u00e4rads kompani *Konga kompani ==Heraldry and traditions== ===Colours, standards and guidons=== The regiment has carried a number of colours over the years. On 24 June 1866, major general P E Lov\u00e9n presented a new colour to the two battalions of the regiment, which then replaced the previous colours. The colours were used until the disbandment of the regiment, and were carried by J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping-Kalmar Regiment (I 12) from 1928 to 1954. When Kalmar Regiment was re-raised in the form of a defense district staff, the regiment was assigned a new colour. The new Kalmar Regiment adopted the same colour as the Kalmar Regiment which was disbanded in 1927. However, the regiment did not inherit the 1866 colour, but was presented with a new colour model 1994. The colour was presented in Kalmar by the Chief of the Army, lieutenant general \u00c5ke Sagr\u00e9n on 10 October 1992. It was used as regimental colour by Fo 18 until 15 December 1997. The colour is drawn by Bengt Olof K\u00e4lde and embroidered by machine and hand in insertion technique by Gunilla Hjort.
