The stadium, which was built along the lines of a typical horse race track grandstand, was constructed as part of the development of the then-new community of St. George, Staten Island in 1886, by Erastus Wiman. Although the community and the ferry were successful, baseball was not. The Giants were a strong team through the latter part of the 1880s, and the Metropolitans folded after the 1887 season. The Giants played some games there from April 29 \u2013 June 14, 1889, while awaiting construction of the Polo Grounds; their move to Manhattan ended professional baseball at St. George. == See also == * Bloomingdale Park * St George's Cricket Club * Staten Island Cricket Club * Van Cortlandt Park, currently used for cricket fields in New York City * Richmond County Bank Ballpark ==External links== *New York Metropolitans Attendance, Stadiums and Park Factors page on baseball- reference.com *National League ballpark table page at ballparks.com Category:Sports venues in Staten Island Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Cricket grounds in the United States Category:Lacrosse venues in New York (state) Category:Former sports venues in New York City Category:Demolished sports venues in New York (state) Category:Demolished buildings and structures in New York City Category:Cricket in New York (state) Category:Baseball venues in New York City ",
