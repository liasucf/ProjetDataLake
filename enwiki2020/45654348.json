    "text": "Luz no Meu Caminho () is the sixteenth studio album and the eleventh in Portuguese by Brazilian pop singer Xuxa Meneghel. Was released in October 1995 by the record company Som Livre. Like the previous release, Sexto Sentido (1994), Luz no Meu Caminho bets on the children's audience, with more mature songs and references of melodic funk and dance-pop. It received diamond certification by the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). ==Production and songs== After the success of the studio album Sexto Sentido, the audience that grew up with Xuxa wanted to see more and more songs aimed at teenagers, but the blonde still had the desire to make children's albums. The blonde even tried to get Paquitas to represent it with songs in this style, but the public's desire was stronger. One of the first recorded songs for the album was Saturday, composed as the theme of the Xuxa Park program. Soon after came Xuxa Hits, composed based on the eponymous picture that had been gaining more and more notoriety, gaining its own scenery and an \"independent\" schedule of the Park. The album approaches a more mature language bringing themes like ballad, religion, love and patriotism. One of the bands that stands out most is \"Brasileira\". The song portrays Xuxa's love for Brazil, extolling its people and culture. During the recording of the song, the presenter asked to include an excerpt from the 1994 World Cup narrative, when Brazil became four times champion, besides the story of Galv\u00e3o Bueno in one of the victories of Ayrton Senna. The blonde also shows the love for her land in another track, but this time, talking about her hometown, Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, which gives title to the song. \"Pr\u00edncipe Encantado\" was written based on the time when Xuxa lived at the time. The blonde felt very alone and dreamed of finding a boy who could make her happy. The music features elements of melodic funk, rhythm that dominated the radios in that period. Still in funk from Rio, the album brought the track \"Funkeiro\" that initially would be interpreted by a boy who would live the history of the music. But, Xuxa and her team could not find anyone to match, the lyrics underwent some changes for the blonde herself to play. Lincoln Olivetti came up with a totally different arrangement for the song, but Marlene Mattos preferred the version of the demo tape sent by the composer. The singer Abdullah participated in the song \"Como o S\u00e1bio Diz\", thus marking the first of several partnerships between him and the queen of the little ones. The composer also participated as backing vocal of several tracks of the disc. Among the more Children's music tracks, in addition to \"S\u00e1bado\" that was discarded at the end of the production, the presenter brought the joke \"Salada Mixta\", \"Sorvete\", \"Xu\u00e1 Xu\u00e1\" and \"Pra Qu\u00ea Fumar?\", that was written based on the campaign against the cigarette that the blonde starred in end of that year. On the album, the blonde also talks about her belief in the track \"Luz no Meu Caminho\". In a more direct way, this song included the song \"Crer Pra Ver\", recorded for the Christmas special of 1994. The song has the special participation of the christian music singer Aline Barros. Initially, \"Brasileira\" would be the title track of the album, but at the end of September they decided to change to Luz no Meu Caminho. For the art of the album, Xuxa herself chose the photo Hilly Desert Road Reflecting Sunset from photographer Eric Meola to illustrate the booklet. Luz no Meu Caminho was produced by Michael Sullivan, music producer of Xuxa from the Xegundo Xou da Xuxa (1987), had artistic direction of Aramis Barros and artistic coordination of Marlene Mattos, Xuxa Meneghel and Helio de Freitas. It was recorded in the Som Livre studios. ==Release and reception== Luz no Meu Caminho It was released by Som Livre in October 1995 in CD, cassette and LP being the last released in this format. It was reissued in 2001 and 2006 on CD, with changes in the back cover and insert. The album reached the 5th position among the most sold CDs in its debut week. In its second week, it reached the 4th position. Sold over 800,000 copies, was certified diamond by Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). ==Promotion== Beginning the release of the disc was released the song \"Xuxa Hits\". For the first time, Xuxa recorded a music video for a song with the sole intention of promoting his album and not just to show in his program and in specials. The video was distributed to the press and came to be shown on channels such as MTV Brasil and SBT. Gradually, other songs from Luz no Meu Caminho were released on the Xuxa Park show, but only \"Salada Mixta\" was released as a single. On October 15, 1995, Xuxa participated in Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o singing the songs \"Xuxa Hits\" and \"Salada Mixta\", in addition to presenting the Paquitas and the group You Can Dance. Shortly thereafter, \"Pra Qu\u00ea Fumar?\" was used as the theme of the Ministry of Health's campaign against cigarette smoking. \"Luz no Meu Caminho\", \"Salada Mixta\", \"Brasileira\", \"Como o S\u00e1bio Diz?\", \"Pra Qu\u00ea Fumar?\" and \"Ritmos\" won music videos at the Christmas special of 1995. The song \"Crer Pra Ver\" already had won a music video on last year's special. In the night program that celebrated the 10th anniversary of Xuxa in Globo in 1996, the song \"Pr\u00edncipe Encantado\" also won a video. Unlike the other albums, there was no tour of the Luz no Meu Caminho. In an interview shortly after the release of the album, the businesswoman of the time, the singer's manager Marlene Mattos justified that not touring was part of the marketing strategy. Marlene even considered the realization of two shows, one in Rio de Janeiro and another in S\u00e3o Paulo, with songs from the album, but it is not known why the plan did not materialize. In addition to VHS, Sexto Sentido - O Xou, released in May 1996, Globo V\u00eddeo even edited a VHS with the title Luz no Meu Caminho. It is unclear if the content would be the music videos from the album or the record of one of the shows planned by Marlene. == Track listing == ==Personnel== *Produced: Michael Sullivan *Art Direction: Aramis Barros *Artistic Coordination: Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel *Artistic Coordination: Helio de Freitas *Recording Technician: Mario Jorge Santos *Technical Supervision: Nolan Leve *Recording Assistants: Mauro Moraes, Julio Carneiro, Everaldo and Ivan Carvalho *Editing: Sergio Seabra *Recorded in the studios: Som Livre *Makeup Department: Promaster *Production Assistant: Duda Nogueira *Auxiliary Technicians: Sergio Rocha and Harley de Barros *Recording Technician: Jorge 'Gordo' ==Certifications== ==References== == External links == * Luz no Meu Caminho at Discogs Category:1995 albums Category:Xuxa albums Category:Som Livre albums Category:Portuguese-language albums ",
