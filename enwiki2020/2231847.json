    "text": "Jules Romains, born Louis Henri Jean Farigoule (26 August 1885 \u2013 14 August 1972), was a French poet and writer and the founder of the Unanimism literary movement. His works include the play Knock ou le Triomphe de la m\u00e9decine, and a cycle of works called Les Hommes de bonne volont\u00e9 (Men of Good Will). Sinclair Lewis called him one of the six best novelists in the world. He was nominated for the Nobel prize in literature sixteen times. ==Life== Jules Romains was born in Saint-Julien-Chapteuil in the Haute-Loire but went to Paris to attend first the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet and then the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He was close to the Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil, a utopian group founded in 1906 by Charles Vildrac and Ren\u00e9 Arcos, which brought together, among others, the writer Georges Duhamel, the painter Albert Gleizes and the musician Albert Doyen. He received his agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1909. In the interwar years, he pleaded the cause of pacifism and a united Europe against incipient fascism and despotism. In 1927, he signed a petition (that appeared in the magazine Europe on 15 April) against the law on the general organization of the nation in time of war, abrogating all intellectual independence and all freedom of expression. His name on the petition appeared with those of Lucien Descaves, Louis Guilloux, Henry Poulaille, S\u00e9verine... and those of the young Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre from the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure. His novel The Boys in the Back Room (Les Copains, literally \"the pals\") appeared in English in 1937. During World War II he went into exile first to the United States where he spoke on the radio through the Voice of America and then, beginning in 1941, to Mexico where he participated with other French refugees in founding the Institut Fran\u00e7ais d'Am\u00e9rique Latine (IFAL). A writer on many varied topics, Jules Romain was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 4 April 1946, occupying chair 12 (of 40). He served as President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers from 1936 to 1941. In 1964, Jules Romains was named citizen of honor of Saint-Avertin. Following his death in Paris in 1972, his place in the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise was taken by Jean d'Ormesson. Jules Romains is remembered today, among other things, for his concept of Unanimism and his cycle of novels in Les Hommes de bonne volont\u00e9 (The Men of Good Will), a remarkable literary fresco depicting the odyssey over a quarter century of two friends, the writer Jallez and politician Jerphanion, who provide an example in literature of Unanimism. ==Unanimism== Romains originally considered unanimism to mean an opposition to individualism or to the exaltation of individual particularities; universal sympathy with life, existence and humanity. In later years, Romains defined it as connected with the end of literature within \"representation of the world without judgment\", where his social ideals comprise the highest conception of solidarity as a defense of individual rights. His first book was La vie unanime, published in 1904, and in the preface to Men of Goodwill he identified the ideas in it as essentially the same as those of that later work. The Red Envelope catalog company, in their 2007 Holiday catalog, surprisingly featured Les Createurs on the cover in a photograph, showing a female model playfully frustrated with her husband, a male model posing as a detached intellectual, half-heartedly helping her to decorate the Christmas tree, while his attention is focused on reading Les Createurs. ==Works== * Men of Goodwill (Les Hommes de bonne volont\u00e9, 1932-1946; 27 volumes Paris: Calmann L\u00e9vy) * The body's rapture (Psyche), London: John Lane, 1933 * Tussles with time (Violation de Fronti\u00e8res, 1951), London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1952 * The Death of a Nobody (Mort de quelqu'un, 1911) ==Filmography== * ', directed by Ren\u00e9 Hervil (1925, based on the play Knock) * ', directed by Roger Goupilli\u00e8res and Louis Jouvet (1933, based on the play Knock) * Donogoo Tonka, directed by Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel (1936, based on the play Donogoo) ** Donogoo, directed by Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel and Henri Chomette (1936, based on the play Donogoo) * Dr. Knock, directed by Guy Lefranc (1951, based on the play Knock) * ', directed by Yves Robert (1965, based on the novel ') * Knock, directed by Lorraine L\u00e9vy (2017, based on the play Knock) ===Screenwriter=== * The Portrait (1923), directed by Jacques Feyder (1923) * ', directed by Maurice Tourneur (1941) ==References== ==Bibliography== * Mauthner, Martin, Otto Abetz and His Paris Acolytes - French Writers Who Flirted with Fascism, 1930\u20131945.
