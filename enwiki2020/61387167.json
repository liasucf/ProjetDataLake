    "text": "In mathematics, the ind-completion or ind-construction is the process of freely adding filtered colimits to a given category C. The objects in this ind-completed category, denoted Ind(C), are known as direct systems, they are functors from a small filtered category I to C. The dual concept is the pro- completion, Pro(C). ==Definitions== ===Filtered categories=== Direct systems depend on the notion of filtered categories. For example, the category N, whose objects are natural numbers, and with exactly one morphism from n to m whenever n \\le m, is a filtered category. ===Direct systems=== A direct system or an ind-object in a category C is defined to be a functor :F : I \\to C from a small filtered category I to C. For example, if I is the category N mentioned above, this datum is equivalent to a sequence :X_0 \\to X_1 \\to \\cdots of objects in C together with morphisms as displayed. ===The ind- completion=== Ind-objects in C form a category ind-C, and pro-objects form a category pro-C. The definition of pro-C is due to . Two ind-objects : F:I\\to C and G:J\\to C determine a functor :Iop x J \\to Sets, namely the functor :\\operatorname{Hom}_C(F(i),G(j)). The set of morphisms between F and G in Ind(C) is defined to be the colimit of this functor in the second variable, followed by the limit in the first variable: :\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{Ind}\\text{-}C}(F,G) = \\lim_i \\operatorname{colim}_j \\operatorname{Hom}_C(F(i), G(j)). More colloquially, this means that a morphism consists of a collection of maps F(i) \\to G(j_i) for each i, where j_i is (depending on i) large enough. ===Relation between C and Ind(C)=== The final category I = {*} consisting of a single object * and only its identity morphism is an example of a filtered category. In particular, any object X in C gives rise to a functor :\\\\{*\\\\} \\to C, * \\mapsto X and therefore to a functor :C \\to \\operatorname{Ind}(C), X \\mapsto (* \\mapsto X). This functor is, as a direct consequence of the definitions, fully faithful. Therefore Ind(C) can be regarded as a larger category than C. Conversely, there need in general not be a natural functor :\\operatorname{Ind}(C) \\to C. However, if C possesses all filtered colimits (also known as direct limits), then sending an ind-object F: I \\to C (for some filtered category I) to its colimit :\\operatorname {colim}_I F(i) does give such a functor, which however is not in general an equivalence. Thus, even if C already has all filtered colimits, Ind(C) is a strictly larger category than C. Objects in Ind(C) can be thought of as formal direct limits, so that some authors also denote such objects by : \\text{\u201c}\\varinjlim_{i \\in I} \\text{ } F(i). This notation is due to Pierre Deligne.Illusie, Luc, From Pierre Deligne\u2019s secret garden: looking back at some of his letters, Japanese Journal of Mathematics, vol. 10, pp. 237\u2013248 (2015) ==Universal property of the ind- completion== The passage from a category C to Ind(C) amounts to freely adding filtered colimits to the category. This is why the construction is also referred to as the ind-completion of C. This is made precise by the following assertion: any functor F: C \\to D taking values in a category D which has all filtered colimits extends to a functor Ind(C) \\to D which is uniquely determined by the requirements that its value on C is the original functor F and such that it preserves all filtered colimits. ==Basic properties of ind- categories== ===Compact objects=== Essentially by design of the morphisms in Ind(C), any object X of C is compact when regarded as an object of Ind(C), i.e., the corepresentable functor :\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{Ind}(C)}(X, -) preserves filtered colimits. This holds true no matter what C or the object X is, in contrast to the fact that X need not be compact in C. Conversely, any compact object in Ind(C) arises as the image of an object in X. A category C is called compactly generated, if it is equivalent to \\operatorname{Ind}(C_0) for some small category C_0. The ind-completion of the category FinSet of finite sets is the category of all sets. Similarly, if C is the category of finitely generated groups, ind-C is equivalent to the category of all groups. ===Recognizing ind- completions=== These identifications rely on the following facts: as was mentioned above, any functor F: C \\to D taking values in a category D that has all filtered colimits, has an extension :\\tilde F: \\operatorname{Ind}(C) \\to D, that preserves filtered colimits. This extension is unique up to equivalence. First, this functor \\tilde F is essentially surjective if any object in D can be expressed as a filtered colimits of objects of the form F(c) for appropriate objects c in C. Second, \\tilde F is fully faithful if and only if the original functor F is fully faithful and if F sends arbitrary objects in C to compact objects in D. Applying these facts to, say, the inclusion functor :F: \\operatorname{FinSet} \\subset \\operatorname{Set}, the equivalence :\\operatorname{Ind}(\\operatorname{FinSet}) \\cong \\operatorname{Set} expresses the fact that any set is the filtered colimit of finite sets (for example, any set is the union of its finite subsets, which is a filtered system) and moreover, that any finite set is compact when regarded as an object of Set. ==The pro-completion== Like other categorical notions and constructions, the ind-completion admits a dual known as the pro-completion: the category Pro(C) is defined in terms of ind-object as : \\operatorname{Pro}(C) := \\operatorname{Ind}(C^{op})^{op}. Therefore, the objects of Pro(C) are inverse systems or pro-objects in C. By definition, these are direct system in the opposite category C^{op} or, equivalently, functors :F: I \\to C from a cofiltered category I. ===Examples of pro- categories=== While Pro(C) exists for any category C, several special cases are noteworthy because of connections to other mathematical notions. *If C is the category of finite groups, then pro-C is equivalent to the category of profinite groups and continuous homomorphisms between them. *The process of endowing a preordered set with its Alexandrov topology yields an equivalence of the pro-category of finite preordered sets, \\operatorname{Pro}(\\operatorname{PoSet}^\\text{fin}), with the category of spectral topological spaces and quasi-compact morphisms. *Stone duality asserts that the pro-category \\operatorname{Pro}(\\operatorname{FinSet}) of the category of finite sets is equivalent to the category of Stone spaces. The appearance of topological notions in these pro-categories can be traced to the equivalence, which is itself a special case of Stone duality, :\\operatorname{FinSet}^{op} = \\operatorname{FinBool} which sends a finite set to the power set (regarded as a finite Boolean algebra). The duality between pro- and ind-objects and known description of ind-completions also give rise to descriptions of certain opposite categories. For example, such considerations can be used to show that the opposite category of the category of vector spaces (over a fixed field) is equivalent to the category of linearly compact vector spaces and continuous linear maps between them. ===Applications=== Pro-completions are less prominent than ind-completions, but applications include shape theory. Pro-objects also arise via their connection to pro-representable functors, for example in Grothendieck's Galois theory, and also in Schlessinger's criterion in deformation theory. ===Related notions=== Tate object are a mixture of ind- and pro-objects. ==Infinity- categorical variants== The ind-completion (and, dually, the pro-completion) has been extended to \u221e-categories by . ==Notes== ==References== * * . * * * * * Category:Functors Category:Limits (category theory) ",
