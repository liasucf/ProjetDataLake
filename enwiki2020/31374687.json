They renovated the facility, and renamed it Forest Lawn - Sunnyside in deference to its history\u2014later changed to Forest Lawn - Long Beach to match their other properties. The park was built with Spanish Colonial architecture, and has a number of noticeable features. The prominent Spanish Renaissance-style Cathedral Tower was designed by the Bryan family and the architect Clarence L. Jay, and has been a landmark since its construction in 1924-1925. There are elaborately designed doorways and arches, large Spanish windows in art glass, imported marbles, and tiling. Long Beach resident Julious Fisher created the intricate stencils and woodcarvings tracing the walls of the mausoleum. The marble was done by Lohr Marble Company in Pasadena, and restored by them in 1978. This was the first mausoleum to be equipped with Deagan tower chimes and pipe organ, and the only one with an echo organ in conjunction with its regular pipe organ. The Memorial Chapel, in adobe and red tile architecture, also reflects early California's Spanish and Mexican lineage.
