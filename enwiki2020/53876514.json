In New South Wales, Australia, the film was double billed with Tokyo File 212.\"Newcatle Theatre Reviews\". The Newcastle Sun. November 30, 1951. p. 10. Retrieved May 17, 2015 \u2013 via Trove. ==Production== Phil Karlson had just made a film for Eagle Lion, The Big Cat when asked to direct Down Memory Lane. He said someone from Eagle Lion had the idea to make a film in two days using all of Mack Sennett's old material including Bing Crosby and W.C. Fields. Karlson was a fan of Steve Allen on the radio and got him to play the lead role.Todd McCarthy and Richard Thompson. \u201cPhil Karlson: Interview, November 19, 1973\u201d Kings of the Bs; Working Within the Hollywood System, eds. Todd McCarthy and Charles Flynn (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1975), pp. 327-345. Rpt. Cine Resort, Oct. 7 2014 * From Steve Allen\u2019s first memoir: \u201cDuring this period I also found time to work in two motion pictures: I'll Get By, a lightweight Fox musical featuring June Haver, Gloria DeHaven, Bill Lundigan, and Dennis Day; and Down Memory Lane, a vehicle which afforded me the unusual opportunity of working with Mack Sennett and Franklin Pangborn, two real experts in the field of comedy. Of the two pictures, Down Memory Lane was the more interesting assignment because I was given the opportunity to write the screen play. This was not as weighty a matter as it sounds, however, since most of the picture consisted of ancient Mack Sennett film footage and the scenario ran to only sixteen pages. I also must admit that although there were a few hilarious moments scattered here and there it was rather a mess when patched together. Much to my embarrassment, the picture is frequently exhibited on The Late Show on television stations.\u201d ==Cast== * Steve Allen (new footage) * Bing Crosby (archive footage) * W.C.
