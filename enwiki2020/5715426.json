Shark Energy Drink is available in a number of variations, including carbonated, uncarbonated versions, sugared and sugar-free. The drink is manufactured in Thailand by the Osotspa Co. Ltd in Bangkok, and also in Europe by Shark AG in Innsbruck, Austria.. Shark Energy Drink is available in over 89 countries, and made its debut in UK nightclubs (like The Blue Orchid in Croydon) in 2002 & in the US later in 2008. The drink is slightly promoted in America, Europe and Asia. Regular Shark Energy contains natural caffeine from coffee, natural strawberry extracts and the Sugar-Free contains natural grape sugar. As of May 2020, Osotspa Co., Ltd has ceased production of the drink in Austria and has also left several European markets. ==See also== * Osotspa M-150 Energy Drink ==References== ==External links== * SHARK Energy Official website Category:Thai brands Category:Energy drinks Category:Products introduced in 1970 ",
