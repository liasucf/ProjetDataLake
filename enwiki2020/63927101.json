My first kiss, my first period, stories about secret family members, secret photos of other celebrities, etc... so don\u2019t read it!\" The book debuted at no. 8 on The New York Times list of bestsellers (Advice, How To- & Miscellaneous category) a week after it premiered. The book got a review of 4.5/5 stars on Apple Books and 4/5 stars on Google Books. Reviewers on Goodreads found the book \"super quick but good nonetheless\" and \"full of photos and funny little notes about her childhood\".
