Founded in 2011, it is a celebration of independent film from around the world, and an outlet for supporting and championing filmmaking. With over 400 films screenings and 100 industry events, ASFF is one of the UK's key film festivals.

The festival is hosted by Aesthetica Magazine, one of the world's leading art and culture publications and supported by York St John University, London College of Communication and the British Film Institute. ==History== ASFF is hosted by Aesthetica, a British art and culture magazine.
