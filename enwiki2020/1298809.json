Its first display was on 14 May 1952 over Copacabana beach, using the North American T-6 Texan. The team used the T-6 from its formation until 1968, when it switched to the French A\u00e9rospatiale (Fouga) CM.170-2 Super Magister jet, called T-24 in FAB service. However, this model proved unsuitable to Brazilian conditions and, in 1972, the squadron reverted to the T-6, which was used until 1977. The EDA was disbanded in 1977, but reformed on 8 December 1983 using Neiva T-25 Universal piston-powered aircraft, soon to be replaced by the then-new Embraer EMB-312 Tucano turboprop trainer. At the time the EDA's aircraft were painted a bright red scheme, which has since been superseded by the current gloss blue. ==Aircraft== The aircraft used by the EDA have been, in chronological order: * North American T-6 Texan for 1225 displays; * A\u00e9rospatiale (Fouga) CM.170-2 Super Magister for 46 displays; * Neiva T-25 Universal for 55 displays; * Embraer EMB-312 Tucano with more than 2000 displays as of 2010; * Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucano, being the two first ones delivered on September 30, 2012. In the subsequent two years, Super Tucanos have replaced the Tucano in the Smoke Squadron Fuma\u00e7a dever\u00e1 receber seus dois primeiros Super Tucanos neste domingo (Fuma\u00e7a must receive its two first ones Super Tucanos this Sunday) ==Objectives== \"Esquadrilha da Fuma\u00e7a\" during 2011 Brazilian Independence Day celebrations * To bring together civilian and military aeronautical communities * To contribute towards a better integration between the Air Force and the other Armed Forces * To represent the Brazilian Air Force in Brazil and abroad * To encourage youngsters to take up civilian and military aeronautical careers * To show the quality of the Brazilian aerospace industry * To show the capabilities of the Brazilian Air Force crews. ==Gallery== Image:smoke squadron aerobatics in tucano arp.jpg|Aerobatics in the Tucano during practice at RIAT 2008 Image:smoke squadron lands in tucano arp.jpg|A Tucano of the Esquadrilha da Fuma\u00e7a lands after practice at RIAT 2008 Image:Esquadrilha da fuma\u00e7a em evolucao 2007.JPG|Mirror formation Image:Esquadrilha da Fuma\u00e7a (8526994615).jpg|Smoke Squadron Display Image:Esquadrilha da Fuma\u00e7a (8529040773).jpg|Formation Image:Esquadrilha da Fuma\u00e7a encerra Semana da Asa com apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o em Salvador.jpg|EDF in Salvador ==References== ==External links== * * * Video showing the Esquadrilha da Fuma\u00e7a in action Category:Brazilian Air Force Category:Aerobatic teams ",
