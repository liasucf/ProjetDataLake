The film had its world premiere in western France after the Allies had liberated those territories following the D-Day Invasion. The film is based on the 1927 novel An Unmarried Father by Floyd Dell and the 1928 play Little Accident by Dell and Thomas Mitchell, which had been previously filmed by Universal Pictures in 1930 as The Little Accident and in 1939 as Little Accident. ==Plot== Arriving in a small Illinois town by train, Casanova Brown is met by Madge Ferris and tells her not to bring up his trip to New York. Cas decides to ask Madge to marry him, even though her father J.J. warns him against it, saying Madge is nothing but trouble. Cas leaves town because of a letter from a Dr. Zernerke summoning him to Chicago, but promises to be back in time for the wedding. A baby girl is at the Chicago hospital and Cas is asked for an explanation. He tells of his New York experience with Isabel Drury, of how they fell in love and decided to wed, only to have Cas repeatedly upset Isabel's mother by insulting her belief in astrology, ignoring her warnings that their union would be cursed, then inadvertently burning down the Drurys' house. After the marriage is annulled, Cas thought it was over. But now there's a baby. Cas disguises himself as a doctor and kidnaps the kid. He then decides to adopt it, but in a hurry to prove he has a stable home life, he proposes to the first woman he sees, Monica, a hotel maid, that they get married immediately. Madge is left at the altar, Isabel comes back claiming it was just a prank she was playing to get even with Cas for leaving her, and it turns out Monica didn't get to marry him after all because they didn't have a proper license. Cas and Isabel decide to give it another try. ==Cast== * Gary Cooper as Casanova Brown * Teresa Wright as Isabel Drury * Frank Morgan as Mr. Ferris * Anita Louise as Madge Ferris * Edmund Breon as Mr. Drury (as Edmond Breon) * Patricia Collinge as Mrs. Drury * Jill Esmond as Dr. Zernerke * Mary Treen as Monica Case, the Maid * Emory Parnell as Frank, the Bell Captain * Isobel Elsom as Mrs. Ferris * Halliwell Hobbes as Charles, the Butler * Charles Cane as Hicks * Larry Olsen as Junior (as Larry Joe Olsen) * Irving Bacon as Hotel manager * Dorothy Tree as Nurse Clark * Grace Cunard as Relative at baby window ==Awards== The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: for Best Score (Arthur Lange), Best Sound, Recording (Thomas T.
