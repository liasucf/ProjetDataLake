Their EP Feels Like That was released in 2018 and received a Juno Award nomination for Country Album of the Year. ==Origins== The Walker siblings grew up in North Dumfries, Ontario, and are two in a family of seven. Their parents owned and operated the Yee Haw Adventure Farm, where they used to perform for visitors. They got their band name from their mother, who suggested the Reklaws sounded more interesting than the Walkers, Sibling Rivalry, or Bro-Sis. Reklaw is Walker spelled backwards. They were nominated for the CCMA Discovery Artist Award in 2013 and then won the Emerging Artist Showcase at the Boots and Hearts Music Festival in 2013. They met with several Nashville songwriters before being signed by Universal Music Canada. ==Career== The duo scored their first national country music hit in 2017 with \"Hometown Kids\". In 2018, they released the EP Long Live the Night. The EP's title track was released in both a \"regular\" version and a Canadian Football League-themed rewrite which served as a theme song for CFL on TSN games. Later in the year they released the EP Feels Like That, won the Rising Star Award at the Canadian Country Music Association Awards, and performed the kickoff show at the 2018 Grey Cup. In August 2019, the Reklaws released their debut full-length album, Freshman Year. In October 2020, the Reklaws released their second album, Sophomore Slump, featuring their singles, \"Where I'm From\" and \"Not Gonna Not\". ==Tours== *Winter's a Beach *Friends Don\u2019t Let Friends Tour Alone Tour (with Dallas Smith and Dean Brody) ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:3.5em;\"| CAN |- ! scope=\"row\"| Freshman Year | * Released: August 27, 2019 * Label: Universal Music Canada * Format: CD, vinyl, digital download, streaming | 87 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sophomore Slump | * Released: October 16, 2020 * Label: Universal Music Canada * Format: CD, digital download, streaming | |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! style=\"width:18em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Long Live the Night | * Release date: February 16, 2018 * Label: Universal Music Canada * Format: Digital download, streaming |- ! scope=\"row\"| Feels Like That | * Release date: August 31, 2018 * Label: Universal Music Canada * Format: CD, digital download, streaming |- ! scope=\"row\"| Where I'm From (Deluxe) | * Release date: July 17, 2020 * Label: Universal Music Canada * Format: Digital download, streaming |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Certifications ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:3.5em;\"| CAN ! style=\"width:3.5em;\"| CAN Country |- | 2017 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Hometown Kids\" | \u2014 || 16 | | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| Feels Like That |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Long Live the Night\" | \u2014 || 6 | * MC: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Feels Like That\" | \u2014 || 1 | * MC: Gold |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Do Too\" | 98 || 6 | * MC: Gold | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Freshman Year |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Old Country Soul\" | 87 || 4 | * MC: Gold |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 2020 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Can't Help Myself\" | 49 || 1 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Where I'm From\" | 73 || 2 | | rowspan=\"2\"| Sophomore Slump |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Not Gonna Not\" | \u2014 || \u2014 | |} ===Promotional singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:3.5em;\"| CAN Digital |- | 2018 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Roots (World Junior Song)\" | 6 | align=\"left\" |- |} ====Notes==== ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
