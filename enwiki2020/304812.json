    "text": "James Edward Quigley (October 15, 1854 \u2013 July 10, 1915) was a Canadian-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Buffalo, New York (1897\u20131903) and Archbishop of Chicago (1903\u20131915). Quigley spoke six languages, which made him well-equipped to supervise dioceses with a number of large and varied immigrant communities. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== James Quigley was born in Oshawa, Ontario, the son of James and Mary Lacey Quigley. He came to the United States with his parents at age 2, settling at Lima, New York near Rochester. At the age of ten he was sent to live with his uncle, Father Edward Quigley, the rector of Immaculate Conception Church in downtown Buffalo. After graduating from St. Joseph's College in 1872, he won a competitive examination for entrance into the United States Military Academy, but soon relinquished his military ambition to study for the priesthood. He then entered Our Lady of Angels Seminary at Niagara Falls, New York, and later furthered his studies at the University of Innsbruck in Austria and College of Propaganda in Rome. ===Ordination and ministry=== While in Rome, Quigley was ordained a priest on April 13, 1879. Following his return to the United States, he served as pastor of St. Vincent's Church in Attica, New York until 1884, when he became rector of St. Joseph's Cathedral in Buffalo. He was transferred to St. Bridget's Church in the same city in 1886. Quigley preached in Latin, English, Italian and German. He was also conversant in French and Polish. He served for twelve years as the president of the Catholic Schools Board. ===Bishop of Buffalo=== On December 12, 1896 he was appointed Bishop of Buffalo, where he was consecrated bishop on February 24, 1897 by Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York. Nearly all the faculty and many of the students at Our Lady of the Angels Seminary went to Buffalo to observe the ceremonies.\"Rt. Rev. James Edward Quigley, D.D.\", History of the Seminary of Our Lady of Angels, The Matthews-Northrup Works, Buffalo, 1906 In keeping with Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclopedia Rerum novarum, Quigley took an active interest in working conditions. During the dock strike of Buffalo in 1899 the Lake Carriers' Association and the Longshoremen's Union chose him as mediator. After ten days of negotiations, the strike was settled on terms reached by the bishop. It was routine to pay workers in saloons, where often the saloonkeeper was also the hiring boss. This practice was terminated and prohibited by the terms of the agreement.Czarnecki, Anthony. \"The Most Reverend James Edward Quigley\", Hearst's International, Vol.4, International Publications, Incorporated, 1903 In 1902 socialists had begun to influence the unions in Buffalo to the extent that in some instances regulations were adopted that the Catholic members found unjust and oppressive. At the request of a number of German priests, Bishop Quigley wrote a pastoral letter in German to be read in their congregations calling on Catholic union members to assert their rights regarding union governance. Mass meetings were held, at which Quigley spoke. He asserted the Church's support of labor unions, denounced socialism and explained why the Church opposed the principles of socialism. The result was that the socialists lost control of the labor unions, and Quigley gained a national reputation.Donohue, Thomas. \"Buffalo.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3.

Like his predecessor, Archbishop Feehan, Quigley supported the establishment of ethnic parishes to address the needs of the newly arrived residents. In 1905 Quigley asked Father John De Schryver, SJ., a professor at St. Ignatius College, to organize a parish for the Belgian community; St. John Berchmans Parish at Logan Square was established.\"Our History\", St. John Berchmans School Other parishes were established for the Italian and Lithuanian communities. \"Chicago's urban parishes flourished as an important spiritual, cultural, and educational component of Chicago's life.\"Avella, Steven. \"Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago\", Encyclopedia of Chicago In 1908, twelve counties in the northwestern portion of the diocese were split off to form the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford.\"History of the Rockford Diocese\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford In December 1910, Archbishop Quigley approached Rev. Francis X. McCabe, C.M., President of DePaul University regarding the lack of opportunity for women to pursue higher learning in Catholic institutions. DePaul began admitting women the following year. In June 1912, Sister Mary Clemenza, B.V.M. and Sister Mary Teresita, were the first women to graduate from DePaul University.Chavez, Patty. \"Hence degrees may be conferred on women: DePaul's first female graduates\", DePaul University Archives, June 28, 2019 Quigley served as archbishop until his death at the age of 60. According to a resolution passed by the city council, Quigley was recognized as \"...one of those men who work quietly and behind the scenes, and who seek no public credit or applause for the work which they do; ...he spent himself...in particular in the service of the many and varied works of charity which have been founded...\"\"Council Proceedings July 12, 1915\", The Chicago City Manual, Chicago. Bureau of Statistics and Municipal library, 1915, p. 113 The Quigley Center in Chicago is named in his honor. ==References== Category:1854 births Category:1915 deaths Category:19th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:American Roman Catholic archbishops Category:American Roman Catholic clergy of Irish descent Category:Archbishops of Chicago Category:Burials at the Bishop's Mausoleum, Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside) Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States Category:People from Chicago Category:Roman Catholic Bishops of Buffalo Category:University of Innsbruck alumni ",
