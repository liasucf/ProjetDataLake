The current and existing band members for High Watt Crucifixers are Rich Mendez (vocals, rhythm and lead guitar), Mario Alvarez (lead guitar), Derek Einkauf (bass) and Chris Alaniz (drums). A fully independent band, High Watt Crucifixers continue to be a driving force of rock and roll within the Austin music scene. Their debut self-titled record was released in March 2010. == Band Name == The name, \"High Watt Crucifixers\" is inspired by a nickname of some organized religious sects who are often referred to as \"Bible Thumpers\", \"Holy-Rollers\" or \"Crucifixers\". Crucifixers are often seen on the street corners holding up signs, at rock shows handing out pamphlets with God's message, or walking door to door on any given morning on a mission to talk to anyone who is willing to listen, and convert people to their religion. The term, \"High Watt\" comes simply from the fact that high amounts of electricity are used to drive the powerful amplifiers that the band uses to deliver their message of Rock n' Roll Salvation. ==References== == External links == * Official Site Category:Hard rock musical groups from Texas Category:Musical groups from Austin, Texas Category:Musical groups established in 2007 ",
