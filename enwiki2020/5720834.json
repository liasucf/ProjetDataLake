The college was named one of the most affordable community colleges in the nation by the U.S. Department of Education. Students pay the lowest net price of any community college in the state, according to a recent Integrated Post Secondary Education Data Systems survey. LCCC also leads the state in student success with a 61% student success rate versus an average for Ohio Community College of 51% in a report issued by the Ohio Department of Higher Education in January.

Marilyn Valentino, professor emeritus of English, served as national chair of the Conference on College Composition and Communication in 2010. The college was the first community college in Ohio to offer an applied bachelor's degree in micro- electrical mechanical systems (MEMS). The MEMS program prepares students for entry into a career after completing hands-on paid internships. LCCC is also currently the only community college in Ohio to offer a MEMS associate degree program. LCCC was the first community college to exhibit a fabrication lab, the \"Fab Lab\", on its campus. As a Massachusetts Institute of Technology project in 2005, it was the second public facility in the country with the equipment. This technology allows students and the community first-hand experience with a very technical and economical skill. The new Campana Center for Ideation and Invention, which houses the \u201cFab Lab,\u201d allows students and community members to utilize cutting-edge digital and additive manufacturing labs, interaction collaboration space and hands-on education programs. ===University Partnership=== LCCC's University Partnership program offers more than 50 bachelor's and master's degrees from 14 Ohio universities to LCCC students through coursework taught on LCCC's campus by university partner instructors.

Many classes are held in the LCCC University Center building, a facility designed specifically for students enrolled in University Partnership degree programs. Other courses are also held at the University Partnership Ridge Campus in North Ridgeville. ==Locations== LCCC has four learning centers in other areas of Lorain County.
