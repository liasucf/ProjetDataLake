Police later identified her body only from the fragment of a cheque book, a diary and her driver's licence. ==Filmography== * Cin\u00e9panorama (TV series documentary, 1959) - herself * Les loups dans la bergerie (1960) - Madeleine * Les portes claquent (1960) - Dominique (together with her sister Catherine Deneuve) * Les \u00e9chos du cin\u00e9ma (TV series short, 1961-1962) - herself * Ce soir ou jamais (1961) - Dani\u00e8le * La fille aux yeux d'or (1961) - Katia * All the Gold in the World (1961) - La journaliste * Adorable menteuse (1962) * The Dance (1962) - Fran\u00e7oise * Les trois chapeaux claques (TV Movie, 1962) - Paula * Discorama (TV series, 1962) - herself * Ars\u00e8ne Lupin contre Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (film, 1962) - Nathalie Cartier * Teuf-teuf (TV movie, 1963) * 4 FOIS D - Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac (Documentary short, 1964) - herself * L'homme de Rio (1964) - Agn\u00e8s Villermosa * La peau douce (1964) - Nicole * Circle of Love (1964) * Male Hunt (1964) - Fran\u00e7oise Bicart alias Sandra Rossen * Les petites demoiselles (TV Movie, 1964) * Grand \u00e9cran (TV series documentary, 1964) - herself * Ni figue ni raisin (TV series, 1965) - herself * Genghis Khan (1965) - Bortei * Where the Spies Are (1966) - Vikki * Cul-de-sac (1966) - Teresa * New Reports from France (TV series documentary, 1966) - herself, segment 4 * Dim Dam Dom (TV series documentary, 1966) - herself * Gala de l'Unicef (TV series, 1966) - herself * Septi\u00e8me art septi\u00e8me case (TV series, 1966) - herself * Derri\u00e8re l'\u00e9cran (TV series, 1966) - herself * Julie de Chaverny ou la Double M\u00e9prise (TV Movie, 1967) - Julie * Tilt (TV series, 1967) - herself * Hollywood in Deblatschka Pescara (Short film, 1967) - herself, uncredited * Les demoiselles de Rochefort (1967) - Solange Garnier (also with Deneuve) * Billion Dollar Brain (1967) - Anya (final film role) * The Monkees - herself (TV series, uncredited; filmed days before her death; 1 episode, 1968, aired posthumously) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1942 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Actresses from Paris Category:French film actresses Category:French people of Norman descent Category:20th-century French actresses Category:Alumni of the French National Academy of Dramatic Arts Category:Road incident deaths in France Category:Dorl\u00e9ac family ",
