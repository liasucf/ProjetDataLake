    "text": "Aydamun (also spelled as Aidamoun or Aaidamoun) is a Lebanese village. == Location == It is located in Akkar District, about 15 minutes away from Kouachra, and 3 hours from the capital Beirut. == Population == It has a population of about 3,000 people, 75% of whom are of Sunni Turkish origin. Christians comprise the remainder (80% are Greek Orthodox, and 20% are Maronite). Due to its Turkish ethnic links, the village has received Turkish developmental assistance and funding. However, its Turkish links are not as strong as the nearby Turkish-populated village of Kouachra. In 1966 the village had a population of about 300 people, and it was famous for producing Akkar carpets, which were home-produced by the local women. The villagers support the Future Movement political party. == See also == *Turks in Lebanon == References == == External links == *Aaidamoun \u2013 Chikhlar, Localiban Category:Populated places in Akkar District Category:Sunni Muslim communities in Lebanon ",
