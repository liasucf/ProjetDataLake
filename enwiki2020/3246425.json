    "text": "Hassiba Ben Bouali () (18 January 1938 \u2013 9 October 1957) was a militant in the Algerian independence war (1954\u201362). She was born in El-Asnam, Algeria. Her parents moved to Algiers in 1947, where she studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Delacroix (high-school). She joined the Scout Movement, and her travels made her aware of the conditions of the Algerian people under the colonial government. This motivated her to join the Union g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des \u00e9tudiants musulmans alg\u00e9riens (General Union of Algerian Muslim Students) in 1954, at the age of 16. She participated in the nationalist struggle until her death. In the 1957 Battle of Algiers, she and three companions including Ali Ammar (aka Ali La Pointe) were killed when French forces bombed their hideout in the Casbah. Benbouali was depicted in the movie The Battle of Algiers by Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo. One of the largest avenues in Algiers and the University of Chlef were named after her. ==References== ==External links== * Universite Hassiba Ben Bouali biography (French) Category:1938 births Category:1957 deaths Category:People from Chlef Category:Algerian guerrillas killed in action Category:African women in war Category:Deaths by explosive device Category:Members of the National Liberation Front (Algeria) Category:Women in warfare post-1945 ",
