On April 5, 2016, he announced his engagement to fellow figure skater Caroline Zhang. They were married on August 18, 2018. == Career == Hochstein won the pewter medal (fourth place) on the junior level at the 2009 U.S. Championships. His ISU Junior Grand Prix debut came in the 2009\u20132010 season. Hochstein won silver in Budapest and placed fourth in Dresden, earning qualification to the ISU Junior Grand Prix Final, where he placed 5th. After finishing 7th on the senior level at the 2010 U.S. Championships, he was assigned to the 2010 World Junior Championships in The Hague, Netherlands. He placed first in the short program, 7th in the free skate, and 5th overall. In 2010\u20132011, Hochstein was invited to the 2010 Skate Canada International and finished 10th in his first Grand Prix appearance. He was 12th at the 2011 and 2012 U.S. Championships.

In the 2015\u20132016 season, Hochstein was invited to two Grand Prix events, the 2015 Cup of China and 2015 NHK Trophy, and finished fourth at both. At the 2016 U.S. Championships, he was awarded the pewter medal after placing 6th in the short program, 4th in the free skate, and 4th overall. After the event, he was named in the U.S. team to the 2016 Four Continents, and a week later, he was added to the World Championships, replacing the injured Nathan Chen. Ranked 6th in the short and 10th in the free, Hochstein finished 8th overall at Four Continents in Taipei. At Worlds in Boston, he placed 16th in the short, 9th in the free, and 10th overall.
