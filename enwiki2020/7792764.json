Home Room is a 133-minute feature debut and was released on September 5, 2003. The film is about two teenagers dealing with a post-Columbine experience. Home Room focuses more on the physiological side of events throughout the film. The two teenage girls in the movie, Deanna (Erika Christensen) and Alicia (Busy Philipps), are troubled after the high school massacre. Deanna, described by Holden as \u201cperky and so habitually upbeat,\u201d suffers a head injury from the shooting, and Alicia, \u201cdresses like a punk goth,\u201d is ordered by the principal (James Pickens Jr.) to visit Deanna in the hospital. While that happens, police detectives investigate whether Alicia was involved in the shooting, due to claims of her standing next to the shooters before attacking. The film explores the depth of both teenage girls and focuses on the friendship they develop throughout the movie. The movie received mixed reviews from critics.

You come away from the movie not only caring about both girls, but believing that the bond they develop is genuine.\u201d LA Times Staff Writer, Kevin Crust, stated, \u201cWith an unconscionably long running time of 2 hours and 11 minutes for what is essentially a two-hander between Philipps and Christensen, 'Home Room' feels like detention\u2014without the possibility of recess.\u201d === Films === * Home Room * Eye of the Storm * The List == Personal life == Ryan worked in a handful of award-winning independent films.
