    "text": "Angelica Rock is a small barren rock island emerging from Buzzards Bay, within the town limits of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The rock is privately owned and is located southwest of Sconticut Neck and Wilbur's Point. The island is home to a number of sea birds as well as a nonfunctional windmill structure. The Town of Fairhaven refers to it as \"Angelica Island,\" while official nautical charts refer to it as \"Angelica Rock.\" ==History and Ownership== In the early 1970s, the island was purchased by Dr. Aris T. Papas, a clinical psychologist and professor who intended to build a summer home there. Papas and his son constructed the windmill by hauling materials via rowboat, and the windmill was functional until it was destroyed by a storm months later. However, the summer home plans were abandoned and a concrete slab from the project remains there today. A family member tried to sell the island in the mid 1990s for about $100,000, but had no buyers. The island has been described as a local landmark and is a frequent subject for photographers. The property is still owned by the Papas family. ==References== Category:Fairhaven, Massachusetts Category:Coastal islands of Massachusetts Category:Islands of Bristol County, Massachusetts ",
