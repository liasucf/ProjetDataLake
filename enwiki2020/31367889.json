Washington County became part of a revised 33rd District. A new 4th District was created, consisting of Monroe and Vernon Counties (formerly parts of the 31st and 30th Districts respectively). This new district elected: *William Nelson, 1872-73 (Republican) of Viroqua *Adelbert Bleekman, 1874-75 (Republican) of Tomah In 1876, the District lost Monroe County, and gained Crawford County instead.

It elected: *James W. Murphy, 1893-1894 (Democrat) of Milwaukee *James C. Officer, 1895-1896 (Republican) of Milwaukee By 1896, the Milwaukee portion of the 4th District had been reduced to the 6th, 13th, 18th and 21st Wards, but it gained Whitefish Bay, and the Towns of Granville and Milwaukee. *J. Herbert Green, 1897-1903 (Republican) of Milwaukee After the 1901 redistricting, the 4th consisted of Milwaukee's 1st, 13th, 18th and 21st Wards and added the Villages of East Milwaukee and North Milwaukee. *J.

This district re-elected Morris for over a decade to come. By the 1931 redistricting, the City of Milwaukee portion of the 4th was reduced to the 13th, 18th and 21st Wards, but the district included the Town of Milwaukee and the village of Shorewood, plus the addition of the villages of Fox Point and River Hills. It continued to elect Oscar Morris until his 1939 death in office. *Milton T. Murray, 1939-1944 (Republican) of Milwaukee *John C. McBride, 1945-1948 (Republican) of Milwaukee *George A. Mayer, 1949-1952 (Republican) of Milwaukee *Harry F. Franke, Jr., 1953-1956 (Republican) of Milwaukee The 1950s was a period of redistricting plans, referenda and lawsuits. By 1954, the 4th District still had three Milwaukee Wards (the 1st, 18th and 20th), Fox Point, River Hills, Shorewood, and Whitefish Bay, and added Bayside, Brown Deer, and Glendale (which between them had absorbed all of the old Town of Milwaukee). This new 4th District elected: *Kirby Hendee, 1957-1960 (Republican) of Milwaukee *Jerris Leonard, 1961\u20131969 (Republican) of Milwaukee After more lawsuits and failure by the legislature to act, in 1964 the Wisconsin Supreme Court reapportioned the legislative districts for the 1964 elections. The 3rd and 18th Wards of the City of Milwaukee, the part of Bayside in Milwaukee County, Brown Deer, Fox Point, River Hills, Shorewood and Whitefish Bay became the new 4th. *Jerris Leonard was re-elected from the new district. *Nile Soik, 1969-1973 (Republican) of Whitefish Bay In 1971, the legislature was reapportioned without incident. The new 4th encompassed the seven North Shore suburbs, but also Thiensville, Mequon, and eight townships in Southeastern Washington County, from Erin in the southwest to Farmington in the northeast. This new district elected: *Bob Kasten, 1973-1974 (Republican) of Brown Deer, who left when he was elected to Congress. A special election was held, electing: *Jim Sensenbrenner, 1975-1979 (Republican) of Shorewood, who in turn resigned when he was elected to Kasten's old seat in Congress. He was succeeded in another special election by: *Rod Johnston, 1979\u20131984 (Republican) of Whitefish Bay In 1984, an election was held under a plan passed by the legislature in 1983, under which the 4th consisted of the North Shore suburbs east of Brown Deer and Glendale, plus part of Milwaukee's inner city and the East Side of Milwaukee east of the Milwaukee River south to where the river flows into Milwaukee's harbor. *Barbara Ulichny, 1985\u20131993 (Democrat) of Milwaukee A 1992 court-ordered redistricting moved most of the district west of the Milwaukee River, except for Glendale and part of Shorewood, and added a large slice of the inner city, extending at its westmost to the county line with Waukesha County. This new 4th elected: *Gwen Moore, 1993\u20132004 (Democrat) of Milwaukee A new court-ordered map was created in 2002, by which the District was moved even further west into the inner city and out to 124th Street. In 2004, it elected Lena Taylor, the present incumbent. The 2011 redistricting expanded the portion of the district in the inner city, while still retaining Shorewood and part of Glendale. Taylor was re-elected from that district in 2012. Note: the boundaries of districts have changed over history. Previous politicians of a specific numbered district have represented a completely different geographic area, due to redistricting. ==See also== Political subdivisions of Wisconsin ==Notes== ==External links== *4th Senate District, Senator Taylor in the Wisconsin Blue Book (2005\u20132006) Category:Wisconsin State Senate districts ",
