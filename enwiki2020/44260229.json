His three years of study there were not a pleasant experience, as he was very far from home. He still was influenced by Edward Carey Francis, the headmaster, who helped grow his Christian faith. Under his guidance, he taught Sunday school classes at the area and also encouraged planting trees near the village churches. While at Maseno he was confirmed in the Anglican faith. He spoke English fluently by his third year at the school. He was the only Christian at his family at this point in time. He moved to Alliance High School, in Kikuyu, in 1931, where he stayed until 1935, three years of this at secondary level and the remaining two in teacher training.
