J\u016bken is a martial art in which one mimics the abilities of animals as well as trying to attain spiritual peace. However, dissent grew among the creator's ten students. Three of them believed that they should use the suffering and hatred harnessed within humans to increase their power, using their power to assume their monstrous forms; the Three Kenma. After Brusa Ee was murdered, the Kenma gathered followers to practice an evil form of the J\u016bken style known as Rin J\u016bken Akugata. The other seven students believed that true strength should come from within and engaged their former friends in a great war, ending the fight with a forbidden technique to seal the Kenma' powers at the cost of losing their own human forms in the process, becoming the Seven Kensei. Followers of the Kensei created the Geki J\u016bken Beast Arts school: the J\u016bken of justice whose sport discipline enhances the human body with the self-produced positive Qi called \"Geki\".

By present time, a fallen student from the Geki J\u016bken school named Rio turns to the Rin J\u016bken style, rebuilding the Rinj\u016b Hall and brings the long-dead Rin J\u016bken users back to life as kyonshi to collect Rinki, Geki's polar opposite Qi, in order to resurrect the Three Kenma so that through them, he can become stronger. To fight the new Rinj\u016b Hall, Xia Fu had been training two youths: Ran Uzaki and Retu Fukami.
