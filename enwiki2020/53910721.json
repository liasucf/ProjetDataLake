    "text": "Beautiful Daughters is a 2006 documentary that follows the first-ever all- transgender production of Eve Ensler's famous play The Vagina Monologues. It was released in the United States on February 11, 2006. The documentary is directed by Josh Aronson and Ariel Orr Jordan and features Calpernia Addams, Jane Fonda, and Andrea James. == About == During the planning of this performance, Eve Ensler wrote a new monologue using narratives from the transgender cast called They Beat the Girl Out of My Boy. . . Or So They Tried. It promotes visibility of trans women, regardless of their anatomy. The documentary displays the hardships the all-transgender cast had to endure in order to make the production relevant to their identity. A few women involved in the production used their rendition of The Vagina Monologues as a platform to \"come out,\" having been closeted as transgender beforehand. == References == ==External links== * * Category:Transgender-related documentary films Category:Documentary films about theatre Category:LGBT theatre in the United States Category:2006 LGBT-related films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American films ",
