    "text": "In the mathematical subject of geometric group theory, the \u0160varc\u2013Milnor lemma (sometimes also called Milnor\u2013\u0160varc lemma, with both variants also sometimes spelling \u0160varc as Schwarz) is a statement which says that a group G, equipped with a \"nice\" discrete isometric action on a metric space X, is quasi- isometric to X. This result goes back, in different form, before the notion of quasi-isometry was formally introduced, to the work of Albert S. Schwarz (1955)A. S. \u0160varc, A volume invariant of coverings , Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, vol. 105, 1955, pp. 32\u201334. and John Milnor (1968).J. Milnor, A note on curvature and fundamental group, Journal of Differential Geometry, vol. 2, 1968, pp. 1\u20137 Pierre de la Harpe called the \u0160varc\u2013Milnor lemma ``the fundamental observation in geometric group theory\"Pierre de la Harpe, Topics in geometric group theory. Chicago Lectures in Mathematics. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 2000. ; p. 87 because of its importance for the subject. Occasionally the name \"fundamental observation in geometric group theory\" is now used for this statement, instead of calling it the \u0160varc\u2013Milnor lemma; see, for example, Theorem 8.2 in the book of Farb and Margalit.Benson Farb, and Dan Margalit, A primer on mapping class groups. Princeton Mathematical Series, 49. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2012. ; p. 224 ==Precise statement== Several minor variations of the statement of the lemma exist in the literature (see the Notes section below). Here we follow the version given in the book of Bridson and Haefliger (see Proposition 8.19 on p. 140 there).M. R. Bridson and A. Haefliger, Metric spaces of non-positive curvature. Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences], vol. 319. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999. Let G be a group acting by isometries on a proper length space X such that the action is properly discontinuous and cocompact. Then the group G is finitely generated and for every finite generating set S of G and every point p\\in X the orbit map :f_p:(G,d_S)\\to X, \\quad g\\mapsto gp is a quasi-isometry. Here d_S is the word metric on G corresponding to S. ==Notes== In many sources the \u0160varc\u2013Milnor lemma is stated under a slightly more restrictive assumption that the space X be a geodesic metric space (rather that a length space), and most applications concern this context. Sometimes a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action of a group G on a proper geodesic metric space X is called a geometric action.I. Kapovich, and N. Benakli, Boundaries of hyperbolic groups. Combinatorial and geometric group theory (New York, 2000/Hoboken, NJ, 2001), pp. 39\u201393, Contemp. Math., 296, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002, ; Convention 2.22 on p. 46 ==Explanation of the terms== Recall that a metric X space is proper if every closed ball in X is compact. An action of G on X is properly discontinuous if for every compact K\\subseteq X the set :\\\\{g\\in G \\mid gK\\cap K e \\varnothing\\\\} is finite. The action of G on X is cocompact if the quotient space X/G, equipped with the quotient topology, is compact. Under the other assumptions of the \u0160varc\u2013Milnor lemma, the cocompactness condition is equivalent to the existence of a closed ball B in X such that :\\bigcup_{g\\in G} gB=X. ==Examples of applications of the \u0160varc\u2013Milnor lemma== For Examples 1 through 5 below see pp. 89\u201390 in the book of de la Harpe. Example 6 is the starting point of the part of the paper of Richard Schwartz.Richard Schwartz, The quasi-isometry classification of rank one lattices, Publications Math\u00e9matiques de l'Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, vol. 82, 1995, pp. 133\u2013168 1\\. For every n\\ge 1 the group \\mathbb Z^n is quasi-isometric to the Euclidean space \\mathbb R^n. 2\\. If \\Sigma is a closed connected oriented surface of negative Euler characteristic then the fundamental group \\pi_1(\\Sigma) is quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane \\mathbb H^2. 3\\. If (M,g) is a closed connected smooth manifold with a smooth Riemannian metric g then \\pi_1(M) is quasi-isometric to (\\tilde M, d_{\\tilde g}), where \\tilde M is the universal cover of M, where \\tilde g is the pull-back of g to \\tilde M, and where d_{\\tilde g} is the path metric on \\tilde M defined by the Riemannian metric \\tilde g . 4\\. If G is a connected finite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a left-invariant Riemannian metric and the corresponding path metric, and if \\Gamma\\le G is a uniform lattice then \\Gamma is quasi-isometric to G. 5\\. If M is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, then \\pi_1(M) is quasi-isometric to \\mathbb H^3. 6\\. If M is a complete finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with cusps, then \\Gamma=\\pi_1(M) is quasi-isometric to \\Omega= \\mathbb H^3-\\mathcal B, where \\mathcal B is a certain \\Gamma-invariant collection of horoballs, and where \\Omega is equipped with the induced path metric. ==References== Category:Geometric group theory Category:Metric geometry ",
