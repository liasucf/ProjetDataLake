    "text": "D'Arcy Richard Baker (1877-1932) was a British businessman and racing driver. Baker was managing director of Fiat in the UK. In the early 1900s he extensively renovated Hedsor House, a mansion he owned in Hedsor, Buckinghamshire, but the expense led to his bankruptcy, and on his death his estate passed to his bankers, and then to the Shepherd family in 1934. In 1908, at Brooklands, Frank Newton drove a 90hp Napier motor car for its Australian owner Selwyn Edge, who had a \u00a3500 bet with Baker that his car could go faster than Felice Nazzaro's Fiat, but the Napier suffered from mechanical trouble. In 1911, he was aged 33, living at 18 Clarges Street, Mayfair, single, with two servants, and had one visitor, a Royal Navy officer, Oscar Valentin de Satge, son of Oscar de Satge.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XW2T-59Chttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-89N8-QNZG?i=87&cc;=2228170 He died in 1932 in the Wycombe district of Buckinghamshire, and his obituary was published on 15 March 1932 in the Gloucestershire Echo.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVH6-WP7Lhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q26M-BFGH ==References== Category:British racing drivers Category:1932 deaths Category:1877 births ",
