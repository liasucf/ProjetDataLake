Manuel Pel\u00e1ez was born in 1885 in the Huasteca region of the state of Veracruz, in the coastal area roughly between Tampico, Tamaulipas, and the port of Veracruz. He is primarily known in the Mexican Revolution as an independent general who kept the Carrancista forces at bay between 1915 and 1920. He fought to uphold the local political and economic autonomy of the region, and opposed the central government of Mexico City.Encyclopedia of Mexico, Manuel Pel\u00e1ez by Heather Fower-Salamini In 1901, oil was discovered in the Huasteca, and several foreign oil companies came into the region of buy or lease subsoil right from the local ranchers. The Pel\u00e1ez family was one of the first families to deal with the oil companies, and Manuel Pel\u00e1ez quickly emerged as a respected and influential broker between the local families and the oil companies. His experiences led him to become a successful businessman, labor contractor, and labor mediator.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 257 The 1910 Revolution brought uncertainty to the region, for both the oil companies and the local ranchers. The ranchers decided to join the Francisco Madero revolution hoping to keep economic and political control of the Huasteca away from the central government of Porfirio D\u00edaz. In late 1910, Pel\u00e1ez organized a small local group to fight for Madero. In October 1911, after D\u00edaz was deposed, Pel\u00e1ez was elected mayor of the municipality of \u00c1lamo as a supporter of Madero.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 257 He soon became disenchanted with Madero, however, when Madero began demobilizing the local paramilitary forces, and began restricting the operations of the foreign oil companies. He also became disillusioned with Madero because the new government seemed incapable of quelling the banditry and social unrest that followed the revolution. In October 1912, he joined the revolt of conservative F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz, nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz. When that revolt was failed, he fled to the United States.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 257Felix D\u00edaz, the Porfirians and the Mexican Revolution, Peter Henderson, 1981, pg 87 Victoriano Huerta deposed Madero in February 1913, and Pel\u00e1ez returned to the Huasteca in April of the same year. But he found that the area had become inundated with marauding bands calling themselves Constitutionalists. Some time after June 1913, Pel\u00e1ez went to Mexico City and conferred with the Huerta government, asking for assistance in quelling the marauders. The War Department commissioned Pel\u00e1ez a Major in the Home Guard and gave him funds to arm about 500 men. Pel\u00e1ez took to the field again to battle men claiming to support Venustiano Carranza.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 258 In October 1913, Pancho Villa won a major battle over seasoned federal troops and took the city of Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila. Congress then began to question Huerta\u2019s ability to bring peace to the land. Huerta responded by closing congress and arresting 84 congressmen. This caused Pel\u00e1ez to become disillusioned with Huerta, and he decided to follow an independent course, following neither Huerta nor the Carranza revolutionaries. In late April 1914, U.S. forces took the city of Veracruz, and then in May, Constitutional forces took the city of Tampico. Pel\u00e1ez seeing that the Huerta government would collapse, and fearing he would be taken by the victorious revolutionary forces, fled to the United States. In July of the same year, Huerta fled Mexico when his government collapsed.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 258 Pel\u00e1ez returned to Mexico in October 1914, but found the victorious revolutionaries split into two opposing factions: those who supported the continued leadership of Carranza, and those who supported the new government called the Government of the Convention. Greatly disliking Carranza and his followers, he decided to support the Government of the Convention ostensibly headed up by President Eulalio Guti\u00e9rrez, but actually controlled by Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. When Pancho Villa suffered a major defeated by Carranza\u2019s General \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n in the spring of 1915, the Convention Government collapsed, and Carranza declared himself in control of the Mexico. Pel\u00e1ez could not abide Carranza or his plans to bring the oil industry under control of his central government, so he reorganized his irregular forces and took to the field again. Calling himself a General, he imposes taxes on the local oil companies to support a small loyal and well armed rebel force. Between 1915 and 1920, General Pel\u00e1ez and his forces held off several attempts by the Carranza government to control the Huasteca.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 293-299 In January 1915, two months after Pel\u00e1ez began his rebellion, one of the major oil wells in the Huasteca caught fire, and burned spectacularly for three months. It was unclear what caused the fire, and both sides claimed the fire was due to malicious actions of the other. The prevailing opinion for many years was that Pel\u00e1ez and his forces started the fire when the oil companies refused to pay him money he demanded. Current scholarship now says the oil fire was started by lightning, but exacerbated because the local Carranza commander had closed a water pumping station in retaliation for the oil company not paying a levied fine.Felix D\u00edaz, the Porfirians and the Mexican Revolution, Peter Henderson, 1981 Pel\u00e1ez was a successful strategist who kept Carranza\u2019s armies on the defensive for five years. His loosely coordinated but well-paid guerrilla forces never numbered more than 3,000. While he never occupied a major city, his control of the countryside was seldom challenged. The heavily thicketed terrain, the extensive waterways, his access to weapons and ammunitions, and the support of the local population worked to his advantage in launching random surprise attacks on Carranza garrisons, payroll trains, and pipelines. His soldiers intimidated, killed, stole, and set fire to Carrancista garrisons and oil company properties at will, while leaving the Huasteca natives for the most part unharmed. Five Carrancista campaigns between 1917 and 1918 failed to subdue him.Heather Fowler Salamini, Caciquismo and the Mexican Revolution: The case of Manuel Pel\u00e1ez Chapter 11,Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 264 In 1916 and 1917, F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz attempted to overthrow the government. Both times Pel\u00e1ez offered him financial and moral support, but in 1918, he formally withdrew support from Diaz when it became apparent that D\u00edaz had neither the ability nor the capacity to succeed. Pel\u00e1ez also entered into negotiations with the Zapata movement during 1918 and 1919, but the two sides had only their hatred of Carranza in common, and never reached an agreement.Felix D\u00edaz, the Porfirians and the Mexican Revolution, Peter Henderson, 1981, pg 134 & 141 In October 1919, Pel\u00e1ez had American consular agent William O. Jenkins from Puebla \u2018arrested\u2019 to embarrass the Carranza government; demonstrating to the U.S. government that Carranza was unable to police the major cities. Jenkins was released unharmed later the same month, but was immediately arrested by Carranza\u2019s police for conspiring to embarrass the government.Zapata and the Mexican Revolution, John Womack, 1969, pg 346 Pel\u00e1ez is often dismissed as just a tool of the foreign oil companies, but his life is more complex than that. He enjoyed a large measure of genuine local popular support. While the civil war raged on in Mexico, bringing destruction, poverty, and hunger to most parts of the country; the oil-producing Huasteca region remained an enclave of prosperity. Oil operations were constantly expanding, and the oil companies provided their workers with regular pay and supplies of food and other goods, which were easily imported. Oil workers saw themselves as better than the revolutionary bandits, and saw Pel\u00e1ez as a defender of their interests.The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, Friedrich Katz, 1998 pg 452 On September 9, 1919, Pel\u00e1ez, F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz and Gildardo Maga\u00f1a, Zapata\u2019s successor, issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 to U.S. President Wilson urging his recognition of their belligerencies, in the hope that the United States would somehow internee on their behalf and oppose Carranza, but nothing came of this. By 1919, Carranza was proving to be ineffective and unpopular. The population favored the accession of \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n for the 1920 election, but Carranza did everything in his power to prevent Obreg\u00f3n\u2019s election. In the spring of 1920, Obreg\u00f3n\u2019s Sonoran supporters initiated the Agua Prieta Revolt and removed Carranza from power. Pel\u00e1ez agreed to support Obreg\u00f3n\u2019s revolt, and when Carranza was attempting to flee to Veracruz, one of Pel\u00e1ez\u2019s subordinates caught up to him and killed him. For his support, Obreg\u00f3n rewarded Pel\u00e1ez by having his rank of General confirmed, and he was named Chief of Military Operations in the Huasteca.Zapata and the Mexican Revolution, John Womack, 1969, pg 360Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 299-300 However, in this capacity, he lost his freedom to operate independently, and became accountable to Obreg\u00f3n\u2019s military command. Never really seeing eye-to-eye with Obreg\u00f3n, Pel\u00e1ez fell out of favor in the Obreg\u00f3n government, and so he moved to Los Angeles in April 1921. His lieutenants attempted to renew hostilities against the central government but they proved no match for the central government\u2019s machinations, and they were all disarmed by the end of 1921.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 304 Pel\u00e1ez returned to Mexico in 1923 with intentions of joining the Adolfo de la Huerta rebellion, but he was arrested before he could participate. A few months after the rebellion was crushed, he was released and retired to his Tierra Amarilly ranch, where he lived peacefully until his death in 1959. His family still retains extensive holding in the Huasteca.Oil and Revolution Jonathan Brown 1993 pg 306 ==Notes== ==Books== * Brown, Jonathan: OIL and REVOLUTION in Mexico, 1993 * Katz, Friedrich: The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, 1998 * Womack, John: ZAPATA: and the Mexican Revolution, 1969 * Henderson, Peter: F\u00c9LIX D\u00cdAZ, The Porfirians and the Mexican Revolution, 1981 * Salamini, Heather Fowler: \u2018Caciquismo and the Mexican Revolution: The case of Manuel Pelaez.\u2019 * Chapter 11 of \u2018Intellectuals and Power in Mexico\u2019 Papers presented at the VI Conference of Mexican and United States Historians, 1981 Pelaez, Manuel Pelaez, Manuel Pelaez, Manuel Pelaez, Manuel Category:Mexican people of Basque descent ",
