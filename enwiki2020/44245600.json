After plotting against Cardinal Richelieu he was tried and decapitated with his comrade de Thou in the Place des Terreaux, Lyon. In 1826, Alfred de Vigny published a historical novel inspired by this event, entitled Cinq-Mars ou Une conjuration sous Louis XIII (French: Cinq-Mars or A Spell on Louis XIII), which piqued the interest of historical painters. In 1829, Paul Delaroche produced Richelieu et Cinq-Mars remontant le Rh\u00f4ne (Richelieu and Cinq-Mars embark on the Rh\u00f4ne) and in 1835 Claude Jacquand displayed a first work, Cinq-Mars et de Thou, depicting the two men being led to their execution, in the Salon. In 1836, Jacquand presented a new work to the Salon, initially entitled Le baiser du d\u00e9part, after the first chapter of de Vigny's novel.Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, L'Invention du Pass\u00e9. Histoires de coeur et d'\u00e9p\u00e9e en Europe 1802-1850 (Exhibition Catalogue), Paris: Hazan, p. 171. == Description == The composition is inspired by the famous balcony scene from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. == Legacy == Jacquand continued his series of paintings on this theme with Cinq-Mars rendant son \u00e9p\u00e9e \u00e0 Louis XIII (Cinq-Mars Presents his Sword to Louis XIII) and with two further works Cinq-Mars \u00e0 Perpignan (Cinq- Mars at Perpignan) and Cinq-Mars allant au supplice (Cinq-Mars Going to his Execution), which were displayed in the Salon in 1837. The scene in Les Adieux de Cinq-Mars \u00e0 Marie d'Entraigues was reproduced in a more serious form by Charles Vogt in 1853. In 2014, it was displayed at the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon as part of the exhibition L'invention du Pass\u00e9. Histoires de c\u0153ur et d'\u00e9p\u00e9e 1802-1850. == References == == Bibliography== * category:History paintings Category:1836 paintings Category:French paintings Category:Paintings of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon ",
