Her southern Sami family was involved with reindeer herding, and her father was a pioneer in organizing the Sami community. At home, the family spoke southern Sami, and she did not learn Norwegian until she started at the Sami school in Havika outside Namsos in the late 1930s. Her interest in the South Sami language was aroused while attending school. When she took the examen artium at an early age, she had Southern Sami as a second language instead of Nynorsk. Jacobsen went on to study Northern Sami, German and South Sami at the university level, and became the first to be examined in South Sami. At her home in Majavatn, Jacobsen organized a language group to grow the Sami language. The participants were only allowed to speak Sami. She also taught Sami in several schools. In the 1970s, she was active in preserving the Sami school in Hattfjelldal, and she was also the spokeswoman for an action to create a Sami cultural center in the village, known later as Sijti Jarnge. She was also active in the work to start a Southern Sami theater. Jacobsen was a language consultant for the Sami Education Council from 1987 to 1991, and worked actively on publishing dictionaries.
