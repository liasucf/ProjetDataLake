    "text": "Tippet Rise Art Center is an arts venue located on an 12,000 acre working ranch in southcentral Montana, north of Yellowstone National Park. Established in 2016, the art center presents concerts by world-renowned classical musicians and exhibits large-scale contemporary outdoor sculptures. Tippet Rise's sculpture collection includes three sculptural structures by Ensamble Studio, two works by Alexander Calder on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden as well as works by Patrick Dougherty, Mark di Suvero, and Stephen Talasnik. In July 2019, a new structure designed by the architect Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 will open to the public. Tippet Rise has the stated purpose of celebrating the union of music, art, architecture, and landscape. Its patrons are artists and philanthropists, Peter and Cathy Halstead. Cathy Halstead is an abstract painter and Peter Halstead is a pianist, photographer, and poet. Cathy Halstead is the daughter of Sidney Frank, who was an entrepreneur and philanthropist. The art center is open to the public in limited numbers during the months of July, August and September. Reservations, via the art center's website, are required to visit Tippet Rise. == Outdoor sculptures == Tippet Rise opened in 2016 with eight monumental works by modern masters. * Beethoven's Quartet by Mark di Suvero \u2013 originally part of the collection at Storm King Art Center * Proverb by Mark di Suvero \u2013 (2002) formerly in the Dallas Arts District * Two Discs \u2013 (1965) by Alexander Calder * The Stainless Stealer \u2013 (1966) by Alexander Calder * The Inverted Portal by the Spanish architecture firm Ensamble Studio * The Beartooth Portal by the Spanish architecture firm Ensamble Studio * The Domo by the Spanish architecture firm Ensamble Studio * Satellite No. 5 Pioneer by Stephen Talasnik * Daydreams by Patrick Dougherty, a model of a nineteenth-century schoolhouse designed by CTA Architects Engineers, engulfed by twigs Tippet Rise shares similarities with large sculpture parks such as Storm King Art Center in New York and Gibbs Farm in New Zealand. == Music venues and performances == Tippet Rise Art Center includes three venues for live classical music performances and chamber music recitals: The Olivier Music Barn An informal and acoustically intimate indoor performance space with a direct view of the Beartooth Mountains. The scale and proportions of the 150-seat Olivier Music Barn are inspired by the Esterhazy Music Room, the performance space for which Franz Joseph Haydn composed his chamber music repertoire. A contemporary innovation\u2014a high ceiling suspended above the boxlike space\u2014is said to lend an elevated, ethereal character to the resonant acoustics, but is designed to mimic the pitched roof of a traditional wood barn. The building also houses Tippet Rise's visitor center, which includes a state-of-the-art recording room with 3D sound this summer and 4K high definition film projection capabilities. In January, 2019, Tippet Rise received LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council for the Olivier Music Barn's environmentally sustainable design and systems, including low-carbon emissions and near-net-zero energy consumption. All buildings on the art center's main campus are heated and cooled with a geothermal energy system; 8,000 square-feet of solar panels provide light and power to buildings and vehicles. Water consumption is minimized by collecting and reusing rain and snowmelt for irrigation.. The Domo Cast from the land at Tippet Rise and designed by the Spanish architectural firm, Ensamble Studio, founded in 2000 by Ant\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Abril and D\u00e9bora Mesa, the Domo is considered equal parts, land art, sculpture, and performance space. The Tiara Acoustic Shell An outdoor, 100-seat, portable venue. Musical Performances The inaugural season, in 2016, included seven weeks of classical music performances by world- renowned musicians and rising stars. Since 2016, many musicians have performed at Tippet Rise Art Center.
