    "text": "Fort Bassein, also known as the Vasai Fort or Corte de Ba\u00e7aim meaning \"Court of Bassein\" in Indo-Portuguese creole, \u0935\u0938\u0908 \u091a\u093e \u0915\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e in Maharashtrian Konkani, is a ruined fort in the town of Vasai (Bassein) in the Palghar district of Konkan division in Maharashtra, India. The name \"Bassein\" is the anglicised version of the Portuguese Ba\u00e7aim (the \"\u00e7\" pronounced as \"s\" and with the \"m\" silent), which is itself a derivation of an apparently native name that may have a connection to the tribal Vasa Konkani people of the North Konkan region, extending from Mumbai (Bombay) into \"South Gujarat\". Bassein's alternate official name is Vasai. The full form of the Portuguese name is \"Fortaleza de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o de Ba\u00e7a\u00edm\" or the Fort of St. Sebastian of Vasai. The fort is a monument of national importance and is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India.Monument #110, Mumbai Circle, ASI: http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_alphalist_maharashtra_mumbai.asp The fort and the town are accessible via the Vasai Road railway station which itself is in Navghar-Manikpur, a part of the city of Vasai-Virar, and lies to the immediate north of the city of Mumbai and Mira Road in Bhayandar. The Vasai Road railway station is on the Western Railway line (formerly the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway) in the direction of the Virar railway station. == History == Statue of Chimaji Appa Main entrance to the Citadel ===Pre- Portuguese Era=== The Greek merchant Cosma Indicopleustes is known to have visited the areas around Vasai in the 6th century and the Chinese traveller Xuanzang later on June or July 640. According to historian Jos\u00e9 Gerson da Cunha, during this time, Vasai and its surrounding areas appeared to have been ruled by the Chalukya dynasty of Karnataka. Until the 11th century, several Arabian geographers had mentioned references to towns nearby Vasai, like Thane and Nala Sopara, but no references had been made to Vasai. Vasai was later ruled by the Silhara dynasty of Konkan and eventually passed to the Seuna dynasty. It was head of district under the Seuna (1184-1318). Later being conquered by the Gujarat Sultanate, a few years later Barbosa (1514) described it under the name Baxay (pronounced Basai) as a town with a good seaport belonging to the king of Gujarat. ===Portuguese Era=== The Portuguese first reached the west coast of India when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut in 1498. For several years after their arrival in India, they had been consolidating their power in north Konkan. They had established a strong foothold in Goa, which they captured from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510. According to historian Manuel de Faria e Sousa, the coast of Vasai was first visited by the Portuguese in 1509, when Francisco de Almeida on his way to Diu captured a Muslim ship in the harbour of Mumbai, with 24 citizens of Gujarat aboard.

Based on the terms of the agreement, the Portuguese Empire gained control of the city of Vasai, as well as its territories, islands, and seas. The Mumbai Islands under Portuguese control include Colaba, Old Woman's Island, Mumbai, Mazagaon, Worli, Matunga, and Mahim. Salsette, Daman and Diu, Thane, Kalyan, and Chaul were other territories controlled and settled by the Portuguese. At the time, the cession of Mumbai was of minor importance - but retroactively it gained a crucial importance when the place passed from the Portuguese to the British in 1661 as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza and became a major trade centre - making this the treaty's most important long-term result. Vasai was the Portuguese northern capital at the time of the 16th-century treaty with the Sultan. Under Portuguese India, the fort was the Northern Court or \"Corte da Norte\", second only to the city of Goa, functioning as the headquarters of the Captain of the North. For approximately 150 years, the presence of the Portuguese made the surrounding area a vibrant and opulent city. As such it was the capital of Portuguese possessions on the coast north of Goa, over places such as Chaul-Revdanda, Karanja Island, the Mumbai Archipelago, Bandra Island, Juhu Island, Salsette Island including the city of Thane, Dharavi Island, the Vasai archipelago, Daman, Diu and other Portuguese holdings extending up the coasts to Pakistan, Oman, the UAE, Iran and other parts of the Persian Gulf. The ethnic community locally known in the Mumbai region as the \"East Indians\" were called \"Norteiro\" (Northern men) after the Court of the North functioning out of the fort. One of the few standing structures Church ruins within the fort ===Maratha Era=== In the 18th century, the Bassein Fort was taken over by the Maratha Empire under Peshwa Baji Rao's brother Chimaji Appa and fell in 1739 after the Battle of Vasai. The fort was taken by British in 1774 and returned to Maratha in 1783 under the Treaty of Salbai. The British in 1818 attacked and again took over the territory from the Marathas. The fort also played a strategic role in the First Anglo-Maratha War. === British Era === ==== Treaty of Vasai (1802) ==== The Treaty of Vasai (1802) was a pact signed on 31 December 1802 between the British East India Company and Baji Rao II, the Maratha Peshwa of Pune in India after the Battle of Pune. The treaty was a decisive step in the dissolution of the Maratha Empire. ==Present== The fort is a major tourist attraction in the region . The ramparts overlook what is alternatively called the Vasai Creek and the Bhayandar Creek and are almost complete, though overgrown by vegetation. Several watch-towers still stand, with safe staircases leading up. The Buildings inside the fort are in ruins, although there are enough standing walls to give a good idea of the floor plans of these structures. Some have well-preserved facades. In particular, many of the arches have weathered the years remarkably well. They are usually decorated with carved stones, some weathered beyond recognition, others still displaying sharp chisel marks. Three chapels inside the fort are still recognisable. They have facades typical of 17th-century Churches. The southernmost of these has a well- preserved barrel-vaulted ceiling. Besides all the structures, tourists often also observe the nature that has taken over much of the fort. Butterflies, birds, plants and reptiles can all be observed. The fort is also a popular shooting location for Bollywood movies and songs. The Bollywood hit \u2033Kambakkht Ishq\u2033 from Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya, Poster Lagwa Do from Luka Chuppi are bollywood songs short at the fort. Movies such as Josh, starring Shah Rukh Khan, and Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega have a number of scenes from the fort. Other films shot here include Khamoshi and Ram Gopal Verma's Aag. The fort was also one of the shooting locations for the international hit song 'Hymn for the Weekend' by British band Coldplay. The fort showcased at the start and in between is the Vasai Fort. The video features Beyonc\u00e9 and Indian actress Sonam Kapoor. The video has over 960 million views on YouTube as of July 2018, becoming the second most-viewed music video for Coldplay (after \"Something Just like This\"). The Archaeological Survey of India has started restoration work of the fort, although the quality of the work has been severely criticised by \"conservation activists\". Chimaji Appa Memorial == Accessibility == To visit the Vasai Fort, take a Western Railways train bound to Virar from Churchgate in Mumbai and alight at the Vasai Road Railway Station. If you are departing from the Central Railway or Central Railway Harbour Line, then you have to switch to the Western Railway line at either Dadar, Bandra or Andheri. Another railway line connects the Central and the Western Railways lines from Vasai Road Railway Station to Diva, a stop just beyond Thane city on the Central Railway line, and long-distance passenger trains travelling this route also carry commuters between the two lines. There is a railway station named Kopar between Diva and Dombivli. Passengers travelling from Thane or Kalyan can alight at Kopar and walk up the staircase and to Platform No. 3 where they can catch the Diva to Vasai train. The Vasai Road station is only an hour by train from Kopar station. Currently, there are 5 trains daily which goes to Vasai Road from Dombivli, Diva and Panvel and 5 trains from Vasai Road to Diva and Panvel. There is a State Road Transport Bus Terminus & Station adjacent and to the immediate west of the Vasai Road Railway Station in Manickpur- Navghar. The destination for buses going to the Vasai Fort is \"Killa Bunder\" or \"Fort Jetty/Quay\". There are buses every half-hour. Ticket cost \u20b9 5 per person and you can alight at the last stop and walk around. Auto rickshaws are also available, which can be hired from the western entrance to the railway station but cost more per head and are regarded as unsafe in that they are usually congested. Auto rickshaws are also available, which can be hired from the main road outside the station but it is \u20b9 20 per person. == Gallery == Some fauna and flora inside the fort: File:Baobab Tree at Vasai Fort.jpg|Baobab tree at the seaside entrance File:A grasshopper at the fort.jpg|Katydid Grasshopper File:Baby Caterpillers feeding on leaves at the fort.jpg|Baby caterpillars feeding on leaves File:Wild Flowers.jpg|Some wildflowers File:Spider having lunch.jpg|Spider from the family Araneidae feasting on a butterfly File:Beatutiful grasshopper.jpg|Katydid Grasshopper File:Eurasian Hoopoe at the Bassein Fort.jpg|African Hoopoe File:Unidentified Agamidae at Bassein fort.ext.jpg|Agamid Lizard ==See also== * Military history of Bassein * Treaty of Bassein (1534) * Treaty of Bassein (1802) * Portuguese India * Chimaji Appa * Battles involving the Maratha Empire * List of Maratha dynasties and states * List of people involved in the Maratha Empire * Marathi People * Maratha Army * Maratha Navy * Maratha titles * Military history of India * List of forts in Maharashtra * List of forts in India ==References== ==External links== *History of Vasai *Mumbai - The Cosmopolitan City *Mumbai Customs - History ==Bibliography== * * * Category:History of Vasai Category:16th-century forts in India Category:Portuguese forts in India Category:Portuguese structures in Mumbai Category:1530s establishments in Portuguese India Category:1534 in Portugal Category:Gujarat Sultanate Category:Forts in Palghar district Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of Portugal Category:Tourist attractions in Palghar district Category:Baroque architecture in India Category:1534 establishments in the Portuguese Empire Category:1534 treaties ",
