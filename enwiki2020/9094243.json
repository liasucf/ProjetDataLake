He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 137 matches and three goals over eight seasons, representing Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira, Sporting, Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es and Naval. Abroad, he played for Metalurh Donetsk, APOEL and Apollon Limassol, winning seven major titles with the second club. M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio appeared with Portugal at the 2004 Olympic Games. ==Club career== ===Portugal=== Born in Paredes, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio was a youth graduate of F.C. Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira, making his Primeira Liga debut on 1 October 2000 by playing four minutes in a 4\u20131 home win against C.F. Estrela da Amadora. He was first choice the following two seasons. On 25 June 2003, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio joined Sporting CP on a four-year contract, being the first signing of manager Fernando Santos. He said upon his arrival: \"I am an ambitious player. I have fought for this opportunity and now want to show my worth\". However, three years later and with only 18 competitive appearances to his credit, also being loaned to fellow league side Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es, he was released. Immediately after leaving the Lions, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio signed for two years with Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Naval 1\u00ba de Maio also in the top level. He was an undisputed starter during his tenure, scoring his third and last league goal on 14 January 2007 to contribute to a 3\u20130 away victory over Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. ===Metalurh Donetsk=== On 27 July 2008, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio moved to FC Metalurh Donetsk for an undisclosed fee. He made his Ukrainian Premier League on 19 August, in a 1\u20130 home win against FC Karpaty Lviv. On 25 September 2009, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio renewed his link for two more years, keeping him at the club until 2012. In March 2012, he became the first player to appear in 100 league games for Metalurh, achieving this feat against SC Tavriya Simferopol; he was released midway through that month alongside two other players, however, having scored twice in the competition, both goals coming against Karpaty in September 2011. ===APOEL=== On 15 May 2012, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio signed a two-year deal with Cypriot club APOEL FC, scoring his first goal against Alki Larnaca FC in a last-minute equaliser. He also participated with the team in the qualifying phase of the UEFA Europa League, netting against Aalesunds FK in a 2\u20131 home victory; at the end of his debut campaign he won the First Division, which was the first major accolade of his career. On 17 August 2013, APOEL beat Apollon Limassol 1\u20130 to win the Cypriot Super Cup and M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio scored a rare goal in the 35th minute. During the season, he appeared in five games in the group stage of the Europa League, and helped his side conquer the treble as they went on to add the league and the Cup. On 6 December 2014, M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio signed a two-year contract extension with APOEL, running until June 2017. ===Later years=== On 30 December 2016, after he cut ties with APOEL, free agent M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio signed a six-month deal with Apollon Limassol with an option for a further season. He subsequently returned to his homeland, where he played for Varzim S.C. and F.C. Felgueiras 1932. ==International career== M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio played for the Portuguese under-21s during two years, representing the nation at the 2004 UEFA European Championship, and was also in squad for the 2004 Summer Olympics football tournament. He won his first cap for the former on 15 October 2002, in a 2\u20134 loss in Turkey for the 2004 European Championship qualifiers. ==Club statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Pa\u00e7os Ferreira |2000\u201301 |Primeira Liga |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- |2001\u201302 |Primeira Liga |23||1||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||1 |- |2002\u201303 |Primeira Liga |27||1||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !52!!2!!6!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!58!!2 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Sporting |2003\u201304 |Primeira Liga |10||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- |2004\u201305 |Primeira Liga |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !12!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!5!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!18!!0 |- |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es |2005\u201306 |Primeira Liga |16||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||23||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !16!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!23!!1 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Naval |2006\u201307 |Primeira Liga |29||1||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||1 |- |2007\u201308 |Primeira Liga |28||0||4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||33||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !57!!1!!7!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!65!!1 |- |rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\"|Metalurh Donetsk |2008\u201309 |Ukrainian Premier League |30||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||33||0 |- |2009\u201310 |Ukrainian Premier League |29||2||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||39||3 |- |2010\u201311 |Ukrainian Premier League |27||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||28||0 |- |2011\u201312 |Ukrainian Premier League |17||2||2||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !103!!4!!10!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!119!!7 |- |rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"center\"|APOEL |2012\u201313 |Cypriot First Division |24||3||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||5 |- |2013\u201314 |Cypriot First Division |35||2||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||0||1||1||49||3 |- |2014\u201315 |Cypriot First Division |30||0||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||10||0||1||0||48||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Cypriot First Division |21||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0||1||0||36||0 |- |2016\u201317 |Cypriot First Division |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !112!!5!!16!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!37!!1!!3!!1!!168!!8 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !352!!12!!41!!3!!1!!0!!54!!3!!3!!1!!451!!19 |} ==Honours== APOEL *Cypriot First Division: 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316 *Cypriot Cup: 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315 *Cypriot Super Cup: 2013 ==References== ==External links== *APOEL official profile * *National team data Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Paredes, Portugal Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Campeonato de Portugal (league) players Category:F.C.
