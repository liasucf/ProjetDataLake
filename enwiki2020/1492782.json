In 1993 the town of Willington was added to the region served by the school. The current principal is Dr. Louis DeLoretto. == History == E.O.

On that day, Public Act 84-42 was instated and the State Legislature voted to give ownership of the school to the Town of Mansfield and the Town of Ashford as long as the towns agreed to pay for the physical rehabilitation of the school. The Town of Willington joined the region in 1993. ==Clubs and activities== The E.O.
