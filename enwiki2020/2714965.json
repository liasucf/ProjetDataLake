It is a panchayat village,2011 Village Panchayat Code = 220310, and it is the only village in its gram panchayat.2011 Census Village code for Dharmasthala = 617673, The town is known for its Dharmasthala Temple which houses the shrine of Shiva, Manjunatha, Ammanavaru, Chandranath and the Dharma Daivas (guardian spirits of Dharma) \u2014 Kalarahu, Kalarkayi, Kumaraswamy and Kanyakumari. The temple is unusual in that it is run by a Jain administration and poojas are conducted by Hindu priests of the Madhva order. Lakshadeepa, the festival of lights, is the annual festival of Dharmasthala in November\u2013December.Lakshadeepa http://www.ourkarnataka.com/temples/dharmasthala2.htm On an average the flow of pilgrims is about 10,000 people a day. A mechanised kitchen provides free food for all pilgrims, and there are guest houses with modern amenities. Dharmastala represents religious tolerance. A Jain Tirthankara is worshiped beside Daivas and Lord Manjunatha (Shiva). The priests are Vaishnavite Brahmins and the guardian of the temple a Heggade (Jain). To those who come here for justice, the Heggade dispenses judgments that are said to represent the will of the deities. ==Legend== Local legend says that the Shiva Linga in Dharmasthala was brought to Dharmasthala by a local person with great powers, named Annappa. Legend is that he used to work for the Heggade family. Once when the Heggade he was serving wanted to worship Lord Shiva, Annappa had assured him to get one linga and vanished from the sight. The next morning, he had already established the linga in Dharmasthala, a few metres away from Heggade's house. Later it was learned that the linga was from Kadri near Mangalore, from the Kadri temple. By then, Annappa had vanished and he was never again sighted in the vicinity. Now people in Dharmasthala worship Annappa as Annappa Panjurli, a local god deva and a hero. 800 years ago, Dharmasthala was known as Kuduma (\u0c95\u0cc1\u0ca1\u0cc1\u0cae) in Mallarmadi,Managalore Information |http://www.mangalore.com/documents/dharmasthala.html then a village in Belthangady (\u0cac\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0c82\u0c97\u0ca1\u0cbf). Here lived the Jain chieftain Birmanna Pergade and his wife Ammu Ballathi in a house called Nelliadi Beedu. Pergade and the local chieftains built several shrines and invited Brahmin priests to perform the rituals. These priests requested Pergade to install a Shivalinga beside the native Daivas. The Daivas then sent their vassal Annappa Swamy to procure the linga of Lord Manjunatheshwara (\u0cb6\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc0 \u0cae\u0c82\u0c9c\u0cc1\u0ca8\u0cbe\u0ca5\u0cc7\u0cb6\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cb0 \u0cb8\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cbf) from Kadri, near Mangalore. Subsequently, the Manjunatha temple was built around the linga. Around the 16th century, Shri Devaraja Heggade invited Shri Vadiraja Swami of Udupi to visit the place. The swamiji gladly came but refused to accept Bhiksha (food offering) because the idol of Lord Manjunatha had not been consecrated according to the vedic rites. Shri Heggade then requested the Swamiji to reconsecrate the Shiva Linga himself. Pleased by the observance of the vedic rites and Heggade's charity to all, the Swamiji named the place Dharmasthala the abode of religion and charity. Thus, the roots of charity and religious tolerance established by the Pergades 800 years ago have been nurtured and strengthened by 21 generations of the Heggade family of Tulu lineage (Heggade being a derivative from Tulu word Pergade). Today's Dharmasthala blossoms with the fruit of this selfless dedication. *Great historian Dr. Padoor Gururaj Bhat in his book Thulunadu '\u0ca4\u0cc1\u0cb3\u0cc1\u0ca8\u0cbe\u0ca1\u0cc1' (\u0cb8\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cbe\u0c9c\u0cbf\u0c95 \u0c9a\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc6\u0caf\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbf \u0c92\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cc1 \u0cb8\u0c82\u0cb6\u0ccb\u0ca7\u0ca8\u0cbe\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cae\u0c95 \u0cb5\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cc7\u0c9a\u0ca8\u0cc6)in a chapter page no. 88 to 96, \u0ca6\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb7\u0cbf\u0ca3 \u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1\u0ca6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbf \u0cb8\u0ccd\u0ca5\u0cbe\u0ca8\u0cbf\u0c95\u0cb0 \u0c9a\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc6 has recorded the true history of Dharmasthala temple and its management. \"Britishers handed over the management of this temple from Sthanika Brahmins to Kumara Heggade who supported British against Tipu Sultan.

Heggades managed this temple only after around 1795; Not 800 years as claimed by Heggade family. ==Museums== Manjusha Car Museum Sri Manjunatheshwara Cultural and Research foundation, started by the Temple committee, is engaged in preserving ancient manuscripts and paintings.
