    "text": "David Scondras (born January 5, 1946) is a former member of the Boston City Council, having held the District 8 seat from 1984 through 1993. He was one of a few members of the Democratic Socialists of America to be elected to public office.Democratic Left, vol. 8 no. 1 (January 1990), page 7. ==Political career== Scondras ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 1981, the last election when all seats were at-large. He ran successfully in November 1983, winning the seat for District 8 (Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Mission Hill, and Fenway\u2013Kenmore) and becoming the first openly gay Boston City Council member. He was re-elected to four two-year terms, before being defeated in the November 1993 election by Thomas M. Keane Jr. by just 27 votes (3,649\u20133,622). Leading up to that election, Scondras failed to receive the endorsement of Boston's LGBT-oriented newspaper, Bay Windows, who wrote that he was \"out of step with the changing gay community.\" ==Personal life== Scondras was born in 1946 in Lowell, Massachusetts,Angels, Liars, and Thieves, Book 1 p.12 and graduated from Lowell High School.Angels, Liars, and Thieves, Book 1 p.6 He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1968, a master's degree in economics from Northeastern University in 1974, and was an instructor in those topics at Northeastern from 1968 through 1987. In 1987, he founded a non-profit organization, Search For A Cure, focused on the development of HIV therapies. He is the author of a four-book autobiography titled Angels, Liars, and Thieves, released from 2015 through 2017. In 2007, Scondras pleaded guilty to child enticement, stemming from a 2006 event in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 probation, ordered to surrender his computer and register as a sex offender, and stay off the Internet and away from children younger than 16. Scondras later sued the city of Lawrence, charging them with cruel and unusual punishment and assault and battery. In his autobiography, Scondras characterized the event as \"being beaten and arrested for not having sex with a boy who did not exist.\"Angels, Liars, and Thieves, Book 1 p.5 His lawsuit was dismissed in 2011 because it lacked sufficient evidence. ==Works== * * * * ==See also== * Boston City Council election, 1983 * Boston City Council election, 1985 * Boston City Council election, 1987 * Boston City Council election, 1989 * Boston City Council election, 1991 * List of Democratic Socialists of America who have held office in the United States ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * Scondras election records at ourcampaigns.com * The Truth About HIV Prevention via YouTube (video discussion by Scondras) * Search For A Cure Category:1946 births Category:20th century in Boston Category:20th- century American politicians Category:American sex offenders Category:Boston City Council members Category:Gay politicians Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Living people Category:Members of the Democratic Socialists of America Category:Northeastern University alumni Category:People from Boston Category:People from Lowell, Massachusetts ",
