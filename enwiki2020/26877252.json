    "text": "International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A., usually shortened to IAG, is an Anglo-Spanish multinational airline holding company with its registered office in Madrid, Spain, and its operational headquarters in London, England. It was formed in January 2011 after a merger agreement between British Airways and Iberia, the flag carriers of the UK and Spain respectively, when British Airways and Iberia became 100% owned subsidiaries of IAG. Because British Airways was the larger company, its shareholders were given 55% of the shares in the new, merged company. Since its creation, IAG has expanded its portfolio of operations and brands by purchasing other airlines - BMI (2011), Vueling (2012), Aer Lingus (2015) and Air Europa (expected to be completed in 2020). The Group also owns the Level brand and Avios, the IAG rewards programme. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Madrid Stock Exchange. It is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and IBEX 35 Index. ==History== Iberia and British Airways aircraft tails, early 2010s ===Creation of IAG as BA/Iberia holding company=== British Airways and Iberia signed a preliminary merger agreement in November 2009. In April 2010, British Airways and Iberia signed a full merger agreement, with an intended completion date of late 2010, subject to securing the necessary regulatory approvals. The merger between British Airways and Iberia was completed on 21 January 2011, and shares in the new holding company IAG began trading in London and Madrid on 24 January. On 6 October 2011, IAG created Iberia Express, a new low-cost airline to operate short- and medium-haul routes from IAG's Madrid hub and provide transfer feed onto Iberia's longhaul network. Iberia Express began operations on 25 March 2012.BBC News \u2013 Spanish new low-cost airline Iberia Express launched. Bbc.co.uk (25 March 2012).

On 22 December 2011, IAG agreed a binding deal with Lufthansa to acquire BMI for \u00a3172.5 million. On 30 March 2012, the purchase was approved, subject to the condition that the combined group divest itself of 12 daily slots and lease two daily slots at Heathrow airport. The acquisition was completed on 20 April 2012, and the BMI fleet and routes were integrated into the British Airways schedule throughout 2012.International Airlines Group completes bmi acquisition. Guardian (20 April 2012). Retrieved on 7 July 2012. ===Purchase of Vueling, and creation of IAG Cargo (2012)=== On 8 November 2012 IAG made a cash tender offer to buy Vueling, a Spanish low-cost airline based in Barcelona. The offer was \u20ac7 per ordinary share of Vueling, with the total cost of acquisition anticipated to be \u20ac113m. It was funded from internal IAG resources. The reported total assets of Vueling were \u20ac805m and in the nine months to 30 September 2012 it had generated profits before tax of \u20ac59m. An increased offer of \u20ac9.25 was accepted by the Vueling board on 9 April 2013, and received majority shareholder approval on 23 April 2013. IAG took control of Vueling on 26 April 2013. In December 2012, IAG completed the merger of the cargo operations of British Airways, BMI and Iberia into a single business unit, IAG Cargo. ===Purchase of Aer Lingus (2015)=== In January 2015, IAG made a bid of \u20ac1.36 billion for Aer Lingus. This was expected to be accepted, after the rejection of two prior bids. In May 2015, the Irish government agreed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus to IAG, as did the Aer Lingus board in late January 2015. The takeover became irreversible on 18 August 2015. ===Creation of LEVEL brand=== In March 2017 it was announced that a new low cost longhaul airline named LEVEL was to start operating from Barcelona in June 2017. On 29 December 2017, it was announced that IAG bought major parts of defunct Austrian leisure airline Niki including 15 Airbus A321 aircraft and traffic rights in D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich, Vienna, Z\u00fcrich and Palma de Mallorca. It is planned to establish a new Austrian subsidiary of Vueling as a replacement for Niki.ch-aviation.com - IAG acquires Niki in \u20ac36.5mn deal 29 December 2017 ===Aborted Norwegian takeover, and group fleet orders=== In April 2018, it was reported that IAG was considering a takeover of Norwegian, a low-budget competitor to the group, however by early 2019 IAG had fully disposed of its stake in Norwegian. In June 2019, IAG signed a letter of intent to purchase 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft even though at the time of the signing the 737 MAX was still grounded worldwide following the two fatal crashes likely caused by the design of the MCAS system. Aviation analysts have questioned IAG's leadership in making such an order when the 737 MAX design is still being rectified. IAG CEO Willie Walsh, shrugged off the plane's uncertain future. \"We\u2019re partnering with the Boeing brand\", he said. \"That\u2019s the brand that I\u2019m doing business with. That\u2019s the brand that I\u2019ve worked with for years. And it\u2019s a brand that I trust\". At the 2019 Paris Air Show IAG also agreed to purchase 14 Airbus A321XLR aircraft, 8 for delivery to Iberia and 6 to Aer Lingus, with options for a further 14 of the aircraft. ===Purchase of Air Europa (2019)=== In November 2019, IAG announced that it planned to acquire Air Europa from Globalia, for \u20ac1 billion. The deal, funded by external debt, is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020, subject to regulatory approval. ==Corporate affairs== IAG current passenger fleet size (excluding cargo) - May 2020 Aer Lingus Airbus A330-200 British Airways Boeing 787-8 Iberia Airbus A350-900 Level Airbus A330-200 Vueling Airbus A320-200 ===Overview=== IAG is incorporated as a Sociedad An\u00f3nima in Spain, where the company board meetings are held, and is domiciled in Spain for tax purposes.

By 2013, Iberia had lost a billion euros, requiring IAG CEO Willie Walsh to defend the IAG merger. After further losses, IAG's balance sheet was in deep deficit as Iberia fought low-cost competition and a recession, and Walsh admitted that British Airways should perhaps have postponed the merger, saying, \"If I'd known the Spanish economy was going to deteriorate to the scale that it did, we may have delayed the decision but ultimately I believe the merger is the right thing\". From 2014 on, Iberia returned to profitability, showing Walsh's predictions had been justified. ==Operations== ===Subsidiary airlines=== British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Vueling and LEVEL operate under their separate brand names. For details of the current aircraft operated by the group, see the fleet details for each of the main operating subsidiaries - Iberia, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Vueling. The entire company serves around 200 destinations. ===Group frequent-flyer programme=== IAG operates the Avios frequent-flyer programme, which was created from the merger of the Air Miles, BA Miles, and Iberia Plus Points schemes on 16 November 2011. Avios points are the frequent flyer currency of Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, and LEVEL, and can also be used for travel within the Oneworld alliance including the likes of Vueling, LATAM, Finnair, etc. A restructure in 2015 meant that all of IAG's affiliated loyalty programmes which use Avios, including Avios Travel Reward Programme, British Airways Executive Club, and Iberia Plus, were transferred to Avios Group, an IAG subsidiary. It was announced in July 2018, that Avios.com would close to British Airways Executive Club members, with all points automatically transferred to British Airways. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Airline holding companies Category:Airlines for Europe Category:Airlines of Spain Category:Holding companies of Spain Category:IBEX 35 Category:Spanish companies established in 2011 Category:Holding companies established in 2011 Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange Category:Companies formed by merger ",
