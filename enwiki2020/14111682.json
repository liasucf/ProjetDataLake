(ed), Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2013, p. 1032 He first travelled to Tunis in 1904, and in 1904 he again visited with his friend, and subsequent business partner, Ernst Heinrich Landrock. The pair established a photographic studio in Tunis and worked closely for more than 20 years. They later established studios in successively, Munich, Leipzig and Cairo, publishing the works as by \"Lehnert & Landrock\". From the 1860s onwards photographs of people with different cultural values and sexual morality became popular for artistic and erotic reasons. According to Pascal Baetens, they border on racism and ethnocentrism.Baetens, Pascal (2007) Nude Photography, the art and the craft London: Doring Kindersley Limited, pp.14-15 () Lehnert spent the last part of his life at Redeyef, Gafza Oasis, Tunisia, where he died. ==See also== * List of Orientalist artists * Orientalism ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Austrian photographers Category:Czech photographers Category:Commercial photographers Category:Austrian erotic photographers Category:Czech erotic photographers Category:Austrian painters Category:Czech painters Category:Orientalist painters ",
