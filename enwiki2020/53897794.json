It was shot in an abandoned building in Spain, which she described: > 'This is a building that was going to be demolished to have a hotel built. > Luckily, I found it before the demolition, and its caretaker allowed me to > explore the amazing place. It was probably some of the most magical places > I\u2019ve ever been. It's located in the Barcelona city center, and is now a > hotel.' Vicente Salas began a project in Australia along with the photographer Ibai Acevedo named Anitpodes. She started to study visual research in the Open University of Catalonia .

In an interview for IT Fashion online magazine, Vicente Salas explained the process of her work: > I have the feeling of always being rehearsing. I practice and then I start > creating. I want to experiment and then be sure of what I am doing. What I > do, I do it guiding myself through my interests of the moment, and I am > drawn to people. I love them. They are fascinating. I love how you can > create a time of making a picture and understand what the person you are > photographing is giving to you.\u2019 == Awards == 2014: FLICKR 20 under 20: Selected photographer 2014: Project GrisArt Scholarship 2013: Fototalentos Banco Santander Foundation: First prize 2013: Sony World Photography Awards: First position for portrait category. 2012: Sony World Photography Awards: Finalist in the category of portraits for the convocation of YOUTH. 2011: Emergent Festival of Lleida: selected artist. == Exhibitions == 2015: TEDxyouth BCN: Sala Ciutat, Barcelona City Hall 2014: FLICKR 20 under 20 en Milk Studios, New York 2014: PALMAPHOTO 2014 Xavier Fiol Gallery, Palma de Mallorca, Espa\u00f1a 2014: REVELA-T festival in Can Manyer Library, Vilassar de Dalt-Barcelona 2014: Barcelona Negra, Valid Foto Gallery, Barcelona 2014: O.F.N.I in Valid Foto Gallery, Barcelona 2013: Sony World Photography Awards 2013, Somerset House (Arts and Cultural Centre) London 2013: Colecciona el mundo in Valid Foto Gallery, Barcelona 2013: Realidad y emoci\u00f3n in Valid Foto Gallery, Barcelona 2012: Sony World Photography Awards 2012, Somerset House (Arts and Cultural Centre) London 2012: Emergent Lleida 2011, Valid Foto Gallery, Barcelona == References == BERTA VICENTE SALAS // ENTREVISTA.
