    "text": "The 2016\u201317 Gibraltar Premier Division (known as the Argus Insurance Premier Division for sponsorship reasons) was the 118th season of the national amateur and semi-professional football league in Gibraltar since its establishment - the highest level of football in Gibraltar. The league was contested by ten clubs, the top eight clubs from last season and two promoted clubs from 2015\u201316 Gibraltar Second Division. Lincoln Red Imps were the reigning champions, sealing a record 22nd title last season. The season began on 21 September 2016 and ended on 22 May 2017. Europa won the title, ending Lincoln's 14 title run and winning their first title since 1952. ==Format== As with the previous season, each of the ten Premier Division teams played each other three times for a total of 27 matches each. The tenth-placed team was relegated while the ninth-placed team from the Premier Division entered a playoff with the second-placed team from the Second Division for a spot in the 2017\u201318 Premier Division. Starting from this season, Gibraltar are granted two spots instead of one in the Europa League. The season also saw the introduction of a Home Grown Player (HGP) rule, forcing clubs in both of Gibraltar's divisions to have at least 3 Gibraltarian players in their matchday squads, with at least one on the field of play at all times. ==Teams== After the previous season, Angels and Britannia XI were both relegated to the Second Division; Europa Point and Mons Calpe were promoted in their places. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Club !data-sort- type=\"number\"|Finishing position 2015\u201316 |- |Europa FC || 2nd |- |Europa Point || 1st in Second division (Promoted) |- |Gibraltar United || 8th |- |Glacis United || 7th |- |Lincoln Red Imps || 1st (Champions) |- |Lions Gibraltar || 4th |- |Lynx || 5th |- |Manchester 62 || 6th |- |Mons Calpe || 2nd in Second division (Promoted via play-off) |- |St Joseph's || 3rd |} ===Personnel and kits=== Note: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
