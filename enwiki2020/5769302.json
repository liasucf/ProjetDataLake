After he was ousted he became the leader of a group of mercenaries whose services were sought by Knossos in Crete. Once in Crete. The leaders of Knossos ordered him to attack their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who came to Crete with an army under their king Archidamus III. As Phalaikos was besieging Lyttus, the Spartans arrived and relieved the siege. Later in 343 BC Phalaikos attacked and laid siege to Kydonia, (C.M. Hogan, 2008) where he was routed and he lost his life. ==Sources== * Theocharis Detorakis, (1994). A History of Crete. Heraklion: Heraklion. . * C.
