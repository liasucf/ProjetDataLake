Although having started out as a part of the national defense, the Danish shooting movement in the later years have had a strong focus on sport shooting. The largest sport event Landsst\u00e6vnet has been held since 1862, and now consists of not only shooting, but also sports like gymnastics, football, badminton, dog agility, lawn bowls, handball and beach volleyball.DGI Landsst\u00e6vne 2021 Brochure The Landsst\u00e6vne is currently held every fourth year, and the next event is set to be held in 2021 at Svendborg. == History == The Danish shooting movement is considered to have started when H. P.V. M\u00f8nster, a Danish artillery captain and school officer at the Royal Danish Military Academy, wrote an article in the newspaper Fedrelandet (lit. \"The Fatherland\") 19 January 1861 where he gave his support to the shooting movement and sparked an interest in the Danish people.Ringsted Skytteforening - DGI-Skydning er Danmarks \u00e6ldste idr\u00e6ts- og fritidsorganisation. \u00abSkyttebev\u00e6gelsen tog sin begyndelse i Danmark d. 19. januar 1861, med kaptajn H.P.V. M\u00f8nsters indl\u00e6g i avisen F\u00e6drelandet. Her blev der agiteret for oprettelse af skytteforeninger efter engelsk forbillede.\u00bb His appeal was however first and foremost intended toward landowners, since he found it hard to imagine a nationwide organisation. The article resulted in a committee being appointed, which merely a month after the article had been published gave a recommendation to create shooting associations in all parts of Denmark with the goal to provide the Danish population with rifle shooting training. The Centralcomit\u00e9en til oprettelse af skytteforeninger was established 10 February 1861.Kj\u00f8benhavns Skytteforening - Om Kj\u00f8benhavns Skytteforening The association De Danske Skytteforeninger was subsequently founded in 1862.Rigsarkivet, Arkivserie: Skyttefester og landsst\u00e6vner (1862 - 1950), Arkivskaber: De Danske Skytte-, Gymnastik- og Idr\u00e6tsforeninger (1862-1950) During the same time as the so- called riffelforeninger (rifle clubs) were established in Denmark, similar clubs promoting the shooting cause were also created in NorwayNOU 1988:17 Frivillige organisasjoner as folkev\u00e6pningssamlag and in Sweden as skarpskyttef\u00f6reningar. The rifle clubs often had a strong connection to the folkeh\u00f8yskolene (lit. people colleges). In Denmark, in particularly many rifle clubs were created after 1864 following the defeat in the Second Schleswig War.H\u00f8rve skytteforening - Klubbens historie Danish shooters had participated in the first modern olympics in 1896, but De Danske Skytteforeninger (DDS) was more focused on the national defense and national shooting competitions compared to international sport shooting. The Dansk Skytte Union (DSU, literally Danish Shooting Union) was therefore established in 1913. Gymnastics became a part of De Danske Skytteforeninger, and DDS therefore in 1919 changed name to De Danske Skytte- og Gymnastikforeninger (DDSG, literally the Danish Shooting and Gymnastics Associations). By the way, a competing gymnastics association called De Danske Gymnastikforeninger (the Danish Gymnastics Associations) was later founded in 1929. In 1930, DDS again changed its name, this time to De Danske Skytte-, Gymnastik- og Idr\u00e6tsforeninger (DDSG&I;, the Danish Shooting, Gymnastics and Sports Associations). After the German invasion during World War II the rifle clubs were allowed to continue their activities, but only for valid members, and the bolts also had to be stored by the police authorities between shootings.Skytteforeningens historie - Afsnit 2 \u00abVed bes\u00e6ttelsen i 1940 kom der bestemmelser om, at l\u00e5sene til gev\u00e6rerne straks efter skydningen, skulle afleveres til sognefogeden\u00bb In 1943 all firearms were confiscated by the Germans, and when the firearms were to be returned in 1945 all long distance firearms were missing. Therefore, shooting activities immediately after the war only consisted of shooting on 15 and 50 meters, until DDSG&I; successfully landed a deal with the Swedes to borrow them 10 000 Mauser rifles of the type Carl Gustav model 98.Skytteforeningens historie - Afsnit 2 \u00abMen i 1943 blev alle v\u00e5bnene, b\u00e5de de private og foreningens v\u00e5ben inddraget. Da krigen sluttede i maj 1945 og v\u00e5bene skulle leveres tilbage, var alle langdistanceriflerne i den sidste tid af krigen, tyskerne, og kom aldrig tilbage. [..] efter, at krigen sluttede i maj 1945, lykkedes det De Danske Skytte- Gymnastik og Idr\u00e6tsforeninger, at f\u00e5 en aftale med svenskerne om l\u00e5n af 10.000 Mausergev\u00e6rer, model Carl Gustav model 98\u00bb In 1947, field shooting was established as a new discipline under the name terr\u00e6nskydning.Kj\u00f8benhavns Skytteforening - Skydningens historie In 1952, DDSG&I; celebrated their 90 years anniversary.Skytteforeningens historie - Afsnit 4 Having started from rifle shooting, DDSG&I; in 1972/1973 also established pistol shooting as part of their competition program.Skytteforeningens historie - Afsnit 3 Their main shooting event of the year, Landsst\u00e6vnet, was broadcast on TV for the first time in 1971. In 1978 DDSG&I; also incorporated field shooting with pistol as a competition program. In November 1992, the new association the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI) was founded by merging De Danske Gymnastik- og Ungdomsforeninger (DDGU) and De Danske Skytte-, Gymnastik- og Idr\u00e6tsforeninger (DDSG&I;). In 2013 De Danske Skytteforeninger (DDS) also became a part of DGI.DGI Skydning \u2013 Store norske leksikon == See also == * Swedish shooting movement * De Danske Skytteforeninger, now part of the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI) * Rekylkorps, numerous freikorps created in the beginning of the 1900s to support the Danish defense * Folkev\u00e6pningssamlag, an association of voluntary rifle clubs in Norway during the 1880s and 1890s == References == Category:Military of Denmark ",
