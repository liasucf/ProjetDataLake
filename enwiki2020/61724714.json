    "text": "The Harry Wade Exit Route was discovered and made by Henry Wade from Illinois in 1849. Henry Wade, his wife and children were in the Bennett-Arcan party caravan emigrating west. At the direction of guide Jefferson Hunt the caravan took a poorly planned turn and descended into Death Valley, California while looking for a shortcut off the Old Spanish Trail. The caravan of a 100 wagons were looking for the shortcut to get to the California Gold Rush sooner. Some of the party died in the valley and the name stuck. Henry Wade found a path out of the Valley, the trail he made is today called the Henry Wade Road, a dirt road. After departing Death Valley Wade found the Old Spanish Trail and came to Southern California though the Cajon Pass. Many in the party also suffered but nonetheless made it out of Death Valley. Harry Wade Exit Route was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.622) on October 9, 1957. A marker was placed about 30 miles north of Baker, California, on the Harry Wade Exit Route, to designate where his family escaped. The marker is at the southern end of Death Valley National Park.

This was a group of pioneers from the Eastern United States that endured a long and difficult journey during the late-1840s California Gold Rush to prospect in the Sutter's Fort area of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada in California. Their route from Utah went through the Great Basin Desert in Nevada, and Death Valley and the Mojave Desert in Southern California, in attempting to reach the Gold Country. The Death Valley party had split up from the Donner Party that took a more northerly route which would prove to be even more difficult. ==Marker== The marker at the site (about 30 miles north of Baker) reads:californiahistoricallandmarks.com CHL No. 622 Harry Wade Exit Route \u2013 San Bernadino [sic] Telescope and Wildrose Peaks from Emigrant Canyon Road ==See also== *Santa Fe And Salt Lake Trail Monument *Death Valley *Death Valley National Park *Geology of the Death Valley area *Places of interest in the Death Valley area *History of California through 1899 *William L.
