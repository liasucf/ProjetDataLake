    "text": "Corallus batesii, the Amazon Basin emerald tree boa, is a species of boa found in the tropical rainforests of South America. This species has been revalidated from the synonymy of Corallus caninus by Henderson and colleagues in 2009. ==Taxonomy and etymology== English naturalist John Edward Gray originally described this species as Chrysenis batesii in 1860.Gray JE (1860). \"Description of a New Genus of Boid\u00e6 discovered by Mr. Bates on the Upper Amazon\". Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Third Series 6: 131-132. (Chrysenis batesii, new species). (original text). The specific name, batesii, is in honor of Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist and explorer, for whom Batesian mimicry is also named.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Corallus batesii, p. 19). ==Description== The Amazon Basin emerald tree boa has a yellow belly. The dorsum is dark green with an enamel-white vertebral stripe, which has confluent partial crossbars, often bordered by some black spots. Corallus batesii differs from C. caninus by the shape and the number of scales across the snout. C. batesii is bigger than C. caninus, growing to a total length (including tail) approaching . ==Distribution and habitat== The \"Basin species\", as the common name suggests, is only found in the basin of the Amazon River, in southern Suriname, southern Venezuela to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil and in the surrounding jungles of the Amazon River.Bernarde PS, Albuquerque S, Barros TO, Turci LCB (2012). \"Serpentes do Estado de Rond\u00f4nia, Brasil \".
