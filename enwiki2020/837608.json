    "text": "Antoine Jean Baptiste Robert Auget, Baron de Montyon (23 December 173329 December 1820) was a French philanthropist, born in Paris. ==Biography== His father was a ma\u00eetre des comptes; he was educated in law, and became a lawyer at the Ch\u00e2telet in 1755, ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates to the Conseil d'\u00c9tat in 1760, and intendant successively of Auvergne, Provence and La Rochelle. He had repeatedly shown great independence of character, protesting against the accusation of Louis-Ren\u00e9 de Caradeuc de La Chalotais in 1766, and refusing in 1771 to suppress the local courts of justice in obedience to Maupeou. He was made a councillor of state in 1775 by the influence of Louis de Bourbon, duke of Penthi\u00e8vre, and in 1780 he was attached to the court in the honorary office of chancellor to the comte d'Artois (afterwards Charles X). He followed the princes into exile, and lived for some years in London. During the emigration period he spent large sums on the alleviation of the poverty of his fellow immigrants, returning to France only at the second restoration.

Guimbaud, Auget de Montyon (1909) Between 1780 and 1787 he had founded a series of prizes, the awards to be made by the French academy and the academies of science and medicine. These prizes fell into abeyance during the revolutionary period, but were re-established in 1815. In 1812 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. When Montyon died, he bequeathed 12,000 francs for the perpetual endowment of each of the following prizes: for the discovery of the means of rendering some mechanical process less dangerous to the workman; for the perfecting of any technical improvement in a mechanical process; for the book which during the year rendered the greatest service to humanity; the \"prix de vertu\" for the most courageous act on the part of a poor Frenchman; the awards being left as before to the learned academies. He also left 12,000 francs to each of the Parisian hospitals. Montyon wrote a series of works, chiefly on political economy: * \u00c9loge de Michel de l'h\u00f4pital (Paris, 1777) * Recherches et consid\u00e9rations sur la population de la France (1778), a share of which is attributed to his secretary, Moheau * Rapport fait \u00e0 Louis XVIII (Constance, 1796), in which he maintained in opposition to Calonne's Tableau de l'Europe that France had always possessed a constitution, which had, however, been violated by the kings of France * L'\u00e9tat statistique du Tunkin (1811) ; and Particularit\u00e9s... sur les ministres des finances en France (1812). ==Notes== ==References== * Catholic Encyclopedia article Category:1733 births Category:1820 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:French politicians Category:French philanthropists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ",
