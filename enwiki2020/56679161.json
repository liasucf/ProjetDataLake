The Rams were led by Mike Rhoades in his second season as head coach at VCU. The Rams played their home games at Stuart C. Siegel Center in Richmond, Virginia as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Rams surpassing preseason conference polling, won the Atlantic 10 regular season, posting a 25\u20138 record and earning an at-large bid into the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. There they lost to UCF in the opening round of the tournament. == Background == The previous season was Mike Rhoades' first season as head coach. The Rams finished the 2017\u201318 season 18\u201315, 9\u20139 in A-10 play to finish tied for fifth place. VCU defeated Dayton in the A-10 Tournament to advance to the quarterfinals, where they lost to Rhode Island. The Rams, for the first time since 2010 failed to earn an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament or NIT. The Rams had been invited to play in the CBI and CIT tournaments, but declined. It was the first time since 2006 the Rams failed to have a 20-win season, and the first time since that same year the Rams did not play in a postseason tournament. == Offseason == === Departures === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !
