    "text": "Zhiyi (; 538\u2013597 CE) also Chen De'an (\u9648\u5fb7\u5b89), is the founder of the Tiantai tradition of Buddhism in China. His standard title was \u015arama\u1e47a Zhiyi (\u6c99\u9580\u667a\u9857), linking him to the broad tradition of Indian asceticism. Zhiyi is famous for being the first in the history of Chinese Buddhism to elaborate a complete, critical and systematic classification of the Buddhist teachings. He is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system. ==Biography== Born with the surname Chen () in Huarong District, Jing Prefecture (now Hubei), Zhiyi left home to become a monk at eighteen, after the loss of his parents and his hometown Jiangling that fell to the Western Wei army when Zhiyi was seventeen. At 23, he received his most important influences from his first teacher, Nanyue Huisi (515-577 CE), a meditation master who would later be listed as Zhiyi's predecessor in the Tiantai lineage. After a period of study with Huisi (560-567), he spent some time working in the southern capital of Jiankang. Then in 575 he went to Tiantai mountain for intensive study and practice with a group of disciples. Here he worked on adapting the Indian meditation principles of \u015bamatha and vipa\u015byan\u0101 (translated as \"zhi\" and \"guan\") into a complex system of self-cultivation practice that also incorporated devotional rituals and confession/repentance rites. Then in 585 he returned to Jinling, where he completed his monumental commentarial works on the Lotus Sutra, the Fahua wenzhu (587 CE), and the Fahua xuanyi (593 CE). Chappell holds that Zhiyi: \"...provided a religious framework which seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism.\"Chappell, David W. (1987).

Of the works attributed to him (although many may have been written by his disciples), about thirty are extant. == View on \u015bamatha- vipa\u015byan\u0101 == Zhiyi's Hsiao chih-kuan () offers an exposition of the practice of \u015bamatha (calming or cessation) and vipa\u015byan\u0101 (wise seeing or contemplation). Zhiyi's Hsiao chih-kuan states:Swanson, Paul L. (2002) Ch\u2019an and Chih-kuan T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai Chih-i\u2019s View of \u201cZen\u201d and the Practice of the Lotus Sutra, Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. > There are many ways to enter the true reality of nirvana, but none that is > more essential or that goes beyond the twofold method of cessation-and- > contemplation. The reason is that \u201ccessation\u201d is the preliminary gate for > overcoming the bonds [of passionate afflictions]; \u201ccontemplation\u201d is the > proper requisite for severing delusions. \u201cCessation\u201d provides good > nourishment for nurturing the mind; \u201ccontemplation\u201d is the sublime technique > for arousing spiritual understanding. \u201cCessation\u201d is the preeminent cause > for [attaining] dhyanic concentration; \u201ccontemplation\u201d is the basis [for the > accumulation of] of wisdom. If one perfects the twofold aspects of > concentration (samadhi) and wisdom, then one is fully endowed with the > aspects of both benefiting oneself and benefiting others. Zhiyi also notes that its necessary to have a balance between \u015bamatha and vipa\u015byan\u0101: > It should be known that these two aspects are like the two wheels of a cart, > or the two wings of a bird; if one side is cultivated disproportionately, > then one falls prey to mistaken excess. ==Four Samadhis== Zhiyi developed a curriculum of practice which was distilled into the 'Four Samadhis' (Chinese: \u56db\u7a2e\u4e09\u6627;Swanson, Paul L.

Swanson states that Zhiyi in the Mohe Zhiguan: > ...is critical of an unbalanced emphasis on \u201cmeditation alone,\u201d portraying > it as a possible \u201cextreme\u201d view and practice, and offering instead the > binome zhi-guan \u6b62\u89c0 (calming/cessation and insight/contemplation, \u015bamatha- > vipa\u015byan\u0101) as a more comprehensive term for Buddhist practice.Swanson, Paul > L.

One is to contemplate them as \"not moving, not originated, not extinguished, not coming, not going.\u201d ==The Five Periods and Eight Teachings of the Buddha== In order to provide a comprehensive framework for Buddhist doctrine, Zhiyi classified the various Buddhist sutras into the Five Periods and Eight Teachings (). These were also known as goji hakky\u014d in Japanese and osi palgyo (\uc624\uc2dc\ud314\uad50) in Korean. According to Zhiyi, the five periods of the Buddha's teachings were as follows:The five periods were based on quotations from various sutras. cf # The Flower Garland period \u2013 taught immediately after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, lasting 3 weeks. The teachings at this time were incomprehensible to all but advanced bodhisattvas, and thus Shakyamuni Buddha started over with more basic (the Agama) teachings. # The Agama Period \u2013 taught at Deer Park, and lasting 12 years. These consisted of the most elementary teachings of the Buddha including karma, rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, etc. # The Correct and Equal Period \u2013 lasting 8 years. This marks the Buddha's teachings that begin to transition from so-called \"Hinayana\" teachings to Mahayana ones. # The Wisdom Period \u2013 lasting 22 years. The teachings here consist of the Perfection of Wisdom teachings among others. Here, the teachings were intended to demonstrate that the classifications of Hinayana and Mahayana were expedient only, and that were ultimately empty. # The Lotus and Nirvana Period \u2013 lasting 8 years. The teachings of this final period mark the most \"perfect\" teachings, namely the Lotus Sutra and the Mahayana Nirvana Sutra, which encompass the Buddha's original intention. These were compared in order to the five stages of milk: fresh milk, cream, curds, butter and ghee (clarified butter). Further. the teachings of the Buddha were organized into four types based on the capacity of listener: * Sudden teachings * Gradual teachings * Indeterminate teachings * Secret or \"esoteric\" teachings. and four types of sources: * Hinayana * Mahayana * Teachings found in both * Teachings that transcend both (e.g. Lotus Sutra) Together these were the Eight Teachings of the Buddha attributed to Zhiyi. ==Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life== Zhiyi taught the principle of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment () in his 'Great Concentration and Insight', based on the Lotus Sutra. The number 'Three Thousand' is derived from the Ten Worlds, multiplied by ten [because of the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds], which gives 100, multiplied by ten [the Ten Factors listed in Ch. 2 of the Lotus Sutra which gives 1,000. 1,000 multiplied by 3 [the Three Realms of Existence: Self, Other, and Environment] which gives 3,000.Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, \"Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life\" Volume 5 of Great Concentration and Insight states: ==See also== *Guoqing Temple *Zhou Jichang ==Notes== ==Works== * Dharmamitra (trans.): The Essentials of Buddhist Meditation by Shramana Zhiyi, Kalavinka Press 2008, * Donner, Neal & Daniel B.
