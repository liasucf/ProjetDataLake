    "text": "The Postmodern Reformation is a movement presently taking place throughout Western culture in which Christianity is experiencing a dramatic cultural shift away from institutionally centralized Christian practice closely related to primary Christendom values which have undergirded Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant culture since the 4th century. The movement parallels a number of other characteristic aspects of postmodernity including the adoption of primary extrainstitutional loyalties, a decentralized philosophy of cultural influence emphasizing authentic relationships, personal opportunity and responsibility for global and local contexts, and the localization of lifestyle. It also emphasizes a return to the values of 1st century Christian lifestyle using the tools of 21st century living. ==See also== *Emergent church *Postchristianity ==Further reading== *Raschke, Carl A. \"The Next Reformation.\" Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House, 2004. *Barna, George. \"Revolution.\" Carol Stream, IL: Tyndale House, 2005.
