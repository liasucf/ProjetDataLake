    "text": "The North York Rangers were a junior ice hockey team. They originated in 1967, when the Woodbridge Rangers of the Metro Junior B League moved to North York. The team operated out of the Metro League until the Ontario Junior Hockey League was founded in 1972, at which point the Rangers and four other Metro teams moved to the new league. The Rangers made it to the Royal Bank Cup in 1980 and 1983. In 1984, the team was renamed the North York Red Wings and folded after one season. ==Season-by-season results== ===Regular season=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" ! Season !! GP !! W !!
