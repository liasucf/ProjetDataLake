The director of Catching Fire, Francis Lawrence, stated of Claflin's performance during filming: \"Finnick's an interesting character. At first he feels like a bit of a flirt and there's a little bit of sexual tension, but really you kind of fall in love with the guy and you see that there's a real deep emotional side to him. It's one of the reasons I really hired him in the first place was that it's where his character goes in the next couple of stories and I just think he did a fantastic job.\" The film was released in November 2013 to general acclaim and Claflin's portrayal of Finnick received positive reviews.

In 2016, Claflin reprised his role as William, Snow White's childhood friend, in several scenes of the sequel The Huntsman: Winter's War. The same year, he starred in Me Before You, the film adaptation of the novel of the same name, in which he played William Traynor.

Your mum knows like everything.\" Claflin states that, after he first met her, he called his agent to exclaim that he had just met the woman he wanted to marry.
