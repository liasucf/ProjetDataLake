    "text": "The Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club is a sports and social club located on Campo Alegre in Porto, Portugal. Principally aimed at, and founded by, ex-pats in Porto, the club has a long history going back to 1855, the grounds at that time being situated at Candal in Vila Nova de Gaia. In 1923 the present grounds were acquired. Many sports including cricket, tennis, football and squash are played at the club and there is a healthy rivalry between the Porto club and ex-pats in Lisbon. Also cricket teams visit from the UK regularly during the spring and summer. ==External links== *OCLTC website Category:Sports venues in Porto Category:1855 establishments in Portugal Category:Sports clubs established in 1855 ",
