He founded the Greek Jewelers' Association and exhibited his first collection, the Archaeological Collection, at the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957. It was inspired by Classical, Hellenistic and Minoan Mycenaean art. In 1969 he started his own firm, Greek Gold - Ilias Lalaounis S.A.. ===1969-1970s=== Lalaounis provoked a sensation with his collection Blow Up (1970), draping the human body in gold jewelry inspired by Minoan civilization.Culturebox (avec.

The following year he organized an international exhibition of jewelry in Athens, joined by Van Cleef, Bulgari, Rene Kern and Harry Winston. In 1976, he had one of his most important commissions which would prove to be one of the most inspiring for his portfolio.

MODIANO Special to The New York Times. \u201cJewelry Made From the Doodles of Princes.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 4 Aug. 1973, www.nytimes.com/1973/08/04/archives/jewelry- made-from-the-doodles-of-princes-heard-of-display-fish.html. Between 1970 and 1978 Ilias Lalaounis opened stores in most European countries. He opened his first international store in Paris at 364 rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, near Place Vend\u00f4me and produced a short film explaining the sources of inspiration for the jewels on display. Since then, he regularly produced short films to illustrate his collections, such as: Aube of Art, Byzantine Arcs in Gold, Choreography, The Shield of Achilles, Ilion - The Treasure of Troy, Art and Gold, The Common Roots of the Creator Man, Treasures of the Holy Land. In 1979, Lalaounis opened a store in New York on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. A year later, the Smithsonian Institution invited him to give a lecture on his art and to exhibit his collection The Achilles Shield at the National Museum of American History. ===1980s\u20131990s=== Ilias Lalaounis continued to create innovative collections and expand the brand to international markets during the 1980s. On the inauguration of the Lalaounis store in Tokyo, he created a jewelry collection inspired by Japanese art. The same year, he opened a store in Hong Kong where he presented a collection of jewels inspired by the drawings of the Greek geometric period, very similar to the geometric designs of Chinese art. A second store was opened in Hong Kong in 1982. Lalaounis exhibited his Helen of Troy collection at the Penn Museum in Philadelphia as well as in Houston, Texas, where he was made an honorary citizen by the mayor. In 1984, he published Metamorphoses, a book in which he presented nineteen of his collections by analyzing his philosophy on the nature and function of jewelry. The jewel, for Ilias Lalaounis, is not a simple decorative object, rather it carries a message, is an expression of inner life, a link with the distant past, a symbol and a memory. He received the Thorlet Award (Prix Thorlet) for the book from the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. Subsequently, a retrospective exhibition of his creations was presented in the Sorbonne Chapel. For his contribution to the arts, Lalaounis was made Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters (Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et Lettres) by the French government and Commander of the Order of Academic Palms (Commandeur des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques).
