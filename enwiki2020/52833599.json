    "text": "James Wallace Dean, known as Jay Dean (born March 5, 1953), is a business owner and Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 7, which encompasses both Gregg County and Upshur County in East Texas. ==Political background== Prior to his election to the legislature, Dean served seven years as a city councilman and then ten years as the mayor of the city of Longview, Texas, ending his term on May 15, 2016. During his tenure, Longview was ranked as one of the top ten cities in the United States for economic growth and was named one of the \"best places for business\" by Forbes magazine. As mayor, Dean refused to sign a proclamation for LGBT \"pride.\" In 2014, the city of Longview broke a contract with singer Ted Nugent to perform at Longview's Fourth of July concert, with Mayor Dean stating that Nugent \"didn't really fit what we're trying to put together, a family oriented program.\" Following his service as mayor, Dean filed to run for state representative for House District 7, and campaigned for the Republican nomination on a platform of border security, job creation, and protecting East Texas water and other resources. He won the 2016 Republican primary election and was sworn into the State Legislature on January 10, 2017, succeeding Republican David Simpson, who did not seek reelection. Dean did not face a Democratic opponent in the general election held on November 8, 2016. == 85th Legislature == In his inaugural legislative session, Dean filed ten pieces of legislation. All but three were signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott under Dean's authorship or sponsorship. Dean earned public praise for two bills in particular: House Bill 2671, which penalizes the use and proliferation of new synthetic opioids and narcotics; and HB 2837, which strengthens the administrative impetus to remove deceased voters from the voter rolls. Dean was selected to serve on the Local and Consent Calendar Committee, the Committee on Investments and Financial Services, and the influential Appropriations Committee, responsible for crafting the state's budget. During the interim, Dean was appointed to serve on the House Select Committee on Opioids and Substance Abuse, created to help combat the opioid epidemic in Texas. ==Political views== According to his website, Dean shares \"East Texas conservative values\" and promises to \"honor the constitution, protect our gun rights, and make sure we secure the border.\" Elsewhere on the site, Dean states that he is \"deeply opposed to the practice of abortion.\" He has a perfect rating from the NRA, and was endorsed in his legislative campaign by Governor Greg Abbott, Texas State Rifle Association, Texas Alliance for Life, National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the Texas Association of Realtors. He was recognized by the Conservative Roundtable of Texas for voting in support of \"reasonable and limited regulations, adequate and reliable infrastructure, an educated and healthy workforce, low taxation, and efficient government.\" Dean ran without opposition for his second House term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. ==Personal== Dean was born in Opelousas, Louisiana, and attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, from which he earned a bachelor's degree. He and his wife, Jane \"Pokie\" Willis Dean, moved to Longview in 1981, where they raised their three daughters. A former altar boy, Dean is active in the Roman Catholic Church and helped to found St. Matthews in Longview. == References == ==External links== * Campaign website * State legislative page * Jay Dean at the Texas Tribune Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Texas city council members Category:Mayors of places in Texas Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:People from Opelousas, Louisiana Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Catholics from Texas ",
