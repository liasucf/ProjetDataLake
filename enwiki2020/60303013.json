In addition, neither of them have heard from Ava who seems to be missing. It is later ruled that Nolan's death was a murder not a suicide. Mona feels responsible for Nolan's death and begins putting the pieces together. Alison has her own problems when she supposedly receives a text from Nolan. Caitlin and Dylan find Ava in her room and the two convince her that they all need to stick together. At Nolan's funeral Mona tells Alison that there was a partial Beacon Guard blackout in cell service and that would explain the delayed text from Nolan. Following the funeral Caitlin, Dylan, and Ava run into Dana Booker, a former FBI agent now head of security at BHU, who assures them that she will find the person responsible for Nolan's murder. Alison begins suspecting that someone is trying to frame her for Nolan's murder. Caitlin and Dylan look for Nolan's secret stash to find things before his belongings are searched. Caitlin gets sidetracked in the process by former boyfriend Mason but Dylan continues on. In the campus greenhouse Dylan finds a note which leads him to believe that someone beat them to Nolan's stash. Caitlin, Dylan, and Ava meet in the woods again and find evidence that they weren't alone the night they were out there. Alison meets with Dana who requests to read the essays she assigned over the topic \"Can murder be justified?\" just before Nolan's death. Alison returns home and is spooked by Claire who was waiting inside. Mona calls Hanna Marin who informs her that Spencer and Toby have eloped since Mona left Rosewood.
