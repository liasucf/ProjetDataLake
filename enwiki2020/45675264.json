The group was formed in 2012 by the members themselves, after their previous groups Mini Viva and Duchess had disbanded. Starting out on independent label Operator Records, they have been signed to Polydor Records since early 2016. ==Career== ===Beginnings=== Frankee Connolly was a part of Mini Viva until the duo's split in 2010, where as Nadine Samuels and Annie Ashcroft were both members of the girl group Duchess until 2012. M.O was formed in late 2012, after Connolly had met Samuels and Ashcroft at music industry events. M.O stands for Modus Operandi, which is a Latin term for \"a particular way to do something\" M.O's initial aim was to bring old school 90s music back, naming old school TLC, J.Lo, Aaliyah and, All Saints as an inspiration amongst others. M.O made their debut as a band with a remix of Brandy and Monica's \"The Boy Is Mine\" on the YouTube channel SB.TV in 2012. At this point they received positive feedback from the music industry and were championed by the likes of Ed Sheeran. They followed up their debut on YouTube with their first promotional single \"Wait Your Turn\", which was followed by other releases in 2013, including \"Ain\u2019t Got Time\" and \"Hot\". In early 2014, M.O announced that the Jess Glynne-penned track \"For a Minute\" would be released as their official debut single. It was released in April 2014 and entered the UK Indie Charts at number 6. In May, the group joined Little Mix as the main support act on their sold out Salute Tour, and performed at numerous festivals in the UK, including Wireless festival. In August, they released their garage-influenced second single \"Dance on My Own\", which entered the UK Sales Chart at number 49. Also in 2014, the group was nominated for a MOBO Award in the Best Newcomer category. In 2015, the single \"Preach\", which was co-written by Starsmith and Joel Compass, was released. The same year, they signed a record deal with Polydor Records and released the promotional single \"Love the Most\", a collaboration with The HeavyTrackerz. In 2016, M.O released the extended plays Good Friends and Who Do You Think Of?, the latter of which spawned a single of the same name. \"Who Do You Think Of?\" reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart, becoming their highest- charting single yet. The song was certified silver and sold over 375,000 copies. In July 2016, it was announced that the band signed a US deal with Interscope Records. Their next single, \"Not in Love\", featured rapper Kent Jones and was released in December 2016, peaking just outside the Top 40 at #42. ===Line-up changes=== After a quiet 18 months, including the departure of Connolly, the group made a comeback with their new single \"Bad Vibe\", featuring Lotto Boyzz and Mr Eazi. It peaked at number 18 on the UK Official Singles Chart. On 26 November 2018, Nadine Samuels was imprisoned for eight months for causing death by careless driving. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Good Friends | * Released: 9 February 2016 * Label: Polydor * Format: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| Who Do You Think Of? | * Released: 2 August 2016 * Label: Polydor * Format: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| Modus Operandi | * Released: 26 June 2020 * Label: Universal * Format: Digital download |} ===Singles=== ====As lead artists==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title !scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year !scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions !rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications (sales thresholds) !scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album |- ! style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\"| UK ! style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\"| UK Indie Peak positions for single on the UK Indie Chart: * For \"For a Minute\": * For \"Dance On My Own\": * For \"Preach\": ! style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\"| IRE |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"For a Minute\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2014 | 103 || 6 || \u2014 | | rowspan=\"3\" |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Dance On My Own\" | 49 || 4 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Preach\" | 2015 | 51 || 4 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Who Do You Think Of?\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2016 | 18 || \u2014 || 56 | * BPI: Gold |Who Do You Think Of? |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Not in Love\" (featuring Kent Jones) | 42 || \u2014 || 75 | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Bad Vibe\" (with Lotto Boyzz and Mr Eazi) | rowspan=\"2\" | 2018 | 18 || \u2014 || 31 | *BPI: Platinum | rowspan=\"5\"| Modus Operandi |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Wondering\" (with Chip) | 91 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Choose Sides\" (featuring AJ Tracey) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Ex at the Party\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Going Out of My Way\" (with Mr Eazi) | 2020 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- | colspan=\"19\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:85%;\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released. |} ====As featured artists==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title !scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year !scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions |- ! style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%\"| UK ! style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\"| UK Indie ! style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%\"| IRE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Running\" (USG featuring M.O) | 2014 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"With You\" (DUSK featuring M.O) | rowspan=\"4\"| 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Family Tree\" (Remix) (Ramz featuring M.O) | 35 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Feelings (Wifey)\" (Crazy Cousinz featuring Yungen and M.O) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Pon Me\" (Abra Cadabra featuring Sneakbo and M.O) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- | colspan=\"20\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%;\"| \"\u2014\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released. |} ====Promotional singles==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:13em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Wait Your Turn\" | 2012 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"On and On\" | rowspan=\"5\"| 2013 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ain't Got Time\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Come Let Me Show You\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Hot\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"On Ya\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Love the Most\" | 2015 |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
