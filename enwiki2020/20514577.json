    "text": "The Lost Album is the fifth and final album by the British neo soul composer and multi-instrumentalist Lewis Taylor, which was released in 2004. Taylor recorded this album in the late 1990s, in reaction to British press naming him \"new British blue-eyed soulster\". He intended it to be released as a follow-up to his 1996 self-titled debut, but Island Records rejected it, after which he returned with the album Lewis II. The Lost Album was finally released in 2004, through Taylor's own label, Slow Reality. ==Track listing== #Lost (Sabina Smyth) - 1:33 #Listen Here (Smyth, Taylor) - 4:18 #Hide Your Heart Away (Taylor) - 4:53 #Send Me an Angel (Smyth, Taylor) - 4:48 #The Leader of the Band (Taylor) - 4:29 #Yeah (Smyth, Taylor) - 4:46 #Please Help Me If You Can (Taylor) - 4:21 #Let's Hope Nobody Finds Us (Smyth, Taylor) - 4:43 #New Morning (Smyth, Taylor) - 5:45 #Say I Love You (Taylor) - 4:43 #See My Way (Taylor) - 4:02 #One More Mystery (Taylor) - 4:49 ==References== Category:2005 albums Category:Lewis Taylor albums ",
