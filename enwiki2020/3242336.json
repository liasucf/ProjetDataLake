    "text": "Winners of the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year Award, first awarded in 1952. No official award was given from 1911\u20131951, even though at least one rookie starter has been present in every running of the Indianapolis 500. The award is voted on by a panel of judges, which is composed of selected members of the media, historians, and a handful of other experts. The voting takes place the night of the race (or the morning after), and does not necessarily go to the highest-finishing rookie. Noteworthy accomplishments during qualifying, regardless of the respective race result, have frequently been a factor in voting. A rookie who competitively runs up front during the race, passes many cars, and/or leads laps (but ultimately drops out) can also garner consideration over another rookie who finished higher, but did so merely by surviving attrition. Other contributing attributes can include personal attitude, sportsmanship, professionalism, and interaction with driver coaches, fans, and media. Years in which two drivers are listed indicate co-winners, due to a tie in the final voting. The Indianapolis 500 rookie of the year award has been sponsored by the following companies: *Stark & Wetzel meats (1952\u20131979) *JPMorgan Chase (1980\u20132013) (through different mergers) **American Fletcher National Bank (1980\u20131988) **Bank One (1989\u20132004) **Chase (2005\u20132013) *Sunoco (2014\u20132018) *Marathon Petroleum Speedway convenience stores (2019\u2013present) This award is separate from the annual rookie of the year award presented by IndyCar, as well as the Jim Trueman Award (rookie of the year) which was handed out by CART. The current award is $25,000 cash and a plaque. In the early years, when Stark & Wetzel sponsored the award, the prize package included $500 in cash, and a year's supply of meat. ==Definition of a \"Rookie\"== The term \"rookie\" (or newcomer) at the Indianapolis 500 can at times be misleading. According to race rules, a rookie is defined as any driver who has never qualified for the race and/or has never been on the track during the pace lap, and officially credited with a start. Several unique situations have created confusion, among the many include: *In 1911, the first Indianapolis 500, all 40 participants are considered rookies. However, at least 23 of the 40 starters had previously participated in early events at the Speedway in 1909 and 1910. Therefore, in the first 500, there were actually only seventeen complete newcomers to the Speedway. In addition, four other drivers who raced in the 500 in subsequent years, had previous experience at the Speedway in 1909 and 1910. Inaugural 500 winner Ray Harroun had actually won a total of 7 races at the IMS through 1909 and 1910, including the 200 mile Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race on Memorial Day Weekend in 1910. *In 1927, Louis Meyer did not qualify for the race, but served as a relief driver. He first qualified on his own in 1928, and was considered a rookie when he won that race. *Bill Puterbaugh had a notable streak of failing to qualify for the race six times from 1968\u20131974, before finally making the race for the first time in 1975. He was still scored a rookie for the 1975 race, and his 7th- place finish earned him the Rookie of the Year award. *\"Uncle\" Jacques Villeneuve qualified for the 1984 race, but crashed in practice. He was not cleared to drive, and was forced to withdraw, and not credited with a start. He returned in 1985, but a crash early in the month prevented him from making a qualifying attempt. In 1986, he qualified and started the race (his third year overall), where he was considered a rookie, and still eligible for the award (he did not win). Members of the media lightheartedly referred to him as \"the veteran rookie.\" *Affonso Giaffone was a rookie when he first qualified for the 1997 race. As the safety car entered pit lane to start the race, the entire Row 5 where he was starting was involved in an incident in Turn 4 headed to the start, and never saw the green flag to take the start. All three drivers were credited with 0 laps, having taken the track for the pace lap, but not having taken the start. Had he returned in a subsequent year, despite never actually starting the race, he would not have been considered a rookie again. The term \"rookie\" can also confuse spectators, as it suggests a young, inexperienced competitor. In reality, it can be a mis-nomer, since several experienced champions of other forms of motorsports have come to Indy and been ruled a rookie because of their first start in the 500 only. Formula One and Monster Energy NASCAR Cup champions were still scored as \"rookies\" in their first starts. *Graham Hill was considered a rookie winner when he won in his first start (1966). However, Hill had already won the 1962 World Championship going into the race. *In 1993, reigning Formula 1 World Champion Nigel Mansell left the international series to sign with the Newman-Haas race team for the entire CART season and the Indy 500. He contended for the win late in the race before finishing 3rd, and earned Rookie of the Year honors as perhaps the highest-profile \"rookie\" in the race's history. *In 2012, longtime Formula One veterans Rubens Barrichello and Jean Alesi were by rule, considered race \"rookies.\" Barrichello won the Rookie of the Year award. *In the wake of the CART/IRL split in 1996, several drivers who first arrived at Indy in the early 2000s had been experienced fixtures of the CART circuit. Juan Pablo Montoya was the 1999 CART champion, but when he raced at Indy for the first time and won in 2000, he was still considered by definition, a \"rookie.\" A similar situation occurred for H\u00e9lio Castroneves a year later. After experience in three seasons in the CART series, Castroneves attempted Indy for the first time in 2001. He won the 2001 race, also scored as a rookie. He would go on to win the 2002 race also, becoming the first driver to win the race in his first two starts. *After the Open-wheel unification in 2008, several former Champ Car drivers arrived at Indy for the first time. All were scored as rookies, despite several having multiple years of experience in major-league Open-wheel racing. *Despite his status as the 2007 INDYCAR Rookie of the Year, Ryan Hunter-Reay was declared a 2008 Indianapolis 500 rookie, because he had not started the race during his rookie season. *In the 2014 race, 2004 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion Kurt Busch was, by rule, considered a rookie. *The 2017 rookie of the year, Fernando Alonso was already a 2 time Formula One World Champion when he won the award. *2019 NTT IndyCar Series rookie driver Patricio O'Ward failed to qualify for the 2019 race and is signed with McLaren Schmidt-Peterson for the 2020 NTT IndyCar Series season. He will be declared a race rookie for the 2020 race, must take the entire rookie test, and be eligible for the award. ==Rookie of the Year award winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Year ! Driver !

Daywalt went the entire 500 miles without relief help, and finished 6th. He was the highest finishing rookie, about two minutes ahead of Ernie McCoy. |- |1954||nowrap| Larry Crockett||align=center|25||139.557||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|9||Crockett was the only rookie (out of 6) to go the full 500 miles, doing so without relief help. |- |1955||nowrap| Al Herman||align=center|16||139.811||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|7||Only 2 of 8 rookies were running at the finish.

Edmunds spun out after completing 170 laps. Fellow rookie Eddie Sachs qualified for the middle of the front row, but dropped out with a fuel leak on lap 105. |- |1958||nowrap| George Amick||align=center|25||142.710||style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\" align=center|2||Amick led three times for 18 laps, and was the highest finishing rookie since the Rookie of the Year award started being given. |- |1959 ||nowrap| Bobby Grim||align=center|5||144.225||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|26||Grim qualified 5th and won rookie of the year despite dropping out before the halfway point. Three others finished ahead of him. |- |1960 ||nowrap| Jim Hurtubise||align=center|23||149.056||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|18||Hurtubise was the fastest overall qualifier in the field. On the second weekend of time trials, he set a four-lap track record at 149.056 mph. |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1961||nowrap| Bobby Marshman||align=center|33||144.293 ||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center| 7||rowspan=2|Jones led two times for 27 laps. However, Marshman charged from last starting position to finish 7th, and for the first time, \"co-winners\" were awarded. |- |nowrap| Parnelli Jones||align=center|5||146.080||style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\" align=center|12 |- |1962||nowrap| Jim McElreath||align=center|7||149.025||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|6||Five rookies made the field, with McElreath starting 7th and finishing 6th, the best of all five. None of the other four rookies made it beyond the halfway point.

Four were running at the finish, with White finishing 4th, and the only one to complete the full 200 laps. Rookie Dave MacDonald was fatally injured in the major crash with Eddie Sachs on lap 2, and fellow rookie Ronnie Duman became caught up in the accident as well. |- |1965||nowrap| Mario Andretti||align=center|4||158.849||style=\"background:#FFDF9F;\" align=center|3||Andretti briefly sat on the pole position with a new track record qualifying speed at the time. Eventually his time was bested, and he started 4th on race day. |- |1966||nowrap| Jackie Stewart||align=center|11||159.972||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|6||Stewart led 40 laps during the race, and had a lap lead on the field late in the race. On the 191st lap, he slowed due to low oil pressure, and parked the car. That handed the lead over to another rookie, Graham Hill, who led the final nine laps en route to victory. Even though Hill won the race as a rookie starter, Stewart's performance earned him enough votes to win the rookie of the year award. |- |1967||nowrap| Denis Hulme||align=center|24||163.376||style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\" align=center|4||Two rookies were running at the finish, with Hulme charging from 24th starting position to finish 4th.

Voters took into account the fact that Donohue (who started 4th) had to make a lengthy pit stop early on, but his race pace was much faster. Revson, who started last, lost a cylinder, and due to the high attrition rate, was able to cruise around to a largely uncontested 5th-place finish.The Talk of Gasoline Alley \u2013 WFNI, May 23, 2013 |- |1970||nowrap| Donnie Allison||align=center|23||165.662||style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\" align=center|4||Three of the four rookies were running at the end, with Donnie Allison (a NASCAR regular) charging from 23rd starting position to an impressive 4th-place finish. |- |1971||nowrap| Denny Zimmerman||align=center|28||169.755||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|8||Zimmerman was the only rookie (out of 4) running at the finish. |- |1972||nowrap| Mike Hiss||align=center|25||179.015||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|7||Out of 8 rookies, Sam Posey qualified 7th and finished 5th with 198 laps. But Hiss charged from 26th to 7th, completing 196 laps. |- |1973||nowrap| Graham McRae||align=center|13||192.031||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|16||Three rookies made the field, with Bobby Allison the qualifying fastest (12th); but McRae was only one position slower than Allison (13th). Allison completed only one lap, while McRae was credited with 92 laps before dropping out with a broken header, but was by far the highest finishing rookie. Jerry Karl completed only 22 laps, but was still officially running at the finish, as his team made lengthy repairs to a mechanical issue. |- |1974||nowrap| Pancho Carter||align=center|21||180.605||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|7||Only two rookies were running at the finish. Carter was 9 laps down in 7th, while Tom Bigelow finished 12th completing 166 laps. On lap 141, Carter spun in turn one and nearly took out race leader Johnny Rutherford. No cars made contact, and Carter continued undamaged. |- |1975||nowrap| Bill Puterbaugh||align=center|15||183.833||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|7||Puterbaugh was the fastest rookie qualifier, and had tried for seven years to make the field. |- |1976||nowrap| Vern Schuppan||align=center|17||182.011||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|18||Out of only four rookies, Schuppan started furthest up on the grid and finished the highest.

Rice charged from 30th starting position to finish 11th. Initial voting ended in a tie. At the victory banquet, it was discovered that two of the voters had split their votes. They could not decide whom to vote for, and put both Rice and Mears on their respective ballots. Officials requested that those two voters re-vote, and they both agreed. One voted for Rice, and the other voted for Mears, and a tie still prevailed. Officials decided to award co-winners. |- |nowrap| Rick Mears||style=\"background:#FFDF9F;\" align=center|3||200.078||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|23 |- |1979||nowrap| Howdy Holmes||align=center|13||185.864||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|7||Holmes was the only rookie that qualified for the field. Seven rookies entered the month and took rookie tests, and a total of four made qualifying attempts. Dana Carter was bumped; while the qualifying attempts of Dick Ferguson and Bill Alsup were disallowed due to rules infractions. That left Holmes the lone rookie, despite a special qualifying session the day before the race which gave participants one extra chance to make the field. |- |1980||nowrap| Tim Richmond||align=center|19||188.334||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|9||Richmond, the fastest rookie qualifier, led one lap during the race. Richmond set the fastest practice lap of the month (193.507 mph), but a crash on pole day morning prevented him from qualifying during the pole round. Richmond ran out of fuel at the head of the mainstretch at the finish, and was credited with 9th position. Race winner Johnny Rutherford famously gave Richmond a ride back to the pit area. Richmond bested nine other rookies in the field \u2013 with three others finishing 10th, 11th, and 13th, respectively. |- |1981||nowrap| Josele Garza||align=center|6||195.101||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|23||Garza led two times for 13 laps before crashing out of the race. |- |1982||nowrap| Jim Hickman||align=center|24||196.217||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|7||Hickman was the highest finishing rookie at the finish. He died at Milwaukee about two months later. |- |1983||nowrap| Teo Fabi||style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\" align=center|1||207.395||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|26||Fabi became the first rookie to win the pole position since the Rookie of the Year award had been given.

Barbazza's day was not without incident, as he did a complete spin in the second half of the race, avoiding contact with the wall. |- |1988||nowrap| Bill Vukovich III||align=center|23||208.545||style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\" align=center|14||Vukovich, the first third-generation starter, was the second- fastest rookie qualifier, and the only rookie (of 5) still running at the finish (albeit 21 laps down). |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 1989 ||nowrap| Bernard Jourdain||align=center|20||213.105||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center| 9||rowspan=2|Jourdain and Pruett had nearly identical months of May in terms of performance. They qualified close together, raced near each other all day, and finished together. |- |nowrap| Scott Pruett||align=center|17||213.995||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|10 |- |1990||nowrap| Eddie Cheever||align=center|14||217.926||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|8||Two out of the three rookies in the race were running at the finish, with Cheever qualifying fastest and finishing the highest. |- | 1991||nowrap| Jeff Andretti||align=center|11||217.632||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|15||Only one rookie was running at the finish, Hiro Matsushita, however, after repairs, he was running 51 laps behind. Jeff Andretti dropped out of the race, but was actually scored one place higher than Matsushita. Andretti had actually attempted to qualify for the race in 1990, but was bumped. Therefore, 1991 was his second overall attempt. |- |1992||nowrap| Lyn St. James||align=center|27||220.150||style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\" align=center|11||St. James was the first female rookie of the year, and the only rookie out of six still running at the finish. |- |1993||nowrap| Nigel Mansell||align=center|8||220.255||style=\"background:#FFDF9F;\" align=center|3||Mansell led three times for 34 laps, and was leading on a restart with 16 laps to go. He was passed on the restart, and fell to third, and despite brushing the wall a few laps later, held on to finish the race in third position. |- |1994||nowrap| Jacques Villeneuve||align=center|4||226.259||style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\" align=center|2||Villeneuve qualified as the fastest rookie, led the race two times for 7 laps, and was the only other entrant to finish on the lead lap. |- |1995||nowrap| Christian Fittipaldi||align=center|27||226.375||style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\" align=center|2||Fittipaldi finished second (the second year in a row a rookie finished 2nd).

Six days after pole day, Brayton was fatally injured during a practice crash. Brayton was replaced by driver Danny Ongais, and the car was required to start at the rear of the field. Stewart, who was second, was elevated to the pole position on race day. He led the first 31 laps of the race, and 44 overall before dropping out with engine trouble. |- |1997||nowrap| Jeff Ward||align=center|7||214.517||style=\"background:#FFDF9F;\" align=center|3||Ward led two times for 49 laps, and led as late as lap 192 before ducking into the pits for fuel, and finishing third. |- |1998||nowrap| Steve Knapp||align=center|23||216.445||style=\"background:#FFDF9F;\" align=center|3||Six out of the eight rookies were still running at the finish, with Knapp the lone rookie on the lead lap. |- |1999||nowrap| Robby McGehee||align=center|27||220.139||style=\"background:#DFFFDF;\" align=center|5||Only four rookies qualified, and two dropped out.

During her qualifying attempt, Patrick's car slipped in the first turn, and she settled for 4th starting position as the fastest rookie. Had she not slipped, she may have been fast enough to qualify for the pole position. On race day, she led three times for 19 laps. She was leading as late as 6 laps to go before finishing 4th. |- |2006||nowrap| Marco Andretti||align=center|9||224.918||style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\" align=center|2||Marco Andretti, the fastest rookie qualifier, was leading the race with one lap to go. He was passed by Sam Hornish, Jr. on the mainstrech on the final lap, about 450 feet from the finish line, in the second-closest finish in Indy 500 history. |- |2007||nowrap| Phil Giebler||align=center| 33 || 219.637||style=\"background:#EFCFFF;\" align=center|29||Only two rookies qualified, the fewest since 1979. Giebler was chosen as the best newcomer for the month, as the fastest rookie qualifier and highest finishing rookie. This despite crashing during his first qualifying attempt, and again during the race on lap 106 while running 19th. The other rookie, Milka Duno, wrecked earlier in the race. Giebler's 29th place finishing position is the lowest ever for a rookie of the year selection. |- |2008||nowrap| Ryan Hunter- Reay||align=center|20||221.579||style=\"background:#CFEAFF;\" align=center|6||Eleven rookies were part of the field, including several former Champ Car drivers following the open wheel unification. Hunter-Reay, the 2007 IndyCar Series rookie of the year, spent most of the day near the top ten, and was the highest running rookie at the finish, finishing one spot higher than the fastest rookie qualifier, Hideki Mutoh. Hunter-Reay was eligible for the award, despite being a second-year driver in the series, by virtue of the fact that he did not participate at Indy previously. |- |2009||nowrap| Alex Tagliani||align=center|33||221.115||style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\" align=center|11||Tagliani was bumped from the field in the final minutes of Bump Day. A day later, his teammate Bruno Junqueira was removed from his ride, and Tagliani replaced him behind the wheel. Rules forced the car to start from the rear of the field. On race day, Tagliani charged quickly up the standings, and by the midpoint, was running 11th. After running as high as 10th, Tagliani was the highest finishing rookie. There was some mild controversy about voting for Tagliani due to the fact that he did not qualify, but he won the award nonetheless, and became the first driver to win the award despite not qualifying for the race. |- |2010||nowrap| Simona de Silvestro||align=center|22||224.228||style=\"background:#CFCFFF;\" align=center|14||Six rookies qualified for the race, and four were running at the finish. Simona de Silvestro was one of two female rookies (Ana Beatriz was the other), and qualified in the top 24 cars on pole day. She officially finished one position lower than Mario Romancini, who was the fastest rookie qualifier (started 27th), and the highest finishing rookie (13th). de Silvestro became the third female to win the award. |- |2011||nowrap| J. R. Hildebrand||align=center|12||225.579||style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\" align=center|2||After fuel strategies shuffled the leaders in the waning laps, Hildebrand took the lead with three laps to go, and appeared to be on his way to victory.

It has been sponsored by the American Dairy Association Indiana Inc. since its inception. The award goes to the rookie who posts the fastest four- lap qualifying average during official time trials \u2013 regardless of overall starting position, and regardless of day in which the qualifying run was completed. The award is currently $5,000 cash and a plaque. It is presented at a luncheon a few days before the race. Each other rookie in the field receives $250. The names of the winners are affixed to a permanent trophy on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. Although rookies have qualified for every race dating back to 1911, this particular award has been officially recognized only since 1975. In 2009, the award celebrated its 35th consecutive year of continuous sponsorship by the American Dairy Association Indiana Inc..
