Commanded by General Hasso von Wedel, the department oversaw the numerous propaganda companies (Propagandakompanie or PK) of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, attached to the fighting troops. At its peak in 1942, the propaganda troops included 15,000 men. The propaganda companies were the only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and sent them to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination. Among the propaganda materials produced was the Wehrmachtbericht, the official news communiqu\u00e9 about the military situation of the Reich, and was intended for both domestic and foreign consumption. ==Publications== Propaganda publications in support of the war effort by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS included: *Die Deutsche Wochenschau \u2013 weekly newsreel series *Der Adler \u2013 biweekly magazine of the Luftwaffe, the air force *' \u2013 series of ' (pulp booklets), focusing on the Luftwaffe fighter force *' \u2013 propaganda series published under the auspices of Hermann G\u00f6ring, the head of the Luftwaffe ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Wehrmacht Category:Military history of Germany during World War II Category:Radio during World War II Category:Nazi propaganda organizations ",
