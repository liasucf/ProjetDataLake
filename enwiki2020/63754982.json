It was a mystery about his murder. There was a rumour that he knew the real culprits behind the murder of then politician Selvaraj Chettiar. Actually, it was told that he had an insurance policy for him. So, his family members gave a statement that he had died a natural death in order to get that money. After his death, his faction became weak, and even his siblings were also not able to continue in Yanam politics as he did. There was a street named Bezawada in Yanam. Even today, there is a portrait of Bezawada in the municipal hall at Yanam. ==Titles held== *Membre du Conseil Municipal de Yanaon *Membre du Conseil Local de Yanaon *Maire de Yanaon ==See also== *Telugu people *Yanam Municipality *Samatam Krouschnaya *Colonial History of Yanam *Bouloussou Soubramaniam Sastroulou *Municipal Administration in French India ==References== Category:French India Category:French Hindus Category:French murder victims Category:French people of Telugu descent Category:Indian murder victims Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Murdered politicians Category:Mayors of Yanam ",
