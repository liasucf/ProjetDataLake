In the individual races in Falun some non-World Cup racers participated. In the 20 km individual Andrei Zenkov and \u00d8ivind Nerhagen, among others, were non-World Cup racers, and so for World Cup purposes Arto J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen came 7th, and Rolf Storsveen and Kjell S\u00f8bak finished 9th and 10th respectively and received the appropriate World Cup points. In the 10 km sprint, one of the non-World Cup racers was Sergei Bulygin, and so he did not receive any World Cup points, and for World Cup purposes Algimantas \u0160alna won that race and received the appropriate World Cup points. Also in the European Cup races there were some non-European Cup racers participating, among those were Anita Nyg\u00e5rd who finished 10th in the 5 km sprint. For European Cup purposes though, Siv Br\u00e5ten finished 10th and received the appropriate points. :2. The Aftenposten source says that the relay teams received a very unusual amount of penalty loops, with 12, 13, 21, 20, 25 and 25 penalty loops respectively for the first six teams. However, in the same paper, it says that the two Norwegian teams got 14 penalty loops combined, which does not add up with it saying that the \"Norway I\" team got 25 penalties. So those high numbers probably refers to the number of missed shots. :3. In the individual races here some non-World Cup racers participated. Among those was Gisle Fenne, he was not a World Cup racer and so did not receive any World Cup points, and for World Cup purposes Risto Punkka came fifth and received the appropriate World Cup points. :4. The Sports Book does originally have different order of the finishers in this 10 km race with B. Mestad, Mikkola and Schill coming 8th, 9th and 10th, respectively. However it later contradicts itself by giving the points of those positions to Gr\u00f8nlid, B. Mestad and Anne-L. Engstr\u00f8m instead. Because that table shows how each racers score adds up, that has been given precedent. :5. In the individual races here some non-European Cup racers participated. Among those was Ingeborg Nordmo Krokstad in the 10 km individual, she was not a European Cup racer and so did not receive any points, and for European Cup purposes Doris Niva came 9th and received the appropriate points, with Anne L. Engstr\u00f8m finishing 10th. And in 5 km sprint Liv H\u00f8gli was also a non-European Cup racer and thus for European Cup purposes those who finished behind her moves up a spot with Doris Niva finishing 4th and Anne L. Engstr\u00f8m finishing 10th. ==References== Category:Biathlon World Cup World Cup ",
