    "text": "The United States attorney general (AG) is the head of the United States Department of Justice, the chief lawyer of the federal government of the United States, and a member of the Cabinet of the United States. Under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, the officeholder is nominated through the power of appointment by the president of the United States, then appointed with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The attorney general is supported by the Office of the Attorney General, which includes executive staff and several deputies. The 85th and current United States attorney general is William Barr, appointed by Donald Trump. ==History== Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789 which, among other things, established the Office of the Attorney General. The original duties of this officer were \"to prosecute and conduct all suits in the Supreme Court in which the United States shall be concerned, and to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the United States, or when requested by the heads of any of the departments\".Judiciary Act of 1789, section 35. The Department of Justice was established in 1870 to support the attorneys general in the discharge of their responsibilities. The attorney general, the secretary of state, the secretary of the treasury, and the secretary of defense are generally regarded as the four most important Cabinet officials in the United States because of the significance and age of their respective departments.Cabinets and Counselors: The President and the Executive Branch (1997). Congressional Quarterly. p. 87. The title \"Attorney General\" is an example of a noun (attorney) followed by a postpositive adjective (general). \"General\" is a description of the type of attorney, not a title or rank in itself (as it would be in the military). Even though the attorney general (and the similarly titled solicitor general) is often referred to as \"General\" or \"General [last name]\" by senior government officials, this is considered incorrect in standard American English usage. For the same reason, the correct American English plural form is \"attorneys general\" rather than \"attorney generals.\" ==Presidential transition== It is the practice for the attorney general, along with the other Cabinet secretaries and high-level political appointees of the president, to give resignation with effect on the Inauguration Day (January 20) of a new president. The deputy attorney general, who is also expected to tender their resignation, is commonly requested to stay on and act as Attorney General pending the confirmation by the Senate of the new attorney general. For example, on the inauguration of President Donald Trump on January 20, 2017, the then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch left her position, so the then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who had also tendered her resignation, was asked to stay on to serve as Acting Attorney General until the confirmation of the new attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had been nominated for the office in November 2016 by then-President-elect Donald Trump. ==List of attorneys general== ; Parties (4) (5) (33) (4) (39) ; Status {| class=\"wikitable mw- collapsible\" style=\"clear:right; text-align:center\" !No. !Portrait !Name !State of residence !Took office !Left office !colspan=2 |President(s) |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |Edmund Randolph |Virginia |September 26, 1789 |January 26, 1794 !rowspan=3 style=\"background: ;\" | | rowspan=\"3\" |George Washington |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |William Bradford |Pennsylvania |January 27, 1794 |August 23, 1795 |- ! style=\"background: ;\" rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" |75px | rowspan=\"2\" |Charles Lee | rowspan=\"2\" |Virginia | rowspan=\"2\" |December 10, 1795 | rowspan=\"2\" |February 19, 1801 |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |John Adams |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |Levi Lincoln Sr. |Massachusetts |March 5, 1801 ||March 2, 1805 |rowspan=3 style=\"background: ;\" | |rowspan=3 |Thomas Jefferson |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |John Breckinridge |Kentucky |August 7, 1805 |December 14, 1806 |- !rowspan=2 style=\"background: ;\" | |rowspan=2 |75px |rowspan=2 |Caesar Augustus Rodney |rowspan=2 |Delaware |rowspan=2 |January 20, 1807 |rowspan=2 |December 10, 1811 |- |rowspan=3 style=\"background: ;\" | |rowspan=3 |James Madison |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |William Pinkney |Maryland |December 11, 1811 |February 9, 1814 |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |Richard Rush |Pennsylvania |February 10, 1814 |November 12, 1817 |- !rowspan=2 style=\"background: ;\" | |rowspan=2 |75px |rowspan=2 |William Wirt |rowspan=2 |Virginia |rowspan=2 |November 13, 1817 |rowspan=2 |March 4, 1829 |style=\"background: ;\" | |James Monroe |- |style=\"background: ;\" | |John Quincy Adams |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |John Macpherson Berrien |Georgia |March 9, 1829 |July 19, 1831 |rowspan=3 style=\"background: ;\" | |rowspan=3 |Andrew Jackson |- !style=\"background: ;\" | |75px |Roger B.
