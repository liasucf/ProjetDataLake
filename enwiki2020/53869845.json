Third temple floor sketch based on Rabbi Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michal's commentary on the Hebrew text of Ezekiel ==The sanctuary (41:1\u20134)== Ezekiel is brought into the \"sanctuary\", or nave/main room in the temple, which length and width are the same as in Solomon's temple (), but no mention of the height. There is apparently no altar of incense, lamps, or other parts that were in the former temple ()f. ===Verse 1=== : Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the doorposts, :: six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side\u2014the width of the tabernacle. NKJV * The vision was given on the 25th anniversary of Ezekiel's exile, \"April 28, 573 BCE\". * \"Sanctuary\" (Hebrew \u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dc): here \"the main room of the temple\", sometimes called the \"holy place\" (compare )Footnotes in New King James Version. * Septuagint doesn't have \"\u2013the width of the tabernacle\" (lit. \"the tent\"); it is found in Hebrew texts. ===Verse 4=== : He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; : and he said to me, \u201cThis is the Most Holy Place.\u201d NKJV * Ezekiel did not enter the Most Holy Place, because he is just a priest, not the high priest, and only the high priest can enter that room, once a year, on the day of atonement (). ==The side buildings (41:5\u201315a)== This part starts a series of passages providing more information for the previous short description; the original account will continue in f. The details of the arcades or side-chambers (Verses 5\u20137) are unclear, but seem to match the pattern of Solomon's temple (). ===Verse 9=== :The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits, and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the temple. NKJV \"The remaining terrace\" is translated \"that which was left\" in the King James Version, \"the free space\" in the New Revised Standard Version. Jamieson, Fausset and Brown note that there was unoccupied space in Solomon's Temple which the Kings of Judah had used for horses dedicated to the sun, and that in Ezekiel's visionary temple there was to be no space which was not sacred to the Lord.Jamieson, Fausset and Brown, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Ezekiel 41, accessed 4 January 2020 ==The design inside (41:15b\u201326)== This section describes the interior design inside the temple; the details are obscure. In this addition, the interior of the Most Holy Place or the Holy of Holies is described openly unlike in the previous part. ==See also== *New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scroll *Solomon's Temple *Third Temple *Related Bible parts: 1 Kings 6, 2 Chronicles 3, Isaiah 2, Ezekiel 40, Revelation 21 ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * ==External links== ===Jewish=== *Ezekiel 41 Hebrew with Parallel English *Ezekiel 41 Hebrew with Rashi's Commentary ===Christian=== *Ezekiel 41 English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate 41 ",
