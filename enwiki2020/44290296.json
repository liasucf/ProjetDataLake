    "text": "In algebraic geometry, a toric stack is a stacky generalization of a toric variety. More precisely, a toric stack is obtained by replacing in the construction of a toric variety a step of taking GIT quotients with that of taking quotient stacks. Consequently, a toric variety is a coarse approximation of a toric stack. A toric orbifold is an example of a toric stack. == See also == *Stanley\u2013Reisner ring == References == * * * Category:Algebraic geometry ",
