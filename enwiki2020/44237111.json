He also played non-league football as an amateur for Stockton. ==Life and career== McGiffen was born in 1904 in South Bank, which was then in Yorkshire, the third child of John McGiffen, an iron worker, and his wife Alice, and raised in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. By 1924, he was playing football for his hometown club, the amateur club Stockton F.C.; he scored in a 9\u20134 defeat to Ferryhill Athletic on the last day of the 1923\u201324 Northern League season. The Daily Express preview of Stockton's Amateur Cup tie against London Caledonians in 1926 described the youthful McGiffen as \"very fast and tricky, with a penchant for goals\". He helped Stockton win the Northern League Challenge Cup in 1926\u201327, before leaving the club at the end of the season to turn professional with Third Division North club Darlington. McGiffen scored in Darlington's 9\u20133 win against Lincoln City in January 1928, and according to the Burnley Express, he was the pick of their forwards as he scored twice in a 4\u20132 defeat of Nelson in April. By the end of his second season with the club, McGiffen had made 23 League appearances and scored four times. He was included on Darlington's retained list, and was reported to have signed on again for the coming season. At the end of July, he underwent a mastoid operation in Stockton Hospital; he died there three days later, on 3 August, at the age of 25. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1929 deaths Category:People from South Bank Category:English footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Stockton F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Northern Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Sportspeople from Yorkshire ",
