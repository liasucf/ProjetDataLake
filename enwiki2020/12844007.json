    "text": "Tatiana (or Tatianna, also romanized as Tatyana, Tatjana, Tatijana \"'Tytiana,\"' etc.) is a female name of Roman origin. The short form of the name in some Slavic languages is Tanya (). ==Variations== * * * * * * * ==Origin== Tatiana is a female name of Sabine and Latin origin, a feminine derivative of the Sabine-Latin name Tatius. Titus Tatius was the name of a king of the Sabines, an Italic tribe living near Rome, presumably from the 8th to the 1st century BC. Because the Romans met with the Sabines, the name Tatius remained in use in Ancient Rome and during the first centuries of Christianity, as well as its diminutive Tatianus and the feminine Tatiana. The name then disappeared from Western Europe, but remained prevalent in the Hellenic world (Eastern Roman Empire), and later spread to the Orthodox world, including Russia. It honors the Orthodox Saint Tatiana who was tortured and martyred in the persecutions of Emperor Alexander Severus c. 230 in Rome. Saint Tatiana is also considered a patron saint of Moscow State University in particular and all Russian students in general. Hence, Tatiana Day is celebrated as Students' Day on January 25th. ==In popular culture== Tatiana Larina is the heroine of Alexander Pushkin's verse novel Eugene Onegin. The poem was and continues to be extremely popular in Russia. The character of Tatiana Larina inspired the names of two Romanovs: Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia and her distant cousin Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia. ==Notable people== ===In Christianity=== * Saint Tatiana, 3rd-century Christian martyr ===In modeling=== * Tatiana Cotliar, Argentine model * Tatiana Dante, fashion model and America's Next Top Model Cycle 4 candidate * Ta\u0165\u00e1na Kucha\u0159ov\u00e1, Czech model, Miss World 2006 * Tatjana Patitz, German model * Tatiana Sorokko, Russian model ===In television and films=== * Tatiana (singer), Mexican singer and children's television show host * Tatianna, American drag queen and reality personality * Tatyana Ali, actress and singer * Tatyana Dogileva, Soviet/Russian actress * Tatiana Maslany, Canadian actress * Ta\u0165jana Medveck\u00e1, Czech actress * Tatiana Papamoschou, Greek actress * Tatiana Pauhofov\u00e1, Slovak actress * Tatiana Samoilova, Soviet/Russian actress * Tatjana \u0160imi\u0107, Croatian-Dutch actress and singer * Tatiana Stefanidou, Greek television host * Tatiana Vilhelmov\u00e1, Czech actress ===In other performance arts=== * Tatiana Mamaki, Greek dancer and choreographer * Tatiana Troyanos, opera singer ===In sports=== * Tatyana Alekseyeva, Russian 400 metre runner * Tatyana Biryulina, Soviet javelin thrower * Tatjana Burmazovic, Serbian volleyball player * Tatiana Calder\u00f3n (born 1993), Colombian racing driver * Tatyana Fomina (born 1954), Estonian chess player * Tathiana Garbin, Italian tennis player * Tatiana Golovin, French tennis player of Russian origin * Tatiana Grigorieva, Australian athlete of Russian origin * Tatiana Gutsu, Ukrainian Olympic Gymnast * Tatiana Kavvadia, Greek basketball player * Tatiana Kyriushyna (born 1989), Ukrainian handball player * Jessica Long American Paralympic gold medalist born Tatiana Olegovna Kirillova * Tatiana Khalil (born 1992), Lebanese footballer * Ta\u0165\u00e1na Kocembov\u00e1, Czechoslovak runner * Tatyana Konstantinova, Russian hammer thrower * Tatiana Kosintseva, International Grandmaster, chess * Tatiana Kosheleva, Russian Volleyball Player * Tatiana Lemos, Brazilian freestyle swimmer * Tatyana Lesovaya, Russian discus thrower * Tatjana Malek, German tennis player * Tatiana Matveeva (footballer) (born 1990), Georgian footballer * Tatiana Matveyeva (born 1985), Russian weightlifter * Tatiana Nabieva, Russian artistic gymnast * Tatiana Panova, Russian tennis player * Tatiana Perebiynis, Ukrainian tennis player * Tatsiana Piatrenia (born 1981), Belarusian trampoline gymnast * Tatyana Polovinskaya, Ukrainian long-distance runner * Tatiana Poutchek, Belarusian tennis player * Tatyana Skachko, Russian long jumper * Tatiana Sousa, Greek handball player * Tatyana Sudarikova, Kyrgyzstani javelin thrower * Tatyana Yurchenko (born 1993), Kazakhstani middle-distance runner ===In music=== *Tatiana Borodina, Russian opera soprano * Tatiana Bulanova, Russian pop singer * Tatiana Cameron, Croatian-born pop singer (formerly known as \"Tajci\") * Princess Tatiana von F\u00fcrstenberg, daughter of Prince Egon and Diane Von F\u00fcrstenberg; singer in the band Playdate * Tatiana DeMaria, English musician * Tatiana Kotova (born 1985), Russian singer, actress, and television presenter * Tatiana Okupnik, Polish singer, based in London * Tatiana Manaois, American pop singer * Tatiana Shmailyuk, singer of the Ukrainian metal band Jinjer ===Nobility=== * Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia (1890-1979), eldest daughter of Russian poet Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia. * Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia (1897 - 1918), the second daughter of Emperor Nicholas II Romanov and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse). * Princess Tatiana Radziwi\u0142\u0142 (born 1939), daughter of Princess Eug\u00e9nie of Greece and Denmark. * Princess Tatiana of Greece and Denmark (born 1980), wife of Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark ===In literature and other fiction=== * Tatiana Gritsi-Milliex, Greek writer and journalist * Tatyana Tolstaya, modern Russian writer, granddaughter of Aleksei Tolstoy * Tatiana Larina, the love interest in Alexander Pushkin's celebrated novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin * Tatiana Romanova, James Bond's love interest in the 1963 movie From Russia with Love' * Tatiana Taylor, character in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet * Tatiana Wisla, character in the anime series Last Exile * Tatiana de Rosnay, an author of the fiction \"Sarah's Key\" * :fr:Tatiana Metanova, character in Paullina Simons \"Bronze Horseman\" * Princess Tatiana, from an episode of The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa (Once Upon a Timon.) * Tatiana, a physical therapist in \"Kingdom\" * EVA, character in Metal Gear Solid 3 who uses the name Tatiana as one of her cover identities * Tatianna, a character in Fire Emblem Gaiden.
