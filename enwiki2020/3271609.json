    "text": "FEU Institute of Technology, also known simply as FEU Tech, was established in 1992. EACIT is an educational partnership of Asia Pacific College (APC), IBM Philippines, Intelligent Wave Inc., and Far Eastern University. FEU Tech is in the northwestern part of the FEU Campus in the City of Manila and occupies the former location of the FEU Hospital. FEU Tech is an Institute of Technology. It is cited as a CHED Center of Development in IT Education (CoD). FEU Tech operates under the aegis of Far Eastern University; it follows and is directly connected to Far Eastern University. It is headed by Dr. Michael M. Alba as University President and Dr. Benson T. Tan as Senior Executive Director. ==History== In July 1991, IBM Philippines, together with SM Foundation, Inc. founded Asia Pacific Computer Technology Center (APCTC) in an effort to address the manpower needs of the growing Information Technology industry. APCTC later collaborated with Far Eastern University (FEU) and Intelligent Wave, Inc (IWI) to set up a computer school, which was called East Asia Computer Center (EACC) and was eventually renamed as East Asia College of Information Technology (EACIT). On September 30, 1998, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) noted the change in the name of East Asia Institute of Computer Technology (EAICT) to East Asia College of Information Technology. On February 24, 2000, East Asia College of Information Technology was identified by CHED as a Center of Development for Excellence in Information Technology Education. In 2001, CHED approved the proposal of East Asia College of Information Technology to offer additional courses leading to Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Information Management. In the same year, FEU reopened its College of Engineering offering a trimestral (four years and one term) program. In 2002, FEU bought out the shares of all incorporators and became the sole owner of EACIT. That next year, FEU\u2019s College of Engineering was merged with EACIT and the two formed a technology education powerhouse known as FEU \u2013 East Asia College (FEU \u2013 EAC). FEU Tech, occupies two major buildings. One of which is the original FEU Technology Building (now called Engineering Building) along Nicanor Reyes St. (Morayta). In 2014, FEU \u2013 East Asia College transferred to a newly constructed 17-storey building which is located at P. Paredes St. in Manila. It is now known as FEU Institute of Technology. Like its sister school, FEU Diliman, the college runs on a trimester academic system. An academic year starts in the second week of August and ends every June. ==Degree programs== ===College of Computer Studies=== * Bachelor of Science in Computer Science ** Specialization in Software Engineering ** Specialization in Business Analytics * Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing ** Specialization in Digital Animation Technology ** Specialization in Game Development * Bachelor of Science in Information Technology ** Specialization in Digital Arts ** Specialization in Animation and Game Development ** Specialization in Web and Mobile Applications ** Specialization in Service Management and Business Analytics * Associate in Computer Technology ===College of Engineering=== * Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Manufacturing Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering ===Department of Graduate Studies=== * Master of Information Technology ==Buildings== (L-R) Education Building, Admissions Building, and Engineering Building ===FIT Building=== * E-Library, Swimming Pool, Covered Gym and Basketball Court, Computer Labs, Electronic Labs, Academic Rooms, Chemistry and Physics Rooms. ===Engineering Building=== * Computer Labs, Electronics Labs, Data Center, Library, Academic Rooms, PE Rooms, FEU Foodcourt, Car Park, Innovation Center ==References== ==External links== * FEU Institute of Technology Category:Far Eastern University Category:Education in Sampaloc, Manila FEU Tech Category:Educational institutions established in 1992 ",
