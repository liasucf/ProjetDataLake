    "text": "is an air base of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), the United States Air Force, and the United States Navy located in Misawa, Aomori, in the northern part of the island of Honsh\u016b of Japan. It is located northeast of Misawa railway station, west of the Pacific Ocean, northeast of Towada, northwest of Hachinohe, and north of Tokyo at the \"Tip of the Spear\". It is a Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) facility with the 35th Fighter Wing (35 FW, about 48 F-16 aircraft split among the 13th and 14th Fighter Squadrons)https://scout.com/military/warrior/Article/Army-Fires-New- Stryker-30mm-Cannon-Preps-for-Major-Land-War-108357646 as its host wing. It hosts both Japanese and American troops. ==History== === Origins === What is now called Misawa Air Base has been used by the military since the Meiji period, when it was used as a cavalry training center for the Imperial Army. In 1870, the Japanese Emperor established a stud farm for the household cavalry in the area that later became Misawa AB, and kept his own (Tenno Heika) cavalry there until 1931, when the Sino-Japanese conflict required their use in China. Misawa remained a training center for Japanese Cavalry until the Japanese Army constructed the first runway at Misawa for military aircraft in 1938. Misawa Air Base was near the takeoff site of the world's first non-stop trans-Pacific flight in 1931. Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon took off from a gravel runway on Sabishiro Beach near Misawa in the aircraft known as Miss Veedol, landing 41 hours later in Wenatchee, Washington thereby successfully crossing the Pacific Ocean. The runway is commemorated by a large sign in the coastal forest and is a popular beach and recreation area for Misawa AB personnel. The cities of Wenatchee and Misawa cemented their special relationship by becoming official sister cities in 1981, strengthening their friendship through annual cultural exchange programs. The Imperial Army transformed Misawa into an air base in 1938 when it was used as a base for long-range bombers. By early 1941, the Gensan Flying Corps trained at Misawa. The base was taken over by the Imperial Navy Air Corps in 1942 when the 22d Imperial Naval Air Wg assumed control of the base and the mission was changed to research and development. In 1944, facilities were built for Kamikaze Special Attack forces. === World War II === Before the outbreak of World War II, Lake Ogawara at Misawa was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service to practice for the attack on Pearl Harbor. The lake was used because it was similar in depth to Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military fashioned hills near the shore of the lake to resemble the shapes of Battleships and Cruisers that were anchored in Pearl Harbor. This provided for a realistic view for their pilots from the air. The pilots conducted low level bombing runs, dropping torpedoes into the shallow depths of Lake Ogawara. This practice developed and refined the method to attack the ships that were anchored at Pearl Harbor. During World War II, the Misawa area was heavily damaged (base 90 percent destroyed) by U.S. fighters and bombers. === Postwar era=== The American occupation of Misawa began in September 1945. Misawa had to be almost completely reconstructed by occupying U.S. forces by Army engineers who restored the base for future use by the United States Army Air Forces. During the Korean War and Vietnam War, Misawa supported fighter missions. The base was the launching point for clandestine surveillance overflights into China and the USSR during the 1950s. After the immediate postwar reconstruction of facilities, the first permanent USAAF tenant was the 613th Air Control and Warning Squadron (613th AC&WS;), taking up residence on July 15, 1946 and providing air traffic control in the Misawa area for the next decade. ==== 49th Fighter Bomber Wing ==== The first operational fighter wing was the 49th Fighter-Bomber Group, being reassigned to Misawa on March 31, 1948. The 49th had three operational squadrons, the 7th, 8th and 9th, and flew the P-80 Shooting Star along with a few P-61 Black Widow night fighters. The 49th FBW performed occupation duties in Japan and took part in maneuvers and surveillance patrols as part of Far East Air Forces. In February 1950, the unit was redesignated as the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing, with the group being its operational component === Korean War === With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 49th Fighter-Bomber Group was split off from the wing and was one of the first USAF units dispatched to Korea from Japan, its tactical squadrons began operations with F-51D Mustangs as the F-51D performed the ground support role better than the Shooting Stars. The group was rejoined with the wing in December 1950 when the Wing was reassigned to Taegu AB (K-2). At Misawa, the 49th was replaced by the 6163d Air Base Wing to perform host and occupation duties. The 41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the 35th FIW at Johnson AB was deployed to Misawa to provide air defense starting in September 1950, remaining until February 1951, being replaced by the 40th FIS also from Johnson AB, which remained until July. The 27th Fighter-Escort Wing was transferred from Taegu to Misawa in October, and remained at the base until January 20, 1953 to provide air defense flying straight-winged Republic F-84G Thunderjets which proved inadequate against the North Korean MiG-15s it encountered over Korean airspace. Between May and August 1953, the 12th Strategic Fighter Wing pulled a rotational TDY at Misawa relieving the 27th and being relieved in turn by the 31st Strategic Fighter Wing. remaining until February 12, 1954. The 12th SFW returned for a second TDY in May 1954, remaining until August. The 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing was relieved from its duties in South Korea on November 7, 1953 and resumed its host duties at the base. It remained at Misawa until December 10, 1957, however its operational control of its squadrons and group came under the 39th Air Division on March 1, 1955. === Cold War === ==== 39th Air Division ==== On March 1, 1952, the 39th Air Division was established at Misawa, and through January 15, 1968, the Air Division controlled all of the units responsible for the air defense of north Japan, which included northern Honsh\u016b and Hokkaid\u014d islands and the contiguous territorial waters. Wings controlled by the 39th AD were: * 49th Fighter Bomber Wing March 1, 1955 \u2013 April 15, 1957 *4th Fighter Bomber Wing March 8, 1955 \u2013 December 8, 1957 *21st Tactical Fighter Wing November 10, 1958 \u2013 June 18, 1960 Squadrons controlled by the 39th AD were: * 4th Fighter Interceptor Squadron March 1, 1955 \u2013 June 20, 1965 *45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron April 25, 1960 \u2013 January 15, 1968 *67th Tactical Fighter Squadron December 15, 1967 \u2013 January 15, 1968 * 339th Fighter Interceptor Squadron March 1, 1955 \u2013 January 15, 1958 * 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron November 29, 1965 \u2013 January 15, 1968 * 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron June 18, 1960 \u2013 June 16, 1964 * 418th Fighter Day Squadron December 10, 1957 \u2013 March 25, 1958 * 531st Tactical Fighter Squadron June 18, 1960 \u2013 June 16, 1964 * 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron November 3, 1965 \u2013 January 15, 1968. In this role the 39th trained the assigned units and controlled aerial interception missions when Japanese air space was violated. The division also controlled air refueling and ECM missions, and trained personnel of the Japanese Air Self Defense Force in flying operations, radar operations and maintenance, and proper radio procedures. After the Soviet Union shot down an RB-29 aircraft on November 7, 1954,Published Cold War Shoot Down Incidents at Advocacy & Intelligence Index For POWs-MIAs Archives the 39th provided fighter escort for all friendly reconnaissance aircraft flying near Soviet territory and the Northern Air Defense Sector. The division also supported combat operations during the Vietnam War. Aircraft flown by the 39th AD included the F-84, 1952\u20131954, 1958\u20131959; KB-29, 1953\u20131954; North American F-86 Sabre, 1954\u20131960; F-100, 1957\u20131964; F-102, 1960\u20131965; RF-101, 1960\u20131968; F-105, 1967\u20131968. ==== Japanese Air Forces ==== The first Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) units were activated at Misawa in October 1954, and the first Japanese Northern Air Defense Force units began operations in 1957. ==== 475th Air Base Wing ==== The 31st Air Division was inactivated on January 15, 1968, and was replaced at Misawa by the 475th Air Base Wing. The operational squadron at the base was the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, being deployed to Misawa from the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Kadena AB, Okinawa. The squadron remained detached at Misawa until March 15, 1971 when the flight line was transferred to the United States Navy and all U.S. Air Force fighter sorties ended. ==== 6112th Air Base Group ==== AN/FLR-9 antenna array Misawa Air Base c.1980 The 6112th ABG took over the base host duties at Misawa in 1971, with the inactivation of the 475th ABW. For the next several years, Misawa's focus was with the electronic intelligence gathering mission of the 6921st (later 6920th) Security Wing of the U.S. Air Force Security Service. The 6112th ABG performed PACAF administrative duties. The flight line was controlled by Naval Aviation units, with the JASDF operating from its own flight lines. The JASDF took over control of the airspace over Misawa on October 1, 1978. During this period, the base hosted various Allied exercises in the region and the 6112th ABG provided support for 13 Air Force associated non-flying units, 14 DOD agencies and the JASDF units stationed in the Misawa area until September 1, 1982. In 1983, Misawa was a major deployment site for rescue and recovery operations, following the downing of Korean Air Flight 007. ==== 432d Tactical Fighter Wing ==== In July 1984, the 432d Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Misawa on the resumption of operational PACAF flying. The 432d controlled two F-16 Fighting Falcon squadrons (13th, 14th FS) and a rescue squadron (39th RQS) flying the HH-53 \"Super Jolly Green Giant\" helicopter. === Post Cold War === Misawa F-16s Misawa F-16s The 35th Fighter Wing was redesignated and reassigned October 1, 1994 when it inactivated at Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland and was reactivated the same day at Misawa where the wing assumed the missions and responsibilities previously performed by the 432nd Fighter Wing. Near the 1995 new year, Misawa experienced two earthquakes\u20147.5 and 7.9 on the Richter scale at the epicenter off the coast of Hachinohe. On September 25, 2003 a magnitude 8.3 earthquake occurred off the east coast of Hokkaid\u014d which was strongly felt in Misawa and all of Aomori Prefecture. Damage to Misawa Air Base was limited to burst water mains, cosmetic cracks in walls and personal property damage. There were no reports of damage to the base runway. This was the largest earthquake reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for 2003. In recent years, Misawa Air Base and the Misawa Airport which connects directly to the base have experienced flight delays to both military and civilian aircraft. Since the base has only one runway, city planning officials and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport have been researching new runway proposals to relieve the congestion a single, high traffic runway causes. Alpha and Bravo taxiways lie parallel to the runway and both are nearly the same length as the runway. Bravo taxiway has been the prime candidate for reconstruction into a second runway. The base was slightly damaged by the March 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami and experienced a black out. There were concerns about flooding from the tsunami reaching the base, and about a nearby nuclear facility, the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.Dickson, Patrick At Misawa, 'cold, miserable and scared people' March 11, 2011 Stars and Stripes Retrieved August 22, 2016 After the quake, personnel and aircraft from the base assisted with Operation Tomodachi. The base also served as an important hub for airlifted assistance during the disaster recovery efforts. During the crisis, around 1,400 American family members voluntarily departed the base for locations outside Japan.Reed, Charlie, \"Military wraps up first round of departures from Japan\", Stars and Stripes, 25 March 2011, retrieved 28 March 2011. In October 2016 four Royal Air Force Typhoon fighters from No. 2 Squadron RAF supported by a Voyager aerial tanker and a C-17 deployed to Misawa for the first bilateral exercises in Japan for the JASDF to host conducted with non-U.S. forces.Royal Air Force Aircraft Arrive in Japan October 22, 2016 Royal Air Force Retrieved October 24, 2016Japanese, British air forces to face off for first time since war October 23, 2016 Japan Times Retrieved October 24, 2016Royal Air Force to Join Air Forces of Japan and South Korea in First Ever Aerial Drills October 16, 2016 Yibada Retrieved October 24, 2016 On February 20, 2018 a US F-16 based at Misawa dumped two external fuel tanks into the nearby Lake Ogawara after experiencing an engine fire. === Major commands to which assigned=== *Far East Air Forces, (September\u2013December 1945) : Redesignated: Pacific Air Command, United States Army, (December 1945 \u2013 January 1947) : Redesignated: Far East Air Forces, (January 1947 \u2013 July 1957) : Redesignated: Pacific Air Forces, (July 1957 \u2013 July 1972) ::Air Defense Command (Attached), (September 1950 \u2013 June 1965) *United States Air Force Security Service, (July 1972 \u2013 October 1978) *Pacific Air Forces, (October 1978\u2013present) === Major Operating Units === * 32d Army Engineering Construction Group*, September 1945 \u2013 August 1948 * 49th Fighter-Bomber Group, March 31, 1948 \u2013 January 23, 1950 : 49th Fighter (later Fighter-Bomber) Wing*, August 18, 1948 \u2013 December 1, 1950 * 41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Air Defense), September 6, 1950 \u2013 February 20, 1951 : Detachment from Johnson Air Base, Japan * 6163d Air Base Wing*, December 1, 1950 \u2013 November 2, 1951 * 40th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Air Defense), May 25 \u2013 July 1, 1951 * 116th Fighter-Bomber Wing*, November 1, 1951 \u2013 July 1, 1952 : Federalized Georgia Air National Guard * 6016th Air Base Wing, January 1, 1952 \u2013 November 18, 1953 * 39th Air Division, March 1, 1952 \u2013 January 15, 1968 * 474th Fighter-Bomber Wing, July 10, 1952 \u2013 April 1, 1953 * 27th Fighter-Escort Wing, October 9, 1952 \u2013 January 20, 1953 * 31st Fighter- Escort (later Strategic Fighter) Wing, July 20 \u2013 October 11, 1952; November 11, 1953 \u2013 February 12, 1954 * 12th Strategic Fighter Wing, May 15, 1953 \u2013 August 10, 1953 * 49th Air Base Group*, April 1, 1953 \u2013 December 10, 1957 : 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing*, November 7, 1953 \u2013 December 10, 1957 : 49th Fighter-Bomber Group, June 1 \u2013 December 10, 1957 * 506th Fighter-Escort Wing, August 15 \u2013 November 15, 1953 * 12th Strategic Fighter Wing, May 12 \u2013 August 11, 1954 * 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Air Defense), July 1 \u2013 August 1, 1954 * 4th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Air Defense), August 1, 1954 \u2013 June 20, 1965 * 336th Fighter-Interceptor (later Fighter-Bomber, Fighter-Day) Squadron, November 19, 1954 \u2013 August 7, 1956 * 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, March 3, 1955 \u2013 November 15, 1963 * 6921st Radio Squadron : Redesignated: 6921st Radio Group : Redesignated: 6921st Security Wing, May 8, 1955 \u2013 February 1, 1976 * JASDF Northern Air Defense Force, July 15, 1957 \u2013 present * 6139th Air Base Group*, October 10, 1957 \u2013 January 8, 1964 :: 416th Fighter-Bomber (later Tactical Fighter) Squadron, March 25, 1958 \u2013 June 15, 1964 :: 531st Tactical Fighter Squadron, July 1, 1958 \u2013 June 15, 1964 : Redesignated: 439th Air Base Group*, January 8, 1964 \u2013 January 15, 1968 : Redesignated: 475th Tactical Fighter Wing*, January 15, 1968 \u2013 March 15, 1971 :: 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron, November 3, 1965 \u2013 May 15, 1971 :: 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron, November 29, 1965 \u2013 May 15, 1971 :: 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, December 15, 1967 \u2013 March 15, 1971 :: 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron, July 22, 1968 \u2013 February 28, 1971 :: 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, March 16, 1970 \u2013 February 15, 1971 * 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, March 15, 1971 \u2013 September 16, 1974 * 6122d Air Base Group*, March 15, 1971 \u2013 July 1, 1972 * U.S. Naval Security Group Activity, July 1, 1971 \u2013 December 29, 2005 : Redesignated: U.S. Navy Information Operations Command Misawa, December 29, 2005 \u2013 October 14, 2014 * 6920th Air Base Group*, July 1, 1972 \u2013 February 1, 1976 : Redesignated: 6920th Security Wing*, February 1, 1976 \u2013 October 1, 1978 * 6112th Air Base Group*, October 1, 1978 \u2013 July 1, 1984 * 432d Tactical Fighter Wing*, July 1, 1984 \u2013 October 31, 1994 * 35th Fighter Wing* October 31, 1994 \u2013 present == Role and operations == Misawa is the only combined, joint service installation in the western Pacific. It houses three U.S. military services (Air Force, Navy, and Army), as well as the Japan Air Self- Defense Force. The base is home to 5,200 US military personnel, as well as 350 US civilian employees and 900 Japanese national employees. The Misawa Passive Radio Frequency space surveillance site was used for tracking satellites using the signals they transmit. It also provided coverage of geosynchronous satellites using the Deep Space Tracking System (DSTS) but was dismantled around 2002. The Misawa Security Operations Center (MSOC), located in the northwestern part of the Air Base, is believed to be one of the largest ECHELON ground stations. ===United States=== Misawa F-16CJ Block 50 Flagships The United States Air Force's 35th Fighter Wing (35 FW) is the host unit at Misawa Air Base. The wing conducts daily F-16 flight training to maintain its combat readiness. Its pilots fly air-to-air weapons delivery exercises over water and sharpen their air-to-ground skills using the Draughon Gunnery Range (formerly Ripsaw Range) located 12 miles north of Misawa. Four groups are assigned to the 35th Fighter Wing: the 35th Maintenance Group, the 35th Mission Support Group, 35th Medical Group and 35th Operations Group. Operational fighter squadrons of the 35th Operations Group are: *13th Fighter Squadron \"Panthers\", Red tail stripe *14th Fighter Squadron \"Samurais\", Yellow tail stripe Both squadrons fly the Block 50 F-16C/D \"Wild Weasels\", and use the tail code of \"WW\" (before adopting the \"WW\" tail code, the code \"MJ\" (for Misawa, Japan) was carried.
