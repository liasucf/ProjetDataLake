    "text": "\"You're the One for Me, Fatty\" is a single by Morrissey released in April 1992. It was taken from the then-unreleased Your Arsenal album and was the second Morrissey single to be co-written with Alain Whyte and produced by glam rock legend Mick Ronson. Although the lyrics seemed a typically tongue-in- cheek Morrissey love song towards an overweight person, in reality the words were an in-joke directed at Madness singer Chas Smash whom Morrissey had recently befriended. Smash has since confessed that he is the subject of the song.Goddard, Simon, Mozipedia - The Encyclopedia of Morrissey and The Smiths. Ebury Press. 2009. p. 507 The title is a pun on the Marvelettes' song You Are The One for Me Bobby. The track reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart. ==Critical reception== This single was retrospectively described by Ned Raggett in AllMusic as \"[a] smart, lively cut...with the overall title and overall mood still being as classically Morrissey as it gets.\" Raggett did not think the B-sides were as strong in comparison but still \"fine enough numbers, further evidence as to how the Your Arsenal sessions had re-energized [Morrissey].\" Raggett concludes his review, writing, \"The tone throughout is relaxed and fun, almost in spite of some of the lyrics\". ==Track listings== All lyrics by Morrissey. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
