Similarly, chartreuse yellow is a yellow color mixed with a small amount of green that was named because of its resemblance to the color of one of the French liqueurs called yellow chartreuse, introduced in 1838. ==Etymology== The French word chartreuse means \"charterhouse\". The monasteries that the monks of the Carthusian order (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764) live in, of which the first one was established in 1082 by Saint Bruno, are called charter houses because they were chartered\u2014and given generous material support\u2014by the Duke of Burgundy known as Philip the Bold when he took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately decorated tomb was initially installed at a Carthusian charterhouse when he died in 1404.Kleiner, Fred S. (2010).
