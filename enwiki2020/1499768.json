Jurong Port, which operates the only multi-purpose port in Singapore, handles bulk, break-bulk and containerised cargo. The port welcomes over 40,000 vessel-calls annually. The port owns and operates its own subzone located in the town of Jurong East in Singapore. ==History== Corporate In 1963, Jurong Port was set up by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) to support the growth of Singapore's first and biggest industrial estate, Jurong Industrial Estate. In 1965, the port officially commenced operations. In 1968, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was set up to drive the industrial estate development in Singapore and Jurong Port became a business division under JTC. On 1 January 2001, Jurong Port was corporatised and became a fully owned subsidiary of JTC Corporation. Infrastructure Jurong Port commenced operations with only two berths. Growing in tandem with the rapid growth of industries in JTC, cargo traffic in Jurong Port passed the million ton mark for the first time in 1970. In 1971, Jurong Port embarked on an expansion programme that provided for four additional deep water general purpose berths, the extension of an existing berth and the addition of warehouses and transit sheds. Further extensions on the five berths were carried out again in 1971. As the Company continued to grow, additional capacity was required and Jurong Port announced the construction and reclamation of Pulau Damar Laut (PDL) in 1989. PDL provided additional land area and created more deepwater multi-purpose berths. In 1996, Singapore went through a land intensification program to increase land utilisation. Resulting from the program was the Jurong Port Cement Terminal, a dedicated common-user cement facility. In 2001, Jurong Port started its Container Terminal on PDL becoming a full-fledged multi-purpose port. In 2008, Jurong Port started the Penjuru Terminal to handle lighterage and shipchandling businesses. It is bounded by Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, Jurong Pier Road, Jurong Island Highway, Seraya Avenue and Sugnei Jurong, including Pulau Damar Laut. ==Facilities== right Jurong Port is an international Multi-Purpose Port Operator operating a General Cargo Terminal, Bulk Cargo Terminal, Container Terminal, Penjuru Terminal and Marina South Wharves for lighter Services, a Small Craft Terminal and mechanical ramps for Roll-On Roll-Off landing crafts.
