    "text": "Offices of WYXB WYXB, branded as \"B105.7\", is an FM radio station owned by Emmis Communications in Indianapolis, Indiana. The station operates on the FM radio frequency of 105.7 MHz, FM channel 289. The studios are located on Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis. The transmitter and antenna, according to the FCC, are located on the eastside of Indianapolis, near 2300 N Hawthorne. WYXB is one of four pop music stations targeted towards adults in Indianapolis; the others being WZPL \"99.5\" which broadcasts an Adult Top 40 format, and WNTR, \"107.9 The Mix\", which broadcasts an Adult Hits format. ==History== The station began operation as classical music formatted WAIV in 1961 through the efforts of the founders of what is now the broadcast program producer The Fine Arts Society of Indianapolis. In 1964, the station was located in the Dearborn Hotel on East Michigan Street. (The Dearborn was built, originally, for a group called the CCC. It is now home to a Wheeler Mission Community Center.) The station's call letters changed to WTLC in 1968 by adopting an Urban Contemporary format; throughout the years WTLC had different nicknames like \"Soul Stereo FM 105 WTLC\", \"WTLC FM 105\", \"Fresh 105 WTLC\", \"Power 105 WTLC\", \"105.7 The People's Station\", \"105.7 The Power\", \"Power 105.7 FM\", and \"105.7 WTLC\". Emmis Communications bought both WTLC and WTLC-FM. Emmis sold WTLC-FM and AM (only the intellectual rights, the actual station license stayed in the Emmis fold) in February 2001, changing the call letters to WYXB. The format changed to adult contemporary. ==Programming== WYXB currently broadcasts a gold-based adult contemporary music format. Unlike most other adult contemporary stations, WYXB plays no current AC hits; while its playlist spans from the 1980s through the 2000s. Its original positioning statement of \"Soft Rock for a Busy World\" has been shortened to just \"Soft Rock.\" It has since changed its slogan to \"The BEST variety of the 80s, 90s, & TODAY\". As do many AC stations, WYXB switches its format to continuous Christmas music during the holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas. WYXB DJs Bernie Eagan and Eric Garnes are Indy radio veterans. Its studios are included with WLHK, WIBC, and WFNI located at the Emmis World Headquarters on the southwest quadrant of Monument Circle. ==References== ==External links== * YXB Category:Emmis Communications radio stations Category:Mass media in Indianapolis ",
