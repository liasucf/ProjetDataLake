Built in 1876, commissioned by Bishop Bernard McQuaid, and designed by Andrew Jackson Warner, this chapel embodies the Early English Gothic style of architecture. It is constructed of Medina sandstone and contains stained glass windows by P. Nicholas of Holland. The interior features ornate hammer beams hand carved by local carpenter Dominic Mura. The altar is a white marble trimmed in black marble and a base of Tennessee pink marble built by the Hall Company of Boston. Several ornate ceiling panels and other intricate adornment throughout the structure was completed by artist Chester F. Leiderson. The lower level of the chapel contains a morgue initially used for storage of bodies that could not be buried when the ground was frozen. In addition, a series of crypts were constructed for the burial of the Bishops of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester, New York. == References == == External links == * * Rochester Wiki Page - information, photos and links Category:Geography of Rochester, New York Category:Roman Catholic cemeteries in the United States Category:Cemeteries in Monroe County, New York Category:Tourist attractions in Rochester, New York Category:1871 establishments in New York (state) ",
