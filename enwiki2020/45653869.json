He played college basketball for the University of Missouri before playing professionally in England, Brazil, Japan, Australia and Ukraine, as well as in the Premier Basketball League and the NBA Development League. ==High school career== Brown attended Lyndon B. Johnson High School in Austin, Texas where he played basketball under head coach Freddy Roland. As a junior in 2002\u201303, he averaged 24 points, seven rebounds and three assists per game. In November 2003, Brown signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of Missouri. Brown earned first-team All-State and first-team All-Region honors playing for Lyndon B. Johnson as a junior and senior, was a three-time all-district selection, and was named the Cen-Tex Player of the Year by the Austin American-Statesman as a senior in 2003\u201304. ==College career== As a freshman at Missouri in 2004\u201305, Brown scored in double figures five times, including a season-high 12 points against Texas Tech on January 19, 2005. In 33 games (six starts), he averaged 5.1 points and 1.9 rebounds in 16.8 minutes per game. As a sophomore in 2005\u201306, Brown scored in double figures 14 times. He recorded his first career double-double with 19 points and a career-high 11 rebounds against Eastern Illinois on December 28, and scored a season-high 21 points on 8-for-12 shooting against Oklahoma on January 10.

Following his junior season, Brown was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his pelvis which, along with a broken foot he occurred a few months later, sidelined him for the majority of the 2007 offseason. The injuries disrupted his senior season preparation as he went into the 2007\u201308 season with a lesser role in coach Mike Anderson's rotation. As a senior, he averaged a career-low 4.5 points and made just three starts in 31 total games. He scored in double figures in five games, recording a season- high 14 points on 6-for-9 shooting against Texas on January 12, 2008. ===College statistics=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2004\u201305 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Missouri | 33 || 6 || 16.8 || .422 || .379 || .640 || 1.9 || .5 || .6 || .2 || 5.1 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2005\u201306 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Missouri | 28 || 27 || 27.2 || .456 || .158 || .687 || 4.8 || 1.4 || .7 || .3 || 9.6 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2006\u201307 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Missouri | 30 || 29 || 21.8 || .450 || .294 || .705 || 4.2 || 1.5 || .8 || .4 || 10.1 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2007\u201308 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Missouri | 31 || 3 || 13.1 || .409 || .386 || .625 || 1.9 || .9 || .5 || .3 || 4.5 |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Career | 122 || 65 || 19.5 || .439 || .313 || .678 || 3.1 || 1.1 || .6 || .3 || 7.2 |- ==Professional career== ===2008\u201309 season=== On November 7, 2008, Brown was selected by the Austin Toros in the ninth round of the 2008 NBA Development League Draft.
