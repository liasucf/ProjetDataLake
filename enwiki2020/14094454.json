Envoy Draws on Her Past in Sierra Leone to Help Abused Women New York Times. Zainab Hawa Bangura was born \"Zainab Hawa Sesay\" in the small rural town of Yonibana, Tonkolili District in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone. She hails from the Temne ethnic group. She was born into a family of limited means, and she attended secondary school on a scholarship that was awarded to her by the Mathora Girls Secondary School near Magburaka. She later attended the Annie Walsh Girls Secondary School in the capital city of Freetown. Then, after graduating from Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College, Bangura moved to the United Kingdom for advanced diplomas in Insurance Management at the City University Business School of London and the University of Nottingham.Secretary-General Appoints Zainab Hawa Bangura of Sierra Leone Director-General, United Nations Office at Nairobi United Nations, press release of December 30, 2019. While in her early 30s, she became vice- president of one of her country's largest insurance companies. Bangura speaks three languages: Temne, Krio, and English. ==Public life== ===Early activism=== Bangura became a social activist during the difficult period when Sierra Leone was ruled by the NPRC military junta. She began with consciousness-raising efforts among urban market women, reminding her followers that her own mother was a market woman. In 1994 she founded Women Organized for a Morally Enlightened Nation (W.O.M.E.N.), the first non- partisan women's rights group in the country. The following year she co- founded the Campaign for Good Governance (CGG). Then, using CGG as her platform, she campaigned for the holding of national elections that finally drove the NPRC from power in 1996 and restored democratic government. This was Sierra Leone's first democratic election in 25 years, and the Sierra Leonean media and the general public attributed that success largely to her efforts. During Sierra Leone's civil war (1991\u20132002) Bangura spoke out forcefully against the atrocities committed against the civilian population by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and was targeted for assassination several times by that group. She also spoke against the corruption in the civilian government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the atrocities committed against civilians by government soldiers. In June 1997, as fighting engulfed the country, Bangura fled on a fishing boat to neighboring Guinea.Somini Sengupta (July 3, 2015), U.N. Envoy Draws on Her Past in Sierra Leone to Help Abused Women New York Times. ===Political career=== In the 2002 elections, Bangura ran against Kabbah for the presidency of Sierra Leone, departing for the first time from her accustomed role as a non-partisan civil society activist. She won less than one percent of the vote, and her Movement for Progress (MOP) party failed to gain any seats in Sierra Leone's parliament. Bangura claimed that her party's low vote count resulted from corruption in the voting system. After the 2002 elections Bangura founded the National Accountability Group (NAG) whose mission was to fight against official corruption and to promote transparency and accountability in government. In 2006 she left Sierra Leone for neighbouring Liberia where she was appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Office in the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and given responsibility for the reconstruction of 16 Liberian ministries and 30 government agencies following that country's devastating civil war. Bangura returned to Sierra Leone in 2007 after Ernest Bai Koroma won the presidency in a hard-fought national election and was named foreign minister shortly thereafter. At the time, many Sierra Leoneans believed that the new president elevated this well known critic of government to such a high position to demonstrate his good faith in promising reform. As a devoted Muslim, Bangura took time off politics in 2009 to travel to the Holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to participate in the 2009 Hajj pilgrimage ceremony. ===Career in international politics=== In 2012, Bangura served on the United Nations Commission on Life-Saving Commodities, which was jointly chaired by Goodluck Jonathan and Jens Stoltenberg, and issued recommendations to increase access to and use of 13 essential commodities for women\u2019s and children\u2019s health.Composition of the Commission Life-Saving Commodities Practitioners\u2019 Network.
