Now, the area belongs to Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. Coastlines along the Dutch-German-Danish coasts were significantly changed during and by a huge storm tide, the Saint Marcellus' flood - also referred to as the Grote Mandrenke - that occurred on 16 January 1362. Many villages and towns were lost forever. The outlines of Strand changed significantly, nowadays legendary Rungholt reportedly being amongst the now sunken places. The island of S\u00fcdfall was separated from the mainland. In 1634, the Burchardi flood finally split Strand island into Nordstrand, Pellworm, and Nordstrandischmoor. ==References== * * ==External links== *Google Earth map of the area now Category:North Frisian Islands Category:Former islands of Denmark ",
