For this she was arrested by the Germans and died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. == Biography == Lucyna Radziejowska was born in Popowo Ko\u015bcielne in 1899. She married Wincenty Radziejowski. They had a daughter, Anna Danuta (born in 1931). In 1941, the Radziejowskis gave shelter to the Soviet prisoner of war Volodya Koltun, an escapee from the POW camp for Soviet soldiers located in Gr\u0105dy. He had contracted typhus while in the camp and the whole Radziejowski family soon became infected as well. Wincenty Radziejowski succumbed to the disease and died on 5 December 1941. Volodya Koltun remained in P\u0142atkownica for approximately a year until June 1941, when he decided to leave the Radziejowskis due to the increasing number of German patrols in the area. In 1943, Lucyna Radziejowska took a woman and her 15-year-old son into her home. The Germans probably murdered the Jews who were trying to hide. Lucyna Radziejowska was taken and detained in Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski, then moved to the Pawiak prison in Warsaw. On 5 October 1943, she was transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where she received prisoner number 64478. She became infected with typhus once more and died in the camp on 20 March 1944. == Commemorations == Lucyna Radziejowska and her daughter were nominated by the Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation to bestow the honorary title of \u201cRighteous Among the Nations\u201d. On 29 June 2019, a plaque commemorating Lucyna Radziejowska was unveiled in Ostr\u00f3w Mazowiecka as part of the \u201cCalled By The Name\u201d project undertaken by the Pilecki Institute. == References == Category:1899 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Deaths from typhus Category:Polish people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust Category:Polish people who died in Auschwitz concentration camp Category:Polish schoolteachers ",
