The military, however, should expect other directives from the Duce Benito Mussolini but completely lose contact with the Italy. Soon the members of the brigade, which includes some very curious and picturesque characters such as the Captain who loves poetry, get acquainted with the local customs and forget their duty as soldiers. Again however the war impose its presence, after an encounter with an outspoken missionary (Michele Placido) who is walking through the desert with a troop of Germans. As hostilities begin again, the soldiers take up arms, but something has changed through their experience and they begin to consider war as useless, while they could live in blissful oblivion in a land so beautiful and rich in culture. These thoughts are cut short when the Captain, who alone had remained a reference figure for the troops, discovers that his recently deceased wife was not faithful. He commits suicide by jumping against the weapons of some Bedouin. In 2015, the book Staging Memory by Stefania Del Monte dedicates a whole section to the movie. ==Cast== * Michele Placido - Brother Simeone * Giorgio Pasotti - Lieutenant Marcello Salvi * Alessandro Haber - Major Stefano Strucchi * Moran Atias - Aisha * Danilo De Summa - soldier * Tatti Sanguineti - a general * Fulvio Falzarano - Sergeant Barzottin * Claudio Bigagli - soldier * Stefano Scandaletti - soldier ==References== ==External links== * * Presentation of the movie The Roses of the Desert Category:2006 films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Films directed by Mario Monicelli Category:2000s romance films Category:Films with screenplays by Suso Cecchi d'Amico ",
