His book A History of Modern Philosophy (first published in 1912) was republished in the Thinker's Library series in 1930. He was the author of The Greek Philosophers (2 vols, 1882); The History of English Rationalism in the Nineteenth Century (2 vols, 1906); and The History of Ancient and Modern Philosophy (2 vols, 1912). Benn was also a member of the London Positivist Society and a friend of the lawyer and positivist Vernon Lushington. Lushington's daughter Susan recorded in her diary on 3 September 1889 that Benn and his wife visited the Lushington's Surrey home - Pyports, Cobham - and how Mrs Benn told her \"how she came to be a positivist.\" ==References== *Obituary: Alfred William Benn, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Jan., 1916), pp. 282\u2013283 *Obituary: A.
