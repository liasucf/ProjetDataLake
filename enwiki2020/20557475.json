On 4 November 2012, following the visit made by Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr, the two countries agreed for a joint Australia-Malaysia cultural exchange program for young Australians and Malaysians to travel to each other's countries and develop a stronger understanding of each other cultures and faiths. == Security relations == Australia and Malaysia have had a well- established tradition of military co-operation, with Australian troops has contributed significantly to Malaysia's defence since its formation. As part of the alliance in Five Power Defence Arrangements, Australia plays a key role in the frequent military exercises between the countries involved. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) formerly operated the base RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia until the airbase management is transferred to the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) in 1970. As part of the FPDA, the RAAF still maintains a presence at this base to this date. == Incidents == === Lynas operation in Malaysia and concerns of environment pollution === In 2011, an Australian rare-earths mining company, Lynas has expressed their intention to established a plant in Pahang, Malaysia. The decision was highly opposed by local residents who living near the proposed site for the plant together with environmentalist groups and Malaysian opposition parties who has expressed their concerns over fears of radioactive contamination. The Himpunan Hijau (Green Assembly) was then formed in March 2011 to protesting the Lynas rare earth project in Malaysia. Despite the protest, construction of the plant continued and it was granted temporary licence by the Malaysian authorities with the plant began its operation from December for the shipment of rare earth oxides. Four Malaysian cabinet member of parliament (MPs) (responsible for trade, science, natural resources and health) have released a joint statement, saying the temporary licence granted to Lynas requires it to remove \"all the residue\" from the plant out of the country. With the continuous opposition to Lynas operation in the country, several rallies has been held in Kuala Lumpur and 10 other cities in the country, as well as in 34 other countries including during the Bersih 3.0 rally held in 2012. In 2016, the company licence renewed for another three years with a cautious review undertaken by the Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) of Malaysia. === Refugee swap deal === In July 2011, the two countries signed a refugee swap deal with Australia will send 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia and accept 4,000 verified refugees in return from Malaysia. Most of the asylum seekers are from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Sri Lanka and usually travel to Australia through Malaysia or Indonesia. The deal was however rejected and declared illegal by the High Court of Australia the following month over concerns as Malaysia had no legal guarantee to protect the rights of asylum seekers especially when the country are not a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, with many evidence has shown the mistreatment of 93,600 asylum seekers in the country including caning and denial of basic rights to the refugees, who mainly come from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. === Misinterpretation of Xenophon speech by a Malaysian media and subsequent entry denial to Malaysia === In 2012, Australian Senator Nick Xenophon was on a fact-finding mission to Malaysia when he was caught up in anti-government protests in Kuala Lumpur. Subsequently, on 2 May 2012, the New Straits Times published an article written by journalist Roy See Wei Zhi with a title header \"Observer under scrutiny\". The report replaced words from a 2009 speech made by Xenophon and turned it into an attack on Islam, ostensibly to pit Malay-Muslim opinion against the senator, who was a known associate of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. In fact, the speech was actually an attack on scientology with his original speech is recorded in the Hansard of the Australian Senate. Xenophon threatened to sue the newspaper for defamation and as a result the offending article was quickly removed from its website. The gaffe sparked media outrage in both Malaysia and Australia which has greatly reinforced public perception that the media merely serve as propaganda mouthpieces for Malaysia's ruling government of Barisan Nasional against all of its political opponents. The following year on 16 February 2013, Xenophon was detained on arrival at Kuala Lumpur International Airport's LCCT and refused entry by the Malaysian immigration authorities. He was deported back to Australia on a flight early the next day. Other members of Parliament of Australia cancelled their plans to travel to Malaysia while the matter was resolved. The Prime Minister's Department of Malaysia confirmed that Xenophon was not part of the Australian delegation scheduled to meet Parliamentary Affairs Minister Nazri Aziz submitted to it by an aide to Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader in response to claims that it had deliberately denied entry to Xenophon. === Detention of Australian journalists in Malaysia === Two journalists from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) were detained on 13 March 2016, after attempting to question the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak over corruption allegations towards him, notably the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal. == Gallery == File:Labuan-war- cemetery.jpg|Labuan War Cemetery, in Labuan, Malaysia dedicated to Australian and Indian soldiers who died during World War II.
