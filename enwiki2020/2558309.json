George (1878\u20131957), a United States Senator from Georgia, is formed on the Chattahoochee River along the state line between Alabama and Georgia. It is also widely known by the name, Lake Eufaula \u2013 particularly in Alabama, where the state legislature passed a resolution on June 25, 1963, to give the lake that name.Fred Brown, et al., The Riverkeeper's Guide to the Chattahoochee River: From Its Origin at Chattahoochee Gap to Apalachicola Bay (University of Georgia Press, 1997) The 46,000-acre lake extends north about from the Walter F. George Lock and Dam () and has approximately of shoreline. Popular activities along the lake include camping and trophy fishing. The lake is primarily controlled by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The states control several other protected lands along the lake, including the Eufaula National Wildlife Refuge and Lakepoint State Park in Alabama, and Florence Marina and George T. Bagby state parks in Georgia. Panoramic view of the reservoir and the dam The flooding of the land in the area covered numerous historic and prehistoric sites associated with Native American culture. Indigenous peoples had lived along the river for thousands of years. The unincorporated area of Oketeyeconne, Georgia, which historically had a majority of Native American residents, was evacuated in the 1950s to allow creation of the lake. == References == ==External links== *Official website *Visitor's website LWalter F.
