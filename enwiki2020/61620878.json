    "text": "The 2019 Italian government crisis was a political event in Italy that occurred between August and September 2019. It includes the events that follow the announcement of the Minister of the Interior and leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, that he would revoke League's support of the cabinet and ask the President of the Republic to call a snap election. This provoked the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and resulted in the formation of a new cabinet led by Conte himself.Governo, Conte annuncia i ministri: Gualtieri all'Economia, Lamorgese all'Interno, Di Maio agli Esteri. Fraccaro sottosegretario alla presidenza dopo lite col capo politico M5S ==Background== In the 2018 Italian general election, no political group or party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament. On 4 March, the centre- right alliance, in which Matteo Salvini's League emerged as the main political force, won a plurality of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate, while the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) led by Luigi Di Maio became the party with the largest number of votes. The centre-left coalition, led by Matteo Renzi, came third. As a result, protracted negotiations were required before a new government could be formed. The talks between the Five Star Movement and the League resulted in the proposal of the so-called \"government of change\" under the leadership of university professor Giuseppe Conte, a law professor close to the M5S.\"Conte says to be Italians' defence lawyer in govt of change\" . After some bickering with President Sergio Mattarella,\"Mattarella meets Conte, 'vetoed' Savona\" .\"Conte drops govt bid\" . Conte's cabinet, which was dubbed by the media as Western Europe's \"first all- populist government\", was sworn in on 1 June.\"Governo Conte, la lista di tutti i ministri: Salvini all\u2019Interno e Di Maio al Welfare. Saranno vicepremier\" . ===Political crisis=== In August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Salvini announced a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority. Salvini's move came right after a vote in the Senate regarding the progress of the Turin\u2013Lyon high-speed railway, in which the Lega voted against an attempt of the M5S to block the construction works. Many political analysts believe the no confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in Parliament, ensuring Salvini could become the next Prime Minister. On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte harshly accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who \"had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest\", the Prime Minister resigned his post to President Sergio Mattarella. ==Government formation== Conte with President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in August 2019 On 21 August, Mattarella started the consultations with all the parliamentary groups. On the same day, the national direction of the Democratic Party (PD) officially opened to a cabinet with the Five Star Movement, based on pro-Europeanism, green economy, sustainable development, fight against economic inequality and a new immigration policy. However, the talks with President Mattarella resulted in an unclear outcome, thus Mattarella announced a second round of consultation for 27 or 28 August. In days that preceded the second round, a confrontation between PD and M5S started, while the left-wing Free and Equal (LeU) announced that they would support a potential M5S\u2013PD cabinet. On 28 August, PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti announced at the Quirinal Palace his favorable position on forming a new government with the Five Stars with Giuseppe Conte at its head. On same day, Mattarella summoned Conte to the Quirinal Palace for the 29 August to give him the task of forming a new cabinet. ===Approval by M5S membership=== On 1 September, Five Star's founder Beppe Grillo strongly endorsed an alliance with the PD, describing it as a \"unique occasion\" to reform the country. After two days, on 3 September, the members of the Five Star Movement voted on the so-called \"Rousseau Platform\" in favor of an agreement with the Democrats, under the premiership of Giuseppe Conte, with more than 79% of votes out of nearly 80,000 voters. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Choice !Votes !% |- |align=left| Yes||63,146||79.3% |- |align=left| No||16,488||20.7% |- |align=left|Total||79,634||100.0% |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||117,194||68.0% |- |align=left colspan=3| Sources: Associazione Rousseau |- |} === Investiture votes === On 9 September 2019 the Chamber of Deputies granted the confidence to the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against and 3 abstentions.
