A Louisiana Tech loss to Southern Miss the following week gave UAB the outright division title. The Blazers lost 27\u20133 to Middle Tennessee in the final regularly-scheduled game for both teams. ===Middle Tennessee=== At the final week of the regular season, only two teams were in contention to clinch the East Division title, FIU and Middle Tennessee. The Panthers defeated the Blue Raiders on October 13, by three points. That would become the Blue Raiders first loss in conference play. FIU lead the division until their first conference loss against Florida Atlantic, which lead to them and Middle Tennessee to become tie for first place in the East. Both teams continued to win in conference play. For FIU to be crown winners of the division, they would have to win against Marshall, the last game of the Panthers season. The Thundering Herd upset the Panthers 28\u201325, which clinched Middle Tennessee the winners of the East. ===Middle Tennessee vs. UAB series history=== This match up will be the 7th all time meeting against the Blazers and Blue Raiders. They last played each other the week before the game on November 24. Middle Tennessee defeated UAB, the winner of the West Division, 27\u20133. The win secured the Blue Raiders spot to host the 2018 conference title game.
