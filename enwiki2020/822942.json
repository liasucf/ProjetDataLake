It was founded in 1939 as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Commonwealth Coop\u00e9ratif and was led by Romuald-Joseph Lamoureux in the 1944 general election, by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Casgrain from 1951 to 1957 and by Michel Chartrand from 1957 to 1960. The name Parti social d\u00e9mocratique was adopted in 1955. The party was refounded in 1963 as the New Democratic Party of Quebec (Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec), however the party soon split over the issue of Quebec self-determination with Quebec nationalists leaving to form, in November 1963, the Parti socialiste du Qu\u00e9bec led by former PSD leader Michel Chartrand. The NDPQ renamed itself the Parti de la Democratie Socialiste (Party of Socialist Democracy) following a 1991 split with the federal NDP over the question of Quebec independence.Toronto Star, \"NDP will run in future Quebec elections, Mulcair says\", Andy Blatchford, 17 August 2012 ==General election results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
