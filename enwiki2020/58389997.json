It has also been known as Asher-Wyoming Company Wholesale Grocers and as Cheyenne Winlectric Company. It is a flat-roofed two-story dark red brick warehouse building, in plan. It has a one-story, wood frame, shed-roofed addition from 1966 and a one-story, wood frame gable-roofed addition from 1989. With It was deemed notable > because it represents the early twentieth-century commercial activity in > Cheyenne, Wyoming. Cheyenne had its origins as a railroad town created in > 1867 by the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, making it > an important transportation center from its inception. Therefore, its > commercial history was inextricably tied to the railroad. The building at > 1506 Thomes Avenue was constructed in ca. 1914-15 and was provided with its > own railroad siding on the south side, which has been removed. The Colorado > and Southern Railroad laid tracks along the north side of the building; > these have also been removed. However, the Union Pacific Railroad freight > yards are located directly south of West Fifteenth Street, so that the > building retains its physical association with the railroad. The building is > a well- preserved example of early twentieth-century factory/warehouse > architecture and served as a wholesale grocery warehouse from the time it > was built until 1974. ==References== Category:Warehouses Category:National Register of Historic Places in Laramie County, Wyoming Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1914 ",
