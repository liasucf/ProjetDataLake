    "text": "The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1 is a compilation album by American R&B; singer and songwriter Jill Scott, released on August 30, 2011, by Hidden Beach Recordings. It follows the release of her 2011 studio album The Light of the Sun and contains previous unreleased tracks recorded by Scott when she was signed to Hidden Beach. The album was released as a result of the record label's lawsuit against Scott, who left in 2010. The album charted at number 24 on the Billboard 200 and received positive reviews from critics, who applauded the songwriting and song selection. Scott's cover of \"Lovely Day\" was released as a single for the album. == Background == In October 2010, Scott left her former record label Hidden Beach Recordings.Belloni, Matthew (February 7, 2010). Jill Scott Sued By Label. The Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved on 2011-07-01. She was subsequently countersued by Hidden Beach in a complaint that claimed she breached her six-album contract and owed millions of dollars in damages. Hidden Beach founder Steve McKeever said in 2010, \"Scott is contractually required to deliver three more albums to Hidden Beach\". Their complaint's allegation of damages owned cited the California Labor Code's \"De Havilland Law\" section, under which certain recording artists who wish to terminate lengthy recording deals are required to reimburse their labels in the amount the labels would have received under the terms of the contracts. The complaint also alleged that McKeever paid Scott's million- dollar advances when he was not required to, allowed her to keep merchandising revenue, paid $ 450,000 to fund a concert DVD that Scott ultimately asked not to be released, bought her lavish gifts, and allowed her a slower recording schedule for her to pursue an acting career. The lawsuit was settled in 2011, resulting in plans for Hidden Beach releasing an album series of Scott's previously unreleased songs recorded for the label, the first being The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1.Mitchell, Gail (June 24, 2011).
