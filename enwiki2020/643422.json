    "text": "Anti-Australian sentiment (also known as Australophobia or Anti-Australianism) refers to hostile sentiment toward the nation of Australia or its people. == History and use of the term == One of the earliest references to the specific phrase \"Anti-Australian sentiment\" occurred in 1983 in relation to anti- independence groups in New Caledonia. However the term \"anti-Australian\" predates this by decades and by 1949 people in parts of Asia were said to have \"anti-Australian feeling\" over how Australia applied its White Australia policy. In 2006 \"anti-Australian sentiment\" was reported in East Timor. == Indonesia == Indonesia has been alleged to have a rise in \"anti-Australian sentiment\" because of suggestions of Australia interfering with its internal affairs. A 2003 study on Indonesian aspirants for a diplomatic position reported that 95% of them had anti-Australian sentiment. The post-Suharto era period also saw anti-Australian sentiment in Indonesia over East Timor. In Indonesia, it is related to generalised anti-Western sentiment. ==See also== *Australophile *Foreign relations of Australia == References == Australian Category:Foreign relations of Australia ",
