    "text": "The Barlab\u00e1ssy or Barab\u00e1ssy family was a noble family in the Kingdom of Hungary, which possessed landholdings mostly in Transylvania. ==Name== They adopted their surname after their place of origin, Barab\u00e1s in the region Tiszah\u00e1t of Bereg County. Contemporary records and documents preserved the name of family in various formats: Barlabasi (1381), Barrabasi (1384), Barlabasy (1386), Barabassy, Barabasy, Barabassy, Barrabasy (15th century). They were also referred to as \"Barlabaschy\" in Transylvanian Saxon dialect (1487) and \"Barlabassel\" in the register of the University of Vienna (1505), in addition to a Latin Humanist variant \"Barlabassius\" (1519). The first Hungarian-language charter which preserved their name was issued in 1517 by Michael II, who called himself \"Barab\u00e1si\", in accordance with its pronunciation (but the document itself was preserved only through a 18th- century transcription). By the time of the Principality of Transylvania in the 17th century, their last name was uniformly formed as \"Barab\u00e1ssy\". Throughout the centuries, they also used various noble titles, which implied their residence, ownership of lands or location. Their first nobility prefix appeared in contemporary documents in the 1450s (according to today's spelling): \"de Petlend\", \"de M\u00f3cs\" and \"de Szentp\u00e1l\". Later the variants \"de Csesztve\" (1470s) and \"de H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja\" (1490s) became more frequent. After the division of the landholdings, other prefixes were appeared in the 16th century: \"de Alpar\u00e9t\", \"de Cs\u00edkfalva\", \"de Ny\u00e1r\u00e1dt\u0151 et L\u0151rincfalva\" and \"de Makfalva\" (after locations, present-day all in Romania). ==Origins== According to family traditions, the Barlab\u00e1ssys descended from the influential and wealthy gens (clan) Borsa, but there is no contemporary record of that. The family originated from the region Beregi-Tiszah\u00e1t (today roughly Szabolcs- Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County in Hungary), where Barab\u00e1s (or Barlab\u00e1s) also located. The assumption that the family came from Barlab\u00e1s, Maros Seat (present-day B\u00e2rliba\u0219 in Romania) is unfounded. The earliest known member of the family was one Nicholas Barlab\u00e1si (), whose sons \u2013 Ladislaus, Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n, Ivan and Nicholas \u2013 were mentioned together in February 1323. They owned a portion of land and a stone church in P\u00e1troha. They were involved in a lawsuit with castellan Paul Magyar, who was granted the village as a royal donation by Charles I of Hungary. The brothers and Magyar reconciled with each other and the Barlab\u00e1ssys handed over their estates for 20 marks. The four brothers also owned Petlend (near present-day Szatm\u00e1rcseke) in 1327, when they entered into a defense contract with each other. Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n was again mentioned in 1329, when appeared as a witness in a lawsuit. While Ladislaus and Nicholas (II) had no known descendants, Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n had two sons; Barabbas acted as royal commissioner (bailiff) in two occasions in 1374 and 1378, during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary. The younger one, George entered ecclesiastical career and was styled with the title of \"magister\". He served in the chancellery of the queen mother Elizabeth of Poland. After the death of Louis I, he entered the service of his widow Elizabeth of Bosnia, who acted as regent on behalf of her daughter Queen Mary. George was referred to as \"special notary and familiaris\" of the dowager queen in 1384. Elizabeth confirmed the previous land donation of Kissur\u00e1ny to the brothers in 1382. George and Barabbas presumably became disgraced by 1386; Queen Elizabeth confiscated Kissur\u00e1ny from them and returned it to their original owner Nicholas Kissur\u00e1nyi. This resulted a conflict between the two families in the upcoming decade. Ladislaus Kissur\u00e1nyi complained before the convent of Lelesz (present-day Leles, Slovakia) in 1394 that Barabbas' sons, John, Ladislaus and Francis constantly looted and pillaged his land. They also joined the nationwide rebellion against King Sigismund in 1403, as a result much of their possessions were confiscated, including J\u00e1nd and their ancient seat Barab\u00e1s, which was shared by several families in the 15th century. The brother regained some reliance in the royal court, John and Ladislaus were referred to royal vassals (\"homo noster\") in 1418. They had no known descendants, which resulted the extinction of Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n's branch. Nicholas' another son Ivan had a daughter Anne, who married a certain Peter, who possessed lands in Szabolcs County. His son Michael (I) died by 1398; his widow, a certain Veronica complained that Lawrence Mikai harassed her estates. As a result, Sigismund forced Mikai to pledge his land of Papos to the Barlab\u00e1ssys in that year, which resulted a long-lasting lawsuit between the two families in the 15th century. The marriage of Michael and Veronica produced two sons, Ernye, who served as vice-isp\u00e1n of Bereg County in 1389, and Vincent, who was referred to as \"homo noster\" in 1416. At the end of his life, he was also vice-isp\u00e1n of Bereg County from 1434 to 1439, as a familiaris of Ladislaus P\u00e1l\u00f3ci. The later members of the Barlab\u00e1ssy family descended from Ernye. The last person, who had relative influence in the place of their origin was John (the grandson of Vincent), who functioned as vice- isp\u00e1n of Szabolcs County from 1454 to 1456. ==Advance in Transylvania== In the first half of the 15th century, the Barlab\u00e1ssy family had several lawsuits with their neighbors, for instance the Mikai and Per\u00e9nyi families in Bereg and Szabolcs counties which contributed to the family gradually moving southeast in a direction to Transylvania. After the ancient lands in the Bereg region were permanently lost to their rivals, the Barlab\u00e1ssys acquired possessions along the river Maros (Mure\u0219) in Central Transylvania, first of all at Inner and Outer Szolnok, Doboka, Kolozs and Torda counties, and later Feh\u00e9r and K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 counties, and the Sz\u00e9kely seat of Marossz\u00e9k (\"Maros Seat\"). By the reign of Matthias Corvinus, they became familiares of the powerful B\u00e1thory family, one of the most influential and richest noble houses in Transylvania. Ernye's grandson John married his second wife, Veronica Harangl\u00e1bi, an offspring of a rich Transylvanian family, sometime after 1440. As a dowry, John acquired portions in Kolozs and K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 counties \u2013 including M\u00f3cs (Mociu) \u2013, and the Barlab\u00e1ssy family gradually became part of the Transylvanian elite in the second half of the 15th century. John had two sons, Michael and John. They together acquired Csesztve (today part of Ocna Mure\u0219 town in Romania) and the surrounding lands by the 1450s. They built a country-house there, which became the permanent residence of the Barlab\u00e1ssys. The Csesztve lordship laid along an important trade route near the river Maros and the salt mines of Maros\u00fajv\u00e1r (Ocna Mure\u0219). In the subsequent years, they also bought Csombord (Ciumbrud), V\u00e1radja (Oarda), Lomfalva and Marosszentkir\u00e1ly (S\u00e2ncraiu de Mure\u0219). In Kolozs County, the Petlend branch also possessed lands, its members were Anthony and George, but their family relationship to the other branches is uncertain. Both of them only had daughters (Magdalene and Agatha, respectively), and the country-house of Petlend along the river Tur was alienated to the Borz family (the kinship of Anthony's widow). Around the same time, another member of the family (parentage is unknown), Nicholas Barlab\u00e1ssy de Szentp\u00e1l became a prominent landowner in Sz\u00e9kely Land, which resulted a basis for the future expansion in Marossz\u00e9k. He also integrated into the Sz\u00e9kely aristocracy (\"chief horsemen\"). Nicholas had three children: Michael, Dorothea and Julianna. Michael died by 1463, left behind a widow and two orphans, Nicholas and Anne. The unidentified widow was involved in a lawsuit against her sisters-in-law, refusing to the transfer of the property to which they are entitled in their late brother's last will. Dorothea married Ladislaus Demj\u00e9nfy, while Julia was the wife of Blaise Meggyes de Szentgy\u00f6rgy, who was involved in a nationwide conspiracy against Matthias in 1467. Julianna continued her lawsuit against her nephew Nicholas and niece Anna (wife of Pancras Bolyai). Julianna had a daughter, also Anne, who married Nicholas T\u00f3t de Szentanna. The Barlab\u00e1ssy de Szentp\u00e1l branch died out with Nicholas around 1493, but the lawsuit between the two branches were inherited by the two Anne's husbands and their families (the Bolyai and T\u00f3t kinships), lasted until 1502. ==Heyday== John was made castellan of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r by King Matthias Corvinus sometime after 1467. In the 1470s, Barlab\u00e1ssy entered the service of Stephen B\u00e1thory, a respected military general and Voivode of Transylvania. He participated in various campaigns and counter-attacks in response to the Ottoman incursions. As castellan of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Barlab\u00e1ssy was a dedicated patron of arts and sciences. He helped to spread Renaissance arts, science and architecture throughout Transylvania. The Csesztve and H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja branch descended from castellan John, as his brother Michael (died before 1482) had no known children from his spouse Sophia Szentp\u00e1li. It is plausible that John married an unidentified noblewoman from the wealthy Erd\u00e9lyi de Somker\u00e9k family. Their marriage produced three sons, John, Leonard and Michael. He also adopted John L\u00e1szai, a noted Humanist poet and clergyman. Among his three natural sons, Michael had no known descendants. He was referred to as vice- chamberlain of the salt chamber of Sz\u00e9k (Sic) in 1512. He was among the councillors of Voivode John Z\u00e1polya in January 1514. He was styled a \"homo noster\" in March 1517, during a lawsuit against Stephen K\u00e1rolyi in March 1517. He issued a Hungarian-language contract in 1517, the first such regarding the Barlab\u00e1ssy family and also a somewhat noted text of the history of the Hungarian language before the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1526). ===Csesztve branch=== The eldest son, John inherited the country-house at Csesztve. Until the end of the 15th century, John and Leonard acquired possessions together, for instance Mikl\u00f3slaka (Mico\u0219laca), H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja (Idrifaia) and Mikefalva (Mica), laid in K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 County. They remained familiares of the powerful B\u00e1thory family, which was exploited to their advantage in the rapid growth of their wealth. John married twice; his second wife was Magdalene Erd\u00e9lyi from 1505 (the widow of Francis V\u00edzaknai). It is possible that he was castellan of G\u00f6rg\u00e9ny (today Gurghiu, Romania) in 1504. John died not long before December 1512, when his lord John Z\u00e1polya provided for the division of his landholdings in accordance with his last will and testament. The document says, John owned possessions in Alpar\u00e9t (Bob\u00e2lna), where a county-house laid, Z\u00e1pr\u00f3c (B\u0103bdiu), Sz\u00f3v\u00e1ros (Suar\u0103\u0219), T\u00e1losfalva (Blid\u0103re\u0219ti), Antos (Ant\u0103\u0219), Erd\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely (O\u0219orhel), Rad\u00e1kszinye (R\u0103zbuneni) and Bujdos (V\u00e2lcelele) in Inner Szolnok County, present-day all settlements belong to the town of Bob\u00e2lna. Beside that, John also possessed portions in M\u00f3cs, Gy\u00e9res (C\u00e2mpia Turzii), Csehtelke (Vi\u0219inelu), B\u00e1ld (Balda), Nagynyulas (Mila\u0219), Kissz\u00e9k (S\u0103c\u0103laia), Aranyk\u00fat (Aruncuta) and Szentm\u00e1rton (Gligore\u0219ti) in Kolozs County, portions in Gerebenes, Kapus (C\u0103pu\u0219u Mare), P\u00f3ka (P\u0103ingeni), Ikland (Icland), Lekence (Lechin\u021ba), Kem\u00e9nytelke (Cip\u0103ieni), Bodon (Papiu Ilarian), Szak\u00e1l (S\u0103calu de P\u0103dure), Pagocsa (Pog\u0103ceaua), Z\u00e1h (Zau de C\u00e2mpie), F\u0171zk\u00fat (S\u0103lcu\u021ba) in Torda County, in addition to whole Mikl\u00f3slaka and portions in Csesztve, Benkeszeg, \u00d3zd (Ozd), T\u00e1t\u00e9 (Totoi), Bag\u00f3 (B\u0103g\u0103u), Csongva (Uioara de Jos), Marosszentkir\u00e1ly, Ol\u00e1htordos (Turda\u0219) and Isp\u00e1nlaka (\u0218p\u0103lnaca) in Feh\u00e9r County. John and his unidentified first wife had five children. The eldest one Michael inherited the estate of Alpar\u00e9t with its country-house and accessories in 1512, in addition to Csesztve, which was shared with his brother, Bishop John, the most illustrious member of the branch. Michael married Catherine B\u00e1nffy de Losoncz, they lived in Alpar\u00e9t, establishing a namesake sub-branch. The second son, Bishop John was able to attend foreign universities due to his uncle Leonard's wealth and influence. John belonged to the Humanist circle centered around Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. As a loyal partisan of King John Z\u00e1polya, he served as de facto the last Bishop of Csan\u00e1d between 1537 and 1552, before the Ottoman Empire conquered the southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the whole territory of the diocese. John's third son Gregory died young, sometime before 1512. The daughters Catherine and Sophia (also Margaret) became the spouses of Transylvanian nobles, Sigismund Szarvasdi and Oswald Bog\u00e1ti de Radn\u00f3t, respectively. Sometime after his first wife' death, the elderly John married Magdalene Erd\u00e9lyi in 1505; they had two sons Francis and John. There were still minors during their father's death in 1512. Through a marriage, Francis acquired lands in Cs\u00edkfalva (V\u0103rgata), becoming a member of the local Sz\u00e9kely elite. He was involved in various lawsuits against his much older step-brother Bishop John. Among John's children, only Michael had descendants; the marriage of Michael and Catherine B\u00e1nffy produced a son, Michael. As he died early in 1516, the child was raised by his uncle Bishop John and his mother's second husband Ladislaus Koz\u00e1rv\u00e1ri (from 1517). Michael married Catherine Tomori, daughter of Stephen Tomori, the Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1523 to 1526 and from 1528 to 1531, and niece of Paul Tomori, commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, where he was killed. Michael and his wife also lived in Alpar\u00e9t. Their only son, Francis was also born there around 1540. After his father died in 1555, Francis became the last offspring of the Barlab\u00e1ssy's Csesztve branch, inheriting large-scale landholdings throughout Transylvania and Sz\u00e9kely Land (including Cs\u00edkfalva, owned by his namesake great-uncle). Francis supported the policy of John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya, King-elect of Hungary and later the first Prince of Transylvania. Under his influence, Barlab\u00e1ssy was one of those Transylvanian lords, who converted to Unitarianism from Roman Catholicism in the 1560s. After the death of John Sigismund, he was a partisan of Caspar Bekes, a claimant to the Transylvanian throne against Stephen B\u00e1thory. After B\u00e1thory's victory, Francis lost all political influence. He had an unidentified wife and children. He was slaughtered together with his family in 1599 during the Long Turkish War, thus the Csesztve branch became extinct. ===H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja branch=== Leonard was the most illustrious member of the Barlab\u00e1ssy family, who served as Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1501 to 1525, as a familiaris of the B\u00e1thory family then John Z\u00e1polya. He and his elder brother John acquired several lands across Transylvania (see above). He built a Renaissance-style country-house in H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja in 1508, which was elevated into the status of his official residence. Based on the sources, it is plausible that he bought the portions of his brothers and exclusively owned the settlement alone by that time. After John Z\u00e1polya was appointed voivode in 1510, Leonard became a member of his inner advisory council. He participated in the suppression of the 1514 peasant revolt, led by George D\u00f3zsa. He was also known to have been a patron of arts, who contributed significantly to the spread of the Renaissance in Transylvania. He bequeathed different sums to several ecclesiastical institutions and monasteries. Art historian Jol\u00e1n Balogh emphasized the country-house of H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja is the earliest surviving Renaissance-style building in the province of Transylvania, excluding the reconstructions of some royal castles. Leonard married Margaret Bog\u00e1ti de Radn\u00f3t. Their marriage produces five children: John, Leonard, Catherine, Magdalene and Sophia. After the death of his first wife at an unknown time, he married Magdalene Ger\u00e9b de Ving\u00e1rt. They had four children: Anne, Farkas, Barbara and Euphrosyne. Barlab\u00e1sy's daughters were engaged to local nobles from prominent families. For instance, Magdalene became the wife of Gregory Erd\u00e9lyi de Somker\u00e9k, while Sophia married to Nicholas III V\u00edzaknai. Leonard provided for the proper education of his sons; in his last will he forbade his adult sons \u2013 John and Leonard \u2013 not to interrupt their university studies in any way. John attended the University of Krak\u00f3w in 1527, and was a schoolmate of J\u00e1nos Sylvester. John and Leonard were still alive in 1554. John had two sons, Caspar and Francis, members of the so-called K\u00e1polna sub-branch. They were involved in a lawsuit with their cousin Leonard, son of Leonard in 1560. Caspar was a supporter of John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya. He was present at Fogaras (F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219) in 1566, as a member of the retinue of Sz\u00e9kely captain Paul B\u00e1nffy de Losoncz, who took over the castle from Gregory Apafi. Caspar lived in K\u00e1polna (C\u0103p\u00e2lna de Sus, 2km near H\u00e9derf\u00e1ja), while Francis owned Somostelke (\u0218omo\u0219telnic) by 1580. Vice-voivode Leonard's youngest son Farkas was born from his second marriage. In 1544, he owned portions in Ikland, Szak\u00e1l, Kem\u00e9nytelke and Cs\u00fcd\u0151telke (Cu\u0219telnic), which he donated to his sister Anne and her husband. The Makfalva sub-branch descended from Leonard, the grandson of vice-voivode Leonard. He possessed portions in Sz\u00e9lk\u00fat (S\u0103lcud) and P\u00e1nc\u00e9lcseh (Panticeu). He married twice; his first wife was unidentified, while his second wife was the wealthy Helena Csoronk de Nagylak, the widow of Ambrose Mosdossy. They had two daughters (Margaret and Drusiana) and a son (Stephen). Leonard and Helena bought the whole part of Papfalva (Pope\u0219ti). Leonard and his family lived in his wife's inherited country-house at Nagylak (N\u0103dlac). Leonard was pledged a portion in Csekelaka (Cec\u0103laca) by John Horv\u00e1th de K\u00e1ptalan in 1590. Leonard was a confidant of Prince Sigismund B\u00e1thory. He was sent as an envoy to the court of Ieremia Movil\u0103, Prince of Moldavia in 1598. His task was to free Michael Jere de Csics\u00f3 and John Sim\u00f3 from the captivity at Suceava. ==In the Principality of Transylvania== By the early 17th century, only two sub- branches remained from vice-voivode Leonard's offspring. The youngest son Farkas had a namesake son. Farkas (II) was a courtly familiaris of John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya. For his military service, he was granted land donations in Marossz\u00e9k and L\u0151rincfalva (Leordeni) in 1566. The latter place became his main residence. John Sigismund also donated Ny\u00e1r\u00e1dt\u0151 (Ungheni) and another portions in L\u0151rincfalva in 1570. Following the death of John Sigismund, he supported the aspirations of Stephen B\u00e1thory. He fought in the Battle of Kerel\u0151szentp\u00e1l in 1575, where B\u00e1thory defeated his rival Caspar Bekes (Farkas' distant relative Francis supported the pretender, but missed the battle itself). During the voivodeship of Christopher B\u00e1thory, Farkas served as royal judge of Marossz\u00e9k around 1580. Farkas had four children from his unidentified wife: Michael, Elizabeth, Catherine and Peter. The latter served as lieutenant of Marossz\u00e9k banderium. In 1595, he acquired noble estate at Sz\u00e9kelyv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely. As a partisan of Sigismund B\u00e1thory, he participated in the Battle of Temesv\u00e1r in 1597, when the prince laid siege the town, held by Emperor Rudolph, but he lifted the siege when an Ottoman army of 20,000 strong approached the fortress. During the siege, Peter was wounded his chest by a bullet, leading his regiment. Farkas' daughter Catherine married Ladislaus Dacz\u00f3 de Sepsiszentgy\u00f6rgy in 1599. Her second husband was the former Transylvanian chancellor Simon P\u00e9chi (from 1624), who was imprisoned for his Sabbatarianism. His lands were also confiscated and he was forced to return Protestantism in 1639 by Prince George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. Simon P\u00e9chi and Catherine lived modestly near the village of Kebele (S\u00e2ni\u0219or). P\u00e9chi died in 1643. Thereafter, Catherine was involved in a lawsuit with the daughters of P\u00e9chi from his first marriage over property matters. Prince Michael I Apafi issued an interrogation order against Catherine in 1665, but she died in the next year. Later members of the Barlab\u00e1ssy family descended from the Makfalva branch. Stephen, the son of Leonard (III) acquired Sz\u00e9kely noble title, when obtained the estate of Makfalva (Ghindari) through his unidentified wife. After General Giorgio Basta invaded Transylvania, Stephen was among those nobles of Marossz\u00e9k, who swore loyalty to Emperor-King Rudolph in 1602. His grandsons, George and Francis were still styled as prominent nobles from the region in 1636, during the reign of Prince George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. George's son Stephen participated in George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's disastrous campaign against Poland in 1657.
