While in office, he was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

He was one of the organizers of the West Side Savings Bank of New York City and served as its president for many years; subsequently he became president of the Aetna Fire Insurance Co., of Hartford, Connecticut and served until its dissolution in 1880.
