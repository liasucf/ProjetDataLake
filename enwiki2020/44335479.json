    "text": "Vibes is the second studio album by American rapper Theophilus London. The album was released on November 4, 2014, by Warner Bros. Records. The album features guest appearances from Leon Ware, Kanye West, Jesse Boykins III, Soko, Devonte Hynes and Force MDs. The album was supported by the single \"Tribe\". ==Background== In November 2014, in an interview with Nah Right, he spoke about how long it took to make the album, saying: \"Two years. The first six months I would say I started the early production meetings with the people I wanted to work with. This album is like my very first album because nobody from the label or nobody said, \u201cYo, go write with this person.\u201d This is all pre-thought like, \u201cWho do I want to pick and start the ideas with?\u201d When it comes to making music I'm very timid. I'm not nervous but I'm very timid. I know that I have to do good. Without Kanye's name attached to it, trust me I would have put out a raw as fuck album and people would be like, \u201cYo let\u2019s go, let\u2019s do this!\u201d That's me, I'm going to build a vibe and go. So the people I got to work with really shaped the album.\" He also spoke about Kanye West executive producing the album, saying: \"It\u2019s super special. He doesn\u2019t executive produce nobody\u2019s album. He just do features. And in the next few years he\u2019s just focused on Yeezy season and nobody\u2019s going to drop an album when he does [laughs] and I\u2019m going to be super irrelevant. I\u2019m glad my album came out right now and not when his album is about to come out. It\u2019s dope though. It\u2019s like sometimes I want to pinch myself. It\u2019s one of those moments man. It\u2019s like if I were to work with Michael Jackson and shit. I\u2019m happy I get to do business with people, I know people can\u2019t listen to my album in one day and have 700+ replies to me saying, \u201cThis is the most incredible album of the year, 10/10.\u201d I get more people excited that one of the highest brow artists and one of the lowest brow artists meet up. People are excited about that, that's dope for me\u2013that Kanye would work with a kid like me, that's a great message.\" ==Singles== On September 2, 2014, the album's first single \"Tribe\" featuring Jesse Boykins III was released. On November 4, 2014, the music video was released for \"Tribe\" featuring Jesse Boykins III. ==Critical response== Vibes received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 71, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 6 reviews. Scott Simpson of Exclaim! said, \"Does Vibes serve as the great artistic outlet London makes it out to be? No. But what the album does have going for it is its overarching aesthetic: It's an album that has a nice enough groove throughout, and again, the quality of the production really cannot be overstated. Maybe London should have let the album speak for itself.\" Steven Goldstein of HipHopDX said, \"Time off, a tighter central theme and spirited assists from some legendary producers makes Theophilus London\u2019s second full-length his best yet. What\u2019s being escaped is up to you, but Vibes succeeds in getting its listener to flourish in a world of champagne toasts, faceless women and impulsive dancing.\" Eli Schwadron of XXL stated, \"Theophilus London\u2019s musical ability is evident throughout Vibes, a mesh-mash of genres that come together to form one of the better listenings of 2014. The album sounds like a bit of a throwback at times, yet London makes it feel new at the same time. He poses a dual threat\u2014singer/rapper\u2014which results in wider appeal. Vibes is a breath of fresh air.\" ==Track listing== Credits adapted from London's official website. ;Notes * signifies a co-producer. * signifies an arranger. ;Sample credits * \"Neu Law\" contains a portion of the composition \u201cThe Law\u201d written by John Maus as performed by John Maus. * \"Take and Look\" contains a portion of the composition \u201cTake a Look\u201d written by Alain Seghir, Brigitte Balian, and Catherine Loy as performed by Martin Dupont. * \"Can't Stop\" contains a portion of the composition \u201cYou Can't Stop My Love\u201d written by Alain Seghir, Brigitte Balian, and Catherine Loy as performed by Martin Dupont. * \"Figure It Out\" contains a portion of the composition \u201cWhat You Want\u201d written by Mason Betha, Sean Combs, Curtis Mayfield, Nashiem Myrick, and Keisha Spivey as performed by Mase from album Harlem World. ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. * Theophilus London \u2014 A&R;, composer, creative director, creative producer, lyricist, primary artist, producer, vocals * Kanye West \u2014 arranger, composer, executive producer, featured artist * Leon Ware \u2014 composer, creative producer, featured artist, producer * 88-Keys \u2014 composer, producer * Virgil Abloh \u2014 creative director * Pierre Baigorry \u2014 producer * Brigitte Balian \u2014 composer * Brittany Barber \u2014 composer, vocals * Miri Ben-Ari \u2014 composer, string arrangements, strings, violin, violin arrangement * Mason Betha \u2014 composer * Jesse Boykins III \u2014 composer, featured artist * Brodinski \u2014 composer, producer * Cid Rim \u2014 producer * Club Cheval \u2014 composer, producer * Sean Combs \u2014 composer * Paul Falcone \u2014 mixing * Norman Feels\u2014 composer * Jeff Fenster \u2014 A&R; * The Force M.D.'s \u2014 composer, featured artist * Devont\u00e9 Hynes \u2014 composer, featured artist * Anthony Killhoffer \u2014 mixing * Karl Lagerfeld \u2014 art direction, photography * Catherine Loy \u2014 composer * John Maus \u2014 composer * Curtis Mayfield \u2014 composer * Jack Minihan \u2014 A&R; * Mike Moore \u2014 composer * Nashiem Myrick \u2014 composer * Adam Pavao \u2014 composer, producer * Kyle Ross \u2014 mixing assistant * Sarah Ruba \u2014 composer * Alain Seghir \u2014 composer * James Smith \u2014 composer * Soko \u2014 composer, featured artist * Keisha Spivey \u2014 composer * Andrew Watt \u2014 composer ==References== Category:2014 albums Category:Albums produced by 88-Keys Category:Warner Records albums Category:Theophilus London albums ",
