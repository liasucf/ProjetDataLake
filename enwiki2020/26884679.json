He became known on a wider scale for the photo of him taken moments before he was shot by Chetniks who captured him, showing him with shackles on his hands and smiling. He is a recipient of the Order of the People's Hero, a Yugoslav medal for gallantry. He is commonly referred to by media as \"Yugoslav Che Guevara\". == Biography == He was born in 1913 in Argentina, one of the ten children in an immigrant working-class Montenegrin family. His parents were Sava and Stana (n\u00e9e Buri\u0107) from the village of Zagara\u010d. One of his brothers was Vukan \u010cupi\u0107, a famous pediatrician who founded the \u201aMother and Child Institute\u2019, pediatric clinic in Belgrade. During the 1930s, he moved to Nik\u0161i\u0107, where he finished high school. He studied law at the University of Belgrade, and was a member of a progressive student movement, and joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1940. After the invasion of Yugoslavia he returned to Nik\u0161i\u0107 and participated in the preparation of the uprising. In July 1941, he fled from the Nazi-occupied city and joined the partisan division \"\u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107\", formed by communists and SKOJ members who had also escaped from Nik\u0161i\u0107. As a commissioner of the Partisan movement in Nik\u0161i\u0107, he was captured by Chetniks in April 1942, after a battle on Kablena Glavica near Nik\u0161i\u0107. He was tortured in prison and was subject to a public trial by the ad hoc court composed by the Chetniks. He was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad following an illegal and rigged trial. Before his public execution he cheered his friends and the people who were forced to witness the event. Among his last word was the slogan \"Long live the glorious Communist Party.\" == Legacy == He was posthumously declared a people's hero by decree of the Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito on 10 July 1953. In memory of Ljubo \u010cupi\u0107, a street in Zagori\u010d, a neighborhood of Podgorica, has been named after him.Yugoslav lexicon - Ljubo \u010cupi\u0107 ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Yugoslav communists Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Montenegrin soldiers Category:Montenegrin people of World War II Category:People from Nik\u0161i\u0107 Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Law alumni Category:Deaths by firearm in Montenegro Category:American people of Montenegrin descent Category:American people executed abroad Category:Montenegrin communists Category:Executed Montenegrin people ",
