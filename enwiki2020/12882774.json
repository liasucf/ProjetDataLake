Always a Country station, the station's first call sign was WCNV, which was assigned on January 16, 1981 and officially launched on January 27 with the branding \"FM 108 WCNV.\" The station was co-owned with AM 1420 WAMVBroadcasting Yearbook 1982 page C-245 WCNV was powered at only 4,100 watts, so it primarily served its own community and wasn't aimed at the larger Roanoke-Lynchburg market.

WCNV switched its call sign to WYYD at midnight on November 18, 1985 and changed its branding to \"108 WYYD; Today's Best Country and Your All-Time Favorites.\" The power had been increased to 20,500 watts on a 1,767 foot tower, making it a regional country station for the larger Roanoke-Lynchburg market.Broadcasting Yearbook 1987 page B-295 In 1994, the station was sold to Benchmark Communications for $9 million and the studios were moved to Lynchburg.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1997 page B-464 In 1999, the station changed hands again, this time to Capstar Broadcasting, which later became AMFM Broadcasting, a forerunner to current owner, iHeartMedia.
