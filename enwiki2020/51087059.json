The \"Wetlands Singing at Night\" is currently one of the city's Eight Sights. 141 known species of migrant birds visit the wetlands each year. In the summer, water lilies cover the entire surface of the area. In addition, fish, shrimp, and crabs live throughout the park, as do lotus, bananas, and sugarcane. To avoid disturbing the birds, visitors by boat are limited to 150 per day. The park abuts the city's port and industries including steel, shipbuilding, and petrochemicals. The people of Guangzhou once swam in the Pearl River but at its worst pollution has turned its waters black and putrid. In 2009\u201310, municipal leaders spent $6,000,000,000 on treatment and a massive refinery (a joint venture between Sinopec and the Kuwait Petroleum Co.) was relocated out of Nansha District, which municipal planners aim to make 50% forest, grass, or wetlands. ==Transportation== The nearest Guangzhou Metro station is Jiaomen Station.. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * . ==External links== * \"\u5357\u6c99\u6e7f\u5730\u516c\u56ed\" at Baidu Baike * \"\u5357\u6c99\u6e7f\u5730\u516c\u56ed\" at Baike.com Category:Protected areas of China ",
