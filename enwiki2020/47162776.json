    "text": "The 2015 Costa Rican Cup (known as Torneo de Copa Banco Popular for sponsorship reasons) is the 3rd staging of the Costa Rican Cup. The competition began on July 4 and finished on November 19 with the final at the Estadio Nacional. The cup featured 20 teams, composed of all 12 teams of the FPD and 8 from the Liga de Ascenso. Originally, teams from the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Aficionado were expected to participate as well, but were withdrawn due to lack of budget. The format of the tournament marked several differences to that of its predecessor, such as the lack of a group stage (similar to the 2013 edition), and the addition of a \"best loser\" rule, in which a team could still qualify to a further round, despite having lost a match. The tournament saw the defending champions Cartagin\u00e9s earning a second title by defeating Herediano in the final. ==Qualified teams== The following teams were announced to participate in the 2015 Costa Rican Cup: 12 teams from the 2015\u201316 FPD: *Alajuelense *Bel\u00e9n *Carmelita *Cartagin\u00e9s *Herediano *Municipal Liberia *Lim\u00f3n *P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n *Santos de Gu\u00e1piles *Saprissa *Universidad de Costa Rica *Uruguay de Coronado 8 teams from the 2014\u201315 Liga de Ascenso: *AS Puma Generale\u00f1a *Aserr\u00ed *Barrio M\u00e9xico *Cariari *Escazuce\u00f1a *Guanacasteca *Osa *Turrialba ==Bracket== ==First round== The draw for the first round was held on 26 June 2015. ===Matches=== ==Second round== The draw for the second round was held on 6 July 2015. ===Matches=== ==Third round== ===First leg=== ===Second leg=== ==Semi-finals== ===First leg=== ===Second leg=== ==Final== ==References== Category:Costa Rican Cup Category:2015\u201316 in Costa Rican football ",
