    "text": "Looking East is the eleventh album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1996 (see 1996 in music). It peaked at number 36 on The Billboard 200. ==History== Coming over two years after his successful I'm Alive, Browne returned to more politically and socially oriented themes on Looking East. Only two songs are credited to Browne alone as composer, the rest co-credited with his core backing band. Guests include Bonnie Raitt, David Crosby, Vonda Shepard, Ry Cooder, Waddy Wachtel and David Lindley. ==Reception== Looking East was considered somewhat of a letdown after the success of I'm Alive even after reaching the Top 40 of The Billboard 200. Critic William Ruhlman agreed, writing that the album \"is a highly referential work from an artist who started where most end and has been earnestly seeking the right direction ever since. Looking East finds him in his own backyard, still searching.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Jackson Browne \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar (2), guitar (5, 10), piano (9) * Beth Anderson \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Suzie Benson \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Sir Harry Bowens \u2013 harmony vocals (5) * Severin Browne \u2013 harmony vocals (9) *Jorge Calder\u00f3n \u2013 harmony vocals (8), Spanish vocals (8) * Mark Campbell \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Mike Campbell \u2013 12 string guitar (2), guitar (5) * Katia Cardenal \u2013 Spanish vocals (8) * Salvador Cardenal \u2013 Spanish vocals (8) * Valerie Carter \u2013 harmony vocals (8, 10) * Luis Conte \u2013 percussion (1\u201310) * Ry Cooder \u2013 slide guitar (7) * David Crosby \u2013 harmony vocals (9) * Ren\u00e9e Geyer \u2013 harmony vocals (7) * Jim Gilstrap \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Mark Goldenberg \u2013 guitar (1, 2, 3, 5\u201310), electric guitar (4), oud (4) * William Greene Jr. \u2013 harmony vocals (5) * Jim Haas \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Jon Joyce \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Kipp Lennon \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Mauricio \"Fritz\" Lewak \u2013 drums (1\u201310) * David Lindley \u2013 lap steel guitar (3) * Kevin McCormick \u2013 acoustic guitar (1, 2), bass guitar (1\u201310), harmony vocals (4, 10) * Phil Perry \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Bonnie Raitt \u2013 harmony vocals (7) * Vonda Shepard \u2013 harmony vocals (1, 9) * Sally Stevens \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Benmont Tench \u2013 Hammond organ (1) * Scott Thurston \u2013 guitar (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9), harmony vocals (2, 3, 4, 6), electric guitar (4), baritone guitar (5, 10), piano (8) * Mark Vieha \u2013 backing vocals (4), BGV arrangement (4) * Waddy Wachtel \u2013 guitar (1) * Jeffrey Young \u2013 Hammond organ (2\u201310), harmony vocals (3, 5, 10), backing vocals (4), keyboards (10) ==Production== * Producers \u2013 Kevin McCormick and Scott Thurston * Engineer \u2013 Paul Dieter * Assistant Engineers \u2013 Sebastian Haimerl and Bob Salcedo * Mixing \u2013 Ed Cherney * Mastered by Gavin Lurssen and Doug Sax at The Matering Lab (Hollywood, CA). * Technicians \u2013 Bill Irvin and Ed Wong * Piano Technician \u2013 Edd Kolakowski * Art Direction and Design \u2013 Jackson Browne * Photography \u2013 Dianna Cohen, Rob Gilley, Nels Israelson and Frank W.
