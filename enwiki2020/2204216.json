    "text": "A 19th century community of the M\u00e9tis people of Canada, the Anglo-M\u00e9tis, more commonly known as Countryborn, were children of fur traders; they typically had Scots (Orcadian, mainland Scottish), or English fathers and Aboriginal mothers.Brown, J. S. H. (1985). \u201cDiverging identities: The Presbyterian M\u00e9tis of St. Gabriel Street, Montreal.\u201d In Peterson, J. & Brown, J. (eds.) The New Peoples: Being and Becoming M\u00e9tis in North America (pp. 195-206). Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press. They were also known as \"English halfbreeds.\" Some Anglo-Metis still identify by this name.Adams, C., Peach, I., Dahl, G. (eds.) (2013). M\u00e9tis in Canada: History, Identity, Law & Politics. Edmonton: University of Alberta Press. Their first languages were generally those of their mothers: Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc. and English. Some of their fathers spoke Gaelic or Scots, leading to the development of the creole language known as \"Bungee\".Blain, Eleanor M. (1989). The Bungee dialect of the Red River settlement. (MA thesis, University of Manitoba). Some scholars have started spelling M\u00e9tis as \"Metis\" to acknowledge the presence and contributions of the Anglo-M\u00e9tis and the complex history of the M\u00e9tis people overall.Macdougall, B., Podruchny, C., & St-Onge, N.

There also some records of Anglo-M\u00e9tis families descending from relationships between British soldiers and Indigenous women of various tribes. They tended to identify more with the politically and economically dominant British culture of Canada at this time. If they were descended from Scottish fur traders and Indigenous women, they were often baptized as part of the Presbyterian church if their fathers chose to acknowledge their existence. Case studies have been done on the birth and baptism registers at the St. Gabriel Street Presbyterian Church in Montreal because it provides a good example of how M\u00e9tis children adjusted to staying temporarily or living in an urban environment that was considerably foreign compared to the remote, rural fur trading settlements or Indigenous camps where they were born. Thus, most Anglo-M\u00e9tis were the result of relationships, officially recognized by the Church or not, between English and Scottish fur traders and Indigenous women.Brown, J. S. H. (1996). \u201cFur Trade as Centrifuge: Familial Dispersal and Offspring Identity in Two Company Contexts.\u201d In DeMallie, R. J., & Ortiz, A.

The ethnicity of their fathers also determined which of the competing fur trading companies they might end up working for as adults. If they were descended from English fur traders, they generally worked for the Hudson's Bay Company. If they were descended from Scottish fur traders, they generally worked for the North West Company, also known as \"Nor'Westers.\" Additionally, the Anglo-M\u00e9tis / Countryborn had a more sedentary lifestyle of farming than the francophone M\u00e9tis community, whose men were generally hunters and trappers. The French-speaking M\u00e9tis were somewhat more nomadic, due to their reliance upon hunting as a trade and food resource. The Anglo-M\u00e9tis played a role in both the Red River Rebellion (or \"Red River Uprising\") of 1869 and the Northwest Rebellion (or \"Northwest Uprising\") of 1885, as they suffered from similar issues of racial discrimination and land problems as their francophone brethren. By the 19th century the English- speaking and French-speaking M\u00e9tis had become culturally quite similar, moving closer to each other in opposition to the British-Canadian majority. Their musical traditions, especially in the case of fiddle music, was derived from both British Isles and French origins, as was the M\u00e9tis traditional dance referred to as \"jigging\", or the \"Red River Jig\". In complexion they ranged from fair skinned, blond and blue eyed through dark skinned, with dark hair and dark eyes. M\u00e9tis elders say that no distinctions were made between individuals based upon complexion within the community. Family, culture, and strong identification with their Christian faith were the unifying bond amongst them. The two communities' primary differences lay in their languages and Christian religious affiliations; the French speakers were generally Roman Catholic and those of British descent were Protestant. Most Countryborn were Anglican or Presbyterian. They were involved in a mixed economy of subsistence farming and bison hunting throughout most of the 19th century; they also found employment with the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. The Countryborn were often known in the 19th century as \"mixed- bloods\", \"Black Scots\", \"Native English\" or \"halfbreeds\" (a term now considered pejorative). The French-speaking Metis referred to them simply as les m\u00e9tis anglais or les autres m\u00e9tis. Anglo-Metis gradually came to see themselves as little different from the French-speaking M\u00e9tis. Today, the two groups are no longer politically distinct, and are commonly known on the Canadian Prairies simply as M\u00e9tis. Prominent Anglo-M\u00e9tis / Countryborn include James Isbister, Thomas McKay and John Norquay, the Premier of Manitoba from 1878 to 1887. ==See also== *Anglo *Bungee language *Halcro, Saskatchewan *Hudson's Bay Company *Michif *M\u00e9tis Flag *M\u00e9tis people (Canada) *M\u00e9tis people (United States) *Prince Albert, Saskatchewan *Red River Colony == References == * Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion, and Audreen Hourie.
