Dunigan attended an open tryout with the Montreal Expos and was one of two ball players selected to sign a contract. ==Spring training== The Expos held spring training at West Palm Beach Municipal Stadium in West Palm Beach, Florida \u2013 a facility they shared with the Atlanta Braves. It was their 12th season at the stadium; they had conducted spring training there from 1969 to 1972 and since 1981. ==Regular season== ===Opening Day starters=== * Hubie Brooks * Tom Foley * Andr\u00e9s Galarraga * Dennis Mart\u00ednez * Tim Raines * Jeff Reed * Luis Rivera * Tim Wallach * Mitch Webster Expos pitcher Pascual P\u00e9rez threw a five-inning rain-shortened no-hitter against the Phillies on September 24, 1988. It was the first no-hitter in Veterans Stadium history. Perez allowed one walk, and another Phillies baserunner reached on an error. Umpire Harry Wendelstedt waved off the game after a 90-minute rain delay after the game was stopped by a steady rain with one out in the top of the sixth. However, due to a statistical rule change in 1991, no-hitters must last at least nine innings to count. As a result of the retroactive application of the new rule, this game and thirty-five others are no longer considered no-hitters. ===Season standings=== ===Record vs. opponents=== ===Notable transactions=== * July 13, 1988: Jeff Reed, Herm Winningham, and Randy St. Claire were traded by the Expos to the Cincinnati Reds for Tracy Jones and Pat Pacillo.Tracy Jones page at Baseball Reference * July 14, 1988: Dave Engle was released by the Expos. * July 23, 1988: Casey Candaele was traded by the Expos to the Houston Astros for Mark Bailey.Casey Candaele page at Baseball Reference * September 1, 1988: The Expos traded a player to be named later to the Texas Rangers for Tom O'Malley.
