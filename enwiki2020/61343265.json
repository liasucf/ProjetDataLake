In August 2020, Sporting News reported that Saab had sought an early release from his contract due to the travelling distance between Wollongong and his home in Western Sydney. However, the Dragons refused this request unless the club can be compensated either by cash or player transfer. In September, there was speculation that Saab would be joining the Manly Sea Eagles as a trade for Dragons junior Reuben Garrick. ==References== ==External links== *Dragons profile Category:2000 births Category:Australian people of Nigerian descent Category:Indigenous Australian rugby league players Category:Australian rugby league players Category:St. George Illawarra Dragons players Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Living people ",
