    "text": "\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\" is a song by the English rock band the Smiths. Released in December 1987, it reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the last of three UK singles from the band's fourth and final studio album, Strangeways, Here We Come. The album version contains a one-minute and 55-second introduction, consisting of piano playing against a backdrop of crowd noises from the miners' strike of 1984\u201385.https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/11/ranking-every-song-by-the- smiths-from-worst-to-best/full-post/ The 7\" single release does not include the introduction, while the 12\" single does. ==Track listing== ==Artwork and matrix message== The cover of the single featured a photograph of the 1950s and 1960s-era British singer Billy Fury.https://www.nme.com/photos/the-smiths- the-stories-behind-all-27-of-their-provocative-album-and-single-sleeves/384620 The British 7\" and 12\" vinyls contained the matrix message: \"THE RETURN OF THE SUBMISSIVE SOCIETY\" (X) STARRING SHERIDAN WHITESIDE/ \"THE BIZARRE ORIENTAL VIBRATING PALM DEATH\" (X) STARRING SHERIDAN WHITESIDE. Sheridan Whiteside was one of Morrissey's pseudonyms, taken from the protagonist of the play The Man Who Came to Dinner; that character was in turn based on dramatic critic and raconteur Alexander Woollcott and had been referenced in the etchings of the single \"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\". == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart !Peak position |- |Ireland (IRMA) |align=\"center\"|17 |- |UK Singles (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|30 |- |} ==Covers== Grant-Lee Phillips covered this song for his 1980s covers album Nineteeneighties. Alternative band Low also covered the song, initially as a single, and later included it on their A Lifetime of Temporary Relief: 10 Years of B-Sides and Rarities. In the booklet, the band describes it as \"another cover that some may sneer at. After this, nothing is sacred\". A cover by Eurythmics appears on the 2005 reissue of their 1989 album We Too Are One. A bootleg copy of the band performing the song live during their Peace tour appeared in the early 2000s, although the studio version was recorded in 2004.
