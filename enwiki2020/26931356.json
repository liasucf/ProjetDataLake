    "text": "Santa Cruz High School or Liceo Santa Cruz is a Chilean public high school located in Santa Cruz, Chile. == History == The school was created as the Santa Cruz High School of Men on August 2, 1963, after a proposal by the local Rotary Club and the Department of Santa Cruz Governor Carlos Cardoen. Adriano D\u00edaz donated some land, but a sports complex was constructed there instead. Classes commenced on March 1, 1964, in an old house in Nicol\u00e1s Palacios Street, with around 170 students in four classes. Many of the students had already completed their first or second grade humanities courses at the Pedro Aguirre Cerda High School, but their work was not officially recognized. The first principal was Osvaldo Castillo, who contracted teachers, and almost all of whom had worked at Pedro Aguirre Cerda High School. The logo and standard both include palm trees, which are characteristic of the city. The anthem was composed by Ra\u00fal Benavides. == References == * Rese\u00f1a Hist\u00f3rica (Internet Archive (Internet Archive) == External links == * Liceo Santa Cruz (Internet Archive) Category:Educational institutions established in 1963 Category:Secondary schools in Chile Category:Schools in Colchagua Province Category:1963 establishments in Chile ",
