    "text": "The Contemporary Singers of Australia were a chamber choir based in Sydney, New South Wales, dedicated to the choral music of the 20th century. The group was formed in late 1986 by visiting Canadian composer David Colwell with assistance from the University of Sydney and the NSW State Conservatorium of Music. Colwell directed the Singers for their first year, passing the leadership to Antony Walker and Elliott Gyger, who directed the Singers until 1999. Many of the original members were composition students of Peter Sculthorpe including Stephen Adams, Matthew Hindson, and Canadian composer Jana Skarecky. The Contemporary Singers varied in size between 12 and 30 voices, and developed a repertoire of over 70 works by about 55 different composers, giving Australian premiere performances of many significant works for chamber choir. Some members also sang with the Sydney Chamber Choir and subsequently with Walker's professional choir Cantillation. The Singers' first recording, Sydney Dreaming (ABC Classics 454 510-2, 1996) showcased Anne Boyd's As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams and Veni sancte spiritus--veni creator by Jennifer Fowler. They are featured in Raffaele Marcellino's commission for the Sydney Olympic Games, Heart of Fire (ABC 465 948-2, 2000). Their recording of Nigel Butterley's The True Samaritan on There Came a Wind Like a Bugle (Tall Poppies TD142, 2001) won the APRA Award for Best Vocal or Choral Work of the Year in 2003. ==Awards and nominations== ===APRA-AMC Classical Music Awards=== The APRA-AMC Classical Music Awards are presented annually by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and Australian Music Centre (AMC). |- | 2003 ||The True Samaritan (Nigel Butterley) \u2013 The Contemporary Singers || Vocal or Choral Work of the Year || == References == * CD booklet notes, Sydney Dreaming by The Contemporary Singers and Antony Walker, ABC Classics 454 510-2. == External links == * David Colwell * In Flanders Fields, by David Colwell * Stephen Adams * Stephen Adams - ABC Classic FM * Elliott Gyger * Elliott Gyger - BabelScores * Matthew Hindson * Matthew Hindson - Faber Music * Antony Walker * Antony Walker - Fletcher Artists * Antony Walker - Rayfield Allied * Jana Skarecky * Jana Skarecky - CMC * Sydney Dreaming - ABC Classics CD * Nigel Butterley, 'Morning Fanfare' from 'The True Samaritan,' performed by Gondwana Chorale Category:APRA Award winners Category:Australian choirs Category:New South Wales musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Australia ",
