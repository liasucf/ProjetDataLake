    "text": "\"Yakety Yak\" is a song written, produced, and arranged by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for the Coasters and released on Atco Records in 1958, spending seven weeks as #1 on the R&B; charts and a week as number one on the Top 100 pop list. This song was one of a string of singles released by the Coasters between 1957 and 1959 that dominated the charts, one of the biggest performing acts of the rock and roll era. ==Song== The song is a \"playlet,\" a word Stoller used for the glimpses into teenage life that characterized the songs Leiber and Stoller wrote and produced. The lyrics describe the listing of household chores to a kid, presumably a teenager, the teenager's response (\"yakety yak\") and the parents' retort (\"don't talk back\") \u2014 an experience very familiar to a middle-class teenager of the day. Leiber has said the Coasters portrayed \"a white kid\u2019s view of a black person\u2019s conception of white society.\" The serio-comic street-smart \u201cplaylets\u201d etched out by the songwriters were sung by the Coasters with a sly clowning humor, while the saxophone of King Curtis filled in, in the up-tempo doo-wop style. The group was openly \"theatrical\" in style\u2014they were not pretending to be expressing their own experience. The threatened punishment for not taking out the garbage and sweeping the floor is, in the song's humorous lyrics: :\"You ain't gonna rock and roll no more,\" And the refrain is: :\"Yakety yak; don't talk back.\" ==Cover versions== * Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois duo Les J\u00e9rolas recorded in 1959 a French version \"Rouspet' pas\" * Billy Sanders recorded a version in German, \"Jackety Jack\" in early 1959.
