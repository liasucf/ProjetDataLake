The beliefs center on these ten principles:http://hawthornegospel.org/what-we- believe \u2022 In the verbal inspiration of all the Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, and that they are the final authority in faith and life. \u2022 In one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \u2022 In the total depravity of all humanity, and the necessity of regeneration. \u2022 That salvation is the free gift of God, entirely apart from works, and is possessed by all who by faith received the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. \u2022 In the virgin birth of Christ, and that he is true God and true man. \u2022 That the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins, and that with his shed blood, he obtained for us an eternal redemption. \u2022 In the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord, in his ascension into heaven, and in his present life as our high priest and advocate. \u2022 That the Holy Spirit is a divine person and that he indwells all believers. \u2022 In the personal, pre-millennial, imminent return of our Lord Jesus Christ. \u2022 In the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved, and the everlasting punishment of the lost. ==History== Hawthorne Gospel Church was founded on June 5, 1925 but has roots in a campaign in Paterson from April 4 to May 23, 1915, by evangelist Billy Sunday. As a result of the campaign, a ladies\u2019 Bible class was begun, taught by Mrs. Alma Fischer. One of the men, waiting for his wife at the Bible class, suggested that they consider Sunday afternoon meetings that would not be held at \u201cchurch time.\u201d Although all were active in a variety of different churches, they felt the need for steady Bible teaching and to hear evangelistic messages. Two of the men would see about renting the Lafayette Avenue Fire Hall for this purpose. On June 5, 1925, the Sunday afternoon meetings for Bible study began in that Fire Hall and a few months later, Sunday School began with 24 children attending. It did not take long before the group sponsored weeknight meetings with special speakers. These meetings, held during the summers of 1928 to 1933, were conducted in tents, the first located on property on Lafayette Avenue where the Louis Bay II Library now stands. As time passed the group became more and more connected and decided that the area did need another church that would reach out to the people in the Hawthorne community. So on Thanksgiving Day, 1930, there was the dedication of a church building on Lafayette Avenue, a few doors up the street from the Fire Hall.
