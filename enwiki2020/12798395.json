    "text": "The seventh season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC between October 3, 1981, and May 22, 1982. ==Background== Following the dismissal of producer Jean Doumanian during the show's sixth season, Dick Ebersol, the program's developer, was hired as Doumanian's replacement. In March 1981, Dick Ebersol dismissed several of her cast members (repertory players Gilbert Gottfried, Ann Risley and Charles Rocket and featured players Yvonne Hudson, Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers). After one episode on April 11, 1981, the show was shut down for the rest of the season because of the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike. In the break, Dick Ebersol would also dismiss repertory players Denny Dillon and Gail Matthius, and featured players Laurie Metcalf and Emily Prager were not asked back as cast members. The new cast of Saturday Night Live for season7 included most of the repertory players from the final Dick Ebersol- produced episode of season6: Robin Duke, Tim Kazurinsky and Tony Rosato along with the sole surviving cast members from Jean Doumanian's era, Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Adding two new cast members Mary Gross and Christine Ebersole. Brian Doyle-Murray, who had been a writer for season 6, joined Dick Ebersol's new cast as a featured player (he was also a featured player during season 5). Michael O'Donoghue, who Dick Ebersol brought back to the show in March, remained as head writer for the first half of season7. Some sketches, as well as the appearances of artists like Fear and William S. Burroughs, reflected the increasingly bizarre ideas O'Donoghue had for the show. However, after developing a tense relationship with Ebersol and berating the cast in a meeting following the December 12 episode, O'Donoghue was fired, with Bob Tischler taking the role of head writer.Hill and Weingrad, p. 453-7. A new logo was introduced for this season, and was used until season 10: It consisted of the words SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE in the form of a square, with each word after it increasing in size; a modernized version of this logo was used from 2006-2014. ==Format changes== Wanting to distance the show from its first five seasons, Ebersol cut the popular opening line Live from New York, It's Saturday Night! from the cold openings. In fact, sometimes cold openings were not even shown and the monologues were skipped over almost entirely. These changes were not permanent, as Ebersol decided to reverse them for the eighth season. Each episode began with the announcement \"And now from New York, the most dangerous city in America, it's Saturday Night Live!\" After the opening credits, the cast would enter together and pose with the show's host before running to their places for the first sketch. Ebersol also revamped Weekend Update. The segment went through its first name change (aside from the temporary change to \"Saturday Night Newsline\" in the final Doumanian episode from March 1981) and became \"SNL Newsbreak\". At the newsdesk was featured player Brian Doyle-Murray with Christine Ebersole and Mary Gross alternating as co-anchor. Brian Doyle-Murray also became the first Weekend Update anchor to be a featured player while serving as anchor. The only other anchors to do this were Michael Che, Tina Fey and Colin Jost. Additionally, this was the first season without Don Pardo (season 40 would become the next due to Don Pardo's death in 2014) as the show announcer. Instead the voice-overs were done by Mel Brandt, except for two episodes that aired in December 1981 when veteran NBC News announcer Bill Hanrahan handled such duties. ==Cast== During the season, original cast member John Belushi died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin. The original airing of the episode hosted by Robert Urich had a tribute to Belushi. ===Cast roster=== Repertory players *Robin Duke *Christine Ebersole *Mary Gross *Tim Kazurinsky *Eddie Murphy *Joe Piscopo *Tony Rosato Featured players *Brian Doyle-Murray bold denotes Weekend Update anchor ==Writers== This season's writers were Barry W.
