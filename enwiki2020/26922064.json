    "text": "Phenylpyruvic acid is the organic compound with the formula C6H5CH2C(O)CO2H. It is a keto acid. ==Occurrence and properties== The compound exists in equilibrium with its E- and Z-enol tautomers. It is a product from the oxidative deamination of phenylalanine. ==Preparation and reactions== It can be prepared by many methods. Classically it is produced from aminocinnamic acid derivatives. It has been prepared by condensation of benzaldehyde and glycine derivatives to give phenylazlactone, which is then hydrolyzed with acid- or base-catalysis.Carpy, Alain J. M.; Haasbroek, Petrus P.; Oliver, Douglas W. \"Phenylpyruvic acid derivatives as enzyme inhibitors: Therapeutic potential on macrophage migration inhibitory factor\" Medicinal Chemistry Research 2004, volume 13, pp. 565-577. It can also be synthesized from benzyl chloride by double carbonylation. Reductive amination of phenylpyruvic acid gives phenylalanine. ==See also== * Phenylpyruvate decarboxylase * Phenylpyruvate tautomerase * Phenylketonuria == References == Category:Alpha- keto acids Category:Benzyl compounds ",
