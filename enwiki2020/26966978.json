Her first public performance was at the age of 9 at the Henley Youth Festival. As a teenager she performed both as a solo artist and with her band on the local live circuit. At the age of 18, she travelled around Europe, Thailand, India, Malaysia, and Nepal \u2013 returning to the latter twice to record and perform with some of the country's musicians. She has since supported the London-based Child Action Nepal charity by donating profit from record sales. ==Career== Henwood has contributed to music therapy sessions and in 2010 she was awarded a Sue Ryder Care \"Woman of Achievement\" award as Performer of the Year. In 2009, Henwood \u2013 along with her saxophonist brother Joe \u2013 won the BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award. She has performed at events such as the Cambridge Folk Festival, and Fairport's Cropredy Convention, and performed at Glastonbury Festival 2010. Her first album, Making Waves, was released on 4 July 2011 on Dharma Records, ahead of various festival appearances including Larmer Tree, Cambridge Folk Festival and Secret Garden Party.
