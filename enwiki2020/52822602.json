    "text": "James A. Ibers is a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University. He is recognized for contributions to inorganic chemistry, especially in the areas of solid state synthesis and X-ray crystallography. He received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees at California Institute of Technology. Soon after graduating from CalTech, he took a position as staff scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, but for most of his career, he was a professor at Northwestern. His research includes many aspects of organometallic,Ukai, Toshinao; Kawazura, Hiroshi; Ishii, Yoshio; Bonnet, J. J.; Ibers, James A. \"Chemistry of dibenzylideneacetone-palladium(0) complexes. I. Novel tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(solvent) complexes and their reactions with quinones\" Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 1974, volume 65, pp. 253-66. bioinorganic,Ray, Gigi B.; Li, Xiao Yuan; Ibers, James A.; Sessler, Jonathan L.; Spiro, Thomas G. \"How far can proteins bend the FeCO unit? Distal polar and steric effects in heme proteins and models\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 1994, volume 116, pp. 162-76. and solid state chemistry,Sunshine, Steven A.; Kang, Doris; Ibers, James A. \"A new low- temperature route to metal polychalcogenides: solid-state synthesis of potassium titanium sulfide (K4Ti3S14), a novel one-dimensional compound\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 1987, volume 109, pp. 6202-4. almost always focused on the structural aspects. For his contributions, Ibers has been recognized by the American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry and election to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. ==References== Category:Inorganic chemists Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Living people Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
