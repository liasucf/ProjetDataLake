In his adolescence, he was a member of the Palatine Class, a special class of pupils that was formed upon the request of King Carol II of Romania, for the education of his only son, Prince Michael (proclaimed king as Michael I in 1939). Around 1944, Mircea Ionni\u021biu was a personal secretary of King Michael I. In this job, he was a direct witness of the August 23rd events, of the imposition of the first Petru Groza cabinet through Soviet pressure (March 6, 1945) and of the king's forced abdication on December 30, 1947. Mircea Ionni\u021biu left Romania on January 3, 1948, in the Royal Train, together with the Royal Family of Romania that was departing in forced exile. Later, in 1984, he wrote his memories about these historical events in his book Amintiri \u0219i reflec\u021biuni (\"Memories and Reflections\"), published by Editura Enciclopedic\u0103 in 1993. ==Bibliography== * Mircea Ionni\u021biu - Amintiri \u0219i reflec\u021biuni, Editura Enciclopedic\u0103, 1993, * Tudor Vi\u0219an-Miu - La \u0219coal\u0103 cu Regele Mihai.
