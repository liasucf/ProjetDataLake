At the age of nine years old she started composing small photo-realistic drawings influenced by cartoons, comics and fashion magazines. She moved to San Francisco, California in the 1990s. She has traveled extensively and lived in different cities such as Tokyo, Berlin and presently lives in New York where she has been active as an artist since 2004. During this time, she has been engaged in her studio practice and involved in several exhibitions throughout the US, Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Among many professional accomplishments are her Pollock-Krasner Foundation Award, Sculpture Space, Aljira Emerge 10 Fellowship, Lower East Side Printshop, The Bronx Museum of the Arts and Jamaica Center for the Arts and Learning Workspace Program. She made her first solo debut with Passageways in the Jersey City Museum, opening March 19, 2009. ==Work== A recurring theme in her work is the passage of time and its effect on cultures, she compares the environment and human civilization in a way to make the viewer question their relationship with both and thus define what they expect from their culture and themselves. Ms. De Carvalho mixes influences of Pop Art and Spanish Informalism to create works which draw attention to the strange beauty of unbridled urbanization and pay reverence to architecture as an art form. Her installations art and murals often include paintings with augmented surfaces which encourage the spectator to engage with the art as a three-dimensional subject, sometimes by expanding the images into interactive landscapes. Priscila's work has been exhibited by the Brooklyn Bridge Park (New York, USA), The Bronx Museum of the Arts (New York, USA), Socrates Sculpture Park (New York, USA), the Basque Museum-Center of Contemporary Art (Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain), Deutsche Bank (New York, USA), the Grand Palais (Paris, France), the Nepal Art Council in (Kathmandu, Nepal), The Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts (New York, USA), The Jersey City Museum (Jersey City, USA). She was also a celebrated participant in El Museo\u2019 Sixth Biennial in New York City, The First AIM Biennial at The Bronx Museum of the Arts, and The Kathmandu International Triennial in Nepal where she represented her home nation of Brazil. She has been commissioned for large- scale permanent public art projects by the MTA Arts & Design and the Department of Education in NY in collaboration with School Construction Authority, she is currently creating permanent public artwork for the SBS Woodhaven median stations commissioned by New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs\u2019 Percent for Arts Program as well as her largest and most ambitious sculptural work to date for the Valley Metro Rail System in Phoenix, Arizona. ==Book Chapters and Articles Work== * New York's Underground Art Museum MTA Arts and Design, Written by Sandra Bloodworth, William Ayres, Foreword by Stanley Tucci, Preface by Thomas F.
