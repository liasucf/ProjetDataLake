    "text": "Beaches is a 2017 American television drama film directed by Allison Anders and written by Bart Baker and Nikole Beckwith. It is a remake of the 1988 film of the same name. The film stars Idina Menzel and Nia Long. The film premiered on Lifetime on January 21, 2017. ==Plot== Two friends, with different backgrounds, keep a long-lasting friendship through childhood, love, and tragedy, in this thrilling remake. ==Cast== *Idina Menzel as CC Bloom **Gabriella Pizzolo as Young CC Bloom *Nia Long as Hillary Whitney **Grace Capeless as Young Hillary Whitney *Antonio Cupo as John Pierce *Barbara Beall as Costume Designer *Daniel Letto as Sorcerer Actor *Colin Lawrence as Bryan *Sanai Victoria as Tory Whitney *Rebecca Husain as Pretty Sinners Director *Graeme Duffy as Sorcerer Composer *Kate Isaac as Assistant District Attorney *Jane Hancock as Ashley ==Production== On July 28, 2016, the film was announced, with Idina Menzel joining the cast. On August 16, 2016, it was announced Nia Long had joined the cast. Principal photography began on August 15, 2016. ==Reception== Beaches received negative reviews, with most critics assessing it as inferior to the already mediocre 1988 original. Mike Hale of The New York Times pointed out the absurdity of remaking Beaches, itself a 1950s throwback which failed to update its themes to the decades in which the film is set. He added that \"Stuffing the story into 70 percent of the time makes C. C. and Hillary\u2019s cycle of fights and reconciliations feel more arbitrary than ever, especially in the absence of [Bette] Midler, whose vivid portrayal of C. C. provided motivations that weren\u2019t in the script.\" Blake Meredith wrote in the Los Angeles Times that \"Any time a beloved movie or TV series gets a remake, knee-jerk purists howl about it 'ruining' the original. 'Beaches' .. is the rare case of a remake that might actually do just that.\" She explained that by reducing the length to 90 minutes while otherwise staying faithful to the original film only serves to make the silliness of the original Beaches stand out more clearly, particularly noting how the shorter length forces most of the plot to be delivered through exposition. CNN Entertainment described it as tedious and dated, but said Menzel's singing is a highlight and makes the film arguably worth watching by Lifetime standards. The Boston Globe said it exasperated the chief shortcoming of the original film, the lack of substantial basis for C.C. and Hillary's friendship. Reviewer Matthew Gilbert stated, \"It\u2019s not so much that Menzel and Long are bad \u2014 they\u2019re consistently OK, if never better than that \u2014 but the story is too hollow for them to dig in. Singer-actress CC and lawyer Hillary meet as kids, become pen pals, room together, fall in love with the same guy ... and go through their expected friendship arc. None of it manages to work up much lather.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 television films Category:American films Category:American film remakes Category:English- language films Category:2017 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Lifetime (TV network) films Category:Films directed by Allison Anders Category:Films scored by Lesley Barber Category:Television remakes of films ",
