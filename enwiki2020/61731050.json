    "text": "The Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery (), commonly known as El Cuadrado (\"The Square\") is a privately owned cemetery located in Maracaibo, Zulia, Venezuela. It is one of the oldest operating cemeteries in the country, and has over 10,000 interments. ==History== The Cuadrado cemetery was the first designated burial site of the city of Maracaibo in modern times; it was officially opened on 12 November 1879 as church grounds, where bodies were traditionally buried, were becoming overcrowded. The cemetery was given landmark status in Maracaibo in 2003. Since then, some graves have become derelict or otherwise defaced, but there have been efforts made to preserve the site. Notable to the cemetery is its architecture, which spans various styles including Baroque, Neoclassical, and Eclectic, and the various notable people and families interred. In 2018, it was estimated that 10,630 bodies rest in the cemetery; the state of Zulia began building a museum on the site this year, about the cemetery and people buried there, which was also supported by the German Luxburg Carolath Foundation. ==Notable burials== *Jes\u00fas Enrique Lossada *Ismael Urdaneta *Francisco Eugenio Bustamante *Francisco Ochoa Bustamante *Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo *Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero *Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez *Manuel Dagnino *Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona *Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n *Guillermo Quintero Luzardo *Eduardo Mathyas Lossada *Julio \u00c1rraga *Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez *Antonio Pulgar *Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n *Julio \u00c1rraga *Antonio Borjas Romero *Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n *Manuel Belloso *Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn *Fray Jun\u00edpero de la Escalada *Eduardo L\u00f3pez Rivas *Eduardo L\u00f3pez Bustamante *Joaqu\u00edn Esteva Parra *Eduardo P\u00e9rez Fabelo * Kurt Nagel Von Jess ==References== ==Sources== *Tarre Murzi, Alfredo: Biograf\u00eda de Maracaibo (: Maracaibo Biography), Ed.
