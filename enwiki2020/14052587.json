Furthermore the scoring is complex and gliders can start at different times. Proposals were made in 1970Discussions between Nicholas Goodhart, George B. Moffat, Jr., Richard Schreder and Smith but it was not until 2005 that first world gliding competition in Grand Prix format was held in France at Saint Auban. This was at the Salon Europ\u00e9en du Vol \u00e0 Voile (European Sailplane Show/Exhibition) in 2005 as part of the FAI's marketing strategy to promote the sport of gliding by establishing annual international competitions. == Competition formula == In a gliding Grand Prix the gliders race in competition close together around a pre-set task. A smaller number of competitors reduces the risks of the simultaneous start. A place-scoring system provides rewards for excellence without unduly punishing a poor performance. * A task, typically 2-3 hour in duration and between 200 and 400 km in length is set. * All gliders start at the same time (similar to a yacht race). * The gliders must cross the short start line not above a set height and not faster than a set maximum speed. * The start/finish line is generally close to the airfield so that it can be observed by spectators. * Gliders race around the task. No team flying is permitted. The first one home wins as they all started at the same time and there is no handicapping. * A place scoring system is used, with 1 point for every finisher you beat, plus a bonus point for coming home first. (similar to a Motor Grand Prix). ===Scoring=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\" !
