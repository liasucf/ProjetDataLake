With action from page one, The Fox Sorceress is an engaging tale with awing intricate historic detail. Though character and plot drive, the book has what any reader wants in a story: love, loyalty, deceit, betrayal, murder, passion, and even erotica.\"White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress \u2013 Review in San Francisco Book Review. October 2009. The Midwest Book Review wrote of it: \"The rise of the Samurai in Japan was not a peaceful occurrence.... Seiko Fujiwara, a potential sorceress, may just hold the key to the salvation of her country. But fulfilling the prophecy is never an easy thing.

Volume 8, Number 11, November 2009. The Japan Times reviewer reported that: \"The Heian Period is portrayed as balanced and civilized before the onslaught of the samurai and the overthrow of the emperor by the Kamakura shogunate. The history of Japanese religion forms a large part of the story: Shinto gods (kami), Fujiyama, the sun goddess Amaterasu, tanuki and Inari deities all have narrative space. The author imagines a mostly realistic 12th-century Japan ... contrasting the world of the court, poetry and tradition with that of superstition, fancy and ritual.\"Finbow, Steve. \"Erotic Destiny, Palace Intrigue: WHITE AS BONE, RED AS BLOOD: The Fox Sorceress.\" The Japan Times.
