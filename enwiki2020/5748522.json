    "text": "Sir Walter Ian Percival QC (11 May 1921 \u2013 4 April 1998, aged 76) was a British Conservative Party politician. ==Background== Percival was educated at Latymer Upper School and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He was commissioned from Sandhurst into The Buffs in 1941 and served in the Second World War in North Africa and Burma, attaining the rank of Major. He became a barrister, was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple in 1948, and also worked as a part- time economics professor. He served as a councillor on Kensington Borough Council 1952\u201359. He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1963, and was knighted in 1979. He married Madeline Cooke in 1942, having met her in Burma, and had a son and a daughter.\u2018PERCIVAL, Rt Hon. Sir (Walter) Ian\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black. The family home was in Tenterden, Kent. On retirement, he supported several causes, including the establishment of a hospital in India after the Bhopal disaster. In 1993 he became the head of a Trust to complete the hospital, following lengthy legal negotiations with Union Carbide while he was engaged as an attorney in the US law firm Sidley and Austin. He died before its completion. ==Political career== He first stood unsuccessfully in the Battersea North constituency at the 1951 general election and again at the 1955 election. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Southport at the 1959 general election, holding the seat until he retired at the 1987 election. Although coveting a Ministerial post, he was overlooked for the position he wanted in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher came to power, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Instead, he served as Solicitor General from 1979 to 1983. On some issues, Percival's political views were to the right of some in the Conservative Party; he campaigned unsuccessfully to restore the death penalty (introducing an unsuccessful Bill to restore it for terrorists in 1984), and held strong views on the rigorous application of the law. He also called for the criminalisation of clubs and newsletters that existed for the purpose of allowing homosexuals to meet one another. Percival was a freemason. ==References== *The Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Ltd, 1951, 1966 & 1983 * Category:1921 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People educated at Latymer Upper School Category:Alumni of St Catharine's College, Cambridge Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) officers Category:Councillors in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Members of Kensington Metropolitan Borough Council Category:English barristers Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Solicitors General for England and Wales Category:20th-century British lawyers Category:Freemasons of the United Grand Lodge of England Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:English Queen's Counsel Category:Knights Bachelor ",
