Olympio is the son of the first President of Togo, Sylvanus Olympio, who was assassinated in a 1963 coup. On 10 August 2010, Jean-Pierre Fabre was elected as President of the party. == History == The UFC was founded by Olympio as a federation of parties on 1 February 1992.\"Historique du mouvement patriotique togolais\", UFC website Olympio was barred from standing in the August 1993 presidential election on a technicality. The UFC boycotted the February 1994 parliamentary election.
