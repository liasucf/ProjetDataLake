    "text": "Asperden is a village in the municipality of Goch, Kreis Kleve in the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia. The place name Asperden is a degeneration of Aspen-Rodung, or the harvesting of aspens, a popular tree-species. It dates from the time when the forests were cut down systematically and open spaces were created where habitation arose. The village has been part of Stadt Goch since 1969.
