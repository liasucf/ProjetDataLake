    "text": "Newtown Central is the name of an electoral ward in the town of Newtown, Powys, Wales. ==Description== Newtown Central ward covers the area west of Newtown town centre and immediately south of the River Severn. The ward elected two councillors to Montgomeryshire District Council and Powys County Council, but since the May 1999 election it has elected one county councillor to Powys County Council. It is also a community ward and is represented by three town councillors on Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Town Council. According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 3,278. ==County elections== At the May 2017 Powys County Council elections four of the five sitting councillors in Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn stood down, with Newtown Central being won from the Conservative Party by a Liberal Democrat, David Selby, bucking the county trend. Since 1995 the ward has been represented by Plaid Cymru and Independent councillors, though in 2008 it was taken by the Conservatives (who retained the seat in 2012). ==See also== * List of electoral wards in Powys ==References== Category:Newtown, Powys Category:Wards of Powys ",
