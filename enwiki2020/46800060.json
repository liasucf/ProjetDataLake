She was married to academic and critic Roberto Escamilla, with whom she had three children, Roberta, Corina and Jos\u00e9 Roberto. She was hospitalized with a pulmonary infection and scheduled for surgery at Doctors Hospital in Monterrey. However, days later she died after a call for A+ blood on her behalf. == Writing career == Barahona wrote a large quantity of articles for various magazines and newspapers but was best known for her work with newspapers La Prensa in Honduras and with El Norte in Monterrey.
