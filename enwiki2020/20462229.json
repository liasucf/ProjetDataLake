There are two full-service library facilities: Cook Park Library, 413 N. Milwaukee Ave. in Libertyville, and Aspen Drive Library, 701 Aspen Drive in Vernon Hills. CMPLD is a member of the Reaching Across Illinois Library System (RAILS). The former Cook Memorial Library building, in Cook Park at 413 N. Milwaukee Ave., Libertyville, Illinois, is a classical revival building constructed in 1879 as the home of area businessman Ansel Brainerd Cook; it is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ==History== Local library service began in 1909 when the Alpha Club (now the Libertyville Woman\u2019s Club) began a subscription library in Decker and Bond, a local drugstore. The small collection soon outgrew the few shelves in the drugstore and in 1914 found a new home in the Libertyville Village Hall. In 1921, the home and property of Ansel B. Cook were left to the village of Libertyville for library and park purposes; Cook Memorial Library opened to the public in November of that year. The first head librarian, Blanche Mitchell, lived with her husband in one of the upstairs rooms of Cook House. In 1924, the Libertyville Township Library Board was organized to operate Cook Memorial Library, and library service continued to be offered to the community from the Cook House. As the library\u2019s collection expanded to meet the demands of a growing population, the Children\u2019s Department was moved offsite. In 1968, a new brick building was constructed behind the Cook House, bringing the collection back together in one facility. The township library board was dissolved in 1973 with the formation of the Cook Memorial Public Library District. Shortly thereafter, parts of northern Vernon Township were annexed into the library district. In 1974, an automated circulation system was installed. In 1984, the basement was expanded by to house the Children\u2019s Department, office space, and a public meeting room. Public internet stations were installed in 1995. As the population served by CMPLD continued to grow, library space became crowded: By 1996, the library district\u2019s population was more than 47,000 and its annual circulation was more than one million items. Three unsuccessful referenda left the southern part of the library district underserved. In 2002, then serving a population of more than 58,000, CMPLD entered into an agreement with Vernon Hills to rent space in the lower level of its Village Hall on Evergreen Drive. The Evergreen Interim Library, , opened on January 13, 2003. To alleviate a continued lack of adequate space, in 2007 the CMPLD board adopted an expansion proposal calling for the addition of to the district's facilities. The $14-million project called for the construction of a library on Aspen Drive in Vernon Hills and adding about to Cook Park Library, along with renovating existing space at the site. While the Cook Park site was being remodeled, a temporary library location was established in order to continue services and programming. The new Aspen Drive Library opened on July 10, 2010. The remodeled Cook Park Library reopened on January 8, 2011. As of 2015, the Cook Memorial Public Library District was serving 60,000 people in Libertyville, Vernon Hills, Green Oaks, and Mundelein. The library district continues to operate two full-service libraries, a digital/eLibrary collection, as well as a Bookmobile, and Outreach. ===Library Directors=== *Verna E.
