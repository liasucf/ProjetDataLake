Fifty people died. Poems of tribute were published in the New Orleans Tribune including one with a stanza noting Lacroix. After his death a seance was held and the medium reported that Lacroix sought a continued push for civil rights. \"Mais je dirai toujours mul\u00e2tres, noirs, blancs, Victor Lacroix est mort, Jeff Davis est vivant.\" 'But for mulattos, blacks and whites, this fact I must tell, Victor Lacroix is dead. Jeff Davis lives still.' - excerpt from a poem published after the massacre. Lacroix married Sarah Brown, a white woman, in a religious ceremony in 1862 at St. Alphonse Church. Civil law prohibited such a marriage until 2 years after his death. She and her two young children were provided for by her father-in-law. https://books.google.com/books?id=kcBhY1zdOxUC&pg;=PA143&lpg;=PA143&dq;=victor+lacroix+new+orleans&source;=bl&ots;=ITAT6Owt57&sig;=ridbTZUNLBdSuXzZVP4tt0L3MRY&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwi38eSausHZAhUEXq0KHcdtDaAQ6AEwA3oECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q;=victor%20lacroix%20new%20orleans&f;=false His father Francois Lacroix was a wealthy property owner and served as president of the Couvent School (Institut Catholique) for African American orphans established in the will of Marie Couvent.
