    "text": "Frederick Jamison Gibbes (31 October 1839 - 17 January 1888) was an Australian politician. He was born at Regentville near Penrith to William Gibbes and Harriet Eliza Jamison. He attended a variety of schools before studying at the University of Sydney, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1860. He then worked for the lands office until 1865, when he began studying for the bar. He was never successful in this, and instead entered business. On 18 April 1883 he married Mary Jane Gill, with whom he had two children. A Newtown alderman from 1882 to 1886, he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Newtown in 1882. He held the seat until his death at Moonbi in 1888. His grandfather, John George Nathaniel Gibbes, had been a significant figure in the first half of the 19th century, including as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, while his uncle, Robert Thomas Jamison, was a member of the Legislative Assembly. ==References== Category:1839 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Free Trade Party politicians Category:19th-century Australian politicians ",
