It replaced the Winnipeg Declaration, which had in turn replaced the original Regina Manifesto of 1933 of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (the predecessor to the NDP).

We > believe that as peace must prevail over war, so must cooperation and mutual > responsibility prevail over private gain and competition as the guiding > principles of social and economic life. We seek a compassionate and caring > society, servicing the needs of all. The New Democratic Party is proud to be > part of that great worldwide movement of democratic socialist parties which > have always striven to replace oppression and privilege with democracy and > equality.docstoc.com ==References== Category:1983 in Canadian politics Category:New Democratic Party (Canada) Principles Category:History of Regina, Saskatchewan Category:History of socialism Category:1983 in politics Category:1983 in Saskatchewan Category:1983 documents ",
