    "text": "Daniel Jelensperger (1 April 1799 \u2013 30 May 1831) was a French musicologist. == Life == Born in Mulhouse, Jelensperger studied with Anton Reicha at the Conservatoire de Paris where he later taught counterpoint and musical composition. In 1830 he published his harmony treaty L'harmonie au commencement du dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle et m\u00e9thode pour l'etudier in Paris, which was published in 1833 by Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel in Leipzig under the title Die Harmonie im Anfang des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts. His views were far more influenced by the German musical tradition as represented by Abb\u00e9 Vogler and Weber than by contemporary French music. Jelensperger died in Paris. == Bibliography == * Lucien Chevaillier: Musiciens d'Alsace (XIXe si\u00e8cle). Daniel Jelensperger et Henri Reber.
