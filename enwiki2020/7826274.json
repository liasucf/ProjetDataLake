    "text": "Hallirhoidae is an extinct family of heteroscleromorph demosponges found throughout the world from the Cretaceous to the Eocene, whereupon they became extinct. The highest concentration of species occurred in the Tethys Ocean during the upper Cretaceous. The hallirhoid demosponges were very distinctive- looking, largely pear-shaped sponges that were attached to the seafloor by a long stem-like stalk. == References == Category:Heteroscleromorpha Category:Prehistoric sponge families Category:Cretaceous first appearances Category:Maastrichtian taxonomic families Category:Danian taxonomic families Category:Selandian taxonomic families Category:Thanetian taxonomic families Category:Ypresian taxonomic families Category:Eocene extinctions ",
