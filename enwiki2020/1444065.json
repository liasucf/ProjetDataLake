    "text": "Irreligious is the second studio album by Portuguese gothic metal band, Moonspell, released 1996. It features some of the best-known songs of the band, such as \"Opium\", \"Ruin & Misery\", \"Awake!\" and \"Full Moon Madness\". The latter is usually the closing song during almost every Moonspell concert, which over time has become a characteristic of their concerts. Before the song begins, Fernando Ribeiro often makes the sign of the circle (symbolizing Moon) over the crowd. The 3rd track \"Awake!\" features a recording of Aleister Crowley reading his poem 'The Poet'. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Fernando Ribeiro - vocals * Ricardo Amorim - guitars * Jo\u00e3o Pedro Escoval (Ares) - bass * Pedro Paix\u00e3o - keyboards, samples * Miguel Gaspar (Mike) - drums ===Guest musicians=== * Markus Freiwald - percussion on \"For a Taste of Eternity\" * Birgit Zacher - vocals on \"Raven Claws\" ===Production=== * Rolf Brenner - photography * Siggi Bemm - engineering * Waldemar Sorychta - producer, mixing ==Opium video== The album was promoted by the first Moonspell music video \"Opium\", which contained imagery of 19th century-looking opium den. ==References== Category:Moonspell albums Category:1996 albums Category:Century Media Records albums Category:Albums produced by Waldemar Sorychta ",
