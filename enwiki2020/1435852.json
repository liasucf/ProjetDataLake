A member of one of The Tribes of Galway, Blake was the second son of Walter Blake (died 1575) and Juliana Browne. His grandfather and brothers served as Mayors of Galway; his elder brother, Valentine Blake (1560\u20131634) was created a baronet in 1622. Blake moved through the world of international intrigue as an agent for, variously, the Irish, English, French and Spanish during the Nine Years War in the 1590s. He has been named as the assassin of Red Hugh O'Donnell in Spain in 1602. He was in the company of O'Donnell at the time of his death, and offered his services to Sir George Carew for the plot. ==References== * Old Galway, Maureen Donovan O'Sullivan, 1942. * Spanish Blake, in Irish Leaders and Learning Through the Ages by Paul Walsh, ed. by Nollaig \u00d3 Mura\u00edle, 2003. * Dictionary of Irish Biography, p. 584, Cambridge, 2010 * Martyn, Adrian (2016).
