    "text": "White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) is a military testing area operated by the United States Army. The range was originally established as the White Sands Proving Ground on July 9, 1945. White Sands National Park is located within the range. ==Significant events== * The first atomic bomb (code named Trinity) was test detonated at Trinity Site near the northern boundary of the range on July 16, 1945; seven days after the White Sands Proving Ground was established.SpacePorting Part III: US Spaceports * After the conclusion of World War II, 100 long-range German V-2 rockets that were captured by U.S. military troops were brought to WSMR. Of these, 67 were test fired between 1946 and 1951 from the White Sands V-2 Launching Site. (This was followed by the testing of American rockets, which continues to this day, along with testing other technologies.) * NASA's Space Shuttle Columbia landed on the Northrup Strip at WSMR on March 30, 1982 as the conclusion to mission STS-3.https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/multimedia/imagegallery/Shuttle/EC82-18507.html This was the only time that NASA used WSMR as a landing site for the space shuttle. Trinity explosion became part of WSMR. ===Incidents=== * Circa May 30, 1947, a German V-2 sounding rocket fired from White Sands Proving Ground veered off course, crashed and exploded on top of a rocky knoll 3.5 miles south of the Juarez, Mexico business district. * On July 11, 1970, the United States Air Force launched an Athena sounding rocket, equipped with re-entry vehicle V-123-D, from the Green River Launch Complex in Utah. While its intended target was inside of WSMR, the rocket instead flew south and impacted 180\u2013200 miles south of the Mexican border in the Mapimi Desert in the northeastern corner of the Mexican state of Durango. ==Geography== The largest military installation in the United States, WSMR encompasses almost that includes parts of five counties in southern New Mexico: # Do\u00f1a Ana County # Otero County # Socorro County # Sierra County # Lincoln County ===Nearby military bases=== * WSMR borders the McGregor Range Complex at Fort Bliss to the south (southeast Tularosa Basin and on Otero Mesa http://fronteralandalliance.org/castner/media/ICRMP.pdf \"This report inventoried and evaluated 150 Cold War era properties constructed between 1956 and 1961 at Orogrande Range Do\u00f1a Ana Range, McGregor Range, North McGregor Range, and Meyer Target Range in New Mexico.\") making them contiguous areas for military testing. * Holloman AFB borders WSMR to the east. ===Nearby cities=== * Las Cruces, New Mexico to the west. * Alamogordo, New Mexico to the east. * Chaparral, New Mexico to the south. * El Paso, Texas to the south. ===National park and wildlife refuge=== The following federally-protected natural areas are contained within the borders of WSMR: * White Sands National Park * San Andres National Wildlife Refuge ==Transportation== ===Major highways=== * U.S. Highway 70 traverses the southern part of the range in a west-northeast direction and is subject to periodic road closures during test firings at the range. * NM 213 enters the range from the south from Chaparral, New Mexico and terminates at U.S. Highway 70. ===Nearby airports=== *Las Cruces International Airport \u2013 No current regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights since July 25, 2005, when Westward Airways ceased operations. General aviation, New Mexico Army National Guard (4 UH-72 Lakota Helicopters), private charters and CAP use the airport, among others. *El Paso International Airport \u2013 Nearest airport with regularly scheduled commercial flights. ==National Historic Landmarks== Designated historic sites on WSMR land include: * Trinity Site: Selected in November 1944 for the Trinity nuclear test conducted on July 16, 1945 (National Historic Landmark district on December 21, 1965, and NRHP on October 15, 1966). * White Sands V-2 Launching Site: A V-2 static test firing was March 15, 1946, and the first US V-2 launch was April 16, 1946 (landmark designation 3 October 1985). ==Current operations== Ground-based electro-optical deep-space surveillance telescopes performing space surveillance mission. The White Sands Test Center headquartered at the WSMR \"Post Area\" has branches for Manned Tactical Systems & Electromagnetic Radiation and conducts missile testing and range recovery operations.
