    "text": "\"Special Cases\" is a song by English trip hop collective Massive Attack, featuring vocals by Irish singer-songwriter Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. It appeared on Massive Attack's fourth full-length album, 100th Window, and was released as the first single on 24 February 2003. The single reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart, number 19 in Greece, number 22 in Italy, and number 46 in Ireland. \"Special Cases\" is the group's only song to chart in Canada, where it reached number 25 on the Canadian Singles Chart. Despite being one of the band's higher-charting singles, it did not appear on their 2006 singles compilation Collected. In addition to a radio edit of the original song, the single release contains a remix by Canadian electronica artist Akufen, as well as \"I Against I\", a song performed with Mos Def that appeared on the soundtrack of the 2002 film Blade II. 12\" vinyl releases contained an additional remix of \"Special Cases\" by Vladislav Delay, who is credited as \"Luomo\" for this release. Two separate music videos were made for the song. The Enhanced CD contains one of these, and the other video is on a rare DVD release of the single. ==Track listing== CD (VSCDT1839) # \"Special Cases\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46 # \"Special Cases\" (Akufen remix) \u2013 9:56 # \"I Against I\" (featuring Mos Def)\u2013 5:40 # \"Special Cases\" (video version 2) \u2013 5:09 12\" (VST1839) # \"Special Cases (Akufen remix)\" \u2013 9:56 # \"Special Cases (Luomo's Casing)\" \u2013 7:56 DVD (VSDVD1839) # \"Special Cases\" (video version 1) \u2013 5:09 # \"Special Cases\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:46 # \"Special Cases\" (Akufen remix) \u2013 9:56 # \"Special Cases\" (Luomo's Casing edit) \u2013 4:43 ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2003) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada (Nielsen SoundScan) |25 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |46 |- !scope=\"row\"|Greece (IFPI) See Best column. |19 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Poland (LP3) |8 |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * inflightdata.com - Massive Attack Discography * MASSIVEATTACK.IE song info entry on Special Cases * * Category:Massive Attack songs Category:2003 singles Category:2003 songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Songs written by Robert Del Naja Category:Songs written by Neil Davidge ",
