    "text": "A Gorgeous Kid Like Me (), also known as A Gorgeous Bird Like Me, is a 1972 French film directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, starring Bernadette Lafont. It is based on Henry Farrell's 1967 novel of the same name. Truffaut called it \"a sarcastic comedy thriller.\"Tho audiences may be jaded, Truffaut will remain Truffaut Mills, Bart. Chicago Tribune 6 Aug 1972: i13. ==Plot== Stanislas Previne is a young sociologist, preparing a thesis on criminal women. He meets Camille Bliss in prison to interview her. Camille is accused of having murdered her lover Arthur and her father. She tells Stanislas about her life and her love affairs. Stanislas, much to the frustration of his secretary, who also has a crush on him, soon falls in love with Camille and works to find the evidence to prove her innocence. His secretary tries to convince the sociologist that Camille is a \"manipulative slut\" but he cannot be convinced. Through investigation, the sociologist and his secretary find a young boy, an amateur filmmaker, who has captured the evidence they need on film to secure Camille's release from prison. Once free, Camille, who always has loved music and has seduced the cabaret singer Sam Golden earlier in the film, becomes a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and a singing star. Stanislas meets her after a performance, and she seduces him at her home; however, her husband (who is cuckolded many times during the film) discovers them and beats him up. Camille kills her husband and then plants the gun on her passed-out paramour. When Stanislas is imprisoned for murder, Camille will do nothing to help the man who once freed her. As he cleans up the prison in the film's final segment, the camera pans to show Stanislas' secretary typing a manuscript on a nearby balcony, presumably the thesis that Stanislas began, but this time preparing one that will expose Camille as the manipulative seductress that Stanislas discovered her to truly be. ==Cast== * Bernadette Lafont as Camille Bliss * Andr\u00e9 Dussollier as Stanislas Pr\u00e9vine * Claude Brasseur as Ma\u00eetre Murene * Charles Denner as Arthur * Guy Marchand as Roger aka Sam Golden * Anne Kreis as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne * Philippe L\u00e9otard as Clovis Bliss * Gilberte G\u00e9niat as Isobel Bliss * Michel Delahaye as Marchal * Dani\u00e8le Girard as Florence Golden * Martine Ferri\u00e8re as prison secretary * Jacob Weizbluth as Alphonse, the mute * Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin as the newspapers seller (uncredited) * Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as a journalist (voice, uncredited)Allen, Don.
