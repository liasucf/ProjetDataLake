On 15 December 2008, Baskin Oran with Ahmet \u0130nsel, Ali Bayramo\u011flu, Cengiz Aktar and more than a thousand Turkish intellectuals introduced a petition \"We apologize to the Armenians\" thus opposing deliberately organized collective obliviousness in Turkey. This version of history understates the responsibility of the government in the era of deportations and massacres of Armenians. Bask\u0131n Oran is an independent personality who continues to stimulate the conscience in Turkey despite the legal problems and threats. He is one of the representatives of this vanguard of the civil society fighting for Turkey to complete its democratic transformation. He does not hesitate to speak of the\"second revolution\" in progress, the first being that of the establishment of the republic by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1923. Bask\u0131n Oran was an assistant professor, but twice in 1971 and 1982 he was banned from teaching by the military junta. Curriculum Vitae ==Identity Conflicts == Bask\u0131n Oran claims that most of the conflicts in Turkey are due to the Republic's choice to rely on Turkish identity (ethnic \u2013 blood based) instead of choosing the land, He feels sorry that the name of the people \"T\u00fcrk\" is chosen instead of \"T\u00fcrkiyeli\" (from Turkey). In the Ottoman era, the Turks were one of the \"millet\" (infra-identity) that made up the empire ruled by the Ottomans (supra-identity). The other \"millets\" were Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, Syrians, Arabs, etc.Ottoman Empire The mistake of Kemalist nationalism is to have replaced the supra-identity \"neutral\" by one of the infra-identities instead of building the nation on land, (the Ottomans were not Turkish in an ethnic sense, moreover they did not recognize themselves as such). He rejected the myth that kemalism was the source of an egalitarian society. He created an acronym to designate on which sociotype the ideology and the dominant class are based: -- Sunni Hanafi and secular Muslim Turkish ), they are, according to him, the equivalent in Turkey of what the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) are in the United States.Baskin Oran, conf\u00e9rence donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Paris le 27 janvier 2008, \u00ab Identit\u00e9s et des conflits identitaires en Turquie \u00bb == From Kemalism to Social Democracy == Bask\u0131n Oran, who comes from a family of the Kemalist and secular bourgeoisie always likes to mention that he grew up in favor of the nationalists of his country. He was a leftist activist while still a student feeling close to communists as were many other people at that time (in 1968, he was 23 years old). In 1986, he wrote about The question of the Turkish minority in Greece and about Turkish-Greek relations.T\u00fcrk-Yunan \u0130li\u015fkilerinde Bat\u0131 Trakya Sorunu, Ankara, Faculty of Political Science Graduates Association Publication, 1986; 349 p. He was then contacted by a Kurdish personality, who points out to him that Kurds live a similar situation in Turkey, following this discussion, he focuses his work on the problem of minorities and nationalism inside Turkey. Later, in 2003, he was asked by the government that as an expert on this subject to co-write a report, which, despite the wrath of justice, will become the book \"T\u00fcrkiye'de Az\u0131nl\u0131klar, Kevramlar \u2013 Teori \u2013 Lozan \u2013 \u0130\u00e7 mevzuat \u2013 \u0130\u00e7tihat \u2013 Uygulama\"(Minorities in Turkey: concepts, theory, Lausanne, domestic legislation, jurisprudence, practice). This book became a \"bestseller\" in Turkey. Another meeting in 1993 was also decisive. Bask\u0131n Oran received a call from a someone with a Turkish name of\" Hrant Dink\" a journalist who said he was very moved by his writings, especially by the fact that he was a Turkish who wrote them. (it must be remembered here that the subject of what he wrote was taboo in Turkey, from the emergence of the Republic and in the name of the sacrosanct national unity). They met again and remained closely linked until the journalist's assassination on 19 January 2007 separated them.Baskin Oran, \" Hrant, t'en fait vraiment trop ! \" in Hrant Dink, \u00catre Arm\u00e9nien en Turquie, \u00c9ditions Fradet, p. 123, Baskin now proclaims himself as a social democrat, without being affiliated with any political party.Oran Aims for Opposition Outside Parliament == About identities and identity conflicts == Bask\u0131n Oran says that most of the conflicts in Turkey are explained by the choice made by the republic to be based on Turkish identity (ethnic - based on blood) instead of choosing the soil. He deplores the choice of the name of the people \"T\u00fcrk\" instead of \"T\u00fcrkiyeli\" (from Turkey).In the Ottoman era, the Turks were one of the \"millets\" (infra-identity) that made up the empire ruled by the Ottomans (supra-identity), ==References== Human rights Activist Alumni Category:1945 births Category:Living people ",
