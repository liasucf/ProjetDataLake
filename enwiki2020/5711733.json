    "text": "\"Call Me\" was the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, performed in English by Feminnem. As Bosnia-Herzegovina had pre- qualified for the final, the song was performed twenty-first in the final (following Russia's Natalia Podolskaya with Nobody Hurt No One and preceding Switzerland's Vanilla Ninja with Cool Vibes). At the close of voting, it had received 79 points, placing 14th in a field of 24 and giving Bosnia- Herzegovina a spot to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest. The song is an up-tempo number, paying tribute to the Contest itself which was celebrating its 50th anniversary at the time (\"50 candles on the party cake, for the many years of happiness\"). The performance was likened to a radio jingle by some fans before the Contest took place. It was succeeded as Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative at the 2006 Contest by \"Hari Mata Hari\" with Lejla. == See also == *Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 ==External links== * Live Performance Category:Eurovision songs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Eurovision songs of 2005 Category:Songs written by Andrej Babi\u0107 Category:English-language Bosnia and Herzegovina songs Category:2005 songs ",
