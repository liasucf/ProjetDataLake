    "text": "TidalWave Productions (previously known as Bluewater Productions, StormFront Media/Publishing & Storm Entertainment) is an independent production studio of comic books and graphic novels. Based in Vancouver, Washington, United States, Bluewater publishes biographical comics, adaptations from films, and original titles with self-created characters. ==History== The first iteration of Davis's company started in 2001 as a production studio at Image Comics, where its founder Darren G. Davis developed the company's signature series 10th Muse and The Legend of Isis. This iteration came to an end with the company declared bankrupt in 2003. Davis's revived company, then known as Bluewater Productions, became a publisher in May 2007 with the signature series Ray Harryhausen Presents, which was produced in conjunction with filmmaker Ray Harryhausen until 2009. Other signature series, including Vincent Price Presents, produced in conjunction with the daughter of the actor Vincent Price,Immortal After All... Vincent Price Comes to Comic Books, Newsarama, June 13, 2008 and William Shatner Presents, with actor William Shatner, followed. The company signed a deal, in 2009, to republish the Rock 'N' Roll Comics series from defunct publisher Revolutionary Comics, the deal was ended in 2013 after seven volumes with an eighth left un-published. The company has come under criticism, starting in 2009, from former content creators claiming non-payment for their work. Rich Johnston, writing for Bleeding Cool, claims: \"The company uses a number of free creators, working for no money at all, seeking exposure, who later wonder if they've been taken for a ride-- especially if the work never even sees publication.\" Bluewater Productions founder Davis issued a statement saying, \"Bluewater does not engage or condone any such underhanded or untoward activity and refutes each and every allegation made against the company and me personally. Much of the perceived conflict comes from a handful of creatives who became disenchanted over the terms of their signed agreements and mistakenly believe they are owed compensation.\" A cease and desist notice was sent to the company in 2010 by Kenneth Feinswog over the publication of unauthorized biographical comics of his clients Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. Davis announced, in 2010, the appointment of Arastao Maree as Executive V.P. of Creative Development with the responsibility of re-purposing the company's titles for theatrical, television, new media and videogame production. A collaboration with The Graphic Classroom was announced in August 2011, which resulted in the creation of free lesson plans to tie-in with the company's series of biographical comics. Bluewater became a pioneer in digital first publishing in January 2012, with the release of its Gabrielle Giffords and Mitt Romney bio-comics on the Nook and Kindle prior to their print versions. Bluewater ended its distribution deal with Diamond Comic Distributors in 2012 after several of their titles were cancelled for not meeting the sales benchmarks, distribution was taken over by Comic Flea Market, which operates a print on demand service. Following this Arcana Studio bought up the majority of the company's non- biographical original content, including 10th Muse and Legend of Isis. Content creator Jaymes Reed ended his deal, in 2013, with the company to publish his creator-owned Comics series of biographical comics about famous comedians, which had been running since 2011, claiming non-payment for his work. Darren G. Davis responded to the claims by stating that Reed had been paid despite poor sales and copyright infringement issues with the estates of the comics' subjects. Reed made further complaints in 2014 that the company was continuing to publishing the series without his permission. A name change to StormFront Media/Publishing in 2015 followed a television production deal for their property Insane Jane that required the company to differentiate itself from another production company of the same name. A second name change to Storm Entertainment later that year was undertaken in order to end any confusion of the company with the controversial Stormfront message forum. This rebranding coincided with a change to a digital-centric business plan. ==Darren G. Davis titles== ===10th Muse=== Developed by founder Darren Davis, 10th Muse follows the adventures of the forgotten tenth muse of ancient Greece reincarnated in the body of ordinary present-day girl Emma Sonnet. 10th Muse was the sixth highest selling comic in November 2001. 10th Muse has been optioned for film and television several times, first in 2002. While ultimately the project failed to come to fruition, CastleBright Entertainment acquired the film option in 2007. In 2011 Vanquish Motion Pictures commissioned a television pilot of 10th Muse penned by Jennifer Quintenez. ===Legend of Isis=== Legend of Isis follows the adventures of the Egyptian goddess Isis as she adjusts to life in 21st century Los Angeles following 5,000 years of imprisonment.

Isis's primary weapon, the mystical staff of Luxor, channels the power of Osiris, her lost love. The Legend of Isis was optioned in 2004 as a motion picture by Paramount Studios and Grammnet Productions. ===Other titles=== *Orion the Hunter *Judo-Girl *The Blackbeard Legacy *Victoria's Secret Service (VSS) *The Mis-Adventures of Adam West ==Ray Harryhausen Signature Series== The Ray Harryhausen Signature Series is a series of authorised comic book adaptions of unrealised projects developed by filmmaker Ray Harryhausen which ran for two years, from 2007 to 2009.

The artwork by Tennant in the final two chapters is described by Thomas as \"heavy-textured, almost photo-realistic panels,\" while Ferguson compliments the \"insane\" action shots despite the lazy shortcuts taken. As part of a publicity campaign for the comic, a preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film. ===Sinbad: Rogue of Mars=== Sinbad: Rogue of Mars is a 2007 four-issue comic book miniseries created by Greg Thompson, Scott Davis, Jeff Cruz and Kiatisak Piewkao based on ideas developed by Ray Harryhausen in 1981 as a continuation of his Sinbad the Sailor film series, which would have been titled Sinbad Goes to Mars, and had previously included The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973) and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977).

This multi-part, creator-owned miniseries revolves around the adventures of characters from Greek mythology in modern times. Initially, the series will consist of a four-issue miniseries, planning to expand to a team book of four to six issues. The Wave #0 explores what happens to Greek gods Artemis, Zeus, Poseidon and Persephone when mankind ceases to worship them. The line will also follow mythological figures Heracles and Orion, as well as Bluewater original characters from 10th Muse, The Legend of Isis and Atlas. Stueve and Paulson cite the films of Ray Harryhausen and mythic archetypes of Joseph Campbell as major influences. The first four titles are confirmed as Artemis, Orion, Heracles and Trident: The Power of Poseidon, with issue #0 Twilight of the Gods to be released in November 2011. ===Other titles=== ==Biographical comic books== In 2009, the company ventured into biographical comics with Female Force, a series celebrating influential women in society and popular culture. In the subsequent years, Bluewater Productions has filled the growing biography comics niche with other titles profiling popular figures in politics (Political Power), entertainment (Fame), literature, and others. Less than half of Bluewater Productions publications are biography. Bluewater Productions attempts to utilize the \"power of celebrity\" to broaden comics distribution. \"We tried something different to get new readers into to comic book stores and it is working... We get a lot of flak from the true comic book fans thinking we are ruining the industry, but we are doing our part to help it.\" Fame: Justin Bieber was initially distributed exclusively at Wal-Mart stores. Although many of the biography comics are unauthorized, the company does reach out to most of its subjects to participate. In 2010, the publication of Female Force: Charlaine Harris marked the first authorized Female Force biography. Harris granted interviews to writer Kim Sherman. When requested, Bluewater has donated profits made off the biography comics to charities of the subject's choice, as was the case with FAME: Ellen DeGeneres. Criticism surrounds the potentially exploitative nature of biography comics. Responses from Bluewater Productions highlight positive aspects of potentially expanding comics readership. Furthermore, the company defends its right to provide timely coverage that its audience demands. According to Davis, speaking about the upcoming Infamous: Charlie Sheen comic, \"there are those who are going to complain that we are exploiting Sheen. But honestly, this is no different than People magazine devoting most of an issue to the story or TMZ or Slate or the general media's constant coverage of breaking developments. If Sheen contacted us right now and wanted us to donate some of the potential profits to a charity of his choosing, we would happily do so.\" In addition to Female Force, the company publishes the biography comics lines Political Power (eg: Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Ophra Winfrey...), Fame (eg : 50 cent, Adele, Beyonce, Black Eyed Peas...), about famous authors (eg : Anne Rice, JK Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Stephenie Meyer...)\"All Bluewater Productions comicbooks\", \"ComicBookRealm\", accessed june 2020 and others. In September 2009, Bluewater announced it would be reprinting defunct publisher Revolutionary Comics' line of music comics (including their flagship title Rock 'N' Roll Comics) in 10 monthly volumes, averaging 250 pages each.Parkin, J.K. \"Don\u2019t call it a comeback: Bluewater to collect classic Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Comics,\" Comic Book Resources: Robot6 (September 10, 2009). The first collections were The Beatles Experience and Hard Rock Heroes, released in early 2010. Many of Revolutionary's original creators participated in updating and modernizing the contents of the musical comic bios (which had been originally produced in the years 1989\u20131993). The reprints and updates were supervised by long-time Rock 'N' Roll Comics writer/editor Jay Allen Sanford. Ultimately, Bluewater released seven titles from 2010\u20132012:Sanford, Jay Allen, \"No more Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Comics reprint editions from Bluewater Productions,\" San Diego Reader blog (March 23, 2013). Two other projected volumes, Rock 'N' Roll Cartoon History: The Sixties; and Rock 'N' Roll Cartoon History: The Seventies, remain unpublished. ==Multi-media products== Nanny & Hank was optioned by Uptown 6 Productions for a feature film.
