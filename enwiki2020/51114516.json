    "text": "Radio Garcia-Serra was a Cuban radio station founded in 1929. == History == Jorge Garcia-Serra founded Radio Garcia-Serra in Havana, Cuba in late 1929. The radio station was the second radio station established in Havana, and transmitted under the call letters CMCU at a frequency of 660 kc which, at the time and throughout the 1950s, was the only frequency with a clear international frequency that could not be blocked or interfered. In the early stages, Radio Garcia-Serra broadcast music and on-air novellas written by distinguished Cuban and Spanish writers of the time. During the late 1940s and 1950s, the children of Jorge Garcia-Serra owned and managed the radio station, and Roberto Garcia-Serra was named the General Manager. In the late 1940s, when studio live radio-broadcast performances were common, Radio Garcia-Serra broadcast a program at 5 PM called \u201cTea Hour\u201d (Hora del T\u00e9) where Celia Cruz, the world-famous singer and representative of Cuba, had her beginnings. Also making a debut in Radio Garcia-Serra in that same year was Fajardo y sus Estrellas. Other late 1950s studio live performances included, Orquesta Arag\u00f3n, Orquesta Sensaci\u00f3n y Barbarito Diez. ==References== Category:Radio stations established in 1929 Category:Radio stations in Cuba ",
