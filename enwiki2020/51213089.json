It was designed to allow people suffering from the trembles to drink a beverage, initially hot chocolate. The cup sits in a saucer with either a well, or a raised rim to prevent the liquid from spilling. Cups were designed with or without handles, and optionally a lid. Many of the most famous porcelain manufacturers, such as S\u00e8vres, Meissen, and Vienna produced trembleuses. S\u00e8vres used the term Gobelet et soucoupe enfonc\u00e9 for a saucer with a well in catalogues from 1759. ==See also== * Pedro de Toledo, 1st Marquis of Mancera ==References== == External links == Category:Drinkware Category:French words and phrases Category:Teaware Category:Porcelain ",
