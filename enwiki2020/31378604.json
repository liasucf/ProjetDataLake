    "text": "MusiqInTheMagiq is the sixth studio album by the R&B; singer Musiq Soulchild. It was released on April 29, 2011, on Atlantic Records. The album entered the Billboard 200 chart at number eight, selling 34,000 copies in its first week. As of 2016, the album has sold over 111,000 copies. == Singles == No physical singles were released from the album, though two songs came out as iTunes singles, \"Anything\" and \"Yes\". The music video for \"Anything\" was directed by Phillip \"Taj\" Jackson and was officially released on May 3, 2011, on iTunes. ==Critical reception== Mark Edward Nero from About.com praised the decision by both the composers and producers to craft more up-tempo tracks that \"benefit from marriages between Musiq's soft vocals and bass-and-drum-driven beats.\" He concluded that, \"By blending his trademark starry-eyed romanticism with more urgent musical enthusiasm, Musiq has managed to craft a formula that's resulted in one of the better albums of his career so far.\" AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the record \"does not stray far from Musiq's past but features some developments, such as the singer's increased comfort with falsetto deployment (\"Sayido,\" \"Waitingstill\") and a charming mid-'60s soul throwback (\"Love Contract\").\" He gave notable praise to the final track \"Likethesun\" for having Musiq's best vocal performance over \"stop-start percussion patterns and swarming synthesizers\", saying he should do more of that style in later projects. PopMatters contributor David Amidon found the album \"pretty bland and uninspiring\", criticizing the production choices in beats and vocals, and the lyricism feeling thin on tracks like \"Single\" and \"Anything\", concluding that \"Little hints of Musiq's talents crop up here and there on MusiqInTheMagiq, but they're too few and far between to really recommend your cash come Musiq's way this time.\" == Track listing == === Deluxe edition === (co.)
