He wrote a travelogue about his life in Iran, the Trois ans \u00e0 la cour de Perse. Prior to his appointment in Iran, he served as a personal physician to Prince Nicholas of Montenegro (r. 1860\u20131918). ==Biography== Feuvrier was born in Saulx, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne to Fran\u00e7ois Antoine, a military veterinary surgeon. In 1861\u20131865, he attended the Military School of Hygiene in Strasbourg, and earned a post-doc at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce in Paris. Feuvrier served in Algeria (1861\u20131865) and Colmar (1869). He participated in the Franco- Prussian War. Feuvrier then served as a personal physician to Prince Nicholas of Montenegro (r. 1860\u20131918). He also participated under Nicholas I in the Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877) directed against the Ottoman Empire. Feuvrier succeeded another Frenchman, Joseph D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Tholozan, as the Shah's personal physician. Though his knowledge of Persian language and culture was limited (learned mainly on the spot), his travelogue provides invaluable first-hand information on an important period during the Qajar era. It is a major source of information in relation to the Tobacco Concession and the Tobacco Protest. Through his personal interest in Persian culture, Feuvrier's travelogue also provides important information on Iran's archaeology, architecture, urbanism, economy, and social life. He was awarded the Order of the Lion and the Sun (1st class with green sash) and the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur (chevalier, 1875; officier, 1890). In addition to his native French, and Persian, Feuvrier held linguistic abilities in Serbian, Italian, Russian, English, and German. He died at Saulx. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1842 births Category:1926 deaths Category:French expatriates in Iran Category:Qajar dynasty Category:19th-century French physicians Category:20th-century French physicians Category:French travel writers Category:Grand Cordons of the Order of the Lion and the Sun Category:Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:French military doctors Category:People from Haute-Sa\u00f4ne Category:French people of the Franco-Prussian War Category:French expatriates in Montenegro ",
