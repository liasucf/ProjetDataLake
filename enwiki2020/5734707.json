It is situated in the Meneage district of The Lizard peninsula south of Helston in the former administrative district of Kerrier. The parish population at the 2011 census was 1437. Mawgan-in-Meneage lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation. ==Antiquities== Evidence of early medieval habitation at Mawgan is in the form of an inscribed pillar stone, located at the meeting of three roads at the centre of the village; it bears an inscription that is no longer readable, but based on an old drawing and a photograph taken in 1936 it could have been a memorial stone to either 'Cnegumus son of Genaius' or 'Genaius son of Cnegumus'. The date of this inscription is not certain beyond having been carved before the twelfth century.See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 146-153 ==History== The name of the manor was given as Saint Mawnan in Domesday Book. The parish church is dedicated to St Mauganus, a Welshman, and he is also honoured at Mawgan in Pydar and in Wales and Brittany.Doble, G. H. (1962) The Saints of Cornwall; part 2. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 34-44 The church is a fine building of the 14th century which was enlarged in the 15th by the addition of the south aisle and the tower. The church was described in the Cornishman newspaper as \u2033... an old and dilapidated structure ...\u2033 following a storm, when the porch and the south aisle lost much of their roofing on 29 April 1882. Features of interest are a Carminow tomb of the 13th century, the Vyvyan monuments, the squint and the wagon roof. In earlier times there were other chapels in the parish, at Carminow and at Trelowarren. ==Trelowarren== Trelowarren House At Trelowarren is the estate of the Vyvyan family, who have owned it since 1427. The Halliggye Fogou at Trelowarren is the largest in Cornwall. Trelowarren House has a complex building history: the original house is mid-15th century and there are later parts dated 1662, 1698 and ca. 1750 (further additions were made during the 19th century).Pevsner, N.
