    "text": "Alfred Earle \"Greasy\" Neale (November 5, 1891 \u2013 November 2, 1973) was an American football and baseball player and coach. ==Early life and playing career== Neale was born in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Although writers eventually assumed that Neale got his nickname, \"Greasy\", from his elusiveness on the football field, it actually arose during his youth, from a name-calling joust with a friend. ==Baseball career== He played Major League Baseball as an outfielder with the Cincinnati Reds between 1916 and 1924 and briefly with the Philadelphia Phillies for part of the 1921 season. Neale was the starting right fielder for the 1919 Cincinnati Reds. He batted .357 in the 1919 World Series and led the Reds with ten hits in their eight-game series win over the scandalous White Sox. Neale spent all but 22 games of his baseball career with the Cincinnati Reds. He had a career batting average of .259 with 8 home runs, 200 RBI and 139 stolen bases, and finished in the top ten in stolen bases in the National League four times. When football season came around, often he would leave baseball and fulfill his football duties (albeit playing about 90% of a baseball season most years, with the exception of 1919 when he played the entire season, including the 1919 World Series). ==Football career== Neale also played professional football in the Ohio League with the Canton Bulldogs in 1917, the Dayton Triangles in 1918, and the Massillon Tigers in 1919. He starred as an end on Jim Thorpe's pre-World War I Canton Bulldogs as well as the Dayton Triangles in 1918 and Massillon Tigers in 1919. He coached the Triangles in 1918. ==Coaching in college== Neale began his coaching career while still a professional player. He served as the head football coach at Muskingum College (1915), West Virginia Wesleyan College (1916\u20131917), Marietta College (1919\u20131920), Washington & Jefferson College (1921\u20131922), the University of Virginia (1923\u20131928), and West Virginia University (1931\u20131933), compiling a career college football record of 82\u201354\u201311. He coached basketball for two seasons at Marietta (1919\u20131921) as well, amassing a record of 26\u201311. He also served as an assistant football coach at Yale Bulldogs football for seven seasons (1934\u20131940). At Washington & Jefferson, he led his 1921 squad to the Rose Bowl, where the Presidents played the California Golden Bears to a scoreless tie. At Virginia, Neale was also the head baseball coach from 1923 to 1929, tallying a mark of 80\u201373\u20132. ==Independent football== Neale later coached the independent professional Ironton Tanks with his legendary style, flair and winning ways. He and Tanks quarterback Glenn Presnell claimed victories against the NFL's second place New York Giants and third place Chicago Bears in 1930. The team folded in 1931. ==Coaching in the pros== Neale moved to the National Football League (NFL), serving as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1941 to 1950. Although it took Neale a while to pull together the needed talent to build a winning team, once he had the right ingredients, they stayed among the league's best for nearly a decade. From 1944 through 1949, Neale's Eagles finished second three times and in first place three times. The Eagles won the NFL Championship in 1948 and again in 1949, and became the first team to win back-to-back titles since the 1940-41 Chicago Bears by shutting out their opponents, beating the Chicago Cardinals 7\u20130 in the snow ridden 1948 NFL Championship Game and the Los Angeles Rams 14\u20130 in the 1949 NFL Championship Game in a driving rain storm. It was the last championship for the Eagles until 1960. His offense was led by the passing of quarterback Tommy Thompson, the pass catching of future Hall of Fame end Pete Pihos, and the running of another Hall of Famer, Steve Van Buren. He tallied a mark of 66\u201344\u20135 including playoff games in his ten seasons with the club. Neale was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969. Both inductions recognized his coaching career. Neale died in Florida at the age of 81 and is buried at Parkersburg Memorial Gardens in West Virginia. ==Head coaching record== ===College football=== ===NFL=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason |- !Won !!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!Won!!Lost!!Win %!!Result |- !PHI||1941 ||2||8||1||||4th in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- !PHI||1942 ||2||9||0||||5th in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- !PHI-PIT||1943 ||5||4||1||||3rd in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- !PHI||1944 ||7||1||2||||2nd in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- !PHI||1945 ||7||3||0||||2nd in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- !PHI||1946 ||6||5||0||||2nd in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |-style=\"background:#fdd;\" !PHI||1947 ||8||4||0||||1st in NFL Eastern|| 1 || 1 || || Lost to Chicago Cardinals in NFL Championship |-style=\"background:#FDE910;\" !PHI||1948 ||9||2||1||||1st in NFL Eastern|| 1 || 0 || || Won NFL Championship |-style=\"background:#FDE910;\" !PHI||1949 ||11||1||0||||1st in NFL Eastern|| 1 || 0 || || Won NFL Championship |- !PHI||1950 ||6||6||0||||3rd in NFL Eastern|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 |- ! colspan=\"2\"| PHI Total || 63 || 43 || 5 || |||| 3 || 1 || || |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Total || 63 || 43 || 5 || |||| 3 || 1 || || |} ==See also== * List of St. Louis Cardinals coaches ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * * * * Category:1891 births Category:1973 deaths Category:American football ends Category:Baseball players from West Virginia Category:Basketball coaches from West Virginia Category:Canton Bulldogs (Ohio League) players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Clarksburg Generals players Category:Cleveland Bearcats players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Dayton Triangles (Ohio League) players Category:Ironton Tanks players Category:London Tecumsehs (baseball) players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Marietta Pioneers football coaches Category:Marietta Pioneers men's basketball coaches Category:Massillon Tigers players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Muskingum Fighting Muskies football coaches Category:Parkersburg High School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Parkersburg, West Virginia Category:Philadelphia Eagles head coaches Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Players of American football from West Virginia Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Saginaw Ducks players Category:St. Louis Cardinals coaches Category:Steagles players and personnel Category:Virginia Cavaliers baseball coaches Category:Virginia Cavaliers football coaches Category:Washington & Jefferson Presidents football coaches Category:West Virginia Mountaineers football coaches Category:West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats baseball players Category:West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats basketball players Category:West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats football coaches Category:West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats football players Category:Wheeling Stogies players Category:Yale Bulldogs football coaches ",
