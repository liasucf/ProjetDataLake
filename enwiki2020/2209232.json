    "text": "Allan Jay Lichtman (; born April 4, 1947) is an American historian who has taught at American University in Washington, D.C. since 1973. Lichtman created the The Keys to the White House model, which he created with Russian seismologist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981. The model uses 13 True/False criteria to predict whether the candidate of an incumbent party will win or lose the next election for the U.S. president.\"The Keys to the White House\", Madison Books, 1996, He ran for the U.S. Senate seat from Maryland in 2006, finishing in 6th place in the Democratic primary. Lichtman authored the 2017 book The Case for Impeachment, laying out multiple arguments for the impeachment of Donald Trump. ==Early life== Lichtman was born into a Jewish family in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School. Lichtman received his B.A. degree from Brandeis University in history in 1967, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude while also running track and wrestling for the school. In 1973, Lichtman received his Ph.D. from Harvard University as a Graduate Prize Fellow, also in history. ==Career== Allan Lichtman in 2010 ===Teaching=== Lichtman began teaching at American University in 1973, rising to chair of the History Department, and was named Scholar/Professor of the Year in 1993. Outside of the classroom, Lichtman has testified as an expert witness on civil rights in more than 70 cases for the U.S. Department of Justice and for civil rights groups such as the NAACP, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund and Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also consulted for Vice President Al Gore and Senator Edward Kennedy. He assisted the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigation into voting irregularities in Florida during the 2000 election, submitting his statistical analysis of balloting problems. Lichtman concluded \"there were major racial disparities in ballot rejection rates\". In the early 1980s while living in California as a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology, Lichtman had a 17-show stint on the game show Tic Tac Dough. He won $100,000 during his time on the show.Breslev, Dia, \"AU Prof Gets the 'Dough Lichtman Wins $100,000,\" American University Eagle, February 27, 1981. ===Author and commentator=== Lichtman is best known for the \"Keys\" system, presented in his books The Thirteen Keys to the Presidency and The Keys to the White House. The system uses thirteen historical factors to predict whether the popular vote in the election for President of the United States will be won by the candidate of the party holding the presidency (regardless of whether the president is the candidate). The keys were selected based on their correlations with the presidential election results from 1860 through 1980, using statistical methods adapted from the work of geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok for predicting earthquakes. The system then correctly predicted the popular vote winner in each of the elections since 1984. In 2000, he inaccurately predicted, using his system, that Gore would be the next president. Lichtman has provided commentary for networks and cable channels such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News. In August 2020, Lichtman announced the model's prediction that presumptive Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden would be elected president. Nate Silver has criticized Lichtman's \"keys\", writing that several of the keys are subjective. For example, two of the keys are whether the incumbent has charisma and whether the challenger has charisma. Silver wrote, \"it\u2019s awfully easy to describe someone as charismatic when he or she is ahead in the polls \u2014 or when you have the advantage of hindsight and know who won an election.\" In April 2017, Lichtman authored the book The Case for Impeachment, laying out multiple arguments for the impeachment of Donald Trump. The Financial Times gave The Case for Impeachment a positive review, writing: \"Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations.\" The Washington Post called it \"striking to see the full argument unfold\". New York Journal of Books recommended it as a resource, \"if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought.\" CounterPunch characterized the work as \"a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act\". The Hill gave the author praise, writing: \"Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.\" CBC News consulted law scholars that said the fulfillment of Lichtman's impeachment prediction was unlikely, especially with a Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. Trump was impeached by the U. S. House of Representatives on December 18, 2019, but acquitted by the U. S. Senate on February 5, 2020. ===2006 U.S. Senate race in Maryland=== Lichtman announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate from Maryland in the 2006 election to replace Senator Paul Sarbanes; in a playful opening television ad, he pledged not to be a \"conventional politician\" and jumped into the C&O; Canal in a business suit.Ann Marimow, Lichtman's Big Splash, The Washington Post (March 10, 2006). Lichtman was seen as a long-shot candidates, with low support in polls.Matthew Mosk & John Wagner, Long-Shot Candidates May Harm Cardin, The Washington Post (July 24, 2006). He criticized front-runner U.S. Representative Ben Cardin for his votes in favor of funding for the Iraq War. When Lichtman was not invited by the League of Women Voters to the Maryland Public Television debate, he and other excluded candidates (Josh Rales and Dennis F. Rasmussen) protested outside the Baltimore County television studio; Lichtman and his wife were arrested after a confrontation with a security guard. In 2006, both were acquitted on all charges.Allan Lichtman, Karyn Strickler, acquitted in 2006 TV studio incident, The Washington Post (September 1, 2006). Lichtman lost in the primary election to Cardin, receiving 6,919 votes (1.2%), landing him in 6th place in a field of 18. In October 2012, The Washington Post reported that he was still paying off a mortgage he took out in order to help fund his campaign. ==Awards and honors== Lichtman has received numerous awards at American University during his career. Most notably, he was named Distinguished Professor of History in 2011 and Outstanding Scholar/Teacher for 1992\u201393, the highest faculty award at that school.
