Spitting cherry pits is an amateur sport; there are no known professional leagues of cherry spitters. There are multiple international competitions for cherry pit spitting in countries such as the US, Canada, Germany and France. The sport can be traced back many decades. In most competitions a contestant is given a cherry; this is done to prevent cheating or pit tampering, seen in the Witzenhausen competition in which cherry pits were tampered with. The pit is accessed by eating the cherry around it, then the cherry seed is spat. The pit of a cherry is very small, about the size of a front tooth, and is very slippery when first removed from the cherry, making it easy to spit. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the record cherry pit spitting distance is , set in 2004 by Brian \"Young Gun\" Krause. == Notable contests == === International Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship, Eau Claire, Michigan === The international Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship held in Eau Claire, Michigan was founded in 1974 by Herb Teichman, the owner of the Tree-mendus Fruit Farm to raise awareness for both his farm and the Tart cherry harvest.
