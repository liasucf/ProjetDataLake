In September 2018, he made his debut for the Denmark national team, as the regular squad withdrew following a players' union dispute. ==International career== In September 2018, the Danish Football Association and players' union were scheduled to sign a new national team agreement for the players of the Denmark national team prior to a friendly against Slovakia and their opening UEFA Nations League match against Wales. However, a contract dispute arose regarding the commercial rights of the players, resulting in a failure to sign a new agreement. Despite an offer from the squad to extend the previous deal to allow for further negotiations, the DBU instead named an entirely uncapped squad under the temporary management of coach John Jensen to avoid punishment from UEFA for cancelling the matches. The squad consisted of a mixture of players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), along with futsal players from the Denmark national futsal team. On 4 September 2018, F\u00f8nss was one of 24 players to be named in the replacement squad. The following day, he made his international debut in the friendly match against Slovakia, coming on as a substitute in the 71st minute for Mads Bertelsen. The match finished as a 0\u20133 away loss. In the summer 2017, after three years at Tarup-Paarup IF, F\u00f8nss moved to Stribe IF as a player- head coach.Opstart DS, tpi.dk, 11 July 2017 However, he decided to resign on 1 November 2017.F\u00f8nss har stadig lysten, fyens.dk, 1 November 2017 Following the national team appearance, in December 2018 it was announced that F\u00f8nss would sign for BK Marienlyst at the start of the winter transfer window.Fodbold- julechok: Marienlyst hugger landsholdsspiller fyens.dk. 13 December 2018.
