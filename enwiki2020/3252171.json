    "text": "The Centre line refers to a set of positions on an Australian rules football field. It consists of 3 players, two on the wings (left and right), and one in the centre. ==Wing== The two wingmen control the open spaces in the middle of the ground.Pascoe, 1995, p. 30 They can vary in size, depending on team balance or opposition match-ups, but in general they need to be highly skilled, especially in kicking. Wingmen also require considerable pace and stamina, as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack. The Victorian Football Association (VFA) abolished the wing role for many years, which sped up play and increased the average team score. However, this was not copied in other leagues. Notable wingmen in Australian football over the years include: * Wilfred \"Chicken\" Smallhorn (, 1930-1940),Pascoe, 1995, p. 31 Brownlow Medallist 1933 * Herb Matthews (, 1932-1945), Brownlow Medallist 1940 * Thorold Merrett (, 1950-1960) * Stan Alves ( and , 1965-1979) * Dick Clay (, 1966-1976) * Keith Greig (North Melbourne, 1971-1985), Brownlow Medallist 1973, 1974 and also named on wing in AFL Team of the Century (1996) * Bryan Wood (Richmond and , 1972-1986) * Robbie Flower (Melbourne, 1973-1987) * Russell Greene ( and , 1974-1988) * Michael Turner (, 1974-1988) * Robert DiPierdomenico (Hawthorn, 1975-1991), Brownlow Medallist 1986 * Doug Hawkins ( and , 1978-1995) * Dennis Carroll (, 1981-1991) * Darren Millane (Collingwood, 1984-1991) * Chris Mainwaring (, 1987-1999) * Nicky Winmar (St. Kilda and , 1987-1999) * Peter Matera (West Coast, 1990-2002) Norm Smith Medallist 1992 * Peter Riccardi (Geelong, 1992-2006) ==Centre== The centre player usually consists of a hard-running midfielder capable of feeding outside running teammates.
