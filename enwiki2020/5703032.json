    "text": "The Haunted Castle (1921), also known as Schlo\u00df Vogel\u00f6d: Die Enthullung eines Geheimnisses and Castle Vogeloed, is a silent chamber-drama directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. The film is a moody psychodrama, \"blending multiple flashbacks and dream sequences with a gloomy atmosphere.... It is one of the earliest surviving works of (F. W. Murnau).\" It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios in Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art director Hermann Warm. == Plot summary == A company of men meet for a hunt lasting several days at Castle Vogel\u00f6d, being hosted by Lord von Vogelschrey, but a sweeping rain brings the pleasure to nought and they spend their time in the inward parts of the castle. Even the not invited Count Johann Oetsch appears. He gets eschewed by other partakers of the hunt since he is reputed to have shot his own brother, Peter, a few years ago. This rumour gets nourished by a retired Judge of the District Court. The widow of the brother, the remarried Baroness Safferst\u00e4tt, is also expected \u2013 which makes the situation unpleasant for the host. Count Oetsch neglects this matter and remains. The Baroness is affrighted by their coming and determined to depart again. The report of the coming of Father Faramund, allied with her former husband, is kept back by her; she will make confession unto him. In the following days, Oetsch and the Baroness \u2013 and the Baron \u2013 accuse one another of the murder of the brother of the Count. At the same time, in flashbacks, follows a confession in stages of the Baroness, that her marriage was anything but harmonious. Her husband became more and more interested in spiritual things than in her, so that she, in the presence of Baron Safferst\u00e4tt, a friend of her husband, had wished for something \"evil\" \u2013 which in turn had falsely interpreted it and thereafter shot her husband. This common trespass had finally let her and the Baron be married, without something else to feel for each other than emptiness. The Father takes his false beard and his wig off, revealing himself as Count Oetsch who now can justify his innocence. Baron Safferst\u00e4tt shoots himself. The true Father Faramund comes to the castle. == Cast == * Arnold Korff \u2013 Lord von Vogelschrey, Schlo\u00dfherr of Vogel\u00f6d * Lulu Kyser-Korff \u2013 Centa von Vogelschrey, his wife * Lothar Mehnert \u2013 Count Johann Oetsch * Paul Hartmann \u2013 Count Peter Oetsch * Paul Bildt \u2013 Baron Safferst\u00e4tt * Olga Tschechowa \u2013 Baroness Safferst\u00e4tt * Victor Bl\u00fctner \u2013 Father Faramund * Hermann Vallentin \u2013 Judge of the District Court, retired * Julius Falkenstein \u2013 Anxious gentleman * Robert Leffler \u2013 Master of the household * Walter Kurt-Kuhle \u2013 Servant === Uncredited === * Loni Nest \u2013 Little girl * Georg Zawatzky \u2013 Apprentice cook ==References== == External links == * * Category:1921 films Category:1920s mystery films Category:1921 horror films Category:German black-and-white films Category:German silent feature films Category:German films Category:German horror films Category:Films of the Weimar Republic Category:Films directed by F.
