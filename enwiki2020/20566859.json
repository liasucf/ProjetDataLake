    "text": "Van Gogh is a 1991 French film written and directed by Maurice Pialat. It stars Jacques Dutronc in the role of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, a role for which he won the 1992 C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor. Set in 1890, the film follows the last 67 days of Van Gogh's life and explores his relationships with his brother Theo, his physician Paul Gachet (most famous as the subject of Van Gogh's painting Portrait of Dr. Gachet), and the women in his life, including Gachet's daughter, Marguerite. The film was entered into the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, and selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ==Cast== * Jacques Dutronc as Vincent van Gogh * Alexandra London as Marguerite (Gachet) * Bernard Le Coq as Theo van Gogh * G\u00e9rard S\u00e9ty as Gachet * Elsa Zylberstein as Cathy * Corinne Bourdon as Jo * Leslie Azzoulai as Adeline (as Leslie Azoulai) * Jacques Vidal as Ravoux * Lise Lam\u00e9trie as Madame Ravoux * Chantal Barbarit as Madame Chevalier * Claudine Ducret as Piano Teacher * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonpart as La Mouche * Maurice Coussonneau as Chaponval * Didier Barbier as The Idiot * Gilbert Pignol as Gilbert * Andr\u00e9 Bernot as The Red Mound ==Approach to biography== The film is noted for its anti-melodramaticChicago Reader: Van Gogh and unsensationalisticBBC Review: Van Gogh approach to Van Gogh's life. For this reason it is often contrasted with Vincente Minnelli's Van Gogh film Lust for Life. Very little time is devoted to Van Gogh's art and work, with the bulk of the 158-minute running time occupied by the artist's often difficult personal relationships and declining mental state. The film omits most references to many of the most famous incidents in Van Gogh's life (including his attempt to cut off his ear in 1888) in favor of concentrating on the social dynamics of the late 19th century. Writing in The Washington Post, critic Desson Howe explains: \"In the movie, you don't see Van Gogh (Jacques Dutronc) complete the final brush stroke of a masterpiece, then call up old Gauguin for a celebratory absinthe. You do see a thin, stringy man, suffering from headaches, enjoying whores and moping around irascibly. Van Gogh denies you familiar highlights, keeps you from his working elbow and avoids the Ear Thing. But it shows you the quotidian stuff in between. This is the story of an artist being human, carrying canvases out or lugging them back in \u2013 their famous images intentionally out of sight.\" ==See also== * List of submissions to the 64th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1990s biographical drama films Category:1991 films Category:Films directed by Maurice Pialat Category:Films featuring a Best Actor C\u00e9sar Award-winning performance Category:Films set in 1890 Category:Films set in France Category:French biographical drama films Category:French films Category:Gaumont Film Company films Category:Biographical films about Vincent van Gogh Category:1991 drama films ",
