    "text": "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is the fifth studio album by American rapper Logic. The album was announced on March 19, 2019, with a video for the album's title track. It was released on May 10, 2019, by Def Jam Recordings and Visionary Music Group. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was Logic's second release in less than two months, following Supermarket in March, which served as a soundtrack for the novel of the same name. The album features guest appearances from rappers Eminem, Gucci Mane, G-Eazy, Will Smith, Wiz Khalifa, and DMV native YBN Cordae, along with vocals from Logic's father Smokey Hall, who is credited as \"My Dad\". Meanwhile, production was handled by Logic's frequent producer 6ix, who serves as an executive producer, while additional production came from Cubeatz, DJ Khalil, Frank Dukes, Haze, and Illmind, among others. Despite sales being lower than those of his other projects, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making it Logic's third album to reach the top of the chart. ==Release and promotion== The album's first single, \"Keanu Reeves\", was released on January 18, 2019. The music video for the album's second single, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", was released on March 19, 2019, with the song being released three days later on March 22. The album's third single, \"Homicide\", was released on May 3, and featured a guest verse from Eminem. The album's release date and artwork were revealed on May 8, via social media. The album's track list was announced the following day. On May 10, the album was released along with its fourth single, \"Icy\" featuring Gucci Mane. ==Critical reception== Confessions of a Dangerous Mind received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 65, based on four reviews. In a positive review, Kyle Mullin of Exclaim! gave the album seven out of ten stars, particularly praising the album's title track, but criticizing the album's lack of substance: \"Fun and compelling as such high points can be, nothing on this album reaches the strata of the title track. If Confessions of a Dangerous Mind had a few more compelling confessions and vulnerable couplets, then Logic wouldn't need to impress us with flexes like a Fresh Prince feature.\" In a mixed review, Daniel Spielberger of HipHopDX gave the album a 2.9 out of 5, stating \"For some artists, being self-aware is humanizing. While for others, it can just illuminate their insecurities. Logic's fifth studio album Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is an unfortunate example of the latter scenario.\" Many fans have criticized the album for its lack of substance. ==Commercial performance== Confessions of a Dangerous Mind debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 80,000 album-equivalent units, including 24,000 pure album sales in its first week. It is Logic's third US number-one album. In its second week, the album dropped to number eight on the chart, earning 29,000 units. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Tidal and Spotify.
