    "text": "M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed ( 1853-1937) was one of the sons of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. He was the eldest son of his father's second wife, Fatimih Khanum, later known as Mahd-i-'Ulya, whom Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h married in Tehran in 1849. Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed received the title from his father of G\u035fhusn-i- Akbar (\"Greatest Branch\" or \"Greater Branch\").The elative is a stage of gradation in Arabic that can be used both for a superlative or a comparative. G\u035fhusn-i-Akbar could mean \"Greatest Branch\" or \"Greater Branch.\" ==Early years== M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed was born on December 16, 1853 in Baghdad during Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's first year of exile in that city. In 1863, at the age of nine, he accompanied his family in their exile to Constantinople and Adrianople. During the final days in Adrianople, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed wrote about eighty letters to the believers of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, such as those in Baghdad and its surrounding towns. He also asked permission of his father to travel abroad and spread the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. At the age of fifteen, when Baha\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's family was imprisoned in Acre, the duty of copying Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's writings was given to M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed. ==Dispute with \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1== In the Kit\u00e1b-i-\u02bbAhd (\"Book of the Covenant\"), Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h appointed \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 as his successor, with Muhammad \u02bbAli given a station \"beneath\" that of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. Both were noted explicitly by their titles, with Muhammad Ali being called G\u035fhusn-i-Akbar and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 being called G\u035fhusn-i-A\u02bbzam. As time passed, Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed claimed that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was not sharing power. According to some interpretations, Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed insisted that he should instead be regarded as the leader of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. Many accusations were leveled against each other by both \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed, culminating in Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed's accusing his older brother of conspiring against the Ottoman government. This resulted in the imprisonment and near-death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and his family. Almost all Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds accepted \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 as Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's successor. At the time of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's death, Shoghi Effendi was appointed the Guardian of the Faith by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in his Will and Testament, while Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed was reprimanded in the same document as \"The Center of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief.\" Because Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's Kit\u00e1b-i-\u02bbAhd named Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed as \"after\" \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's, he took the opportunity of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's death to try to revive his claim to leadership, but his attempt to occupy the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h by force left him on the losing end of a legal battle that removed any rights he had to the property. The division between rival sects with M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed and Shoghi Effendi as their respective leaders was short-lived and Shoghi Effendi emerged as the leader of the global Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community, labeling Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed the arch-breaker of the Covenant of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed would lead the small Unitarian Baha'i denomination. In 1904, he sent his oldest son, Shua Ullah Behai, to the United States where he led the Unitarian Baha'i community. From 1934 to 1937, Behai published Behai Quarterly, a \"Unitarian\" Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed magazine written in English and featuring the writings of Mirza Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed and various other Unitarian Bahais, including Ibrahim George Kheiralla. This schism had very little effect overall. In the \u02bbAkk\u00e1 area, the followers of Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed represented six families at most, they had no common religious activities, and were almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society. This group essentially disappeared. Quote from source: \"After the death of Shoghi Effendi (1957) the only significant oppositional movement was that led by \u2026 C. M. Remey\u2026. The movement subsequently splintered\u2026.\" A modern academic observer has reported an ineffectual attempt to revive the claims of Muhammad Ali. Some of Mirza Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed's works that were preserved by his family have been published in A Lost History of the Baha'i Faith: The Progressive Tradition of Baha'u'llah's Forgotten Family. M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed succeeds Late \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Jan 11 1922 M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed. Detail from a larger photograph, assumed to have been taken in Adrianople in 1868, when \u02bbAl\u00ed was 16. ==Death== Mirza Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed died on December 10, 1937, in Haifa Palestine. His remains were carried by hand from his house to King's Way, a distance of one mile, where the remains were placed on a vehicle and escorted to Acre, where again he was carried by hand to his burial plot at Bahji, near the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Memorial services were held at Haifa on Tuesday, January the 18th, 1938. Some supplications which were revealed by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h towards M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed were recited: : \u201c..O my God, verily this is a branch who hath branched from the firm and lofty tree of Thy Singleness and One-ness\u2026. assist him with the hosts of earth and heaven, and help, O my God, whosoever helpeth him, choose whosoever chooseth him, and assist whosoever cometh to him. Then forsake whosoever denieth him and desireth him not.\u201d His death was broadcast by radio stations, including the British Broadcasting Corporation. Some individuals who delivered memorial speeches include Abdullah Bey Mokhles (Professor and the Secretary of National Muslim Society), Bishop Hajjar (Archbishop of Acre for the Melkite Greek Catholic Church), Wadi Effendi Boustani (Arabian philosopher poet and prominent advocate), and Abu Salma (20th century Palestinian poet). == See also == *Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's family *Shua Ullah Behai *Covenant-breaker *Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed divisions ==Notes and citations== ;Notes ;Citations == References == * * * * * * * Category:1853 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed divisions Category:Family of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h Category:People from Baghdad ",
