It was a sanjak centre at first in Budin Province (1566\u20131601), later in Kanije Province (1601\u20131689). The former Andr\u00e1ssy Palace is next to them. Some other monuments in the town date back to Ottoman times. Two years after the siege, the mosque of Ali Pasha was built, later \u2013 in 1788 \u2013 to be transformed into a Christian church: the Roman Catholic parish church. The two minarets, as well as the windows and niches with ogee arches indicate its original function. The Turkish House of red raw brick walls and interlaced steel window grills in B\u00e1stya Street was originally destined to be a caravanserai. The two holy-water basins of the Franciscan Church were made of Turkish washbasins. The carved main altar of the Baroque Church is another sight to see. In 1966, on the 400th anniversary of the siege, Szigetv\u00e1r regained its old rank of a chartered ancient city. Development began to gather speed. Today it has a population of 12,000. In October 2011, the city received the title Civitas Invicta from the Hungarian Parliament. In 1994, the Hungarian-Turkish Friendship Park () was established as a public park, dedicated in memorial to the Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r.
