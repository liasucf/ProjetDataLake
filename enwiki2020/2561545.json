    "text": "The Intertec Superbrain was an all-in-one commercial microcomputer that was first sold by Intertec Data Systems Corp. of Columbia, South Carolina, USA in 1979. The machine ran the operating system CP/M and was somewhat unusual in that it used dual Z80 CPUs, the second being used as a disk controller. In 1983, the basic machine sold for about $2000. There were several variants, including the Superbrain II, Superbrain II Jr., \"QD\" (quad density disk drives) and \"SD\" (super density) models. The Superbrain is notable for being at the user end of the first Kermit connection in 1981. The machine was practical and useful in the office environment, but somewhat limited until the arrival of the first 5MB hard drive in one of the floppy drive bays. This was soon replaced by the 10MB hard drive that effectively removed all limitations on what could be programmed and stored. ==Specifications== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Model Number !
