    "text": "__NOTOC__ Jose Maria Rodriguez Madoz (born 1958) better known as Chema Madoz, is a Spanish photographer, best known for his black and white surrealist and poetic photographs. Chema Madoz studied Art History at Universidad Complutense de Madrid between 1980 and 1983. It is here that he was first exposed to the study of photography and imaging. In an interview published in 2001, Chema explains that he currently uses a Hasselblad camera to take his photos. The book, Chema Madoz: Objetos 1990-1999 was presumably shot entirely with this camera, rather than the 6\u00d76 Mamiya he has used previously. In November 2011, Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia of Spain, with Chilean first lady Cecilia Morel, opened an exhibition of Chema Madoz's work at the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo (Santiago, Chile).http://primeradama.presidencia.cl/frmNoticias.aspx?Id=293&t;=Cecilia%20Morel%20participa%20junto%20a%20los%20Pr%C3%ADncipes%20de%20Asturias%20en%20exposici%C3%B3n%20de%20fotograf%C3%ADa . ==Bibliography== * Chema Madoz: Objetos 1990-1999\\. 2001. * \"Chema Madoz \"Metamorfosis del Pensamiento\" Exhibition Catalog of the exhibition: Chema Madoz \"Metamorfosis del Pensamiento\" on D.O.P.
