Shaw was a staunch Liberal and believer in free trade, who intended to warn of the dangers of protectionism. Fellow Liberal Robert Spence Watson wrote the book's introduction, calling it a reminder of the condition of child labour in the 1840s and as an inspiration to improve children's conditions. However, despite Watson financing 1500 copies, Shaw's autobiography did not sell well. The novelist Arnold Bennett used the book as a source for Clayhanger (1910) and it was republished in 1969, since when it has received more attention and is > ...now valued both as a moving firsthand account of child labour in the > pottery industry, and as a narrative of his \u2018pursuit of knowledge under > difficulties\u2019, inspired by the values of self-help and his religious faith, > which enabled him to escape from a life of manual labour.
