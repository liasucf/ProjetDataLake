    "text": "Gus Lewis (born 19 January 1993) is an American-born English actor. He is best known for playing the young Bruce Wayne in the 2005 blockbuster film Batman Begins, co-starring with Christian Bale and Michael Caine. That year, he also co-starred in the film Asylum alongside Hugh Bonneville and Natasha Richardson. ==Career== In 2005, Lewis played a young Bruce Wayne in the film Batman Begins, whose adult counterpart was Christian Bale. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry observed that Lewis played \"an intense and appealing\" child, while Orlando Weekly opined that the actor \"makes a strong impression as the 8-year-old Bruce, leaving a firm foundation for Bale's haunted-scion act.\" Lewis played Charlie Raphael in the 2005 drama film Asylum, the son of characters played by Hugh Bonneville and Natasha Richardson. The Washington Times Gary Arnold observed that Lewis portrayed the only sympathetic person in the film. For the film, Lewis had to perform a stunt involving the near drowning of his character. While they used a nine- year-old stunt child for the wider shots, the close-ups used Lewis and his co- star Rhydian Jones. Lewis' mother was constantly nearby during its filming. Lewis appeared as Matthew Couillard, a real-life person who survived a deadly snowstorm while skiing in Turkey with his father, in a 2006 episode of the documentary television series I Shouldn't Be Alive. In 2008, Lewis worked on the dramatised documentary The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall, which depicted the real-life story of a young peace activist who is killed in Israel. In 2012, Lewis appeared in the short film The End, which won Best Film at HollyShorts Film Festival. It also won the Award of Merit at the Lucerne International Film Festival. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:English male film actors Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:English male television actors ",
