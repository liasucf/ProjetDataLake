Her father was a physician in Nigeria but found employment as a taxi driver while he waited to transfer his qualifications. Adeyemi's mother worked as a cleaning woman. Adeyemi grew up in Chicago and was not exposed to her Nigerian heritage; her parents decided not to teach her or her siblings their native tongue. She would later embrace her heritage as an adult, explaining, \"I didn't think too much of it and I think that is the kind of an experience of the first generation. You're just trying to fit in. You don't realize how cool your culture is until you get out of that phase of trying to fit in.\" She would later describe one of her novels as a love letter to her culture.Kembrey, Melanie (March 9, 2018). \"Interview: Tomi Adeyemi and her fantasy novel inspired by Black Lives Matter\", The Sydney Morning Herald. Adeyemi wrote her first story when she was five years old, and continued to write throughout her teenage years. She graduated from Hinsdale Central High School in Hinsdale, Illinois in 2011.Wols, Lauren; Eck, Everett; Anderson, Hannah (March 21, 2018). \"New author Tomi Adeyemi visits her alma mater\". Hinsdale Central High School (Hinsdale, Illinois). Tomi was qualified into the Hinsdale Central High School Foundation's Young Scholar Program in 2008 and went on to win their \"Young Scholars\" scholarship in 2010\u20132011. During her senior year, Tomi also received the Rani Sharma scholarship. She went on to graduate from Harvard University with an honors degree in English Literature, then studied West African mythology and culture in Salvador, Brazil, on a fellowship. It was this experience that inspired her to write Children of Blood and Bone, the breakthrough novel that would launch her career. ==Career== Adeyemi, top left, with other fantasy authors at a panel discussion at the 2017 New York Comic Con After Adeyemi moved to California, she worked at a Los Angeles film production company. When she decided to reduce her hours there to write a book, her parents, who had uprooted their lives in Nigeria to give her a better life, were not entirely accepting of this idea. Adeyemi says, \"I'm first-generation Nigerian so I came out of my mother's womb and I was supposed to be a doctor, a lawyer or engineer, and I was like 'oh hey, I'm quitting my very well-paying job at a very stable company that has many future job opportunities for me' ... I'm so lucky that my parents were like, 'obviously we're not crazy about this but we love you'.\" While working on her first novel Adeyemi was a creative writing coach. Adeyemi's first written novel did not yield positive feedback. She instead set herself a year to write another book that became Children of Blood and Bone, and she entered it into Pitch Wars, a competition program in which emerging writers are matched with editors and authors to revise their work before they submit it to a literary agent. Adeyemi's debut novel, Children of Blood and Bone, was released in March 2018, and debuted at number 1 on The New York Times Young Adult Hardcover Bestseller List. It is a young-adult (YA) fantasy novel, featuring protagonist Z\u00e9lie Adebola, who fights a monarchy to return magic to her people. Adeyemi has said she wanted to write a fantasy novel set in West Africa so that \"a little Black girl [could] pick up my book one day and see herself as the star...I want her to know that she\u2019s beautiful and she matters and she can have a crazy, magical adventure even if an ignorant part of the world tells her she can never be Hermione Granger.\" Children of Blood and Bone was awarded the 2018 Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy and is a finalist for the 2019 Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book. Fox 2000 has purchased the film adaptation rights to the book. Reportedly the deals for the publishing and film rights were approximately seven figures. Deadline described it as \"one of the biggest YA debut novel publishing deals ever.\" Adeyemi made a guest appearance in the final episode of Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis. For reasons unclear, her second novel, Children of Virtue and Vengeance was pushed back from its initial release date of March 2019 to June 2019. According to some Amazon users, the book was pushed back again from June 2019 to December 2019. Adeyemi later admitted on her Instagram that her publisher offered her two choices: June 2019 and December 2019, but she chose the former so fans would not have to wait. Unfortunately, the workload was too much and the author, editors, and publisher agreed to give the second book more time. Children of Virtue and Vengeance became a #1 New York Times Bestseller in 2019. In addition to her success as a novelist, Tomi teaches creative writing through her online course, The Writer's Roadmap. Her website has been named one of the 101 best websites for writers by Writer\u2019s Digest. ==Personal life== Adeyemi lives in San Diego, California. She is of Yoruba heritage. ==Controversy== In November 2018, Adeyemi accused Nora Roberts of plagiarizing the title of her book, Children of Blood and Bone. Adeyemi later retracted the accusation saying \"after talking to her, I believe our titles were created in isolation\". Roberts later clarified that her book had been titled and submitted to her publisher one year before Adeyemi's. She also criticised Adeyemi's lack of fact checking and the fact that Adeyemi had not deleted the accusation a day later. According to the United States Copyright Office, copyright \"does not protect names, titles, slogans, or short phrases.\" ==Works== * Children of Blood and Bone (March 6, 2018) * Children of Virtue and Vengeance (December 3, 2019) ==References== ==External links== * Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:Living people Category:American people of Nigerian descent Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American writers of young adult literature Category:American fantasy writers Category:Afrofuturist writers Category:1993 births Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American people of Yoruba descent Category:Yoruba women writers Category:Writers from San Diego Category:African-American women writers ",
