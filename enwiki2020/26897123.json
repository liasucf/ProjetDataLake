Since 1927, the park has seen many improvements. Two reservable picnic areas and several other individual picnic areas have been added. A pool was constructed, which was used by the Bakersfield High School swim team, as well as several outdoor sports courts. In 2004, an aquatics center was constructed in downtown Bakersfield. Around the same time, many local pools in public parks, including Jasto Park, were in need of refurbishment. The city decided to remove the pool at Jastro Park instead of refurbish it.
