    "text": "A DOE drawing of the W85 warhead. The W85 was a thermonuclear warhead developed by the United States of America to arm the Pershing II missile. It had a variable yield and was often referred to as \"dial-a-yield\" which could be set between 5 and 80 kilotons. ==Overview== The Pershing Ia missile was armed with a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. By the early 1970s it was clear that this was far too large to allow the missile to be used as a tactical nuclear weapon -- by this time 400 kt was larger than most strategic warheads. The Pershing II had a high accuracy maneuverable reentry vehicle (MARV), equipped with a radar terminal guidance system and carrying a low yield W85 warhead. Like many US nuclear weapons, it was a development of the B61 nuclear bomb - in this case, a modification of the Mod 3/4 design. After the Pershing missiles were scrapped, all 120 of the W85 warheads produced were modified into B61 bombs, in this case the B61-10 free-fall weapon. ==Specifications== The W85 was a cylinder in diameter and long. The warhead weighed . It had a variable yield from . ==References== Category:Nuclear warheads of the United States ",
