    "text": "The 2015 Kansas City Chiefs season was the franchise's 46th season in the National Football League, the 56th overall and the third under the head coach/general manager tandem of Andy Reid and John Dorsey. The Chiefs went through a poor start in their first 6 games as they were 1\u20135, and lost their star running back, Jamaal Charles due to a torn ACL in his right knee during an 18\u201317 Week 5 loss at home against the Chicago Bears. In week 16, after their 9th consecutive victory and the Baltimore Ravens defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Chiefs clinched a playoff berth, their 2nd in 3 years. They are the first team since the 1970 Cincinnati Bengals to start the season 1\u20135 and qualify for the playoffs. They also set the franchise record for the most consecutive victories, winning 10 in a row. In their Wild Card matchup, the Chiefs played the Houston Texans. The Chiefs defeated the Texans 30\u20130 to earn their first playoff win in 22 years. The following week, they were defeated by the New England Patriots in the Divisional round by a score of 27\u201320. Two Chiefs took home awards at the 5th Annual NFL Honors honoring performances from the 2015 season. Cornerback Marcus Peters won Defensive Rookie of the Year after leading the NFL in interceptions. Safety Eric Berry won Comeback Player of the Year after a Pro Bowl season the year after having his season cut short due to a lymphoma diagnosis. ==Roster changes== ===Offseason=== ====Reserve/future free agent contracts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Player || Position |- | Brandon Barden || TE |- | Armon Binns || WR |- | Hebron Fangupo || DT |- | Curtis Feight || T |- | Brandon Hartson || LS |- | Ricky Henry || G |- | Aaron Hester || CB |- | Deji Olatoye || |- | Jarrod Pughsley || T |- | Da'Rick Rogers || WR |- | Adam Schiltz || TE |- | Derek Sherrod || T |- | Spencer Ware || RB |- | Fred Williams || WR |- | Jerel Worthy || DT |} ====Cuts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Position || Player || 2015 team |- | LB || Joe Mays || New York Jets |- | DT || Vance Walker || Denver Broncos |- | TE || Anthony Fasano || Tennessee Titans |- | WR || Donnie Avery || None |- | WR || A.

The second touchdown was a critical fumble by running back Jamaal Charles. With the heartbreaking and stunning loss, the Chiefs fell to 1\u20131, and picked up their 7th straight loss to Denver. ====Week 3: at Green Bay Packers==== In a rematch of the 2011 game, the Chiefs fell to 1\u20132. ====Week 4: at Cincinnati Bengals==== Cairo Santos would kick 7 field goals in this game, setting a new franchise record for most field goals in one game by a Kansas City kicker. The 7 kicks also tied an NFL record. However, the 7 field goals by Santos were not enough to beat the Bengals, as the Chiefs fell to 1\u20133. ====Week 5: vs. Chicago Bears==== The Chiefs would build a 17\u20133 lead at one point, but Chicago would pull off a miraculous comeback to win 18\u201317. The Chiefs tried a 66-yard field goal, but Santos kick went wide right and missed everything near the goalposts. During this game, the Bears fans at times outnumbered the Chiefs fans, as Chicago fans are best known for good travel. With the loss, Kansas City fell to 1\u20134. They would also lose Jamaal Charles for the season, as he tore his ACL in this game. ====Week 6: at Minnesota Vikings==== With their 5th straight loss, the Chiefs fell to 1\u20135. ====Week 7: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers==== Ben Roethlisberger would not play in this game for the Steelers, so backup quarterback Landry Jones led the way for the Steelers. In his first career start, the Chiefs defense would force 3 turnovers, 2 of them interceptions, and the Chiefs would hold on to win 23\u201313. With the win, the Chiefs improved to 2\u20135. ====Week 8: vs. Detroit Lions==== NFL International Series In their first ever game in London, the Chiefs routed the crestfallen 1\u20136 Detroit Lions. With the win, Kansas City improved to 3\u20135. ====Week 10: at Denver Broncos==== Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning would set the all-time record for most passing yards in NFL history in this game, but the Chiefs defense would have themselves a day, picking off Bronco quarterbacks 5 times, 4 by Manning, 1 by Brock Osweiler, and the Chiefs routed the Broncos, 29\u201313. With the win, the Chiefs went to 4\u20135, and snapped their 7-game losing streak against the Broncos. ====Week 11: at San Diego Chargers==== With the huge win, Kansas City went to 5\u20135, and climbed back into playoff contention. ====Week 12: vs. Buffalo Bills==== With the win, Kansas City went to 6\u20135. ====Week 13: at Oakland Raiders==== With the win, the Chiefs went to 7\u20135. ====Week 14: vs. San Diego Chargers==== With the low-scoring win, the Chiefs went to 8\u20135 and swept the Chargers for the second straight season. ====Week 15: at Baltimore Ravens==== Rookie Marcus Peters would put the dagger into the Ravens, as he returned an interception 90 yards for a touchdown. With the win, the Chiefs went to 9\u20135. ====Week 16: vs. Cleveland Browns==== The Browns, led by Johnny Manziel, attempted a comeback to put a stop to Kansas City's playoff hopes, but Cleveland did not have any timeouts remaining, and they ultimately ran out of time when Manziel couldn't advance the ball down the field fast enough. With the win, the Chiefs went to 10\u20135 and clinched a playoff spot. ====Week 17: vs. Oakland Raiders==== With their 10th straight win, the Chiefs ended their season at 11\u20135. They were the first team to end a season with 10 or more consecutive wins since the 2012 Broncos won 11 in a row to end their season. ===Postseason=== ====AFC Wild Card Playoffs: at (#4) Houston Texans==== The Texans, who won the AFC South division with a 9\u20137 record, were completely crushed by the Chiefs. The Chiefs made postseason history as the first ever team to score a kick return touchdown in the opening play of the playoffs, when Knile Davis returned the opening kick 106 yards for a touchdown. After that, the game started to slow down, 3 and out Texans, 3 & out Chiefs, followed by a string of turnovers, Eric Berry's interception of Brian Hoyer, Brian Cushing's interception of Alex Smith two plays later, and a Hoyer fumble recovered by Dontari Poe on the ensuing drive. The Chiefs made a field goal on the drive, and although the team was able to get to the 2 yard line, a negative run by J. J. Watt and another interception by Hoyer ended the Texans' closest chance at scoring in the entire game. Although the Texans' defense forced a 3-and-out, Hoyer threw his third interception to Marcus Peters on the second play of their drive. ====AFC Divisional Playoffs: at (#2) New England Patriots==== The Chiefs, who had won 11 straight, travelled to Gillete Stadium to face the Patriots, who had advanced to the AFC Championship for the last 5 years. The Patriots scored first blood with a Rob Gronkowski touchdown catch, followed by a Cairo Santos field goal for Kansas City. The pattern was duplicated in the 2nd quarter, with Tom Brady rushing for a score before Santos kicked another field goal. In the 3rd quarter, after Gronkowski scored his second TD, Alex Smith threw his first to Albert Wilson. The Patriots responded with 2 fourth quarter field goals to make the score 27\u201313 with 10:20 left. Although the Chiefs go on a touchdown drive late in the game, the drive took up over 5 minutes, and the Chiefs had to force a 3 and out (with 3 timeouts) to have a chance. On 2nd down, when Brady threw the ball instead of running it to waste time, the ball was batted and miraculously caught by Julian Edelman for a 1st down, ending the game. ==Standings== ===Division=== ===Conference=== ==References== ==External links== * Kansas City Category:Kansas City Chiefs seasons Category:NFL International Series participants Kansas City Chiefs ",
