A separate farm club called FC Saturn-2 Moscow Oblast played in the Russian Second Division from 2009 to 2012. ==Current squad== As of 21 August 2020, according to the PFL website. ==Supporters== The football club Saturn Ramenskoye (FCSR) supporters movement was born in the second part of the 1980s when the team started playing on the professional level. The organised group of fans at that time consisted of not more than 20 people; however the first trips (Russian: \u0432\u044b\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430) to Tula, Kaluga, Pskov and other cities were already done by them in 1986. The new age for FCSR supportive movement is connected with the year 1995. Then the famous supporter Andrey Egorishev (nicknamed \"Arsenal\") had begun to unite fans of Saturn. It is believed that the team played in black and blue colors because of him. In 1996 Saturn had played in red and white colors. Fans who disliked these colors (because of ideological views) had many discussions \u2013 and finally chose black and blue colors. Some time after that the team changed colors too. The first union of FCSR fans \u2013 Dorf Menschen (the bumpkins; the German translates literally as \"Village People\") \u2013 was organised in January 1996. At that moment it consisted from about 15 people, but its size (as the size of FCSR fans in common) has been increasing. Many groups of fans were formed (mainly according to geographical location). Because a large number of these groups became uncontrollable, it was decided to unite them around a Dorf Menschen. The South-East Confederation (Russian: \u00ab\u042e\u0433\u043e-\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u00bb) was formed in this way. It was able to gather about one thousand supporters at the home game. At the moment the main FCSR band is \"BBS firm\" whose name means \"Black Blue Supporters\". After beginning to play in the highest Russian league, the structure of the FCSR supportive movement has been changed a lot. There are some different unions at the moment, both hooligans and ultras, which are united by the 46 km. The main enemies of Saturn fans are fans of FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Shinnik Yaroslavl and FC Khimki. There is the friendship between FCSR fans and fans of Torpedo Moscow and Spartak Moscow. Many FCSR fans' nicknames are connected with the aliens' club name. The black and blue fans themselves mostly use the nickname gumy (\"\u0433\u0443\u043c\u044b\") (short form of Russian \"\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0438\u0434\" \u2013 \"humanoid\"). ==Notable players== Had international caps for their respective countries.
