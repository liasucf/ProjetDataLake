    "text": "The swimming competitions of the 1984 Summer Olympics were held at the McDonald's Olympic Swim Stadium, located on the University of Southern California (USC) campus. There were a total of 494 participants from 67 countries competing. This was the first Olympic games at which only two swimmers per country, per event, were permitted; previously, three swimmers were allowed and many countries would sweep the medal stand. In addition, the Women\u2019s 200 Meters Medley returned to the program after being absent in 1976 and 1980, after a proposal by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOC).https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984/synchronized-swimmingSports Referencehttps://books.google.com/books?id=o-dD3p8eTYUC&pg;=PA272Sports Reference ==Medal table== ==Medal summary== ===Men's events=== {| |- | 100 m freestyle | || 49.80 | || 50.24 | || 50.31 |- | 200 m freestyle | || 1:47.44 | || 1:49.10 | || 1:49.69 |- | 400 m freestyle | || 3:51.23 | || 3:51.49 | || 3:51.79 |- | 1500 m freestyle | || 15:05.20 | || 15:10.59 | || 15:12.11 |- | 100 m backstroke | || 55.79 | || 56.35 | || 56.49 |- | 200 m backstroke | || 2:00.23 | || 2:01.75 | || 2:02.37 |- | 100 m breaststroke | || 1:01.65 | || 1:01.99 | || 1:02.97 |- | 200 m breaststroke | || 2:13.34 | || 2:15.79 | || 2:17.41 |- | 100 m butterfly | || 53.08 | || 53.23 | || 53.85 |- | 200 m butterfly | || 1:57.04 | || 1:57.40 | || 1:57.51 |- | 200 m individual medley | || 2:01.42 | || 2:03.05 | || 2:04.38 |- | 400 m individual medley | || 4:17.41 | || 4:18.45 | || 4:20.50 |-valign=\"top\" | 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay | Chris Cavanaugh Mike Heath Matt Biondi Rowdy Gaines Tom Jager* Robin Leamy*|| 3:19.03 | Greg Fasala Neil Brooks Michael Delany Mark Stockwell || 3:19.68 | Thomas Lejdstr\u00f6m Per Johansson Bengt Baron Mikael \u00d6rn Rikard Milton* Michael S\u00f6derlund*|| 3:22.69 |-valign=\"top\" | 4\u00d7200 m freestyle relay | Mike Heath David Larson Jeff Float Bruce Hayes Geoff Gaberino* Richard Saeger*|| 7:15.69 | Thomas Fahrner Dirk Korthals Alexander Schowtka Michael Gross Rainer Henkel* || 7:15.73 | Neil Cochran Paul Easter Paul Howe Andrew Astbury || 7:24.78 |-valign=\"top\" | 4\u00d7100 m medley relay | Rick Carey Steve Lundquist Pablo Morales Rowdy Gaines Dave Wilson* Richard Schroeder* Mike Heath* Tom Jager* || 3:39.30 | Mike West Victor Davis Tom Ponting Sandy Goss || 3:43.23 | Mark Kerry Peter Evans Glenn Buchanan Mark Stockwell Jon Sieben* Neil Brooks* || 3:43.25 |} * Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals. ===Women's events=== {| |-valign=\"top\" |rowspan=2 | 100 m freestyle | ||rowspan=2| 55.92 |rowspan=2 |none awarded ||rowspan=2| |rowspan=2 | ||rowspan=2| 56.08 |- | |- | 200 m freestyle | || 1:59.23 | || 1:59.50 | || 1:59.69 |- | 400 m freestyle | || 4:07.10 | || 4:10.29 | || 4:11.49 |- | 800 m freestyle | || 8:24.95 | || 8:30.73 | || 8:32.60 |- | 100 m backstroke | || 1:02.55 | || 1:02.63 | || 1:02.91 |- | 200 m backstroke | || 2:12.38 | || 2:13.04 | || 2:13.29 |- | 100 m breaststroke | || 1:09.88 | || 1:10.69 | || 1:10.70 |- | 200 m breaststroke | || 2:30.38 | || 2:31.15 | || 2:31.40 |- | 100 m butterfly | || 59.26 | || 1:00.19 | || 1:01.36 |- | 200 m butterfly | || 2:06.90 | || 2:10.56 | || 2:11.91 |- | 200 m individual medley | || 2:12.64 | || 2:15.17 | || 2:15.92 |- | 400 m individual medley | || 4:39.24 | || 4:48.30 | || 4:48.57 |-valign=\"top\" | 4\u00d7100 m freestyle relay | Jenna Johnson Carrie Steinseifer Dara Torres Nancy Hogshead Jill Sterkel* Mary Wayte* || 3:43.43 | Annemarie Verstappen Desi Reijers Elles Voskes Conny van Bentum Wilma van Velsen* || 3:44.40 | Iris Zscherpe Susanne Schuster Christiane Pielke Karin Seick || 3:45.56 |-valign=\"top\" | 4\u00d7100 m medley relay | Theresa Andrews Tracy Caulkins Mary T.
