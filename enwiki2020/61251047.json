At Blackburn he initially played with the under-23 team, before moving on loan to Barrow in November 2019. In January 2020 he extended the loan until the end of the season, and later that month recovered from a chest infection. The loan deal had ended by 22 April 2020. On 28 July 2020 he moved on loan to Bolton Wanderers for the 2019\u201320 season.
