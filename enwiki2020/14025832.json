The Michigan State Spartans defeated the USC Trojans 20\u201317 in a bowl rematch that was much closer than the 27\u201313 Spartan victory in the regular season.

This was the last Rose Bowl game televised by NBC Sports, ending a 37-year partnership. ABC Sports picked up rights to broadcast the game the following year. This was the Big Ten's first Rose Bowl win in seven years. ==Teams== The teams opened the season against each other in East Lansing, Michigan in a nationally-televised game on Labor Day night. Michigan State took advantage of three USC turnovers to defeat the Trojans, 27\u201313. ===Michigan State Spartans=== Led by head coach George Perles, a former Pittsburgh Steelers assistant coach, Michigan State had its best team in many years. The Spartans beat traditional Big 10 powers Michigan and Ohio State, and won the Big Ten by 1\u00bd games over Indiana and Iowa, who tied for second place. They followed up the USC win by a 31\u20138 loss at Notre Dame, and then a 31\u20133 home loss to Florida State. The season got back on track with a 19\u201314 win at Iowa. A dramatic 17\u201311 win over in state rival Michigan occurred on October 10. On October 31, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, making this the first season since the 1966 National Championship when the Spartans defeated both Michigan and Ohio State. The Indiana Hoosiers also had beaten Michigan and Ohio State, and the meeting between Michigan State and Indiana on November 14 determined the Big Ten championship. Michigan State won 27\u20133 to clinch their first Rose Bowl appearance since the 1965 season. Note that they are the only team in college history to not only beat Big 10 powers Ohio State and Michigan in the same season, but also the USC Trojans twice. ===USC Trojans=== USC struggled early and was only 4\u20133 after seven games, but won its next three to set up a showdown with rival UCLA (9\u20131) for the Pac-10 title and Rose Bowl berth. The UCLA Bruins, with Troy Aikman at quarterback and Gaston Green at running back were favored, and led 13\u20130 at halftime. It could have been worse, as on the last play of the first half, UCLA's Eric Turner intercepted a deflected pass at the UCLA goal line and had nothing but green grass ahead of him as he appeared primed to return it for a touchdown. But USC QB Rodney Peete ran down Turner and tackled him at the 10-yard line as time expired. USC had cut the lead to 13\u201310, and then midway through the 4th quarter, quarterback Rodney Peete threw to WR Erik Afholter in the back of the end zone. Afholter juggled the ball atop his shoulder pad as he slid out the end zone; television replays indicated no possession but the referees ruled it a touchdown. Leading 17\u201313, USC then intercepted Aikman as he tried to lead UCLA back and ran out the clock. ==Game summary== Rose Bowl records at the Hall of Champions The game was a rematch of the season opener in East Lansing that Michigan State won 27\u201313. The game was dominated by defense; the story was Michigan State linebacker and game most valuable player Percy Snow, who had 17 unassisted tackles, and four USC turnovers. The Spartans also had their 1988 All-American running back Lorenzo White proved to be a cut-back slashing workhorse with 35 carries for 113 yards by the start of 4th quarter . After USC tied the game early in the fourth quarter at 17, Michigan State marched to a game-winning field goal by John Langeloh with four minutes to play. The key play of the drive was a third down play in which Michigan State quarterback Bobby McAllister was nearly sacked, then scrambled and at the last instant found receiver Andre Rison at the sideline for a first down that kept the drive alive. USC had time to try to come back, and Trojan quarterback Rodney Peete led USC on a drive to the Spartan 29-yard line with two minutes to play. But Peete fumbled the next snap, Michigan State recovered, and the Spartans ran out the clock. Lorenzo White's performance in this game combined with his superb 4 year Career helped notch his recent January 2019 election to the College Football Hall of Fame . ==References== Rose Bowl Category:Rose Bowl Game Category:Michigan State Spartans football bowl games Category:USC Trojans football bowl games Category:January 1988 sports events in the United States Rose ",
