Myers is a U.S. businessman who is the founder, CEO, and chairman of AccuWeather, an American commercial weather service and media company. ==Background== Myers is a native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in meteorology from Pennsylvania State University in 1961, 1963, and 1971, respectively. He founded AccuWeather in State College, Pennsylvania, in 1962. Myers served on the faculty of Penn State from 1964 until 1981 as instructor, lecturer, and assistant professor and he estimates that by the time he retired from teaching he had taught weather forecasting to approximately 17% of all practicing meteorologists in the United States. Additionally, he served on the Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees for 33 years, and continues to serve as an Emeritus Trustee.http://www.psu.edu/trustees/members/myers.html In 2007, Myers appointed his younger brother Barry Lee Myers, a business attorney, as AccuWeather's chief executive officer. The younger Myers was nominated to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in October 2017. Barry Myers stepped down as CEO of AccuWeather on January 1, 2019, and completely divested himself of any ownership of AccuWeather in accordance with his pledge to the Office of Government Ethics and the U.S. Senate. Myers has seven biological children and step-children. ==Political activities== Myers faced criticism in 2005 when he supported the National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005, a bill introduced by U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) that would have prohibited the National Weather Service from publishing weather data to the public when private-sector entities, such as AccuWeather, perform the same function commercially. Myers has been a long-time large donor to the Republican Party, its candidates, and to Santorum, a former home-state Senator. == References == == External links == * Category:American meteorologists Category:Central High School (Philadelphia) alumni Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:People from State College, Pennsylvania Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
