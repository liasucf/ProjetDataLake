This resulted in the municipality being formally proclaimed on 11 November 1870. With a total land area of 40.6 square kilometres, Ryde was the largest Sydney municipality. However, due to an error in the proclamation regarding the western boundary, a new proclamation was made on 11 June 1872. In June 1894 the northern section of the municipality known as Marsfield, was proclaimed as the \"Municipal District of Marsfield\". In 1907, Marsfield became known as the Municipality of Eastwood, and lasted until it was re-amalgamated with Ryde following the passing of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948. With the passing of the Local Government Act, 1906, the council name was changed to be the \"Municipality of Ryde\". The City of Ryde was proclaimed in 1992, marking the bicentenary of the first land grants in Ryde, and with the passing of the Local Government Act 1993, aldermen were also retitled councillors. A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Ryde merge with adjoining councils. The government proposed a merger of the Hunter's Hill, Lane Cove and Ryde Councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 164,000. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Hunter's Hill, Lane Cove and Ryde local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. ===Town Clerks and General Managers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !Term !Notes |- | George Miller Pope | 1870 \u2013 18 February 1887 | |- | William Short | 1 March 1887 \u2013 6 January 1902 | |- | Nelson Kirby | 20 March 1903 \u2013 July 1904 | |- | Joseph Parry | 18 July 1904 \u2013 June 1919 | |- | Donald Neil Morrison | August 1919 \u2013 11 November 1936 | Town Clerk of St Peters, 1913\u20131919. |- | F.
