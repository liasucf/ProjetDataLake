He has been a long-time employee of the German Military History Research Office (MGFA).\"Sieg um jeden Preis\", Der Spiegel Vogel was a contributor to two volumes of the seminal work Germany and the Second World War from the MGFA. ==Historian of Nazi Germany== Vogel's research into treason in Nazi Germany, in partnership with Wolfram Wette, was the first such project undertaken in Germany. Their resulting book The Last Taboo (2007) showed that, based on the documents examined so far, the soldiers acted mostly out of ethical motives and none of their actions caused harm to civilians or military personnel. It played a role in bringing about the legislative change in 2009 Germany, when the Bundestag passed legislation officially rehabilitating military personnel judged \"traitors\" by the military justice system during World War II. ==Selected works== ===In English=== *Germany and the Second World War **Vol. III: The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939\u20131942, with Gerhard Schreiber and Bernd Stegemann **Vol. VII: The Strategic Air War in Europe and the War in the West and East Asia 1943\u20131944/5, with Horst Boog and ==References== *Alexander Weinlein (2009): Versp\u00e4tete Gerechtigkeit: NS-Unrecht Rechtsausschuss billigt einstimmig die Aufhebung der Urteile wegen \u00bbKriegsverrat\u00ab [Belated Justice], via the Bundestag web site * ==External links== *Online learning site for The Last Taboo, via the ' web site (In German) Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:German military historians Category:Historians of World War II Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:Military History Research Office (Germany) personnel Category:20th-century German historians ",
