    "text": "Manuel \"Manolo\" Alfaro de la Torre (born 19 January 1971) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker, and a manager. His 14-year professional career was mainly associated with H\u00e9rcules, for which he scored 55 official goals whilst competing in all three major levels of Spanish football. ==Playing career== Born in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Community of Madrid, Alfaro made his professional debuts with the club at which he finished his football formation, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. He played rarely for the Colchoneros' first team, with 18 of his 24 appearances coming in the 1992\u201393 season, and was also loaned to Real Valladolid during his stint in the Spanish capital. Alfaro signed for H\u00e9rcules CF in 1994, scoring 20 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n goals in his first two seasons combined, including 12 in the 1995\u201396 campaign en route to a La Liga return after a ten-year absence for the Alicante side. In the following year he netted a career-best 15 goals, but they were immediately relegated back. In 1998\u201399, Alfaro produced another solid season in the top flight, now with Villarreal CF (35 games and 12 goals), but suffered another relegation. After years battling with chronic tendinitis he decided to retire from football in December 2002, aged only 31; his last club was H\u00e9rcules, now in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. ==Coaching career== After his retirement, Alfaro coached mainly in amateur football. In the 2004\u201305 season he worked alongside former H\u00e9rcules teammate Josip Vi\u0161nji\u0107 at hometown's RSD Alcal\u00e1, acting as director of football, youth coordinator and first-team assistant manager for the third division team; in the following year, he returned to his main club H\u00e9rcules as a scout. After two seasons in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n with as many sides, Alfaro again worked with H\u00e9rcules, as director of football. In 2009\u201310 he returned to coaching duties in the tier where he left off, with Talavera CF, but the club folded soon after. In November 2010 he was appointed at another fourth level team, CD Toledo. ==Honours== ===Player=== Atl\u00e9tico Madrid *Copa del Rey: 1991\u201392 H\u00e9rcules *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1995\u201396 ===Manager=== Toledo *Tercera Divisi\u00f3n: 2010\u201311 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Category:Spanish footballers Category:Madrilenian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:RSD Alcal\u00e1 players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:Real Valladolid players Category:H\u00e9rcules CF players Category:Villarreal CF players Category:Real Murcia players Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:CD Toledo managers Category:Spanish expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Bolivia ",
