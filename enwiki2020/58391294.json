Chile's food labelling and advertising law, formally titled Ley 20.606, sobre la composici\u00f3n de los alimentos y su publicidad (\u201cLaw 20.606, on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising\u201d) establishes a regulatory framework on food security and healthy food with the intention of guiding consumers towards behaviour patterns that promote public health. After the 2012 law was enacted, its accompanying regulations came into full force on June 27, 2016. Andrew Jacobs, writing for The New York Times, has characterized this measure as \"the world\u2019s most ambitious attempt to remake a country\u2019s food culture\" and suggests it \"could be a model for how to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic that researchers say contributes to four million premature deaths a year.\"Andrew Jacobs, \u201cIn Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger\u201d, 7 Feb. 2018, The New York Times. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018. In Chile, the law \u2014 often referred to by less cumbersome names such as ley de etiquetado de alimentos (\u201cfood labelling law\u201d), ley del S\u00faper Ocho (\u201cSuper Eight law\u201d), or simply ley de alimentos (\u201cfood law\u201d) \u2014 specifically regulates the delivery of nutritional information on foods high in sodium, saturated fats, sugars or calories. The standard also prohibits the sale of such foods in educational institutions, and limits the advertising of these products to children under fourteen. ==History== ===Background=== According to a 2010 national health survey, more than 60 percent of Chile\u2019s population suffers from excessive weight. The problem begins early in childhood, with more than 10 percent of children under six, more than 15 percent of preschoolers and more than 25 percent of first-grade children presenting with obesity. When the overweight and the obese children are considered as a group, more than 50 percent of them, according to the Chilean Ministry of Health, are found to suffer from malnutrition, which is considered the main public health problem in the country.Informe de evaluaci\u00f3n de la implementaci\u00f3n de la ley sobre composici\u00f3n nutricional de los alimentos y su publicidad (\u201cEvaluation report on the implementation of the law on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising\u201d), June 2017, Subsecretar\u00eda de Salud P\u00fablica, Departamento de Nutrici\u00f3n y Alimentos (Public Health subsecretariat, Department of Nutrition and Food, Ministry of Health, Government of Chile), 97 pp. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018. ==Legislation and regulations== ===Law 20.606=== The law has eleven articles; its stipulations establish: * The responsibility of manufacturers, importers or producers of food for human consumption to have specific labels on the nature of the product, with full and truthful information, and their responsibility to ensure that good practices guaranteeing food safety are followed in their production chain. * A duty of manufacturers, producers, distributors and importers of food to inform, on their containers or on their labels, as to the ingredients contained, including all additives and their nutritional information, to follow food health regulations in which the characteristics and content of said food will determine the labelling, and especially to ensure that the information is sufficiently visible and comprehensible. * A prohibition against adulterating ingredients and prepared foods with anything that in some way may create an erroneous impression regarding their true nature, composition or quality, or that may cause damage to health, as determined by the Ministry of Health. * A duty of preschool, elementary and secondary schools to include educational materials and exercise in order to promote healthy eating habits and physical activity, and the mandated requirement for the Education and Health ministries to have a nutritional monitoring system for students in preschool, elementary and secondary school. * The requirement for the Ministry of Health to determine foods whose nutritional composition has high amounts of calories, fats, sugars or salt (or other ingredients, as determined by regulation), setting permitted maximums and ensuring compliance through the public health system. * A prohibition against commercial sale or distribution in preschool, elementary and secondary schools of food products labelled as high in the regulated nutrients or calories, as well as the free delivery or advertising of such products to children under 14, including commercial tie-ins designed to appeal to children, such as toys, accessories, adhesives or similar products. * A prohibition against labelling baby formulas and breast-milk substitutes in any way that may discourage breastfeeding. * An obligation that any food product marketed in Chile that contains among its ingredients \u2014 or that has used, in the course of its preparation \u2014 soy, milk, peanuts, eggs, seafood, fish, gluten or nuts must indicate this on its package or label. ===Regulatory regime=== Health ministry decree No. 13 (April 16, 2015), amended the government's processed foods regulation to adapt it to the provisions of Law 20.606 and specifying maximum calories, sodium, sugars and saturated fats in food; the values were set to diminish by progressive stages after the regulation's entry into force.Modifica Decreto Supremo N\u00b0 977 de 1996, Reglamento Sanitario de los Alimentos (\u201cAmendment to Supreme Decree No. 977 of 1996, Food Health Regulation.\u201d), Diario Oficial de la Rep\u00fablica de Chile (\u201cOfficial Gazette of the Republic of Chile\u201d). Accessed 4 Sept. 2018. The limits stipulated by law are: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |+ ! !! Energy !! Sodium !! Sugars !!

In addition, international organizations \u2014 including the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Pan American Health Organization,OPS/OMS celebra Ley de Alimentos en Chile como ejemplo para el resto de los pa\u00edses de Las Am\u00e9ricas (\u201cPAHO/WHO celebrates Chile's food law as an example for the rest of the countries of the Americas\u201d), 22 Dec. 2016, Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de Salud. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018. the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization, the Union of South American Nations and the OECD \u2014 have expressed support for the Chilean food labelling and advertising law and regulations and have facilitated bilateral cooperation, memoranda of understanding and the establishment of international networks. Codex Alimentarius has urged member countries to revise regulations on labelling, while the World Trade Organization has established international discussion panels on food labelling, at which Chile has been a prominent speaker. In addition, during North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations, the governments of Mexico and Canada have advocated for nutritional warnings on foods, inspired by the Chilean experience, but the current United States government has supported efforts of the commercial food and beverage industry to prevent the adoption of laws similar to Chile's by demanding NAFTA clauses forbidding the enactment of such consumer safety laws in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\u201d Lora Verheecke, a researcher at the Corporate Europe Observatory, a non-profit group tracking corporate lobbying, has declared that once such pro-industry and anti-consumer rules are enshrined into international trade agreements, it becomes extremely difficult to overturn them in the laws of trade-pact member states: \u201cIt kind of kills a law before it can be written, and once you put it into one trade agreement, it can become the precedent for all future deals with future countries.\u201dAzam Ahmed, Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs, \u201cIn NAFTA Talks, U.S. Tries to Limit Junk Food Warning Labels\u201d, 7 Feb. 2018, The New York Times.
