Alaeddin Mosque is situated in Alaeddin Park at Odunpazar\u0131, Eski\u015fehir. According to an inscription at the base of its minaret, it was built in 1267, during the reign of Seljuq Sultan of R\u00fbm G\u0131yaseddin Keyh\u00fcsrev III (reigned 1265\u20131284). It was donated by Cacao\u011flu Cibril or Cacao\u011flu Nureddin, a follower of Mevlana. It is so one of the oldest buildings in Eski\u015fehir. The almost-quadratic rectangular- plan mosque is constructed in rubble masonry. An octagonal -diameter dome sits in the middle of the flat wooden roof. Entrance to the mosque is at the northern side. A wooden staircase leads to the women's section in the upper floor. The dome's interior is adorned with Quran verses at its border. The mihrab is placed in a niche in the south of the mosque, and features late Ottoman architectural style. The mosque is brightened by big rectangular windows. Two-level window layout is applied at the north and lateral facades, at the women's section and the narthex. The building completely lost its original construction properties after several restorations. A major alteration took place in 1945. The mosque was closed to worship by a cabinet decree, and was used as an archaeological museum until the establishment of the Eski\u015fehir Eti Archaeology Museum. The mosque was restored lately in 2014. ==References== Category:Seljuk mosques in Turkey Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1267 Category:Odunpazar\u0131 Category:Buildings and structures in Eski\u015fehir Province ",
