The expression is a hallmark of Ignatian spirituality that is commonly used by the Catholic Church religious order, the Society of Jesus.St. John's Jesuit High School and Academy - Mission Statement Originally used to describe the responsibility of the Jesuit Superior to care for each man in the community with his unique gifts, challenges, needs and possibilities, this value now is applied more broadly to include the relationship between educators and students and professional relationships among all those who work in the academic (usually university) environment, generally of Roman Catholic educational institutions. The phrase is also a motto of a number of Jesuit colleges and universities. ==References== Category:Latin mottos Category:Latin religious words and phrases ",
