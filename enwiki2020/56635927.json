    "text": "The Winchcombe Chronicle is a chronicle of the town of Winchcombe from about 1140-1145. The original text was drafted in the 1140s, and later extended to 1181.Hayward, Paul Antony., The Winchcombe and Coventry Chronicles: Hitherto Unnoticed Witnesses to the Work of John of Worcester,The Medieval Review 12.02.12. The chronicle is also sometimes known as the Annals of Winchcombe, though it differs from the earlier Winchcombe Annals, produced by the same Abbey. The Latin chronicle is anonymous, but was written in the Benedictine, Winchcombe Abbey (Gloucestershire). The manuscript is in two parts. The first, the work of a single scribe, is a world history from creation to 1122 which takes much of its material from John of Worcester's Chronica chronicarum. The addendum contains more recent material. The manuscript also has numerous margin notes of more recent events.Antonia Gransden, Legends, Tradition and History in Medieval England(Bloomsbury Publishing, 2010) p233. The manuscript is currently held at the Bodleian Library, and is found at BL, Cotton Tiberius E iv, folios 1r-27v. ==References== Category:History books about England Category:Works by English writers Category:English non-fiction literature Category:Cotton Library Category:English chronicles Category:11th century in England Category:12th century in England Category:11th-century Latin books Category:12th-century Latin books Category:Winchcombe ",
