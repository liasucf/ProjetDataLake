On 18 May 2007, despite being disqualified from driving, Carney drove a Ute belonging to teammate, Steve Irwin. Police began to pursue the vehicle after noticing the wheels of the Ute momentarily lost traction as it went around a corner. Despite the police car having its sirens sounding and lights flashing, Carney refused to stop his speeding vehicle.
