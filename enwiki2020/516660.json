    "text": "Ivo Robi\u0107 (28 January 1923 \u2013 9 March 2000) was a prominent Croatian singer- songwriter. ==Domestic career== Robi\u0107 began his career as a soloist with the Radio Zagreb Orchestra, while studying at the same time in Zagreb. He performed during World War II on \"Krugovalna postaja Zagreb\" in an Esplanade hotel in Zagreb, Independent State of Croatia. During his career in what was then Socialist Republic of Croatia, he made more than one hundred records, mostly singles and schlagers. In his own country, the most memorable of his many schlagers might be \"Vra\u0107am se Zagrebe tebi\" (Coming Back to You, My Zagreb), \"Ta tvoja ruka mala\" (That Little Hand of Yours), and \"Tiho plove moje \u010de\u017enje\" (Silent Sail of My Yearnings). ==International achievements== A pioneer of popular Croatian music from the early 1950s on, Robi\u0107 was an artist who successfully pursued both domestic and international careers for almost half a century. When he began, he was the only artist from Croatia whose records were available in the record shops of Europe and the rest of the world. Robi\u0107 was nicknamed \"Mister Morgen\" following the success of his first international hit, \"Morgen\" (which means \"tomorrow\"), in 1959. The optimistic song was the first collaboration between Robi\u0107 and Bert Kaempfert. Following its success in Germany, the German-language version became a #13 hit on the pop chart (Billboard Hot 100) in the United States, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. An English set of lyrics, \"One More Sunrise\", bearing no resemblance to the German lyrics, sung by Leslie Uggams, reached #98 on the same charts. It has also been performed by many other artists. Robi\u0107 was active in recording for Germany's Polydor label. He performed and collaborated with Kaempfert, Freddy Quinn, and Dean Martin. Of the Kaempfert composed international hit of 1966 Strangers in the Night he sang the Yugoslav and German versions Stranci u No\u0107i with lyrics by Marija Renota and Fremde in der Nacht with lyrics by Kurt Feltz. Robi\u0107's other international hits are \"Muli-Song\" (1960), \"Mit 17 f\u00e4ngt das Leben erst an\" (1960), \"Ein ganzes Leben lang\" (1962), \"Rot ist der Wein\" (1966), and \"Ich zeig' dir den Sonnenschein\" (1971). ==References== ==External links== * Morgen * Strangers in the night * Morgen, in Croatian and German languages * \"Stranci u no\u0107i\",(Strangers in the night), in original Croatian language * Ivo Robi\u0107 - Biografija * Ivo Robi\u0107's recordings Category:1923 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Gare\u0161nica Category:Croatian pop singers Category:Croatian songwriters Category:Croatian male singers Category:Yugoslav musicians Category:Polydor Records artists Category:Laurie Records artists Category:Burials at Mirogoj Cemetery Category:Musicians from Zagreb Category:20th-century singers Category:20th-century male singers ",
