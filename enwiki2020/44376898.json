    "text": "Daniel Flynn (born 24 September 1994) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Port Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). He previously played Gaelic football for Kildare. Originally from a farm near Johnstownbridge, Flynn trialled with Port Adelaide in the AFL early in 2014 and played in a NAB Challenge pre-season match against the Adelaide Football Club, in a losing effort. This was one of Flynn's first games of Australian rules football, let alone his first game in an AFL sanctioned competition. Flynn was assigned to Port Adelaide's SANFL team before returning to Ireland in March 2014. He then came back to Port Adelaide in May and spent the rest of the season playing in the SANFL, including the Grand Final. Before the start of the 2015 AFL season, Port Adelaide announced that Flynn had returned to Ireland and would not be returning the club, citing homesickness.http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2015-01-30/daniel-flynn-to- stay-in-ireland ==References== ==External links== Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code Category:Irish players of Australian rules football Category:Port Adelaide Football Club (SANFL) players Category:Port Adelaide Football Club players (all competitions) Category:Kildare inter-county Gaelic footballers ",
