    "text": "The Mauser M67 is a bolt-action rifle made by Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk (currently Kongsberg Small Arms) of Norway, based on actions from Mauser M98k left by German armed forces in 1945. The M67 replaced the M59 in 1967 and was produced until the 1990s Before the Sauer 200 STR was approved for Scandinavian target shooting, the M67 and the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen were the most popular target rifles in Norway. Due to the Krag's propensity to change its point of impact under wet conditions, many shooters preferred to use the Krag for shooting on covered ranges and the M67 for field shooting. Most parts of this rifle, like the M59, were made from former Mauser M98 rifles but fitted with a heavy target barrel, a new oversize target stock, Busk target front and rear peep sight with 0.1 mrad adjustments (1 cm at 100 meters), and a rubber recoil pad. From 1975 the rifles had an adjustable trigger (M75), before that they had military M98K triggers. From 1990 the rifles had an adjustable UIT target stock. The gun weighed 6,400 grams and was available in 7.62\u00d751 (.308 Win), 6.5\u00d755 Mauser/Skan and .22 LR for the recruit-class. In the .22LR version, the barrel was switched, the magazine follower and spring was removed and the bolt was changed to be able to fire rimfire ammunition. This model had no magazine and was a single-shot rifle. This rifle does not have a peep rear sight but rather a diopter rear sight. ==See also== *List of firearms Other Norwegian rifles: *Kammerlader - the first breech-loading rifle in service in Norway. *Remington M1867 - the first rifle for metallic cartridges adopted by the Norwegian Army *Krag\u2013Petersson - the first rifle designed by Ole H J Krag that was adopted by an armed force. *Jarmann M1884 - the rifle the Norwegian Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen replaced. *Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen - the most successful Norwegian firearm to date *Kongsberg Skarpskyttergev\u00e6r M59 - The 1959 Norwegian sniper rifle and the predecessor of the M67 *V\u00e5pensmia NM149 - the rifle that replaced the M59F1 as a Norwegian sniper rifle ==References and notes== *Hanevik, Karl Egil (1998).
