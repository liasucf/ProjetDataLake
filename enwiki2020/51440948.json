    "text": "X-Dinero (For Money in English) is a rock-ska band from Peru formed in 1986. ==Biography= La banda started at a night of drinking, it was almost summer, the night began to appear and the Arequipe\u00f1a band Baretto had separated, so they set out to form their own band and record their own songs and they did somehow \"money\" not as a penny left over, they worked with IEMPSA disquera and ended up making separate disks. The band XDinero sounded very well in the north of Peru, its success was so great that it reached the capital Lima (which is very difficult for bands from the provinces), he came to play their music to countries in Europe and Latin America like Bolivia , confused as Argentines for their spectacular singing. The camp escaped death on a bus route to his concert in Ica, which, somehow, they became more united than ever. The band still tours by Peru == Discography == ===Studio albums=== * Triste Dimensi\u00f3n (1997) * Por Las Huevas (2001) * Tocar Fondo y Brillar (2013) == References == == External links == *XDinero's official homepage Category:Peruvian rock music groups Category:Ska groups Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Peru ",
