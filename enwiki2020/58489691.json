On 22 November 1872, Colonel Edward Akroyd, a businessman, promised to construct a park in Halifax. During a committee meeting at the House of Commons Akroyd explained the work he had undertaken so far with the intention of preventing the land being used for the then planned Midland Railway. On 25 June 1879 Colonel Akroyd gave the partly finished park to the public on condition the municipal corporation completed the conversion and used it solely as a park. ===Naming=== The name derives from the term \"bushy scrub\", as the park was originally scrap land covered in dwarf oak scrub. ==Facilities== There is a pond, mature evergreen trees and bushes, informal footpaths, a gothic drinking fountain and woodland paths. The area covered is 9.7 Hectares. Halifax parkrun takes place in the park each Saturday. ==References== Category:Parks and open spaces in West Yorkshire ",
