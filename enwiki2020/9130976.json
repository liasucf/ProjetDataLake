    "text": "The Marching 100 is the official name of the marching band at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) in Tallahassee, Florida. Since its inception, the band has been credited for 30 innovative techniques which have become standard operating procedures for many high school and collegiate marching band programs == History == The first band at FAMU was organized in 1892, under P.A. Van Weller. In 1946, William P. Foster became director of bands, starting with 16 members. Since then, the band has grown to over 440 members. The band has performed at the Super Bowl (on several occasions), the Summer Olympics, the inaugural parades for U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and was selected to be the official United States representative to the Bicentennial Celebration of the French Revolution in Paris, France. == Directors, assistant directors, and staff == === Directors === *P.A.

The majority of those in attendance were from Burke HS (Charleston, South Carolina), and William M. Raines HS (Jacksonville, Florida). Apart from the Marching Band there are three symphonic bands (Honor, Orange, and Green), two jazz bands, a percussion ensemble, keyboard and electronic music, and an ensemble for every instrument. The camp also includes drum majors and flags. The camp students are taught by \"Marching 100\" members, and perform at their symphonic concert, ensemble concert, parade, and the final marching exhibition of Bragg Memorial Stadium. == Hazing == Evidence of hazing in the band made headlines after the death of a Marching 100 drum major in 2011. On November 19, 2011, Robert Champion, the 26-year-old drum major, was beaten to death on the bus after an away game. Investigators found that hazing was involved in the incident. The Orange County Sheriff's Office ruled the death a homicide. An autopsy determined that he had \"badly beaten muscles.\" Florida A&M; canceled all of the band's remaining scheduled performances for the 2011-12 school year and launched an investigation. In May 2012, two faculty members resigned in connection with a hazing investigation and 13 people were charged with felony or misdemeanor hazing crimes. Later that month, FAMU president James Ammons announced that the band would not return until 2013\u201314 at the earliest out of respect for Champion, as well as to give school officials time for a root-and-branch restructuring of the band. Earlier, it had been revealed that at least 101 band members were not enrolled at FAMU.http://www.firstcoastnews.com/rss/article/256533/4/FAMU-Marching-100-to- Remain-on-Suspension Two months later, Ammons resigned. On August 28, 2012, Dante Martin, identified as the \"president\" of the band bus, was accused of felony hazing in Robert Champion's death. He pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with a separate hazing incident. After an unsuccessful mediation session between university attorneys and attorneys representing the family of Robert Champion, FAMU offered to pay $300,000 to the family during the first week of November 2012 as settlement. On March 4, 2013, prosecutors charged 12 former band members with manslaughter for the 2011 hazing death. On June 27, 2013, Florida A&M; lifted the suspension of the band. School officials instituted new academic requirements for the band, as well as a zero-tolerance policy for hazing that applies to all campus organizations. On October 31, 2014, Dante Martin was found guilty of manslaughter and three counts of hazing and on January 9, 2015, he was sentenced to six years in prison. == References == == External links == * Category:Florida A&M; University Category:Musical groups from Florida Category:Musical groups established in 1946 Category:Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference marching bands Category:1946 establishments in Florida ",
