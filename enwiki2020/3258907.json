Huntingford has located Antukyah about south of Lake Hayq, at the edge of the Ethiopian highlands.Cited in Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al- Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), p. 35n. 137. Despite the care Eslamu took in deploying his men, and the number of them, the Ethiopian army panicked and fled when the Imam's cannons cut down thousands of them. The Futuh al-Habasha compared the number of dead and wounded to the previous Battle of Shimbra Kure.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, Futuh, p. 139. == Notes == Category:Conflicts in 1531 Category:1531 in Africa Category:1531 in Ethiopia Category:Ethiopian Highlands Antukyah Antukyah ",
