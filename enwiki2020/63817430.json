    "text": "On October 10, 2017, Trinidad and Tobago played against the United States at the Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva in what was the final 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match for both teams. Trinidad and Tobago won the match 2\u20131 which resulted in the United States missing their first World Cup since 1986, as well as Trinidad and Tobago's first win over the United States since 2008, and their third win against them in international football. ==Background== Following consecutive losses to Mexico and Costa Rica in the opening games of the final round of qualification in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was fired from the United States men's national team job and replaced by former USMNT manager Bruce Arena. On his 3rd game back in charge, Arena coached the US to a 6\u20130 victory over Honduras, and 4 days later got a 1\u20131 draw against Panama at Panama City. Three months after that, they beat Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20130 in Commerce City, Colorado, both goals coming from Christian Pulisic, giving the United States a total of 7 points in the qualification group standings. After earning only 2 points from their next three games, the United States hosted Panama and got a 4\u20130 victory before traveling to Trinidad and Tobago for the game. With a win, the United States would guarantee automatic qualification to the World Cup. A draw would also qualify unless Panama defeated Costa Rica by an 8-goal difference and Honduras beat Mexico by 13 goals. Trinidad and Tobago were already eliminated, and had almost nothing to play for besides revenge for Paul Caligiuri's infamous goal in 1989, which allowed the US to qualify in Trinidad's place. This as well with a Mexican or Costa Rican victory over Honduras or Panama respectively would as well send the United States team to Russia. Before the match, the CONCACAF Fifth Round table was as follows: == Pre-match == The match was played at the smaller Ato Boldon Stadium instead of Hasely Crawford Stadium due to the stadium's issues with its floodlights. Heavy rain in the days preceding the match meant that the field at Ato Boldon Stadium was soaked, impeding practice the day before the match on October 9.Rain-soaked field the latest obstacle for U.S. in reaching World Cup As Trinidad and Tobago were already eliminated from advancement to the World Cup, they included a number of young and untested players in their starting lineup rather than their usual starters, a not uncommon practice. == Match == === Summary === A botched back pass in the 17th minute resulted in a catastrophic own goal by the US team. While Trinidad and Tobago had few high quality shot attempts in the first half, a \"blistering 35-yard strike\" from Alvin Jones managed to get in regardless to give them a 2-0 lead going into the second half. The US team managed to score a goal in the second half by Christian Pulisic and substituted in some fresh strikers to up their goal-scoring chances, but were unable to tie the score by the end of the game. === Details === {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||22||Adrian Foncette|| || |- |DF ||17||Alvin Jones|| || |- |DF ||5||Daneil Cyrus|| || |- |DF ||13||Curtis Gonzales|| || |- |DF ||18 ||Tristan Hodge|||| |- |MF ||7 ||Nathan Lewis|| || |- |MF ||23 ||Leston Paul|| || |- |MF ||19||Kevan George|| || |- |MF ||8 ||Khaleem Hyland (c) || || |- |MF ||16||Levi Garcia|| || |- |FW ||9||Shahdon Winchester|| || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||1||Glenroy Samuel|| || |- |GK ||21||Greg Ranjitsingh|| || |- |DF ||2||Kareem Moses|| || |- |DF ||4||Kevon Villaroel|| || |- |DF ||6||Josiah Trimmingham|| || |- |MF ||3||Joevin Jones|| | |- |MF ||15||Jared London|| || |- |MF |10 |Duane Muckette | | |- |FW |20 |Trevin Caesar | | |- |FW |11 |Neil Benjamin | | |- |FW |12 |Kathon St. Hillaire | | |- |FW |14 |Akeem Roach | | |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Dennis Lawrence |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 ||Tim Howard|| || |- |DF ||2 ||DeAndre Yedlin|| || |- |DF ||3 ||Omar Gonzalez|| | |- |DF ||5 ||Matt Besler|| | |- |DF ||15 ||Jorge Villafa\u00f1a|| || |- |MF ||4 ||Michael Bradley (c) || || |- |MF ||21||Paul Arriola|| || |- |MF ||6 ||Darlington Nagbe|| || |- |MF ||10||Christian Pulisic|| || |- |FW ||17||Jozy Altidore|| || |- |FW ||9 ||Bobby Wood|| || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||22||Nick Rimando|| || |- |GK ||12||Brad Guzan|| || |- |DF ||7||DaMarcus Beasley|| || |- |DF ||19||Graham Zusi|| || |- |DF ||14||Tim Ream|| || |- |DF ||23||Kellyn Acosta|| || |- |MF ||8||Clint Dempsey|| || |- |MF |16 |Benny Feilhaber | | |- |MF |13 |Dax McCarty | | |- |MF |11 |Alejandro Bedoya | | |- |FW |18 |Chris Wondolowski | | |- |FW |20 |Geoff Cameron | | |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Bruce Arena |} |} {| width=82% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minute game time. *Maximum of three substitutions. |} == Post-match == === Results === To the surprise of many, both Central American underdogs, Panama and Honduras, won against Costa Rica and Mexico respectively. Panamanian forward Blas P\u00e9rez scored a controversial \"ghost goal\" in the 53rd minute to equalize the score 1\u20131, before Rom\u00e1n Torres scored the winning goal in the 88th minute. Honduras also pulled a comeback in their win against Mexico. The Mexican team had a 2\u20131 lead at half-time before Eddie Hern\u00e1ndez's shot bounced off of the crossbar and hit the back of Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa's head and went into the net, putting the score at 2\u20132. Seven minutes later, Romell Quioto scored the winning goal for Honduras, ending Mexico's chance to go unbeaten throughout the qualifying rounds. Because of the United States' loss and their win, Panama would automatically qualify for the group stage of the 2018 competition, while Honduras was given a final chance to qualify for the tournament in Russia during the CONCACAF\u2013AFC play-off matches against Australia. == Reactions == ===Media=== The result and failure for the U.S. to qualify made national and international news overnight. ESPN FC hosted a segment on the game and openly criticized the \"arrogance\" that the United States team had. Alejandro Moreno criticized the players commitment and passion for the game. Shaka Hislop, a former goalkeeper who represented Trinidad and Tobago in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, blamed the U.S. media for asking Arena about the performance of European players and other unrelated questions of the match the day before. Hislop also criticized the United States team for their criticism of the field conditions. Taylor Twellman went on an unscripted rant on ESPN in which he highlighted the lack of focus on the match at hand, claiming other players and broadcasters asked for the other scoreline from the other matches in qualifying. Twellman stated the United States needs to revise everything about the United States Soccer Federation, including Major League Soccer, the \"pay to play\" system of U.S. youth soccer, and other aspects of the federation. He cited efforts by the German Football Association as an example of a nation that had successfully changed its culture after the national team's failure in Euro 2000. Twellman further added similar dissatisfaction with the pitch criticism, citing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Belgium playing against each other on what he termed a \"cow pasture\". Twellman also complained that Iceland would qualify for the World Cup while the United States did not.Iceland\u2019s in the World Cup. The U.S. is not. Unacceptable. An analysis by the sports side of the blog FiveThirtyEight called the match \"the worst loss in USMNT's history based on the Elo rating system\" since the USMNT was so heavily favored, which made the loss all the more stinging due to the high stakes involved.The Worst Loss In The History Of U.S. Men's Soccer A retrospective by the sports blog SB Nation agreed, calling the match the worst in the US mens team's history.The worst USMNT match crushed a near-certain World Cup run in 1 day | 2017 USA vs. Trinidad & Tobago === United States National Team=== Bruce Arena resigned as the manager of the team shortly after the match. Omar Gonzalez in a post-match press conference stated his own goal \"is one that will haunt me forever.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/sports/soccer/usmnt-trinidad-world-cup.html ==See also== *History of the United States men's national soccer team * Shot heard round the world (soccer) *United States v England (1950 FIFA World Cup) *Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup) == References == Category:2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF) Category:FIFA World Cup qualification matches Category:Trinidad and Tobago national football team matches Category:United States men's national soccer team matches Category:2017 in American soccer Category:2017\u201318 in Trinidad and Tobago football Category:October 2017 sports events in North America ",
