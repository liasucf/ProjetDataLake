The GAAP gross revenue was $19 million in 2019 and $30.8 million in 2018. Fox Networks Group was 50% of the company's 2019 sales, up from 42% the previous year. The company had 93 employees at the end of 2019, after reducing its workforce by 44. In March 2020, the company furloughed 37 people in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On April 10, 2020, Phunware received $2.8 million in federally backed small business loans from JP Morgan Chase as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The company received scrutiny over this loan for its connections to Trump and Fox News. In defense, Crowder (COO) said companies that didn't apply \"aren't doing their fiduciary duty\" and was interviewed on the matter by Proactive Investors and Spectrum News. == Investor Relations == Phunware's Board of Directors can be found here.
