He played college basketball for Molloy College in the NCAA Division II. ==Early life and college career== Morris had previously gone to high school at St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute in Buffalo, New York. During his senior year there, he was an honorable mention for the All-Western New York team, as well as be named Mr. Defense for having the best defensive abilities of the state that year. However, since he did not have any major school offer him any scholarships, he decided to go to Molloy College, where his father Patrick is an assistant coach for the basketball team. During his first two years at Molloy College, Morris provided decent numbers for the Lions, with his sophomore season having him be an East Coast Conference All-Conference Honorable Mention. Starting in his junior and senior seasons, Morris would grow into more of a star player for the college, with him being named a member for both the All-ECC Third-team and All-Met Second-team in his junior year, as well as a member of the All-ECC First-team in his senior year of college. During his senior year, he became the second-highest scorer for the team, averaging 19.9 points per game during his senior season. ==Professional career== ===Erie BayHawks (2017\u20132018)=== After getting undrafted in the 2017 NBA Draft, Morris would pay $150 to work out with the Long Island Nets. His workout there would lead to him getting drafted by the Erie BayHawks in the 2017 NBA G League Draft in the second round as the 41st overall pick that year. ===Atlanta Hawks (2018)=== On February 28, 2018, after multiple successful games from Morris with the BayHawks, he signed a 10-day contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Morris made his NBA debut that same day in a 107\u2013102 win over the Indiana Pacers. In his debut, Morris recorded 2 points and 2 rebounds in 11 minutes of action. After his first 10-day contract expired, he signed a second 10-day contract with the Hawks on March 11, 2018. During that night's game, he would end up injuring his ankle, thus sidelining him for up to two weeks. Despite the injury, Morris would ultimately sign with the Hawks for the rest of the season on March 21. He was waived on July 19, 2018. ===Milwaukee Bucks (2018\u20132019)=== On July 22, 2018, Morris signed a deal with the Italian club Auxilium Pallacanestro Torino. However, Morris later that week opted out of the contract with Auxilium Pallacanestro Torino in order to sign a two-way contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, which was made official on July 31. On January 13, 2019, the Bucks requested waivers on Morris.https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/milwaukee-bucks-request-waivers-jaylen- morris ===Second stint with Erie BayHawks (2019)=== On January 31, 2019, the Erie BayHawks announced that they had added Morris to their roster. ===Aris (2019\u20132020)=== On September 25, 2019, Aris Thessaloniki announced that Morris had joined their club for the 2019\u20132020 season. ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Atlanta | 6 || 0 || 16.4 || .406 || .200 || - || 2.7 || 1.2 || .3 || .2 || 4.7 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Milwaukee | 4 || 0 || 7.1 || .400 || .333 || .500 || 1.3 || 1.0 || .5 || - || 2.5 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 10 || 0 || 12.7 || .405 || .231 || .500 || 2.1 || 1.1 || .4 || .2 || 4.7 ==References== ==External links== * *Molloy Lions bio *Jaylen Morris NBA G League player profile Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Aris B.C. players Category:Atlanta Hawks players Category:Basketball players from New York (state) Category:Erie BayHawks (2017\u201319) players Category:Milwaukee Bucks players Category:Molloy Lions men's basketball players Category:People from Amherst, New York Category:Shooting guards Category:Sportspeople from Erie County, New York Category:Undrafted National Basketball Association players Category:Wisconsin Herd players ",
