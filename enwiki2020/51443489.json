    "text": "Jack Roberts (born 20 November 1991) is a Welsh rugby union player who plays centre for Jersey Reds. Roberts was born and raised in North Wales before moving at 16 to Llandovery College in West Wales. He was part of Llanelli Scarlets academy and played two seasons for Llandovery RFC in the Welsh Premiership. He was named as the division's player of the month in April 2013 after scoring 4 tries in the month. On 23 May 2013 Rotherham Titans announced Roberts had signed for them for the 2013/14 season in the English Championship. Roberts played 27 times for Rotherham that season. On 29 October 2014 Roberts joined Leicester Tigers with immediate effect. He made his starting debut against Northampton Saints in the LV Cup. Following injuries to centre regulars Manu Tuilagi, Matt Smith and Matt Toomua, Roberts was promoted to the first team and quickly became a regular thanks to his speed, power and work-rate which Welsh fans have compared to that of Jamie Roberts. He is definitely in the running for breakthrough Player of the Year for the Tigers and possibly for the Premiership as a whole. On 14 February 2017, Roberts moves to the Cardiff Blues in the Pro14 from the 2017-18 season which means it will increase his chances of international recognition. However, a series of long-term injuries saw the centre struggling to establish himself at the Welsh capital, resulting in a move to Doncaster Knights ahead of the 2019/20 campaign. On 13 June 2020, Roberts left Doncaster to join Championship rivals Jersey Reds ahead of the 2020-21 season. ==References== Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Leicester Tigers players Category:Rugby union centres Category:Sportspeople from Bangor, Gwynedd ",
