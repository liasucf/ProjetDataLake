The Gates MRI was organized as a subsidiary of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation who funded it with a $273 million 4-year grant.Branswell, H (2018).

While this type of work is a mainstay of biomedical research it has been skewed toward diseases of the rich, which comprise more attractive markets. In addition, pharmaceutical companies have a high failure rate for drug development.(June, 2017). Counting the cost of failure in drug development. Pharmaceutical Technology. Established in January 2018, Gates MRI\u2019s initial focus was on malaria, tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases. Combined, these three diseases alone cause five deaths every minute.WHO Diarrheal disease fact sheet, updated May 2017; , WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2017; WHO Malaria Policy and Advisory Committee Meeting Report 2018.[WHO Malaria Policy and Advisory Committee Meeting Report 2018] In 2019, Gates MRI expanded the scope of its mission to include maternal, newborn, and child health (MN2CH).

No commercial firm has yet been interested in testing this approach to extending tuberculosis immunization. ==Partnering== Gates MRI partners with academic researchers, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, global health organizations, and others. Its own work is focused on early and middle-stage development, but the Institute collaborates around a range of areas - from basic science through public health outcomes studies. In particular, Gates MRI seeks scientific discoveries and partners that can take compounds that have graduated from Phase II clinical trials through the final stages of development and approval. ==External links== * Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute * Global Access == References == Category:Medical and health organizations based in the United States ",
