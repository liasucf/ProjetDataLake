    "text": "W24DL-D, channel 24, is a low-power television station in Midland County, Michigan. It is an affiliate of the 3ABN. Its city grade signal is viewable in parts of rural Isabella, Midland and Gratiot counties. In March 2005, W46CR applied for a move to channel 42 when full power CW affiliate WBSF received their construction permit for a station licensed to Bay City, also on channel 46. However, when WBSF signed on on September 13, 2006, W46CR continued their channel 46 broadcast, causing co-channel interference with WBSF outside its general coverage area, as far east as Auburn, in Bay County. 3ABN's request to move to channel 42 was granted sometime in mid-2007, which, at that point, the station moved to its new channel and was given new calls, W42DI. However, the move seems to have gone unnoted or was deleted from the FCC's database, as the entry for W46CR remains, or Three Angels has constructed the facilities and not let the FCC know it has done so. According to the FCC database, W46CR has a construction permit for low-power digital channel 24; however, according to the federal DTV transition plan, W46CR will be required to convert to digital or close down by September 1, 2015. W46CR's digital signal was activated on September 13, 2012. On October 1, 2012, the station changed its call sign to W24DL-D. ==Digital subchannels== The station's television broadcasts are multiplexed with several video feeds from Three Angels Broadcasting Network: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |+ W24DL-D |- !
