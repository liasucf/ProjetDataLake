Both companies collaborated on the development of the Azerpsace-2 satellite.

It separated from the upper rocket stage at 721 pm EDT and operated in test mode for the first two months. Then the satellite was transferred to a working orbit. Azerspace-2 has been designed in order to help Azercosmos to expand its service area. It renders uninterrupted service across Europe, Central and South Asia, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. == Features == Azerspace-2 will provide digital broadcasting, data transmission and other services.
