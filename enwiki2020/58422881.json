    "text": "In mathematics, in the areas of topology and functional analysis, the Anderson\u2013Kadec theorem states that any two infinite-dimensional, separable Banach spaces, or, more generally, Fr\u00e9chet spaces, are homeomorphic as topological spaces. The theorem was proved by Mikhail Kadets (1966) and Richard Davis Anderson. == Statement == Every infinite-dimensional, separable Fr\u00e9chet space is homeomorphic to \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}, the Cartesian product of countably many copies of the real line \\mathbb{R}. == Preliminaries == Kadec norm: A norm \\|\\cdot\\| on a normed linear space X is called a Kadec norm with respect to a total subset A\\subset X^* of the dual space X^* if for each sequence x_n\\in X the following condition is satisfied: * If \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x^*(x_n)=x^*(x_0) for x^*\\in A and \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\|x_n\\|=\\|x_0\\|, then \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\|x_n-x_0\\|=0. Eidelheit theorem: A Fr\u00e9chet space E is either isomorphic to a Banach space, or has a quotient space isomorphic to \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}. Kadec renorming theorem: Every separable Banach space X admits a Kadec norm with respect to a countable total subset A \\subset X^* of X^*. The new norm is equivalent to the original norm \\|\\cdot\\| of X. The set A can be taken to be any weak-star dense countable subset of the unit ball of X^* == Sketch of the proof == In the argument below E denotes an infinite-dimensional separable Fr\u00e9chet space and \\simeq the relation of topological equivalence (existence of homeomorphism). A starting point of the proof of the Anderson\u2013Kadec theorem is Kadec's proof that any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space is homeomorphic to \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}. From Eidelheit theorem, it is enough to consider Fr\u00e9chet space that are not isomorphic to a Banach space. In that case there they have a quotient that is isomorphic to \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}. A result of Bartle-Graves-Michael proves that then :E\\simeq Y\\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}} for some Fr\u00e9chet space Y. On the other hand, E is a closed subspace of a countable infinite product of separable Banach spaces X=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}X_i of separable Banach spaces. The same result of Bartle-Graves-Michael applied to X gives a homeomorphism :X\\simeq E\\times Z for some Fr\u00e9chet space Z. From Kadec's result the countable product of infinite-dimensional separable Banach spaces X is homeomorphic to \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}. The proof of Anderson\u2013Kadec theorem consists of the sequence of equivalences :\\begin{align}\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}&\\simeq (E\\times Z)^{\\mathbb{N}}\\\\\\ &\\simeq E^\\mathbb{N}\\times Z^{\\mathbb{N}}\\\\\\ &\\simeq E\\times E^{\\mathbb{N}}\\times Z^{\\mathbb{N}}\\\\\\ &\\simeq E\\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}\\\\\\ &\\simeq Y\\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}\\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}\\\\\\ &\\simeq Y\\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}} \\\\\\ &\\simeq E\\end{align} == Notes == == References == * . * .
