    "text": "WCIA, virtual channel 3 (UHF digital channel 34), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Champaign, Illinois, United States and serving the Central Illinois region. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Springfield-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WCIX (channel 49). The two stations share studios on South Neil Street/US 45 in downtown Champaign and also operate a sales office and news bureau on East Edwards Street near the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. WCIA's transmitter is located west of Seymour along the Champaign\u2013Piatt county line. Since WCIA's over-the-air signal cannot be seen in western parts of the market (including Springfield and Jacksonville), it is simulcast in high definition on WCIX's second digital subchannel (VHF channel 11.2 or virtual channel 49.2 via PSIP) from a transmitter on Etherton Lane in Clear Lake Township. Nielsen Media Research treats WCIA and WCIX-DT2 as one station in local ratings books, using the identifier name WCIA+. ==History== The station's first broadcast was on November 14, 1953, and it was owned and operated by Midwest Television, headquartered in Champaign. August C. Meyer Sr., a lawyer and chairman of the board of the Champaign-based Bank of Illinois, founded Midwest Television in 1952. Meyer expanded the company's footprint by buying WMBD-AM-FM-TV in Peoria, Illinois, in 1960 and KFMB-AM-FM-TV in San Diego, California, in 1964. Midwest sold off controlling interest in its Illinois television holdings to Nexstar in 1999. That company acquired Midwest's remaining interest in the Illinois stations in 2001. WCIA was a primary CBS affiliate, carrying secondary affiliations with NBC and DuMont. DuMont shut down in 1956 and WCIA dropped NBC in 1959 when WCHU-TV (now WICD) started. It also carried a few ABC shows during the 1953-1954 television season. As the only commercial VHF station in Central Illinois, WCIA has been one of the country's most dominant television stations for most of its history. On two occasions, it fought off attempts by WICS/WICD and WAND to force it onto the UHF band by claiming that moving to UHF would cause it to lose 150,000 viewers. Despite its dominance of the market, WCIA provides only a Grade B signal to the Springfield area. Meyer realized early on that Champaign\u2013Urbana and Springfield/Decatur were going to be one giant television market. He originally wanted to build WCIA's tower in White Heath, roughly halfway between Champaign and Decatur. The tower would have been placed on some of the highest ground in Central Illinois. However, just after construction began, Prairie Television (owner of WTVP, now WAND) filed an objection. Prairie claimed WCIA was encroaching on its territory. To avoid delays, WCIA moved its transmitter to the current location in Seymour. Despite this, Decatur (the second-largest city in the western half of the market) receives WCIA's signal very well. While it frequently trounced WICS/WICD and WAND in the ratings, Meyer decided to open a low-powered relay of WCIA on UHF channel 49 to get better coverage in the state capital. In 1985, this became full-powered station WCFN. In 2002, WCFN separated from WCIA and became the area's UPN affiliate, though overall, the loss of both stations of coverage of each network was short-lived; WCIA soon added WCFN as its second digital subchannel when it launched its digital television service, while WCFN's main channel instead carried WCIA's main schedule in full high definition, with WCFN's channel remaining in standard definition until multiplexing technology improved to allow WCIA and WCFN's main channels to both be in HD. This, and area cable and satellite access, assured both station's full market coverage. WCFN was re-called to WCIX in 2011. For decades, WCIA was available on cable systems in Bloomington\u2013Normal, in the Peoria market, along with sister station WMBD-TV. In March 2000, shortly after Nexstar bought controlling interest in both stations, it announced it would drop WCIA from AT&T; Cable Services (now Comcast Xfinity) and cable systems in surrounding areas, a move that would eventually be forced nationwide, due to CBS affiliation agreements requiring only one affiliate being authorized per market on pay television services. It would centralize WMBD's advertising revenue and preserve its ratings standing within the Peoria market without numbers being further stunted by WCIA. A group known as \"Citizens to Keep WCIA on-the-air\" petitioned Nexstar to revert the change, but was unsuccessful. WCIA's Grade B signal still covers the Bloomington\u2013Normal area decently (extending as far west as Morton), meaning that Bloomington\u2013Normal residents can still receive WCIA over-the-air. In November 2006, work began to re-secure WCIA's existing tower in Seymour so it would be able to hold a new digital transmission line and antenna. WCIA was the longtime home to Illinois Fighting Illini football and men's basketball games that were not aired on national television. Originally produced by WCIA, the station later carried the Illini via the Big Ten Conference's syndicated package with ESPN Plus. Beginning in 2007, these games have since moved to the Big Ten Network. The station still airs Illini men's basketball games that are carried as part of CBS's overall NCAA and Big Ten contracts. In 2009, WCIA's longtime weathercaster Judy Fraser retired from the station after 34 years. She was only the second head weathercaster in the station's history at the time. Meteorologist Robert Reese took over as Chief Meteorologist. His death in connection with complications from cancer in October 2012 came as a shock to the community. In his early battle, WCIA sold red ribbons in support of Reese and the American Cancer Society. On September 11, 2014, WCIA anchor Dave Benton announced on-air that he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and that he had only months to live. He explained that the doctors told him that his cancer had returned and that it was too large for surgery or radiation. Benton was diagnosed with a glioblastoma in November 2013 after doctors found a tumor on the left side of his head. He underwent surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy and completed radiation treatment in February 2014. On April 13, 2015, Benton announced on the 6 p.m. newscast that he was stepping down from the anchor chair due to continued health issues and failed treatments, though he hoped to continue his signature crime reports for the 5 p.m. news as long as his health allowed.\"WCIA-TV anchor battling brain cancer to step down,\" from The State Journal-Register, 4/13/2015 Benton died at home on May 26.\"Former WCIA news anchor Dave Benton dies after fighting brain tumor,\" from The State Journal- Register, 5/26/2015 On December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal\u2014which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019\u2014would result in WCIA and WCIX gaining additional sister stations in nearby markets including Chicago (independent station WGN-TV) and St. Louis (Fox affiliate KTVI and CW affiliate KPLR-TV). (Ownership conflicts existed in two existing Nexstar markets involving Nexstar's duopoly of CW affiliate WISH- TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WNDY-TV (which were both sold to Circle City Broadcasting) and Tribune's duopoly of Fox affiliate WXIN and CBS affiliate WTTV/WTTK in Indianapolis and Nexstar's virtual triopoly of CBS affiliate WHBF-TV, CW affiliate KGCW and Fox-affiliated SSA partner KLJB and Tribune- owned ABC affiliate WQAD-TV (which was sold to Tegna) in the Quad Cities.) The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16 and was completed on September 19, 2019. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

In June 2015, WCIX upgraded to a full 1080i 16:9 high definition signal, the same as WCIA. In September 2016, WCIA begin broadcasting Bounce TV on 3.3 and Grit TV on 3.4. ===Analog-to-digital conversion=== WCIA shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre- transition UHF channel 48. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3. On January 17, 2020, WCIA moved to channel 34 as a result of the spectrum repack. ==Programming== ===Local entertainment programs=== *Happy Home (1950s) *Welcome Travelers (1950s) *At the Hop (1950s\u20131960s; hosted by John Coleman and later by Ed Mason) *Sun-Up (1960s; hosted by Tom Jones) *Sheriff Sid (1960s) *Dialing for Dollars (1960s\u20131970s) *Way Out with Cousin Trebor (1963\u20131965) *The Second Cup (1970s) *The Bruce Weber Show (2000s) *PM Magazine (1977\u20131990) *Illinois Journal ==News operation== Capitol bureau. WCIA currently broadcasts its news from its studios in Champaign. It currently broadcasts 40 hours of news a week, and one hour on Saturday and Sunday. For most of its history, it has been central Illinois' dominant news station, owing to its status as the market's only VHF station. On September 12, 2011, WCIA debuted an hour-long lifestyle and news program titled ciLiving.tv, the Springfield market's first hour-long 4 p.m. news program; the show utilizes interactivity with viewers, through the use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, along with online polls and audience quizzes via text message and the station's website.WCIA Adds Local News-Lifestyle At 4 P.M., TVNewsCheck, September 9, 2011. The show also utilizes the station's new set, which is also used for the station's morning show, as well as other programs. On October 24, 2012 during the 5:00 p.m. newscast, WCIA and sister station WCIX began broadcasting local news in high definition. This made the WCIA/WCIX operation the third local news operation and second \"Big Four\" network affiliated station to have made the upgrade. However, the newscasts on WCIX continued to be seen over the air in a letterboxed format until June 19, 2015 because its main channel was still transmitted in 4:3 standard definition until it upgraded to HD on that date. In April 2015, WCIA expanded its 6 p.m. newscast from 30 minutes to one hour to provide better coverage of local news. In late 2015, WCIA expanded its news coverage from the State Capitol. The station now produces and airs Capitol Connection on Sunday mornings after CBS' Face the Nation. The show is also carried on other Nexstar stations in Illinois. In October 2016, WCIA expanded its morning show from four hours to five hours, making the station have the only local news at 9 a.m. in the market. ===U.S. government video news releases=== In an article published on March 13, 2005, The New York Times documented WCIA's use of government video news releases. The Times reported, \"WCIA, based in Champaign, had run 26 segments made by the U.S. Agriculture Department over the past three months alone.\" WCIA acknowledged running the releases in the early hours of its morning news as a service to local farmers. ===Notable former on-air staff=== *Susan Barnett *Elaine Quijano *Colleen Callahan - agribusiness reporter (1974\u20131997) *John Coleman - weather anchor (1953\u20131957); later at WLS-TV, WMAQ- TV, and KUSI; retired in April 2014 *Michael Marsh *Dana Perino (later became the White House Press Secretary) *Martin Savidge *Lori Stokes anchor/reporter (1986\u20131988); now at WNYW *Mike Tannura - meteorologist (2001\u20132004) ==Former logo== Image:wciathumb2.jpg|WCIA logo, circa 1970 to 2000 ==See also== *1953 in television ==References== ==External links== * * *dougquick.com/wciachampaign2.html -- provides a three-part history of WCIA, with many pictures Category:CBS network affiliates Category:Bounce TV affiliates Category:Grit (TV network) affiliates CIA Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953 Category:Nexstar Media Group Category:1953 establishments in Illinois Category:Big Ten Conference broadcasters ",
