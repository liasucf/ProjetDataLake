That was the vision of its founders, who were characterized as professionals in various areas, formed in different universities and different social visions. This rich, so relevant, their first strategic definitions. The University was formally created in October 1988, as a contribution to the development of higher education and having, as one of its fundamental purposes, meeting a profound social role: contributing to the overall effort, which should make the country to offer to all high school graduates equal opportunities in access to higher education and university degrees and titles, which would allow progress to occur. The University offered, in the early years, careers that demanded an infrastructure and basic equipment. In any case, its corporate seal was always quality. The first specializations offered were Law, Architecture, Engineering, Business and Journalism. Civil Engineering was then added in its various expressions, Construction, Certified Public Accountant and Psychology. Nevertheless, it was always among its objectives to address all disciplines and areas of knowledge, including scientific complexity. The first step in this direction was the creation of the Engineering in Aquaculture, which offered tuition since 1993, an initiative with the University Andres Bello became the first private university that implemented a program of greater complexity, assuming the responsibility to comply with the requirements of infrastructure and equipment that demand this type of project. Associated with this teaching program, simultaneously born Marine Research Center located in the Caleta de Quintay, now proud of their level of development, scientific and technical successes have been achieved in many of their research projects, and their valuable work in support of numerous inlets of fishermen. Andres Bello University, through the Marine Research Center, has become the leading provider of seeds of sea urchins in the country, and the creator, among others, the sole technology that grow in captivity, opening an opportunity to negotiate services to the private sector, which could become equivalent to salmon farming. In the seventh year of its founding in 1996, when the University had nearly six thousand students and offered thirteen specializations, the founding partners Luis Cordero, Ignacio Fernandez and Marcelo Ruiz, versus distance from the other founding partners are in charge of the property University and reorganize the project partners incorporated as supporters to Mr. Alvaro Saieh, Miguel Angel Poduje, Selume Jorge Andres Navarro and Juan Antonio Guzman. Thus, these eight holders become part of the Board and convene a group of leading academics and scientists to join the project meet the definition of its mission to address more vigorously the demands imposed by the knowledge society give him a new organizational structure and form a new university governance. This period is especially important the participation of prominent lawyers and public men, M\u00e1ximo Pacheco G\u00f3mez and William Elton Alamos, who alternate in the Vice President of the Board, making a great contribution to the project, and academics, Joaqu\u00edn Barcel\u00f3 and Manuel Krauskopf, who come to defog after ownership of the rectory. == New institutional mission and autonomy == In this period, the University assumes the main recommendations of the Chilean Board of Higher Education.

In Tables academic influence in the areas of science stressed under the experience gained in the Marine Research Center Quintay, creating an area of biological sciences, increasingly incorporating doctors in Jor-nothing regime complete.

It is undoubtedly the construction of the indicated areas which marks the seal structure and academic development of the Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello. The strength of its areas of Basic Sciences announces the solid and rapid growth will thereafter.
