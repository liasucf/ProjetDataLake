    "text": "Ugly Delicious is a non-fiction original series on Netflix combining travel, cooking, and history. Each episode highlights one dish or concept, and explores how it is made in different regions and how it evolves. The first season premiered on February 23, 2018 with host David Chang. On November 22, 2018, it was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2020. The second season contained only half as many episodes as the first, likely due to Chang's increasingly busy schedule and the birth of his first child. == Plot == Each episode examines the cultural, sociological, and culinary history of a specific popular food. Chang challenges and explores the attitudes in each dish's lore. Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times that Ugly Delicious is \"an extended television essay, in the form of free- associative, globe-trotting conversations about food and culture.\" == Episodes == ===Season 1 (2018) === === Season 2 (2020) === == Reception == Critical reviews have mostly been positive.
