    "text": "JES Air was founded in 1991 and was one of the first privately owned airlines in Bulgaria. The airline was supported with capital from Singapore-based companies. Its first route was Sofia\u2013New York City, due to an agreement between the two countries, and it then expanded its destinations towards Canada and Asia. The company was famous for its delays, but despite this, passengers used the airline because of the cheap prices it offered. One of the aircraft - LZ-JXB was wet leased to REGION AIR PTE. LTD., Singapore and took place in the creation of the new face of Vietnam Airlines. \"JES Air\" fell into bankruptcy only one year after it started flights and at the end of 1992 was re-registered in the Middle East and renamed. Following the bankruptcy REGION AIR PTE. LTD. has employed ex-JES Air Bulgarian pilots and engineers to continue with the development of Vietnam Airlines. ==Destinations== ; * Melbourne - Melbourne Airport ; * Sofia - Sofia Airport ; * Ottawa - Macdonald-Cartier Airport ; * Singapore - Changi Airport ; * Dubai - Dubai Airport ; * New York City - John F.
