    "text": "The 2021 City of London Corporation election is scheduled to take place on 18 March 2021 to elect members of the Court of Common Council in the City of London Corporation, England. It has been proposed that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the elections be combined with the 2021 United Kingdom local elections in the rest of England on 6 May. The City's Policy and Resources Committee has recommended against this, and suggested July 2021 as an alternative date should the elections need to be postponed. ==References== 2021 Category:2021 English local elections ",
