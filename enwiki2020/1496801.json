    "text": "Jaime Hernando Garz\u00f3n Forero (October 24, 1960 - August 13, 1999 in Bogot\u00e1) was a Colombian comedian, journalist, politician, and peace activist. He was popular on colombian television during the 1990s for his unique political satire. In addition to his work on television, he also had roles as a peace negotiator in the release of FARC guerrillas' hostages. He was murdered in 1999 by right-wing paramilitary hitmen, with suspected support from members of the Colombian military and security services, according to testimonies of former paramilitaries commanders. The case remains open and unsolved. == Life == Jaime Garz\u00f3n was born in Bogot\u00e1 on October 24, 1960. He studied law and political science at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, but his active involvement in politics and television did not allow him to finish. Garz\u00f3n was an avid fan of Millonarios FC, a football club based in his hometown of Bogota, Colombia. === Mayor of Sumapaz === Garz\u00f3n joined the political campaign of Andr\u00e9s Pastrana Arango for mayor of Bogot\u00e1. After winning the elections, Pastrana nominated him as mayor of Sumapaz, an underdeveloped rural locality in the district, in 1988. Garz\u00f3n tried to improve the standard of living in Sumapaz. In a year, he created a health center, the school was improvedAs a homage, it has its name as Colegio Campestre \"Jaime Garz\u00f3n\". and the only street of town was paved. But his originality was not well seen by the central administration of Pastrana. Asked in a telegram to notify the number of legal brothels in Sumapaz, he answered: \"Despu\u00e9s de una inspecci\u00f3n visual, informo que aqu\u00ed las \u00fanicas putas, son las putas FARC\", a sarcastic answer typical of his sense of black humor, roughly translated as \"After a visual inspection, I report that the only whores around here are the fucking FARC\", a wordplay, as in Colombian Spanish the word 'putas' could mean both 'whores' as noun, and 'fucking' as an intensifier adjective. That answer and other eccentricities, brought to the conclusion by the central administration that he had founded a brothel in Sumapaz. The municipal government secretary, Volmar P\u00e9rez Ortiz, signed his destitution. For this reason, Garz\u00f3n sued Pastrana's administration; the case was ruled in his favor only in 1997. Between 1990 and 1994 he worked at the Nari\u00f1o House during the presidency of C\u00e9sar Gaviria. He helped in the translations of the new Colombian Constitution of 1991 into the indigenous languages and as a presidential adviser in communications. == Career == Jaime Garzon in a fictional characters \"Heriberto de la Calle\", monument installed in Bogot\u00e1. In 1987, the director of the Noticiero de las 7, Antonio Morales Riveira, knew of the fame of the Mayor of Sumapaz in imitating politicians. He brought Garz\u00f3n to the newscast; it was the first time he would appear on television. He worked on various television parodies, becoming famous with the TV show Zoociedad (Zoociety) in the 1990s which contained humor about materialistic society and politics. Garz\u00f3n then started working on a program called \"\u00a1Quac! El Noticero\", collaborating with actor Diego Le\u00f3n Hoyos until 1997. Garz\u00f3n created many instantly recognizable fictional characters. One of them was \"Heriberto de la Calle\". Heriberto was a shoe shiner who interviewed different personalities, including politicians. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 90%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" align=\"center\" !

Among the hostages were four US citizens and an Italian. On March 27 a commission, with the authorization of anti-kidnapping czar Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Escobar and led by Garz\u00f3n, allowed the release of nine of the hostages. On May 6, 1998, General Jorge Enrique Mora Rangel, commander of the Colombian Army, publicly asked Escobar to investigate Garz\u00f3n for his participation in the release of the hostages. On June 4, Escobar, defended the role of Garz\u00f3n in the release of the hostages as a humanitarian mission. Garz\u00f3n tried to have an appointment with General Mora Rangel, but he was not accepted. The journalist sent a telegram to the military where he said: \"General, do not look for enemies among the Colombians that risk their life everyday to build a proud nation as I want and as you are fighting for.\" In May 1999 Garz\u00f3n said in a cocktail party in front of some personalities, among them the US Ambassador, that General Mora was accusing him of being a collaborator of the FARC. On May 25, 1999, Senator Piedad C\u00f3rdoba was kidnapped by the paramilitary group of Carlos Casta\u00f1o, and she was accused by him of being a collaborator of the guerrilla. According to Senator C\u00f3rdoba, Casta\u00f1o also mentioned Garz\u00f3n. Once she was released, she met the journalist and warned him of the danger. The participation in the process of the FARC's hostage releases and the intention to promote a dialogue of peace brought him many threats, but the most noticeable were those from Casta\u00f1o. == Murder == On Tuesday, August 10, 1999, Garz\u00f3n visited the paramilitary leader \u00c1ngel Gait\u00e1n Mahecha, who was in the Modelo Prison in Bogot\u00e1 with the intention to arrange a meeting with Carlos Casta\u00f1o. The meeting was to be held on August 14 in the C\u00f3rdoba Department. On Wednesday, August 11, Garz\u00f3n said to his wife and a makeup artist that he was going to be killed the next day. On Friday, August 13, at 5:45, local time, Garz\u00f3n was approaching the Radionet station in his gray Jeep Cherokee. When he was turning toward the south coming from 26th Street in the Barrio Quinta Paredes sector, in front of Corferias, two men riding a high velocity white motorcycle with hidden plates approached the car and called his name, then shot him five times. He was 38 years old. The word quickly spread as his own colleagues at Radionet were the first to give the news to Colombia. Hundreds of people went out into the streets. The vehicular traffic worsened when a pedestrian bridge fell onto the North Highway, near 122nd Street, because a group of people thought wrongly that the funeral would pass by the site. Three people died and 30 were injured. On that Friday night, sports presenter C\u00e9sar Augusto Londo\u00f1o for Noticiero CM& had to introduce a memorial note to Heriberto de la Calle, one of the characters of his murdered companion. He introduced the note saying: \"that's all for sports ... f***king country!\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-5cPRSY0_8 == Investigation == According to Judge Julio Roberto Ball\u00e9n Silva, the AUC reacted against his involvement in negotiations for the release of guerrilla-held hostages on behalf of their family members. There are several versions of what happened in the days preceding his murder. In one of them Garz\u00f3n was informed of an order to assassinate him; he then contacted Casta\u00f1o, who scheduled a meeting with him to take place just the day after his murder and sent a counter order to abort the assassination. The order apparently either never reached the actual killers, or came after it was too late. This led some to speculate that the meeting was a trap. An investigation conducted by the TV program Contrav\u00eda directed by Holman Morris provides evidence of the participation of agents of the Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS, the then state intelligence agency) in employing false witnesses to cause the investigation turn away from the real events. Likewise, the paramilitary leader Freddy Rend\u00f3n Herrera aka \"El Alem\u00e1n\" accused members of the military forces of being intellectual authors of the murder. === Casta\u00f1o is accused of being the mastermind of the crime === On September 13, 1999, the authorities reacted promptly to guarantee the arrest of the assassins of the journalist. Four people participated in the first investigations as key witnesses of the crime: Mar\u00eda Amparo Arroyave Mantilla, Wilson Llano Caballero alias El Profe, Maribel P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez and Wilson Ra\u00fal Ramirez Mu\u00f1oz. Although the time of the crime was too early and Mar\u00eda Amparo Arroyave was on the 4th floor of a building (located 100 meters from the place of the assassination) and the two hitmen were wearing helmets, she was able to give a detailed description of one of the assassins' face and clothing. On August 19, 1999, as an answer to the suggestion of a journalist, who had said that the responsibility for the crime of Garz\u00f3n fell on the military superiors, the Minister of Defense, Luis Fernando Ram\u00edrez, along with several commanders of the National Army, made a public declaration. In it, they announced that such suggestion was defamatory and that they rejected and condemned the crime of one of the best journalists of the end of the century, the best humorist and the sharpest critic of the Colombian society of the last decades. On January 6, 2000, the Police of Medell\u00edn arrested Juan Pablo Ortiz Agudelo, alias Bochas, who, according to the Administrative Department of Security, was the assassin that shot Garz\u00f3n and was recognized by Mar\u00eda Amparo Arroyave. On April 24 Carlos Casta\u00f1o, top leader of the AUC, was formally accused of being the mastermind of the crime. On June 6 he was declared absent defendant. On September 24, 2001, the Police arrested Edilberto Antonio Sierra Ayala in Bel\u00e9n de Umbr\u00eda under the accusation of being the other criminal who had driven the motorbike. On January 3, 2002, the tribunal made the closure of the process official. Therefore, a request of the civil part to review the case was ignored by the tribunal. === Complaints of manipulation of the investigation === On January 21, 2000, the Attorney General was the first entity to cast doubt on the veracity of Mar\u00eda Teresa Arroya Montoya's testimony. The Attorney then ordered a careful inspection of the place from which she claimed that she saw the crime. According to lawyer Alirio Uribe Mu\u00f1oz, the Attorney concluded that observing the details of the assassins from the place she claimed that she saw the crime was impossible. Furthermore, the Attorney found several contradictions in her description and a few coincidences with other witnesses's, who happened to be nearer to the place of the crime; none of them could remember the assassins' faces, because they were very fast. Nevertheless, none of these inconsistencies had been reviewed in the record. Arroyave Montoya then disappeared and then was contacted by the DAS agent Juan \u00c1ngel Ram\u00edrez Garc\u00eda, whom Attorney General Office did not allow his investigation. In October 2002, Reporters Without Borders and Red Damocles also questioned the veracity of Wilson Llano Caballero's testimony, who also was considered to be a key witness during the first investigation and was presented as a DAS Informant: He provided pictures and information about the alleged murderers, alias \u201cBochas\u201d and \u201cTo\u00f1o\u201d, and convinced his girlfriend, Maribel P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, and his neighbour, Wilson Ra\u00fal Ram\u00edrez, to declare against the two suspects. === Confessions of paramilitary leaders === On March 11, 2004, Judge Julio Roberto Ball\u00e9n Silva then acquitted the two alleged assassins of the journalist. The sentence allowed opening an investigation into the agents, officials and false witnesses of the first process. The tribunal concluded once more that Carlos Casta\u00f1o was the mastermind of the crime, therefore Casta\u00f1o was sentenced to 38 years in prison and fined 790 million pesos. However, in April of that very year, Casta\u00f1o was killed probably by disputes among the same paramilitary members. On May 9, 2008, the former Paramilitary leader Diego Fernando Murillo alias Don Berna, said that members of the criminal gang La Terraza of Medell\u00edn, that served Carlos Casta\u00f1o, were the assassins of Garz\u00f3n. In June 2008, paramilitary leader Jorge Iv\u00e1n Laverde, alias El Iguano, declared before Law of Justice and Peace that the former sub-director of the DAS, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Narv\u00e1ez, instigated Carlos Casta\u00f1o to kill Jaime Garz\u00f3n. A month later, in July, another paramilitary former member, Ever Veloza Garc\u00eda alias HH, gave a USB drive that belonged to Carlos Casta\u00f1o to the Attorney General and said that the USB contained evidence that Casta\u00f1o ordered La Terraza gang to assassinate Jaime Garz\u00f3n. Furthermore, Veloza said that Casta\u00f1o had said, at several occasions, that the crime of Garz\u00f3n was a mistake and that \"it was carried out to do some friends of the National Army a favor \". In October 2009 former paramilitary leader Freddy Rend\u00f3n Herrera, alias \"El Alem\u00e1n\", said to Justice and Peace process that Carlos Casta\u00f1o had ordered the assassination of the journalist under \"specific request of senior military leaders of the time\". == Popular culture == Garz\u00f3n is portrayed by the Colombian actor Jose Manuel Ospina as the character of 'Jairo Garc\u00eda' in TV Series Tres Ca\u00ednes. == References == === Notes === == External links == * Carlos Casta\u00f1o Gil convicted for murder of journalist Jaime Garz\u00f3n - IFEX *Cuatro a\u00f1os sin Jaime Garzon - Un Adi\u00f3s de Carnaval | Revista Numero Uno * Edificio Colombia.
