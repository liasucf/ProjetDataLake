It is under Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter-faith Harmony. ==Background== In June 2014, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the Peshawar church bombing case mandated the federal government to form a national council for minorities. Till 2018 no such Commission was formed. So the Centre for Social Justice, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and the Cecil and Iris Chaudhry Foundation filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court to have the judgement implemented. On 19 February 2020, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter- faith Harmony requested the Supreme Court to give more time for the formation of the commission and the Court gave 2 months to constitute the commission. ==Structure== The commission contains six official and 12 non-official members including the chairman for a term of three years. The 6 official members are chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology, secretary of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, one member from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Law and Justice, the Ministry of Human Rights and the Federal Education and Professional Training each. The 12 non-official members include 2 Muslims, 3 Hindus, 3 Christians, 2 Sikh, 1 Parsi and 1 Kalasha members. ==Criticism== The Ahmadiya were excluded from the Commission. A resolution seeking their inclusion was submitted in the Pakistan assembly in which it is said that the Ahmadiya to be included in the Commission, if their top leaders submits that the Ahmadiyas are non Muslims. The Hindu Sudhar Sabha criticized the commission for excluding Scheduled castes Hindus, who constitute majority of the Hindu community.
