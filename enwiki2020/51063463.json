    "text": "Revenue per mille (RPM) is the estimated earnings that accrue for every 1000 impressions received (in Latin, mille means thousand), a commonly used measurement in radio, television, newspaper, magazine, out-of-home, and online advertising. It is used in marketing as a benchmarking metric to calculate the relative cost of an advertising campaign or an ad message in a given medium. It is calculated by dividing the estimated earnings by the number of page views, impressions or queries received, then multiplying by 1000. ==See also== * CTR \u2013 Click-through rate * VTR \u2013 View-through rate * CPI \u2013 Cost per impression * PPC \u2013 Pay per click * CPA \u2013 Cost per acquisition * Internet marketing * CPC \u2013 Cost per click * Cost per lead * Cost per action * eCPA \u2013 effective cost per acquisition/action * Compensation methods ==References== De Guzman, C.
