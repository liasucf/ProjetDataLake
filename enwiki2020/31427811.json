In 2009, it was revived and has been taking place annually since, attracting about 40,000 runners in 2016. The most recent winners were German Tobias Singer and Russian Elena Tolstykh.https://www.4sport- live.com/results/leaders/?event=3075&Roll;=1&lan;=E&clean;=0https://www.worldathletics.org/athletes/germany/tobias- singer-324081https://www.worldathletics.org/athletes/russia/elena- tolstykh-516166 == History == The marathon is one of Tel Aviv's core annual international events. The Tel Aviv Marathon is a multi-course event allowing both professional and hobbyist runners to take part. The event includes an Inline Skating Half Marathon, and a 30 km Handcycle race for people with special needs. Marathon runners run along the seashore and main streets of Tel Aviv, an official UNESCO world heritage site. Some 35,000 runners were expected to take part in the 2013 marathon, with a range of different courses on offer. Due to unexpectedly high temperatures, the marathon did not take place as originally scheduled on March 15, 2013. Other races scheduled as part of the event, including the half marathon, 10 km races, 4.2 km race, and children's race did take place, but started earlier in the day than originally scheduled. Despite the precautions, one runner died, and twelve others were seriously injured.https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-one-dies-12-seriously- injured-in-ta-marathon-1.5234147 For the 2020 edition of the marathon, although foreigners were initially banned from competing due to concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic,https://www.timesofisrael.com/fearing- coronavirus-tel-aviv-bans-foreigners-from-competing-in-city- marathonhttp://thejewishvoice.com/2020/02/tel-aviv-marathon-bans-intl-runners- over-coronavirus-fears/https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Lift-Tel-Aviv-Marathon- ban-and-promote-spirit-of-courage-618947 the Ministry of Health partially lifted the ban days before the competition and allowed \"diplomats, foreign residents, and international residents\" that were already in Israel to participate in the marathon.https://www.tlvmarathon.co.il/images/TlvMaraton/marathon_tlv_2020_website_eng_sliders10.jpghttps://www.timesofisrael.com/tel- aviv-to-let-foreign-runners-already-in-israel-compete-in-marathon === Course records === The men's course record is 2:10:30, set in the 2015 edition by William Yegon of Kenya.
