Vegetation includes dense alluvial rainforest and dense tropical lowland rainforest. Tree species include Piranhea trifoliata, Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), Hevea spruceana and Parkia pendula. The reserve is occupied by about 92 indigenous or riverine communities whose main economic activities are collection of forest products such as Brazil nuts, copa\u00edba, andiroba, rubber, a\u00e7a\u00ed, urucur\u00ed and bacaba, and sustainable fishing. ==History== The reserve was created in response to a request to IBAMA in 2001 by the local extractive community association for the right to occupy the land and to expel communities that were degrading the environment. The M\u00e9dio Purus Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree on 8 May 2008. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). It aims to protect the livelihoods of the traditional residents and ensure the use and conservation of renewable natural resources traditionally used by these communities. On 18 September 2008 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e Reforma Agr\u00e1ria (INCRA \u2013 National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform) recognized the reserve as supporting 900 families, who would qualify for PRONAF support. This was revised to 1,400 families of 30 December 2008. On 29 April 2010 INCRA and ICMBio agreed to incorporate into the reserve the rural properties named Seringal Quichi\u00e3, Seringal Parij\u00f3s I and Seringal Parij\u00f3s II, with a total area of . The deliberative council was established on 4 November 2010. An ordinance of 9 January 2012 provided for a consistent and integrated approach to preparing management plans for the conservation units in the BR-319 area of influence. These are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuni\u00e3 Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari and Mapinguari national parks, Balata-Tufari, Humait\u00e1 and Iquiri national forests, and the Lago do Capan\u00e3-Grande, Rio Ituxi, M\u00e9dio Purus and Lago do Cuni\u00e3 extractive reserves. The usage plan of the reserve was approved on 8 November 2012. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * Category:Extractive reserves of Brazil Category:2008 establishments in Brazil Category:Protected areas of Amazonas (Brazilian state) ",
