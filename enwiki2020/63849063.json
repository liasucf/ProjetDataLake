Cor van der Gijp had 13 caps on the Dutch national team and was sold for 18,000 guilders to Feyenoord. After its best players left and under the pressure of the KNVB, who were concerned about the long-term viability of three professional football clubs from one town, SC Emma relegated to lower leagues (EBOH left professional football in 1962 and FC Dordrecht continues, usually in the Eerste Divisie). === 1960s\u20131980s: Back to amateur soccer and gradual decline === Going back to amateur football wasn't easy on SC Emma.
