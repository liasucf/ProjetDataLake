    "text": "The Voice Afrique francophone is the French-speaking African version of the reality singing competition The Voice, broadcast on VoxAfrica. It is based on the show The Voice of Holland, created by John de Mol. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train singers on their team and occasionally perform with them. The competitors are selected in auditions where the coaches listen to the auditioning contestant without seeing them. == Coaches and hosts == The show is hosted by Claudy Siar. The original coaching panel included Charlotte Dipanda, Lokua Kanza, A'salfo and Singuila. All four coaches initially returned for the second season, but when the last shows were postponed, A'salfo and Dipanda were replaced by Youssoupha and Josey respectively, to serve as coaches from the Quarterfinals until the end of the season. For the show's third cycle, Hiro Le Coq were confirmed as a new coach, while Charlotte Dipanda is also returning. On 26 July 2019, it was announced that Nayanka Bell will join the panel, along with Lokua Kanza who returns to the show for his third season as coach. == Series overview == Colour key : Team Lokua : Team Charlotte : Team Asalfo : Team Singuila : Team Nayanka : Team Hiro {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line- height:16px;\" width=\"100%\" |- ! width=\"4%\" rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Season ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"7%\" | Start ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"7%\" | Finish ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"08%\" | Winner ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"08%\" | Runner-up ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"08%\" | Third place ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"08%\" | Fourth place ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"08%\" | Winning coach ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"7%\" | Hosts ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" width=\"15%\"| Coaches (order) |- ! width=\"5%\" | 1 ! width=\"5%\" | 2 ! width=\"5%\" | 3 ! width=\"5%\" | 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"| 1 | October 15, 2016 | February 5, 2017 | style=\"background:#d0f0c0\" | Pamela Baketa | style=\"background:#ffe5b4\" | Verushka | style=\"background:Pink\" | Marie-Love | style=\"background:#ccf\" | Samson Nobou | style=\"background:#d0f0c0\" | Lokua Kanza | rowspan=3|Claudy Siar | rowspan=3 style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"| Lokua | rowspan=3 style=\"background:pink;\"| Charlotte | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Asalfo | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#ffe5b4;\"| Singuila |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2 | October 14, 2017 | April 18, 2018 | style=\"background:pink\"| Victoire Biaku | style=\"background:#ffe5b4\" | Fulbert | style=\"background:#ccf\" | Ren\u00e9 | style=\"background:#ffe5b4\" | Dadiposlim | style=\"background:pink\"| Charlotte Dipanda |- ! scope=\"row\"| 3 | February 15, 2020 | TBA ! colspan=\"5\"| temporarily suspended due to covid-19 pandemic | style=\"background:#dda0dd;\"| Nayanka | style=\"background:#afeeee;\"| Hiro |- |} ==The Voice Kids Afrique Francophone== In February 2019, VoxAfrica announced their version of The Voice Kids, which is expected to start in 2020. ==References== Category:The Voice (franchise) Category:French-language television shows ",
