When his father joined the Phillies in 1979, Rose Jr. spent time with Aaron Boone, Bret Boone, Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw in the Phillies clubhouse. He appeared on a 1982 Fleer baseball card (#640) titled \"Pete & Re-Pete; Pete Rose & son\" with his father; he was twelve at the time. As a teenager, on September 11, 1985, he made an emotional on-field appearance live on ESPN to celebrate with his father after Rose Sr. broke Ty Cobb's record for most career hits. ==Baseball career== In his youth, Rose played baseball for Bridgetown, a suburb of Cincinnati. He would later become a fixture in baseball's minor leagues. He began his pro baseball career when he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles and was assigned to the Erie Orioles of the New York\u2013Penn League in 1989.

Later that year, Rose was called up to the Cincinnati Reds for his first and only time in the major leagues. He hit only .143 in just 11 games for the Reds, but was widely shown on popular sports highlight shows when he copied his dad's famous crouching batting stance during the first pitch of his first Major League at-bat. The junior Rose's two MLB hits give him and his father 4,258 hits, the fourth-most ever by a father and son behind Bobby and Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr., and Gus and Buddy Bell. (The Roses are also the only father-and-son combo to get over 6,000 hits in pro ball, majors and minors, with 6,467 at the end of 2009.) Another of Rose's notable feats in the minors was, in 1998, while playing for the Indianapolis Indians of the International League, he and three teammates hit for the rare \"homer cycle\" in one inning; Rose opened the inning with a solo home run; Jason Williams, three at-bats later, hit a three-run home run; four batters later, Glen Murray hit a grand slam; and two hitters later, Guillermo Garcia hit a two-run shot to complete the cycle. Rose played for the Tigres del Chinandega, a Nicaraguan professional baseball team during the \u2013 offseason. In 2007 and 2008, he played for the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League.

When taken orally, GBL is converted to the \"date-rape\" drug GHB [gamma hydroxybutyrate]. Rose pleaded guilty to this charge on November 7, 2005, claiming that he distributed GBL to teammates to help them relax after games.
