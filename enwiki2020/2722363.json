The group released five albums before disbanding in 1997. After the split, Methric and Spaniolo sent a demo tape to Insane Clown Posse member Violent J. The demo contained the tracks \"2nd Hand Smoke,\" \"Diemuthafuckadie,\" and \"How Does It Feel?\" Bruce was extremely impressed, invited Methric and Spaniolo to perform on 'The House of Horrors Tour', and signed them to Psychopathic Records. Before the tour kicked off, Bruce, Methric and Spaniolo decided on a name that they felt would fit the duo\u2014\"Twiztid\". === Recording === \"Murder Murder Murder\" was recorded with the intention of being included on another House of Krazees album,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1EOZAUka0U but the group broke up before the album was completed, and the R.O.C.'s verse was deleted from the Mostasteless release of the song. Most of the other songs were written especially for the album, except for \"First Day Out\", which is a cover of the Insane Clown Posse song which appeared on their 1992 debut Carnival of Carnage. \"2nd Hand Smoke\" samples the chorus from En Vogue's \"Free Your Mind\". \"85 Bucks An Hour\" samples \"It Takes Two by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock. Twiztid recorded with guest appearances by Insane Clown Posse on \"Meat Cleaver\" and \"85 Bucks An Hour\", and Myzery on \"Meat Cleaver\". ICP's producer, Mike E. Clark, and Scott Sumner. Joseph Utsler has a non-rap spoken interlude on \"She Ain't Afraid\". Joseph Bruce provided additional vocals on other songs. \"Rendition of Reality\" contained a hidden track which revealed a hotline number. == Release == Mostasteless was initially released In 1998 by Psychopathic Records; while alternate cover artwork depicted a two-headed fetus, the main cover artwork depicted the faces of Spaniolo and Methric. Psychopathic had not had success with attempting to release albums by artists other than Insane Clown Posse, but Mostasteless was well received by ICP's Juggalo fanbase.Man's Myth DVD, Psychopathic, 2005. While on tour with ICP, Twiztid learned that Psychopathic would pull Mostasteless from stores, and that it would be reissued by Island Records. The Island reissue reorganized the track listing, deleting the \"Smoke Break\" skits, a hidden track at the end of \"Renditions of Reality\", Violent J laughing at the end of \"1st Day Out\", sampled dialogue from the film Halloween III: Season of the Witch at the beginning of \"Whatthefuck!?!?\" along with a few of the lines and the songs \"Murder, Murder, Murder\", \"Somebody Dissin' U\", \"Meat Cleaver\" and \"She Ain't Afraid\", but added the new songs \"Rock the Dead\", \"Spin the Bottle\", \"Blink\", \"Bury Me Alive\" and \"Hound Dogs\". Additionally, some of the lyrics in \"Diemuthafuckadie\" and \"Whatthefuck!?!?\" are censored on the Island reissue. This version was released on June 22, 1999, and peaked at #8 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #149 on the Billboard 200. == Reception == In his review of the reissued album, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \"[Although] the thought of a group of Insane Clown Posse prot\u00e9g\u00e9s isn't exactly inspiring\", the album \"may take you by surprise...Mostasteless actually works better than most ICP records,\" that \"Twiztid often is more convincing than [its] Dark Carnival colleagues,\" and concluded that \"if you don't buy into the whole comic book-horror shtick, Mostasteless...will be irritating, but if you've bought into it, you'll enjoy this record as much, if not more, than most ICP albums.\" == Legacy == Following the Island reissue, rare tracks from the original version of Mostasteless appeared on the compilations Psychopathics from Outer Space, Cryptic Collection and Cryptic Collection Vol. 2. \"Whathefuck!?!?\", \"Somebody's Dissin' U\" and \"Renditions of Reality\" were remixed on Cryptic Collection.
