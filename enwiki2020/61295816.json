    "text": "All Saints' Church, Oakleigh Park This is a list of cathedrals, churches and chapels in the London Borough of Barnet within the Greater London. The list focuses on the more permanent churches and buildings which identify themselves as places of Christian worship. The denominations appended are those by which they self-identify. ==History== London's churches and chapels are extraordinarily numerous and diverse. Anglican and nonconformist churches and chapels are most numerous, but there are also many Catholic churches as well as places of worship for non-Christian religions. Most of the Anglican churches lie within the Anglican dioceses of London to the north and Southwark to the south. A few Anglican churches in the Barnet area fall into the Diocese of St Albans, reflecting the historical association of Barnet with Hertfordshire. As London expanded during the early 19th century, many new churches and chapels were built independently by the growing nonconformist urban population. Churches in this list belong to various denominations, as indicated. ==List of churches== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Church name !! Location !Dedication!!Web !Founded!!
