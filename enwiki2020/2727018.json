This description consists of the number of pages (or a list of such numberings separated by commas, if the book contains separately-numbered sections), followed by the abbreviation \"p.\" for \"page(s)\". The number of pages is written in the same style (Arabic or Roman numerals, uppercase or lowercase, etc.) as the numbering in each section. Unnumbered pages are not described. For example, :XI, 2050 p. describes a book with two sections, where section one contains 11 pages numbered using uppercase Roman numerals, and section two contains 2050 pages numbered using Arabic numerals; the total number of pages is thus 2061 pages, plus any unnumbered pages. If the book contains too many separately-numbered sections, too many unnumbered pages, or only unnumbered pages, the librarian may choose to describe the book as just \"1 v.\" (one volume) when doing original cataloguing ==See also== * Recto and verso * Page spread * Book design ==References== *http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhome.html *http://www.ifla.org/VI/3/p1996-1/sect.htm Category:Paper Category:Typography ru:\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 ",
