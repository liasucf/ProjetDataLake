    "text": "KKNO (750 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station broadcasting an Urban Gospel radio format. Licensed to Gretna, Louisiana, the station serves the New Orleans metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by Robert C. Blakes Enterprises, Inc. It uses the slogan \"Unmistakably Christian Radio.\" By day, KKNO is powered at 250 watts, using a non-directional antenna. But because AM 750 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A WSB in Atlanta, KKNO is a daytimer. To avoid interference, it must go off the air at night. The transmitter is on Industry Street in Harvey, Louisiana.Radio-Locator.com/KKNO ==History== On September 10, 1988, the station signed on the air.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook page D-253 As a construction permit, the unbuilt station was assigned the call letters KAIG on 1987-09-14.
