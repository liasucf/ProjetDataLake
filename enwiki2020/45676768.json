    "text": "CNN Philippines Updates, or simply Updates, is a Philippine news brief television program that airs on CNN Philippines. It debuted on March 1, 2012. ==History== It was launched on March 1, 2012 under the channel's predecessors Solar News Channel (as Solar News Update and Solar Headlines) and 9TV (as Headlines) and currently airs at 9:30am and 11:30 am on weekday mornings, 2:30pm and every 30 minutes from 4:00pm to 5:00pm on weekday afternoons, and on weekends every hour from 9:00am to 5:00pm. ==Special cases== When warranted, Updates can be aired beyond its regular news brief format for special coverages; and when a breaking story occurs, it will air as CNN Philippines Breaking News. If a particular/political event occurs (e.g. presidential speeches, media briefings etc.), CNN Philippines Happening Now is being aired. Whenever possible, breaking stories from CNN International may be simulcasted on CNN Philippines, before or after the local updates air; in some cases, CNN PH may keep some of the simulcast overnight. Since 2017, rolling coverage are streamed via Facebook Live (which has been utilized by several Philippine media organizations). With this latest innovation, regular programming can resume while encouraging viewers to stream the coverage online in their Facebook page where latest developments continue to be received throughout time. ===Weekend expansion=== The weekend editions premiered on June 13, 2015. Prior to the permanent expansion, it only aired when major developing stories warrant and during severe weather coverage, notably Typhoon Ruby in December 2014. Unlike the weekday newsbriefs that rotate every half- hour, the weekend updates air every top of the hour. ==Various Contributors== *Mai Rodriguez (morning, breaking news) *Pia Hontiveros (primetime, breaking news) *Pinky Webb (fill-in, afternoon, breaking news) *Ruth Cabal (evening, breaking news) *Menchu Macapagal (fill-in, weekdays) *Claire Celdran (fill-in, weekend, breaking news) ==Previous Presenters== *Amelyn Veloso\u2020 *Mitzi Borromeo *Cherie Mercado *Hilary Isaac *Roanna Jamir *Claudine Trillo *Nicolette Henson-Hizon Category:2012 Philippine television series debuts Category:CNN Philippines original programming Category:CNN Philippines Category:CNN Philippines News and Current Affairs Category:English-language television shows Category:Philippine television news shows ",
