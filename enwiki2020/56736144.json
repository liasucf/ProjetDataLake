    "text": "Joanna Jean Putterill is a New Zealand molecular botanist. She is currently a full professor at the University of Auckland. ==Academic career== After a thesis titled 'Par homology and incompatibility in the IncFI plasmid group' and a 1985 PhD titled 'Molecular strategies for developing aluminium tolerance in plants' both at the University of Auckland, Putterill joined the staff, rising to full professor in 2016. Putterill's research interests are the molecular basis of observed behaviour in plants, especially circadian and annual rhythms. Much research has been collaborative with staff from Plant and Food Research. Putterill has received a number of Marsden grants. In 2017, Putterill was appointed director for Joint Graduate School in Plant and Food Science, a collaboration with Plant and Food Research. == Selected works == * Putterill, Joanna, Frances Robson, Karen Lee, R\u00fcdiger Simon, and George Coupland. \"The CONSTANS gene of Arabidopsis promotes flowering and encodes a protein showing similarities to zinc finger transcription factors.\" Cell 80, no. 6 (1995): 847\u2013857. * Schaffer, Robert, Nicola Ramsay, Alon Samach, Sally Corden, Joanna Putterill, Isabelle A.
