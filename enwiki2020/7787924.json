    "text": "Ralph Gonzales Recto (born January 11, 1964) is a Filipino politician serving as the president pro tempore of the Philippine Senate since 2017, previously holding the position from 2013 to 2016. Since 2010, he has been on his second stint in the Senate, first serving from 2001 to 2007. He was the representative of Batangas' 4th district from 1992 to 2001. In 2007, Recto lost his reelection bid because, as many analysts believed, he had authored the unpopular EVAT (Expanded Value Added Tax) law. In July 2008 he was appointed to head the National Economic and Development Authority in the Arroyo administration, but resigned from his position in August 2009 in preparation for another run for the Senate in the 2010 elections. He is a grandson of statesman Claro M. Recto. His wife is actress-politician Vilma Santos. ==Early life== Recto comes from a political family. His grandfather, the late nationalist and statesman Claro M. Recto, was a Senator for several terms. His father, Atty. Rafael Recto, was an Assemblyman during the Regular Batasang Pambansa while his older brother, Ricky Recto, was the former vice governor of the province of Batangas. His late mother is Carmen Gonzalez- Recto. His sister, Plinky Recto, is an actress and TV host. ==Education== Recto acquired a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration at the De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde, at the time was a constituent college of De La Salle University. He entered the College of Public Administration of the University of the Philippines, Diliman to acquire a Master of Public Administration degree; he attended the program in the first semester from 1991-1992, but later entered the University of Asia and the Pacific to take an 11-month course to acquire a graduate certificate in business economics under the Strategic Business Economics Program of the university's School of Economics. He also took up a Leadership Scholarship Course at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. ==Political career== ===House of Representatives: 1992\u20132001=== Recto holds the distinction of being the youngest elected member of the House of Representatives during the 9th Congress. He also holds an unprecedented record in the congressional election history of Batangas for winning in all precincts, barangays, and municipalities, together with Lipa City, in the 1995 and 1998 elections. He garnered 98% of the votes cast in those two elections in the 4th District of Batangas. During his three terms (from 1992 to 2001) as a member of the House of Representatives, most of his legislative measures enacted into law deal with economic reforms and poverty alleviation, among which are the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act; the Philippine Economic Zone Law; Amendment to the Special Economic Zone Law; the Retail Trade Liberalization Law; Regional Headquarters Law; and the Comprehensive Tax Reform Law. ===First term in the Senate: 2001\u20132007=== Recto was elected to the Senate in 2001, becoming the youngest Senator of the 12th Congress at the age of 37.

During nominal voting, Pimentel voted for Recto. Recto voted for Pimentel. After losing the vote, Recto automatically became the Minority Leader. He was joined by Escudero and Trillanes. Recto, in his acceptance speech for the post, vowed that the minority would cooperate with the Duterte administration's plans if these serve \"the public interest.\" However, he said, they would be \"duty- bound\" to oppose the majority's agenda if it \"hurts the nation.\" When the Senate underwent a reorganization on February 27, 2017, Recto, after getting 17 votes, was declared Senate President Pro Tempore, replacing Drilon.
