    "text": "SDB-005 is an indazole-based synthetic cannabinoid that has been sold online as a designer drug. It is presumed to be an agonist of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. SDB-005 is the indazole core analog of PB-22 where the 8-hydroxyquinoline has also been replaced with a naphthalene group. The code number SDB-005 was originally used for a different compound, the N-phenyl instead of N-benzyl analogue of SDB-006. This compound is a potent agonist of the CB1 receptor (Ki = 21 nM) and CB2 receptor (Ki = 140 nM). Original, non designer drug SDB-005 However, SDB-005 was subsequently used as the name for the indazole-3-carboxylate compound mentioned above when it was sold in Europe as a designer drug, and was entered into the EMCDDA synthetic drug database under this name.EWS_EU: Neue Psychoaktive Substanzen, April 2015 Consequently, there are now two distinct, yet fairly closely related cannabinoid compounds, which may both be referred to under the code SDB-005. == See also == * 5F-PB-22 * AM-2201 * BB-22 * JWH-018 * NM-2201 * NNE1 == References == Category:Indazoles Category:Cannabinoids Category:Designer drugs ",
