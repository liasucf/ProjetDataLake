    "text": "David Zachary (Zach) Hambrick is a psychology professor at Michigan State University, known for his research on the effects of practice on proficiency in various skills. Hambrick's research has concluded that practice is important in explaining ability in fields such as chess, music, and academics, but less so than argued by other psychologists, notably K. Anders Ericsson. Hambrick contends that, in addition to amount of practice, working memory capacity is associated with better performance on a wide variety of tasks. ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page * Category:Living people Category:American psychologists Category:Michigan State University faculty Category:Methodist University alumni Category:Georgia Tech alumni Category:Cognitive psychologists Category:Experimental psychologists Category:Intelligence researchers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
