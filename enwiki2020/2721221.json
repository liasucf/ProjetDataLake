    "text": "Pascal Arbez-Nicolas (; born 18 May 1976), better known by his stage name Vitalic (), is a French electronic music producer. ==History== His first singles were released in 1996 and 1997, but were confined to underground electronic music scene. However, he became good friends with techno producer The Hacker, whom he met in Le Rex Club, the \"techno temple\" of Laurent Garnier. \"The Hacker\" suggested he should send his new tracks to DJ Hell, head of International DeeJay Gigolo Records in Munich. Pascal did so, and International DeeJay Gigolo Records released the well known Poney EP in 2001, which was a huge success shortly after its release. With the track \"La Rock 01\", Vitalic created a club anthem which was a hit in the summer of 2001. The track was also included on many compilation albums, even rock compilations. Miss Kittin included \"La Rock 01\" on her DJ mix album On the Road. In 2005, Vitalic's released his debut album, OK Cowboy, on Different/PIAS Recordings. Pascal states that all of the instruments used in the album are synthesized. His official website states that \"the only thing he can't fake is the emotion that galvanizes his music.\" His song \"Trahison\" from OK Cowboy was used in the trailer for the 2007 French film Naissance des Pieuvres. His song \"Poney Part 1\" was featured in the Pleix film Birds. It was announced by Festival Republic that Vitalic would be playing both the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK in August 2009. Vitalic's second studio album Flashmob was released on 28 September 2009. The first single, \"Your Disco Song\" is available for streaming at Vitalic's MySpace page. He has spoken a great deal about the new disco influence on Flashmob. The song \"Poison Lips\" from Flashmob was used in the 2012 film Dredd, and for a 2016 TV advertisement for Amazon. Flashmob also provided the soundtrack for the film La leggenda di Kaspar Hauser. Vitalic's third studio album, Rave Age, was released on 5 November 2012. On Metacritic, Rave Age was a combined \"metascore\" of 66 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" In late 2016, Vitalic began a new live tour across Europe ahead of the release of his fourth studio album, Voyager, which was released on 20 January 2017. On Metacritic, Voyager has a combined \"metascore\" of 71 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" == Discography == ===Albums=== *OK Cowboy (2005) *OK Cowboy (two-disc collector's edition) (2006) *V Live (2007) * R\u00e9sum\u00e9 (DJ mix album, previously titled This Is the Sound of Citizen) (2007) * Flashmob (2009) *Rave Age (2012) *Voyager (2017) ===Singles / EPs=== *Poney EP (2001) *\"To L'An-fer From Chicago\" (2003) *\"Fanfares\" (2004) *\"My Friend Dario\" (2005) *\"No Fun\" (2005) *\"Bells\" (2006) with Linda Lamb *\"Disco Terminateur EP\" (2009) *\"Poison Lips\" (2009) *\"Second Lives\" (2010) *\"Remix del Blankito from Turiaso\" (2011) *\"Stamina\" (2013) *\"Fade Away\" (2013) *\"Film Noir\" (2016) *\"Waiting For The Stars\" (2017) *\"tu conmigo\" (2017) ===Remixes=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\" width=\"40\"|Year !|Artist !|Title |- |align=\"center\"valign=\"center\" rowspan=\"6\"|2002 |Lady B |\"Swany\" |- |Slam feat.
