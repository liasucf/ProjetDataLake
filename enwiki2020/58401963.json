    "text": "Video game addiction is considered an impulse control disorder, analogous to pathological gambling that does not include using intoxicating drugs. In China, as well as other parts of the world, the disorder is considered a problem. In June 2018, the World Health Organization listed \"gaming disorder\" in the 11th Revision of its International Classification of Diseases. According to its definition, it is characterized by impaired control, prioritizing gaming by giving excessive time to games rather than other activities, lack of other interests in daily activities, and the continuation of gaming despite the negative consequences. ==Possible addictive elements in video games== Many video games have no pre-defined endgame. The inclusion of downloadable content (DLC) means the game continues to expand over time. DLC enables developers to expand their games and attract others for a player to play against. There is always another game. Video games satisfy the need of social connections and activities. Today's games encourage players to interact with each other, supporting the societal demand for interpersonal connections. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games are an example of this. Level reward systems are addictive, and provide incentives to the player to level up. In the introductory period of a game, players begin with basic characteristics with regards to attributes and skills. At low levels, it takes little effort to level up and progress. Each new level requires progressively more work to reach. Multiplayer games do not end; this kind of game often encourages players to connect and collaborate with gamers around the world. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games let players connect with each other. Examples include League of Legends and PUBG. Video games often have digital currencies. The more time players spend in a game, the more \"wealth\" they acquire. Players use this virtual wealth to \"purchase\" new aspects of the game. Rewards are set on different time schedules in video games. Players may be rewarded for finishing tasks within a certain time frame, or might be given bonuses for playing during a pre-determined period. The virtual gaming world continues to evolve, even when players are not online. Even when players are not playing, the game's world may continue to develop. This creates an incentive to keep playing the game due to the fear of falling behind. Top players or teams can receive rewards in real life, as some tournaments offer cash prizes. Video games do not reward short and unscheduled periods of player time. Achieving competency in games requires a large time investment. Casual players will often be unable to catch up to more dedicated players due to their lack of skills or in-game items. Video games can generate strong emotions in players. Addictive games offer unique methods to create emotional connections with players. It is an unconscious decision for people addicted to computer games to spend more time playing when they are emotionally invested in a game. Modern video games are enormous and dense. Many modern games focus on delivering large amounts of content through open-world levels or compulsion loops, allowing the player to delve deeply into a world for long periods of time. ==Consequences== Game addiction can lead to mental and physical problems. In March 2005, a gamer named Zhu was stabbed by a fellow player, Qiu, in Shanghai. Qui had bought a dragon saber sword from the game The Legend of Mir 3 from Zhu on eBay. In 2007, a person died from a heart attack in Jinzhou after playing Internet games persistently during the Spring Festival. In the same year, it was reported that a 30-year-old man in Guangzhou died after playing video games continuously for three days. A 21-year-old woman lost sight in her right eye after overexposure to a mobile video game. In 2015, a thirty-two-year-old man died after playing computer games for three days in a Taiwanese Internet bar. A gamer became paralyzed after he played computer games non-stop for 20 hours at an Internet cafe. In 2019, China set up a curfew, banning minors from playing at certain hours. == Treatment == Treatments may include in-patient intervention programs with a team of mental health professionals are specialized in combating computer game addiction. Wilderness therapy, which is similar to in-patient treatment, provides treatment in an outdoor setting devoid of any technology or electronic devices. One-on-one counselling with a psychologist or mental health professional, experienced in working with computer game addictions, may be useful. Family therapy entails a therapist looking at the family system and how it interacts with family activities. Computer game addiction books are available that allow an individual to self-treat their issues. == Restrictions == The Chinese government, in 2005, introduced an online gaming restriction. This restriction would limit the playing time for players whose age is under 18 to three hours (18 years old is the Chinese legal definition of an adult). If the a player under 18 years of age exceeds three hours of gameplay in a single day, they will no longer be able to receive bonuses for that day. For example, their characters may no longer receive experience points or virtual currency. The Chinese government's Department of Culture required that all the online games published in China to have a \"Healthy Gaming Advisory\" on its main loading page. In 2017 Tencent Games restricted young players to one or two hours of playing online games due to concerns about children's development. The New gaming restriction policy set up by Tencent was first applied to the mobile phone online game Strike of Kings Teenagers who are under 12 years old are restricted to playing the game one hour per day, with no online access after 9:00 pm. Teenagers who are between 12 and 18 are restricted to two hours playing a day. == References == Category:Digital media use and mental health Category:Behavioral addiction Category:Chinese popular culture Category:Video game culture Category:Video gaming in China Category:Internet in China Category:Online games ",
