    "text": "The Sheffield Association League was an English association football league based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. ==History== The league was founded in 1897 to fill the void left by the disbandment of the Sheffield & District Football League, which had run from 1889 to 1895. It soon established itself as the foremost league competition for non-league clubs in the south of Yorkshire. In 1960 the league was renamed the Sheffield & Hallamshire County Senior League. The league was suspended for the duration of the First World War but continued throughout the Second World War. In 1983 the league merged with the Hatchard League to form a new competition, albeit one which kept the County Senior League name.http://www.sheffieldfa.com/news/2013/apr/county- senior-league-collect-top-award ==Champions== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Season ! |- | 1896\u201397 | Sheffield United reserves |- | 1897\u201398 | Parkgate United |- | 1898\u201399 | Parkgate United & Worksop Town (shared) |- | 1899\u201300 | Sheffield Wednesday reserves |- | 1900\u201301 | Sheffield Wednesday reserves |- | 1901\u201302 | Barnsley reserves |- | 1902\u201303 | Rotherham Town |- | 1903\u201304 | Mexborough Town |- | 1904\u201305 | Thornhill United reserves |- | 1905\u201306 | South Kirkby Colliery |- | 1906\u201307 | South Kirkby Colliery |- | 1907\u201308 | Wath Athletic |- | 1908\u201309 | Denaby United reserves |- | 1909\u201310 | Monckton Athletic |- | 1910\u201311 | Wath Athletic |- | 1911\u201312 | Wath Athletic |- | 1912\u201313 | Wath Athletic |- | 1913\u201314 | South Kirkby Colliery |- | 1914\u201315 | Rotherham County reserves |- | 1915\u201316 | Hoyland United |- | 1916\u201317 | rowspan=\"3\"|No competition due to WWI |- | 1917\u201318 |- | 1918\u201319 |- | 1919\u201320 | Bentley Colliery |- | 1920\u201321 | Frickley Colliery |- | 1921\u201322 | Gainsborough Trinity reserves |- |1922\u201323 | Worksop Town reserves |- |1923\u201324 | Eckington Works |- |1924\u201325 | Attercliffe |- |1925\u201326 | Maltby Main |- |1926\u201327 | Maltby Main |- |1927\u201328 | Norton Woodseats |- |1928\u201329 | Worksop Town reserves |- |1929\u201330 | South Kirkby Colliery |- |1930\u201331 | South Kirkby Colliery |- |1931\u201332 | Wath Athletic |- |1932\u201333 | Silverwood Colliery |- |1933\u201334 | Thurnscoe Victoria |- |1934\u201335 | Dinnington Athletic |- |1935\u201336 | Rawmarsh Welfare |- |1936\u201337 | Thurnscoe Victoria |- |1937\u201338 | Norton Woodseats |- |1938\u201339 | Rawmarsh Welfare |- |1939\u201340 | Bolsover Colliery |- |1940\u201341 | Denaby United |- |1941\u201342 | Royal Army Service Corps |- |1942\u201343 | Thurcroft Main |- |1943\u201344 | Sheffield Wednesday reserves |- |1944\u201345 | Royal Army Service Corps |- |1945\u201346 | Thurnscoe Victoria |- |1946\u201347 | Kilnhurst Colliery |- |1947\u201348 | Worksop Town |- |1948\u201349 | Worksop Town |- |1949\u201350 | Hallam |- |1950\u201351 | Rawmarsh Welfare |- |1951\u201352 | Beighton Miners Welfare reserves |- |1952\u201353 | Thorncliffe Recreation |- |1953\u201354 | Upton Colliery |- |1954\u201355 | Denaby United reserves |- |1955\u201356 | Upton Colliery |- |1956\u201357 | Upton Colliery |- |1957\u201358 | Grimethorpe Athletic |- |1958\u201359 | Upton Colliery |- |1959\u201360 | Thorncliffe Recreation |- |1960\u201361 | Worksop Town |- |1961\u201362 | Parkgate Welfare |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Season !Division One !Division Two |- |1962\u201363 | Worksop Town reserves | Penistone Church |- |1963\u201364 | Brown Bayley Steels | Hatfield Main reserves |- |1964\u201365 | Harworth Colliery Institute |Dearne Community & Miners Welfare |- |1965\u201366 | Worsbrough Bridge Miners Welfare | Maltby Miners Welfare |- |1966\u201367 | Manton Athletic | Frecheville Community |- |1967\u201368 | Frecheville Community | Sheffield Waterworks |- |1968\u201369 | Sheffield Waterworks | Centralians |- |1969\u201370 | Worsbrough Bridge Miners Welfare | Worksop Town reserves |- |1970\u201371 | Woolley Miners Welfare | Kilnhurst Colliery |- |1971\u201372 | Kilnhurst Colliery | Charlton United |- |1972\u201373 | Pilkington Recreation | Brown Bayley Steels |- |1973\u201374 | Kilnhurst Colliery | Jubilee Sports |- |1974\u201375 | Swinton Athletic | Kiveton Park reserves |- |1975\u201376 | Harworth Colliery Institute | BSC Parkgate reserves |- |1976\u201377 | Swinton Athletic | Ecclesfield Red Rose |- |1977\u201378 | Charlton Tavern | Norton Woodseats reserves |- |1978\u201379 | Ecclesfield Red Rose | Woodhouse Ashberry |- |1979\u201380 | Swinton Athletic | Double Barrel |- |1980\u201381 | Swinton Athletic | Kiveton Park reserves |- |1981\u201382 | Double Barrel | Yorkshire Main Colliery |- |1982\u201383 | Yorkshire Main Colliery | Windsor |} ==References== Category:Sports leagues established in 1897 Category:Football in South Yorkshire Category:Defunct football leagues in England Category:Defunct football competitions in South Yorkshire ",
