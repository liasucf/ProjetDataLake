Short Synopsis In a dystopia of useless products, pre-paid dreams, and a system of 'violations' so invasive that if you laugh too loudly you will be fined, Misner Corporation has invented a new source of energy, generating a monopoly on all facets of human existence. The world is now a totalitarian global state ruled by one man. Anyone unwilling to work for Misner's regime lives underground in a dark world of insane system 'dropouts'. Finnegan Wright, a lower level worker at Misner Corp. is taken on an enthralling journey when one of these dropouts kidnaps Finnegan and tries to convince him to change the fate of the world by killing Misner. Sydney International Sci Fi Film festival co-director Lisa Mitchell said. \"Director Nathan Christoffel and his cast and crew, deserve to be warmly congratulated. To have independently produced such a visually and conceptually sophisticated film as their feature debut is a major accomplishment and a testament to the creativity of Australian genre cinema\". The first screening of Eraser Children was a sell out screening of the unfinished film at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival in 2009. The Film went on to take the top award at that festival winning 'Best Australian Film' and 'Best Supporting Actor' Shane Nagle. ==Filmography== ;Short Films {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
