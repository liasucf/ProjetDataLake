The suburb has two distinct areas; there is a coastal strip which includes Wamberal Beach and the Lagoon estuary which houses medium to high density residential properties, as well as a semi-rural area, slightly west of the beach. The latter contains coastal acreages and ridges of bushland which are legislated non-development areas in order to retain the area's ecosystem. The main thoroughfare through the suburb is the Central Coast Highway through the north and south, previously known as The Entrance Road. Since 2008, the roadway has undergone developments at an estimated cost of A$100 million into a four lane dual carriageway from Matcham to the north end of the suburb. Servicing the suburb from the south-east is Ocean View Drive, linking Wamberal to Terrigal. Wamberal has small clusters of high-end cafes, restaurants and boutique stores dotted along the beach front strip, Ocean View Drive, and on nearby streets.

This motif was heralded in 2008 by the passing in at auction of a 1940s bungalow on a double block of beach front land at A$7.2 million. The property has since been redeveloped, believed to be worth in excess of $10 million, which would make it the most valuable home on the Central Coast. This practice of redevelopment of property within Wamberal is shifting property prices further upmarket and moving the suburb further into the limelight with wealthier home buyers. This shift may also be due to the redevelopment of local amenities such as playgrounds and community spaces such as parks, some of which were initiated under the Nation Building Scheme of the Rudd Government's Economic Stimulus Policy. In September 2010, the median house price for Wamberal was $1.1 million. == References == *Guide to Sydney Beaches *\"Sand in our Souls - the Beach in Australian History\" Leone Huntsman, MUP, 2001 Category:Suburbs of the Central Coast (New South Wales) ",
