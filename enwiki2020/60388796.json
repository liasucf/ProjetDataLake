    "text": "Ark\u00e9a Arena (previously known as the Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole Arena) is a multi- purpose indoor arena in Floirac, near Bordeaux in France. Opened in January 2018, it offers a capacity for all types of shows and events from 2,500 to 11,300. The arena is mainly used for concerts and sporting events. ==Construction== Lagard\u00e8re Live Entertainment (agent and operator), Bouygues B\u00e2timent Centre Sud-Ouest (a subsidiary of Bouygues Construction), and architect Rudy Ricciotti won the tender on 20 December 2013. The building permit was granted in July 2015, work started in early 2016, and the first stone was laid on 11 April 2016. The construction ends in January 2018. It was designed by the architect to look like a pebble, deposited on the shore by the Garonne river that flows alongside. The project meets the need to create a concert hall in the Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole capable of hosting tours of international artists, which the Patinoire de M\u00e9riadeck ice rink does not allow. ==History== The official inauguration took place on 24 January 2018 with a concert by Depeche Mode during their Global Spirit Tour, with 11,000 tickets sold out in minutes. On 3 October 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Ark\u00e9a obtained the naming rights of the venue, which officially becomes \"Ark\u00e9a Arena\". This sponsorship is confirmed for a period of 10 years. ==Events== === Concerts === {|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" width=50% style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Concerts at Ark\u00e9a Arena |- !

On event days, a shuttle bus operates from Porte de Bourgogne station connecting the arena to the Bordeaux tramway network. The service starts 2 hours before a show begins and terminates approximately one hour after a performance finishes. A paid parking of 962 places is annexed to the venue and is operated by the company Parcub (parking control of the m\u00e9tropole). A VCUB bike station is located nearby with 20 docking points. 500 bicycle spaces are also available. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indoor arenas in France Category:Music venues in France Category:Sports venues in Gironde Category:Sports venues completed in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in France Category:Music venues completed in 2018 Category:Rudy Ricciotti buildings ",
