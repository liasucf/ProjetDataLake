    "text": "Hamgyong Province () was one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Hamgy\u014fng was located in the northeast of Korea. The provincial capital was Hamh\u016dng. ==Names== The province was first established as Yonggil (, , Y\u014fnggil) in 1413. It was renamed Hamgil (, ) three years later. In 1470, it was renamed Yongan (, , Y\u014fngan). In 1509, it was renamed Hamgyong after its two principal cities, Hamhung (, , Hamh\u016dng, \"Complete Success\") and Kyongsong (, , Ky\u014fngs\u014fng, \"Mirror,\" \"Clear,\" or \"Perceptive City\"). In the 18th century, this was transcribed via Chinese as Kyen-king and glossed as meaning \"the Happy\". In the 19th century, it was transcribed as Ham-kieng. Within Korea, the province was also referred to by the regional name Dongbuk (\"Northeast\"). the southern half of the province was also referred as \"Kwannam\", the northern half of the province was also referred as \"Kwanbuk\". ==History== Korea's northeastern frontier was first organized into the province of Yonggil in 1413. In 1895, the province was replaced by the districts (, , bu) of Kyongsong in the northeast, Kapsan (, ) in the northwest, and Hamh\u016dng in the south. In 1896, Ky\u014fngs\u014fng District was reorganized into North Hamgy\u014fng Province, and Kapsan and Hamh\u016dng Districts were reorganized into South Hamgy\u014fng Province. These divisions continue in present-day North Korea. ==Geography== Hamgy\u014fng was bounded on the west by P'y\u014fngan, on the south by Hwanghae and Kangw\u014fn, on the east by the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), and on the north by China and Russia. ==See also== * Provinces of Korea * Administrative circuit ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * . * . ==External links== * Seoul City history article on Hanseong and 22 other late 19th-century districts (in Korean) Category:Provinces of Korea Category:Joseon dynasty ",
