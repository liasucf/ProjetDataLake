He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen North from 1970 to 1997.Julian Desborough et al. (compilers) (1992). The Times Guide to the House of Commons, April 1992. Times Books Ltd. . Hughes was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from March 1974 until July 1975, when he resigned in disagreement with the government's incomes policy. The infamous 1979 vote of no confidence resulted from the Labour government overturning the \"Yes\" result of the Scottish devolution referendum. Rather than the SNP, prime minister James Callaghan blamed unionist rebels on his own benches for ultimately bringing about the collapse of his government and opening the door to victory for Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives. Hughes was one of those rebels. Tam Dalyell, Peter Doig, and Adam Hunter were the other Scottish Labour MPs who helped overturn the \"Yes\" vote. In November 1985, Hughes was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. On 27 September 1997, he was created a life peer as Baron Hughes of Woodside, of Woodside in the City of Aberdeen.House of Lords biography He is a patron of Humanists UK.Distinguished Supporters of BHA ===Anti-Apartheid Movement=== Under his chairmanship the Anti-Apartheid Movement campaigned against the Thatcher government's refusal to impose sanctions against South Africa in the 1980s and organised the 1988 \u2018Free Mandela\u2019 concert at Wembley Stadium which was televised by the BBC and broadcast around the world. Hughes attended the independence celebrations in Namibia in 1990 and acted as an observer at South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994. After the dissolution of the AAM he became the first Chairperson of its successor organisation, Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA). Hughes's tactics were sometimes critiqued as opportunist by radicals in the movement, such as the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group, examples being his attitude towards the Common Wealth games and censorship of material within the AAM that related to the Non-Stop Picket. In July 1986, the Commonwealth Games was held in Edinburgh. In protest at the Thatcher government's support for apartheid and refusal to implement the sports boycott of South Africa, 32 of the 59 Commonwealth nations boycotted the Games. This could have been an opportunity for the Anti-Apartheid Movement to raise the profile of its boycott campaign. Instead, Hughes and Brian Filling, the Scottish Secretary of the AAM, signed a letter, organised by the Scottish Trade Union Congress and published in The Scotsman newspaper, calling on those Commonwealth nations to call off their boycott. Secondly, at the AAM's annual general meeting in 1986, Hughes and Roberts refused to hear 'motion 16' which resulted in the continued censorship of material relating to an ongoing picket of the South African Embassy in London that would last nearly four years. == References == == External links == * Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:Amalgamated Engineering Union-sponsored MPs Category:People educated at Robert Gordon's College Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Aberdeen constituencies Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Hughes of Woodside Category:Life peers created by Elizabeth II Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:British humanists Category:International opponents of apartheid in South Africa ",
