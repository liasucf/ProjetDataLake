    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1842 and 1843 were elections which had the Whigs lose seats but maintain control of the United States Senate. Although they lost three seats in the regular elections, they gained two of them back by the start of the first session in special elections. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 28th Congress (1843\u20131845) * Majority Party: Whig (27) * Minority Party: Democratic (22\u201323) * Other Parties: (0\u20131) * Total Seats: 52\u201354 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === After July 1842 appointment in New Jersey. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=4 | | | D1 | | D2 | | D3 | | D4 | | D5 | | D6 |- ! width=50px | D16 Ran ! width=50px | D15 Ran ! width=50px | D14 Ran ! width=50px | D13 Ran ! width=50px | D12 Ran ! width=50px | D11 Ran | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 |- ! | D17 Unknown ! | D18 Unknown ! | D19 Retired ! | D20 Retired | | V2 | | V1 ! | W30 Resigned ! | W29 Retired ! | W28 Unknown ! | W27 Unknown |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 ! rowspan=2 | W26 Ran |- | | W17 | | W18 | | W19 | | W20 | | W21 | | W22 | | W23 ! | W24 Ran ! | W25 Ran |- | | W16 | | W15 | | W14 | | W13 | | W12 | | W11 | | W10 | | W9 | | W8 | | W7 |- | colspan=4 | | | W1 | | W2 | | W3 | | W4 | | W5 | | W6 |} === Result of the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=4 | | | D1 | | D2 | | D3 | | D4 | | D5 | | D6 |- ! width=50px | D16 Re-elected ! width=50px | D15 Re-elected ! width=50px | D14 Re-elected ! width=50px | D13 Re-elected ! width=50px | D12 Re-elected ! width=50px | D11 Re-elected | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 |- ! | D17 Re-elected ! | D18 Hold ! | D19 Hold ! | D20 Hold ! | D21 Hold ! | D22 Gain ! | D23 Gain | | V2 | | V1 ! | W27 Hold |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 ! rowspan=2 | W26 Hold |- | | W17 | | W18 | | W19 | | W20 | | W21 | | W22 | | W23 ! | W24 Re-elected ! | W25 Re-elected |- | | W16 | | W15 | | W14 | | W13 | | W12 | | W11 | | W10 | | W9 | | W8 | | W7 |- | colspan=4 | | | W1 | | W2 | | W3 | | W4 | | W5 | | W6 |} === Beginning of the next Congress === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=4 | | | D1 | | D2 | | D3 | | D4 | | D5 | | D6 |- | width=50px | D16 | width=50px | D15 | width=50px | D14 | width=50px | D13 | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 |- | | D17 | | D18 | | D19 | | D20 | | D21 | | D22 ! | V3 D Loss | | V2 | | V1 | | W27 |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | W26 |- | | W17 | | W18 | | W19 | | W20 | | W21 | | W22 | | W23 | | W24 | | W25 |- | | W16 | | W15 | | W14 | | W13 | | W12 | | W11 | | W10 | | W9 | | W8 | | W7 |- | colspan=4 | | | W1 | | W2 | | W3 | | W4 | | W5 | | W6 |} === Beginning of the first session of the next Congress (December 4, 1843) === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=4 | | | D1 | | D2 | | D3 | | D4 | | D5 | | D6 |- | width=50px | D16 | width=50px | D15 | width=50px | D14 | width=50px | D13 | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 |- | | D17 | | D18 | | D19 | | D20 ! | D21 Hold ! | D22 Hold ! | D23 Gain ! | W29 Gain ! | W28 Gain | | W27 |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | W26 |- | | W17 | | W18 | | W19 | | W20 | | W21 | | W22 | | W23 | | W24 | | W25 |- | | W16 | | W15 | | W14 | | W13 | | W12 | | W11 | | W10 | | W9 | | W8 | | W7 |- | colspan=4 | | | W1 | | W2 | | W3 | | W4 | | W5 | | W6 |} {| |- valign=top !

At the State election in November 1842, Democrat William C. Bouck was elected Governor, 92 Democrats and 36 Whigs were elected to the Assembly, and 8 Democrats and 1 Whig were elected to the State Senate. The 66th New York State Legislature met from January 3 to April 18, 1843, at Albany, New York. The incumbent U.S. Senator Silas Wright, Jr. was re- nominated unanimously by a Democratic caucus on the eve of the election. Congressman Millard Fillmore was the candidate of the Whig Party. Silas Wright, Jr., was the choice of both the Assembly and the Senate, and was declared elected. {| class=wikitable ! Candidate ! Party ! Senate (32 members) !

Henry A. Foster was appointed to fill the vacancy temporarily, but the State Legislature elected John A. Dix for the remainder of Wright's term. === Pennsylvania === The election was held January 10, 1843. Future President of the United States James Buchanan was re-elected by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to the United States Senate. The Pennsylvania General Assembly, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, convened on January 10, 1843, to elect a new Senator to fill the term beginning on March 4, 1843. Incumbent Democrat James Buchanan, who was elected in 1834 and re-elected in 1836, was a successful candidate for re-election to another term. The results of the vote of both houses combined are as follows: |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals | align=\"right\" | 132 | align=\"right\" | 100.00% |} === Tennessee === In 1841, Spencer Jarnagin was nominated for U.S. Senator by the Whig caucus in the Tennessee General Assembly. However, some of the Democrats in the legislature decided that no Senator would be preferable to a Whig. Known as the \"Immortal Thirteen\" by Tennessee Democrats, they refused to allow a quorum on the issue. By the time Jarnagin was eventually elected to the seat and sworn in, over two and half years, almost half of the term, had elapsed. Jarnagin finally assumed office on October 17, 1843. ==See also== * United States elections, 1842 ** United States House of Representatives elections, 1842 * 27th United States Congress * 28th United States Congress ==References== * Party Division in the Senate, 1789-Present, via Senate.gov *The New York Civil List compiled in 1858 (see: pg. 63 for U.S. Senators; pg. 134 for State Senators 1843; pg. 227f for Members of Assembly 1843) *Members of the 28th United States Congress *Political History of the State of New York, from Jan. 1, 1841, to Jan. 1, 1847; Vol. III by Jabez Delano Hammond (State election, 1842: pg. 311f; U.S. Senate election, 1843: pg. 349) *Journal of the Assembly (66th Session) (1843; pg. 255f) *Pennsylvania Election Statistics: 1682-2006 from the Wilkes University Election Statistics Project ",
