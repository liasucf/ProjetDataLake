    "text": "The Wind's Fierce (, , also known as Revenge of Trinity, Trinity Sees Red and The Wind's Anger) is a 1970 Spanish-Italian western-drama film written and directed by Mario Camus. ==Plot== Andalusia, the late nineteenth century. Wealthy landowner Don Antonio hires two assassins, Marcos and Jacobo, to infiltrate a group of peasant revolutionaries and kill the leaders. After falling in love with the rebel Soledad, Marcos has a change of heart and decides to unite with the peasants. ==Cast== *Terence Hill as Marcos *Maria Grazia Buccella as Soledad *Mario Pardo as Jacobo *M\u00e1ximo Valverde as Ram\u00f3n *Fernando Rey as Don Antonio * \u00c1ngel Lombarte as Jos\u00e9 *William Layton as Don Lucas *Manuel Alexandre as Agust\u00edn *Manuel de Blas as Rafael ==Reception== Although set in Spain, this film is often classified as a spaghetti-western due to themes, scenes and settings deliberately evocative of the western genre. Terence Hill gives a dramatic performance in his last film before attaining international stardom with They Call Me Trinity. After the success of that movie, The Wind's Fierce was re-released in many countries as a \"Trinity\" sequel and misleadingly marketed as a comedy. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Italian drama films Category:Italian films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish Western (genre) drama films Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:1970s Western (genre) drama films Category:Films directed by Mario Camus ",
