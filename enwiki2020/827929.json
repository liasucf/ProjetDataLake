    "text": "The Cupid was a sculpture created by Renaissance artist Michelangelo, which he artificially aged to make it look like an antique on the advice of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco. It was this sculpture which first brought him to the attention of patrons in Rome. The work is now lost.Entry on \"Cupid,\" The Classical Tradition (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 245; Stefania Macioe, \"Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models,\" in The Rediscovery of Antiquity: The Role of the Artist (Collegium Hyperboreum, 2003), pp. 437\u2013438. ==Sleeping Cupid== Giulio Romano's Young Jupiter in National Gallery, London, possibly contains a citation of Michelangelo's Sleeping Cupid In 1496, Michelangelo made a sleeping cupid figure and treated it with acidic earth to make it seem ancient. He then sold it to a dealer, Baldassare del Milanese, who in turn sold it to Cardinal Riario of San Giorgio who later learned of the fraud and demanded his money back. However, Michelangelo was permitted to keep his share of the money. When Michelangelo offered to take the sculpture back from Baldassarre, the latter refused, saying he would rather destroy it. The Cupid was a significant work in establishing the reputation of the young Michelangelo, who was 21 at the time.Deborah Parker, Michelangelo and the Art of Letter Writing (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 11; Rona Goffen, Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian (Yale University Press, 2002, 2004), p. 95. The sculpture was later donated by Cesare Borgia to Isabella d'Este, and was probably collected by Charles I of England when all the Gonzaga collections were bought and taken to London in the seventeenth century. In 1698, the Cupid was probably destroyed in the great fire in the Palace of Whitehall, London. ==Standing Cupid== Another sculpture of Cupid, in a standing position, was created for Riario's banker, Jacopo Galli.Umberto Baldini, Michelangelo scultore, Rizzoli, Milano 1973, pp. 90-91. ==References== Category:Sculptures by Michelangelo Category:Lost sculptures Category:Art forgeries Category:1496 sculptures Category:Sculptures of Cupid category:Gonzaga art collection ",
