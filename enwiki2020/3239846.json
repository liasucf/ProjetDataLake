    "text": "The 1967\u201368 European Cup was the 13th European Cup, UEFA's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Manchester United, who beat Benfica 4\u20131 in the final at Wembley Stadium, London. The European Cup title marked the tenth year since the Munich air disaster, in which eight United players were killed and their manager, Matt Busby, was left close to death, the day after earning a place in the semi-finals of the 1957\u201358 competition. It was also the first time an English side had won the trophy. The away goals rule (which had already been used in the Cup Winners' Cup and the Fairs' Cup) was introduced if aggregate scores were level after two legs, but only for the first round of the competition. Extra time goals were not included in the rule. Celtic, the defending champions, were eliminated by Dynamo Kyiv in the first round. ==Bracket== ==First round== |} ===First leg=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Second leg=== Sarajevo won 5\u20133 on aggregate. \\---- Manchester United won 4\u20130 on aggregate. \\---- Dynamo Kyiv won 3\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- G\u00f3rnik Zabrze won 4\u20130 on aggregate. \\---- Hvidovre won 5\u20134 on aggregate. \\---- Real Madrid won 3\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- Sparta Prague won 2\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Anderlecht won 5\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- Vasas won 9\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Valur 4\u20134 Jeunesse Esch on aggregate.
