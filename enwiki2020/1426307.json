    "text": "Kemptville Campus is a campus of the Ontario Agricultural College, University of Guelph, and is located in Eastern Ontario, approximately 30 minutes south of Ottawa in Kemptville, Ontario. ==Programs== It was established in 1917 as Kemptville College and offers programs related to agricultural and rural fields. In 1997 it affiliated with the Ontario Agricultural College at the University of Guelph and in 2007 the institution adopted its current name as a recognition of its integration into the university. In 2014, the University of Guelph announced that academic programmes at the Alfred and Kemptville campuses would close, once current students had completed their studies. This decision does not directly relate to separately-funded trades progreammes. Efforts are underway to save the two campuses, with reports on Kemptville and on Alfred, along with initiatives with two francophone colleges, Bor\u00e9al and La Cit\u00e9 to maintain the French-language offerings at Alfred. ==Academics== *Junior Agriculture Diploma Diesel Equipment Mechanic *Senior Agriculture Diploma (new) Industrial Welding & Fabrication *Junior Agriculture, Equine Option Coop_Agriculture & Heavy Duty Diesel Equipment Mechanic (Jr) *Senior Agriculture, Equine Option Coop_Agriculture & Heavy Duty Diesel Equipment Mechanic (Sr) *Junior Horticulture Diploma + Coop Equine Management Certificate *Senior Horticulture Diploma + Coop Graduation Requirements *Senior Food, Nutrition & Risk Management *Degrees **Bachelor of Bio-Resource Management (BBRM), Equine Management **Associate Diplomas in Agriculture; Agriculture, Equine Option; Food, Nutrition & Risk Management; Horticulture **Co-op Apprenticeship Diploma in Agricultural & Heavy Equipment; Horticultural Technician *Apprenticeships **Co-op Apprenticeship Diploma in Agricultural & Heavy Equipment; Dairy Herdsperson; Horticultural Technician; Certificates Coaching & Horsemanship; Diesel Equipment Mechanic; Equine Management; Food Service Worker; Health Care Food Service; Industrial Welding & Fabrication; Oil & Gas Technology; Riding Certificate *Workshops/Short Courses/Seminars **For School & Preschool Ages; In Equine; In Food, Nutrition & Wellness ==References== ==External links== *official website *Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada profile *Kemtville Campus Alumni website Category:Educational institutions established in 1917 ",
