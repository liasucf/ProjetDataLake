    "text": "\u0160obes (or \u0160obes hill) is a well known vineyard location (vineyard track) in the Czech Republic A vineyard track () is a term used in the legislature of the Czech Republic, meaning a site suitable for vineyards growing. == Definition == By definition of the law no. 321/2004 Z\u00e1kon \u010d. 321/2004 Sb. o vinohradnictv\u00ed a vina\u0159stv\u00ed (Czech) of the Czech Republic, a vineyard track is an agricultural estate, part of an estate, set of estates, ensemble of an estate and a part of an estate or combination of estates, or parts of estate(s), representing a coherent complex/set within one vine-growing region (or sub-region), that is suitable for growing of vine due to its geographical location, incline, length of insolation and soil-climatical properties. == The term == The term \"tra\u0165\" in the winemaking industry (that is a synonym for the English word \"track\"), primarily used in Czech language as a term for a \"railroad track\", does not have anything to do with railway transportation at all, except for its default meaning. === Default meaning === :The originating meaning \"railway track\" (with a common meaning in Czech language: a railroad section (a sub-set of rails) of the entire railway system specified in the timetable/schedule, having its own ID number, usually belonging to a specifically delimited (coherent) area, typically between a major railway junction where the track starts and a city/village, where the track ends in the last station/terminal, or a track interconnecting two major junctions to cover the settlements in between) is being used in the very same way for the description of a sub-set of vineyards. === Origin === :In Czech countries, this usage of the word owes its origin most probably to the fact, that the most typical vine-training in Czech Republic is being aided by using trellising, visually resembling (railway) \"tracks\" that belong together (form a coherent complex). == Other countries == *German language - Germany: the most equivalent term is \"Einzellage\". *German language - Austria: The term is \"Riede\". *English/French: the most equivalent term is \"Terroir\", which however might have much broader meaning, not matching the originating definition. == References == Category:Agriculture in the Czech Republic Category:Czech law Category:Viticulture ",
