    "text": "17 missile tests were conducted by North Korea throughout 2017. These tests ranged in success, and included first tests of the DPRK's new missile, the Hwasong-12, which was the most-tested missile type over the course of the year. 2017's missile tests are especially notable due to the several instances of North Korean missiles passing over Japan, provoking a response from the Japanese government, as well as the test of an ICBM, the range of which prompted an Emergency Debate of the UN Security Council. == April == On April 4, 2017, North Korea launched a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile which reached the Sea of Japan. The test came after a day of celebration for North Korea's Eternal President Kim Il-sung. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson responded by saying the United States had not changed its stance on North Korea and would not comment further. On April 15, 2017, a Hwasong-12 missile was launched and failed almost immediately, according to the United States Military and the South Korean Armed Forces. The US National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, said \"all options are on the table\" as possible reactions. On April 28, 2017, another Hwasong-12 missile was launched from Bukchang in the South Pyeongan province, and failed shortly after liftoff. The missile hit the ground in an industrial area around near the city of Tokchon, causing damage to multiple buildings. This launch occurred only hours after a meeting of the UN Security Council condemned North Korean missile and nuclear testing activities again. US President Donald Trump called this action disrespectful to China. == May == On May 14, 2017, a ballistic missile test was carried out. The Hwasong-12 missile flew for 30 minutes, covering a distance of and reaching an altitude upwards of . == June == On June 8, 2017 North Korea fired four anti-ship missiles off its east coast, near the port city of Wonsan. == July == On July 4, 2017 North Korea tested an ICBM. The missile flew for approximately 40 minutes, falling away from the launch site in the Sea of Japan. The missile, named the Hwasong-14, reached an altitude of . It is estimated that the missile has the capability of reaching on a standard trajectory, meaning that although it would not be capable of reaching the Contiguous United States, it would be able to hit anywhere in Alaska. The test prompted an Emergency Debate of the United Nations Security Council. On July 28, 2017, North Korea launched an additional ballistic missile from Chagang Province, reaching an altitude of 3,000 ft ending up in the Sea of Japan narrowly missing an Air France Flight from Tokyo to Paris. km (1,865 mi). Jeffrey Lewis, researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, estimated that the missile could have a range of approximately 10,000 km based on its 45-minute flight time. With this range, the missile could potentially reach major U.S. cities such as Denver and Chicago. This is the fourteenth missile test conducted by North Korea in the year 2017. As with the missile launched on July 4, this missile has also been estimated to be of type Hwasong-14. == August == On August 26, 2017, three short-range missiles were launched around early morning from a site in Gangwon Province, with the second one appearing to have blown up almost immediately while another two flew about 250 km (155 miles) in a north-eastern direction, before crashing in the Sea of Japan. === Mid-range launch over Japan === On August 29, 2017, at 5:57 am KST, North Korea launched a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile that passed over Hokkaido, the second largest island of Japan. The missile travelled and reached a maximum height of . This was the second successful test flight of the Hwasong-12 missile, following three failed tests. Japanese citizens living beneath the missile\u2019s flight path received a J-Alert message on their cellphones at 6:02 a.m., just four minutes after the projectile was launched, rousing some from sleep. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called this test \"a reckless act of launching a missile that flies over our country is an unprecedented, serious and important threat.\" North Korea had previously carefully avoided sending test missiles over Japan by using highly lofted trajectories, and had sent more recent satellite launches to the south avoiding Japan. The missile was at an altitude of about over Japan, well into space, and the Japanese military did not attempt to shoot down the missile. The missile was launched from Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, presumably using a mobile launcher. It reportedly broke into three parts before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean; it is unclear if this was intentional. Given North Korea's geographical position, for a non-lofted test flight at this range there was no other practical alternative to passing over Japan. This was the fifth time North Korea fired a rocket over the Japanese archipelago, although this launch was the first missile launch, as the previous four were satellite launches or attempts. == September == On September 15 at about 6:30am KST, North Korea fired a Hwasong-12 missile from the Pyongyang International Airport, which, for a second time, overflew Hokkaido, Japan. The missile traveled and reached a maximum height of ; this is the furthest distance any North Korean IRBM missile has ever reached. North Korean rockets flown over the Japanese archipelago == November == On November 28, North Korea launched another ballistic missile, a Hwasong-15, the first in over two months. The missile was said to have reached an altitude of 4,500 km and landed near Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone.http://reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1DS2MB According to Yonhap News, Korean Air flights KE026 and KE012 witnessed lights presumably from separated portions of the missile. == See also == * 2017 North Korean crisis * 2017 in North Korea * Korean conflict * Korean reunification == References == Category:2017 in military history Category:2017 in Japan Category:2017 in North Korea Category:Guided missiles of North Korea Category:Nuclear program of North Korea Category:Intercontinental ballistic missiles of North Korea ",
