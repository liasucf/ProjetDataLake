The A-League Young Footballer of the Year is an annual soccer award given to the player aged 23 or under at the start of the season who is adjudged to have been the best of the season in the A-League. It is currently called the NAB Young Footballer of the Year for sponsorship purposes. The award has been presented since the 2005\u201306 season and the winner is chosen by a panel of experts and media representatives. In 2014, the age for eligibility was lifted from 21 to 23. The first winner of the award was Perth Glory midfielder Nick Ward. The current holder is Riley McGree. As of 2017, Mathew Ryan and Jamie Maclaren are the only players to have won the award on more than one occasion. Marco Rojas is the only non-Australian winner of the trophy. Players aged 23 or under at the start of the season remain eligible to win the Johnny Warren Medal, and in 2013 Rojas won both awards. Since 2009, one player has been awarded a nomination for the award each month of the season, with the eventual winner then selected from the nominees. ==Winners== Adrian Leijer was the second-ever recipient of the award. The award has been presented on 14 occasions as of 2019, with 12 different winners. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+Key !scope=\"row\"|Player |Name of the player and number of times they had won the award at that point (if more than one) |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#ffb\"|\u00a7 |Denotes the club were A-League premiers in the same season |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+A-League Young Footballer of the Year winners !scope=\"col\"|Season !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Nationality !scope=\"col\"|Club !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s) |- |2005\u201306 || || || Perth Glory || |- |2006\u201307 || || || style=\"background:#ffb\"|Melbourne Victory || |- |2007\u201308 || || || Adelaide United || |- |2008\u201309 || || || Adelaide United || |- |2009\u201310 || || || Brisbane Roar || |- |2010\u201311 || || || Central Coast Mariners || |- |2011\u201312 || || || style=\"background:#ffb\"|Central Coast Mariners || |- |2012\u201313 || || || Melbourne Victory || |- |2013\u201314 || || || Newcastle Jets || |- |2014\u201315 || || || Adelaide United || |- |2015\u201316 || || || Brisbane Roar || |- |2016\u201317 || || || Brisbane Roar || |- |2017\u201318 || || || Melbourne City || |- |2018\u201319 || || || style=\"background:#ffb\"|Perth Glory || |- |2019\u201320 || || || Adelaide United || |} ==Breakdown of winners== ===By nationality=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Country !scope=\"col\"|Total |- !scope=\"row\"| |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"| |align=\"center\"| |} ===By club=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Club !scope=\"col\"|Total |- !scope=\"row\"|Adelaide United |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"|Brisbane Roar |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"|Central Coast Mariners |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"|Melbourne Victory |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"|Perth Glory |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"|Melbourne City |align=\"center\"| |- !scope=\"row\"|Newcastle Jets |align=\"center\"| |} ==See also== *Johnny Warren Medal *A-League Golden Boot ==References== Category:Australian soccer trophies and awards Category:A-League Category:Rookie player awards ",
