He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and was rated as a Flying Officer while still a lieutenant, on 22 December 1917. He was stationed in Salonika, Greece with B Flight of 47 Squadron as a pilot of Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5as. On 13 April 1918, he and fellow Canadian Gerald Gordon Bell destroyed an enemy Albatros D.III. When 47 Squadron's fighter flights were incorporated into forming the newly 150 Squadron, Green went with them. On 6 May, he began a string of ten triumphs with his new squadron by driving down a DFW reconnaissance foe. He would accrue victories one or two at a time until 18 July 1918. By then, he had destroyed six enemy planes, including the one shared with Bell and another shared with Acheson Goulding. He had also driven down five other opponents out of control. ==Post World War I== Green was finally awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross on 1 January 1919. After his return to Toronto, he married Marion Wilton Baillie, age 22, on 9 June 1923. They would have three children: Bremner, Donald, and Elizabeth. He began work as a broker for Amelius Jarvis and Company, and would continue with this company until 1939.
