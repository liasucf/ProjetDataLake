    "text": "The Canon PowerShot TX1 is a Canon digital camera. It was released on February 22, 2007 The TX1 is a hybrid device designed for both still imagery and video recording. It offers both HDTV (1280\u00d7720 pixel, 30 frame/s) movie capture, as well as 10\u00d7 stabilized zoom and 7.1 megapixel sensor. It is designed to improve upon hybrid offerings by competitors such as the Sony Cyber-shot M1, Sony Cyber-shot M2, and Pentax MX4. It is oriented vertically and uses the camcorder-like swivel LCD viewing screen. Canon compares the hybrid camera's size to that of the Canon ELPH series of cameras. The company distinguishes the camera for its optical image stabilizer technology, DIGIC III image processor, face detection technology and red-eye effect correction with a mention of its built-in lens cover and scratch-resistant, anti-reflective LCD screen. == Reviews == On its release it was termed the most expensive ultra zoom (10\u201312\u00d7) camera on the market. It is relatively small ( \u00d7 \u00d7 ) and as a hybrid camera it includes a combination of features that was a fairly revolutionary for digital photography at the time of release. Although most digital cameras now offer both still image and video capabilities, few offer advanced levels of both such as ultra zoom and HDTV. This was Canon's first attempt at such a hybrid. The combination has not been highly regarded by reviewers and editors, but users were highly satisfied with the combination. Due to its weak sales, there was no successor model. == Headline features == The following are the most important features: * Vertical design * 1/2.5-inch 7.1 million pixel CCD * Vari-angle LCD monitor (1.8-inch) * 10\u00d7 optical (39\u2013390 mm equiv.) zoom lens \u2014 12 elements (one UD and one aspheric element) * Optical image stabilization * ISO 80\u20131600 * DIGIC III and face detection * 720p (1280\u00d7720) movies at 30 frame/s with stereo sound * 1080i component video output * Flexible movie/still shooting.
