It enrolled day students from the local area, along with a substantial body of regional, national, and international students from around the world who boarded at the school. The last President of its governing board (the AUCC) was Claude Le Vu; the last director was Patrick Sellier. The Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol was founded in 1938 by local Protestant activists and pacifists, and had been shaped from its beginnings by the area's long-standing traditions of resistance to political and religious oppression. From the beginning, the Coll\u00e8ge promoted education linked to principles of nonviolence and the development of mutual understanding and solidarity in a socially and ethnically diverse society. The school's founders were also key organizers of the now-famous community effort, in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, to shelter and save Jewish refugees during the Second World War. Thus an important part of the school's early development was linked to this much discussed episode. During its early years, from 1938 to 1971, the school was entirely private, and was associated with the Protestant Reformed Church of France, although it welcomed students regardless of their religious or non-religious orientation. From 1971 on, it was part of the French national education system and was secular. It was organized as an \u201c\u00e9tablissement priv\u00e9 sous contrat d'association\u201d (a private school associated by contract with the state), a category of French schools that are privately managed, but bound to the national system by contracts which provide basic funding and teacher's salaries, and require adherence to national curricula and other standards. On February 9, 2014, President Andre Gast announced that the College would be closing its doors at the end of the school year, faced with mounting financial difficulties and declining enrollment. ==Founding as L\u2019Ecole Nouvelle C\u00e9venole == \u201cC\u00e9venol\u201d is an adjective meaning \"of the C\u00e9vennes mountains,\" a nearby mountain range that is historically significant as a site of resistance for French Protestants. Chambon and the Coll\u00e8ge are not located in the C\u00e9vennes themselves, but just to the north, on the high Plateau Vivarais-Lignon. The \"C\u00e9venol\" reference in the school's name is thus cultural and historical rather than literal, situating the school's founding within the long heritage of French Protestant (Huguenot) resistance to persecution after the Reformation, for example during the Camisard wars of the early eighteenth century. The peasant fighters called \u201cCamisards\u201d who struggled against the French crown were also known as \u201cC\u00e9venols\u201d after the rugged, mountainous terrain that facilitated the small group's ability to resist the much larger forces arrayed against them. In the 1930s, this long-standing regional tradition of resistance and hospitality to refugees became essential to the school's beginnings. In May 1938, at a regional synod of the French \u00e9glise r\u00e9form\u00e9e (the Reformed Church of France, historically the primary Protestant council in France), pastor Andr\u00e9 Trocm\u00e9, then assigned to the Protestant church in Chambon, proposed the creation of a new secondary school. His proposal envisioned a school that would address four goals: # work against the rural depopulation and impoverishment of Chambon, then a small farming village in an isolated mountain region; # provide high- quality secondary education for the children of the area's Protestant parishes; # experiment with innovative educational ideas and practices that might eventually spread to the wider public school system; and # provide a milieu in which teachers and students of different nationalities could meet and develop values related to internationalist ideals of cooperation and peace. Working with Edouard Theis, another local pastor, the school's first classes were held in September 1938. On its first day, the school had four teachers and 18 students, and met in a room in the Protestant \u201cTemple\u201d or church of Chambon. ==Shelter for refugees during World War II== Because of its relatively remote and protected location in Chambon, and because it was founded by the same pastors who became the leaders of local efforts to save refugees from Nazi occupation forces and the French Vichy regime that collaborated with them, the C\u00e9venol school played an integral role in the now- famous efforts of the local citizenry in hiding and protecting several thousand Jewish refugees, including many children, throughout the war. By the late 1930s, Chambon had become the site of several \u201cpensions\u201d or boarding- houses that lodged children drawn from refugee camps in the south of France for victims of the Spanish Civil War. The first pension, organized by Trocm\u00e9, was Les Grillons (Crickets), followed by several more, mostly funded by major international relief organizations. More refugees from the German occupation soon followed, including many Jewish children who were lodged and hidden among the others. During the course of the war, Chambon's remote location made it attractive for other children from more war-torn areas of France as well, and the student body (including Jewish children being hidden in Chambon) grew rapidly, from 40 students in 1939 to 150 in 1940, 250 in 1941, 300 in 1942, and 350 to the end of the war. In this situation, Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9, along with Edouard and Mildred Theis served as both teachers at the C\u00e9venol school and leaders of the town's collective effort to protect the refugees. In recognition of their courage and leadership, they, along with Roland Leenhardt (a future director of the school who was then a pastor in the neighboring village of Tence) and the people of Chambon, were later honored as \u201cRighteous among the Nations\u201d (sometimes translated as \u201cRighteous Gentiles\u201d), a secular award given by the State of Israel to distinguish non-Jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis. Chambon was, in fact, the first community to be recognized in this manner by Yad Vashem. ==Second phase: building the Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol== At the end of the war in 1945, a Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol Association (now the AUCC or Association Unifi\u00e9e du Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol) was founded. In 1952 Carl and Florence Sangree, two Americans then associated with the school, founded the AFCC, The American Friends of the Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol. A 16-hectare farm at the edge of Chambon was acquired as the site for a new campus. The American Association helped raise funds (from the Quaker American Friends Service Committee, among others) and organized work-camps at which the school's teachers and students, along with other volunteers, passed the summers living in large tents while they built the present school with their own hands, from clearing roads and digging trenches for pipes, to building a classroom building, dormitories, and fields for sports. For decades, the original stone farmhouse, called Luquet, housed a makeshift gym, library, refectory, and offices; the refectory is still housed there today. The first dormitories were prefabricated wooden chalets donated by friends of the school in Sweden. The \u201cBatisco\u201d or Batiment Scolaire (the main classroom building used today) was opened in 1953; the science labs in 1957; and a new, relatively comfortable girl's dormitory (Milflor) in 1959. In its first decades especially, the Coll\u00e8ge developed a collective culture distinct from that of other secondary schools. It was a co-educational school from the beginning; male and female students were mixed together in a manner that was relatively rare in French schools, and especially in French boarding schools. The school was open in both a material and an educational sense: it had no walls or gates, and students were encouraged and expected to govern themselves to a significant extent. The school's pacifist and activist origins, its summer work-camps, remote location, and somewhat spartan living conditions for boarding students, encouraged a situation in which teachers and students lived, ate, and worked together in the same modest setting, relatively isolated from the aggressively consumerist and mediatic culture of the early cold war. Through the 1960s, students and teachers together developed a community that, within the limits imposed by the school's Protestant orientation, emphasized tolerance and independence vis-\u00e0-vis dominant ways of thinking. Activities that were relatively rare for the period, such as a student-run assembly, radio station, and magazine, were initiated during these years. Notable teachers during this early period included the philosopher Paul Ricoeur and the writer and nonviolence activist Lanza del Vasto, one of the principle western followers of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Notable students from the early years include Alexander Grothendieck, one of the key mathematicians of the twentieth century and a dedicated anti- war activist who had escaped the camps as a child refugee in Chambon during the war, and Delphine Seyrig, an actress and activist now remembered for her roles in a series of important films in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Third and fourth phases: the Coll\u00e8ge-Lyc\u00e9e C\u00e9venol== After 1971 the school became part of the French national education system and its culture gradually changed as the generation of organizers and activists formed during the extraordinary conditions of World War II resistance culture faded away. Primarily because it has never charged high tuition and has never aimed to become an exclusive school for the wealthy, C\u00e9venol has never been financially independent and relies on state funding to survive. After growing to an enrollment of about 500 during the 1980s and 1990s, the school encountered financial difficulties and its enrollment returned to around 300 after 1997. Since that time, the school has gradually improved its funding and seeks to renew its unique history and culture in the conditions of the 21st century. The recent actualities have been marked by the murder of Agn\u00e8s Marin by Matthieu Moulinas, both being pupils here. In its last terms the Coll\u00e8ge enrolled students from about 30 different nations each year, working in classes from the Quatri\u00e8me (the equivalent of 9th grade in the US) to Terminale (the 13th and final or \"terminal\" year in the French primary-secondary system, during which students prepare for the Baccalaur\u00e9at examination). It continued to play a role in the local hosting and relief of refugees from conflicts in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The school maintained partnerships and exchange agreements with several other secondary schools oriented toward international education: * Concord Academy (Massachusetts, US) * Colegio Internacional Europa (Sevilla, Spain) * Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum (Gera (Germany) * Liceo Valdese de Torre Pellice (Italy, a school associated with UNESCO) * Lyc\u00e9e Edmond-Maurice-Edmond de Rothschild de Tel Aviv (Israel) * Soukrom\u00e9 Jazykov\u00e9 Gymn\u00e1zium in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 (Czech Republic) ==Governing Board (AUCC) and school associations== The school's governing board was the Association Unifi\u00e9e du Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol (AUCC). Its meetings assemble representatives of alumni organizations and several French and international Protestant relief organizations. An Association des Anciens du Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol (AACC) now provides organization for meetings and fundraising among alumni in France and Europe, beginning with a 70th Anniversary weekend held in Chambon in May 2009. The APCC (Association des Parents du CC) provided information and networking for parents of enrolled students. ==American Friends of the Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol (AFCC)== The American Friends, a non-profit organization founded in 1952, unites alumni and friends of the Coll\u00e8ge from all of the phases of the school's history. It contributed to the school by organizing an annual fundraising drive among the school's US alumni and by continuing the tradition of the summer work camps that went back to the school's earliest years. The work camps were three-week summer sessions organized for high school and college-age students who experienced the atmosphere of Chambon and the Coll\u00e8ge during the very pleasant summer season in the mountains, worked at community service projects and basic maintenance or repair tasks at the school, and improved their French-language skills. ==Notable alumni and faculty== The French Wikipedia article on the Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol provides French-language links to articles on many of these individuals: * Kate Barry (1967\u20132013); photographer * Guy Bechtel (1931\u2013); historian, author of numerous studies in French early-modern history and culture * Pierre B\u00e9nichou (1938\u2013); journalist and writer, member of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur * Robert Beno\u00eet (1943\u2013); actor- director known for work in films, television, and theatre; appeared alongside fellow C\u00e9venol alum Delphine Seyrig in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) * Christophe Berthonneau (1964\u2013); theatre director, award-winning pyro- designer and founder of Group F, creator of major fireworks performances including opening and closing ceremonies of numerous Olympic Games during the 1990s and 2000s * Michael Bess, Department of History, Vanderbilt University, author of \"Choices under fire.
