The couple had three children, William Craig, Sabrina Maria, and Albert Leander (who started his own art and journalism career). She continued her art after marriage and children. She died in 2000 and her husband passed away shortly thereafter. Her daughter wrote an article outlining the impact of her work and the impact on her community and the state of Pennsylvania. After her death, her husband, impacted family and Brandywine created a sponsorship for Latina artists striving for residency. This scholarship is called the Joyce de Guatemala Scholarship Fund. It is meant to achieve Bush Vourvoulias's dream of reaching out to those who have few opportunities to advance their art careers. It offers the opportunity to apply for a sponsored residency, in hopes that they will explore public service following Bush Vourvoulias. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Date of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:Artists from Mexico City Category:Writers from Mexico City Category:Mexican women sculptors Category:20th-century Mexican women writers Category:20th-century Mexican women artists Category:Deaths from intracranial aneurysm ",
