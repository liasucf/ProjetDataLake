After the first episode, Hunziker was caught in the crossfire. The Swiss newspaper Blick even wrote: \"Cinderella, TV3's new lifestyle show is not bad. It is catastrophic\". Later, Hunziker was interviewed by the Swiss-German magazine Schweizer Illustrierte and she said that she could not speak German anymore after having lived in Italy for many years.
