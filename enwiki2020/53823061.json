    "text": "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Alonso Fernandez (born 22 December, 1958) is a full professor of Biopharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology at the University of Santiago de Compostela. The laboratory she leads is specialized in Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology and Nanomedicine, and her research is oriented to the development of nanostructures for targeted delivery of drugs and vaccines. Her discoveries have led to significant clinical advances in the development of potential new treatments for cancer, ocular diseases, skin diseases, diabetes, obesity and other autoimmune pathologies, as well as new vaccines. == Profesional experience and scientific career == Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Alonso has a Master degree in Pharmacy (University of Santiago de Compostela - USC, 1985) and a Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Technology (USC, 1985). She has also developed her research career at the University of Paris XI and at the University of Angers (France), as well as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 2006-2010 she held the responsibility of Vicerrector of Research and Innovation at the University of Santiago de Compostela. In this role she created a network of research institutes that contributed to the recognition of \u201cCampus of Excellence\u201d by the Ministry of Sciences and Innovation. She is a member of the National Academy of Medicine (U.S.), and of three academies in Spain (Real Academia Nacional de Farmacia, Real Academia de Farmacia de Galicia and Real Academia Galega de Ciencias). Alonso has held responsibilities in several scientific societies, among them the Controlled Release Society (CRS). She first contributed to the CRS as the Founder of the Spanish-Portuguese Local Chapter (1994), and later she was Gobernor, Director- at-Large, Secretary and President of this Society. Moreover, she is part of the editorial board of 11 scientific journals, and Editor-in-Chief of the Drug Delivery and Translational Research. She has coordinated and participated in several research consortia financed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Commission. She is the most influential researcher in Spain in the area of Pharmacology and Pharmacy (h-index), and is also classified among the top ten researchers in her field worldwide (Times Higher Education Ranking). == Drug Delivery Research == Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Alonso\u2019s Lab is focused on designing novel nanostructured materials intended to transport drugs and antigens across biological barriers (such as cellular, ocular, nasal, skin and intestinal barriers) and deliver them to the target tissue. Alonso\u2019s research is specialized in the association of biological compounds, including drugs and antigens to these nanovehicles, with the final goal of producing innovative nanomedicines and vaccines. == Awards and recognitions == * 1985: Extraordinary Ph.D. award for the best Ph.D. of the Faculty of Pharmacy, USC. * 1982: Eloy D\u00edez Award granted by the Eloy D\u00edez Foundation to the best PhD of the year. * 2010: Member of the Galician Academy of Pharmacy (Spain) * 2010: Member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Pharmacy (Spain) * 2011: \u201cNovoa Santos\u201d Award * 2011: \u201cKing Jaume I\u201d Award on New Technologies * 2012: Medal of the General Council of Pharmacy * 2013: \u201cWomen in Sciences\u201d Award granted by Xunta de Galicia * 2014: \u201cMaurice Marie Janot Award\u201d granted by the European Pharmaceutical Society (APGI) * 2014: Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Galicia (Spain) * 2016: Member of the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) (U.S.) * 2017: Member of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering\u2019s College of Fellows (AIMBE) (U.S.) * 2018: \"Castelao Medal\", awarded by Xunta de Galicia *2018: Member of the College of Fellows of the Controlled Release Society (CRS,Inc) *2018: \u201cCRS Founders Award\u201d, granted by the Controlled Release Society *2020: \u201cThe Power List\u201d of the 20 most influential researchers in biopharmaceuticals, published by The Medicine Maker https://themedicinemaker.com/power-list/2020 *2020: \"Distinguished Service Award\", granted by the Controlled Release Society, Inc.
