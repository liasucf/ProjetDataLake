The synagogue was constructed from 1891 to 1893 on the site of an earlier wooden synagogue which had been built around 1820. During the German occupation of Poland in the Second World War, it was partially destroyed. From 1945 to 1968, it was the seat of various Bia\u0142ystok Jewish organisations, such as the Socio-cultural Association of Jews in Poland. From 1968, the building was no longer used for specifically Jewish purposes, instead being used as a cinema and a theatre. Renovation work in the 1970s removed the distinctive features that marked it as a synagogue and it burnt down in 1989. In 1995, the structure was renovated. It is currently the headquarters of the Ludwik Zamenhof Foundation, which sells text-books and literature on Esperanto and offers Esperanto language courses. ==References== == External links == * Description of the Synagogue on Virtual Shtetl Category:Former synagogues in Poland Category:Objects of cultural heritage in Poland Category:Buildings and structures in Bia\u0142ystok Category:Synagogues completed in 1893 Category:Esperanto organizations ",
