The album received a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album and two Lo Nuestro Awards for Tropical Album of the Year and Tropical Group of the Year. Seven singles were released from the record, three of which became top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard Tropical Albums. It remained the top-selling album on the chart for 24 weeks and was certified platinum (Latin field) in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Spain, the album spent eight weeks at the number one position on the chart. In the Netherlands, the record peaked at number two on the Mega Album Top 100 and was certified gold. Bachata Rosa was praised by critics, who commended Guerra's songwriting and the record's production, citing it as one of his most important works. ==Background== At the time, bachata was defined as music from the rural areas of the Dominican Republic with lyrics considered too crude and vulgar to the public's taste. It was characterized by an acoustic guitar accompanied with bongo drums and maracas. After releasing the album Ojal\u00e1 Que Llueva Caf\u00e9, Juan Luis Guerra began experimenting with the genre by performing bachata alongside Dominican artist Sonia Silvestre on her album Quiero Andar. The result was an early demo of \"Como Abeja al Panal\" (\"Like a Bee to the Hive\"). Silvestre said that Guerra was dismayed when he learned that Silvestre's album Quiero Andar was in bachata; he did not become fully committed to the genre until after \"Como abeja al panal\" was released as a single where it was a hit in the United States. The song was first released for a Barcel\u00f3 TV commercial. After \"Como Abeja al Panal\" was released as a single and achieved success, Guerra continued working on bachata music, which served as a key element in Bachata Rosa. Silvestre explained the name of the title by saying that \"[Guerra's] bachatas were rosa [rosy] while mine was red\". Guerra's bachata focused on the language of the lower-class and used synthesizers for his production whereas Silvestre's bachata relied on a synthesized accordion for her music. Recording took place in the 4-40 studio in New York City, Guerra's personal studio. The album was released by Karen Records. ==Musical style, writing and composition== The album consists of ten tracks, including four bachata songs. The album starts with the opening track \"Rosalia\", an upbeat merengue song. \"Como Abeja al Panal\" begins as a bachata tune and switches to salsa music in the middle of the song, falling back to bachata toward the end. \"Carta de Amor\" is a salsa track in which he writes a letter to his lover in his journal, punctuation marks included. \"Estrellitas y Duendes\" (\"Little Stars and Elves\") is a bachata about living in his love's memories as a rain-shower of little stars and elves. \"A Pedir su Mano\" (\"Asking for Her Hand\") is a cover of Lea Lignanzy's song \"D\u00e9d\u00e9 Priscilla\" from the Central African Republic which combines merengue and Afropop. \"La Bilirrubina\" (\"The Bilirubin\") is a merengue song that describes a man in a hospital suffering from a high level of bilirubin from love and jealousy, which can only be cured by kisses, as no shots nor surgery are effective. \"Burbujas de Amor\" (\"Bubbles of Love\") is a sexual bachata song about a man's desire to become a fish and \"make bubbles of love\" in his lover's fishbowl. The lyrics for the song \"Bachata Rosa\" were inspired by the opening lines of the poem \"Book of Questions\" by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. The last track \"Acomp\u00e1\u00f1eme Civil\" is a merengue song performed by Beny Peregina which deals with social awareness. ==Commercial reception== ===Album=== In the United States, Bachata Rosa debuted at number one on the Billboard Tropical Albums on the week of January 12, 1991.
