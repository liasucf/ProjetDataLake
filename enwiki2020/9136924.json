It was completed in 1998 and has over 500 stores in approximately 3 million square-feet (250,000 square metres). The mall has five levels: Autopista, Libertador, Acuario, Feria, and Diversi\u00f3n. There are other Sambil malls located in Valencia, Margarita, Maracaibo, San Crist\u00f3bal, Barquisimeto, Paraguan\u00e1, Santo Domingo, Cura\u00e7ao and Madrid. The mall is owned by Constructora Sambil, run and owned by the Salomon Cohen Levy family. Alfredo Cohen is the director. A second mall was planned for Caracas under the name \"Centro Sambil La Candelaria.\" However, in December 2010, just before the building was inaugurated, the Venezuelan government, under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, confiscated the building without compensation while citing concerns with congestion. As of October 2019, the building remained unfinished, dismantled and unoccupied. == See also == * Sambil Paraguan\u00e1 ==References== ==External links== *Centro Sambil Caracas Official website Category:Buildings and structures in Caracas Category:Shopping malls in Venezuela Category:Tourist attractions in Caracas ",
