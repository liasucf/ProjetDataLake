As a painter, he specialized in historical, mythological and literary subjects. He was also a translator. ==Life== Master Roger Mainwaring by Thomson, ca. 1810 Born in Portsea, Portsmouth, Thomson was the son of a naval purser who encouraged his son's interest in art and took him to Paris in 1787. They returned to England two years later, as a result of the French Revolution. From 1791 to 1792, Thomson attended the Royal Academy Schools. He then continued to train under John Opie, before travelling again in Europe with his father. They were in Italy between 1793 and 1798, then in Austria and Germany in 1799. After his return to England later that year, Thomson's artistic career made speedy progress. In the Royal Academy exhibition of 1800 he exhibited paintings of classical subjects. The following year he was elected an associate member of the Academy and in 1804 an Academician.Henry Thomson, RA (1773-1843) at bergercollection.orgA-Z&person;=5928 Henry Thomson, R.A. at racollection.org.ukJames Northcote & James Ward, ed.

In 1825 he was appointed Keeper of the Academy, but two years afterwards his health broke down ; he resigned office and retired to Portsea, where he died sixteen years later.\" Although primarily a historical painter, like most of the artists of his time Thomson relied heavily on income from illustrating books.

He never recovered and took on no further significant work, retiring to Portsea and dying there on 6 April 1843.
