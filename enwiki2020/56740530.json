    "text": "The Boston mayoral election of 1933 occurred on Tuesday, November 7, 1933. Former state treasurer Frederick Mansfield defeated five other candidates to be elected Mayor of Boston. In 1918, the Massachusetts state legislature had passed legislation making the Mayor of Boston ineligible to serve consecutive terms. Thus, incumbent James Michael Curley was unable to run for re-election. Mansfield was inaugurated on Monday, January 1, 1934. ==Candidates== *William J.
