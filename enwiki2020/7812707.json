    "text": "Joe Bar Team is a famed series of biker (\"motards\" in French) comics whose main characters experience all sort of situations and adventures every-day riders encounter often in real life. They were originally released by Vents d'Ouest. The original idea was created by Bar2 (Christian Debarre) and carried on by Fane (St\u00e9phane Deteindre) who also introduced three new younger characters. Joe Bar is a pun on barjo, a colloquial word which means nuts, not, as is sometimes thought, jobard which means naive or gullible. ==Publication history== The first volume was initially released in 1990 and has had seven more volumes for a total of eight. The riders' adventures were originally set in 1975 Paris but their motorcycles were switched for more modern ones in some of the comics. The time setting is not really important, since the situations they encounter are timeless, humorously depicting all aspects of motorcycling spirit. A typical example of a Joe Bar Team Vignette Currently, six volumes and a special are still published. The first and fifth album were made by Bar2, the other four albums were made by Fane. Joe Bar Team featured briefly in the British magazine Super Bike. ==Characters and their bikes== Appearing since the first album Joe, cafe proprietor.
