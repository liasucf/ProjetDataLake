    "text": "Newtown Flicks Short Film Festival is held annually in and around the Sydney suburb of Newtown, Australia. Established as a non-profit organization in 2006. The festival was the brainchild of Martin Kelly, Bill Jordan and Spiros Hristias, who discovered a mutual love of film while operating equipment in the bio box of New Theatre, a live performance venue in Newtown. Over coffees in local cafes, they developed the festival's name and logo, its aims (to support emerging filmmakers and showcase their works) and awards categories. After setting up the enterprise with their own money, they looked for outside sponsorship. The major sponsor since 2006 has been JVC Professional, donors of filmmaking equipment. The JVC encouragement award is presented to a filmmaker showing potential not yet fully realised. Cash prizes are offered in the other categories together with bags for audio-visual accessories made by Crumpler and statuettes made by a local arts collective. Over the years Newtown Flicks have received grants from City of Sydney and Screen NSW; Newtown Flicks became a national film festival in 2009. Past judges have included critic Garry Maddox, writer Phillip Gwynne, stuntman Grant Page and actors Mark Lee and Genevieve Lemon. Design of the statuettes and posters changes with each festival. With Newtown Flicks now in its 6th year, and currently calling for entries up until 6 July 2012, their focus is on encouraging filmmakers with fewer opportunities by providing a festival and associated network for aspiring and emerging Australian artists. They also provide ongoing opportunities for the screening and touring of their work. Bruce Beresford, the Academy Award-winning director of Driving Miss Daisy and Mao\u02bcs Last Dancer, is now the patron for the 2012 Festival. \\---- ==2006 Festival== Held at the New Theatre between 15\u201317 April Winners {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !
