The album's biggest hits were its title track, \"Gastarbjaterska 2\", \"Care\" (which criticizes Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Socialist Party of Serbia), and the ballad \"Princ\". The song \"16 no\u0107i\" is a Serbian language cover of Merle Travis' song \"Sixteen Tons\", Riblja \u010corba version dealing with phone sex.
