    "text": "The Cabrach () is an estate and largely depopulated rural community in Moray, Scotland. The meaning of the name has been much disputed. Traditionally it is held to mean \"timber moss\", though this has no recognisable counterpart in Scottish Gaelic, and Alexander Smith (1875) suggests no Gaelic meaning can be assigned. Iain Mac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) gives a meaning \"antler place\", whilst Ainmean-\u00c0ite na h-Alba, the national advisory partnership for Gaelic place- names in Scotland, suggests \"the place of the trees\". ==Geography== The Cabrach, located in rural Moray, is a sparsely populated area wide by long consisting of mountainous terrain. It lies on the northernmost fringe of the Cairngorms National Park at the intersection of the countryside roads that connect Speyside to the north, Aberdeen to the east and, Donside to the south. The town of Huntly is away. Elgin, the main town in the region, is to the north. == References == ==External links== * Threestones, Cabrach Resources * Cabrach Feerings at The Internet Archive *Cabrach & Glenfiddich Estates - Regeneration * Cabrach Trust Category:Places in Moray Category:Parishes of Scotland ",
