    "text": "The Sri Lanka national football team (, ) represents Sri Lanka in association football and is controlled by the Football Federation of Sri Lanka, the governing body of football in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's home grounds are Colombo Racecourse , Sugathadasa Stadium and Kalutara Stadium. The Sri Lankan team was known as the Ceylon national football team until 1972 when Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka. A member of the AFC, the team has yet to make their first appearance in FIFA World Cup or AFC Asian Cup finals. They have been South Asian champions once, in 1995. As is true elsewhere on the sub-continent, top- level football in Sri Lanka stands somewhat in the shadow of the country's test cricket team. However, the side did reach the second qualification stage for the 2006 World Cup. In the same year, they became the runners-up in the 2006 Challenge Cup. In 2014, at the 75th anniversary of FFSL, FIFA President Sepp Blatter visited Sri Lanka and opened a new football stadium in Jaffna. During the visit, Blatter said he was not pleased with the development of Football in Sri Lanka and that the authorities haven't taken enough steps to support football on the island. The AFC President Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa also joined the visit. In the qualification round of the 2018 World Cup, Sri Lanka lost both matches against Bhutan and failed to qualify for the next round. However, Sri Lanka national football team had managed to qualify for the semi-finals of the 2015 SAFF Championship. == History == === Early history === Football was introduced to Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) by the British. There is evidence of it being played in Galle Face, a sandy area near the coast, by British servicemen stationed in Colombo in the 1890s. The game was also played at grounds of the barracks at Echelon Square and the army grounds (presently the Taj Samudra Hotels). British servicemen of the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and the Royal Garrison Command began and promoted competitive football in Ceylon. The British administrative service and the planting community enthusiastically took it to the Central, Southern, and Up-Country regions. By early 1900 competitive football was popular with the local youth. The game became popular and local football clubs were formed. St. Michael's SC, Havelock's Football Club, Java Lane SC, Wekande SC, Moors FC, and CH & FC, the last being a European monopoly, were some of the first clubs in Columbo. Harlequins FC and Saunders SC soon joined. The trophies of the early tournaments were the De Mel Shield and the Times of Ceylon Cup. Football also became popular in the country's Southern Provence, where the planting and administrative community promoted the game. British planter T R. Brough in Deniyaya heavily promoted football in the south between 1910\u20131920, and British servicemen from the Navy wireless station in Matara also helped popularise it. In 1952, Ceylon became a member of FIFA and got the opportunity to play football at the international level. The country's first International friendly was played against India. The Football Federation organised a tournament called Colombo Cup, which helped the national team to improve their skills and compete with other nations. From the 1960s, the under-19 football team competed in the AFC u19 championship. === 1990s to present === In 2015 Sri Lanka played for the first time in the Bangabandhu Cup. This tournament was organised by Bangladesh Football Federation. The national U-23 teams of Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia and Singapore participated in this tournament. The national football teams of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also competed in this tournament. Sri Lanka was placed in the group with Malaysia and Bangladesh. In the first game Sri Lanka played against the Malaysian team. Malaysia won the match by 2\u20130. The second match was played against the host Bangladesh. Sri Lanka lost the game 1\u20130. Sri Lanka failed to score a goal in this tournament. After a six years of poor performance in the international football field Sri Lanka football team managed to qualify for the Semi Final of 2015 SAFF Championship. The poor performance continued in the Solidarity Cup as well. They had another shock defeat this time by the hands of Mongolia the lowest ranked team in Asia. As a result of this defeat Sri Lanka eliminated in the Group Stage of the tournament. In July 2018, Sri Lanka welcomed a historical encounter when they faced Lithuania, marked for the first time Sri Lanka will face a European team. The Sri Lankans managed a respectable 0\u20130 draw to the UEFA side but lost 0\u20132 in the second encounter.http://www.thepapare.com/match-report-sri-lanka-b- lithuania-football-friendly-11th-july-2018/ During 2022 World Cup campaign however, Sri Lanka suffered another poor performance as the team fell 0\u20131 in Zhuhai to Macau. Macau was subsequently disqualified, as the team refused to travel to Sri Lanka in the aftermath of 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings,https://www.thetelegram.com/sports/world-cup-qualifier-in-sri-lanka- canceled-after-macau-refuse-to-travel-320518/ Sri Lanka was awarded a 3\u20130 win in response, thus qualified to the second round of the World Cup for the first time since 2006 campaign.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2019/06/29/sri-lanka- welcomes-fifa-ruling-macau-out-of-wcup-qualifying/39638659/ In the second round, Sri Lanka was unlucky to be drawn with four 2019 AFC Asian Cup participants, South Korea, North Korea, Lebanon and Turkmenistan. As predicted, Sri Lanka proved too weak for the group, losing all matches without scoring a single goal as for the end of 2019, and was eliminated from World Cup contention. Sri Lanka had improved since then, and participated in the 2020 Bangabandhu Cup, but the team still finished bottom with two defeats and no goal. In February 2020, the Football Federation of Sri Lanka announced the appointment of Bosnian specialist Amir Alagi\u0107 as head coach of the national team.\u0421\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0428\u0440\u0438-\u041b\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430 == Team image == === Media coverage === There is no official TV broadcaster for the football matches played by the Sri Lanka team because the Football Federation of Sri Lanka has not sold broadcasting rights. The SAFF Championship was broadcast by several channels, and tournaments in the 1990s and 2000s were broadcast free-to-air by Channel Eye. The 2013 SAFF Championship was broadcast by CSN. Star Sports also broadcast the SAFF Championship on pay TV satellite broadcasters. The official online broadcaster of Sri Lankan football matches is thepapare.com which streams the games of the Sri Lanka Football Premier League, the finals of the Sri Lanka FA Cup, and the AFC U-19 Championship. === Colours === The team uses different kits for home and away games. The kits are currently manufactured by Grand Sport Group. ==== Home ==== The traditional home kit of the national team has mostly been maroon shirts and maroon shorts, but blue colours have also been used. The colours are derived from the 15th century flag of Kingdom of Kandy. ==== Away ==== The away shirt colour has changed several times between a white shirt with white shorts or a black shirt with black shorts.
