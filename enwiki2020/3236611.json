    "text": "{| |} The Curtiss XA-14 was a 1930s United States airplane, the first multi- engine attack aircraft tested by the United States Army Air Corps. Carrying a crew of two, it was as fast as the standard pursuit aircraft in service at the time. ==Design and development== Originally built as an in-house venture as the Curtiss Model 76, powered by two experimental Wright XR-1510 radial engines, flight testing was sufficiently impressive that after the USAAC appraisal the Model 76 was returned to Curtiss and fitted with two Wright R-1670-5 Whirlwind engines with two-position variable-pitch propellers. This configuration was accepted by the Army with the designation XA-14.Eden and Moeng 2002. pp. 74\u201377. It had standard Army markings with the serial number 36-146.Swanborough and Bowers 1964, p. 231. The Model 76 was of all-metal construction with an oval section semimonocoque fuselage, described as \"pencil slim\". The XA-14 was extensively tested, at one stage being fitted with a cannon in the nose.Fitzsimons 1967/1969, p. 2324. In July 1936, 13 developed versions, re-engined with two Wright R-1820-47 Cyclone 9-cylinder radials, were ordered into production as the Y1A-18. ==Specifications (XA-14)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Eden, Paul and Soph Moeng, eds.
