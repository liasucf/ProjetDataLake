He was the first cousin of Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the Philippines, as well as the grandfather of Cesar Virata, a former prime minister in the 1980s. ==Early life== Baldomero Aguinaldo was born in Kawit, Cavite. He was the son of Cipriano Aguinaldo y Jamir and Silveria Baloy. His father was the son of Eugenio Aguinaldo y Kajigas and Maria Jamir. ==Education== He studied law at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila and was still a law student during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. He obtained a law degree, but failed to take the bar examination. Unable to practice law, he became a farmer. ==Career== Aguinaldo organized, along with his cousin Emilio, the Magdalo chapter of the Katipunan in Kawit. He became president of the council. In the early days of hostilities, he always stayed at the side of his cousin Emilio. He fought in several bloody battles. He also led the Magdalo faction to the Katipunan which had its headquarters in Kawit, Cavite. Aguinaldo's knowledge of the law and administrative procedures made him a valuable asset to the revolutionary government. He was appointed to several cabinet positions, and was a signer of two important documents: The Biak-na-bato Constitution, and the Pact of Biak- na-Bato. During the Philippine\u2013American War, Aguinaldo fought again, becoming commanding general of the revolutionary forces in the southern Luzon provinces. When hostilities ended in 1901, he retired to private life. He held many various positions in the Aguinaldo Cabinet as Minister of National Defense and Finance Minister. During the American occupation he became the President of the Philippine Veteran's Association. ==Personal life== He was married to Do\u00f1a Petrona Reyes with 2 children: Leonor and Aureliano. Leonor was the mother of former Prime Minister Cesar Virata. Aguinaldo was a member of the Philippine Independent Church (also known as the Aglipayan Church) as he saw independence from the Roman Catholic Church as a source of national pride. ==Death== Aguinaldo died in Manila of heart failure and rheumatism on February 4, 1915 at the age of 45 and was interred at the Manila North Cemetery. His remains were later exhumed and brought to his home in Binakayan, Cavite. ==In popular culture== * Portrayed by Bayani Agbayani in the 2012 film, El Presidente. * Portrayed by Gexter Abad in the 2013 TV series, Katipunan. * Portrayed by Jan Urbano in the 2014 film.
