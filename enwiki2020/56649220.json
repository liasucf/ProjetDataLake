Initially, there was speculation that Kamal Haasan could ally with the Congress after the state Congress chief had hinted at it. A few days ago, a lesser known Republican Party of India had forged an alliance with the MNM. Releasing the party manifesto and the second list of candidates of his Makkal Needhi Maiam or MNM at a function in Coimbatore, Mr Haasan said, \"All candidates are my faces. I am proud being the chariot puller than being in the chariot\". Makkal Needhi Maiam's vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election was 3.72% (in the seats it contested). Makkal Needhi Maiam secured 15,73,620 votes of the 4,20,83,544 polled in Tamil Nadu. J. Ebenezer, who contested from the Kanyakumari constituency secured the fewest votes at 8,590 while the MNM vice president Dr. R.Mahendran contesting from the Coimbatore constituency secured the highest number of votes by the party at 1,45,104. The party performed well in urban areas such as Chennai and Coimbatore, where it regularly polled upwards of 10% of the vote share and often secured more than one lakh votes, but it performed poorly in rural areas. Despite this, all the candidates lost their deposit. Makkal Needhi Maiam candidates lost their deposit in all the seats it contested in the 2019 Indian general election but they came third in many urban constituencies through it fell behind the Naam Tamilar Katchi in several rural constituencies and Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam in some constituencies behind the DMK and AIADMK fronts came first or second in all constituencies. == See also == * List of Makkal Needhi Maiam candidates in the 2019 Indian general election == References == == External links == * Category:Centrist parties in India Category:Political parties in India Category:2018 establishments in India Category:Political parties in Tamil Nadu Category:Political parties established in 2018 ",
