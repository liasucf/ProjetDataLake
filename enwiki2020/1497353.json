    "text": "El Capit\u00e1n Trueno (lit. \"Captain Thunder\") is the hero of a series of Spanish comic books, created in 1956 by the writer V\u00edctor Mora and illustrated mainly by Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza (Ambr\u00f3s). The comics were published continuously between 1956 and 1968, with Trueno eventually becoming the most popular Spanish hero comic of all time: at its height it sold more than 170,000 copies every week. The series was inspired by Hal Foster's Prince Valiant. ==Publication history== Portions of the comic books have also been published in several Latin American countries, Italy (as \"Capitan Tuono\"), Greece, Portugal and France. The series suffered some limited censorship during the dictatorship. Censors were concerned, for example, that Capit\u00e1n Trueno and Sigrid were traveling around the world unburdened by matrimonial ties (v\u00ednculos matrimoniales). ==Characters and story== El Capit\u00e1n Trueno is a 12th-century knight-errant, assisted by his faithful companions the cunning adolescent Crisp\u00edn and the huge gourmandiser Goliath. His eternal dame is Sigrid of Thule, an energetic Viking princess who takes part in many of the adventures of the trio. In successive books, Capit\u00e1n Trueno and his friends travel the whole world enforcing justice and freedom against bullies and tyrants, never using more violence than necessary. ==In other media== ===Film=== The character appears in the 2011 film Capit\u00e1n Trueno y el Santo Grial (aka Captain Thunder and The Holy Grail), directed by Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez, with actor Sergio Peris-Mencheta in the lead role. ===Video game=== A video game was released by Dinamic Software for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and MSX.Capitan Trueno on World of SpectrumCapit\u00e1n Trueno on Generation MSX ==Popular culture== El Capit\u00e1n Trueno has been the subject of several popular songs; by Asfalto, in their eponymous 1978 debut album, and by Spanish pop veteran Miguel Bos\u00e9 in his song \"El Hijo del Capitan Trueno\" (Captain Thunder's Son) from his 2001 album Sereno. ==References== ==External links== *El Capit\u00e1n Trueno on-line * Category:Comics characters introduced in 1956 Category:Fictional knights Category:Fictional Spanish people Category:Spanish comics characters Category:Spanish comics titles Category:1956 comics debuts Category:Comics set in the 12th century Category:Comics set in the Middle Ages Category:Comics adapted into video games ",
