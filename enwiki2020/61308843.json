Both parents were immigrants from Russia. Her father ran a news stand. She studied at the New York Institute of Musical Art, a precursor of the Juilliard School.Bill Edwards, \"Mary Muriel \"Molly\" Pollock Groll Donaldson\" at RagPiano.com. == Career == As a young woman, Pollock played the organ in silent movie theatres, and worked at her father's news stand. She wrote a musical, Mme. Pom Pom, in 1914, with Marie Wardall.\"Gifted Girls Who Write Songs\" (January 18, 1929) The News-Palladium p. 24, via Newspapers.com. Another 1914 work, \"Carnival\", was written for a fundraising event for the Sanitarium for Hebrew Children in Rockaway Park. Pollock's Broadway credits included Jack and Jill (1923), for which she supplied \"additional music\"; Rio Rita (1927-1928) and Ups-a Daisy (1928), in which she appeared playing piano duets with Constance Mering; Pleasure Bound (1929), for which she wrote the music; and the musical revue Shoot the Works (1931), for which she wrote both music and lyrics. Pollock worked at Mel-o-Dee Music Company and Rhythmodik Music Corporation, composing, arranging, and playing works for piano roll. She later performed duets with Vee Lawnhurst, as The Lady Bugs or The Lady Fingers, and played one piano roll duet with George Gershwin. In 1922 she sang and played piano in Bermuda, in a grand concert at the Colonial Opera House. She made many recordings between 1927 and 1934, most of them on the Edison label. She was a frequent pianist on radio programs, sometimes playing her own \"compositions especially for radio\", and sometimes playing other works or accompanying other performers. She became an ASCAP member in 1933.
