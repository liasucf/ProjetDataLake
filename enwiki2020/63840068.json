From 1 July 2010, a unified primary health organisation has covered the entire new Southern DHB region with primary health organisation (PHO) centres in Alexandra, Dunedin, and Invercargill with the mandate of providing PHO resources and services, replacing the previous nine PHOs. ==Geographic area== The area covered by the Southern District Health Board is defined in Schedule 1 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 and based on territorial authority and ward boundaries as constituted as at 1 January 2001. The area can be adjusted through an Order in Council. ==Governance== The initial board was fully appointed. Since the 2001 local elections, the board has been partially elected (seven members) and in addition, up to four members get appointed by the Minister of Health.
