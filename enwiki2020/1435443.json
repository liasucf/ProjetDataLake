    "text": "is a town located in Shiribeshi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. As of September 2016, the town had a population of 2,215, and a density of 9.3 persons per km\u00b2. The total area of the town is , and located west of Sapporo, the capital and economic hub of Hokkaido. Shakotan occupies the north of the Shakotan Peninsula. It was founded in 1869 as part of the short-lived Shiribeshi Province, which was dissolved in 1882 to become Hokkaido. Shakotan, along with neighboring Otaru, is home to Japan's only national-level marine sanctuary. Shakotan is home to the three great capes of the Shakotan Peninsula: Kamui, Shakotan, and \u014cgon. ==Etymology== The name of the town originates from the word \"ShakKotan\" in the Ainu language. It is formed from two words, the first, \"shak\", meaning \"summer\", and the second, \"kotan\", meaning \"village\". In the Japanese language the name of the town is written with ateji, or kanji characters used to phonetically represent native or borrowed words. The first, , means to \"store\" or \"accumulate\", and the second, , means \"red\" or \"red earth\". The meaning of the written form of Shakotan has no relationship to the meaning of \"Shakotan\" in the Ainu language. ==History== Cape Shakotan Lighthouse Shakotan was first settled by the Japanese immigrants in the Edo period (1603 - 1868). The Tokugawa shogunate, the feudal rulers of Japan of the period, granted the Matsumae Clan rights to trade with the Ainu people in the southern Hokkaido region. With the decline of the fortune of samurai families during the Edo period, many chose to give up life as a warrior and migrate to Shakotan and other coastal areas of southern Hokkaido to farm and develop the rich herring industry. The settlements on Shakotan were connected to the rest of Japan only by sea; the construction of roads across Hokkaido did not occur until the early 20th century. During the Bakumatsu (1853 - 1867), the final years of the Edo period, fishermen began using large nets to harvest herring. Shakotan developed a large population, rivaling that of nearby Otaru. A census taken in 1879 revealed that the Funama area of Shakotan consisted of 75 households, had a population of 350, 10 horses, a school, a temple, and three Shinto shrines. The census noted the catch of Pacific herring and salmon, as well as the gathering of abalone and konbu. Shakotan was connected to other areas of Hokkaido by steam ferry in 1892. By 1899 the town had a post and telegraph office, as well as a police station, a brothel, a shipping office, and a restaurant. The era of the herring industry ended due to overfishing by 1917, and the population on the Shakotan Peninsula decreased rapidly. The modern town of Shakotan was formed in 1956 by a merger of the town of Bikuni and the villages of Irika and Yobetsu. ==Geography== The town of Shakotan is located on the north of the Shakotan Peninsula in western Hokkaido, and occupies one fourth of the area of the peninsula. The border of the town is defined by the three great capes of the Shakotan Peninsula: Kamui, Shakotan, and \u014cgon. The town faces the Japan Sea and has a long, scenic sea coast. Much of the coast of Shakotan is faced by steep sea cliffs. The population of the town is concentrated in small villages along the coast. The interior of the town is rugged with little flat land, and is made up of the mountainous areas centered on the twin peaks of Mount Shakotan () and Mount Yobetsu (). The entire coast of Shakotan is protected as part of Niseko-Shakotan-Otaru Kaigan Quasi-National Park. The park, established in 1962, covers , and is managed by the prefectural government of Hokkaido. Shakotan's capes and dramatic Shimamui Coast are important parts of the park. The marine park of Niseko-Shakotan-Otaru Kaigan Quasi-National Park, located off the shore of Shakotan and Otaru, is the only designated marine sanctuary in the national parks system of Japan. Fishing is prohibited along the length of the marine sanctuary. ===Capes=== View south from Cape Kamui The three major capes of the Shakotan Peninsula, Cape Kamui, Cape Shakotan, and Cape \u014cgon, define the coast of the Shakotan Peninsula.

The smaller Gome Island sits near Takara Island, and takes its name from its similarity in shape to the Gome seagull. ===Rivers=== Three short rivers cut through the town.
