    "text": "Maybe Baby is a 2000 British comedy film starring Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson. It was written and directed by Ben Elton, with Laurie directing some scenes in an uncredited role, and based upon Elton's novel, Inconceivable. The film was a critical failure, and did not do well at the box office, despite a cast including many of the best-known names within comedy in Britain. ==Plot== Sam Bell (Hugh Laurie) and his wife Lucy (Joely Richardson) are a married couple struggling for a baby, having tried everything they can think of to improve their chances of conceiving. At the same time, Sam begins to find his job (as a commissioning editor of drama at the BBC) increasingly unfulfilling. While he resolves to write his own screenplay, he begins to suffer writer's block. The idea dawns upon him to write about his own predicament, something to which Lucy objects strongly. He uses her diary entries to help him achieve authenticity, and the film is a success. Lucy finds out about the film and, shocked, leaves Sam. Eventually they reconcile, and at the end of the story are still trying for a baby. It marks the second time Laurie and Richardson have starred in the same film; the first was 101 Dalmatians (although in that film they shared no scenes). ==Cast== *Hugh Laurie as Sam Bell *Joely Richardson as Lucy Bell *Matthew Macfadyen as Nigel *Adrian Lester as George *Yasmin Bannerman as Melinda *Joanna Lumley as Sheila *Rachael Stirling as Joanna *Dave Thompson as Dave the Comedian *Emma Thompson as Druscilla *James Purefoy as Carl Phipps *Tom Hollander as Ewan Proclaimer *Rowan Atkinson as Mr. James *Kelly Reilly as Nimnh *Dawn French as Charlene ==Soundtrack== The title song \"Maybe Baby\" is performed by Paul McCartney and co-produced by McCartney and Jeff Lynne. \"I Don't Wanna Fight\", a song from Westlife's self-titled debut album, is played in the last part of the movie. Melanie C's song \"Suddenly Monday\" also appears on the soundtrack, alongside tracks by Roxy Music, Lene Marlin, Atomic Kitten, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, George Michael and Madness. Laurie co-wrote and performed the humorous blues song \"Sperm Test in the Morning\". ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes reported a 46% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.1/10 based on 28 reviews. When the film was released in the United Kingdom it opened at No. 3, behind Gladiator and Final Destination. ==External links== * == References == Category:British romantic comedy films Category:2000 romantic comedy films Category:BBC Films films Category:British films Category:2000 films Category:British independent films Category:Films based on British novels Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Ben Elton Category:Films shot in London Category:Films with screenplays by Ben Elton Category:2000 comedy films Category:2000 independent films ",
