The film stars Raj Kapoor and Vyjayanthimala in the lead, with Usha Kiran, Achala Sachdev and Agha as an ensemble cast, while South Star Gemini Ganesan has an extended cameo appearance. The music is by Ravi. The Mohammed Rafi song \"Baji Kisi Ne Pyar Ki\" was picturised on Raj Kapoor and it was one of the popular sad songs of that era. The film was a remake of the 1959 Tamil film Kalyana Parisu, which was also directed by C. V. Sridhar. Nazrana is a triangular love story between Raj, Vasanthi and Geeta. == Plot == Raj (Raj Kapoor) and Vasanti (Vyjayanthimala) are college mates who clash when she complains to the college principal about a love letter he sent her. Later on, realizing her mistake, Vasanti apologizes to him and the two fall in love. Vasanti's elder sister, Geeta (Usha Kiron), supports the family by stitching clothes. Raj rents the room upstairs in their house. He falls ill and in nursing him, Geeta falls in love with him. She confides her love to Vasanti, who decides to sacrifice her love for the sake of her sister and convinces Raj to marry Geeta. Raj initially neglects Geeta. On finding out, Vasanti writes to him that their sacrifice, made for Geeta's happiness, would mean nothing unless he is a good husband to Geeta. Raj relents and marries Geeta and they have a son. Vasanti joins them and Geeta suspects that there is something on between Raj and Vasanti and makes Vasanti leave the house. A few years later, Geeta, having found out that Raj and Vasanti loved each other, dies in guilt leaving Raj alone to bring up their child, making him promise that he will make Vasanti the child's mother. Raj learns of Vasanti's impending marriage to her former boss (Gemini Ganesan). By the time he reaches there, Vasanti is already married. He hands over his child to Vasanti as a wedding gift and walks away. == Cast == *Raj Kapoor as Rajesh *Vyjayanthimala as Vasanti *Usha Kiran as Geeta *Agha as Murli *Sabita Chatterji as Chanchal *Niranjan Sharma as Shyam's dad *Achala Sachdev as Geeta and Vasanti's Mother. *Master Shahid as Raja *Gemini Ganesh as Shyam, Vasanti's Boss (Guest Artist) == Casting == Initially the shooting of the film was started with actress B.
