    "text": "The Ragamuffins are a British indie pop band based in the North West of England, close to Manchester and Liverpool. ==Biography== The band was formed by David Jaggs and Richard Nicholson in 2007 under the name The Rascallies, but they later decided to change the name to The Ragamuffins due to fellow North West band The Rascals. Paul Heck and Jules Gilchrist joined at the start of 2008 and things began to kick off from there. Richard decided to call it a day in the summer of 2009, his last gig being for Lancashire's \"Rock FM\" and the band recruited Brent Ashton to take his place behind the drum kit. Past gigs include the Snowbombing Festival in Austria, playing mainstage at The Beatherder Festival alongside Reverend & The Makers and The Whip, headlining Liverpool's o2 Academy 2, supporting Everything Everything, supporting The Zutons, opening the 6-month-long \"Made in Europe\" Festival in Italy and performing at Alan Mcgee's Death Disco in London. The Ragamuffins have recorded a live video for MUTV thanks to a shared support of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity; the video frequently airing on the Sky TV channel. They've also had records played numerous times at Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium by longtime announcer George Sephton. Furthermore, the song 'Royally Flushed' provides the backing track for showreel of North West media (showcased at events such as the Labour Party Conference). The Ragamuffins are featured as a BBC Introducing band, and recently appeared on BBC Radio Lancashire on 'An intimate afternoon with The Ragamuffins' (in the past they have played live on BBC Radio Merseyside, Blackburn Station \"107 The Bee\", Salford City Radio and other smaller local stations too) In 2011, after something of a hiatus, David and Paul announced that they would be releasing a new album in 2012 entitled Irony Curtain containing re-recordings of some older tracks as well as several brand new songs. The album was released on Liverpool label \"7L Records\" and focussed on a more organic guitar-pop sound than the \"Batteries Not Included\" era material. This was followed up by 2013's \"The Telling Tales EP\" making more use of the soulful brass section that the band encompassed for the Irony Curtain sessions and the subsequent live performances in support of it. In November 2014, the band played a three-song set at Moorfields Station, Liverpool as part of Merseyrail's 'Sound Station'. In 2016 the band released their second full album, Over On The Shipping Forecast through Liverpool publishing company Ditto Music, receiving airplay on BBC Radio 2 and on ITV's \"This Morning\", with the album's accompanying tour including dates alongside Britpop band Dodgy and Stax Records guitarist Steve Cropper. In 2018, the band followed this up with Cause Of Causes, their third album also released through Ditto Music. They also wrote \"Si Se\u00f1or\", along with Marc Kenny, which is a song about Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino. ==Press== \u201cAsp Bites\u201d Online Review \u201cI'm not often impressed to the same margin I was when I heard The Ragamuffins via BBC Introducing. They are definitely a band for me, and their \"kitchen-sink-drama jangly indie-pop songs\" are really appealing. Together with their addiction to cups of tea, their music is close to my heart. It's similar enough to fit into the generically popular 'indie' category that's overwhelmed nowadays, but reasurringly different\" Bluesbunny Independent Music Reviews on \u201cEl Bandito\u201d: \u201cThrowing us a lifebelt filled with happy hummable songs, this band are what this once great country needs; a reason to get out of bed and dance. So set sail for the future because it will certainly be bright if The Ragamuffins have anything to do with it. 4/5\u201d ==Discography== ===Singles=== *\"Batteries Not Included\" (Japan, 2009) *\"The Telling Tales EP\" (UK, 2013) *\"The Benefits Of A Downhill Paper Round EP\" (2013) ===Albums=== *Irony Curtain (UK, 2012) *Over On The Shipping Forecast (UK, 2016) *Cause Of Causes (UK, 2018) ==References== Category:British indie pop groups ",
