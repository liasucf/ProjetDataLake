    "text": "Alexandru Antemireanu (born Alexandru Damian; August 1, 1877 \u2013 June 29, 1910) was a Romanian poet, prose writer and literary critic. Born in Tom\u0219ani, Prahova County, his father Antemir Damian was a Romanian Orthodox priest. He was sent to nearby Urla\u021bi for primary school, where his surname was changed after his father's first name. He attended high school in Ploie\u0219ti, followed by the University of Bucharest's faculty of literature and philosophy, where he audited courses by Titu Maiorescu. Antemireanu became intensely involved in newspaper writing in order to earn a living, forcing him to abandon his studies. His first published work appeared in the daily newspaper \u021aara in 1895. He drew notice from Nicolae Filipescu, to whose conservative newspaper Epoca he migrated. There, he edited the literary section before becoming editing secretary. After furthering his education in Paris and Munich, Antemireanu returned home and returned to journalism at the newspapers Ap\u0103rarea na\u021bional\u0103, Rom\u00e2nul and Conservatorul, editing the literary features. He edited Epoca literar\u0103 and, in 1898, founded Floare albastr\u0103 magazine with \u0218tefan Octavian Iosif. Antemireanu contributed political articles, literary feuilletons, translations, verses, sketches, short stories, literary and dramatic news and reviews to Convorbiri Literare, Litere \u2013 \u0219tiin\u021be \u2013 arte, Noua revist\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103, Povestea vorbei, Revista literar\u0103, Revista poporului, Revista ilustrat\u0103 and Secolul. He signed using various pen names: Lys, Hyalmar, Elvira Santorino, Alan Damian, Demeter, Emir, Lysandros, Pollux, Seraficus, Ulys, Vindex, Zara, Zaratustra. Beset by material difficulties and burdened by the duties of newspaper work, Antemireanu lived in the bohemian milieu of Bucharest coffeehouses; he died young, of tuberculosis. He translated from Henrik Ibsen, wrote poetry and a novel, Din vremea lui C\u0103pitan Costache, which appeared in 1937. Initially serialized in 1898, it deals with the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. Moderate in its politics, the book shows sympathy for Prince Gheorghe Bibescu and contrasts Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu with the more liberal revolutionaries.John Neubauer et al., \"1848\", in Marcel Cornis-Pope and John Neubauer, History of the Literary Cultures of East- Central Europe, vol. I, p. 290. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing, 2004. In his literary criticism, which included the 1905 volume \u00cencerc\u0103ri critice. Junimea \u0219i roadele ei, Antemireanu attempted to break new ground.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. I, p. 55.
