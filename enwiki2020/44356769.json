    "text": "The William Nicholas Straub House is a historic house at 531 Perry Street in Helena, Arkansas. It is a stylistically eclectict 2-1/2 story structure, built in 1900 for William Nicholas Straub, a prominent local merchant. The house's main stylistic elements come from the Colonial Revival and the Shingle style, both of which were popular at the time. The house has a first floor finished in painted brick, and its upper floors are clad in shingles. The main facade has a single-story porch across its width, supported by three Ionic columns. The entrance, on the left side, has a single door with a large pane of glass, and is topped by a transom window. On the right side is a two-sided projecting bay section. The house's most prominent exterior feature is a crenellated tower which rises above the entry. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1900 Category:Houses in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:Historic district contributing properties in Arkansas ",
