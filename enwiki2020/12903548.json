    "text": "Oxanthera is a genus of flowering plants in the citrus family, Rutaceae. They are endemic to New Caledonia. They are known commonly as false oranges. Phylogenetic analysis has shown these species to cluster in the same clade as Clymenia and the Australian limes within Citrus, which would also make these species members of that genus, and relegate Oxanthera to a subgenus.
