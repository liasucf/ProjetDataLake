    "text": "Kozani (, ) is a city in northern Greece, capital of Kozani regional unit and of West Macedonia region. It is located in the western part of Macedonia, in the northern part of the Aliakmonas river valley. The city lies above sea level, northwest of the artificial lake Polyfytos, south-west of Thessaloniki, between the mountains Pieria, Vermio, Vourinos and Askio. The population of the Kozani municipality is over 70,000 people. The climate of the area is continental with cold and dry winters, and hot summers. Kozani is the home of the University of Western Macedonia, with about 15,000 students from all over Greece and other places. It is also the seat of West Macedonia's court of appeal, police department, fire brigade, the seat of the 1st Army Corps of the Hellenic Army and of the Bishop of Servia and Kozani. One of the most important aspects of local folklore is Kozani's carnival at the end of the winter, which retains much of the profanity of the ancient Dionysiac cult.http://alternatrips.gr/en/makedonia/kozani/carnival-fanoiof-city-kozani Kozani is renowned in Greece and abroad for the production of Saffron (Krokos Kozanis), in the nearby town of Krokos.http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/gastronomy/traditional_products/kozani_crocushttp://www.safran.gr/index.asp Kozani is a transport node between Central Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus. The nearest airport is Filippos Airport, from the city, IATA code: KZI. The airport was first opened in the mid-20th century. Kozani is situated near the Egnatia Highway, which connects the coast of the Ionian Sea with Thessaloniki and Turkish borders. ==Etymology== Kozani in Northern Greece According to prevailing opinion in Greece, the name comes from the village of Epirus K\u00f3sdiani, the origin of settlers of Kozani in 1392. The settlement was first named K\u00f3zdiani, which then, it was changed into K\u00f3ziani, and in the end into Koz\u00e1ni.\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 ==History== ===Antiquity=== Antiquities from the prehistoric to the Byzantine period have been unearthed in many sectors of the city. In the east part of Kozani, an ancient necropolis has been found, dating to the early Iron Age.\u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0394. \u039d\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 2005. \u03a4\u03bf \u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b9\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2. During Philip II of Macedon's reign, the region was named Elimeia, which was part of Upper Macedonia and probably in the same place there was a town named Tyrissa. In the south-west of the modern city, on Siopoto hill, there was a settlement named Kalyvia, between 1100 and 1300, traces of which are still preserved. Saint Nicholas (Agios Nikolaos) church ===Ottoman period=== Kozani was probably founded by Christian settlers who, after the Ottoman conquest, withdrew from the plains of Macedonia into the mountains, during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its secure position soon attracted other Christians expelled from Epirus, in 1392.\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a7. 1820. \u0391\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03af \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2. \u0392\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7.

His son, Charisios Trantas, managed to obtain a Sultan's firman in 1664, according to the terms of which the town came under the protection of the Sultan's mother, was endowed with many privileges, and became forbidden for the Turks to settle in.\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 - 14\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 - 20\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 Agios Nikolaos' clock tower (Mamatsios), landmark of the city, in 1916. In 1664, the magnificent church of Agios Nikolaos was built. In 1668, the library and the famous school of Kozani were founded. During the 17th and 18th century, commercial relations with the countries of central Europe gave the opportunity for the city to flourish economically. During the 19th century, as foreign travellers relate, the population of the town was Greek, and was growing (Leake 1835:305Leake, W.M. 1835:305. Travels in Northern Greece. London. and Bou\u00e8 1854:87Bou\u00e8, A. 1854:87. Recueil d' itineraires dans la Turquie d' Europe. Details topographiques et statistiques sur cet empire. Vienna.). The town's growth was disrupted in 1770, because of conflict that erupted between Kozani's local inhabitants and Kozanite merchants in central Europe, who contributed to the town's prosperity; even more catastrophically, the city was pillaged by Turkish beys in 1770. A subsequent incursion by Aslan bey, in 1830, ravaged the city immensely. In 1855 next to St. Nicholas Church a 26 meters high bell tower was built, which would become the symbol of the city. In 1939, a clock was added to the top of the tower, donated by Greek-American, Konstantinos Mamatsios. According to the 1904 population census, 12,000 Greeks and 350 Aromanians (Vlachs) were living in Kozani at the time.\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2. \"\u0397 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\", in: \"\u0395\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\", 48-49, 2001. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Kozani was part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. ===Balkan wars=== Kozani, 1918 The clock tower today in Nikis Square View of the municipal park The Greek army entered Kozani on 11 October 1912, during the First Balkan War, after its victory against the Ottoman army in the Battle of Sarantaporo.

In 1923, during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, about 1,400 Greek families from Pontus and Asia Minor were settled in Kozani. ===Modern times=== ELAS during WWII In the 20th century, the city grew tremendously, as lignite reserves in the area started being used by Public Power Corporation, making Kozani the foremost producer of electrical power in Greece. An earthquake that occurred in the region on 13 May 1995, with a magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter scale, caused only property damage.\u039f \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 13 \u039c\u03b1\u0390\u03bf\u03c5 1995 The city now combines modern with old architecture.

It is developing into a nodal town of the Western Balkans, with areas and activities of a wider regional nature. Within this context, the municipality of Kozani is creating a modern satellite town, the Kozani Zone of Alternate Urban Planning (ZEP). The Municipal Corporation of alternate planning and development of Kozani S.A.(DEPEPOK) was established in order to implement the projects of the ZEP. The ZEP is strategically located on 50 ha south-west of Kozani, and aims to become a model development centre, attracting an urban population and economic activities from throughout Western Macedonia in Greece and the Western Balkans. Other known neighborhoods of Kozani are Sk'rka, Ipirotika, Gitia, Agios Athanasios, Platania. ===Province=== The province of Kozani () was one of the provinces of the Kozani Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Kozani (except a few villages that were part of the Eordaia province) and Servia-Velventos. It was abolished in 2006. ==Climate== Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Kozani has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year. The climate of Kozani has changed over the years as a result of the environmental degradation brought by the extensive lignite mining in the area. The lignite mine is one of the largest in Eastern Europe; due to the constant expansion of the mining activities in the area several communities have already been moved closer to city of Kozani and more are scheduled to be moved by 2020. Given that the main source of income for the city of Kozani is the lignite mine and the thermal power station in the area local residents are often biased about the environmental catastrophe brought on by these activities. ==Education== Valtadoreion Gymnasion There are 18 Primary schools in Kozani, and another 8, in the municipal departments of Vatero, Kariditsa, Koila, Lefkovrysi, Lefkopigi, Nea Charavgi, Xirolimni and Petrana. The Gymnasiums of the city are 8, and there are two more in the municipal departments of Lefkopigi and Xirolimni. There are also 4 Lyceums, 4 Technical Schools (TEE), some Business Schools and one municipal Odeum. The city is the seat of the University of Western Macedonia which has 7 Faculties and 22 Departments in 5 cities (Kozani, Florina, Kastoria, Ptolemaida, and Grevena). The main campus is located in Kila, Kozani. The University was founded in 2002.https://www.uowm.gr/en/about/history/ ==Culture== ===Festivals and events=== Kozani carnival is one of the most important events in the region, taking place at the end of winter. The dates change each year, depending on the start date of Lent. Carnival festivities in Kozani, and generally in Greece, last eleven days, starting on Tsikopempti (: Grassy Thursday, equivalent to Mardi Gras) and ending on Kathara Deftera (: Clean Monday, equivalent to Ash Wednesday). During the Kozani carnival, great bonfires are lit in different parts of the city; every night, another district lights its fire and people dance around it; on the last night of the carnival, all fires are lit. These festive fires, as well as the cultural associations that organize the festivities in each district, are called Fanoi (fires). Each fanos welcomes visitors and locals to their district with songs and dances, and treats them to local delicacies, namely kichia (feta cheese wrapped around a snail-shaped phyllo) and meatballs, as well as wine. Popular songs are sung around the fire, with the singers and crowd dancing in a primitive way that sees repeating the same steps and gestures; at midnight, scatological and explicit songs are sung. In between songs, bands play instrumental songs, such as the Enteka, often called Kozani's \"national anthem\". In 2010, Theodoros Lakkas, one of the most prominent figures of the fanoi, lead singer of the fanos Lakkos t' maggan and writer of funny short stories, published the first anthology of Kozani's carnival songs, entitled Ivgati Agoria m stou chouro [Go dance, my boys]. This has been the first attempt so far to collect all the songs in one volume. At the end of summer Lassaneia Events are organised. They consist of theatrical representations, concerts, athletic events etc. The name \"Lassaneia\" comes from Georgios Lassanis, who was from Kozani and participated in the Greek War of Independence. A part of those events is also the new authors song festival \"Nikolas Asimos\". Niaimeros is a fair in the north of the city in the Niaimeros place. It takes place on the first Tuesday of October. It used to last 9 days (niaimeros = nine days), but now it lasts only 3 days. Official local public holidays are the celebration for the liberation of the city from the Turks on 11 October and Saint Nicolas day - Kozani's patron - on 6 December.
