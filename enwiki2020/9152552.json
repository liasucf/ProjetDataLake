He is said to be from Sicily,http://www.pico-kabbalah.eu/ and was a Christian convert, known for preaching impressively if tendentiously.: he is there called a \u2018clever charlatan\u2019. He also had a knowledge of Arabic.This PDF, p.83 places him at Rome 1477-1483, and as possibly the only scholar there with a working knowledge of Arabic. He worked on translating the Qur'an for Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, who died in 1482. ==Biography == About 1486 he lived at Fratta, near Perugia, in the house of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, whom he instructed in Aramaic. He is now best known as the translator for Pico della MirandolaThe Jewish Encyclopedia says for Pope Sixtus IV; thirty-eight fragments in Vatican MSS. Nos. 189-191. of the Bibliotheca Cabalistica, a large 3500 pages of manuscript compilation of cabbalistic literature.E.g. this PDF, p.49. Modern scholarly reconsideration of this work have found it somewhat erratic and containing interpolations. He also translated into Latin Maimonides' epistle on resurrection, Levi ben Gershon's commentary on the Song of Solomon, and Judah's \"Ma'amar ha-Hawayah ha-He\u1e33\u1e33eshiyyah,\" or \"Sermo de Generatione Syllogismorum Simplicium et Compositorum in Omni Figura.\"He seems not to have known that the last-named work was really written in Latin by Aegidius Romanus, and that Judah was only the translator of it. Flavius was the author of \"De Tropis Hebraicis,\" an original work in Latin on Hebrew accents, which was praised by Sebastian M\u00fcnster and Imbonatus. ==Identity== Some scholars have thought, but without sufficient reason, that Flavius is identical with the cabalist Johanan Aleman ben Isaac1435-1504, i.e. Yohanan Aliman, Yohanan Isaac ben Allemanno. a contemporary and associate of Pico della Mirandola, who taught him from the late 1480s.
