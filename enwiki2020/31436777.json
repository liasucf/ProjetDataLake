    "text": "\"I'm a Marionette\" is a song recorded by the Swedish pop group ABBA from their fifth album, ABBA: The Album. Written by Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, this song was part of a mini-musical called The Girl with the Golden Hair that ABBA performed at several of their live concerts. The other songs in the \"mini-musical\" were \"Thank You for the Music\", \"I Wonder (Departure)\" and \"Get on the Carousel\". With the exception of the last track, studio versions of these appeared on the 1977 ABBA album. \"I'm a Marionette\" was the B-side of \"Take a Chance on Me\", when it was released as a single. In 2013, Swedish heavy metal band Ghost released a cover of the song as the B-side of their single \"Secular Haze\", and later included it on the deluxe and Japanese editions of their album Infestissumam. It was also featured on their 2013 covers EP If You Have Ghost. ==References== ==External links== * Category:ABBA songs Category:Songs written by Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus Category:1977 songs Category:Polar Music singles Category:1978 singles Category:Art rock songs Category:Progressive rock songs ",
