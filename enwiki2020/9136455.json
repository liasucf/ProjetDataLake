    "text": "Methylmalonyl-CoA is the thioester consisting of coenzyme A linked to methylmalonic acid. It is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of many organic compounds as well as in the process of carbon assimilation.Tabita, F. R., \"The hydroxypropionate pathway of CO2 fixation: Fait accompli\", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2009, vol. 106, 21015-21016. ==Biosynthesis and conversions== Methylmalonyl-CoA is formed from propionyl-CoA by propionyl-CoA carboxylase by help of biotin (vitamin B7). It is converted into succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. In this way, it enters the Krebs cycle. The following diagram demonstrates the aforementioned reactions: :Propionyl CoA \u2192 Methylmalonyl CoA \u2192 Succinyl CoA ==See also== * Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase ==References== Category:Thioesters of coenzyme A ",
