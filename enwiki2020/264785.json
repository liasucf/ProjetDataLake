At the time of the handover of Macau to the People's Republic of China, plans were in place to modernize the police force with the goal of better positioning the force to combat organized crime and to stop illegal immigration. In October 15, 2019, the MSF's Discipline Supervision Committee was given the power to investigate complaints made towards anyone working under the MSF.https://macaunews.mo/security-forces-discipline-supervision- committee-gets-more-powers/ ==Structure== The MSF has the following organizations under its command:https://macaunews.mo/macau-public-security- forces-affairs-bureau-to-be-restructured-expanded * Public Security Forces Affairs Bureau (DSFSM) * Unitary Police Service (SPU) ** Public Security Police (PSP) ** Judiciary Police (PJ) * Correctional Services Bureau (DSC) * Fire Services Bureau (CB) * Macao Customs Service * Academy of the Public Security Forces. ==Academy of Public Security Forces== MSF Joint Center of Instruction was created in 1976 to attract membership from the public.
