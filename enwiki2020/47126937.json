    "text": "Ice-Capades is a 1940 American film. Its score, composed by Cy Feuer, was nominated for the Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. ==Plot== Bob Clemens is a cameraman for newsreels. Assigned to shoot the Swiss ice skater Karen Vadja, he arrives too late, so decides to film a woman skating on a different New York rink and pass her off as Karen. The scheme backfires when promoter Larry Herman takes a look at Bob's film and decides to make the skater a star. Unfortunately, it's actually amateur (and illegal immigrant) Marie Bergin in the newsreel footage, not the great figure skater from Switzerland. Chaos ensues as Bob tries to straighten everybody out. ==Cast== * James Ellison as Bob Clemens * Phil Silvers as Larry Herman * Renie Riano as Karen Vadja * Alan Mowbray as Pete Ellis * Jerry Colonna as Colonna * Dorothy Lewis as Marie Bergin * Barbara Jo Allen as Vera Vague * Vera Ralston as Ice Skater ==References== ==External links== * ==See also== *Ice Capades *Ice-Capades Revue *\"Nice-Capades\" Category:1940 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films set in 1940 Category:Republic Pictures films Category:1940 musical comedy films Category:Films with screenplays by Jack Townley Category:Films produced by Robert North Category:Films directed by Joseph Santley Category:American musical comedy films Category:1940 comedy films ",
