He played college football at North Carolina.https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl-draft-prospect-nazair-jones-rare- disease-scale-1-10-pain-12-221557965.html ==Professional career== On December 9, 2016, Jones released a statement through his Instagram account and announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Jones attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and performed the majority of drills, but elected to skip the bench press, short shuttle, and three-cone drill. On March 13, 2017, Jones participated at North Carolina\u2019s pro day and chose to perform the 40-yard dash (5.15s), 20-yard dash (2.99s), 10-yard dash (1.77s), bench press (18 reps), broad jump (8\u201910\u201d), and short shuttle (4.64s). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Jones was projected to be a third round pick by NFL draft scouts and analysts. He was ranked the eighth best defensive tackle prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com and was ranked the 18th best defensive tackle by Scouts Inc. ===Seattle Seahawks=== ====2017==== The Seattle Seahawks selected Jones in the third round (102nd overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. Jones was the sixth defensive tackle drafted in 2017. On May 11, 2017, the Seattle Seahawks signed Jones to a four-year, $3.17 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $706,288. Throughout training camp, Jones competed to be a backup defensive tackle against Garrison Smith, Jeremy Liggins, and Shaneil Jenkins. Head coach Pete Carroll named Jones the third defensive tackle on the depth chart to begin the regular season, behind Sheldon Richardson and Jarran Reed. He made his professional regular season debut in the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 season-opener at the Green Bay Packers and recorded one solo tackle, deflected a pass, and returned an interception for a touchdown during their 17\u20139 loss. Jones made his first career interception off a pass attempt by Packers\u2019 quarterback Aaron Rodgers, that was originally a screen pass intended for tight end Lance Kendricks, and returned it for a 64-yard touchdown in the first quarter. However, his touchdown was nullified due a penalty on Cliff Avril for an illegal block in the back during the return. The Packers declined another penalty on cornerback Jeremy Lane who was ejected for throwing a punch during the play. On November 5, 2017, Jones earned his first career start after Sheldon Richardson suffered an oblique injury and was listed as inactive. Jones finished the Seahawks\u2019 17\u201314 loss to the Washington Redskins with three combined tackles and was also credited with half a sack. The following week, Jones recorded two solo tackles and made his first career solo sack during a 22\u201316 victory at the Arizona Cardinals in Week 10. Jones\u2019 first career solo sack was on Cardinals\u2019 quarterback Drew Stanton for an eight-yard loss in the fourth quarter. In Week 11, he collected a season-high four combined tackles as the Seahawks lost 34\u201331 to the Atlanta Falcons. On December 30, 2017, the Seattle Seahawks officially placed Jones on injured reserve after he was inactive for four games (Weeks 13\u201316) due to a high ankle sprain in Week 12. Jones completed his rookie season in 2017 with 19 combined tackles (ten solo), three pass deflections, two sacks, and one interception in 11 games and two starts. ====2018==== On January 16, 2018, the Seattle Seahawks announced their decision to fire defensive coordinator Kris Richard and hire their former linebacker coach Ken Norton Jr. to be Richard\u2019s successor. During training camp, Jones competed to be a starting defensive tackle against Shamar Stephen after it was left vacant by the departure of Sheldon Richardson. Head coach Pete Carroll named Jones the fourth defensive tackle on the depth chart to begin the regular season, behind Jarran Reed, Tom Johnson, and Shamar Stephen. Jones was inactive as a healthy scratch for the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 27\u201324 loss at the Denver Broncos in their season-opener. Jones was also inactive, as a healthy scratch, for the Seahawks\u2019 33\u201331 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Week 5. ====2019==== On August 27, 2019, Jones was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury.
