    "text": "Hakk\u0131 is a Turkish name, originating from the days of the Ottoman Empire. Its direct translation is 'truth'. As a result of it being frequently used in the Ottoman Empire as a birth name, it has led to the name being given to children in Turkey and Cyprus. The name itself was more common during the 17th century when the Turkish Empire was at its peak, but its frequency of use declined gradually in the following years. In the 20th century however, many Turkish parents began to find it a more modern and European name than that of Mehmet and Huseyin and as a result, the name again became popular in Turkey as well as European countries with sizeable Turkish communities, such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France. People named Hakk\u0131 include: * Hakk\u0131 Atun, former prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus * Hakk\u0131 Hocao\u011flu, Turkish footballer * Hakk\u0131 Keskin, Turkish-German politician * Hakk\u0131 Keteno\u011flu (1906\u20131977), Turkish judge * Hakk\u0131 Yeten, (1910\u20131989), Turkish footballer * Hakk\u0131 Yaz\u0131c\u0131 (born 1981) Turkish economist * Hakki Hasanen (born 1975) Legendary Finnish tour bus driver Category:Turkish masculine given names ",
