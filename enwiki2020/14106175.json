However, in 1862 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer, and later served in the Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby, Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1866 to 1868, 1874 to 1880 and 1885 to 1886. The latter year he was created Earl de Montalt, of Dundrum in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Between 1885 and 1905 he also held the honorary post of Lord-Lieutenant of County Tipperary. ==Family== Lord de Montalt married Clementina, eldest daughter of Admiral Charles Elphinstone Fleeming, in 1845. She died in 1865. One of their sons, the Honourable Cornwallis Maude, a Captain in the Grenadier Guards, was killed in action at the Battle of Majuba Hill in 1881. Lord de Montalt died on 9 January 1905, aged 87, at a hotel at Holyhead, Anglesey. While waiting for a boat to Ireland he became too ill to travel and died. As he had no other surviving sons the earldom became extinct on his death. He was succeeded in his other titles by his cousin Robert Henry Maude. ==Titles and styles== * 4 April 1817 \u2013 12 October 1856: The Honourable Cornwallis Maude * 12 October 1856 \u2013 9 September 1886: The Right Honourable The Viscount Hawarden * 9 September 1886 \u2013 9 January 1905: The Right Honourable The Earl de Montalt ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
