    "text": "Shen Yuan (; born 1959 in Xianyou, Fujian), is a Chinese-born French artist. She graduated from China Academy of Art in 1982, and then started to practice in the Xiamen Dada group, an artists group that is known for exploring radical avant-garde art in Southern China. She moved to Paris, France with her husband Huang Yong Ping after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. As a contemporary artist, Shen Yuan's art often reflects on Chinese cultural and political realities. She has strong messages of feminism and gender roles in her artworks. Topics include issues such as labor (child labor, women workers), slums, and social conflicts. Her artistic production process often makes use of on-the-spot investigations and local creative methods to work together with local children or people to complete the work. She has been featured in many exhibitions.https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d6280e_d32140190ada42729cfb55d9579186c8.pdf Most recently, her and her husband works were both featured in Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum group exhibition Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World, and also featured in solo exhibition Hong Kong Foot with her husband at Tang Contemporary Art (Hong Kong). == Early life == Shen Yuan was born to a family of artists. She took up painting under encouragement from her father. In the new art movement known as '85, the artists of Xiamen Dada engaged in contemporary art within the context of a tense political climate. In 1990, Shen Yuan and her husband Huang Yong Ping left China and resettled in Paris. In this city vibrant with artistic activity, they encountered a newly found creative freedom. Nonetheless, the displacement presented a new host of challenges including cultural confrontation, language barriers, and the pressures of life in a new environment. == Art works == Having moved to Paris, Shen Yuan's works often discuss the topics of immigration experience, identity, travel, life, and life. The identity of immigrants allowed her to start a new beginning of creation. When she first arrived in Paris, she lived in an old abandoned hospital. She could not express her thoughts and could not defend herself. This isolated experience was condensed in the exhibition's first work, Perdre sa salive (1994) When the frozen tongue melts a little, the internal knives will appear\u2014the soft tongue becomes a dangerous weapon, just as language can cause harm. The symbol of the tongue in Shen Yuan's artistic creation has multiple layers of meanings and possibilities. In terms of artistic creation, it is dualistic, that is, material and spiritual. Material Because it is part of the body, the spirit is instrumental because it is language. \u201cIn my creation, the tongue is more representative of the latter, namely language and tools. I like ice as a material because it has a fragile and easily melting side, but when you hold it in your hand, it is biting.\u201d Visually, it is in the process of constant change and instability. == Personal life == Shen Yuan is married to renowned artist of contemporary Chinese art, Huang Yong Ping. They have carried out a number of collaborative projects, including a show at Tang Contemporary Art Hong Kong (2018). \"We both have a strong personality, but we understand and support each other.\" When asked about her husband in an interview, Shen Yuan said, \u201cWhen we first came to Paris, we decided not to have children. But then some years later, I felt the urge of wanting a kid.\" They have a daughter, born in 1995. == Exhibitions == ;Selected Solo Exhibitions {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title of Exhibition |- |2017 |\u201cWithout Wall\u201d, Tang Contemporary Art, Beijing, China |- |2015 |\u201c\u00c9toiles du jour\u201d, Galerie Kamel Mennour, Paris, France |- |2013 |\u201cFIAC\u201d, Hors-les-murs, Tuileries, Paris, France |- |2012 |\u201cSky Ladder\u201d, Tang Contemporary Art, Beijing, China |- |2011 |\u201cCr\u00e2ne de la Terre\u201d, Parc Monceau et Mus\u00e9e Cernuschi, Paris, France |- |2010 |\u201cGarofalo\u201d (with Huang Yongping), Edicola Notte, Rome, Italy |- | |\u201cGarofalo\u201d (with Huang Yongping), Edicola Notte, Rome, Italy |- |2009 |\u201cShen Yuan: Hurried words\u201d, UCCA Middle Hall, Beijing, China |- |2008 |\u201cLe Degr\u00e9 Z\u00e9ro de l\u2019espace\u201d, Galerie Kamel Mennour, Paris, France |- |2007 |\u201cShen Yuan\u201d, Centre A, Vancouver, Canada |- |2005 |Galerie Beaumontpublic, Luxembourg |- |2003 |\u201cShen Yuan\u201d, Kunstverein N\u00fcrtingen, Germany |- | |\u201cBeauty Room 5\u201d, Beauty Room Gallery, Paris, France |- |2001 |\u201cShen Yuan\u201d, Bluecoat, Liverpool, UK |- | |\u201cShen Yuan\u201d, Arnolfini, Bristol, UK |- | |Un Matin du Monde\", Chisenhale Gallery, London, UK |- | |\u201cShen Yuan\u201d, French Institute, London, UK |- |2000 |\u201cSous la terre, il y a le ciel\u201d, Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland |- |1999 |\u201cDiverged Tongue\u201d, Project Gallery at CCA Kitakyushu, Japan |- |1994 |\u201cPerdre sa salive\u201d, organized by Vices & Vertus, Paris, France |} == References == Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Fujian Category:Chinese women artists Category:People from Putian Category:Chinese emigrants to France ",
