The stadium could hold 14,300 people and was the home of Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I club Videoton FC. The football arena was opened in 1967 and set its record attendance on 8 May 1985, when 40,000 fans flocked to see the UEFA Cup Final first leg between Videoton and Real Madrid. ==History== The construction of the stadium began on 1963, however, following World War II, there were already held matches on that site. It took four years to finish the work, and the inaugural match took place on 30 September 1967, when VT Vasas hosted East German side FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt. Ferenc Bogn\u00e1r was the first ever player to score in the new stadium, hitting a freekick from a distance of 22 meters. The floodlighting system was set up in 1978, followed by further improvements four years later, which made the S\u00f3st\u00f3i Stadion one of the most up-to-date football venues in the country that time. The arena was part of the Hungarian Euro 2004, Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 bids and therefore went through significant developments in the 2000s. The stadium got a new main stand, an improved access control system and CCTV cameras were set up for the complete video surveillance. New media and VIP sections were formed as well to meet the strict criteria of the UEFA. Although amelioration slowed following the unsuccessful European Championship candidations, S\u00f3st\u00f3i Stadion still remains one of the best equipped stadiums in Hungary. The floodlights are able to illuminate the field with 1500 lux, and an under soil heating system being installed under the main pitch, making the sports complex available to host UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League matches. On 12 December 2015, Videoton played their last match at S\u00f3s\u00f3ti Stadion against Paksi FC in the 2015\u201316 Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I season. The match ended with a 1\u20130 victory for Videoton. The last goal was scored by G\u00e9resi in the 80th minute. ===Demolition=== On 18 December 2015, the demolition of the stadium started. First, the iron seats in the away sector will be removed. Second the plastic seats in the home sector will be removed, while in January 2016 the floodlights will be dismantled. Andr\u00e1s Cser-Palkovics, mayor of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, said that most elements of the old stadium will be reused in some stadium in Hungary. The seats of the stadium will be used in other stadiums in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, in Fej\u00e9r county including Cs\u00e1kv\u00e1r, Iszkaszentgy\u00f6rgy, S\u00e1rkereszt\u00far and abroad. The turf will be reused at the pitch of Ikarus, in Budapest while some devices and items of furniture will be reused in other buildings in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. Cser-Palkovics also added that 800 seats (200 HUF per seat) were purchased by the fans of Videoton who have season tickets. Those who do not possess season tickets can purchase the seats for 1000 HUF. According to Attila M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, vice-mayor, the demolition is expected to be finished by April 2016. Therefore, the construction can be started in May or June 2016. ==Milestone matches== ==International matches== The table below shows the matches played by the Hungarian national team in the S\u00f3st\u00f3i Stadion.
