He studied as an undergraduate at the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, Peking University (1954\u20131958) and as a postgraduate at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (1963\u20131967). He worked at Peking University and CAS until his visit to the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Oxford University Department of Computer Science) (1989\u20131992). During this time, he was the prime investigator of the Duration Calculus, an interval logic for real-time systems as part of the European ESPRIT ProCoS project on Provably Correct Systems. During the periods 1990\u20131992 and 1995\u20131996, Zhou Chaochen was visiting professor at the Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, on the invitation of Professor Dines Bj\u00f8rner. He was Principal Research Fellow (1992\u20131997) and later Director of UNU-IIST in Macau (1997\u20132002),UNU Rector appoints Zhou Chaochen as New Director for UNU/IIST, UNU-IIST, Macau, 1997. until his retirement, when he returned to Beijing. In 2007, Zhou and Dines Bj\u00f8rner, the first Director of UNU-IIST, were honoured on the occasion of their 70th birthdays.Jones, Cliff B., Liu, Zhiming, and Woodcock, Jim (eds.), Formal Methods and Hybrid Real-Time Systems: Essays in Honour of Dines Bjorner and Zhou Chaochen on the Occasion of Their 70th Birthdays, Springer, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Theoretical Computer Science and General Issues, Volume 4700, 2007. .
