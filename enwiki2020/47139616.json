Iverson co-founded the National Women's Rowing Association (NWRA) with fellow rowers Ted Nash (Lake Washington Rowing Club) and Ed Lickiss (Lake Merritt Rowing Club). Her continued promotion of equality in the sport helped to introduce women's rowing into the Olympic Games in Montreal in 1976, where she was a member of the initial United States Women's Olympic Rowing Committee. As Manager of the 1976 women's Olympic rowing team, she helped the team win a bronze medal in the eight and a silver medal in the single sculls. Iverson was subsequently appointed to President Gerald Ford's Commission on Olympic Sports, serving with Rafer Johnson. Having begun rowing in 1959, Iverson was named the recipient of USRowing's \u201cErnestine Bayer Award\u201d in 2010, for her lifelong efforts and her continued dedication to the sport of rowing.
