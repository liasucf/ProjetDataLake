Under the influence of van Spaendonck he turned to flower painting. He regularly submitted work to the Paris Salon between 1793 and 1833 as well as to Salons in the Low Countries. Evidence of his success are the many commissions he secured from the Empresses Josephine (who owned five of his works) and Marie-Louise Bonaparte as well as Restoration kings Louis XVIII and Charles X. Van Dael was a member of the Academies of Antwerp and Amsterdam. He collected the works of flower artists, both by his contemporaries and the great 17th-century Dutch still life painters Jan Davidsz. de Heem, Abraham Mignon, Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum. His pupils were Jean Benner-Fries, Elise Bruy\u00e8re, Laurent Coste, Vicomtesse Iphig\u00e9nie Decaux-Milet-Moreau, Henri\u00ebtte Geertruida Knip, Elisa-Emilie Le Mire, Auguste Piquet de Brienne, Christiaan van Pol, Ad\u00e8le Rich\u00e9, and Jean Ulrich Tournier. He spent his whole active career in France. He died in Paris in 1840 and was buried in the cemetery of P\u00e8re Lachaise by the side of his friend van Spaendonck. ==Work== Van Dael mainly painted still lifes of flowers and fruit. Some of these compositions include a background landscape. Van Dael also painted a landscape composition. Van Dael signed as 'Vandael' and monogrammed as: I V D, V D and VD connected. Van Dael's work stands in the Flemish and Dutch tradition of flower painting exemplified by Roelandt Savery with its sober composition and attention to detail. He also brought to many of his flower arrangements a French-inspired decorative monumentality. Van Dael composed his flower-pieces with a variety of species, which he is believed to have studied from life. Van Dael's flowers were based on botanical study, and according to a contemporary botanist, van Hulthem, he grew flowers in his garden to serve as models. Van Dael applied a smooth gesso layer to his canvases, which allowed him to recreate the jewel-like quality of 17th century panels. He departed from 17th-century still lifes in his use of a lighter palette of pinks, blues and yellows. A number of his still life works were used to decorate small objects, such as boxes. The Fitzwilliam Museum possesses a collection of these boxes.Boxes decorated by Jan Frans van Dael at the Fitzwilliam Museum Van Dael painted in 1828 a view of his house (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam), which is a small masterpiece. He further painted a few religious and allegorical compositions. One of his best known allegorical paintings is Julie\u2019s Tomb of 1804 (Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison). It depicts a flower and fruit arrangement before a tomb and can be read as an allegory of life and death. Van Dael also made a few pure landscapes and occasionally painted portraits, often of fellow artists. He also made a few lithographs. ==References== ==External links== Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Flower artists Category:People from Antwerp Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery Category:18th-century Flemish painters Category:18th-century painters from the Southern Netherlands Category:19th-century Flemish painters Category:1764 births Category:1840 deaths ",
