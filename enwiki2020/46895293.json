The docu-series chronicles the life of six women who all grew up on Long Island and follows them as they go through the challenges of marriage and divorce. The women are described as a \"tight-knit, ultra-wealthy group of friends and rivals who know everything about each other.\" The series may resemble the series The Real Housewives aired on the same network. One of the cast members, Andi Black, explains the difference by saying that \"we've [the cast] all known each other for 20 to 30 years.\" She emphasizes the fact that they are all long-time girlfriends and have always been involved in each other's life. \"When the camera stops rolling, we're still talking about the same issue,\" she also added. The show was not renewed for a second season. == Cast == * Andi Black * Susan Doneson * Cori Goldfarb * Gail Greenberg * Amy Miller * Liza Sandler == Episodes == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"%\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #D772CB; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #D772CB; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #D772CB; color: #FFFFFF\"| Original air date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #D772CB; color: #FFFFFF\"| U.S. viewers |- |} ==Broadcast== Internationally, the series premiered in Australia on September 8, 2015 on Arena. == Reception == Verne Gay from Newsday wrote a negative review about the show by saying that \"the ladies seem like fun, the show not so much.\" == References == == External links == * * * Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings Category:English- language television shows Category:Bravo (American TV network) original programming ",
