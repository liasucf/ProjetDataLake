    "text": "Hajduk weapons, Belgrade Military Museum. The Serbian hajduks ( / hajduci) were brigands and guerrilla fighters (rebels) throughout Ottoman-held Balkans, organized into bands headed by a haramba\u0161a (\"bandit leader\"), who descended from the mountains and forests and robbed and attacked the Ottomans. They were often aided by foreign powers, the Republic of Venice and Habsburg Monarchy, during greater conflicts. The hajduks are seen as part of the Serbian national identity. In stories, the hajduks were heroes; they had played the role of the Serbian elite during Ottoman rule; they had defended the Serbs against Ottoman oppression, and prepared for the national liberation and contributed to it in the Serbian Revolution. The Chetniks saw themselves as hajduks, freedom fighters. The hajduk movement is known as hajdu\u010dija (\u0445\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430) or hajdukovanje (\u0445\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435). Ranks included buljuba\u0161a and haramba\u0161a, adopted from the Ottomans. ==16th century== Starina Novak (~1530\u20131601), a military commander in Wallachian service, is said to have been the oldest hajduk. ==18th century== On 26 November 1716, Austrian general Nasti\u0107 with 400 soldiers and 500 hajduks attacked Trebinje, but did not take it over. A combined Austro-Venetian-Hajduk force of 7,000 stood before the Trebinje walls, defended by 1,000 Ottomans. The Ottomans were busy near Belgrade and with hajduk attacks towards Mostar, and were thus unable to reinforce Trebinje. The conquest of Trebinje and Popovo field were given up to fight in Montenegro. The Venetians took over Hutovo and Popovo, where they immediately recruited militarly from the population. ===Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)=== The Serbs established a Hajduk army that supported the Austrians. The army was divided into 18 companies, in four groups. In this period, the most notable obor-kapetans were Vuk Isakovi\u0107 from Crna Bara, Mlati\u0161uma from Kragujevac and Kosta Dimitrijevi\u0107 from Para\u0107in. The most notable obor-kapetans were Vuk Isakovi\u0107 from Crna Bara, Mlati\u0161uma and Kosta Dimitrijevi\u0107 from Para\u0107in. Apart from the obor-kapetans, other notable commanders were kapetans Keza Radivojevi\u0107 from Grocka and Sima Vitkovi\u0107 from Valjevo. In Kragujevac, there were two companies of 500 soldiers each. He conquered Kru\u0161evac with his militia, and carried much cattle. Colonel Lentulus ordered that part of the cattle be returned to the population, the second part was sent to Sekendorf, the third held by the colonel to the need of his army. ==19th century== ===Great Eastern Crisis=== During the Great Eastern Crisis, set off by a Serb uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1875 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Herzegovina Uprising), Prince Peter adopted the nom de guerre of hajduk Petar Mrkonji\u0107 of Ragusa, and joined the Bosnian Serb insurgents as a leader of a guerilla unit. ===Serbian Revolution=== Among Serbian revolutionaries that had been active hajduks prior to the Revolution, were Stanoje Glava\u0161, Hajduk- Veljko, Stojan \u010cupi\u0107, Lazar Dobri\u0107, and others. ==List of notable hajduks== This is a list of notable people, in chronological manner.
