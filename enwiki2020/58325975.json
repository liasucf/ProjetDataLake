    "text": "In Serbian myth, Vy, a giant with a petrifying gaze similar to the Celtic Balor. ==Description== Vy, according to W. R. S. Ralston (1873), is the name the Serbians name for some mythological creature whose \"glance [is] supposed to be as deadly as the basilisk\"., p. 72. Ralston had no more to say on the creature except that it bore resemblance in outward appearance to the Russian character called the \"Aged One\" (\"Old, old man\"), whose eye had the power to petrify, in the Russian wonder-tale Ivan Bykovich (; \"Ivan the Cow's Son\"). Alexander Haggerty Krappe, in his study of the Irish deadly-gazed giant Balor draws parallel with this vy, especially in the motif of the giants with heavy eyebrows or eyelid that needs lifting. However, Krappe has confused the vy with the \"Aged One\", and the motif is actually from the Russian tale, not the vy legend. Krappe thus supposes an early Indo-European times (see Indo- European languages) when the (ancestors of) respective Celtic and Slavic peoples were far closer related. ==See also== *Ysbaddaden, a welsh giant in folk tales. *Viy (story) (1835), by Gogol. *List of one-eyed creatures ==References== ===Sources=== * * Category:Serbian folklore Category:Serbian mythology ",
