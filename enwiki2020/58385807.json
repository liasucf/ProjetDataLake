His research interests include Differential equations, Geometry, Didactics of mathematics and informatics and Applications of mathematics and computer methods in the humanities; the focus of his research activity during the last 20 years was namely the last of the fields mentioned above. The list of selected publications below illustrates the problems and the results of the research. The main idea of the Quantitative methods is exposed in No. 17; its typical applications are presented in No. 18 and 25-27. The participation in the European project DIGMAP for digitization of old maps was a stimulus for the series of papers related with historical geography and toponyms. Deciphering of texts and chronological problems of the different old \u201cera\u2019s\u201d are classical fields for applications of mathematical reasoning; clearly the old inscriptions suggest many challenges for such a research \u2013 this is illustrated in the list below by papers No. 34-39. The same is true for papers No. 40-41. Besides he is also an amateur historian and supports the fringe views on the autochthonous origin of the Bulgarian people, espousing ideas similar to those of Gancho Tsenov.Nikolai Prodanov, Yordan Tabov and Kl.Vassilev.
