It made its maiden flight in 2020, lofting a small military satellite titled Noor () into orbit. == Design == The Qased rocket is small enough to be launched from a transporter erector launcher, and is thought to be a derivative of the first Iranian orbital launcher, Safir with a solid fueled second stage == Operation == The launcher is notable as it is operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace force rather than the Iranian Space Agency, who operates the Safir and Simorgh. == Launch history == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
