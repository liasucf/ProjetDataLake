It was established on 26 November 2007 and has been led by the CEO Simphiwe Mdlalose who represents MSG Afrika Media, who together with his partner and former talk show host Given Mkhari were part of consortium that successfully competed against a number of contenders for the license to broadcast in Limpopo.

Peoples of all ages will each find that they have been included in the station's broadcasts. The idea to cater for an ever diversifying audience was paramount to the decision to broadcast 70% in English and 30% vernacular, incorporating the three dominant ethnic groups in the province (tshiVenda, sePedi, xiTsonga). Capricorn FM broadcasts 24 hours throughout Limpopo with five transmitters covering the main towns and areas surrounding them. ==Content== The station offers adult contemporary, interspersed with news and views from the station's team of on-air personalities.

The weather and sports news also fill in a substantial percentage of the content. ==Ownership== Capricorn FM is the first commercial radio station in Limpopo, launched on 26 November 2007.
