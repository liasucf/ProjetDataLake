    "text": "New York Polyphony is a male classical vocal quartet based in New York City. Music of the Renaissance and Medieval periods constitutes the core of the ensemble\u2019s repertoire, but increasingly, new music occupies an important place both in performance and on recording. Since their founding in 2006, New York Polyphony has demonstrated a commitment to contemporary music and\u2014in the case of commissions by Andrew Smith, Gabriel Jackson, Jackson Hill and others\u2014works by living composers. In addition, the ensemble frequently collaborates with musicians working in different mediums such as experimental performer/ composer Bora Yoon and violinist Lizzie Ball. Recent events include the European premiere of the Missa Charles Darwin\u2014a newly commissioned secular Mass setting based on texts of Charles Darwin by composer Gregory Brown\u2014at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin, and participation in Jonathan Berger\u2019s chamber opera cycle Visitations at the Prototype Festival with soprano Mellissa Hughes and JACK Quartet. New York Polyphony tours extensively throughout the United States and Europe. They have participated in major international festivals and concert series, including the Miller Theatre Music Series at Columbia University; Rheingau Musik Festival, Th\u00fcringer Bachwochen (Germany); Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (Netherlands); Stiftskonzerte Ober\u00f6sterreich (Austria); Festival de M\u00fasica de Morelia (Mexico); Elora Festival (Canada); and Choral at Cadogan Hall in London. Since 2011, New York Polyphony has recorded for BIS Records. Their 2014 effort Sing thee Nowell scored the ensemble a second GRAMMY nomination, following the critically acclaimed release Times go by Turns (2013). Prior to signing with BIS Records, New York Polyphony released two albums on the British label Avie Records: I sing the birth (2007) and Tudor City (2010). Both received substantial critical acclaim, with the latter reaching #6 on the Billboard classical chart in June 2010. In 2011, a Gregorian chant remix competition sponsored by Indaba Music resulted in the digital album Devices and Desires. New York Polyphony made their television debut in December 2011 on The Martha Stewart Show. The group comprises countertenor Geoffrey Williams, tenor Steven Caldicott Wilson, baritone Christopher Herbert and bass Craig Phillips. ==Discography== *I Sing the Birth (2007) *Tudor City (2010) *Surrexit Christus - EP (2010) *Devices & Desires (2011) *endBeginning (2012) *Times go by Turns (2013) - 56th GRAMMY nominee - Best Chamber Music/ Small Ensemble Performance *Sing thee Nowell (2014) - 57th GRAMMY nominee - Best Chamber Music/ Small Ensemble Performance *Roma Aeterna (2016) *Missa Charles Darwin (2017) *Lamentationes (2019) == References == ==External links== * Official website * Opus 3 Artists * BIS Records * Avie Records * Composer Andrew Smith Category:Vocal quartets Category:Early music choirs Category:Early music groups Category:A cappella musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2006 ",
