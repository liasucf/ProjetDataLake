As of March 2, 2016, the 11-volume series has a total of 1.5 million copies in print, each volume selling 136,000 copies. As of February 2019, the light novels had 6.5 million copies in print. In a review of the first novel, Andy Hanley praised the series' comedy reflected in the \"tired genre\" as well as its cast finding them appealing based on their traits. However, Hanley criticized the short length of the first volume. The series won BookWalker's 2016 Grand Prix Award. Like its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the isekai genre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels. Reviewing the first few episodes, Anime News Network (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as \"the funniest episode of anime I have seen since Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun aired\", while also praising the series' musical score. The voice acting has also been a subject of praise; Nick Creamer of ANN commended Sora Amamiya and Rie Takahashi's roles as Aqua and Megumin for the energy provided in their performances, while Martin applauded Jun Fukushima for his work in voicing Kazuma, considering his dry tone an additional factor in the show's humor. From the Legend of Crimson's release in Japan, Daryl Harding, writing for Crunchyroll News praised the story and comedy of the film noting that the \"classic humor of (the TV series) translates well to a film runtime.\" Daryl Harding did criticise the film by stating that \"It doesn\u2019t look too different than the TV series\" even with \"more effects placed over the animation during scenes of explosive magic.\" In contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as \"low budget\" as characters appeared off- model. Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to \"bring out the individuality of each character\" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed \"their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments.\" Crunchyroll's Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime. Kotaku writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world. Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series. KonoSuba characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have garnered favorable reactions in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a \"strange but endearing chemistry,\" as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close. Morrissy added the party's \"emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other. My favorite thing about the anime is that it takes the time to draw these nuances out onscreen and express them with visual flair.\" Megumin in particular has been considered one of the series' most popular characters, winning Sneaker Bunko's official Favorite KonoSuba Character poll. She was also the sixth-highest vote in Newtype 2015\u201316 Awards for Best Female Character (Kazuma was third in the male category) and received the most \"Other\" votes in the Best Girl category in Crunchyroll's Anime Awards 2016. In an interview with internet personality The Anime Man, Natsume Akatsuki described Megumin as giving off \"a pure and elegant atmosphere\" like one of an anime heroine or waifu, hence her popularity among fans. In 2016, the anime was voted the tenth-best TV anime in the Newtype 2015\u201316 Awards. KonoSuba also finished runner-up for Best Comedy in the Anime Awards 2016 to Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2013 Japanese novels Category:2014 Japanese novels Category:2016 anime OVAs Category:2016 Japanese novels Category:2017 video games Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Crunchyroll Category:Discotek Media Category:Films with screenplays by Makoto Uezu Category:Fujimi Shobo manga Category:Isekai anime and manga Category:J.C.Staff Category:Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Light novels Category:Light novels first published online Category:Media Factory manga Category:Mass media franchises Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games in fiction Category:Monarchy in fiction Category:Novels about the afterlife Category:Reincarnation in fiction Category:Sh\u014dnen manga Category:Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d Category:Studio Deen Category:Sword and sorcery anime and manga Category:Television shows based on light novels Category:Tokyo MX original programming Category:Visual novels Category:Yen Press titles ",
