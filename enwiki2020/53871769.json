Rawitscher in his research focused on scattering problems which involve non-local optical models, reaction mechanisms involving break-up and virtual nuclear excitations, the (e,e\u2019p) reaction. He also worked on numerical methods such as Galerkin method and spectral expansions for solving integral equations Rawitcher was an Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American physicists Category:University of Connecticut faculty Category:Stanford University alumni Category:University of S\u00e3o Paulo alumni ",
