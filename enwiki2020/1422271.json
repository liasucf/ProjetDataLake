    "text": "The French literary style called pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 (, preciousness) arose in the 17th century from the lively conversations and playful word games of les pr\u00e9cieuses (), the intellectual, witty and educated women who frequented the salon of Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet. Her Chambre bleue (the \"blue room\" of her h\u00f4tel particulier) offered a Parisian refuge from the dangerous political factionalism and coarse manners of the royal court during the regency of Louis XIV. One of the central figures of the salon that gathered at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet was Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry. She wrote voluminous romance novels that embodied the refinements of preciosit\u00e9 including the concepts of feminine elegance, etiquette and courtly Platonic love that were hugely popular with female audiences, but scorned by most men, including Moli\u00e8re, who satirized the Pr\u00e9cieuses in his comedy Les Pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules (1659). The \"questions of love\" that were debated in the pr\u00e9cieuses' salons reflected the \"courts of love\" (fictional courts which judged lovers' behavior) that were a feature of medieval courtly love. None of the women ever actually used or defined the term Pr\u00e9cieuse themselves.The first use of pr\u00e9cieuse to denote a literary patron of formidable powers of taste and judgment dates to 1654, according to W. Zimmer, Di literarische Kritik am Preci\u00f6sentum 1978:51, noted in Patricia Howard, \"The Influence of the Pr\u00e9cieuses on Content and Structure in Quinault's and Lully's Trag\u00e9dies Lyriques\" Acta Musicologica 63.1 (January 1991, pp. 57-72) p 58, note. Myriam Ma\u00eetre has found in pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 not so much a listable series of characteristics \"as an interplay of forces, a place to confront and resolve the tensions that extended through the century, the court and the field of literature\".\"...Qu'un jeu de forces, un lieu d'affrontement et r\u00e9glage mutuel de certaines des tensions qui traversent le si\u00e8cle, la cour et le champ litt\u00e9raire\". Myriam Ma\u00eetre, Les Pr\u00e9cieuses: naissance des femmes de lettres en France au XVIIe si\u00e8cle (Paris:Champion) 1999:19. In assessing the career of Philippe Quinault, which began at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne in 1653, Patricia Howard noted, \"For if in French theatre in the second half of the century, women's roles are preeminent, it was the pr\u00e9cieux movement which made them so.\"Howard 1991:58. One pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 parlor game, the retelling of fairy tales as if spontaneously (though the tales were in fact carefully prepared), was to have great effects.Terri Windling, Les Contes des F\u00e9es: The Literary Fairy Tales of France Many of these fairy tales, in the pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 style, were written, mostly notably by Madame d'Aulnoy. This fashion for fairy tales, and the writers themselves, were a notable influence later upon Charles Perrault,Jack Zipes, When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition, pp. 38-42 and Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, the author of Beauty and the Beast.Terri Windling, Beauty and the Beast The stories tended to vary from the folk tradition, for example the characters were made to be of genteel origin.Paul Delarue, The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales, p xi, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 Whilst the heroes and heroines of fairy tales written by the pr\u00e9cieuses often appeared as shepherds and shepherdesses, in pastoral settings, these figures were often secretly royal or noble.Lewis Seifert, \"The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the Contes de F\u00e9es in Late Seventeenth Century France\", Jack Zipes, ed., The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, pp. 920-1, The pr\u00e9cieuses are also remembered through the filter of Moli\u00e8re's one-act satire, Les Pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules (1659). After years touring the provinces, this bitter comedy of manners brought Moli\u00e8re and his company to the attention of Parisians and attracted the patronage of Louis XIV. Les Pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules is considered to be the origin of the pejorative connotation of pr\u00e9cieuse as \"affected\". The phenomenon of the pr\u00e9cieuses in establishing French literary classicism was first revived by Louis Roederer in 1838. His M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 polie en France, evoked an atmosphere of nostalgia for the douceur de vivre of the Ancien R\u00e9gime and the aristocratic leisure of its authors, at least for the upper classes. Later, Roxane, a critical character in Edmond Rostand's 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, is described as a pr\u00e9cieuse. Ren\u00e9 Bary (died in 1680) a French historiographer and rhetorician wrote La Rh\u00e9torique fran\u00e7aise o\u00f9 pour principale augmentation l'on trouve les secrets de nostre langue published in Paris in 1653 for the female audience of the pr\u00e9cieuses. ==Notes== ==References== *Howard, Patricia, \"Quinault, Lully, and the Precieuses: Images of Women in Seventeenth-Century France.\" in Cecilia Reclaimed: Feminist Perspectives on Gender and Music ed.
