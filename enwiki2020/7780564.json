Its studios are in Merced and its transmitter is southwest of Mount Bullion. KABX can be heard in large areas of central California from approximately Modesto, to south of Fresno. It sometimes can be heard as far north as the Eastern portions of the Bay Area. ==History== KABX signed on in 1979 as an automated easy listening station with the call sign KMYT. KMYT was the original FM sister station to KYOS AM 1480 and was originally located at the KYOS-AM transmitter site. At the end of 1999, the station relocated to Shultz Mountain in Cathys Valley, California, to gain better signal coverage. On August 27, 2011, KABX adjusted its format and became mainstream AC \"The New K 97.5- Favorites of Yesterday and Today. Under the guidance of AC consultant Gary Berkowitz, the station is using JAM jingles and voice overs from Jim Merkel. ===Acquisition by Stephens Media=== On July 1, 2019, Mapleton Communications announced its intent to sell its remaining 37 stations to Stephens Media Group. Stephens began operating the station that same day. ==Sources== ==Previous logo== Image:kabx.jpg (KABX's logo under previous \"Oldies 97.5\" branding) ==External links== *FCC History Cards for KABX-FM ABX Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Mass media in Merced County, California Category:Merced, California Category:Radio stations established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in California ",
