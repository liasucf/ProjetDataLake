    "text": "Sharp PC-E500S pocket computer A pocket computer was a 1980s-era user programmable calculator-sized computer that had fewer screen lines, Some had only one line and often fewer characters per line, than the Pocket-sized computers introduced beginning in 1989. Manufacturers included Casio, Hewlett- Packard, Sharp, Tandy/Radio Shack (selling Casio and Sharp models under their own TRS line) and many more. The last Sharp pocket computer, the PC-G850V (2001) is programmable in C, BASIC, and Assembler. An important feature of pocket computers was that all programming languages were available for the device itself, not downloaded from a cross-compiler on a larger computer. The programming language was usually BASIC. == See also == * Formula calculator * Mobile device * Programmable calculator * Smartbook == References == == External links == * Pocket Computer Museum * Soviet Calculators Collection (English) * www.calculators.de \u2013 Museum of Pocket Calculating Devices * List of pocket computers manufacturers * http://www.angelfire.com/planet/geraldk/Gdkpc4.htm * http://oldcomputers.net/ ",
