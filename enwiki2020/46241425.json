With her father and the young Leandro N. Alem, Andrade worked on \u00c1lbum po\u00e9tico argentino, released in 1877.

In 1878, she published the volume L\u00e1grimas, and the following year authored Flor de un d\u00eda. Her poems were praised by the likes of Benigno Tejeiro Mart\u00ednez and for their \"idealized romantic love\". In his Poes\u00edas (1877), the poet includes the poem, \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo vuelves \u00e1 tu patria? A mi simp\u00e1tica amiga Agustina Andrade (When will you return to your country? To my good friend, Agustina Andrade). Andrade's poem La F\u00e9 was described as a \"revelation\". ==Personal life== Andrade met the military officer Ram\u00f3n Lista (1856\u20131897), when he arrived to explore southern Argentina. In 1879, they married in Buenos Aires. Lista left the , where he became the second governor, while Andrade lived in T\u00e9mperley, about twenty kilometers from the city of Buenos Aires.

In 1890, Andrade learned that her husband maintained a parallel family in Patagonia with an indigenous Tehuelche woman called Koila, with whom he had a daughter.
