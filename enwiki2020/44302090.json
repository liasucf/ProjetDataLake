    "text": "Intel Core M is a family of ultra low-voltage microprocessors belonging to the Intel Core series and designed specifically for ultra-thin notebooks, 2-in-1 detachables, and other mobile devices. The thermal design power (TDP) of all Core M microprocessors is 4.5 watts or lower. Intel Core M microprocessors are fanless due to their low TDP. == Broadwell microarchitecture (5th generation) == === \"Broadwell-Y\" (SoC, dual-core, 14 nm) === * All models support: MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA3, Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology (EIST), Intel 64, XD bit (an NX bit implementation), Intel VT-x, Intel VT-d, Hyper-threading, Turbo Boost, AES-NI, Smart Cache. * All models except M-5Y10a and M-5Y70 support Configurable TDP. * M-5Y70 and M-5Y71 also support Intel vPro. * GPU and memory controller (up to 2 \u00d7 DDR3-1600) are integrated onto the processor die. * Peripherals include 12 lanes of PCI Express 2.0, in x4, x2, and x1 configurations. * Package size: 30 mm \u00d7 16.5 mm * Transistors: 1.3 billion * Die size: 82 mm\u00b2 == Skylake microarchitecture (6th generation) == === \"Skylake-Y\" (SoC, dual-core, 14 nm) === * All models support: MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA3, Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology (EIST), Intel 64, XD bit (an NX bit implementation), Intel VT-x, Intel VT-d, Hyper-threading, Turbo Boost, AES-NI, Smart Cache, Configurable TDP. * m5-6Y57 and m7-6Y75 also support Intel vPro, Intel TXT. * GPU and memory controller (up to 2 \u00d7 DDR3-1866) are integrated onto the processor die. * Peripherals include 10 lanes of PCI Express 3.0, in x4, x2, and x1 configurations. * Package size: 20 mm \u00d7 16.5 mm * Transistors: TBD * Die size: TBD == Kaby Lake microarchitecture (7th/8th generation) == === \"Kaby Lake-Y\" (SoC, dual-core, 14 nm) === Core m5 and Core m7 models were rebranded as Core i5 and Core i7. * All models support: MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA3, SGX, MPX, Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology (EIST), Intel 64, XD bit (an NX bit implementation), Intel VT-x, Intel VT-d, Hyper-threading, Turbo Boost, AES-NI, Smart Cache, Configurable TDP. * GPU and memory controller (up to 2 \u00d7 LPDDR3-1866) are integrated onto the processor die. * Peripherals include 10 lanes of PCI Express 3.0, in x4, x2, and x1 configurations. * Package size: 20 mm \u00d7 16.5 mm * Transistors: TBD * Die size: TBD === \"Amber Lake-Y\" (dual-core, 14 nm) === == See also == * System on a chip (SoC) == References == == External links == * Intel Core M Processors Product Order Code Table * Intel processor price list * Intel 14nm technology *Core M Intel Core M ",
