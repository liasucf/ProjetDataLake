    "text": "The 2018 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2017\u201318 season. The playoffs began on April 14, 2018 and ended on June 8 at the conclusion of the 2018 NBA Finals. ==Overview== * The Houston Rockets entered the playoffs with their best regular-season record in franchise history and appeared in their sixth consecutive postseason. * The Golden State Warriors entered their sixth consecutive postseason, tying their franchise streak of 6 straight postseason appearances since the league's first six years of existence (1946\u201347 to 1951\u201352). * The San Antonio Spurs entered their 21st consecutive postseason. * The Toronto Raptors also finished with a franchise record for single-season victories, winning 59 games and finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference. * The Minnesota Timberwolves qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2004 and snapped the league's longest active streak of seasons without a playoff appearance. * The Philadelphia 76ers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2012. * Game 7 between the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks ensured a 19th- straight postseason in which at least one Game 7 was played; 1999 was the most recent postseason to not feature a Game 7. * Game 6 of the Celtics-Bucks series was the last game played at the Bradley Center. * Game 2 of the Raptors vs Cavaliers series was the last game before the Air Canada Centre was renamed to Scotiabank Arena. * For the first time since 1979 both Conference Finals series went to a deciding Game 7. * In both Conference Finals series, the road teams won both Game 7s. In the other two instances in which both Conference Finals series went to a Game 7, the home team won each Conference Finals Game 7 in the 1963 and 1979 Playoffs. * This was also the first time a team was swept in the NBA Finals since 2007. Like in 2007, the Cleveland Cavaliers were also the team that got swept in the 2018 NBA Finals. ==Format== Within each conference, the eight teams with the most wins qualify for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record. Each conference's bracket is fixed; there is no reseeding. All rounds are best-of-seven series; the team that has four wins advances to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, are in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format. Home court advantage in any round does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead to the team with the better regular season record. If two teams with the same record meet in a round, standard tiebreaker rules are used. The rule for determining home court advantage in the NBA Finals is winning percentage, then head to head record, followed by intra-conference record. ==Playoff qualifying== On March 7, 2018, the Toronto Raptors became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. On March 30, 2018, the Houston Rockets clinched the Western Conference ending a three- year run by the Golden State Warriors as the top seed. The Rockets clinched the best record in the NBA a day later on March 31, 2018. For the first time since the 1996\u201397 NBA season, two teams played their last game against each other for the 8th and final spot in the playoffs. The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Denver Nuggets 112\u2013106 in overtime to clinch the final playoff seed in the West. This also ended Minnesota's 13-year drought without a playoff appearance having last played in 2003\u201304 season. For the first time since the 2010\u201311 NBA season, the Los Angeles Clippers would miss the postseason following a loss to the Denver Nuggets on April 7, 2018. This is the first time since 1960 that none of the teams from New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago made the playoffs. ===Eastern Conference=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Seed !!rowspan=2|Team !!rowspan=2|Record !!colspan=4|Clinched |- !Playoff berth !!
