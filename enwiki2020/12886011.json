    "text": "Ferry Rotinsulu (born 28 December 1982 in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia) is an retired Indonesian footballer. He plays as goalkeeper. He was a goalkeeper for the Indonesia national football team. In the Asian Cup 2007 Rotinsulu was the third goalkeeper after Yandri Pitoy and Markus Horison. He was also a former member of Indonesia U-23 Team at Sea Games 2005 Manila, Philippines, where he was the second choice goalkeeper after Syamsidar. \"I want to be the son of Palu with good contribution for nation by playing football. I wouldn't reach only halfway in my career. I want to be number one goalkeeper.\" Ferry said. He is a spider on the web that's difficult to be perforated by enemies, said Arjuna Rinaldi, Sriwijaya's goalkeeping coach. Trying to be consistent and determined, Ferry wants to bring his club to the top achievement. His efforts came to be paid when Sriwijaya won double titles as the champion of Liga Indonesia 2007 and Piala Indonesia 2007. He became one of the key players to the success of the team's double winners. Rotinsulu reportedly became a goalkeeper because he is a big fan of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Rotinsulu is a devout Muslim who observes the Islamic month of Ramadan. == International career == In 2007, he played to represent the Indonesia U-23, in 2007 SEA Games. ==National Team Career== *2005: SEA Games Manila (U-23 Team) *2006: National Training Centre/Camp in Den Haag, Netherlands and Asian Games Qatar (U-23 Team) *2007: Asian Cup (Senior Team) ==Honours== ===Club honors=== ;Sriwijaya *Liga Indonesia (1): 2007\u201308 *Indonesia Super League (1): 2011\u201312 *Piala Indonesia (3): 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309, 2010 *Indonesian Community Shield (1): 2010 *Indonesian Inter Island Cup (1): 2012 ===Country honors=== ;Indonesia *Indonesian Independence Cup (1): 2008 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Central Sulawesi Category:Indonesian Muslims Category:Indonesian footballers Category:2007 AFC Asian Cup players Category:Indonesia international footballers Category:People from Palu Category:Sriwijaya FC players Category:Persebaya Surabaya players Category:Liga 1 (Indonesia) players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Footballers at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games competitors for Indonesia ",
