However, the 2018 Winter Olympics saw the country's worst performance in terms of medals in 20 years. ==Participation== Winter sports are underrepresented by ethnic minorities due to the fact that such sports are expensive to play. ==Events== * Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, an annual long-distance sled dog race run in early March from Anchorage to Nome, entirely in the state of Alaska ==References== Category:Sports in the United States ",
