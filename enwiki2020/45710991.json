    "text": "Jan B\u00f6hmermann () (born 23 February 1981) is a German satirist and television presenter. He has also worked as a comedy writer and producer. ==Early life and education== B\u00f6hmermann was born and raised in Bremen. He enrolled to study history, sociology and theatre in Cologne, but dropped out before long. Previously, B\u00f6hmermann had applied to drama schools in Berlin, Hamburg and Munich; he was rejected by all three. He was accepted at a fourth drama school in Hannover, but did not enroll. In 1997, B\u00f6hmermann was hired as a columnist at the Bremen daily newspaper Die Norddeutsche. He joined Radio Bremen as a presenter in 1999, where he also had a stint as a comedy writer. In 2015, he became known internationally for the satirical music video V for Varoufakis about the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. The clip is from B\u00f6hmermann's late-night show Neo Magazin Royale. His satirical rap song \"Ich hab Polizei\" peaked at #10 in the German charts. However, the song also caused considerable controversy: Journalists and rappers accused him of mocking lower-class people and also condoning police violence. In 2016 he and Olli Schulz hosted a talk show called Schulz & B\u00f6hmermann, which is based on a former show B\u00f6hmermann co-hosted with Charlotte Roche in 2012. ==Controversies== B\u00f6hmermann in Rostock, 2014 ===\"V for Varoufakis\" video=== In February 2015, B\u00f6hmermann's late-night show Neo Magazin Royale created the song and music video \"V for Varoufakis\". The title references V for Vendetta, which introduced the Guy Fawkes mask as a symbol of rebellion. In addition to poking fun at Germans generally, the video explored the German fascination with Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is regarded as articulate, physically attractive and having a stylish, if unconventional fashion sense, while also portraying Greece's dependence on German money during the Greek government-debt crisis. Unlike most content on the ZDF program Neo Magazin Royale, the song is in English and not in German. The conclusion of the video shows an actual clip of Varoufakis in which he says \"and stick the finger to Germany, and say 'well, you can now solve this problem for yourself'. Right?\" The clip shows Varoufakis giving the finger, a gesture called \"Stinkefinger\" in German. This clip had been taken out of context: Varoufakis had used a rhetorical example of what not to do. After TV host G\u00fcnther Jauch confronted Varoufakis with the video clip in an interview (still out of context), German news media made the issue of Varoufakis giving Germany the finger into a minor scandal. The New York Times ran an article with the title \"German Media Want Greek Finance Minister\u2019s Head Over \u2018Fingergate\u2019\". Varoufakis himself briefly claimed that the video must have been doctored. NZZ am Sonntag called for G\u00fcnther Jauch to be fired for bad journalism. In response to the claims of the middle finger being either fake or real, B\u00f6hmermann's Neo Magazine Royale created a false version of the video clip labelled #varoufake, which claimed to show that Varoufakis had not given the finger, and that the clip Neo Magazine Royale had used in \"V for Varoufakis\" was indeed a fabrication. At 8:10 in the video, B\u00f6hmermann says the following: This passage of the #varoufake video caused confusion, BBC interpreted it as an admittal that the video in which the finger was given was the original footage. However, this quote is more likely meant to say that the editors of G\u00fcnther Jauch did not edit the footage, because as explained in the rest of the video, the editors of NEO Magazine Royal edited it. The media were unclear as to which version was unmanipulated, and ZDF had to officially state that Neo Magazin Royale is satire and should not be taken at face value. Varoufakis himself praised B\u00f6hmermann's mockery of the German media on Twitter, writing \"@janboehm Humour, satire & self deprecation are great solvents of blind nationalism. We politicians need you badly.\" B\u00f6hmermann won a Grimme-Preis award for the manipulated finger video. ===Erdogan satire=== Twenty people lodged a complaint because of a poem named \"Schm\u00e4hkritik\" (\"abusive criticism\") B\u00f6hmermann presented in his satire show Neo Magazin Royale that aired on the ZDF public channel on 31 March 2016. The proceedings instituted by the prosecutor's office for \"insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states\" are based on principles \u00a7103 and \u00a7104 in the German penal code. B\u00f6hmermann, among other things, called Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"the man who beats girls\", and said that Erdogan loved to \"fuck goats and suppress minorities, kick Kurds, hit Christians, and watch child pornography.\" Much of the rest of the poem is devoted to associating Erdogan with various less accepted forms of sexuality. B\u00f6hmermann deliberately played with the limits of satire and said several times that this form of abusive criticism was not allowed in Germany. The poem was released two weeks after the German political satire TV show extra 3 had aired a critical song about Erdogan, which led to protests of the Turkish government.Extra 3 schie\u00dft schon wieder gegen Erdogan, Focus, in German The ZDF channel distanced itself from the poem and cut it out of the program which can be seen in its internet archives \"Mediathek.\"T\u00fcrkei fordert Strafverfahren gegen B\u00f6hmermann, Die Welt, in German After a phone call with the Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the poem as \"intentionally hurtful\" (\"bewusst verletzend\"), and prosecutors in Mainz planned to consult the federal Justice Ministry on whether to launch criminal proceedings. The Turkish government released a verbal note in which it demanded the criminal prosecution of B\u00f6hmermann. According to the law, the government has to approve the demand for criminal prosecution by a foreign government, before criminal proceedings can be started because of \u00a7103/104 StGB.Fall B\u00f6hmermann: Regierung pr\u00fcft T\u00fcrkei-Forderung , heute, in GermanSchm\u00e4hgedicht \u00fcber Erdogan: Der Moderator und der Schah-Paragraf, Der Spiegel, in German Therefore Angela Merkel accepted the request from Turkey to seek his prosecution, but stressed that the acceptance was not due to the merits of the prosecution case. In addition, Erdogan himself made a complaint against B\u00f6hmermann as a private person because of the alleged insult. The vice minister president of Turkey, Numan Kurtulmus, called the poem a \"serious crime against humanity\". On 10 April the CEO of publishing house Axel Springer SE, Mathias D\u00f6pfner, made a plea for \"solidarity with Jan B\u00f6hmermann.\" He compared B\u00f6hmermann's poem to the works of Martin Kippenberger. He also referenced Michel Houellebecq's Submission and accused the German government of kowtowing to the Turks. The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote on Twitter: \"Europe first lost its soul (agreement with Turkey on refugees), now it is losing its humour. Hands off @janboehm!\" More than 100,000 people signed a petition for B\u00f6hmermann at Change.org.Schimpf oder Schande, Der Tagesspiegel, in German In a satirical letter to president Erdogan, the mayor of T\u00fcbingen, Boris Palmer (Alliance 90/The Greens), assured Erdogan his \"solidarity\" and demanded the extradition of B\u00f6hmermann to Turkey. \"Cut off B\u00f6hmermann's testicles, so he never makes fun of presidents with a short dick again\", he wrote. The letter is signed \"most respectfully, Boris Palmer\".Palmer macht sich f\u00fcr Auslieferung B\u00f6hmermanns stark, Die Welt, in German A YouGov poll revealed on 12 April, that a majority of the Germans supported B\u00f6hmermanns position. 48 percent of the pollees found the poem appropriate, 29 percent view it as undue. A great majority (66 percent) opposed the deletion of the poem on the ZDF website as well as Merkel's criticism of the poem as \"intentionally hurtful\" (68 percent). Only 15% support a criminal investigation, with 77% against. On 12 April it was reported that B\u00f6hmermann was under police protection, because he was threatened by supporters of Erdogan. The filming of the upcoming edition of Neo Magazin Royale was cancelled due to \"massive media reporting and the focus on the programme and the presenter\". B\u00f6hmermann had also cancelled his radio show Sanft & Sorgf\u00e4ltig on Sunday and his appearance at the Grimme Awards, where he was awarded for his Varoufakis video. In October 2016, the prosecutors dropped the case, saying they had not found sufficient evidence to continue the inquiry against Jan Boehmermann. The rarely used paragraph 103 of Germany's penal code, which criminalizes insults against foreign heads of state, under which B\u00f6hmermann was indicted, was subsequently abolished in 2018.https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article172081058/103-StGB- Deutschland-schafft-die-Majestaetsbeleidigung-endgueltig-ab.html ==Works== ===Radio=== * 1999\u20132004: Radio Bremen * 2009\u20132011: Die ganz gro\u00dfe Jan B\u00f6hmermann Radioschau * 2010\u20132013: Lateline * 2011\u20132012: Zwei alte Hasen erz\u00e4hlen von fr\u00fcher, with Klaas Heufer-Umlauf * 2012: Joko und Klaas mit Olli und Jan, with Olli Schulz * 2012\u20132016: Sanft & Sorgf\u00e4ltig, with Olli Schulz ===Podcast=== * 2012 - 2016 Sanft & Sorgf\u00e4ltig , with Olli Schulz * since 2016: Fest & Flauschig (Spotify), with Olli Schulz ===Television=== * 2007: Echt B\u00f6hmermann (WDR Fernsehen) * 2009: TV Helden (RTL) * 2012: Roche & B\u00f6hmermann (ZDFkultur), with Charlotte Roche * 2012\u20132013: Lateline (EinsPlus) * 2013\u20132014: Neo Magazin (ZDFneo) * 2014: Was w\u00e4re, wenn?
