    "text": "The Bursa Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art () is a museum located in the former medrese of Ye\u015fil Complex, which was constructed within the order of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed I in 1419. ==History== The history of the museum dates back to 1904 when the first museum in Bursa was founded at Bursa Boys' Highschool to exhibit Islamic/Ottoman relics and archeological foundings which were unearthed within city's administrative boundaries. In 1929, the exhibit was moved to the present-day location of Bursa Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art. With a new building being prepared for the archeological displays in 1971, the original place within the Ye\u015fil Complex remained a museum for Turkish and Islamic art. ==See also== * Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum * Ye\u015fil T\u00fcrbe * Bursa Treasure * List of Art Museums == References == Category:National museums in Turkey Category:Art museums and galleries in Turkey Category:Decorative arts museums Turkish Category:Islamic museums Category:Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, Bursa ",
