A Democratic MP named Moon Hak-jin mentioned that \"from his harassment, perhaps he fears Park\". Another MP named Yoo Sun-ho criticised his statement as \"it is such as using viruses to kill vaccines\". === Sinking of MV Sewol === On 16 April 2019, Cha faced a huge protests following his defamatory remarks against the bereaved family of MV Sewol tragedy. The previous day, he posted on Facebook that \"they use their children's death till f***ed up\". He also stated that \"they're keep passing the buck to Park Geun-hye and Hwang Kyo-ahn but both of them are NOT related to the incident... maybe because they were brainwashed by left-wing bastards\".
