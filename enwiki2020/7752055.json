    "text": "Community-painted anti-meth mural in Drummond, Montana The Montana Meth Project (MMP) is a Montana-based non-profit organization founded by businessman Thomas Siebel which seeks to reduce methamphetamine use, particularly among teenagers. The main venture of the MMP is a saturation- level advertising campaign of television, radio, print, and Internet ads that graphically depict the negative consequences of methamphetamine use. Common elements are the deterioration of each teenage subject's health and living conditions, amphetamine psychosis, moral compromise, and regret. As of 2010, the Meth Project has expanded its media campaign into seven additional states.About Us , Montana Meth Project As of March 13, 2013 the Meth Project, the umbrella organization of the Montana Meth Project, joined the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids in their efforts to reduce substance abuse among teens.Meth Project Foundation joins Partnership at Drugfree.org, The Montana Standard March 13, 2013 ==Effectiveness of the ads== A new study was published in the Journal of Marketing Research validating the effectiveness of the Meth Project\u2019s advertising in deterring substance abuse. The study was authored by researchers at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.How Disgust Enhances the Effectiveness of Fear Appeals, Journal of Marketing Research, March, 2012 The researchers tested the effectiveness of several advertisements\u2014including the Meth Project\u2019s\u2014and found that ads that relied on fear alone to convey their message did not lead to immediate changes in attitudes or behavior. However, according to the study, the Meth Project ads that incorporated an element of \u201cdisgust,\u201d such as rotting teeth, skin sores or infections, did compel viewers to \u201cundertake distancing behaviors,\u201d such as deciding not to use illegal drugs. The study concludes that, \"notably, the disgust and fear appeal condition in this study used an actual advertisement from the Montana Meth Project, a nationally recognized, award- winning program that uses high-impact advertising to reduce methamphetamine use . . . It was only the disgust-inducing fear appeal [the Meth Project ad] that significantly reduced future drug use, making it more effective in terms of persuasion and compliance.\u201d While the effectiveness of the campaign at reducing methamphetamine use is disputed,Success Of Anti-meth Ads Questioned By Study , ScienceDaily, December 11, 2008Benefits of graphic anti-meth ads questioned , Reuters, December 19, 2008 in 2010, the Meth Project was named the third most effective philanthropy in the world,The 25 Best Givers , Barron's 2010, December 4, 2010 up from #5 in 2009 on Barron's yearly rankings.The Top 25 Best Philanthropists , Barron's 2009, November 28, 2009Meth Project Foundation gets high Barron\u2019s rank , Billings Gazette, November 30, 2009 In its efforts to effectively reach teens and change attitudes and behaviors toward meth, the MMP regularly conducts focus group research to refine its messaging and better understand how to connect with the state's youth.Don\u2019t Allow Methamphetamine to Ruin Your Life, Psychology Today, September 2, 2009 HBO has also partnered with the MMP on a documentary as part of its Addiction series. Two surveys have been conducted that have investigated methamphetamine use amongst teenagers in Montana before and after the launch of the Meth Project's ads.Statement of David Erceg-Hurn to Governor Schweitzer and Montana Legislature regarding funding of Montana Meth Project in 2009 budget, February 09, 2009 The first survey is the CDC's youth risk behavior survey (YBRS). The YRBS data are listed below. YRBS Data - Percentage of Montana Teens who have ever used meth: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! 1999 ! 2001 ! 2003 ! 2005 ! 2007 ! 2009 |- | 13.5% | 12.6% | 9.3% | 8.3% | 4.6% | 3.1% |- |} The YRBS data indicates that teenage meth use in Montana has declined since the Meth Project\u2019s ad campaign was launched in 2005. The absolute drop in meth use since the ad campaign was introduced in 2005 is 5.2% - larger than any prior four-year period.2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey , Montana Office of Public Instruction However, the YRBS data also shows that meth use was dropping for at least 6 years prior to the launch of the ad campaign. The other survey of teen meth use has been conducted by the Meth Project. The data from the Meth Project's survey are listed below. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! 2005 ! 2006 ! 2007 ! 2008 |- | 2% | 6% | 4% | 3% |- |} According to the MMP's figures, before the ad campaign (2005), only 2% of teenagers had ever used meth. Six months after the launch of the ad campaign (2006), 6% reported using meth. In contrast to the YRBS data, the MMP's figures indicate that the percentage of teenagers using meth in Montana increased following the launch of the ad campaign. By 2008, 3% of teenagers reported using meth, still more than before the ad campaign commenced. However, the 2005 and 2006 MMP figures were based on un-weighted data that was tabulated from a total of 329 and 419 survey participants, respectively.2005 Montana Meth Use and Attitudes Survey 2006 Montana Meth Use and Attitudes Survey In contrast, the 2007 and 2008 MMP data was weighted and compiled from 2,335 and 2,334 participants, respectively.2007 Montana Meth Use and Attitudes Survey 2008 Montana Meth Use and Attitudes Survey In press materials, the Meth Project commonly cites YRBS figure of a 45% decrease in meth use between 2005 and 2007. However the absolute drop for the period was 3.7%. In contrast, the Meth Project's own data for the same period show a 2% absolute increase in meth use, or a 100% relative increase. The 2009 YRBS results for Montana showed meth use declining an additional 32% to 3.1%, or a total reduction of 62%. According to a 2007 Montana State Office of Public Instruction Report,Montana State Office of Public Instruction Report since the inception of the program in 2005, there has also been a 72% relative decrease in adult methamphetamine use, and a 62% relative decline in methamphetamine-related crimes.The Meth Project Fact Sheet Additionally, the percentage of teenagers who are aware of meth\u2019s dangers increased from 25% to 93%, and Montana\u2019s ranking among U.S. states in meth abuse fell from #5 to #39.Catalytic Philanthropy , Stanford Social Innovation Review, Fall 2009 ===Office of National Drug Control Policy report=== In November 2006, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) published a report, Pushing Back Against Meth: A Progress Report on the Fight,Pushing Back Against Meth: A Progress Report on the Fight Against Methamphetamine in the United States , Office of National Drug Control Policy, November 30, 2006 highlighting the impact of recently enacted State and Federal laws, such as the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA) of 2005, that restricted transactions for the over the counter drugs that can be used to manufacture methamphetamine. Based on the results of Quest Diagnostics' preliminary review of workplace drug tests conducted during the first five months of 2006, the nationwide adult usage of meth declined by 12% when compared to the same period in 2005. Quest provided state-level results: on the state level, results varied according to the strictness and duration of the states' laws. \"Montana\u2019s methamphetamine precursor law went into effect July 1, 2005. The Montana law is stricter than the CMEA in several important respects.\" Montana\u2019s workplace drug testing results showed a 69.4% decrease in positive tests for amphetamine.

April, 2008. and the MMP attribute Montana's decrease in adult meth usage to the MMP. However, the ONDCP reported: \"The primary reason for this positive trend is the enactment of various State laws...which implemented restrictions on transactions involving products containing certain chemicals (primarily, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine) that can be used to make methamphetamine.\" However, the Attorney General countered, \"The Montana Meth Project\u2019s theoretical framework is based upon the prevention principles that individuals who believe that the use of a particular drug involves risk or harm and/or who disapprove of its use are less likely to use that drug. As seen in last year\u2019s report, both the Montana Prevention Needs Assessment and the Meth Use & Attitudes Survey show that Montana teens perceive a much greater risk in trying meth than do their counterparts nationally. Since 2005, the perception of specific negative effects resulting from meth use has changed. Among teens, risks such as stealing, lack of attention to personal hygiene, and tooth decay increased significantly (11%, 7.5%, and 19% respectively). In this time, societal disapproval of meth use has also greatly increased in the state, with teens (87%), young adults (83%) and parents (97%) now voicing \u201cstrong\u201d disapproval of trying meth even once or twice. Perhaps most importantly, parent-child discussions about the dangers posed by meth use have increased in number and frequency.\" ===Prevention Science critical review=== A critical review of the Montana Meth Project's advertising campaign was published in the peer-review journal Prevention Science in December 2008. The review examined the Meth Project's statistical methodology and data reporting. The review found that the Meth Project had selectively reported their research findings, focusing on unrepresentative positive findings and ignoring data suggesting that the campaign may be associated with harmful outcomes. The review found that the Meth Project's data suggests that exposure to the graphic ads may lead to an increase in the percentage of teenagers who believe that taking meth is socially acceptable and not dangerous. Such 'boomerang' effects in response to persuasive, graphic ads are not uncommon, and are predicted by the theory of psychological reactance. The critical review found that the selective reporting of results by the Meth Project has led the media, politicians and the public to form distorted and inaccurate beliefs about the campaign's effectiveness. The public believes that the ad campaign is far more effective than the Meth Project's research findings indicate. The main recommendation of the review was that public funding and additional 'roll-outs' of the program should cease until its effectiveness can be scientifically examined. The review concluded: \"Politicians, the media, and prevention researchers also need to ensure that in future they critically evaluate any research released by the MMP, rather than assuming the organization\u2019s press releases (and reports) are presenting data in a fair and balanced way. It is recommended that any future reports documenting the results of MMP\u2019s use and attitudes surveys include complete statistical analyses for every question in the survey. This is because researchers and policymakers making decisions about MMP-style graphic advertising campaigns need access to all evidence, rather than a subset of findings that portray the MMP in a positive light.\u201d ==Government funding and expansion== Many in the Montana state legislature hailed the project as an unprecedented success, and moved to fund the previously privately funded project with tax dollars.An expensive habit: State pledges $2 million to Montana Meth Project , Missoula Independent, April 19, 2007 The move to provide public funding for the Meth Project was opposed by some legislators and drug prevention and treatment professionals, who asserted that the Meth Project's effectiveness is unproven and that research shows that these type of media campaigns are ineffective. However, the Bush Administration praised the MMP as a \"model for the nation.\"Press Release - White House Cites Montana Meth Project as Model For The Nation As of 2009, the campaign has expanded to include the Arizona Meth Project, Idaho Meth Project, Illinois Meth Project, Wyoming Meth Project, Colorado Meth Project, and Hawaii Meth Project. The Georgia Meth Project was founded in 2009 with a planned launch in early 2010. The governor of Montana, Brian Schweitzer, announced that he would review public funding for the Meth Project in early 2009, as a result of a critical review of the Meth Project published in an academic journal, which called for public funding of the Meth Project to be put on hold.Governor Wants More Information on Meth Project Study , Associated Press, December 19, 2008 (originally here )Meth Project Study Author Declines Visit , by Matt Gouras (Associated Press), Great Falls Tribune, December 20, 2008 (originally here ) In February 2009, the Montana legislature came under increased pressure to withdraw funding to the Meth Project after an analysis of Meth Project tax forms revealed that the Project spends large amounts of money on staff salaries and website costs. In May 2009, Schweitzer chose not to support an additional $500,000 proposed by state legislators for 2009-10, \"given the economically difficult times,\" and stated that the Project would have to become \"self-supporting\" in the future.Veto Pen: Schweitzer Cuts Some Meth Project Funding and Welcome Home Program , May 14, 2009 The Project was granted $500,000 for the next budget period. ==March Against Meth== The March Against Meth was a demonstration and rally in Helena, Montana on February 16, 2009. Over 2,300 students of all ages from across Montana marched from Helena High School to the Capitol where they delivered over 55,000 signatures of Montanans requesting funding from the Montana legislature for the project. It was the largest youth demonstration in Montana's history. The Meth Project and its supporters requested $2 million in state funding to continue to bring the \"Not Even Once\" message to Montana teens.Montana Meth Project MAM Release , Montana Meth ProjectHelena IR 21609 , Montana Meth Project The March was criticized by some Montanans, who suggested some teenagers were lured to attend due to free giveaways of iPods and the presence of a blackhawk helicopter.Montana Meth Project , Electric City Weblog, January 1, 2009 The Montana media were also criticized for preannouncing the rally as a success before it had even taken place.More Montana Meth PR Before the Rally: The Gazette Pre-Announces a Successful Rally! , Intelligent Discontent, February 16, 2009 ==Paint the State== Paint the State is a public art competition initiated by The Meth Project. The large-scale community action program, launched in MontanaPaint the State Montana Paint the State Montana and IdahoPaint the State Idaho Paint the State Idaho in 2010, empowers teenagers to create artwork with a strong anti-Meth message that is clearly visible to the general public. Contestants are asked to use the Meth Project\u2019s \u201cMeth: Not Even Once\u201d tagline, logo or any other anti-Meth theme, to create art of any style and medium. The current 2010 campaigns are modeled after Montana\u2019s largely successful Paint the State 2006Paint the State 2006 Paint the State 2006 contest, which inspired art from every county in the state for a total of over 650 works of art. The overwhelming response made Paint the State the largest public art contest in history. Entries in 2006 featured 12 languages, 47 art vehicles, 78 T-shirts, over 380 banners and flags and even a painted sheep. ==See also== *Faces of Meth ==References== ===Sources=== *Montana Meth Project: Message heard, results debated, Ed Kemmick, Billings Gazette, Sunday, July 5, 2009 *$20M spent in anti-meth campaign, Ed Kemmick, Billings Gazette, Sunday, July 5, 2009 *State's Largest Demonstration Captured in Meth Project Documentary Helena Independent Record, April 21, 2009 * Study Questions Value of Anti-Meth Campaign.
