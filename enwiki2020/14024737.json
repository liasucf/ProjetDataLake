    "text": "In enzymology, a magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + magnesium protoporphyrin IX \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + magnesium protoporphyrin IX 13-methyl ester The two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and magnesium protoporphyrin IX; its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and magnesium protoporphyrin IX 13-methyl ester. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:magnesium-protoporphyrin-IX O-methyltransferase. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to chlorophylls. ==See also== * Biosynthesis of chlorophylls ==References== * * * * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
