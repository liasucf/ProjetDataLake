    "text": "\"The new Hewlett-Packard 9100A personal computer\" is \"ready, willing, and able... to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer.\" The Hewlett- Packard 9100A (hp 9100A) is an early programmable calculatorSee Old Calculator Museum definition at the end of cited page (note with asterisk) * (or computer), first appearing in 1968. HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Bill Hewlett said, \"If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an IBM. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared.\" An ad for the 9100A in 1968 Science magazine contains one of the earliest documented use (as of 2000) of the phrase personal computer. == History == Electronic calculator prototype, made by Thomas E. Osborne for Hewlett-Packard, 1964, in the National Museum of American History The unit was descended from a prototype produced by engineer Thomas \"Tom\" E. Osborne, who joined the company when HP decided to adopt the project.\"How the Model 9100A Was Developed\", Bernard M. Oliver, September 1968, Hewlett-Packard Journal]1994 letter from Tom Osborne to Barney Oliver, hp9825.com An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any integrated circuits, the assembly of the CPU having been entirely executed in discrete components. With CRT readout, magnetic card storage, and printer, the price was around $5,000 ($ today). The 9100A was the first scientific calculator by the modern definition, i.e., capable of trigonometric, logarithmic (log/ln), and exponential functions, and was the beginning of Hewlett-Packard's long history of using Reverse Polish notation (RPN) entry on their calculators. Due to the similarities of the machines, Hewlett-Packard was ordered to pay about $900,000 in royalties to Olivetti after copying some of the solutions adopted in the Programma 101, like the magnetic card and the architecture. == See also == *HP-35 *CORDIC == References == == External links == * Hosted at the Computer History Museum. * * * Steven Leibson interview of Tom Osborne 9100a ",
