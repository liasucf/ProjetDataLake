    "text": "Presidential elections were held in the United States of Colombia in 1876. The result was a victory for Aquileo Parra of the Liberal Party.Colombia: Elecciones Presidenciales de 1826 a 1990 Political Database of the Americas ==Electoral system== The 1863 constitution changed the electoral system from a direct vote to an indirect vote. The President was now elected on the basis of which candidate received the most votes in each state, with a candidate required to win in at least five of the nine states to be elected. If no candidate received a majority, Congress would elect the President from the main contenders.Elections and Events 1850-1899 The Library, UC San Diego ==Results== The electors were elected in 1875. In Cauca Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez won a majority of the vote, but the election jury refused to recognise his victory. However, it also refused to give its college vote to Parra, and so announced that the state's electors would not take part in the presidential ballot.James William Park (1986) \"Regionalism as a factor in Colombia's 1875 election\", The Americas, Vol. 42, pp453\u2013472 For the first time, no candidate won a majority of states, and as a result, Congress elected the President on 21 February. {| class=wikitable !Candidate !Party !States won !Congressional vote |- |align=left|Aquileo Parra||align=left|Liberal Party||align=right|4||align=right|48 |- |align=left|Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez||align=left|Liberal Party||align=right|2||align=right|18 |- |align=left|Bartolom\u00e9 Calvo||align=left|Conservative Party||align=right|2||align=right|18 |- |align=left colspan=2|Did not vote||align=right|1||align=right|\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||align=right|9||align=right|84 |- |align=left colspan=4|Source: Park, The Library |} ==References== Category:1876 elections in South America 1876 Category:1876 in Colombia ",
