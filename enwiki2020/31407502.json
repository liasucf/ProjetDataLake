Montgomery recorded the save in Game 7 of the Cubs' 2016 World Series championship. ==Professional career== ===Kansas City Royals=== Montgomery was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the first round, with the 36th selection, of the 2008 MLB draft out of William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California. In 2012, he posted a combined record of 5\u201312 in 27 starts while splitting the season between the Royals' Double A and Triple A clubs. On November 20, 2012, the Royals added Montgomery to the 40-man roster in anticipation of the upcoming Rule 5 Draft of Minor League players. ===Tampa Bay Rays=== On December 9, 2012, Montgomery was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays (along with Jake Odorizzi, Patrick Leonard, and Wil Myers) in exchange for James Shields and Wade Davis. He was optioned to AAA on March 11, 2013. ===Seattle Mariners=== On March 31, 2015, Montgomery was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Erasmo Ram\u00edrez. After an injury sidelined James Paxton, the Mariners called Montgomery up to the majors for the first time on June 2, 2015. He started that night against the New York Yankees at Safeco Field, giving up one run, four hits, and walking two while striking out four and leaving after six innings with a 2\u20131 lead. He was on track to earn his first major league win, but the Mariners lost the game. On June 23, 2015, Montgomery became the first Mariners left-handed pitcher to ever throw a complete game shutout with 10 strikeouts and no walks, getting the win against the Kansas City Royals 7\u20130. Following his first career complete game shutout, Montgomery pitched his second consecutive shutout on June 30, 2015. He allowed one hit, a double in the 7th inning, to the San Diego Padres in a 5\u20130 win. He is the first Mariners pitcher since Freddy Garc\u00eda in 2001 to throw complete game shutouts in consecutive starts. On August 30, 2015, Montgomery was sent back down to the Tacoma Rainiers. He made the Mariners' opening day roster in 2016 as a reliever. ===Chicago Cubs=== ====2016 Season==== On July 20, 2016, the Seattle Mariners traded Montgomery and prospect Jordan Pries to the Chicago Cubs for prospects Dan Vogelbach and Paul Blackburn. After allowing a three-run home run to the first batter he faced as a Cub, Montgomery performed well during the remainder of the season. He pitched in 17 games (including five starts), with a 2.82 ERA with the Cubs. Montgomery had a strong postseason performance in 2016, playing an instrumental role in the team's championship run. Cumulatively he went 1-1, including 11 appearances, innings pitched, and a 3.14 ERA. Most notably, Montgomery relieved Carl Edwards Jr. in the bottom of the 10th inning in Game 7 of the World Series. With a runner on first base and two outs in a one-run game, he finished the game with a ground out to third base. Montgomery earned his first career save, winning the World Series for the Chicago Cubs for the first time in 108 years.Mike Montgomery pitches the final out in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series. ====2017 Season==== Montgomery continued to perform well in 2017, with 44 appearances (14 starts), and a 3.38 ERA for the season. His record was 7-8, along with three saves. His performance through mid-May was exceptional, with his ERA dropping to 1.08. After gradually rising to 4.01 in mid-July, it leveled out in the remainder of the season. Of note, Montgomery hit his first career home run off Atlanta Braves pitcher R.A. Dickey on July 19.
