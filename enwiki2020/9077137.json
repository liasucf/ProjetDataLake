    "text": "Hoher Meissner transmitter is a facility for FM and TV broadcasting on Hoher Meissner mountain in Northern Hesse. The transmitter was inaugurated in 1952. The mediumwave transmission at the transmitter used a 150 metre tall guyed steel-tube mast radiator insulated against ground between 1952 and 1995. The mast was replaced by a 155 metre tall guyed lattice steel mast at which was switched off in December 2009 due to funding reasons and demolished on 16 March 2015. In opposite to the old mast radiator, the tower was grounded and equipped with a cage antenna for mediumwave. Another mediumwave transmitter which is a 95 metre tall guyed steel-tube mast radiator is located at . The mast was first used to form together with the 150 metre tall steel-tube mast radiator as a directional antenna with a minimum pointing toward Sweden and as backup antenna. Until the demolition of its main mediumwave transmitter in 2015, the transmitter was used for the latter purpose as the Hoher Meissner mediumwave transmitter, which formed together with Weiskirchen transmitter as a single frequency transmitter, which operated permanently with omnidirectional radiation pattern. FM and TV broadcasts are transmitted using a 220 metre tall guyed lattice steel mast with a weight of 180 tons. The mast is at . Further there at is a 40 metre tall free-standing lattice tower at Hoher Meissner transmitter, which is used for mobile radio services and equipped with a backup antenna for FM transmission. ==Radio stations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !Station !Frequency !ERP !Remarks |- |hr-info |594 kHz |100 kW |single frequency network with Weiskirchen transmitter |- |hr1 |99,0 MHz |100 kW | |- |hr2 |95,5 MHz |100 kW | |- |hr3 |89,5 MHz |100 kW | |- |hr4 |101,7 MHz |100 kW |Local program for Northern and Eastern Hesse |- |Hit Radio FFH |105,1 MHz |100 kW |Local program for Northern Hesse |} ==References== ==External links== * Overview of facility * List of transmitted programmes * FM-/TV-transmission mast of Hoher Meissner transmitter at Skyscraperpage * Mediumwave transmission mast of Hoher Meissner transmitter at Skyscraperpage * Backup mediumwave transmission mast of Hoher Meissner transmitter at Skyscraperpage * Backup FM-transmission tower of Hoher Meissner transmitter at Skyscraperpage Category:Radio masts and towers in Germany Category:1952 establishments in Germany Category:Towers completed in 1952 ",
