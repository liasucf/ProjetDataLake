This episode continued in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Conventions\". ==Synopsis== The episode begins with university students watching a comedian (Jonathan Silverman) doing his gig in a comedy club. The comedian starts joking about rape. When the comedian humiliates a girl (Skyler Day) who is protesting against him two boys sexually assault her. The girl reports the crime to Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) who then investigates. The comedian, Josh Galloway, ends up inviting the SVU detectives to his next gig and he verbally abuses them during the gig. When the comedian starts talking about the sex he had with a student, she then reports him to Olivia. Amanda Rollins and Nick Amaro (Kelli Giddish and Danny Pino) learn that there was a previous victim who isn't willing to come forward. When Rafael Barba (Raul Esparza) puts Galloway on trial, Galloway uses the trial as material. Galloway is eventually set up by the girl he humiliated where she manages to record him sexually assaulting her and he takes a plea deal of ten years on the sex offenders registry. As Olivia is finishing her work, Chicago detective Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush) walks in looking a file on a rapist, Erin is surprised when Olivia passes on the kind words Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) said about her. ==Production== Sophia Bush appears in this episode as Erin Lindsey It was announced that Chicago P.D. star Sophia Bush was going to appear as her character Erin Lindsay.

And obviously there was the Tosh incident, was I think one of the more public and egregious incidents in which he decided wouldn\u2019t it be funny if he \u2013 someone was heckling him and he got into it with her. And said wouldn\u2019t it be funny if you were \u2013 if these guys gang raped you right here? And, you know, at SVU we don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny. And then there was Dane Cook had certain jokes.\" ==Reception== The episode received 7.78 million viewers. The Pop Break wrote \"Oh, SVU why did you have to do this?
