    "text": "The Nordic Cup (; ) was a cup competition for club teams from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden staged on one occasion, starting in June 1959 and ending on 31 July 1962. ==Summary== In December 1958, the group St\u00e6vnet proposed a cup competition for club teams from the Nordic countries at a Scandinavian football conference in Copenhagen, which was decided and 16 teams were invited. The teams responding to the invitation were IFK Norrk\u00f6ping, Djurg\u00e5rden, IFK G\u00f6teborg, GAIS, Malm\u00f6 FF, H\u00e4lsingborg, and AIK from Sweden, Viking FK, Skeid, and Fredrikstad from Norway, and Vejle, KB, AB, Frem, and Skovshoved from Denmark, while the Finnish teams only wanted to join as a combination team, which initially was rejected. Initially the final was scheduled to be played in autumn 1960, but the participating team had problems finding match days and the semi-finals were rescheduled to spring 1961. The Nordic cup saw low attendances. On 31 July 1962, the first edition of the cup ended with a final on Stockholm Olympic Stadium between Djurg\u00e5rden of Stockholm and the Helsinki-Alliance, which the Helsinki team won with 1\u20130 on a penalty in first half, and won the trophy donated by Scandinavian Airlines. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | AB | Vejle | AIK | IFK G\u00f6teborg |- | Frem | Helsinki-Alliance | Djurg\u00e5rden | IFK Norrk\u00f6ping |- | KB | Fredrikstad | GAIS | Malm\u00f6 FF |- | Skovshoved | Skeid | H\u00e4lsingborg | \u00d6rgryte |} ==Results== ===Round of 16=== ====Matches==== \u00d6rgryte won 4\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- KB won 4\u20133 on aggregate. \\---- IFK Norrk\u00f6ping won 9\u20133 on aggregate. \\---- AIK won 6\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- Helsinki-Alliance won 3\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- Malm\u00f6 FF won 5\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Frem won 5\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Djurg\u00e5rden won 8\u20131 on aggregate. ===Quarter-finals=== Originally, the matches were supposed to be played before 15 November 1959. ====Matches==== Helsinki-Alliance won on coin flipping. \\---- Djurg\u00e5rden won 2\u20130 on aggregate. \\---- IFK Norrk\u00f6ping won 11\u20134 on aggregate. \\---- Frem won 4\u20132 on aggregate. ===Semi-finals=== ====Matches==== Djurg\u00e5rden won 7\u20133 on aggregate. \\---- Helsinki-Alliance won 5\u20132 on aggregate. ===Final=== ==See also== *Royal League ==References== Category:Defunct international club association football competitions in Europe Category:Sport in Scandinavia Category:1959 in Danish football Category:1960 in Danish football Category:1961 in Danish football Category:1962 in Danish football Category:1959 in Finnish football Category:1960 in Finnish football Category:1961 in Finnish football Category:1962 in Finnish football Category:1959 in Norwegian football Category:1960 in Norwegian football Category:1961 in Norwegian football Category:1962 in Norwegian football Category:1959 in Swedish football Category:1960 in Swedish football Category:1961 in Swedish football Category:1962 in Swedish football Category:Inter-Nordic sports competitions ",
