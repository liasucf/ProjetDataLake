He is currently playing under contract with Stjernen Hockey in the GET-ligaen (GET). ==Playing career== McGauley formerly played in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Saskatoon Blades and Brandon Wheat Kings. He made his debut in the WHL in 2010\u201311 WHL season playing 14 games as a 16-year-old with the Blades. During the 2014\u201315 WHL season, McGauley scored 42 goals and 63 assists for the Brandon Wheat Kings and was named to the WHL Eastern Conference First All-Star Team. In five seasons he would play in 271 games in the WHL and amass 259pts. On October 5, 2015, as an undrafted free agent, McGauley signed a three-year entry level contract with the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League. Upon concluding his junior career, and embarking on his first professional year in the 2016\u201317 season, McGauley was injured during Capitals training camp and was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears. Upon receiving medical clearance he was assigned to secondary affiliate, the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL for conditioning on December 14, 2016. He registered 17 points in 39 games with the Stingrays. In the following 2017\u201318 season, McGauley continued with the Stingrays, increasing his offensive output with 36 points in 48 games. He also made his debut in the AHL with the Bears, in a 7-6 defeat to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms on March 2, 2018. He would contribute with 3 assists in 14 games for Hershey before returning to complete the season with South Carolina. As an impending restricted free agent from the Capitals, McGauley was not tendered a qualifying offer and was released to free agency. On August 2, 2018, McGauley agreed to a one-year AHL contract with the Colorado Eagles. He split the 2018\u201319 season between the Eagles and ECHL affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies, setting new career bests in the AHL with 8 points in 23 games. On July 29, 2019, McGauley opted to continue within the Eagles organization, signing a one-year contract extension. In the following 2019\u201320 season, McGauley was unable to repeat his previous season appearances with the Eagles, limited to just 10 games. He spent the majority of his contract leading the Utah Grizzlies in scoring, finishing among league leaders with 42 assists and 62 points in just 49 games before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. He was later named to the ECHL's Second All-Star Team. As a free agent from the Colorado Eagles, McGauley opted to pursue a European career by signing a one-year contract with Norwegian club, Stjernen Hockey of the GET- ligaen on June 26, 2020. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
