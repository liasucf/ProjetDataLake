    "text": "The ThinkPad P series line of laptops is produced by Lenovo and was introduced by the company as a successor to the previous ThinkPad W series. With 15\" and 17\" screens, the ThinkPad P series saw the reintroduction of physically large laptops into the ThinkPad line. Marketed largely as portable workstations., many P series laptops can be configured with high-end quad-core or hexa-core Intel processors as well as ECC memory (only with Xeon Processors) and a discrete Nvidia Quadro GPU. The P series offers ISV certifications from software vendors such as Adobe and Autodesk for various CAD software. The P52 and P72 models are the last current Lenovo laptops with a dedicated magnesium structural frame, and a removable battery. All 15\" and 17\" models have a modern 6-row ThinkPad Precision Keyboard (with Numeric Keypad and optional backlight), TrackPoint and trackpad, and optional fingerprint reader. The HQ processor-based models (such as a P50/P70 and above) use only 170 W AC power adapters, or optional 230 W adapters with high-end 17\" configurations. == Models == {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"min-width: 30%;\" ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |ThinkPad P (2015-2019) |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! ! !P*0 (2015) !P*1 (2017) !P*2 (2018) !P*3 (2019) |- | rowspan=\"2\" |14\" |Yoga | bgcolor=\"lightgreen\" |P40 Yoga ! colspan=\"3\" | |- |Slim ! colspan=\"3\" | | bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |P43s |- | rowspan=\"3\" |15\" |Ultrabook ! colspan=\"2\" | | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |P1 (gen 1) | bgcolor=\"yellow\" |P1 (gen 2) |- |Slim | bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |P50s | bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |P51s | bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |P52s | bgcolor=\"lightblue\" |P53s |- |Standard |P50 |P51 |P52 |P53 |- |17\" |Standard |P70 |P71 |P72 |P73 |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Docks |- | colspan=\"2\" |ThinkPad Basic Docking Station ThinkPad Pro Docking Station ThinkPad Ultra Docking Station | colspan=\"2\" |P50s, P51s ! colspan=\"2\" | |- | colspan=\"2\" |ThinkPad 230W Workstation Dock | colspan=\"2\" |P50, P51 P70, P71 ! colspan=\"2\" | |- | colspan=\"2\" |ThinkPad Basic Docking Station (USB-C) ThinkPad Pro Docking Station (USB-C) ThinkPad Ultra Docking Station (USB-C) ! colspan=\"2\" | | colspan=\"2\" |P52s, P53s; P43s |- | colspan=\"2\" |ThinkPad Thunderbolt Workstation Dock ! colspan=\"2\" | |P52, P72, P1 | |} === First Generation === The first generation comes with a variety of \"high-end\" options such as Intel Xeon processors, 4K screens and DDR4 RAM up to 64 GB. 1080p screens and Intel Core Series CPUs come standard along with PCIe SSDs.
