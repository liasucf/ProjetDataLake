    "text": "A referendum on self-determination was held in Tokelau on 20 October and on 22\u201324 October 2007, Bulletin of the Tokelau Government, 19 October 2007 with the result being that self-governance was rejected. Had it been successful, the referendum would have changed Tokelau's status from an unincorporated New Zealand territory to a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand, akin to the Cook Islands and Niue. However, the referendum required a two-thirds positive vote to pass, and the \"yes\" side fell short of the required total by 16 votes. The referendum was open to Tokelauans aged 18 or older, with 789 people eligible to vote.Register of people entitled to vote A majority of two-thirds of voters was necessary for the referendum to be accepted. After the narrow failure of the first such referendum in 2006, it was decided that another referendum would be held late the following year. Tokelau's leaders believe that concerns among Tokelauan expatriates were a factor in the failure of the 2006 referendum, even though they were not eligible to vote, and assured them that they would not lose their rights to return to Tokelau if the 2007 referendum had passed. There were 23% more people eligible to vote in the 2007 referendum than in the previous year's. The schedule was: * 20 October: Apia, Samoa (overseas voting). 63 votes cast. * 22 October: Fakaofo * 23 October: Nukunonu * 24 October: Atafu Had the proposal succeeded, a date would have been set, most likely in mid-2008, for the \"day of self government\". However, the proposal failed again by an even smaller margin \u2013 16 more \"yes\" votes would have been needed to approve it.Scoop: Tokelau One Percent Short of Self-Government It is possible that the issue will be voted on again in the future; the leader of the largest group of overseas Tokelauans (the Tokelauan community in the Hutt Valley in New Zealand) Henry Joseph called for another vote within two years, with the required approval being changed to a simple majority.Radio Australia \u2013 News \u2013 Tokelau leader seeks third self-determination vote ==Results== ==References== ==External links== *Official website of the Council of Ongoing Government Tokelau Category:Referendums in Tokelau Self-determination referendum Category:2007 elections in Oceania Category:2007 in international relations Tokelau Category:Separatism in New Zealand ",
