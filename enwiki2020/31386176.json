    "text": "Huntite is a carbonate mineral with the chemical formula Mg3Ca(CO3)4. Huntite crystallizes in the trigonal system and typically occurs as platy crystals and powdery masses. The most common industrial use of huntite is as a natural mixture with hydromagnesite as a flame retardant or fire retardant additive for polymers. ==Discovery== In 1953 a paper by George Faust announced the discovery of a new carbonate mineral found in Currant Creek, Nevada (US). Faust acknowledged that the mineral probably had been discovered previously, but it had been misidentified as impure magnesite by W. E. Ford in 1917. Faust named the new mineral \"huntite\" in honour of his former teacher, Walter Frederick Hunt (1882\u20131975),Kraus, E.H., American Mineralogist, v. 38, Jan-Feb, 1953 Professor of Petrology at the University of Michigan. Faust carried out analyses of the mineral, and found amongst others that in differential thermal analysis huntite showed two endothermic peaks, which could be attributed to the dissociation of MgCO3 and CaCO3 respectively. Chemical analyses showed huntite to consist of Mg3Ca(CO3)4. ==Properties== Huntite often occurs in combination with other Mg/Ca carbonates such as dolomite, magnesite, and hydromagnesite. Large deposits of huntite occur in Turkey and Greece and these are commercially exploited because of its fire retardant properties. Huntite thermally decomposes over a temperature range of about 450\u2013800 \u00b0C, releasing carbon dioxide and leaving a residue of magnesium and calcium oxides. ==Occurrences== Huntite has been found in a variety of environments. For example, it occurs in the modern carbonate sediments of the tidal flats bordering the Persian Gulf,Kinsman, D. J. J. (1967): Huntite from a carbonate - evaporite environment.

Sedimentary Geology, vol.205, pp.160-164. ==Syntheses== In 1962, huntite was first synthesized by Biedl and Preisinger in experiments conducted at 100 \u00b0C and 3.2 bar CO2 pressure.Biedl, A. & Preisinger, A. (1962): Synthese von Huntit, Mg3Ca(CO3)4. Anzeiger der mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche Klasse, \u00d6sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Wien), 1962, No.10, pp.148-149. In 1983 Oomori et al. claimed laboratory synthesis of huntite at 33 \u00b0C when adding a sodium carbonate solution to concentrated sea water saturated with calcium bicarbonate.Oomori, T.; Kaneshima, K.; Taira, T. & Kitano, Y. (1983): Synthetic studies of protodolomite from brine waters. Geochemical Journal, vol.17, pp.147-152. In 2006, Zaitseva et al noted the precipitation of huntite at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In laboratory experiments originally intended to synthesize magnesium calcite, they had added cultures of Microcoleus chtonoplastes (cyanobacteria) to sea water brine. After 10 months of continuously shaking the samples they found huntite, magnesite, and aragonite.Zaitseva, L. V.; Orleanskii, V. K.; Gerasimenko, M. & Ushatinskaya, G. T. (2006): The role of cyanobacteria in crystallization of magnesium calcites. Paleontological Journal, vol.40, pp.125-133. In 2012, Hopkinson et al. synthesized the mineral at 52 \u00b0C by reacting magnesium calcite with nesquehonite (MgCO3\u00b73H2O).Hopkinson, L.; Kristova, P.; Rutt, K. & Cressey, G. (2012): Phase transitions in the system MgO - CO2 \\- H2O during CO2 degassing of Mg-bearing solutions. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, vol.76, pp.1-13. ==Genesis== Huntite, dolomite and magnesite appear to be so very closely related, that a genetic relationship seems to be implied.M\u00fcller, G.; Irion, G. & F\u00f6rstner, U. (1972): Formation and diagenesis of inorganic Ca-Mg carbonates in the lacustrine environment. Die Naturwissenschaften, vol.59, pp.158-164. In a number of instances all three carbonates are found in close association; for example Faust (1953) described huntite occurring together with dolomite and magnesite (amongst other minerals); Carpenter (1961)Carpenter, A. B. (1961): Mineral assemblage magnesium calcite - aragonite - huntite at Crestmore, California. Geological Society of America, Abstracts for 1961, p.146. found huntite associated with aragonite, magnesium calcite and dolomite; Larrabee (1969)Larrabee, D. M. (1969) Serpentinite and rodingite in the Hunting Hill Quarry, Montgomery County, Maryland. U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin, no.1283, 34 p. reported on huntite together with (amongst many others) aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite in serpentinite on a weathered dunite rock. A weathered basalt in Australia was found to contain huntite in association with magnesite (Cole & Lancucki, 1975Cole, W. F. & Lancucki, C. J. (1975): Huntite, from Deer Park, Victoria, Australia. American Mineralogist, vol.60, pp.1130-1131. ). Huntite together with magnesite was found by Calvo et al. (1995)Calvo, J. P.; Stamatakis, M. G. & Magganas, A. C. (1955): Clastic huntite in Upper Neogene formations of the Kozani Basin, Macedonia, Northern Greece. Journal of Sedimentary Research, vol.A65, pp.627-632. in lake sediments of Northern Greece. Huntite in combination with magnesite occurs in a weathered serpentinite near Hrub\u0161ice, Czech Republic according to N\u011bmec (1981)N\u011bmec, D. (1981): Huntit ze serpentinitov\u00e9 oblasti u Hrub\u0161ic na z\u00e1padni Morav\u011b (Huntite from the serpentinite area at Hrub\u0161ice, Western Moravia - English summary). \u010casopis pro mineralogii a geologii, vol.26, pp.75-78. According to the mineral and locations database of \"mindat.org\" huntite, together with aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite can be found in the \"U Pust\u00e9ho Ml\u00fdna\" quarry near Hrub\u0161ice, Czech Republic. ==Industrial use== The most common industrial use of huntite is as a natural mixture with hydromagnesite as a flame retardant or fire retardant additive for polymers. The heat of a fire will cause huntite to decompose releasing carbon dioxide into the flames. This helps to slow the spread of the fire. The release of carbon dioxide is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat, this action helps to cool the burning material, again slowing the spread of the fire. These types of mixtures are used as alternatives to the more commonly used aluminium hydroxide. ==Conite== A mineral with exactly the same composition as that of huntite has been known for more than 200 years; in 1812 for example, JohnJohn, D. (1812): Chemische Analyse des Conits aus der Gegend des Meisseners. Journal f\u00fcr Chemie und Physik, vol.5, pp.13-18. and StromeyerStromeyer, F. (1812): Analyse des sogenannten Konits vom Meissner. Annalen der Physik, vol.41, pp.336-338. described it as having a chemical composition of CaCO3 : MgCO3 = 1 : 3 . In those days the mineral was known as conite (in German: Konit); a name given to it by Retzius (1798).Retzius, A. J. (1798): Versuch einer Aufstellung des Mineralreiches. S. L. Crusius, Leipzig, 376 p. However, a serious problem concerns the exact location where the mineral conite can be found. Originally Retzius had found the new carbonate in a mineral collection, and had recognized it as a new species because it was harder than any of the known carbonates (even so hard, that it would spark when struck with steel) but no indication was given as to the site where this conite had been found. A number of papers describing conite are known, without the exact location where it can be found. In 1804, Ludwig stated that the sample of conite studied by him, came \"from Iceland\".Ludwig, C. F. (1804): Handbuch der Mineralogie nach A. G. Werner. S. L. Crusius, Leipzig, Theil 2 = 226 p. In 1805 Leonhard wrote that the conite he had analyzed, came \"from Scandinavia\".Leonhard, C. C. (1805): Handbuch einer allgemeinen topographischen Mineralogie. J. C. Hermann,Frankfurt, vol.1 = 479 p. Somewhat more exact was Stromeyer in 1812, who claimed that his sample of conite had been found near the village of Frankenhayn, on the eastern slope of the Hoher Meissner near Kassel, Germany. However, this conite had been found there as a loose boulder, and no outcrop of the new mineral was mentioned. In 1833 Blum summed up how conite could be found in mines near Freiberg (Germany), as boulders on the slopes of Mount Meissner (Germany) and on Iceland.Blum, J. R. (1833): Lehrbuch der Oryktognosie. Schweizerbart, Stuttgart, 509 p. In 1849, Hirzel repeated that conite could be found on the eastern slope of Mount Meissner,Hirzel, H. (1849): Analyse des Konits von Frankenheyn am \u00f6stlichen Abhange des Meissners. Archiv der Pharmacie, vol.109, pp.154-156. and in 1882 Schrauf reported the mineral from the magnesite deposits on the borders of the Sch\u00f6ninger Bach at K\u0159em\u017ee near Budweis, Czech Republic.Schrauf, A. (1882): Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntnis des Associationskreises des Magnesiasilicate. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Krystallographie und Mineralogie, vol.6, pp.321-388. Because of the absence of a type locality for the mineral conite, a historical priority of its description over that of huntite cannot be claimed. ==References== Category:Calcium minerals Category:Carbonate minerals Category:Magnesium minerals Category:Trigonal minerals Category:Flame retardants ",
