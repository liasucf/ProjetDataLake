Joe and Carol Schoentrup of Spokane, Washington, along with Joe's sister Ann and her husband Mark Lawrence of Kennewick, Washington operated a food concession at the fair that served a combination of chili and corn chips that they dubbed the \"Petro\", a name derived from \"petroleum\" to honor the energy theme of the 1982 World's Fair.Mary Constantine, In '82, the world's culinary creations were put in Knoxvillians' hands, Knoxville News Sentinel, May 2, 2007Chili and chips prove to be hot item for Spokane couple at world's fairs, Spokane Spokesman-Review, January 23, 1986 The concept was based on a snack item that had been sold at high school sports events in Omak, Washington, wherein chili and onions were poured into open bags of Fritos, to be eaten out of the bag. In the southwestern United States, similar snacks were known as \"Frito pies\" or \"chili pies.\" For the World's Fair, the Schoentrups said they \"gourmetized\" this combination by adding cheddar and Monterey jack cheese, tomatoes, green onions, sour cream, and hot sauce.Frito dish big at World's Fair, article by the Washington Post, published in Eugene Register-Guard, June 1, 1982 The product was very popular, selling 175,000 units over the six months of the Knoxville fair.
