    "text": "Bertha (Betsy) Bakker-Nort (Groningen, 8 May 1874 \u2013 Utrecht, 23 May 1946) was a Dutch feminist, lawyer, and politician. In 1895, Nort became involved with the feminist movement, and set up a department of the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VvVK) in Groningen, partly inspired by the experiences she had had in Scandinavia. Thanks in part to her efforts, women's suffrage was introduced in 1919. Bakker-Nort was a lawyer and procureur in Groningen from 1914 to 1930. In The Hague she served in the same capacity from 1930 onwards. She was a member of the House of Representatives for the Free-thinking Democratic League from 25 July 1922 to 6 January 1942. During World War II she was interned at Westerbork transit camp and Barneveld between December 1942 and 4 September 1944 when she was moved to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. She was liberated in May 1945. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Dutch feminists Category:Dutch women lawyers Category:Free- thinking Democratic League politicians Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Netherlands) Category:People from Groningen (city) Category:20th-century Dutch lawyers Category:20th-century women lawyers ",
