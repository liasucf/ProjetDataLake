On 8 May 1984, Denis Lortie entered the Parliament Building in the morning, before government business had begun, killing three government employees and wounding 13 others on his way to the Assembly Chamber. Upon learning of Lortie's presence, Jalbert entered the Assembly Chamber. Seeing Lortie in uniform, Jalbert showed the gunman his identification as a war veteran from the same regiment as Lortie, opening a dialogue with him. Jalbert convinced Lortie to allow several employees to leave the premises. Then he invited Lortie into his downstairs office to discuss the situation, in effect setting himself up as hostage while removing Lortie from the scene. At extreme personal risk, Jalbert spent four hours persuading Lortie to surrender to police. Jalbert's actions almost certainly prevented a higher death toll. For his bravery, Jalbert was awarded the Cross of Valour, Canada's highest civilian award for bravery, which was presented to him 9 November 1984, by Governor General Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 in a ceremony at Rideau Hall, Ottawa. The award citation reads: In 2006 a street in Quebec City was named after Ren\u00e9 Jalbert:www.ville.quebec.qc.ca Toponymy His younger brother was film and television actor Pierre Jalbert who died in 2014. Major Jalbert died at age 74 in 1996. ==Awards and Decorations== Jalbert's personal awards and decorations include the following: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:Green;color:White\" align=\"center\" |Ribbon||Description||Notes |- |80px || Cross of Valour (Canada) (CV) || *Awarded (CV) on 15 July 1984 |- |x25px || WW2 1939\u20131945 Star || *1939-1945, WW2 |- |x25px || WW2 France and Germany Star || *1939-1945, WW2 |- |x25px || WW2 Defence Medal (United Kingdom) || *1939-1945, WW2 |- |80px || WW2 Canadian Volunteer Service Medal || *with Overseas Service bar |- |x25px || WW2 War Medal 1939\u20131945 || *WWII 1939-1945, WW2 |- |80px || Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea || |- | || Special Service Medal || *with NATO-OTAN Clasp |- |80px || Korea Medal || *United Nations 1950-1953 |- |80px || United Nations Medal || *United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus - UNFICYP |- |80px || International Commission for Supervision and Control Medal || *Indo-China, 1954\u20131973 |- |80px || Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal || *Decoration awarded in 1977 *Canadian version |- |80px || 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal || *Decoration awarded in 1992 |- |80px||Canadian Forces Decoration (CD)|| *with one Clasp for 22 years of services |} == References == Category:1921 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Canadian military personnel of the Korean War Category:Canadian military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Cross of Valour (Canada) Category:Quebec civil servants ",
