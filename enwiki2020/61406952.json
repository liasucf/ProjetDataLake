    "text": "The Invisible Borders Trans-African Photographers Organization is an artist- led initiative founded in 2009. The initiative started as a collective led by Emeka Okereke alongside his colleagues, inspired by a road trip experience to Bamako from Lagos for the 8th edition of the Bamako Encounters Festival of Photography. The group is mainly known for its Trans-African Road Trip, which began in 2009.. The Trans-African Road trip photography projects have been hosted at The 56th Venice Biennale, and The National museum of Modern Arts, Georges-Pompidou Centre, Paris.https://www.singulart.com/en/artist/emeka- okereke-46?v=1. == Background == The collective was formed as an initiative to overcome a trans-border road trip challenge proposed by Nigerian photographer; Emeka Okereke, as the response to an invitation to attend the 8th edition of the Bamako Photography Encounters at the Bamako Biennale. This challenge was inspired by his expedition from Lagos to Aba, with Ray-Daniels Okeugo.. The founding members of the collective, Emeka Okereke and Uche Okpa-Iroha, explored the theme of the festival \u2013 \u201cBorders\u201d, through an artistic travel adventure. They requested to exchange their flight tickets for money to travel to the festival by road with their colleagues who agreed to take on the challenge.. The challenge became a dare within the group, whose members; Uche James-Iroha, Lucy Azubuike, Emeka Okereke, Amaize Ojeikere, Uche Okpa-Iroha, Ray-Daniels Okeugo, Unoma Giese, Chriss Nwobu, Nike Ojeikere and Charles Okereke,spearheaded the trip into a Trans-African Road Trip project. The group traveled in a black Volkswagen Mini bus rented from Photo Garage in Lagos, christened \u201cBlack Maria\u201dfor the journey to Bamako. They headed East of Lagos, on to the coastal expressway towards Benin and journeyed through Ghana, Togo and Burkina Faso. The experiences encountered during the road trip to Bamako, influenced the transition of the collective into an organization which was named The Invisible Borders Organization. The Trans-African Road Trip project is an annual endeavor undertaken by artists who seek to explore and participate in various events, festivals and exhibitions collectively while sharing their independent encounters experienced during the trip across the continent. The project was adopted as a featured documentary, filmed by May Abdalla in 2013. == Art Form == Photography is the dominantly employed artistic form. The adoption of other forms, mediums and disciplines such as Literature, Videography, Film, Performance art, public space interventions and other projects are an expansion of the scope of their operation as an organization. == Invisible Borders Trans-African Initiative == The Invisible borders Trans-African Initiative hosted 8 road trips between 2009 and 2019 across over 20 countries in Africa but, also between Africa and Europe in 2014.
