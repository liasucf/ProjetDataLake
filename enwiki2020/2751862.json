    "text": "Visions of Gerard is a novel by American Beat writer Jack Kerouac. Written in the first two weeks of 1956, while staying with his sister Caroline in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Kerouac's novel would not be published until 1963. Kerouac, Jack. Visions of Cody, Visions of Gerard, Big Sur. New York: Library of America, 2015, p. 763 It is the first volume in Kerouac's \"Duluoz Legend\". Unique among Kerouac's novels, Visions of Gerard focuses on the scenes and sensations of childhood as evidenced in the tragically short yet happy life of his older brother, Gerard. Kerouac paints a picture of the boy as a saint, who loves all creatures and teaches this doctrine to four-year-old Jack. Set in Kerouac's hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, it is a beautiful but unsettling exploration of the meaning and precariousness of existence.McLaughlin, K., 'Jack Kerouac's Visions of Gerard', in Wills, D. (ed.) Beatdom Vol. 4 (Mauling Press: Dundee, 2009) ==Explanation of the novel's title== Throughout the novel, Jack explores perspective and interpretations of the world\u2014existence, reality, illusion\u2014and through the death of his older brother Gerard, Jack realizes the Truth that has been passed on throughout history. The title is consistent with that of one of Kerouac's other character-studies, Visions of Cody, which centers on his experiences with Neal Cassady.
