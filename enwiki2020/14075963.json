    "text": "\"Sail Away to Avalon\" is the first single by Ayreon, released on 1995, from their album The Final Experiment. The song combines elements of medieval classical music with heavy metal and folk using instruments such as the harpsichord for the rhythm sections. The lyrics reinforce this theme, telling the tale of a grand adventure to \"Avalon\" to recover the holy grail. The single is a re-recording of Ayreon's demo EP. All songs from the demo, except \"the Accusation\" were re-recorded for the single EP and the compilation album, Ayreonauts Only (also not including \"Sail Away to Avalon\"). == Track listing == #Sail Away to Avalon - 04:00 #Nature's Dance - 02:36 #The Charm of the Seer - 03:53 #Eyes of Time - 05:09 === Demo track listing === #Eyes of Time (vocals by Leon Goewie) - 05:09 #The Accusation (vocals by Robert Soeterboek) - 3:49 #Sail Away to Avalon (vocals by Barry Hay) - 03:47 #Nature's Dance (vocals by Arjen Lucassen) - 02:36 #The Charm of the Seer (vocals by Arjen Lucassen) - 02:31 == Personnel == *Arjen Lucassen - vocals, guitar, Keyboard, Synthesizer. *Barry Hay - Vocals *Leon Goewie - Vocals *Robert Soeterboek - Vocals *Ruud Houweling - Vocals *Cleem Determeijer - Keyboard *Rene Merkelbach - Keyboard *Jan Bijlsma - Bass *Ernst van Ee - drums == References == *Sail Away to Avalon page at Ayreon's official website ==External links== *Ayreon official website Category:Ayreon songs Category:1995 debut singles Category:1995 songs ",
