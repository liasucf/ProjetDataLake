Gilbert. The general effect she demonstrated is known as embryonic induction, that is, the capacity of some cells to direct the developmental trajectory of other cells. Induction remains a fundamental concept and area of ongoing research in the field.Stern, Claudio D. Great Experiments: Spemann and Mangold\u2019s Discovery of the Organizer. 2001. http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/book/Great%20Experments/great30.htm ==Biography== Hilde Proescholdt was born in Gotha, Thuringia, a province in central-eastern Germany on October 20, 1898. She was the middle daughter of soap factory owner Ernest Proescholdt and his wife Gertrude. She attended the University of Jena in Germany for two semesters in 1918 and 1919 and then transferred to the University of Frankfurt in Germany where she also spent two semesters. It was here that she saw a lecture by the renowned embryologist Hans Spemann on experimental embryology. This lecture inspired her to pursue her education in this field. After Frankfurt, she attended the Zoological Institute in Freiburg. It was here that she met and married her husband, , who was Spemann\u2019s chief assistant (and, incidentally, a supporter of the Nazi Party). Under Spemann's direction, she completed her 1923 dissertation, entitled \u201c\u00dcber Induktion von Embryonalanlagen durch Implantation artfremder Organisatoren\u201d, or \u201cInduction of Embryonic Primordia by Implantation of Organizers from a Different Species.\u201d After earning her PhD in zoology, Hilde moved with her husband and infant son, Christian, to Berlin. Shortly after the move, Hilde died from severe burns as a result of a gas heater explosion in her Berlin home.The Embryo Project Encyclopedia: Hilde Mangold. http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/hilde-mangold-1898-1924 She never lived to see the publication of her thesis results. Her son died in World War II.Hilde Proescholdt Mangold by Veronica Reardon Mondrinos in Women in the Biological Sciences, page 304. ==Key experiments== Mangold performed very delicate transplantation experiments with embryos (a feat even more impressive before the discovery of antibiotics to prevent infection after surgery). She demonstrated that tissue from the dorsal lip of the blastopore grafted into a host embryo can induce the formation of an extra body axis, creating conjoined twins. Crucially, by using two species of newt with different skin colors for host and donor, she showed that the amphibian organizer did not form the extra axis by itself, but recruited host tissue to form the twin (although the full implications of this result were not understood until a year after her death).Spemann, H. and Mangold, H. (1924). \"\u00dcber Induktion von Embryonanlagen durch Implantation artfremder Organisatoren\". Roux' Arch. f. Entw. mech. 100: 599-638. This was the basis of the discovery of the \"organizer\", which is responsible for gastrulation. ==See also== * Developmental biology * Embryogenesis * Theodor Boveri * August Weismann ==References== ==External links== * Explanation of the Spemann-Mangold experiment from a Nature Reviews article Category:1898 births Category:1924 deaths Category:20th-century biologists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:Embryologists Category:German women biologists ",
