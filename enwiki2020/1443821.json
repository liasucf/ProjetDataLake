The main brands are HopDevil, Prima Pils, Headwaters Pale Ale, Golden Monkey, DirtWolf, and Storm King, which are distributed in 34 states and 9 countries. Victory Brewing is located at 420 Acorn Lane Downingtown, Pennsylvania 19335.Victory Brewing directions page www.victorybeer.com/directions ==History== Founded in 1996 by Ron Barchet and Bill Covaleski in an old Pepperidge Farm bakery, Victory has grown considerably and evolved well outside the traditional small market of a beer- brewing restaurant. The brewery's first three beers were Victory Festbier, Brandywine Valley Lager (now Victory Lager), and HopDevil Ale. Initially they thought that the malt forward Victory Festbier would become their most popular beer. However, they soon realized that consumers craved very hoppy beers, such as HopDevil Ale, the most. On February 16, 2016, Victory allied with Southern Tier Brewing Company of Lakewood, NY to become part of the Artisanal Brewing Ventures holding company. ==Brewery== The brewery uses an automated, energy recovery, 50 BBL system designed and manufactured by Rolec in Chieming, OberBayern, Germany. Victory also brews using traditional methods where appropriate, such as using the energy intensive decoction process for production of certain German style lager beers. Victory uses whole hops. The restaurant was completely remodeled in spring of 2008 with a new focus on smoked barbecue. A growler filler was installed during the renovation that allows any of 20 draft beers to be routed to the counter-pressure growler filler. This device includes a CO2 evacuation step, increasing the shelf life of the beer compared to direct spigot filling. The growlers are 68 oz., which is approximately .53 gallons or 2 liters.Victory Store page www.victorybeer.com/brewpub/victory-store Victory makes their own root beer, which is also served in the restaurant. == Products == Prima Pils from Victory Brewing CompanyVictory produces over 20 brands of beer, some of which are: Year-Round * Prima Pils: German Pilsner with whole flower European hops and German malt.
