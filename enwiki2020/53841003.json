Sheko held division and corps commands during the 1920s and 1930s, and had two stints in Mongolia as Chief of Staff of the Mongolian People's Army and as an adviser to the Mongolian War Ministry. During the Great Purge, Sheko spent several months as a cavalry corps commander due to vacancies created by arrests but was himself arrested in August 1937 and executed the next year. == Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War == Sheko was born to a peasant family on 1 April 1893 in the village of Yeskovo, Krasninsky Uyezd, Smolensk Governorate. He graduated from the village school and a city school and before 1912 worked in the village. He moved to Moscow between 1912 and 1913 to work as a laborer in a milk factory, but returned to the village for work between 1913 and 1914. While in the village he also took teaching classes and twice passed a teacher's exam. After World War I began, Sheko was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in late 1914, serving as a private in an automobile company stationed in Petrograd until September 1915. In November of that year, he graduated from the 3rd Peterhof Warrant Officers School to become a praporshchik and was sent to a reserve battalion in Kozlov. This assignment proved brief, as a month later Sheko was sent to the 29th Chernigov Infantry Regiment on the Western Front. He served successively as a company junior officer, company commander, and regimental adjutant, ending the war with the rank of staff captain. Following the Russian Revolution, Sheko participated in the formation of Red Guard detachments in 1917. After joining the Red Army in June 1918, Sheko fought in the Russian Civil War.

He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 29 May 1921 for capturing the Zavada station with two dismounted squadrons in fighting against the Army of Wrangel and blowing up the tracks, which was credited with cutting off the White armored trains and strengthening the superiority of the 1st Cavalry Army. As chief of staff of the 6th Cavalry Division, Sheko was mentioned in journalist Isaac Babel's 1920 Diary and Red Cavalry. Babel wrote in his entry for 14 August 1920 in 1920 Diary that Sheko ordered the killing of Polish prisoners of war, a policy condoned by division commander Iosif Apanasenko. == Interwar period == After the end of the war, Sheko returned to the General Staff Academy, renamed the Military Academy of the Red Army, graduating in 1921.

Sheko's service in satellite Mongolia was part of a regular rotation of Soviet commanders who served as chief of staff, supervising the modernization and expansion of the Mongolian army. His duties also involved participation in the creation of military regulations and training manuals.

Upon his return to the Soviet Union, Sheko became commander and commissar of the 10th Terek-Stavropol Cossack Territorial Cavalry Division, stationed in the North Caucasus Military District, in January 1936.
