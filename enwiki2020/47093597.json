    "text": "Romani cuisine, Romani food, Gypsy cuisine or Gypsy food is the cuisine of the ethnic Romani/Romany people. It's influenced by European cuisine even though Romani people originated from India. Their cookery incorporates Indian and South Asian influences but is also very similar to Hungarian, Albanian cuisine, Balkan cuisine and Romanian cuisine. ==Overview== Romani dishes are usually made hot and spicy with the use of spices, such as paprika, garlic and bell peppers. Potatoes are also a staple in their diet. A traditional Romani dessert is pirogo. The recipe consists of eggs, raisins, walnuts, pineapple, sugar, butter, egg noodles and cottage cheese.The American Ethnic Cookbook for Students - Page 132 Another traditional dish cooked by Romani people is sarma, salmaia or sodmay, which is made from cabbage stuffed with meat and rice.Memories of a Gypsy - Page 17 Romanis consume dishes consisting of stuffed peppers, such as ardei umplu\u021bi, especially on holidays and special occasions. Romani people also cook pufe (made from fried flour), xaritsa (fried cornbread), bogacha (baked bread) and xaimoko (a meal consisting of rabbit meat). They serve their meals with kafa (coffee) and chao (tea) with sugar and milk or lemon.Gypsies: The Hidden Americans - Page 62 ==List of Romani dishes== * Ardei umplu\u0163i * Pufe * Pirogo * Xaritsa * Xaimoko or Hymoko * Goulash * Cig\u00e1nyturo * Bogacha * Ciganypecsenye * Sarma or Sodmay * Sax Suklo * M\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 ==Gallery== ==See also== * Romani people * Hungarian cuisine ==References== ==External links== * CIG\u00c1NYT\u00daR\u00d3 WITH BODAG (\u201cGYPSY\u201d CHEESE WITH TRADITIONAL ROMANI BREAD) * 10 Best Gypsy recipes * Gypsy recipes * Gypsy Sisters recipes * Roma Cuisine - What is Gypsy food? * How to Eat Like a Real \"Gypsy\" Category:Romani culture Category:European cuisine ",
