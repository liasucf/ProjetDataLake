    "text": "Cidades e Lendas is the thirteenth solo album by Brazilian musician Z\u00e9 Ramalho. It was released in 1996, after another four-year gap with no albums. It was released in a show at TUCA, S\u00e3o Paulo, around the time when his hit \"Admir\u00e1vel Gado Novo\" was featured at the soundtrack of Rede Globo's telenovela O Rei do Gado. When comparing this work with his previous effort, Frevoador, Ramalho said he was more satisfied this time because he had more time \"to choose the best repertoire and invite the right people\". By the end of October 1998, it had sold 50,000 copies. == Track listing == == Personnel == According to his official websiteCidades e Lendas at Z\u00e9 Ramalho's official website * Z\u00e9 Ramalho - Acoustic guitar, Lead vocals * Manass\u00e9s - Electric guitar, Twelve-string viola on tracks 1, 3, 10, Viola on tracks 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 * Chico Guedes - Bass guitar on tracks 1, 2, 5, 8, 9 * Jorj\u00e3o - Bass guitar on tracks 3, 6, 10 * Rui Motta - Drums on track 1 * Gustavo Schr\u00f6eter - Drums on tracks 2, 5 * Fernando Pereira - Drums on tracks 3, 10 * Sivuca - Arrangement and Conducting on tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, accordion on tracks 6, 8, 10 * Z\u00e9 Gomes - Percussion on tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 Zabumba on tracks 3, 8, 9, 10 * Z\u00e9 Leal - Percussion on tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, Pandeiro on track 10 * Marcos Nobile - Piano on tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 * Fernando Moura - Programming on tracks 4, 8, 11 * Julhinho Teixeira - Programming on track 7 ==Notes== == References == Category:1996 albums Category:Bertelsmann Music Group albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Z\u00e9 Ramalho albums ",
