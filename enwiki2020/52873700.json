He is often considered the first Icelandic architect, even though he never completed formal studies in architecture. He studied at the Copenhagen Technical College from 1901 to 1904 but was unable to complete his studies due to tuberculosis. He struggled from tuberculosis for the remainder of his life, ultimately dying from the disease at the age of 42. R\u00f6gnvaldur's designs were influenced by the Swiss chalet style and neoclassical architecture. Despite his illness and a short life, R\u00f6gnvaldur was considered a prolific and influential Icelandic architect. Some of his notable works include the Postal Office in Reykjav\u00edk; the agricultural colleges at H\u00f3lar and Hvanneyri; the churches in Keflav\u00edk, Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, and H\u00fasav\u00edk; and several buildings surrounding Tj\u00f6rnin, a prominent small lake in central Reykjav\u00edk. ==References== Category:Icelandic architects Category:1874 births Category:1917 deaths ",
