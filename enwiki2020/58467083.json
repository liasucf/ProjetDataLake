    "text": "Iran and Libya have diplomatic relations, with embassies in each other's countries. Economic, military, and cultural relations between the two countries have varied throughout time. Ties between the two nations date back thousands of years, with the origins of the Persian Empire beginning in the modern day state of Iran and the modern day Libyan state once being an essential part of the Roman Empire. == Pahlavi government == Modern Iranian- Libyan relations began in the 1960s with King Idris reigning in Libya and the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) reigning in Iran. Tension began between the two nations following the rise of Colonel Muammar Ghadafi in Libya. Ghadafi, along with other Arab leaders, accused the Shah of betraying his Arab neighbors\u2019 interests and supporting Israel.Zonis, Marvin Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 199. == After the Iranian revolution == === Before the Libyan revolution === The Iranian revolution of 1979 resulted in the overthrow of the Shah and the improvement of Iranian-Libyan relations. The turning point in Iran\u2013Libya relations came during the Iran-Iraq War, when Libya came to Iran's aid despite western pressure to keep Iran isolated. During the war Libya and Syria were Iran's only middle eastern allies. Iranian-Libyan cooperation during the 1990s led to the construction of factories, roads, and hospitals in both Libya and Iran. Ghadafi would even visit then Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. At the UN Security Council, Ghadafi vindicated Iran's nuclear program and opposed western sanctions against the Islamic Republic. However, relations between the two nations would again become strained following the kidnapping and probable murder of the influential Shia leader Musa al Sadr in Libya. === After the Libyan revolution === Iran supported the 2011 uprising against the Libyan government, describing it as an \"Islamic awakening\" and condemning the government crackdown. The Libyan ambassador to Iran later resigned due to the Arab Spring protests in his home country. Following the overthrow of Ghadafi, Iran recognized the new Libyan transitional government. Iran's ambassador would soon return to the newly formed Arab Republic of Libya. == See also == *Arab\u2013Iran relations *Iran\u2013Iraq\u2013Syria pipeline *Axis of evil *State Sponsors of Terrorism *Iran\u2013Syria relations == References == Category:Foreign relations of Iran Category:Foreign relations of Libya ",
