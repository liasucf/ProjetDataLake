    "text": "The 1957 Mongolia earthquake occurred on December 4. The earthquake resulted in thirty deaths, and the destruction of all houses in Dzun Bogd and Bayan Gobi. Subsidence, faulting and fissures occurred in the Bahar Uula and Ih Bogd Uul Mountains. The largest fissure was long with as much as of vertical and of horizontal offset. Because of the extremely sparse population in the area, this is perhaps the least damaging great earthquake to have occurred on land in the 20th century. ==See also== *List of earthquakes in 1957 ==References== ==External links== * Mongolia Earthquake, 1957 Category:Earthquakes in Mongolia ",
