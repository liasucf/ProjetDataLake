    "text": "Animal Magnetism is the seventh studio album by German rock band Scorpions, released in 1980. The RIAA certified the record as Gold on 8 March 1984, and Platinum on 28 October 1991.RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by Scorpions. Retrieved on 22 February 2011. In the 2001 remaster edition by EMI, an extra track \"Hey You\" (rare single), sung by Rudolf Schenker is included (although Klaus Meine sings the chorus). The song was originally recorded during the Lovedrive sessions in 1978 and released two years later as side-A (together with \"The Zoo\" as side-B). A shorter remix from 1989 was used on the 2001 and 2015 reissues instead of the longer original single version. \"Lady Starlight\" is the only song in the entire Scorpions discography so far (as of 2018) to include an arrangement for strings and orchestral winds. == Artwork == The album cover was created by Storm Thorgerson of the design firm Hipgnosis and, as with earlier Scorpions album sleeves, courted controversy. However, unlike several of their previous album sleeves the controversy did not result in the cover being replaced with an alternate sleeve. Recalling the cover photo, Thorgerson remarked, \"That one was funny. I don't think we figured it out. We just knew there was something rude somewhere.\" Scorpions bassist at the time, Francis Buchholz, recalls that, \"Hermann came up with the title for the album Animal Magnetism and we all liked it because it's an interesting title. So we had this guy Storm who was doing album covers for Pink Floyd, I think he did the one with the guy with the flames. So Storm came up with the idea for the Animal Magnetism cover, I personally didn't like it, but the rest of the band loved it. I liked the dog though.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == ===Scorpions=== *Klaus Meine \u2013 lead vocals *Rudolf Schenker \u2013 rhythm guitar, lead guitar on 3, 4, 5, 9, acoustic guitar on 5, backing vocals *Matthias Jabs \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar on 3, 4, 5, 9, slide guitar on 9, talk box on 8, backing vocals *Francis Buchholz \u2013 bass, backing vocals *Herman Rarebell \u2013 drums, backing vocals ===Additional musicians on \"Lady Starlight\"=== *Allan Macmillan \u2013 strings and horns arrangements, conductor *Adele Arman, Victoria Richard \u2013 violins *Paul Arman \u2013 viola *Richard Arman \u2013 cello *Charles Elliot \u2013 bass *Melvin Berman \u2013 oboe *George Stimpson, Brad Wamaar \u2013 French horns ===Production=== *Dieter Dierks \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *David Green \u2013 engineer on \"Lady Starlight\" *Steve Fallone \u2013 mastering *Howie Weinberg \u2013 re-mastering for CD ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"300px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\"|1980 |align=\"center\"|German Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|12 |- |align=\"center\"|UK Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|23 |- |align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (United States) |align=\"center\"|52 |- |align=\"center\"|RPM100 (Canada) |align=\"center\"|76 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"400px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|1980 |align=\"center\"|\"Make It Real\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|72 |- |align=\"center\"|\"The Zoo\" |align=\"center\"|75 |} == Certifications == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
