The \"Auntie\" character was a dominatrix woman dressed in lingerie that would dance and be part of a game where Suzana would wax male participants in a live stage show. The participants would answer general knowledge questions, if the answer was incorrect they would be punished with waxing; if correct they would be rewarded with money prizes and lap dances from \"Auntie\". She also released an album and starred her own action adventure TV-series, As Aventuras de Tiazinha (The Adventures of Tiazinha).
