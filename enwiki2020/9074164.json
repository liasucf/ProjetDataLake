    "text": "Here is a list of Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) Standards. The EIA ceased operations on February 11, 2011, but the former sectors continue to serve the constituencies of EIA. EIA designated ECA to continue to develop standards for interconnect, passive and electro-mechanical (IP&E;) electronic components under the ANSI-designation of EIA standards. All other electronic components standards are managed by their respective sectors. ECA is expected to merge with the National Electronic Distributors Association (NEDA) to form the Electronic Components Industry Association (ECIA). However, the EIA standards brand will continue for IP&E; standards within ECIA. As currently authorized, any ANSI standard designated at ANSI EIA-xxx is developed and/or managed by ECA (and, in the future, ECIA). ==1-199== * TIA/EIA-41 Cellular Radiocommunications Intersystem Operations. * EIA/TIA/IS-55 Recommended Minimum Performance Standards of 800 MHz Dual Mode Mobile Stations * EIA/TIA/IS-66 Sectional Specification for Nonpressurized Fiber Optic Splice Closures * TIA/EIA-136-310-A-1 TDMA Third Generation Wireless - Radio Link Protocol \u20131 * JEP-143C Solid-State Reliability Assessment and Qualification Methodologies * EIA-170/RS-170 Electrical Performance Standards-Monochrome Television Studio Facilities 01 November 1957. Note: EIA-170 only appears on the cover page of the document, internal pages are labeled RS-170 in the upper right corner. EIA-170/RS-170 applies only to monochrome (black & white) video. The later color video version is RS-170A which shows color burst and the 4 color field sequence of NTSC. The RS-170A version is only a tentative standard, and was never formally adopted. NAB Engineering Handbook Seventh Edition.National Association Of Broadcasters Engineering Handbook, Seventh Edition, 1985, p. 5.4-75, * EIA-189A Formerly RS-189A. Encoded color bar signal (preceded SMPTE color bars). * EIA-198-D Ceramic dielectric capacitors classes I, II, III, and class IV. ==200-299== * EIA-222 Standards for antenna mast structural integrity * RS-225, 50\u03a9 RF high power RF connectors, (EIA RF Connectors) * RS-232 (or EIA-232) electrical characteristics, single-ended voltage digital interface circuit (serial data communications) * RS-259, 75\u03a9 RF high power RF connectors, (EIA RF Connectors) * EIA-274 is the most common NC code format. In the machine tool industry it also known as G-code. In the PCB industry Standard Gerber, now revoked, was based on it. * RS-279 electronic color code originally known as the RETMA color code ==300-399== * EIA/ECA-310 Cabinets, racks (including 19-inch racks, rack units), panels and associated equipment standard * EIA/TIA-329-B Minimum Standards for Communication Antennas Part I - Base Station Antennas * EIA/TIA-329-B-1 Minimum Standards for Communication Antennas Part II - Vehicular Antennas * EIA-343 Formerly RS-343.
