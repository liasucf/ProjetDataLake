In 1911 he joined Richmond in the Victorian Football League and made his debut in their Round 1 clash with Collingwood. He scored two goals in the loss to Carlton in Round 5, where again it was noted that \u201cJones again showed up well in the matter of marking, but failed lamentably in shooting for goal.\u201d In early 1913 Jones moved to Melbourne after failing to gain a place in Richmond\u2019s team in the first few weeks of the season but he never played a senior game for Melbourne. Later that season he moved to the Ballarat League and played with Golden Square.
