    "text": "The excavation of Stabiae has uncovered the remains of the ancient town of Stabiae, near the current town of Castellammare di Stabia in the Italian region of Campania, along with a number of public buildings dating back to ancient Rome. The excavations began in 1749, during the reign of Charles III of Spain, when they were performed through a series of tunnels. Open-air excavations began in 1950 under the direction of Italian archaeologist Libero D'Orsi. The excavation site is smaller compared to those of Pompeii and Ercolano, but is notable in that it makes it possible to observe a different aspect of life in ancient Rome: while the former were urban settings, Stabiae was first a fortified burgh and later a holiday destination. featuring both rustic and luxurious villas. == History == === Start of the excavation === The first documented efforts into uncovering the remains of Stabiae data back to the end of the sixteenth century, when Bishop Milante had pressed for a archaeological expeditions to begin. However, his efforts were mostly unsuccessful.
