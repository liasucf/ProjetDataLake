In the Family Guy episode \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\", he appears and tries to convince the other characters to buy him a case of Sudafed, but an animated version of his TV dad Alan Thicke appears, with his neck bobbling rapidly. He tells his son \"Be-en! What have I told you about trading sexual favors for Sudafed?\" He can be seen in four movies in 2009: Ditching Party, Never Have I Ever, The Fish and Tar Beach. While promoting Start Fresh Recovery of Santa Ana, California in April 2014, Miller said he started drinking alcohol at age four.
