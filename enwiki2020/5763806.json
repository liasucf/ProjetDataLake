The album was released in conjunction with the single, \"Born Slippy .NUXX 2003\". == Summary == This compilation marked the first album appearances of \"Big Mouth\" (listed here as \"Bigmouth\"), \"Dirty\", \"Rez\" and \"Spikee\"; all of which had previously only been available as singles. Furthermore, it contained some of their more popular soundtrack pieces, including \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\" and \"Born Slippy .NUXX\", both used in the film Trainspotting; \"Rez\", as used in Vanilla Sky; \"Cowgirl\" from Hackers; \"Moaner\" from Batman & Robin; and \"8 Ball\", which was featured in The Beach. The original versions of \"Dark & Long\" and \"Born Slippy\" were not included in the compilation. The version of \"Born Slippy .NUXX\" included on this album is an exclusive edit of the song, while \"Push Upstairs\" is an extended mix that was limited to a 12\" promotional vinyl on its original release in 1999. The full length version of \"Moaner\" is also included. A promotional version of 1992\u20132002 also included the unedited version of \"Dirty\" and a previously unreleased extended version of \"Jumbo\", which would later appear on 1992\u20132012 The Anthology. Tim Booth of James has ranked it among his favourite albums. ==Track listing== All songs by Underworld, unless noted. ===CD version=== ===Promotional pressing=== A very small number of releases contained extended versions of \"Dirty\" (which includes a coda that contains a sample from \"Dolls' Polyphony\", from the soundtrack to the anime film Akira) and of \"Jumbo\" (which was later given a wide release on 1992\u20132012 The Anthology.) ===UK Vinyl version=== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2003) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian Albums Charthttp://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Underworld&titel;=1992-2002&cat;=a |align=\"center\"|25 |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Albums ChartUnderworld discography |align=\"center\"|61 |- |align=\"left\"|Japanese Albums ChartUnderworld discography |align=\"center\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Albums Charthttp://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/underworld/ |align=\"center\"|43 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Top Electronic Albumshttps://www.allmusic.com/artist/underworld-mn0000807949/awards |align=\"center\"|13 |} ==References== Category:Underworld (band) compilation albums Category:2003 compilation albums Category:2003 video albums Category:V2 Records compilation albums Category:V2 Records video albums Category:Junior Boy's Own video albums Category:Junior Boy's Own compilation albums Category:Underworld (band) video albums ",
