It is located in the present-day town of Karuizawa, in the Kitasaku District of Nagano Prefecture, Japan. ==History== This post town was named Oiwake, which means \"where two roads split,\" because it was at this point that the Nakasend\u014d split from the Hokkoku Kaid\u014d. In the late 17th century, during the Genroku period, it flourished as a post town that could hold over 200 guests. There are still many remnants from the Edo period in the town today. Though not a neighboring post town, Matsuida-shuku also provides a direct connection to Oiwake-shuku along the Nakasend\u014d, by way of a minor hime kaid\u014d. This hime kaid\u014d allows travelers to avoid the Usuinoseki Checkpoint, one of the major checkpoints along the highway.Hiroshige - Kisokaido . www.hiroshige.org.uk.
