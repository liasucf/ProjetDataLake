Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 19. He traveled as a Unitarian minister, preaching in Providence, Andover, Richmond, Bangor, Portland, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis.

For that journal, Cranch reviewed Emerson's Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard in August 1837 known as \"The American Scholar\". He referred to the speech as \"so full of beauties, full of original thought and illustration\" and its author as \"the man of genius, the bold deep thinker, and the concise original writer\".Carpenter, Hazen C. \"Emerson and Christopher Pearse Cranch\" in The New England Quarterly. Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 20. Cranch's connection with the Transcendentalists ultimately diminished his demand as a minister. His poetry was published in The HarbingerFelton, R. Todd.

Vol. 37, No. 1 (March 1964): 24-25. Illustrations of the New Philosophy, ca. 1844 As an artist, Cranch painted landscapes similar to the work of Thomas Cole, the Hudson River school, and the Barbizon school in France. In one foray into historical painting, Cranch depicted the burning of P. T. Barnum's American Museum in New York City. Later in life, Cranch painted scenes from Venice and Italy. Cranch's caricatures of Emerson were later bound as Illustrations of the New Philosophy: Guide. Perhaps his most well-remembered and recognized artwork is a hand-drawn caricature illustrating Emerson's concept of the \"transparent eyeball\".Robinson, David. \"The Career and Reputation of Christopher Pearse Cranch: An Essay in Biography and Bibliography\" in Studies in the American Renaissance. 1978: 455.
