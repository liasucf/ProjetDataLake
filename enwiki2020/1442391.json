    "text": "George Henry \"K.O.\" Chaney (April 16, 1892 \u2013 December 20, 1958) was a hard punching featherweight and lightweight who fought from 1910 to 1928. Known as the \"Knockout King of Fistiana\", Chaney was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Irish-American parents. Boxing Illustrated ranked him #4 all-time in terms of pound for pound punchers, while the Bleacher Report named him the #14 greatest southpaw in boxing history. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Professional career== Chaney, despite being a terrific puncher, was afflicted with a glass jaw which often was his downfall against top ranked opponents. Nevertheless, he fought many of the top lightweights and featherweights from his era, including Johnny Dundee, Rocky Kansas, Lew Tendler and Abe Attell. Chaney was selected for the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Chaney was afforded two opportunities to win a world title. On September 4, 1916 he challenged world featherweight champion Johnny Kilbane for his crown. Kilbane KO'd Chaney in round 3. His last title opportunity came when he sought to capture the newly created world junior lightweight title on November 18, 1921. Chaney met Johnny Dundee for the championship, but lost when he was disqualified in the fifth round. His bout with Rocky Kansas at old Oriole Park in 1920 was judged the most brutal and bloody bout ever held in Baltimore. == Notable bouts == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
