Various scenes are filmed in the Shibuya and Shinjuku train stations in Tokyo, Japan. Throughout the band is wearing the bright uniforms of (Koji) Japanese street construction workers. The video was a regular on Total Request Live and won the award for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.

Complex wrote that, \"We get the feeling Godzilla creator Tomoyuki Tanaka, who passed the year before the 'Intergalactic' single was released, would be proud.\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1998) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|21 |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|26 |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian Singles Chart (Flanders) |align=\"center\"|36 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian Singles Chart[ Beastie Boys - Singles] |align=\"center\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|16 |- |align=\"left\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|40 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|Norwegian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|Swedish Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|33 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|5 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|28 |- |align=\"left\"|US Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|32 |- |align=\"left\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|US Rhythmic Top 40 (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|37 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1998) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=\"center\"|21 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1998 singles Category:1998 songs Category:Beastie Boys songs Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Adam Yauch Category:Science fiction music Category:Songs written by Ad-Rock Category:Songs written by Mike D Category:Songs written by Adam Yauch Category:Songs written by Mario Caldato Jr. Category:Song recordings produced by Mario Caldato Jr. ",
