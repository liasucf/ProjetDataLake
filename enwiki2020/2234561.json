His parents were Pedro Campo Arpa and Juana Maria Pomar, his father being born in Torrijo del Campo (Teruel), Spain on 26 June 1772. The genealogy, plus photographs and documents of ex-president Campo's family can be seen in the book \"Salvadoran Roots\" by Jaime Cader, published in 2011. Rafael Campo was the first cousin of the Marqui de Campo in Valencia, Spain. (See the article in Spanish in wikipedia.org about Jos\u00e9 Campo P\u00e9rez to read the references.) Campo was elected president on 30 January 1856. He turned over power to his vice president, Francisco Due\u00f1as, on 12 May of the same year, but resumed the presidency on 19 July. He was a member of the Conservative Party. Campo stepped down after the serious cholera epidemic of 1857 had exhausted the country. He was in office during Central America's \"National War\" against William Walker and his filibusters, a very difficult time for that region. The book \"Apuntes Biog\u00e1ficos del Honorable Ex-presidente de El Salvador -Don Rafael Campo\" by Abraham Rivera (1985 edition) has a photograph of Campo with the caption saying that he is the enemy of foreign intervention in Central America. He died, aged 76, in Puerto de Acajutla on 1 March 1890. ==References== Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:1813 births Category:1890 deaths Category:People from Sonsonate Department Category:Salvadoran people of Spanish descent ",
