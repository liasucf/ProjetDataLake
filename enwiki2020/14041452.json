The second son of Thomas FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Kildare by his spouse Joan (d.1359), daughter of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, he succeeded his brother Richard, 3rd Earl, who died aged 12 in 1329. Maurice, Earl of Kildare, suppressed the insurrection in 1339 of the O'Dempsies in Leinster; and in November 1346, with Lord Justice Bermingham, forced the O'Mores to submit and give hostages for their future good behaviour. In 1346 he was himself imprisoned due to suspicion about his loyalty to the Crown, but was soon released and restored to favour. On 26 January 1347 he was summoned by Writ signed at Eltham Palace to serve King Edward III at the siege of Calais where he proceeded in May with thirty men- at-arms and was subsequently made leader of the army, and knighted.\"Fitzgerald, Maurice, 4th Earl of Kildare\", Dictionary of National Biography, (Leslie Stephen ed.), Macmillan & Co., London, 1889 With various irregulars and foot-soldiers assigned to defend County Kildare against rebel Irish, the earl was appointed, on 14 September 1358, supervisor of the four commissioners for raising and collecting their pay from that county. On 30 March 1360 he was constituted Lord Justice of Ireland with an annual salary of \u00a3500 sterling. He was made Custos of the realm again on 22 March 1371, and a third time on 16 February 1375, until the return of Sir William Windsor. In 1364 he headed a delegation of Irish nobles and officials to complain directly to King Edward III about the misgovernment of Ireland, and the corruption of certain officials, notably Thomas de Burley, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1378 he petitioned King Richard II that he had, at his request, accompanied the Lord Justice, James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond \"in a certain amount of great hosting\" of the O'Morchoes of Slewmargy (Sliabh Mairge), with numerous horsemen in his retinue, whereof six of his men were lost as well as four coats of mail and other armour. He asked for recompense, of which the King granted \u00a310 sterling from the Exchequer of Ireland on 21 May 1378. On 22 January 1377 he was summoned to the Parliament held at Castledermot; and on 11 September 1381 to that held at Trim; and on 29 April 1382 to that held at Dublin. He was, with Sir Philip Courtenay, the Lord Justice, active in imposing law and order in Leinster and Meath and elsewhere, and in resisting rebels all at his own expense. His reward came partly in the form of a grant, dated 20 April 1386, of the estate of Sir William de London in the counties of Kildare and Meath during the minority of his son and heir, John de London. On 5 August 1389 he was enfeoffed in the manors of Lucan, County Dublin, Kildrought (now Celbridge), and Kilmacredock, County Kildare, held from the Crown in capite for him and his heirs forever. On 29 May 1390 a Writ was issued to him to remove O'Connor, son of Dough O'Dempsie, the King's Irish enemy currently detained in Kildare Castle, to Dublin Castle for safer custody. He died at an advanced age in 1390, and was interred in the Church of the Holy Trinity, now Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. The Annales Hiberniae record that in 1347, after having been with the King at the siege of Calais, which was surrendered on 4th June, Maurice Fitz Thomas, Earl of Kildare was knighted by the King, and married to the daughter of Sir Bartholomew Burghersh the elder and his wife Elizabeth de Verdun, one of the heiresses of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdon.'A Genealogical History of the Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages of the British Empire'. Sir Bernard Burke LL.D., Ulster King of Arms. London, Harrison, 59 Pall Mall, 1866. Page 548. His wife is widely noted as being called Elizabeth. It is very clear that her father was Bartholomew Burghersh the elder. The reason we can be so certain is that her brother Henry's Inquisition Post Mortem was recorded in 1349. It records that he was the son of Bartholomew de Burghersh and that his heir was his brother Bartholomew, son of Bartholomew de Burghersh, aged 26 years and more. If this younger Bartholomew was aged 26 or more in 1349, he cannot have had a daughter who married Maurice Fitzgerald in 1347.'Jacobi Grace, Kilkenniensis, Annales Hiberniae', ed. by Rev. Richard Butler MRIA, published in Dublin for The Irish Archaeological Society, 1842. Page 143: 1347.
