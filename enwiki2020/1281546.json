He attended Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen and earned a postgraduate degree in teaching at Moray House in Edinburgh. ==Music career== He first saw Runrig play in 1973 and was approached one year later to become a member of the band. As lead singer of Runrig, Munro became established as a Gaelic music performer of the 1980s and 1990s. Munro left Runrig in 1997 to pursue a career in politics. His final performance was a farewell concert at Stirling Castle on 29 August. Munro released a solo album, Heart of America, done in collaboration with fellow Skye songwriters Blair Douglas and Richard Macintyre, and wo Album of the Year in the Scottish TradMusic Awards 2006. He continues to work as the Director of Development at Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig, Scotland's National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture on Skye.

He then contested the Scottish Parliament seat of Ross, Skye and Inverness West at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election for Labour, but was defeated by Liberal Democrat John Farquhar Munro. These necessitated his leaving the band, which he did in 1997. His reasons for departure were a matter for lengthy private discussion over a two-year period but were never the subject of public discourse. Munro was alleged to have given up the offer of a 'safe' Labour seat in Central Scotland as he had already agreed and been adopted as a candidate to contest his own native Highland constituency, coming close to winning this hitherto safe Liberal Democrat seat in the 1999 Scottish election. ==Honours== In 1996 he gave the Sabhal M\u00f2r Lecture.
