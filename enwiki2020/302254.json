    "text": "the area of Tsuen Wan New Town in 1961. Tsuen Wan New Town is a new town in Hong Kong. It spans Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and the eastern part of Tsing Yi Island. Traditionally, the administrative officials of Tsuen Wan managed the area of Tsuen Wan proper, Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi Island, Ma Wan and Northeast Lantau Island. In 1982 the Tsuen Wan District was created under the District Administration Scheme. In 1985, with the explosion of population in the new town, Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi were spun off to form the new Kwai Tsing District. Thus, the town is now under two administrative districts. Its total development area is about . The population of the new town is approximately 801,800, with the planned capacity being 845,000. Although Tsuen Wan New Town belongs to the New Territories, it (with Ma Wan and Northeast Lantau excluded) is also considered a part of Hong Kong metro area, like Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, the only area in New Territories classified as urban area by the Planning Department and Urban Renewal Authority.http://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/p_study/comp_s/hk2030/eng/finalreport/pdf/E_11.pdf It is because the town was developed early and is not geographically separated from Kowloon by hills or mountains. Also, there are no New Territories taxis providing service in Tsuen Wan New Town except at Tsuen Wan Station and Tsing Yi Station, unlike other new towns in New Territories. In the latest official reports, Kwai Chung New Town and Tsing Yi New Town are separated from Tsuen Wan New Town. ==See also== *List of areas of Hong Kong ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Civil Engineering and Development Department: Tsuen Wan New Town * New Territories Development Department: Hong Kong's New Towns: Tsuen Wan Category:New towns in Hong Kong Category:Kwai Chung Category:Kwai Tsing District Category:Tsing Yi Category:Tsuen Wan Category:Tsuen Wan District Category:New towns started in the 1980s ",
