Justo Ave., Corro Ave., Medina, Juan Bautista Alberdi Ave. and Mariano Acosta. ==Description and History== The barrio was named after Dalmacio V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, the 19th century author of the Argentine civil code, and a translator of Latin poems into Spanish. It is a typical low-rise housing area, that like many others was mainly populated during the urban explosion at the beginning of the 20th century. It is currently a middle-class neighborhood, among whose largely low-rise housing there are some small factories and warehouses. The first division football (soccer) club CA V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield is in fact based in the nearby barrio of Liniers, in the Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani Stadium, and not in V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield itself. The Maldonado Stream () runs through V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, which in the early 20th century was culverted. The main avenue in the barrio, named after Juan B. Justo, runs over the stream. The Maldonado was at one point a natural boundary for the city limits of Buenos Aires, before the towns of Flores and Belgrano emerged (which are now also barrios). ==External links== * Barrio Velez Sarsfield Category:Neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires ",
