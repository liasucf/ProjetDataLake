You look up on the sky there's so many possibilities and I think it's the song, the sky is the limit you can never go too far and you can never dream to big, no dream is ever to big. That's definitely a lesson I like to listen to and I'm excited for everybody else to hear.\" \"We'll Be the Stars\" was written in 2014 by Skyler Stonestreet, Cameron Walker and Steven Solomon.

The behind the scenes of the music video was premiered on March 13, 2015 in the same platforms. ==Critical reception== Dolph Malone of Headline Planet criticized the song as a Disney actress-singer standard song. She said \"[...] \u201cWe\u2019ll Be the Stars\u201d and \u201cEyes Wide Open\u201d are two of the album's weaker moments. The former is the bombastic, theatrical pop ballad one would expect of a Disney actress-singer.\" Taylor Weatherby of Billboard pointed \"\"We'll Be the Stars\" as one of Carpenter's best songs by saying \"Though Carpenter's voice is clearly great for dancier tracks, this track from her first album shows the vulnerable side to her sound -- and it's just as awesome as the more upbeat tunes.\" ==Live performances== \"We'll Be the Stars\" was performed on Radio Disney Music Awards 2015, where she did a medley with her single \"Eyes Wide Open\".
