    "text": "Erased () is a 2018 Slovenian drama film written and directed by Miha Mazzini based on his own novel of the same name. World premiere was at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival 2018, 25. November 2018, while Slovenian one was on 25. February 2019. The story of the film is dealing with the Slovenian erased citizens, almost 2% of the population that remained without a legal status after the declaration of the country's independence in 1991. ==Plot== Ana comes to the hospital to give birth. Everything goes well except for a small, bureaucratic problem: she is not in the computer. After a few days, she is entangled in a web of Kafkaesque proportions: not being in the computer means that she has no social security, no permanent address. She is suddenly a \"foreigner,\" officially at least, even though she has spent all of her life in this country. Legally, she doesn't exist. This means that her child is an orphan, and orphans must go up for adoption. ==Awards== #Miha Mazzini, best screenplay, FEST, Belgrad, 2019 #Miha Mazzini best screenplay, Raindance festival, London, 2019 #Judita Frankovi\u0107 Brdar, best leading actress, Festival os Slovenian film 2018 #Judita Frankovi\u0107 Brdar, best leading actress in coproduction, 66.
