It is part of Bremen High School District 228 which also includes Tinley Park High School, Oak Forest High School, and Bremen High School. The name \"Hillcrest\" aside from the obvious connotation of being \"the highest point of a hill\", is a portmanteau of the two towns which the school primarily serves: Country Club Hills and Hazel Crest. ==History== The first principal of Hillcrest, William Henry Reeves, was appointed in May 1965, leaving his job as principal of Bremen High School to start the new school.Reeves to head Hillcrest High, 27 May 1965, Chicago Tribune, p.
