    "text": "\u00c6thelric (died c. 1076) was the second to last medieval Bishop of Selsey in England before the see was moved to Chichester. Consecrated a bishop in 1058, he was deposed in 1070 for unknown reasons and then imprisoned by King William I of England. He was considered one of the best legal experts of his time, and was even brought from his prison to attend the trial on Penenden Heath where he gave testimony about English law before the Norman Conquest of England. ==Early life== \u00c6thelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury prior to his becoming a bishop.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 198 Several historians opine that he might have been the same as the \u00c6thelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That \u00c6thelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges becoming archbishop instead.Barlow Godwins p. 56Mason House of Godwine p. 93 The evidence is not merely that they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes the fact that he was felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.Walker Harold p. 203 \u00c6thelric was consecrated bishop in 1058 by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: volume 5: Chichester: Bishops \u00c6thelric was consecrated by Stigand, unlike most of the English bishops of the time period, because at that point, Stigand held a valid pallium, or symbol of an archbishop's authority and ability to consecrate bishops.Walker Harold pp. 137-138 ==Deposition== \u00c6thelric was deposed by the Council of Windsor on 24 May 1070 and imprisoned at Marlborough, being replaced by Stigand (not the same as the archbishop), who later moved the seat of the diocese to Chichester. It is possible, that his deposition was tied to the fact that about that time, King Harold of England's mother and sister took refuge with the count of Flanders. If \u00c6thelric was related to the Godwin's, King William I of England may have feared that the bishop would use his diocese to launch a rebellion.Walker Harold p. 193 Other reasons put forward include the fact that \u00c6thelric had been consecrated by Stigand, but the other bishop that Stigand had consecrated, Siward the Bishop of Rochester was not deposed. \u00c6thelric was a monk, and while not having a great reputation for sanctity, he was not held to be immoral either.Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 105 The pope did not feel that his deposition had been handled correctly,Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 661 so his deposition was confirmed at the Council of Winchester on 1 April 1076. It continued to be considered uncanonical, but \u00c6thelric was never restored to his bishopric.Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 46 ==Penenden Heath== \u00c6thelric was carted from imprisonment to the Trial of Penenden Heath of Odo of Bayeux, earl of Kent. This took place sometime between 1072 and 1076.O'Brien \"Forgery and the Literacy\" Albion p. 10 At that time, he was the most prominent legalist in England.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 347Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 107 He helped clarify Anglo-Saxon land laws, as the trial was concerned with the attempts of Lanfranc to recover lands from Odo.Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 182 The medieval writer Eadmer also consulted \u00c6thelric for information on Eadmer's Life of St Dunstan.Walker Harold p. 95 Presumably \u00c6thelric died soon after the trial, as he was already an old man when he attended the trial.Bates William the Conqueror p. 153 ==Note== ==Citations== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Category:1070s deaths Category:Bishops of Selsey Category:11th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Year of birth unknown ",
