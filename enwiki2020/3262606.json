    "text": "The Rhythm of Love Tour was the third concert tour by Kylie Minogue, in support of her 1990 album Rhythm of Love. Beginning on 10 February 1991, the tour visited Australia and East Asia. The concerts showcased a more confident Minogue as she began to command control over her image, as well as new songs from the album Rhythm of Love, which offered a then new sound for the Australian pop star. Costumes for the shows, with exception of the opening outfit (a Rigby Peller basque and PVC shorts) were designed by the same team as Kylie's previous two tours and marked the final time she would engage their services. Planned VHS release for the show, recorded in Sydney Australia was cancelled in favour of an updated version of the tour following its extension into Europe in late 1991. By then, it had become known as the Let's Get to It Tour in support of a new studio album of the same name, with new wardrobe, modified set list and a much more live assured Minogue. == Setlist == # \"Step Back in Time\" # \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\" # \"Got to Be Certain\" # \"Always Find The Time\" # \"Enjoy Yourself\" # \"Tears on My Pillow\" # \"Secrets\" # \"Help!\" # \"I Should Be So Lucky\" # \"What Do I Have to Do?\" # \"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\" # \"One Boy Girl\" # \"Love Train\" # \"Rhythm of Love\" # \"Shocked\" ;Encore # * \"Hand on Your Heart\" # * \"Count the Days\" # * \"The Loco-Motion\" # * \"Better the Devil You Know\" == Tour dates == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! width=\"150\"| Date ! width=\"150\"| City ! width=\"150\"| Country ! width=\"225\"| Venue |- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\" | colspan=\"4\"| Australia |- |10 February 1991 |Canberra |rowspan=\"12\"|Australia |National Indoor Sports Centre |- |13 February 1991 |Perth |Perth Entertainment Centre |- |15 February 1991 |Adelaide |Memorial Drive Park |- |16 February 1991 |Melbourne |National Tennis Centre |- |17 February 1991 |Euroa |Seven Creeks Run Amphitheatre |- |19 February 1991 |rowspan=\"2\"|Melbourne |rowspan=\"2\"|National Tennis Centre |- |20 February 1991 |- |22 February 1991 |Brisbane |Brisbane Entertainment Centre |- |23 February 1991 |rowspan=\"4\"|Sydney |rowspan=\"4\"|Sydney Entertainment Centre |- |24 February 1991 |- |26 February 1991 |- |27 February 1991 |- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\" | colspan=\"4\"| Asia |- |1 March 1991 |colspan=\"2\"|Singapore |Harbour Pavilion |- |2 March 1991 |Bangkok |Thailand |Thailand Cultural Centre |- |3 March 1991 |Kuala Lumpur |Malaysia |Stadium Negara |- |4 March 1991 |Tokyo |rowspan=\"4\"|Japan |Tokyo Bay NK Hall |- |6 March 1991 |Osaka |Osaka-j\u014d Hall |- |8 March 1991 |Nagoya |Nagoya Rainbow Hall |- |10 March 1991 |Fukuoka |Fukuoka Kokusai Center |} ==Personnel== * Kylie Minogue \u2013 producer, concept * Terry Blamey \u2013 administration * Adrian Scott \u2013 musical director * Nick Pitts \u2013 tour manager * Henry Crallam \u2013 production manager * Clive Franks \u2013 sound manager * Jonathon Smeeton \u2013 lighting director * Venol John \u2013 choreographer, dancer * Yvonne Savage \u2013 assistant * Carol Minogue \u2013 wardrobe supervisor * Adrian Scott \u2013 keyboards * John Creech \u2013 drums * Jamie Jardine \u2013 guitar * Craig Newman \u2013 bass * Tania Smith \u2013 keyboards * Gerry Ciavarella \u2013 saxophone * Nicki Nicholls \u2013 backing vocals * Deni Hines \u2013 backing vocals * James Uluave \u2013 backing vocals * Richard Allen \u2013 dancer * Cosima Dusting \u2013 dancer * Simone Kay \u2013 dancer * Mitchell Bartlett \u2013 dancer ==Notes== * The Rhythm Of Love Tour was recorded in Sydney, at the final show of the Australian leg.
