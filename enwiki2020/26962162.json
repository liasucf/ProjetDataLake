The statue of Our Lady of El Roc\u00edo certainly dates back to the first of these hermitages, though its precise date and origin are a matter of some controversy; the statue predates its garments.

It is a carved and painted wooden statue of the Virgin and Child, richly dressed in Baroque style. The eyes on the face look downward. According to Jes\u00fas Abades, it is made of birch wood. On the back of the sculpture is the legend \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Remedios\" (\"Our Lady of Remedies\"), believed to be the original name of the statue, before it became known in the 15th century as Santa Mar\u00eda de las Rocinas (later del Roc\u00edo). The statue is not realistic; rather, it is abstract and theological. Mary is represented specifically in her role as the mother of Jesus, her eyes looking down toward the child, contemplative. ===Garments=== The Virgin's garments do not date back as far as the statue itself. The tradition of dressing such devotional images dates largely from the late 16th and early 17th century. There is documentary evidence of garments for the Virgin as early as 1631, though those would not be the same garments as those used today; indeed some changes to the Virgin's garments can be specifically documented.El Vestido de la Virgen del Roc\u00edo, hermandadrociosevilla.com.

The clothes use rich fabrics and extensive brocading, but are of generally simple cut. On either side are flowers. ==Origin and modifications== Many scholars have expressed views on the date and authorship of the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo, but without reaching any clear consensus. Jos\u00e9 Alonso Morgado y Alonso, who gave the first rigorously scholarly description of the statue in 1882, believed it to be a 13th-century work, with important modifications in the early 15th century that gave it a Gothic aspect. According to Morgado, it was further modified in the 17th century when it was richly garbed in the Baroque style of the era. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda V\u00e1zquez Soto, writing in 1997, essentially endorsed this view, although he believes hathat the clothes date from the 18th century, based on their style. Sevillian historian Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez Alfonso also believes that the figure dated from the second half of the 13th century. Juan Infante-Gal\u00e1n Zambrano related the statue to a Saint Anne venerated in a church in Triana, which would also match this date. The painter Santiago Mart\u00ednez, writing in 1949, believed that the face was the original, and that the original work is generally well preserved from the waist down. However, according to Mart\u00ednez, other than the face, the upper half was significantly altered to add the clothing and the figure of the Christ child. Historians Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez G\u00f3mez and Manuel Jes\u00fas Carrasco Terriza, both from Huelva and the latter the designer of the current altarpiece of the Hermitage, date the original statue between 1280 and 1335. According to Gonz\u00e1lez and Carrasco, the statue is of French origin. They further write that the custom of dressing the statue (though possibly not in its present garb) must date back at least to 1605, based on a drawing from that date; they date this custom from the late 16th or very early 17th century. Further, they date the hands, the Christ child, and the downcast eyes of the Virgin from roughly the same time as the clothes. Several recent scholars have pointed to strong stylistic resemblances to the work of Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Alem\u00e1n (late 15th and early 16th century) or of the Flemish sculptor Roque Balduque (mid-16th century). Jes\u00fas Abades largely endorses the views of Gonz\u00e1lez and Carrasco. In his view, the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo is originally French or Central European. He agrees that it is \"mutilated\" from the waist up (with a framework for its garments replacing parts of the original). Following Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez, he dates the subsidiary figure of the Christ child to the 18th century. He considers it likely that the statue underwent significant restoration in the early 16th century, which would be consistent with the theory of involvement by Fern\u00e1ndez Alem\u00e1n. ==Notes== ==External links== * Grabados Hist\u00f3ricos de la Virgen del Roc\u00edo: historic images of the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo. * Todo sobre el Roc\u00edo: ALL ABOUT THE ROCIO * Brotherhoood of The Americas of Our Lady of Rocio: Bilingual Website of The Brotherhood of The Americas of Our Lady of Rocio Category:Catholic Church in Spain Category:Catholic pilgrimage sites Category:Statues of the Madonna and Child ",
