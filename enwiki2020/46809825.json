    "text": "St. Patrick's Day is a compilation album of phonograph records by Bing Crosby released in 1947 featuring songs with an Irish theme. This includes one of Crosby's most-beloved songs, \"Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral\" which was number four on Billboard for 12 weeks, and topped the Australian charts for an entire month, on shellac disc record. This version, the 1945 re-recording, was released earlier in another Crosby album, Selections from Going My Way. ==Reception== Billboard liked it: :Aiming at maximum holiday sales, this package of five platters brings together 10 Erin faves cut at varying times by Bing Crosby, getting vocal assist on some of the sides from the Jesters and the King's Men, while the music making belongs to Bob Haggart, Victor Young and John Scott Trotter. Der Bingle in good Erin form for each of the sides and song selections are tops ... Photo of the smiling Bing on the album cover, with notes on the singer and the songs in the accompanying booklet. Down Beat was not impressed however saying: :Bing's album, despite his usual graceful ease of interpretation, lacks his old fullness of voice. If Crosby is going to keep on making records with his evident sloppiness and lack of interest, it would be better if he would stop now and let his millions of fans remember him by his older and far better discs. The album quickly reached No. 3 in Billboard's best-selling popular record albums chart in March 1947 and was still selling well the following year when it reached No. 1 in the same chart on 20 March 1948. It was 18th in the annual chart of top selling record albums for 1948. ==Original track listing== These previously issued songs were featured on a 5-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-495. {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\" |-bgcolor=#D3D3D4 | Side / Title || Writer(s) || Recording date || Performed with || Time''' |- bgcolor=#F2F0E6 | colspan=5|Disc 1 (23495): |- | A. \"McNamara's Band\" || Shamus O'Connor and John J.
