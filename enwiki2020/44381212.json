Their purpose was to extend the proportional voting to departments with three or more senators, as well as increase the number of delegates from large cities and change the representation of French outside France (expatriate). These laws were enacted in July and August 2013. On 13 March 2013, four constitutional bills are presented to the Council of Ministers: * Elimination of the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique; * Change in the composition of the Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la magistrature (Higher Judicial Council), the appointment of prosecutors must comply with the opinion of Council; * Elimination of holding multiple offices between the Government and local executive office. The Presidents of the Republic can no longer be members of the Constitutional Council of France after their term of office; * The representative trade unions will have to negotiate before the discussion of legislation relating to labor law, employment or training. The reform of the penal code pertaining to the head of state was no longer considered. For these four texts, the government wanted a meeting of the Congress in July, but because of lack of time and sufficient majority, only the project on Higher Judicial Council was discussed in Parliament, but the Senate stripped the bill of its content. After this, the Government was forced to postpone the revisions. The text on the Supreme Judicial Council was implemented in the bill on the powers of the Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutors in criminal policy and public action, presented by the Council of Ministers on 27 March and issued July 25. On 3 April 2013, two texts are presented to the Cabinet: * Prohibition of holding local executive office at the same time as holding the office of Deputy or Senator. * Prohibition of holding local executive office at the same time as holding the office of Representative to the European Parliament. These texts were in force in 2017 instead of 2014 at the request of certain socialist. Following the Cahuzac affair, further reforms were prepared: * A draft organizing law on Prosecutor of the Republic for Finance, presented in the Council of Ministers on May 7; and legislation on the fight against tax evasion and great economic and financial crime, presented by the Cabinet on April 24; these texts were promulgated in December 2013. * :fr:Lois relatives \u00e0 la transparence de la vie publique |Draft organizing law on transparency in public life and legislation on transparency in public life , presented by the Council of Ministers on 24 April and promulgated 11 October.
