    "text": "The Revenue Act of 1936, (June 22, 1936), established an \"undistributed profits tax\" on corporations in the United States . It was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The act was applicable to incomes for 1936 and thereafter. Roosevelt sought additional permanent revenue of $620,000,000 and temporary revenue of $517,000,000. To secure the permanent revenue he suggested the substitution of a tax on undistributed earnings of corporations. Individual rates were raised only on the very rich (that is, income over $5 million a year.). Roy G. Blakey, and Gladys C.
