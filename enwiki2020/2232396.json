Principle's 1984 song \"Your Love\" is recognised as one of the first house songs. Its lyrics come from a poem that Principle wrote for his girlfriend at the time, Lisa Harris. Jamie added the music and recorded the song at home on his four-track recorder. A friend, Jose Gomez, recorded the song on tape and gave a copy to DJ Frankie Knuckles. Knuckles liked the song and played it regularly at the Chicago dance club The Power Plant. It was a sensation in the city's underground clubs for over a year before being released on Persona Records as a 12\" single.Fleming, J (1995), What kind of a House Party is this?
