IHNI runs an in-house round robin style tournament for both a Winter and Summer Cup, consisting of 6 games per team in the 'League period', to set your place for 'Playoff' semi-finals in the format of 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd. The winners of the semi-finals go on to play in the Final. == References == Category:Ice hockey governing bodies in the United Kingdom Ice Hockey Category:Ice hockey governing bodies in Europe Category:Ice hockey in Northern Ireland Category:Sports organizations established in 2011 ",
