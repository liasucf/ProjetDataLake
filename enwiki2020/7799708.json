He was titled as China's King of Medicine (, Yaowang) for his significant contributions to Chinese medicine and tremendous care to his patients. ==Books== Tianfei Palace, Nanjing Sun wrote two books - Beiji Qian Jin Yao Fang (\"Essential Formulas for Emergencies [Worth] a Thousand Pieces of Gold\") and Qian Jin Yi Fang (\"Supplement to the Formulas of a Thousand Gold Worth\") - that were both milestones in the history of Chinese medicine, summarizing pre-Tang dynasty medicine. The former listed about 5300 recipes for medicines, and the latter 2000. He also put forth the \u201cThirteen measures to keep health\u201d, which claimed that actions like touching hair, rolling eyes, walking, and shaking heads improved health.Sun Simiao, King of Medicine, Cultural China Apart from this, he is known for the text \"On the Absolute Sincerity of Great Physicians,\" often called \"the Chinese Hippocratic Oath,\" or called \"Dayi Heart\", which comes from the first chapter of the first of the above-mentioned two books. This portion of the book is still a required reading for Chinese physicians. The following is an excerpt of the text: > A Great Physician should not pay attention to status, wealth or age; neither > should he question whether the particular person is attractive or > unattractive, whether he is an enemy or friend, whether he is a Chinese or a > foreigner, or finally, whether he is uneducated or educated. He should meet > everyone on equal grounds. He should always act as if he were thinking of > his close relatives. The work Essential Subtleties on the Silver Sea (, y\u00ednh\u01cei j\u012bngw\u0113i) was probably written by Sun Simiao. It was published at the end of the Yuan Dynasty (1271\u22121368) and has had wide influence on the Chinese ophthalmology until today.Agnes Fatrai, Stefan Uhrig (eds.): Chinese Ophthalmology \u2013 Acupuncture, Herbal Therapy, Dietary Therapy, Tuina and Qigong. Tipani-Verlag, Wiesbaden 2015, . In addition to his medical work, Sun also experimented in Chinese waidan external alchemy and may have been an initiated Daoist adept.Nathan Sivin, Chinese Alchemy: Preliminary Studies (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1968). The sinologist Nathan Sivin says Sun Simiao's famous Danjing yaojue \"Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics\" > \u2026 is as close to a modern laboratory handbook as anything we are likely to > find in ancient literature. Following a preface and a catalogue of elixir > names, there is a set of detailed specifications for necessities of the > laboratory, including the liuyini \"six-one\" lute which was universally > employed in Chinese pharmacology and alchemy for the hermetical sealing of > reaction vessels. Finally, there are the recipes themselves: ingredients > grouped at the beginning, with weight and advance preparation clearly noted, > and perspicacious, concise directions for compounding and using the > products.Sivin 1968: 50. ==References== ==External links== * *Sun Simiao: Author of the Earliest Chinese Encyclopedia for Clinical Practice \u2014 Subhuti Dharmananda Category:682 deaths Category:Chinese centenarians Category:Chinese non-fiction writers Category:Medieval Chinese physicians Category:Northern Wei people Category:Northern Zhou people Category:Writers from Tongchuan Category:Physicians from Shaanxi Category:Sui dynasty people Category:Tang dynasty science writers Category:Health gods ",
