    "text": "{| |} The I.Ae. 22 DL was an Argentine advanced training aircraft designed by the Instituto Aerotecnico (AeroTechnical Institute) in 1943, with a wooden structure, which resembled the North American NA-16. ==Development== The I.Ae. 22 DL was a development of the I.Ae. D.L. 21, which itself was itself developed from the North American NA-16, at that time in service with the Argentine military. Juan Per\u00f3n flew over C\u00f3rdoba in the I.Ae.22 \"DL\" prototype, 1944. Argentine experience with the NA-16-4P and deteriorating political relations with the US led to the local development of the I.Ae. D.L. 21, which shared the NA-16 fuselage structure. However it proved too difficult to produce and an entirely new design (the I.Ae. D.L. 22) of similar configuration, but structurally different and optimized to available materials was built instead.von Rauch 1983, pp. 14\u201321 It had a wooden structure, and a nine-cylinder I.Ae. 16 El Gaucho radial engine with a Hamilton Standard 2M-D-30 metallic propeller. I.Ae.22C DL, with Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah 25 engine and 3-blade Rotol propeller The prototype flew on 8 August 1944, although some sources give 14 May 1944. Approximately 200 aircraft were built. A version with a Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah 25 radial engine and a Rotol constant speed propeller was designated I.Ae. 22- C. ==Operators== ; * Argentine Air Force * Argentine Naval Aviation ==Survivors== Restored I.Ae.22DL, Museo Nacional de Aeron\u00e1utica, Argentina Front view of the I.A.e 22 DL preserved at Museo Nacional de Aeron\u00e1utica. * A restored example, constructor number 728, is on display marked as Ea-701 at the Museo Nacional de Aeron\u00e1utica de Argentina.Dinfia I.Ae.22DL, Ea-701, Museo Nacional de Aeronautica accessdate=28 August 2012 ==Specifications (I.Ae.22 DL)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Burgos, Antonio C. \"Los 75 a\u00f1os de la F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones\"(in Spanish). aeroespacio.com.
