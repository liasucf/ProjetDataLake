    "text": "Daniel M. Liberzon is a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. He was named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2013 for his contributions to the analysis and design of switched, nonlinear and quantized control systems. He is also a fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control. ==Biography== Daniel Liberzon was born in the former Soviet Union in 1973. He did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University from 1989 to 1993. In 1993 he moved to the United States to pursue graduate studies in mathematics at Brandeis University, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1998 (supervised by Prof. Roger W. Brockett of Harvard University). Following a postdoctoral position in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Yale University from 1998 to 2000 (with Prof. A. Stephen Morse), he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, where he is now a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Coordinated Science Laboratory. His research interests include nonlinear control theory, switched and hybrid dynamical systems, control with limited information, and uncertain and stochastic systems. He is the author of the books \"Switching in Systems and Control\" (Birkhauser, 2003) and \"Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control Theory: A Concise Introduction\" (Princeton Univ. Press, 2012). He is also an editor for Automatica, where he specializes in an area of nonlinear systems and control. His work has received several recognitions, including the 2002 IFAC Young Author Prize and the 2007 Donald P. Eckman Award. He delivered a plenary lecture at the 2008 American Control Conference. ==References== ==External links== * Category:20th-century births Category:Living people Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Brandeis University alumni Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign faculty Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Fellows of the International Federation of Automatic Control Category:21st-century American engineers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
