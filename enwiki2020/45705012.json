Its leaves are crowded and pine-like, about long and wide, linear or narrow oblong and tapering to a sharp point. The flowers are white when young but turn reddish as they age. They are in heads at or near the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering. Each head contains 2 to 10 individual flowers and is about in diameter. Flowers appear in September and October and the fruit which follow are cylindrical or barrel-shaped woody capsules which retain the sepals as teeth around the edge. The fruit are long and in diameter.M. bromelioides foliage, flowers and fruitM. bromelioides habit ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca bromelioides was first formally described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Australian Systematic Botany from a specimen found near Lake King. The specific epithet (bromelioides) is a reference to the similarity of its flowers to the bromeliad growth form. ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca is confined to the Esperance region in a narrow strip between Lake King to Mount Heywood in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It grows in sandy or clayey soils on flats in a range of vegetation associations including mallee, eucalypt woodland and scrubland. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca bromelioides is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==References== bromelioides Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1988 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ",
