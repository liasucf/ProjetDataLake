Among his major publications there are also works on discourse analysis, on multimodal approaches to studying spoken language, and on sign languages. Studies carried out by Kibrik are multidisciplinary and are performed in close interaction with psychologists and neurophysiologists. He is one of the principal researchers of the Night Dream Stories project, in which the corpus of stories produced by healthy children was compared to those told by children with neurotic disorders, the results serving the basis for the methodology of psycholinguistic diagnostics.

He is also involved in research on a Russian dialect of Alaska. Kibrik has acted as a supervisor of numerous master and doctoral dissertations on the Russian sign language. He also proposed to include the Russian sign language into the official Russian census questionnaire, which afterwards led to official recognition of the Russian sign language by the Russian government.

He is also member of the editorial boards of a number of scientific journals like Studies in Language, Cognitive Linguistics, Frontiers in Cognition, among others. ==Major works== * Mira B.
