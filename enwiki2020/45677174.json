    "text": "Ipswich Community Radio (ICR FM) is a community radio station in Ipswich, Suffolk. It was awarded a full-time FM licence in 2006, and began broadcasting on 105.7FM in 2007. Ipswich Community Radio is often shortened to its well- known name of \"ICR FM\". The basic format of the station is to provide an output that is not in the mainstream and give people open opportunities to be on air through training courses. The output aim is to be an alternative, broadcasting things that other radio stations in the UK dare not broadcast. Content includes alternative music genres, speech and other locally sourced programmes. Ipswich Community Radio broadcasts its live content from Turret Lane in Ipswich, Suffolk and transmits from the Chantry area covering Ipswich Town as well as parts of Kesgrave and North Essex on 105.7FM. In 2015, the station saw its way onto the RadioPlayer platform, an exclusive Radio streaming service for consumers exclusive to Ofcom licence holders. In 2016, the station went through a lot of major changes including the move of the transmitter after 2015 building work meant a reduction in coverage. April 2016, this was rectified and the full service on FM is now restored. The station has now noticeably moved to icrfm.com on the web too. Late 2016, the station launched ICR XMAS a 24 hour Christmas music station and then in 2017 launched their new station ICR Flip online too. Summer 2017 saw a minor signal boost on 105.7fm as well as an RDS change to \"IPSWICH\", a familiar format taken by other community radio stations including Felixstowe and Chelmsford using the area name as a PS signal. Now in 2018, the station continues to service Ipswich with its vast range of genres, including the alternative \"Tommy's Rock And Metal Mayhem\" on Thursday afternoons, which just goes to show that literally all genres of music and entertainment are suitable for daytime FM airplay. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Suffolk Category:Community radio stations in the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in Ipswich ",
