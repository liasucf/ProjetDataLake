It attracted poets from all over Ireland and even as far away as Scotland. A poet would leave his own house, where he often ran a poet's school, and set off on circuit. When arriving at a lord's castle he would be given free food and board in exchange for entertaining the lord and his guests. If the lord agreed, then the poet would compose a praise poem in the chief's honour which would then be recited in front of the assembled guests and afterwards transcribed into the chief's family poem book or Duanaire, along with the poems of previous poets. In return the chief would pay the poet with cattle or a horse or gold. The poet would then leave and visit another lord's castle on the circuit, eventually returning to his own home laden with gifts. The McGovern Duanaire or Book of Magauran is the oldest such Duanaire still surviving. The earliest poem in the book was composed in honour of Brian \u2018Breaghach\u2019 M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in c.1290 and the latest poem is in honour of Niall, composed about 1362. Poems 14, 15, 17, 30, 32 & 33 are dedicated to Niall and poems 13 & 16 to his wife Sadhbh. They were composed by the following poets who visited the castle during his reign- Mac Taidhg mac Raith (poem 13); two members of the \u00d3\u2019Cl\u00famh\u00e1in family from County Sligo- Caoch Ceise \u00d3\u2019Cl\u00famh\u00e1n (poem 17) and Giolla Aonghuis \u00d3\u2019Cl\u00famh\u00e1n (poem 15); Tadhg \u00d3\u2019Domhnall\u00e1in (poem 33) and three poets from the noted poetic O'Higgins family, Mathghamhain \u00d3'hUiginn (poem 32), Niall \u00d3'hUiginn (d. 1340, poem 16, composed before 1341 when Sadhbh was married to Flaithbheartach mac Domnall Carrach O\u2019Rourke), Tadhg \u00d3'hUiginn (poem 30) and Uilliam \u00d3'hUiginn (d. 1378, poem 14). ==Personal appearance== According to the Book of Magauran, Niall was handsome, with curly hair, dark eyebrows, blue-grey eyes, red lips and white teeth. He had small feet and wore bright ornamented shoes and a green cotton tunic. He had a sweet, pleasant voice. In battle he wore a steel helmet. He was fond of horses and was a strong swimmer. His wife Sadhbh had blue eyes, black eyebrows and curly long blond hair which was braided and reached to her feet. Her hair was built up into a powdered coiffure. When her hair was being washed she wore a red robe and was attended by a line of kneeling maids. She did embroidery on satin and depicted lions, dragons, horses, birds and herds of oxen fleeing from a golden wolf. She worked her husband's name into the tapestry and also engraved it on the stem of his wine goblets, which had fine carvings and thin stems. She liked boating, swimming and riding horses. She wore an ornamented girdle on her waist with four buckles. She also wore coloured satin garments containing twisted golden thread and a scarlet cloak. ==Death== Niall died in 1359 but some annals give a later date. The Annals of Ulster for 1359 state- Niall Mag Samradhain, chief of Tellach-Eathach, died. The Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1362 state- Niall Magauran, Chief of Teallach Eachdhach, died. The Annals of Connacht 1362 state- Niall Mag Samradain, chieftain of Tullyhaw, rested. The Annals of Loch C\u00e9 for 1362 state- Niall Mac Samhradhain, dux of Tellach-Echach, quievit. ==Family== Niall married Sadhbh (d. 1373), the daughter of Cathal mac Domhnall \u00d3 Conchobair (d. 1324), King of Connacht from 1318 to 1324, and his wife Ailbhe. She had previously been married (from before 1340 until 1352) to Flaithbheartach mac Domnall Carrach O\u2019Rourke, King of Breifne O\u2019Rourke from 1346 to 1349 (deposed 1349, died 1352) who was the brother of Ualgarg M\u00f3r \u00d3 Ruairc also king of Breifne from 1316 to 1346. Niall's sons were Tighearn\u00e1n M\u00f3r, Ruadhr\u00ed, E\u00f3ghan and C\u00faChonnacht. Flaithbheartach O'Rourke's sons, some or all by Sadhbh and therefore Niall's step-sons, were Maelsechlainn (d. 1401), Domhnall, C\u00faChonnacht, Fergal, Tighern\u00e1n na Lurgan, Art and Concobhar. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1400 mentions their fate- The sons of Flaherty O'Rourke were banished from Breifny; and they went to Tirconnell, and brought some of the Kinel-Connell with them into Breifny, where they committed great depredations on O'Rourke, and carried away the spoils into Tirconnell. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1401 state- A war afterwards broke out between O'Donnell and Brian, the son of Henry O'Neill; for Brian had led an army into Tirconnell, and had attacked the fortress of O'Donnell, and killed the son of Niall Oge, son of Niall Garv, son of Hugh, son of Donnell Oge O'Donnell, and Melaghlin, son of Flaherty O'Rourke, and many others. ==References== Category:1359 deaths Category:Irish lords Category:People from County Cavan Category:14th-century Irish people ",
