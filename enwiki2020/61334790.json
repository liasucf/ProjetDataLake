    "text": "' is an Apollo near-Earth asteroid roughly in diameter. The asteroid has a 0.41% chance (1 in 240) of impacting Earth on 2 November 2020 01:12 UT. It was discovered on 3 November 2018 when it was about from Earth and had a solar elongation of 165 degrees. The asteroid has a short 12.9 day observation arc and has not been detected since November 2018. The JPL Horizons 2 November 2020 nominal Earth approach is estimated to be roughly . The line of variations (LOV, uncertainty region) allows the asteroid to impact Earth or pass as far away as . Its diameter of 2\u20134 meters makes it approximately 100\u20131000 times less massive than the 20-meter Chelyabinsk meteor. An Earth- impact by this asteroid, assuming it is a common primitive chondrite, might rattle some windows after an airburst and/or drop pebble-sized meteorites on roof tops after dark flight. == Description == has a low 3.2\u00b0 orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic plane and an Earth-MOID of only 9700 km. Since the asteroid last approached Earth in November 2018 and has a 2.00 year orbital period, the asteroid will approach Earth again around 2 November 2020 (\u00b13 days). Where Earth will be on a given date is known, but given the short observation arc and having not been observed since 2018 where precisely the asteroid will be on its orbit is not. The asteroid will intersect Earth's orbit. A slight variation in the known orbit of the asteroid can cause the asteroid to be early (NEODyS solution), right on time (Sentry solution), or late (JPL solution). The nominal NEODyS 1 November 2020 23:54 UT Earth approach is . The Sentry Risk Table shows an estimated 1 in 240 chance of the asteroid impacting Earth on 2 November 2020 1:12 UT. The nominal JPL Horizons 2 November 2020 11:33 UT Earth approach is with a 3-sigma uncertainty of . {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;\" |+Line of variation (LOV) and different closest approaches !

Large ground-based observatories take 10 hours to image a magnitude ~28 object. The Hubble Space Telescope needs 3 weeks of exposure time to image magnitude 31 objects. The November 2020 Earth approach will be hidden by the glare of the Sun due to the asteroid's low solar elongation in that time. Since the asteroid is only about in diameter it is too small to do more than create a bolide and common strewn field similar to the Sutter's Mill meteorite or 2014 AA. It is not categorized as a potentially hazardous object given the estimated size is smaller than the threshold for potentially hazardous objects which are estimated at more than 140 meters in diameter. == Notes == == References == == External links == * List Of Apollo Minor Planets (by designation), Minor Planet Center * * * IAWN: 2018 VP1 Geometry (2018 Approach) * Table of Asteroids Next Closest Approaches to the Earth \u2013 Sormano Astronomical Observatory # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) Category:Potential impact events caused by near- Earth objects 20201102 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 2018 ",
