It directs light up towards the ceiling and down adjacent walls.http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/resources/publications/lpbh/074Architectural.pdf It may be used as primary lighting, or for aesthetic accent, especially to highlight decorative ceilings. Cove lighting is valued because it hides the fixtures, and because it provides a very even light. == Types of cove lights== One method of installing cove lighting is by using T5 fluorescent tubes. T5 luminaires are an energy-efficient alternative to larger luminaires (such as T8 lamps) because they save on materials.http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightingAnswers/lat5/pc12.asp An even better energy-efficient alternative is to use LED strips, mounted on an aluminium profiles for optimum heat dissipation, with prismatic covers. With a dimming controller (either analog 1..10V controls or digital, DALI based), the cove lighting can be dimmed. A wide range of LEDs are available, from warm white, daylight and even colour changing RGB modules. ==Installation== Lighting specialists recommend installing cove lighting at least from the ceiling and from the floor.http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/resources/publications/lpbh/074Architectural.pdfhttp://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/lightingtransformation/residentiallighting/buildersguide/luminairesArch.asp In kitchens, cove lights can be installed on the top of kitchen cabinets. Luminaire strips should overlap the tubes to reduce the shadow effect at the lamp ends. == References == Category:Lighting Category:Architectural lighting design ",
