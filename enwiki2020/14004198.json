    "text": "Saint Praejectus, Prejectus or Projectus (; ) (625\u2013676) was a bishop of Clermont, who was killed together with Amarinus. Born in the Auvergne to the lesser nobility, he studied under Genesius of Clermont. He was ordained a priest and, with the approval of Childeric II, became bishop of Clermont in 666. Praejectus founded monasteries, hospitals, and churches. He was killed as a result of political struggles of the day. Hector, lord of Marseilles, had been accused of various crimes, and at the order of Childeric, had been arrested and executed. Agritius, the man who killed Praejectus, believed that the bishop had been responsible for Hector\u2019s death. At Volvic, the assassin thus stabbed to death Praejectus and Amarinus, abbot of a monastery in the area. The death of Praejectus was linked to that of Saint Leger (Leodegarius). St. Leger was an opponent of Ebroin, mayor of the palace of Neustria on two occasions; firstly from 658 to his deposition in 673 and secondly from 675 to his death in 680 or 681. In a violent and despotic career, he strove to impose the authority of Neustria, which was under his control, over Burgundy and Austrasia. Ebroin\u2019s supporters, which included Praejectus, St. Reol of Rheims, St. Agilbert of Paris, and St. Ouen of Rouen, held a council of bishops that sat in judgment on Leger, at Marly, near Paris. Praejectus\u2019 murderer may have been a supporter of Leger, who was later murdered on October 2, 679.Henry Hart Milman, History of Latin Christianity (T.Y. Crowell, 1881), 398.Barbara H. Rosenwein, Emotional Communities in the Early Middle Ages (New York: Cornell University Press, 2006), 170. ==Veneration== An account of Praejectus\u2019 life was written shortly after his death and he was immediately venerated as a martyr. The account was written perhaps by 690, as it was written during the lifetime of Bishop Avitus of Clermont. The author may have been a nun from the monastery of Chamali\u00e8res. Chamali\u00e8res was a monastery founded through Praejectus\u2019 efforts, and it was presided over by an abbess who was probably a member of Praejectus\u2019 family. The author may also have been a monk from Volvic or Saint-Amarin. During the time of Charlemagne, Abbot Manasses of Flavigny Abbey transferred from Volvic to Flavigny the relics of Praejectus. His cultus spread to English monastic calendars. The church at Volvic, where Praejectus was killed, is dedicated to \u201cSt Priest\u201d (Projectus).Bienvenue sur le site de la commune de Volvic In 1278, some of his relics (a finger) were translated to the town of Saint-Prix (Val-d'Oise). The valley of Saint-Amarin was named after Amarinus. Image:Saint-Prix - Plaque saint Pry.jpg|Commemorative plaque at Saint-Prix, Val d'Oise.
