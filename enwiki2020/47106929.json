    "text": "Correspondence (A Fiction) is second studio album by Levi the Poet, and he released the album on November 17, 2014. ==Critical reception== Jordan Gonzales, giving the album three and a half stars for HM Magazine, writes, \"Correspondence is a chaotic and beautiful mess of supercharged spoken word set to a documentary soundtrack of a backbone that avoids clich\u00e9s.\" Awarding the album four and a half stars from Jesus Freak Hideout, Mark Rice states, \"this album contains all the tools necessary for it to do so; a compelling story, an emotive score, superb writing, excellent delivery, and thoughtful content.\" Scott Fryberger, rating the album four and a half stars at Jesus Freak Hideout, says, \"This is one of Levi's finest releases; if you're a fan of his or a fan of wonderful storytelling, this is an album for you.\" Giving the album four stars by Indie Vision Music, Ian Zandi describes, \"While the stories may have depressing notes, he tells it like it is. Honest.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2014 albums Category:Levi the Poet albums Category:2010s spoken word albums Category:Spoken word albums by American artists ",
