    "text": "The 2019 American Ultimate Disc League season was the eighth season for the league. It began on April 5, 2019, and concluded on August 11, 2019, when the New York Empire defeated the Dallas Roughnecks to earn the team's first title. Ben Jagt of the Empire won his first league MVP award after the season. The season marked Steve Hall's first as league commissioner, and was the first with an all-star game for the league. == Offseason == In early October 2018, AUDL franchise owners selected Steve Hall, a co-owner of the Atlanta Hustle, to be the new league commissioner for a three-year term. He succeeds previous commissioner Steve Gordon. Around the same time, the league announced tentative plans for a women's ultimate league to be started as early as 2020. Adding to the new endeavors, AUDL added an all-star game for the first time in league history and accordingly shortened the schedule from 14 to 12 regular- season games. 2019 marked the second year of the league's television agreement with Stadium. Two teams folded over the offseason, the San Francisco FlameThrowers and the Nashville NightWatch. No new teams joined the league for the 2019 season. == Regular season == Each team played twelve games, contested over fifteen weeks in the regular-season schedule. ===Week 1=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !
