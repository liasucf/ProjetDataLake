    "text": "The Phillips County Penal Farm Historic District encompasses a former prison facility in Phillips County, Arkansas. It is located on the east side of County Road 353, south of United States Route 49, about halfway between Helena-West Helena and Marvell. The complex consists of three concrete structures, a water tower, and a concrete foundation pad. The main building is a cast concrete structure, two stories in height, with Plain Tradition and International styling, while the other two buildings are single-story concrete block structures. These, and the water tower, were built c. 1935\u201337 with funding from the Works Progress Administration, and served as a penal facility until 1973. The property is now vacant and abandoned. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas File:Phillips County Penal Farm Historic District, 5 of 6.JPG|Graffiti inside a building.
