    "text": "was a Japanese daimy\u014d of the early Edo period. He was the 3rd daimy\u014d from the T\u014dd\u014d clan to rule Tsu Domain in Ise and Iga Provinces. ==Biography== Takahisa was the eldest son of T\u014dd\u014d Takatsugu, the 2nd daimyo of Tsu Domain. In 1669, he became daimyo upon his father\u2019s retirement. Takahisa initially was popular for implementing many of the economic reforms begun by the previous administration, including large-scale irrigation works and the development of new rice lands. However, his ban on mining of clay around Shiratoyama effectively destroyed the ceramics industry in Iga Province, and caused many potters to leave his domain for nearby Shigaraki in \u014cmi Province. Takahisa was married to the daughter of the tair\u014d Sakai Tadakiyo, who fell from favor in 1680 and who died under sudden circumstances in 1681. To avoid political troubles, Takahisa quickly associated himself with Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's favorite, Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, to the extent that he was derided by his peers as \"Yanagisawa's footmat\". However, when Yanagisawa attempted to force the childless Takahisa to adopt his younger son as heir, the suicides of a number of his senior retainers prevented this from occurring. Instead, the domain went to Takahisa's younger brother, T\u014dd\u014d Takachika on his death in 1703. ==External links== * T\u014dd\u014d family information ==Notes== Category:Daimyo Category:1638 births Category:1703 deaths ",
