    "text": "Starship SN5 during test flight in August 2020 Since 2019, prototypes of the upper stage of SpaceX Starship have been flown 5 times. Designed and operated by private manufacturer SpaceX, the prototypes of Starship include Starhopper, Mk1, SN1, SN3, SN4, SN5, SN6, along with the never-completed Mk2 and Mk4. The Starship is planned to be a fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle, and unusual for previous launch vehicle and spacecraft designs, the upper stage of Starship is intended to function both as a second stage to reach orbital velocity on launches from Earth, and also be used in outer space as an on-orbit long-duration spacecraft. In 2018, Elon Musk also planned to send some space tourists (including Yusaku Maezawa) in a lunar flyby in 2023, as part of the #dearMoon project. In 2019, SpaceX planned to launch commercial payloads using Starship no earlier than 2021. In the same year, Space.com said that SpaceX may fly Starship to the Moon in 2022. Musk also plans to send cargo Starship missions to Mars in 2022, followed by a crewed Starship mission to Mars in 2024. == Flight statistics == == Suborbital test flights == == Future orbital flights == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Vehicle ! scope=\"col\" | Notes |- | 2021 | Starship cargo | , SpaceX said a commercial flight could be as early as 2021. |- | 2022 (TBD) | Starship | Potential flight to the Moon, according to journalist Mike Wall. |- |2022 |Starship cargo |Potential cargo flights to Mars. |- | no earlier than 2023 | Starship crew | Plan for a flyby loop around the Moon.

According to space journalist Mike Wall, Elon Musk is said to envision that eventually more than 1,000 Starships could be needed to depart for Mars every 26 months, which could lead to the development of a sustainable Martian city in 50\u2013100 years. == See also == * List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches * List of Space Launch System launches * List of Atlas launches (2020\u20132029) * List of Thor and Delta launches (2020\u20132029) == References == flights Starship ",
