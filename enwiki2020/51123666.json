In the 2017\u201318 season, Skleni\u010dka played in 49 games on the blueline for Plze\u0148, registering 14 points and a plus-minus +17 rating. The 21-year-old added one goal and one assist in 10 playoff games. On May 28, 2018, Skleni\u010dka as an undrafted free agent, signed a two-year entry-level contract with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). Approaching the final year of his contract with the Canadiens in the 2019\u201320 season, Skleni\u010dka continued his tenure with American Hockey League affiliate, the Laval Rocket. After just 7 games through the opening months of the season with the Rocket, and gaging his chance to appear in the NHL limited, Skleni\u010dka was placed on unconditional waivers by the Canadiens and mutually released from his contract on 7 December 2019. On 12 December 2019, he was signed for the remainder of the season to join Finnish club, Jokerit, of the KHL. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
