    "text": "The next Asturian regional election will be held no later than Sunday, 28 May 2023, to elect the 12th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias. All 45 seats in the General Junta will be up for election. ==Overview== ===Electoral system=== The General Junta of the Principality of Asturias is the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Asturias, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Asturian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Voting for the General Junta is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in Asturias and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Asturians abroad are required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as \"begged\" or expat vote (). The 45 members of the General Junta of the Principality of Asturias are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of three percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Seats are allocated to constituencies, which are established as follows: *Central District *Eastern District *Western District Each constituency is allocated an initial minimum of two seats, with the remaining 39 being distributed in proportion to their populations. The use of the D'Hondt method may result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the district magnitude. ===Election date=== The term of the General Junta of the Principality of Asturias expires four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the General Junta ae fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 26 May 2019, setting the election date for the General Junta on Sunday, 28 May 2023. The president has the prerogative to dissolve the General Junta and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence is in process, no nationwide election is due and some time requirements were met: namely, that dissolution does not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution under this procedure. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the General Junta shall be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances will not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remains of their four- year terms. ==Parliamentary status== The table below shows the status of the different parliamentary groups in the General Junta at the present time. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:96%; text-align:left;\" |+ Current parliamentary composition |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Groups ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Parties ! colspan=\"2\"| Legislators |- !

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage- point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 23 seats are required for an absolute majority in the General Junta of the Principality of Asturias. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\" |- style=\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! style=\"width:250px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\"width:125px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Fieldwork date ! style=\"width:50px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sample size ! style=\"width:45px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Turnout ! style=\"width:35px;\"| PSOE ! style=\"width:35px;\"| PP ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Cs ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Podemos ! style=\"width:35px;\"| IU/IX ! style=\"width:35px;\"| FAC ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Vox ! style=\"width:35px;\"| link=Unidas Podemos ! style=\"width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Lead |- ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 1 Apr\u201315 May 2020 |? |? | | 43.3 | 19.6 | 7.2 | 5.8 | 7.2 | 5.0 | 10.0 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 23.7 |- | SyM Consulting | 4\u20136 May 2020 | 1,194 | 62.2 | | 43.9 | 19.8 | 6.4 | 6.3 | 6.6 | 4.2 | 11.1 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 24.1 |- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\" | November 2019 general election | 10 Nov 2019 | | 58.1 | | 33.3 | 23.2 | 6.7 | | | | 15.9 | 16.0 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 10.1 |- | colspan=\"13\" style=\"background:#A0A0A0\"| |- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\" | 2019 regional election | 26 May 2019 | | 55.1 | | 35.3 | 17.5 | 14.0 | 11.0 | 6.6 | 6.5 | 6.4 | \u2013 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 17.8 |- | colspan=\"13\" style=\"background:#A0A0A0\"| |} ==Notes== ==References== ;Opinion poll sources ;Other Asturias 2020s ",
