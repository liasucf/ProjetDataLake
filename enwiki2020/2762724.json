She joined the programme in January 1993 as its first ever weather presenter. ==Career== Oza is said to have been \"discovered at an audition day\" organised by members of the BBC's Multi-Cultural Programmes Unit, who were actually in search of new faces for Network East. Oza was one of the first Asian faces to be frequently seen on television in the region. She joined Midlands Today in 1993 as the programme's first weather presenter; since then her role has included producing weather-related news and community features. One of her reports was as a result of becoming the first female civilian to spend a week on the Royal Navy submarine HMS Splendid. She was awarded an Honorary Masters degree from University College Worcester in 2003, in recognition of her achievements in broadcasting. Along with weather reporting and news presenting, Oza has fronted regional contributions to the BBC's live national programming and campaigns such as Children in Need. ==Personal life== Before beginning her media career, Oza trained as a solicitor. Her father is a GP based in Nottingham. During her time on Midlands Today Oza met her husband-to-be Jamie Knights, who worked as her cameraman. Their wedding ceremony was featured on the news programme. The couple divorced two years later. As of 2016, Oza resided in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley. == References == ==External links== *Shefali Oza's Midlands Today profile *Shefali Oza's website Category:BBC people Category:BBC weather forecasters Category:English journalists Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:English people of Indian descent ",
