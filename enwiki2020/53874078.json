She has compared substandard care of public greenery to foot binding. ==Political career== She was named to the Legislative Yuan via the proportional representation party list system as a representative of the People First Party. As a legislator, Chang continued supporting a wide range of green causes. In March 2012, she proposed that the government provide aid to single women, advising Taiwanese men against transnational marriage, calling the practice a \"strange habit.\" Chang's comments drew criticism from multiple civic groups.
