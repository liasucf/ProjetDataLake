Prior to that, its construction site had been shown on maps as the generic Bay View Stadium. It was the first modern baseball stadium, as it was the first to be built entirely of reinforced concrete. Richard Nixon threw out the first baseball on the opening day of Candlestick Park on April 12, 1960, and called it the finest ballpark in the country.The Best Game Ever, Prologue, p. xxx, Jim Reisler, Carroll & Graf Publishers, New York, 2007, === Roster === {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: black; color: #FFFDD0; text-align: center;\" | 1960 San Francisco Giants |- | colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #fd5a1e; color: #FFFDD0; text-align: center;\" | Roster |- | valign=\"top\" | Pitchers * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Catchers * * * Infielders * * * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Outfielders * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Manager * * Coaches * * * |- |} == Player stats == === Batting === ==== Starters by position ==== Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pos ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" |} ==== Other batters ==== Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" | || 106 || 328 || 91 || .277 || 1 || 27 |- align=\"center\" | || 6 || 10 || 0 || .000 || 0 || 0 |- align=\"center\" |} === Pitching === ==== Starting pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" |} ==== Other pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 43 || 202.2 || 8 || 13 || 3.20 || 145 |- align=\"center\" | || 41 || 112.1 || 6 || 7 || 3.77 || 57 |- align=\"center\" |} ==== Relief pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SV ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 37 || 3 || 2 || 5 || 4.93 || 28 |- align=\"center\" | || 19 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 5.32 || 13 |- align=\"center\" |} == Awards and honors == All-Star Game, first game All-Star Game, second game == Farm system == LEAGUE CO-CHAMPIONS: SpringfieldJohnson, Lloyd, and Wolff, Miles, ed., The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, 2nd and 3rd editions.
