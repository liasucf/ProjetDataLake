    "text": "Thirupalkadal SreeKrishna Temple (Thiruparkadal Sreekrishnaswamy Temple) is one of the oldest Hindu temples dedicated to the god Vishnu (Worshipped as Krishna), located in the village Keezhperoor, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India. The central icon is a four-armed standing Vishnu carrying the conch Panchajanya(Turbinella pyrum), the discus Sudarshana Chakra, the mace Kaumodaki and a lotus with a Holy basil garland. The principal deity, Krishna(Thirupalkadal Bhattarakar) was the family deity of Ay Family, who ruled over the place during the Sangam period. The kingdom and the family later came to be known as Venad Keezhperoor Swaroopam. In the early medieval Tamil literature canon of the Tamil Alvar saints (6th\u20139th centuries AD), the temple is one of the 108 principal Divya Desams (\"Holy Abodes\") in Vaishnavism, and is glorified in the Divya Prabandha. The Divya Prabandha glorifies this shrine as being among the 14 Divya Desam in Malai Nadu (corresponding to present-day Kerala and Kanyakumari). It is believed that Kulashekhara Alwar, considered the seventh in the line of the twelve Azhwars, renovated this temple.The Temple legends of this temple are closely intertwined with that of the empires and kingdoms that ruled Tamizhagam and the state presently known as Kerala. The history of this Temple is closely intertwined with the Chera and Chola Empires and the Kingdoms of Venad and Travancore. This Temple is located in the Keezhperoor village, Chirayinkeezhu Taluk, Thiruvananthapuram District, Kerala. This Temple is located in a peaceful and serene rustic countryside. The temple is constructed in the ancient Dravidian style, with the presence of Lord Brahma and Lord Siva in the outer wall of circular shaped Garbhagriha, which forms the presence of Parabrahma. The roof of the sanctum sanctorum is formed by 36 rafters carved in 12 wooden pieces (of 30 Degrees each), representing the 12 Rasis which when multiplied by 3 (the number representing the Hindu Trimurti) equals 108 which is the number of peethas of Adi Parashakti. It is also believed that the Kollam Era started with the renovation of this temple. ==History== Thirupalkadal Sreekrishnaswamy temple is known as Adikulakovil of Ay kingdom. The temple was constructed by the Ay Kingdom(Kupaka), who were ruling the place with their capital at Keezhperoor during the sangam periode. This family was later known as Venad and then 'Thiruvadi' and 'Thiruvithamkur' which was finally corrupted into Travancore. According to Dr. M.G Sasibhooshan, a famous historian, the temple was constructed about 2000 years ago with a square shaped Sreekovil by Ay Dynasty's Keezhperoor Swaroopam. The temple was renovated in 9th century AD by the Venad King Vallabhan Kotha of Keezhperoor Illam. The Keezhperoor Swaroopam was formed by the merger of the Chera dynasty based at Mahodayapuram with the Ays of Vizhinjam. ==Administration== During classical period the temple were administered by the Ay royal family of Keezhperoor illam. In 12th century CE, 343 ME the temple administration were handed over to uralar sabha a council consisting of Brahmins and Madambi Nairs in the ratio 8:2 by Sri Vira Udayamarttandavarman Tiruvadi, ilayaguru of Venad. He also fixed the expenditure of the temple in respect of the conduct of the daily bali- ceremony and other expenses connected with god's worship and yearly festival of the temple. The village of Kilimanoor with the forests, arable lands and compound sites included in it was granted by the King for the expenses connected with feeding of Brahmans and conducting local temple festivals. 3 para of paddy required for the daily expenses of the temple. 31 nali rice was given to temple servants as salary. The temple had 1 melsanthi, 2 kizhsanthis, and 12 servants including flower supplier, watchman, woman servant, and drummers. Total amount of 5 Achchu was collected from Melsanthi, Kizhsnthi, Variyan, Pallittayam as entrance fees and this amount was to be utilised for the purchase of or repairs to the temple utensils and other wastages without allowing koyimars and uralars who superintended the temple affairs to utilise any portion of it for their own use. This expenditure had to be looked after by batches of two persons for each year. If the above expenses were not properly administered, the incumbents of the year will have to vacate their posts in the Uralma and that they should also settle any slight disputes or entanglements that they may occur with reference to the temple holdings or to the temple itself. The temple flourished till mid of 20th Century with its tremendous impact on the socio-cultural fields. Till 26/12/1965, Managing Trustee of the Thirupalkadal Devaswom was Brhmasree Narayanaru Narayanaru of Amunthuruthimadom(keezhcheri)one of the prominent Malayala Namboothiri illom situated at Attingal Near Manampoor Alamcode(chirayinkeezhTaluk.,Thiruvananthapuram District,Kerala State,India)(they are also the Managing Trustee Thirumanampoor Subramanya Temple) belonging to Chenganoor Malayalam Namboothiri Brahmana Illom they are also the representative of His Highness Maharaja of erstwhile Travancore in Thiruvattar Adikesava Perumal Temple.
