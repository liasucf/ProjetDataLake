He was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after they were nominated by their Division of Materials Physics in 2007, for \"experimental studies of ferroelectric thin film physics, that have established the relationships between epitaxial strain, ferroelectric phase transition behavior and domain structure, and size effects, and for advancing the fundamental understanding of complex oxide thin film microstructure.\" == References == Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:People from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:Stanford University School of Engineering alumni Category:Rice University alumni Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American Physical Society Category:American physicists ",
