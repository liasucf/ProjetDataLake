The team lost to its in-state rivals Michigan State Normal (7\u201313) and Western State Teachers (0\u201319).

Van Bibber had been a guard at Purdue, graduating in 1932. In three seasons at Central State, Van Bibber compiled a 12\u20139\u20132 record. ==Schedule== ==References== ==External links== * 1934 Chippewa yearbook Central State Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Central State Bearcats football ",
