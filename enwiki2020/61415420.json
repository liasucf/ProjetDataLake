It adopted the Napoleon III style. It was constructed between 1839-1864, from red brick and stone The structure is surrounded by 7.4 acres of grounds, in English Garden style. To the East is the river Indre alongside the driveway and entrance, and the famous 'three bridges' connecting the Royal City of Loches to the Island, and to the village of Beaulieu-les-Loches on the opposite river bank. The island is surrounded by the Park of the Royal Prairies, and a wetlands reserve, a wildlife sanctuary of approximately 305 hectares of protected parkland surrounding Armaill\u00e9, where the Indre river valley separates the villages. To the West, the border is a modern hospital and the fortified Medieval village of Loches; and to the north, helipads, fields and forests. == History == The Ch\u00e2teau was built for the Count Arthur de Marsay in 1859. it originally featured 9 bedrooms. It was constructed on the site of an ancient Capuchin monastery, which was transformed following the French Revolution to become an 80 room, private hunting lodge and home in the middle of the Royal Forest. Named after his daughter, Viscountess Armaill\u00e9, it remained in the family until 1947, when it was purchased by the State. The castle was extended to the west in the late 1800s, and served as the archives for the French Marine Department during World War II. The estate was renovated in the 1970s, and then again in the 2000s, when the stables hosted the office of the Sous Pr\u00e9fecture, and the residence accommodated the local Sous and Sub Prefects. In 2019, the property was sold by the local department and returned to private residential use. ==Construction== November 29th 2019; view of the main building complex, in autumn. Formal entrance and public facade, on the south aspect of the Chateau d'Armaille, Loches It was built of Tuffeau and red brick. Like numerous buildings in the Loire Valley, the walls, stables, and most of the main building use blocks of tuffeau stone interlaced with red brick, giving a modern, English appearance. Tuffeau stone is not dense, and can absorb 50% of its mass in water when wet; weighing only 20% more than water when dry. This makes it prone to decay when temperatures fall below freezing during damp, cold weather, a frequent occurrence. Other examples of this stone's use exist, including the Ch\u00e2teau de Beaulieu near Saumur, the Ch\u00e2teau d'Uss\u00e9 and the Ch\u00e2teau de la Motte d'Usseau, and many worker's cottages at Long\u00e8res. ==Royal City== The central location of the Ch\u00e2teau d'Armaill\u00e9 and its large park is relatively unique due to its proximity to the Royal City, within the township of Loches. Its role as the Head of Government Service made it an \"important part of the French state\". While many other Renaissance style ch\u00e2teaux flourished in the Loire Valley, medieval fortresses such as Royal City of Loches make these surroundings fairly unique, because of the Ch\u00e2teau d'Armaille's close proximity to the center of such a historic urban region. Due to the character of its residence and keep, Loches is one of the most beautiful fortified cities in France, and the royal citadel dominates the surrounding skyline with Indre's bucolic valley and the medieval townships on either side. The 37-metre high fortified royal keep is an unusual feature of any Chateau in the Loire Valley, and a \"masterpiece\" of 11th-century military architecture and one of the most well preserved in Europe. Now a museum, its numerous painted and engraved inscriptions, the city and citadel immerse visitors in the universe of the time. ~New York Times - 08/18/1991: \"The Stone Fortress of Loches\" ==Modern use== According to French newspaper La Nouvelle Republic, Armaill\u00e9 returned to private ownership in 2019. The change of ownership resulted in the property reverting to usage as a 5 bedroom hunting lodge, as it was when purchased by the state in 1947. The property retains a large lake, five registered outbuildings to accommodate staff and guests, and six bridges and canal crossings. Between 2019 and 2025, some department staff were expected to remain in the Sub Prefecture annex. However, the main building will once again serve as a private residence, this time for a technology-based family from Montreal, with roots in the nearby Poitou- Charentes r\u00e9gion and Le Mans. The building contains more than 1,500m\u00b2 of refurbished, inhabitable space, four outbuildings (1000m\u00b2) all set in a park of 3 hectares (7.4 acres). == References == Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Indre-et- Loire Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1859 ",
