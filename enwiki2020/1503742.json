    "text": "Yongqi (23 March 1741 - 16 April 1766), courtesy name Junting, art name Tengqin Jushi, formally known as Prince Rong, was a Manchu prince of the Qing dynasty. He was the fifth son of the Qianlong Emperor. Arguably the most outstanding among the Qianlong Emperor's sons, he was, at one point, considered by his father as a potential heir to the throne. However, he died prematurely at the age of 25. ==Life== Yongqi was born in the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan as the fifth son of the Qianlong Emperor. His mother was Noble Consort Yu (\u6109\u8cb4\u5983), who was from the Mongol Keliyete (\u73c2\u91cc\u8449\u7279) clan. Yongqi was studious and diligent from a young age. Every day, of all the princes, he was the earliest to reach the palace study to attend classes. He had a close relationship with his younger brother, Yongyan. Yongqi was talented - he was fluent in the Manchu and Mongol languages, he was versed in astronomy, geography and calendrical calculation. One of his works was the Jiaotong Tenggao (\u8549\u6850\u5e50\u7a3f). Yongqi was versed in poetry, painting, and calligraphy. He was also skilled in horse-riding and mounted archery. His talents earned him the favour of his father, the Qianlong Emperor. In 1763, a fire broke out in the Old Summer Palace, and Yongqi carried his father on his back and brought him to safety. Two years later, the Qianlong Emperor conferred Yongqi the title \"Prince Rong of the First Rank\", making Yongqi the first of the Qianlong Emperor's sons to officially receive a princely title. Besides the Chinese character \"Rong\" (\u69ae) in the title literally means \"glory\" or \"honour\", which showed that the Qianlong Emperor had high hopes for Yongqi. Yongqi died in 1766 after suffering from bone tuberculosis for several months. He was already ill when he was made \"Prince Rong\". He was granted the posthumous name \"Chun\" (\u7d14; \"pure\"), so his full posthumous title was extended to \"Prince Rongchun of the First Rank\" (\u69ae\u7d14\u89aa\u738b). ==Tomb== Yongqi was buried with the Qianlong Emperor's eldest son, Yonghuang (\u6c38\u749c; 1728\u20131750), who also died in his 20s. The tomb, sometimes referred to as the \"Crown Prince Tomb\" (\u592a\u5b50\u9675), is located in northern part of eastern Beijing near Bulaotun Town (\u4e0d\u8001\u5c6f\u93ae). In 1958 the tomb was demolished to make way for the construction of the Miyun Reservoir (\u5bc6\u96f2\u6c34\u5eab). Its contents were carefully excavated and transferred to the Capital Museum. ==Former residence== Yongqi and his descendants were merged under the Bordered Red Banner of the Eight Banners. Yongqi's house later became the residence of Prince Chun in the later part of the Qing dynasty. A Prince Rong Residence is located in the southwest of present-day Beijing at Xuanwu Gate on the west side of Taiping Lake. ==Appraisal== Yongqi's mother was not one of the highly ranked consorts of the Qianlong Emperor, but yet Yongqi was instated as a Prince of the First Rank, and there were signs that the emperor had considered designating Yongqi as his heir. Another two princes, Yonglian and Yongcong, became first-rank princes because they were born to Empress Xiaoxianchun. As such it was believed that the Qianlong Emperor truly favoured and loved Yongqi. Yongqi was the most outstanding of the Qianlong Emperor's sons and the best choice to succeed his father, but it was unfortunate that he died at a young age of 25. In 1793, when the Qianlong Emperor met British envoy George Macartney he told the latter that he regarded Yongqi highly because of his many talents, and that it was a pity that he died early. ==Family== Consorts and Issue: * Primary consort, of the Sirin Gioro clan () ** Sixth son (9 November 1765 \u2013 29 November 1765) * Secondary consort, of the Socoro clan () ** First son (4 July 1759 \u2013 7 July 1759) ** Third son (12 January 1762 \u2013 19 August 1763) ** Fourth son (10 September 1764 \u2013 4 November 1764) ** Mianyi, Prince Rongke of the Second Rank (; 10 September 1764 \u2013 14 April 1815), fifth son * Mistress, of the Hu clan () ** Second son (3 March 1760) ** Lady of the Second Rank (; 16 June 1762 \u2013 9 December 1780), first daughter *** Married Wangqinbanba'er (; 1755\u20131804) of the Alxa Borjigit clan in January/February 1780 ** Second daughter (3 February 1764 \u2013 14 January 1765) ==Ancestry== ==In fiction and popular culture== * Portrayed by Alec Su in My Fair Princess (1998) * Portrayed by Leo Ku in My Fair Princess III (2003) * Portrayed by Zhang Rui in New My Fair Princess (2011) * Portrayed by Chen Youwei in Story of Yanxi Palace (2018) * Portrayed by Qu Chuxiao in Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace (2018) ==See also== * Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty * Ranks of imperial consorts in China#Qing ==References== * Category:Qianlong Emperor's sons Category:Manchu Bordered Red Bannermen Category:Manchu politicians Category:1741 births Category:1766 deaths Category:Qing dynasty politicians from Beijing Category:Qing dynasty calligraphers Category:Qing dynasty poets Category:Qing dynasty painters Category:Painters from Beijing Category:Poets from Beijing Category:18th-century Chinese writers ",
