The devised performances are debuted in the resident theatrehttp://www.stamfordartscentre.com and then toured throughout local schools and theatres. SSYT resides at the Stamford Arts Centre. The company is a member of the National Association of Youth Theatres (NAYT) and attends the Middlesbrough Youth Drama Festival annually. ==History== Mary Benzies started running the Senior Youth Theatre in 2007, in the first year produced 'Multiplex' by Christopher William Hill about staff at a multiplex cinema. This was a massive success at the box office and got rave reviews from local news. This led to an increase of interest from young people who wished to get into performing arts. Mary chose to audition members for the 2008 Group instead of just letting everybody join. This meant that only selected members who were interested and dedicated to producing innovative, creative theatre would be accepted, leading to a massive boost in the professionalism and standard or performance by the company. == Funding == SSYT is primarily funded by South Kesteven District Council and its company's members. == Company management == ===Class Teachers=== * Mary Benzies Company Director (2007\u2013Present) * Claudia Calardo Choreographer (2009\u2013Present) === Creative Team === * Adrian Hill Technical Director (2007\u2013Present) ==Notable Members== Previous notable members of SSYT: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
