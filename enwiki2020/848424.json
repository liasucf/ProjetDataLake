    "text": "David Anthony Yallop (27 January 1937 \u2013 23 August 2018) was a British author who wrote chiefly about unsolved crimes. In the 1970s he contributed scripts for a number of BBC comedy shows. In the same decade he also wrote 10 episodes for the ITV court drama, Crown Court. His controversial book, In God's Name: An Investigation Into the Murder of Pope John Paul I (1984), posited that Pope John Paul I, found dead at age 65 in his chambers barely a month after becoming pope in 1978, had been poisoned by secretive Masons who had infiltrated the Vatican and the Vatican Bank. Reviewers, and the Church, dismissed the book as groundless conspiracy theory. That said, the book made the New York Times Best Seller list for 15 weeks, was translated into multiple languages, and was repeatedly reprinted, selling over six million copies.Daniel E. Slotnik, \"David Yallop, Who Wrote of Crime and Conspiracy, Dies at 81,\" The New York Times, September 14, 2018. In October 1992 he lost his job when, as a scriptwriter for EastEnders, he proposed killing some of the characters by means of an IRA bomb. Yallop successfully sued the BBC for breach of contract.The Guardian, The cutting edge, 18 October 1993 He was also one of the co-authors of Graham Chapman's autobiography, A Liar's Autobiography (Volume VI).
