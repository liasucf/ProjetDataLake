It flourished through the Roman and Byzantine empires, being dissolved on the invasion of the Seljuks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The diocese was nominally refounded as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, although the area had never actually been catholic in profession. ==History== Christianity came to Derbe very early.
