    "text": "Jan Styka (April 8, 1858 in Lw\u00f3w \u2013 April 11, 1925 in Rome) was a Polish painter noted for producing large historical, battle-piece, and Christian religious panoramas. He was also illustrator and poet. Known also as a great patriotic speaker - his speeches were printed in 1915 under the French title L'ame de la Pologne (The Soul of Poland). ==Biography== The son of a Czech officer in Austria-Hungary, Styka attended school in his native Lw\u00f3w (Lemberg, now Lviv) then studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Austria following which he took up residence in Krak\u00f3w in 1882 where he studied historical painting under Jan Matejko. Next he came back to Lw\u00f3w and opened there a workshop. Here, together with a celebrated Polish historical painter Wojciech Kossak, they created his most famous work in Poland \u2013 The Rac\u0142awice Panorama. Later he travelled to Italy for a short time before moving to France where the great art movements at Montmartre and Montparnasse were taking shape and where he would spend a large part of his life. Saint Peter Preaching the Gospel in the Catacombs by Jan Styka Among Styka's important works is the large scene of Saint Peter preaching the Gospel in the Catacombs (seen here) painted in Paris in 1902. His renowned panoramas include Bem in Siedmiogrod (1897), The Martydrom of Christians in Nero's Circus (1897), and the Wroc\u0142aw Branch of the National Museum of Poland houses the monumental collaboration The Battle of Rac\u0142awice painted in 1894. Styka died in 1925 and was buried in Rome. However, in 1959 Hubert Eaton arranged with Styka's family for his remains to be brought to the United States for interment in the \"Hall of The Immortals\" at Forest Lawn cemetery. Sons (1889\u20131954) and Adam Styka (1890\u20131959) were both painters. ==The Crucifixion== Jan Styka House in Lw\u00f3w In 1910 Styka painted a portrait of esteemed pianist and Polish statesman, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, which is now at the National Museum of Poland in Pozna\u0144. Previously, near the end of the 19th century, Paderewski had commissioned Styka to paint what would become his most famous work internationally. Originally entitled \"Golgotha\" (the Aramaic name for the site of Christ's crucifixion), the painting became known simply as The Crucifixion. This piece is an enormous panorama standing long by in height. The Crucifixion has a fascinating history. Upon its commission in 1894, Styka travelled to Jerusalem to prepare sketches, and to Rome, where his palette was blessed by Pope Leo XIII. The painting was unveiled in Warsaw to great success on June 22, 1897. It was shown in many of the great cities of Europe, before making its way to America, to join the 1904 St. Louis Exposition. The painting was seized when Styka's American partners failed to pay the customs taxes, and was considered lost for nearly forty years. In 1944 the painting was found, rolled around a telephone pole and badly damaged, having languished in the basement of the Chicago Civic Opera Company for decades. Acquired by American businessman, Hubert Eaton, the painting was restored by Jan Styka's son, artist . It is on display in the Hall of the Crucifixion at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. In 2005\u20132006 the painting underwent a massive restoration as part of Forest Lawn's centennial celebration. It currently is shown, except on Mondays, on the hour, except 1:00 p.m., from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.. It features a new, state of the art guided light show and narrated presentation written by biblical scholar Timothy Kirk. ==Selected paintings== File:Jan Styka - Kalipso.jpg|Calypso File:Jan Styka - Madonna.jpg|Madonna, 1906 File:Jan Styka - Nero at Baiae.jpg|Nero at Baiae, c. 1900 File:Jan Styka Rabbi with tefillin.jpg|Rabbi with Tefillin, ca. 1925 File:Woman with Horse.jpg|Nymph and a Horse, c. 1920 File:Portrait of Maryla M\u0142odnicka- Wolska1894.jpg|Portrait of Maryla M\u0142odnicka-Wolska File:Wladyslaw Szujski death 1914.JPG|Death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szujski in the Battle of Sillery File:Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski.PNG|Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski, ca. 1925 File:Dream of Polish volunteers in French army 1914.JPG|Dream of Polish Volunteers in French Trenches ==References== ==External links== *Details of the \"Panorama of the Battle of Rac\u0142awice\" at the Wroclaw Municipality website *Details of \"The Crucifixion\" at the Forest Lawn website *Maria Styka family art Category:1858 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Artists from Lviv Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Polish people of Czech descent Category:19th-century Polish painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:20th-century Polish painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Academy of Fine Arts Vienna alumni Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Category:Polish male painters ",
