    "text": "Sacred Heart College is a state-integrated single-sex girls' Catholic secondary school located in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. It was established in 1912 by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions and was the first secondary school to be opened in the Hutt Valley. It was originally sited in high street on the property known as Margaret street. In 1957 the school was shifted to the existing site on Laings Road. In May 1980 it became the first Catholic secondary school to be integrated under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975. The school has six house groups: Lisieux (Pink), Avila (Red), Aubert (Green), Lourdes (Light Blue), Barbier (Dark Blue) and Siena (Yellow). Due to having earthquake prone buildings the school strengthened its largest building in early 2017 and demolished its tallest in December 2017. ==Notable alumnae== * Stephanie Dowrick (born 1947), writer and spiritual teacher * Catherine Chidgey (born 1970), novelist ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1912 Category:Girls' schools in New Zealand Category:Catholic secondary schools in the Wellington Region Category:Schools in Lower Hutt Category:1912 establishments in New Zealand ",
