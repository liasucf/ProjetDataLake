    "text": "Pleasures U Like is the third studio album by Jon B. It's his first album under Tracey Edmonds' new label Edmonds Record Group. Edmonds formed the new label after Jon's previous label home Yab Yum Records folded. On Pleasures U Like, Jon reunites with past producers Babyface and Tim Kelley and Bob Robinson, who each produce one song. Also present on the album is Joshua P. Thompson, a songwriter and producer who is best known for his work with the R&B; singer Joe. Despite the album being certified gold, Jon felt it was not marketed and promoted properly. The only song released from the album as a single was \"Don't Talk\"- which was due primarily to Jon wanting to get out of his contract with Epic Records. As a result, this would be his final album released on a major label. Ten years after the release of Pleasures U Like, a song from the album \"Calling on You\" would later be known as the sample on Drake's song \"Cameras\" from his second album Take Care.http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/123876/Drake- Cameras/Good%20Ones%20Go_Jon%20B-Calling%20on%20You/ The album bowed at number 6 on the Billboard 200 and No.3 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart selling 99,000 in its debut week, becoming the first top 10 for Jon B. ==Track listing== From Allmusic. #\"Interlude\" (Jonathan Buck) 1:11 #\"Finer Things\" (featuring Nas) (Jonathan Buck, Nasir Jones) 5:01 #\"Vibezelect (Interlude)\" (Jonathan Buck) 0:20 #\"Don't Talk\" (Jonathan Buck) 4:44 #\"Sof'n Sweet\" (Jonathan Buck, Tommy Brown) 5:03 #\"Overjoyed (featuring Faith Evans) (Jonathan Buck, Denaine Jones) 5:36 #\"Boy is Not a Man\" (Joshua P.
