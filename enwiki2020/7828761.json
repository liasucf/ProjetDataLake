Murray attended Blackrock College, a school for boys in south Dublin, where his musical gifts were further nurtured. He was chapel organist during his school days there. Subsequent organ studies with Peter Sweeney at the Dublin Conservatory of Music and Drama were complemented by masterclasses from such leading organists as James David Christie and Ben van Oosten. Positions held by R\u00f3n\u00e1n include organist of St. Stephen's church, Killiney (1989\u20131991) and assistant organist of the Unitarian church, Dublin (1993\u20131996). Since November 1996, he has been organist of St. Joseph's Church Glasthule, Dublin. He is active as a freelance organist, pianist and composer. With a repertoire covering a range from traditional music and jazz piano, to classical organ music and improvisation, Murray also writes and performs his own songs. He has made numerous radio and television broadcasts and is much in demand both as a solo artist and collaborator. Appearances include the first Cork International Pipe Organ Festival in 2005 and a performance at the Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ of St. Sulpice church, Paris. Murray has featured as musical director for many productions, especially variety concerts in venues throughout Ireland. He was a finalist in the Unisong International Song Competition 2004. He co-wrote and performed (with mezzo-soprano Maria de Moel) the musical theatre piece \"Violating Messages: The Songs of Kurt Weill\" during the 2005 Dublin Fringe Festival. He frequently works with his sister, renowned soprano Niamh Murray. In August 2006 Murray performed a recital at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, home to one of the greatest pipe organs in the world. April 2007 saw him perform in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Cathedral, Poland. His debut album of original songs, Reasons and Seasons was released in June 2006.
