    "text": "Balchik () is a Black Sea coastal town and a seaside resort in the Southern Dobruja area of northeastern Bulgaria. It is located in Dobrich Province, 35 km southeast of Dobrich and 42 km northeast of Varna. The town sprawls scenically along hilly terraces descending from the Dobruja plateau to the sea. It is often called \"The white city\" because of the white color of the hills. ==Etymology== The town is named after the medieval ruler Balik, brother of Dobrotitsa, after whom is named the city of Dobrich. == History == Balchik's centre Balchik's centre The Balchik Botanical Garden Founded as a Thracian settlement, it was later colonised by the Ionian ancient Greeks with the name Krounoi () (renamed as Dionysopolis (), after the discovery of a statue of Dionysus in the sea).An inventory of archaic and classical poleis By Mogens Herman Hansen, Thomas Heine Nielsen, Kobenhavns universitet.

Another opinion is that its actual name derived from that of a local noble - Balik. After the liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Balchik developed as centre of a rich agricultural region, wheat-exporting port, and district (okoliya) town, and later, as a major tourist destination with the beachfront resort of Albena to its south. After the Second Balkan War, in 1913, the town was renamed Balcic and became part of the Kingdom of Romania. It was regained by Bulgaria during World War I (1916\u20131919), but Romania restored its authority when hostilities in the region ceased. In 1940, just before the outbreak of World War II in the region, Balchik was ceded by Romania to Bulgaria by the terms of the Craiova Treaty. During Romania's administration, the Balchik Palace was the favourite summer residence of Queen Marie of Romania and her immediate family. The town is the site of Marie's Oriental villa, the place where her heart was kept, in accordance with her last wishes, until 1940 (when the Treaty of Craiova awarded the region back to Bulgaria). It was then moved to Bran Castle, in central Romania. Today, the Balchik Palace and the adjacent Balchik Botanical Garden are the town's most popular landmarks and a popular tourist sightseeing destination. During the inter-war period, Balchik was also a favorite destination for Romanian avant-garde painters, lending his name to an informal school of post-impressionist painters \u2013 the Balcic School of Painting Balcica Maciuca, Balcic, Editura Universalia, Bucure\u0219ti, 2001\\- which is central in the development of Romanian 20th-century painting. Many works of the artists composing the group depict the town's houses and the Turkish inhabitants, as well as the sea. == Population == The city's population is 11,051 people (data from National Statistics Institute - Bulgaria, 2018). The total population of Balchik municipality is 19,331. According to an estimate by Bulgarian historian Rayna Gavrilova the Bulgarian population before 1878 was only around 10%.Gavrilova, Raina:\"Bulgarian urban culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\" p.47. The ethnic composition has gradually changed from mostly Gagauz and Tatar/Turkish to predominantly Bulgarian. According to the latest 2011 census data, Balchik's ethnic composition is the following: Population on 01.02.2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical Institute Population by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute *Bulgarians: 7,916 (72.9%) *Turks: 1,715 (15.8%) *Gypsies: 954 (8.8%) *Others: 191 (1.8%) *Indefinable: 79 (0.7%) *Undeclared: 755 (6.5%) ==Culture== ===Art=== Held each year since 1991, \"The ProcessSpace Art Festival\" is an annual international festival of Contemporary Art, which takes place over two weeks in June. Balchik Palace also hosts In the Palace International Short Film Festival. ===Music=== Held annually each summer since 2006 in the nearby town of Kavarna, the Kavarna Rock Fest hosts top-name bands for a three-day festival. Previous acts have included Motorhead, Twisted Sister, Motley Crew, Scorpions, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, and the Michael Schenker Group. Since a few years the major has cancelled the Kavarna Rock Fest due to different music preference. ===Sports=== Balchik is becoming well known internationally as a golfing destination. There are three 18-hole championship golf courses within the local vicinity, two designed by Gary Player - Thracian Cliffs GC and BlackSeaRama GC; and one designed by Ian Woosnam - Lighthouse GC. A fourth 18-hole golf course is currently in the planning stages. == Trivia == *Francis Ford Coppola spent 11 days at the Balchik palace shooting scenes of Youth Without Youth. *Balchik Ridge, in Antarctica, is named after the town. * The currently unused Balchik Airfield is envisaged to be prepared for low-cost airlines, especially from Russia.Hotels in Bulgaria project surge in Russian tourist arrivals at Balchik airport, The Sofia Echo, 8.
