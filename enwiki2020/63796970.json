It originally had an exclusive deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment, who is producing shows and TV movies under the logos of Columbia Pictures Television and TriStar Television. In 1997, it was sold to Lions Gate Entertainment. Two years later, it was split off from Lionsgate, and it became an independent organization again. In 1999, the deal with Columbia TriStar Television is extended. In 2000, Elizabeth Stephen, who moved off from theatrical motion pictures joined the company, and it was head of the television movie division. == Television productions == === Television shows === ==== 1990s ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Start Date !End Date !Title !Network !Notes !Seasons !Episodes |- |1 August 1998 |15 February 2001 |Rude Awakening |Showtime |co-production with Lionsgate Television (seasons 2\u20133), Columbia TriStar Television Distribution and Showtime Networks |3 |55 |- |26 August 1998 |4 March 2000 |Oh Baby |Lifetime |co-production with Lionsgate Television (season 2) and Columbia TriStar Television |2 |44 |- |26 September 1998 |11 February 1999 |Cupid |ABC |co-production with Columbia TriStar Television |1 |15 |- |6 October 1998 |15 July 1999 |Mercy Point |UPN |co- production with Columbia TriStar Television |1 |7 |} ==== 2000s ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Start Date !End Date !Title !Network !Notes !Seasons !Episodes |- |4 April 2000 |12 April 2000 |Falcone |CBS |co- production with Johnson/Hancock Productions, Lionsgate Television, 3 December Productions, CBS Productions and Columbia TriStar Television |1 |9 |- |12 July 2000 |30 August 2000 |Young Americans |The WB |co-production with Lionsgate Television and Columbia TriStar Television |1 |13 |- |2001 |2002 |Go for It!
