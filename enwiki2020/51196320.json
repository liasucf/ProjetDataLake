Hader stars as Barry Berkman, a hitman from Cleveland who travels to Los Angeles to kill someone but finds himself joining an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler), where he meets aspiring actress Sally Reed (Sarah Goldberg) and begins to question his path in life as he deals with his criminal associates such as Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan). The second season premiered on March 31, 2019. In April 2019, HBO renewed the series for a third season. Barry has received critical acclaim, with most praise going to its writing, humor, characters, and performances (particularly Hader's and Winkler's), and received various accolades, including 30 Primetime Emmy Award nominations; Hader won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series twice, while Winkler won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in the first season. For the second season, Winkler, Root and Carrigan all received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor, while Goldberg received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. ==Premise== Barry follows Barry Berkman, a former Marine from Cleveland who works as a hitman. Lonely and dissatisfied with life, he travels to Los Angeles to kill a target and ends up \"finding an accepting community in a group of eager hopefuls within the L.A. theater scene\". ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Bill Hader as Barry Berkman/Barry Block, a Marine turned hitman who finds himself drawn towards human connection among a community of aspiring actors. Barry longs to put his criminal history behind him to become a full-time performer, but can't seem to stop his bloody past from creeping into the new life he tries to build for himself. * Stephen Root as Monroe Fuches, an old family friend of Barry's who groomed him for a career as a hitman after Barry left the Marines. Fuches is cowardly and self-centered, often dragging Barry back into a life of crime to serve his own personal interest, be it money, power, or revenge. * Sarah Goldberg as Sally Reed, an aspiring actress in Barry's acting class who also serves as his primary love interest. Sally is focused on becoming a famous actress. * Glenn Fleshler as Goran Pazar (season 1), the leader of the Chechen mafia who employs Barry to take out a man who has been sleeping with his wife. * Anthony Carrigan as NoHo Hank, an effusively positive and naive member of the Chechen mafia and Goran's right-hand man. He later becomes the leader of the Chechen mafia himself, but struggles with the responsibility of running an organized crime ring when he is not an inherently violent person. * Henry Winkler as Gene Cousineau, an acting coach and Barry's mentor. Cousineau serves as a father figure to Barry, helping him come to terms with some of the atrocities he has committed throughout his life. However, Cousineau is also incredibly self-obsessed, and rarely seems to help out his students unless there is something of value in it for him. ===Recurring=== * Paula Newsome as Detective Janice Moss, a police officer investigating the murder of Ryan Madison and Cousineau's love interest (season 1) * Michael Irby as Cristobal Sifuentes, the leader of the Bolivian mafia * Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Sasha Baxter, a British actress in Cousineau's acting class * D'Arcy Carden as Natalie Greer, an actress and Sally's friend. Natalie often serves as Cousineau's personal assistant during acting class. * Darrell Britt-Gibson as Jermaine Jefrint, an actor in Cousineau's acting class who is one of Barry's roommates * Andy Carey as Eric, an actor in Cousineau's class with a proclivity for slam poetry and rap, neither of which he has any talent for * Alejandro Furth as Antonio Manuel, a Puerto Rican actor in Cousineau's class * John Pirruccello as Detective John Loach, Moss's perpetually depressed partner who later finds himself investigating Barry (seasons 1\u20132) * Rightor Doyle as Nick Nicholby, a flamboyantly gay actor in Cousineau's class who is one of Barry's roommates * Mark Ivanir as Vacha / Ruslan (season 1) * Nikita Bogolyubov as Mayrbek, star pupil of the new Chechen army.
