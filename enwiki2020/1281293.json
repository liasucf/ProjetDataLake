In Germany, the brand is considered closely associated to neo-Nazism by the Verfassungschutz of the state of Brandenburg.Scene costumes for right- wing extremists, from the official Web pages of the state of Brandenburg (in German). In German media, the brand is most often discussed in the light of this association. Wearing Thor Steinar clothes is expressly forbidden in the Bundestag, in the Landtage of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony and in several football stadiums. ==History== The brand was registered as a trademark by Axel Kopelke in October 2002 and was manufactured by Mediatex GmbH. In March 2009, Mediatex sold the brand to International Brands General Trading, a Dubai-based company. == Controversy == T\u00f8nsberg store in Berlin Mitte: The fa\u00e7ade shows marks from paint bomb attacks and is protected by acrylic glass Since the inception of Thor Steinar, the company has used two logos. Much of the controversy regarding the clothing label revolves around their first logo, featuring a combination of a *tiwaz rune and a *sowilo rune: the runes were so combined that a part of the logo became very similar to the wolfsangel which is used by some organisations with neo-nazi connections. It was also used by the nazis as exemplified by the insignia of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. In addition there is some similarity to the insignia of the Schutzstaffel. The manufacturers of the Thor Steinar brand rejected this interpretation of the former logo. Their second logo is a Gyfu rune, similar in appearance to a Saltire, and has not caused controversy. This rune is known as an apolitical symbol given its historical relationship to pre-Christian mythology. On occasions Thor Steinar shops have been attacked with stones or paint bombs. ===Germany=== In Germany, public display of Nazi-associated symbols, denial of the Holocaust, and glorification of Adolf Hitler are illegal. Despite that, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which collects domestic intelligence for the government, appraises the number of active participants of the far right movement at around 40,000.Rachel Nolan.

The online retailer Amazon stopped selling the brand in 2009. Despite this, Amazon have since been criticised for employing internal security guards with far-right connections, who wore the same clothing. ===Norway=== Various designs by Thor Steinar have had Norwegian flags and Norwegian names, such as Trondheim, Nordfjord, Nordstrand or Bergen. The official stores selling the clothes are also named after the oldest Norwegian city, T\u00f8nsberg. The government filed a complaint against the use of the Norwegian flag in February 2008. The legal complaint however failed and it is unlikely that a second attempt will be made. The Norwegian Embassy, the Norwegian Office for Foreign Affairs were informed by Mediatex \u2013 the company behind the Thor Steinar brand \u2013 on the 6th of December 2007 that future collections starting and including the spring and summer 2008 collection will no longer use the national symbol of Norway. The company issued a statement in response to the issue. ===Brevik store=== Until 2008, the chain operated a store named Brevik, for the town Brevik in Telemark. In February 2012 Thor Steinar opened a new store in Chemnitz also with the name Brevik. Its similarity to the last name of Anders Behring Breivik (who committed the 22 July 2011 Norway attacks) in conjunction with his far-right politics led to public outcry and local authorities are seeking to have the store closed. The store was eventually renamed.\u201eBrevik\u201c hei\u00dft jetzt \u201eTonsberg\u201c, Taz.de, 7 March 2012. ==See also== * Nazi chic ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Clothing brands of Germany Category:Products introduced in 2002 Category:Neo-Nazism ",
