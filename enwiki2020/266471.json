She served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Galway West constituency from 1975 to 1997. ==Early and personal life== M\u00e1ire Geoghegan was born in Carna, County Galway in September 1950. She was educated at Col\u00e1iste Muire, Tourmakeady, in County Mayo and at Carysfort College in Blackrock, Dublin, from where she qualified as a teacher. She is married to John Quinn, with whom she has two children. Her novel The Green Diamond, about four young women sharing a house in Dublin in the 1960s, was published in 1996. Geoghegan-Quinn was awarded an honorary doctorate of Laws (LLD) by NUI Galway in June 2014. ==Political career== Geoghegan-Quinn at the signing ceremony for the European Research Area Her father, Johnny Geoghegan, was a Fianna F\u00e1il TD for Galway West from 1954 until his death in 1975. His daughter successfully contested the subsequent by-election. From 1977 to 1979, she worked as Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister) at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy. She served as a member of Galway City Council from 1985 to 1991. Geoghegan-Quinn supported Charles Haughey in the 1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election and was subsequently appointed to the cabinet post of Minister for the Gaeltacht. She became the first woman to hold an Irish cabinet post since Countess Markievicz had been served as Minister for Labour from 1919 to 1921 in the D\u00e1il Ministry during the First D\u00e1il, and the first since the establishment of the Irish state in 1922. In 1982, she was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education. Her tenure was short because the 23rd D\u00e1il lasted only 279 days, and a Fine Gael\u2013Labour Party coalition was elected at the November 1982 general election. When Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power after the 1987 general election, she became Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. She had expected a senior government position, but was disappointed.Kenny, Shane and Keane, Fergal, Irish Politics Now: 'This Week' Guide to the 25th D\u00e1il, Dingle, Co. Kerry: Brandon/RT\u00c9, 1987, p. 61 She resigned in 1991, in opposition to Charles Haughey's leadership of the party. The following year Albert Reynolds, whom she now backed for the leadership, became Taoiseach and Fianna F\u00e1il leader. For her loyalty to Reynolds, she was appointed Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. She became Minister for Justice in 1993, in which post she introduced substantial law reform legislation, including the decriminalisation of homosexuality; she was also briefly acting Minister for Equality and Law Reform in late 1994, following the resignation of Labour Party Minister Mervyn Taylor from Reynolds' coalition government. James Reilly When Reynolds resigned as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il in November 1994, Geoghegan-Quinn was seen as his preferred successor in the position.David Sharrock, \"New coalition likely to avert Irish poll; Finance minister looks certain to take over from Reynolds\", The Guardian, 19 November 1994. In the resulting leadership election she stood against Bertie Ahern; a win would have made her the first female Taoiseach. On the day of the vote, however, she withdrew from the contest \"in the interests of party unity\". It was reported that she had the support of only 15 members of the 66-strong parliamentary party.John Burns, \"Softly, softly, says Ahern\", The Sunday Times, 20 November 1994. At the 1997 general election she retired from politics completely, citing privacy issues, after details about her 17-year-old son's expulsion from school appeared in the newspapers. \"If his mother had been a homemaker, an architect or a businesswoman, this simply would not have happened\" she commented.Alan Murdoch, \"Media blamed as Ireland's first woman cabinet minister quits\", The Independent, 28 January 1997. Other reports suggested that she saw her prospects for promotion under Ahern as poor,Denis Coughlan, \"Maybe more than a matter of family privacy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn will be a big loss to Fianna Fail, but the denizens of Leinster House are already calling 'next business',\" Irish Times, 28 January 1997. and a weak showing in constituency opinion polls indicated her seat could be in danger.John Burns and Rory Godson, \"Desperately seeking candidates\", The Sunday Times, 19 January 1997. She became a non- executive director of Aer Lingus, a member of the board of the Declan Ganley- owned Ganley Group, and wrote a column for The Irish Times. Geoghegan-Quinn was appointed to the European Court of Auditors in 1999, replacing former Labour Party politician and Minister Barry Desmond. She was appointed for a second term at the Court of Auditors in March 2006, and resigned on 9 February 2010. She was nominated by the Taoiseach Brian Cowen to become Ireland's European Commissioner in November 2009, and was subsequently allocated the Research, Innovation and Science portfolio. In April 2010, after numerous calls were made over several days for Geoghegan-Quinn to surrender her pensions as an Irish former politician\u2014which are worth over \u20ac104,000\u2014while she remained in a paid public office, she did so. In July 2015, it was announced that she would chair an independent panel to examine issues of gender equality among Irish higher education staff. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Carysfort College Category:Female justice ministers Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Irish European Commissioners Category:Irish schoolteachers Category:Members of the 20th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 23rd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 24th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 27th D\u00e1il Category:20th-century women Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la Category:Ministers for Justice (Ireland) Category:Ministers for Transport (Ireland) Category:Ministers of State of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:Ministers of State of the 23rd D\u00e1il Category:Ministers of State of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Ministers of State of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Local councillors in Galway (city) Category:Politicians from County Galway Category:Women European Commissioners Category:Women government ministers of the Republic of Ireland Category:Women ministers of state of the Republic of Ireland Category:European Commissioners 2009\u20132014 ",
