Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=578165 on 2017-01-17 This genus was originally proposed by T. Shuto in 1983 as a subgenus of Paradrillia for Paradrillia gemmata. It showed some resemblance to Pleurotoma multiseriata Smith, 1877, synonym of Epidirona multiseriata (E. A. Smith, 1877). It differs however by the position of the anal sinus which is situated on the shoulder slope and not on the shoulder itself. ==References== * T. Shuto, 1983.
