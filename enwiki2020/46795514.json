    "text": "\"End of the Beginning\" is the sixteenth episode of the first season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they hunt for the mysterious Clairvoyant. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Paul Zbyszewski, and directed by Bobby Roth. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode brings together several major guest stars from throughout the season, including J. August Richards, Titus Welliver, Saffron Burrows, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez, and Bill Paxton, with Hern\u00e1ndez's appearance leading into the beginning of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a film that the rest of the episode mentions and partly runs concurrently with. \"End of the Beginning\" originally aired on ABC on April 1, 2014, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 5.71 million viewers. ==Plot== In a safe house, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents John Garrett and Antoine Triplett are attacked by Mike Peterson, who had become the cyborg \"Deathlok\" and is working for their nemesis, the Clairvoyant. Weeks later, Phil Coulson recruits Agents Garrett, Triplett, Victoria Hand, Felix Blake and Jasper Sitwell to join his team to hunt down the Clairvoyant and Deathlok. Garrett and Coulson believe that the Clairvoyant is a psychic, and that Deathlok's recent attack signifies that they are getting close to unraveling the true identity of the Clairvoyant. The two have narrowed their list to those were rejected by S.H.I.E.L.D. as gifted people. Garrett believes that they should compartmentalize the information to withhold this from the Clairvoyant. Coulson assigns Skye to choose which candidates to pursue and to pair the agents into teams; he promotes her into a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to help her gain access to the information. Before they could begin, Sitwell leaves the team after he is ordered by the Triskelion to report to the S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel Lemurian Star, and Hand decides to assist them via satellite from the Hub. Garrett tells Skye that the team has changed the perspective of Agent Grant Ward, who now has a cause to fight for. Agent Melinda May offers to help fellow agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons in their research of the drug that helped heal the injuries of Coulson and Skye. Triplett, who is partnered with Ward, is revealed to harbor a grudge against the Clairvoyant for killing his partner. Coulson, Garrett, May and Blake are assigned to other locations, however Blake is ambushed by Deathlok. Deathlok declares that \"Mike Peterson is dead\" before critically injuring Blake, who manages to plant a tracker on him. The team concludes that the target May and Blake were following, Thomas Nash, is their prime suspect. Through the tracker planted by Blake, the agents pursue Deathlok in an abandoned horse racing track, while Triplett and Simmons stay behind at the Hub with Hand. After a brief battle with Deathlok, Coulson and Garrett discover Nash, who is in a vegetative state, but seems to communicate through a speech-generating device. Nash, boasting that he is the Clairvoyant, claims he can see everything, and threatens to kill Skye, causing an enraged Ward to shoot him dead. Before they depart to interrogate Ward, May informs Coulson that Director Nick Fury needs Coulson at the Triskelion. Meanwhile, on the Bus, Fitz discovers May's secret phone line while attempting to create another line to contact Simmons. When Skye presents the results of her analysis of the S.H.I.E.L.D. psychological files to Coulson, the two realize that the Clairvoyant was not Nash, but a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. with similar access to the files allowing them to manipulate the agents by apparently having privileged information. While Coulson accuses a defensive Ward of shooting Nash to misdirect them on the Clairvoyant's true identity, Fitz informs Skye of the secret phone line. Coulson is informed of May's secret line and, alongside Skye, confronts her. As May tries to explain that she could not disclose who is on the other end of the line, the plane is remotely hijacked. At the Hub, Hand is revealed to be the one that commissioned the hijack and orders her subordinates to kill the agents except for Coulson, saying, \"He's mine\". ==Production== ===Development=== In March 2014, Marvel revealed that the sixteenth episode would be titled \"End of the Beginning\", and would be written by Paul Zbyszewski, with Bobby Roth directing. ===Casting=== In March 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively.
