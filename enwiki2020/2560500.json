    "text": "The ground hornbills (Bucorvidae) are a family of the order Bucerotiformes, with a single genus Bucorvus and two extant species. The family is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa: the Abyssinian ground hornbill occurs in a belt from Senegal east to Ethiopia, and the southern ground hornbill occurs in southern and East Africa. Ground hornbills are large, with adults around a metre tall. Both species are ground-dwelling, unlike other hornbills, and feed on insects, snakes, other birds, amphibians and even tortoises.Kinnaird Margaret F. and O\u2018Brien< Timothy G.; The Ecology and Conservation of Asian Hornbills: Farmers of the Forest; pp. 20-23. They are among the longest-lived of all birds,Wasser, D. E. and Sherman, P.W.; \u201cAvian longevities and their interpretation under evolutionary theories of senescence\u201d in Journal of Zoology 2 November 2009 and the larger southern species is possibly the slowest-breeding (triennially) and longest-lived of all birds.Skutch; Alexander Frank (author) and Gardner, Dana (illustrator) Helpers at birds' nests : a worldwide survey of cooperative breeding and related behavior pp. 69-71. Published 1987 by University of Iowa Press. ==Taxonomy== The genus Bucorvus was introduced, originally as a subgenus, by the French naturalist Ren\u00e9 Lesson in 1830 with the Abyssinian ground hornbill Bucorvus abyssinicus as the type species. The generic name is derived from the name of the genus Buceros introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the Asian hornbills where corvus is the Latin word for a \"raven\". A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that the genus Bucorvus was sister to the rest of the hornbills. The genus Bucorvus contains two species: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Image !! Scientific name !! Common Name !! Distribution |- |120px || Bucorvus abyssinicus || Abyssinian ground hornbill (also known as northern ground hornbill) || southern Mauritania, Senegal and Guinea east to Eritrea, Ethiopia, north western Somalia, north western Kenya and Uganda |- |120px || Bucorvus leadbeateri || Southern ground hornbill || northern Namibia and Angola to northern South Africa and southern Zimbabwe to Burundi and Kenya |- |} A prehistoric ground hornbill, Bucorvus brailloni, has been described from fossil bones in Morocco, suggesting that prior to Quaternary glaciations the genus was either much more widespread or differently distributed.Kemp, A. C. 1995 The Hornbills. Oxford University Press, Oxford. It is currently thought that the ground hornbills, along with Tockus and Tropicranus, are almost exclusively carnivorous and lack the gular pouch that allows other, less closely related hornbill genera to store fruit. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Higher-level bird taxa restricted to the Afrotropics ",
