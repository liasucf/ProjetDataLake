    "text": "Bernard Patrick Ashley-Seal (born 21 November 1998) is an English footballer who plays as a striker for club Northampton Town. ==Career== ===Early career=== Ashley-Seal was on the books at Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur before joining Norwich's academy in 2015. In October 2015, he was named by The Guardian as one of the top twenty prospects of his age group to look out for. Despite this, he did not sign a professional contract with the club and, despite reported interest from Leicester City, instead had trials with Chelsea and Stoke. In October 2017 he signed with Wolverhampton Wanderers on a two-an- a-half-year deal. He made his professional debut for the club on 28 August 2018 in a 2\u20130 League Cup victory at Sheffield Wednesday, coming on as a substitute in the 80th minute for L\u00e9o Bonatini. He made a further appearance as a substitute in the following round of the competition against Leicester, in which he was the only Wolves player to successfully convert his penalty in a shootout. On 23 January 2019, having signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Wolves, the striker joined LigaPro side Famalic\u00e3o on loan until the end of the 2018\u201319 season. Ashley-Seal made his first start for Wolves on 4 January 2020 in a third round FA Cup tie against Manchester United at Molineux, although he was withdrawn at half-time in favour of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez., this was to be final appearance for the club. At the end of the month, he moved in a six-month loan deal to League One club Accrington Stanley. ===Northampton Town=== On 7 September 2020, Ashley-Seal joined League One side Northampton Town on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goals for Northampton when he scored twice in an EFL Trophy tie against Southampton U21s on 6 October 2020. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Footballers from Southwark Category:Association football forwards Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Black English sportspeople Category:Accrington Stanley F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Portugal Category:F.C.
