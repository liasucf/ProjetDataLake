    "text": "In Islam, a nafl prayer (, \u1e63al\u0101t al-nafl) or supererogatory prayer is a type of optional Muslim salah (formal worship). As with sunnah prayer, they are not considered obligatory but are thought to confer extra benefit on the person performing them. An example is the offering of 4 \"nafl\" (optional but beneficial) rakats before the compulsory dhuhr prayers. According to the following hadith, nafl not only draws one closer to Allah but also helps one attain the better success in the afterworld i.e. Jannah (Paradise):eo : \"Rabi'ah ibn Malik al-Aslami reported that the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: \"Ask [anything].\" Rabi'ah said: \"I ask of you to be your companion in paradise.\" The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: \"Or anything else?\" Rabi'ah said: \"That is it.\" The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said to him: \"Then help me by making many prostrations [i.e. supererogatory prayers]\".- Sahih Muslim ==Tahiyatul Wudu== Tahiyatul wudu is the nafl prayer after doing wudhu. Abu Hureyrah narrates that once Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) asked Bilal at Fajr salah: Bilal replied: Abu Hureyrah narrated that Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said to Bilal Bilal said : After completion of the wudhu of two rakats is full of blessings (saw\u0101b). It should not be performed during the improper (makruh) times. (When the sun rises, when it is at zenith and when it sets.) ==Ishraq prayer== The time for the Ishraq prayer begins fifteen to twenty minutes after sunrise and consists of two Raka'ahs. Praying ishraq is considered to yield greater rewards than performing the lesser Umrah according to some traditions.Targhib p. 427. vol. I ref. Abu Yate ba Isnad-e- Sahib\u201cAccording to majority of scholars of Hadith and Fiqh, Duha Prayer and Al-Ishraq Prayer are all names of the same salah (ritual Prayer). It is a recommended Prayer without any fixed number of raka'ahs, and its time proper starts a little after sun rise (approximately fifteen minutes after sunrise) and extends up to the time of the declining of the sun from the meridian. ==Duha prayer== Duha prayer begins after sunrise and ends at meridian, and is generally thought to include at least two raka'ahs, though in some traditions the number is four or even twelve.Al-Sunan al-Sughra #1,659Sahih Muslim #1,175Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal #23,317Sunan Ibn Majah #1,371Mishkaat pg.116 According to the Sunni thought, performing this prayer is believed to be effective in seeking forgiveness for one's sins.Sunan al-Tirmidhi #438 ==Chasht or Duha Prayer== Chasht or Duha prayer begins when the sun rises a quarter in the morning, and it ends before the time of Dhuhr prayer (i.e. obligatory prayer). It has been said that the one who performs chasht nafls, has a reward of 1 castle of Gold in Jannah. i.e. 1 Chasht prayer = 1 gold castle. Fatima used to be regular in this supererogatory prayer. The supererogatory morning prayer has been narrated from Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), through paths that have reached mass-narration levels - from 19 to over 30 Companions - according to Imam al-Tabari, al-`Ayni in `Umdat al-Qari, al- Haytami, al-Munawi, and al-Qari in Sharh al-Shama'il, Ibn Hajar in Fath al- Bari, al-Kattani in Nazm al-Mutanathir, and as per the monographs compiled by al-Hakim and al-Suyuti as well as the recensions of Abu Zur`a al-`Iraqi in Tarh al-Tathrib, Ibn al-Qayyim in Zad al-Ma`ad, and al-Shawkani in Nayl al- Awtar. According to the vast majority of the Ulema of the Salaf and Khalaf it is a desirable and recommended prayer. Four Rak'aah Sunnah of Zuhr Muhammad (Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) is reported to have said that Whoever performs the four rakaats before and after the Zuhr salah with constancy, Allah Ta'ala makes the fire of Hell haram (forbidden) for him. [Mishkat,(Hasan-Chain) p. 104; Tirmizi, Abu Da'ud, Nisai 1814, Ibn Majah] Muhammad (Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) is reported to have said that after the worshipper prays the four rakaats of Zuhr salah, the doors of heaven are opened, i.e. the salah becomes accepted by Allah, and the cause of its acceptance comes down on the worshipper as rays of mercy. [Mishkat, p. 104] 4 Rak'aah Sunnah of Asr Muhammad (Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) said: \"May Allah have Mercy on the one who offers four (rak'ahs) before 'Asr prayer.\" (Abu Dawud) Tahiyyatul Masjid (Nafl prayer when entering Masjid) Abu Qatada narrated that Muhammad(Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) said: \u201cIf any one of you enters a mosque, he should pray two raka\u2019ats before sitting.\u201dNarrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim(Sahih) *This is a 2 Rak'aah Nafl prayer which one should perform as one enters the Masjid and on proper times. ===Names=== The supererogatory morning prayer has many names. Among them: *Salat al-Duha or Sibhat al-Duha - Sibha meaning a supererogatory prayer in general and Duha meaning morning, mid- morning, or late morning. This is the name that reoccurs the most in the narrations. It is the late morning prayer when the sun is very hot.Kanz al- Ummal #23437, 23461 The reason for this name is that one leaves dunya at that time to return to Allah Most High and makes up for the Night prayer that he missed. Hence Salat al-Duha is even more stressed for those who miss tahajjud and is its replacement.Ibn al-Qayyim, Zad al-Ma`ad (1:356)Itr, I`lam al-Anam Sharh Bulugh al-Maram, p. 628 *Salat al-Awwabin - is the \"prayer of the Oft- Returning\" as specified by Prophet Muhammad (Salalahu Elhay Waalehee Wasalim) and is offered between Maghrib prayer and Isha prayer. Howerer, many scholars say the there are no sahih hadiths confirming that Salat al-Awwabin is to be prayed between Maghrib and Isha prayers and are they are of opinion that in fact it is the same prayer as Duha prayer. *Salat al-Ishraq - is the \"sunrise prayer\" or the prayer performed very shortly after sunrise. *Salat al-Fath - is the \"victory prayer\" as it was established that Prophet Muhammad (Salalahu Elhay Waalehee Wasalim) prayed it the morning he entered Makkah (in al-Bukhari and Muslim) and this has become the Sunna of military leaders upon entering a newly conquered region. ==See also== * Sunnah salah * Ghufayla Prayer * Jumu'ah Salah ==Reference== Category:Salat Category:Salah terminology ",
