    "text": "Ill\u00e9s (Hungarian name: Ill\u00e9s egy\u00fcttes = Ill\u00e9s Ensemble) was a Hungarian rock/beat band (1960\u20131973), and was one of the biggest groups of the 1960s and early 1970s rock boom in Hungary. The band is often compared to the Beatles as regards the time period of its activity, its artistic and cultural influence and continuing popularity. ==Name== The band's name was originally taken from the family name of Lajos Ill\u00e9s, one of the members. Later however, the band chose as its logo a chariot in the form of musical notes, drawn by two horses, riding over the name \"Ill\u00e9s\" and the sun. This logo deliberately references the chariot of the prophet Elijah (Ill\u00e9s in Hungarian) in the Old Testament, in which he was said to have been taken to Heaven. ==Members== :Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi (b. 26 April 1945 Budapest) - lead guitars, lead vocals :J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy (b. 5 April 1946 Budapest) - rhythm guitars, recorder, flute, vocals :Szabolcs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi (b. 16 September 1943 Budapest) - bass, vocals :Lajos Ill\u00e9s (b. 18 March 1942 Budapest - 29 January 2007) - vocals, strings, keys :Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1sztory (b. 3 October 1944 - 1 May 2005) (Later \u00d6rs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi) - drums ==History== Ill\u00e9s was founded in 1960, but did not gain wider popularity outside of students clubs until 1963. This was the time the Hungarian language programs of Radio Luxemburg, broadcast illegally to Hungary, started to influence Hungarian youth culture. They were the first wildly popular band of the \"new\" beat music. Their song M\u00e9g f\u00e1j minden cs\u00f3k (Every kiss still hurts) caused quite a scandal in 1966 because of Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi's \"squeaking\" singing style. Despite them being highly controversial, they were supported by the Communist regime - that was trying at the time to introduce a policy of \"small liberties\" for the people - and received numerous awards. Nevertheless, they did not publish an album until 1967, with the film soundtrack for Ezek a fiatalok (\"These young people!\" or \"These are the young people\"). The movie was an attempt to make the general audience better acquainted with the (comparatively tame) youth culture of the time. Some of the most popular bands and singers of the time appear in the film, including Ill\u00e9s and Omega while the main female role is played by another famous Hungarian pop singer, Zsuzsa Koncz. By the late 1960s, a great number of beat bands had emerged in Hungary. Fans of Ill\u00e9s and Omega soon started rivalries, parallelling the Beatles- Rolling Stones rivalry in the West. ==After Ill\u00e9s== The band broke up in 1973, possibly also due to political pressure. The Ill\u00e9s had been in fact barred for one year (plus a fine) from the Capital because of an interview they did release while staying in Britain and where they did criticize government. Nevertheless, the members, especially L. Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi and Br\u00f3dy, continued to work together on other projects, notably with their new band Fonogr\u00e1f along with Sz. Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, which tried to blend country elements with Hungarian folk music with hits like L\u00f6kd ide a s\u00f6rt! (Pass the beer!) and Mondd, hogy nem haragszol r\u00e1m! (Say that you are not angry). They also continued their cooperation with singer Zsuzsa Koncz, for whom they had written songs since the first half of the 1960s. The band later re-united for high-profile concerts on different occasions, the most memorable probably being their 1990 performance in the N\u00e9pstadion after the regime change in Hungary. In 2001 they also performed a common concert with the other two dominant Hungarian bands of their era, Omega and Metr\u00f3. In 1983, Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi and Br\u00f3dy wrote the rock opera Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly, based on the life of Saint Stephen I, the first king of Hungary. It became an instant smash hit and retains a cult following to this day. After the fall of Communism in 1990, Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi and Br\u00f3dy grew apart politically. Br\u00f3dy, a secular Jew, sympathized with the liberal Free Democrats, while Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi became increasingly nationalist and a religious Christian. This was reflected in his later rock operas like Atilla, Isten kardja (Atilla, the Sword of God - 1994) and Veled, Uram! (With You, My Lord! - 2000). The latter is a sequel to Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly. Drummer Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1sztory left Hungary in the 1970s and went to West Germany, where he sank into obscurity. He died in 2005 at the age of 60. For the already booked two concerts of the band in 2005 (one on the first day of the annual Sziget fesztiv\u00e1l in Budapest and the other in Miercurea Ciuc) his place at the drums was taken over by \u00d6rs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, the son of the band's lead guitarist Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi. After the original Ill\u00e9s formation broke up, founder and keyboardist Lajos Ill\u00e9s kept operating a band with the same name until the early 1980s. He later retired to the small village of Kisoroszi, where he acted as the chorister of the local Reformed church (his wife being the pastor there), and continued composing music including chorals, musicals and film soundtracks. He died in 2007 at the age of 64. ==Albums== Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1sztory, J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy - Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, Lajos Ill\u00e9s, Szabolcs Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi.
