According to the Rabatak inscription, he was the great grandfather of the great Kushan king Kanishka I. He is considered the founder of the Kushan Empire. ==History== The origins of Kujula Kadphises are quite obscure, and he is usually believed to be a descendant of the Kushan ruler Heraios, or possibly identical with him.Cribb, J. (1993), The Heraus coins: their attribution to the Kushan king Kujula Kadphises, c. AD 30-80. Essays in Honour of Robert Carson and Kenneth Jenkins, (edited by M. Price, A. Burnett, and R. Bland), London, 107-134. However, Kujula shares his name (Kushan: \u039a\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 on some of his \"Hermaeus\" coins, or \u039a\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1 on his \"Augustus\" coins) with some of the last Indo-Scythian rulers, such as Liaka Kusulaka (Greek: \u039b\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 \u039a\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf), or his son Patika Kusulaka, which might suggest some family connection.Rapson, \"Indian coins of the British Museum\", p.cvi ===Chinese accounts=== Coin of Kujula Kadphises.

There are few contemporaneous accounts of Kujula Kadphises; since none of these texts are by Kushan authors, their accuracy and the motives of the authors may be questionable. For example, the rise of Kujula Kadphises is portrayed, in a later Chinese historical chronicle, Hou Hanshu, as the result of a bloody civil war. > [T]he prince [xihou] of Guishuang, named Qiujiuque [Kujula Kadphises], > attacked and exterminated the four other princes [of the Yuezhi]. He > established himself as king, and his dynasty was called that of the > Guishuang [Kushan] King. He invaded Anxi [Indo-Parthia], and took the Gaofu > [Kabul] region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda [Paktiya] > and Jibin [Kapisha and Gandhara]. Qiujiuque was more than 80 years old when > he died.Hill (2009), p. 29. In the process of their expansion eastward, Kujula Kadphises and his son Vima Takto (or Vema Tahktu) seem to have displaced the Indo-Parthian kingdom, established in northwestern India by the Parthian Gondophares since around 20 CE: > His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahktu or, possibly, his brother > Sada\u1e63ka\u1e47a], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western > India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then > became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang > [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi > [Great Yuezhi]. The invasion of the Indo-Parthian kingdom led by Kujula Kadphises is thought to have occurred some time after 45 CE, during the reign of Gondophares's successors: Abdagases and Sases. ===Genealogy according to the Rabatak inscription=== Kujula Kadphises coin. Obv Helmeted soldier head right. Rev Warrior standing right, holding shield and spear. The connection of Kujula with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription, discovered in Rbatak, Afghanistan some years ago, which was written by Kanishka. Kanishka makes the list of the kings who ruled up to his time: Kujula Kadphises as his great-grandfather, Vima Taktu as his grandfather, Vima Kadphises as his father, and himself Kanishka: > And he [Kanishka] gave orders to make images of the same, (namely) of these > gods who are written herein, and he gave orders to make (them) for these > kings: for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima > Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and for > himself, King Kanishka.Sims-Williams' \"provisional translation\" quoted in > Hill (2009), p. 592. ==Coinage== Left Silver denarius of Tiberius (14-37 CE) found in India. Center Indian copy of the same, 1st century CE. Right Coin of Kushan king Kujula Kadphises copying a coin of Augustus. Most of Kujula's coins were Hellenic or Roman in inspiration. Some coins used the portrait, name and title of the Indo-Greek king Hermaeus on the obverse, indicating Kujula's wish to relate himself to the Indo-Greek king. Since the Kushans and their predecessors the Yuezhi were conversant with the Greek language and Greek coinage, the adoption of Hermaeus cannot have been accidental: it either expressed a filiation of Kujula Kadphises to Hermaeus by alliance (possibly through Sapadbizes or Heraios), or simply a wish to show himself as heir to the Indo-Greek tradition and prestige, possibly to accommodate Greek populations. These coins bear the name of Kujula Kadphises in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, with representations of the Greek demi- god Heracles on the back, and titles (\"Yavugasa\") presenting Kujula as a \"ruler\" (not actual king), and a probable Buddhist (\"Dharmathidasa\", follower of the Dharma). Later coins, possibly posthumous, did describe Kujula as \"Maharajasa\", or \"Great King\". ===Greek script=== The Greek script on the coins of Kujula (and all the Kushans with him) is barbarized. For example, \u03a3\u03a4\u0397\u03a1\u039f\u03a3\u03a3\u03a5 on his Hermaeus coins is thought to be a deformation of \u03a3\u03a9\u03a4\u0397\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 (Sotiros), the traditional title of Hermaeus on his coins. The Greek word for \"king\" is written \u0392\u0391\u03f9\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3, with both a lunate sigma (\u03f9) and a normal sigma (\u03a3) in the same word. The Kushans also added one character to the Greek script: it is the letter \u03f7, corresponding to the sound \"Sh\", as in \"Kushan\". ===\"Buddha\" coins=== Coin of Kujula Kadphises. Obv Kujula seated cross legged facing, Kharoshti legend: Kuyula Kadaphasa Kushanasa. Rev Zeus on the reverse, Greek legend: \u039a\u039f\u0396\u039f\u039b\u0391 XOPANOY ZAOOY. Kujula Kadphises Tetradrachm. Obv Brahma bull standing right, with Buddhist Triratana above. Blundered Greek legend. Rev Camel standing right. Kharoshthi legend Maharayasa Rayatirayasa Kuyula Kara Kapasa. Some coins of Kujula also represent a cross- legged seated figure, formerly said to be one of the first known representations of the Buddha on a coin (Whitehead). Unfortunately, Whitehead's attribution of this coin to Kujula, and the claim that the seated figure on the obverse represents the Buddha, is now known to be incorrect. The correct attribution of this coin is to the Kushan king Huvishka, who was Kujula's great-great-grandson. The obverse shows Huvishka seated on a couch. The first known coins carrying a representation of the Buddha were issued by Kujula's Great-grandson (and Huvishka's father) Kanishka I. ===Roman-style coins=== Coin of Kujula Kadphises, in the style of the Roman emperor Augustus. Legend in Kushan language, corrupted Greek script: \u039a\u039f\u0396\u039f\u039b\u0391 \u039a\u0391\u0394\u0391\u03a6\u0395\u03a3 \u03a7\u039f\u03f7\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a5 \u0396\u0391\u039f\u039f\u03a5 (\"Kozola Kadaphes Koshanou Zaoou\"): \"Kudjula Kadphises, ruler of the Kushans\". British Museum. Some fewer coins of Kujula Kadphises also adopted a Roman style, with effigies closely resembling Caesar Augustus, although all the legends were then associated with Kujula himself. Such influences are linked to exchanges with the Roman Empire around that date. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * \"Catalogue of coins in the Panjab Museum, Lahore.
