    "text": "Te Ruki Kawiti far right, with his nephew H\u014dne Heke and Heke's wife HariataTe Ruki Kawiti (1770s \u2013 5 May 1854) was a prominent M\u0101ori rangatira (chief). He and H\u014dne Heke successfully fought the British in the Flagstaff War in 1845\u201346.Belich, James. The New Zealand Wars. (Penguin Books, 1986) He traced descent from R\u0101hiri and Nukutawhiti of the Ng\u0101tokimatawhaorua canoe, the ancestors of the Ng\u0101puhi. He was born in the north of New Zealand into the Ng\u0101ti Hine hapu, one of the subtribes of the Ng\u0101puhi. From his youth he was trained in leadership and warfare by Hongi Hika. He was present at the Battle of Moremonui in 1807 or 1808 when many Ng\u0101puhi were slaughtered by Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua. Almost twenty years later, in 1825, he was at the Battle of Te Ika-a- ranga-nui when it was Ng\u0101puhi's turn to slaughter Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua in an act of utu or revenge. He took a number of Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua captive and refused to hand them over to Hongi Hika, preferring instead to return them to their own people to whom he was related. ==Treaty of Waitangi== Kawiti initially refused to sign the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, believing that it would inevitably lead to further European encroachment and the loss of M\u0101ori land. However he eventually yielded to pressure from his own people and signed the Treaty in May 1840, right at the top, above those chiefs who had signed earlier. However he soon grew disenchanted with British law and supported H\u014dne Heke in his protests against British rule. H\u014dne Heke sought support from Kawiti and other leaders of the Ng\u0101puhi iwi by the conveying of \u2018te ng\u0101kau\u2019, the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance. ==Battle of Koror\u0101reka== H\u014dne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti worked out the plan to draw the Colonial forces into battle, with the opening provocations focusing on the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end Koror\u0101reka. When in March 1845 Heke cut down the flag pole at Koror\u0101reka for the fourth time, thereby initiating the Flagstaff War, Kawiti, now in his seventies, created a diversion by attacking the town. The M\u0101ori warriors followed their chief and would fight in separate groups; however Kawiti and Heke co-ordinated their tactics at each battle. The conduct of the Flagstaff War appears to follow a strategy of drawing the Colonial forces into attacking a fortified p\u0101, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire. Kawiti was the senior rangatira and appears to have had a key role in the strategic decisions as to the design of the strengthened defences of Pene Taui's p\u0101 at Ohaeawai and the design and construction of the new p\u0101 that was built at Ruapekapeka to engage the British forces. == Battle of the sticks == After the Battle of Koror\u0101reka, Heke and Kawiti and the warriors travelled inland to Lake Omapere near to Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Tamati Waka Nene built a p\u0101 close to Lake Omapere. Heke's p\u0101 named Puketutu, was away, while it is sometimes named as \"Te Mawhe\" however the hill of that name is some distance to the north-east. In April 1845, during the time that the colonial forces were gathering in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu that was between the two p\u0101s and on open country between Okaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke's force numbered about three hundred men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another hundred and fifty warriors. Among Kawiti's supporters was his nephew Reweti Maika. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about four hundred warriors that supported Tamati Waka Nene including the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his son Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi, and N\u014dpera Panakareao. ==Attack on Heke's P\u0101 at Puketutu== The first major engagement of the Flagstaff War was the attack on Heke's P\u0101 at Puketutu in May 1845 by the colonial forces led by Lt Col William Hulme. While Heke occupied the p\u0101 itself, Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the p\u0101. They successfully prevented the Colonial forces from launching a coordinated attack on the p\u0101 but at quite a heavy cost in casualties. The Colonial forces were unable to overcome the defences of the p\u0101 and retreated back to the Bay of Islands. ==Battle of Te Ahuahu== The next major engagement was the Battle of Te Ahuahu. The contemporary European accounts of the battle describe it as being fought on 12 June 1845 nearby Te Ahuahu and that it involve only the warriors of H\u014dne Heke fighting the warriors of T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene. However, there are no detailed accounts of the action; Hugh Carleton (1874) mentions Thomas Walker was a name adopted by T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene. In this battle Nene's warriors carried the day. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. On this account of the early engagements of the Flagstaff War, Kawiti appears to have made the better strategic decisions as to which battles to fight and which not to fight. ==Battle of Ohaeawai== A debate occurred between Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to the request to fortify Pene Taui's P\u0101 at Ohaeawai. The Colonial forces arrived before the Ohaeawai P\u0101 on 23 June and established a camp about away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu) they built a four gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day the guns were brought to within of the p\u0101. The bombardment continued for another two days but still did very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade but the main fault was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences. After two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Lieutenant Colonel Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the p\u0101 resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene's colours \u2013 the Union Flag. The Union Flag was carried into the p\u0101. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the M\u0101ori flag, which was a K\u0101kahu (M\u0101ori cloak). This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult to the Union Jack, Despard ordered an assault upon the p\u0101 the same day. The attack was directed to the section of the p\u0101 where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the p\u0101 could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour. The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured. ==Battle of Ruapekapeka== Towards the end of 1845 the British launched a major expedition against Kawiti's new p\u0101 at Ruapekapeka. It took two weeks to bring the heavy guns into range of the p\u0101, they started the cannon bombardment on 27 December 1845. The siege continued for some two weeks with enough patrols and probes from the p\u0101 to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846, William Walker Turau, the brother of Eruera Maihi Patuone, discovered that the p\u0101 appeared to have been abandoned;; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. Fighting took place behind the p\u0101 and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle. The reason why the defenders appeared to have abandoned but then re-entered the p\u0101 is the subject of continuing debate. It was later suggested that most of the M\u0101ori had been at church, many of them were devout Christians. Knowing that their opponents, the British, were also Christians they had not expected an attack on a Sunday. It was M\u0101ori custom that the place of a battle where blood was spilt became tapu so that the Ng\u0101puhi left Ruapekapeka P\u0101. After the battle Kawiti and his warriors, carrying their dead, travelled some four miles north-west to Waiomio, the ancestral home of the Ng\u0101ti Hine. After the battle of Ruapekapeka Kawiti expressed the will to continue to fight, however Kawiti and Heke made it known that they would end the rebellion if the Colonial forces would leave the Ng\u0101puhi land.T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene acted as the intermediary in the negotiations, with Nene persuading the Governor to accept the terms of Kawiti and Heke \u2013 that they were to be unconditionally pardoned for their rebellion. ==Aftermath of the Flagstaff War== After the conclusion of the Flagstaff War Kawiti went to live near by Henry Williams at Pakaraka. Kawiti was baptised by Henry Williams in 1853.O.C. Davis (1885) The Renowned Chief Kawiti, and other New Zealand Warriors He succumbed to measles on 5 May 1854 at Otaikumikumi, close to Waiomio which is north of Kawakawa. The meeting house and marae complex at Waiomio Caves are his memorial. ==Legacy of Kawiti and the fifth flagpole at Koror\u0101reka== At the conclusion of the Flagstaff War, the Hokianga and the Bay of Islands region was nominally under British influence; the fact that the government's flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant. Such significance was not lost on Henry Williams, who, writing to E. G. Marsh on 28 May 1846, stated that \"the flag-staff in the Bay is still prostrate, and the natives here rule. These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name.\"James Belich, The New Zealand Wars, p. 70 Some argue that the Flagstaff War can be considered an inconclusive stalemate, as both sides wished the war to end, both gained somewhat from the fighting, and the situation more or less remained the same as it was before the outbreak of hostilities.Ian McGibbon, (2001) The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History, p. 373 The opinion of Henry Williams, who had counseled Kawiti to abandon the rebellion, was that the Ng\u0101puhi and the colonial government both agreed that each should let the other alone, so that Kawiti achieved peace on his terms. Henry Williams wrote to his son-in-law Hugh Carleton on 13 March 1854 in response to an earlier comment by Carleton as to the consequences of Kawiti having made peace with Governor Grey: Upon the death of Kawiti, his son Maihi Paraone Kawiti, who had been a missionary teacher at Mangakahia, succeeded Kawiti as leader of the Ng\u0101ti Hine hapu.Rogers, Lawrence M., (1973) Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams, Pegasus Press, pp. 296\u201397 Maihi Paraone Kawiti was a supporter of te ture (the law) and te whakapono (the gospel). Deputations came to Maihi Paraone Kawiti from the Taranaki and Waikato iwi asking the Ng\u0101puhi to join the M\u0101ori King Movement; the reply from Maihi Paraone Kawiti was that the Ng\u0101puhi had no desire for a \u2018M\u0101ori Kingi\u2019 as \u2018Kuini Wikitoria\u2019 was their \u2018Kingi'. Maihi Paraone Kawiti, as a signal to Governor Thomas Gore Browne that he did not follow his father's path, arranged for the fifth flagpole to be erected at Koror\u0101reka; this occurred in January 1858 with the flag being named Whakakotahitanga, \"being at one with the Queen.\" As a further symbolic act, the 400 Ng\u0101puhi warriors involved in preparing and erecting the flagpole were selected from the \u2018rebel\u2019 forces of Kawiti and Heke \u2013 that is, Ng\u0101puhi from the hapu of T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene (who had fought as allies of the British forces during the Flagstaff War), observed, but did not participate in the erection of the fifth flagpole. The restoration of the flagpole was presented by Maihi Paraone Kawiti as a voluntary act on the part of the Ng\u0101puhi that had cut it down in 1845, and they would not allow any other to render any assistance in this work. The legacy of Kawiti's rebellion during the Flagstaff War was that during the time of Governor Grey and Governor Thomas Gore Browne, the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of opinions of the Ng\u0101puhi before taking actions in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. The continuing symbolism of the fifth flagpole at Koror\u0101reka is that it exists because of the goodwill of the Ng\u0101puhi. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:1770s births Category:1854 deaths Category:Military leaders of the New Zealand Wars Category:Signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi Category:Treaty of Waitangi Category:Musket Wars Category:Ng\u0101ti Hine Category:Flagstaff War ",
