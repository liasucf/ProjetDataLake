    "text": "The Top\u010dider Case or the Guardsmen Murder Case () was an affair regarding the death of two soldiers of the Guards Unit of the Army of Serbia and Montenegro in 2004. The guardsmen, Dra\u017een Milovanovi\u0107 and Dragan Jakovljevi\u0107, were killed at their guarding posts in the Kara\u0161 military facility in Top\u010dider, Belgrade, on 5 October 2004. No person was ever persecuted for this double-murder, and the case remains unsolved. ==Investigation== First commission, set up by the military, found that the two soldiers died in a murder-suicide incident, without the involvement of any other persons. The expertise ordered by the Investigating magistrate of the Court Martial in Belgrade, Vuk Tufegd\u017ei\u0107 ascertained that Jakovljevi\u0107 killed Milovanovi\u0107, and then committed suicide. On the occasion, 20 bullets were shot. Because of the apparent faults of the Tufegd\u017ei\u0107 commission, the President of Serbia and Montenegro Svetozar Marovi\u0107, formed new State Investigative Commission led by the attorney-in-law Bo\u017eo Prelevi\u0107. In this investigation, it was ascertained in an indisputably professional manner, by expertise, that both soldiers had been killed by a third person.Blic Online - New investigation over death of two soldiers Such findings of the National Committee were confirmed by ballistic experts of FBI Quantico Laboratory from Washington, D.C. as well as the forensic expert Ljubomir Dragovi\u0107, also from the USA.U.S. expert: Top\u010dider soldiers were murdered The murder remains unsolved and the investigation is still ongoing. No person was ever persecuted for the deaths of two soldiers. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Serbia ruled that the right to a fair trial and the right to life of families of the killed guardsmen have been violated.CEAS Regarding the decision of the Constitutional Court of Serbia in the Top\u010dider case In 2016, the Government of Serbia made official decision to form third Commission for the investigation of the Case. , members of this Commission have not been named yet. In 2016, then Prime Minister of Serbia, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 spoke about \"very important information collected by the police\", but refused to reveal any details. The scenario most commonly debated by the media is that the soldiers were killed after they saw General Ratko Mladi\u0107 (fugitive from the ICTY) hiding in the military facility. This version was also suggested by the prosecution at the Mladi\u0107 Trial and the families of the two guardsmen. ==References== ==External links== * TV Show - Death in Top\u010dider * Olgica Bati\u0107 legal reperesentativ to soldiers\u2032 families *Guards\u2032 lawyers shall reveal the name of mystery military officer - Nezavisne novine Category:2004 in Serbia Category:2000s in Belgrade Category:Murder in Serbia Category:October 2004 events in Europe Category:2004 crimes in Serbia Category:2004 murders in Europe Category:2000s murders in Serbia ",
