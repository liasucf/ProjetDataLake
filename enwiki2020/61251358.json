    "text": "The Practice of Love is the seventh studio album by Norwegian musician Jenny Hval, released 13 September 2019 on Sacred Bones Records. The album was produced by Hval, with co-production by Lasse Marhaug and features guest vocals from Vivian Wang, formerly of the psych rock band The Observatory, Australian singer-songwriter Laura Jean, and French experimental musician F\u00e9licia Atkinson. The album's title was partially inspired by Valie Export's 1985 film of the same name. ==Recording== The Practice of Love was written, performed, arranged and recorded in Oslo. Vivian Wang recorded in her bedroom, on her bed, in Singapore following brain surgery. Laura Jean Englert recorded in Sydney. F\u00e9licia Atkinson recorded at home between summer and fall 2018 with \"little I\". ==Writing and composition== The album was written and produced by Hval after she completed writing a novel, titled Girls Against God, which is due out in November 2020. The album was inspired by 1990s trance music and has been described as more accessible than Hval's previous work. In an interview for The Ringer, Hval explained, \"I wanted to have some kind of clarity in the sound, not to make things muddy and deep, but to have things very light and clear, almost like the element of the transcendental in trance. It's sort of an elevated state, a very receptive state, I find. I can write things that wouldn't happen with other sounds.\" ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, The Practice of Love received an average score of 84, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the album a favourable review, writing, \"It may be her subtlest, most approachable album yet; though its ideas are just as complex and provocative as those of Blood Bitch or Apocalypse, girl, there's something welcoming about it that engages the hearts and minds of her listeners fully.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Practice of Love. *Jenny Hval \u2013 vocals, background vocals, composer, arranger, instruments, production, programming (all tracks), concept, recording *Lasse Marhaug \u2013 co-production, mixing (track 8), recording (additional tracks), electronics, art direction *Laura Jean Englert \u2013 additional lyrics, vocals, voice (tracks 3, 4, 5), recording *Vivian Wang \u2013 vocals (tracks 1, 4, 5, 8), recording *F\u00e9licia Atkinson \u2013 vocals (tracks 3, 5, 8), recording *Anja Lauvdal \u2013 synths (tracks 1, 2) *Espen Reinertsen \u2013 saxophone (tracks 2, 3, 6) *Chris Elms \u2013 mixing (tracks 1\u20133, 5\u20137) *Kyrre Laastad \u2013 mixing (track 4) *Heba Kadry \u2013 mastering *Esra R\u00f8ise \u2013 artwork ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Jenny Hval albums Category:Sacred Bones Records albums ",
