Recorded in the basement of his parents' home in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping with a minidisk microphone and a home computer, released on home-made CD-Rs, and sold only through his website and at live performances.

I think he is an extraordinary talent and should be recognised as a great song writer. He may be Europe\u2019s answer to Brian Wilson.\u201d Image:Loney dear mg 6562.jpg|Emil Svan\u00e4ngen Image:Loney dear mg 6604.jpg|Malin St\u00e5hlberg Image:Loney dear mg 6560.jpg ==Discography== ===Albums=== *The Year of River Fontana (2003, self- released) *Citadel Band (2004, self-released) *Loney, Noir (2005, self- released) *Sologne (2006, self-released, Something in Construction (SICNOTE 025)) *Loney, Noir (re-issue) (2007, Sub Pop USA/Australia/New Zealand.
