Carty (1909\u20131970), a native of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn who lived his life only five blocks away and dedicated himself to New York City government for 32 years. ==History== Rubber Park was opened in 1964 and was one of the first parks in New York City to have rubber matting under the children's\u2019 equipment thus the name of Rubber Park. Rubber Park has been the home of numerous groups of kids and teens since its opening. John J. Carty Park, located between 94th and 101st Streets and Fort Hamilton Parkway, was named by Local Law in 1971. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) developed both the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (1965) and this park concurrently thanks to a 1956 federal grant.
