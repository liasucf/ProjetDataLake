    "text": "The Trouble with Being Born is a 2020 science fiction drama film directed and co-written by Sandra Wollner. An international co-production of Austria and Germany, the film stars Lena Watson as an android who was built by a father (Dominik Warta) as a replicate of his young daughter who disappeared years prior. The Trouble with Being Born premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, and garnered controversy for its depiction of a relationship between a man and an android that resembles his child. ==Cast== * Lena Watson as Elli/Emil, an android built by Georg * Dominik Warta as Georg * Ingrid Burkhard as Ms. Schikowa * Jana McKinnon as Elli, Georg's human daughter * Simon Hatzl as Toni ==Production== Director and co-writer Sandra Wollner has referred to the film as an \"antithesis to Pinocchio\". Wollner initially intended to cast a 20-year-old actress in the role of the android Elli, but after removing some of the more explicit elements from the film's script, she instead chose 10-year-old actress Lena Watson (a stage name inspired by Emma Watson) for the part. The scenes in which the android Elli is depicted nude were accomplished using computer-generated imagery. Watson also wore a silicone mask and wig, which served to both conceal her identity and help her resemble another actress who appears later in the film. ==Release and reception== The Trouble with Being Born had its world premiere at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival on 25 February 2020, as part of the festival's Encounters section. It was reported that several audience members walked out during the premiere. The film received the Special Jury Award in the Encounters section. Jonathan Romney of Screen Daily called the film \"a powerful and revelatory achievement [...] complex, artfully crafted, sometimes wilfully perplexing\". Jessica Kiang of Variety called it a \"desperately creepy, queasy, thought-provoking film\", and concluded: \"Wollner's lacerating intelligence and riveting craft make this extraordinarily effed-up riff on the 'Pinocchio' legend [...] much more than empty provocation\". Chris Barsanti of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two out of four stars, and wrote that the film \"suffers from the same issue as its moody androids: enervation borne out of repetition.\" The Melbourne International Film Festival decided to not screen the film at its 2020 festival, citing concerns raised by two forensic psychologists that it might \"[normalise] sexual interest in children\" and be \"used as a source of arousal for men interested in child abuse material\". The decision to remove the film from the festival line-up was denounced by film critics Peter Krausz, Tom Ryan and David Stratton. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020 science fiction films Category:Austrian films Category:Austrian drama films Category:Austrian science fiction films Category:German films Category:German drama films Category:German science fiction films Category:Android (robot) films ",
