    "text": "Minarete Brass was the first LP release by the Mexican producer and recording artist Sotel\u00fam. Considered by some Nortec Collective members as one of the most purposeful pieces of art in Tijuana. This album is the result of Sotel\u00fam's concerns to amalgamate modern jazz with mariachi and mexican folk music from the huasteca and tapatia regions of Mexico. The music from this album is performed by Sotel\u00fam & The Minarete Brass Orchestra, a live sub- project band specially grouped for live shows that has been described as \"regional pride\" by the IMAC and ICBC public institutions of culture. ==References== Category:2010 debut albums Category:Sotel\u00fam albums ",
