    "text": "In the mathematical field of group theory, the transfer defines, given a group G and a subgroup of finite index H, a group homomorphism from G to the abelianization of H. It can be used in conjunction with the Sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups. The transfer was defined by and rediscovered by . ==Construction== The construction of the map proceeds as follows:Following Scott 3.5 Let [G:H] = n and select coset representatives, say :x_1, \\dots, x_n,\\, for H in G, so G can be written as a disjoint union :G = \\bigcup\\ x_i H. Given y in G, each yxi is in some coset xjH and so :yx_i = x_jh_i for some index j and some element hi of H. The value of the transfer for y is defined to be the image of the product :\\textstyle \\prod_{i=1}^n h_i in H/H\u2032, where H\u2032 is the commutator subgroup of H. The order of the factors is irrelevant since H/H\u2032 is abelian. It is straightforward to show that, though the individual hi depends on the choice of coset representatives, the value of the transfer does not. It is also straightforward to show that the mapping defined this way is a homomorphism. ==Example== If G is cyclic then the transfer takes any element y of G to y[G:H]. A simple case is that seen in the Gauss lemma on quadratic residues, which in effect computes the transfer for the multiplicative group of non-zero residue classes modulo a prime number p, with respect to the subgroup {1, \u22121}. One advantage of looking at it that way is the ease with which the correct generalisation can be found, for example for cubic residues in the case that p \u2212 1 is divisible by three. ==Homological interpretation== This homomorphism may be set in the context of group cohomology (strictly, group homology), providing a more abstract definition.Serre (1979) p.120 The transfer is also seen in algebraic topology, when it is defined between classifying spaces of groups. ==Terminology== The name transfer translates the German Verlagerung, which was coined by Helmut Hasse. ==Commutator subgroup== If G is finitely generated, the commutator subgroup G\u2032 of G has finite index in G and H=G\u2032, then the corresponding transfer map is trivial. In other words, the map sends G to 0 in the abelianization of G\u2032. This is important in proving the principal ideal theorem in class field theory.Serre (1979) p.122 See the Emil Artin-John Tate Class Field Theory notes. == See also == * Focal subgroup theorem, an important application of transfer * By Artin's reciprocity law, the Artin transfer describes the principalization of ideal classes in extensions of algebraic number fields. == References == * * * Category:Group theory ",
