    "text": "The Blue Diamonds in January 1964 The Blue Diamonds were a Dutch 1960s rock and roll duo, best known for their million-selling chart-topping single, \"Ramona\". Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) brothers Ruud de Wolff (12 May 1941 \u2013 18 December 2000) and Riem de Wolff (15 April 1943 \u2013 12 September 2017) founded the group shortly after immigrating to Driebergen-Rijsenburg in the Netherlands in 1949. They were born in Batavia (now Jakarta), Indonesia. ==Early career== Called the 'Dutch Everly Brothers', The Blue Diamonds covered many Everly Brothers songs, but became famous in 1960 with their version of \"Ramona\", a song originally written for the 1928 film, Ramona. The song was written for promotional appearances with Dolores del R\u00edo (star of the film) but not featured in the film itself. The Blue Diamonds up-tempo version of it (changing it from an original rhythm to a one) reached the American Billboard Hot 100 at number 72 in 1960. It sold over 250,000 copies in the Netherlands (the first record to ever do so) and over one million copies in Germany by 1961. ==Later career== Although their last hit was in 1971, they continued to perform together up until Ruud de Wolff died from bladder cancer at the end of the year 2000. Riem de Wolff continued to perform and release albums until his death in 2017. At the time of his death, Riem had just been diagnosed with lung and liver cancer and had been suffering from the effects of a recent stroke. ==References== ==External links== * Fan site Category:Doo-wop groups Category:Dutch musical duos Category:Dutch-based Indonesian musical duos Category:Dutch people of Indonesian descent Category:Indonesian musical duos Category:Indo people Category:Decca Records artists Category:Philips Records artists Category:Sibling musical duos ",
