The series follows the adventures of a squad of teenage vampires who really know how to show their school spirit. Vampire Cheerleaders is the lead story in a supernatural double-feature of Vampire Cheerleaders and the Aoi House spin-off Paranormal Mystery Squad, about a team of cryptid hunters that each has some form of supernatural power, sans the main character.

On June 5, 2012, the first two print volumes were combined into a single 432-page omnibus containing the first two story arcs of Vampire Cheerleaders and sister series Paranormal Mystery Squad as the Vampire Cheerleaders/Paranormal Mystery Squad Monster Mash Collection. The Monster Mash Collection debuted at No. 9 on the New York Times Manga Best Sellers list for the week of June 24, 2012. Paranormal Mystery Squad has been incorporated into the archives on the Vampire Cheerleaders website. ==Plot== When one of Bakertown High School's vampire cheerleaders discover that one of their own is missing, Lori Thurston and the other senior cheerleaders have no other choice but to induct one of the eleventh grade girls from the 'B Squad' into their vampiric ranks. The girls hold tryouts, choosing sheltered virgin Heather Hartley. ==Characters== * Heather Hartley A naive eleventh grader on Bakertown's 'B Squad' who gets turned into a vampire, opening up a whole new world for her. Brought up in a strict household, her transformation lessens several of her inhibitions such as being dutiful and obedient to her overbearing parents whom she \"glamors\" into her slaves. Unfortunately she is unable to control her appetite in the first book and sucks the entire Bakertown football team dry. Thanks to some quick thinking by the A-squad the incident is covered up. * Lori Thurston Team captain. The cool and calculating queen bee and mentor of Bakertown High School's coven of \"Vampire Cheerleaders.\" She has maintained her position as head cheerleader for decades, changing her first name and returning every twenty years posing as her \"daughter\". She does not hesitate to enforce her authority among the others but treats the A-squad as an extended family. Her greatest concern is in maintaining a low profile to avoid trouble and continue living as an immortal cheerleader. * Zoe Weller Co-Captain. Constantly at odds with Suki due to the latter apparently killing her boyfriend. * Suki Taft Co-Captain (in name only). Constantly at odds with Zoe, apparently due to her killing the latter's boyfriend. Very crude and foul-mouthed. * Lesley Chandra Team Treasurer. The mother hen and the most kindly of the A-squad. * Leonard Duvall Heather's best friend. Something of a nerd, he suspects that the A-squad are vampires but Heather doesn't believe him until her transformation. He discovers the truth behind the A-squad and confronts them with intentions to expose their secret, but ultimately falls prey to Plan BC \"booty call\" and becomes a thrall to the A-squad. ==Volume list== *Vampire Cheerleaders Vol. 1. .
