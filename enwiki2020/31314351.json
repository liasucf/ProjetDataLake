    "text": "The 1997 Supercopa Libertadores was the tenth and final season of the Supercopa Libertadores, a club football tournament for past Copa Libertadores winners. Vasco da Gama were admitted to the tournament for the first time in recognition of winning the South American Championship of Champions in 1948. Argentinos Juniors did not take part. River Plate won the competition for the first time, defeating S\u00e3o Paulo 2\u20131 on aggregate in the final. For its final season, the format of the first round was changed from a two-legged knockout round to four groups of four teams playing each other twice. As 17 teams were scheduled to take part, a preliminary round was played to eliminate one team. As through the successive editions of this cup were added new champions from the Copa Libertadores, in 1997 the Conmebol decided that the last teams of each group would descend to reduce the number of teams to disputed it. That year descended Velez Sarsfield, Racing Club and Boca Juniors (all teams from Argentina) and Gremio (Brazil). ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Association !Team !Entry stage !Qualification method |- |rowspan=6| Argentina |Independiente |rowspan=6|Group stage |1964, 1965, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1984 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Estudiantes de La Plata |1968, 1969, 1970 Copa Libertadores champions |- |River Plate |1986, 1996 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Boca Juniors |1977, 1978 Copa Libertadores champions |- |V\u00e9lez Sarsfield |1994 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Racing de Avellaneda |1967 Copa Libertadores champions |- |rowspan=6| Brazil |Gr\u00eamio |rowspan=5|Group stage |1983, 1995 Copa Libertadores champions |- |S\u00e3o Paulo |1992, 1993 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Santos |1962, 1963 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Flamengo |1981 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Cruzeiro |1976 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Vasco da Gama |Preliminary round |1948 Campeonato de Campeones Sudamericano champions |- | Chile |Colo-Colo |Group stage |1991 Copa Libertadores champions |- | Colombia |Atl\u00e9tico Nacional |Group stage |1989 Copa Libertadores champions |- | Paraguay |Olimpia |Group stage |1979, 1990 Copa Libertadores champions |- |rowspan=2| Uruguay |Pe\u00f1arol |rowspan=2|Preliminary round |1960, 1961, 1966, 1982, 1987 Copa Libertadores champions |- |Nacional |1971, 1980, 1988 Copa Libertadores champions |} ;Notes ==Preliminary round== The matches were played from 15 June to 13 July. ==Group stage== The matches were played from 26 August to 30 October. ===Group 1=== ===Group 2=== ===Group 3=== ===Group 4=== ==Knockout phase== In the knockout phase, the four group winners played a single- elimination tournament.
