The area is in the Sutton Vesey ward. ==History== In the 16th century, this area of barren common land was known as the Wyld and was sparsely populated. After the Enclosure Act of 1825, there was some development and in 1840 the growth of the population to about 60 led to the building of the first school.Wylde Green Primary School In the 1850s substantial Victorian mansions began to appear along the Birmingham Road. Highbridge Road and Station Road were laid out in 1858 in anticipation of the coming of the railway. The railway with its station at Wylde Green railway station opened in 1862 (now on the Birmingham to Lichfield suburban line). Urbanisation of the area proceeded rapidly thereafter. In 1923, the parish of Wylde Green was created out of that of Boldmere.The borough of Sutton Coldfield - A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 4: Hemlingford Hundred (1947), pp. 230-245. Date accessed: 25 January 2008. In 1974 Sutton Coldfield, of which Wylde Green is a part, became part of the City of Birmingham. A consultative ballot in 2015 led to the formation of Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/the-council/. The role of this organisation is the same as a parish council. Wylde Green falls under its authority. Until recently there was a 1950s disused nuclear bunker that would have played a key role in the control of the Birmingham area in the event of a nuclear attack.Wylde Green - 4 Group, 74 Brigade AAOR serving the Birmingham GDA ==Geography== Wylde Green is situated on the south side of Sutton Coldfield, bordering the Chester Road district of north Erdington, Birmingham and the Pype Hayes district to the southeast . To the north is Beeches Walk (an informal boundary between it and the Maney area that heralds the start of the town centre of Sutton Coldfield). To the south is the Chester Road crossroads, near to the Yenton Public House, beyond which is Erdington. To the east across New Hall Valley is Walmley, and on the west is Boldmere. ==Housing and facilities== Much of the housing dates from the 1930s, late 1940s and 1950s. Much of the area is a middle-working class suburb, with small pockets of affluence. There is one tower block located within Wylde Green, Heron Court, which is behind The Lanes Shopping Centre, which also has flats above retail floors. Wylde Green Road, the road to Walmley, was noted for having a ford across Plants Brook until around 1967. Within the valley are New Hall Valley Country Park and Plantsbrook Nature Reserve. Also on the Wylde Green Road is a cottage which used to look over the ford. It was called the Fordkeeper's Cottage and was built by Bishop Vesey.Houses of the valley, houses of interest at Wylde Green crossing of Plants Brook, A.F. Fentiman Wylde Green is served by Wylde Green library, a one-storey building that, until recently, was run by volunteers. It is located to the rear of The Lanes Shopping Centre which, along with the rest of the street, hosts the main shopping area for Wylde Green.
