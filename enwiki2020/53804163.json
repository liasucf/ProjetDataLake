    "text": "Rolling Papers is a 2015 documentary film directed by Mitch Dickman and featuring Ricardo Baca. The \"deceptively rote title\" is said to be a winking reference to Baca's work as a newspaper writer. ==Reception== The Guardian gave the documentary three out of five stars. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \"The film... has a maddeningly short attention span, delving just far enough into one subject to whet your appetite before flitting on to the next. That approach extends to a secondary theme: whether the pot beat is just a gimmick, a desperate effort to attract attention and readers. That possibility is raised but never really examined... So the two most likely audiences for this documentary \u2014 people interested in marijuana and people interested in the news business \u2014 will probably find it shallower than they\u2019d hoped. It's full of discussion points but lets them go by undiscussed.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Rolling Papers at RogerEbert.com * Rolling Papers: Mitch Dickman at Exclaim.ca Category:2015 films Category:American documentary films about cannabis Category:American films ",
