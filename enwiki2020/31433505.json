    "text": "Moctezuma's Palace from the Codex Mendoza (1542) Casas Nuevas de Moctezuma () is the name of a pre-hispanic residential complex composed of five interconnected palaces with large platforms. The complex served as the royal palace and chambers of Tenochtitlan's ninth emperor Moctezuma II, who was the Aztec leader during the arrival of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. The name casa nuevas (\"new houses\") was given to distinguish the palaces from anterior Aztec palaces. The stones of these buildings were used for the construction of the National Palace of Mexico. The site was uncovered in 2008, during a partial renovation of the Museo Nacional de las Culturas, along with a series of excavations led by archaeologist Elsa Hern\u00e1ndez Pons. The site is several layers deep because the Spanish colonials built Mexico City on top of the once-majestic Aztec buildings, that the Spanish salvaged. Moctezuma's Casa Denegrida, or \"black house\", was among the discoveries found. It was a window-less room that was painted black and served as Moctezuma's meditating place. ==Related pages== *Casa Denegrida de Moctezuma ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Mexico Category:Buildings and structures in Mesoamerica Category:Tenochtitlan ",
