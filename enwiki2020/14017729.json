(2003, revised 2004) Lost Railways of Lancashire, Countryside Books, Newbury, , p.36 The line crossed the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway (L&PJR;) on the level, immediately to the west of the station. By 1844, most of the line's trains were diverted along the L&PJR;'s line to use the main Preston Station instead. However, Maudlands Station continued to be used for excursions and as a goods station for several decades before its eventual closure and demolition, by 1885, to make way for an extension of the Longridge Branch Line. The remainder of the site was then used for a replacement goods station on the Longridge line which connected from the east. The site is now occupied by Leighton Hall on Leighton Street and by the University of Central Lancashire\u2019s Roeburn Hall, with the disused Longridge line running between them. UCLan's Roeburn Hall is on the site of the former station {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 430px Railways in the Maudlands area in 1849 | style=\"text-align: center\" | 200px 1892 |- | style=\"text-align: center\" | 200px 2012 |- | colspan=\"2\" | # Maudlands railway station and first goods station # Maudland Bridge railway station # Engine shed # St Walburge's RC Church # Second Maudland Goods Station from 1885 # Roeburn Hall # Leighton Hall |} == Temporary station == For two days in 1991, the station name \"Preston Maudlands\" was revived for a temporary platform.
