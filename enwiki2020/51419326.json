Mieke soon reveals to Brandt that she is secretly Jewish. Gestapo Inspector Dietrich informs Brandt that the British Secret Service has an agent with a radio somewhere in a nearby village, asking Brandt to watch for a second agent inside the Kaiser's household. Prior to a visit from SS Commander Heinrich Himmler, Brandt notices a smell of gun oil from Mieke's room. He follows Mieke when she visits the village pastor andwatching outside a windowhears her tell the pastor that she is prepared to assassinate Himmler as revenge for the SS murdering her father and husband. The pastor responds that assassinating Himmler is not their mission. The SS pinpoints the pastor\u2019s radio transmissions. They arrest and torture him, demanding the name of the other spy. Shortly afterward, Wilhelm's wife Hermine, jealous of Wilhelm's fondness for Mieke, tells him of Brandt and Mieke's affair. She expects her husband to dismiss Mieke and have Brandt court-martialed, but he responds that even though he no longer rules Germany, he will rule his own house. In private, he reveals to the lovers that he fathered illegitimate children before and after marrying his first wife, his Empress. He orders the lovers to go about their duties, but to be more discreet. During a planned house search before Himmler's arrival, Brandt himself searches Mieke's room to protect her ruse. After Himmler's arrival, when Brandt learns that the pastor has revealed Mieke's identity, he urges her to flee. She refuses, insisting that she has a mission. Himmler extends to Wilhelm an invitation from Adolf Hitler to return to his former throne in Berlin. He then meets with Brandt and Dietrich, informing them that the invitation is a bluff, intended to draw out and execute anti-Nazi monarchists. Hermine is overjoyed at the thought of finally becoming Empress of Germany but Wilhelm, troubled by Himmler's boasts about the euthanasia of disabled children, remains unsureeven when Colonel von Ilsemann speaks to him of how Wilhelm can become \"a restraining influence.\" When Brandt asks von Ilsemann whether an officer can serve something other than his country, the Colonel replies, \"First you must decide what is your country and if it even still exists.\" Brandt pauses, then tells von Ilsemann of Himmler's plans for the Kaiser's supporters. Mieke completes her mission by delivering to Wilhelm a message from Winston Churchill, offering the Kaiser political asylum in Great Britain and the throne of a defeated Germany after the war. Wilhelm refuses, having decided that he is finally at peace with the loss of his throne. As the Gestapo closes in on Mieke, Brandt devises an escape plan. Wilhelm, Mieke, and Brandt escape in a van as the Kaiser pretends to have a heart attack. In the process, Brandt kills Dietrich and another SS officer. Mieke asks Brandt to flee with her, fearing he will be executed for the murders. Brandt insists that he has a duty to Germany and has a good alibi. As Mieke departs, Brandt asks Mieke to marry him. She tells Brandt yes and to find her after the war, then she flees into the woods. Some time later, Brandt is working at a desk in Berlin. He is delivered a package, which contains a book of Friedrich Nietzsche's writings that Mieke had once shown him. Inside is written a London address. In London, Mieke is seated on a park bench when she is informed that Churchill is ready to see her. Rising, Mieke puts her hand on her belly, revealing that she is pregnant. In Utrecht, von Ilsemann informs Wilhelm that Brandt has called from Berlin with wonderful news. Realizing this means Mieke has escaped to Britain, Wilhelm is overjoyed. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Pre-production=== Christopher Plummer's longtime manager and one of the film's lead producers, Lou Pitt, was recommended Alan Judd's novel The Kaiser's Last Kiss.
