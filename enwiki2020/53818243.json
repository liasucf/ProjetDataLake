    "text": "The 2018\u201319 Premier League was the 27th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992. The season started on 10 August 2018 and concluded on 12 May 2019. Fixtures for the 2018\u201319 season were announced on 14 June 2018. The league was contested by the top 17 teams from the 2017\u201318 season as well as Wolverhampton Wanderers, Cardiff City and Fulham, who joined as the promoted clubs from the 2017\u201318 EFL Championship. They replaced West Bromwich Albion, Swansea City and Stoke City who were relegated to the 2018\u201319 EFL Championship. Defending champions Manchester City won their fourth Premier League title, and sixth English top-flight title overall. They won their last 14 league games and retained the league title on the final day of the season, finishing on 98 points. Liverpool finished runners-up with 97 points \u2013 the highest total in English top-flight history for a second-placed team. == Summary == Manchester City claimed the league title on the final day of the season with a 4\u20131 win at Brighton & Hove Albion, finishing on 98 points after a run of 14 wins. Liverpool held a 7-point lead over Manchester City on 3 January, but finished runners-up with 97 points \u2013 the third highest total in Premier League history and the highest in English top-flight history for a second-placed team, having lost only one league match all season \u2013 to eventual champions City. Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur claimed the other two Champions League berths, finishing in third and fourth place respectively. Tottenham were in third place for much of the season and were considered potential title challengers until a 1\u20132 loss to Burnley in February. Chelsea would go on to win the season's UEFA Europa League, defeating Arsenal in the final 4\u20131. Arsenal had gone on a fourteen-game unbeaten run near the start of the season and began April in third place, but a run of four points in six matches saw them drop to fifth place, finishing outside of the Champions League spots. Manchester United's worst start to the season for 28 years led to the sacking of manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in December, with former player Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r replacing him, initially as a caretaker. Solskj\u00e6r was appointed permanently after an impressive run of results which culminated in United's away goals victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League, but the team's poor form soon returned, and they eventually finished sixth after the team had won none of their final five league matches. Newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers achieved their highest finish since 1980 by finishing seventh, having taken points off every team in the league except Liverpool and Huddersfield Town. Their seventh-place finish was the highest for a newly promoted team since Ipswich Town finished 5th in the 2000\u201301 season. Huddersfield were the first team to be relegated, following their 0\u20132 defeat at Crystal Palace on 30 March 2019, coinciding with victories for Burnley and Southampton. They were relegated with six games remaining. This made Huddersfield the second team in Premier League history to be relegated before March ended, following Derby County in 2007\u201308. Fulham joined them after a 1\u20134 defeat at Watford on 2 April, relegated with five games remaining. Cardiff City were the final team to be relegated following a 2\u20133 loss at home to Crystal Palace on 4 May with one game remaining. The fastest goal in Premier League history was scored this season on 23 April by Shane Long in a 1\u20131 draw between his side Southampton and Watford after 7.69 seconds. On 4 May 2019, Fulham's Harvey Elliott became the youngest ever Premier League player at 16 years and 30 days. Tottenham Hotspur had a run of 28 games without a draw, the longest ever recorded from the start of a Premier League season. Manchester City did not draw any of their final 30 matches. The season saw two aviation incidents involving Premier League personnel. On 27 October 2018, Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was killed in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium, shortly after a 1\u20131 home draw against West Ham United. Almost three months later, on 21 January 2019, Cardiff City player Emiliano Sala, en route to join the club following his record signing from Nantes, died on board a Piper PA-46 Malibu aircraft that crashed off Alderney. == Teams == Twenty teams competed in the league \u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Wolverhampton Wanderers (returning to the top flight after a six-year absence), Cardiff City and Fulham (both teams returning after a four-year absence). They replaced Swansea City, Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion, ending their top flight spells of seven, ten and eight years respectively. === Stadiums and locations === :Note: Table lists in alphabetical order. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
