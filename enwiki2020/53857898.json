    "text": "Cecilia Comunales (born 4 December 1988 in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay) is a boxer. She has a professional record of 14-1 and was named WBA women's lightweight champion of the world. ==Early life== At age seven she won a beauty contest during the cosmopolitan city's annual \"Beer Week\", and has since been known as \"La Reina\", i.e. \"The Queen\". Initially inspired by the Clint Eastwood women's boxing movie \"Million Dollar Baby\", Comunales began her boxing training at age 16. She compiled a 14-4-2 record as an amateur, competing mostly in Argentina. Before taking up contact sports, Comunales had practiced skating and gymnastics. She has said that her mother did not want her to get into boxing after she saw \"Million Dollar Baby\", so she first told her that she was training in gymnastics. ==Professional career== Comunales made her professional debut on January 10, 2009 and quickly won her first 6 fights before losing in early 2010. Since that sole loss she has gone on to win her last 8 fights. On this run of wins she has picked up both the UBO and WBC lightweight titles. Apart from one fight in Panama in 2012 all of her fights have taken place in either Argentina or Uruguay. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |15 |Win |14-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Valeria Rodrigues dos Santos |TKO |8 (10), |4 Jun 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |14 |Win |13-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lina Tejada |UD |10 |8 Aug 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |13 |Win |12-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alicia Susana Alegre |TKO |5 (6) |19 Dec 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |12 |Win |11-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Marisol Reyes |TKO |1 (10), |20 Jul 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |11 |Win |10-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Simone Aparecida Da Silva |UD |10 |3 Nov 2012 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |10 |Win |9-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Maribel Santana |TKO |1 (10) |30 Mar 2012 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |9 |Win |8-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alicia Susana Alegre |UD |10 |19 Apr 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |8 |Win |7-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Halanna Dos Santos |KO |6 (10), |9 Jan 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |7 |Loss |6-1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Victorina Britez |UD |4 |15 Feb 2010 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |6 |Win |6-0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Elizabethe Bastos | |1 (4), |6 Nov 2009 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |5 |Win |5-0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Lorena Paola De Mello |TKO |1 (4), |18 Jun 2009 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |4 |Win |4-0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Roxana Raquel Peralta |UD |4 |30 Apr 2009 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |3 |Win |3-0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Roxana Raquel Peralta | |4 |3 Apr 2009 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |2 |Win |2-0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Silvia Beatriz Lescano |TKO |1 (4), |23 Feb 2009 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |1 |Win |1-0 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Lorena Nancy Lopez | |1 (4), |10 Jan 2009 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |} ==References== Category:1988 births Category:Sportspeople from Paysand\u00fa Category:World boxing champions Category:Living people Category:Uruguayan women boxers Category:World lightweight boxing champions ",
