The company was dissolved in 2017 following the sale of all its operational assets https://www.solocheck.ie/Irish-Company/Capital-Bars-Limited-306664 The business originally began in O'Dwyers Bar and Lounge, in Mount Street Dublin 2. This small family run pub was extensively refurbished by elder brother Liam O'Dwyer in the early 1980s and became the first \"victorian style\" pub of which Dublin is so well known for now. This was also one of the first pubs in Dublin to sell \"pub-grub\" at lunch times. The chain reached its peak in number of pubs in the early 2000s, with 11 pubs/nightclubs, one Planet Hollywood franchise and 3 hotels in 2001; but significant numbers of pubs were divested prior to 2009 including Bad Bobs for \u20ac12m in 2006.https://www.irishtimes.com/business/brothers-sell-bad-bobs- for-12m-1.1026176 Poor financial performance was reported during the mid-00s. https://www.irishtimes.com/business/capital-s-10-5m-loss-due-to-new- lifestyles-1.474412 The company entered mixed examinership/receivership on September 19, 2009; five days after poor results showing a 10m euro loss in the previous year. At that time the portfolio of multi-themed bars (several of them 'superpubs') included: Break for the Border, Caf\u00e9 En Seine, Howl at the Moon, The Dragon, and The George, Dublin. All were situated in key locations in Dublin City Centre.
