He missed the start of the season through injury, but worked his way back through the SANFL to play in the Power's Round 5 win over the Saints before injury struck the following week. He managed two more games for the year, but it was decided after the break to rest him for the remainder of the year. Hartlett was sent to Europe for further treatment on his troublesome hamstring In 2011 Hartlett overcame shoulder surgery to return to the Power side for Round 3 and was then able to string 16 consecutive games together averaging 20.8 disposals per game \u2013 his best run in the AFL. In his most consistent year for the club to date, Hartlett finished seventh in the John Cahill Medal and was awarded the Gavin Wanganeen Medal as the club's best rising talent. He spent more time in the midfield later in the year and this saw an increase in his productivity, including a 32 disposal game against St Kilda in Round 16. His season was cut short after Round 20 when he was forced to undergo shoulder surgery. He finished the season fifth in total kicks for the club Hartlett started the 2012 season with a best on ground performance in the Power's narrow win over the Saints in Round 1. He had 26 disposals and kicked a vital goal playing across half back. His early season form was solid, but he struggled to have the impact on games. He continued to mix his time between half back and the midfield. His best performance of the year came in Round 10 against Carlton, when Hartlett received the three Brownlow votes for 26 disposals and three raking goals from outside 50m. Hartlett's season was derailed in Round 12 when he suffered a hamstring tear, which kept him out until Round 19.

Hartlett finished the season ranked sixth at the club for average disposals and fourth for total tackles Season 2014 was considered a breakout season for Hartlett where played the majority of the season in the midfield, averaging 21 disposals and kicking 21 goals. His field kicking was consistently damaging. His best performances of the season were a Showdown medal winning game against the Crows in round 2 and an important semi final performance where he racked up a team high 33 disposals. However, in 2015, Hartlett had an up and down season. He was often serviceable in his role across half back and pushing up to the wing but seemed to be less damaging, particularly with his kicking inside 50. His tally of 9 goals was well short of his 21 from 2014. He did however record a personal best for disposals in a season and played every game for the first time in his too often injury interrupted career. For the 2016 season, Hartlett was announced as the vice- captain of the club to captain Travis Boak.http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2016-02-25/hartlett-elevated-to- vicecaptain ==Notes== ==External links== * * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Port Adelaide Football Club players Category:Port Adelaide Football Club players (all competitions) Category:West Adelaide Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia ",
