His revolt lasted from approximately late February to early June 269.Polfer, Laelianus ==Origins== Little is known about Laelianus. He shares the same nomen as a prominent Hispano-Roman family, the Ulpii, that included Trajan among its members, and may have been a relative.Polfer, Laelianus This is supported by the strong allusion to Hispania on an aureus he struck, which featured the design of Hispania reclining with a rabbit to her side. If he indeed was a relative, this may be the reason Hispania allied itself with Claudius II, after the death of Laelianus, seemingly without a struggle. ==Rule== Laelianus declared himself emperor at Moguntiacum in February/March 269.Polfer, Laelianus; Potter, pg. 265 after repulsing a Germanic invasion.Polfer, Laelianus Although his exact position is unknown, he is believed to have been a senior officer under Postumus,Potter, pg. 265 either the legatus of Germania Superior or the commander of Legio XXII Primigenia.Polfer, Laelianus Laelianus represented a strong danger to Postumus because of the two legions he commanded (Primigenia in Moguntiacum and VIII Augusta in Argentoratum);Polfer, Laelianus Despite this, his rebellion lasted only about two months before he was executed,Polfer, Laelianus reputedly by his own soldiers, or by Postumus' troops after a siege of Laelianus' capital.Martindale, pg. 492 The siege of Moguntiacum was also fatal for Postumus; it is said he was slain when he refused to allow his troops to plunder the city following its capture.Southern, pg. 118 Laelianus (under the name Lollianus) is listed among the Thirty Tyrants in the Historia Augusta. ==See also== * Ulpia (gens) == References == ==Sources== ===Primary sources=== * Aurelius Victor, Liber de Caesaribus * Eutropius, Brevarium, Book 9 * Historia Augusta, The Thirty Tyrants ===Secondary sources=== * Southern, Pat.
