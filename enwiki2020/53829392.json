Hussain wins National Film Award \u2013 Special Mention (feature film) at 64th National Film Awards for acting in this film. ==Plot== After a long gap of more than ten years, renowned writer Priyendu Hazarika returns to the town where once he was inspired to begin his journey as a writer. A book at times imitates the author's life.The book in question is an imaginary one, \"A River Runs Ashore\", woven into a meta-narrative. Memories stir and he remembers people he loved and lost. The conceit of his frequent meandering into memories gives shape to a saga of childhood and loss set in rustic North Guwahati. He admits to lacking the courage to weave a painful, harsh truth into his stories. At the end of the day however, he decides to face his own truth, alone, away from the appreciative audience. ==Cast== *Adil Hussain *Shakil Imtiaz *Mahendra Rabha *Sulakshana Baruah *Pranami Bora * Kasvi Sharma ==References== Category:Indian films Category:Assamese-language films Category:Best Assamese Feature Film National Film Award winners Category:2010s Assamese-language films ",
