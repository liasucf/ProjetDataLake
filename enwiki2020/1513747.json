    "text": "DBT Online Inc., formerly known as Database Technologies, is a data mining company founded by Roy Brubaker and Hank Asher in 1992 in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. It is today a subsidiary of US data aggregation group, ChoicePoint. DBT Online was formed as a public holding company by the merger of Database Technologies and Patlex in 1996. DBT Online bought Asher out for US$147 million in 1999. This followed the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration suspending their contracts with DBT Online following revelations that Asher had been involved but not charged with drug dealing in the Bahamas. The agencies were also concerned that DBT Online could potentially monitor targets of investigations.
