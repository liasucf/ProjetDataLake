At St Andrews, he was from 1891 to 1893 a lecture assistant to Thomas Purdie, from 1893 to 1896 a \"university assistant\" engaged in teaching, and from 1896 to 1898 a research assistant to Purdie in stereochemistry and optical activity. In 1898 McKenzie went to the University of Berlin to work under Landolt and received there in 1899 his D.Sc. He left Berlin in 1901 after receiving his Ph.D. under the supervision of Marckwald and went to London's Jenner Institute, where he stayed until 1902. At Birbeck College, London, McKenzie was from 1902 to 1905 an assistant lecturer and demonstrator and from 1905 to 1914 head of the chemistry department. At University College, Dundee, he held the chair of chemistry from 1914 until his retirement in 1938. McKenzie was the author or co-author of over 100 research papers. He was elected F.R.S. in 1916. Much of his research in the early part of his career deal with asymmetric synthesis.McKenzie, A. (1904). CXXVII.\u2014Studies in asymmetric synthesis. I. Reduction of menthyl benzoylformate. II.
