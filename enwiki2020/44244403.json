This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of August 2014 only 23 bowlers have taken at least 20 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Terry Alderman (born 12 June 1956) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement. He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series he took 42 Test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition. Alderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387, when that country was banned from Test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990\u201391 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final Test series was against the West Indies in 1990\u201391, where he ended his career with 170 Test wickets. In his 41 Tests Alderman took 5 wickets in an innings 14 times, and 10 in a match once. In addition he played 65 One Day Internationals for Australia taking 88 wickets, twice achieving a five-wicket haul. Alderman was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1982, the same year as Allan Border. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" |- ! Symbol !
