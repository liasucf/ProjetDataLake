    "text": "April's Daughter () is a 2017 Mexican drama film directed by Michel Franco. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize in that section. ==Plot== Valeria (Ana Valeria Becerril), 17, is pregnant. She lives in Puerto Vallarta, with Clara (Joanna Larequi), her half sister, who is calm, but lives with depression and is overweight. Valeria does not want her mother, April (Emma Su\u00e1rez), who has been absent for a long time, to know about her pregnancy but, due to economic limitations and the overwhelming responsibility of having a baby at home, Clara decides to call her mother. April arrives with a great desire to see her daughters, but we soon see why Valeria did not want to get in touch with her. It is \"the story of an adult woman who refuses to feel 'overtaken' by her own daughters in generational terms, without realising that she has been left behind in more important aspects, such as emotional and psychological, among others.\" ==Cast== * Emma Su\u00e1rez as Abril * Ana Valeria Becerril as Valeria * Hern\u00e1n Mendoza as Gregorio * Ivan Cortes as Jorge * Enrique Arrizon as Mateo * Joanna Larequi as Clara ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:2017 drama films Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican drama films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films directed by Michel Franco ",
