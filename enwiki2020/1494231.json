    "text": "Charles III (Charles Honor\u00e9 Grimaldi; 8 December 1818 \u2013 10 September 1889) was Prince of Monaco and Duke of Valentinois from 20 June 1856 to his death. He was the founder of the famous casino in Monte Carlo, as his title in Monegasque and Italian was Carlo III.Referred to also as Carlo III. He was born in Paris, the only son of Florestan, Prince of Monaco, and Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. ==Marriage and reign== {| align=\"left\" | Royal Monogram of Prince Charles III of Monaco |} While he was Hereditary Prince, Charles was married on 28 September 1846 in Brussels to Countess Antoinette de M\u00e9rode- Westerloo. He succeeded his father Prince Florestan I in 1856. During his reign, the towns of Menton and Roquebrune, constituting some 80 percent of Monegasque territory, were formally ceded to France, paving the way for formal French recognition of Monaco's independence. Rebellions in these towns, aided by the Kingdom of Sardinia, had exhausted Monaco's military resources for decades. The Principality was in dire need of cash flow, so Prince Charles and his mother, Princess Caroline, had the idea of erecting a casino. The Monte Carlo Casino was done, according to the Prince's liking, in the German style and placed at the sight of Les Sp\u00e9lugues. Monte Carlo (in English, Mount Charles) itself takes its name from Charles, after all its founder. Charles established a society (business) to run the Casino; this society is today the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco. Under Charles III, the Principality of Monaco increased its diplomatic activities; for example, in 1864, Charles III concluded a Treaty of Friendship with the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad III as-Sadiq, which also regulated trade and maritime issues. ==Honours== Monte Carlo is named after Charles III. It stands for the \"Mount Charles\" in Italian. The Order of Saint-Charles was instituted on 15 March 1858, during the reign of Prince Charles III. He received the following decorations and awards: * 50px Grand Cross of St. Olav, with Collar, 27 March 1863 (Sweden-Norway) * 50px Grand Cross of the Dannebrog, in Diamonds, 16 February 1865 (Denmark)Kongelig Dansk Hof-og Statskalendar (1880) (in Danish), \"De Kongelig Danske Ridderordener\", p. 8 * 50px Grand Cross of the Ludwig Order, 17 April 1865 (Grand Duchy of Hesse) Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des Gro\u00dfherzogtum Hessen (1879), \"Gro\u00dfherzogliche Orden und Ehrenzeichen\" p. 12 * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, 17 February 1867 (Spain) * 50px Grand Cross of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion, 1869 (Grand Duchy of Baden)Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des Gro\u00dfherzogtum Baden (1873), \"Gro\u00dfherzogliche Orden\" p. 74 * 50px Officer of the Legion d'Honneur, for his service in the French Navy in the Franco- Prussian War (French Empire) * 50px Grand Cordon of the Royal Order of Leopold, 1874 (Belgium)Almanach royal officiel: 1875; p. 55 * 50px Grand Cross of St. Stephen, 1882 (Austria-Hungary)\"A Szent Istv\u00e1n Rend tagjai\" * 50px Knight of the Supreme Order of Christ (Holy See) * 50px Grand Cross of the Tower and Sword (Kingdom of Portugal) ==Death== In his middle years his sight greatly weakened, and by the last decade of his life he had become almost totally blind. In fact, Dr. Thomas Henry Pickering wrote in 1882: \"So far back as 1860, Prince Charles lost his eyesight....\" He died at Ch\u00e2teau de Marchais on 10 September 1889. He was succeeded by his son Albert I of Monaco. ==Coin== On 1 June 2016, fifteen thousand 2 euro coins were issued by Monaco; commemorating the 150th anniversary of the foundation of Monte Carlo by Charles III ==In literature== Charles III is referenced, as Prince Charles Honor\u00e9, in a fictional entitled, The Fall of Prince Florestan of Monaco, by the British politician Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke. This work was one of satire and parody on a number of political characters of the day. It centered around a Cambridge-educated, half-W\u00fcrttemberg nephew of Charles III who comes to the throne by way of Charles III and the next two heirs being wiped out of existence. The upstart \"Florestan II\", a radical republican, boldly attempts to democratize Monaco. He fails and then is forced to leave the country. ==Ancestry== ==References== |- Category:1818 births Category:1889 deaths Category:House of Grimaldi Category:Hereditary Princes of Monaco Category:Princes of Monaco Category:Burials at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate, Monaco Category:Monegasque princes Category:Marquesses of Baux Category:People from Paris Category:Grand Masters of the Order of Saint- Charles Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Ludwigsorden Category:Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:Knights of the Supreme Order of Christ Category:Monegasque people of Italian descent Category:People of Ligurian descent Category:Dukes of Valentinois ",
