    "text": "Liu Tong (, c. 1593\u20131637) was a Chinese politician and writer from Macheng in Huanggang. He was a figure in the Ming Dynasty's Jingling school () of Chinese prose literature in contrast to the Gongan school () and the well known Yuan Hongdao and his brothers. He is credited with the Dijing Jingwulue. His \u5e1d\u4eac\u666f\u7269\u7565 (Pinyin D\u00ecj\u012bng j\u01d0ngw\u00f9 \u00e8), or Resume of Sights and Goods of the Imperial Capital is thought to actually to have been a travel guide to the historical and geographical attractions of Beijing. The work includes mention of the Catholic cathedral and the tomb of the Jesuit Matteo Ricci. Its inclusion of anecdote and unusual detail make it an invaluable study of Beijing in the early 17th century. In 1630, Liu became a member of the National University and passed his Jinshi examination in 1634. He became a magistrate of Suzhou, but died en route in 1637. ==References== *Biography by Lienche Tu Fang in Goodrich and Fang, Dictionary of Ming Biography 1368-1644, New York, 1976, vol. 1, pp. 968\u2013970. *Yin, Gonghong, \"Liu Tong\".
