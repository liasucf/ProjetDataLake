Mexico Cozumel Island Coati taken Jan 2020 Cozumel Island Coati Family at Fury Beach, Mexico The Cozumel coati (Nasua narica nelsoni), or Cozumel Island coati, is a coati from the Mexican island of Cozumel. It is in the family Procyonidae, which also includes raccoons, olingos, and kinkajous. It has been treated as a species, but the vast majority of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies of the white- nosed coati.Kays, R. (2009). White-nosed Coati (Nasua narica), pp. 527-528 in: Wilson, D. E., and R. A. Mittermeier, eds. (2009). Handbook of the Mammals of the World. Vol. 1, Carnivores. Cozumel Island coatis are slightly smaller than the white-nosed coatis of the adjacent mainland (N. n. yucatanica); but, when compared more widely to white-nosed coatis, the difference in size is not as clear.Decker, D. M. (1991). Systematics Of The Coatis, Genus Nasua (Mammalia, Procyonidae) . Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington 104: 370-386 The level of other differences also support its status as a subspecies rather than a separate species. It has been speculated that it is the result of an ancient introduction to Cozumel by the Mayans.Nowak, R., eds. (1999). Walker's Mammals of the World. Vol. 1, p. 700. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press University Press. Although not rated by the IUCN (where included in the widespread white-nosed coati), it is believed that the Cozumel Island coati is highly threatened and close to extinction. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Procyonidae Coati, Cozumel Coati, Cozumel Category:Carnivorans of Central America Coati, Cozumel Coati, Cozumel Coati, Cozumel Category:Taxa named by Clinton Hart Merriam Category:Mammals described in 1901 ",
