    "text": "Cash Savage and the Last Drinks is an Australian band from Melbourne, formed in 2008 by singer and guitarist Cash Savage. Currently, the lineup also includes guitarist Joe White and Jess Zubkevych, fiddlist Kat Mear, percussionist Rene Mancuso, and bassist Nick Finch. They have released four studio albums: Wolf (2010), The Hypnotiser (2013), One of Us (2016), and Good Citizens (2018). ==History== ===2008-2014: Formation and Wolf & The Hypnotiser=== Singer and songwriter Cash Savage grew up in Port Albert, in the Gippsland region of Victoria, and is the eldest of five children. Born into a musical family, Savage's uncle was Conway Savage, a veteran Australian rock musician and keyboardist for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Savage began playing gigs around Melbourne at age 17. In 2008, Savage formed the Last Drinks as her backing band, with no fixed line-up, but instead including whoever was available to play on any given night. A self-released, self-titled EP was released in 2008. Savage credits Fitzroy venue The Old Bar as the band's spiritual home. In 2010, the band released Wolf. The band's line-up was solidified in 2013, and they recorded The Hypnotiser at Head Gap Studios in Preston, Victoria, produced by Nick Finch (Graveyard Train) and engineered by Nao Anzai. The album was featured in year-end critic lists by Triple R, PBS 106.7FM, and Beat Magazine. \"I\u2019m in Love\" was nominated for Best Song at the Music Victoria Awards of 2013. ===2015-present: One of Us & Good Citizens=== In 2015, the band was signed to independent Australian label Mistletone Records to release its third studio album, One of Us (2016). The album's lyrical content reflects a tumultuous personal period for Savage. Upon its release, One of Us received very favourable critical reviews from publications such as the Sydney Morning Herald, the Herald Sun, and Beat Magazine, and was named Album of the Week by Triple R. The album's success saw the band tour Europe in 2015 and 2016, playing shows and festivals in Czech Republic, France, Poland, Netherlands and Austria. Following their first international tour, the band received distribution for their 2nd and 3rd albums across Europe by Beast Records. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
