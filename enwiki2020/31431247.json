Coach Alexander Alexandrov said of Dementyeva's win in the European all-around, \"There isn't a bigger workaholic on the team; she trains the hardest. Maybe she still doesn't have the most difficult routines, but she is an example for the whole team. Nobody equals her when it comes to hard work. Thanks to this, she managed to become European champion. It's nice when athletes achieve everything thanks to their hard work.\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Gymnast- Magazine/94617143137?sk=wall At the Moscow World Cup event in May, Dementyeva was in dominant form, winning gold medals in the floor exercise and on the beam.

I did not know she could win Europeans. And she got on beam and got the highest score right off and was a point ahead of everyone on one event. She needs to improve her vault and if she does then she can be competitive. She has a good beam routine, even though you can always fall on beam, but for the all-around she has a very high difficulty score. And we are still trying to add difficulty to her programme\".

As Blythe Lawrence pointed out in Universal Sports, Dementyeva brought out some upgrades to her routines during the competition: \"In spite of Russian coach Aleksander Aleksandrov's assertion that Dementyeva is not an all-around threat outside of Europe, the baby of last year's World Team looked pretty darn good in her home country. Dementyeva showed off an upgraded double-twisting Yurchenko on vault and channeled a jazz age screen siren in her new floor routine when she wasn't landing some truly challenging tumbling, including a full in double tuck final pass.\"http://www.universalsports.com/news- blogs/blogs/blog=tumblemumble/postid=551048.html Dementyeva went on to win silver medals on the vault and on the beam during the event finals of the competition, and also finished fourth on the uneven bars and sixth in the floor event.
