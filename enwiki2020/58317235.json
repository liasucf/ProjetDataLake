    "text": "The Murat Pa\u015fa Mosque () is a 15th century Ottoman mosque at Aksaray in the Fatih district of Istanbul, Turkey. ==Architecture== It was commissioned in 1465/66 by Hass Murad Pasha (mod. Turkish Has Murat Pa\u015fa). It was completed after his death by his brother Mesih Pasha, who was buried there. The mosque is designed in the Bursa style with the main space covered by a number of identical domes. This is an early Ottoman style which was soon abandoned in favour of the single large dome with smaller extensions. In this case, the main space is a 2 x 1 rectangle and is covered with two identical domes, each high and in diameter. The mihrab and minbar are on the short side of the rectangle.
