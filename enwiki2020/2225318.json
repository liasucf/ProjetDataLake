    "text": "Omicron Persei (\u03bf Persei, abbreviated Omicron Per, \u03bf Per) is a triple star system in the constellation of Perseus. From parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission it is approximately 1,100 light-years (340 parsecs) from the Sun. The system consists of a binary pair designated Omicron Persei A and a third companion Omicron Persei B. A's two components are themselves designated Omicron Persei Aa (officially named Atik , the traditional name of the system) and Ab. ==Nomenclature== \u03bf Persei in optical light \u03bf Persei (Latinised to Omicron Persei) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as Omicron Persei A and B, and those of A's components - Omicron Persei Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It bore the traditional name Atik (also Ati, Al Atik), Arabic for \"the shoulder\". Some sources, including a planetarium software package, an atlas, and a web siteYour Sky Object Catalogue: Named Stars attribute the name Atik to the nearby, brighter star Zeta Persei. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Atik for the component Omicron Persei A on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Rolled Tongue, refers to an asterism consisting of Omicron Persei, Nu Persei, Epsilon Persei, Xi Persei, Zeta Persei and 40 Persei. \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.

Consequently, the Chinese name for Omicron Persei itself is (), \"the Fifth Star of Rolled Tongue\". \u9999\u6e2f\u592a\u7a7a\u9928 - \u7814\u7a76\u8cc7\u6e90 - \u4eae\u661f\u4e2d\u82f1\u5c0d\u7167\u8868 , Hong Kong Space Museum. Accessed on line November 23, 2010. ===Namesake=== USS Atik was a ship of the United States Navy. ==Properties== Omicron Persei A is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a spectral type B1 giant and a type B2 dwarf orbiting each other every 4.4 days. Omicron Persei lies just north of the open cluster IC 348, but is not catalogued as a member. Both IC 348 and Omicron Persei belong to the Perseus OB2 association. ==See also== *Stars and planetary systems in fiction#Omicron Persei (Atik) ==References== ==External links== *Atik Category:Perseus (constellation) Persei, Omicron Category:B-type giants Category:B-type main-sequence stars Category:Spectroscopic binaries Atik Persei, 38 1131 023180 017448 Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
