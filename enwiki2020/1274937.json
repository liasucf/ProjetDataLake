It is considered to be a trendy high-end center. The center is near downtown Salt Lake City and the UTA TRAX light-rail system. ==History== ===Description=== Trolley Square is composed of barns that were built in 1908 to house Salt Lake City's streetcars. The streetcar system was dismantled in 1945, and the barns were converted into a two-story shopping center in 1972. The center is noted for its unusual architecture consisting of winding hallways, brick and wooden floors, fountains, old-trees, and wrought-iron balconies. Prominent tenants include Weller Book Works, Pottery Barn, Cabin Fever (a popular card store), Williams Sonoma, Old Spaghetti Factory, The Desert Edge Brewery at the Pub, The Spectacle, and local boutiques. The Trolley Square water tower is covered in red and blue neon lights, and it is a prominent feature of the Salt Lake City skyline, able to be spotted from miles away at night. For many years, the tower was a weather beacon, giving the local weather forecast based on the colors of lights, with solid blue being fair weather, flashing blue being cloudy weather, solid red being rain, and flashing red being snow. The Trolley Square water tower was renovated in fall 2014. Another prominent feature of Trolley Square is the sky bridge that connects the main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged ore conveyor bridge formerly in use at the International Smelting and Refining Company facility in Tooele, Utah. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped in the form of a trolley. ===2007 shooting=== The Trolley Square shooting was a mass shooting that occurred on the evening of February 12, 2007 at the mall. A lone gunman, identified as Sulejman Talovi\u0107, killed five bystanders and wounded four others before being shot dead by several members of the Salt Lake City Police Department. Authorities were not able to determine a motive. ==Major businesses== * Alice Lane Home Collection * Ballet West Academy * Cabin Fever http://cabinfevercards.com/ * Coffee Connection * CorePower Yoga * Cosset Bath and Body * Desert Edge Pub and Brewery * The Falls Event Center * Flight Boutique * Google Fiber Space * Himalayan Artswear * Jensen Technical Services * Lanny Barnard Gallery * Millennium Dance Company * Orangetheory Fitness * Payne Anthony Creative Jewelers * Pottery Barn * Pottery Barn Kids * Precious Eyebrow Designers * Rodizio Grill * Styld' Blow Dry Bar * SPARK * Tabula Rasa * The Machine Age * The Old Spaghetti Factory * The Spectacle * Trolley Square Barbers * We Olive - The Olive Oil Experience & Wine Bar * Weller Book Works * Wells Fargo * Whole Foods Market * Williams Sonoma ===Sale and development=== Trolley Square is owned by SK Hart Management, who purchased it in May 2013. ==References== ==External links== * * The history of Trolley Square from the Salt Lake Tribune * Information on historic water tower and weather beacon, operated by KSL * ScanlanKemperBard's Trolley Square purchase press release Category:Buildings and structures in Salt Lake City Category:Shopping malls in Utah Category:Shopping malls established in 1972 Category:Tourist attractions in Salt Lake City Category:1972 establishments in Utah ",
