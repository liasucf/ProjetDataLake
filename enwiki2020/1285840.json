    "text": "Les Horribles Cernettes (, \"The Horrible CERN Girls\") was an all-female parody pop group, self-labelled \"the one and only High Energy Rock Band\", which was founded by employees of CERN and performed at CERN and other HEP-related events. Their musical style is often described as doo-wop. The initials of their name, LHC, are the same as those of the Large Hadron Collider, which was later built at CERN. Their humorous songs are freely available on their website. ==History== Les Horribles Cernettes was founded in 1990 by Michele de Gennaro, a graphic designer at CERN, whose romantic relationship with a physicist was made difficult by his numerous shifts. She attracted attention by stepping on stage during the CERN Hardronic Festival,CERN Hardronic Festival singing \"Collider\", a melancholy song about the lonely nights endured by the girlfriend of a high energy physicist. The group was subsequently formed with the help of Silvano de Gennaro, an analyst in the Computer Science department at CERN, who wrote additional songs. The fame of Les Horribles Cernettes grew and they were invited to international Physics conferences and The World '92 Expo in Seville, as well as celebrations such as Georges Charpak's Nobel Prize party. At the same time the band self-released an album titled Collider through CD Baby and received press coverage from numerous newspapers, including The New York Times, The Herald Tribune, La Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve, and the CERN Courier.Press Info: Press Features Les Horribles Cernettes The band's lineup has changed over time, but they were performing under the same name until 21 July 2012, when the band had its final performance, which was at CERN's Hardronic Festival in Switzerland.A Real Smash Hit!This is it!
