    "text": "The Neverland Express is the name for American singer Meat Loaf's live band.

However, it is known that Pat Thrall and Dave Gellis both filled the lead guitar position at various points during this period, that Martin Gerschwitz (from February\u2013July 1989) and Mark Alexander both handled the keyboard position, that Cindy Thrall was apparently a background vocalist in 1990, that Patti Russo joined around 1992, and that the core of the last certainly-known lineup (Steve Buslowe, Chuck Burgi, and Amy and Elaine Goff) were still intact, until John Miceli replaced Burgi in 1991. Adding to the confusion, the liner notes for Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell, after the standard credits for session musicians and amongst Meat Loaf's management team and other miscellaneous thank you's, list the following people as part of \"The Band\".
