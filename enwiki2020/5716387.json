Founded in 1948, the team has been a regular in the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA), the first tier of basketball in Italy. The club won one trophy in its existence, as it won the Italian Cup championship in 2008. Currently, the team plays in the Serie B, Italy's third tier league. ==History== The club was founded in 1948 as Felice Scandone Sports Society (S.S.), merging with Libertas Avellino two years later and CSI-Cestistica Irpina in 1968. After going between leagues from 1974 to 1995, the club settled in Serie B1. Two seasons later, coach Gianluca Tucci guided the team to the second division Serie A2. The turn of the millennium saw the side reach the first division Serie A, placing ninth in 2001 at the end of their debut season. The next seasons were more complicated, with finishes of 14, 15, 16 and 12th place. When coach Zare Markovski, who had been coaching the side since 2002, left in 2005, the club ended the season in 17th place and should have been relegated if not for promoted Roseto's inability to play in the Serie A. Matteo Boniciolli took over coaching duties following that season and kept Avellino away from the relegation places. The 2007\u201308 season saw Boniciolli lead Avellino to their best ever league finish of tied second-best with a 23\u201311 record and a league MVP title for Marques Green, their playoffs run was cut short in the semifinals by Lottomatica Roma (the side who had finished joint second) after they had swept Capo d'Orlando in the quarterfinals. Even better for the side, players such as Green, Devin Smith and Eric Williams led Air Avellino to its first ever title ever, the 2008 Italian Cup, in its first participation in the competition, after beating La Fortezza Bologna 73\u201367 in the final with 18 points from the game MVP Smith.

The team had a difficult period between 2011 and 2015, missing the playoffs in multiple occasions and changing the head coach almost every season. In 2016, the team led by coach Pino Sacripanti had a run of 20 victories in 26 games and reached the Italian Cup final, losing to Olimpia Milano. Avellino finished the regular season in 3rd place, and eliminated Giorgio Tesi Group Pistoia 3\u20130, reaching the league semifinals against Pallacanestro Reggiana, where the Hirpinian team lost the series in game 7 (4\u20133 overall), despite winning Game 4 by a 43 point margin. In the 2017\u201318 season, Scandone played its first European final after the team reached the Final of the FIBA Europe Cup. In the all-Italian final it lost to Reyer Venezia. In the following 2018\u201319 season, Scandone made its debut in the Basketball Champions League (BCL). The team was eliminated after the regular season. In July 2019, the LBA announced Scandone was not able to apply for a league license. The team joined the Serie B Basket, the national third level. ==Honours== Scene of a home game of Avellino versus Olimpia Milano in 2010 ===Domestic competitions=== *Italian Cup **Winners (1): 2008 ***Runner-up (1): 2016 ===European competitions=== *FIBA Europe Cup **Runners- up: 2017\u201318 ==Players== ===Current roster=== ===Notable players=== * Cristiano Grappasonni 2 seasons: '97\u2013'99 * Marco Lokar 1 season: '97\u2013'98 * Gianluca Festa 2 seasons: '99-'00, '00\u2013'01 * Michele Maggioli 2 seasons: '99\u2013'00, '03\u2013'04 * Sergio Mastroianni 3 seasons: '98\u2013'01 * Larry Middleton 3 seasons: '02\u2013'05 * Alex Righetti 1 season: '07\u2013'08 * Adam Hanga 1 seasons: '14\u2013'15 * Yegor Mescheriakov 1 season: '99\u2013'00 * Ante Grgurevi\u0107 1 season: '02\u2013'03 * Arijan Komazec 1 season: '03\u2013'04 * Spencer Dunkley 2 seasons: '98\u2013'99, '00\u2013'01 * Dan Callahan 1 season: '00\u2013'01 * Todor Ge\u010devski 1 season: '02\u2013'03 * S\u00e9rgio Ramos 1 season: '00\u2013'01 * / Moon Tae-Jong 1 season: '01\u2013'02 * Dusan Jelic Koutsopoulos 1 season: '02\u2013'03 * Gregor Hafnar 2 seasons: '00\u2013'02 * Ignacio \"Nacho\" Rodilla 1 season: '04\u2013'05 * Walter Bond 1 season: '97\u2013'98 * Brandon Brown 1 season: '05\u2013'06 * Dee Brown 1 season: '09\u2013'10 * Steve Burtt Sr. 1 season: '98\u2013'99 * Junior Cadougan 1 season: '14\u2013'15 * Jason Capel 1 season: '06\u2013'07 * Geno Carlisle 1 season: '01\u2013'02 * James Collins 1 season: '02\u2013'03 * Ramel Curry 1 season: '06\u2013'07 * Terry Dozier 1 season: '97\u2013'98 * Nate Erdmann 1 season: '00\u2013'01 * Tellis Frank 1 season: '98\u2013'99 * Tyrone Grant 1 season: '01\u2013'02 * Marques Green 1 season: '07\u2013'08 * Nate Green 2 seasons: '03\u2013'05 * Harold Jamison 2 seasons: '03\u2013'04, '06\u2013'07 * Sydney Johnson 2 seasons: '00\u2013'02 * Herbert Jones 1 season: '99\u2013'00 * Cuonzo Martin 1 season: '97\u2013'98 * Christopher Massie 2 seasons: '03\u2013'05 * Thalamus McGhee 1 season: '01\u2013'02 * Norman Nolan 1 season: '00\u2013'01 * James Nunnally 1 season: '15\u2013'16 * Jamal Robinson 1 season: '01\u2013'02 * Devin Smith 1 season: '07\u2013'08 * David Vanterpool 1 season: '02\u2013'03 * Damon Williams 1 season: '04\u2013'05 * David Young 1 season: '05\u2013'06 ==Sponsorship names== Throughout the years, due to sponsorship, the club has been known as: *Pasta Baronia Avellino: (1996\u20131997) *Cirio Avellino: (1997\u20131998) *Select Avellino: (1998\u20131999) *Nicoloro Avellino: (1999) *De Vizia Avellino: (1999\u20132002) *Air Avellino: (2002\u20132011) *Sidigas Avellino: (2011\u2013present) ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *Serie A profile Retrieved 23 August 2015 Category:1948 establishments in Italy Category:Avellino Category:Basketball teams established in 1948 Category:Basketball teams in Campania ",
