    "text": "\"Cours apr\u00e8s le temps\" (English translation: \"Run After Time\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, performed in French by Svetlana. The song deals with the focus of the modern world - with Svetlana suggesting that it is all about running after \"time\", \"money\" and \"glory\", when that is ultimately going to cause problems. As she explains, \"If I have to run all the time/What would I do with the money?\" As the song concludes, she explains that she will simply love - and if this is madness, she wants to meet other mad people. The song was performed second on the night, following Portugal's Doce with \"Bem bom\" and preceding Norway's Jahn Teigen & Anita Skorgan with \"Adieu\". At the close of voting, it had received 78 points, and finished 6th in a field of 18. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1983 Contest by Corinne Herm\u00e8s with \"Si la vie est cadeau\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1982 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"Cours apr\u00e8s le temps\" Category:Eurovision songs of Luxembourg Category:Eurovision songs of 1982 Category:1982 songs ",
