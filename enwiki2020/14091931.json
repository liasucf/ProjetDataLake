    "text": "Edmonton Composting Facility The Edmonton Composting Facility was the site of the Canadian City of Edmonton's co-composting system for processing organic waste. Co-composting involves mixing household waste with biosolids (sewage sludge), and using microorganisms to break them down into simple compost. In 2017 structural issues were identified in the roof of the aeration hall and by spring of 2019 conditions had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer safe to continue to operate the facility. The facility will be demolished and organic waste will be directed to the recently completed Anaerobic Digestion Facility. ==Size== The Edmonton Composting Facility was the largest of its kind in North America, both in volume and capacity. At 38,690 square metres (416,500 square feet) in size it was also the largest stainless steel building in North America and could process of residential waste and (dry) of biosolids each year. ==References== ==External links== *City of Edmonton - Edmonton Composting Facility Category:Buildings and structures in Edmonton Category:Industrial composting Category:Sewage treatment plants in Canada Category:Water supply and sanitation in Canada Category:Municipal government buildings in Canada Category:Steel ",
