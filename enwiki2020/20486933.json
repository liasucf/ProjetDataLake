The Andoni people refer to God as Awaji or Owaji.Biography of Engineer Tele Ikuru the Deputy Governor 2010, River State Government website Historically, the Andoni (Idoni or Indo before the colonial era had commercial contacts with European traders and with other neighbouring Ijaw clans, such as the Bonny, Okrika, Kalabari, Nkoro, Ette people of present Ikot-Abasi as well as the Okoro-utip and Mkpanak people of Ibeno. The people frequently fought wars with the Bonny and Ogoni people. The Obolo people speak Obolo as the only native language. Obolo language is a distinct language based on the original Ijaw intonation. Though it contains a few words borrowed from the language of its neighbors like Efik/Ibibio, Oron, and other Ijaw dialects, statistical provisions clearly mark Obolo out as originating from greater antiquity than its other neighbours of the region. It is one of the four language the European explorers met with in the Niger Delta area about six centuries ago. https://www.obololanguage.org/ann/ebi- obolo/obolo-%C3%ACre-ebi-owa Andoni villages and towns are situated on islands.
