He taught at lyc\u00e9es and coll\u00e8ges in Paris and the surrounding suburbs, as well as at the Prytan\u00e9e National Militaire in La Fl\u00e8che. He entered the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in 1958 and earned his doctorate at the Sorbonne University in 1964, defending a thesis called Le vieux-breton, \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'une grammaire (Old Breton, an Elementary Grammar), along with a complementary thesis, Dictionnaire des gloses en vieux-breton (Dictionary of Old Breton Glosses). In 1966, Fleuriot was named chair of Celtic studies at the University of Rennes 2 \u2013 Upper Brittany in Rennes, and at the same time as research director at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes in Paris. He contributed greatly to the growth of Breton language teaching at the university level. Fleuriot's book Les origines de la Bretagne defended a \"two wave\" model of British immigration into Brittany and argued that the legend of King Arthur arose from the life of Romano-British leader Ambrosius Aurelianus, who was known in Gaul as Riothamus. Fleuriot came into conflict with Fran\u00e7ois Falc'hun's claim that Breton was essentially native Gaulish, only influenced by the incoming British language. However, he accepted that Breton had been influenced by surviving local forms of Celtic.Glanville Price, The Celtic Connection, Colin Smythe, 1994, p. 7 Fleuriot died suddenly in Paris in 1987, aged 63, leaving much of his planned research unfinished. ==Works== A bibliography has been established by Gwennole ar Menn in Bretagne et pays celtiques, langues, histoire, civilisation (Skol, PUR, 1982), a collection of articles in honour of L\u00e9on Fleuriot. * Le vieux breton: \u00c9l\u00e9ments d'une grammaire.
