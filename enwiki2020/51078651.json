    "text": "Ryan Thomas William Boot (born 9 November 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for National League club Solihull Moors. He turned professional at Port Vale in April 2013 and played on loan at Worcester City, Norton United, Newcastle Town, and Macclesfield Town. He signed with Solihull Moors in July 2018. ==Playing career== ===Port Vale=== Boot attended the Academy at Stoke City before he was released in 2010, at which point he joined the Port Vale youth system. He signed a two-year professional contract with the club in April 2013. He had a trial at Premier League club Fulham in October 2013. He joined Conference North club Worcester City on loan in November 2013 and played four games. He was recalled from his loan in March 2014 due to an injury to Chris Neal. He played a number of friendly games in outfield positions for Vale in the 2014\u201315 pre-season as Sam Johnson and Chris Neal battled for the starting position in goal. He was loaned out to Norton United of the Northern Premier League Division One South in August 2014. The following month he was loaned out to Newcastle Town, also in the Northern Premier League Division One South. He returned on loan to Worcester City in February 2015 until the end of the 2014\u201315 season. He signed a new two-year contract with Port Vale in June 2015. On 9 September 2016, he returned to Worcester City for a third loan spell. He played two games in the following four days, keeping clean sheets on both occasions. Having kept six clean sheets in ten games for Worcester, and then went on to join National League club Macclesfield Town on loan on 11 November. He played two FA Trophy games for the \"Silkmen\". He returned to Port Vale and made his EFL League One debut for the \"Valiants\" on 20 January, in a 2\u20132 draw with Bury at Vale Park. He did not feature again in the 2016\u201317 relegation campaign, but was offered a new one-year contract by manager Michael Brown in May 2017. On 29 August, he started his first game of the 2017\u201318 season, and kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw with Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park, before saving two penalties to help Vale win the resulting penalty shoot-out. Despite this, he did not get to feature in the first-team despite injuries to Rob Lainton, Sam Hornby and emergency loan signing Kelle Roos, with new manager Neil Aspin choosing to draft in another emergency loan goalkeeper at the last minute, Dimitar Evtimov, rather than allowing Boot to reach five appearances and thereby preventing the club from making any further emergency goalkeeping loan signings. Evtimov proved to be a disappointment in his one appearance however, and Boot went on to play the following game and keep a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 victory over Oxford United on 3 November. Boot retained his first-team place following Lainton's return from injury, whilst Hornby was allowed to leave on loan. On 16 December, he impressed with what Aspin called a \"a first-class display\" in a 2\u20131 win at Carlisle United. On 24 March, he kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw at Wycombe Wanderers and his performance earned him a place on the EFL Team of the Week. However, on 2 April he dropped a routine catch to gift Crewe Alexandra the opening goal of a 2\u20132 draw before he was forced off with a foot injury; he apologised to supporters on Twitter after the game. Following an inconsistent season and the fact that both Lainton and Hornby were still under contract, Boot was released upon the expiry of his contract in May 2018. ===Solihull Moors=== On 3 July 2018, Boot was signed by former England international goalkeeper Tim Flowers, now manager of National League side Solihull Moors. He made his Moors debut on the opening day of the 2018\u201319 season, in a 2\u20131 win at Eastleigh on 4 August, and his performance earned him a place in the National League Team of the Weekend. He signed a contract extension in February 2019 after Flowers felt that Boot had proven himself a more than worthy successor to Max O'Leary. He helped the Moors to a second- place finish in the league, before they were beaten by AFC Fylde in the play- offs. He made 44 appearances in the 2019\u201320 season, which was permanently suspended on 26 March due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, with Solihull in eighth-place. ==Style of play== Boot is a goalkeeper who has been praised for his kicking ability by Port Vale manager Neil Aspin and teammate Tom Pope. ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Port Vale||2013\u201314||League One||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2014\u201315||League One||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2015\u201316||League One||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317||EFL League One||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2017\u201318||EFL League Two||22||0||3||0||0||0||3||0||28||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !23!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!3!!0!!29!!0 |- |rowspan=4|Worcester City (loan)||2013\u201314||Conference North||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- |2014\u201315||Conference North||10||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||10||0 |- |2016\u201317||National League North||7||0||3||0||0||0||0||0||10||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !21!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!24!!0 |- |Macclesfield Town (loan)||2016\u201317||National League||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Solihull Moors||2018\u201319||National League||46||0||4||0||0||0||6||0||56||0 |- |2019\u201320||National League||38||0||3||0||0||0||3||0||44||0 |- |2020\u201321||National League||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !84!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!5!!0!!100!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !128!!0!!13!!0!!0!!0!!14!!0!!155!!0 |} ==References== Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rocester Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Worcester City F.C. players Category:Norton United F.C. players Category:Newcastle Town F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Solihull Moors F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Northern Premier League players ",
