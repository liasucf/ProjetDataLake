Mosman was first incorporated in 1867 as the \"Mossmans Ward\" of the Municipality of St Leonards, which lasted until 1890 when the boroughs of Victoria, St Leonards and East St Leonards merged to form the Borough of North Sydney, with the Mosman ward renamed as the \"Mossman Ward\". Following a petition submitted by residents in 1892, on 11 April 1893 the ward's separation as the Borough of Mosman was proclaimed by Lieutenant-Governor Sir Frederick Darley. The first nine-member council was elected on 9 June 1893, with the first mayor, Richard Hayes Harnett Jr., elected on the same day. From 28 December 1906, following the passing of the Local Government Act, 1906, the council was renamed as the \"Municipality of Mosman\". With the passing of the Local Government Act, 1993, the Municipality of Mosman was legally renamed as Mosman Council and aldermen were renamed councillors. A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the Municipality of Mosman merge with adjoining councils. The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of Manly and Mosman Councils and parts of Warringah Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 153,000. The alternative, proposed by Warringah Council on 23 February 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Pittwater, Manly and Warringah councils. As a consequence of Warringah's proposal, the New South Wales Minister for Local Government Paul Toole proposed that the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman Council be merged. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. ==Heritage listings== The Mosman Council has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Balmoral, The Esplanade: Balmoral Bathers Pavilion * Georges Head, Chowder Bay Road: Georges Head Fortifications * Middle Head, Middle Head Road: Middle Head Fortifications * Mosman, Avenue Road: Mosman Bay Sewage Aqueduct * Mosman, 1 Avenue Road: Monterey * Mosman, 3a Avenue Road: The Barn, Scout Hall * Mosman, 114 Belmont Road: Alma House * Mosman, Bradleys Head Road (within Sydney Harbour NP): Bradleys Head Fortification Complex * Mosman, 34 Bullecourt Avenue: Woolley House * Mosman, 42 Cowles Road: 42 Cowles Road, Mosman * Mosman, 624-632 Military Road: Boronia House * Mosman, 28 Mistral Avenue: 28 Mistral Avenue, Mosman * Mosman, 65 Parriwi Road: Igloo House * Port Jackson, Bradleys Head: Bradleys Head Light ==Sister city== Mosman has twin town status with . ==See also== *Local government areas of New South Wales ==References== ==External links== * Mosman Council website Mosman Category:1893 establishments in Australia zh:\u6469\u58eb\u66fc\u81ea\u6cbb\u5e02 ",
