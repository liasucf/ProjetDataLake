For this portrayal, she has won four Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. ==Career== Zimmer's career began with stage work; an early television role was her portrayal of the character of Bonnie Harmon on One Life to Live in 1978. In 1979, she was tapped to replace Kathleen Turner as Nola Dancy Aldrich on The Doctors. She later appeared opposite Turner in the 1981 film Body Heat in a plot that addressed similarities in their appearance. For much of her stint, she was the show's leading lady, but left the show in July 1982 on a maternity leave, escorted off the show by her real life husband, A.C. Weary, who played Nola's newest conquest. She would return one last time later in the year for the funeral of her former mother-in-law, Mona Croft. She had a brief return to One Life to Live from February through November 1983 as Echo DiSavoy. In 1983, Zimmer was cast in the role for which she is best known, the character of Reva Shayne on the television soap opera Guiding Light. Her portrayal of Reva was a focus of the show until Zimmer left in 1990. She returned to Guiding Light in April 1995 and portrayed Reva until the show's conclusion in September 2009. While Zimmer's Reva was paired with several leading men, her work with Robert Newman (Josh) earned them the label of \"supercouple.\" Zimmer left Guiding Light in July 1990 and moved to the West Coast for five years, during which she played Jodie DeWitt Walker on Santa Barbara from 1992 to 1993. In 1995, Zimmer appeared in an episode of Seinfeld (The Diplomat's Club), as Mr. Pitt's attorney, who suspected Elaine and Jerry were trying to kill Mr. Pitt. In 2010, Zimmer returned to the role of Echo on One Life to Live. Zimmer was featured in a story along with former Guiding Light co-star Jerry verDorn (Clint Buchanan), Robin Strasser (Dorian Cramer) and Erika Slezak (Viki Lord). Zimmer has also appeared in several episodic television programs, including Designing Women, MacGyver, Models, Inc., and Babylon 5 (episode \"And Now For a Word\", year 1995). She also appeared in several made-for-television movies. Zimmer has starred in a number of theater roles, including several at Augusta's Barn Theatre.http://www.kimzimmer.net/Pages/UpcomingAppearingLive.html In 2011, it was announced that Zimmer would be cast in the Off-Broadway international hit Love, Loss, and What I Wore.
