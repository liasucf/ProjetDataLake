    "text": "Johanna Narten (5 October 1930 \u2013 15 July 2019), was a German Indo-Europeanist and linguist who discovered the reconstructed morphological category in Proto- Indo-European now known as the Narten present. She was Professor of Indo- European and Indo-Iranian Linguistics at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg and a member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften. ==Scholarship== Narten studied classical philology at the University of Saarland, moving to the University of Erlangen in 1955 to work on Indo- European linguistics, in particular Indo-Iranian linguistics\u2014especially Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan\u2014with Karl Hoffmann, under whose supervision she produced a dissertation, \"Die sigmatische Aoriste im Veda\" [The Sigmatic Aorists in the Veda] (1964), which has been described as 'a brilliant masterwork'. Later she published \"Zum 'proterodynamischen' Wurzelpr\u00e4sens\" [On the Proterodynamic Root-Present] (1968), in which she showed the existence of a class of verbs that feature a lengthened e-grade in the present i.e. the Narten present. In 1995, she became the first woman admitted as a full member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities). A Festschrift was published in 2000 to honour her 70th birthday: Anusantatyai: Festschrift f\u00fcr Johanna Narten zum 70. Geburtstag. ==Selected publications== * * * * * ==References== == External links == *Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities profile * Google Books * Google Scholar Category:Women linguists Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Linguists of Indo-European languages Category:German women academics Category:Historical linguists Category:Saarland University alumni Category:Erlangen University alumni ",
