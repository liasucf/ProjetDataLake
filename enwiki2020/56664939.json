    "text": "Boston City Council elections were held on November 3, 1987. Eleven seats (seven district representatives and four at-large members) were contested in the general election, as the incumbents in districts 3 and 6 were unopposed. Seven seats (the four at-large members, and districts 1, 8, and 9) had also been contested in the preliminary election held on September 22, 1987. ==At- large== Councillors Dapper O'Neil, Christopher A. Iannella, and Michael J. McCormack were re-elected. Councillor Joseph M. Tierney did not seek re- election, as he ran for Mayor of Boston; he was defeated by incumbent Raymond Flynn in the general election. Rosaria Salerno won the final at-large seat. {| class=wikitable !colspan=1 rowspan=2 |Candidates !colspan=2 |Preliminary Election !colspan=2 |General Election |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- | Dapper O'Neil | align=\"right\" | 29,052 | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | 47,817 | align=\"right\" | |- | Christopher A.
