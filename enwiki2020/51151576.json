It was founded in 1933 as a rugby union club, and subsequently extended its scope to cricket, hockey, tennis and softball. == History == Old Towcestrians Rugby Club was founded in 1933 by \"old boys\" of Towcester Grammar School (now Sponne School Technology College). In the following summer Old Towcestrians Cricket Club was formed and included many members from the rugby club in the market town of Towcester. The two clubs operated independently until the mid-1960s with rugby being played in the centre of Towcester whilst cricket used the school pitch, pavilion and canteen for teas. In 1967 negotiations were begun with Hesketh Estates regarding the availability of land and the rugby and cricket committees began work on the constitution for a combined \u2018open\u2019 club. In February 1968 the joint committees agreed a 30-year lease with Hesketh Estates for 9 acres of land ground off the Greens Norton Road. In March of the same year a special meeting approved the amalgamation of the two clubs into Towcestrians Rugby and Cricket Club under the chairmanship of Colin Waklelin. Although Old Towcestrians Tennis Club originally started in 1925 they joined the new club later in the summer of 1968. In August 1969 planning approval was granted for the development of the new facilities and construction work begun on the club house and ground. One year later, in August 1970, the new ground was officially opened. The facilities were testament to the huge voluntary effort by club members. The Hockey club joined in 1982 and played on a grass pitch till new Hockey rules forced them to play on artificial pitches in Northampton. Towcestrians Softball started in 2014 as Towcester Tigers playing at Towcestrians. ==Sports== ===Rugby=== ====Senior Rugby==== Towcestrians senior rugby consists of Towcestrians 1st XV, 2nds and 3rds with a thriving Mini and Junior Section.
