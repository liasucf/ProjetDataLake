    "text": "Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird is an Irish singer and record producer. He sings in the traditional sean-n\u00f3s style. He was a member of the Afro Celt Sound System and is a member of the Irish-American supergroup The Gloaming. He has recorded several solo albums for Real World Records. He appeared in the 2015 film Brooklyn singing an a cappella version of the Irish song \"Casadh an tSugain\". ==Early life== \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird was born and raised in C\u00fail Aodha in the West Cork Gaeltacht, a primarily Irish-speaking region. His father was a teacher and his mother and grandmother were singers in the traditional sean-n\u00f3s style. Elizabeth Cronin, whose singing was recorded by Alan Lomax, was \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird's great-aunt. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird was one of twelve children in his family. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird first sang publicly at the age of five, and made his first radio broadcast at seven. At the age of twelve he recorded the traditional song \"Aisling Gheal\" for Gael Linn Records. He joined Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada's male voice choir C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha as a child and sang in the choir, directed after Sean \u00d3 Riada's death by his son Peadar, until he was in his early twenties. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird earned a Bachelor of Education degree at Carysfort College in Dublin and was employed as a primary school teacher for seven years before making a career as a singer. ==Musical career== \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird collaborated with Tony MacMahon and Noel Hill on Aisling\u00ed Ceoil \u2013 Music of Dreams, a live album of traditional Irish music recorded in Dublin in 1993 and released in 1994 by Gael Linn. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird performed three songs in sean-n\u00f3s style with piano accompaniment. Seeking a way to combine his role as a \"culture-bearing\" traditional singer with musical creativity in order to \"make new music\", \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird was drawn to ambient music for its \"capacity to accept ornate styles of music as part of its matrix\". He has said that hearing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan singing on Peter Gabriel's album Passion was a \"light bulb moment\" which made him think that sean-n\u00f3s could also \"inhabit this ambient soundscape\". \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird wrote to Peter Gabriel asking for a chance to record on Gabriel's Real World Records. Gabriel invited him to a \"recording week\" at his studio, which led to his membership in the Afro Celt Sound System. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird joined the session in July 1995 at which Volume 1: Sound Magic was recorded. He appeared on the group's five subsequent studio recordings. He also sings on the Peter Gabriel album OVO. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird has released three solo albums on the Real World Records label. The Seven Steps to Mercy (1997) was produced by Michael Brook. The production incorporated sampled nature sounds \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird had recorded himself. The album includes a recording of the fourteen-year old \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird singing \"Aisling Gheal\" in 1978. It was followed in 2005 by Invisible Fields, which \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird produced himself, and in 2011 by Foxlight, which was produced by Leo Abrahams. His 2000 album I Could Read the Sky, also on Real World Records, is the soundtrack to the 1999 film of the same name. He sings on \u00c1illeacht, a 2005 album by P\u00e1draig\u00edn N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in. Several composers, including Gavin Bryars and Donnacha Dennehy, have written works for \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird. Bryars first wrote a song arrangement for voice and viols that appeared on the 2005 album Invisible Fields. He went on to write a major work, An\u00e1il D\u00e9 (The Breath of God) for \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird and members of the Crash Ensemble. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird suggested the title and the texts for the piece, which is based on a collection of Irish prayers and poems. It was performed for the first time in Dublin in November 2008. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird collaborated with Donnacha Dennehy during Dennehy's research for and composition of Gr\u00e1 agus B\u00e1s, a work that \"incorporates traditional sean nos singing within a contemporary music idiom\". Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin, the work was first performed in Dublin in February 2007 by \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird and the Crash Ensemble with Alan Pierson conducting. It had its United States premiere at the Merkin Concert Hall in New York City in March 2007, in what the New York Times called a \"powerful account\" of a \"magnificently energetic, wildly cacophonous vocal work\". \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird sang the piece at Carnegie Hall in May 2013 in a concert of Dennehy's music with the Crash Ensemble and Dawn Upshaw. Nonesuch Records released a CD recording entitled Gr\u00e1 Agus B\u00e1s containing this and other works by Dennehy in May 2011. Along with fiddlers Martin Hayes and Caoimh\u00edn \u00d3 Raghallaigh, guitarist Dennis Cahill, and pianist Doveman, \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird is a member of The Gloaming, an Irish-American supergroup whose self-titled first album was released in 2014, winning the Meteor Choice Music Prize for Irish album of the year. From September 2016 \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird appeared in The Hunger, an opera by Donnacha Dennehy about the Great Famine. ==Other work== In 2013 University College Cork appointed \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird the School of Music and Theatre's first Traditional Artist in Residence. In that capacity he gave lectures and taught sean-n\u00f3s singing, as well as performing. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird appears in the 2015 film Brooklyn. He has said that he was reluctant to take the role \"because I'm not an actor\" but that he decided to accept when he learned that Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, the author of the novel on which the film was based, had asked the film's director to ask him. \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird plays Frankie Doran, a poor workingman who sings the traditional song \"Casadh an tS\u00fag\u00e1in\" (Twisting the Rope) during Christmas dinner at a soup kitchen. In May 2015 \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird hosted a five-part radio documentary series about singing entitled Vocal Chords, which drew on \"personal experience, academic contributions and a global cast of vocalists\" including Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor and Christy Moore. ==Personal life== \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird earned a Master of Arts degree in ethnomusicology from the University of Limerick in 2003. He lives in Inistioge in County Kilkenny with his wife Eimear and their three children. ==Discography== ===Solo albums=== * The Seven Steps To Mercy, September 1997 * I Could Read the Sky (soundtrack), June 2000 * Invisible Fields, August 2005 * Foxlight, September 2011 ===Albums With The Afro Celt Sound System=== * Volume 1: Sound Magic (1996) * Volume 2: Release (1999) * Volume 3: Further in Time (2001) * Seed (2003) * Pod (Remix album) (2004) * Volume 5: Anatomic (2005) * Capture: 1995\u20132010 (2010) (compilation) ===Other albums=== *Tony MacMahon, Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird & Noel Hill \u2013 Aislingi Ceoil / Music Of Dreams (Gael Linn, 1994) *Donnacha Dennehy \u2013 Gr\u00e1 Agus B\u00e1s (Nonesuch Records, 2011) *Cork Gamelan Ensemble \u2013 The Three Forges (Diatribe Records, 2015) *P\u00e1draig\u00edn N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in \u2013 \u00c1illeacht (2005) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird at Real World Records *Vocal Chords with Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird *The Gloaming at Real World Records Category:Real World Records artists Category:Irish-language singers Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:Afro Celt Sound System members Category:The Gloaming members ",
