Hence, the name of the town was changed to Ahmedgarh in honour of Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan. == Geography == The city lies about 18 km north of Malerkotla on the Sangrur-Ludhiana road. It is 50 km from Sangrur, which is the district headquarters, 26 km from Ludhiana, and 98 km from Chandigarh. == Transport == It has a railway station on the Ludhiana-Jakhal railway line. == Design == Ahmedgarh is an example of pre- independence town planning. It was planned as a market town on the model of Lyallpur (Faisalabad) in Pakistan. The planning consisted of a cross-axis of two main avenues along which auctioning, vending and storage of agricultural and agriculture-related goods took place. The four quadrants thus constituted the residential quarters for the people. The town was enclosed by a fasil, a brick arched wall with only four manned entry points for security. Further, each of the four mohallas could be accessed via one of the two gated structures from the main avenues. At the intersection of the two avenues is a public well. The intersection is now known as the Gandhi chowk. The plots abutting the market avenues were 16 feet wide and ranged from 150 to 240 feet in length. Each plot was constructed with a facade featuring three Mughal arches, forming a colonnade on both sides of the avenues. Sardar Bahadur Singh Dhaliwal's descendants reside in Ahmedgharh. At a later stage, the avenues were split in two, with shops along the median, hence forming the 8 streets intersecting at Gandhi Chowk. The wide avenues have been encroached upon from both sides, and only a few buildings retain the arched facade, often found behind several rooms from the entrance to the building. == Economy == Ahmedgarh is the only city in India that manufactures trowels and harrow for cultivation and then transports it to other states and places. Ahmedgarh is an important agricultural market. The main crops brought to this market are paddy, wheat and cotton. Close to two industrial towns of Malerkotla and Ludhiana, a number of small-scale industries operate in and around this town. The city is also famous for agricultural implements such as diggers, plows, and sickles. Ahmedgarh became one of India's dry ports. ==Demographics== India census, Ahmedgarh had a population of 28,007. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%.
