    "text": "June's Journey is a hidden object game developed by Berlin-based Wooga. It was launched in March 2017 on the Facebook social media platform and on 5 September on iPad.http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/09/09/pearls-peril- wooga-brings-facebook-hidden-object-game-to-ipad/ June's Journey is Wooga's seventh game. Wooga also released a soundtrack to the game. ==Gameplay== June's Journey is a hidden object (sometimes known as hidden picture) game. Players are given a list of items to find within a static scene. They then receive points for each item found, and score multipliers for completing the task quickly. Players can also use a hint feature to highlight items that they find difficult to see. In between many of the levels, puzzle levels require players to find and assemble specific items linked closely to the story. June's Journey also has an isometric building metagame, in which players must construct buildings on an island. Some items offer rewards, such as \u2018prestige\u2019, which is used to unlock further chapters in the game. Players must also expand their island by exploring, which requires three in-game currencies, namely coins, diamonds and compasses.http://www.quickgamer.net The initial lead team who created the game consisted of Sebastian Nu\u00dfbaum (VP New Games Wooga), Georg Baumgarte (Product Lead), Mikita Fedarenka (Art Lead), Dave Cross (Design Lead), Patrick Kulling (Engineering Lead), Rebecca Harwick (Lead Writer). ==Narrative== June's Journey is set in the late 1920s, and opens with the titular adventurer, June Parker, receiving terrible news from New York: her sister Clare seems to have been murdered by her husband, Harry, who killed himself too.http://www.gamezebo.com/games/pearls-peril/review Shocked, she goes back to her childhood home, Orchid Island, to take care of Virginia, her niece and the daughter of Clare and Harry. She is received by Mr. and Mrs. Talbot, the groundskeeper and housekeeper of Orchid Island and its estate. June, a former nurse in the recently ended First World War, uses her intellect, training, and bravery to investigate crimes. June discovers that Virginia has stolen a photograph of the crime scene made by the police, and doubts that Harry would ever kill Clare or commit suicide. She decides to investigate and uncover the truth. ==Monetization== June's Journey is a free- to-play game, using the freemium model of monetization. Players can use real- life money to buy in-game coins and diamonds. These can then be used to buy extra energy, which is required to play the scenes, and decorations, which are required to unlock new scenes. ==Reception== Reviews for June's Journey are generally mixed, with many reviewers praising its high production values, and disapproving of its freemium monetization structure. ==References== ==External links== Category:Facebook games Category:IOS games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Hidden object games Category:2017 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Video games developed in Germany ",
