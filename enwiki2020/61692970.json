    "text": "The Helsinki Grand Prix (, World Games in English) was an annual one-day outdoor track and field meeting held at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, Finland. Established in 1959, it was originally organised by a local athletics club, Helsingin Kisa-Veikot (HKV). It continued in this format, with Apu magazine a key sponsor, for nearly three decades. In 1987, HKV came to an agreement where the Finnish Amateur Athletic Association took on the operating costs of the competition. The Finnish Association ceased this arrangement in 1992, causing the cancellation of the 1993 meeting due to financial difficulties. Following the successful hosting the 1995 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, the meeting was rebooted and incorporated into the annual IAAF Grand Prix series upon that competition's founding in 1998.1998 Grand Prix Standings.

During this period it had title sponsors and was known as the Ericsson Grand Prix (1998\u20132000), Asics Grand Prix (2001\u20132004) and GE Money Grand Prix (2005\u20132006).
