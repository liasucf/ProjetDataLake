    "text": "Jordan Xavier Williams (born November 23, 1994) is a professional Canadian football linebacker. He was drafted first overall in the 2020 CFL Draft by the BC Lions who currently own his playing rights in the Canadian Football League (CFL). ==High school career== Because his mother was in the military, Williams moved around frequently in his youth, including Baltimore and Hawaii. Williams was a three-year letterwinner at Jack Britt High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He was twice an All-Mid-South 4-A Conference selection. However, his collegiate options were limited due to academic issues. ==College career== Williams joined East Carolina as a preferred walk-on after transferring from Shaw University as a freshman. He earned a scholarship and played nine games on special teams in the 2014 season as a redshirt freshman. Williams finished second in tackles with 81 as a sophomore. As a junior, he led the team in tackles with 77. Williams finished second on the team in tackles with 89 as a senior in 2017, including three for a loss and a forced fumble. In his career, Williams started 25 of 45 games and posted 252 tackles (123 solo), 13.0 tackles for loss, 3.0 sacks, two forced fumbles, three pass breakups and an interception. Williams also contributed 11 double-digit tackle performances. He earned a bachelor's degree from ECU in Health & Communications minor. ==Professional career== Williams received an invite to the San Francisco 49ers Rookie Mini-Camp in 2018 but did not make the team. He continued to train and received Canadian citizenship. He nearly joined the Ottawa Redblacks out of training camp in 2019, but was convinced to enter the CFL Draft since his mother was Canadian. Williams was drafted first overall in the 2020 CFL Draft by the BC Lions. The number one pick was originally held by the Ottawa Redblacks, who dealt the pick the Calgary Stampeders, who subsequently traded the pick to the Lions on draft day. ==References== ==External links== * BC Lions bio * East Carolina Pirates bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian football linebackers Category:American players of Canadian football Category:American football linebackers Category:East Carolina Pirates football players Category:Players of American football from North Carolina Category:People from Fayetteville, North Carolina Category:BC Lions players Category:American people of Canadian descent ",
