Installed first on the Naturaliste during this voyage of scientific exploration, he was the first to see and draw the plan of Faure Island, an island in Shark Bay on the Western Australian coast to which the expedition gave his name. He boarded the G\u00e9ographe at Port Jackson on 3 November 1802. On 15 d\u00e9cembre 1803, at his request, he left the end of the expedition when it stopped at \u00eele de France on its return. Pierre Faure was a corresponding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des observateurs de l'homme. == Bibliography == *Nicolas Baudin, Mon voyage aux Terres australes, journal personnel du commandant Baudin, imprimerie nationale, 2000 *Dany Br\u00e9elle, Les G\u00e9ographes de l'exp\u00e9dition Baudin et la reconnaissance des c\u00f4tes australes, in (\u00e9d) Port\u00e9s par l'air du temps: les voyages du capitaine Baudin, num\u00e9ro sp\u00e9cial d'\"\u00c9tudes du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle\", XXXVIII, 2010, (p. 213\u2013223) ==References== Category:French geographers Category:1777 births Category:People from Nantes Category:1855 deaths ",
