    "text": "Home Before Dark is the twenty-seventh studio album by American singer- songwriter Neil Diamond. Released on May 5, 2008; it was the artist's second album for American Recordings. Home Before Dark received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release and topped the national albums charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. It has since been accredited with album certifications in several regions. In May 2008, at the age of 67, Neil Diamond was the oldest performer to have a number one record. This mark was previously held by Bob Dylan in 2006 with his Modern Times album, released when he was 65. However, Bob Dylan's 2009 album, Together Through Life, earned Dylan that position again since Dylan released his most recent work at 67 years and 11 months unlike Diamond releasing Home Before Dark at 67 years and 3 months. The album is Diamond's second to be produced by Rick Rubin, a producer of hip-hop and heavy metal music, who had discovered a talent for re-invigorating the careers of musicians when he produced Aerosmith and a string of albums with Johnny Cash. After Cash's death, Diamond became the next artist to find his career given a shot in the arm, via Rubin's production on his 2005 album 12 Songs. The album consists of original works and some remakes, and was mixed by Dana Nielsen. The orchestral parts were arranged and conducted by David CampbellAllMusic 'Home Before Dark' album creditsDiscogs 'Home Before Dark' == Track listing == All songs were written by Neil Diamond, except where noted. # \"If I Don't See You Again\" \u2013 7:13 # \"Pretty Amazing Grace\" \u2013 4:53 # \"Don't Go There\" \u2013 6:04 # \"Another Day (That Time Forgot)\" (feat.
