During his reign, Assyria became a sporadic vassal of Mitanni. After a 15-year rule, he was overthrown by his brother Enlil-Nasir II. A letter survives from him congratulating Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III on his victories in Palestine and Syria. ==References== Category:1420 BC deaths Category:15th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:Year of birth unknown Category:15th-century BC rulers ",
