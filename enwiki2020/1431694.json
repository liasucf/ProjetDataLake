    "text": "Elections in the Cook Islands gives information on election and election results in the Cook Islands. The Cook Islands elects a legislature on a national level. The Parliament of the Cook Islands has 24 members, elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies. The Cook Islands has a two- party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties and it is extremely difficult for any other party to achieve electoral success. An election was held on 14 June 2018. The Cook Islands Party lost its majority, winning only 10 of 24 seats, but Prime Minister Henry Puna was able to put together a coalition by offering cabinet positions to the One Cook Islands Movement's George Angene and independents Robert Tapaitau and Rose Toki-Brown. ==Latest election== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right |- |align=center colspan=10|File: Parlement Iles Cook 2018.svg |- !colspan=2|Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |bgcolor=#008000| ||align=left|Cook Islands Party||3,654||42.30||10||\u20133 |- |bgcolor=#1E90FF| ||align=left|Democratic Party||3,620||41.91||11||+2 |- |bgcolor=#20B2AA| ||align=left|One Cook Islands Movement||934||10.81||1||\u20131 |- | ||align=left|Titikaveka Oire||97||1.12||0||0 |- | ||align=left|Alternative Must Ravenga Openga||7||0.08||0||New |- |bgcolor=#DDDDDD| ||align=left|Independents||326||3.77||2||+2 |- |align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes|| ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||8,638||100||24||0 |- |align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout|| || ||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=6|Source: |} ==By- elections== {| class=wikitable !Election !Date !Reason !colspan=2|Winner |- |1963 European by-election|| || || ||Dick Rapley |- |1963 Mauke by-election|| || || ||Julian Dashwood |- |1963 Rarotonga by-election|| ||Teupoko'ina Morgan moved to New Zealand|| ||David Marama Hosking |- |1965 Te-Ao-O-Tonga by- election |July 1965 |Resignation of Marguerite Story |bgcolor=| ||Albert Henry (CIP) |- |1966 Mauke by-election | |Resignation of Julian Dashwood |bgcolor=| ||Tupui Henry (CIP) |- |1977 Takitumu by-election||December 1977||Death of Tiakana Numanga||bgcolor=| ||Iaveta Short (DP) |- |1978 Mitiaro by-election|| ||Annulment of the general election result|| || |- |1991 Murienua by-election | | |bgcolor=| || Tom Marsters (CIP) |- |1994 Ivirua by-election |December 1994 | |bgcolor=| ||Jim Marurai (DAP) |- |1996 Nikao\u2013Panama by-election |July 1996 | |bgcolor=| ||Ngamau Munokoa (DP) |- |1999 Pukapuka-Nassau by-election |29 September 1999 | Invalidation of election results | ||None |- |2000 Pukapuka-Nassau by-election |28 September 2000 | Invalidation of 1999 Pukapuka-Nassau by-election. | ||Tiaki Wuatai (NAP) |- |2002 Penrhyn by- election |June 2002 | Disqualification of Tepure Tapaitau |bgcolor=| ||Wilkie Rasmussen (CIP) |- |2003 Rua\u2019au by-election |14 August 2003 | Death of Maria Heather |bgcolor=| ||Geoffrey Heather (DP) |- |2003 Arutanga by-election |20 November 2003 | Resignation of Teina Bishop |bgcolor=| ||Teina Bishop (Independent) |- |2005 Manihiki by-election |8 February 2005 | Resignation of Robert Woonton |bgcolor=| || Henry Puna (CIP) |- |2006 Teenui-Mapumai by- election |8 June 2006 | Retirement of Upoko Simpson |bgcolor=| ||Norman George (Independent) |- |2006 Matavera by-election |19 July 2006 |Conviction of Vaevae Pare for fraud |bgcolor=| || Kiriau Turepu (CIP) |- |2006 Akaoa by- election |29 November 2006 |Previous election produced tied result |bgcolor=| || Teariki Heather (CIP) |- |2007 Titikaveka by-election |7 February 2007 |Election of Robert Wigmore declared invalid |bgcolor=| ||Robert Wigmore (DP) |- |2009 Tamarua by-election |3 February 2009 |Death of Mii Parima |bgcolor=| ||Pukeiti Pukeiti (CIP) |- |2011 Pukapuka by-election |7 June 2011 |Election of Tekii Lazaro declared invalid |bgcolor=| ||Tekii Lazaro (CIP) |- |2012 Titikaveka by-election |21 June 2012 |Death of Robert Wigmore |bgcolor=| || Selina Napa (DP) |- |2013 Tamarua by-election |29 January 2013 |Death of Pukeiti Pukeiti |bgcolor=| ||Tetangi Matapo (DP) |- |2013 Murienua by-election |19 September 2013 |Resignation of Tom Marsters |bgcolor=| || Kaota Tuariki (CIP) |- |2014 Murienua by-election |19 February 2014 |Resignation of Kaota Tuariki |bgcolor=| ||James Beer (DP) |- |2014 Mitiaro by-election |11 November 2014 |Draw in the 2014 general election |bgcolor=#EEEEEE| ||Results not counted due to court order. |- |2015 Vaipae-Tautu by-election |31 March 2015 |2014 election result voided |bgcolor=| || Moana Ioane (CIP) |- |2016 Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara by-election |13 October 2016 | Teina Bishop convicted of corruption |bgcolor=| || Pumati Israela (OCI) |- |2017 Avatiu\u2013Ruatonga\u2013Palmerston by-election |17 May 2017 |Resignation of Albert Nicholas |bgcolor=| ||Albert Nicholas (CIP) |- |2017 Ivirua by-election |17 August 2017 | Resignation of Jim Marurai | bgcolor=| ||Tony Armstrong |- |2019 Ivirua by-election |21 January 2019 | Death of Tony Armstrong | bgcolor=| ||Agnes Armstrong |- |2019 March Tengatangi-Areora-Ngatiarua by-election |18 March 2019 | Defection of Te-Hani Brown from the Democratic Party |bgcolor=| ||Te-Hani Brown |- |2019 November Tengatangi-Areora-Ngatiarua by-election |14 November 2019 | Resignation of Te-Hani Brown |bgcolor=| ||Te-Hani Brown |} ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system ==References== ",
