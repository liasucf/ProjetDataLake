It lies approximately north of Pszczyna and south of the regional capital Katowice. The village has a population of 4,702. ==History== The village was established in the 15th century. During the political upheaval caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian magnates of the Thurz\u00f3 family, forming the Pless state country. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as Kobyer. The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia, including the village. ==References== ;Notes Category:Villages in Pszczyna County ",
