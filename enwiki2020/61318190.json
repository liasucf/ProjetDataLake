    "text": "Portrait of Clemenceau is an 1872 painting by \u00c9douard Manet of the French statesman Georges Clemenceau in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Manet's youngest brother Gustave was a municipal councillor in Paris and it may have been through his mediation that Manet met Clemenceau. Alternatively, the pair may have met at the home of Paul Meurice or \u00c9mile Zola. The portrait was produced at the tribune of the Jardin du Luxembourg, where the city council was sitting; it is sometimes entitled Portrait of Clemenceau at the Tribune. Less realist than the later work of the same title, it stayed in the artist's studio for a long period. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S.
