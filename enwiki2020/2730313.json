He became a successful businessman, at first in the linen trade and then in shipbuilding.

His trip journals and accounts of the natural history of the American plains and Native Americans are now in the Public Records Office in Belfast. His collection of North American Indian artefacts is in the Ulster Museum. Each year, when business and family permitted, Workman spent lengthy periods in foreign lands, collecting insects, especially butterflies and spiders. His ethnographic collections are in the Ulster Museum in Belfast. His most significant trips were * 1881 - Brazil * 1883 - India, Burma, Singapore, China and the Philippines * 1888 - Singapore and Ceylon * 1890 - Singapore and Java * 1892 - Ceylon, Singapore and India ==Societies== Workman was, as well as being actively involved in the civic administration of Belfast, the Honorary Librarian of the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society becoming president in 1898. He died in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A in 1900, having caught a chill en route from Vancouver following a trip to the Rocky Mountains. ==Achievements== Aside from his work on spiders, especially those of the Far East, Workman was a considerable lepidopterist collecting for Adalbert Seitz and Lionel Walter Rothschild among others. Some of his specimens are figured and noted without attribution in Seitz' monumental Macrolepidoptera of the World. A systematic description of the hitherto known Macrolepidoptera, edited in collaboration with well-known specialists published in Stuttgart by Alfred Kermen. ==Contacts== *Octavius Pickard- Cambridge (1828\u20131917) England *Theodore Savory ( ) England *Tord Tamerlan Teodor Thorell (1830\u20131901) Sweden *Adalbert Seitz (1860\u20131938) Germany *Lionel Walter Rothschild ( (1868\u20131937) England ==Spiders named after Workman== Phidippus workmania a species named for Workman *Damarchus workmanii Thorell *Theridium workmanii Thorell *Phidippus workmanii Peckham & Peckham *Goleta workmanii Peckham & Peckham ==Published work== *1880 Irish Spiders in The Entomologist *1896 Malaysian Spiders Volume 1 Privately published in Belfast. ==Collections== *Campbell College, Belfast: Lepidoptera *Ulster Museum, Belfast: Lepidoptera *National Museum of Ireland, Dublin Irish spiders: Lepidoptera *Natural History Museum, London World spiders: Lepidoptera ==Correspondence== Workman's correspondence, diaries etc. are in the Public records Office Belfast ==References== *Irish Naturalist 9:241 *Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society Centennial Volume 1821-1891 144pp., portrait.
