Its screen recording software can capture and embed HD video, screen recordings, GIFs, screencasts, screenshots and marked up images, which can then be used in software development, design, customer success, support, sales, and marketing. It is used by an estimated 3 million people. ==History== CloudApp was initially launched in 2010 as a project by Max Schoening (former lead designer at Heroku). Originally, it enabled knowledge workers to instantly share screenshots and file assets as short links that didn\u2019t require a download to view. The project then moved towards visual collaboration to allow sharing screenshots, gifs, annotations, and screen recordings. The first iteration included a downloadable Mac application and accompanying free service. CloudApp was later acquired by Aluminum.io and Xenon Ventures in January 2014, where Tyler Koblasa became General Manager and CEO. In June 2016, Koblasa secured US $2 million in a funding round led by Tikhon Bernstam, founder of Scribd and Parse, and Kyle York (CSO Dyn), which enabled him to acquire the intellectual property from Aluminum.io, invest in the platform and add founding team member Scott Smith to help scale the business. In July 2016, CloudApp acquired the intellectual property for app Annotate, a popular Mac and iOS annotation app, from David Cancel and Elias Torres, of Boston-based Drift. In October 2019 it added collections and favorites to its platforms to allow teams and enterprises to share collections of videos, screenshots, and GIFs created with CloudApp. In January 2020 it launched a new app to cover iPhones and iPads. In March 2020, ot launched \u2018Instant Video\u2019, a new video streaming service, that uploads videos while the user captures them to make sharing instantaneous. CloudApp has been listed five quarters in a row on G2's top consumer reviewed products lists. ==See also== *Comparison of screencasting software ==References== ==External links== * New Data During Covid-19 Shows Work Increase during the Morning Commute and After Hours * getcloudapp.com Category:Companies based in California Category:Technology companies of the United States Category:Cloud computing ",
