    "text": "The Honolulu Police Commission consists of seven Police Commissioners (members). The members are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council. They each serve staggered terms of five years, and they serve until their successors have been appointed and qualified. All members volunteer their services and receive no compensation. A chair and vice-chair are elected annually by the commissioners.http://www.honolulupd.org/downloads/HPC_Brochure.pdf In January 2017, the Honolulu Police Commission approved a $250,000 payout deal for controversial Police Chief Louis Kealoha. He will have to pay back the money if he's convicted in a pending federal investigation.http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/34289106/honolulu-police- commission-to-vote-on-kealohas-retirement-deal ==References== Category:Police oversight organizations Category:Government watchdog groups in the United States ",
