He served in the Cortes in two separate strings: during the Second Republic in 1936 and during Francoism in 1954-1958. In 1938-1939 he was a member of Junta Pol\u00edtica of Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista, and in 1954-1958 he was a member of FET's Consejo Nacional. In 1942-1944 he headed the regional Carlist Navarrese organization. Politically he sided with the Carlist branch which opted for conciliatory policy towards the Franco regime and leaned towards a monarchist dynastical alliance. ==Family and youth== Viana The name of Elizalde is of Basque-Navarrese origin, first recorded in the 16th century.Maria de Aberruza entry, [in:] WikiTree service, available here During the early modern period some of its representatives earned recognition as civil servants, religious or merchants, also overseas, yet Jes\u00fas\u2019 ancestors can be traced back only to the early 18th century.along the patriline the great-great-great grandfather of Jes\u00fas was Antonio Elizalde, married to Mar\u00eda Ana Mart\u00ednez de Vidaurre, Antonio Elizalde entry, [in:] Geneaordonez service, available here His great-great grandfather Jos\u00e9 Elizalde Mart\u00ednez de Vidaurre was related to Viana,in 1733 he married Mar\u00eda Ger\u00f3nima Alonso Perez del Notario; both were from Viana, Joseph Elizalde Martinez de Vidaurre, [in:] Geneaordonez service, available here noted as \u201cmaestro ensamblador\u201d;Juan Cruz Labeaga Mendiola, Viana celebra los acontecimientos de la monarqu\u00eda, [in:] Cuadernos de etnolog\u00eda y etnograf\u00eda de Navarra 39/82 (2007), p. 80 over time the family grew to prosperity, though little is known of his great-grandfather Juan Elizalde Alonsoin 1805 he married Jacoba Josefa Navarro Sainz de Urbina; both were from Viana, Juan Elizalde Alonso entry, [in:] Geneaordonez service, available here and grandfather Lino Mar\u00eda Elizalde Navarro.in 1853 he married Casilda Sabando Zalduendo, also from Viana, Lino Maria Elizalde Alonso, [in:] Geneaordonez service, available here His father, Fructuoso Elizalde Sabando (1858-1944),ABC 14.01.44, available here l was among the most prestigious Viana personalities, listed as \u201crico propietario\u201d.El Eco de Navarra 28.11.97, available here In the 1890s he entered the Viana ayuntamiento as segundo alcaldeLa Rioja 22.02.90, available here and between 1893Elizalde entry, [in:] HeraldicaDeViana service, available here and 1903La Rioja 26.11.03, available here; in 1904 he served in the ayuntamiento, but not as a mayor, La Rioja 03.01.04, available here he served as mayor of the town.

Rather scarce evidence related to Elizalde's leadership demonstrates that he preferred a firm stand towards the regime; in 1942 he suggested that Carlists leave all official structures in protest over the Bego\u00f1a incident;Villanueva Mart\u00ednez 2003, pp. 105-106 in 1943 he co-signed so-called Reclamaci\u00f3n del Poder, an address which demanded instauration of Traditionalist monarchy;C\u00e9sar Alcal\u00e1, D.

Though a trustee of Fal Conde,in 1943 Elizalde represented Fal (unable to attend due to his home arrest) on a wedding, ABC 29.10.43, available here already in 1943 he was in touch with Rodezno about negotiations with the Alfonsist claimant Don Juan.Manuel Santa Cruz [Alberto Ruiz de Galarreta], Apuntes y documentos para la Historia del Tradicionalismo Espa\u00f1ol, vol. 4-5, Sevilla 1942, pp. 133, 145 In 1944 the entire Junta Regional demanded from the regent Don Javier that he calls for a grand Carlist assembly, which in turn would terminate the regency and elect a new king. As Fal Conde and Don Javier rejected the plan, in November 1944 the entire Junta resigned in corpore.Villanueva Mart\u00ednez 2003, p. 107. Cruz Anc\u00edn was appointed as acting Navarrese jef\u00e9; formal Elizalde\u2019s successor was Mariano Lumbier, appointed in 1947, Villanueva Mart\u00ednez 2003, p. 108 Madrid, 1950s There is close to nothing known about Elizalde's political engagements of the late 1940s and the early 1950s. Though aware of further Rodezno's talks with Don Juan, he is not listed as actively involved himself;e.g. in 1946 Elizalde did not accompany Rodezno during his visit to Don Juan; the only Navarros present were Arellano and Ortigosa, Villanueva Mart\u00ednez 2003, p. 109 moreover, in private correspondence he dwelled upon errors of juanismo against the background of opportunism.Jacek Bartyzel, Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji, Radzymin 2015, , p. 252 From time to time he published in El Pensamiento Navarro, trying to cultivate the Carlist identity and Traditionalist contribution to \u201cnuestra Cruzada y la parte decisiva y heroica que en elle tom\u00f3 Navarra\u201d;Elizalde hailed the Montejurra ascent as \u201crecio sabor de rito religioso popular que rememora y conmemora en s\u00edmbolo, incruentamente, un hecho real, magnifico y cruento: nuestra Cruzada y la parte decisiva y heroica que en elle tom\u00f3 Navarra\u201d, El Pensamiento Navarro 02.05.48, referred after Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962\u20131977, Pamplona 1997; , p. 285 in particular he continued to animate the Montejurra ascent.in 1951 Elizalde again wrote to El Pensamiento Navarro about Montejurra, \u201cd\u00eda de la oraci\u00f3n de los que perdieron a sus hijos, a sus maridos, a sus hermanos, en nuestra Cruzada, para ganarlos \u2013 si es cierta nuestra cristiana esperanza \u2013 en el cielo\u201d, El Pensamiento Navarro 05.05.51, referred after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 285 He went on living in MadridABC 28.05.48, available here and kept practicing as abogado, in the press listed e.g. as representing various legal entities engaged in juridical proceedings over mining licences;Bolet\u00edn Oficial de la Provincia de Santander 26.01.44, available here he also competed for posts in executive of the local Bar Association.ABC 28.05.48, available here ==Mid- Francoism== Cortes building Though still in his mid-40s, in the early 1950s Elizalde seemed political sidetracked, inactive either in semi-clandestine Carlist structures or in the official Francoist ones. The first signs of change came in 1953, when he was noted during cultural events in company of vehemently pro-regime offshoot Traditionalists like Jes\u00fas Evaristo Casariego.ABC 03.06.53, available here In early 1954 he was received by Franco at a private hearing; nothing is known either about the purpose or the outcome of the meeting.Imperio 25.02.54, available here Shortly afterwards he started to appear on semi-official events along the likes of Antonio Iturmendi.La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola 24.04.54, available here For the first time since his 1939 resignation from Junta Nacional, Elizalde firmly re-entered the officialdom when in 1954 Franco appointed him as member of Consejo Nacional of Falange;ABC 30.07.54, available here, B.O.E. 29.07.54, available here this in turn automatically ensured his seat in the Cortes.see the official Cortes service, available here The term of 6. Consejo Nacional expired in 1955, yet the same year Franco re-appointed Elizalde to the 7. National Council.Imperio 11.05.55, available here This time he served the full 3-year term, working in Seccion Educaci\u00f3n Popular;La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola 19.06.56, available here as consejero he again received the Cortes ticket in the so-called V. Legislatura, which he held until its expiry 1958.see the official Cortes service, available here Elizalde's seat in Consejo Nacional was not prolonged in 1958 and following 4 years in somewhat decorative yet still prestigious and nominally key institutions of the Francoist state he again fell off top strata of the regime. None of the sources consulted provides any insight either into a mechanism of Elizalde's political elevation or this of his political demise.Elizalde was one of 79 traditionalists in the Francoist Cortes, some 3% of the total, Miguel Angel Gim\u00e9nez Mart\u00ednez, Las Cortes de Franco o el Parlamento imposible, [in:] Trocadero: Revista de historia moderna y contemporanea 27 (2015), p. 78 There are no details available referring to his 1954-1958 Consejo Nacionala detailed study on Consejo Nacional does not mention Elizalde, see Miguel \u00c1ngel Gim\u00e9nez Mart\u00ednez, El Consejo Nacional del Movimientola \"c\u00e1mara de las ideas\" del franquismo, [in:] Investigaciones hist\u00f3ricas: \u00c9poca moderna y contempor\u00e1nea 35 (2015), pp. 271-297 or Cortes activity.a study on the Francoist Cortes ignores Elizalde, see Gim\u00e9nez Mart\u00ednez 2015 He was not noted in newspapers of the era; the only case his name appeared in the press was related to Elizalde's own article in Punta Europa, a Traditionalist periodical headed by V\u00edcente Marrero.Jes\u00fas Elizalde, La fiesta de los M\u00e1rtires de la Tradici\u00f3n, [in:] Punta Europa 1956/3, pp. 18-20, available here It is not clear whether cessation of Elizalde's Cortes career had anything to do with a so-called Acto de Estoril of 1957, when some 50 Traditionalists visited Don Juan and declared him the legitimate Carlist heir.Alcal\u00e1 2001, p. 139, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 24, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 302, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 186 Due to his wartime record and former position in the Navarrese executive Elizalde was among the most eminent \u201cestorilos\u201d; the act completed his 15-year journey to the Juanista camp and confirmed his definitive breakup with the Javierista branch of Carlism. However, it proved to have been Elizalde's political swan song. He did not enter Consejo Privado or other institutions grouping politicians from Don Juan's inner circle, and he soon disappeared from public life altogether; it is not clear whether he was marginalized or deliberately withdrew into privacy. Barely 50-year-old, he was no longer featured in the media and is not listed by historiographic works as engaged in politics, be it in the Francoist, Juanista or Carlist structures. The exception is an episode from 1967, when he briefly served as vice-president of Hermandad de Cristo Rey de Requet\u00e9s Ex-Combatientes, a pro-Juanista organisation of Carlist wartime volunteers.ABC 12.10.67, available here ==See also== * Carlism * Traditionalism (Spain) * Carlo-francoism ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, ==External links== * Elizalde at the official Cortes service * Category:Carlists Category:Members of the Congress of Deputies of the Second Spanish Republic Category:Members of the Cortes Espa\u00f1olas Category:Navarrese people Category:Propagandists Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:Spanish anti-communists Category:Spanish lawyers Category:Spanish monarchists Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:University of Zaragoza alumni ",
