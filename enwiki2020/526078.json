    "text": "Louis Jean N\u00e9pomuc\u00e8ne Lemercier (20 April 1771 \u2013 7 June 1840) was a French poet and playwright. ==Life== Lemarcier was born in Paris. His father had been intendant successively to the duc de Penthi\u00e8vre, the comte de Toulouse and the unfortunate princesse de Lamballe, who was the boy's godmother. Lemercier was a prodigy; before he was sixteen his tragedy of M\u00e9l\u00e9agre was produced at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais. Clarisse Harlowe (1792) provoked the criticism that the author was \"pas assez rou\u00e9 pour peindre les roueries\" (not enough scamp to depict scamp tricks.) Le Tartufe r\u00e9volutionnaire a parody full of bold political allusions, was suppressed after the fifth performance. In 1795, Lemercier's masterpiece Agamemnon, called by Charles Lafitte the last great antique tragedy in French literature, was produced. It was a great success, but was violently attacked later by Julien Louis Geoffroy who stigmatized it as a bad caricature of Prosper Jolyot de Cr\u00e9billon. Les quatre m\u00e9tamorphoses (1799) was written to prove that the most indecent subjects might be treated without offence. The Pinto (1800) was the result of a wager that no further dramatic innovations were possible after the comedies of Pierre Beaumarchais. It is a historical comedy on the subject of the Portuguese Revolution of 1640. This play was construed as casting reflections on the first consul Napoleon, who had hitherto been a firm friend of the avowed republican Lemercier. His extreme freedom of speech finally offended Napoleon, and the quarrel proved disastrous to Lemercier's fortune for the time. In 1803, he earned a severe disappointment on the premi\u00e8re of his tragedy Isule et Orov\u00e8se which was widely ridiculed and hooted by the public; consequently, at the beginning of the third act Lemercier withdrew his manuscript. He published his text with annoted \u201chootings\u201d in order to pay deference to his public.Original edition of Isule et Orov\u00e8se (1803) None of his subsequent work fulfilled the expectations raised by Agamemnon, with the exception perhaps of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9gonde et Brunehaut (1821). In 1810, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, where he consistently opposed the romanticists, refusing to vote for Victor Hugo \u2013 who was to succeed him in the fauteuil 14.Site of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise In spite of this, he has some pretensions to be considered the earliest of the romantic school. His Christophe Colomb (1809), advertised on the play-bill as a com\u00e9die shakesp\u00e9rienne [sic], represented the interior of a ship, and showed no respect for the classical unities. Its numerous innovations provoked such violent disturbances in the audience that one person was killed and future representations had to be guarded by the police. Lemercier wrote four long and ambitious epic poems: Hom\u00e8re, Alexandre (1801), L'Atlantiade ou la th\u00e9ogonie newtonienne (1812) and Mo\u00efse (1823), as well as an extraordinary Panhypocrisiade (1819-1832), a distinctly romantic production in sixteen cantos, which has the sub-title Spectacle infernal du XVIe si\u00e8cle. In it 16th century history, with Charles V and Francis I as principal personages, is played out on an imaginary stage by demons in the intervals of their sufferings. Lemercier died on 7 June 1840 in Paris. He had composed his own epitaph as follows: \u00ab Il fut homme de bien et cultiva les lettres. \u00bb (\u201cHe was a gentleman and a man of letters.\u201d) == Works == === Theatre === *1788: M\u00e9l\u00e9agre, tragedy in 5 acts *1792: Clarisse Harlowe, drama, in verse *1795: Le Tartufe r\u00e9volutionnaire, comedy in 5 acts, in verse *1796: Le L\u00e9vite d'\u00c9phra\u00efm, tragedy in 3 acts *1797: Agamemnon, tragedy in 5 acts, presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la R\u00e9publique 5 flor\u00e9al an V (24 April) *1797: La Prude, comedy *1798: Ophis, tragedy in 5 acts, presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la R\u00e9publique 2 niv\u00f4se an VII *1800: Pinto, ou la Journ\u00e9e d'une conspiration, historical comedy, created at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la R\u00e9publique 1 germinal an VIII (22 March) *1803: Isule et Orov\u00e8se, tragedy in 5 acts *1808: Baudouin, empereur, tragedy in 3 acts *1808: Plaute ou la Com\u00e9die latine, comedy in 3 acts, in verse, presented at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, 20 January *1809: Christophe Colomb, historical comedy in 3 acts, in verse, presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de S.
