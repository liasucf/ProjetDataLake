    "text": "Nation (stylized as N.A.T.I.O.N.) is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Bad Wolves. It was released through Eleven Seven Music on October 25, 2019. It is supported by the singles \"Learn to Walk Again\", \"Sober\" and \"Killing Me Slowly\". Bad Wolves promoted the album as a support act on Five Finger Death Punch's headline arena tour with Fire from the Gods and Three Days Grace in November 2019. ==Background== The album will reportedly feature a more \"focused\" sound than the band's debut, 2018's Disobey. Guitarist Doc Coyle called the record \"diverse\", saying that \"There's stuff that's probably heavier, as or more heavy than the last record... And then there's some really catchy, kind of more mainstream stuff to cover that end of it, and a lot of stuff in the middle.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Bad Wolves albums Category:Eleven Seven Label Group albums ",
