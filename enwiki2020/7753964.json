    "text": "\"You'd Be Surprised\" is a song written by Irving Berlin in 1919 which Eddie Cantor interpolated it into Ziegfeld's Follies of 1919. Cantor soon recorded it and it became a major hit. Other popular versions in 1920 were by the All- Star Trio and by Irving Kaufman. == Lyrics == The first verse introduces the shy Johnny and the woman Mary who finds him to be an exceptional lover, although apparently no one else ever has. She explains his appeal in the first chorus. By the second verse, Mary's talking-up of Johnny has resulted in him now being very popular with the ladies. The song leaves any questions about Mary's status unanswered. The first chorus mentions the Morris Chair, made popular in America by furniture maker Gustav Stickley. Part of first verse: :Johnny was bashful and shy; :Nobody understood why :Mary loved him :All the other girls passed him by. :Everyone wanted to know :How she could pick such a beau :With a twinkle in her eye :She made this reply Parts of various choruses: :He's not so good in a crowd :But when you get him alone :You'd be surprised; :He's kind of scared in a mob :But when he takes you home :You'd be surprised. :He won't impress you :Right from the start :But in a week or two :You'd be surprised. :At a party or a ball :I've got to admit he's nothing at all :But in a Morris chair :You'd be surprised Part of second verse: :Mary continued to praise :Johnny's remarkable ways :To the ladies :And you know advertising pays :Now Johnny's ne'er alone :He has the busiest phone :Almost every other day :A new girl will say ==Cover versions== Other chart versions in the USA were by Orrin Tucker (vocal by Bonnie Baker) in 1940 and by Johnnie Ray in 1954. The song was recorded by a number of other artists, including Billy Murray on November 19, 1919 for Victor (No. 18634A). Five years later in 1924, Murray would record a similar-themed tune called \"Charley, My Boy\", which included an instrumental referback to this one. The song was revived by Olga San Juan in the 1946 Bing Crosby/Fred Astaire film, Blue Skies. The song was also memorably recorded by Marilyn Monroe in 1954 - with alternate lyrics. It is available on the Marilyn Monroe compilation album titled Anthology. Kathy Linden released a version of the song as a single in 1958 that reached #50 on the Billboard pop chart.Kathy Linden, \"You'd Be Surprised\" chart position Retrieved January 22, 2016.
