    "text": "Rasmus Nellemann (2 March 1923 \u2013 4 September 2004) was a Danish painter and illustrator. He is remembered in particular for his many abstract postage stamp designs. ==Biography== Born in Millinge near F\u00e5borg on the island of Funen, Nellemann was introduced to art at the Odense Technical School before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (1948\u201353) where he studied painting under Aksel J\u00f8rgensen and Vilhelm Lundstr\u00f8m and graphic arts under Holger Jensen. In 1950, Nellemann exhibited six paintings of Millinge at the Artists Autumn Exhibition (Kunstnernes Efter\u00e5rsudstilling) but soon concentrated on graphic arts, initially lithography, then etching. His illustrations were in a simple abstract style, full of straight lines. He also designed many postage stamps from 1960 to 1992, becoming Denmark's most productive artist in the field with 32 different designs. Nellemannn was also a ceramist, applying his Constructivist approach to ceramic reliefs for the Bygholm agricultural school near Horsens and Led\u00f8je-Sm\u00f8rum's town hall. ==Awards== In 1974, Nellemann was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1986, the Thorvaldsen Medal. ==References== ==Literature== * * ==External links== *Illustrated list of Rasmus Nellemann's works in Danish museums *Selection of Nellemann's works from Clausens Kunsthandel *Examples of Nellemann's postage stamp designs from the Post & Tele Museum Category:1923 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:Danish illustrators Category:Danish ceramists Category:Danish stamp designers Category:People from Faaborg-Midtfyn Municipality Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni Category:20th-century ceramists ",
