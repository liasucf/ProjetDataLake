    "text": "Moringa, native to parts of Africa and Asia, is the sole genus in the flowering plant family Moringaceae. The name is derived from murungai, the Tamil word for drumstick, and the plant is commonly referred to as the drumstick tree. It contains 13 species from tropical and subtropical climates that range in size from tiny herbs to massive trees. Moringa species grow quickly in many types of environments. The most widely cultivated species is Moringa oleifera, native to the foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, a multipurpose tree cultivated throughout the tropics and marketed as a dietary supplement, health food or source for herbalism practices. The fruit pods of Moringa oleifera (\"drumsticks\") are consumed as food in many parts of the world, but particularly in South Asia. The leaves are commonly used to make tea. Oils are made from the seeds, while powders can be made from the leaves and roots. M. stenopetala, an African species, is also widely grown, but to a much lesser extent than M. oleifera. ==List of species== * Moringa arborea Verdc.
