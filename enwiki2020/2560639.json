    "text": "Ebba the Movie is a documentary film of Swedish punk band Ebba Gr\u00f6n from 1982, by director and writer Johan Donner. The film includes a lot of live music and interviews with the band's members. It starts in R\u00e5gsved, a working class suburb of Stockholm, and follows Ebba Gr\u00f6n on tour around Sweden until the band returns to R\u00e5gsved. The Swedish reggaeband Dag Vag also participates in a part of the movie when Ebba is on tour. There are two versions of the film. When released in 1982, the movie was originally 78 minutes long. Johan Donner later cut down the film to a 52 minutes version which he called the Hardcore version. Both versions are included in the DVD-release. The title of the film is a reference to the 1977 documentary film ABBA: The Movie, featuring fellow Swedes ABBA. The reference is intended to be ironic, since Ebba Gr\u00f6n's style is very different from that of ABBA. == External links == * Category:1982 films Category:Swedish documentary films Category:Swedish films Category:Documentary films about punk music and musicians Category:1982 documentary films ",
