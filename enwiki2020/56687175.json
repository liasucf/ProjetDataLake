In a 2019 email to the firm, Sneader indicated that McKinsey had never focused on developing, advising or implementing immigration policies. McKinsey, he wrote, \u201cwill not, under any circumstances, engage in work, anywhere in the world, that advances or assists policies that are at odds with our values.\u201d A subsequent New York Times investigation claimed that McKinsey's involvement in deportations had been more extensive than Sneader acknowledged in his email. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:People from Glasgow Category:Scottish Jews Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:McKinsey & Company people ",
