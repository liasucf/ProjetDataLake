In addition to Magoo's Gaming Group, Caudill owns 3 casinos: Four Queens, Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel, and Skinny Dugans Casino & Lounge. In 2009, a landlord filed a lawsuit against TLC Casino Enterprises, \"seeking back rent and the appointment of a receiver to take over the historic gambling hall\" after TLC requested rent be lowered due to the recession. TLC currently manages and operates the Hotel Apache which reopened after extensive renovation. According to Tim Lager, general manager of Binion, he wanted to \"recreate what this hotel was when it opened as what was then a megaresort back in 1932\". ==References== Category:Casinos in Las Vegas Category:Gambling companies established in 2002 Category:Hospitality companies established in 2002 Category:Gambling companies of the United States Category:Hospitality companies of the United States ",
