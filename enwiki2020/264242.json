The awards go to one Canadian and one international poet who writes in the English language. Effective 2010, the annual Griffin Poetry Prize was doubled from CAD$100,000 to CAD$200,000 in recognition of the prize\u2019s tenth anniversary. The increased amount of $100,000 will be awarded as follows: CAD$10,000 to each of the seven shortlisted \u2013 four international and three Canadian \u2013 for their participation in the shortlist readings. The winners, announced at the Griffin Poetry Prize Awards evening, will be awarded CAD$65,000 each, for a total of CAD$75,000 that includes the CAD$10,000 awarded at the readings the previous evening. ==History== In April 2000, Scott Griffin started the Griffin Trust to raise public awareness of the crucial role poetry plays in society's cultural life. Griffin served as its Chairman, with Trustees Margaret Atwood, Robert Hass, Michael Ondaatje, Robin Robertson and David Young. In June 2004, Carolyn Forch\u00e9 joined the board of Trustees. New trustees have been named as follows: in 2014, Karen Solie, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Mark Doty, in 2016, Jo Shapcott and Marek Kazmierski, in 2018, Ian Williams and in 2020, Sarah Howe. Margaret Atwood, Robert Hass, Michael Ondaatje, Robin Robertson, Jo Shapcott and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn have assumed the role of Trustees Emeriti. The Trust created the Griffin Poetry Prize with the aim of helping to introduce contemporary collections of poetry to the public's imagination. Originally, the award was two annual prizes of CAD$40,000 each, for collections of poetry published in English during the preceding year. One prize for a living Canadian poet, the other to a living poet from any other country, which could include Canada. Qualified judges are selected annually by the Trustees. The prize shortlists are announced in April (National Poetry Month) every year. The shortlisted poets gather for an evening of public readings every May/June, and the winners are announced and all the poets are feted the following evening. Each year, selections from the shortlisted works are gathered in The Griffin Poetry Prize Anthology, typically edited by one of that year's judges. In 2019, House of Anansi Press partnered with the National Network for Equitable Library Services (NNELS) to offer the anthology in print and digital Braille editions.Poetry You Can Touch (June 4, 2019) Eligible collections of poetry must have been published between January 1 and December 31 of the prior year. Submissions must come from publishers only. In November 2010, Scott Griffin announced a new Griffin Trust initiative called Poetry In Voice/Les voix de la po\u00e9sie, a bilingual recitation contest for high school students across Canada.Poetry gets cool for school: Scott Griffin launches Poetry in Voice (November 23, 2010) - National Post The Griffin Trust has championed other initiatives since its inception, including a statue in tribute to poet Al Purdy,Literary luminaries attend unveiling of statue of 'people's poet' Al Purdy (May 21, 2008) - The Canadian Press participation in international poetry festivals, and donations of poetry books to various organizations, including the Correctional Service of Canada, Scottish Poetry Library and other libraries, schools and colleges. ==Finalists, Judges and Lifetime Recognition recipients== Winners are listed first and highlighted with bold. ===2001=== Canada: *Anne Carson, Men in the Off Hours\"Anne Carson wins poetry prize\", CBC News, 8 June 2001. *Robert Bringhurst, Nine Visits to the Mythworld *Don McKay, Another Gravity International: *Nikolai Popov and Heather McHugh, translation of Glottal Stop: 101 Poems from the German written by Paul Celan *Chana Bloch and Chana Kronfeld, translation of Open Closed Open from the Hebrew written by Yehuda Amichai *Fanny Howe, Selected Poems *Les Murray, Learning Human Judges: *Carolyn Forch\u00e9 *Dennis Lee *Paul Muldoon Guest performer at awards ceremony: Gord Downie ===2002=== Canada: *Christian B\u00f6k, Eunoia *Erin Mour\u00e9, Sheep's Vigil by a Fervent Person *Karen Solie, Short Haul Engine International: *Alice Notley, Disobedience *Victor Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, Maraca *Christopher Logue, Homer: War Music *Les Murray, Conscious and Verbal Judges: *Dionne Brand *Robert Creeley *Michael Hofmann Guest host at awards ceremony: Albert Schultz ===2003=== Canada: *Margaret Avison, Concrete and Wild Carrot *Dionne Brand, thirsty *P.
