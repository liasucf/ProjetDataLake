Born in Voden (now Edessa, Greece) in 1792, he likely was schooled in Thessaloniki or Athens, where he had relatives. It is unknown when he moved to Serbia. His wife, Kostadinka Karkaljer, was from Magarevo (now North Macedonia). He had four daughters and a son. He died at Belgrade in 1870. A construction worker and contractor by trade, he became Obrenovi\u0107's chief builder, entrusted with building all governmental- and royal buildings between 1820 and 1850. He is sometimes called an architect, although it remains unknown if there was an actual architect behind the works. The most notable buildings are Princess Ljubica's Residence and Residence of Prince Milo\u0161. ==References== * * * Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:Architecture of Serbia Category:Principality of Serbia Category:1792 births Category:1870 deaths Category:People from Edessa, Greece Category:Serbian people of Greek descent ",
