He was a son of Anne Marie, Countess d'Escherny (1820\u20131901) and Henri, Count de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier (1815\u20131876), the last Lord of Gorgier. Among his siblings were sisters Marie de Pourtal\u00e8s (who became a Countess of the Charit\u00e9 de Saint-Vincent de Paul), \u00c9milie de Pourtal\u00e8s (the wife of Baron \u00c9tienne Renouard de Bussi\u00e8re), and Louise de Pourtal\u00e8s (wife of Count Raymond Charles de Geoffre de Chabrignac). His paternal grandparents were the former Anne Henriette de Pal\u00e9zieux- Falconnet (niece of U.S. Senator William Hunter) and James-Alexandre de Pourtal\u00e8s, a Swiss-French banker, diplomat and art collector who built the Pourtal\u00e8s mansion and served as chamberlain to the King of Prussia Frederick William III. His grandfather acquired the seigneury of Gorgier, including the Ch\u00e2teau de Gorgier, in 1813 as well as the Ch\u00e2teau de Bandeville and Ch\u00e2teau de Luins. Among his large extended family was aunt \u00c9lisa Calixte de Pourtal\u00e8s (wife of Charles-Alexandre, Marquis de Ganay) uncle Edmond de Pourtal\u00e8s (husband to M\u00e9lanie (n\u00e9e de Bussi\u00e8re) de Pourtal\u00e8s, lady-in-waiting to Empress Eug\u00e9nie, wife of Napoleon III). ==Career== Pourtal\u00e8s succeeded his father as the 3rd Count de Pourtal\u00e8s on 31 July 1876. Throughout his diplomatic career, he served in various roles, including as the French Consul at Newcastle in England, and the Secretary to the French legation in Washington, D.C. and in Buitenzorg in Indonesia. He also served as the Minister Plenipotentiary of France to Guatemala. ==Personal life== Pourtal\u00e8s was twice married to American heiresses. His first marriage was to Jenny Lind Holladay (1851\u20131873) on 6 December 1869 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Gorgier. Jennie's father, Ben Holladay, owned the Pony Express and created an overland stagecoach route during the California Gold Rush, earning him the nickname \"Stagecoach King.\" Jennie's sister Cassandra married Baron de Bussi\u00e8re (a relative of his aunt M\u00e9lanie de Pourtal\u00e8s). Before her death on a train on 15 May 1873, they were the parents of one daughter: * Marie Pauline Louise \"Jenny\" de Pourtal\u00e8s (1871\u20131912), who married Antoine Grubissich de Kereszt\u00far in Japan in 1898. He later became the first secretary to the Austrian legion of the Austrian-Hungarian empire and later Consul-General in Tunis. After his wife's death in 1873, while in Baltimore, Maryland, he met and became engaged to Marie-Ad\u00e9le Boozer (1852\u20131908), a daughter of David Boozer and the former wife of John S. Beecher, with whom she had a son, John Preston Beecher (later the U.S. Vice Consul in Le Havre and Consul at Cognac). Marie was also, notoriously, the lover of Union Gen. Hugh Judson Kilpatrick. They were married on 2 May 1876. After their wedding, they went to Shanghai and Hong Kong where they were entertained by Governor John Pope Hennessy before returning to France. She was a daughter of Beauvar-Boosier, Esq. of New Orleans. The Countess de Pourtal\u00e8s died 25 January 1908 at their tweny-five room Villa Terrarossa near Toscana, just three miles from Florence in Italy. Count de Pourtal\u00e8s died twenty years later in 1928. ==References== Category:1844 births Category:1928 deaths Category:French diplomats Pourtal\u00e8s Category:Pourtal\u00e8s family ",
