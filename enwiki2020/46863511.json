    "text": "Luciana Maria Dionizio (born 24 July 1987), commonly known as Luciana, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Ferrovi\u00e1ria and the Brazilian national team. She participated at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. ==Early life== Luciana was born in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. She began playing football as a child with her brothers, but became a goalkeeper because she did not enjoy running. She admired the calmness and serenity displayed by her football role model, male Brazilian goalkeeper Dida. ==Club career== In the early part of her career Luciana had spells with Corinthians and Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. She played for Francana from 2007 until 2012, then joined local rivals Ferrovi\u00e1ria ahead of the 2013 season. In April 2014, Luciana saved three penalties in Ferrovi\u00e1ria's shootout win over S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 in the 2014 Copa do Brasil final. ==International career== At the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship, Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro player Luciana was part of the Brazilian squad which finished third. After appearing in the senior Brazil squad in 2009, Luciana was not selected again until May 2013 when good form with her club led to a recall for a friendly in Sweden. She made her senior international debut in December 2013, starting Brazil's 2\u20130 win over Chile at the 2013 Torneio Internacional de Bras\u00edlia de Futebol Feminino. After getting a second chance in the national team, Luciana was keen to become the number one goalkeeper ahead of experienced rivals B\u00e1rbara and Andr\u00e9ia Suntaque. At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Luciana kept clean sheets in all three matches as Brazil qualified from their group without conceding a goal. In the second round match against Australia, Luciana took responsibility for Brazil's defeat when she spilled a shot to Kyah Simon, who scored Australia's winning goal. Luciana remained in Canada as part of the Brazilian selection for the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto. ==References== ==External links== * * Luciana Maria Dionizio \u2013 FIFA World Cup profile * Luciana Maria Dionizio \u2013 2015 Pan American Games profile Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian women's footballers Category:Brazil women's international footballers Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Women's association football goalkeepers Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista (women) players Category:Sportspeople from Belo Horizonte Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Ferrovi\u00e1ria de Esportes (women) players Category:Pan American Games medalists in football Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil Category:Footballers at the 2015 Pan American Games ",
