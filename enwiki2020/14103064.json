    "text": "Petrova Gora () is a hill range in central Kordun region of Croatia, administratively part of the Karlovac County. It extends northeast-southwest, some 25 kilometers along the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==Etymology== In the past, the mountain was called as Slatska Gora until 1445, and only from 1536 as Petrova Gora. The latter name was in honor of the Croatian King Petar Sna\u010di\u0107 who died in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain. The traditional Croatian historiography erroneously identified the Gvozd Mountain with Petrova Gora, as the more probable location of the battle was in the Kapela mountain pass of central Croatia. ==Summary== It is an old geological formation, which means that it is relatively rich in water and especially in forest vegetation. This also implies a certain mountaineering restraint because it lacks broad visibility, but there is also a large identification of reliefs with numerous significant reefs and deep ravines enriched with numerous streams. It composed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks. The 37 meter high memorial to Mali Petrovac and the abandoned communications tower at Magar\u010devac, which could easily become a hiking pyramid, provide an excellent view of the immediate surroundings, but also to a good part of central Croatia, Gorski Kotar, and Slovenia, and especially Northwest Bosnia. The idea of building a monument on Mali Petrovac was encouraged even after the end of World War II, and on May 6, 1946, the foundation stone was laid. Construction began only after 34 years, in mid 1980, according to the original plans of the Croatian sculptor Vojin Baki\u0107. The monument opened on October 4, 1981. The monument is a masterpiece of monumental commemorative sculpture of its time and highlights the role of Petrova Gora in the antifascist struggle in this region. ==See also== * Monument to the uprising of the people of Kordun and Banija ==References== Category:Mountain ranges of Croatia Category:Landforms of Karlovac County ",
