    "text": "Edensor (pronounced ) is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, England. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 145. It is the closest village to Chatsworth House. Much of it belongs to the Dukes of Devonshire, most of whom are buried in the churchyard of St Peter's Church. ==Location== Originally the village was close to the River Derwent immediately below Chatsworth, but between 1838 and 1842 William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire had it moved out of sight over a hill, apart from one cottage whose tenant did not want to move, which still stands in Chatsworth Park. The planning of the new village was overseen by Joseph Paxton (later Sir Joseph Paxton); in 1840 he was joined in designing houses by John Robertson. The Chatsworth Estate office occupies a \"fine brick building\" which was built as an inn for visitors to Chatsworth in the 18th century and attributed to James Paine. Many of the buildings in the village are listed buildings, a few at the higher Grade II*, and the church at Grade I. ==St Peter's Church== ==Dunsa== The hamlet of Dunsa lies to the northwest of Edensor at . ==Gallery== File:Edensor - geograph.org.uk - 671.jpg|Approaching from Chatsworth File:Edensor_-_Village_Scene.jpg|Village scene File:Edensor, Derbyshire - Devonshire building 1.JPG|Devonshire building File:St Peter's, Edensor - geograph.org.uk - 298211.jpg|St Peter's Church File:St Peter's Churchyard, Edensor - Cavendish family plot1.JPG|Cavendish family plot with the graves of the Dukes of Devonshire File:St Peter's Churchyard, Edensor - grave of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire.JPG|Grave of the 6th Duke of Devonshire (d. 1858), founder of modern-day Edensor File:Edensor 201307 117.jpg ==See also== *Beeley\u2014another Chatsworth estate village *Pilsley\u2014also a Chatsworth estate village *Milton Abbas\u2014a village in Dorset that was moved by a landowner ==References== ==External links== *Edensor at genuki.co.uk Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District Category:Derbyshire Dales ",
