He won the fifth season of the Portuguese version of Pop Idol in 2012. ==Biography== Diogo Pi\u00e7arra was born in Faro. As a 17-year-old, he formed the band \"Fora da B\u00f3ia\". While studying at the University of Algarve, he took a semester abroad to pursue his studies at Palack\u00fd University in the Czech Republic. In 2009, Pi\u00e7arra competed on season three of \u00cddolos, Portugal's version of Pop Idol. He got to the piano phase of the competition and was eliminated. In 2010, he participated in the music TV contest Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Triunfo, but did not get through to the first round. In 2012, he tried for the third time and won season five of \u00cddolos. As a prize, he won a car and a scholarship to a music course in London. He released his first album, Espelho, in March 2015, which debuted at number one on the Portuguese music charts. In the end of March 2017, he released his second album, do=s, collaborating with artists such as Valas on \"Ponto de Partida\" and April Ivy on \"N\u00e3o Sou Eu\". In 2017, he tattooed the face of the late Chester Bennington from Linkin Park on his leg to pay homage to him, stating that this was one of his childhood heroes. In January 2018, it was announced that Pi\u00e7arra would participate in Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o 2018, singing a song that he composed, called \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Fim\". This was his first attempt at this competition, which allows the winner to participate in Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon. Days before the Grand Final of Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o 2018, and after winning the second semi-final with the maximum score, he decided to leave the competition, due to accusations that he had plagiarised \"Open Your Eyes\", a 1976 song performed by the Maranatha Singers.https://www.movenoticias.com/2018/02/afinal-musica-da-iurd-falada- apos-festival-tambem-nao-original/ ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:11em;\" |Certifications |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| POR |- |scope=\"row\"| Espelho (Mirror) | *Released: 16 March 2015 *Label: Universal |1 | * AFP: Platinum |- |scope=\"row\"| do=s (Two) | *Released: 31 March 2017 *Label: Universal |1 | * AFP: Platinum |- |scope=\"row\"| South Side Boy | *Released: 29 November 2019 *Label: Universal |1 | |} === Singles === ====As lead artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+List of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions and certifications, showing year released and album name ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Title ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Certifications ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\" |POR |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Dialeto\" | 2016 | 27 | *AFP: Platinum | rowspan=\"10\" |do=s |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"200\" | rowspan=\"10\" | 2017 | 97 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Dois\" | 72 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Caminho\" | 87 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Erro\" | 78 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Hist\u00f3ria\" | 43 | *AFP: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"J\u00e1 N\u00e3o Falamos\" | 49 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"N\u00e3o Sou Eu\" | 70 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Ponto de Partida\" | 95 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"S\u00f3 Existo Contigo\" | 47 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Fim\" | \u2014 | | Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o 2017 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Para\u00edso\" | 2018 | 39 | | rowspan=\"3\" '''' |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"A D\u00f3nde Vas\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2019 | 76 | |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" | 68 | |- | colspan=\"16\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ====As featured artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of singles as featured artist, with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year !Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\" |POR |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Entre as Estrelas\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2016 | 91 | Ess\u00eancia |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Wall Of Love\" | 65 | '''' |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"N\u00e3o Sei\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2017 | \u2014 | Tudo Para Dar |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Trevo (Tu)\" | \u2014 | '''' |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"At\u00e9 ao Fim\" | 2018 | 10 | No Fame |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Aqui\" | 2018 | \u2014 | Lobos |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1990 births Category:Portuguese male singers Category:Idols (TV series) winners Category:21st-century Portuguese singers Category:Portuguese male singer-songwriters Category:Portuguese pop singers Category:People from Faro, Portugal Category:21st-century male singers ",
