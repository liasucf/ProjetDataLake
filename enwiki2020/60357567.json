    "text": "\"Strife\" is a song by American heavy metal band Trivium. It was released as the second single from the band's sixth studio album Vengeance Falls. ==Background== \"Strife\" made its debut during the band's performance at Wacken Open Air on August 3, 2013. A studio recording of the song was released a few weeks later as a single on August 20. ==Reception== Several reviews of Vengeance Falls highlighted \"Strife\" as the album's top track. Dan Slessor of Alternative Press called \"Strife\" a \"state-of-the-art metallic anthem.\" Ridge Briel of New Noise described the song as \"an anthemic Shogun-esque track, with soaring riffs and a thick bass tone that captures Trivium at one of the high points of the album.\" ===Commercial=== \"Strife\" was a minor hit on American rock radio following its release. The single peaked at no. 24 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart on March 15, 2014, the band's highest charting single at the time; this would be surpassed with \"Until the World Goes Cold\" from the band's following album Silence in the Snow. ==Track listing== ;CD single ;10\" single ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013\u201314) ! scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Mainstream Rock | 24 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Rock (Official Charts Company) | 35 |} ==Personnel== *Matt Heafy \u2013 lead vocals, guitars *Corey Beaulieu \u2013 guitars, backing vocals *Paolo Gregoletto \u2013 bass, backing vocals *Nick Augusto \u2013 drums ==References== ==External links== *Official Music Video on YouTube Category:2013 songs Category:2013 singles Category:Roadrunner Records singles Category:Trivium (band) songs Category:Songs written by Matt Heafy Category:Songs written by Corey Beaulieu Category:Songs written by Paolo Gregoletto ",
