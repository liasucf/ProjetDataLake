    "text": "A piada or a piadina with bresaola. Piadinas are not only Sammarinese dishes but are also common in the surrounding region, Emilia Romagna. As San Marino is a microstate completely landlocked by Italy, Sammarinese cuisine is strongly similar to Italian cuisine, especially that of the adjoining Emilia- Romagna and Marche regions. San Marino's primary agricultural products are cheese, wine and livestock, and cheesemaking is a primary economic activity in San Marino. San Marino participated in The Exposition Universelle of 1889, a world's fair held in Paris, France, with three exhibits of oils and cheese. ==Dishes== Local savoury dishes include fagioli con le cotiche, a Christmas bean and bacon soup; pasta e ceci, a chickpea and noodle soup with garlic and rosemary; nidi di rondine, a baked pasta dish with smoked ham, beef, cheese, and a tomato sauce; and roast rabbit with fennel. Erbazzone is a spinach-based dish that includes cheese and onions. There is a dish found mostly in Borgo Maggiore called a piada, which consists of flatbread with various fillings and is somewhat similar to a piadina from Emilia-Romagna. ==Desserts and sweets== Bustrengo Sweets include a cake known as Torta Tre Monti (\"Cake of the Three Mountains/Towers\"), based on The Three Towers of San Marino and similar to a layered wafer cake covered in chocolate; Torta Titano, a layered dessert made with biscuit, hazelnuts, chocolate, cream and coffee, also inspired by San Marino's central mountain, Monte Titano; Bustrengo, a traditional Christmas cake made with honey, nuts and dried fruit; Verretta, a dessert made of hazelnuts, praline and chocolate wafers; Cacciatello, a dessert made with milk, sugar and eggs, similar to Cr\u00e8me caramel; and zuppa di ciliegie, cherries stewed in sweetened red wine and served on white bread. ==Alcoholic beverages== ===Wine=== The region also produces a number of wines such as Brugneto and Tessano (cask-aged red wines) and Biancale and Roncale (still white wines). Wine in San Marino is regulated by the San Marino Wine Association, which is also a large-scale wine producer. ===Spirits=== Its liqueurs include the aniseed-flavoured Mistr\u00e0, the truffle-flavoured Tilus and the herbal Duca di Gualdo. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * San Marino Food and Drink.
