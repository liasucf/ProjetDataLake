    "text": "V Festival, often referred to as V Fest or simply V, is an annual music festival held in the United Kingdom during the third weekend in August. The event was held at two parks simultaneously which shared the same bill; artists performed at one location on Saturday and then swapped on Sunday. The sites were located at Hylands Park in Chelmsford and Weston Park in South Staffordshire. It was announced by Richard Branson on 30 October 2017 that V Festival would be discontinued but that a new festival would replace it. In 2018, a new festival called \"Rize\" was held in on the same weekend as the \"V Festival\" but only at Hylands Park. However, on 5 August 2020, it was announced that the \"V Festival\" was to return to Hylands Park, without an audience (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), later that monthhttps://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/18629655.olly- murs-anne-marie-headline-virtual-v-festival/. The \"V\" represented the Virgin Group, with the event being sponsored by Virgin Media. It was originally televised by Channel 4 from 1997 to 2013, predominantly on their sister channel 4 Music, with the exception of the 2003 event with ITV in charge. It was then televised by MTV from 2014 to 2015, and the 2016 edition of the festival was televised by Channel 5. ITV returned to televising the V Festival upon its return in 2020, with coverage hosted by Joel Dommett and Maya Jamahttps://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/18629655.olly- murs-anne-marie-headline-virtual-v-festival/. ==History== The idea for V came in 1996 when Pulp's front man Jarvis Cocker said that he would love to play two outdoor venues in two days. Pulp's promoters got together and came up with the idea of putting the gig into Victoria Park Warrington and Hylands Park Chelmsford giving fans in both the North and South a chance to see the band. Then came the idea of adding more bands to the bill, putting on a second stage and letting people camp for the weekend. In the end Victoria Park was just too small for 3 stages and camping. So in August 1996 there was one day of artists in Victoria Park and 2 days at Hylands Park with camping. The northern leg of V97 was switched to Temple Newsam, Leeds to provide room for camping and three stages. In 1999 the Northern leg of the festival was moved to Weston Park in Staffordshire, and has remained there since. Previously it had been held at Temple Newsam in Leeds, before being replaced by Carling's Leeds Festival. Originally, the festival took the name of the current year, with the first festival being named \"V96\". Since 2003 it has been known as simply the V Festival. Its weekend format, low queuing times and professional organisation have given it a loyal audience. The festival sold out in record time in 2006. Mel C, Dido, and N.E.R.D. have all performed at the festival, and both Razorlight and Faithless performed in 2006. V showcases a mix of British and international musicians, from up-and-coming bands such as Coldplay in 2000 and the Kaiser Chiefs in 2003 and 2008, and glam rockers El Presidente in 2005, to veteran crooner Tony Christie. Girls Aloud also performed at the 2006 show, and received rave reviews for their performance. V97 was the first V Festival to be webcast. This was audio-only, and had about 30,000 unique listeners. ==Festivals and line-ups by year== ===V96=== The first V festival took place on Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 August 1996, and had two stages and one tent. * V stage: Pulp, Paul Weller, Supergrass, The Charlatans, Cast, Lightning Seeds, Gary Numan, Shed Seven, Stereolab, Incognito, Jonathan Richman, The Mike Flowers Pops, Longpigs, Edge Park * 2nd Stage: Elastica, Sleeper, Heavy Stereo, Menswear, Fluffy, The Cardigans, Super Furry Animals, The Wannadies, Denim, Kula Shaker, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Space, Tiger, Pusherman, Orbital * Dance Arena: Tricky, The Aloof, Morcheeba, Lamb, Mad Professor, Alan Hale & Helen Welch ===V97=== This year introduced the NME stage. * V Stage: Blur, The Prodigy, Kula Shaker, Beck, Dodgy, Foo Fighters, Reef, Placebo, Pavement, Fluke, Teenage Fanclub, Apollo 440, The Supernaturals, Echobelly, Linoleum * NME Stage: Ash, The Bluetones, Mansun, Gene, The Divine Comedy, Longpigs, Monaco, Echo & the Bunnymen, Symposium, Geneva, Silver Sun, Veruca Salt, Embrace, Hurricane#1, AC Acoustics, Stereophonics, The Driven, Radish * Virgin High Energy Tent: The Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Dreadzone, Propellerheads, Death in Vegas, Sneaker Pimps, GusGus, Lionrock, Jimi Tenor, Olive, Finley Quaye, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Carl Cox, Trademark ===V98=== * V Stage: The Verve, The Charlatans, The Seahorses, Texas, Green Day, Robbie Williams, The Lightning Seeds, Space, Iggy Pop, James, Chumbawamba, Stereophonics, Marion, Feeder, Whale, Rialto, Young Offenders, Headswim * NME Stage: Underworld, Fun Lovin' Criminals, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Ian Brown, Catatonia, PJ Harvey, Saint Etienne, Morcheeba, Lo Fidelity Allstars, Republica, Gomez, The Dandy Warhols, The Montrose Avenue, theaudience, Midget, One Lady Owner, Superstar, The Smiles * Dance Tent: James Brown, All Saints, Roni Size, K-Gee, Bj\u00f6rn Again, Cornershop, Roachford, 67y, Karen Ramirez, Faithless, Regular Fries, DJ Norman Jay, Tin Star, Lionrock, Dean Thatcher, Moloko, Boom Boom Satellites, Disque Blu, Cuba ===V99=== * V Stage: Manic Street Preachers, Suede, The Beautiful South, Stereophonics, Placebo (withdrew due illness, replaced by Supergrass), Happy Mondays, Cast, The Levellers, Gomez, Faithless, The Cardigans, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Afro Celt Sound System, The Saw Doctors, Melanie C * NME Stage: James Brown, Massive Attack, Super Furry Animals, Mercury Rev, Shed Seven, DJ Shadow, Travis, Gay Dad, dEUS, Red Snapper, A, Death in Vegas, Dot Allison, Eve 6, Liz Horman, YY29, Medal, One Lady Owner * JJB Arena Stage: Orbital, Finley Quaye, lan brown Lamb, Rae & Christian, Freestylers, Sneaker Pimps, The Egg, Groove Armada, Mishka, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Regular Fries, Technique, ManCHILD, Archive * Reebox Arena: Paul Oakenfold, DJ Sneak, Dave Ralph, Derek Carter, Dope Smugglaz, Justin Robertson, Aphrodite, Dave Angel, Jumping Jack Frost, Andy Weatherall, Layo, Mr. C, Matthew B ===V2000=== * Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve) goes solo and Travis unveil their cover of Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\" which they had already played at Glastonbury Festival in June 2000. * V Stage: Travis, Richard Ashcroft, Macy Gray, Paul Weller, Ocean Colour Scene, James, All Saints, Cypress Hill, Morcheeba, Barenaked Ladies, Semisonic, Brand New Heavies, The Bootleg Beatles, Bj\u00f6rn Again, Andreas Johnson, Toploader * MTV Stage: Supergrass, Moby, Mansun, Beth Orton, Bloodhound Gang, Joe Strummer, Saint Etienne, Feeder, Dum Dums, The Dandy Warhols, Soulwax, Coldplay, Hefner, SX 10, Big Leaves, The Webb Brothers, Pacifica * JJB Puma Arena: Underworld, Leftfield, The Flaming Lips, Death in Vegas, Moloko, Groove Armada, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Kelis, M.

The other main stage headliner was Kings Of Leon, with headliners on other stages including Jamie Cullum, Basement Jaxx and former Swedish House Mafia DJ Steve Angello. For the 2013 festival, one stage was renamed: the stage previously known as 'Virgin Media Undercover Tent' now became known as 'Futures Stage'. A poster released by the organisers initially seemed to suggest that the stage previously known as '4Music Stage' had been renamed as 'Stage 2', leading to speculation that Channel 4 had ended their sponsorship of the event, however a revised version of the poster released later reinstated the original name of the stage. Multiple changes were made to the bill in the days leading up to the festival. Beady Eye were scheduled to headline opposite Beyonc\u00e9 on the 4Music Stage, however they had to cancel all live shows through August 2013 because of the hospitalisation of member Gem Archer. Thus, their headlining slot on the 4Music Stage was taken over by Steve Angello, whose own previous headlining slot on The Arena Stage was taken over by Ocean Colour Scene. Ocean Colour Scene had themselves previously been scheduled to play an earlier timeslot on the main stage on the opposite day - that slot was taken over by Scouting For Girls, whose previous slot on the 4Music Stage was in turn taken over by previously-unannounced act Reverend and The Makers. In unrelated developments, Little Mix were removed from the line- up for undisclosed reasons, and their fellow The X Factor winner James Arthur also cancelled his appearance the very day before the festival, citing a throat infection. Finally, on the official V Festival lanyard offered to festival attendees upon their arrival on site, it was confirmed that four previously-unannounced acts had been added to the Futures Stage - these were James Bay, Hero Fisher, Gamu Nhengu and Paul McCartney's son James McCartney. The majority of the line-up, with day and stage splits, was announced on 30 May 2013.

The V Festival received criticism for charging \u00a310 to buy a programme - the only way festival-goers can see what time artists are performing - while others have mentioned the fact burgers cost \u00a37 and water bottles are sometimes confiscated at the entrance, costing up to \u00a32 once inside the grounds. Buying four crates on site would cost a person the same price as a ticket.Festival fans condemn 'greedy' V BBC News Some fans have referred to the organisers of the event as 'greedy'.Fans call V Festival organisers \u2018greedy\u2019 Festival News Despite this, the New Statesman argues that the commercial nature has some advantages: \"Yet there are undeniable advantages to the [commercial] environment. V is a remarkably non-threatening festival, with few of the rougher edges prevalent at other large-scale gatherings.\" The Evening Standard gave the 2009 festival 3/5 stars after headliners Oasis pulled out of the Hylands Park leg of the festival due to illness.V Festival crowd looks back in anger London Evening Standard Furthermore, approximately 800 people were injured, mainly due to falls causing sprains and ankle injuries.Almost 800 festival-goers treated BBC News In 2012, during Cher Lloyd's performance, the crowd booed and a bottle filled with urine was thrown at her, causing Lloyd to walk off stage. She came back on to finish her set but another bottle was thrown and she ended her set early.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/20/cher-lloyd-v-festival ==See also== *List of historic rock festivals *List of music festivals in the United Kingdom *V Festival (Australia) *Virgin Festival *Virgin Radio ==References== ==External links== * * V Festival Forum * Official Virgin Group site * Virgin Corporate Site V Page * V Festival Tickets information * V Festival coverage on Channel 4 * Working at V Festival Category:Music festivals established in 1996 Category:Music festivals in Essex Category:Music festivals in Staffordshire F Category:Recurring events disestablished in 2017 Category:Rock festivals in England Category:Chelmsford Category:1996 establishments in England Category:2017 disestablishments in England ",
