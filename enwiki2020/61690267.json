    "text": "Villena AV railway station (Villena Alta Velocidad) is a railway station serving the Spanish town of Villena in the Valencian Community. Located from the town centre, it is served by the Spanish AVE high-speed rail system, on the Madrid\u2013Levante high-speed rail network. ==History== The station was built in 2013 at a cost of \u20ac11.5 million. It has since been criticised for being one of the least-used stations on the entire AVE network, with 25,859 in 2014. Passengers have increased substantially in the subsequent years, to 92,677 in 2018. ==Access== In 2014 the Province of Alicante allocated \u20ac300,000 to improve road access to the station via the Autov\u00eda A-31. No public transport serves the station, which has been seen as a reason behind its low patronage. ==Services== ==References== Category:Railway stations in the Valencian Community Category:Railway stations opened in 2013 ",
