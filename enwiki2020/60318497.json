MacGregor co-founded the National Women's History Project in 1980 with several other women including Mary Ruthsdotter in order to promote awareness about women's history throughout the United States.

Cooney Jr. He is a frequent contributor to NWHP projects and his work is currently cited on the California Secretary of State page. The NWHP had a major push toward the inclusion of women's history at the K-12 level. MacGregor has been quoted as saying, \"The validation has been the most surprising and overwhelming success of Women\u2019s History Month. It first started at K-12, we had no idea how much effect it would have on the community and government.\u201d In her 1999 article, \"Living the Legacy of the Women's Rights Movement\" published in The Public Historian, she wrote extensively about the widespread interest the NWHP has seen from students and teachers. MacGregor has noted the National Park Service has done extensive work to promote the history of the women's rights movement. MacGregor is frequently asked to speak in public about her work with the NWHP. In 2005 served in a keynote session titled \u201cDemocracy and Women\u2019s Equal Rights - Mutually Exclusive\u201d which celebrated the 85th anniversary of the 19th amendment at the National Constitution Center. == Involvement with the National Women's History Alliance == Molly serves as the Executive Director of the organization which is now known as the National Women's History Alliance.
