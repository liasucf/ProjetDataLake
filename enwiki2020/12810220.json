    "text": "There have been two baronetcies created for persons with the surname Earle, one in the Baronetage of England and one in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. One creation is extant as of 2007. The Earle Baronetcy, of Craglethorpe in the County of Lincoln, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 2 July 1629 for Richard Earle. The title became extinct on the death of the fourth Baronet in 1697. The Earle Baronetcy, of Allerton Tower in Woolton (South Liverpool) in the parish of Childwall in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 3 November 1869 for the businessman and slaver Hardman Earle. The Earle family descends from John Earle of Warrington. His son John settled in Liverpool and served as Mayor of the city in 1709. His grandson Thomas Earle was Mayor of Liverpool in 1787. He was the father of William Earle, Mayor of Liverpool in 1836, and of Sir Hardman Earle, 1st Baronet. In the 1830s, when the British government emancipated the slaves, the Earles were compensated to tune of over \u00a325,000 for the liberation of over 300 slaves over 12 estates across Antigua.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/44886 ==Earle baronets, of Craglethorpe (1629)== *Sir Richard Earle, 1st Baronet (\u20131667) *Sir Richard Earle, 2nd Baronet (died c. 1670) *Sir Richard Earle, 3rd Baronet (died c. 1680) *Sir Richard Earle, 4th Baronet (c. 1673\u20131697) ==Earle baronets, of Allerton Tower (1869)== *Sir Hardman Earle, 1st Baronet (1792\u20131877) *Sir Thomas Earle, 2nd Baronet (1820\u20131900) *Sir Henry Earle, 3rd Baronet (1854\u20131939) *Sir (Thomas) Algernon Earle, 4th Baronet (1860\u20131945) *Sir Hardman Alexander Mort Earle, 5th Baronet (1902\u20131979) *Sir Hardman George Algernon Earle, 6th Baronet (born 1932) :The heir apparent is Robert George Bligh Earle (born 1970) :The heir apparent's heir apparent is Laszlo Thomas Bligh Earle (born 2008) ==Notes== ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
