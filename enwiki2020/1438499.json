    "text": "The front of Brasserie Lipp in Paris A riverside brasserie in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England Brasserie, Groenplaats, Antwerp In France, Flanders, and the Francophone world, a brasserie () is a type of French restaurant with a relaxed setting, which serves single dishes and other meals. The word brasserie is also French for \"brewery\" and, by extension, \"the brewing business\". A brasserie can be expected to have professional service, printed menus, and, traditionally, white linen\u2014unlike a bistro which may have none of these. Typically, a brasserie is open every day of the week and serves the same menu all day. A good example of a brasserie dish is steak frites. ==Etymology== The term brasserie is French for \"brewery\", from Middle French brasser \"to brew\", from Old French bracier, from Vulgar Latin braciare, of Celtic origin. Its first usage in English was in 1864. The origin of the word probably stems from the fact that beer was brewed on the premises rather than brought in: thus an inn would brew its own beer as well as supply food and invariably accommodation too. In 1901 Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language defined \"brasserie\" as \"in France, any beer-garden or saloon\".Davidson, Thomas, comp. Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language. London: W. & R. Chambers; p. 113 In 2000 The New Penguin English Dictionary included this definition of \"brasserie\": \"a small informal French-style restaurant\".The New Penguin English Dictionary ; consultant editor: Robert Allen.
