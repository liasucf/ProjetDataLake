It was Nilsson's most commercially successful work, producing three of his best-known songs. Among these was the number 1 hit \"Without You\", written by Pete Ham and Tom Evans of the group Badfinger. The album was the first of two Nilsson albums recorded in London and produced by Richard Perry. \"Jump into the Fire\" and \"Coconut\", both written by Nilsson, also became hits. The album performed well at the 1973 Grammy Awards, earning a nomination for Album of the Year, while \"Without You\" won the Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.
