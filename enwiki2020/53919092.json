Weinrich's works were focused on the so-called liberation miracles such as the miracles of the Dionysian \"circles\" (e.g. Dionysos' prison escape in the Euripides play Bacchae). The miracles also included the miraculous escape of Moses; two liberations in the text Life of Apollonius of Tyana; and, the divine deliverances in the New Testament's Acts. He was also one of the editors of the Archiv f\u00fcr Religionswissenschaft (ARW). ==References== Category:German philologists Category:1886 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ",
