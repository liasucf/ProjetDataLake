    "text": "\"Feel\" (stylized as \"FEEL.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The fifth track on the album (tenth on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song was written by Lamar and Mark Spears, Sounwave, and produced by Sounwave. The song features bass from bass guitarist Thundercat and vocals from Chelsea Blythe. == Lyrics == The song sees Lamar taking a deeper look into the void and isolation caused by fame and success, specifically how he feels detached from his family and friends. A common recurrence in \"Feel\" is the phrase \"Ain't nobody prayin' for me\", a sentiment that Lamar \"revisits elsewhere\". == Critical reception == In a positive review, writers of Rolling Stone magazine said \"with round, textured notes from the Grammy-winning bass virtuoso Thundercat and a rickety, rim-shot drum pulse, \"Feel\" nods to the live-musician inflections of To Pimp a Butterfly \u2013 or the sixth track from last year's untitled unmastered. Ann Powers of NPR Music also gave a positive review, saying \"Feel\" was the first song that \"jumped out\" at her on Damn. Powers also commented that the song is reminiscent of To Pimp a Butterfly. == Samples == The song contains a sample of the song \"Stormy\" by American musician O. C. Smith from the album For Once in My Life. It also contains interpolations from \"Don't Let Me Down\" by Fleurie from the album Love and War. ==Live performances== Lamar has performed \"Feel\" as an encore on the Damn tour. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official Damn digital booklet. *Kendrick Lamar \u2013 songwriter *Mark Spears \u2013 songwriter, producer, mixing *Thundercat \u2013 bass *Chelsea Blythe \u2013 additional vocals *Matt Schaeffer \u2013 additional guitar, mixing *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mix assistant *Cyrus Taghipour \u2013 mix assistant == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 34 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 32 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by Sounwave ",
