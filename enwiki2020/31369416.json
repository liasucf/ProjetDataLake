    "text": "The bag from a box of wine is known as a \"goon bag\" or \"goonsack\" Goon of Fortune is an Australian drinking game involving cheap cask wine (colloquially known as \"goon\"), played between any number of individual people. The name of the game is a spoof on the TV show Wheel of Fortune. A number of goonsacks are pegged around the outside of a Hills Hoist rotary washing line, and players sit underneath it at the edges. One player spins the hoist, and when the clothesline comes to rest any player underneath a bag must drink an amount of wine agreed upon before the commencement of the spin. Players may not touch the clothesline, and penalties for breaking the rules vary. ==See also== * List of drinking games ==References== Category:Drinking games Category:Australian inventions ",
