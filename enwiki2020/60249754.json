By 1904 Collver began specializing in miniatures and portrait paintings, becoming a prolific and recognized portrait painter of children. Although continuing portrait work throughout her career, she broadened her artwork interests while spending a year (1919 - 1920) in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi as a pupil of Charles Guerino, Bernard Naudin, and Henri Morrissey. While studying in Paris her specialties expanded to include daily life scenes and landscapes.

She married the travel writer Leon L. Collver in 1906 and together they began traveling the world. In addition to portrait painting, Collver's work reflects her experiences in Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, England, the Dalmatian Coast, Jerusalem, Algiers, Cairo, Jamaica and the West Indies. When she was not traveling abroad, she lived in several U.S. cities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Florida. As with her foreign paintings, her domestic daily life paintings reflect those East Coast locations. Whether foreign or domestic, the subject matter of her daily life scenes focused especially on children and women at parks and gardens, at the beach and at marketplaces.\"Exhibitions\", American Art News, August 19, 1922, p 9, JSTOR www.jstor.org/stable 25589769; \"Native Quarter, Kingston, Jamaica - Etching by Ethel Blanchard Collver\", The Christian Science Monitor, Boston, March 6, 1931; Broderick, \"Our Noted Neighbors\", Daily News Graphic, September 12, 1933; M.J.
