It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Krishna Kumari in the lead roles and music composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. The film is based on the Sanskrit Stage drama, M\u1e5bcchakatika by \u015a\u016bdraka of 5th century AD. ==Plot== The film begins around 2000 years ago at Ujjain, Chaaru Datta (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) a renowned artist & well- respected person for his charities, despite impoverishing his wife Aditi (Anjali Devi) & son Rohasena (Baby Prasanti). Vasantha Sena (Krishna Kumari) an expert dancer & musician who protects her chastity though she is born in a courtesan family. Both of them acquainted, enamored and write a poem of romance. Parallelly, Ujjain is ruled by King Palaka who earmarks his lecherous brother-in-law Samsthanaka (S. V. Ranga Rao) as his representative. Samsthanaka keeps an evil eye on Vasantha Sena and aspires to possess her but she refuses. Eventually, anarchy arises in the kingdom due to the waywardness of King Palaka and a revolution is plotted by warrior Aryaka (Satyanarayana). Once Vasantha Sena entrusts her jewelry to Charu Datta for a future meeting which is stolen by a thief Sarvilaka (Relangi) to relieve his lover Madanika (Girija), the maid of Vasantha Sena from imprisonment. In spite of recognizing it, Vasantha Sena sets Madanika free. Here, Charu Datta presents a rare pearl necklace to Vasantha Sena which belongs to Aditi which is more valuable than stolen jewelry. Knowing it, Aditi leaves the house when Charu Datta's friend Maitreya (Balakrishna) warns him that his deeds may lead to catastrophic situations but he Keeps a deaf ear. Right now, Charu Datta accepts Vasantha Sena as his mistress and promises to send her a chariot. At that juncture, Samsthanaka ploys and misleads Vasantha Sena by sending his chariot where he tries to molest her. In that scramble, Samsthanaka assumes Vasantha Sena died when he clearly indicts Chaaru Datta and he is sentenced to death. Just before, Vasantha Sena revives, saves Charu Datta when Aditi also realizes her virtue and accepts her. Simultaneously, Aryaka dethrones Palaka by forming a new state and Samsthanaka is arrested. Thereafter, Aryaka accolades Charu Datta with an important position in his court. At last, Charu Datta pleads pardon from Aryaka on behalf of Samsthanaka showing his generosity. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note. ==Cast== *Akkineni Nageswara Rao as Chaaru Datta *Krishna Kumari as Vasantha Sena *S. V.
