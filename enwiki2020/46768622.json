    "text": "Sti\u010dna Abbey (, also ; , Latin: Sitticum) is the oldest monastery in Slovenia. It is the only Cistercian monastery in the country still operating (the other was Kostanjevica Abbey in Kostanjevica na Krki). Its mother house was Rein Abbey in Austria. == History == The abbey foundation charter was issued in 1136 by Pellegrinus I, Patriarch of Aquileia, although monastic life had begun a year earlier, in 1135. The monastery at Sti\u010dna quickly became an important religious, cultural and economic centre. In addition to an ordinary school, the monastery also operated a music school, where the Renaissance composer Jacobus Gallus is believed to have received his earliest musical education. The successful life of the monastery was hampered by Ottoman raids, and was burned and looted twice. In 1784 Emperor Joseph II abolished the monastery, dissolved under the Josephine Reforms, but it was resettled again in 1898 by monks from Mehrerau Abbey on the shore of Lake Constance. Sti\u010dna abbey has operated continuously since then. === Sti\u010dna manuscript === The monastery's scriptorium was already producing illuminated Latin manuscripts in the 12th century, and it was here that the Sti\u010dna manuscript, written in Slovene, was produced in the 15th century. Valvasor's depiction of Sti\u010dna from 1679 == Architecture == In terms of architecture, abbey has been repeatedly modified, leaving Romanesque and Gothic traces in Baroque buildings. The oldest core of the abbey has been preserved. The abbey has a basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, which serves as a parish church. The abbey and Romanesque basilica are recognized as cultural monuments of national significance. === List of abbots === V.
