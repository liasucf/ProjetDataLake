    "text": "Articles in economics journals are usually given classification codes according to a system originated by the Journal of Economic Literature. The JEL is published quarterly by the American Economic Association (AEA) and contains survey articles and information on recently published books and dissertations. The AEA maintains EconLit, a searchable data base of citations for articles, books, reviews, dissertations, and working papers classified by JEL codes for the years from 1969. A recent addition to EconLit is indexing of economics-journal articles from 1886 to 1968EconLit \u2013 American Economic Association. parallel to the print series Index of Economic Articles.Works cited in the Index of Economic Articles are classified by author and subject. Coverage includes v. 1-7 for 1886\u20131965 and v. 8-36 for each year thereafter to 1996 (per Baylor University Libraries, \"International Business Sources,\" p. 1). ==Structure== ;There are 20 primary JEL categories:: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

JEL code (sub)categories, including periodic updates, are referenced at Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) Classification System. Links to definitions of (sub)categories are at JEL Classification Codes Guide with corresponding examples of article titles linked to publication information, such as abstracts. ==Purpose== Articles in economics journals also list JEL codes (for example JEL: B12), facilitating their use across search engines.
