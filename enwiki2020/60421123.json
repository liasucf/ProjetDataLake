    "text": "Elizabeth Aro is an Argentinean interdisciplinary artist from Buenos Aires. Aro uses fabric to create large scale installation pieces that are site specific. Aro also uses photographs, drawings, and videos in her exhibitions. Many of her works relate to ones perception of space and how one defines home or where they are from. == Biography == Aro was based in Spain for fifteen years, and now works in Milan, Italy where she also lives. Aro has been made a resident artist at many different galleries throughout Europe. Many of her pieces are installations that change the narrative of the original work or that change the viewers perception of the space. For example, in one installation Aro's uses fabric to change the narrative of a sculpture. In several other exhibitions she uses fabric to make it appear as though roots are going into the space. Thus changing the viewers perceptive of the space. Aro has spent many years outside of her home country Argentina, and has lived much of her life as a migrant in European countries. One of Aro's artworks the Red Net series is used to exemplify her time as a migrant and to relate and connect to other people who have lived in similar conditions as her. Aro has done many works relating to immigration, and opened an exhibition in Spain that touched on this topic as well. Her exhibition focused on the lives of immigrants and the hardships they endure. Her exhibition featured photographs of immigrants in the streets. Many of Aro's works are focused on one's relation to home, and the effect moving around has on a person. Aro also finds breaking gender stereotypes important, and would like to see a change in how women are viewed as submissive to men. She is especially interested in breaking from cultural stereotypes and roles men and women are put into. == Education == Elizabeth Aro attended the National school of Fine Arts Prilidiano Pueyrred\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Aro also attended the Universidad Nacional de las Artes (UNA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she majored in art history. == Artworks == === Dreaming in Red, 2019 === Made of deep red velvet. The color, once a symbol of passion and femininity, and a symbol of life that takes root among bronzes and plasters. Branches stretched towards the natural light, escape from the cage, their brilliant color contrasting with the subdued atmosphere of the studio in its shades of white, grey and black. Elizabeth Aro is part of the traditionally feminine heritage of textile and sewing work. This practice, which she subverts, allows her to create monumental pieces with grace and lightness. The artist has appropriated Henry Clews' universe; the branches of the tree evoke the tentacles of his fantastic creatures, and the leaves the plant motifs of his sculptures. It's possible to discover between the foliage the words \"Mirth\", \"Myth\" and \"Mystery\" ===Henry Clew's Cast, 2016=== Brocade fabric stuffed and sewn to make a vine or rope, and added to a sculpture. In this art piece, Aro adds brocade fabric to a sculpture by Henry Clew. Aro uses the fabric to make the main man in the sculpture look like he is holding some kind of rope that leads down to young children that are sculpted into the base of the sculpture. This art piece is meant to change the narrative of an art piece that has already been made by adding to it in some impermanent way. For example, before the addition of the fabric the sculpture had the young children reaching up to the man. With the addition of the fabric it looks as though the main figure is offering a way for the children to ride up to him. ===Santa Sangre, 2015=== Brocade Fabric stuffed and sewn together, done in a solo exhibition with nine other installations. In this piece Aro uses brocade fabric to create what appears to be reddish brown roots coming out of a door. This gives the appearance of nature coming indoors and taking over the space. This can be seen through the size of the roots in relation to the size of the room. With the positioning of the fabric piece it also appears as though the roots are continuing to grow and spread throughout the space. ===Mundo, 2016=== Made of layered felt. This piece is a large, white sphere that is meant to represent the world. The pieces composition is meant to represent the world falling apart. This can be seen through the way the land masses begin to fall south and jumble together. === Estudio de Nubes, 2014-2015 === Fifty-six pencil drawings. This art piece is a series of drawings of clouds, which the artist uses as a way to demonstrate time and memory. This is done through the way each column follows one part of the sky as it changes. The artist finds time and memory to be an integral part of her life, and associates time and memory with her experience of moving form one country to a new foreign one. === Ulivo, 2016 === Brocade fabric and cotton sewn together. This art piece is a sculpture in the shape of an all white tree. It is meant to symbolize life and the circle of life. The roots seen at the bottom of the piece are meant to visually symbolize the trees connection to the underworld. While the high reaching branches are meant to demonstrate its connection to the heavens or the celestial. This art installation piece often dominates the space that it is in due to its grand size. === Provvisorio per Sempre, 2013 === Made of fabric, skillfully sewn in white brocade and hold by a wooden structure. The installation, inspired by the 1961 movie \"La Notte\" of Michelangelo Antonioni, refers to a state of mind in which the built of our life is emotional and intuitive, a dimension that make us feel fragile about we thought we knew. === Red Net, 2009- 2017 === In this installation Elizabeth Aro analyses the appearance of cheating or deception, using a structure of an entangling net which is as delicate as consistent. With this, it shows a psychological dimension, thanks to the formal behaviour of the fabric used (velvet). The process of the spatial occupation of filaments gives the whole work a sense of internal rhythm, which are arises some plots, suspenden in the air and anamorfic shapes on the surface. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === *1999 Galeria Arteara, Madrid *2000 Instituto de America de Santa Fe, Granada *2001 De la Gente y el Paisaje, Casa Rivadavia, Cadiz *2002 Elizabeth Aro.
