Self-taught in violin and piano, he attended Juilliard and began his career playing on Thore Ehrling's radio band. He started visiting the US in 1954, first playing at The Beehive house band in Chicago, and working with Terry Gibbs for a year. He then played with Lars Gullin, before returning to the US in 1957 to rejoin Gibbs. He performed as a member of Teddy Wilson's group, along with Gene Ramey and Al Lucas; they recorded several Columbia LPs, and was originally nicknamed Bert by Wilson.
