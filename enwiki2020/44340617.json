Amidst mutual accusations between the Baleztenas and the Pamplona Ayuntamiento, most of the objects ended up in the Baleztena house. Once Dolores Baleztena became the general depositary, she started to make the objects available on various periodical displays and exhibitions. They were seized from one of them by Euskalherriko Karlista Alderdia, a vasconavarrese branch of Partido Carlista, in 1975. The Baleztena family lost the ensuing lawsuit against EKA. Thirty years later some of the objects were donated by EKA to Museum of Carlism, where they are currently on display.

Cuadernos de Antropolog\u00eda-Etnograf\u00eda, 26 (2004), pp. 781-802; first attempts to vandalise Carlist monuments, like graffiti on the Pamplona Monument of the Fallen walls, started to appear in the mid-1960s, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, Navarra y el carlismo durante el r\u00e9gimen de Franco: la utop\u00eda de la identidad unitaria, [in:] Investigaciones hist\u00f3ricas: \u00c9poca moderna y contempor\u00e1nea 17 (1997)p. 302 Baleztena's interest in feasts and customs is peculiar as it combined three different approaches: this of a scientist (anthropologist, historian, ethnographer, who pursues impartial scholarly studies),Baleztena was active in Principe de Viana and contributed some scholarly works (e.g. Toponimia del t\u00e9rmino de Pamplona, [in:] Actas de la I Reuni\u00f3n de Toponimia Pirenaica, Zaragoza 1949), though in general he tended to underline his amateurish stance and to mock scientists and scientific realm with all its rituals: conferences, lectures, universities, grades, professors, faculties, books, scientific articles etc; he was a rare guest at the Etnologia Vasca faculty at Universidad de Navarra, headed by Jos\u00e9 Miguel de Barandiar\u00e1n this of a politician (who shapes popular customs as vehicles of propagating own set of values),for a sample see El Siglo Futuro 31.10.1935, available here; it is worth noting that he fell short of directly contributing to the wartime propaganda; he is not mentioned in Francisco Javier Caspistegui, \"Spain's Vendee\": Carlist identity in Navarre as a mobilising model, [in:] Chris Ealham, Michael Richards (eds.), The Splintering of Spain, Cambridge 2005, , pp. 177-195 and this of a participant (who genuinely enjoys the feasts, contributes to them and takes part in them).he demonstrated vivid interest only in carnivalesque, ludic forms of entertainment closely related to folk customs, with much less focus on opera, drama theatre (except puppetry), literature etc Some scholars classify his approach as \"costumbrismo nost\u00e1lgico\", which exalted religiosity and viewed modernising changes with anxiety.Dronda Mart\u00ednez 2013, pp. 21-22 Some consider it a strategy of disseminating authoritarian discourse, which by means of cultural identification mobilised the society along conservative lines, a process similar to those employed by the Nazis in the Weimar Republic.Javier Ugarte Teller\u00eda, Un episodio de \"estilizaci\u00f3n\" de la pol\u00edtica antirrepublicana: la fiesta de San Francisco Javier de 1931 en Pamplona, [in:] L. Castells (ed.), El rumor de lo cotidiano, Estudios sobre el Pa\u00eds Vasco contempor\u00e1neo, Bilbao 1999, pp. 159-182. In his other work, La nueva Covadonga insurgente: or\u00edgenes sociales y culturales de la sublevaci\u00f3n de 1936 en Navarra y el Pa\u00eds Vasco, Madrid 1998, , 9788470305313, Javier Ugarte Teller\u00eda makes repeated parallel references to Carlism and Nazism, e.g. comparing alliance between Carlism and upper strata to alliance between NSDAP and plutocracy (p. 38), Navarrese social fabric to East Prussian social fabric (p. 40), Requete standby of July 36 to SA standby in January 1933 (p. 148), Traditionalist means of cultural mobilization to Nazi means of cultural mobilization (p. 160), Navarrese conservative stronghold to Bavarian conservative stronghold (p. 231), mechanism of Spaniards embracing authoritarism to mechanisms of Germans embracing authoritarism (p. 245), the role of Bible to the role of Mein Kampf (p. 250), Carlists dumping electoral strategy to Hitler dumping insurrectionist strategy (p. 262), provocative Requete demonstrations to provocative SA demonstrations (p. 273), marginalization of socially radical Carlist aetistas to marginalization of socially radical Rohm faction in SA (p. 293, 426), Navarrese sense of foralism to German sense of Heimat (p. 306). Ignacio Baleztena is mentioned by Ugarte as a politician and \"extravagant figure\" rather than as a man of culture. Another author highlighting similarity between Carlist and Nazi cultural policy advances a somewhat competitive thesis, namely that the two promoted not traditional, but modern means of social mobilisation, named \"reactionary modernism\", see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, Parad\u00f3jicos reaccionarios: la modernidad contra la Rep\u00fablica de la Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista, [in:] El Argonauta Espanol 9 (2012), available here Some present it as means of maintaining traditional Navarrese identity.Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 03.06.14, compare also Caspistegui 1997, esp. p. 314 ==Vasc\u00f3logo and Vasc\u00f3filo== Euzkadi; Aberri Eguna 1933 Baleztena's mothertongue was Spanish;his father spoke Basque as his mothertongue; his mother, Mar\u00eda Dolores Asc\u00e1rate Echeverr\u00eda, was bilingual (her father was castellano-speaker, her mother was Basque-speaker), Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 12.04.11 he spoke Basque with some difficulty, though he understood Basque very well.Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 14.04.11 Due to his childhood spent in Leitza, he was well accustomed and indeed fascinated by the Basque culture. Faced with the new phenomenon of Basque national drive, he opposed it with traditional vision of Basque identity;according to his son, Baleztena was guided by 3 ideas: to preserve Vasco-Navarrese traditions, to confront the Basque nationalism, and to promote Catholic and Traditionalist perspective, Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 01.03.12. His amateurish and politicized approach to Basque ethnicity paradoxically brought him close to scholarly anthropological work of Caro Baroja, who denied that persistence of uniform Basque culture over considerable geographical area and throughout all the time is shown by a mere fact that a few vestiges were found that pertained to a Basque cultural cycle, see Jesus Azcona, To Be Basque and to Live in Basque Country The Inequalities of Difference, [in:] Carol J.

Some suggest the Baleztenas took advantage of paralysis of Carlist governing bodies and pushed with the unification, see Javier Ugarte Telleria, El carlismo en la guerra del 36: la formaci\u00f3n de un cuasi-estado nacional-corporativo y foral en la zona vasco-navarra, [in:] Historia Contemporanea 38 (2009). pp. 69-70. Penas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 265-7, 270 quotes Ignacio saying that except the monarchical issue, there were no major discrepancies between Carlism and Partido Unico; anxious to stay loyal to Don Javier, Baleztena agreed that for the time being national interest demanded compliance. Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 288-9 claims that the Baleztenas pressed Don Javier to accept the unification. The latest work, Mercedes Pe\u00f1alba Sotorr\u00edo, Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul, Estella 2013 does not mention either of the Baleztenas when describing the amalgamation process (though see p. 132). Some claim that the Baleztenas contested the intransigent opposition to unification of Fal Conde, but Don Javier kept considering them loyal, as he authorised Joaqu\u00edn to enter the Falangist Consejo Naci\u00f3nal, see Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, pp. 38-40, 49. It remains undisputed that in July 1937 Don Javier entrusted Baleztena with reorganisation of Navarrese Carlism, see Aurora Villanueva Martinez, Organizacion, actividad y bases del carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo [in:] Geronimo de Uztariz 19 (2003), p. 101 though it soon evolved into opposition;he engineered ice-cold welcome of Franco during his visit to Pamplona in the autumn of 1937, Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 05.03.13 contesting Carlist amalgamation into Movimiento,Baleztena participated in the Carlist efforts to save El Pensamiento Navarro from amalgamation in the Francoist propaganda machine; the plot consisted of converting the party newspaper into a paper owned by a shareholding company by creating Editorial Navarra; out of 600 shares, de Rodezno held 200, Arellano 150 and Baleztena brothers 50 each, Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez Calleja, La prensa carlista y falangista durante la Segunda Rep\u00fablica y la Guerra Civil (1931-1937), [in:] El Argonauta espa\u00f1ol 9 (2012), p. 29 he brusquely rejected Franco's blandishments.Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 18.9.13 During the Second World War the Baleztenas helped the French refugeesespecially members of the French Resistance, though also fleeing Jews, providing shelter in Pamplona, Leitza and other locations, Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entries 16.10.13, 25.01.14; see also Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, pp. 266-8. Among the refugees there was Enrique Roberto Fernando Mar\u00eda Luis Felipe de Orleans, the French pretendent to the throne, see ABC 22.10.13 and demonstrated anti-Axis sympathies.the Baleztenas entertained the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare in 1941, which was sort of political demonstration aimed against Spain joining the Axis, Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 01.03.14; the Baleztenas opposed the apparently the pro- German stance taken by El Pensamiento Navarro, see Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, pp. 263-264; for an opposite anti-British view, see here They are usually considered members of the intransigent \"bando falcondista\",Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, p. 856, though there are other views. Villanueva Mart\u00ednez 2003, p. 105 claims that Baleztena asked Fal to accept his resignation in 1942. Vazquez Prada 2012, p. 1131-3 presents the Baleztenas as pursuing an \"independent\" line until Joaqu\u00edn was replaced as Navarrese jefe in 1957, though as late as the early 1960s he was appointed by Don Javier to represent Navarre in a planned Junta Foral Vasco-Navarra though Ignacio made also some conciliatory gestures towards Francoism.in November 1937 Ignacio Baleztena was nominated member of Comisi\u00f3n Depuradora, entrusted with purging Navarrese libraries; moreover, he represented Delegaci\u00f3n de Cultura de la F.E.T. y de las J.O.N.S. in this body; the commission reported completing its works in September 1938; the issue is not clear as Baleztena was on the frontline at that time, see Reyes Berruezo Alb\u00e9niz, Depuraci\u00f3n de bibliotecas y censura de libros en Navarra durante la Guerra Civil de 1936, p. 57 available here; during the 1942 crisis, triggered by the Bego\u00f1a incident, Ignacio insisted Carlists do not withdraw from the Pamplona ayuntamiento, Villanueva Mart\u00ednez 2003, p. 106. For confrontation between Carlists and the Falangists civil governors see Alvaro Baraibar Etxeberria, La Navarra sotto il Franchismo: la lotta per il controllo provinciale tra i governatori civili e la Diputacion Foral (1945-1955), [in:] Nazioni e Regioni, Bari 2013, In the late 1940s the Baleztena brothers strived to rebuild clandestineMartorell Per\u00e9z 2009, p. 199 or semi- officialsome scholars consider Hermandad de Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, founded by Baleztena as religious pilgrimage group, an attempt to create semi- official Carlism organisation, Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, pp. 190-191 Carlist structures, both counted among Navarrese Carlist leaders.in 1953 Fal talked to him on reconstruction of Carlist network, Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, p. 344. The Baleztena grip on Navarrese Carlism is sometimes dubbed caciquismo, see Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 160 In 1952 Ignacio engineered one of the most humiliating snubs that Franco had to take.Franco visited Pamplona to open new housing quarters and was scheduled to speak from the balcony of the Ayuntamiento building. Despite lavish decorations elsewhere, the neighboring Baleztena house was all closed and seemed abandoned, with immense portrait of San Francisco Javier on its facade. The bottom line of the message was manifestation of support to the Carlist regent, Don Javier. Indignant Franco cut down his speech to a minimum; the Baleztenas received threats from the Falangist Frente de Juventudes afterwards, Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, p. 343. As late as 1954 he occasionally went into hiding, having been easy target of Falangist vengeance.Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, p. 349 Carlist standard The Baleztenas voiced against a union with Juanistas,Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog, entry 27.06.13; the Baleztenas voted against publishing Ecto de Estoril in Pensamiento, Mercedes V\u00e1zquez de Prada Tiff\u00e9, El papel del carlismo navarro en el inicio de la fragmentaci\u00f3n definitiva de la comuni\u00f3n tradicionalista (1957-1960), [in:] Principe de Viana 2011, p. 402 which did not necessarily amount to endorsing Don Javier's claim to the throne.in 1941 Samuel Hoare understood from the Baleztenas that they were - under some conditions - prepared to accept Don Juan as a Carlist claimant, see Samual Hoare, Complacent Dictator, London 1947, p. 141; during the emotional sessions of early 1956, Joaquin (the brothers are always referred to as very close to each other) addressed Don Javier \"de Alteza\", while the others used the \"de Majestad\" form, see Lavardin 1976, p. 27. The position of the Baleztenas is summarised by the author as \"poca consistencia\". Joaquin was also opposed (as the only member of the Navarrese junta) to Carlos Hugo appearing in Montejurra in 1957, Lavard\u00edn 1976 p. 40, and the family were not sure what to expect of him, Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 160 In the mid-1950s they criticised Fal Conde as too conciliatory towards Francoism.by some the Baleztenas are counted among \"los guipuzcoanos\", a group (including also Antonio Arrue, Lascurain, marques del Valle de Santiago, Pablo Iturria, the young Larramendi, Gambra) which maintained personal rather than political rivalry with Fal, who was nevertheless accused by them of inactivity and inefficiency, see Lavardin 1976, p. 15 Some scholars claim that they engineered a plot to remove Fal,Mercedes V\u00e1zquez de Prada, El nuevo rumbo pol\u00edtico del carlismo hacia la colaboraci\u00f3n con el r\u00e9gimen (1955-56), [in:] Hispania: Revista espa\u00f1ola de historia 69 (2009), p. 185, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2011, p. 1115. In 1955 the Baleztenas were closely in touch with Don Javier, who even visited Leitza around the time he dismissed Fal, Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 24. The same author claims the Baleztenas were criticised by younger Carlists for as running a clerical policy; a phrase was coined against them \"menos accion catolica y mas accion carlista\" though his actual dismissal and new course adopted by Carlism suited the competing \"unionistas\"the pro-Juanista Carlists like Arauz de Robles or Rafael Olaz\u00e1bal criticised Fal as too rigid, see Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, pp. 392-393; Joaquin was dismissed in 1957 as his intransingent stance towards Francoism was incompatible with the new Carlist policy, Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 160 faction more. When the Huguistas appeared on the scene in the late 1950s, the Baleztenas seemed rather skeptical.In 1963 the Baleztenas hosted princess Alicia, than 87, which was viewed as counterweight to the Carlos Hugo sister, princess Maria Teresa, at that time spending a year in Pamplona, see Lavard\u00edn 1976, pp. 160, 163. Though they lent some support to Carlos Hugoe.g. in 1964 Dolores Baleztena defended Irene, the newly wed wife of Carlos Hugo, Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 220 and maintained cordial relations with the Carlist claimant Don Javier until the late 1960s,in 1968, weeks before his expulsion from Spain, Don Javier stayed in Leitza visiting Ignacio Baleztena, Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 284 they confronted the progressives when power struggle erupted within Carlism in the mid-1960s.though due to their age, the Baleztenas were at the sidelines of current politics; the most comprehensive work on the issue, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias : el carlismo, 1962-1977, Pamplona 1997, , 9788431315641 does not mention Ignacio Baleztena at all; for confrontation of different cultural visions see Josep Miralles Clement, Aspectos de la cultura pol\u00edtica del carlismo en el siglo XX, [in:] Espacio, tiempo y forma 17 (2005), pp. 147-174, esp. the chapter La experiencia juvenil y estudiantil; see also MacClancy 2000 The last success of the Baleztenas was regaining control over El Pensamiento Navarro in 1970,following removal of Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual Iba\u00f1ez as editor-in-chief after his 4-year tenure, see La Vanguardia 26.08.1970 available here, also Martorell Per\u00e9z 2009, pp. 470-471; the partisan Huguista perspective in Josep Carles Clemente, Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo, Barcelona 1977, , esp. the chapter El \"affaire\" de \"El Pensamiento Navarro\", pp. 63-71. Four years earlier Baleztena considered Pascual an appropriate candidate for leading the paper and endorsed him, Mercedes V\u00e1zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi\u00f3n. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967), Madrid 2016, , p. 304. It is worth noting that in 1968 Joaqu\u00edncho Baleztena intervened with Manuel Fraga to get Pascual released from jail, ABC 22.10.13 available here; for details see Rosa Marina Errea, Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual y \"El pensamiento navarro\": \"con \u00e9l llego el esc\u00e1ndalo\" (1966-1970), Pamplona 2007, , 9788477681922 a short-lived victoryanother crisis in El Pensamiento Navarro followed in 1971, see La Vanguardia 21.12.1971 available here as early 1970s Ignacio was expulsed from the socialist-dominated Partido Carlista.Josep Carlos Clemente, Breve historia de las guerras carlistas, Madrid 2011, p. 248, the paragraph titled Ignacio y Joaquin Baleztena, caciques de Franco en Navarra; Clemente 1977, p. 68 does not mention Ignacio and claims that it was his brother and his two sons who were expulsed in July 1970 ==See also== * Carlism * Joaqu\u00edn Baleztena Asc\u00e1rate * Basque nationalism * Pamplona * Leitza * San Ferm\u00edn * Gigantes y cabezudos * romeria * Oriamendi ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Mar\u00eda Teresa Alcocer Sanz, \"Iru\u00f1erias\" de Ignacio Baleztena [MA thesis in Periodismo, Universidad de Navarra], Pamplona 1983 * Ignacio Baleztena Ascarate entry at Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia online * Mar\u00eda Teresa Alcocer Sanz, BALEZTENA ASC\u00c1RATE, Ignacio entry at Gran Enciclopedia Navarra online * Javier Baleztena Abarrategui, Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog online * Jaime del Burgo, BALEZTENA [ASCARATE], Ignacio entry, [in:] Cat\u00e1logo bio-bibliogr\u00e1fico, Pamplona 1954 * Manuel Martorell P\u00e9rez, La continuidad ideol\u00f3gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia], Valencia 2009 ==External links== * Baleztena by his son at Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog * Baleztena on Geni genealogical service * Baleztena on Gran Enciclopedia Navarra * Baleztena by del Burgo * Baleztena on euskomedia * Oriamendi in Basque video * Oriamendi in Spanish video * Pamplona Cabalgata de Reyes official site * Javierada 2014 video * Cabalgata de Reyes in Pamplona 2013 video * Muthiko Alaiak web page * Muthiko Alaiak performing 2013 video * official municipal sanfermines website * Baleztena house assaulted 1932 by contemporary press * Baleztena house assaulted 2012 by contemporary press * progressist movie vision of Leitza (playing Alsasua) July 36 * Ignacio Baleztena named fascist * Ignacio by his daughter * contemporary Carlist propaganda video Category:1887 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Carlists Category:Ethnographers Category:Francoist Spain Category:People of the Spanish Civil War Category:Spanish anti-communists Category:Spanish essayists Category:Spanish male writers Category:Spanish historians Category:Spanish lawyers Category:Spanish military personnel of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Category:Spanish monarchists Category:Navarre culture Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Category:People from Pamplona Category:Spanish politicians Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:Spanish songwriters Category:Roman Catholic writers Category:20th-century historians Category:University of Salamanca alumni Category:20th-century essayists Category:20th-century lawyers ",
