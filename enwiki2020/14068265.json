    "text": "James Carmody Lankton (August 25, 1884 - October 24, 1942), known professionally as James C. Morton, was an American character actor.James C. Morton bio at threestooges.net He appeared in 187 films between 1922 and 1943. ==Career== Born in Helena, Montana, Morton is best known to modern audiences as the hapless soul whose toup\u00e9e was often removed at the most inopportune times. Perhaps the best known example of this embarrassment is in the Three Stooges film Disorder in the Court, in which Larry Fine's violin bow yanks Morton's hairpiece off. The Stooges then misinterpret the toup\u00e9e as a wild tarantula, leading Moe Howard to grab a pistol from a court bailiff and shoot it.Disorder in the Court at threestooges.com Another example is in the 1935 Our Gang short Beginner's Luck where Morton is a piano accompanist to the amateur talent in a neighborhood kids' show, and the Rascals\u2014causing all kinds of raucous disarray in the front row\u2014knock off his toup\u00e9e with a gust of air; Morton turns to them saying, \"You kids are beginning to get into my hair!\" Morton also appeared as the bartender who provides Oliver Hardy with a wooden mallet to shut up Stan Laurel singing \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\" in the film Way Out West. Morton appeared in many Hal Roach productions, playing supporting roles with Our Gang and Laurel and Hardy, and also played a small role in Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. On the Los Angeles stage Morton played the title role of Tik-Tok in The Tik-Tok Man of Oz (1913), by L. Frank Baum, Louis F. Gottschalk, Victor Schertzinger and Oliver Morosco. In the early 1910s Morton appeared in a vaudeville and burlesque duo, Morton & Moore, with actor Frank Moore, playing at the Alhambra Theatre in Harlem and in The Merry Whirl on Broadway.\"Week's offerings at theatres\", The New York Times, August 23, 1910 (pg. 9)The Merry Whirl ibdb.comVaudeville Old & New \u2013 An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America.
