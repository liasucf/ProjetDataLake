In their second season under head coach Bert Clark, the Cougars compiled a 7\u20133 record (2\u20131 in AAWU, third), and outscored their opponents 139 to 103. The team's statistical leaders included Tom Roth with 1,257 passing yards, Larry Eilmes with 818 rushing yards, and Doug Flansburg with 578 receiving yards. The Cougars played only three conference games, all against Northwest teams, defeating Oregon State and Oregon. With several close margins in their games, they became known as the \"Cardiac Kids.\" WSU dropped both rivalry games this season: the Battle of the Palouse at home to Idaho, and the Apple Cup to Washington in Seattle, which eliminated a possible Rose Bowl berth. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL and AFL Drafts== This was the final year for separate drafts; both were held on November 27, 1965. ===NFL=== No Cougars were selected in the 1966 NFL Draft. * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ===AFL=== One Cougar was selected in the 1966 AFL Draft. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- |Wayne Foster |Tackle |12 |107 |Oakland Raiders |} : ==References== ==External links== *Game program: Villanova vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 October 9, 1965 *Game program: Arizona vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 October 16, 1965 *Game program: Oregon at WSU \u2013 November 6, 1965 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Washington ",
