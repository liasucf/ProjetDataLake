    "text": "Elisabeth of Lorraine Elisabeth of Lorraine and Maximilian I Coat of arms of Elisabeth as Electress of Bavaria Elisabeth of Lorraine (9 October 1574 \u2013 4 January 1635), was a Duchess and an Electress consort of Bavaria by marriage to Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. ==Life== Elisabeth was a daughter of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine in his marriage to Claude of Valois. On 9 February 1595, in Nancy, she married her cousin Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. Their marriage was childless due to Elisabeth's sterility, which was a cause of suffering. Her relationship to her spouse was described as good and harmonious despite fertility issues. Elisabeth is described as a very devout Catholic, who devoted a lot of her time to her religious duties, and became known for her ascetic life style. As newly married, she was seen as vivid and jolly, but she became more melancholic and depressive by age. Maximilian gave no political influence or tasks to Elisabeth, but she spent a great deal of effort on charity. She died after a long period of illness. Maximilian married again only a few months after her death, eventually siring the long awaited heir to his Electorate. ==Ancestry== ==See also== *Dukes of Lorraine family tree ==References== Category:1574 births Category:1635 deaths Category:Electresses Palatine Category:Duchesses of Bavaria Category:Electresses of Bavaria Category:House of Lorraine Category:People from Nancy, France Category:Princesses of Lorraine ",
