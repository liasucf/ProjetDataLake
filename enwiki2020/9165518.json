    "text": "The Parc des Combes is a park located in Le Creusot, in Burgundy, France. The park is essentially wooded, and constitutes one of the most touristy spots of the town, mainly thanks to its tourist train, called Train des combes. The French word Combe can be translated as anticlinal valley, given that the park is located on an old Morvan valley. On the top of the hill, near the tourist train station, there is a roller coaster and karting. ==External links== * Parc des Combes - official site Category:Geography of Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire Category:Amusement parks in France Category:Buildings and structures in Sa\u00f4ne- et-Loire Category:Tourist attractions in Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire ",
