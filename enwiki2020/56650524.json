The band emerged from Cathercist founded by former Wild Fire guitarist Taylor Roberts. After Cathercist lost some band members they recruited new ones, which changed the band's musical direction. As a result, the band no longer felt comfortable performing under their original name and changed it to Wild Fire. Before this transformation, Cathercist had released two albums titled The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer and As Hope Expires. Wild Fire released their single, \"Villain\", on November 5, 2015, which was later included on their debut album released on May 23, 2017, titled Revolt. With this release, they also announced the end of Cathercist. Revolt contains 15 tracks, one of them a cover of Dr. Hook's \"The Cover of Rolling Stone\", the album's final track. On March 29, 2018, Wild Fire announced in a Facebook post about an upcoming acoustic record and revealed that Taylor Roberts would be leaving the band.

It evolved from the band Cathercist, which had been active for five years according to an article in the Sun Herald. Former Wild Fire guitarist Taylor Roberts founded Cathercist in Gulfport, Mississippi, but the exact date of the band's beginning is unclear. On their official page on ReverbNation the band says Cathercist was founded in 2007, but on their biography on Last.fm the date is given as 2008. Sources say the band was officially established in 2010. During an interview, Roberts said the band was founded in 2005\u20132006. They appeared at the 2008 Taste of Chaos concert where they opened for Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, and Bullet For My Valentine. This indicates the band was active prior to 2010 and before Sawyer joined as the lead vocalist. The band adapted their name from the word \"catharsis\", which they defined as purging or cleansing oneself through music or art. Cathercist released their debut album titled The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer in 2011. The name represents the change Sawyer went through in the process of making the album. It was recorded in Argo, Alabama, at Echelon Studios, and was produced, mixed and mastered by Joseph McQueen. The band released their second album As Hope Expires on May 24, 2013. They began recording it a week after the release of their first album. It consists of eight tracks, four of which appear on Revolt, Wild Fire's 2017 debut album. The instrumentals were recorded in Miami at Bieler Bros. Studios over the course of a week and the vocals were recorded in Wisconsin. Matt LaPlant produced, mixed and mastered the album.

After the announcement, Cathercist's official website was taken down, and their Facebook account was renamed \"Wild Fire\". When Sawyer was asked how Wild Fire emerged from Cathercist, he responded saying: > Taylor Roberts and myself were working on our record with our band > Cathercist for a couple of years and then we lost some members. We were > still continuing to work on it, but by the time the record was written, with > the new people involved, it was just a different sound. It was something > new, something we wanted to push forward with and something we really loved. > It's not like we thought our fans didn't like it\u2014we just didn't feel > comfortable continuing under the same name. There were a lot of twists and > turns to get where we looked up and said 'we need to change the name. It's > time'.

During an interview, former guitarist Taylor Roberts said: \"We\u2019re too hard to be hard rock but we\u2019re not hard enough to be metal, so we\u2019re kind of a nice little in-between [...] we hate labeling the genre that we\u2019re in. We play music and we like to have a good time.\" After Roberts left the band, Sawyer and Voss both announced that they will no longer be genre specific. After the announcement, some fans were led to believe that Wild Fire will be abandoning hard rock. Sawyer said: > We haven\u2019t left the old sound behind exactly. People who love music tend to > love all kinds of music. We\u2019re just showing off a different side to our > musical interests. The hard rock is not gone. This was just something we had > to do. [\u2026] It just means we\u2019re going to do whatever we want with little to > no regard for what we\u2019ve done in the past. It means that we\u2019re a rock band > that can do anything. If I want to write an acoustic song, I will. A pop > song, a rap song, a country song. It means this band will fulfill all of our > musical endeavors instead of making side projects to fulfill those ideas. > We\u2019re still making rock music. The band is known for using classical instruments like pianos and strings on their songs, especially on the Revolt record.
