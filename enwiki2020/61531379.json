Film critic Anne T. Donahue of Globe and Mail gave the film 3 and half stars out of four, saying, \"It is a movie that\u2019s as defined by what one\u2019s heart can endure as much as it is by its mesmerizing sport, its acting and how long it will stay with you. Knuckle City cannot be overlooked.\" Courtney Small of In The Seats gave it a 4/5 stars and praised the fresh take on traditional genre tropes, saying \"Bathed in a sea of poverty and corruption, Knuckle City challenges traditional notions of masculinity to expose how toxic and destructive it is. Spreading like a virus, the sins that the brothers\u2019 inherited from their father are part of a greater systemic problem impacting the township of Mdantsane. Unflinchingly gritty, Knuckle City brings a fresh South African take on traditional genre tropes. Engulfed in beautiful cinematography that is both sweeping and intimate, Qubeka shows that actions to uplift family, and not endanger them, is what real manhood is all about.\" ==See also== * List of submissions to the 92nd Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film * List of South African submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film * Cinema of South Africa ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 crime films Category:South African films Category:South African crime films Category:Xhosa-language films ",
