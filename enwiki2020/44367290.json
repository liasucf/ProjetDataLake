Universe of Sound allowed visitors to take a leap into space in the company of Gustav Holst, Strauss, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti and Stanley Kubrick, with two concerts, a free digital installation and family activity day. The exhibition took place over three weeks, showing what it is like to be part of the Philharmonia Orchestra, and provided a chance for people of any ability to have a go at conducting The Planets through an interactive installation. This gave the chance to explore the orchestra from the inside out using touch screens, movement-based interaction and planetarium-style full-dome projections. == References == Category:Grade II listed buildings in Birmingham Category:Office buildings completed in 1933 Category:Centenary Square, Birmingham Category:Grade II listed banks ",
