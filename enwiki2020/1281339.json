His motto was: \"School as much as possible! School as good as possible!\" The constitutional text on education, as it was formulated on March 29, 1923 was based on the principles of freedom of education, compulsory primary education and free primary education. He contributed to the adoption of the Law on the state primary education and of the normal-primary education of June 26, 1924, to the uniformity of the education system in Romania. In 1925, he established baccalaureate examinations. Over time, relations with Ion I.C. Bratianu improved, and Dr. Angelescu was next to him in the moments after the assassination attempt in 1904 and in the last hours of his life in 1927, when he closely supervised the medical-surgical treatment he had given. After the assassination of Prime Minister Ion G. Duca, he was for four days interim prime minister, forced to give way to Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu.
