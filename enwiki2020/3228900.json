    "text": "SIMH is a highly portable, multi-system emulator which runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and OpenVMS. It is maintained by Bob Supnik, a former DEC engineer and DEC vice president, and has been in development in one form or another since the 1960s. == History == SIMH was based on a much older systems emulator called MIMIC, which was written in the late 1960s at Applied Data Research.\"Preserving Computing's Past: Restoration and Simulation\" Max Burnet and Bob Supnik, Digital Technical Journal, Volume 8, Number 3, 1996. SIMH was started in 1993 with the purpose of preserving minicomputer hardware and software which was fading into obscurity. == Emulated hardware == Version 6 Unix for the PDP-11, running in SIMH Version 7 Unix for the PDP-11, running in SIMH \"4.3 BSD UNIX\" from the University of Wisconsin, on a simulated VAX. SIMH emulates hardware from the following companies. === Advanced Computer Design === * PDQ-3 === AT&T; === * 3B2 === BESM === * BESM-6 === Burroughs === * B5500 === Control Data Corporation === * CDC 1700 === Data General === * Nova * Eclipse === Digital Equipment Corporation === * Alpha * PDP-1 * PDP-4 * PDP-7 * PDP-8 * PDP-9 * PDP-10 * PDP-11 * PDP-15 * VAX Family Systems ** MicroVAX I, VAXStation I ** MicroVAX II, VAXStation II ** MicroVAX 3900 ** VAX 11/730 ** VAX 11/750 ** VAX 11/780 ** VAX 8600 === GRI Corporation === * GRI-909 === Hewlett-Packard === * 2116 * 2100 * 21MX * 3000 === Honeywell === * H316 * H516 === Hobbyist projects === * N8VEMhttp://www.schorn.ch/altair_5.php === IBM === * 1401 * 1620 * 1130 * 650 * 701 * 7010 * 704 * 7070 * 7080 * 7090/7094 * System/3 === Intel === * Intel systems 8010 and 8020 === Interdata === * 16-bit series * 32-bit series === Lincoln Labs \u2013 MIT Research Lab === * TX-0 === Manchester University === * Baby, or SSEM === MITS === * Altair 8800 both Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 versions === Royal-Mcbee === * LGP-30 * LGP-21 === Sage Computer Technology === * Sage II === Scientific Data Systems === * SDS 940 === SWTPC === * SWTPC 6800 === Xerox Data Systems === * Sigma == References == == External links == * * * Additional VAX/MicroVAX models for SIMH * Running VAX/VMS Under Linux Using SIMH * Debian Package * FreeBSD Port * UNIX: Old School.
