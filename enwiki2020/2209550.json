    "text": "Abd Manaf al-Mughirah ibn Qusai (, Abd Man\u0101f al-Mugh\u012brah ibn Qu\u1e63ayy) was a Qurayshi and great-great-grandfather of Islamic prophet Muhammad. His father was Qu\u1e63ai ibn Kil\u0101b. ==Biography== Abd Manaf was already honoured in his father's lifetime however Qusai preferred his first-born 'Abd ad-Dar and invested him with all his rights, powers, and transferred the ownership of the House of Assembly shortly before his death. == Father's death == After Qu\u1e63ayy's death, Abd Manaf contested this inheritance. He was supported by their nephew Asad, their uncle Zuhrah ibn Kilab, their father's uncle Taym ibn Murrah (of Banu Taym), and al-Harith ibn Fihr, while 'Abd ad-Dar was supported by their cousins Makhzum, Sahm, Jumah, their uncle Adi and their families. The effects of this conflict continued among their descendants, especially under Abd Manaf's son Hashim and affected the internal history of Mecca right up to Muhammad's time. ==Family== Abdu Manaf married several wives of influential tribes, including '\u0100tikah bint Murrah ibn Hil\u0101l ibn F\u0101lij ibn Dhakw\u0101n ibn Hilal ibn Sa'sa'ah ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Bakr ibn Hawazin al-Hilaliyya of Bani Qays Aylan, Hilal of the Banu Bakr ibn Haw\u0101zin, Raytah of Ta'if, and Waqida bint Amr. == Origin of tribes of Quraysh == Abd Manaf had three wives: 1\\.
