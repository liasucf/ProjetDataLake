    "text": "Out of the Silent Planet is the debut studio by the American progressive metal band King's X, released in 1988. The title of the album comes from that of a book by C.S. Lewis, an author favored by band members Ty Tabor and Jerry Gaskill. \"Out of the Silent Planet\" is also the title of the first track from the follow up album Gretchen Goes to Nebraska. The cover art features the skyline of Houston with the southern outline of the state of Texas. The album received widespread acclaim from music contemporaries. Pantera bassist Rex Brown commented of his and Dimebag Darrell's impressions, noting \"Dime called me and said, \u2018Dude, have you heard this? Have you checked out King\u2019s X?'\u201d he says. \u201cWe went on a long road trip, and we must have listened to that first record I don\u2019t know how many times. And we couldn\u2019t stop. \u2026 This was the sound that Dime and I were always looking for.\u201dhttps://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kings-x-book-oral- history-greg-prato-799843/ ==Track listing== All songs written by Gaskill/Pinnick/Tabor, except \"Sometimes\" and \"Far, Far Away\" written by Pinnick/Tabor/Gaskill/Marty Warren. ==Personnel== ;King's X *Doug Pinnick \u2013 vocals & bass *Ty Tabor \u2013 guitar & vocals *Jerry Gaskill \u2013 drums & vocals ;Production *Sam Taylor - producer *Steve Ames - engineer *Bob Ludwig - mastering at Masterdisk, New York *Jon Zazula, Marsha Zazula - executive producers ==Charts== ;Album {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"center\"|Year !Chart !Peak position |- |align=\"center\"|1988 |align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (US) |align=\"center\"|144 |} ==Accolades== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
