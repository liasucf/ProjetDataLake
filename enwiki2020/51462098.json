    "text": "In plastics processing, dip molding is a process of shaping of plastics by moulding. The coating of components with PVC has many applications. Plastic dip moulding is a technique where metal parts are coated with a plastic vinyl material. It is used to protect and make the metal parts more resistant to scratches and abrasions. == Applications == The main applications are the gloves, balloons, bellows... == Materials == Plastisol is the most used material for dip moulding because it is easy to use and affordable. Other materials are used, such as latex, leneoprene, polyurethanes, silicones and even epoxy. == Operating Mode == The plastic can be heated or not according to their physical state at room temperature. In the case of a powder, the plastic is fluidized. The following steps constitute the dip moulding process: * mould heating; * heated mould dipped into the plastic material; * removal of the mould; * excess drainage; * drying or curing of the plastics material still attached to the mould if it contained a solvent or was based reagents (monomers, prepolymers) reagents; * cooling of the plastic still attached to the mould; * releasing of the part from the mold after its solidification. The part may need to be submerged several times to give the desired thickness. == Control of the thickness == To control the thickness of the workpiece, it is important to control the following settings: * the mould temperature: higher the temperature, higher the thickness of the workpiece. * the temperature of the material; * the speed dipping of the mould; * the duration of the immersion: this time increases the thickness of the workpiece. * the output speed of the mould: this speed increases the thickness of the workpiece. == Advantages and disadvantages == Dip moulding presents advantages and disadvantages. === Advantages === * low investment cost; * low cost of production; * different possible thicknesses without the need to change the mold; * complex parts can be removed easily from the mold thanks to their elasticity; === Disadvantages === * relatively slow process; * control of the thickness is difficult. == See also == * Dip-coating ==References== Category:Plastics industry ",
