By 2016, England had a national championships to support the national team and was active in participating in the IFCPF World Championships. National team development is supported by an International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football (IFCPF) recognized national championship. Recognized years for the national IFCPF recognized competition include 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. In 2016, after getting an endorsement by the World AntiDoping Agency (WADA), the IFCPF Anti- Doping Code was formally amended to allow for out of competition testing. This was done through a WADA approved Whereabouts Programme managed through ADAMS. Drawing from players in a Registered Testing Pool, players from this country were included ahead of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. == Ranking == In 2016, England was ranked seventh in the world by the IFCPF.
