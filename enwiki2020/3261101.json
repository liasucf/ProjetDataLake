The northern boundary is marked in red and the others are the three main roads. ==History== Formerly part of Fitzroy, the suburb is thought to be named after the original grantee of that area, one John Batty Thorngate. Arriving from Gosport, Hampshire, Thorngate was granted his land in 1840. ==Geography== Thorngate is one of Adelaide's smallest suburbs. It is bounded to the north by Carter Street, to the south by Fitzroy Terrace, in the west by Prospect Road and the east by Main North Road. The only other streets in the suburb are Churcher Street and Thorngate Street. ==Demographics== The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 180 persons in Thorngate on census night. Of these, half were female. The majority of residents (76.7%) are of Australian birth, with an additional 6.7% identifying Greece as their country of birth. The age distribution of Thorngate residents is similar to that of the greater Australian population. 64.4% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 35.6% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. ==Politics== Thorngate is in the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Adelaide and the Australian House of Representatives division of Adelaide. The local electoral booths tend to swing strongly to the Liberal Party, even though the electoral district to which Thorngate belongs is historically marginal or leaning to the Labor Party. ==Facilities and attractions== A BP service station sits on the corner of Carter Street and Main North Road. ==Transportation== ===Roads=== Thorngate is serviced by Main North Road and Prospect Road, which link the suburb to both Adelaide city centre and the northern suburbs. ===Public transport=== ====Buses==== The suburb is serviced by the following bus routes: *G10 *221, 222 *224, 226F, N224 *225 *228 *229 *209F ==See also== *List of Adelaide suburbs ==References== ==External links== * Category:Suburbs of Adelaide ",
