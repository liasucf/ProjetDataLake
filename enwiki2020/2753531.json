The school was established in 1976. == Academics == The median GPA at University is 3.54 with a grading scale of A\u2013F, including plus or minus.

Upper Campus is the oldest and most historic part of campus. It was designed by Julia Morgan and built in 1917 to house Katherine Delmar Burke School, a girls' school, from the early part of the 20th century until 1975, when the building was sold to the newly created University High School. It houses the History and English Departments, College Counseling offices, and administrative offices. Middle Campus, connected to Upper Campus by a bridge, houses the school library; a 400-seat theater; the student center and cafeteria; state-of-the-art science labs; music rooms, including an electronic music recording room; and the Summerbridge program, UHS's pioneer program to help talented students from local public middle schools obtain the resources they might not have access to in their current schools. Lower Campus is home to the Math and Science Departments. It also holds the fitness center, changing rooms, gym, and athletic offices. Indoor sports are played at the gym, while field sports are mainly played at the nearby Paul Goode Field athletic complex. South Campus, which opened in the 2006\u20132007 school year, is the home of the Foreign Language Department and the Art Department. Additionally, South Campus contains a language lab, a large photography studio and darkroom, and art studios. ==Notable alumni== ===Writers=== *Ethan Canin, author *Ben Casnocha, author *Vendela Vida, author ===Professional athletes=== *Tyler Walker, MLB baseball player, Washington Nationals ===Artists and musicians=== *Tauba Auerbach, artist *Slater Bradley, video artist *Ari Gold, filmmaker, actor, musician *Hollis, musician *John Morris, actor *Nicky Sanders, musician Steep Canyon Rangers *Sol Sender, graphic designer *Deke Sharon, a cappella musician, producer *Olivia Somerlyn, musician *Maury Sterling, actor *George Watsky, musician, poet, internet phenom *Erin Cressida Wilson, playwright, screenwriter, author *Ali Wong, comedian ===Business=== *Peter Saraf, film producer ==See also== *San Francisco County high schools ==References== ==External links== * Category:High schools in San Francisco Category:Educational institutions established in 1973 Category:Private high schools in California Category:Preparatory schools in California ",
