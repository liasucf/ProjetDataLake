    "text": "The Tanganekald people were an indigenous Australian people of South Australia. ==Country== The Tanganekald lay to the southeast of the Jarildekald and occupied , predominantly about the narrow coastal strip along Coorong. Norman Tindale gives the following precise locations, based on detailed work with his informant, Clarence Long (Milerum), the last full blooded adult survivor of the Tangane. > from Middleton south to Twelve Mile Point (north of Kingston); inland only > to about inner margin of first inland swamp and dune terrace, the Woakwine > or 25 foot (7.5 m.) terrace, usually no more than 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16 > km.); on islands in Lake Alexandrina, except eastern and western extremities > of Hindmarsh Island; around Meningie at south and of Lake Albert, at Salt > Creek and Taratap (Ten Mile Point). A distinction was made between (a) te\u014bgi - the sandy grassed limestone slopes just back of the pandalapi (Coorong lagoon) where they fished and favoured for camping, as was the southern seaward side, the pari\u014bari, protected by the natunijuru, duned sandhills between them and the seashore (jurli) - and the inland mallee and swamps, known as lerami, which were good for hunting. The introduction of intensive pastoral practices, with sheep and cattle livestock, and rabbits, wrought havoc on the traditional Tanganekald landscape, leading one aged informant to grieve that, > 'Our maldawuli (ancestors) told us, long, long ago, to 'beware of ants'. > Whitemen must be the 'ants' he spoke of, for he has eaten away all my > people, my herbs, my game, and even my sandhills.' ==Social organisation== The consisted of some 22 bands. * Kondoliorn. (lit. 'whale men', composed of kondoli (whale) and -the suffix -orn(a contraction of korn meaning 'man, person') ==Culture== Tindale recorded and transcribed many Tanganekald songs from Milerum, several of them bawdy. One story cycle describes legends associated with the people the Tanganekald regarded as having lived in their land before their arrival. These people, the Thakuni, inhabited the lagoons around the Robe district's limestone coastal area. They could render themselves invisible at will, and were the object of particular horror for their piercing eyes, which could, at a mere glance, kill a person. They could only be observed by making swift slanting gazes. These people were said to have finally driven out of their habitats by the ancestral forefathers of the tribe, who managed to drive them into the sea. There they were transmogrified either into jagged limestone boulders on the outer reefs, or became fairy penguins. ===Mythology=== According to Tanganekald belief ancestral human-like beings, the \u014aurunderi and others, collectively referred to by the term maldawuli, were responsible, together with \u014baitje, (totemtotemic animals, consisting mostly of birds) for the creation of the landscape they now inhabit. One story in this sequence, whose events are associated with a crater near McGrath Flat homestead, concerns an aged woman, Prupe, and her sister Koromarange, both of the Marntandi clan. Growing sightless, Prupe had turned cannibal and had eaten almost all of the district's children, save one, her sister's granddaughter Koaka\u014bgi. To save her grandchild and stave off Prupe's intrusive foraging for her, Koromarange would bring her sister food. This only made the latter suspicious and, as she went blind, she thought of taking the child to harvest her eyes so she might regain her sight. While the grandmother was netting fish, Prupe managed to kidnap her young ward, who had revealed her presence by crying out for water, and took her back to her camp. When Koromarange realized what had happened, she followed their spoors and came across Prupe, who was about to extract Koaka\u014bgi's eyes. Feigning fatigue she asked her sister to fetch her some restorative water, giving her a pierced skull as a water-dish, causing Prupe to lose time ladling in the water, while Koromarange contrived a snare nearby, and fled with the child. On discovering the deception, Prupe rushed forth, only to be trapped in the snare, and, kicking some live coals as she lashed out, was incinerated. The intensity of the fire caused a crater to be formed on the spot where she camped. Thus, Koromarange and her grandchild Koaka\u014bgi managed to get back to their beach camp ==Social organization== The Tanganekald were divided into the following clans:- {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
