The Transhumanist Party has been featured or mentioned in many major media sites, including the National Review, Business Insider, Extreme Tech, Vice, Wired, The Telegraph, The Huffington Post, The Joe Rogan Experience, Heise Online, Gizmodo, and Reason. Political scientist Roland Benedikter said the formation of the Transhumanist Party in the USA was one of three reasons transhumanism entered into the mainstream in 2014, creating \"a new level of public visibility and potential impact.\" === November 2016 - 2018 === Following the end of the 2016 presidential election, after Zoltan's 2016 presidential campaign was completed, Gennady Stolyarov II became the Chairman of the party and the organisation was restructured.

In October 2017 Hank Pellissier founded the \"Transhuman Party\" following a trademark dispute with Zoltan Istvan's continued ownership of the 'Transhumanist Party' trademark. In response to Pellissier, the U.S. Transhumanist Party published its FAQ, where a significant portion was devoted to explaining the history of the U.S. Transhumanist Party, its current interactions with Zoltan Istvan and the scope of his involvement, and the reasons for his continued ownership of the 'Transhumanist Party' trademark. The Transhuman Party became defunct in late 2017 due to lack of activity and its domain name and Facebook page were acquired by the US Transhumanist Party.

More generally, the goal is to raise awareness among the general public about how technologies can enhance the human species. Democratic transhumanists and libertarian transhumanists tend to be in disagreement over the role of government in society, but both agree that laws should not encumber technological human progress. The Transhumanist Party platform promotes national and global prosperity by sharing technologies and creating enterprises to lift people and nations out of poverty, war, and injustice. The Transhumanist Party also supports LGBT rights, drug legalization, and sex work legalization. The party seeks to fully subsidize university-level education while also working to \"create a cultural mindset in America that embracing and producing radical technology and science is in the best interest of our nation and species.\" In terms of foreign policy and national defense, the party wants to reduce the amount of money spent on foreign wars and use the money domestically. The party also advocates managing and preparing for existential risks, completely eliminating dangerous diseases, and proactively guarding against abuses of technology, such as nanotechnology, synthetic viruses, and artificial intelligence. The various policy points of the US Transhumanist Party's platform have attracted both praise and criticism from sociologist Steve Fuller. For example, Fuller has praised the centrality of morphological freedom in the US Transhumanist Party's bill of rights, but on the other hand he has also written that the party is too critical of the US Department of Defense, which he argues could be an ally for some transhumanist initiatives such as human enhancement and existential risk reduction. In 2018 the party as a whole was reviewed favorably as an example of a successful \"niche\" party by Krisztian Szabados, a director at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. ==International analogs== The Transhumanist Party in Europe is the umbrella organization that supports the national level transhumanist parties in Europe by developing unified policies and goals for the continent. Among them is the UK Transhumanist Party, which was founded in January 2015. In October 2015, Amon Twyman, the party's leader at the time, published a blog post distancing the UK party from Zoltan Istvan's campaign. ==References== ==External links== * US Transhumanist Party - Official Website *Ben Zion 2020 Official Campaign Website *US Transhumanist Party - Historic website Category:Transhumanist organizations Category:Transhumanist politics Category:Life extension organizations Category:Political parties established in 2014 ",
