    "text": "The Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies (IPR) is an interdisciplinary institute and center of The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. ==History== Aquinas Hall was the original home of the Life Cycle Institute. It now houses the School of Philosophy as well as The American Catholic History Research Center and University Archives. The Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies has its roots in the Boys Town Center for the Study of Youth Development. In 1972, Boys Town had been found to be sitting on funds of nearly $300 million while serving only 200 residents in its Catholic-run home for wayward boys in Omaha, Nebraska. In response to the scandal, the Boys Town board of trustees agreed to widen the organization's mission to include research on youth development. From 1974 to 1982, Boys Town funding at the University supported graduate students, post- doctoral fellows, research stipends, support staff, a new building (now Aquinas Hall) and tremendous growth in the National Catholic School of Social Service, the School of Theology and Religious Studies, and the departments of Anthropology, Human Development, and Sociology in the School of Arts and Sciences. An interdisciplinary center known as the Life Cycle Institute [LCI] was also founded with Boys Town funding by one of the University's leading professors of sociology, Dean R. Hoge. The LCI soon became known for its empirical research on community, youth, and political demographics and served as The Catholic University of America's original internal think tank. McMahon Hall is the current home of the institute. The second-oldest building on campus and built in 1895, McMahon Hall also houses the central academic offices and the dean's office of the School of Arts and Sciences. Renamed the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies in 2009, the think tank continues to bring rigorous academic research to bear on contemporary questions of interest to policy experts and faith communities.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbCT1m3qi3k == Mission == The Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies now serves the University as an interdisciplinary policy research center whose fellows, scholars, research associates, and students provide timely analysis of policy issues relevant to the life of the Church, the Catholic University of America, legislators, scholars, professionals, and concerned citizens, including the media. IPR also provides an interdisciplinary forum that welcomes and encourages participation and active collaboration among scholars, professionals, and experts from a variety of disciplines, institutions, and faith traditions. The lectures, conferences, symposia, round-tables, and working groups of the Institute provide research that supports print and electronic publications, multimedia, and other means to share our research with the public, the Church, policymakers, media, and interested scholars. == Current Work of the Institute== The Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies organizes, facilitates, and sponsors policy analysis, empirical research, and publications focused on the policies that govern the public and private-sectors. It has organized hundreds of symposia, conferences, round- tables, debates, lectures, and publications, each of which was carefully designed to bring rigorous academic research to bear on contemporary questions that lie at the intersection of law, religion, and policy, including through close collaboration with lawmakers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the greater Washington, DC area. The Institute is currently divided into interdisciplinary working groups, where each IPR Fellow, scholar, or associated professional agrees, in writing, to collaborate with his or her colleagues to complete a policy research project and to disseminate its results to interested members of the community. Current working groups are focused on the areas: * Human Rights as they relate to the work of Eastern Christian communities, the problems of genocide, human trafficking, the challenges to privacy, the place of religion in the public square, and restorative justice. * Professional Ethics, specifically as it relates to the Catholic Church in crisis. * Foreign Affairs, including national security and intelligence, permanent neutrality and its role in international peace, security, and justice, and the current challenges of disinformation and asymmetrical warfare. * Integral Human Development and issues surrounding community renewal, fetal alcohol syndrome, and mental health policies at the local, state, national, and international levels. == The Keane Medallion== The Keane Medallion as presented in 2016 The Institute's highest honor, the Bishop John Joseph Keane Medallion, is awarded annually. The medallion is named in honor of John Joseph Keane, the first rector of The Catholic University of America who was instrumental in locating the University in Washington, DC. The Medallion was crafted to honor individuals for lifetime service reflecting the vision of the Institute. The Latin inscription reads: Academia, Patria, Ecclesia. ===Recent Keane Medallion Winners=== * 2017: Ralph McCloud, Director of the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops * 2016: Dr. Carolyn Woo, President and CEO, Catholic Relief Services * 2015: Mary Ann Glendon, former United States Ambassador to the Holy See * 2014: Cardinal Theodore E.
