    "text": "Pigment violet 23 is an organic compound that is a commercial pigment. It is member of the dioxazine family of heterocyclic compounds, but derived from carbazoles.Chamberlain, Terence \"Dioxazine violet pigments\" from High Performance Pigments Edited by Smith, Hugh M. 2002, 185\u2013194. It is prepared by condensation of chloranil and 3-amino-N-ethylcarbazole. It has a centrosymmetric angular structure.Panina, N.; van de Ven, R.; Verwer, P.; Meekes, H.; Vlieg, E.; Deroover, G. \"Polymorph prediction of organic pigments\" Dyes and Pigments 2008, volume 79, 183\u2013192. For many years, the structure was assigned, incorrectly, as having a \"linear structure\" (EC no. 228-767-9, CAS RN 6358-30-1) which differ in terms of the carbazole ring fusion. Pigment violet 23 is prepared by condensation of an aniline with chloranil.Horst Tappe, Walter Helmling, Peter Mischke, Karl Rebsamen, Uwe Reiher, Werner Russ, Ludwig Schl\u00e4fer and Petra Vermehren \"Reactive Dyes\"in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.
