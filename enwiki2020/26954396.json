    "text": "The Pedo-repair RNA motif is a conserved RNA structure identified by using bioinformatics. It has been detected in only one species of bacteria: Pedobacter sp. BAL39, within the phylum Bacteroidetes. The motif might be in the 5\u2032 untranslated regions of operons containing genes predicted to be involved in DNA repair or related to restriction enzymes. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cis-regulatory RNA elements Category:Non-coding RNA ",
