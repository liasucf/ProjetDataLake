    "text": "Grant Colfax Tullar (5 August 1869-1950) was an American minister, composer, and hymn writer. Tullar was born on August 5, 1869 in Bolton, Connecticut. His parents named him after President Ulysses S. Grant and Vice President Schuyler Colfax. Tullar's mother died when he was two, and his father was disabled from the Civil War, so he had a rough childhood. Tullar became a Methodist in 1888 at a Methodist camp meeting. From there, he attended Hackettstown Academy in New Jersey, going on to be a Methodist minister in Dover, Delaware. In 1893, he helped found the Tullar-Meredith Publishing Company in New York City, where he composed and produced church and Sunday school music in hymns and hymnals. Perhaps his most famous is the poem \"The Weaver,\" commonly referred to as \"The Tapestry Poem.\" This work gained popularity through it being one of the favorites of Corrie ten Boom. In fact, the connection between ten Boom and this poem runs so deep that many people mistakingly attribute the poem to her instead of Tullar. == References == Category:People from Bolton, Connecticut Category:1869 births Category:1950 deaths ",
