Guit\u00e9 pursued further studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze and research at the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional in Mexico. She also studied archaeology and art history in Crete and Rhodes. In 1956, with her husband, painter Alberto Tommi, she founded the Centre d'art de Perc\u00e9. Guit\u00e9 was invited to the Venice Biennale of 1958. In 1975, she was elected into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Centre d'art de Perc\u00e9 ==Career== Best known as a sculptor, from 1956 to 1960, she painted murals; she also created paintings and tapestries. Guit\u00e9 created a large sculpture called Maternit\u00e9 aux jumeaux for Expo 67. As a sculptor, she believed in listening to her materials and carefully selected the wood and stone used in her works. In her work, she explored universal themes relating to humanity's interaction with the universe and was influenced by the art created by ancient civilizations, especially pre-Columbian art. Her work appeared in exhibitions held at the Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al and the Mus\u00e9e Rodin in Paris. Guit\u00e9's art is included in private, corporate and public collections, including the National Gallery of Canada and the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec. ==Death and recognition== She was murdered by her second husband, who was from Jamaica, during a stay in Mexico. Guit\u00e9's life was chronicled in \"S. Guit\u00e9 La force tranquille\", an episode in the documentary series Histoires oubli\u00e9es. The Espace culturel Suzanne-Guit\u00e9 and Place Suzanne-Guit\u00e9 in New Richmond were named in her honour. == References == Category:1927 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Sculptors from Quebec Category:Canadian women painters Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Category:People murdered in Mexico Category:Murdered artists Category:20th-century Canadian women artists ",
