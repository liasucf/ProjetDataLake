The Shantinath temple, out of the view, would have been on the left During the Chandela rule, many towns in Bundelkhand, including Khajuraho, were home to large and flourishing Jain communities. At Khajuraho the Jains apparently lived on the east side of town. A number of Jain temples from that period have survived in this part of Khajuraho in various states of preservation. Many Jain inscriptions from the Chandela period can be seen at Khajuraho.B. L. Nagarch, Jaina Inscriptions of Khajuraho, Dr. Hiralal Jain Smriti Granth, 2001 All the Jain temples are now enclosed within a modern compound wall constructed in the 19th century, with the exception of the Ghantai temple, when the restoration of the temples was initiated. These temple are part of UNESCO World Heritage Site along with other temples in Khajuraho Group of Monuments.Khajuraho Group of Monuments UNESCO World Heritage Site There is also an archaeological museum where historical Jain artifacts from the chandella period are preserved. A key difference between the Jain temples and most other Khajuraho temples is that the Jain temples are alive with active praying and worship. Digambar Jain monks still visit time to time and can be seen meditating, studying or preaching.\u0916\u091c\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u0909\u092e\u0921\u093c\u093e \u091c\u0928\u0938\u0948\u0932\u093e\u092c, Patrika-Jul 17, 2018Ahead of polls, Shivraj Singh Chouhan announces to set up cow ministry in mp, Rajendra Sharma, TNN, Sept 30, 2018 ==Temples== Two of the large temples still stand in a good state of preservation in the original form. The portico of the Adinath temple is a later addition. The enclosed Shantinath temple houses a massive monolithic Shantinath image. It also incorporates at least one other Chandella period temple. To the east of these temples are several small Chandella temples that have been restored using masonry. The temple complex underwent restoration in 1870 AD, when a Gajarath festival was organized by Kanchhedtilal Jain of Nagaur marking a renewal of the site accompanied by installations of new images, as indicated by the inscriptions.M.N.P. Tiwari, Khajuraho Ka Jain Puratattva, Varanasi, 1987, p. 19 The stone structures were stabilized using masonry and the Shantinath temple was constructed incorporating two Chandella period temples. There is a museum called Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain Samgrahalaya right outside the main compound constructed in 1984 to house sculptures of historical and artistic merit. There is a dharmashala to the south for the pilgrims. A number of Jain inscriptions from the Chandella period have been found in Khajurao. The earliest is the Samvat 1011 (AD 954) in the Parshvanath Temple,Jaina inscriptions of Khajuraho, B.L Nagarch, p. 69-75 and the last is Samvat 1234 (1177 AD, it is also the last Chandella era inscription in KhajurahoReport of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa in 1874-75 and 1876-77,Alexander Cunningham, V.

During the time of Kirttivarman (reigned c. 1060\u20131100 CE), the capital shifted to Mahoba, and Khajuraho declined. The Jain activity resumed around samvat 1915 (1858 AD), when the temples were repaired and installation of new images was restarted. === Parshvanath Temple === This temple contains an inscription dating from 954 AD by its builder Pahila, mentioning donation of gardens and requesting future generations to safeguard the temple.
