In August 2019, El Segundo, California-based Beyond Meat partnered with KFC for a plant- based chicken nugget. It is the first fast-food chain to introduce a plant- based meat after partnering with Beyond Meat. == Product == The company decided to replace chicken with a plant-based meat-like product. One alternative is pea-protein mixed with soy, rice flour, carrot fiber, yeast extract, vegetable oil, salt, onion and garlic powder. Nuggets and boneless wings are offered. It was released in US with prices ranging from $6 to $12. == History == KFC launched the plant-based food with the help of Beyond Meat in response to customer requests. A KFC restaurant in Atlanta first tested a product called \"Beyond Fried Chicken\" in 2019. The product sold out in 5 hours, and outsold a week's worth of popcorn chicken sales. A tweet by KFC after the sell out called it a \"Kentucky Fried Miracle\". == Reaction == PETA praised KFC's decision and said that \"We\u2019re hopeful that KFC\u2019s Beyond Fried Chicken test marks a new era for the company and that when it sees how much consumers value animals\u2019 lives, it will work to make changes in its supply chain as well\". == Health effects == Whole Foods CEO John Mackey stated \"it's not great for your health\", because it contains sodium and saturated fat. ==References== Category:KFC Category:Products introduced in 2019 Category:Meat substitutes ",
