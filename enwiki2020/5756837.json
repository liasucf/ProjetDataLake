His depictions of California's missions were partially responsible for the revival of interest in the state's Spanish heritage. ==Early life and education== Ute camp, by 1894 Ford was born in Livonia, New York. He studied art in Paris and Florence late in the 1850s. During the Civil War, he was a soldier assigned to prepare illustrations of interest to the military. After the war, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, where, in 1871, his studio was destroyed in the \"Great Fire\". ==Work in California== In 1875, he settled in Santa Barbara, California, where he would live out his days. Ford traveled by horse and buggy to each of the twenty-one Spanish missions in California, where he created a historically important portfolio of watercolors, oils, and etchings.Bells and crosses of the Mission Inn and the Ford Paintings of the California Missions [1908?], \u2013 available as a digitized version, and which includes a reference to the paintings of the California Missions done by Ford. His depictions of the missions were (in part) responsible for the revival of interest in the state's Spanish heritage, and indirectly for the restoration of the missions themselves. In 1883, Ford published his Etchings of the Franciscan Missions of California, and exhibited his works at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. The hallmarks of Ford\u2019s images are exquisite brushwork and tonal mastery in all mediums, which make his works highly prized. Ford died in 1894 in Santa Barbara. ==References== ==External links== * Santa Barbara Historical Society * Henry Chapman Ford (1828-1894) Etcher & Painter * Category:1828 births Category:1894 deaths Category:American illustrators Category:Spanish missions in California ",
