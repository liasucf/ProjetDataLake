The name is likely derived from the Welsh graean, \"gravel\", and rhyd, \"ford\": there is still a ford across the River Terrig on a minor road east of the village.The ford is at a place called Rhyd-y-Ceirw (\"ford of the stags\"). There are several limestone and silicate quarries in the immediate area, which is on the borders of the Clwydian Range Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; the Clwydian Way footpath runs nearby. The area is predominantly agricultural with a landscape of woods and pastureland.
