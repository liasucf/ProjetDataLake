Along with her work in academia, Thompson has worked as a speaker, consultant, and trainer for several companies. == Research and work == Thompson's research is focused on the topics of creativity, innovation, teamwork and social psychology. She has also done considerable research on negotiation, focusing on how men and women negotiate, how to improve negotiation skills and the role of emotions in negotiation. === Negotiation === Since the beginning of her career, negotiation has been a focus of Thompson's research. Initially her work on negotiation was focused on why managers often fail to reach win-win negotiation agreements. She wrote her first paper in the area in 1988 titled 'Groups as Mixed Motive Negotiations' in Advances in Group Processes: Theory & Research. In the 1990s her research discussed biases in negotiation, behavior and negotiation, and how training, experience, and feedback impacts negotiation skills. She spent most of the 1990s researching and writing about negotiation. Some of her work during this time also included perceptions of fairness in negotiation, and negotiations in teams.Thompson, L. & Loewenstein, G. (1992). Egocentric interpretations of fairness and negotiation. Organization Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 51, 176-197. In 1998, Thompson wrote the book The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator. The book discusses on how people can negotiate better. Used as an undergraduate and graduate course book, it has been translated into Mandarin, Portuguese and Korean. The 7th edition of the book was published in 2019. In the early 2000s, Thompson began studying the impact of gender on negotiation skills.Kray, L., Thompson, L., and Galinsky, A. (2001). Battle of the sexes: Gender stereotype confirmation and reactance in negotiations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80 (6), 942-958. She also wrote about how negotiation can be taught and learned as a skill. Some of her research during the early 2000s in this area dealt with how emotion influences negotiation behavior and outcomes.Anderson, C. & Thompson, L. (2004). Affect from the top down: How powerful individuals' positive affect shapes negotiations. Organizational Behavior & Human Decision Processes, 95 (2), 125-139. In 2006, Thompson edited the book, Negotiation Theory and Research and in 2008 she wrote the book, The Truth About Negotiations. Published by Financial Times Press, the book has been translated into six languages. The second edition of the book was published in 2013. In the early and mid 2010s, Thompson's research in this area returned to teams and negotiation. In the late 2010s, Thompson conducted research on how divergent and convergent thinking can impact negotiation performance. In 2018, she conducted further research on how negotiation differs for men and women. Her research highlighted that men lie in negotiations more often than women because men approach negotiation as a competition whereas women approach it as an opportunity to build connection. === Groups, teams and creativity === In 1996, Thompson wrote a chapter titled 'Conflict in Groups', published in Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles. It marked the beginning of her research on team and group performance. She wrote about group decision making and social cognition in groups in the late 1990s. Later she conducted research on the factors that impact creativity in groups and how it can be improved.Thompson, L. (2003). Improving the creativity of organizational work groups. Academy of Management Executive, 17 (1), 96-109. In 2000, she wrote the book, Making the Team: A Guide for Managers. The book explains how teams should be designed to function optimally. It also highlights the skills needed to become a productive part of a team. Making the Team's 6th edition was published in 2017. It has been translated into Korean and Russian. In 2001, she wrote the book Tools for Teams. She was the co-editor of the 2007 book Conflict in Organizational Groups: New Directions in Theory and Practice. In the late 2000s, Thompson conducted research on creativity in groups and organizational teams. She collaborated with Hoon-Seok Choi to produce an edited book, Creativity and Innovation in Organizational Teams. In the late 2010s, some of her work in this area dealt with the topic of conflict in groups and creativity in groups. In 2013, she wrote a paper titled 'Why Teams Need a Creative Conspiracy for Success'. The paper led to the 2013 book titled The Creative Conspiracy: The New Rules of Breakthrough Collaboration. In the book she described collaborations that are conscious, planned and focused on creativity as a creative conspiracy. The book discusses keys to the kind of collaboration which makes teams more effective and how leaders can get their teams to be more creative. Reviewing the book, BussinessLIVE wrote that \"her advice is practical and is applicable to everything from start-up teams trying to come up with new ideas to musicians working together to advertising account executives and creative directors developing pitches.\" Some of her research in this area has focused on brainstorming and how brainstorming can be made more productive. Her research highlighted that a session of brainwriting before brainstorming can increase the number of ideas generated as well as the creativity of ideas. Her research in this area has also highlighted that people can be primed for creativity by asking them to share embarrassing stories prior to brainstorming session. === Organizational behavior and social psychology === Thompson has conducted research and written about various topics in organizational behavior and social psychology aside from her work on negotiation, teams and creativity. Her early work in this area has dealt with the evaluation of events, perception of justice, fairness and conflict resolution.Thompson, L. & Nadler, J. (2000). Judgmental biases in conflict resolution and how to overcome them. In M. Deutsch & P. Coleman, (Eds.) Handbook of constructive conflict resolution: theory and practice, Ch. 10, 213-235. Thompson co-edited the book Shared Cognition in Organizations in 1999. The book was a compilation of articles on the topic of shared knowledge. Administrative Science Quarterly reviewed the book positively and wrote that \"perhaps the most admirable feat achieved in this book is the breadth of perspectives presented.\" In 1999, Thompson began a collaboration with cognitive psychologists Jeffrey Loewenstein and Dedre Gentner to study analogical reasoning in managers. Her article, 'Avoiding missed opportunities in managerial life: Analogical training more powerful than individual case training' marked the beginning of several research projects focused on how to help managers apply knowledge from classroom training to business situations.Thompson, L., Loewenstein, J. and Gentner, D. (2000). Avoiding missed opportunities in managerial life: Analogical training more powerful than individual case training. Organization Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), 60-75. In 2003, she edited the book The Social Psychology of Organizational Behavior: Key Readings. It featured a number of articles in the field of organizational behavior, with focus on micro-organizational behavior. In 2008, Thompson wrote the book Organizational Behavior Today. The book explains key organizational behavior concepts such as the influence of people on organizations, differences between leadership and management, teamwork and levels of communication. The book has been translated into Mandarin. In early 2010, some of Thompson's work was focused on envy at workplace and decision making in organizations.Menon, T. and Thompson, L. (2010). Envy at work. Harvard Business Review, April, 74-79. In 2016, she wrote the book Stop Spending, Start Managing: Strategies to Transform Wasteful Habits. Co-authored with Tanya Menon, the book discusses people-related problems that organizations face. Menon and Thompson interviewed one thousand managers and executives to collect data for the book. They discuss five spending traps - The Expertise Trap, The Winner\u2019s Trap, The Agreement Trap, The Communication Trap, and The Macromanagement Trap - that managers often fall into and how to avoid such situations. She discussed the key findings of the book in a Google author talk in 2017. === Online & virtual learning === Towards the end of 1990s, owing to the increase in the use of technology, some of Thompson\u2019s research examined electronically-mediated negotiations and how analogical encoding affects negotiation.Thompson, L., & Nadler, J. (2002). Negotiating via information technology: Theory and application. Journal of Social Issues, 58 (1), 109-124. She conducted an initial experiment examining how managers negotiate differently using email versus face-to-face negotiations. She conducted more studies that examined texting versus email negotiations.Morris, M., Nadler, J., Kurtzberg, T. & Thompson, L. (2002). Schmooze or lose: social friction and lubrication in e-mail negotiations. Group Dynamics, 6 (1), 89-100. In 2015, Thompson created a 'video-shorts' series that provided 3-minute practical advice to managers on how to brainstorm, negotiate, and develop team charters. Soon after, Thompson developed a sub-hour best practice video series called, \u201cNegotiation 101\u201d and \u201cTeamwork 101\u201d that was also publicly available. In 2015, Thompson developed a MOOC titled High Performance Collaboration: Leadership Teamwork and Negotiation. The course available through Coursera teaches leadership skills, negotiation strategies and team management. In 2019, Thompson developed and launched an interactive course called, 'Negotiating in a Virtual World'. She launched this in the full-time MBA program at Kellogg and also at the executive level. == Personal life == Thompson has two sons and one daughter. She is an avid cyclist. She is a USA cycling national time trial champion. In 2010, she won a masters time trial championship at the world level. == Awards and honors == *1989 - S.
