He made 21 league appearances, scoring five goals, and also played in all six FA Cup matches as Saints reached the semi-finals, losing to Wolverhampton Wanderers who went on to take the cup in the final. Smith suddenly collapsed and died, shortly before his 29th birthday in July 1908. ==References== ==External links== *Aston Villa profile at Aston Villa Player Database Category:1879 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Preston, Lancashire Category:English footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Leyland F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players ",
