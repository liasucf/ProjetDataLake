    "text": "Mario Adorf (; born 8 September 1930) is a German actor, considered to be one of the great veteran character actors of European cinema. Since 1954, he has played both leading and supporting roles in over 200 film and television productions, among them the 1979 Oscar-winning film The Tin Drum. He is also the author of several successful mostly autobiographical books. ==Biography== Adorf was born in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, the illegitimate child of an Italian surgeon and a German medical assistant. He grew up in his maternal grandfather's hometown, Mayen, where he was raised by his unmarried mother. He rose to fame in Europe, and particularly Germany, and also made appearances in international films, including Ten Little Indians and Smilla's Sense of Snow. He also played a small role in the BBC adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9's Smiley's People as a German club owner. In Italy he also played in a number of movies. In the 1960's, he married Lis Verhoeven. The couple had a child, Stella, prior to their divorce. He starred with Barbara Bouchet in Milano Calibro 9 in 1972. In 1985, he married Monique Faye. Adorf remains very active in German shows, television and theatre. Adorf still regrets that he refused parts in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) and Billy Wilder's One, Two, Three (1961). He also turned down the role of General Mapache in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969), because he felt the character was too violent. In 1996, he provided the German dubbing voice for the character Draco in Dragonheart, a role performed by Sean Connery. == Awards == Among many others: * 2000 Bavarian Film Awards Honorary Award * 2011 Best Human Brand Award == Selected filmography == * 08/15 (1954), as Wagner * 08/15 - In der Heimat (1955), as Unteroffizier Stamm * Fruit in the Neighbour's Garden (1956), as Landstreicher * The Girl and the Legend (1957), as Bertie * Sand, Love and Salt (1957, directed by Franti\u0161ek \u010c\u00e1p), as Coco * ' (1957) * The Devil Strikes at Night (1957, directed by Robert Siodmak), as Bruno Luedke * The Doctor of Stalingrad (1958, directed by G\u00e9za von Radv\u00e1nyi), as Pelz, Sanit\u00e4ter * Rosemary (1958, directed by Rolf Thiele), as Horst * The Death Ship (1959, directed by Georg Tressler), as Lawski, Polnischer Kohlenschlepper * The Day the Rains Came (1959, directed by Gerd Oswald), as Werner Maurer * ' (Bumerang) (1960, directed by Alfred Weidenmann), as Georg Kugler * My Schoolfriend (1960), as Niedermoser * Brainwashed (1960, directed by Gerd Oswald), as Mirko Centowic * Who Are You, Mr. Sorge?
