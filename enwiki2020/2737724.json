    "text": "The Ullasund Bridge () is a bridge that crosses the Ullasundet strait between the islands of Harams\u00f8ya and Flems\u00f8ya in \u00c5lesund Municipality in M\u00f8re og Romsdal county, Norway. The original bridge was opened in 1969. The Ulla lighthouse is located just northwest of the eastern end of the bridge. Many bridges need to be repaired because the salt in the seawater damages the concrete and the iron inside it. The old Ullasund Bridge actually had to be taken down, because it was too damaged. It was taken down in 1998, after just 29 years in service. It has been replaced with a new bridge. ==See also== *List of bridges in Norway *List of bridges in Norway by length *List of bridges *List of bridges by length ==References== ==External links== *A picture of Ullasund Bridge *A picture of the sound between the islands Category:Bridges in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Bridges completed in 1969 Category:\u00c5lesund ",
