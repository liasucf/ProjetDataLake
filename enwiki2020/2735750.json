Stouf's Bust of Belisarius at the J. Paul Getty Museum shows the general of Justinian, blinded, as a beggar, in a manner that suggests a philosopher or saint. His reception piece for the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1785, the Death of Abel, shows Cain's victim sprawled full-length on the ground (Louvre Museum). The Detroit Museum of Art has a terracotta sketch for a Hercules Vanquishing Two Centaurs. ==External links== *Louvre Museum Official Website: Jean-Baptiste Stouf: 6 sculptures * Category:18th-century French sculptors Category:French male sculptors Category:19th-century French sculptors Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des beaux-arts Category:1742 births Category:1826 deaths ",
