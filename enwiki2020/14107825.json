    "text": "Couchsachraga Peak is a mountain located in Essex County, New York. \"Couchsachraga\" is based on an Algonquin or Huron name for the area, meaning \"dismal wilderness\". The mountain is part of the Santanoni Mountains of the Adirondacks. Couchsachraga Peak is flanked to the east by Panther Peak. There is no marked trail to the summit, which, being fully forested, has no views. Couchsachraga Peak stands within the watershed of the Cold River, which drains into the Raquette River, the Saint Lawrence River in Canada, and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The southern sides of Couchsachraga drains into Calahan Brook, thence into Moose Creek and the Cold River. The northeast and northern sides of Couchsachraga drain via several brooks into the Cold River. According to the 1897 survey of the Adirondacks, the height of Couchsachraga Peak was over , so it was included in the 46 High Peaks; the 1953 USGS found it and three other peaks to be lower, but the list has not been changed. Couchsachraga is within New York's Adirondack Park. == See also == * List of mountains in New York * Northeast 111 4,000-footers * Adirondack High Peaks * Adirondack Forty-Sixers == References == == External links == * Category:Mountains of Essex County, New York Category:Adirondack High Peaks Category:Mountains of New York (state) ",
