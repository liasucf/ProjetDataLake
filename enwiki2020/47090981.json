The film begins with the title song where the three friends marry Sapna, Rekha and Nisha. They are unhappy with their marriage life because of their mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law respectively. Amar's mother-in-law wants her late husband to be reborn and on the order of a fraud Baba. She has stopped her daughter from having any physical relations with Amar for over 6 months to achieve the rebirth of her late husband. Meet's wife is a twin and whenever he tries to go near his wife, it turns on his brother- in-law (who is a bodybuilder). The connection between the twins causes great problems like Meet's wife beating him up unintentionally when her brother is beating up some goon. Prem's sister-in-law is very hot yet very silly, she comes to live with them and wants to sleep with her elder sister, forcing Prem to sleep on the couch away from his wife. One day they meet in a bar and decide to enjoy their lives together. They decide to go to Amar's village to sell off his family Haveli (old mansion) and meanwhile have fun with the hot and sexy ladies in the village. When they reach the village, they find out that people are scared of the Haveli. An old man tells them that there used to be a father-daughter duo who lived in the haveli 50 years ago, the daughter, Ragini was very beautiful and many boys were smitten by her beauty but her father never let any guy near her. At the age of 20, Ragini died due to snake bite but her soul still resides in the haveli in search of a man who'll do masti with her. The guys laugh it off and proceed towards the haveli, there they meet a very hot girl who's been living secretly in the haveli as she is alone and has nowhere to go. The boys hire her as their maid and each one starts trying to attract her. Soon it is revealed that she is indeed Ragini and she informs the boys that one of them must have sex with her in order to free her soul and whoever does so will die. The boys get scared and try escaping the mansion but to no avail. Prem commits to doing so in front of Ragini to buy them some time and meanwhile they hire Babu Rangeela, a male prostitute to have sex with Ragini. But on the last moment their wives show up and Ragini turns Babu into a chicken. Ragini makes the boys do weird stuff in front of their wives and in-laws who join them at the haveli so they would leave. When the boys see that their wives are secretly fasting for them even when Ragini depicted them off as such perverts in front of them, they decide to confront Ragini. They meet Ragini and tell her they won't have sex with her and she can't harm them as their wives are fasting for their long lives. Ragini hurts them but they light a fire around her and call her father's spirit to help them. Rather Babu's spirit comes (who was cooked by the three wives) and has sex with Ragini hence satisfying her urge. Babu and Ragini leave the world together and the three couples live happily ever after. ==Cast== * Ritesh Deshmukh as Amar Saxena * Vivek Oberoi as Meet Mehta * Aftab Shivdasani as Prem Chawla * Sonali Raut as Shiney (special appearance in the song \u201cLipstick Laga ke\u201d) * Urvashi Rautela as Ragini (ghost) /Shabri (maid) * Pooja Bose as Sapna Amar Saxena * Mishti as Rekha Meet Mehta * Shraddha Das as Nisha Prem Chawla * Kangna Sharma as Prem's sister-in-law * Usha Nadkarni as Amar's mother-in-law * Ketan Karande as Meet's brother-in-law * Sanjay Mishra as Antakshari Baba * Shreyas Talpade as Babu Rangeela (special appearance) * Sudesh Lehri as Ramse (cameo) * Ghazal Sharma as Ritu (cameo) ==Music== The music for Great Grand Masti is composed by Sanjeev-Darshan, Shaarib-Toshi, Superbia (Shaan, Gourov & Roshin).
