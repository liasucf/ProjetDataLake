    "text": "\"Save Me\" (released 22 May 2000) is a song by English rock band Embrace, released as the third single from their second studio album Drawn From Memory. It only reached twenty-nine in the chart, but remains one of their most popular songs. The song is known for its complex bass line performed by Steve Firth. One of the B-sides to CD1, \"Still So Young\", was written by the band's drummer, Mike Heaton. The second version of the single features dance remixes of the same song as b-sides. One of these remixes is attributed to \"Reverend Bass\"; this is an alias for band's own Richard McNamara. ==Track listing== ;CD 1 # \"Save Me\" (Single edit) # \"Get on Board\" # \"Still So Young\" ;CD 2 # \"Save Me\" (Evening Session version) # \"Save Me\" (Perfecto mix) # \"Save Me\" (Reverend Bass mix) ;12 Inch Red Promo # \"Save Me\" (Perfecto mix) # \"Save Me\" (Reverend Bass mix) ;12 Inch Yellow Promo # \"Save Me\" (Morgan mix) # \"Save Me\" (Original/album mix) ==External links== * Category:2000 singles Category:Embrace (English band) songs Category:Hut Records singles Category:1999 songs Category:2000 songs Category:Songs written by Danny McNamara Category:Songs written by Richard McNamara ",
