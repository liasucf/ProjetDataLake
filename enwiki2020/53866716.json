Humanz collaborators who are unable to present themselves for the concert are represented by pre-recorded video, a technique previously utilized in Demon Days Live. The set and production for the tour was designed by London-based design studio Block9. == Set list == The following setlist is obtained from the concert held at the Huntington Bank Pavilion in Chicago, on 8 July 2017.
