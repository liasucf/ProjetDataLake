The Times of India gave the film a negative review and mentioned \"in one way, Vaigai Express has done justice to the remake by not rectifying the shoddy graphics work - in fact, the way several scenes have been executed in this film makes one feel that the original version deserves a few awards\".http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie- reviews/vaigai-express/movie-review/57823690.cms Similarly The New Indian Express noted it was a \"remake that didn't hit the right chord\", with Indiaglitz.com stating \"it was a tiring journey\".http://www.indiaglitz.com/vaigai-express-tamil-movie- review-19997.htmlhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/review/2017/mar/24/vaigai- express-a-remake-that-didnt-hit-the-right-chord-1585358.html In a slightly more positive review, the Deccan Chronicle stated it was \"a film that can be enjoyed only in parts\". Competition at the box office meant that Vaigai Express was removed from most screens after a single week.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/250317/vaigai- express-movie-review-film-that-can-be-enjoyed-only-in-parts.html ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:Tamil- language films Category:Indian films Category:Indian thriller films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Films set on trains Category:Tamil film scores by S.
