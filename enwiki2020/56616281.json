    "text": "Samuel Adesujo Ademulegun was a Nigerian officer in the Nigerian army. He was Commander of the No 1 brigade in 1966, and attained the military rank brigadier-general. Ademulegun was commissioned in 1949, and was one of the senior Officer Corps of the army along with Aguiyi Ironsi, Zakariya Maimalari and Babafemi Ogundipe. He was among those vying for the top army post of GOC in 1965 upon the retirement of the expatriate GOC. He was considered friendly with Ahmadu Bello which brought distaste to some junior officers who frowned at their commander fraternizing with politicians. He and his wife were killed in the 1966 coup when coupists led by Timothy Onwuatuegwu, an instructor at the Nigerian Military Training College barged into his room and was shot dead on his bed. ==References== = Reading List = * Abaya,, Angulu Samson (2008). \"A Pragmatic Analysis of Nigerian Military Coup Announcements\" (PDF).
