The aggressive approach of the bank and due to the unethical behaviour, frauds and allegations of Golden Key Credit Card Company, which was a subsidiary of Ceylinco Consolidated in early 2000s left the bank in a financial crisis. The 11 member team which was appointed as the New Director Board by the Bank of Ceylon for the Seylan Bank also consisted of Narangoda. The 11 member team also had Pradeep Kariyawasam, R. Nadarajah. The team managed to rebuild the financial performance of the Bank within a six- month time period where they were also able to do innovations for the development of the Bank. Mr. Eastman Narangoda who was a key member in the re- establishment of Seylan Bank thanked all the other members who were contributing to the success of the bank. == General references == * * Category:Sri Lankan Buddhists Category:Alumni of Nalanda College, Colombo Category:Sri Lankan bankers Category:Sri Lankan economists ",
