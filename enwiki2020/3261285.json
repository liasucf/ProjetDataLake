    "text": "The Arikaree Breaks are badlands in northwest Kansas. They form a two-to- three-mile-wide break of rough terrain between the plains of northwestern Kansas and eastern Colorado and the south sides of the Arikaree and Republican river basins. The breaks extend from Rawlins County, Kansas westward across Cheyenne County, Kansas and into Yuma County, Colorado. The Arikaree Breaks were carved by water. The soil here called Loess was blown to the area around 10,000 years ago. The soil has a tendency to erode, forming nearly vertical cliffs. This kind of soil is also found in northeast Kansas, southwest Nebraska, and Iowa. The soil in that part of the state forms the Loess Hills. ==References== ==External links== * Self guided tour map \u2013 Cheyenne County, Kansas, web site * Kansas Sampler \u2013 Arikaree Breaks, Cheyenne County * Kansas Travel \u2013 Arikaree Breaks Driving Tour with photos Category:Landforms of Kansas Category:Landforms of Cheyenne County, Kansas Category:Landforms of Rawlins County, Kansas Category:Landforms of Yuma County, Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Cheyenne County, Kansas Category:Landforms of Colorado ",
