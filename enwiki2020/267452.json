It has an area of 5,442 dunams () of land under its jurisdiction. In its population was . ==History== French scholar Victor Gu\u00e9rin associated Sha'ab with Saab, a place mentioned by 1st- century writer Josephus.Josephus, III, \u00a7 21, cited in Gu\u00e9rin, 1880, p. 434-435, cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275TIR, p. 218, cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275 The Midrash Rabba (Leviticus Rabba s. 20) mentions a certain Rabbi Mani of Sha'ab. In the 14th century, the tax income from the village was given to the wakf of the madrasah and mausoleum of the Shafi'i Manjaq in Egypt.MPF, 71, No. 53. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275 ===Ottoman era=== In 1517, Sha'ab was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire along with the rest of Palestine. In 1573 (981 AH) Sha'ab was one of several villages in Galilee which rebelled against the Ottomans.Heyd, 1960, p. 84-85. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 275 In 1596, the village appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Acre, part of Safad Sanjak, with a population of 102 households and 37 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, \"goats and bees\", in addition to \"occasional revenues\"; a total of 14,354 ak\u00e7e. 3/4 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 193Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. According to local tradition, the village started to flourish under anti- Ottoman rebel Zahir al-Umar (ca. 1768).Petersen, 2001, p. 275 In 1859, the population was estimated to be 1,500. Some were Catholic, the majority Muslim. The cultivated fields were estimated to be 80 feddans.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 271 Gu\u00e9rin visited in the 1870s, and wrote that the village of Sh'aib consisted of four quarters. The inhabitants, he wrote, were for the most part Muslim, about 800, and some 20 \"Schismatic Greek\" families. The Muslims had two Mosques and two walis.Gu\u00e9rin, 1880, p. 434-435Conder & Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 339 In 1881, Sha'ab was described as being in a valley with fine olive groves, while part of the hill behind it was cultivated in corn. A population list from about 1887 showed that Sha'ab had about 1,430 inhabitants; 1,345 Muslims and 85 Greek Catholics.Schumacher, 1888, p. 175 ===British Mandate era=== In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sha'ab had a population of 1,206; 1,166 Muslims and 40 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 37 where the Christians were 15 Orthodox and 25 Melkites.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p.50 The population increased slightly in the 1931 census to 1,297; 1,277 Muslims, 19 Christians and 1 Jew, in a total of 284 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 102 British forces during the 1936\u20131939 revolt, 1936 During the 1936 revolt in Palestine, the British Army attacked Sha'ab, demolishing 190 houses in the village. According to an eyewitness account, the British collectively punished the village for harboring a rebel who allegedly set off a roadside explosive that killed four British soldiers and injured three. A day prior to the demolition of the homes, the army rounded up around 200 of its adult male residents and led them to a valley outside the village. As they were being lined up, a rebel fighter positioned on a nearby hill began yelling and firing into the air, confusing the soldiers and causing Sha'ab's detained men to disperse chaotically. One resident named Hassan Hajj Khatib was killed.Ghandour, 2009, p. 12. In the 1945 statistics, Sha'ab had 1,740 inhabitants; 30 Christians and 1,710 Muslims.Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 4 They owned a total of 17,870 dunams of land, while 121 dunams were public.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 41 3,248 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 6,602 dunams for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 81 while 231 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 131 ===State of Israel=== Sha'ab was captured by the Israel Forces (IDF) on 19 July 1948 during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. The villagers surrendered without a fight,Morris 2004, p. 423 and their village was subsequently depopulated in the Palestinian exodus. Still, Sha'ab was found by the IDF's Ninth Brigade still to be inhabited in December 1948, and the residents were expelled on foot.Morris 2004, p. 514 The village was the headquarters and hometown of Abu Is'af, leader of one of the most effective local militias during the war and someone viewed as a hero by many Arabs in the area.Cohen, 2010, p. 100. Most of Sha'ab's original residents became internally displaced refugees, settling in nearby Arab villages, predominantly in Majd al-Krum and Sakhnin. Meanwhile, many refugees from the depopulated villages of al-Birwa, al-Damun and Mi'ar were settled in Sha'ab in 1948 and were joined by refugees from Kirad al-Ghannam and Kirad al-Baqqara in the Hula Valley in 1953. The original residents of Sha'ab protested their circumstances and launched a campaign soon after the end of the war to return to their homes.Cohen, 2010, p. 101 They gained the sympathy of most of the refugees from the Hula Valley and al-Birwa, but faced resistance from the former residents of al-Damun and Mi'ar. By 1950, roughly 10% of Sha'ab's original inhabitants returned to the village and eventually many more were given permission to resettle.Cohen, 2010, pp. 102-103 ==Notable buildings== ===Mosque of Zahir al-Umar=== The mosque of Zahir al-Umar is situated in the centre of the old village. In 1933 it was inspected by Na'im Makhouly from the Palestine Antiquities Museum, who found that the mosque dated from the time of Zahir al-Umar. In 1933 the mosque was in disrepair. Pictures from the time show two arcades: one had four arches connected with the side wall, with two columns in the centre. A reused Ionic capital could be seen, and above the doorway was a reused Roman lintel (first noticed by Gu\u00e9rin in the 1870s).Petersen, 2001, p. 276 Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specialising in Islamic architecture, surveyed the mosque in 1994. He found that the present mosque, built in the 1980s, encased the old building. The old part is the prayer hall, has an entrance to the north. This hall is square, covered with a dome. The dome rests on large squinches, which are supported by corbels. According to Petersen, the domed prayer hall is consistent with an 18th-century construction date. ===Tomb of Shaykh Alami=== The Maqam Shaykh Alami is situated south of the mosque, within its enclosure. It is built at a slope, where the ground rises to the south. On the east side there are two entrances; to the maqam, and to an underground cistern. The building is rectangular, 10 x 20 m, with an interior divided into two. The southern part contains a mihrab and is covered with a barrel vault. The northern end is covered with a dome, and has two large cenotaphs. According to Petersen, the buildings appear medieval. ==See also== *Arab localities in Israel *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * *Heyd, Uriel (1960): Ottoman Documents on Palestine, 1552-1615, Oxford University Press, Oxford. * * *MPF: Ipsirli and al-Tamimi (1982): The Muslim Pious Foundations and Real Estates in Palestine.
