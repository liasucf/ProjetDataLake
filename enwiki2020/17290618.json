    "text": "Muriel Day (born 11 January 1942) is an Irish singer. Born in Newtownards, County Down, she was the first singer from Northern Ireland to represent the Republic of Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. She was also the first woman to perform for Ireland, which had been competing since 1965. After making her name in the Irish showband circuit, and appearing in the British film Billy Liar in 1963, Day was chosen as Ireland's Eurovision contestant with the song \"The Wages of Love\" in 1969. Though the song was a great hit in Ireland, it only finished seventh internationally, in a year with four winners. As a result of her performance, however, she was offered the chance to record with Peter Warne, producing the enduring hit \"Nine Times out of Ten\", which became a Northern Soul classic. After moving to Canada in 1971, where she continued her career, Day eventually took up medicine and became a laser therapist. She returned to Belfast in the 1990s, where she has been performing regularly. As a guest on RT\u00c9's The Late, Late Show Eurosong 2015 programme broadcast on RT\u00c91 February 27, 2015, Day announced she was about to release her first ever album. ==References== ==External links== * *. * https://www.discogs.com/Muriel-Day-Jimbo-Nine-Times-Out-Of- Ten-/release/2302286 Category:Living people Category:Musicians from County Down Category:Irish female singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Ireland Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1969 Category:People from Newtownards Category:Northern soul musicians Category:Irish expatriates in Canada Category:1942 births Category:People in alternative medicine ",
