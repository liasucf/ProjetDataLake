It offers ten varsity sports including football, women's volleyball, men's and women's basketball, women's softball, wrestling, men's and women's golf, baseball, and women's soccer. Rochester Community and Technical College is also a Post Secondary Institution. This means that high school juniors and seniors can take courses at RCTC if they meet eligibility requirements. Admissions requirements include things such as a specific grade- point-average. Many students choose to participate in the Post Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO) because the credit hours taken at the college are counted at the high school as well. If the student continues his or her education beyond high school graduation, the credits may transfer to another a university as college credit. PSEO is common among public school students, private school students, and homeschool students in the Rochester area.http://www.rctc.edu/pseo/ *Winona State University-Rochester Center, (WSU-RC) is part of Winona State University.
