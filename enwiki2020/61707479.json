It was a tri-nation series featuring Singapore, Nepal and Zimbabwe, with all the matches played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Singapore used the series as preparation for their first appearance in the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier in October 2019. It was the first T20I tri-series to be played in Singapore. Prior to the series, Zimbabwe also played in another tri-series, in Bangladesh. Zimbabwe Cricket named Sean Williams as Zimbabwe's captain, after Hamilton Masakadza announced that he would retire from international cricket following the conclusion of the tri-series in Bangladesh that took place earlier in September. In the third match of the series, Singapore beat Zimbabwe by four runs. It was the first time that Singapore had beaten a Full Member team in an international cricket match. Despite their loss to Singapore, Zimbabwe went on to win the series, winning all their other matches. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; margin:auto\" |- ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Paras Khadka (c) * Dipendra Singh Airee (vc) * Binod Bhandari (wk) * Sushan Bhari * Avinash Bohara * Sundeep Jora * Sompal Kami * Karan KC * Sandeep Lamichhane * Kushal Malla * Ishan Pandey * Rohit Paudel * Lalit Rajbanshi * Pawan Sarraf * Aarif Sheikh | * Amjad Mahboob (c) * Aahan Gopinath Achar * Vinoth Baskaran * Surendran Chandramohan * Tim David * Avi Dixit * Aritra Dutta * Rezza Gaznavi * Anantha Krishna * Arjun Mutreja * Navin Param * Janak Prakash * Utsav Rakshit * Rohan Rangarajan * Manpreet Singh (wk) * Sidhant Singh * Aryaman Sunil * Selladore Vijayakumar | * Sean Williams (c) * Ryan Burl * Regis Chakabva * Brian Chari * Tendai Chatara * Craig Ervine * Daniel Jakiel * Neville Madziva * Timycen Maruma * Wellington Masakadza * William Mashinge * Peter Moor * Richmond Mutumbami (wk) * Tinotenda Mutombodzi * Tony Munyonga * Richard Ngarava |} ==Points table== ==Matches== ===1st match=== ===2nd match=== ===3rd match=== ===4th match=== ===5th match=== ===6th match=== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Tri-Nation Series Category:2019 in Nepalese cricket Category:2019 in Zimbabwean cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2019\u201320 Category:International cricket competitions in Singapore Singapore Tri-Nation Series Singapore Tri-Nations Series ",
