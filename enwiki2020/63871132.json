    "text": "Jadranka Lon\u010darek is a Croatian cell and molecular biologist researching the molecular mechanism of centrosome biogenesis and their function, with particular attention on numerical control of centrosome formation in non- transformed and cancerous human cells. == Education == Lon\u010darek earned a Ph.D. in cell and molecular biology at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb. Her dissertation in 2002 was titled The expression of the urokinase plasminogen activator gene in bladder carcinoma cell lines. Her doctoral advisor was Jasna Sori\u0107. She completed postdoctoral research in the laboratory of at the Wadsworth Center, where she studied the mechanisms of centriole duplication and mitotic spindle formation. == Career and research == Lon\u010darek joined the National Institutes of Health in 2011 as a Stadtman investigator in the laboratory of protein dynamics and signaling at the National Cancer Institute. She studies the centrosome cycle in proliferating cells and is head of the centrosome biology section. Lon\u010darek made tenure in 2020. Lon\u010darek researches the molecular mechanism of centrosome biogenesis and their function. She studies the architecture and cellular processes associated with their activity. Lon\u010darek aims to unravel the cellular regulatory pathways that control a centrosome number in normal and pathological conditions such as human tumors. Her laboratory uses biochemical and genetic approaches and combines them with conventional and super resolution microscopy and electron microscopy. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Institutes of Health people Category:21st-century biologists Category:21st-century women scientists Category:Croatian medical researchers Category:Women medical researchers Category:Croatian women scientists Category:Croatian biologists Category:21st-century Croatian scientists Category:Croatian emigrants to the United States Category:Expatriate academics in the United States Category:Cell biologists Category:Women molecular biologists Category:Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb alumni ",
