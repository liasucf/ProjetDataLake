The packaging uses thick cardboard stock and the inner sleeve is a replica of the original including lyrics and credits for the original album. The album was remastered from the original mastertapes at 24 bit and then dithered down to a 16 bit CD. The label of the CD is a replica of the period vinyl Island label and is jet black with \"grooves\" on the label side looking very much like an LP. The edition is limited to 3000 copies worldwide. The CD doesn't have any mastering credits. ==Track listing== All songs by Robert Palmer except where noted. #\"Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)\" (Moon Martin) (Moon Martin cover) \u2013 3:10 #\"Too Good to Be True\" \u2013 2:54 #\"Can We Still Be Friends\" (Todd Rundgren) \u2013 3:37 #\"In Walks Love Again\" \u2013 2:45 #\"Mean Ol' World\" (Andy Fraser) \u2013 3:33 #\"Love Stop\" (John David) \u2013 2:57 #\"Jealous\" (Jo Allen) \u2013 3:15 #\"Under Suspicion\" (Dennis Linde, Alan Rush) \u2013 3:25 #\"Woman You're Wonderful\" (Jo Allen, Palmer) \u2013 3:57 #\"What's It Take?\" \u2013 3:26 #\"Remember to Remember\" \u2013 3:30 ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1979) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 23 |- |United Kingdom (Official Charts Company) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 54 |- |United States (Billboard 200) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19 |} ==Personnel== *Robert Palmer \u2013 vocals, production *Pierre Brock \u2013 bass guitar *Dony Wynn \u2013 drums *Kenny Mazur \u2013 guitar *Steve Robbins, Jack Waldman \u2013 keyboards ;Technical *Karl Pitterson \u2013 engineer, mix *Benjamin Armbrister, Kendall Stubbs \u2013 assistant engineers *Greg Calbi \u2013 mastering at Sterling Sound (New York, NY). *Susan Palmer \u2013 cover concept, design *Graham Hughes - art direction, photography ==See also== * List of albums released in 1979 ==References== ==External links== Category:Robert Palmer (singer) albums Category:1979 albums Category:Island Records albums Category:Albums produced by Robert Palmer (singer) ",
