    "text": "The Puijo tower is an observation tower at the top of Puijo hill in Kuopio, Eastern Finland. Opened in 1963, the tower is tall and has a revolving restaurant with 100 seats. It was the first tower with a revolving restaurant in the Nordic countries. The restaurant was an inspiration to Erkki Lindfors, the mayor of Tampere, who got the idea to build a similar one in his home town, resulting in the N\u00e4sinneula tower, which opened in 1971. The current Puijo tower has been visited by over 5.5 million tourists. The current tower is the third overall. When it was completed in 1963 the second one, built in 1906, was dismantled. The first tower was built in 1856. On the western side of the tower there are three ski jumping hills. ==Gallery== File:Puijo2.jpg|The first Puijo tower, 1893 File:Old Puijo tower.jpeg|The second Puijo tower, built in 1900 File:Puijo 1963 adjusted.jpg|Both the second and third Puijo towers in 1963.
