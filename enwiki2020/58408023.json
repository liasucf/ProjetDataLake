He was convicted of eighteen attacks on children aged between two and four years in 1938\u20131939 in Sverdlovsk, Nizhny Tagil and Kushva. Eight of these attacks resulted in murder.

His father, Georgy Ivanovich, worked as a crew chief in municipal public utilities of Sverdlovsk, and his mother, Elizaveta Petrovna, was an accountant. The family lived in a stand-alone private house in the center of Sverdlovsk. The Vinnichevsky family was considered wealthy by Soviet standards at the time: Vladimir had a suit, a tank helmet, a Swiss knife, and leather shoes. He had been also given pocket money - at the time of his arrest he was found to have more than 20 rubles, which constituted a two- day salary of an average Soviet worker at the time. Vladimir studied at the Sverdlovsk School \u2116 16, in the 7 \"B\" grade. Due to his low performance in school, Vinnichevsky once had to repeat a grade. At the same time, however, he was good at singing and knew many songs by heart. Vinnichevsky was on friendly terms with Ernst Neizvestny, who later became a famous sculptor. Neizvestny and Vinnichevsky were in the same year of schooling (Vinnichevsky was two years older than Neizvestny, but went to school at a one-year older age and repeated a grade). The adolescents lived near each other. Together they attended school, cinema and Sverdlovsk's Theater of Musical Comedy. Vinnichevsky often visited Neizvestny's apartment. During an interrogation on November 17, 1939, Ernst Neizvestny described Vinnichevsky with the following wordsState Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region. - F. \u0420-148. - Op. 2. - D. 746. - L. 164\u2013165: == Murders == The list of victims with encrypting information, which lead to Vinnichevsky It is not known when Vladimir committed his first murder, since the investigators could not find the relatives of the first victims, about whom Vinnichevsky gave evidence.\u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0418. \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e- \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437. \u2014 \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, \u041c.: \u041a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439, 2016. \u2014 \u0421. 268.

The first murder (or more precisely, the third, as there is no information on the previous murders) was that of 4-year-old Gerta Grebanova, committed in the summer or early autumn of 1938 in Sverdlovsk. Vinnichevsky entered the courtyard of the private house where the Gribanovs lived, took the girl to the kitchen garden, where he strangled her, and then struck her head 8 times with a kitchen knife, breaking it, and leaving a splinter in the victim's skull.\u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0418. \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437. \u2014 \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, \u041c.: \u041a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439, 2016. \u2014 \u0421. 270. He later disposed of the broken knife and used a screwdriver and a folding knife in later murders. The planned map for the abduction and murder of a girl named Rita Fomina in Nizhny Tagil (case materials) Although Vinnichevsky committed most of the attacks in Sverdlovsk, he made trips to other cities in the Sverdlovsk Oblast to confuse the investigation - one attack was committed in Nizhny Tagil, and another in Kushva.\u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0418. \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437. \u2014 \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, \u041c.: \u041a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439, 2016. \u2014 \u0421. 273. He attacked both boys and girls. The motive of the attack was a sexual act with the victim. At first, Vinnichevsky tried to perform a \"natural\" sexual act with the female victims, but he was convinced that, due to anatomical limitations, this could not be done. Then he began to perform anal intercourse, and in some cases (usually in the cold season) limited himself to rubbing his genitals.\u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0418. \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e- \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437. \u2014 \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, \u041c.: \u041a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439, 2016. \u2014 \u0421. 270\u2014273. After the act Vinnichevsky would choke his victim, and sometimes stab them to death. The murder of Gerta Gribanova gave the investigators evidence, as the girl's skull had a knife piece stuck in it. The girl's body was beheaded by the investigative authorities: the skull was left as evidence, and the rest given to the child's parents for the burial. The assumption was that the killer would use the same kitchen knife that ended Gribanova's life, but later, this assumption turned out to be false. The fifth victim of Vinnichevsky was a boy who, most likely, survived, but could not be found. Then the killer suggested to 4-year-old Borya Titov to go sledging with him, took him to a wasteland, and attacked him after a snowdrift. Although Vinnichevsky prudently took the child with him, Borya was rescued, and later told the investigators about the murderer. The seventh victim was 3-year-old Kate Lobanov\u0430 in Kushva. The girl was killed, and her body later thrown into a swamp to hide the smell of degradation. In Sverdlovsk, Vinnichevsky began to practice the kidnapping of children and killing them in the forest massifs to the outskirts, where the bodies were covered with branches. This is how 4-year-old Lida Surina and 3-year-old Valya Kamaeva died in the spring of 1939. Later, 3-year-old Alya Gubina was kidnapped, with whom Vinnichevsky had sexual intercourse, after which he stabbed her several times with a knife, leaving a wound 25 centimeters long. After that, he threw the girl away, but she survived, and quickly fled. At the same time, Vinnichevsky did not take the child further than 1 km away from the place where he picked her up. He killed not only in the outskirts, but also near his home on Mamin-Sibiryak Street, where he kidnapped two children. The last victim - 4-year-old Taisia Morozov - after killing her, Vinnichevsky threw her body into a cesspool, placing her clothes into the front garden of the apartment building, hoping that it was there that they would search for the child's remains. The wounded victims from Vinnichevsky's attacks who were thrown into cesspools had practically no chance to escape, even if they were still alive. However, 4-year-old Raya Rahmatulina, thrown by Vinnichevsky into a cesspool, woke up and began to scream, alerting passers-by who rescued her. == Arrest == The Sverdlovsk criminal investigation department found it difficult to investigate cases of abductions of children. The kidnappings were very different - from the different locations, to the different disposal of the bodies. In addition, the surviving children could not give a clear description of the kidnapper. Finally, the parents of some of the victims did not file a complaint to the police. At the same time, the investigators made several erroneous assumptions about the murderer's identity. Everyone was sure that the killer had been convicted earlier, and, it was supposed, for crimes against the sexual inviolability of the person. It was assumed that the murderer was between 20 and 25, and looked like a teenager.\u0421\u043c\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0421. \u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 1930-\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432: \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b-\u043f\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u0430 // \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e: \u044d\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f (\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0443 300-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438). \u2014 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433: \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u041c\u0412\u0414 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, 2017. \u2014 \u0421. 262. According to one theory, the killer was either mentally-ill or simply a degenerate. Only in the summer of 1939 were all known cases connected into one, however, the attacks in Nizhny Tagil and Kushva were not connected with the Sverdlovsk murders. In 1939, Sverdlovsk was flooded with hidden police patrols, with more than 300 people arrested. On October 24, 1939, during the commission of the crimes, Vinnichevsky was detained by three police high school cadets named Popov, Angelov and Krylov. While patrolling at the tram stop in Verkhnyaya Pyshma, the cadets noticed a tall man who was carrying a little boy into the forest. Vinnichevsky had kidnapped the 3-year-old Vycheslav Volkov, whom his mother left for a few minutes at the entrance of the family home. The killer snatched the boy quickly, and got into the tram to get away from his pursuers. The cadets followed the teenager, and found him at a time when Vinnichevsky was choking the boy. Vyacheslav was rescued, and Vinnichevsky was detained. As Boris's scarf covered his neck, Vinnichevsky had to unbutton his shirt and begin strangling Boris, leaving well-visible scrapes of skin on his fingernails.\u0421\u043c\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0421. \u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 1930-\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432: \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b-\u043f\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u0430 // \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e: \u044d\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f (\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0443 300-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438). \u2014 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433: \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442- \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u041c\u0412\u0414 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, 2017. \u2014 \u0421. 263.

Vinnichevsky's parents brought this statement to the regional newspaper titled \"The Ural Worker\": The doctor of jurisprudence AS Skryalin emphasizes that the trial of Vinnichevsky was held when Soviet legislation provided for the death penalty for minors who had reached the age of 12 years. The People's Commissar for Defense, Kliment Voroshilov, on March 19, 1935, sent Stalin, Molotov and Kalinin a letter with a proposal to introduce the death penalty for children, pointing to the statistics of child crime in Moscow and, in particular, on wounding a son of the deputy prosecutor of the Soviet capital by a 9-year-old boy. Voroshilov was well acquainted with Stalin for battle of Tsaritsyn. The letter quickly gave the result in the form of a normative legal act. On April 8, 1935, a joint resolution of the CEC and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR \"on measures to combat juvenile delinquency\" was promulgated, providing for the imposition of the death penalty from the age of 12. This was known abroad. The famous writer Romain Rolland, in a conversation with Stalin on June 28, 1935, questioned the humanity of such a measure. Stalin replied to him: On April 20, 1935, the top secret circular of the USSR Prosecutor's Office and the USSR Supreme Court No. 1/001537-30/002517, which was signed by the USSR Prosecutor Andrei Vyshinsky and the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the USSR Vinokurov, is dated. The Circular explained to Prosecutor's Offices and Courts the Resolution \"On measures to combat crime among minors\": \u0422hus, the USSR prosecutor's office and the Supreme Court of the USSR virtually abolished article 22 of the Criminal Code, which explicitly abolished the execution against persons under the age of 18. On January 2, 1936, the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the USSR indicated that if persons who have attained the age of 12 commit crimes not listed in Article 12, but connected with violence, bodily harm, mutilation or murder, they are liable under the relevant article of the Criminal Code.\u0421\u043c\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0421. \u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 1930-\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432: \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b-\u043f\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u0430 // \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e: \u044d\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f (\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0443 300-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438). \u2014 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433: \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u041c\u0412\u0414 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, 2017. \u2014 \u0421. 264.

These bodies were not divided for what they were shot for, therefore, in one mass grave, those executed for political reasons and on criminal charges, such as Vinnichevsky. In the 1990s, the burial place was turned into a memorial complex of victims of reprisals of the 1920s\u20131950s. On November 20, 2017, at this complex a monument titled \"Masks of Sorrow: Europe-Asia\" was opened, the work of a friend of Vinnichevsky, Ernst Neizvestny. == Vinnichevsky's case files and publications about him == Vinnichevsky's criminal case is No. 434. According to the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region, the archive contains four volumes of the criminal case against Vladimir Georgievich Vinnichevsky, considered by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in 1940. They are in the fund of the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region R-148 \"Sverdlovsk Regional Court\" (Inventory 2). In one media in the summer of 2017, information appeared that the materials of the criminal case of Vinnichevsky had been kept secret for more than 70 years.
