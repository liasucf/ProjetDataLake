    "text": "Clafoutis (; or ), sometimes spelled clafouti in Anglophone countries, is a baked French dessert of fruit, traditionally black cherries, arranged in a buttered dish and covered with a thick flan-like batter. The clafoutis is dusted with powdered sugar and served lukewarm, sometimes with cream. A traditional Limousin clafoutis contains not only the flesh of the cherries used, but also the nut-like kernels in the stones. Cherry kernels contain benzaldehyde, the compound responsible for the dominant flavour in almond extract. They also contain a small amount of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside - a compound potentially capable of releasing cyanide if consumed, but non- toxic in small quantities. ==Origins== The clafoutis comes from the Limousin region of France, and while black cherries are traditional, there are numerous variations using other fruits, including red cherries, plums, prunes, apples, pears, cranberries or blackberries.Larousse Gastronomique, Clarkson Potter Publishers When other kinds of fruit are used instead of cherries, the dish is properly called a flaugnarde. The dish's name derives from Occitan clafot\u00eds, from the verb clafir, meaning \"to fill\" (implied: \"the batter with cherries\"). Clafoutis apparently spread throughout France during the 19th century. ==See also== * List of French dishes * List of French desserts ==References== Category:Occitan desserts Category:French desserts Category:Custard desserts Category:Fruit dishes ",
