In Europe, it was released on Big Dada. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 78% based on 14 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Rollie Pemberton of Stylus Magazine gave the album a grade of B, saying: \"The album is one of the few anti-industry freakouts that have appealed to me on both a conceptual and musical level, so whether or not you are familiar with Busdriver's skittering flow or innovative song structure, it's worth the time to see why he's so damn mad after all.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Busdriver \u2013 vocals * Daedelus \u2013 production (1, 6, 11, 13) * Omid \u2013 production (2) * Paris Zax \u2013 production (3, 5, 7, 9, 12) * Thavius Beck \u2013 production (4, 10) * Subtitle \u2013 keyboards (5) * Abstract Rude \u2013 vocals (7) * Ellay Khule \u2013 vocals (7) * Danger Mouse \u2013 production (8) * Kevin McNulty \u2013 keyboards (9) * Myka 9 \u2013 vocals (12) * 2Mex \u2013 vocals (12) * Isaac Sprintis \u2013 guitar (12) ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:2005 albums Category:Busdriver albums Category:Mush Records albums Category:Big Dada albums Category:Albums produced by Danger Mouse (musician) ",
