He was a leader of the Sudanese Ansar religious order and was also the uncle of fellow Umma party politician Sadiq al-Mahdi. The Umma party was largely torn in half between 1966 and 1969 as a result of a split between Hadi al-Mahdi and Sadiq al-Mahdi. Mahdi died in 1971 whilst attempting to escape from Sudan to Ethiopia following the bombing of Aba Island by Gaafar Nimeiry. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1970 deaths Category:National Umma Party politicians ",
