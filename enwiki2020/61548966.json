Right after the intro skit you hear him next to Black Thought. Next song Jadakiss, and closing out the project with Pusha T's second best guest appearance of 2019 on 18 Wheeler. No matter who was with him Benny blew like Sonny Rollins on the Sax, whether Conway or Eminem was coming on next\u2026it didn't matter. The Butcher has a gift and no fear.\"http://freemusicempire.com/2019/12/24/2019-fme-mvp-griselda == Discography == === Studio albums === * *Tana Talk 3 (2018) *Burden of Proof (2020) === Extended plays === *17 Bullets (2016) *Tommy Devito's Breakfast (with Cuns) (2017) *A Friend of Ours (2018) *FVR-001 (2019) *The Plugs I Met (2019) === Mixtapes === *Tana Talk (as B.E.N.N.Y.)
