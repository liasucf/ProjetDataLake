Alternatively, it is possible to remove the scales with a knife, but this is more difficult and there is a higher risk of cutting the skin of the fish, especially with small fishes; knife-scaling also risks cutting one's own hand. The urokotori is pulled across the skin of the fish from the tail to the head repeatedly to remove the scales. ==See also== *List of Japanese cooking utensils Category:Japanese cooking tools ",
