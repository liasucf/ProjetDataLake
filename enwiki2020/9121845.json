The Red Dog Saloon is a drinking establishment at 278 South Franklin Street in Juneau, Alaska, U.S. The Red Dog has been recognized by the Alaska Legislature for its longevity as the oldest man-made tourist attraction in Juneau. ==History== Founded during Juneau's mining era, the Saloon has been in operation for decades. For a time, \"Ragtime Hattie\" played the piano in white gloves and a silver dollar halter top. Later, in territorial days, the owners would often meet the tour boats at the docks with a mule that wore a sign saying, \"follow my ass to the Red Dog Saloon.\" The saloon hosted an episode of The Ed Sullivan Show just after Alaska became a state.APRN story on the Red Dog ==Memorabilia displayed== Wyatt Earp's pistol at the Red Dog Saloon * Wyatt Earp's gun that he checked but failed to claim on his way to Nome * a walrus oosik * trophy wildlife mounts * paper currency signed by miners from around the world throughout the years Established by Earl and Thelma Forsythe ==References== ==External links== * Category:Buildings and structures in Juneau, Alaska Category:Companies based in Juneau, Alaska Category:Culture of Juneau, Alaska Category:Drinking establishments in Alaska Category:Pre-statehood history of Alaska Category:Tourist attractions in Juneau, Alaska ",
