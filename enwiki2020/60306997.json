It is one of the five places under the Panchkoshi, the five holy places of Dailekh. This site is located at Dullu Municipality, former Padukasthan VDC. According to mythology, this place is named after Lord Shiva's wife, Satidevi's decayed feet; \"Paduka\" meaning feet and \"sthan\" meaning the place. Even the inscription of the feet of Lord Bisnu was found here, so this place is also called as Bishnu Padukasthan. Previously, as Shirsthan and Nabhisthan, there used to be flame over water. However, a flame house is located here. On 2028 BS, a flood on Paduka bridge vandalized flame. On the bank, all the inscriptions, Statues, Pillars and other historical ruins.
