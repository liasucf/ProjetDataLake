The overall goal of the project is to narrow the huge diagnostic gap in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR- TB) control by expanding and accelerating access to new and rapid diagnostic technologies within appropriate laboratory services, accompanied by the necessary technology transfer, and ensuring these new technologies are properly integrated within TB control programmes. ==Main Partners== * UNITAID * World Health Organization (WHO) * Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics * Stop TB Partnership Global Laboratory Initiative (GLI) * Stop TB Partnership Global Drug Facility (GDF) ==References== Category:Organizations established in 2009 Category:Tuberculosis ",
