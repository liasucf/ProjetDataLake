    "text": "\"Make You Mine\" is a song by Filipino singer Nina from her second studio album Smile. It was released alongside the album as its lead single in December 2003 by Warner Music Philippines. The song was written and produced by The 33rd, and features a rap verse performed by rapper Picasso. \"Make You Mine\" differed from the previous singles Nina was known for. Its upbeat groove and flirty lyrics allowed her to transcend the typical \"love song syndrome\" most Filipino artists are known for, and spun a reinvented image for the singer. The song talks about a girl who fell in love at first sight with a boy, and could not stop thinking about him and wants to make the boy hers. The song was praised by OPM critics and reviewers, who called the song \"a blissful listening experience\". It also stood out above other releases at that time, with its different sound and lyrics, allowing Nina to transcend the typical Filipino \"love song syndrome\". Commercially, the song was a surprise hit. \"Make You Mine\" was accompanied by a music video, where Nina is seen buying toys with her friends. She then crushes on a guy she sees at the toy store. ==Background== ===Development=== After the success of Nina's 2002 debut album, Heaven, it was obligatory that she releases another record in the following year. Her debut was heavily influenced by jazzy lounge pop-R&B; similar to the sound of international music at that time. Warner Music kept the sound she started with and made it even bigger. While the re-release of Heaven was being sent out to the market, the label has already started production for her second album in 2003. The production was a bit rushed, since the album needed to be released before the year ended. Under Warner's managing head at that time, Ricky Ilacad, the label collaborated with more international songwriters, arrangers and producers for the second project. These include The 33rd, Cuban American composer-producer Rudy P\u00e9rez, Zomba record-production acts Sean Hosein, Dane DeViller, Andy Goldmark and Swedish composer J\u00f6rgen Elofsson. The album resembles the same sound from its predecessor, but only bigger and bolder in terms of incorporating urban-style to upbeat rhythmic jams and harmonic sound to powerful sentimental ballads. ===Release=== \"Make You Mine\" was immediately released in December 2003 as a follow-up to Nina's string of hits. Critical and commercial response to both the song and the album were great especially, since the song differed from the previous singles Nina was known for. Its upbeat groove and flirty lyrics allowed Nina to transcend the typical \"love song syndrome\" most Filipino artists are known for, and spun a reinvented image for the Soul Siren. On June 21, 2005, the song was released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download. ==Composition== \"Make You Mine\" is an uptempo song, that blends the sound of contemporary R&B; and hip-hop, with a touch of bubblegum pop. The song has a rich harmonic chemistry of Nina's mesmerizing vocals and hypnotic urban-style beats with a blend of funky strings. It is described as \"an upbeat R&B; piece that offers a blissful listening experience.\" It features a rap verse performed by Picasso. The song reinvented Nina's image, since it differed from her previous love-ballad releases. It showcases upbeat groove and flirty lyrics, that is heavily influenced by American urban music. Her whistle register on the song ranges from G6 to A6, and is performed repetitively throughout the bridge until it fades. ==Music video== Nina holding a big teddy bear in the music video.
