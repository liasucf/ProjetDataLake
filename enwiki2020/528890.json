    "text": "This is a list of the leaders of the opposition party of Quebec, Canada since Confederation (1867). Note that the leader of the Opposition is not always the leader of the political party with the second-largest number of seats, in cases where the leader of that party does not have a seat. There was no Leader of the Opposition until March 1869, when the government's second budget was introduced. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !! Name !! Electoral district (Region) !! Took Office !!
