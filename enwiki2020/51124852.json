Although it was reported that most captives of the prison did not survive their detention, the date beneath Hussain's name is 24 February 2016 - more than a full year prior to his actual disappearance and last activity on social media. Abu Sa'eed spent approximately two months in ISIS dungeons at that time, but made it out and participated in the Battle of Raqqa.Telegram On 18 August 2019 it was reported by some British newspapers, citing \"security sources\", that Hussain had died in an Islamic State suicide attack during the Battle of Raqqa. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:British Islamists Category:British people convicted of indecent assault Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members Category:People of the Syrian Civil War ",
