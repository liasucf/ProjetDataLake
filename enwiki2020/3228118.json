The parish covers an area of and at its highest point is King's Hill, above sea level. According to the 2011 census, Bentworth had a population of 553. It lies on the edge of the East Hampshire Hangers. Bronze Age and Roman remains have been found in the area and there is evidence of an Anglo-Saxon church in the village. The manor of Bentworth was not named in the Domesday Survey of 1086, but it was part of the Odiham Hundred. Land ownership of the village was passed by several English kings until the late Elizabethan era. During the Second World War, Bentworth Hall was requisitioned as an outstation for the Royal Navy and nearby Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp. The parish contains several manors including Bentworth Hall, Hall Place, Burkham House, Wivelrod Manor, Gaston Grange and Thedden Grange. The estate of Bentworth Hall was split up as a result of various sales from the 1950s. St Mary's Church, a Grade II* listed building which parts of which date back to the late 11th century, lies at the centre of the village. The village has two public houses, the Star Inn and the Sun Inn; a primary school; and its own cricket club. Bentworth formerly had a railway station, Bentworth and Lasham, on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway until the line's closure in 1936. The nearest railway station is now east of the village, at Alton. == History == === Prehistory to Roman === The Bentworth Neolithic basalt axehead The village name has been spelt in different ways, including: Bentewurda or Bintewurda (12th century) and Bynteworth (c. 15th century). The original meaning of the name Bent-worth may have been a place of cultivated land, or a way through land such as woodland. The Swedish scholar Eilert Ekwall argues that a derivation from the Old English bent-grass is unlikely, and suggests a derivation from The t\u0169n of Bynna's people. In October 1935 a Neolithic basalt axe-head was found near Weller's Place Farm, indicating occupation in prehistoric times. Pot sherds and faunal remains from the Iron Age and several coins have been discovered, including a Bronze coin of Valentinian I, discovered in 1956. The Romans built a road between the Roman town of Silchester to the north of Old Basing, and the Roman settlement of Vindomis, just east of the present-day town of Alton, which measured 15 Roman miles. A Bronze Age cremation urn was found in 1955 just north of Nancole Copse, approximately from St Mary's Church. The urn is now displayed in the Curtis Museum in Alton, together with a bronze Roman coin of Valentinian I that was found in a garden about south of St Mary's near Tinker's Lane. Belgic pottery and animal bones were found in 1954 at Holt End, a hamlet south of Bentworth. Pottery, bone objects, spindle-whorls (stone discs with a hole in the middle used in spinning thread) and fragments of Roman roofing tiles were unearthed at Wivelrod Manor. === Medieval === Bentworth was not mentioned separately in the 1086 Domesday Survey, although the entry for the surrounding Hundred of Odiham mentions that it had a number of outlying parishes that included Bentworth. Soon after Domesday, Bentworth became an independent manor. Between 1111 and 1116 it was granted by Henry I to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. alt=King Henry I of England holding a miniature chapel in one hand and the Domesday Book in another The earliest mention of Bentworth village was in the charter of 1111\u20131116 from Henry I to the Archdiocese of Rouen of \"the manor of Bynteworda and the berewica (outlying farm) of Bercham (present day Burkham)\". St Mary's Church was not included in this charter but in 1165 King Henry II granted it to Roturn, then the Archdiocese of Rouen. When King John began losing his possessions in Normandy he took back the ownership of several manors, including Bentworth. He then ceded Bentworth manor to Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, in 1207\u20138. The manor was returned to Rouen, who held the property until 1316, when Edward II appointed Peter de Galicien as its custodian. Some time after 1280 a new stone hall house was built at Bentworth, a typical medieval hall house and has been variously called Bentworth Hall (until 1832) and Bentworth Manor House. Since 1832 it has been known as Hall Place. In 1333 the property owner was granted the right for a private chapel on the premises. Maud de Aula was given permission to hold services at Bentworth Hall chapel from 1333 to 1345; the remains of this building can be seen today immediately to the southwest of Hall Place. In February 1336 to manor was granted to Peter, Archbishop of Rouen, but he appeared to subsequently have nothing to do with it, as four months later ownership of the manor passed to William Melton, the Archbishop of York. Upon his death in 1340 he left his possessions to his nephew William de Melton, the son of his brother Henry. In 1348, William de Melton obtained King Edward III's permission to give his manor to William Edendon, Bishop of Winchester. The ownership of the manor of Bentworth was then passed by marriage to the Windsor family, who had been constables of Windsor Castle. The Bentworth Hall estate was evidently returned to the Melton family, because it is mentioned among their possessions in a document dated to 1362. It then passed to William's similar-named son, Sir William de Melton. Sir William's son, John de Melton, who inherited the house in 1399, was recorded as owner of the manor of Bentworth in 1431. He died in 1455, and was succeeded by his son until the latter's death in 1474, then finally his grandson John Melton. After the death of the last, the manor of Bentworth remained in the possession of the Windsor family for at least 150 years. === Elizabethan to Georgian === alt=A map of Bentworth's parish as it appeared 1811 The Windsors owned many manors, including Bentworth. An example is from the will of Edward, 3rd Lord Windsor, dated 20 December 1572 which contains the words: \" ... touching the disposition of ... all those my manors of Bentworth Hall, Burkham, Astleye, Mill Court and Thrustons ... in the county of Southampton ... \" Twelve years later in 1590, the 5th Lord Windsor, Henry Windsor (1562\u20131605), sold the manor of Bentworth to the Hunt family, who had been tenants since the beginning of the 1500s. Ownership passed in 1610 to Sir James Woolveridge of Odiham and in 1651 to Thomas Turgis, a wealthy London merchant. His son, also Thomas, described as one of the richest commoners in England, left the manor of Bentworth to his relative William Urry, of Sheat Manor in 1705. In 1777 William Urry's daughters Mary and Elizabeth married two brothers, Basil and William Fitzherbert of Swynnerton Hall, Staffordshire. Their sister-in-law was Maria Fitzherbert, the secret wife of the Prince Regent, later King George IV. In about 1800, Mary Fitzherbert (who had eleven children) became owner of Bentworth Manor and Manor Farm. === 19th century to the Second World War === In 1832 the Fitzherbert family sold the Bentworth Hall estate at an auction in London to Roger Staples Horman Fisher for approximately \u00a36000. Almost immediately Fisher started building the present Bentworth Hall. In 1848 the estate was sold to Jeremiah Robert Ives. The Ives family later shared ownership with the author George Cecil Ives who lived for a time at the hall with his paternal grandmother. In 1898 a station for the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway was proposed which would serve Bentworh, Lasham and the village of Shalden. Land was taken from the villages of Bentworth and Lasham to provide for the railway station. In 1870\u201372 the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales by John Marius Wilson described Bentworth as alt=North view of Bentworth village green in 1905, with thatched cottages in the foreground In 1897 Emma Ives died and ownership of the Bentworth Hall estate passed to her son Colonel Gordon Maynard Gordon-Ives, who had in 1870 had built Gaston Grange as his residence. After his mother died he continued to live there, leasing Bentworth Hall to William Nicholson, the Member of Parliament for Petersfield. Gordon-Ives died on 8 September 1907 and the estate passed to his son, Cecil Maynard Gordon-Ives, a Captain of the Scots Guards in the First World War, who occupied it until his death on 23 July 1923. The Bentworth Hall Estate was then purchased by Arthur d'Anyers Willis in 1924 and was sold again to Major John Arthur Pryor in 1932, who lived at Bentworth Hall until the estate was taken over by the military during the Second World War. === Second World War === Bentworth's Telegraph office, circa 1905 Bentworth Hall was requisitioned for war use and was where a number of organisations were based. In 1941 it was used by the Mobile Naval Base Defence Organization (MNBDO) and it was later an outstation of the Royal Navy's Haslar Hospital in Portsmouth, the bedrooms being used as wards. Later, it was occupied by officers from the airfield at Lasham; one commander kept an aircraft in a field towards New Copse and used it as transport to Lasham Airfield. From 1942\u201344 Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp. During the war nissen huts were built on what is now the Complins housing estate. The War Department had occupied the Holybourne property and constructed 26 nissen huts and other structures on the grounds, some of which were converted into civilian housing after the war. In 1966 the property was sold and 41 homes were built on the former site of Complins estate and brewery. === Post-war === alt=Statues of two bears at the entrance to Bentworth Hall In 1947 the Bentworth Hall estate was bought by Major Herbert Cecil Benyon Berens, who was a director of Hambros Bank in London from 1968. In 1950 Berens built two new lodge houses at the junction of the drive to Bentworth Hall towards the main road through the village. The Berens family arms included a bear, and when Berens acquired the Bentworth Hall estate, carvings of bears were put up in various places. Two of which can be seen at the entrance to the Bentworth Hall drive, between the two lodge houses. Herbert Berens died on 27 October 1981, and the remaining estate was put up for sale. Initially Bentworth Hall was offered as a single property, but its outbuildings were divided into a number of separate dwelling units and other parts were sold to local farms. In June 1982, the Bentworth Conservation Area was established, incorporating many of the local buildings of note, extending along the main lane and around the church. Bentworth was awarded a gold postbox in 2012 after Peter Charles, a resident of the village, won a gold medal in the equestrian event of the 2012 Summer Olympics. A postbox in Alton was incorrectly painted gold in Charles' honour, until the Royal Mail later painted the correct postbox in Bentworth. == Governance == In elections for the United Kingdom national parliament, Bentworth is in the constituency of East Hampshire, which since May 2010 has been represented by Damian Hinds of the Conservative Party. In local government, Bentworth is governed by Hampshire County Council at the highest tier, East Hampshire District Council at the middle tier, and Bentworth Parish Council at the lowest tier. In County Council elections Hampshire is divided into 75 electoral divisions that return a total of 78 councillors; Bentworth is in Alton Rural Electoral Division. In district council elections East Hampshire is divided into 38 electoral wards that return a total of 44 councillors; Bentworth is in Downland Electoral Ward, together with the parishes of Beech, Chawton, Farringdon and Wield. == Geography == alt=Map of Bentworth in relation to other major towns and cities in southern England Bentworth village and parish lies on high downland about northwest of the town of Alton and about 8 miles south of Basingstoke, the largest town in the non-metropolitan county of Hampshire. By road, Bentworth is situated south of Basingstoke, northeast of the county town of Winchester and north of Portsmouth. The parish covers an area of ; the soil is clay and loam, the subsoil chalk. In 1911 about of the parish were woodland, and the most prominent crops were wheat, oats, and turnips. The lower ground to the south-east of Bentworth and to the south of the nearby villages of Lasham and Shalden drains towards the River Wey which rises to the surface near Alton. Near Hall Place is the village duckpond, with cottages opposite it dated to 1733. Such names as Colliers Wood and Nancole Copse in the parish point to the early operations of the charcoal burners, the colliers of the Middle Ages. Other woods in the area include Gaston Wood, Childer Hill Copse, Miller's Wood, Thedden Copse, Well Copse, North Wood, Wadgett's Copse, Bylander's Copse, Nancole Copse, Widgell Copse, South Lease Copse, Stubbins Copse and Mayhew's Wood. The names of Windmill Field and Mill Piece indicate the site of one or more ancient mills. ===Parish background=== The civil parish of Bentworth, starting to the north and working clockwise, extends from north of Burkham House, then runs south east along the A339, turns south to Thedden Grange and the hamlet of Wivelrod, then west to north of Medstead and north again to Ashley Farm and back to the Burkham area. Historically, Bentworth's parish was considerably larger than it is today, incorporating nearby settlements like Bradley, Beech, Moundsmere, Medstead and Lower Wield. The parish has lost large amounts of land over the years, but gained a further in 1991 by regaining the Home Farm country park from the parish of Bradley. Bentworth was the largest parish within the Hundred of Odiham, after Odiham itself. At the time of the Domesday Survey the area of the Hundred of Odiham were included in two separate hundreds, Odiham and Hefedele (also known as Edefele and Efedele). The former comprised Lasham and Shalden and half a hide which had been taken from the nearby village of Preston Candover, and the latter included Odiham, Winchfield, Elvetham, Dogmersfield, and a former parish named Berchelei. For the manors of Bentworth, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Liss, Sherfield-upon-Loddon, and Weston Patrick, there are no entries in the Survey, but they were believed to have been included in the large manor of Odiham. === Villages and hamlets === Within the Bentworth parish are several hamlets, the largest of which is Burkham to the north of the village. Other hamlets include Wivelrod to the southeast, Holt End and New Copse to the south, Thedden to the east, Ashley to the west and Tickley to the north. ==== Burkham ==== Burkham (also known as Brocham (14th century); Barkham (16th century); Berkham (18th century)) is a larger hamlet on the north side of the parish of Bentworth that lies about northwest of the village. Burkham was first mentioned in 1111, and was later mentioned as part of the Manor of Bentworth in documents of the Archbishop of Rouen around 1115, in which it is described as a \"berewite\" (an outlying estate) of the Bentworth Manor Tickley is a smaller hamlet that lies approximately south of Burkham, which includes a manor house named Tickley House. Burkham is where Georgian Burkham House is located. It was first recorded in a document dated 1784 in which there was a reference to a \"Manor or Mansion House of Burkham\", owned by Thomas Coulthard (1756\u20131811). Burkham House was acquired in 1882 by Arthur Frederick Jeffreys, later a member of parliament for Basingstoke. Ownership was retained by the Jeffreys family until 1965 when the estate was put up for sale. The Home Farm area consists of of farmland, copse and uncultivated land. Part of this area between Burkham and Bentworth was bought by the Woodland Trust in 1990. Before the Woodland Trust purchased the property, it was scheduled to become a landfill. The Trust planted trees in 1993. This is the only nature preserve in the area. ==== Holt End and New Copse ==== Holt End and New Copse are two areas of Bentworth that lie to the south of the village. The word Holt means \"a small grove of trees or wood\", and Holt End thus means the end of a wooded area. A long road to the south, called Jennie Green Lane, branches off the main road in Bentworth and runs northwest from Medstead to Lower Wield. Gaston Grange and Holt Cottage, a small thatched cottage dating from 1503 and a Grade II listed building since 1985, both lie within the hamlet. ==== Thedden ==== alt=A view of the Thedden Grange manor from the south side, showing the gardens and rear side of the manor Thedden is a hamlet and part of the parish of Bentworth between the villages of Bentworth and Beech. Thedden Grange is about south-east of St Mary's Church and is a country house that was formerly part of the Bentworth Manor estate. During the Second World War, Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp. Thedden derivatives from the Anglo- Saxon name of \"Tedena\" and was first documented in 1168. The earliest map of Thedden was produced in 1676 by Lewis Andrewes, a surveyor for Magdalene College. At the time of the late 12th century, Thedden comprised of \"fertile land\". ==== Wivelrod ==== Wivelrod is a hamlet in the extreme south-east corner of the parish of Bentworth. Wivelrod was first mentioned in documents dating to 1259. In the 18th century Wivelrod Manor belonged to the owner of Bentworth Hall, although some land, excluding the farm, was sold in the 1830s for \u00a3900, when the estate was bought by Roger Staples Horman Fisher. == Demographics == In the 2011 census Bentworth parish had 228 dwellings, 211 households and a population of 553 (270 males and 283 females).

The gallery was added in celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1891. , the school had 87 pupils, not only from Bentworth but also from surrounding villages. The school hall is used for other village activities such as Bentworth Garden Club meetings, performances by the Bentworth Mummers (a local amateur theatrical group), other meetings, and as a polling station for elections. In November 2010, the Bentworth Mummers put on a performance of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen. Bentworth Cricket Club is just south of the village. The village has five tennis courts, one just to the south of the church and school, one just further to the southeast on the main village street, another at Hall Farm, and two more either side of the Sun Inn on Sun Hill. == Notable landmarks == The following are the listed buildings in the Parish of Bentworth.

The decision to build a memorial at the church was decided during a parish meeting on 7 February 1920 and it was formally dedicated on 28 November 1920 by the Reverend A.G. Bather and unveiled by Major General Jeffreys of Burkham, officer in command of the London District. The war memorial has a four-step base, with a \"tapering octagonal shaft on a small square plinth block\" placed upon it and a Latin cross at the top of the shaft.

There is a 14th-century stone chapel directly to the right of Hall Place Hall Place, formerly Bentworth Hall or Manor, is a Grade II* listed medieval hall-house, located south of the road to Medstead just south-west of Tinker's Lane. It was built in the early 14th century with additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. The hall is believed to have been constructed by either the constable of Farnham Castle, William de Aula, or 'John of Bynteworth'. The de Aula family are documented as being the first owners, followed by the de Melton family. The hall has thick flint walls, gabled cross wings, with a Gothic stone arch and 20th century boarded door and two-storey porch. The west wing of the house has a stone-framed upper window and large attached tapered stack. The east wing has sashes dated to the early 19th century. The old fireplace remains in the north, facing room with it roll moulding and steeply pitched head.
