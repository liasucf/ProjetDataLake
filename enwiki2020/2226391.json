Nowotaniec (, 1409; ; , Novotanets\u2019) is a village in south-eastern Poland, inhabited by about 430 (2002), in the Pog\u00f3rze Bukowskie (Bukowsko Upland) mountains. Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in the Krosno Voivodeship (1975\u20131998) and the Sanok district, Bukowsko subdistrict, located near the towns of Medzilaborce and Palota (in northeastern Slovakia). Nowotaniec is bordered on the east by Bukowsko, on the north by Wola S\u0119kowa, on the west by Nadolany, on the right bank of the Pielnica river (a tributary of the Wis\u0142ok), on the left side of the highway nr 889 from the railroad running from Sanok to Krosno, and on the west by forests covering the slopes of the Bukowica Range. This village consists of one street which runs north to south displaying Latin church stone and several houses. The parish belongs to the Diocese of Przemy\u015bl, deanery of Sanok. It includes, Nag\u00f3rzany, Nadolany, and Wola S\u0119kowa. The Roman Catholic cemetery is located westward of the village center. ==History== Latin church in Nowotaniec Nowotaniec is just up the road from Bukowsko. Historically it has been a mostly Polish village. The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus' and Hungary starting in at least the 9th century. This area was mentioned for the first time in 981 (by Nestor the Chronicler), when Vladimir the Great of Kiev took the area over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, 1031 back to Rus', in 1340 Casimir III of Poland recovered it. In the 14th century the Galicia region along with the Sanok district were annexed to Poland by Casimir III the Great of Poland, who began colonisation of these areas (see: Walddeutsche). In the 14th and 15th centuries a number of new settlements were set up, including Trepcza, Czerte\u017c, Prusiek, Nowotaniec, Kostarowce, Tyrawa Solna, Str\u00f3\u017ce Wielkie and Ma\u0142e, H\u0142omcza, P\u0142owce, Sanoczek, Mi\u0119dzybr\u00f3d\u017a. Those settlements were owned by noble and knights\u2019 families. Substantial land was the property of the Kmita family ruling from Sobie\u0144 Castle, and Bal from Nowotaniec Castle. Nowotaniec, with upper-suburb Nagorzany,\" Nowotaniec, with Zagorzany, a small town in the county of Sanok, lies in a wooded, hilly area on the highway from Zarszyn to Bukowsko (. away). The town itself consists of a marketplace and several streets in the valley of the Pielnica River, a tributary of the Wislok on the right bank, elevation above sea level. Several streams flow into the Pielnica there from nearby hills, namely, on the west from Wysoka gora (), and on the east from Bukowica (). To the north the village of Nadolany and to the south the village of Nagorzany create a kind of suburb. Nowotaniec itself has 595 inhabitants, 428 Roman Catholic, 11 Greek Catholic, and 156 Jews. A Roman Catholic parish is headquartered there, with a beautiful church made of stone; there are also an elementary school, a manor transformed from an ancient castle, and a brewery. There is a weekly market held every Mon-day, as well as four annual fairs: on the Monday after the feast of the Holy Trinity, and on 1 May, 2 August, and 11 November. The major estate has 16 morgs of farmland; the minor estate [land owned by peasants] has 496 morgs of farm-land, 40 of meadows, and 35 of forests. We do not know much about the history of Nowotaniec. The date of its founding is unknown. In the 15th century there was a German settlement there called Lebetanz, and Piotr, its noble owner, signed his name to the document founding the parish in Humniska. Later the name was changed to Nebetanz, and finally to the one it bears today. In the 16th century the latter name had already come into general use, spelled Nowothancze or Nowotancze. The Archiwum grodzkie i ziemskie (vol. IX, Lwow 1885) contains two documents signed by Stanislaw Bal and Maciej Bal, castellans of Sanok. Nowotaniec remained in the Bals' possession until the time of King Stefan Batory. Jan Bal, cupbearer of Sanok, founded a parish there in 1492. Later Nowotaniec came to be owned - partly by way of inheritance, partly through purchases - by the Hungarian family de Stano related to the Bals. The 16th century was marked by intensified conflicts caused by the worsened living conditions in villages. Arian and Calvinistic (Nowotaniec) congregations were established, promoting protestant ideas. Hieronim de Stano was a religious dissenter and converted the church into a Helvetian congregation [i. e., Calvinist or other Swiss Protestant sect], and he paid for a minister for the congregation; but in 1613 it was returned to the Catholics. In 1643 the Sejm wanted to elevate this settlement, and for this reason established a warehouse there for Hungarian wine. During Bishop Denhoff's inspection visit in 1699 it was recorded that on one side of the church stood the castle of Aleksander de Stano, and on the other a congregation of dissenters. Several years later Boguslaw Stan sold Nowotaniec to Bukowski, royal chamberlain, and he built the church that still exists today, which was consecrated by Bishop Sierakowski in 1745 under the name of St. Mikolaj [St. Nicholas]. The parish belongs to the diocese of Przemy\u015bl, deanery of Sanok, and includes Darow, Nadolany, Nagorzany, Pielnia, Pulawy, Wola Jaworowska, and Wola Selkowa [this is probably Sekowa Wola], with a total of 1,960 Roman Catholics and 156 Greek Catholics. Not far from Nowotaniec lies the castle of Zborsko, built in 1529 by Odnowski, palatinate of Krakow. After the Bukowskis, Nowotaniec was owned by the Bronieckis, and currently Wiktor Pozniak owns the major estate and the exclusive right to produce and sell alcohol on its grounds\". [Mac.

Translated by William Fred Hoffman, PGSA Fall 2001 Rodziny a small town in the county of Sanok, lies in a wooded, hilly area on the highway from Zarszyn to Bukowsko ( away). The start of settlement that became Nowotaniec began as a royal village established in 1366 based on the Privilege of Casimir III the Great. The village was founded on the principles of the Magdeburg Rights, and its inhabitants were exempted from all taxes towards the king for a period of twenty years. In 1409, the ownership of Nowotaniec (Lobetanz) was passed over to the knights of Hungary (Petrus Hungarus de Lobetanz) and his brother. The town itself consists of a marketplace and several streets in the valley of the Pielnica river, a tributary of the Wis\u0142ok river (ger. Weisslog ) on the right bank, elevation above sea level. The parish belongs to the diocese of Przemy\u015bl, deanery of Sanok, and includes Darow, Nadolany, Nagorzany, Pielnia, Pu\u0142awy, Wola Jaworowa and Wola Sekowa with a total of 1,960 Roman Catholics and 156 Greek Catholics (in 1887). Not far from Nowotaniec lies the castle of Zboiska, built in 1529 by Odnowski, palatinate of Krak\u00f3w. The village was a center of the Polish Reformed Church and the Stano family were staunch members of it, supporting a Calvinist church in the village from the end of 16th century until 1713 when they sold the property to Roman Catholics and the Calvinist church in the village was suppressed. In the first half of the 19th century plagues fell upon the residents of the region. From the time of the Austrian annexation (1772) Nowotaniec became a subdistrict settlement First owner Mathias Bal de Lobetanz (Bals ownership since 1366 - 1556), next owners family de Stano, since 1714 the Bukowskis family. In the 17th century the village was quite important centre of trade and craftsmanship. A good period ended in 1709, when it was looted by the Swedish troops in the Great Northern War. Nowotaniec was owned by the earl Jaworski-Sas since 1767, and currently Krziwkowicz-Pozniak owns to 1944. This part of Poland was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodeship) was known as Galicia since 1772. The Roman Catholic Church in Nowotaniec has a collection of records for Nowotaniec and surrounding Roman Catholic villages in its parish like Nadolany and Nag\u00f3rzany. The Roman Catholic Church in Nowotaniec was established in 1409, the parish in 1424. At the end of World War II, after the Germans withdrew, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army became active. Its units terrorised Polish population and destroyed military and police posts. Fights ended in 1947 when as the result of Operation Vistula the Ukrainian population was resettled to Western Poland. Between 1945 - 1949 Nowotaniec was the gmina due to the destruction of Bukowsko by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The village was burned down April 1946 by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army too.3,000 in rebel band terrorized Galicia, Ukrainian Nationalists, German deserters led by SS colonel burn 3 villages (Nowoataniec, Nag\u00f3rzany, Bukowsko) in a night (by wireless to The New York Times) Sanok, Poland, April 17, 1946 \u2013 a strong, well-organized and elusive band of Ukrainian nationalists and German deserters, estimated at more than 3,000 under the leadership of a German colonel, in a fortnight have succeeded in transforming this sector of the Carpathian foothills of old Galicia into a virtual partisan stronghold. With the burning of three large villages on a single night two weeks ago, they now have made 10,000 of this area's total pre war population of 135,000 homeless and are resisting with complete success all efforts to quell what is tantamount to open insurrection. [...] The writer of this dispatch lat week went to the heart of the bandit country, to the village of Bukowsko, where on the night of April 4 the bandits burned down all but eleven of the 400 houses and made more than 3,000 persons homeless. Our escort consisted of the refugee Mayor, now in Sanok and two squads of well-armed Security Police under the command of a nervous 20-year- old second lieutenant. Before burning the village the bandits who were well armed with German and Russian automatics and machine guns, had demanded 1,000,000 zlotys tribute, and the village had raised 300,000. On the night of the fire the villagers received scant warning a few hours before from a peasant that the bandits were coming, but had not had time to remove their cattle. The first Jewish families appeared in Nowotaniec at the start of the 18th century. In 1765, 74 Jews lived in the village. They belonged to the Ryman\u00f3w community (kohal). However, they have gotten independence earlier, before 1777. Then, 10-12 Jewish families were in village. Four houses belonged to they. In 1824, community (kohal) counted 84 persons. In 1870, 249 persons were Jewish inhabitants already. Community owned synagogue and school. 22 pupils walked for school. In 1900, Jewish community counted 287 persons. Did not have community in village Rabbi. Then, 148 Jews lived in city. In 1921, village counted 524 half-breeds, these 42 Jews in Nowotaniec. 1885 - Yeshi Michal Gilernter, born 1842 was appointed rabbi.Shtetl Finder: Jewish Communities in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries in the Pale of Settlement of Russia and Poland, and in Lithuania, Latvia, Galicia, and Bukovina, with Names of Residents.
