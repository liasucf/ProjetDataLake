    "text": "The National Australia Day Council (NADC), a non-profit social enterprise owned by the Australian Government, is the national coordinating body for the Australian of the Year Awards and Australia Day. It was established in 1979 and incorporated in 1990. ==History== The Australian Natives' Association (ANA) was one of the chief promoters of Australia Day as a national holiday, and in 1946 formed an Australia Day Celebrations Committee in Melbourne to formalise its efforts. Similar bodies emerged in other states, and a Federal Australia Day Council (FADC) was formed to coordinate their efforts. In 1979, with the FADC's agreement, the organisation was replaced by a government- sponsored National Australia Day Committee. The committee was initially headed by former Olympian Herb Elliott. In 1985, it was renamed the National Australia Day Council, with former tennis player John Newcombe as president. The organisation became an incorporated public company in 1990. ==Structure and aims== The NADC heads a network of state and territory Australia Day affiliate organisations and local Australia Day committees and is designed to inspire national pride and spirit, and to enrich the life of all Australians. It aims to promote the meaning of Australia Day through activity, education, reflection, discussion and debate and to promote good citizenship, values and achievement by recognising excellence and service to the nation. ==Headquarters== The NADC offices are housed in Old Parliament House, Canberra. The Chair is Danielle Roche and the Chief Executive Officer is Christopher Kirby. ==Chairs of the Council== The following individuals have served as Chair of the National Australia Day Council: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=4|Chairs of the National Australia Day Council |- !Order !!Name !!Term begin !!
