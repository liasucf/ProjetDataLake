She currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York and is represented by Praxis Art in New York. alt= == Early life and education == Born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic Garc\u00eda has been active in the visual arts from the time she was a child.http://serieproject.org/artist-in-residence-spotlight- scherezade-garcia/ After graduating with an AAS from the Altos de Chav\u00f3n School of Design, a Parsons affiliate, in La Romana, Dominican Republic in 1986, she won a full merit scholarship to attend Parsons School of Design in New York City. She received a BFA cum laude from Parsons in 1988 and completed an MFA in Sculpture at City College of New York in 2011. Since 1986 she has lived and worked in New York. She is the sister of artist iliana emilia Garc\u00eda. == Career == She has since served on the faculty of Parsons. In 2015 she received a career grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation. Much of Garc\u00eda's work deals with themes relating to immigration and the desire to belong in a new country; she has stated that her interest lies in the Caribbean, especially the Hispanic diaspora, and her art is informed by aspects of her black and European heritage. Four of her mixed-media works are in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Other works may be found in the collections of El Museo del Barrio, the Housatonic Museum of Art, and the Museo de Arte Moderno Santo Domingo. == Selected grants, awards, and residencies == * 2017: Artist-in-residence, The Joan Mitchell Foundation Center, New Orleans, LA. * 2016: Painters and Sculptors Grant, The Joan Mitchell Foundation, New York, NY. * 2012: Artist-in-residence, The Serie Project, Serie XIX, Austin, TX. * 2005: NYC Department of Cultural Affairs Lehman College Art Gallery Grant, Bronx, NY. * 2004: Aljira Emerge 6, A Career Management and Exhibition Program for Emerging Artists * 1999: Official Dominican Republic Artist Representative, Bienal de la Habana. * 1996: Official Dominican Republic Artist Representative, International Biennal of Paintings, Haute de Cagnes, France. == Selected Works == * Paradise Redefined: at the Lehman College Art Gallery, December 2006, a sculptural installation of tent like structures covered with images of Dominican tenant buildings and bodegas, with light, street sounds and fragments of Spanish language emanating from within. Intermittently breaking wave sounds add to the mix coming from a mural size beach scene. \"The installation is concerned with issues of identity and homeland, and the expectations of a better life, which often characterize stories of migration to the United States.\" said Benjamin Gennochio critic for the New York Times. * Hurricane Sandy Altar: 2013, is a painting featured in an essay by Abigail Lapin Dardashti titled El Dorado: the Neobaroque in Dominican American Art, focusing the use of gold by Dominican artists who subvert myths and dreams constructed by imperialist and neocolonialist economic and political systems * Transit/Liquid Highway: September 2015, exhibited in the lobby of Columbia University's Wallach Art Gallery Miller Theatre, is a site-specific mural explores the relationship between the Dominican Republic and immigrants new homeland. Large images of waves and found objects both intermix losses and gains of migration *Acariciando el chivo/Caressing the Goat: The painting Garc\u00eda's painting hearkens to the 19th century after the island's separation and re-colonization by Spain. Depicted as an androgynous, Black child holding a goat, Ulises Heureaux - known as Lili and born illegitimately to a Haitian father and a mother from St.Thomas - is shown in Garcia's beautifully abstracted painting as a ghostly image existing between two swirling universes. As the man who led the country of Santo Domingo during the years 1882 until Lili's assassination in 1899 he was considered heroic, and very much a contradiction of the 20th century myth of racial whiteness that the dictator Trujillo later projected. The painting was featured in the exhibition Bordering the Imaginary: Art from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and their Diasporas, curated by Abigail Lapin Dardashti in 2018 at BRIC Gallery, which explored the dynamic of the Haitian/Dominican diaspora. * Memories of a Utopian Island: A site-specific installation and video animation Conversation Thread in collaboration with Vladimir Cybil Charlier. Two projected silhouettes of the artists tackle contemporary issues related to their island of origin that includes both Haiti and Dominican Republic. Speaking in a mixture of French, English and Spanish and Haitian Creole the silhouettes talk back and forth about an environment of equality and collaboration rather than one of friction. On another wall Borlette (Lottery) combines the sculptural inner tubes made of rice paper beaded to resemble Voodou flags, signature elements respectively of Garc\u00eda and Charlier's individual practices. == Selected Solo Exhibitions == * 1994: History of a Long Conversation, Galer\u00eda Art Nouveau, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic * 1995: Angeles ca\u00eddos/Fallen Angels, Museo de Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic * 1997: Tales of Freedom, Mary Anthony Galleries, New York, NY * 1998: Objects of War/Tales of Freedom, Leonora Vega Gallery, New York, NY * 1998: Cuentos de Salvaci\u00f3n, Galer\u00eda Ultimo Arte, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic * 2000: Paradise/Para\u00edso, Havana Biennial, Cuba * 2001: Dios, Patria y Libertad, IV Bienal del Caribe, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic * 2003: 1 x 1 Individual Projects, Jersey City Museum, Jersey City, NJ * 2006: Paradise: Selected Pieces, Crossroads Gallery, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN * 2007: Paradise Redefined, Lehman College Art Gallery, Bronx, NY * 2007: Island of Many Gods, Salena Gallery at Long Island University, Brooklyn, NY * 2008: Morir So\u00f1ando, District & Co The Gallery, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic * 2010: Theories of Freedom, International Visions Gallery, Washington, DC * 2011: Theories of Freedom, Humanities Gallery, Long Island University, Brooklyn, NY * 2012: The Postcard Haiti- Dominican Republic Project Action in collaboration with Borders of Light, Dajab\u00f3n, Dominican Republic * 2015: Super Tr\u00f3pico/Super Tropics, Lyle O.
