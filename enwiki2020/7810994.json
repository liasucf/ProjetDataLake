    "text": "A negative test can relate to: * A negative medical test, in which the target parameter that was evaluated was not present. It is unrelated to a bad prognosis, but rather whether the test itself worked or not, and a certain parameter that was evaluated was present or not. * In software testing, a test designed to determine the response of the system outside of normal parameters. It is designed to determine if the system performs error handling with unexpected input. ",
