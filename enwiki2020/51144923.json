    "text": "The William Ogburn House is a historic ruin located north of East Peru, Iowa, United States. This 1\u00bd-story limestone structure is an early example of a vernacular farm house, and the only known saltbox residence known to exist in Madison County. with It is attributed to David Harris who used innovative design variations that were not used by other local masons. The stone of the main facade is composed of finished cut quarry faced stone laid two against one with broken bond within courses. The other elevations are composed of rubble limestone. It also features quoins and jambs of finished cut quarry faced stone. The house suffered a fire so only the stone walls remain. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1865 Category:Vernacular architecture in Iowa Category:Houses in Madison County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
