    "text": "Louis Antonio Page (27 March 1899 \u2013 11 October 1959) was an England international football player and football manager. His brothers Tom, Jack and Willie were also professional footballers. He spent his youth with Everton and South Liverpool, before beginning his professional career with Stoke in 1919. After the \"Potters\" won promotion out of the Second Division, he moved on to Northampton Town in 1922. Three years later he moved up to the First Division with Burnley. He scored 111 goals in 248 league games for the \"Clarets\", before he was sold to Manchester United for a \u00a31,000 fee in March 1932. Seven months later he moved on to Port Vale, before ending his playing career in the Football League in summer 1933. He started his management career with Yeovil & Petters United, and led the club to the Southern League West Section and Western League Division 1 titles in 1934\u201335. He then returned to the Football League with Newport County. He later took charge at Glentoran, before he was put in charge at Swindon Town following the conclusion of World War II. He spent eight years in charge of the Third Division South club, before he spent three years in charge at Chester, who were struggling at the foot of the Third Division North table. ==Club career== Page began his senior career with Merseyside clubs Everton and South Liverpool. He entered professional football with Stoke during the 1919\u201320 season, scoring his first senior goal on 13 December, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Birmingham at St Andrew's. However, he featured just eight times in 1920\u201321 and then once in 1921\u201322, as the \"Potters\" won promotion out of the Second Division. He left the Victoria Ground to sign with Northampton Town of the Third Division South. The \"Cobblers\" finished eighth in 1922\u201323 and 1923\u201324, and ninth in 1924\u201325. He scored 24 goals in 122 league games at the County Ground. Page transferred to Burnley, who finished one place and one point above the First Division relegation zone in 1925\u201326. He wrote himself into the club's record books on 10 April 1926, when he scored six goals in a 7\u20131 win over Birmingham. He finished as the club's top scorer in 1925\u201326 with 26 goals. He scored 15 goals in 1926\u201327 to again become the club's top scorer, as the \"Clarets\" achieved a top five finish. They dropped to 19th in 1927\u201328, two places and one point above the relegation zone. They again finished 19th in 1928\u201329, but were this time seven points above the drop zone. Burnley were relegated in 1929\u201330, having attained a lower goal average than Sheffield United. They then finished eighth in the Second Division in 1930\u201331 and 19th in 1931\u201332. He made 248 league appearances, scoring 111 goals, during his time at Turf Moor. Page joined Walter Crickmer's Second Division side Manchester United for a \u00a31,000 fee in March 1932. He played nine games at the end of the 1931\u201332 season and three games at the start of the 1932\u201333 season, before falling out of favour under new secretary Scott Duncan and moving on to league rivals Port Vale in October 1932. He played 19 games in all competitions during the 1932\u201333 season, falling out of favour in March 1933. He was not kept on at The Old Recreation Ground beyond the campaign, and so Page left the Football League to forge a career in management. ==International career== Page featured for England seven times in 1927, alongside England and Everton great Dixie Dean. He played four British Home Championship games and three friendlies, and scored against Belgium on 1 May 1927; his goal came in the 63rd minute, in what was a 9\u20131 victory. ===Caps=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

He finished as the club's top scorer in 1933\u201334 with 23 goals. In the 1934\u201335 season, Yeovil topped both the Southern League West Section and Western League Division 1 tables. ===Newport County=== Page was appointed manager at Welsh club Newport County in 1935. The club finished 21st in the 22 team Third Division South in 1935\u201336, but successfully applied for re-election. Newport then moved up to 19th in the 1936\u201337 campaign, finishing two places and two points above the re-election zone. He left the club on 9 September 1937, a few games into the 1937\u201338 season; his successor, Billy McCandless, led the club to a 16th-place finish in the Third Division South. After leaving Newport he became trainer-coach at Glentoran in 1939\u201340, as the \"Glens\" finished third in the Irish League. He later served as manager of Liverpool-based Carlton F.C. ===Swindon Town=== When league football resumed after the Second World War, he was appointed manager of Swindon Town. Page was forced to build a completely fresh team, and so Swindon's fourth-place finish in the Third Division South in 1946\u201347 was seen as a highly respectable achievement. The \"Robins\" slumped to 16th place the following season \u2013 just two points off the bottom spot. They did though knock Burnley out of the FA Cup, before being beaten in the Fifth Round by Southampton. In 1948\u201349, Swindon again finished fourth, without ever challenging for the promotion spot. Swindon then finished 14th in 1949\u201350, 17th in 1950\u201351, 16th in 1951\u201352, and 18th in 1952\u201353. Page always had to deal with a shoestring budget at the County Ground, and was forced to sell many of his top players. Page was relieved of his duties at the end of the 1952\u201353 season, and was handed \u00a3500 in compensation. ===Chester=== He became manager of Chester in 1953. The \"Seals\" finished bottom of the Third Division North in 1953\u201354. The Sealand Road outfit again finished last in 1954\u201355, before rising to 17th in 1955\u201356. He later worked as a scout for Leicester City. ==Career statistics== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Stoke |1919\u201320 |Second Division |12||1||0||0||12||1 |- |1920\u201321 |Second Division |8||0||0||0||8||0 |- |1921\u201322 |Second Division |1||0||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !21!!1!!0!!0!!21!!1 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Northampton Town |1922\u201323 |Third Division South |39||5||1||0||40||5 |- |1923\u201324 |Third Division South |42||5||5||2||47||7 |- |1924\u201325 |Third Division South |41||14||1||0||42||14 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !122!!24!!7!!2!!129!!26 |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Burnley |1925\u201326 |First Division |41||26||2||0||43||26 |- |1926\u201327 |First Division |36||13||3||2||38||15 |- |1927\u201328 |First Division |41||22||1||0||42||22 |- |1928\u201329 |First Division |39||17||3||2||42||19 |- |1929\u201330 |First Division |32||15||1||0||33||15 |- |1930\u201331 |Second Division |29||13||0||0||29||13 |- |1931\u201332 |Second Division |30||5||1||0||31||5 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !248!!111!!11!!4!!259!!115 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Manchester United |1931\u201332 |Second Division |9||0||0||0||9||0 |- |1932\u201333 |Second Division |3||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !12!!0!!0!!0!!12!!0 |- |Port Vale |1932\u201333 |Second Division |18||2||1||0||19||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !421!!138!!19!!6!!440!!144 |} ==Honours== ===As a player=== Stoke *Football League Second Division runner- up: 1921\u201322 England *British Home Championship: 1927 (shared) ===As player- manager=== Yeovil & Petters United *Southern League West Section champions: 1934\u201335 *Western League Division 1 champions: 1934\u201335 ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Footballers from Liverpool Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Everton F.C. players Category:South Liverpool F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Yeovil Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Western Football League players Category:Association football player-managers Category:English football managers Category:Yeovil Town F.C. managers Category:Newport County A.F.C. managers Category:Glentoran F.C. managers Category:Swindon Town F.C. managers Category:Chester City F.C. managers Category:Southern Football League managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Association football coaches Category:Association football scouts ",
