Music videos were created for \"Don't Care\" and \"Metro Nome\". ==Reception== Pat Levy of Consequence of Sound gave the album a grade of B, saying, \"There are lyrics on this album that would make Prince or R. Kelly blush, but just moments later, there are lyrics that would make Leonard Cohen shed a tear.\" Zoe Camp of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.3 out of 10, saying, \"the rapper constructs his boldest collection yet, grounded in improved production and his characteristic schoolboy wit.\" Nathan Stevens of PopMatters gave the album 6 stars out of 10 and commented that \"It wouldn't be surprising if this becomes a crossover hit.\" On May 9, 2014, \"Cold Tears\" was listed by Brandon Soderberg of Spin as one of the rap songs of the week. Heavy Hearted in Doldrums was listed by Drew Millard of Vice as one of the top albums of 2014. ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 debut albums Category:Antwon albums ",
