    "text": "Depiction of the death of Abinadi According to the Book of Mormon, Abinadi ()\"Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide\", IPA-ified from \u00aba-b\u012dn\u00b4a-d\u012b\u00bb was a prophet who lived on the American continent about 150 BC. In the Book of Mormon account, Abinadi visited the court of King Noah at Lehi-Nephi, and pleaded for them to repent of their iniquity. Abinadi gave Noah the message of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to earth in the flesh, to live among the children of men. Noah and his priests threatened Abinadi that unless he recalled all the words he had said against him and his priests, they would kill him. Abinadi stood by his words and Noah had him burned with fire. One of Noah's priests, Alma the Elder, adhered to Abinadi's message and eventually became a prophet himself. ==Etymology== According to Todd Parker, the name \"Abinadi\" () appears to be symbolic. In Hebrew, ab means \"father,\" abi means \"my father,\" and nadi is \"present with you,\" so the name Abinadi may reflect his mission; it may mean something like \"my father is present with you.\" In the Book of Mormon account, the alleged reason for killing him was because Abinadi claimed that God would come down and would be with man (see ). That was the charge of blasphemy they finally used to put him to death (). ==Praise== M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles praised Abinadi for courage and obedience: \u201cAbinadi infuriated wicked King Noah with his courageous testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. Eventually this great missionary offered the ultimate sacrifice for his witness and faith but not before his pure testimony touched one believing heart. Alma, one of King Noah\u2019s priests, \u2018repented of his sins . . . , [accepted Jesus as the Christ,] and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi\u2019 (Mosiah 18:1). Many were converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ as a direct result of Abinadi\u2019s powerfully borne testimony of the Savior, believed by one soul, Alma.\u201dM. Russell Ballard, \"Pure Testimony\", Liahona, November 2004, p. 41. While serving in the Seventy, Cree-L Kofford discussed Abinadi's influence: \u201cWhat is there that is so special about Abinadi? Perhaps it was his total obedience as he went, presumably alone, among those whom he must have known would take his life, to deliver the word of the Lord and to cry repentance to the people. Perhaps it is the very fact that we know so little about him, or perhaps it was simply the way with which he faced the adversities which came into his life in such a straightforward, \u2018square-to-the world\u2019 way. Whatever the reason, Abinadi was and is special. His life, lived so long ago, still has the power to excite the mind and cause the pulse to pound.\u201d\u201cAbinadi,\u201d in Heroes from the Book of Mormon [1995], 69\u201370)Book of Mormon Student Manual, (2009), 149\u201355 ==Comparison to King Benjamin== According to Todd Parker, there are many similarities between the speeches of King Benjamin and Abinadi. # God himself shall come down (; ). # He will work mighty miracles (; ). # He will suffer temptation (; ). # He will be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God (Mosiah 3:7,8; 15:2,21). # He is the Father of heaven and earth (Mosiah 3:8; 15:4). # He will bring salvation (Mosiah 3:9; 15:1). # He will be scourged and crucified (Mosiah 3:9; 15:8). # He will overcome death (Mosiah 3:10; 15:8). # He will do these things that men can be judged (Mosiah 3:10; 15:9). # His atonement redeems those who have ignorantly sinned (Mosiah 3:11; 15:24). # Those who willfully rebel are not redeemed (Mosiah 3:12; 15:26). # All prophets declare this message (Mosiah 3:13; 16:6). # Prophets spoke as if he had already come (Mosiah 3:13; 16:6). # Because Israel was stiffnecked, a law was given them (Mosiah 3:14;13:29). # The law included types of things to come (Mosiah 3:15; 15:11). # Prophets spake concerning his coming (Mosiah 3:15; 15:11).. # Israel hardened their hearts against the prophets (Mosiah 3:15; 13:32). # Law of Moses is ineffectual without the atonement (Mosiah 3:15; 13:28). # The atonement provides eternal life for little children (Mosiah 3:16; 15:25). # Salvation is in Christ. There is no other way (Mosiah 3:17; 16:13). # The natural man is an enemy to God (Mosiah 3:19; 16:5). # The knowledge of a Savior shall spread to every nation (Mosiah 3:20; 15:28). # Receiving this message makes one accountable (Mosiah 3:22; 16:12). # Every man will be judged according to his works (Mosiah 3:24; 16:10). # Prophets' words stand as a testimony (Mosiah 3:24; 17:10). ==Type of Christ== According to Jeffrey R. Holland, Abinadi is a type of Christ.Jeffrey R. Holland, Christ and the New Covenant, pp. 171-173 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Abinadi !! Type/Shadow !!
