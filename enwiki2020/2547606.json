    "text": "\"All by Myself\" is a song by American artist Eric Carmen released in 1975. The verse is based on the second movement (Adagio sostenuto) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18, famously used to underscore the 1945 British film Brief Encounter. The chorus was taken from the song \"Let's Pretend\", which Carmen wrote and recorded with the Raspberries in 1972. The slide guitar solo was performed by studio guitarist Hugh McCracken. == Background and composition == Rachmaninoff's music was in the public domain in the United States at that time and so Carmen thought no copyright existed on it, but it was still protected outside the U.S. Subsequent to the release of the album, he was contacted by the Rachmaninoff estate and informed that it was protected. An agreement was reached in which the estate would receive 12 percent of the royalties from \"All by Myself\" as well as from \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\", which was based on the third movement from Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2.Soeder, John. \"One Lonely Song, But Many Voices Keep Eric Carmen's Tear-Jerker in Rotation\" The Plain Dealer February 12, 2006: J1Vandeventer, Mary. \"Symphony Promises a Crowd Pleaser\" The Beaumont Enterprise January 19, 2007 Carmen has stated that he also incorporated part of another melody into this song. The melody was taken from his previous hit with the Raspberries, \"Let's Pretend\", as noted above. ==Television performance== Carmen performed \"All by Myself\" and his follow-up hit, \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again,\" on The Midnight Special television program on July 23, 1976 (season 4, episode 37).

Dion's cover received positive reviews from most music critics. About.com placed the song at number 2 in their ranking of \"Top 10 Celine Dion Songs\". Entertainment Weekly editor Chuck Eddy said:\" ...But only in her desolate cover of Eric Carmen's All by Myself does she truly crash through the glass ceiling of passion\". Pip Ellwood-Hughes from Entertainment Focus called it \"incredible\" and \"one of the best recorded vocals ever captured.\" He added that \"listening to Dion reach the highs she does on that song is magical and it sends goosebumps down your spine look (sic) nothing else can.\" Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report commented: \"Demand by both programmers and the public for this rendition of Eric Carmen's 1976 smash made it the obvious choice to be the third single lifted off Celine's multi- platinum and Grammy-nominated album, Falling into You\".
