    "text": "Prince Leka of Albania (Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu, born 26 March 1982) is the only child of the first Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, and Susan Cullen-Ward. Prince Leka was an official at the Albanian Ministry of Interior and in the past has served as an advisor at the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Presidency. On 30 November 2011, he succeeded as head of the House of Zogu, titular King of the Albanians upon the death of his father. The prince is also known as Crown Prince Leka II after his father, who was referred to as Leka I. In May 2010, the Prince became engaged to Elia Zaharia, an Albanian actress and singer. They married on 8 October 2016 in Tirana. ==Early life== Leka is the son of the pretender to Albania's throne, Crown Prince Leka I, and his Australian wife Susan Cullen-Ward known as Queen Susan. At the time of his birth in 1982, the South African government declared his maternity ward temporarily Albanian territory to ensure that Leka was born on Albanian soil, although the Communist Albanian government would not have recognised it as such. He was named in honour of Egyptian president Anwar El Sadat, his grandfather King Zog I, Emperor Mohammed Reza of Iran, and Baudouin I, King of the Belgians. Msiziwe is a Zulu honorific. Leka is a member of the Zogu dynasty founded by King Zog. ==Education and activities== Leka's secondary school education took place at St Peter's College, an Anglican school in Johannesburg. In December 2005, he graduated from Sandhurst Military Academy, United Kingdom, as did his father before him. Prince Leka was named Best Foreign Student of the Academy. He was congratulated by the Albanian Minister of Defence for this achievement. He completed studies at the Universit\u00e0 per Stranieri in Perugia, Italy, in the Italian language and at the Albanian Military Academy Skanderbej. He has also studied international relations. Prince Leka resides in Tirana. He speaks Albanian, English, some Zulu, and Italian. He owns boxer dogs, and his interests include martial arts, volleyball, and swimming. He is fond of wildlife and has taken part in mountain climbing, abseiling, and target shooting. On 5 April 2004 Prince Leka accepted the Mother Teresa Medal on behalf of his late grandmother, Queen G\u00e9raldine, for her humanitarian efforts. Prince Leka is known to have worked with youth organizations, like MJAFT!, and supported a wide range of humanitarian efforts in Albania, but he maintains that he only supports self- help projects to stimulate Albanian and Kosovar economic growth, Gazeta Sot. Prince Leka is known as a supporter of Kosovo independence from Serbia and has close ties with the Kosovo leadership in Pristina. Prince Leka founded the youth leadership of the Movement for National Development, which was a movement created by his father in 2005 to change the political face of Albania. On 24 June 2010 Prince Leka unveiled a blue plaque at Parmoor House in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, which was the home of King Zog during his wartime exile. ==Career in Albanian leadership== On 21 August 2007, Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha announced that Leka had been appointed to his office. The prince intended to pursue a career in diplomacy. After two years he transferred to the office of the Minister of Interior. After the election of Bujar Nishani as president in 2012, Leka was appointed as political adviser to the President. ==Personal life== Prince Leka met Elia Zaharia in Paris, and in May 2010 they were engaged. Since then she has accompanied the Prince on most of his visits and meetings with members of other royal families. She is also head of the Queen Geraldine Foundation, which is a humanitarian, charitable and non-profit organisation, created by the Royal Court. The foundation aims to be close to the Albanian families who need help and to children who need care. It has reconstructed numerous schools and kindergartens in northern Albania, especially in the Mat District, from where the Zogu Family comes. On 27 March 2016 it was announced by Prince Sk\u00ebnder Zogu (born 1933), a member of the Albanian Royal Family, that the couple would be married on 8 October 2016 in the Royal Palace in Tirana. ===Wedding=== Prince Leka was married on Saturday 8 October 2016 in Tirana. The ceremony was a semi-official ceremony, held in Tirana in the Royal Palace, with many guests including members of other noble and royal families.
