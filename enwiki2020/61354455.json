    "text": "Lindsay J. LeBlanc is a Canadian atomic physicist. She is an associate professor of physics at University of Alberta. == Education == LeBlanc completed a BSc in engineering physics at University of Alberta. She earned a MSc and PhD at University of Toronto. She researched ferromagnetism in ultracold Fermi gas. LeBlanc won the 2011 CAP DAMPhi Thesis Prize. LeBlanc conducted a postdoctoral fellowship at the Joint Quantum Institute of National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Maryland, College Park. == Career == LeBlanc is an associate professor of physics at University of Alberta (U of A) and the Tier 2 Canada Research Chair for Quantum Simulation with Ultracold Quantum Gases. She is part of the multidisciplinary Quanta team which is made up of academic and industry experts focused on commercialising quantum technology. She is also a fellow of Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)'s quantum materials program. At U of A, LeBlanc started a research group and leads quantum simulation experiments and explores atomic quantum memory and hybrid quantum technologies. She has led development of new techniques to build quantum memories using ultracold rubidium atoms to store pulses of light encoding quantum information. She also studies hybridization of solid state devices in ultracold gasses and aims to extend quantum correlations between systems. LeBlanc's research may lead to the engineering of more energy-efficient electronic devices that use many-body behavior. In 2017, LeBlanc's research group successfully produced Bose Einstein condensate, the coldest state of matter. They are only a few groups in the world to have achieved this. == External links == * ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Canadian physicists Category:Canadian women physicists Category:Canadian women engineers Category:21st-century Canadian engineers Category:University of Alberta alumni Category:University of Alberta faculty Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:21st-century women engineers Category:21st-century women scientists Category:21st-century Canadian scientists Category:21st-century physicists ",
