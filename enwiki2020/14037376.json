Combined production at the power plants totals around 1 TWh. This acquisition brings \u00d8stfold Energi\u2019s share of Norway\u2019s total hydropower production to around 1.7 per cent. \u00d8stfold Energi is co-owner of Kvalheim Kraft DA who owns and operates the windmill park Mehuken in Sogn og Fjordane on the west coast of Norway. The wind farm was opened in 2001 with five wind turbines. In 2010 the wind farm was extended with additional eight wind turbines. The annual production of electricity is now 65 GWh. The approximately 3,000 households in the V\u00e5gs\u00f8y municipality are now self- supported with electricity from the wind turbines at Mehuken. \u00d8stfold Energi owns and operates two modern waste-to-energy plants. The plant in Sarpsborg converts waste residue (house refuse and industrial waste) into thermal energy (process steam) to Borregaard. The plant in Rakkestad provides process steam and district heating to nearby industrial companies. Totally 181 GWh thermal energy was produced at the waste-to-energy plants during 2010. The company also holds ownership of Zephyr (33%), Norsk Gr\u00f8nnkraft (25%), Kvalheim Kraft (33%), Rygge sivile lufthavn (15%) and Hafslund (4.5%).

In 2011, NIB and the Norwegian energy company \u00d8stfold Energi signed a loan totalling NOK 179 million (EUR 23 million) for financing investments in wind and hydropower production, and district heating plants. In 2014, \u00d8stfold Energi sold its shares in EfW heat provider, Hafslund ASA. The managing director Oddmund Kroken said, the energy firm will use the cash to invest \u20ac30.7m in other renewable energy projects. In April 2017, Orkla, Thon Holding AS and \u00d8stfold Energi have entered into an agreement with the investment company Jotunfjell Partners for the sale of Rygge Sivile Lufthavn AS. ==History== The company was created through the 1960s to the 1980s as a merger between the municipal owned power companies throughout \u00d8stfold, with only five municipalities not joining. Until 1997 the company was named \u00d8stfold Energiverk. In 2000 49% of the grid and retail subsidiaries were sold to Swedish Sydkraft, and in 2003 Sydkraft took over the distribution, installation and retailing subsidiaries while the power production was left in \u00d8stfold Energi. The same year Sydkraft swapped its ownership to Fortum in a business deal. ==References== Category:Electric power companies of Norway Category:Companies based in \u00d8stfold Category:Energy companies established in 1900 Category:1900 establishments in Norway Category:Companies owned by municipalities of Norway Category:County-owned companies of Norway Category:\u00d8stfold County Municipality ",
