    "text": "Alcide Charles Victor Marie Dessalines d'Orbigny (6 September 1802 \u2013 30 June 1857) was a French naturalist who made major contributions in many areas, including zoology (including malacology), palaeontology, geology, archaeology and anthropology. D'Orbigny was born in Cou\u00ebron (Loire-Atlantique), the son of a ship's physician and amateur naturalist. The family moved to La Rochelle in 1820, where his interest in natural history was developed while studying the marine fauna and especially the microscopic creatures that he named \"foraminiferans\". In Paris he became a disciple of the geologist Pierre Louis Antoine Cordier (1777\u20131861) and Georges Cuvier. All his life, he would follow the theory of Cuvier and stay opposed to Lamarckism. ==South American era== D'Orbigny travelled on a mission for the Paris Museum, in South America between 1826 and 1833. He visited Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, and returned to France with an enormous collection of more than 10,000 natural history specimens. He described part of his findings in La Relation du Voyage dans l'Am\u00e9rique M\u00e9ridionale pendant les ann\u00e9s 1826 \u00e0 1833 (Paris, 1824\u201347, in 90 fascicles). The other specimens were described by zoologists at the museum. His contemporary, Charles Darwin, arrived in South America in 1832, and on hearing that he had been preceded, grumbled that D'Orbigny had probably collected \"the cream of all the good things\". Darwin later called D'Orbigny's Voyage a \"most important work\". They went on to correspond, with D'Orbigny describing some of Darwin's specimens. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie of Paris in 1834. The South American Paleocene pantodont Alcidedorbignya was named in his honour. ==1840 and later== On the shore of Rio Magdalen. Image from Voyages pittoresque dans les deux Am\u00e9riques In 1840, d'Orbigny started the methodical description of French fossils and published La Pal\u00e9ontologie Fran\u00e7aise (8 vols). In 1849 he published a closely related Prodrome de Pal\u00e9ontologie Stratigraphique, intended as a \"Preface to Stratigraphic Palaeontology\", in which he described almost 18,000 species, and with biostratigraphical comparisons erected geological stages, the definitions of which rest on their stratotypes. In 1853 he became professor of palaeontology at the Paris Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, publishing his Cours \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire that related paleontology to zoology, as a science independent of the uses made of it in stratigraphy.\"Conception et suites de la Pal\u00e9ontologie fran\u00e7aise d'Alcide d'Orbigny\", Comptes Rendus Paleologiques 1.7 (December 2002) pp. 599\u2013613. The chair of paleontology was created especially in his honor. The d'Orbigny collection is housed in the Salle d'Orbigny and is often visited by experts.Agn\u00e8s Lauriat-Rag, \"La collection d'Invert\u00e9br\u00e9s fossiles d'Alcide d'Orbigny et la salle d'Orbigny\", Comptes Rendus Paleologiques 1.7 (December 2002) pp. 615\u2013627. He described the geological timescales and defined numerous geological strata, still used today as chronostratigraphic reference such as Toarcian, Callovian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, Aptian, Albian and Cenomanian. He died in the small town of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, near Paris. ==Catastrophism== D'Orbigny, a disciple of Georges Cuvier, was a notable advocate of catastrophism.Huggett, Richard J. (1998). Catastrophism: Asteroids, Comets and Other Dynamic Events in Earth History. Verso. p. 95. He recognized twenty-seven catastrophes in the fossil record.Singer, Charles Joseph. (1931). The Story of Living Things: A Short Account of the Evolution of the Biological Sciences. Harper & Bros. p. 232 This became known as the \"doctrine of successive creations\".Prothero, Donald R. (2013). Bringing Fossils to Life: An Introduction to Paleobiology. Columbia University Press. p. 223. He attempted to reconcile the fossil record with the Genesis creation narrative. Both uniformitarian geologists and theologians rejected his idea of successive creations. Palaeontologist Carroll Lane Fenton has noted that his idea of twenty-seven world-wide creations was \"absurd\", even for creationists.Fenton, Carroll Lane. (1933). The World Of Fossils. D. Appleton- Century Company. p. 162 L. Sprague de Camp has written that \"Alcide d'Orbigny, carried the idea to absurdity. Dragging in the supernatural, d'Orbigny argued that, on twenty-seven separate occasions, God had wiped out all life on earth and started over with a whole new creation.\"De Camp, Lyon Sprague. (1968). The Great Monkey Trial. Doubleday p. 184. ==Taxa== Several zoological and botanical taxa were named in his honor, including the following genera and species. *Alcidedorbignya \u2013 an extinct genus of pantodont mammal *Alcidia Bourguignat, 1889 \u2013 a genus of sea snails *Ampullaria dorbignyana Philippi, 1851 \u2013 a species of freshwater snail *Apostolepis dorbignyi Schlegel, 1837 \u2013 a species of burrowing snakeBeolens et al. *Asthenes dorbignyi Reichenbach, 1853 \\- a species of furnariid bird *Bachia dorbignyi A.M.C.
