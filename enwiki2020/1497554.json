    "text": "Maipo is a stratovolcano in the Andes, lying on the border between Argentina and Chile. It is located south of Tupungato and about southeast of Santiago. It has a symmetrical, conical volcanic shape, and is among the southernmost 5,000 metre peaks in the Andes. Maipo is located within the Diamante caldera, a feature measuring 15 km by 20 km that is about half a million years old. It rises about 1,900 m (6,230 ft) above the floor of the caldera. Immediately to the east of the peak, on the eastern side of the caldera floor, is Laguna del Diamante, a lake that formed when lava flows blocked drainage channels from the caldera in 1826. The Diamante Caldera erupted of tephra, 450 ka. The region's climate is transitional between the drier Mediterranean climate of the peaks to the north and the cold, moist climate of Chilean Patagonia. Hence, while less glaciated than Patagonia, it has more permanent snow on the wet, Chilean side than peaks of similar elevation to the north. ==See also== * List of volcanoes in Chile * List of volcanoes in Argentina ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * Volcan Maipo or Maip\u00fa (span.) * * Satellite image of Maipo Category:Mountains of Mendoza Province Category:Volcanoes of Mendoza Province Category:Mountains of Santiago Metropolitan Region Category:Volcanoes of Santiago Metropolitan Region Category:Stratovolcanoes of Chile Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Active volcanoes Category:VEI-7 volcanoes Category:Stratovolcanoes of Argentina Category:Argentina\u2013Chile border Category:International mountains of South America Category:Five- thousanders of the Andes Category:Principal Cordillera ",
