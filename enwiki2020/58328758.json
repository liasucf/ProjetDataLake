The school was located on Valley Road in the Maple Valley section of Clifton and was named for Pope Paul VI, who was the incumbent pontiff when the school opened. ==General information== Paul VI was one of several parochial schools in Clifton but was its only parochial high school. The school was located at 775 Valley Road, next to St. Philip the Apostle School; both were operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson. Paul VI's athletic teams were known as the Patriots. For much of the 1980s they were members of the Bergen-Passaic Scholastic League, where they kept a rivalry with Paterson Catholic High School. The Patriots won the Non-Public Group B North state championship in football for 1978.NJSIAA Football History, New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. Accessed September 13, 2018.

Accessed September 13, 2018. ==Closure and later use== Following the 1989\u20131990 school year, the Paterson Diocese closed Paul VI Regional High School. The Valley Road facility became home to Pope John Paul II Elementary School, which opened in 1992 but closed in 2009 after declining enrollment. The Paterson Diocese then began using the building as an office complex; it would become a temporary home for elementary students at the adjacent St. Philip's School, which was damaged in a 2018 fire. ==Notable alumni== * Diego Anthony Scaglione, class of 1990, CPA and CFO for Fortune 500 ABM Industries, INC. * Kristin Corrado, politician who represents the 40th Legislative District in the New Jersey Senate.Senator Kristin Corrado, New Jersey Senate Republicans.
