    "text": "The Tumbes-Piura dry forests (NT0232) is an arid tropical ecoregion along the Pacific coasts of southern Ecuador and northern Peru. The ecoregion contains many endemic species of flora and birds adapted to the short wet season followed by a long dry season. Threats include extraction of wood for fuel or furniture, and capture of wild birds for sale. ==Location== The Tumbes-Piura dry forests ecoregion has an area of . The northern tip is in the southern coastal plain of Ecuador, while most of the ecoregion is in the northwestern coastal plain of Peru. It covers all or part of the regions of Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque and Cajamarca in northern Peru. Further north the similar Ecuadorian dry forests extend along the coast of central Ecuador. The Andes rise to the east. The northern tip of the ecoregion adjoins the Guayaquil flooded grasslands. In the north it is bounded to the west by a stretch of South American Pacific mangroves and to the east by Northwestern Andean montane forests. Further south the ecoregion reaches to the Pacific Ocean to the west, and adjoins Eastern Cordillera Real montane forests to the east. Further south again it is bordered by Sechura Desert to the west and to the east by patches of Mara\u00f1\u00f3n dry forests, Peruvian Yungas and Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo. ==Physical== The terrain includes coastal lowlands, low undulating hills and the foothills of the Andes. The soils in the lower regions are mostly sand and clay formed during the recent Holocene epoch. Higher up the soils are made of Precambrian amphibolites, Paleozoic granites, Devonian quartzites and black slate, and Carboniferous dark limestone, sandstone and lutites. The main rivers, which mostly rise in Ecuador and flow throughout the year, are the Guayas, Zarumilla, Tumbes, Piura and Chira rivers. Other streams are seasonal, flowing only in the rainy season. ==Climate== The climate is dry. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification is \"BWh\": arid; desert; hot arid. Average annual temperature is . At a sample location at coordinates mean annual temperature is just under , with average maximum of and minimum of . Mean monthly temperatures range from in July\u2013August to in February\u2013March. There is a rainy season from January to March and a marked dry season. Typical annual rainfall is . The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation is a major event in the region, when rainfall increases and thousands of plants species germinate, providing food for many animal species. ==Ecology== The Tumbes-Piura dry forests ecoregion is in the neotropical realm, in the tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests biome. It is part of the Tumbes-Choc\u00f3-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot, one of 25 biogeographic regions globally that have with a significant reservoir of biodiversity under threat from humans. The ecoregion is part of the Tumbesian-Andean Valleys Dry Forests global ecoregion, which holds six terrestrial ecoregions: Tumbes-Piura dry forests, Ecuadorian dry forests, Pat\u00eda Valley dry forests, Magdalena Valley dry forests, Cauca Valley dry forests and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n dry forests. The fauna and flora of the global ecoregion have high levels of endemism. ===Flora=== There is a wide range of habitats, including desert areas with shrubs and cactuses and dense thorn forests. Many species of flora are endemic, adapted to the arid conditions. Large areas are covered by seasonal dry forests that lose their leaves after the rainy season. Common species in the dry forests include Loxopterygium huasango, Handroanthus billbergii and holy wood (Bursera graveolens), all threatened by human exploitation. Other common species are Ziziphus thyrsiflora, Caesalpinea corymbosa, Capparis angulata, Bombax discolor, Pitthecellobium multiflorum and Geoffroya striata. The ceibal forest mainly holds the endemic Ceiba trischistandra. The chaparral is mainly made up of shrubs such as papelillo (Bouganvillea species), cacti and the overo (Cordia lutea). The area is rich in mesquite (Prosopis genus), which capture and fix nitrogen in their roots, enriching the soil and assisting other species. The algarrobal is mainly composed of algarrobo (Prosopis genus). grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis) in southern Ecuador ===Fauna=== There are six orders of mammals, two orders of reptiles and one order of amphibians. Typical fauna include southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), Guayaquil squirrel (Sciurus stramineus) and green iguana (Iguana iguana). Endangered reptiles include green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). The false monitor tegu (Callopistes flavipunctatus) is Near Threatened. Endangered amphibians include phantasmal poison frog (Epipedobates tricolor). There are 14 orders of birds, with significant endemism. Bird species include El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi) and white-edged oriole (Icterus graceannae). Endangered birds include grey- cheeked parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhoptera), grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis), rufous flycatcher (Myiarchus semirufus), slaty becard (Pachyramphus spodiurus), white-winged guan (Penelope albipennis), Peruvian plantcutter (Phytotoma raimondii), El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi), yellow- bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis), Peruvian tern (Sternula lorata) and blackish-headed spinetail (Synallaxis tithys). The bronze-winged parrot (Pionus chalcopterus) and saffron siskin (Spinus siemiradzkii) are also endangered. Birds with limited distribution include white-tailed jay (Cyanocorax mystacalis) and red-masked parakeet (Psittacara erythrogenys). ==Status== The World Wildlife Foundation gives the ecoregion a status of \"Critical/Endangered\". In the past, the ecoregion suffered from extract of selected fauna and flora. This included capture of parrots and parakeets for sale as pets, hunting some mammals and reptiles for food, and extraction of wood for firewood, charcoal and timber. As of 2000 some recent improvements had been observed, in part due to El Ni\u00f1o effects and in part to establishment of the Cerros de Amotape National Park. The park management and other groups were working with communities to find ways to maintain biodiversity. Protected areas also include the Reserva del Noroeste biosphere reserve. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:Neotropical dry broadleaf forests Category:Ecoregions of Ecuador Category:Ecoregions of Peru ",
