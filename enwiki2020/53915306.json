He performed all of the combine and positional drills, finishing seventh among safeties in the 40-yard dash. Woods also tied for second in the three-cone drill, tied for third among his position group in the bench press, and sixth in the broad jump. On March 23, 2017, he participated at Louisiana Tech's pro day, along with Carlos Henderson, Trent Taylor, and 12 other prospects. Woods beat his times at the combine in the 40-yard dash (4.51), 20-yard dash (2.59), and 10-yard dash (1.58) while also performing positional drills for scouts and team representatives from all 32 NFL teams. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Woods was projected by NFL draft experts and scouts to be selected anywhere from the fourth to sixth rounds. He was ranked as the seventh best strong safety in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. The Dallas Cowboys selected Woods in the sixth round (191st overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. On May 11, he was signed to a four-year, $2.55 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $159,888. Throughout training camp, Woods competed for a roster spot against Robert Blanton, Kavon Frazier, and Jameill Showers. Head coach Jason Garrett named him the backup free safety to Byron Jones to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Dallas Cowboys' season-opening 19-3 victory over the New York Giants. On September 25, Woods recorded three solo tackles and deflected a pass in the Cowboys' 28-17 victory at the Arizona Cardinals. He recorded his first career tackle on the opening kickoff on Cardinals' running back Kerwynn Williams after a 21-yard kick return. On November 12, he collected four combined tackles, defended a pass, and made his first career interception off a deflected pass from Atlanta Falcons' quarterback Matt Ryan during a 27-7 loss. The following week, Woods earned his first career start at strong safety after Jeff Heath suffered a concussion the previous week against the Falcons. He recorded five combined tackles as the Cowboys were routed by the Philadelphia Eagles 37-9. In Week 11, Woods earned the starting strong safety job and recorded three combined tackles during a 38-14 win against the Washington Redskins. Because of injuries to other players he was moved between safety and slot cornerback during the season, and although he had some problems tackling, he finished with 41 tackles and one interception. In Week 9 of the 2019 season, Woods recorded an interception and a forced fumble in a 37-18 win over the New York Giants, earning him NFC Defensive Player of the Week. ==References== ==External links== * Louisiana Tech Bulldogs bio * Dallas Cowboys bio Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from West Monroe, Louisiana Category:Players of American football from Louisiana Category:American football safeties Category:Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football players Category:Dallas Cowboys players ",
