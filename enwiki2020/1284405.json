Philip Hwang, a Utah State University graduate born in North KoreaUSU Alumni newsletter, Feb. 2004 who had run a business producing CRT monitors for arcade games since 1975. The company was headquartered in San Jose, California.

Up to sixteen of these machines could be connected to proprietary multi-user systems through serial interfaces. In April, 1983, TeleVideo introduced an MS-DOS 2.0 compatible personal computer based on the Intel 8088. This was introduced as the Model TS-1603 and included 128 KB RAM (expandable up to 256 KB), integrated monitor, modem and keyboard. The Model TS-1603 ran both TeleVideo PC DOS 2.0 and CP/M-86 1.1. The company later turned to manufacturing Windows compatible thin client computers, but eventually sold this business line to Neoware in October 2005. The latter was subsequently taken over by Hewlett-Packard in 2007. On March 14, 2006, TeleVideo, Inc. filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
