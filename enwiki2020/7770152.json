    "text": "\"Lonely This Christmas\" is a popular Christmas song by the English glam rock band Mud, that topped the UK Singles Chart in 1974, selling over 750,000 copies and reaching Christmas number one. ==Song== Written and produced by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, \"Lonely This Christmas\" was Mud's second number one single in the UK, spending four weeks at the top in December 1974 and January 1975. It was the third number one single that year for the ChinniChap writing and production team, and was performed in the style of Elvis Presley's slower songs from his later career. ==Performances== The song is noted for a performance on Top of the Pops in which guitarist Rob Davis was covered in tinsel and wore Christmas baubles as earrings, while vocalist Les Gray sang to a ventriloquist's dummy. Its final appearance on Top of the Pops was on 8 January 1975, which was coincidentally the fortieth birthday of Elvis Presley. At the conclusion of the song, vocalist Les Gray turned to the camera and solemnly said, 'Happy birthday Elvis, wherever you are.' ==Versions== The song has been covered by Lucky Soul, Miss Vincent, Blue, Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine (as part of a fan club limited edition Xmas 7 inch), Little Man Tate, KT Tunstall, Los Campesinos!, and The Growlers. The song has been used as background music in North American Buick Lacrosse commercials. Despite several incorrectly-labelled videos on YouTube, Elvis Presley never recorded the song. Those videos tend to be the Mud or James Memphis King versions. == Chart performance == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1974) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:Songs about loneliness Category:1974 singles Category:British Christmas songs Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Dutch Top 40 number-one singles Category:Single Top 100 number-one singles Category:Ultratop 50 Singles (Flanders) number-one singles Category:Songs written by Nicky Chinn Category:Songs written by Mike Chapman Category:1974 songs Category:RAK Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Mike Chapman Category:Mud (band) songs ",
