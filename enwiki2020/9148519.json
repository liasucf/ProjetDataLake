She was a student of S.M St Anne, Labuan, S.M.K Labuan, Tunku Abdul Rahman University College and Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. She was a participant in Malaysian Idol in 2004, but she was eliminated in the first round. Kong's debut single was launched in January 2007.

Her debut EP also includes her singles Cinta Hello Kitty and Ku Tak Upaya, both penned by fellow Malaysian songwriter Asmin Mudin (writer of Malaysian Idol Jaclyn Victor's Gemilang).Singer shows multi- cultural heritage with album Both were featured on several radio station top charts including ERA, Xfresh and others. On 15 January 2007, Kong released her full Malay album, Mulakan, which not only featured the debut single, but also nine other tracks including Na Na Na Nada Cinta, a remake of the Japanese song La La La Love Song by Toshinobu Kubota. On 17 July 2007, she made a first in the Malaysian music scene by being the first artiste to hold a web concert. In September, she announced her plan to produce a Mandarin album (and her Chinese stage name, as stated above). The album, titled Showtime, which has since been finished and scheduled for release on 27 October, however, hit a snag when it was found that retail stores refuse to distribute or sell the album. This lead her company to only sell her album in a 50-leg promotional tour around the country. In year 2009, Universal Music decided to bring her international recognition by re-launching her career in Taiwan.Malaysian singer Karen Kong lives it up in Hong Kong.
