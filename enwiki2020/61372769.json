The Blizzard compete in the Rocky Mountain Lacrosse League. == History == Formed in 2010 as the Manitoba Gryphons, the team was the first Manitoba-based team to join the Rocky Mountain Lacrosse League. After a two- year probationary period the Gryphons were granted full league membership for the 2012 season in which they finished 10-9-0, sixth best in the 10-team league. They Gryphons were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. The Gryphons hosted Founders Cup 2013 in Winnipeg finishing in fifth place. The team would see ownership/management changes in the off-season and were renamed the Blizzard. The club also relocated from their original home in Oakbank to Notre Dame Arena. As the lone Junior B team in the province, the Gryphons/Blizzard annually represent Manitoba at Founders Cup. The team has played for the Bronze medal on four occasions falling short each time. It hosted the Founders Cup 2019 in Winnipeg. == Season-by-season == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Manitoba Gryphons/Blizzard !Season !W !L !T !Pts !GF !GA !Finish !Playoffs !Founders Cup finish |- |2011 |7 |7 |0 |14 |127 |130 |5th of 6 South |Not eligible |4th - Lost vs Saskatchewan SWAT |- |2012 |10 |9 |0 |20 |170 |201 |4th of 6 South |Lost vs Calgary Shamrocks (2-1) |7th |- |2013 |12 |7 |1 |25 |189 |174 |3rd of 6 South |Won vs Calgary Chill (2-0); Lost vs Calgary Mountaineers (2-0) |5th |- |2014 |13 |7 |0 |26 |207 |180 |3rd of 6 South |DNQ |4th - Lost vs Nova Scotia |- |2015 |14 |6 |0 |28 |209 |145 |2nd of 5 North |Won vs Edmonton Warriors (3-1); Round robin (2-1); Won vs Calgary Chill; Lost vs Saskatchewan SWAT |5th |- |2016 |15 |5 |0 |30 |235 |151 |3rd of 6 South |Won vs SWAT (2-0); Round robin (2-1); Won vs Red Deer Rampage; Won vs Chill \\- Champion |8th |- |2017 |18 |2 |0 |36 |247 |170 |1st of 6 North |Round robin (2-1); Won vs Chill; Won vs Rampage \\- Champion |4th - Lost vs Seneca WarChiefs |- |2018 |18 |2 |0 |36 |246 |116 |1st of 3 East |Won vs SWAT (2-0); Round robin (1-3) |4th - Lost vs Coquitlam Adanacs |- |2019 |13 |7 |0 |26 |203 |189 |1st of 3 East |Won vs SWAT (2-0); Round robin (TBD) |TBD |} ==Founders Cup== CANADIAN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
