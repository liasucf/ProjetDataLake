    "text": "Pub Is the debut album by the British band Denzil, released in 1994. ==Critical reception== AllMusic gave the album a positive review, and wrote: \"Based around Denzil's everyman voice and workmanlike acoustic guitar, the well-recorded tunes are usually augmented by drums, bass, jangly electric guitar, and other well-chosen instruments. This excellent album and artist were nearly completely overlooked.\" Billboard praised the \"clever\" lyrics and \"charmingly rough-edged\" singing. The Washington Post declared that \"every one of the 16 songs on Pub boasts an ear-catching melody driven by an energetic, economical rhythm section.\" ==Track listing== #\"Fat Loose Fancies Me\" #\"Running This Family\" #\"Rake Around The Grave\" #\"Useless\" #\"Sunday Service Hengistbury Head\" #\"Too Scared To Be True\" #\"Bastard Son of Elvis\" #\"Funnymoon\" #\"Shame\" #\"Who Made You So Cynical About Me?\" #\"Autistic\" #\"If Only Alan Won The Pools\" #\"Seven Years in These Boots\" #\"Your Sister Song\" #\"Cutie\" #\"Goodnight Darling\" ==Personnel== *Denzil Thomas - vocals, guitar *Steve Ennever - bass, harmonica *Craig Boyd - guitar *Andrew Place - drums *Jeremy Stacey - drums *Tich - fiddle *Jo Garret - additional vocals ==References== ==External links== *YouTube: www.youtube.com/user/denzilpub Category:1994 debut albums Category:Giant Records (Warner) albums ",
