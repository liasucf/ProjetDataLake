She attended a boarding school, Stamford High School, as a child, and went on to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Cohu said that, despite her family's strong military background, her parents were entirely supportive of her desire to be an actress. Cohu lives in Kensal Green in Brent, London. ==Personal life== Cohu was married to the actor Corey Johnson, but later divorced.\"I still pine for my lost love:interview Lucy Cohu : The Secret House of Death\", The Mirror, 15 March 1996 ==Television and film work== Before she made a living from acting she used to perform for children's parties. She has been quoted as saying that had she not found success as an actress she would have gone into children's nursing. Cohu's first acting job after graduating from drama school was at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, in a production of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. She made her television debut in an episode of Casualty. She went on to work extensively in television, including playing the role Major Jessica Bailey in the popular ITV show Soldier Soldier followed by many parts in British television. In 2005 she portrayed Princess Margaret in the semi-fictional version of her life, The Queen's Sister, for Channel 4, for which she was nominated for Emmy and BAFTA awards. She was widely praised for the role; for example, Variety disliked the \"somewhat tawdry biopic\", but said that \"Cohu makes it all worth watching\". Cohu herself said she played Margaret like a proper woman with an insatiable and tremendous energy for life: previous images in her mind had been of a bloated and sick courtier confined to a wheelchair. She hoped the production hadn't offended anyone as she really liked the Queen. Cohu has also appeared in Cape Wrath, Ballet Shoes, as Theo Danes,All-star cast dance onto BBC One in Ballet Shoes BBC Press Office. 2007-08-11, and Torchwood: Children of Earth, as Alice Carter, the daughter of Captain Jack Harkness. Cohu has also appeared in several films, including Gosford Park and Becoming Jane. She plays Madame Maigret in the ITV television series Maigret starring Rowan Atkinson. ==Theatre work== After an eight-year hiatus from the stage, Cohu starred in a revival of Speaking in Tongues at the Duke of York's Theatre, opposite John Simm, Ian Hart and Kerry Fox. Cohu received positive reviews for this performance. In February 2010 she began a five-week run in a production of An Enemy of the People at the Crucible Theatre, starring alongside Sir Antony Sher as Katrina Stockmann, and later appeared in Arthur Miller's Broken Glass at the Tricycle Theatre. ==Awards== In November 2008 Cohu won an international Emmy award for Best Actress for her role in the true-life drama Forgiven. ==Filmography== ===Television=== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" align=\"center\" !
