    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Exhibition tournament was played from 24 to 26 October 1968 on the clay courts of the Chapultepec Sports Center in Mexico City, Mexico. All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a player had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Due to the short length of the tournament, no third place match was played, and both semifinal losers received bronze medals. American Peaches Bartkowicz won the title by defeating her compatriot Julie Heldman 6\u20133, 6\u20132 in the final. Both Brazilian Suzana Petersen and Ecuatorian Mar\u00eda Eugenia Guzm\u00e1n won bronze medals. ==Seeds== Both seeds received a bye into the quarterfinals. ==Draw== ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) Exhibition Category:Women's events at the 1968 Summer Olympics Olym ",
