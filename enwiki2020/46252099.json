    "text": "Three Bridges, properly known as Windmill Bridge, is a three-level crossing of bridges near Hanwell in west London, United Kingdom. Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the bridges are a clever arrangement allowing the routes of the Grand Junction Canal, Great Western and Brentford Railway, and Windmill Lane to cross each other: road above canal above railway. Work began in 1856, and was completed on 16 July 1859. The project was Brunel's last before he died on 15 September 1859, just two months after its completion. The structure is a scheduled monument. ==See also== *List of canal aqueducts in Great Britain ==References== Category:Scheduled ancient monuments in London Category:Navigable aqueducts in England Category:Bridges by Isambard Kingdom Brunel ",
