He was born to a Druze family in Kahlouniyeh in the Chouf region of the Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon during the Ottoman era. He took part in the Great Syrian Revolt against French rule in 1925-27.Swayd 2009, pp. 139-140. During the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Sa'b led a contingent of some 30 Lebanese volunteers, mostly Druze, to aid local rebels fighting against British rule and the growing Zionist movement.Parsons, ed. Schayegh 2015, p. 395. Sa'b and all of the volunteer contingents from the Arab world were under the overall command of Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian anti-colonialist rebel leader. Much of Sa'b's activity was centered in northern Palestine, particularly around the village of Bal'a,Artzi 1978, p. 174. where his rebels fought a battle against British forces on 3 September 1936, in which two Druze volunteers were killed, including Mahmud Abu Yahya, a well-known rebel from the Great Syrian Revolt.Artzi 1978, p. 179. In 1941, Sa'b died fighting the British Army in Iraq. The vehicle he was traveling had been bombed by British forces, and according to local accounts, Sa'b died protecting al-Qawuqji who was also in the vehicle. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:1891 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Druze people of Lebanese nationality Category:Guerrillas killed in action Category:Military personnel killed in World War II Category:Lebanese Arab nationalists Category:People from Chouf District Category:People of the Great Syrian Revolt Category:Rebel commanders of the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine ",
