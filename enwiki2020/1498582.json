Desi hip hop is a term for music and culture which combines the influences of hip hop and the Indian subcontinent; the term desi referring to the South Asian diaspora. The term has also come to be used as an alternative for rap music and even pop music which involves rappers of South Asian origins. == Overview == Apache Indian, UK artist of Indian origin, was the earliest to make an impact on the UK charts with a series of hits during the nineties.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p.13 Baba Sehgal introduced Hindi rap in the nineties with his albums. His album Thanda Thanda Pani (1992) sold 100,000 copies in three and a half months and brought rap music to the Indian club scene. In the 2000s the desi hop scene remained limited largely to the underground, with a very niche loyal audience. Hip-hop culture, including graffiti and b-boying started seeping into the club scene and street culture of big cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Ashok Kumar\u2019s recitation of Harindranath Chattopadhyay\u2019s poem Rail Gaadi is considered to be one of the first rap songs in Bollywood. It was featured in the film Aashirwad (1968). In the 1990s rap started getting popular following the success of Baba Sehgal\u2019s album Thanda Thanda Paani. One of the early moments of Indian hip hop was the Bengali-language underground film Gandu which narrated a story of a rapper and had a soundtrack which mixed rap with alternative rock. Besides Bollywood and commercial rap music, the underground hip-hop scene started shaping. Many emerging rappers, crews started to create a buzz in the underground hip-hop scene. In north India groups like 2 ShadeZ, Desi Beam , while in south Machas With Attitude, Hiphop Tamizha, Street Academics pioneered respective vernacular rap music scenes. In Mumbai Mumbai's Finest, Bombay Bassment, Gully Gang became popular. There was increased interest in the rap genre in India after 2011, with many rappers emerging from across the country. This is largely credited to the success of Yo Yo Honey Singh in India and Bollywood, India's Hindi film industry. Following huge success of his album International Villager, Singh went on to release several hits songs both in independently and in Bollywood. In the wake of success of Honey Singh, a new trend was formed in Bollywood with many producers roping in rap artists for their songs. Even some big Bollywood actors like Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar and Varun Dhawan tried their hands at rapping. Indian hip hop has picked up steam in the suburbs of India's biggest cities creating big names like Divine, Emiway Bantai, Naezy, Muhfaad, Raga & Raftaar who have been picked up by talent management agencies like OML who now have music videos with millions of views on YouTube. Down in the scene, rappers like Brodha V and KR$NA have kept the flag of the Indian hip hop flying high. Due to the exposure through Bollywood, rap became a household term and an increased production of rap music was observed, especially in the Punjabi music industry. There is an ongoing debate among the hip-hop community about the contribution of Honey Singh to the genre. While some artists including Badshah, Ikka, Deep Money, Manj Musik and Bohemia have acknowledged his contribution to the industry, others like Raftaar, some Pakistani artists and Imran Khan have openly denied it. There is also a negative sentiment among some followers of hip-hop culture in India regarding the recent commercialization of the genre. Even though many fans are not happy with the recent commercialization of hip-hop in India, this commercialization has also led to expansion of the underground scene, with independent artists building a name in Indian hip hop. Because of this, the future of hip-hop in India is generally perceived to be positive. There are many rappers in India, rapping in different languages like Odia, Punjabi, Marathi, Bengali, Hindi, Bhojpuri, Khasi etc. Tamil hip hop is getting popular in India. Artists like Brodha V, Dopeadelicz and Yogi B are known for their acts in Tamil language. Many other south Indian languages like Kannada, Telugu and Marathi is also becoming popular among masses in India. == Protest hip hop == Protest music has invariably found its way within Indian hip-hop from the early years. Blaaze's track 'Ban the Crooked Police' was an early track, while Delhi Sultante's side-project Word Sound Power paved the way for socially conscious protest music wherein he work with folk musicians from Orissa and Punjab to craft a mix of reggae, dub and Indian folk sounds. Protest hip hop came into limelight after mass protest started all over India against the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019. Since the crackdown in JMI, AMU and JNU, and the 2020 Delhi riots several rappers from all over the country have joined the cause with their own sonic protest. Rappers like Madara, Rapper Shaz, Santhanam Srinivasan Iyer (EPR), Ahmer and Sumit Roy gained recognition for their protest songs. ==References== Category:Hip hop by country Category:Indian music ",
