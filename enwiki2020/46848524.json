It is part of the Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science. ==History== POLIS, formed in 2009 by the merger of the former Department of Politics and the Centre for International Studies, is administratively housed at the university's Alison Richard Building on the Sidgwick Site and is part of the Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science. Its primary predecessor, the Department of Politics, was formed in 2004, prior to which political science had been fragmented across other departments. Notable teaching staff include Andrew Gamble, Peter Nolan, Brendan Simms, Marc Weller, Duncan Bell, Baroness Smith of Newnham, and Ay\u015fe Zarakol. ==Centres and programmes== Nine specialised programmes and research centres are housed within the department: the Centre for Governance and Human Rights, the Cambridge Centre for Political Thought, the Centre of International Studies, the Centre of Development Studies, the Centre for the Study of International Relations of the Middle East and North Africa, the European Centre at POLIS, the Forum on Geopolitics, Cambridge Public Policy, and the Cambridge Review of International Affairs. ==Degrees and reputation== POLIS grants a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics and international studies.
