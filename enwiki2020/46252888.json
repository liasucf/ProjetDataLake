    "text": "Brigette Lacquette (born November 10, 1992) is a Canadian ice hockey player, who most recently played professionally for Calgary Inferno and is currently a member of the Canadian national team, playing defence. She participated at the 2015 IIHF Women's World Championship. In the autumn of 2015, Lacquette joined the Calgary Inferno of the CWHL. In 2018, Lacquette became the first First Nations woman to play for the Canadian women's Olympic hockey team. To honour her accomplishment, Lacquette's Olympic hockey stick was included in the diversity exhibit in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018. ==Early life== Lacquette grew up in the remote M\u00e9tis community of Mallard, Manitoba. Her father is from the O-Chi-Chak Ko Sipi First Nation of Manitoba, while her mother is from the Cote First Nation in Saskatchewan. Lacquette has a sister named Tara and a brother named Taren, both of whom play hockey. Lacquette began skating at the age of four, and was soon introduced to hockey by her father and cousins. Since there were no hockey rinks in Mallard, Lacquette's father built one in their family yard. By the time she was five, Lacquette knew she wanted to play in organized hockey, and her father began taking her to the nearest indoor rink, located in the community of Winnipegosis. As she grew up, Lacquette began facing racism at hockey games. At the age of twelve, she played a tournament in Winnipeg where she encountered taunts such as \"dirty Indian\" and \"go back to the reserve\". Hateful comments have come from opponents, tournament fans, parents of hockey players, and even a few of her own teammates. Despite being tempted to quit at times, Lacquette was supported by her father and decided to continue playing hockey. Lacquette's father has expressed pride at his daughter's perseverance: \"She basically kicked that door over and knocked it down and it's not a barrier anymore in her life, and that's something that's important for not only her but anybody who's faced a barrier in their life.\" ==Playing career== ===University and NCAA teams=== Lacquette has played for the University of Manitoba Bisons and at the NCAA level at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. Shannon Miller, a former head hockey coach at the University of Minnesota Duluth, has described Lacquette as \"the most naturally talented player to ever come through our program\". ===CWHL=== Appearing with the Calgary Inferno in the 2016 Clarkson Cup finals, Lacquette earned an assist as the Inferno emerged victorious in a convincing 8\u20133 final. In 2019, Lacquette led all CWHL players in an online vote, gaining the opportunity to serve as a captain at the 4th Canadian Women's Hockey League All-Star Game. ===Olympics=== In 2014, Lacquette was in the running for the Canadian Olympic hockey team, but was a late cut. In 2018, Lacquette became the first First Nations woman to join the Canadian women's Olympic hockey team, set to play defence at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Lacquette's first appearance with the Canadian Women's National Team was in 2013 at the Four Nations Cup tournament held in Lake Placid, United States. In 2015, Lacquette played her first IIHF Women's World Championship with team Canada in Sweden, where Canada finished second to the United States. ==Accomplishments== Brigette Lacquette was named Top Defenceman for her performance at the 2010 IIHF World Women's Under-18 Championships. Where she also helped lead Canada to its first gold medal at the Under-18 Championships after assisting the overtime winner. ==Volunteer work== Lacquette is a partner athlete with the sports mentorship organization Classroom Champions. As a participant of the organization's \"Circle\" program, which connects athletes and youth of Indigenous heritage, Lacquette has provided mentorship to children from the Piitoayis (Eagle Lodge) Family School in Inglewood, Calgary. ==Inspiration== Lacquettes role model growing up was, fellow aboriginal athlete, Jordin Tootoo. Lacquette embraces her title as a role model to young First Nations kids across Canada. \"I'm super excited to be that role model for those kids. Growing up I really didn't have that female role model to look up to,\" said Lacquette. \"It's just very special for me to be that role model for young First Nation girls across Canada, Indigenous kids across Canada. I'm just super excited to be that person for them.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Calgary Inferno players Category:Canadian expatriate ice hockey players in the United States Category:Canadian women's ice hockey defencemen Category:Clarkson Cup champions Category:First Nations sportspeople Category:Ice hockey people from Manitoba Category:Ice hockey players at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey players Category:Olympic ice hockey players of Canada Category:Olympic medalists in ice hockey Category:Olympic silver medalists for Canada Category:Sportspeople from Dauphin, Manitoba ",
