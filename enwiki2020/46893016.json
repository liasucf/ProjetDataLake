    "text": "The light novel, manga, and anime series Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, also known as DanMachi, has a cast of characters created by author Fujino \u014cmori and illustrator Suzuhito Yasuda. The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario whose people join groups called , who serve a range of functions from dungeon crawling to crafting items. Each Familia is named after and serves a resident deity. In addition, there are monsters who live in the dungeons that sometimes serve as antagonists in the series. ==Main characters== ===Bell Cranel=== : : is a novice solo adventurer and member of the Hestia Familia. The light novel chapter sections often alternate between his narrative and a third-person perspective. He has white hair and red eyes and his weapon is a pair of daggers. Bell is the sole owner of the rare skill called which accelerates his growth and development based on the strength and stability of his feelings, but also drawing the interest of those who are curious about the secret behind it, as he quickly grew from level 1 to level 2, and later to level 3, then level 4 in the span of only a few months. He later obtains another skill, Argonaut, which allows him to greatly empower his attacks on critical situations, born from his desire to become a hero. He aspires to become as strong as Ais so he can confess his feelings to her, leading him to instinctively run away whenever he encounters her, until they become friends. His dream is to have a chance encounter with a girl and become a hero just like in the stories he listened from his grandfather, who is later revealed to be the god Zeus himself.. : After the events with Wiene, he becomes shunned and considered a traitor in the eyes of Orario for protecting the Xenos from extinction. As he works to help them he faces his deadliest opponent, the girl he admires most. He is the primary wielder of the Hestia Knife (value 200,000,000 valis LN7). This weapon is a living weapon made by Hephaestus as a favor to Hestia to help Bell grow and will grow more powerful as he does. In the hands of anyone not of the Familia the knife is useless, but Mikoto was able to locate it using her skill since she is part of the familia and able to use it escaping the Ishtar compound. : His nickname is \"Little Rookie\", though some also call him the vorpal rabbit (in reference to an exceptionally lethal creature in the lower 30's of the Dungeon that while small and fast, can take out even the toughest adventurers). ===Hestia=== : :Hestia is Bell's resident deity, in charge of taking care of Bell's development as an adventurer. She is jealous of Bell's involvement with other girls' affairs, including Ais', but is still in love with him, devoted to protecting him, and helping with his growth, even after learning that he only views her as family. She and Bell live in a room under an abandoned church, and she works part-time for the Guild as a clerk, and also some food stands to help Bell with day-to-day living expenses, until moving to the former palace of the Apollon Familia upon defeating them in the War Game and claiming their assets.
