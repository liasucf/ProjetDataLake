    "text": "The seventeenth season of the American competitive reality television series Hell's Kitchen (officially known as Hell's Kitchen All Stars) began airing on September 29, 2017 and ended on February 2, 2018 on Fox. This is the first season in Hell's Kitchen history to have an all star edition as sixteen former contestants from previous seasons return to compete once again (also their first time since Season 8 returned to 16 contestants, instead of 18), and the winner of this season will receive the position as head chef at the first-ever Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen Restaurant at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. All of the returning chefs made it onto the Black Jackets in their respective seasons. Gordon Ramsay returns as host and head chef, Season 10 winner (and Season 15 sous-chef) Christina Wilson returns as the Red Team's sous-chef replacing Andi Van Willigan-Cutspec, and British MasterChef judge James \"Jocky\" Petrie makes his Hell's Kitchen debut as the Blue Team's sous- chef replacing Aaron Mitrano. Marino Monferrato returns as the ma\u00eetre d'. The red team won only three of the nine dinner services during the team phase (two outright, one joint). As a result, they are the first team in the show's history to only have one member earn a black jacket. This team's Michelle Tribble, who previously finished in third place in Season 14, won the competition. ==Opening sequence== Ramsay uses telekinesis to destroy Hell's Kitchen while leaving the building as the intro ends with the title card featuring him and the all stars. This is the first season that doesn't list contestants individually in the intro. ==Chefs== 16 returning chefs competed in Season 17. {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=text- align:center ! scope=\"col\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | AgeAge at the time of filming ! scope=\"col\" | Hometown ! scope=\"col\" | Competed ! scope=\"col\" | Finished ! scope=\"col\" | Result as \"All Stars\" on Season 17 |- | scope=\"row\" | Michelle Tribble |26 | Dallas, Texas | data-sort-value=\"14\"| Season 14 |rowspan=2|3rd | Winner |- | scope=\"row\" | Benjamin Knack | 41 | San Antonio, Texas | data-sort-value=\"7\"| Season 7 | Runner-Up |- | scope=\"row\" | Nicholas \"Nick\" Peters Bond | 28 |Newburyport, Massachusetts | data-sort-value=\"14\"| Season 14 | 5th | Eliminated during Finals |- | scope=\"row\" | Emili \"Milly\" Medley |37 | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | data-sort-value=\"14\"| Season 14 | 4th | Eliminated before Finals |- | scope=\"row\" | Robyn Almodovar | 36 | Fort Lauderdale, Florida | data-sort-value=\"10\"| Season 10 | 6th | Eliminated after 10th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Jennifer Normant |40 | Burlington, Massachusetts | data-sort-value=\"9\"| Season 9 | 5th | rowspan=2| Eliminated before Black Jackets |- | scope=\"row\" | Elise Wims-Harris | 32 | Stafford, Virginia | data-sort-value=\"9\"| Season 9 |rowspan=2|3rd |- | scope=\"row\" | Dana Cohen | 32 | Emerson, New Jersey | data-sort-value=\"10\"| Season 10 | Eliminated after 9th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Barbra \"Barbie\" Marshall | 39 | Strasburg, Pennsylvania | data-sort-value=\"10\"| Season 10 | 4th | Eliminated after 8th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Vincent \"Van\" Hurd | 34 | South Glastonbury, Connecticut | data-sort-value=\"6\"| Season 6 | 6th | Eliminated after 7th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Amanda \"Manda\" Palomino |32 | Atlantic City, New Jersey | data-sort-value=\"15\"| Season 15 | 5th | Eliminated after 6th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Giovanni Filippone | 46 | Santa Rosa Beach, Florida | data-sort-value=\"5\"| Season 5 | 6th | Eliminated after Cook For Your Life |- | scope=\"row\" | Jared Bobkin | 31 | Troy, Michigan | data-sort- value=\"15\"| Season 15 | 4th | Eliminated after 5th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Joshua \"Josh\" Trovato |28 | Los Angeles, California | data-sort-value=\"14\"| Season 14 | 6th | Eliminated during 4th Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Ashley Nickell |29 | Orlando, Florida | data-sort-value=\"15\"| Season 15 | 3rd | Eliminated after 2nd Service |- | scope=\"row\" | Benjamin \"Ben\" Walanka |36 | Overland Park, Kansas | data-sort-value=\"5\"| Season 5 | 4th | Eliminated after 1st Service |} ===Notes=== ==Contestant progress== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=\"5\" | ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Original teams ! colspan=\"7\" scope=\"col\" | Switched teams ! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | Individuals ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Finals |- ! scope=\"col\" | No. ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Chef ! scope=\"col\" | 1701/1702 ! scope=\"col\" | 1703 ! scope=\"col\" | 1704 ! scope=\"col\" | 1705 ! scope=\"col\" | 1706 ! scope=\"col\" | 1707 ! scope=\"col\" | 1708 ! scope=\"col\" | 1709 ! scope=\"col\" | 1710 ! scope=\"col\" | 1711 ! scope=\"col\" | 1712 ! scope=\"col\" | 1713 ! scope=\"col\" | 1714 ! scope=\"col\" | 1715 ! scope=\"col\" | 1716 |- | scope=\"row\" | 1 | style=\"background:red;
