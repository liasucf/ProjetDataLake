    "text": "\"You To Me Are Everything\" is a single by the British soul group The Real Thing. Written by Ken Gold and Michael Denne and produced by Ken Gold, \"You To Me Are Everything\" was The Real Thing's sole number-one single in the UK Singles chart, spending three weeks at the top in July 1976. The Decade Remix version of the song by DJ Froggy, Simon Harris and KC returned the song to the chart in March 1986 reaching number five and reaching silver status in the UK (250,000 single sales). \"You To Me Are Everything\" peaked at #22 in Australia #4 in Ireland and #10 in New Zealand. The song was a minor hit in the US, peaking at number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and number 28 on the Billboard R&B; chart. One of the reasons for its lack of success in the US was the flood of cover versions of the song released at the same time. American groups Broadway and Revelation both released versions the same week, and at one point all three appeared on Billboard Hot 100 and R&B; charts. With radio and the public unable to agree on a single popular version, the three singles effectively prevented each other from becoming a hit. The song was subsequently covered by Frankie Valli, Sonia, Tiny Tim, Public Enemy, Sean Maguire and Andy Abraham. A Finnish version entitled \"Ei enemp\u00e4\u00e4 voi pyyt\u00e4\u00e4\" (\"He can ask no more\") was recorded in 1978 by . Later on, in 1997, songwriter Marina Rei successfully recorded an Italian-language version, \"Primavera\" (\"Spring\"). ==Sonia version== \"You To Me Are Everything\" was covered by Sonia in 1991. The song was released in November 1991, the third and final single from her second album. The song's B-side \"Be My Baby\" was also on the album. This single reached #13 in UK and #14 in Ireland. ===Format and track listings=== CD single # \"You to Me Are Everything\" - 3:56 # \"You to Me Are Everything\" (Extended Mix) - 6:07 # \"Be My Baby\" - 3:54 7\" single # \"You to Me Are Everything\" - 3:56 # \"Be My Baby\" - 3:54 12\" single # \"You to Me Are Everything\" (Extended Mix) - 6:07 # \"Be My Baby\" - 3:54 # \"You to Me Are Everything\" - 3:56 ==Sean Maguire version== \"You To Me Are Everything\" was Sean Maguire's fifth single and his second from his second album, Spirit.
