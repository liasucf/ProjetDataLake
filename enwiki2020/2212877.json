    "text": "Koval'skiy is a crater on the far side of the Moon. It lies about one crater diameter to the southeast of the prominent Sklodowska, and to the north- northwest of Bowditch and Lacus Solitudinis, a small lunar mare. This feature has been heavily damaged by overlapping impacts, leaving it scarcely distinguishable from the irregular lunar terrain. The satellite crater Koval'skiy P lies across the southwestern rim, and Koval'skiy B intrudes into the northeastern rim. A small crater also lies across the northwestern rim. The interior is irregular and marked by several small craterlets. Koval'skiy K lies at the midpoint of a high-albedo patch. A single faint ray extends to the southeast directly across Koval'sky. ==Satellite craters== Koval'skiy P crater, from Apollo 15 By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Koval'skiy. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Koval'skiy !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|20.8\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|101.5\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|28 km |- |align=\"center\"|D |align=\"center\"|20.9\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|103.0\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|19 km |- |align=\"center\"|H |align=\"center\"|22.5\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|102.6\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|37 km |- |align=\"center\"|M |align=\"center\"|23.8\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|100.8\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|18 km |- |align=\"center\"|P |align=\"center\"|22.4\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|100.3\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|25 km |- |align=\"center\"|Q |align=\"center\"|23.5\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|98.7\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|35 km |- |align=\"center\"|U |align=\"center\"|21.1\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|98.1\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|25 km |- |align=\"center\"|Y |align=\"center\"|20.8\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|100.5\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|19 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
