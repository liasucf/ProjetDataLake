    "text": "Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith formed a wartime coalition government in May 1915. == History == The new Cabinet included nine Conservatives and one Labour minister, but the Liberals continued to hold most of the important posts; the Conservatives had demanded Cabinet seats, but they only received lesser positions. Not at all satisfied, Conservative Party leader Bonar Law continued the verbal attacks. The ministry collapsed on 5 December 1916 as a result of Conservative resignations, who refused to serve under Asquith's leadership. Asquith and most of the Liberals then moved into opposition, while the Conservatives formed a new coalition with a minority of Liberals, under the leadership of Liberal David Lloyd George, the next day. == Cabinet == == List of ministers == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! class=unsortable|Office ! class=unsortable|Name !
