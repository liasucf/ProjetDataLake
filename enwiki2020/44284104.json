Havelock SC retained the league title the following year again maintaining an unbeaten record during the season. In 1952 Ceylonese R&FC;, captained by Mahes Rodrigo (who went on to become a dual international in rugby and cricket) won the league title. The following year Dimbula A&CC;, captained by Lyn Simpson, became the first club from Up-Country to win the league by defeating the previous years title holders, Ceylonese R&FC;, 6-0. The Kandy Sporting Club made their first appearance in a Clifford Cup final in 1954, where they lost 21-5 against Ceylonese R&FC.; Ceylonese R&FC; went on to win the title in the next two successive years (1955\u201356) The title was shared for the first time in 1959 when Dimbula and Ceylonese R & FC competed in an 11-all draw.

The format of the competition was also changed, whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the league season the best eight teams competed in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup. In 1971, led by captain and coach Y. C. Chang, Colombo H&FC; secured the league title. The 1972 final was played between Police SC, captained by Anton Benedict, and Colombo H&FC;, led by Y. C.

The SRFU decided to award the Clifford Cup to the winners of a separate knock-out tournament, conducted amongst the 'A' Division Clubs, held at the end of the regular season. The inaugural winner of the John Player Rugby Championship was Police SC captained by Sunil Sahabandu, who also clinched the rugby triple by also winning the Rugby Sevens title and the Clifford Cup. Police SC subsequently retained the John Player League title for the following four years, under the leadership of Sunil Sahabandu (1985), H. Premasiri (1986), Muruga Jayaratne (1987), Ajantha Samarakoon (1988) and M. H. Marso (1989).
