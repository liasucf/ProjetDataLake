    "text": "Fatherhood is an American animated sitcom about the Bindlebeep family, inspired by the book of the same name by Bill Cosby, which aired from 2004 to 2005. This was Nick at Nite's first original animated series. It has aired on Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon. Scientist Dr. Arthur Bindlebeep is the head of the family and a high school teacher. He and his wife, Norma, try to be model parents while learning a few things from their three children: Angie, Roy and Katherine and their dog Guinness. At the same time, Arthur's own parents, Lester and Louise, still have some lessons for him. ==Production== Blair Underwood, who played Dr. Bindlebeep, said that he had meetings with Cosby to help find the voice of the character: \"When you're a father, you have to constantly be straddling that line between being a disciplinarian and loving your kid. Sometimes we err on the side of being too friendly with our kids, and sometimes we can be too stern. And what [Cosby] was saying as a through line was, 'Make sure that whatever you're doing, whatever you're saying is coming from a place of love and that will inform the tone of the voice.'\" ==Voice cast== * Blair Underwood \u2013 Dr. Arthur Bindlebeep * Sabrina Le Beauf \u2013 Norma Bindlebeep * Giovonnie Samuels \u2013 Angie Bindlebeep * Marc John Jefferies \u2013 Roy Bindlebeep * Jamai Fisher \u2013 Katherine Bindlebeep ==Episodes== ===Series overview=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Episodes !colspan=\"2\"|Originally aired |- !First aired !Last aired |- |style=\"background: #7b322b;\"| |1 |13 | | |- |style=\"background: #d29e3b;\"| |2 |13 | | |} ===Season 1 (2004\u201305)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\" |-style=\"color:white;\" ! style=\"background:#7b322b\" | No. ! style=\"background:#7b322b\" | Title ! style=\"background:#7b322b\" | Original air date ! style=\"background:#7b322b\" | Production code |} ===Season 2 (2005)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\" ! style=\"background:#d29e3b\" | No. ! style=\"background:#d29e3b\" | Title ! style=\"background:#d29e3b\" | Original air date ! style=\"background:#d29e3b\" | Production code |} ==Home media== Season 1 has been released on DVD, and all episodes were available via Amazon Video until November 2014, when they were removed in response to the allegations involved in the Bill Cosby sexual assault cases. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American black cartoons Category:2000s American black sitcoms Category:2004 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Nick at Nite original programming Category:Television shows based on books Category:Television series created by Bill Cosby Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about families ",
