    "text": "The Guarani Aquifer The Guarani Aquifer, located beneath the surface of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is the second largest known aquifer system in the world and is an important source of fresh water.News from the BBC Named after the Guarani people, it covers , with a volume of about , a thickness of between and and a maximum depth of about . It is estimated to contain about of water, with a total recharge rate of about 166 km\u00b3/year from precipitation. It is said that this vast underground reservoir could supply fresh drinking water to the world for 200 years. However, at closer inspection, if the world population were to stay at an equilibrium of about 6.96 billion, not even taking into account that babies need less water than grown adults, this figure reaches 1600 years, allowing about 9 liters per day per person. Due to an expected shortage of fresh water on a global scale, which environmentalists suggest will become critical in under 20 years, this important natural resource is rapidly becoming politicised, and its control becomes ever more controversial. == Geology of the aquifer == The Guarani Aquifer consists primarily of fluvial sandstones of the Piramboia Formation and aeolian sandstones of the Botucatu Formation, which were deposited during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. Over 90% of the total area is overlain by early Cretaceous basalts of the Serra Geral Formation. The basalt's low permeability allows it to act as an aquitard, providing a high degree of containment. This greatly reduces the rate of infiltration and subsequent recharge, but also isolates the aquifer from the vadose zone, subsequent surface-associated losses due to evaporation and evapotranspiration, and potential contamination. The erosion exposes pieces of sandstone on aquifer\u2019s banks, which are called outcrops. This is where the rain comes in and also where the contamination might happen.Carlos Eduardo Andrade Gomes Barreto. \"BALAN\u00c7O H\u00cdDRICO EM ZONA DE AFLORAMENTO DO SISTEMA AQU\u00cdFERO GUARANI A PARTIR DE MONITORAMENTO HIDROGEOL\u00d3GICO EM BACIA REPRESENTATIVA.\" N.p., 2006. Web. In general, the aquifer comprises a variety of quartz sand, well-rounded format, and has low clay content. Granulometric data indicate that over 50% of the grains have a diameter between . Research and monitoring of the aquifer in order to better manage it as a resource is considered important, as the population growth rate within its area is relatively high \u2014 resulting in higher consumption and pollution risks. The countries over the aquifer are also the original four Mercosur countries. == Recharge of the Aquifer == The Recharge distribution is related to precipitation rate. Its complexity is due to the indirect relation between them. The infiltration rate depends on parameters that are variables in time and space. Another important factor that contributes to the aquifer\u2019s recharge is the importance of evapotranspiration. The soil, plants and atmosphere could be considered as components of a system physically related and dynamic. In some regions, the quantity of water that evaporates is larger than the runoff flow. A study by Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto - Brazil, from 1994 to 2001 indicates that agricultural activity using chemical products offers risk of contamination for the groundwater.Revista Do Departamento De Geografia, 18 (2006) 67-74., Marco Ant\u00f4nio Ferreira Gomes1, Heloisa Ferreira Filizola2, and Cl\u00e1udio A.

Vegetal Interception is another factor that directly influences the quantity of water that infiltrates into the soil, according to Soares and Almeida (2001) who realized a study in the Eucalyptus area between October 1995 and September 1996. The interception during this period was evaluated in 11% of the precipitation value. ==See also== *Aquifer *Fossil water *Groundwater *Ogallala Aquifer == References == == External links == * Official Site for the book about the Aquifer, by Nadia Rita Boscardin Borghetti, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Borghetti and Ernani Francisco da Rosa Filho (in Brazilian Portuguese) * Conference \u00abThe Management of the Guarani Aquifer System: An Example of Cooperation\u00bb Category:Aquifers of South America Category:Geography of South America Aquifers Category:Aquifers in Brazil Category:Springs of Argentina Category:Springs of Brazil Category:Springs of Paraguay Category:Springs of Uruguay ",
