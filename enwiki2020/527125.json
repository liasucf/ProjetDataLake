    "text": "Game Informer (GI, stylized in all lowercase with no space) is an American monthly video game magazine featuring articles, news, strategy, and reviews of video games and associated consoles. It debuted in August 1991 when video game retailer FuncoLand started publishing an in-house newsletter.\"10 Years of Game Informer\" (August 2001). Game Informer, p. 42. \"In August 1991, FuncoLand began publishing a six-page circular to be handed out free in all of its retail locations.\" The publication is now owned and published by GameStop, who bought FuncoLand in 2000. Due to this, a large amount of promotion is done in- store, which has contributed to the success of the magazine; it is now the 4th most popular magazine by copies circulated. Game Informer has since become an important part of GameStop's customer loyalty program, PowerUp Rewards, which offers subscribers access to special content on the official website. ==History== ===Magazine=== Game Informer covers circa 2005 Game Informer debuted in August 1991 as a six-page magazine. It was published every two months until November 1994, when the magazine began to be released monthly. Since 2001 Game Informer has been published by Cathy Preston, who has been working as part of the production team since 2000. It was under her that the publication became an integral part of GameStop's customer loyalty program, Power Up Rewards. In 2010, Game Informer became the 5th largest magazine in the US with 5 million copies sold, ahead of popular publications like Time, Sports Illustrated, and Playboy. By 2011, Game Informer had become the 3rd largest magazine in the US topping 8 million copies circulated. However, in 2014 it had fallen to 4th place with 6.9 million copies sold. Recent figures still place the magazine at 4th place with over 7 million copies sold. The financial success of Game Informer has been attributed to its good relationship with publishers, ties to GameStop, and the lack of gaming magazine competition. The April edition of Game Informer includes 'an annual feature Game Infarcer, an April Fools' Day prank. In the cover box head appears \"World's #1 Pretend Magazine\" where would ordinarily appear \"World's #1 Video Game Magazine\" -- \"Parody\" is found at the cover bottom. Game Infarcer articles are accredited to the fictional editor-in-chief Darth Clark, who is addressed in hate mail every year sent to Game Informer. The heated responses to parody articles are often featured in later Game Informer issues. Game Informer has included four \"Sacred Cow Barbecues\". Similar in style to a celebrity roast, the occasion is meant to \"knock some of gaming's most revered icons off their high and mighty pedestals.\"Game Informer Issue 183 inFamous The first Sacred Cow Barbecues featured in issue 158 (June 2006).Game Informer, issue 158 (June 2006) Other issues featuring Sacred Cow Barbecues are: 183 (July 2008), 211 (November 2010),Game Informer, issue 213 (January 2011) p. 8; and 261 (January 2015). Sacred Cow Barbecues articles are considered controversial among those gamers who aren't amused with their games being mocked. In August 2019, after months of declining financials for Gamestop, about half of the current Game Informer staff were let go, part of the larger cut of more than 120 jobs by GameStop as part of the store's effort to improve their financial performance. These included some staff memebers that have been working at Game Informer for over 10 years. Game Informer then hired unpaid interns to work on the magazine. In late June 2020, longtime editor-in-chief Andy McNamara announced he was leaving Game Informer, for a new job elsewhere in the gaming industry and that former senior editor Andrew Reiner would be taking his place as editor-in-chief. https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/06/30/editor-in-chief-andy- mcnamara-leaves-game-informer-after-29-years/ ===Website=== Game Informer Online was originally launched in August 1996 and featured daily news updates as well as articles. Justin Leeper and Matthew Kato were hired on in November 1999 as full-time web editors. As part of the GameStop purchase of the magazine, the site was closed around January 2001.\"On the Web\" (August 2001). Game Informer, p. 49. \"Sadly, this ill-fated site was to last little more a year, as gameinformer.com would fall prey to the massive meltdown of the Internet economy in February [of 2001].\" Both Leeper and Kato were eventually placed on the editorial staff of the magazine. GI Online was revived in September 2003, with a full redesign and many additional features, such as a review database, frequent news updates, and exclusive \"Unlimited\" content for subscribers. It was managed by Billy Berghammer, creator of PlanetGameCube.com (now known as NintendoWorldReport.com). Berghammer is currently the editor in chief of the EGM Media group In March 2009, the online staff began creating the code for what would be the latest redesign to date. The redesign was to release hand-in-hand with the magazine's own redesign. On October 1, 2009, the newly redesigned website was live, with a welcome message from Editor-In-Chief Andy McNamara. Many new features were introduced, including a rebuilt media player, a feed highlighting the site activity of the website's users, and the ability to create user reviews. At the same time, the magazine's podcast, The Game Informer Show, was launched.Andy Mcnamara, September 29, 2009,The Inaugural Game Informer Show: Episode 1 Game Informer In February (sometimes January), Game Informer's editors round up to count and judge the \"Top 50 Games of last year\". The games are sorted in order of release date. They do not have rankings, but they do commemorate special games with awards like Game of the Year and other examples. They also have mini top 10 charts of differing categories, both in the Top 50 games section of the website and in the regular magazine. In August each year, Game Informer includes an \"E3 Hot 50\", a special section that reviews the year's E3 and most to all of its games, which also temporarily replaces the \"previews\" section. ===Australian edition=== In November 2009, Game Informer was launched in Australia by former Australian GamePro, Gameplayer and Official PlayStation Magazine editor Chris Stead and publisher Citrus Media. By June 2010, Game Informer Australia had become the first local games publication to pass 10,000 subscribers. By August 18, 2010, it had become Australia's biggest selling video games publication. Game Informer Australia was closed down on April 18, 2019, as a result of cost- cutting measures from its parent company EB Games Australia. Game Informer Australia Editor David Milner has noted on Twitter that despite the fact that \"readership was up 19% over the last year. Recent ad sales, however, did not really reflect this\" and as well as noting the failed attempt at EB Games Australia's parent company GameStop to find a buyer after months on the market, causing their shares to drop. ==Reviews== Game Informer currently reviews games on PCs; consoles including PlayStation 4, PlayStation VR, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch; and mobile devices including Android, and iOS devices.Game Informer, issue 323 pp. 80 Older games, three per issue, were given brief reviews in the magazine's Classic GI section (compared with the game's original review score, if one exists). This was discontinued in 2009, months before the redesign of the magazine. The magazine's staff rate games on a scale of 1 to 10 with quarter point intervals. A score of 1 to 5 is considered terrible (in many issues, 1 is noted as a joke reason for the score, for instance, \"Duplicates in lootboxes\" in issue 295Game Informer, issue 295 pp. 70); 6 to 7 is \"average\", a decently, playable, and sometimes fun (but flawed) game; and 10 is a rare, \"outstanding\", nearly perfect game.Game Informer, issue 251 (March 2014) p.84 ==Staff== ===Current=== *Andrew Reiner \u2013 Editor in Chief: 1994 *Joe Juba \u2013 Senior Reviews Editor *Matt Miller \u2013 Senior Previews Editor *Kimberly Wallace \u2013 Features Editor *Daniel Tack \u2013 PC Editor *Brian Shea \u2013 Digital Editor *Benjamin Reeves \u2013 Senior Editor *Jeff Cork \u2013 Senior Editor *Alex Stadnik - Video Editor *Jason Guisao - Associate Editor *Liana Ruppert - Associate Editor ===Former=== There have been numerous former staff members but some of the noteworthy ones are: *Andy McNamara - Editor-in-Chief (1991-2020)https://www.gameinformer.com/its-hard- to-say-goodbye *Matthew Kato \u2013 Senior Editor (Left in 2020) *Leo Vader \u2013 Video Editor (Left in 2020) https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/video- podcast/the-game-informer-show/2020/07/02/gi-show-the-end-of-an-era *Dan Ryckert - Associate Editor (Left in 2014) https://www.gameinformer.com/blogs/editors/b/gidan_blog/archive/2014/05/30/saying- goodbye-to-game-informer.aspx ==References== ==External links== * *Archived game Informer Magazines at the Wayback Machine *Archived Game Informer Magazines on Retro CDN Category:1991 establishments in Minnesota Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Video game magazines published in the United States Category:GameStop Category:Magazines established in 1991 Category:Magazines published in Minnesota Category:Mass media in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul ",
