Within the building are located four schools: * The first floor is the High School for Media and Communications (M463). * The second floor houses The College Academy, formerly the High School for International Business and Finance (M462). * The third floor houses the High School for Health Careers and Sciences (M468). * The fourth floor houses the High School for Law and Public Service (M467). The building is located on the site of the former Fort George Amusement Park. The school opened on February 2, 1917, as an annex of Morris High School. George Washington High School was founded in 1919, and moved into the building in 1925. It was known by that name until 1999, when the building was divided into the four small schools. George Washington Education Campus has a Works Progress Administration (WPA) mural, The Evolution of Music, painted by Lucienne Bloch in 1938. This mural was painted in a room originally used as a music room and later as a dance studio. The campus also houses one of only two NJROTC units in New York City, in its basement, led by Commander Edward Gunning (Ret.) and Chief Petty Officer John Sikora (Ret.). ID cards were first used in the school in February 1972 for students and staff. Currently, the building has scanning machines. In order to enter the building, one must go through scanning. New York-Presbyterian Hospital maintains a clinic on the first floor. ==Sports== In 1989, the Trojan American football team won the 1989 City \"B\" Division Championship. They defeated Lincoln High School in the championship game. On November 23, 2008, the squad defeated Far Rockaway High School (Queens), 20\u201314, in an overtime finish at the Midwood Athletic Complex in Brooklyn. The victory earned GW the 2008 PSAL Cup Championship, their first football title since 1988. Far Rock beat GW 38\u20138 in the season opener. It was their only loss of the season. The Trojans won their next nine games, holding their last four opponents to a total of 21 points. That included defeating previously unbeaten South Bronx HS, 24\u20138, to earn the trip to the championship game. On June 6, 2008, the George Washington Trojans baseball team beat the James Madison Knights, with an 11th-inning finish of 4-0, to win the Division \"A\" City Championship at Shea Stadium. On June 9, 2006, the George Washington Trojans baseball team went to the championship to play against James Monroe High School of the Bronx, but lost the championship to Monroe (#1 James Monroe 4, #3 George Washington 0). In 2004, the team went to the championship to play against Monroe High School of the Bronx but lost the championship.

He was suspended by the PSAL for 16 months for \"recruiting violations\" and was reinstated to his job thereafter; the case prompted questions about how the PSAL handles charges brought without witnesses or evidence. According to The New York Times, \"The Mandl case offers another perspective: the possibility that petty, meritless charges can get traction and turn the disciplinary process itself into a form of punishment long before a verdict has been reached.\" \"Baseball coach Steve Mandl suspended before a hearing is held\", New York Times, February 1, 2012 As seen from the Bronx ==Alumni== Alumni include: * Moshe Arens (born 1927), aeronautical engineer; Israeli MK and defense minister * Harry Belafonte (born 1927), actor and singerArenson, Karen W. \"Commencements; Belafonte Lauds Diversity Of Baruch College Class\", The New York Times, June 2, 2000.
