    "text": "Tinea accusatrix is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1916. However the placement of this species within the genus Tinea is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as Tinea (s.l.) accusatrix. This species is endemic to New Zealand. The wingspan is 8\u201310 mm. The forewings are dark fuscous with a short fine white median longitudinal line from the base and oblique white streaks from the costa at one-fourth and the middle reaching more than half across the wing, and shorter oblique marks from the dorsum opposite. There are seven white wedge-shaped marks from the costa on the posterior half, anteriorly somewhat oblique, posteriorly direct, one from the tornus and a dot on the termen beneath the apex, the space between these with violet and bronzy reflections. There is also a round deep black spot at the apex. The hindwings are light grey, with bronzy and purple reflections. ==References== ==External links== *Image of type specimen of Tinea s.l. accusatrix.
