    "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Papua New Guinea face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Male same-sex sexual activity is illegal, punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment, but the law is not enforced. Attitudes towards LGBT people are greatly influenced by Christian churches, as a majority of Papua New Guineans are Christian. Historically, gay men had certain societal roles. They would take on traditional female roles such as cooking and would participate with women in traditional festivals. However, some tribes still practice ritual pedophilic homosexuality such as the Etoro people and Sambia people. Nowadays, LGBT people tend to be more tolerated and accepted in coastal areas than in the New Guinea Highlands. ==Terminology== The words \"lesbian\", \"gay\", \"bisexual\" and \"transgender\" tend to carry heavy stigma in Papua New Guinea. In recent years, the Tok Pisin word has been used by transgender Papua New Guineas to refer to a cultural and traditional third gender. Similarly, the Sambia people recognize a traditional third gender: kwolu-aatmwol (literally male thing transforming into female thing). ==Legality of same-sex sexual activity== Male same-sex sexual activity is prohibited by Section 210 of the Papua New Guinea Penal Code. Those caught engaging in anal sex or oral sex (whether heterosexual or homosexual) can be punished with up to fourteen years' imprisonment. Other same-sex sexual acts can be punished with up to three years' imprisonment.State-sponsored Homophobia A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults In 2011, the Government informed the United Nations that it will not decriminalise homosexuality.Human Rights Watch says Papua New Guinea has failed to protect women and children, The Guardian, 12 January 2017 According to the United States Department of State, there were no reports of prosecutions in 2012 directed at LGBT persons.\"2012 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Papua New Guinea\", United States Department of State However, the department reported that LGBT persons in 2012 were \"vulnerable to societal stigmatization\". Former MP Dame Carol Kidu in 2012 described gay Papua New Guineans as being forced to live lives of secrecy, and called unsuccessfully on the Government to decriminalise homosexuality. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill explained that there were \"strong feelings\" against homosexuality in the country, which was \"yet to accept such sexual openness\".\"Gay PNG citizens face discrimination\" , Special Broadcasting Service (video), 11 September 2012 ==Living conditions== LGBT persons have reported facing \"discrimination in their daily lives, and often struggle to find jobs\".\"No end in sight to PNG\u2019s anti-gay laws\" , Special Broadcasting Service, 11 September 2012 There are a few nightclubs in Port Moresby that have \"gay nights\" and small drag parties, mainly in Hanuabada, which has been described as a \"gay village\" and a sanctuary for local LGBT people. ==Summary table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Same-sex sexual activity legal | No (For males, not enforced)/Yes (For females) |- | Equal age of consent | No (For males)/Yes (For females) |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment only | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) | No |- | Same- sex marriages | No |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | No |- | Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | LGBT people allowed to serve openly in the military | No |- | Right to change legal gender | No |- | Access to IVF for lesbians | No |- | Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples | No |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No |} ==See also== *Human rights in Papua New Guinea *LGBT rights in Oceania Tribes: *Etoro people, a PNG tribe with traditional homosexual rituals *Sambia people, a PNG tribe with traditional homosexual rituals *Kaluli people, a PNG tribe with traditional homosexual rituals ==References== Category:Human rights in Papua New Guinea Category:Political movements in Papua New Guinea Category:LGBT in Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea Category:Papua New Guinean law Papua New Guinea ",
