His predecessor Donald Tsang submitted the bill to reform existing bureaus to establish Innovation and Technology Bureau. However, pan-democratic councilor found it offensive as the Chief Executive-elected intervene current administration and legislation. Therefore, they opposed against the bill. It has become political dispute in establishment of the Bureau. And the Bill was not passed. After CY Leung\u2019s inauguration, the bill of establishing the Bureau had been submitted twice to the Legislative Council. The Bill was originally passed in the Council. However, the pan-democratic councilors filibustered in the Finance Committee against the budget of establishing the Bureau because they were unhappy with the administration about rearranging the agenda of the meeting to prioritise the budget of the Bureau. The Bill was ineffective as the Finance Council could not pass the Budget on the designated time. The Government submitted the Bill in 2015 again. Pan-democratic councilors filibustered in the Bill and the Budget in the beginning of the debate. However, it passed with the support of the majority of pro-establishment councilors. The Bureau was finally established after three submission of Bill. ===Conflicting Role Against Steering Committee on Innovation and Technology=== In October 2017, Chief Executive Carrie Lam promised to \"personally lead a high-level, inter-departmental Steering Committee on Innovation and Technology to examine and steer measures under the eight areas of innovation and technology development as well as Smart City projects\" (HKSAR, 2017, p. 28)Policy Address 2017 retrieved from https://www.policyaddress.gov.hk/2017/eng/pdf/PA2017.pdf in her first Policy Address. The objective of the Steering Committee is to foster Hong Kong\u2019s innovation and technology development expeditiously and efficiently. According to the Enterprise Innovation (2017), the Steering Committee will bring more inter-departmental collaboration to speed up the development process of innovation and technology in Hong Kong. The Committee also creates a top-down approach to formulate policy instead of bottom-up approach which is believed that lacking support from the senior level executives hindering inter- departmental collaboration. Compared to the hierarchy of Innovation and Technology Bureau, some people were worriedHKET (2017) retrieved from https://topick.hket.com/article/1923585/\u56de\u61c9\u6797\u912d\u89aa\u638c\u5275\u79d1\u7763\u5c0e\u59d4\u54e1\u6703 \u694a\u5049\u96c4\u5426\u8a8d\u88ab\u67b6\u7a7a\u4f46\u8a8d\u5514\u5920\u73ed that the Steering Committee seems to have a higher level of status to override the function of the Bureau. ==References== Category:Hong Kong government policy bureaux ",
