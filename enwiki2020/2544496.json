    "text": "Lipit-Ishtar (Akkadian: Lipit-I\u0161tar; fl. c. 1870 BC \u2013 c. 1860 BC by the short chronology of the ancient near east) was the 5th king of the First Dynasty of Isin, according to the Sumerian King List (SKL). Also according to the SKL: he was the successor of I\u0161me-Dag\u0101n. Ur-Ninurta then succeeded Lipit-I\u0161tar. Some documents and royal inscriptions from his time have survived, however; Lipit- I\u0161tar is mostly known due to the Sumerian language hymns that were written in his honor, as well as a legal code written in his name (preceding the famed Code of Hammurabi by about 100 years)\u2014which were used for school instruction for hundreds of years after Lipit-I\u0161tar's death. The annals of Lipit-I\u0161tar's reign recorded that he also repulsed the Amorites.Ferris J. Stephens, \"A Newly Discovered Inscription of Libit-Ishtar\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, 52 (1932), pp. 182-185 ==Excerpts from the \"Code of Lipit-I\u0161tar\"== The \"Code of Lipit-I\u0161tar\" (dated to c. 1860 BC.) The text exists on several partial fragments. The following complete laws have been reconstructed: :\u00a78 If a man gave bare ground to another man to set out as an orchard and the latter did not complete setting out that bare ground as an orchard, he shall give to the man who set out the orchard the bare ground which he neglected as part of his share. :\u00a79 If a man entered the orchard of another man and was seized there for stealing, he shall pay ten shekels of silver. :\u00a710 If a man cut down a tree in the garden of another man, he shall pay one-half mina of silver. :\u00a711 If adjacent to the house of a man the bare ground of another man has been neglected and the owner of the house has said to the owner of the bare ground, \"Because your ground has been neglected someone may break into my house: strengthen your house,\" and this agreement has been confirmed by him, the owner of the bare ground shall restore to the owner of the house any of his property that is lost. :\u00a712 If a slave-girl or slave of a man has fled into the heart of the city and it has been confirmed that he (or she) dwelt in the house of (another) man for one month, he shall give slave for slave. :\u00a713 If he has no slave, he shall pay fifteen shekels of silver. :\u00a714 If a man's slave has compensated his slave-ship to his master and it is confirmed (that he has compensated) his master two-fold, that slave shall be freed. :\u00a715 If a miqtum [servant] is the grant of a king, he shall not be taken away. :\u00a716 If a miqtum went to a man of his own free will, that man shall not hold him; he (the miqtum) may go where he desires. :\u00a717 If a man without authorization bound another man to a matter of which he (the latter) had no knowledge, that man is not affirmed (i.e., legally obligated); he (the first man) shall bear the penalty in regard to the matter to which he had bound him. :\u00a718 If the master of an estate or the mistress of an estate has defaulted on the tax of an estate and a stranger has borne it, for three years he (the owner) may not be evicted.
