    "text": "Dr. Julius No is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1958 James Bond novel and its 1962 film adaptation Dr. No, the first of the series, in which he was portrayed by actor Joseph Wiseman. ==Novel biography== The novel explains that Dr. No was born in Peking to a German Methodist missionary and a Chinese girl, but was raised by his aunt. As an adult, he went to Shanghai, where he was involved with the Tongs, a Chinese crime syndicate. Later he was smuggled to the United States and settled in New York City, where he became a clerk and eventually Treasurer for a Tong in America, called the \"Hip-Sings\". In the late 1920s, a mob war broke out in New York, forcing the police to crack down on them. No stole a million dollars in gold from the Tongs and disappeared. But the Tongs tracked him down and tortured him to find the location of the gold. When No refused to tell them, the Tongs cut off his hands, shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead. No survived, due to a condition called dextrocardia, in which his heart is on the right side of the body. No spent a long time in hospital, then enrolled in medical school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He adopted the title of Doctor and changed his name to Julius No, symbolic of his rejection of his father, whose given name was Julius. As in the film, No fits himself with metal manual prostheses, but the book describes them as simple pincers. In physical appearance, Dr. No is tall and very thin. He is described as being at least 6 inches taller than Bond, who is six feet tall, meaning that he's probably around 6 ft 6 inches (198 cm) in height. His head is said to be shaped like a \"reverse oil drop\", due to his round head, pointed chin and the yellowish tinge of his skin. He also mentions that while in school, he did not make use of his metal hands, replacing them with waxen ones which were less useful but gave himself a more human appearance. In the novel he wears a gunmetal coloured kimono; due to his inability to hold a bell, he uses a walkie-talkie which he carries around his neck. He also wears one of the first ever pair of contact lenses, and has had a lip slice cosmetic surgery, as well as wearing stocked shoes in order to make himself taller. All of these factors were employed by No to conceal his identity from the Tongs. With the million dollars from the Tong, he purchases rare stamps in order to preserve his money against inflation; he later purchases the island of Crab Key, off the coast of Jamaica, where he restarts a defunct guano business as a cover for his criminal operations. He employs Jamaican and Cuban laborers for his guano business, which is a mixed blessing for them. The workers are brutally supervised by Jamaican \"Chigroes\" (a portmanteau of 'Chinese' + 'Negroes', referring to their mixed ancestry), however they are paid good wages and given decent accommodations. No one who comes to the island is allowed to leave. No, with aid from the Soviets, sabotages the nearby tests of American missiles by jamming their signals and making them land and explode on a different target than that planned. This forces the Americans to spend time and money redesigning their missiles. He also recovers unexploded missiles from the ocean and turns them over to the Russians. No also admits there is more to play than the shopworn East-West rivalry; his intent is to create enmity between the USSR and USA in an attempt to make the Cold War hot. This was further revealed in Ernst Stavro Blofeld's master plan using the \"three fighting fish\" as an analogy; when the Cold War ended, SPECTRE would then engage in sabotage and subversion against the victor, now weakened from the war. Bond does not actually learn of No's plot until he and Quarrel\u2014with Honey Rider, who would trespass to find shells\u2014had infiltrated Crab Key and been captured. Bond had gone there after Commander Strangways had disappeared, murdered by No's henchmen. Bond eventually kills No by suffocating him in a mound of guano. ===Henchmen in the novel=== *Miss Taro *Miss Chung *Sister Rose *May *Riker *Other various \"Chigroes\" *The Three Blind Mice ==Film biography== Dr. No is a brilliant scientist with an implied Napoleon complex, and an example of the mad scientist trope. He is a self-described \"unwanted child of a German missionary and a Chinese girl of a good family\". He later \"became treasurer of the most powerful criminal society in China\"; in this case, the Tongs. He then \"escaped to America with $10,000,000\" of Tong gold bullion. He specialized in radiation, which cost him both of his hands; they were replaced with crude bionic metal ones. No's hands have great strength (he can crush a metal figurine with them) but are lacking in manual dexterity which leads to his demise. He offered his skills and expertise to the Americans, and then the Soviets, but was rejected by both superpowers. To get revenge, No joined the criminal organization SPECTRE and relocated to his island in Crab Key in Jamaica. When Bond is sent to investigate the murder of two British agents and any possible connection with recent rocket disasters, No orders several attempts on 007's life. He is particularly displeased with henchman Professor Dent's failures, such as through the chauffeur Jones. He gives Dent a venomous spider, which is released in Bond's room whilst he sleeps; however, Bond wakes up, kills it, and lures Dent to a private house, where Dent is interrogated and then shot twice by Bond. No fails in his own attempts to kill Bond; first, inadvertently, by locking him in a ventilation shaft, which is variously heated and filled with water; and then, deliberately, by beating him with his metal hands. No captures Bond and Honey Rider when they trespass on his island, and they are put through a decontamination shower since No's henchmen detected radiation on them. Inviting them to dinner at his private apartment, he offers Bond a position in his organization, but Bond refuses. Bond escapes through a ventilation shaft (and avoiding the obstacles of heat and flooding), and disguises himself with a radiation suit. Bond enters the control area where No and his assistants are preparing to disrupt the launch of an American rocket. Bond sabotages No's swimming pool reactor, allowing the American missile to launch successfully while No and most of his henchmen do not understand it. When No observes Bond's sabotage, the two men fight while the personnel flees the imminent explosion. They fall onto a small platform that slowly descends into the boiling coolant of the overheating reactor. Bond manages to climb out, but No cannot get a grip on the metal framework, due to his metal hands, and is poached alive. Bond frees Honey from where she has been chained in a room filling with water, and escapes before the reactor explodes. SPECTRE learned of the death of Dr. No and they vowed revenge on James Bond, which lead to the events in From Russia with Love. This also set the events of James Bond battling SPECTRE in the future films. ===Henchmen in the film=== *Miss Taro - arrested *Professor Dent - shot by Bond *Freelance, the photographer - survived *Mr. Jones - poisoned himself with a cyanide laced cigarette *The Three Blind Mice - killed in fiery crash when their hearse plunged off a cliff *Sister Rose *Sister Lily *Jamaican guards ==Other appearances== Dr. No as seen in the James Bond Jr. animated series. Dr. No made several appearances in the cartoon series James Bond Jr.. His skin, however, was rendered bright green similar to the Mandarin in Iron Man possibly due to the chemicals he was exposed to in the film. Julius No also appeared in the video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent (almost-completely unrelated, especially in the meaning of the title, to the 1995 film) voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Despite his death in both the book and film, he appears alongside fellow enemies Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Auric Goldfinger, Francisco Scaramanga and Xenia Onatopp. In the game, Xenia Onatopp works for No and he seems to possess a considerable army of well- equipped henchmen as well as numerous tanks and helicopter gunships that resemble V-22 Ospreys. He also seems to have soldiers placed on countless rooftops and buildings in Hong Kong. He is electrocuted by his own reactor in a fight with the rogue 00 agent \"GoldenEye\". Julius No is also a multiplayer character in the video game 007: From Russia with Love and is a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 video game GoldenEye 007 for the Wii. The character of Dr. No makes a brief appearance in a 2012 Heineken beer commercial to promote the release of the twenty-third Bond film, Skyfall. ===Non-official James Bond media=== In Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton Universe (Win Scott Eckert, ed., MonkeyBrain Books, 2005), Win Scott Eckert contributes \"Who's Going to Take Over the World When I'm Gone?\" wherein he posits that No's mother was an agent of Fu Manchu named Madame de Medici, who was in turn the daughter of Fu Xi, from Sax Rohmer's novel The Golden Scorpion. Likewise in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, No is stated as being a distant relative of Fu Manchu. Later in the book, it is revealed that Bond's mission to stop Dr. No was a fraud, an alibi for Bond to kill a British leader for the Americans \u2014 \"There was No Doctor.\" In the alternate history novel Dracula Cha Cha Cha, Dr. No (along with Mr. Big) is mentioned as being vampire elders killed and drained by the Diogenes Club agent Hamish Bond. ==Cultural references== During the 1981 Ontario general election Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis mocked the Liberal leader Dr. Stuart Smith and his critical attitude towards the government by calling him \"Dr. No\". \"Dr. No\" was also used as the nickname of Northern Irish unionist politician Ian Paisley, due to his long-standing opposition to making concessions to Northern Ireland's Catholic community and to Irish nationalism. Similarly, American Republican politician and physician Tom Coburn was also known as \"Dr. No\" for his frequent opposition to legislation in the United States Congress, particularly bills which would increase federal spending. This nickname was also given to Representative Ron Paul for voting similarly against many bills, as well as his background as a medical doctor. ===Parodies=== *In a nod to this character, the master villain of the 1967 Bond spoof Casino Royale is named \"Dr. Noah\". *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine features a parodic villain named \"Dr. Noah\" in the episode \"Our Man Bashir\". *The television series Get Smart featured part Chinese villains named \"Dr Yes\" (with unusually long, sharp fingernails, at least one of which is lethally envenomed) and \"The Claw\" (with a magnetic claw in place of one hand). *Doctor Claw appears as the perennial villain in the Inspector Gadget series. *Dr. No also has made appearances in Auckland University Students' Association election campaigns, as a face for the 'no confidence' vote. *Lego Agents main villain \"Dr. Inferno\" is a parody of Dr. No. *Austin Powers series main antagonist Dr. Evil is a parody of several Bond villains, including Julius No. *The 1964 Flintstones episode \"Dr. Sinister\" features a character named \"Madam Yes\", a parody of Dr. No. *In an episode of the animated series The Fairly OddParents, Schnozmo must regain his brother Comso's trust by \"saving\" him from the evil Dr. Maybe. *The main antagonist of the James Pond franchise is named Dr. Maybe. *The main antagonist of the Operation Stealth video game (released as James Bond: The Stealth Affair in the U.S.) is named Dr. Why. ==References== Category:Bond villains Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century Category:Dr. No (film) Category:Fictional mad scientists Category:Fictional amputees Category:Literary characters introduced in 1958 Category:Fictional Chinese people Category:Fictional German people Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Male literary villains Category:Male characters in film Category:Fictional terrorists Category:Male film villains Category:Action film villains ",
