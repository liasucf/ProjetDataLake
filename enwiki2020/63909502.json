The festival later became a programming partner of Delphi Bank Greek Film Festival, and subsequently expanded to include both local and international films. The 9th Greek Australian Short Film Festival coincided with the 25th anniversary of the Greek Film Festival, and took place in October 2018. The festival showcases short films in three categories: International Shorts, Australian Documentary Shorts, and Australian Shorts. Films are judged by a panel of prominent Greek figures in entertainment. == References == Category:Greek-Australian culture Category:Film festivals in Melbourne Category:Film festivals in Sydney Category:Film festivals in Australia Category:Cinema of Greece Category:Greek film awards ",
