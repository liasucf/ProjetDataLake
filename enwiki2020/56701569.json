His name occurs in financial documents from the 1620s and in Chuvash legends.. The Chuvash feudal system that existed in the Khanate of Kazan was abandoned soon after the Chuvash country was annexed by Russia. A great part of Chuvash aristocracy was killed during the invasion of the Khanate of Kazan by the Muscovites (1545 \u2013 1552) and subsequent uprisings (1552 \u2013 1585). The survivors became vassals of the Russian Tsar and in a short time lost their status as noblemen, their real properties being awarded to Russian landlords and monasteries. In the 17th century, there still existed a number of Chuvash noblemen of low and middle rank, i.e. sergeants vunp\u00fc, lieutenants \u015b\u0115rp\u00fc and tarkhans turxan who were equated by the authorities to Russian servicemen. The only high-rank Chuvash nobleman that is mentioned in the contemporary Russian sources is the \u201cknyaz Temey Tenyakov\u201d. In Chuvash system, he held the title p\u00fc, corresponding to Common Turkic beg or bey. According to Russian documents, on 12 May 1625, the Chuvash knyaz Temey Tenyakov and his companions were granted fields along the Little Autla River (now in J\u0115pre\u015b district of Chuvashia) by the voivode of \u0160upa\u0161kar Nikita Likharev. At that time, Tenyakov served as a lieutenant in the \u0160erdan volost of the \u0160upa\u0161kar uyezd. His residence was located in the village of M\u0103n P\u00fckassi (\u201cPrince's big village\u201d in Chuvash). The location of Tenyakov's residence in M\u0103n P\u00fckassi is further confirmed by Chuvash legends. In a legend recorded in 1969 in the village of Na\u010dar \u010cemur\u0161a, Ten\u00e4k Temej\u0115 is described as a cruel landlord who dispossessed Chuvash peasants of their lands. To escape from his atrocities, all Tatar and almost all Chuvash inhabitants of Na\u010dar \u010cemur\u0161a left the village. In his book \u201cThe ancient Chuvashes\u201d, the novelist Juxma Mi\u0161\u0161i depicts Ten\u00e4k Temej\u0115 as a betrayer of the Chuvash people who assisted the Russian authorities whilst most of his bannermen supported anti-Muscovite resistance movement. However, after a while he repented and joined the Chuvash rebels. He raised an army and took the fortress of \u015a\u0115rp\u00fc. Then he marched his army to the town of S\u0115ve but was captured by the Russians. He was enchained and brought to the Tsar.
