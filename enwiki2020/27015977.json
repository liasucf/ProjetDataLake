The opening of this school justified the main aim - the nurses of the school were supposed to take care of the patients in the medical center and the medical institutions. The secondary medical school used to have its boarding house and students from different towns in North Macedonia. The first school principal was Hristina Spiridonova, who was at that time the ex- principal of the midwife's school. She made all the preparations for the school opening. The first instructor was Blaga Beleva, a nurse from \u0160tip. This school aroused a great interest among people. The lectures were held at the premises of the old midwife's school and the boarding school was placed in the old building of the gymnasium. The teachers were engaged only on honorary basis. == Programs == Students enrolled in the school choose one of these programs: *Nursing *Gynecology/Obstetric Nursing *Dental technician *Pharmacy technician *Physiotherapy Technician ==See also== * Education in North Macedonia * \u0160tip * North Macedonia == External links == * Medical School \"Jane Sandanski\" website Category:Education in North Macedonia Category:Educational institutions established in 1956 Category:\u0160tip ",
