Lathers was well-skilled in English and grammar, benefiting from training by his mother, an English teacher. Lathers worked as a stringer for a Detroit newspaper, where he grew to dislike the constant editing of his writing by others. He was then motivated to start his own newspaper where no one else could edit his writing. Moving from the Detroit area to Mears in 1909, Lathers started The Mears News (he initially spelled the word News in the name with an s) and believed it was his life's calling to report on items related to Mears, his adopted hometown. His simple meager lifestyle sacrificed personal financial gain to keep his newspaper going. Lathers wrote all his own stories and reports. He printed the newspapers on a foot-operated printing press. Lathers would hand deliver the newspapers himself locally. The newspaper, printed and published from Lathers' home, was known as The Smallest Newspaper in the World. It was published on a paper that was smaller than the normal size bond. Its size was approximately that of a postcard at about five by seven inches and consisted of four pages. The weekly newspaper was published every Friday from 1914 to 1970. Lathers had paid subscribers in 38 states. Sometime after 1916 and before 1919 the News name was changed to Newz on the suggestion from a subscriber to add more flair. The Mears Newz in its height of production during the 1940s had a worldwide circulation of over 2000. Lathers had a circulation at one time of over 2,700 when he voluntarily cut the list. Those whose name started before D and all those after S no longer received his newspaper. This way then he could keep his subscription circulation manageable. Lathers had forthright remarks and candid comments in each of his newspapers. Because of his plainspoken approach the newspaper had enthusiastic readers interested in this type of journalism. Lathers often would have one large paragraph of advertisements in the newspaper written end-to-end. Occasionally there was poetry written in the newspaper. The subscription cost for the newspaper was 50 cents per year and 1 dollar for a six-month subscription. Lathers was once insulted when he first started publishing his Newz paper when a local businessman told him that his publication would not last even six months and offered him 25 cents. Then and there he set his subscription fee at 50 cents a year, 1 dollar for six months and 2 dollars for 3 months. The newspaper was in production for 56 years and the subscription cost never changed. The Mears News made its debut July 24, 1914. In this first issues were suggestions for the first Golden Fair of Golden Township in Oceana County, Michigan. The \"af-fair\" was the only township fair in the county. Mort Wiegrand, the Mears Historical Society's director believes that it was the first township fair in the state of Michigan. The concept of the fair was to gather the school children of the area together in competitive events for awards. It included crowning a \"queen\" and a \"king\" for the township. The annual fair was disrupted and stopped in 1918 for sixteen years. Then on October 5 of 1934 it was reported by The Mears Newz that \"The Golden Fair is ripe in the Land of Mears.\" The continued annual fair event was the subject of reportage until the newspaper folded in 1970. == Front page == thumb Gardens Scratchers are ripe in the Land of Mears: front page cover example The front page format nameplate wording of the title changed in the 1930s from A Magazine of Mirth Founded A.D. 1914 By Swift Lathers to the more recognized line of The Smallest Newspaper in the Worldused on its masthead until the paper stopped publication in 1970.
