As a rookie, he played mainly on special teams and was a part of the Super Bowl XII winning team, recovering a fumble during the game. In his second season, he was named the special teams captain and solidified his status as one of the best players on the unit. He won the team's special teams player of the year award twice. He was also considered one of the strongest players on the team. On August 24, 1981, to make room for rookie Danny Spradlin, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns in exchange of a sixth round draft choice (#143-Ken Hammond). ===Cleveland Browns=== In 1981, he appeared in 16 games (2 starts), but after the team signed Tom Cousineau in the offseason, he demanded to be traded and was sent to the Chicago Bears in exchange of a seventh round draft choice (#176-Rocky Belk) on August 13, 1982. ===Chicago Bears=== In 1982, he was a backup linebacker with the Chicago Bears.
