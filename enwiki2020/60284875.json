    "text": "The men's Greco-Roman heavyweight competition at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome took place from 26 to 31 August at the Basilica of Maxentius. Nations were limited to one competitor. ==Competition format== This Greco-Roman wrestling competition continued to use the \"bad points\" elimination system introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics for Greco-Roman and at the 1932 Summer Olympics for freestyle wrestling, though adjusted the point values slightly. Wins by fall continued to be worth 0 points and wins by decision continued to be worth 1 point. Losses by fall, however, were now worth 4 points (up from 3). Losses by decision were worth 3 points (consistent with most prior years, though in some losses by split decision had been worth only 2 points). Ties were now allowed, worth 2 points for each wrestler. The elimination threshold was also increased from 5 points to 6 points. The medal round concept, used in 1952 and 1956 requiring a round-robin amongst the medalists even if one or more finished a round with enough points for elimination, was used only if exactly three wrestlers remained after a round\u2014if two competitors remained, they faced off head-to-head; if only one, he was the gold medalist.Official Report, p. 498. ==Results== ===Round 1=== ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" !

No more bouts were therefore possible, and the competition ended. Bohdan had the fewest points, at 4, and therefore took the gold medal. Dietrich and Kub\u00e1t were tied at 5 points, and had drawn their head-to-head bout. The tie was therefore broken by body weight, with Dietrich (the lighter man) winning the silver medal. Kozma's victory over Sosnowski in this round also functioned as the tie-breaker between the two wrestlers for 4th place. ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" !
