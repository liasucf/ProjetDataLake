    "text": "In mathematics, Schur's inequality, named after Issai Schur, establishes that for all non-negative real numbers x, y, z and t, :x^t (x-y)(x-z) + y^t (y-z)(y-x) + z^t (z-x)(z-y) \\ge 0 with equality if and only if x = y = z or two of them are equal and the other is zero. When t is an even positive integer, the inequality holds for all real numbers x, y and z. When t=1, the following well-known special case can be derived: :x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3xyz \\geq xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) == Proof == Since the inequality is symmetric in x,y,z we may assume without loss of generality that x \\geq y \\geq z. Then the inequality : (x-y)[x^t(x-z)-y^t(y-z)]+z^t(x-z)(y-z) \\geq 0 clearly holds, since every term on the left-hand side of the inequality is non-negative. This rearranges to Schur's inequality. == Extensions == A generalization of Schur's inequality is the following: Suppose a,b,c are positive real numbers. If the triples (a,b,c) and (x,y,z) are similarly sorted, then the following inequality holds: :a (x-y)(x-z) + b (y-z)(y-x) + c (z-x)(z-y) \\ge 0. In 2007, Romanian mathematician Valentin Vornicu showed that a yet further generalized form of Schur's inequality holds: Consider a,b,c,x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{R}, where a \\geq b \\geq c, and either x \\geq y \\geq z or z \\geq y \\geq x. Let k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}, and let f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{+} be either convex or monotonic. Then, : {f(x)(a-b)^k(a-c)^k+f(y)(b-a)^k(b-c)^k+f(z)(c-a)^k(c-b)^k \\geq 0}. The standard form of Schur's is the case of this inequality where x = a, y = b, z = c, k = 1, \u0192(m) = mr.Vornicu, Valentin; Olimpiada de Matematica... de la provocare la experienta; GIL Publishing House; Zalau, Romania. Another possible extension states that if the non-negative real numbers x \\geq y \\geq z \\geq v with and the positive real number t are such that x + v \u2265 y + z then : x^t (x-y)(x-z)(x-v) + y^t (y-x)(y-z)(y-v) + z^t (z-x)(z-y)(z-v) + v^t (v-x)(v-y)(v-z) \\ge 0. ==Notes== Category:Inequalities Category:Articles containing proofs ",
