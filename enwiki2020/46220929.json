    "text": "\"I've Got to Go Now\" is a song written by David Ricketts and Toni Childs and released as the first single from Childs' second album House of Hope. The lyrics tell a tale of a woman leaving an abusive relationship. In a review of House of Hope, Tom Demalon of AllMusic said, \"Childs dramatic vocals imbue the protagonist with willful, albeit fragile, resolve and a spirit that is moving\". The song was a commercial success in Australia, reaching number five on the ARIA Singles Chart, and it also peaked at number 19 in New Zealand. It has since gone Gold in Australia for sales greater than 35,000 copies. The song was not as successful worldwide, only managing to reach number 78 in Germany. ==Track listings== 7-inch and CD single # \"I've Got to Go Now\" \u2013 4:40 # \"Three Days\" \u2013 4:14 UK CD single # \"I've Got to Go Now\" \u2013 4:40 # \"Don't Walk Away\" (extended remix) \u2013 7:32 # \"Three Days\" \u2013 4:15 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1991) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1991) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |align=center|36 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 songs Category:1991 singles Category:A&M; Records singles Category:Polydor Records singles Category:Songs written by David Ricketts ",
