    "text": "Hi-Point Firearms, also known as Strassell's Machine, Inc (distributed by MKS Supply), is an American firearms manufacturer based in Mansfield, Ohio. All of their firearms are manufactured in the United States, in several different locations in Ohio. ==Construction of products== ===Pistols=== A Hi-Point JCP pistol Hi-Point semi-automatic pistols are polymer framed and generally regarded as simple, inexpensive handguns, which trade-off aesthetics for lower manufacturing cost. Based on a simple blowback design, Hi-Point pistols do not have a breech-locking system like most handguns. Instead they have large, heavy slides that hold the breech closed through sheer mass. The result is a heavier gun, for its size, that is bulkier and may be less aesthetically appealing than designs employing recoil operation. While making the pistols heavier, this design also makes them mechanically simple and easy to maintain. Hi-Point recommends hosing out the action with a powder solvent like Break Free Powder Blast, Rem Oil or another aerosol solvent every 300 to 400 rounds, then running a cleaning brush through the bore. Many semi-automatic pistols can be field stripped without the use of any tools. However, Hi-Point pistols require a small punch or a small screwdriver and a hammer to remove a pin in the receiver, in order to permit slide removal (and thus enable field- stripping). Rather than being machined from forged steel, the slide is die cast from Zamak-3 (A traditional zinc alloy, also popularly referred to as pot metal or white metal). When asked why die-casting was chosen as a manufacturing technique, a Hi-Point representative responded, \"In the area of Ohio where we are located, there are many shops that specialize in die casting for the auto industry. We utilize this resource.\" Uncommon for this construction, they are rated for +P ammunition in calibers up to .45 ACP. Blowback designs are generally simpler in design and easier and cheaper to manufacture than locked-breech recoil-operated firearms. And while the fixed barrel of a blowback gun generally will contribute to improved accuracy, blowback guns usually need to be larger and heavier than a locked-breech gun firing the same caliber. ===Carbines=== The Hi-Point carbine is a series of pistol-caliber carbines manufactured by Hi-Point Firearms chambered, for 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto, .45 ACP and .380 ACP handgun cartridges. They are very inexpensive, constructed using polymers and alloyed metals as much as possible, resulting in a reduction of production costs and sale price. It functions via a simple direct blowback action. Hi-Point carbines use a polymer stock, stamped sheet metal receiver cover, and a receiver and bolt cast from Zamak-3. The barrel is steel and button rifled using a 1-10\" right hand twist. ===Use of zinc alloy=== Some people are wary of Hi-Points because of the use of zinc alloy (Zamak-3) castings in much of their construction. However, the parts made from Zamak-3 in Hi-Point guns (the receiver and bolt/slide) are low-stress components that do not require the strength of steel at these pistol cartridge power levels. Higher stress and wear components in Hi-Points, like the barrel, chamber, breech and other small parts, are made of steel. ==Calibers== Hi-Point manufactures firearms in the following calibers: * .380 ACP \u2013 Model CF-380 and 380COMP * 9\u00d719mm Parabellum \u2013 C-9 and C-9 COMP pistols and YC-9 * .40 S&W; \u2013 Model JCP pistol * .45 ACP \u2013 Model JHP pistol * Hi-Point Carbines chambered in .380 ACP, 9mm Luger, .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto, and .45 ACP ==Safety== Hi-Point firearms have a manual thumb safety and an integral drop safety that prevents firing in the event that the firearm is dropped. Until recently, all Hi-Point products except the 995 (9mm) carbine had a last-round lock open and magazine disconnect safety, preventing firing unless a magazine was in the gun. With the replacement of the original 9mm carbine with the new 995 TS model, all pistols and carbines now have these features. ==Gallery== File:380 acp.jpg|Hi-Point CF380 pistol with two-tone finish; the C-9 is identical except it is simply black, and chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum File:Hipoint1.jpg|Hi-Point C380 pistol with the slide locked back File:Hp995carbine22.jpg|\"Generation 1\" 995 Hi-Point Carbine ==References== ==External links== * * MKS Supply's website * Instruction Sheet for C9 and CF380 Pistols * Instruction manual for 40 S&W; and 45acp Pistols Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States Category:Companies based in Ohio ",
