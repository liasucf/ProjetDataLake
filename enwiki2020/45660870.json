According to the acclaimed poet Ernesto Cardenal, she was \"the first women of letters of Nicaragua and was of great importance as a promoter of Nicaraguan culture\". In 1940, she founded the literary association C\u00edrculo de Letras and opened the publishing house Nuevos Horizontes which played an important part in collecting and reviving Nicaragua's most significant literary works. Cardenal also tells us that \"For a long, fruitful period for Nicaraguan literature (the 1940s and 1950s), her home was a meeting place for writers and artists, and a venue for conferences and exhibitions\". Commenting on her second collection of poetry (Oasis, 1943), the Guatemalan critic Ramiro C\u00f3rdoba writes: \"Inside her pages, we breathe in the scent of the wooded countryside but do not see the swarm of cantharides above, driving our natives into a spate of frenzied dancing.\" For many years, she travelled through the countries of Central America promoting Nicaraguan culture. One of her conferences was devoted to the work of the Nicaraguan writer Joaqu\u00edn Pasos (1914\u20131947), at another she presented the anti-fascist Spanish poet Le\u00f3n Felipe (1884\u20131968). S\u00e1nchez was involved in the demands for female suffrage in her country in the 1950s although she was accused by Joaquina Vega of not being as committed as some. One of the arguments was just about whether General Emilio Chamorro was to read their demands or another person. The argument also involved the conservative Margarita Cole Zavala but the presentation to congress was in the end unimportant as it took several more years to obtain their demands. Her splendidly simple verse evokes themes common to her compatriots: pain, sadness, desolation, loneliness, premonition of death and anguish, all of which can be summarized in one word: farewell. ==Awards== In 1945, S\u00e1nchez was awarded the Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Prize for her poetry. In the 1980s, she received the Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Order of Cultural Independence. ==Works== * Sombras, Managua, 1939 * Oasis, Managua, 1943 * Canci\u00f3n de los caminos, Managua, 1949 * El hombre feliz y otros cuentos, Managua, 1957 * Canto amargo, Managua, 1958 * Poemas de la tarde, Managua, 1963 * Poemas agradeciendo a Dios, Managua, 1964 * El poeta pregunta por Stella, Managua, 1967 ==References== Category:20th-century Nicaraguan poets Category:1918 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Managua Category:Nicaraguan women writers Category:20th-century women writers Category:Nicaraguan women poets ",
