    "text": "Montgomery Elevator Company was a vertical transportation company founded in 1892. It entered the elevator business in 1910 and acquired Roelofson Elevator of Galt Ontario in the early 1960s and operated it as its Canadian Division. Montgomery manufactured elevators, escalators & moving walkways until 1994, when it was acquired by KONE. Montgomery was the 4th-largest elevator company in the U.S. at the time. After Montgomery was acquired, they worked with KONE to make elevators and escalators under the brand name Montgomery KONE, but only for 6 years until the full integration into KONE US in 2000. One of the most unusual Montgomery elevators in the world is the elevator tramway in the St. Louis Gateway Arch. ==See also== * List of elevator manufacturers Category:Elevator manufacturers Category:Escalator manufacturers Category:American companies established in 1892 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1892 Category:1892 establishments in Illinois Category:1994 disestablishments in Illinois ",
