    "text": "\"Sasuke\" is a song by American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. It was released on April 24, 2020 and serves as the lead single of his upcoming third studio album. It peaked at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track's title is a reference to the Naruto character Sasuke, which Uzi also references multiple times in the track. The track is his first single as a lead artist since the release of his album Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2, which was released on March 13, 2020, and is the deluxe edition of his second studio album Eternal Atake, which was released a week before the album. == Critical reception == The track received mixed-to-negative reviews. Diego Ramos of Daily Trojan gave the track two stars out of five, saying that the track \"falls short of expectations\", and said that the song \"does have a Carti-esque nature, but it also sounds like a generic Uzi song\", with \"references to fashion, sexual innuendos and cars in the typical Uzi delivery\" that \"make for nothing special\". Marcus Pruitt of AudiblWav said that the track \"doesn\u2019t bring quite the same punch as other tracks he released earlier this year\", saying that the song \"opened up with a ton of potential, but fell flat as it progressed\". The song also garnered negative reactions from fans. == Commercial performance == The track debuted at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100, failing to match the previous commercial success of his previous single, \"That Way\". == Controversy == The track was the subject of controversy between his beef with rapper Playboi Carti, with Uzi allegedly dissing him on the track. He denied dissing Carti. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ !Chart (2020) !Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100) |79 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) |10 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 |65 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) |29 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rap Songs (Billboard) |24 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 |32 |} == References == Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Lil Uzi Vert songs Category:Songs about fictional male characters Category:Songs written by Lil Uzi Vert ",
