    "text": "The 1984 MTV Video Music Awards aired live on September 14, 1984, honoring the best music videos from May 2, 1983, to May 2, 1984. The show was hosted by Dan Aykroyd and Bette Midler at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Herbie Hancock was the night's biggest winner, taking home five awards, followed by Michael Jackson, who won three. The night's main award, Video of the Year, went to The Cars for \"You Might Think\". This was the first of only a few instances in the show's history where the video of the year did not win any other awards. In terms of nominations, Hancock's \"Rockit\" and The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\" were the most nominated videos, receiving eight nominations apiece. Cyndi Lauper was the most nominated artist of the night, with nine nods overall for two of her videos: six for \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", which eventually won the Best Female Video Moonman, and three for \"Time After Time\". Other major nominees included the aforementioned Jackson and The Cars, both of whom received six nominations each for their videos \"Thriller\" and \"You Might Think\" respectively; ZZ Top, who also received six nominations between their videos for \"Legs\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\", and \"Gimme All Your Lovin'\"; and Billy Idol, who garnered five nominations for \"Dancing with Myself\" and \"Eyes Without a Face\". Lastly, David Bowie earned four nominations for his \"China Girl\" and \"Modern Love\" videos, and was also one of the night's honorees for the Video Vanguard award. ==Nominations== Winners are in bold text. {| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"150%\" |- !

She emerged from a 17-foot tall wedding cake wearing a \"racy\", \"risque\" see-through wedding dress and bustier, with a silver belt buckle that read \"BOY TOY\". While descending the steps of the cake, one of her high heeled shoes slipped off, prompting her to dive to the floor and roll around to cover up the wardrobe malfunction. Her attempt to retrieve the shoe inadvertently led to her flashing her underwear on live television. Madonna later told Billboard after the incident, \"So I thought, 'Well, I'll just pretend I meant to do this,' and I dove onto the floor and I rolled around\". ==Appearances== * Ed Koch \u2013 proclaimed that Radio City Music Hall would be renamed \"Video City Music Hall\" for the night before introducing hosts Bette Midler and Dan Aykroyd * Cyndi Lauper \u2013 read the eligibility and voting rules in gibberish described as similar to \"ancient Babylonian\" * Roger Daltrey \u2013 smashed a guitar onstage while presenting the award for Best Overall Performance in a Video * Diana Ross \u2013 accepted all three of Michael Jacksons awards on his behalf Note: See #8 * Grace Slick and Mickey Thomas \u2013 presented Best New Artist in a Video * J.J.
