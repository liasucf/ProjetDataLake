In their first season under head coach Alex Yunevich, the Bearcats compiled a 5\u20133 record and were outscored by their opponents by a combined total of 82 to 81. The team defeated in-state rival Michigan State Normal (13\u201312) but lost to rival Western State Teachers (0\u201313). Its worst defeat was by a 38\u20130 score against Gus Dorais' 1934 Detroit Titans football team. Yunevich was hired as the head football coach at Central State in May 1934 after George Van Bibber accepted the head coaching position at the University of Buffalo. Both Yunevich and Van Biber were alumni of Purdue University. Yunevich had been an assistant coach at Central States under Van Bibber. ==Schedule== ==References== ==External links== * 1935 Chippewa yearbook Central State Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Central State Bearcats football ",
