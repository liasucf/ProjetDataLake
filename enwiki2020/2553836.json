Many theatres open their doors for free to shows that range from classical music and ballet to hiphop, cabaret, literary recitals and film. Besides that, there are stands on the square and surrounding streets selling books or giving information on various cultural events of the next year. The image shows Symfonisch Blaasorkest ATH performing with singer G\u00e9 Reinders at the 2006 edition of the Uitmarkt. The name literally means outmarket, referring to 'going out' (to see a show). == References == ==External links== * Category:Culture in Amsterdam ",
