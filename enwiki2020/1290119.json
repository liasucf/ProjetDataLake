    "text": "Elisabeth Lupka (27 October 1902 \u2013 8 January 1949) was a Nazi female guard at two camps during World War II. Lupka was born in Klein-Damner, Germany (present-day D\u0105br\u00f3wka Ma\u0142a, Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland). She got married in 1934, had no children and soon divorced. In 1937 she went to Berlin to work in an aircraft factory. In 1942 she left her menial job as a laborer and came to Ravensbr\u00fcck to undergo training as a camp guard. Lupka graduated and later became an Aufseherin over several work details. In March 1943, she was assigned to the German Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland as an Aufseherin then as a Blockf\u00fchrerin (Block Overseer), where she physically beat many prisoners with a whip and selected many others for the gas chambers. She stayed in the camp until its last evacuations in early January 1945 and accompanied a death march to Loslau. She returned to Ravensbr\u00fcck later that same month. On 6 June 1945, Lupka was arrested by Allied troops and sent to an internment camp. Two years later, on 6 July 1948, after a long investigation, she appeared at a Krak\u00f3w court for war crimes, mainly the maltreatment of prisoners and her involvement in selections of inmates to the gas chambers. She was found guilty, and executed by short-drop hanging, on 8 January 1949, in Montelupich prison in Krak\u00f3w. She was 46 years old. Her corpse was later sent to Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland for use by medical students. == References == Category:1902 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Auschwitz concentration camp personnel Category:Executed German women Category:Executed Nazi concentration camp personnel Category:Executed German people Category:Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp personnel Category:Nazis executed by Poland by hanging Category:People from \u015awiebodzin County Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg Category:Female guards in Nazi concentration camps ",
