    "text": "Single Flame, the second album of British singer-songwriter Lucy Ward, was released in the United Kingdom by Navigator Records on 19 August 2013. It was critically acclaimed and received a four-starred review in The Guardian. ==Songs== The album includes \"For the Dead Men\", a self-penned protest song, which was released as a single in January 2012 coupled with a remixed version of \"Maids When You\u2019re Young\". ==Reception== In a four-starred review for The Guardian, Robin Denselow said that Lucy Ward \"proves to be an even more mature and thoughtful singer-songwriter than she was on Adelphi Has to Fly\" and described her follow-up album as \"impressive and original\" and \"a brooding, often angry set that deals with everything from politics to love, death and personal tragedy, with a couple of powerful traditional songs added in\". Hazel Davis, for americanaUK, described it as a much angrier album than her debut release but \"a genuinely eclectic sounding collection\" with \"songs that are Thea Gilmore-good\". Simon Holland, for Folk Radio UK, said that the album was \"charged, emotive and utterly compelling\". ==Track listing== # \"I Cannot Say I Will Not Speak\" (Lucy Ward) 4:04 # \"Honey\" (Stu Hanna/Lucy Ward) 3:41 # \"The Last Pirouette\" (Lucy Ward) 3:55 # \"Icarus\" (Lucy Ward) 5:14 # \"Velvet Sky\" (Stu Hanna/Lucy Ward) 4:13 # \"Rites of Man\" (Lucy Ward) 5:08 # \"The Consequence\" (Lucy Ward) 2:15 # \"Lord I Don't Want To Die in the Storm (Stu Hanna/Lucy Ward) 4:09 # \"For the Dead Men\" (Lucy Ward) 4:25 # \"Marching Through the Green Grass\" (Traditional) 2:50 # \"Ink\" (Lucy Ward) 4:11 # \"Shellback\" (Lucy Ward) 4:38 Total album length = 48:43 ==Personnel== * Lucy Ward \u2013 vocals, guitar, concertina * Izzl Cooper \u2013 cello * Anna Esslemont \u2013 violin (on \"For the Dead Men\") * Joy Gravestock \u2013 violin * Sebastian Hale Smith \u2013 double bass * Debbie Hanna \u2013 backing vocals * Stu Hanna \u2013 guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, B3 organ and backing vocals * Sam Pegg \u2013 bass guitar * Stephen MacLachlan \u2013 drums ==Production== Single Flame was produced by Stu Hanna from Megson, who also performs on the album, with his wife Debbie Hanna providing backing vocals. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Lucy Ward: Official website Category:2013 albums Category:Lucy Ward (musician) albums Category:Navigator Records albums ",
