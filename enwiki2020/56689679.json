In a positive review, The Los Angeles Timess Robert Lloyd offered the series praise saying, \"Its meanings are sometimes obscure and sometimes obvious, nearly to the point of being polemical, and most often somewhere in between. But its surfaces are always interesting and splendidly executed. Even the glitches are artfully placed.\" In a similarly positive critique, The Hollywood Reporters Robyn Bahr described the series as \"a beautiful sensory overload\" and commended the series visual look saying, \"the protean barrage of imagery and gonzo sound design overwhelms the senses. Once your brain gets used to its staccato rhythm, however, you settle in for the ride. Although I couldn't quite process all the nuances within the moment, I still found myself nodding along (and even dancing along) all the same.\" In another favorable assessment, Varietys Caroline Framke commended the series' various segments saying, \"they all reveal incisive truths about what it means to be black in America \u2014 or actually, \"reveal\" isn\u2019t quite the right word, and neither is \"show.\" Instead Acts of Flyness wants to make its (white) audience feel what it means to be black in America.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:English- language television shows Category:HBO original programming Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2010s American sketch comedy television series Category:2010s American late-night television series ",
