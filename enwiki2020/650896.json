She was at least 60 years of age and well past child bearing years when she gave birth to John. ==Biblical narrative== According to the Gospel of Luke, Elizabeth was \"of the daughters of Aaron\" (). She and her husband Zachariah were \"righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless\" (), but childless. While he was in the temple of the Lord (), Zacharias was visited by the angel Gabriel: Zacharias doubted whereby he could know this since both he and his wife were old. The angel identified himself as Gabriel and told Zacharias that he would be \"dumb, and not able to speak\" until the words were fulfilled, because he did not believe. When the days of his ministry were complete, he returned to his house (). According to the account, the angel Gabriel was then sent to Nazareth in Galilee to her relative Mary, a virgin, espoused to a man called Joseph, and informed her that she would conceive by the Holy Ghost and bring forth a son to be called Jesus. She was also informed that her \"relative Elizabeth\" had begun her sixth month of pregnancy, and Mary traveled to \"Hebron, in the hill country of Judah\",Compare The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge says, \"This was most probably Hebron, a city of the priests, and situated in the hill country of Judea, (Jos 11:21; 21:11, 13,) about 25 miles south of Jerusalem, and nearly 100 from Nazareth.\" to visit Elizabeth (). 15th century depiction of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, with Elizabeth on the left Matthew Henry comments, \"Mary knew that Elizabeth was with child, but it does not appear that Elizabeth had been told any thing of her relative Mary's being designed for the mother of the Messiah; and therefore what knowledge she appears to have had of it must have come by a revelation, which would be a great encouragement to Mary.\"Matthew Henry's Whole Bible Commentary After Mary heard Elizabeth's blessing, she spoke the words now known as the Magnificat (). That is the last mention of Elizabeth, who is not mentioned in any other chapter in the Bible. The chapter continues with the prophecy of Zacharias (known as the Benedictus,) and ends with the note that John \"grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts\" until his ministry to Israel began; so it is unknown how long Elizabeth and her husband lived after that (). A traditional \"tomb of Elizabeth\" is shown in the Franciscan Monastery of Saint John in the Wilderness near Jerusalem. ==Apocrypha== Elizabeth is mentioned in several books of the Apocrypha, most prominently in the Protevangelion of James, in which the birth of her son and the subsequent murder of her husband are chronicled. ==Sainthood== Elizabeth is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church on November 5, and in the Orthodox and Anglican traditions on September 5, on the same day with her husband Zacharias/Zechariah. She is commemorated as a matriarch in the Calendar of Saints (September 5) of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and Zacharias is commemorated as a prophet.} Mariotto Albertinelli's imagining of Elizabeth (right), here pictured with Mary ==Islam== Elizabeth (), the wife of Zachariah, the mother of John the Baptist, is an honored woman in Islam. Although Zachariah himself is frequently mentioned by name in the Qur'an, Elizabeth, while not mentioned by name, is referenced. She is revered by Muslims as a wise, pious and believing person who, like her relative Mary, was exalted by God to a high station. She lived in the household of Imran, and is said to have been a descendant of the prophet and priest Aaron.: \"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Jud\u00e6a, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elizabeth.\" Zachariah and his wife were both devout and steadfast in their duties. They were, however, both very old and they had no son. Therefore, Zachariah would frequently pray to God for a son.: \"And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors.\" This was not only out of the desire to have a son but also because the great Jesus Christ wanted someone to carry on the services of the Temple of prayer and to continue the preaching of the Lord's message before his death. God cured Elizabeth's barrenness and granted Zachariah a son, Yahya (John the Baptist), who became a prophet.: \"(To his son came the command): 'O John! take hold of the Book with might': and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,\" God thus granted the wishes of the couple because of their faith, trust and love for God. In the Qur'an, God speaks of Zachariah, his wife, and John, and describes the three as being humble servants of the : In Shia hadith she is named Hananah, and is identified as a sister of Mary's mother Hannah. Abu Basir recorded that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the great grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, had stated: \"Hannah, the wife of Imran, and Hananah, the wife of Zechariah, were sisters. He goes on to say that Mary was born from Hannah and John was born from Hananah. Mary gave birth to Jesus and he was the son of the daughter of John's aunt. John was the son of the aunt of Mary, and the aunt of one's mother is like one's aunt.\" ==See also== * Gospel of Luke * Visitation (Catholic feast) * Biblical figures in Islamic tradition * Saint Elizabeth, patron saint archive ==Notes and references== ==External links== * All About Elizabeth (Luke 1) Marg Mowczko * Stained glass depiction of Elizabeth and Zachary, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Etienne de Bourges Category:1st-century BC births Category:1st-century deaths Category:1st-century BC women Category:1st-century Christian female saints Category:Family of Jesus Category:Gospel of Luke Category:People from Hebron Category:People in the canonical gospels Category:Prophets of the New Testament Category:Roman-era Jews Category:Saints from the Holy Land Category:Christian saints from the New Testament Category:Women in the New Testament Category:Joachim Category:1st-century BC Christian saints gl:Isabel#Relixi\u00f3n ",
