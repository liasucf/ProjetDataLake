    "text": "In enzymology, a precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-2 \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-3A precorrin-2 substrate of the enzyme The two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and precorrin 2 and its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and precorrin 3A. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-4 C20-methyltransferase and another names in common use is CobI. The enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in aerobic bacteria. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes and . ==References== * * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of known structure ",
