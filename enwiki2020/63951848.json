The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and was available on 25 August 2016 worldwide. ==Gameplay== The game simulates the Flixbus. Fernbus Simulator is set in Federal Republic of Germany, offering a route network of approximately 20,000 kilometres and 40 German cities that is built in a scale of 1:10. The game features quite the same gameplay of the similar-genre video game Euro Truck Simulator 2, which includes construction sites, traffic congestion, police patrols and traffic collision, with dynamic weather and day-night cycle are available in the game. The game also provides the licensed MAN Lion's Coach of Flixbus, allowing players to drive on highly detailed German motorways. ==Development and release== Fernbus Simulator is developed by a German-based game studio TML- Studios, the developers of the City Bus Simulator series and the World of Subways franchise. It is powered by Unreal Engine 4 of Epic Games. The game was released on 25 August 2016 for Microsoft Windows. ==Reception== The game is well-sold on the digital distribution platform Steam, but often comes in criticism and gets a mixed rating. The game is often used to compare with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, and gets praised on the design of the game in terms of atmosphere, motorways, residential areas and detailed bus cockpit. However, bugs, missing textures, insufficient to reality and a lack of long-term motivation makes the game widely criticised. ==References== ==External links == * Category:2016 video games Category:Bus simulation video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ",
