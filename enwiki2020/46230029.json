    "text": "Sv\u00e9na (Sanskrit: \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928) is derived from the root \"sva\" (\u0938\u094d\u0935), a reflective adjective, meaning self or one\u2019s own or belonging to oneself; \"\u00e9na\" is a pronominal suffix meaning - \"by\" as in \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0928 (k\u0101l\u00e9na) \u2013 'by time' or 'by present time'. \"sva\" + \"\u00e9na\" = Sv\u00e9na means \u2013 'by your own' or 'by one\u2019s own conditioned nature'. This word first appears in the Rig Veda in mantra (R.V.I.139.2) addressed to Mitravaruna \u2013 : \u092f\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0941\u0923\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u093e\u0926\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u0926\u093e\u0925\u0947 \u0905\u0928\u0943\u0924\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093e \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093e | in which mantra Sv\u00e9na means - \"own\"; the phrase - anritam svena manyun\u0101 dakshasya means - \"discard mithy\u0101 (falsity) by one\u2019s own great fiery strength\". In Hindu philosophy, Sv\u00e9na refers to the realization of one\u2019s own true nature which is different from the notion of the body being the own Self. Shankara in his commentary on the Chandogya Upanishad reminds us that only those who have renounced all desire for the external world and who have nothing else to fall back upon are able to comprehend the Supreme reality of the unity of the Self. The enlightened being recognizing his real nature as lying apart from the body renounces the notion of the body being his Self. : \u090f\u0935\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0948\u0937 \u0938\u0902\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092f \u092a\u0930\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0924\u093f\u0930\u0941\u092a\u0938\u0902\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928 \u0930\u0942\u092a\u0947\u0923\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0938 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0903\u2026 : \" Thus indeed does this serene, happy being become manifest (or established) in its own real form (i.e. Self or nature) after having risen from this body and having reached the highest Light. That is the highest person;\u2026 \" - (Chandogya Upanishad.VIII.xii.3) Badarayana in the Sutra which reads : \u0938\u0902\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0903 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0928\u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0924\u094d | : \" Having reached the highest Light, the soul becomes manifest in its own real nature because of the use of the term in its own (in the Upanishad) \". \u2013 Brahma Sutras (IV.iv.1) draws our attention to the afore-cited statement of the Chandogya Upanishad. Shankara in his Bh\u0101\u015bya explains that the Supreme Self, which is attributeless, can have no connection with time, space etc., and, therefore, cannot be a goal to be reached in terms of place or time. The person who has realized his own real nature becomes the fearless eternal seer of unity; for him intentions, works, sorrow and delusion cease to hold any meaning for these belong to the An\u0101tman , the body and the phenomenal world. The enlightened soul then attains liberation \u2013 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d, sheds all bonds, and established in Its own Self, the highest being, continues as the Pure Self untouched by likes and dislikes, as the immortal Light of all lights. While advocating his concept of \"anatta\", Buddha stating \u2013 \"Of what is impermanent, sorrowful and liable to change, is it proper to regard it as \u2013 'this is mine', 'this I am', 'this is my soul'?\" - has followed a similar logic but without actually identifying the Self and leans towards the empirical finding of there being no evidence for its existence. ==References== Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Buddhist philosophical concepts Category:Sanskrit words and phrases Category:Vedanta Category:Yoga concepts Category:Adi Shankara ",
