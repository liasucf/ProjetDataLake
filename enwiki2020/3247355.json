    "text": "The events of the Ip massacre escalated in the early hours of 14 September 1940, in Ipp, (today Ip, S\u0103laj County), Northern Transylvania. After two Hungarian soldiers died there in an accidental explosion, rumors spread that they had been killed by Romanians. After another incident the Royal Hungarian Army, influenced by the rumor, indiscriminately killed around 150 ethnic Romanians in the nearby locations and surrounding areas. ==Events== After the Second Vienna Award of 30 August 1940, as a result of German\u2013Italian arbitration, northwestern Transylvania reverted to Hungary. The area ceded by Romania contained the northwestern part of the homonymous region and the Sz\u00e9kely lands. A total of eight of the 23 Transylvanian counties included in the interwar period were entirely alienated, and another three were split. Thus, S\u0103laj County was also attached to Hungary. On 7 September 1940 the Hungarian Second Army arrived at Ipp (present-day Ip) where they made a short stop. After preparing to leave, more acquired grenades exploded in one of the sling-carts and in the detonation two soldiers died. The negligence of the proper storage was quickly identified but soon rumor had it that it was a willful action. This view escalated rapidly.A t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelem tan\u00fai \u2013 Erd\u00e9ly \u2013 bevonul\u00e1s (1940), p. 25; On 8 September 1940, the Second Army entered the city of Zal\u0103u. On 13 September, the military commander of the district of Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (present-day \u0218imleu Silvaniei) was informed that the nearby villages of Als\u00f3kaznacs, Fels\u0151kaznacs, M\u00e1rkasz\u00e9k, Porc, Lecsm\u00e9r, Som\u00e1ly, and K\u00e9mer (present-day Cosniciu de Jos, Cosniciu de Sus, Marca, Por\u021b, Le\u0219mir, \u0218umal, and Cam\u0103r) armed Romanian groups were looting. According to the report their number was between 80\u2013100. Based on this report the 32nd Regiment stationing in Zilah (present-day Zal\u0103u) assigned a group to investigate the area. Meanwhile, the road, they arrived to Szil\u00e1gynagyfalu (present-day Nu\u0219fal\u0103u) where they had been informed a few days before in Ipp two soldiers died in a detonation thus the same day they entered the commune where they conducted a raid instantly.Ill\u00e9sfalvi P\u00e9ter: A rom\u00e1n-magyar kapcsolatok katonai vonatkoz\u00e1sai 1940\u20131944 k\u00f6z\u00f6tt (Pertinence of the Romanian-Hungarian military relations between 1940\u20131944), H\u00e1bor\u00fa, hadsereg, \u00f6sszeoml\u00e1s Magyarorsz\u00e1g katonai r\u00e9szv\u00e9tele \u00e9s szerepe a m\u00e1sodik vil\u00e1gh\u00e1bor\u00faban.

(War, army, downfall \u2013 The participation and role of Hungary in WWII) After the reconnaissance, 18 suspicious persons were found and 16 had been executed, according to the official reports, because of their attempts to desert. Overnight, the Hungarian troops were residing in the local school when they were shot at from the street with a machine gun around 03:00 AM (some witnesses attested that the shootings came from a flat in the center, and five persons with machine guns were captured). In retaliation, between 152 and 158 ethnic Romanians were killed. The commander of the Hungarian troops who perpetrated the massacre of civilians was lieutenant Zolt\u00e1n Vasv\u00e1ry. Some sources have stated that the Hungarian Army was supported by local vigilantes. The soldiers went house-to- house in panic and shot everybody indiscriminately. On 14 September, in Somly\u00f3csehi (present-day Cehei), one person was killed. In the nearby Fels\u0151kaznacs and Szil\u00e1gcseres forests (present-day Cosniciu de Sus and Ceri\u0219a) 55 persons were killed. According to some other sources, the area most affected was S\u0103laj, where 477 Romanians were massacred. On September 14, at the order of Lt. Vasv\u00e1ri, a pit 24 meters long by 4 meters wide was dug in the village cemetery; the corpses of those killed in the massacre were buried head-to-head in two rows, with no religious ceremony. ==Trial== The facts were established by Decision no. 1 of the Northern Transylvania People's Tribunal (which sat in Cluj and was presided by Justice Nicolae Matei), in a public sentence from 13 March 1946. The findings of the Tribunal were as follows: * Lieutenant colonel Carol Lehotcsky, the military commander of \u0218imleu Silvaniei district, was found guilty or ordering reprisals against the Romanian inhabitants of Ip and nearby villages. *\u0218tefan Farago, a landowner from Ip and commander of a local militia was convicted for inducing Lehotcsky to order those repressive measures. (Adalbert Ujhaly was also found to have participated in this inducement, but he had died before the trial.) *Lt. Vasv\u00e1ry was found guilty of commanding the unit that carried out the massacre. *Fifteen locals (Nicolae Bere\u0219, Sigismund P. Bere\u0219, Francisc Borz\u00e1si, Vasile K. Dere\u0219, Biro Emeric Jr., Biro Emeric Sr., Alexandru Csepe, Francisc I. Csepei, Sigismund Csepei, Paul B.
