A few years later, travelled to the United States to attend the aviation school in that country. Along with Miguel Garc\u00eda Granados Sol\u00eds, \u00d3scar Morales L\u00f3pez and Ricardo \"Chato\" Rodas were the aviation pioneers in Guatemala when they collected funds to buy the first airplane in the country, which they christened with the name \"Central America\".An image of the \"Central America\" can be found here: Peten culture and more: \"Central America\" plane piloted by Jacinto Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz Consultado el 5 de agosto de 2014 == First airline service in Guatemala== Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz next to American colonel Charles Lindbergh Guatemalan aviation pioneers Ricardo Rodas and Miguel Garc\u00eda Granados Sol\u00eds. In 1929, Guatemalan military aviators \u2013 led by Colonel Miguel Garc\u00eda Granados Sol\u00eds \u2013 had been able to set up a modest airline service in the country using three Ryan Brougham B-5 single engine planes that they used to transport mail and cargo to the farthest posts in Guatemala. Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz flew to El Pet\u00e9n, a region that due to its remote location, it was much easier to reach El Pet\u00e9n by plane than by land. Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz landed in Santa Elena on 20 Jul 1929, San Francisco in two occasions and La Libertad also in 1929. The first plane to land La Libertad was piloted by coronel Miguel Garc\u00eda-Granados Sol\u00eds -grandchild of former president Miguel Garc\u00eda Granados- in 1926, followed by a visit of the famous American pilot Charles Lindbergh and Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz was the third to land there in 1929. But this pioneering service did not last very long: Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz died in September 1929 in an air crash in Guatemala City, Garcia Granados left Guatemala and a French Aerial Mission arrived to Guatemala to train the military pilots of the Military Aviation Corps in warfare techniques. == Death == 28 September 1929: Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz died in an air crash. Colonel Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz died on 28 September 1929, in a tragic accident known as \"Dolores Street air crash\"', along with lawyer Jos\u00e9 Luis Balc\u00e1rcel (member of the Generation of 1920 intellectuals and classmate of future Literature Nobel Prize awardee Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias, among others), the child Carlos Montano Novella and engineer Julio Montano Novella, Guatemalan Consul in New York City. Only Julio Montano survived. Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz's tomb was designed and built by Guatemalan sculptor Rafael Yela G\u00fcnther and is in the Guatemala City General Cemetery. == Awards and recognitions == For his numerous services to his country, Colonel Rodr\u00edguez was awarded 53 medals and 15 trophies by the different army bases of the time: Fort Matamoros, Guard of Honor, Fort San Jos\u00e9 and the President's Army Staff. Colonel Rodr\u00edguez's father donated all his son's awards and trophies to the Guatemalan Military Academy after his death. == Jacinto Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz island== The Guatemalan government named a little island in his honor in San Miguel, El Pet\u00e9n. The island is situated in N 16\u00b055'59.99\" and W 89\u00b052'59.99\" and is a tourist attraction visited by those who come for the Tikal National Park and other interesting sites in that region. == See also == * Charles Lindbergh * History of Guatemala * La Aurora International Airport * L\u00e1zaro Chac\u00f3n * Military Aviation Corps of Guatemala ==Notes and references== === Notes === === References === == External links == * Category:1901 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Aviation in Guatemala Category:Guatemalan military personnel Category:People from Totonicap\u00e1n Department ",
