    "text": "Railroad Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Washington. It flows into Lake Chelan in the unincorporated community of Lucerne. Railroad Creek was so named on account it was proposed a railroad should be built near its course, however this project did not materialize. The 1946 MGM film, Courage of Lassie was shot on location here, near Holden. ==See also== *List of rivers of Washington ==References== Category:Rivers of Chelan County, Washington Category:Rivers of Washington (state) ",
