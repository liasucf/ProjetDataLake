Jan of the Lodz coat of arms (died on 14 April 1346) was bishop of Pozna\u0144 and author of sequences and antiphon.Bibliografia Literatury Polskiej \u2013 Nowy Korbut, vol.2 Pi\u015bmiennictwo Staropolskie, Pa\u0144stwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, (Warszawa 1964), p.495-496 ==Biography== He was born as the son of the wielding S\u0119dziwoja knight. On the pages of history, he appears for the first time in 1319, when as the chancellor of the Pozna\u0144 bishop he joined the delegation appointed by the papal judges, who was to hand the lawsuit against the Teutonic Knights on the trial between Poland and the Order on Gda\u0144sk Pomerania. It is known that during this process he participated in the meetings of the court in Inowroc\u0142aw and Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski. He was also included in the judgment of 1321 ending this trial as one of the witnesses. In the same period he received the post of Archdeacon of Pozna\u0144. In 1331 he was almost killed during the Teutonic military expedition to Greater Poland, when the Order's troops captured the S\u0142upca. In 1335 he received the dignity of the bishop of Pozna\u0144. As a new bishop, together with Janis\u0142aw I,Archbishop of Gniezno, he challenged the Order to the Roman Curia. During the trial in 1339, which took place in Warsaw between the Order and Poland, the defendant as a witness issued both a negative opinion on the rule of W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141okietek in Pomerania and on the crimes committed by the Teutonic Order. He gave up his claims, like the rest of the bishops, in 1343 at the conclusion of the Kalisz peace. In 1344, he started the reconstruction of the Pozna\u0144 cathedral in the Gothic style. He died on 14 April 1346 and was buried in the cathedral. ==Creativity== Several hymns have been written to our times in honor of the Mother of God and saints. Presumably, he also composed an inscription beginning with the words of Hic iacet in Tumb, engraved on the grave of Boles\u0142aw the Brave founded by one of his predecessors on the episcopal throne, Bogufa\u0142a II. According to the accounts, Bishop Jan was also a musician playing the zither. ===Musical Works=== *Salve salutis janua (sequence for the celebration of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in 16 verses),published by G.
