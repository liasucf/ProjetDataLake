Reitzenhain seen from Hirtstein Reitzenhain, former railway station on the right == Geography == Reitzenhain is located on the crest of the Ore Mountains, next to the border between Germany and the Czech republic at an altitude of ca. 778 m (station building) on the stream Schwarze Pockau. The abandoned village Pohrani\u010dn\u00ed (B\u00f6hmisch Reizenhain) is situated to its south-east, on the Czech side of the border and on the right bank of the stream. == Etymology == The name of the village is supposedly derived from a wayside inn (locally called a Han) on the nearby mountain pass, which happened to be the thirteenth inn ('Dreizehnter Han') on the road from Leipzig to Prague, counted from either end.Karl-Heinz Melzer: Wolkenstein\u2013J\u00f6hstadt\u2013Pre\u00dfnitztal. VEB Tourist Verlag, Berlin/ Leipzig, 1979, S. 61. This is also reflected by the number \"13\" (German: 'Dreizehn') in the village's coat of arms. == History == Reitzenhain was first mentioned in a document of 1401 as Reiczenstein, being a village on the border to Bohemia. In 1551 it belonged to Gro\u00dfr\u00fcckerswalde parish, in 1607 it was transferred to K\u00fchnhaide parish. Reitzenhain children also attended school in K\u00fchnhaide. Due to the strategically important location on the Reitzenhain pass, the village was frequently occupied by military forces, in particular in the Thirty Years' War and in the Seven Years' War. Until 1856 Reitzenhain belonged administratively to Amt Wolkenstein.Historisches Ortsverzeichnis Sachsen The road between Marienberg and Reitzenhain was improved to rural highway standards in the first half of the 19th century. The railway from Chemnitz to Komotau via Marienberg was opened on 23 August 1875. The volunteer fire department was founded in 1879. A schoolhouse was opened in 1882. Peat digging started in 1891. Together with the neighbouring Reizenhain on the Czech side of the border, the Reitzenhain neighbourhood of Rei\u00dfigm\u00fchle was connected to the electricity supply network in 1921. New municipal offices were inaugurated in 1924. K\u00fchnhaide was administratively joined with Reitzenhain on 1 October 1937, but became a separate municipality again on 1 April 1948. A bomb dropped on the village in February 1945 destroyed one building and killed 14 persons. After World War II the economical ties to Bohemia were interrupted, which caused a decline of the village. Reitzenhain remained a separate municipality until 31 December 1993, it then joined with K\u00fchnhaide, R\u00fcbenau, and Satzung to form the new municipality HirtsteinGemeinden 1994 und ihre Ver\u00e4nderungen seit 01.01.1948 in den neuen L\u00e4ndern, Verlag Metzler-Poeschel, Stuttgart, 1995, , Statistisches Bundesamt of which it became the administrative seat.
