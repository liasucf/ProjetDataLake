    "text": "Ulysse Chevalier (24 February 1841 - 27 October 1923) was a French bibliographer and historian. Born in Rambouillet, he published many works on the history of Dauphin\u00e9, e.g. the cartularies of the church and the town of Die (1868), of the abbey of Saint Andr\u00e9 le-Bas at Vienne (1869), of the abbey of Notre Dame at Bonnevaux in the diocese of Vienne (1889), of the abbey of Saint Chaifre at Le Monestier (1884), the inventories and several collections of archives of the dauphins of Viennais, and a Biblioth\u00e8que liturgique in six volumes (1893\u20131897), the third and fourth volumes of which constitute the Repertorium hymnologicum, containing more than 20,000 articles. Chevalier's principal work is the R\u00e9pertoire des sources historiques du moyen \u00e2ge. The first part, Bio-bibliographie (1875\u20131886), contains the names of all the historical personages alive between the years 1 and 1500 who are mentioned in printed books, together with precise references. The second part, Topo- bibliographie (1894\u20131903), contains not only the names of places mentioned in books on the history of the Middle Ages, but, in a general way, everything not included in the Bio-bibliographie. The R\u00e9pertoire as a whole is a mass of useful information, and is one of the most important bibliographical monuments ever devoted to the study of medieval history. Though a Catholic priest and professor of history at the Catholic university of Lyon, the Abb\u00e9 (afterwards Canon) Chevalier maintained an independent critical attitude even on religious questions. In the controversy on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin (sudario), he worked by tracing back the history of the cloth, which was undoubtedly used as a shroud, but he argued was not produced before the 14th century and was probably no older (Le Saint Suaire de Lirey-Chamb\u00e9ry, Turin et les d\u00e9fenseurs de son authenticit\u00e9). In 2006 French historian Emmanuel Poulle wrote in a peer-reviewed journal that Ulysse Chevalier showed in this case intellectual dishonesty. According to Poulle, Chevalier deliberately did not correctly mention the Papal bulls of antipope Clement VII issued in 1390. In fact Clement VII never opted for the forgery thesis.Emmanuel Poulle, \u00ab Le linceul de Turin victime d'Ulysse Chevalier \u00bb, Revue d'histoire de l'Eglise de France, 2006, vol. 92, n\u00b0 229, p. 343-358 In Notre Dame de Lorette. \u00c9tude critique sur l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de la Santa Casa (1906), he built his analysis on false documents, produced in the XIX century, to argue that the miraculous translation of the Santa Casa (the Holy House) was a legend. ==References== == External links == * * Category:1841 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from Rambouillet Category:19th-century French historians Category:20th-century French historians Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Category:French bibliographers Category:Researchers of the Shroud of Turin Category:French male writers ",
