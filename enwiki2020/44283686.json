    "text": "Stanis\u0142aw Kosmowski of Tr\u0105by (late 18th century, some sources cite 1752-1821) was a Polish military officer and author. In October 1776 he joined the Horse Guard of the Polish Crown Regiment as a cadet. On 1 December 1789 he was promoted to the rank of Staff Captain and in 1792 he was promoted to Captain. A member of Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko's conspiracy, he took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1794 as one of the leaders of the Polish forces, possibly as the commanding officer of his regiment. Following the Polish victory he was one of the signatories of the act of accession of the city of Warsaw to Ko\u015bciuszko's Uprising and soon afterwards became one of the members of War Council of the land of Mazovia. Promoted to the rank of Major on 18 May 1794, in July he joined the Corps of General Karol Sierakowski and distinguished himself in the battles of Krupczyce and Terespol. For his bravery on the field of battle he was awarded with the Ojczyzna Obro\u0144cy Swemu ring (number 38), the replacement for the Virtuti Militari medal abolished soon before. Wounded during the disastrous Battle of Maciejowice, he nevertheless managed to lead his forces out of the Russian encirclement and reach Warsaw, where king Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski promoted him to the rank of Colonel. In 1796 he joined General Ksawery D\u0105browski in Bucharest, hoping to gather forces and start another uprising against Austria and Russia. He served as D\u0105browski's envoy to the French ambassador to Constantinople, and to Osman Pazvanto\u011flu, the leader of rebels against the Ottoman Empire. His missions however failed to gather support for the Polish cause and eventually, after the death of Catherine II of Russia, he followed D\u0105browski to St. Petersburg, where the two were pardoned and joined Russian military service. His further fate remains unknown. He is best known as the author of memoirs, published initially in 1807 as Historia polska czyli Rys panowania Stanis\u0142awa Augusta kr\u00f3la polskiego (Polish History, that is an outline of the rule of Stanis\u0142aw August, the king of Poland). The book, republished in 1860 and again in 1870 under a new title of Pami\u0119tniki Stanis\u0142awa Kosmowskiego z ko\u0144ca XVIII wieku (Memoirs of Stanis\u0142aw Kosmowski from the end of the 18th century), is an important source on late 18th century history of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. ==References== === Citations === === Bibliography === * * Category:1752 births Category:1821 deaths Category:Polish Army officers Category:Polish memoirists ",
