It was more than 200 metres long, and consisted of four arcades whose walls were covered with \"stucco decoration studded with mirrors, and whitewashed with a special solution containing bits of mica to make them sparkle\". It was destroyed in 1842 by a British force led by General George Pollock. == References == Category:Retail markets Category:History of Kabul ",
