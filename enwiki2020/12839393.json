In 1995, Phatak was responsible for one of the first original score to be created for an Indian fashion show. He composed a score for designers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, and this was again performed at the Femina Miss India contest later in the year. ===Career=== Composer Phatak and Ghanekar formed Smoke, a music production company that created music for commercials, TV serials and films. This creative partnership lead to composing the music for films like Tamanna (1998), Bombay Boys (1998), Snip! (2000), White Noise (2004), Broken Thread (2007), MP3: Mera Pehla Pehla Pyaar (2007), The Whisperers (2009) and HELP (2010).
