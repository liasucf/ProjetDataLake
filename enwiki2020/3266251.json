    "text": "This is a list of geographic portmanteaus. Portmanteaus (also called blends) are names constructed by combining elements of two, or occasionally more, other names. For the most part, the geographic names in this list were derived from two other names or words. Those derived from three or more names are usually considered acronyms or initialisms and can be found in the List of geographic acronyms and initialisms. However, there are exceptions to this two/three rule in both lists, so it is more of a guideline than a hard-and- fast rule. Note that not all combinations of two names are considered portmanteaus. Simple concatenation of two names (whether hyphenated or not) does not produce a portmanteau. Nor does a combinative form of one name plus the full name of another (examples: Eurasia, Czechoslovakia). These kinds of names are excluded from this list. ==Regions named from their components== Some regions (including countries and provinces) have names that are portmanteaus of subregions or cities within the region. ===Countries=== * Senegambia Confederation \u2014 Senegal and The Gambia * Tanzania \u2014 Tanganyika and Zanzibar ===Chinese provinces=== Some Chinese provinces have names that are blends of their two largest cities. * Anhui \u2014 Anqing and Huizhou (now Huangshan City) * Fujian \u2014 Fuzhou and Jianzhou (now Nanping) * Gansu \u2014 Ganzhou and Suzhou * Jiangsu \u2014 Jiangning (now Nanjing) and Suzhou ===Korean provinces=== During the Joseon Kingdom, seven Korean provinces (all but the region around the capital) were named by combining the first characters of their two major cities. The provinces were reorganized in the 1890s but the names are still in use. All these traditional provincial names are carried forward by two current provinces and for all except Gangwon (which is the only one where the two carrying the name were split between North and South Korea) a North and a South province of the same name. However note that for most former provinces, the two current provinces with the name are usually not entirely coextensive with the former province. The dates of the former provinces are those when they carried that name; they often existed with a different name before that year. * Chungcheong Province \u2014 Chungju and Cheongju, former province (1356 to 1895); the name is currently carried by North Chungcheong and South Chungcheong provinces in South Korea * Gangwon Province (historical) \u2014 Gangneung and Wonju, former province (1395 to 1895); name now carried by Gangwon Province, South Korea and Kangwon Province (North Korea) * Gyeongsang Province \u2014 Gyeongju and Sangju, former province (1314\u20131895); name is currently carried by South Gyeongsang Province and North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea * Hamgyong Province \u2014 Hamhung and Kyongsong, former province (1509\u20131895); name currently carried by North Hamgyong Province and South Hamgyong Province in North Korea * Hwanghae Province \u2014 Hwangju and Haeju, former province (1395\u20131895); name carried by North Hwanghae Province and South Hwanghae Province in North Korea * Jeolla Province \u2014 Jeonju and Naju (The first character of Naju is actually \"ra\"\u2014\"r\" changes to \"n\" in the initial position, and the combination \"nr\" changes to \"ll\" due to phonological characteristics of the Korean language); now in South Korea * Pyongan Province \u2014 Pyongyang and Anju, former province (1413\u20131895), now in North Korea ===Vanuatu provinces=== Half of Vanuatu's provincial names are portmanteaus of their main islands or island groups. * Sanma Province \u2014 Espiritu Santo and Malo Island * Shefa Province \u2014 Shepherd Islands and Efate * Torba Province \u2014 Torres Islands and Banks Islands ===Merged towns=== Sometimes a portmanteau name is created from the names of predecessor towns. Names that are merely a concatenation of the predecessor names, such as Budapest, are excluded. * Beaverdell, British Columbia \u2014 Beaverton and Rendell * Brockton, Ontario \u2014 Brant, Greenock, and Walkerton * Clarington, Ontario \u2014 Clarke and Darlington, two townships * Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan \u2014 three rural municipalities: Cory No. 344, Warman No. 374 and Park No. 375 * Fairborn, Ohio \u2014 Fairfield and Osborn * Glanbrook, Hamilton, Ontario \u2014 Glanford and Binbrook * Grenola, Kansas \u2014 Green Field and Canola * Kenora, Ontario \u2014 Keewatin, Norman, and Rat Portage * Ramara, Ontario \u2014 Rama and Mara Townships * Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014 Sandown and Bryanston * Stonewood, West Virginia \u2014 Stonewall and Norwood * Temvik, North Dakota \u2014 Templeton and Larvik ===Schools and school districts=== Some school districts that serve two or three towns have names that are blends of those towns' names.
