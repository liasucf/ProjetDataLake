    "text": "Alfred Machin (20 April 1877 \u2013 16 June 1929) was a French actor and film director. He is remembered to have been one of the few French film directors whose films expressed progressive tendencies before World War I. He was also a pioneer of aerial filming. After 1920 Alfred Machin devoted himself to films of animals.George Sadoul, Dictionnaire des Cin\u00e9astes, 1965 (fr) Machin started his career as a press photographer for the magazine L'illustration. He was then recruited by the film production company Path\u00e9 which sent him in 1907 to Africa where he realised in particular a large number of short films on wild animals.Guido Convents, \u00c0 la recherche des images oubli\u00e9es. La pr\u00e9histoire du cin\u00e9ma en Afrique 1897-1918, p. 128-131 (fr) Machin was sent in 1909 by Path\u00e9 to The Netherlands to film scenes of Dutch life. In 1912, he was sent to Belgium where he took part in the creation of Path\u00e9 foreign subsidiary Belge Cin\u00e9ma Film and directed a number of films including Belgium's first feature film Le Diamant noir (:fr) and the anti-war film Maudite soit la guerre. During World War I, Machin took part in the foundation of the Photographic Service of the French Army while continuing working for Path\u00e9 which produced films for this service. He shot some scenes of the French trenches which were used by D.W. Griffith in Hearts of the WorldMachin, Alfred in Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma \u2013 Les r\u00e9alisateurs, Jean Tulard Robert Laffont, 1999 (fr) He only directed one horror film, The Manor House of Fear in 1927, which is thought to have been theatrically shown in the United States by Universal Pictures.Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\". Midnight Marquee Press. p.317. . After the war, Machin created a Film studio in Nice, to which a small zoo was attached where he kept wild animals used in his productions. He died in 1929 as a result of an injury inflicted by a panther during the shooting of a film. Machin directed 156 films, of which 32 are preserved. ==Selected filmography== Le Moulin maudit (1909) *1909: Le Moulin maudit (:fr) *1911: Le D\u00e9vouement d'un gosse (:fr) *1913: Le Diamant noir (:fr) *1914: La Fille de Delft AKA La Tulipe d'or (:fr) *1914: Maudite soit la guerre *1924: The Heirs of Uncle James *1927: The Manor House of Fear (starring Romuald Joube)Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\".
