After compiling a record of 9\u20132\u20131 (1 KO), she faced Isabel Millan (17\u20132\u20131, 8 KOs) for the WBF female flyweight title on 9 December 2016, at the Gimnasio Nuevo Le\u00f3n Unido in Monterrey, Mexico. Osorio was disqualified in the tenth and final round for repeated head butts, receiving a warning in the fifth round followed by a point deduction in the eighth before the fight was waved off. After losing three of her next four fights, she fought Maria Goreti (4\u20137) for the vacant Mexican female flyweight title on 23 June 2018 at the Sal\u00f3n Villa Flamingos in Mexico City.
