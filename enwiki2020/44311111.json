UNKO modeled after United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in Malaya; was the first indigenous party in Sabah formed to represent the interests of the Kadazandusun community in Sabah. At the time of its founding it had approximately 20,000 members. ===Breakaway of United Pasok Momogun Organisation (1962)=== The new party UNKO somehow split with a group led by G. S. Sundang going on to form the United Pasok Momogun Organisation (UPMO) in January 1962. ===Reunification and formation of United Pasokmomogun Kadazan Organisation (1963-1964)=== Upon the formation of Malaysia in 1963, UNKO entered into a Sabah Alliance coalition with the United Sabah National Organisation (USNO), a Muslim party, and the Sabah Chinese Association (SCA) to form a consociationalism new Government of Sabah; with its president Stephens became the state's first Chief Minister. In May 1964, the breakaway UPMO party, eventually reunited with its parent party. The merger saw UNKO renamed itself as the United Pasokmomogun Kadazan Organisation (UPKO) in June 1964. ===Dissolution and merger into United Sabah National Organisation (1967)=== After Stephens was forced out of the chief ministership in 1964 and became a federal minister., the party was dissolved on 28 December 1967 and absorbed into United Sabah National Organisation (USNO). ==See also== *Politics of Malaysia *List of political parties in Malaysia *Sabah Democratic Party (PDS) *United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO) (New) ==References== Category:Political parties in Sabah Category:1961 establishments in North Borneo Category:Political parties established in 1961 Category:1967 disestablishments in Malaysia Category:Political parties disestablished in 1967 Category:Defunct political parties in Malaysia Category:Indigenist political parties Category:Ethnic political parties ",
