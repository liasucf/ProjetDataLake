    "text": "In mathematics, a permutation group G acting on a non-empty finite set X is called primitive if G acts transitively on X and G preserves no nontrivial partition of X, where nontrivial partition means a partition that isn't a partition into singleton sets or partition into one set X. Otherwise, if G is transitive and G does preserve a nontrivial partition, G is called imprimitive. While primitive permutation groups are transitive by definition, not all transitive permutation groups are primitive. The requirement that a primitive group be transitive is necessary only when X is a 2-element set and the action is trivial; otherwise, the condition that G preserves no nontrivial partition implies that G is transitive. This is because for non-transitive actions either the orbits of G form a nontrivial partition preserved by G, or the group action is trivial, in which case any nontrivial partition of X (which exists for |X|\u22653) is preserved by G. This terminology was introduced by \u00c9variste Galois in his last letter, in which he used the French term \u00e9quation primitive for an equation whose Galois group is primitive. Galois' last letter: http://www.galois.ihp.fr/ressources/vie-et-oeuvre-de- galois/lettres/lettre-testament In the same letter he stated also the following theorem. If G is a primitive solvable group acting on a finite set X, then the order of X is a power of a prime number p, X may be identified with an affine space over the finite field with p elements and G acts on X as a subgroup of the affine group. An imprimitive permutation group is an example of an induced representation; examples include coset representations G/H in cases where H is not a maximal subgroup. When H is maximal, the coset representation is primitive. If the set X is finite, its cardinality is called the degree of G. The numbers of primitive groups of small degree were stated by Robert Carmichael in 1937: {| class=\"wikitable\" | Degree || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || OEIS |- | Number || 1 || 2 || 2 || 5 || 4 || 7 || 7 || 11 || 9 || 8 || 6 || 9 || 4 || 6 || 22 || 10 || 4 || 8 || 4 || 9 || 4 || 7 || 5 || |} There are a large number of primitive groups of degree 16. As Carmichael notes, all of these groups, except for the symmetric and alternating group, are subgroups of the affine group on the 4-dimensional space over the 2-element finite field. == Examples == * Consider the symmetric group S_3 acting on the set X=\\\\{1,2,3\\\\} and the permutation : \\eta=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. Both S_3 and the group generated by \\eta are primitive. * Now consider the symmetric group S_4 acting on the set \\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} and the permutation : \\sigma=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. The group generated by \\sigma is not primitive, since the partition (X_1, X_2) where X_1 = \\\\{1,3\\\\} and X_2 = \\\\{2,4\\\\} is preserved under \\sigma, i.e. \\sigma(X_1) = X_2 and \\sigma(X_2)=X_1. * Every transitive group of prime degree is primitive * The symmetric group S_n acting on the set \\\\{1,\\ldots,n\\\\} is primitive for every n and the alternating group A_n acting on the set \\\\{1,\\ldots,n\\\\} is primitive for every n > 2\\. == See also == * Block (permutation group theory) * Jordan's theorem (symmetric group) == References == * Roney-Dougal, Colva M.
