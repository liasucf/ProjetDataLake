In the 2015-2016 school year, due to complaints about the laptops being too heavy to carry, Ponca City Public Schools received a 1:1 ratio of Chromebooks for East Middle School, and Ponca City High school, and lock carts with Chromebooks at the other schools, to replace the traditional laptops used the years before. ===West Middle School=== West Middle School first opened in 1961 as West Junior High School and served grades 7,8 and 9.
