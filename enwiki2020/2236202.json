    "text": "The park entrance Dinosaur Gardens is a tourist attraction in Ossineke, Michigan, United States. Built on a tract of drained swampland, visitors to the \"zoo\" encounter several dozen home-made sculptures of dinosaurs, prehistoric birds, prehistoric mammals, and cavemen, many of which are arranged into action-packed (and often violent) scenes. The attraction, started by folk artist Paul N. Domke in the 1930s, also boasts a gift shop and a dinosaur-themed miniature golf course. A dinosaur sculpture Dinosaur Gardens is perhaps best known for its seemingly out-of-place Christian imagery. For example, visitors are greeted at the entrance by a statue of Jesus holding a globe in his left hand. One can also climb into the belly of an Apatosaurus sculpture and find a display proclaiming Jesus as \u201cThe Greatest Heart.\u201d However, such eccentricities have made the attraction a popular destination for generations of curiosity seekers. == See also == * List of dinosaur parks == External links == *Official Dinosaur Gardens website *Roadside America: Profile of Dinosaur Gardens Category:Roadside attractions in Michigan Category:Dinosaur sculptures Category:Tourist attractions in Alpena County, Michigan Category:1930s establishments in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Alpena County, Michigan ",
