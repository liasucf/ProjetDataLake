    "text": "Ghanaian Canadians are Canadians of full or partial Ghanaian ancestry. Ghanaians who became naturalized citizens of Canada preferably refer to themselves as Ghanaian Canadians. ==Overview== Ghanaians first immigrated to Canada in the 1960s. Many Ghanaians reside in the Toronto area, although quite a few can be found in other parts of Canada. Although characterized by their religious involvement, Ghanaian Canadians seem to have reservations about integrating into broader Canadian community. === Languages === Most Ghanaian Canadians speak English fluently as it is the official language of communication in Ghana. Most also speak local languages in addition to English, the most popular being Twi. Other spoken languages are Ga, Ewe, Dagbani, Nzema, Gonja, and Kasem. Ghanaians have an easier time adapting to life in Canada than other immigrants because their homeland of Ghana has the English language as the official language and it is spoken by the majority of Ghana's population. ==Notable people== ===Sports=== *Alphonso Davies *Laryea Adjetey *Richard Adu-Bobie *Ohenewa Akuffo ===Music, arts and entertainment=== *Jackie Appiah *Nana aba Duncan writer and radio host *Kae Sun, stage name of Kwaku Darko-Mensah Jnr ===Other=== *Adwoa Yamoah ==References== * Category:African Canadian Category:History of Ghana Category:Ethnic groups in Canada ",
