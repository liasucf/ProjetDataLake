There are two documented bishops of this diocese:Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, (Leipzig 1931), p. 467. Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), pp. 259\u2013260. * Vittoriano, who took part in the synod gathered in conference of 484 in Carthage that was called by the Vandal king Huneric, following which he was exiled; *Stefano (called from the Beatus sources Stephanus, spes in Deo), who intervened at the Antimonotelite Council of Carthage in 641. === Titular see === The diocese was nominally restored as titular bishopric in 1933.David M.
