They play their home games at the Hern\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez Villegas stadium. ==History== While there are several teams in the Third Division (Primera C), Pereira is the only professional team in Risaralda Department. Deportivo Pereira made its First Division debut (Primera A) in the 1949 season. Deportivo Pereira replaced Universidad, a soccer club founded in Bogot\u00e1 that had played its previous season in the 'Pearl of the Ot\u00fan River', nickname of the city of Pereira. ===Early Years=== Founded on February 12, 1944, the team played its first game at home against Universidad De Bogot\u00e1, losing 1\u20132. The team's first goal was scored by Ecuadorian player Humberto Su\u00e1rez. Its first victory was against Atl\u00e9tico Bucaramanga, with a final score of 1\u20132, and goals scored by Omar Barahona and Jos\u00e9 \u201cMico\u201d Zapata. A second victory as a visitor was obtained against Bucaramanga 3\u20134. The team's first victory playing at home was in October 9, 1949, beating Hurac\u00e1n 4\u20131, with goals scored by Carmelo Enrique Colombo, Jos\u00e9 \"Mico\" Zapata, Inocencio Paz Lasso \"Cencio\" and an own goal from Huracan's player Santos Isaza. The first top scorer of the \"Mateca\u00f1a\" (another of Pereira's nicknames) team was the Colombian Inocencio Paz Lasso \"Cencio\", with 11 goals. The team finished the season in last place with only 14 points. Deportivo Pereira has never won a Primera A championship. The team's most successful season was in 1974, where the team got third place. ===1982=== Led by Gilberto Osorio, the roster included \u00d3scar H\u00e9ctor Quintabani, \"Rat\u00f3n\" Echeverri, V\u00edctor Longo, Henry Vi\u00e1fara, Gilberto Cabrera, Farid Perchy, Sergio Cierra, Benjamin \"Mincho\" Cardona, Eduardo Emilio Vilarete, Jairo \"Chiqui\" Aguirre, and as substitutes Goalkeeper Reynel Ruiz, Midfielders Manzi and Ponciano Castro and strikers Abel Augusto Lobat\u00f3n, Hern\u00e1n \"Pistolero\" Villa and Iv\u00e1n Dar\u00edo \"Chumi\" Casta\u00f1eda. The team finished the tournament in 4th place. ===Other highlights=== In 1991, Colombia's Dimayor decided to modify the tournament so the Second Division champion would be promoted to First Division and the last team from the First Division would be demoted to Second Division. In 1995, the team got a decent sixth place that placed it comfortably far from Second Division. However, during the 1997 tournament, the team was relegated to Second Division and it had to remain in Second Division during 1998, 1999 and 2000. Led by coach Walter Aristizabal and stars like Rafael Castillo, Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo Cardona, Daniel V\u00e9lez and Jairo Serna, the team won the Second Division tournament in the year 2000, and returned to First Division. Since then, the team has reached three First Division semi-finals, and achieved fourth place during the 2003 tournament. In 2007, the team finished second to last and had to play against Academia for the Second Division's Demotion/Promotion game. Deportivo Pereira was able to keep its place in the First Division, beating Academia 4\u20132, thanks to striker \u00d3scar Restrepo. By the end of 2008, and after a splendid season, the club's democratization process was started. After several months of legal processes, the team was confirmed by the Divisi\u00f3n Mayor del F\u00fatbol Colombiano (Dimayor) and the Federaci\u00f3n Colombiana de F\u00fatbol as Deportivo Pereira SA. On November 6, 2011, Deportivo Pereira lost its First Division status by losing 1\u20130 against Deportes Tolima in Ibagu\u00e9. In the second tournament of 2012, Deportivo Pereira, under the leadership of coach Octavio Zambrano, achieved a record to get into the second half of the 2012 Categor\u00eda Primera B season with a total of 43 points out of 54 possible obtained in a single season, making it the first team to have achieved this number. However, the club missed the chance to return to the top flight in the semifinals. ==Stadium== ==Honours== *Categor\u00eda Primera B: 2 ::2000, 2019 ==Current squad== ==Notable players== * Henry Vi\u00e1fara (1973\u201383) * Luis Pompilio P\u00e1ez (1981-1988) * Abel Augusto Lobat\u00f3n (1982\u201385) * C\u00e9sar Cueto (1986) * Mauricio Serna (1990) * Eumelio Palacios (1992) * \u00d3scar D\u00edaz (1993\u201396), (1997) * Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Hern\u00e1ndez (1994) * H\u00f3lger Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez (1996\u201397) * Jes\u00fas Sinisterra (1996\u201397) * Carlos Rodas (1996\u201397) * Vidal Sanabria (1997) * Johnny Acosta (2001\u201304), (2006\u201309), (2010) * Danny Quendamb\u00fa (2002) * Ren\u00e9 Higuita (2002\u201303), (2008\u201310) * Leonel \u00c1lvarez (2002\u201303) * Jair Ben\u00edtez (2003) * Ricardo P\u00e1ez (2004) * Milton Rodr\u00edguez (2004) * Diego Arias (2004\u201309) * Gabriel G\u00f3mez (2005) * Orlando Rodr\u00edguez (2005) * Jersson Gonz\u00e1lez (2005\u201306) * Juli\u00e1n Estiven V\u00e9lez (2005\u201306) * Jorge Berm\u00fadez (2006) * Eduardo Hurtado (2007) * Carlos Quintero (2008) * Juan Mart\u00edn Parodi (2008), (2010) * Fernando Uribe (2009) * Edison Gim\u00e9nez (2009) * Edwin Tenorio (2009) * Christian Lara (2009) * Gustavo Victoria (2009\u201312) * R\u00f3binson Zapata (2011) * Freddy Grisales (2011) * Jhon Vi\u00e1fara (2011) * Jorge Br\u00edtez (2011) * Carlos Villagra (2011) * Diego Vera (2011) * Edwin Villafuerte (2012) ==Managers== * \u00d3scar H\u00e9ctor Quintabani (1990\u201392), (1995\u201396), (2009\u201310) * C\u00e9sar Maturana (1994) * Julio Comesa\u00f1a (2011) * Octavio Zambrano (2012\u201313) * Jes\u00fas Barrios (2013\u201314) * Jos\u00e9 Santa (2014) * Hern\u00e1n Alberto Lisi (2015) * N\u00e9stor Craviotto (2016) * Alberto Bulleri (2017) * Jos\u00e9 Santa (2018) * N\u00e9stor Craviotto (2019) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Orgullo Pereirano *Lobo Sur Pereira Category:Pereira, Colombia Category:Football clubs in Colombia Category:Association football clubs established in 1944 Category:1944 establishments in Colombia Category:Categor\u00eda Primera A clubs Category:Categor\u00eda Primera B clubs ",
