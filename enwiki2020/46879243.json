He is remembered as possibly the only player to play in three Grand Finals on the same day in 1985, playing in the St. George Dragons Under 23's win over Canberra Raiders before being called as a replacement during the reserve grade grand final against Parramatta Eels in which St. George Dragons also won 24-20. He was then used as a second-half replacement for Phil Ritchie during the first grade grand final. Guider went within an inch of making it 3 premierships on the day, but St. George Dragons narrowly lost the first grade grand final 7-6 to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.Rugby League Project Guider rose to captain the St. George Dragons on a number of occasions during 1986, but retired at the conclusion of that season.Alan Whitiker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 ( ==References== Category:St. George Dragons players Category:Australian rugby league players Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Rugby league hookers Category:Rugby league players from New South Wales ",
