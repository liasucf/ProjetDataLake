    "text": "The Jacob Sears Library is the public library of Dennis, Massachusetts. It is located at 23 Center Street in East Dennis, in a building funded by a bequest from Jacob Sears, a longtime East Dennis resident. The Shingle style structure was built in 1895 to a design by the Boston firm of Rand & Taylor. The library building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. ==Architecture and history== The Jacob Sears Memorial Library is set on the south side of Center Street in the village of East Dennis, just north of Massachusetts Route 6A. It is a rectangular single-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and a stone foundation. The ridge line of the roof is T shaped, with the section at the right end perpendicular to the street. This section extends to shelter the main entrance, flaring out form a portico supported by square posts and large brackets. Just to the right of the entrance is a turreted polygonal projection. Wall dormers line the front facade to the left of the entrance. The interior is divided into the primary library space at the western end, a large meeting space in the center, with backstage spaces at the far eastern end. The first library services were provided in East Dennis by a private lending association founded in 1866. Jacob Sears, a lifelong resident of East Dennis, gave funding for the construction and endowment of this library building, which was completed in 1895 to a design by the Boston firm of Rand & Taylor. The meeting hall has been used for a wide variety of civic and social functions. The building underwent a major restoration in 2005-06. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Barnstable County, Massachusetts ==References== ==External links== * Jacob Sears Library website Category:Library buildings completed in 1896 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Shingle Style architecture in Massachusetts Category:Libraries in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Public libraries in Massachusetts Category:1896 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Dennis, Massachusetts Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts ",
