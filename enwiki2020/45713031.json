She is known for her outspoken support of U.S. President Donald Trump, and various conservative and right-wing political and social causes. ==Early life== Villa was born in Orange, California. Her father Rev. Joseph Villa was an Italian-Argentine, while her mother Mildred Angela Pierce Villa was African American and had some Choctaw Native American ancestry. Her maternal great-uncle was jazz vocalist Kenny Hagood. She attended high school at Lompoc High School, and graduated in 2004.https://old- friends.co/class.php?s=17568&c;=2004https://www.classmates.com/people/Joy- Villa/8732521780 ==Entertainment career== Villa has worked as an actress and producer. From age 14 to 16, she was with Youth Network TV on Comcast Television. With the exception of Hobgoblins 2, in which she has an unspeaking background role as a candy striper, her acting career mostly consists of minor, uncredited appearances on television. These roles include an umbrella- wielding carny in the Heroes Season 4 episode \"Orientation\", and other appearances on CSI: NY, The Valley Girls and MTV Next. ===Grammy Award outfits=== Villa is known for her flamboyant outfits which she has worn to the Grammy Awards. These include: * For the 2015 Grammy Awards, she wore a see- through dress made entirely out of orange construction-fencing material, designed by Andre Soriano. The dress was called \"unusual\" and \"a first.\" * For the 2016 Grammy Awards, she wore a similarly see-through dress consisting mostly of fabric spikes. The Huffington Post named it as one of its \"Most Outrageous Looks From The 2016 Grammys.\" * At the 2017 Grammy Awards, Villa wore a blue dress, again designed by Andre Soriano, promoting President Donald Trump, featuring his campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\" and the name \"Trump\". The publicity from the dress may have helped Villa's EP I Make the Static hitting number 1 among digital downloads on Amazon.com, and iTunes in the US. It climbed up the top 100 of several other countries' iTunes charts too, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil. The album sold over 15,000 copies in the following two days, and debuted on the Billboard charts the next week at number 12 with 29,000 album equivalent units, 27,000 of which were pure album sales. The EP also ranked number 2 on the Digital Albums chart and number 6 on the Top Album Sales chart, as well as being the top-selling rock/alternative album of the week. * At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Villa wore a white dress with a hand-painted fetus inside of a rainbow uterus on it along with a purse bearing the slogan, \"Choose Life.\" *At the 2019 Grammy Awards, Villa wore a reflective silver dress with a black outline of bricks all around except for an area with \"Build the Wall\" spelled out in red in a large section on the backside of the garment, borrowing the font of Pink Floyd's The Wall. She also wore a metallic collar signifying a barbed wire fence, a spiked crown referencing the Statue of Liberty, and sported a red \"Make America Great Again\" handbag. *At the 2020 Grammy Awards, she wore a red, white and blue pro-Trump dress that said \"impeached and re-elected\" on the back. ==Political views and career== Villa is a supporter of Donald Trump, having joined Donald Trump's Campaign Advisory Board.
