    "text": "The Madrid\u2013Hendaye railway, also known as the Madrid-Ir\u00fan railway, General del Norte Line or Imperial Line, is a 641.6 km railway line linking the Spanish capital of Madrid with the French border at Ir\u00fan and Hendaye, serving important northern Spanish cities including San Sebasti\u00e1n, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Valladolid. ==Services== The line is used by the Cercan\u00edas San Sebasti\u00e1n commuter rail line between San Sebasti\u00e1n and Ir\u00fan, and Cercan\u00edas Madrid lines C-3, C-8 and C-10. Direct Madrid to Irun services often use the Madrid\u2013Le\u00f3n high-speed rail line between Madrid and Valladolid-Campo Grande and switching to the Madrid-Hendaye line for the rest of the journey as Alvia services. Various Renfe Media Distancia services operate on different stretches of track, mostly in Castile and Le\u00f3n, and an Intercity service operates between A Coru\u00f1a and Hendaye. The mostly single-track Casetas\u2013Bilbao railway to Bilbao- Abando forms a junction with the Madrid\u2013Hendaye route at Miranda de Ebro. At Venta de Ba\u00f1os, the line to Gij\u00f3n begins. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Spain Category:Railway lines opened in 1864 Category:Iberian gauge railways ",
