Its main image is a statue of Shaka Ny\u014drai. ==History== The temple claims to have been founded in the Hakuchi era of the Nara period, and was originally a Tendai sect temple. It was converted to the Rinzai school by the monk Enni in 1262 AD. The temple flourished during the Muromachi period and was named one of the Jissetsu temples in 1343. It is where Ashikaga Takauji and Imagawa Yoshimoto took the tonsure. In the Sengoku period, when the young Tokugawa Ieyasu was held hostage in Sunpu by the Imagawa clan, he was sent to Seiken-ji to be tutored by Sessai Ch\u014dr\u014d. During the invasion of Suruga Province by the Takeda clan, Imagawa Ujizane established his headquarters at this temple. During the Edo period, the temple continued to flourish due to its connection with Tokugawa Ieyasu, and its location on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway linking Edo with Kyoto. It was selected by the Tokugawa shogunate as one of the lodging spots for the Joseon missions to Japan and the delegations from the Ryukyu Kingdom. Due to this connection it was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1994. During the early Meiji period, the tracks of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line railway were laid across the front of the temple, which lost much of its properties. However, due to its scenic location overlooking Suruga Bay, the temple drew the attention of poets and writers, including Shimazaki T\u014dson, Takayama Chogy\u016b and Natsume S\u014dseki. Surviving Edo period structures include the Sanmon (1651) and entrance to the Main Hall (1616). ==Cultural properties== ===National Important Cultural Properties=== ====Diary of Ye Mengde==== Diary of Ye Mengde (; 1077\u20131148), a Song dynasty Chinese scholar, poet, and government minister, dated summer of 1149 AD ===National Place of Scenic Beauty=== ==== Seiken-ji gardens==== The Japanese garden at Seiken-ji dates from the early Edo period and contains ponds and tree arrangements.
