    "text": "Henry Albert Fannin (25 September 1870 \u2013 20 January 1959) was a cricketer who played 11 matches of first-class cricket for Hawke's Bay between 1892 and 1899. A fast bowler, Fannin had an outstanding season in 1897-98 when he took 22 wickets in two matches. Against Taranaki in December 1897 he took 8 for 49 (including a hat-trick) and 3 for 42 in an innings victory for Hawke's Bay. Nine of his victims were bowled. In Hawke's Bay's next match the following March, getting movement each way off the pitch, he took 8 for 19 (all bowled) and 3 for 35 against Auckland in a drawn match. In July 1900 Fannin's employers, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, transferred him from Napier to Feilding. In a tribute, the Hastings Standard called him \"one of the most good-natured and unselfish fellows who ever slogged a boundary or knocked a stump out of the ground\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1870 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Cricketers from Napier, New Zealand Category:Hawke's Bay cricketers ",
