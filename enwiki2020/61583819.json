The tour consisted of three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs), which formed part of the 2017\u201320 ICC Women's Championship, and three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches. The first fixture of the tour, at the Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua, was the Australia's first ever WODI match in the Caribbean. Australia won the WODI series 3\u20130, their fifth- consecutive series sweep and their fifteenth win in WODIs in a row.
