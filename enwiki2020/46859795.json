Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars, saying, \"The album starts in scattered fashion with some neo- reggae, a retro-modern midtempo groove that evokes breakbeat-driven early-'90s productions, and a church-ified ballad. After those three songs, the album stabilizes, sliding between a number of plush ballads and sophisticated but bumping slow jams. Heartache prevails during the first half and crests with 'Never,' an authoritative and elegantly paced kiss-off of an inappreciative lover. The latter half is mostly about devotion and awe, while the back-to- back 'Love It' (all booming bass, tapping keyboards, and rattling percussion) and 'Must Be Good to You' (light and springy disco-funk) turn it up several degrees with Braxton offering firm declarations of her sexual power.\" ==Track listing== ;Notes * signifies a co-producer * signifies a vocal producer ;Sample credits * \"Never\" contains an interpolation of \"I'm Dancing For Your Love\", written by Patricia Austin, Peggy Lipton Jones, John Robertson and David James Wolinski. * \"I Love You\" contains a portion of the composition \"If Only for One Night\", written by Brenda Gordon Russell. * \"Let Me Know\" samples \"(At Your Best) You Are Love\" performed by Aaliyah, written by Ronald Isley, Ernie Isley, Rudolph Isley, O'Kelly Isley, Jr. and Chris Jasper. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from AllMusic. ; Performers and musicians *Tamar Braxton - Vocals, Background *Tiyon \"TC\" Mack - Vocals, Background ; Technical personnel *Tamar Braxton - Composer, Producer, Creative Director, *Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid Executive Producer *Vincent Herbert - A&R;, Executive Producer *LaShawn Daniels - A&R;, Composer *Ramahn \"Jer-Z\" Herbert - A&R; *Ashley Fox - Creative Director *Anita Marisa Boriboon - Art Direction, Creative Director, Design *Theo \"MasBeatz\" Edmonds - Producer *The Underdogs - Composer, Producer *Rivelino Raoul Wouter - Producer *Blair Taylor - Producer *Afro Steve - Producer *Cedric \"DaBenchWarma\" Smith - Producer *Polow da Don - Producer *Brian Alexander Morgan - Bass, Composer, Drum Programming, Keyboards, Producer *Mel & Mus - Producer *Melvin Hough - Producer *Gerald Haddon -Producer *John Henry Gordon - Producer *Tiffany Fred - Composer, Producer *Leigh Elliott - Producer *Da Internz - Producer *Brandon Bell - Composer, Producer *Blac Elvis - Producer *Alessandro Calemme - Producer *Khari Cain - Composer, Producer *Darhyl \"DJ\" Camper Jr. - Composer, Producer *Tiyon Mack - Composer, Mixing, Vocal Engineer, *Keon Young - Composer *David James Wolinski - Composer *Dewain Whitmore, Jr. - Composer *Isaac White - Composer *Kristal \"Brave Jaxon\" Murphy *Atozzio Towns - Composer *Damon Thomas - Composer *Amber Streeter - Composer *Patrick \"J Que\" Smith - Composer *Edsel Alexander - Composer *Makeba Riddick - Composer *Tony Russell - Composer *Muhammad Ayers - Composer *Brenda Russell Composer *Marcos Palacios - Composer *Vurdell Muller - Composer *McKenzie Brooke Lawson - Composer *Sherita Lowery - Composer *Kevin Randolph - Composer *Peggy Lipton Jones - Composer *Denisia Keys - Composer *Claude Kelly - Composer *Jamal Jones - Composer *Andrew Hey - Engineer, Guitar *Patricia Austin - Composer *Timothy Paul Hinshaw - Composer *Atia Boggs - Composer *Courtney Harrell - Composer *Anthony D.
