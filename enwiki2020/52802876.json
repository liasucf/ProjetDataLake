The start boxes and parts of the median strip (spina) with an obelisk on it are still visible. Each end of the course is marked by still existing stone turning posts (metae). Charioteers had to make this circuit seven times. Rounding the metae at top speed was the most dangerous part of the race and often produced spectacular spills. == Tyrian Games == Although primarily meant for chariot races, the hippodrome was also used for other types of sport, and it is likely that at least some of the events of the Tyrian Games were celebrated at this place. It may have been the place where, during the Diocletianic Persecution, Christians were tortured to death.The Tyre Hippodrome File:TyreHippodrome1.jpg|Turning post and median strip with obelisk File:TyreHippodrome2.jpg|The start boxes File:Roman Hippodrome Arch - Tyre Lebanon.JPG|Arch below the hippodrome seats ==References== Category:Tyre, Lebanon Category:Ancient Roman circuses Category:Roman sites in Lebanon Category:Archaeological sites in Lebanon Category:Horse racing venues in Lebanon ",
