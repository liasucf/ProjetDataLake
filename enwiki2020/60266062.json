Wallace travelled widely, to Italy and India in 1887, the latter resulting in a book India in 1887 in which he examined livestock farming and agriculture in India. Wallace travelled to India in an unofficial capacity, with a special interest in livestock. He took numerous photographs and several notes were published in scholarly societies. Communicating with Thomas Henry Huxley, he speculated on the skin colours of Indian cattle, commenting that they were predominantly dark skinned and suggested that they may have been selected for the same underlying but unexplained mechanism leading to darker human skin colour in the tropics. He travelled to the United States thrice between 1890 and 1898 with trips to Egypt (1891), Greece (1892) and South Africa (1895) in the same period.
