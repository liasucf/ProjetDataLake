    "text": "Didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) is an antiseptic/disinfectant that is used in many biocidal applications. It causes disruption of intermolecular interactions and dissociation of lipid bilayers. It is a broad spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal and can be used as disinfectant cleaner for linen, recommended for use in hospitals, hotels and industries. It is also used in gynaecology, surgery, ophthalmology, pediatrics, OT, and for the sterilization of surgical instruments, endoscopes and surface disinfection. In mice this disinfectant was found to cause infertility and birth defects when combined with Alkyl (60% C14, 25% C12, 15% C16) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC),. These studies contradict the older toxicology data set on quaternary ammonia compounds which was reviewed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the EU Commission. ==See also== * Dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride \u2013 longer di-C18 analogue ==References== Category:Antiseptics Category:Quaternary ammonium compounds Category:Chlorides Category:Cationic surfactants ",
