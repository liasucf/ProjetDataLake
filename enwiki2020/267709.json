    "text": "Milan Linate Airport is the third international airport of Milan, the second- largest city and largest urban area of Italy, behind Malpensa Airport and Orio al Serio Airport. It served 9,233,475 passengers in 2018, being the fifth busiest airport in Italy, and is used as a base by Alitalia and Alitalia CityLiner. ==History== The airport was built next to Idroscalo of Milan in the 1930s when Taliedo Airport (located from the southern border of Milan), and one of the world's first aerodromes and airports, became too small for commercial traffic. Linate was completely rebuilt in the 1950s and again in the 1980s. Its name comes from the small village where it is located in the town of Peschiera Borromeo. Its official name is Airport Enrico Forlanini, after the Italian inventor and aeronautical pioneer born in Milan. Linate airport buildings are located in the Segrate Municipality, and the field is located for a large part in the Peschiera Borromeo Municipality. Since 2001, because of Linate's close proximity to the centre of Milan \u2013 only east of the city centre, compared with Malpensa, which is 41 km (25 mi) northwest of the city centre \u2013 its capacity has been reduced by law from 32 slots per hour (technical capacity) down to 22 slots per hour (politically decided capacity) and only domestic or international flights within the EU have been allowed. That year, 2001, also saw a major accident at Linate with many illegal and non-ICAO-regulation practices and layouts part of its then operation. From 27 July to 27 October 2019, Linate was closed for runway resurfacing and terminal upgrades. The latter project is expected to continue after the airport's reopening, concluding some time in 2021. During this closure, most flights were rerouted to Malpensa, displacing approximately 2.5 million passengers. ==Facilities== Linate Airport features one three-story passenger terminal building. The ground level contains the check-in and separate baggage reclaim facilities as well as service counters and a secondary departure gate area for bus-boarding. The first floor features the main departure area with several shops, restaurants and service facilities. The second floor is used for office space.milanolinate-airport.com \u2013 Maps retrieved 23 June 2015 The terminal building features five aircraft stands, all of which are equipped with jet- bridges. Several more parking positions are available on the apron which are reached from several bus-boarding gates. ==Airlines and destinations== The following airlines operate scheduled services to and from Linate Airport:Milano Linate: Destinations ==Statistics== Aerial view Check-in area Linate airport in the 1930s {| | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font- size: 100%\" |+Busiest domestic routes from Linate (2017) |- !
