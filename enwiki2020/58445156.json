    "text": "Erik Satie The Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies (Four Little Songs) is a 1920 song cycle for voice and piano by French composer Erik Satie. It is most notable for its opening lament, \u00c9l\u00e9gie, which Satie composed in memory of his friend Claude Debussy. A typical performance lasts under 4 minutes. ==Background== Claude Debussy In the autumn of 1920, Henry Pruni\u00e8res, founder-editor of the monthly music journal La Revue musicale, announced he would publish a commemorative edition of his magazine to honor the legacy of Claude Debussy, who had died in 1918. It would include a memorial supplement, Le Tombeau de Claude Debussy,In French the term tombeau, derived from the words \"tomb\" or \"tombstone\", is a musical composition commemorating the death of a notable individual. a collective musical tribute for which Pruni\u00e8res invited Europe's leading composers to contribute. Ten musicians responded with either newly- written pieces or excerpts from their current works in progress: Paul Dukas, Albert Roussel, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Eugene Goossens, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Florent Schmitt, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and Erik Satie. For Satie the commission was an opportunity to address an unhealed wound. Debussy was probably the closest friend he ever had.Louis Laloy, \"La Musique retrouv\u00e9e\", Librairie Plon, Paris, 1928, pp. 258-259. He once wrote, \"From the moment I saw [Debussy] for the first time, I was drawn to him and wanted to live constantly at his side\".Ornella Volta (ed.), \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 144. But both were difficult men and their relations grew strained in the 1910s, as Satie emerged from decades of obscurity as a composer while the world-famous Debussy was tormented by a long battle with cancer. After Debussy bitterly teased Satie during rehearsals of the latter's breakthrough ballet Parade in March 1917, Satie ended their friendship once and for all. When Debussy died the following year, Satie did not attend his funeral.Volta, \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", pp. 148-149. But the loss had a profound impact on him. Years later he would jot down in one of his private notebooks, \"When all is said and done, the good Debussy was more than all the others put together\".Volta, \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", p. 149. Satie completed his musical eulogy to Debussy, an \u00c9l\u00e9gie for voice and piano, on September 27, 1920,Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 321. dedicating it \"In memory of an admiring and tender friendship of thirty years\".Pierre-Daniel Templier, Erik Satie, MIT Press, 1969, p. 104. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. It was first published as part of the Le Tombeau de Claude Debussy supplement in the December 1920 issue of La Revue musicale, with a frontispiece created by Raoul Dufy. Pruni\u00e8res said in his introduction, \"This international tribute to the memory of Debussy will be a real 'monument' like those that Renaissance poets raised to the artists they had loved\".\"A Special Night in French Music\", France Musique, March 25, 2018. At https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=fr&u;=https://www.francemusique.fr/emissions/nuit- speciale-france-musique/claude-debussy-raconte-par-francis-poulenc-et-compose- par-paul-dukas-bela-bartok-maurice-ravel-60063&prev;=search In the meantime, Satie decided to use the \u00c9l\u00e9gie as the cornerstone of a full-fledged cycle of m\u00e9lodies (French art songs). He composed three additional songs between October and December 1920 to comprise the Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", pp. 321-322. ==Songs== The definitive version of the Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies is set to verses by four French authors spanning two centuries. Alphonse de Lamartine 1\\. \u00c9l\u00e9gie (Elegy), poem by Alphonse de Lamartine :- D\u00e9clame (with emphasis) Satie's very personal lament for Debussy is set to stanza 7 of Lamartine's 1820 poem L'Isolement (Isolation).Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 321. :What to me are these valleys, these palaces, these cottages :Vain objects from which for me all charm has been taken away? :Rivers, rocks, forests, solitude so dear :A single being is lacking and everything is emptyQuoted in Volta, \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", p. 149. Robert Orledge observed that in the \u00c9l\u00e9gie \"Satie for once brings his inner emotions to the surface in a wide-ranging vocal line of almost exaggerated expressiveness\".Orledge, Satie the Composer, p. 39. With its anguished prosody and desolate, tonally ambiguous piano part it is almost unique in Satie's vocal music, comparable only to his 1893 song Bonjour Biqui, Bonjour!. The latter was similarly inspired by an emotional upheaval in the composer's life.Satie's brief, stormy affair with the painter Suzanne Valadon. Jean Cocteau 2\\. Danseuse (Ballerina), poem by Jean Cocteau :- Non vif (not too lively) Cocteau's poem is a bit of satirical nonsense in which an opera dancer is likened to a crab. An angular, tiptoeing piano accompaniment subtly nails the comparison, suggesting both the sideways movement of the crustacean and en pointe dance technique. The implications of the absurd text would certainly have attracted Satie. He had strong opinions about ballet performers, whom he believed cared only about themselves and for creating \"spectacular effects that will bring applause\";Quoted in Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 230. and in private correspondence he referred to his frequent collaborator, choreographer L\u00e9onide Massine, as \"very stupid...and very much a dancer\".Volta, \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", p. 162. Satie also loved seafood and had depicted a crab being devoured by an octopus in an earlier composition, La Pieuvre from the piano suite Sports et divertissements (1914). 18th Century illustration of carousing in a French tavern 3\\. Chanson (Song), poem by anonymous 18th Century French author :- Assez lent (moderately slow) Dating from pre-revolutionary France of the 1700s, the text is a libertine drinking song (chanson \u00e0 boire) rife with double-entendres: :It's my treasure, it's my jewel :The pretty hole through which :My vigor wakes up :Yes, I'm crazy, crazy, crazy :About the hole of my bottleEnglish summary of original French text on IMSLP at https://imslp.org/wiki/4_Petites_m%C3%A9lodies_(Satie%2C_Erik) Satie - himself no stranger to alcohol - playfully crafted the vocal line to emulate the slurred speech of an inebriate. After the line \"My vigor wakes up\" the music stumbles into a brief pause, then shakily resumes. Raymond Radiguet 4\\. Adieu (Farewell), poem by Raymond Radiguet :- Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 (moderately) In 1920 Radiguet was the 17 year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jean Cocteau, long before achieving independent success with his precocious first novel, Le Diable au corps (1923). His contribution to the Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies was an unpublished quatrain originally entitled Mouchoir (Handkerchief). It would appear in his posthumous poetry collection Les Joues en feu (1925).Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 322. A slightly-skewed waltz rhythm underlines the poet taking an old admiral to task for waving a white handkerchief in a gesture of farewell. Radiguet's final verses - :It is the custom to hunt :The flies of the pastEnglish summary of original French text on IMSLP at https://imslp.org/wiki/4_Petites_m%C3%A9lodies_(Satie%2C_Erik) \\- provide a thematic throwback to the opening \u00c9l\u00e9gie and close the cycle with melancholy irony. ==Publication and performance== Early promotion of the Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies reflected the piecemeal nature of its composition. Following the original publication of \u00c9l\u00e9gie in the La Revue musicale supplement, Satie's Chanson, retitled Chanson \u00e0 boire, appeared in facsimile in the 1921 edition of the Parisian Almanach de Cocagne (Cockaigne Almanac). This was an annual publication \"dedicated to true gourmets and serious drinkers\" edited by Satie's friend, culinary historian Bertrand Gu\u00e9gan.Gu\u00e9gan's Almanach de Cocagne appeared annually from 1920 to 1922. Along with classic recipes it featured essays, artwork and even music scores from prominent French creative figures. For the 1920 edition Satie contributed a Marche de Cocagne for two trumpets, which became the basis of his orchestral suite Trois petites pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es.Bertrand Gu\u00e9gan (1892-1943) was an editor for the publisher \u00c9ditions de la Sir\u00e8ne, which had Satie under exclusive contract in the early 1920s. His notable culinary works include La Fleur de la Cuisine Fran\u00e7aise (2 volumes, 1921), a collection of French recipes ranging from the 13th Century to the modern era; the first French translation of the Ancient Roman cookbook Apicius (1933), for which the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise awarded him the 1934 Prix Langlois; and Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ais (1934). He also edited a critical edition of Moli\u00e8re (7 volumes, 1925-1929). During World War II Gu\u00e9gan took part in the French Resistance and was executed by the Nazis. See http://data.bnf.fr/11906122/bertrand_guegan/ All four songs were published by \u00c9ditions de la Sir\u00e8ne in 1922, and subsequently reissued by Eschig.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 322. Mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori and pianist Andr\u00e9 Salomon gave the first public performance of \u00c9l\u00e9gie at the Galerie la Bo\u00e9tie in Paris on December 19, 1920. Pierre Bertin premiered the complete cycle at the Galerie Georges Giroux in Brussels, Belgium, on April 12, 1921.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 322. The Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies stands as one of Satie's more obscure compositions. Biographer Rollo H. Myers (1948) found the \u00c9l\u00e9gie \"somewhat disconcerting\" and felt it did not \"quite 'come off'\"; he concluded, \"At all events it cannot be said that there is any attempt here to imitate Debussy's style\".Rollo H. Myers, Erik Satie, Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, pp. 95-96. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. And Patrick Gowers, writing for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1980, claimed the cycle was \"less individual\" than Satie's other forays in m\u00e9lodies.Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \"Erik Satie\", \"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 142. Reprinted from \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", 1980 edition. For his part Satie remained fond of the work. On his deathbed in 1925 he told his young admirer Robert Caby, \"If you want to learn something about me, look carefully at the Quatre petites m\u00e9lodies. They are very different, aren't they?\"Robert Caby, interview with Robert Orledge, Paris, September 13, 1986. Published by Orledge in his book Satie Remembered, Faber and Faber Ltd., London, 1995, p. 208. ==Discography== Nicolai Gedda and Aldo Ciccolini (La Voix De Son Ma\u00eetre, 1970), Marianne Kweksilber and Reinbert de Leeuw (Harlekijn, 1976, reissued by Philips, 1980), Merielle and Peter Dickinson (Unicorn, 1976), Bruno Laplante and Marc Durand (Calliope, 1985), Rainer Pachner and Ramon Walter (Aurophon, 1988), Eileen Hulse and Robin Bowman (Factory Classical, 1990), Jane Manning and Bojan Gori\u0161ek (Audiophile Classics, 1996). ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Complete score at IMSLP, at https://imslp.org/wiki/4_Petites_m%C3%A9lodies_(Satie%2C_Erik) * * * * Category:Classical song cycles in French Category:Song cycles by Erik Satie Category:20th-century classical music Category:1920 compositions Category:M\u00e9lodies ",
