    "text": "Madeline Helen Arakawa Gins (November 7, 1941 \u2013 January 8, 2014) was an American artist, architect and poet. ==Life== Gins was born in New York City and studied physics and Eastern philosophy at Barnard College. Gins met her partner and later husband, artist Shusaku Arakawa, in 1963. One of their earlier collaborations, \"The Mechanism of Meaning\", was shown in its entirety at the 1997 Guggenheim exhibition, Arakawa/Gins \u2013 Reversible Destiny/We Have Decided Not to Die. In 1987, as a means of financing the design and construction of works of architecture (that draw on The Mechanism of Meaning), Arakawa and Gins founded the Reversible Destiny Foundation. The Foundation actively collaborates with practitioners in a wide range of disciplines including, experimental biology, neuroscience, quantum physics, experimental phenomenology, and medicine. Their architectural projects included residences (Bioscleave House (Lifespan Extending Villa), Reversible Destiny Lofts (In memory of Helen Keller) \u2013 Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan), parks (Site of Reversible Destiny-Yoro) and plans for housing complexes and neighborhoods (Reversible Destiny Fun House, BOOM-LGBT Community, Isle of Reversible Destiny-Venice and Isle of Reversible Destiny-Fukuoka, Sensorium City, Tokyo). She and Arakawa \"lost their life savings\" to the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme. ==Death== On March 18, 2010, Arakawa died, after a week of hospitalization. Gins would not state the cause of death. \"This mortality thing is bad news,\" she stated. She planned to redouble efforts to prove \"aging can be outlawed.\" On January 8, 2014, Gins died of cancer at age 72.\"Madeline Arakawa Gins, Visionary Architect, Dies at 72\", The New York Times, January 12, 2014. Retrieved January 23, 2014. ==Reversible Destiny Foundation== Arakawa and Gins cofounded the Reversible Destiny Foundation, an organization dedicated to the use of architecture to extend the human lifespan. They have co-authored books, including Reversible Destiny, which is the catalogue of their Guggenheim exhibition, Architectural Body (University of Alabama Press, 2002), and Making Dying Illegal (New York: Roof Books, 2006), and have designed and built residences and parks, including the Reversible Destiny Lofts, Bioscleave House, and the Site of Reversible Destiny\u2013Yoro. ==Works== ===Architectural works by Arakawa and Gins=== *\"UBIQUITOUS SITE, NAGI'S RYOANJI, Architectural Body (Nagi, Okayama, Japan, 1994, Nagi Museum Of Contemporary Art) *\"Site of Reversible Destiny \u2013 Yoro Park (Y\u014dr\u014d, Gifu, Japan, 1995) *\"Shidami Resource Recycling Model House (Nagoya, Japan, 2005) *\"the Reversible Destiny Lofts MITAKA \u2013 In Memory of Helen Keller (Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan 2005) *\"Bioscleave house \u2013 LIFESPAN EXTENDING VILLA (Northwest Harbor, East Hampton, Long Island, NY, 2008) *\"Biotopological Scale-Juggling Escalator (NYC, 2013/Dover Street Market, New York, NY, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons) ===Books by Arakawa and Gins=== *The Saddest Thing Is That I Have Had To Use My Words.
