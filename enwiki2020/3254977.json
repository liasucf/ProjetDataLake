    "text": "Polish orthography is the system of writing the Polish language. The language is written using the Polish alphabet, which derives from the Latin alphabet, but includes some additional letters with diacritics. The orthography is mostly phonetic, or rather phonemic \u2013 the written letters (or combinations of them) correspond in a consistent manner to the sounds, or rather the phonemes, of spoken Polish. For detailed information about the system of phonemes, see Polish phonology. ==Polish alphabet== The diacritics used in the Polish alphabet are the kreska (graphically similar to the acute accent) in the letters \u0107, \u0144, \u00f3, \u015b, \u017a; the kreska uko\u015bna (stroke) in the letter \u0142; the kropka (overdot) in the letter \u017c; and the ogonek (\"little tail\") in the letters \u0105, \u0119. There are 35 lettershttps://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/Q-V-X;10937.html in the Polish alphabet: 9 vowels and 26 consonants. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Polish alphabet, bold letters are only used for loanwords |- | colspan=\"35\" bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\" |Majuscule forms (also called uppercase or capital letters) |- | width=\"15\" |A || width=\"15\" |\u0104 || width=\"15\" |B || width=\"15\" |C || width=\"15\" |\u0106 || width=\"15\" |D || width=\"15\" |E || width=\"15\" |\u0118 | width=\"15\" |F || width=\"15\" |G || width=\"15\" |H || width=\"15\" |I || width=\"15\" |J || width=\"15\" |K || width=\"15\" |L || width=\"15\" |\u0141 | width=\"15\" |M || width=\"15\" |N || width=\"15\" |\u0143 || width=\"15\" |O || width=\"15\" |\u00d3 || width=\"15\" |P || width=\"15\" |Q || width=\"15\" |R || width=\"15\" |S | width=\"15\" |\u015a || width=\"15\" |T || width=\"15\" |U || width=\"15\" |V || width=\"15\" |W || width=\"15\" |X || width=\"15\" |Y || width=\"15\" |Z || width=\"15\" |\u0179 || width=\"15\" |\u017b |- | colspan=\"35\" bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\" |Minuscule forms (also called lowercase or small letters) |- |a ||\u0105 ||b ||c ||\u0107 ||d ||e ||\u0119 |f ||g ||h ||i ||j ||k ||l ||\u0142 |m ||n ||\u0144 ||o ||\u00f3 ||p ||q ||r ||s |\u015b ||t ||u ||v ||w ||x ||y ||z ||\u017a ||\u017c |- | colspan=\"35\" bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\" |Name of Letters |- |a ||\u0105 ||be ||ce ||cie ||de ||e ||\u0119 |ef ||gie ||ha ||i ||jot ||ka ||el ||e\u0142 |em ||en ||e\u0144 ||o ||o kreskowane ||pe ||ku ||er ||es |e\u015b ||te ||u ||fau ||wu ||iks ||igrek ||zet ||ziet ||\u017cet |} The Polish alphabet. Grey indicates letters not used in native words. The letters q (named ku), v (named fau or rarely we), and x (named iks) are used in some foreign words and commercial names. In loanwords they are often replaced by kw, w, and (ks or gz), respectively (as in kwarc \"quartz\", weranda \"veranda\", ekstra \"extra\", egzosfera, \"exosphere\"). When giving the spelling of words, certain letters may be said in more emphatic ways to distinguish them from other identically pronounced characters. For example, H may be referred to as samo h (\"h alone\") to distinguish it from CH (ce ha). The letter \u017b may be called \"\u017cet (or zet) z kropk\u0105\" (\"\u017b with a dot\") to distinguish it from RZ (er zet). The letter U may be called u otwarte (\"open u\", a reference to its graphical form) or u zwyk\u0142e (\"regular u\"), to distinguish it from \u00d3, which is sometimes called \u00f3 zamkni\u0119te (\"closed \u00f3\"), \u00f3 kreskowane or \u00f3 z kresk\u0105 (\"\u00f3 with a stroke accent\"), alternatively o kreskowane or o z kresk\u0105 (\"o with a stroke accent\"). The letter \u00f3 is a relic from hundreds of years ago when there was a length distinction in Polish similar to that in Czech, with \u00e1 and \u00e9 also being common at the time. Subsequently, the length distinction disappeared and \u00e1 and \u00e9 were abolished, but \u00f3 came to be pronounced the same as u. Note that Polish letters with diacritics are treated as fully independent letters in alphabetical ordering (unlike in languages such as French and Spanish). For example, by\u0107 comes after bycie. The diacritic letters also have their own sections in dictionaries (words beginning with \u0107 are not usually listed under c). However, there are no regular words that begin with \u0105 or \u0144. ===Digraphs=== Polish additionally uses the digraphs ch, cz, dz, d\u017a, d\u017c, rz, and sz. Combinations of certain consonants with the letter i before a vowel can be considered digraphs: ci as a positional variant of \u0107, si as a positional variant of \u015b, zi as a positional variant of \u017a, and ni as a positional variant of \u0144 (but see a special remark on ni below); and there is also one trigraph dzi as a positional variant of d\u017a. These are not given any special treatment in alphabetical ordering. For example, ch is treated simply as c followed by h, and not as a single letter as in Czech or Slovak (e.g. Chojnice has only first letter capitalized and will be sorted before Cybina). ==Spelling rules== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Vowels |- !Grapheme !Usual value !Other values |- |a | | |- |\u0105 | |, , ; merges with before (see below) |- |e | | |- |\u0119 | |, , ; merges with before and often word-finally (see below) |- |i | | before a vowel; marks palatalization of the preceding consonant before a vowel (see below) |- |o | | |- |\u00f3 |rowspan=2| | |- |u | after vowels |- |y | | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Consonants |- !Grapheme !Usual value !Voiced or devoiced |- |b | | if devoiced |- |c | | if voiced |- |\u0107 | | if voiced |- |cz | | if voiced |- |d | | if devoiced |- |dz | | if devoiced |- |d\u017a | | if devoiced |- |d\u017c | | if devoiced |- |f | | if voiced |- |g | | if devoiced |- |h |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| if voiced |- |ch |- |j | | |- |k | | if voiced |- |l | | |- |\u0142 | | |- |m | | |- |n | | |- |\u0144 | | |- |p | | if voiced |- |r | | |- |s | | if voiced |- |\u015b | | if voiced |- |sz | | if voiced |- |t | | if voiced |- |w | | if devoiced |- |z | | if devoiced |- |\u017a | | if devoiced |- |\u017c |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| if devoiced |- |rz |} See below for rules regarding spelling of alveolo-palatal consonants. H may be glottal in a small number of dialects. Rarely, isn't a digraph and represents two separate sounds: * in various forms of the verb zamarza\u0107 - \"to freeze\" * in various forms of the verb mierzi\u0107 - \"to disgust\" * in the place name Murzasichle * in borrowings, for example erzac (from German Ersatz), Tarzan ===Voicing and devoicing=== Voiced consonant letters frequently come to represent voiceless sounds (as shown in the above tables). This is due to the neutralization that occurs at the end of words and in certain consonant clusters; for example, the in klub (\"club\") is pronounced like a , and the in prze- sounds like . Less frequently, voiceless consonant letters can represent voiced sounds; for example, the in tak\u017ce (\"also\") is pronounced like a . The conditions for this neutralization are described under Voicing and devoicing in the article on Polish phonology. ===Palatal and palatalized consonants=== The spelling rule for the alveolo- palatal sounds , , , and is as follows: before the vowel the plain letters are used; before other vowels the combinations are used; when not followed by a vowel the diacritic forms are used. For example, the in siwy (\"grey-haired\"), the in siarka (\"sulphur\") and the in \u015bwi\u0119ty (\"holy\") all represent the sound . {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Sound !Word-finally or before a consonant !Before a vowel other than !Before |- | |\u0107 |ci |c |- | |d\u017a |dzi |dz |- | |\u015b |si |s |- | |\u017a |zi |z |- | |\u0144 |ni |n |} Special attention should be paid to before plus a vowel. In words of foreign origin the causes the palatalization of the preceding consonant to , and it is pronounced as . This situation occurs when the corresponding genitive form ends in -nii, pronounced as , not with -ni, pronounced as (which is a situation typical to the words of Polish origin). For examples, see the table in the next section. Similar principles apply to the palatalized consonants , and , except that these can only occur before vowels. The spellings are thus before , and otherwise. For example, the in kim (\"whom\", instr.) and the in kiedy both represent . ===Other issues with i and j=== Except in the cases mentioned in the previous paragraph, the letter if followed by another vowel in the same word usually represents , but it also has the palatalizing effect on the previous consonant. For example, pies (\"dog\") is pronounced . Some words with before plus a vowel also follow this pattern (see below). In fact i is the usual spelling of between a preceding consonant and a following vowel. The letter normally appears in this position only after , and if the palatalization effect described above has to be avoided (as in presja \"pressure\", Azja \"Asia\", lekcja \"lesson\", and the common suffixes -cja \"-tion\", -zja \"-sion\": stacja \"station\", wizja \"vision\"). The letter after consonants is also used in concatenation of two words if the second word in the pair starts with , e.g. wjazd \"entrance\" originates from w + jazd(a). The pronunciation of the sequence wja (in wjazd) is the same as the pronunciation of wia (in wiadro \"bucket\"). The ending -ii which appears in the inflected forms of some nouns of foreign origin, which have -ia in the nominative case (always after , , , and ; sometimes after , , and other consonants), is pronounced as , with the palatalization of the preceding consonant. For example, dalii (genitive of dalia \"dalia\"), Bu\u0142garii (genitive of Bu\u0142garia \"Bulgaria\"), chemii (genitive of chemia \"chemistry\"), religii (genitive of religia \"religion\"), amfibii (genitive of amfibia \"amphibia\"). The common pronunciation is . This is why children commonly misspell and write -i in the inflected forms as armii, Danii or hypercorrectly write ziemii instead of ziemi (words of Polish origin do not have the ending -ii but simple -i, e.g. ziemi, genitive of ziemia). In some rare cases, however, when the consonant in case is preceded by another consonant, -ii may be pronounced as , but the preceding consonant is still palatalized, for example, Anglii (genitive etc. of Anglia \"England\") is pronounced . (The spelling Angli, very frequently met with on the Internet, is simply an error in orthography, caused by this pronunciation.) A special situation applies to : it has the full palatalization to before -ii which is pronounced as - and such a situation occurs only when the corresponding nominative form in -nia is pronounced as , not as . For example, (pay attention to the upper- and lower-case letters): {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Case !Word !Pronunciation !Meaning ! !Word !Pronunciation !Meaning |- |Nominative |dania | |dishes (plural) | |Dania | |Denmark |- |Genitive |(da\u0144) |() |(of dishes) | |Danii | |of Denmark |- |Nominative |Mania | |Mary (diminutive of \"Maria\") | |mania | |mania |- |Genitive |(Mani) |() |(of Mary) | |manii | |of mania |- |} The ending -ji, is always pronounced as . It appears only after c, s and z. Pronunciation of it as a simple is considered a pronunciation error. For example, presji (genitive etc. of presja \"pressure\") is ; poezji (genitive etc. of poezja \"poetry\") is ; racji (genitive etc. of racja \"reason\") is . ===Nasal vowels=== The letters and , when followed by plosives and affricates, represent an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant, rather than a nasal vowel. For example, in d\u0105b (\"oak\") is pronounced , and in t\u0119cza (\"rainbow\") is pronounced (the nasal assimilates with the following consonant). When followed by or (and in the case of , often at the end of words) these letters are pronounced as just or . ===Homophonic spellings=== Apart from the cases in the sections above, there are three sounds in Polish that can be spelt in two different ways, depending on the word. Those result from historical sound changes. The correct spelling can often be deduced from the spelling of other morphological forms of the word or cognates in Polish or in other Slavic languages. * can be spelt either or . ** only occurs in loanwords; however, many of them have been nativized and are not perceived as loanwords. is used: *** when cognate words have the letter , or , e.g.: ***: wahad\u0142o - waga ***: druh - dru\u017cyna ***: b\u0142ahy - b\u0142azen *** when the same letter is used in the language from which the word was borrowed, e.g. Greek prefixes hekto-, hetero-, homo-, hipo-, hiper-, hydro-, also honor, historia, herbata, etc. ** is used: *** in all native words, e.g. chyba, chrust, chrapa\u0107, chowa\u0107, chcie\u0107 *** when the same digraph is used in the language from which the word was borrowed, e.g. ch\u00f3r, echo, charakter, chronologia, etc. * can be spelt or ; the spelling indicates that the sound developed from the historical long /o\u02d0/. ** is used: *** usually at the beginning of a word (except for \u00f3semka, \u00f3smy, \u00f3w, \u00f3wczesny, \u00f3wdzie) *** always at the end of a word *** in the endings -uch, -ucha, -uchna, -uchny, -uga, -ula, -ulec, -ulek, -ule\u0144ka, -ulka, -ulo, -un, -unek, -uni, -unia, -unio, -ur, -us, -usi, -usie\u0144ki, -usia, -uszek, -uszka, -uszko, -u\u015b, -utki ** is used: *** when cognate words or other morphological forms have the letter , or , e.g.: ***: mr\u00f3z - mrozu ***: wi\u00f3z\u0142 - wie\u017a\u0107 ***: skr\u00f3ci\u0107 - skraca\u0107 *** in the endings -\u00f3w, -\u00f3wka, -\u00f3wna (except for zasuwka, skuwka, wsuwka) * can be spelt either or ; the spelling indicates that the sound developed from /r\u031d/ (cf. Czech ). ** is used: *** when cognate words or other morphological forms have the letter/digraph , , , , , , e.g.: ***: mo\u017ce - mog\u0119 ***: mosi\u0119\u017cny - mosi\u0105dz ***: dru\u017cyna - druh ***: ka\u017ce - kaza\u0107 ***: wo\u017c\u0119 - wo\u017anica ***: bli\u017cej - blisko *** in the particle \u017ce, e.g. sk\u0105d\u017ce, ten\u017ce, tak\u017ce *** after , , , e.g.: ***: l\u017cej ***: \u0142\u017ce ***: r\u017cysko *** in loanwords, especially from French, e.g.: ***: rewan\u017c ***: \u017cakiet ***: gara\u017c *** when cognates in other Slavic languages contain the sound or , e.g. \u017curaw - Russian \u0436\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044c ** is used: *** when cognate words or other morphological forms have the letter , e.g. morze - morski, karze - kara *** usually after , , , , , , , , , e.g.: ***: przygoda ***: brzeg ***: trzy ***: drzewo ***: krzywy ***: grzywa ***: chrzest ***: ujrze\u0107 ***: wrze\u0107 *** when cognates in other Slavic languages contain the sound or , e.g. rzeka - Russian \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430 ===Other points=== The letter represents in the digraphs and in loanwords, for example autor, Europa; but not in native words, like nauka, pronounced . There are certain clusters where a written consonant would not normally be pronounced. For example, the in the words m\u00f3g\u0142 (\"could\") and jab\u0142ko (\"apple\") is omitted in ordinary speech. ==Capitalization== Names are generally capitalized in Polish as in English. Polish does not capitalize the months and days of the week, nor adjectives and other forms derived from proper nouns (for example, angielski \"English\"). Titles such as pan (\"Mr\"), pani (\"Mrs/Ms\"), lekarz (\"doctor\"), etc. and their abbreviations are not capitalized, except in written polite address. Second- person pronouns are traditionally capitalized in formal writing (e.g. letters or official emails); so may be other words used to refer to someone directly in a formal setting, like Czytelnik (\"reader\", in newspapers or books). Third- person pronouns are capitalized to show reverence, most often in a sacred context. ==Punctuation== Polish punctuation is similar to that of English. However, there are more rigid rules concerning use of commas\u2014subordinate clauses are almost always marked off with a comma, while it is normally considered incorrect to use a comma before a coordinating conjunction with the meaning \"and\" (i, a or oraz). Abbreviations (but not acronyms or initialisms) are followed by a period when they end with a letter other than the one which ends the full word. For example, dr has no period when it stands for doktor, but takes one when it stands for an inflected form such as doktora and prof. has period because it comes from profesor (professor). Apostrophes are used to mark the elision of the final sound of foreign words not pronounced before Polish inflectional endings, as in Harry'ego (, genitive of Harry - the final is elided in the genitive). However, it is often erroneously used to separate a loanword stem from any inflectional ending, for example, *John'a, which should be Johna (genitive of John; no sound is elided). Quotation marks are used in different ways: either \u201eordinary Polish quotes\u201d or \u00abFrench quotes\u00bb (without space) for first level, and \u201asingle Polish quotes\u2019 or \u00abFrench quotes\u00bb for second level, which gives three styles of nested quotes: # \u201eQuote \u201ainside\u2019 quote\u201d # \u201eQuote \u00abinside\u00bb quote\u201d # \u00abQuote \u201ainside\u2019 quote\u00bb Some older prints have used \u201esuch Polish quotes\u201c. ==History== Poles adopted the Latin alphabet in the 12th century. However, that alphabet was ill-equipped to represent certain Polish sounds, such as the palatal consonants and nasal vowels. Consequently, Polish spelling in the Middle Ages was highly inconsistent, as different writers used different systems to represent these sounds, For example, in early documents the letter c could signify the sounds now written c, cz, k, while the letter z was used for the sounds now written z, \u017c, \u015b, \u017a. Writers soon began to experiment with digraphs (combinations of letters), new letters (\u03c6 and \u017f, no longer used), and eventually diacritics. The Polish alphabet was one of two major forms of Latin-based orthography developed for Slavic languages, the other being Czech orthography, characterized by carons (h\u00e1\u010deks), as in the letter \u010d. The other major Slavic languages which are now written in Latin-based alphabets (Slovak, Slovene, and Serbo-Croatian) use systems similar to the Czech. However a Polish-based orthography is used for Kashubian and usually for Silesian, while the Sorbian languages use elements of both systems. ==Computer encoding== There are several different systems for encoding the Polish alphabet for computers. All letters of the Polish alphabet are included in Unicode, and thus Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 can be used. The Polish alphabet is completely included in the Basic Multilingual Plane of Unicode. ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2), ISO 8859-13 (Latin-7), ISO 8859-16 (Latin-10) and Windows-1250 are popular 8-bit encodings that support Polish alphabet. The Polish letters which are not present in the English alphabet use the following HTML character entities and Unicode codepoints: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"text-align:center; border-top:1px solid #999;\" !Upper case | \u0104 || \u0106 || \u0118 || \u0141 || \u0143 || \u00d3 || \u015a || \u0179 || \u017b |- style=\"text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\" !HTML entity |&#260; &Aogon;||&#262; &Cacute;||&#280; &Eogon;||&#321; &Lstrok;||&#323; &Nacute;||&#211; &Oacute;||&#346; &Sacute;||&#377; &Zacute;||&#379; &Zdot; |- style=\"text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\" !Unicode | U+0104 || U+0106 || U+0118 || U+0141 || U+0143 || U+00D3 || U+015A || U+0179 || U+017B |- style=\"text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\" !Result | \u0104 || \u0106 || \u0118 || \u0141 || \u0143 || \u00d3 || \u015a || \u0179 || \u017b |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"text-align:center; border-top:1px solid #999;\" !Lower case | \u0105 || \u0107 || \u0119 || \u0142 || \u0144 || \u00f3 || \u015b || \u017a || \u017c |- style=\"text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\" !HTML entity |&#261; &aogon;||&#263; &cacute;||&#281; &eogon;||&#322; &lstrok;||&#324; &nacute;||&#243; &oacute;||&#347; &sacute;||&#378; &zacute;||&#380; &zdot; |- style=\"text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\" !Unicode | U+0105 || U+0107 || U+0119 || U+0142 || U+0144 || U+00F3 || U+015B || U+017A || U+017C |- style=\"text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\" !Result | \u0105 || \u0107 || \u0119 || \u0142 || \u0144 || \u00f3 || \u015b || \u017a || \u017c |} For other encodings, see the following table.
