The stadium is the home ground of Deportivo Alav\u00e9s. == History == Opened on 27 April 1924, it is currently the third oldest football stadium in the Spanish Professional Football, behind El Molin\u00f3n and Mestalla. During its history, the stadium had several renovations. The most important one was the expansion made in 1999, making new stands in the corners for increasing the capacity of the stadium to the current 19,840 seats. In December 2016, the club president Josean Querejeta announced a plan of modernisation and expansion of the stadium, possibly bringing its capacity to 28,000. Due to the economic problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, in June 2020 the club confirmed the project would be delayed for at least a year. ==Gallery== File:Vitoria - Mendizorrotza 01.jpg|Exterior of the stadium File:Alav\u00e9s2-2Lega2018.jpg|The stadium in 2017 File:Iraultza 2016-17.jpg|Interior of the stadium File:Estadio de Mendizorroza.JPG|The old scoreboard, used until 2015 File:Vitoria - Estadio de Mendizorroza 02.JPG|Mendizorrotza == References == == External links == *Estadios de Espa\u00f1a: Vitoria \u2013 Estadio Mendizorroza Category:Deportivo Alav\u00e9s Category:Football venues in the Basque Country Category:Buildings and structures in \u00c1lava Category:Sports venues completed in 1924 ",
