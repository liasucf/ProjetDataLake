Its full name was (). Intended primarily as a city large enough to house an army, it was laid out in a grid pattern that could be easily subdivided into separate sections for various groups, such as merchants and officers. The peak of the Abbasid dynasty occurred during the reign of Harun al Rashid (r. 786-809), along with increased taxes on the Egyptians, who rose up in a peasant revolt in 832 during the time of Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833). Local Egyptian governors gained increasing autonomy, and in 870, governor Ahmad ibn Tulun declared Egypt's independence (though still nominally under the rule of the Abbasid Caliph). As a symbol of this independence, in 868 ibn Tulun founded yet another capital, al-Qatta'i, slightly further north of al-\u2018Askar. ===After 868=== Al-\u2018Askar, Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d, and, after the 1168 fire that destroyed old Fustat, nearby al-Q\u0101hirah (Cairo) became capitals of Egypt, the latter keeping this position to this day. Cairo's boundaries grew to eventually encompass the three earlier capitals of al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d, al-Qatta'i and al-\u2018Askar, the remnants of which can today be seen in \"Old Cairo\" in the southern part of the city. ==References== ==External links== *Map Askar, al- Category:Former populated places in Egypt Category:Populated places established in the 8th century Category:Populated places disestablished in the 9th century Category:Former capitals of Egypt ",
