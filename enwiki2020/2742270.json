    "text": "Viking) One of the Family (1993) was the last novel written by Monica Dickens, great granddaughter of Charles Dickens. It is set in Edwardian London where the world, like main character Leonard Morley's life, is changing. We start the book with a single note which seems to leave a smudge on Leonard and his family life. The book continues with himself, two sons, a daughter and a wife as well as a large extended family all making room for one more, when curiously charming 'Doctor' Tobias Taylor appears on the scene. However curiosity killed more than just a cat, as the family soon finds out. Leonard Morley, in the very first chapter, receives a threatening note, requesting blood money in the absence of Mr Whiteley, his manager and Leonard informs his wife of it, who dismisses it avidly. However, over time more of these notes turn up, and when the fourth has found its way to Leonard, he resolves to tell Mr Whiteley. But whilst waiting to speak to him, Mr Whiteley is shot, and is lying in a pool of blood. In the court scene, where Leonard stands as witness, all over London people flock to see the trial. In the end, Horace Rayner is charged with murder, and given a life sentence. This book very cleverly entwines fact with fiction, and Whiteley's assassination being involved is the first example that comes to mind.
