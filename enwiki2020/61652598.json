    "text": "Ecclesiastes 7 is the seventh chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. The book contains philosophical speeches by a character called '(the) Qoheleth' (=\"the Teacher\"), composed probably between 5th to 2nd century BCE. Peshitta, Targum, and Talmud attribute the authorship of the book to King Solomon. This chapter deals with suffering and sin. The style of the first half (verses 1\u201314) is similar to that of the 'sentence literature' collections (such as ) and, as in such collections, the sayings are linked by catchwords and thematic ties with the previous ones, with a series of \"better ... than\" presenting dialectic pairs of issues. The second half exposes the 'crookedness of life' (verse 13) that moves to the 'crookedness of humanity' (verse 29). ==Text== The original text was written in Hebrew. This chapter is divided into 29 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls 4QQoh (4Q109; 175-150 BCE; extant verses 1-10, 19-20).Dead sea scrolls - Ecclesiastes. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). The Greek text is probably derived from the work of Aquila of Sinope or his followers. ==Instructive suffering (7:1\u20136)== This section gives the first instruction about suffering, to be followed by the exposition about its dangers in hindering wisdom (verses 7-10). As a funeral may cause one to think about life, whereas a party probably not, visits to 'house of mourning' may bring more valuable lessons for inner character, enabling true resolutions in one's life. ==Four dangers (7:7\u201310)== The four dangers to hinder wisdom are: corruption (verse 7), impatience (verse 8), bitterness (verse 9) and nostalgia (verse 10). To deal with these one needs to take 'a long-term view of life when reacting to adversity'. ==The need of wisdom (7:11\u201312)== Wisdom, like a land which could be given as an inheritance, belongs to God but is granted to his people, and it has a deeper level of protective power than wealth. ==Life under God (7:13\u201314)== Both good times and bad times are God-ordained and purposeful, so people should accept good when accessible and face adversity when it becomes reality. ==Neither too wise nor too foolish (7:15\u201322)== This part states the 'inadvisability of extreme righteousness and wisdom', with the advice to adopt only some parts of wisdom, 'neither to be too wise and righteous, nor too foolish and wicked', but 'a bit of both', as those who fear God will succeed in both or 'escape the consequences of doing neither'. ==The Search for integrity (7:23\u201329)== The section suggests that it is not so easy to find wisdom nor any 'definitive explanation of the world'. It closes with Qoheleth's ironic commentary in Ecclesiastes 8:1. ===Verse 26=== :And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her. ESV The statements in this verse are not a polemic against women, but an allegorical warnings against \"Folly\", described as an evilly seductive woman (cf. Proverbs 2:16-19; 5:20; 6:24-35; 7:5-27; 23:27-28), who is on a hunt to catch sinful people. *\"He who pleases God\": Literally, \"He who is good before God\"Note [a] on Ecclesiastes 7:26 in NKJV ==See also== * Related Bible parts: Proverbs 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 23 ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * ==External links== * Jewish translations: ** Kohelet \u2013 Ecclesiastes - Chapter 7 (Judaica Press) translation [with Rashi's commentary] at Chabad.org * Christian translations: ** Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) * Ecclesiastes Chapter 7 King James Version * Various versions 07 ",
