During the anarchic times of the Wars of the Roses he was caught up in the dynastic Westcountry rivalry between Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon, of Tiverton Castle, for whom during his minority he had acted as steward, and William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, of Shute. His murder in 1455 by the Earl's faction \"ranks among the most notorious crimes of the century\",Woodger and was the precursor of the Battle of Clyst Heath (1455) fought shortly thereafter near Exeter by the private armies of the two magnates. He served as a Justice of the Peace for Devon (1424-1455), as Escheator for Devon and Cornwall (1435-6), Recorder of Exeter (1442-1455) and as Tax Collector for Devon in 1450 and as Apprentice-at-law for the Duchy of Lancaster (1439-1455).Woodger ==Origins== He was the son of Robert Radford of Oakford, Devon.Woodger According to Risdon (d.1640), he was a descendant of the de Radford family of the estate of Radford, in the parish of Winkleigh, Devon, who had changed their name from de Bickly, after Robert de Bickly, son of Ralph Borne, had during the reign of King Richard I (1199-1299) been granted the estate of Radford by Oliver de Tracy, feudal baron of Barnstaple.Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.263 According to Pole the arms of Radford of Radford were: Sable, three lampagoes (man tigers with lion's bodies and man's faces) passant in pale coward argent.Pole, p.499 ==Steward of Earl of Devon== In 1423 he was appointed by the royal council as joint steward (with John II Copleston (d.1457) of Copleston, thrice MP for Devon, Escheator of Devon and Cornwall http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/copplestone- john-1458) of the vast estates of the infant Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon (1414\u20131458), ward of the king and son and heir of the magnate Hugh de Courtenay, 4th/12th Earl of Devon (1389\u20131422).Woodger The 5th/13th Earl reached his majority of 21 in 1435, after which Radford still remained friends with him and was chosen by the earl to be a godfather to his second son Henry Courtenay.Woodger ==Marriage== At some time before 1431, he married a certain Thomasina, by whom he had a son, Nicholas Jnr, born in 1437 in Poughill, Devon.Woodger Nicholas Jnr married Ursula Sufcote and they had a son, William. ==Murder by Courtenay faction== The facts surrounding Radford's murder are recorded in the petition for justice made by his executor John Radford to King Henry VI, preserved in the National Archives at Kew and summarised contemporaneously as follows: National Archives, SC 8/138/6864 Petition of John Radford to the King (SC 8: \"Special Collections: Ancient Petitions to the King; to the King and Council; to the Council; to the Parliament; and the like\") :Petition stating that Nicholas Radford was a justice of the Peace by the king's commission and was possessed of great zeal to pursue evil-doers. On Thursday 23 October in 34th year of the reign, Radford was at his place called Uppecote in Cadleleigh and was in the king's peace, and Thomas Courtenayi.e. eldest son and heir apparent of the Earl of Devon, whom Radcliffe had served as steward came with others bearing arms and attacked Radford's place and set the gates of the place on fire. Radford came and admitted them after Courtenay (said) that he and his goods would be preserved. While Courtenay distracted Radford, the men stripped the place, turning Radford's sick wife out of bed and carrying all away. Afterwards Courtenay said that he had to take Radford to his father and then departed. Philip i.e. Nicholas Philippe (Philip) otherwise called Nicholas Gye, late of Tiverton, yeoman and the others then struck Radford on the head with a glaive so that his brain fell out and cut his throat. Afterwards at his burial when his body lay in his chapel,i.e. at Upcott Manor Henry Courtenay i.e. brother of Sir Thomas Courtenay, future Earl of Devon and godson of Nicholas Radford came with others and took upon him the office of coroner and held an inquest without authority.

The Paston Letters include a letter dated 28 October 1455 from James Gresham to John Paston as follows:Gairdner, J.D., (ed.), The Paston Letters, Volume 1, 1896, pp.350-2 :\"Also there is gret varyance bytwene the Erll of Devenshire and the Lord Bonvyle, as hath be many day, and meche debat is like to growe therby ; for on Thursday at nyght last passed, the Erll of Denshyres sone and heir come with LX men of armes to Radford's place in Devenshire, whiche was of counseil with my Lord Bonvyle; and they sette an hous on fyer at Radford's gate, and cryed and mad an noyse as though they had be sory for the fyer; and by that cause Radford's men set opyn the gats and yede owt to se the fyer; and for with th'erll sone forseid entred into the place and intreted Radford to come doun of his chambre to sp[e]ke with them, promyttyng hym that he shuld no bodyly harm have; up on whiche promysse he come doun, and spak with the seid Erll sone.
