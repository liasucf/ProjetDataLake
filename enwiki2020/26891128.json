    "text": "Lin Yu-chun (); born 9 March 1986 in Taipei) is a Taiwanese singer, who gained fame by appearing on a Taiwanese talent show, One Million Star (\u8d85\u7d1a\u661f\u5149\u5927\u9053), singing \"I Will Always Love You\" (written and originally sung by Dolly Parton) in the style of Whitney Houston's cover version. Lin is well known for his mezzo-soprano-like, and sometimes, contralto-like countertenor singing voice, although he has an adult speaking voice. According to many sources, Lin's voice is usually described as a mixture of Whitney Houston and Susan Boyle, with a dash of Cher. When Lin sings in his normal masculine voice rather than in a falsetto range, his voice actually somewhat sounds like Jamie Walters, or even possibly like Jackson Browne. In 2013, he competed in the second season of The Voice of China. ==Biography== Lin was voted off the show, but after a video of Lin singing the song made it onto YouTube, Lin became an internet celebrity, receiving more than 10,000,000 views of his performance. Many news sources dubbed Lin \"Taiwan's Susan Boyle\". In an interview, Lin Yu Chun explained that he selected \"I Will Always Love You\" to show his gratitude to his grandmother for taking care of Lin over the years. In April 2010, he visited the United States and performed \"I Will Always Love You\" and Amazing Grace on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. On the same trip, he attended Lopez Tonight and performed \"Saving All My Love for You\" (also a Whitney Houston cover) and Total Eclipse of the Heart (originally by Bonnie Tyler) as a duet with William Shatner.
