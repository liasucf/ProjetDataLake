    "text": "Anaxilas (), also called Anaxilas Comicus, (fl. 340 BC)Arnold, p. 221. was a Greek comic poet of the Middle Comedy period. Based on his name, he has been presumed of Doric origin.Edmonds, pp. 332-333 n. b; Csapo, p. 218 n. 83. He was, along with several other Middle Comedy poets (e.g. Antiphanes, Anaxandrides, Amphis, Alexis, Epicrates, Eubulides, Sophilus, and Dionysius of Sinope -- all of apparently non-Attic origin) part of the increasing influence of non-Attic poets following the fifth century BC.Csapo, p. 218. He was one of several comic poets mentioned by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, as having \"ridiculed\" Plato.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, 3.26, 28. ==Surviving Titles and Fragments== Titles for twenty one of his plays are known, but only fragments of his works remain.Edmonds, pp. 332-348. *The Rustic Man *Exchange *The Pipe-Player *Botrylion *Glaucus *Manliness *Thrasyleon *Calypso *Circe *Cyclops *Lyremakers (or possibly Perfume-makers) *Cooks *The Recluse *Neottis *Nereus *Bird-Keepers *Wealthy Men (or possibly Wealthy Women) *Hyacinthus, or Hyacinthus the Pimp *Graces *The Goldsmith *Seasons ==Notes== ==References== * Arnold, Sir Edwin, The Poets of Greece, London: Cassell, Petter, and Galpin, 1869. * Csapo, Eric, Hans Rupprecht Goette, J.
