    "text": "The Emmanuel Association is a Methodist denomination in the conservative holiness movement. The formation of the Emmanuel Association is a part of the history of Methodism in the United States; it was formed in 1937 as a result of a schism with the Pilgrim Holiness Church spearheaded by Ralph Goodrich Finch, the former general superintendent of Foreign Missions in that denomination. It is one of the oldest denominations in the conservative holiness movement. Like other Methodist bodies, it is governed by a General Conference. The Emmanuel Association's holiness standards are codified in the text titled \"Principles of Holy Living\". The denomination is opposed to warfare, thus falling into the Holiness Pacifists subgroup of the holiness movement. It advocates for the principle of nonresistance: The Emmanuel Association is based in Colorado Springs. == References == Category:Methodist denominations Category:Methodist denominations in North America Category:Holiness denominations Category:Holiness movement Category:History of Methodism in the United States Category:Christian organizations established in 1937 Category:1937 establishments in the United States ",
