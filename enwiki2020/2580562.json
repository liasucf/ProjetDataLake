The ELN is a revolutionary, Marxist, insurgent guerrilla group that has been operating in several regions of Colombia since 1966. Less known than the FARC, it is estimated to be smaller, having between 3,500 and 5,000 armed personnel. It is said that Jacobo Arenas (the \"nom de guerre\" of Luis Morantes), a founder and ideological leader of the FARC-EP, was seen as hero by the Garc\u00eda, who once stated in an interview to a Latin American journalist that he considered Arenas to be a hero, just as he considered Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and Che Guevara to be heroes. On May 26, 2008 Ecuadorean and Colombian media reported the arrest of Garc\u00eda in Ecuador. The Ecuadorean military said they \"probably\" did have him in custody, but needed to do more investigation to be sure. The arrest proved to be a mistake. The arrested guerrilla was identified as Willington Claro Ar\u00e9valo, alias 'Antonio'. == References == Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Putumayo Department Category:Members of the National Liberation Army (Colombia) ",
