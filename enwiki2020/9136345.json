This is mainly owed to an interesting mix between yakuza drama and martial arts elements. In the nicely choreographed fight scenes, the former boxer Yamato Takeshi, can fully show off his skills as Bodyguard Kiba.\" Knoth further writes that \"the shots were surprisingly good. Especially the scenes shot on board the ferry are very impressive and are among my favorite Miike sequences. In these scenes, the film establishes the subplot of male bonding between Junpei and Kiba.\" In his book Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike, author Tom Mes writes that \"Bodyguard Kiba constitutes a major improvement over not only A Human Murder Weapon but all the films Miike had made up until that point\" and that \"script-wise too the film was an improvement over its predecessor\", concluding that \"by taking the time to portray his characters, Miike has also created a more developed and more human character than ever before.\" ==References== == External links == * Category:1993 films Category:1993 martial arts films Category:1990s action films Category:Films directed by Takashi Miike Category:Films about bodyguards Category:Films about the illegal drug trade Category:Films set in 1988 Category:Films set in 1993 Category:Films set in Okinawa Prefecture Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:Japanese action films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese direct-to-video films Category:Japanese martial arts films Category:Karate films Category:V-Cinema Category:Yakuza films ",
