Estess also started Project ALS, which raises funds for finding a cure for Lou Gehrig's disease, from which she suffered. She helped raise over $17,000,000 (USD) for the Project. In 2000, Estess testified before Senator Arlen Specter\u2019s sub-committee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education. \"My life and millions of others are in the hands of Congress. We are already seeing the incredible potential of stem cells to replace what is destroyed in ALS, but we need the federal government to mentor research along in the most responsible, humane way.\" Pointing out that, \"non-profits like Project A.L.S. and private industry have started stem cell replacement on the right track,\" she urged Congress to \"do the right thing and take us to the next level with this life-saving science.\" ==Death== Jenifer Estess died from A.L.S. on December 16, 2003, aged 40. ==References== ==Sources== *Jenifer Estess, 40; Fought Lou Gehrig's Disease, The New York Times, December 17, 2003 Category:1963 births Category:2003 deaths Category:American activists Category:American theatre managers and producers Category:Deaths from motor neuron disease Category:Tisch School of the Arts alumni Category:People from Moline, Illinois Category:Place of death missing ",
