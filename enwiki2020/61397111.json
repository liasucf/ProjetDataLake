    "text": "The South Australian Railways G Class Locomotives first appeared on the South Australian Railways in 1869 after being purchased from Beyer, Peacock and Company. More locomotives were purchased and were in service in 1880, then again followed in 1886. The G class lasted up to 1923 until they were all condemned. ==History== Only five of the G class locomotives were purchased new by the South Australian Railways from Beyer, Peacock and Company. The rest of the class were acquired upon the takeover of the Glenelg and Grange railway lines from private operators. On the 2nd of August 1873 the Adelaide, Glenelg and Suburban Railway Company opened a line between Adelaide and Glenelg via King William Street and South Terrace, Adelaide. This is the same line which is the current route used by Trams on the Glenelg tram line. On the 25th of May 1880 the Holdfast Bay railway line was officially opened and a line from the Adelaide railway station, North Terrace to Glenelg through Richmond and Plyptom. These two lines were eventually amalgamated in 1881 and formed the Glenelg Railway Company. The Glenelg Railway Company in turn passed over the Government control on the 15th of December 1899. The Grange Railway Company built and operated a line between Woodville and Grange in 1882, which was then acquired by the South Australian Railways on 1 January 1893. G class locomotives No. 23 and No. 24 were the first of two locomotives of the class imported to work over the newly opened lightly laid track of the Roseworthy- Tarlee section of the Northern Railway in 1869. G class locomotive No. 23 was the first locomotive to be purchased from Beyer, Peacock for the South Australian Railways which followed many future purchases. G class locomotives No. 23 and No. 24 were later employed to work on the Strathalbyn to Victor Harbor railway line. The other three G class locomotives which were purchased new for the SAR No. 99, 100 and 101 replaced the Belgian Steam Railcar on the Strathalbyn to Milang and to Victor Harbor railway line as well. ==References== G Category:Broad gauge locomotives in Australia Category:Beyer, Peacock locomotives Category:2-4-0T locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1869 ",
