In 1940, Tempier and her husband, Lucien Peyraud, took charge of a Tempier family farming and wine estate in Le Castellet (Var). The couple kept developing their estate and the Bandol \"protected designation of origin\" (appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, AOC) with the ambition of making it one of the great wines of France. After World War II, Peyraud traveled the world with her husband to learn about foreign wine and techniques, and to promote French wines. Their travels took them to South Africa, Germany, the United States, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Georgia, Greece, Italy, Mexico, and Romania. Lucien Peyraud was the President of the Bandol Wine Association for 37 years from 1945 to 1982. He was also a member of the INAO in 1947 and of the International Organization of the Vine and Wine (OIV), as an auditor in the Oenology Commission.\"Si Bandol AOC m'\u00e9tait cont\u00e9\", by Lionel Heinic 72 pages, Editions Scriba (1992) - Collection : La Provence des R\u00e9ussites, S\u00e9rie Terroir. Despite being the mother of seven children, Lulu Peyraud acted as an ambassador of the wines of Domaine Tempier, often traveling throughout France to present the estate's wines to restaurants and hotels.
