    "text": "Terri Lynn Land (born June 30, 1958) is an American politician who served as Michigan's 41st Secretary of State. In 2012, Land was elected to the Republican National Committee. She was the Republican nominee for the 2014 United States Senate race in Michigan, losing in the general election to Democrat Gary Peters. == Early life and education == Land was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Land grew up in Grandville, Michigan, graduating from Grandville High School. She attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in political science. In 2009, Land was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Davenport University. == Politics == === Early political career === In 1980, Land joined the Grandville Planning Commission. At age 23, Land ran for the Michigan House of Representatives, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Democrat Jelt Sietsema. From 1992-2000, she was the elected Clerk of Kent County, the fourth largest county of Michigan. In 2000, with Gov. John Engler's encouragement, Land ran unsuccessfully for the Michigan State Board of Education. === Michigan Secretary of State === In 2002, Land became Michigan's 41st Secretary of State, defeating Melvin Hollowell, a Detroit-based attorney, 55%-43% and took office on January 1, 2003. Land and her husband contributed more than $1.9 million of their own money in the 2002 and 2006 Secretary of State campaigns. The Grand Rapids Press editorial board praised Land for her technological transformation of state services, including updates to computer systems; expansion of Web services; consolidation of branch offices and \"expanded hours in new, larger locations\"; and changes that for the first time allowed Michigan customers to pay fees with credit cards and renew license plate registrations through self-service stations. The Press editorial board wrote that, against the opposition of some Republicans, Land \"advocated measures that would expand participation at the polls, including early voting, no- reason absentee voting and early registration for young voters.\" In 2005, Land's office announced an effort to use the Help America Vote Act to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names of voters who had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A New York Times investigation found that 33,000 people were removed from the rolls, while Land's office said 11,000 voters were removed. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The Times pointed out that similar problems were seen in other states, as \"Republican and Democratic election officials ... struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.\" In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the national Voting Rights Act had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office told the Detroit Free Press that, \"If you're eligible to vote, you will be able to cast a vote on Election Day\". In 2006, she was elected to a second term, defeating Macomb County Clerk Carmella Sabaugh 56%-42%. After serving two terms, the maximum allowed in the state, she was succeeded by Republican Ruth Johnson. === 2010 gubernatorial race === After exploring a bid for Michigan governor in 2010, Land decided not to run in June 2009, instead endorsing Mike Bouchard. She ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Bouchard the following year, but lost in the Republican primary. === 2014 U.S. Senate election === On June 3, 2013 Land announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2014. She ran unopposed in the primary and faced Democratic congressman Gary Peters in the general election. According to an early analysis by the Washington Post, the U.S. Senate election in Michigan was considered one of the top 10 Senate races of 2014. Land outraised Peters throughout the campaign. Her largest independent backer was Americans for Prosperity, which spent $3.6 million in support of her candidacy. In 2014, Land gave $3 million to her own campaign, saying, \"You can't ask other people to invest in you if you don't invest in yourself.\" In her federal financial disclosure form, she had not listed any bank accounts or other assets in her control worth that much. Her campaign said that it had mistakenly failed to disclose a joint account she had with her husband. A Detroit Free Press review of financial disclosure forms showed Land and her husband had assets worth $35 million in 2014, with $1.5 million belonging to Land, and that \"candidates may typically tap liberally into joint accounts with their spouses.\" In May 2014, Land gave a speech at the Mackinac Policy Conference, a three-day event that many of the state's top business and civic leaders attend, which she read from notes. Following her speech, Land was swarmed by reporters and, unable to articulate a response to a question, pushed their microphones away, saying, \"I can't do this.\" Land was endorsed by the entire Michigan Republican delegation, as well as former congressman Pete Hoekstra, the Family Research Council, and National Right to Life. Her campaign was weighed down by various missteps and her reluctance to make public campaign appearances, particularly after her meltdown in May. Peters opened up a consistent lead in the polls beginning in September. The Republican establishment effectively gave up on Land's campaign the following month.http://atr.rollcall.com/senate-races-2014-why-michigan-never-became- iowa/ In the November 4 general election, Land received 41.3% of the vote to Peters's 54.6%.New York Times, November 5, 2014, pg. 1 === Voting rights lawsuit === In September 2020, Land filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for allowing votes postmarked before election day to be counted after election day. == Personal life == Land married Dan Hibma in 1983. They live in Byron Center and have two children. According to financial disclosures, Land and her family have assets worth at least $34 million. == Electoral history == == References == == External links == * Terri Lynn Land for Senate * * |- Category:1958 births Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:County officials in Michigan Category:Hope College alumni Category:Living people Category:Michigan Republicans Category:People from Byron Center, Michigan Category:People from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:People from Grandville, Michigan Category:Secretaries of State of Michigan Category:Women in Michigan politics ",
