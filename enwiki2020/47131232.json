    "text": "Irreligion in the United Arab Emirates is rare, with only up to 4% of people reporting irreligious beliefs according to a Gallup poll. It is illegal for Muslims, with apostates from Islam facing a maximum sentence of the death penalty under the country's anti-blasphemy law. As such, there have been questions regarding freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates. Atheism in the region is mainly present among foreign expatriates and a very small number of local youth. According to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, due to Islam being founded in the Arabian Peninsula over 1,400 years ago, the Persian Gulf region enjoys a long Islamic history and tradition, and it is strongly associated with national identity; thus, any distancing or criticism of religion \"equates to distancing oneself from national identity\". Al-Qassemi notes that the use of social media via the internet remains the strongest medium of expression for Gulf atheists, while providing anonymity; a pioneering Gulf blogger is the Emirati atheist Ahmed Ben Kerishan, who is known in the Arabic blogosphere for advocating atheist and secular views. ==See also== * Persecution of atheists in Islamic countries * Persecution of atheists in the Middle East * Religion in the United Arab Emirates * Freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates * Christianity in the United Arab Emirates * Islam in the United Arab Emirates * Demographics of the United Arab Emirates ==References== Category:Irreligion by country Category:Irreligion in the Middle East ",
