    "text": "A first-time buyer (FTB) is a term used in the British, Irish, Canada property markets, and in other countries, for a potential house buyer who has not previously owned a property. A first-time buyer is usually desirable to a seller as they do not have to sell a property, and as such will not involve a housing chain.First time buyers There are many factors a first-time buyer may need to consider before purchasing their first property; how much initial cash they will need for stamp duty and any solicitors fees, and if they need to arrange a mortgage how much are they able to afford. In many countries such as United Kingdom, Canada and Australia home ownership is seen as a natural step in the life cycle and the natural form of property tenure.Housing Policies for the New UKChapter on Housing Trends in Ireland Canada and Australia have some of the most ownership rate in word (all above 65%) home ownership. Ireland has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the EU at around 80%. In the UK in the 1980s almost half of all mortgages were taken out by first-time buyers, but this has now declined to only about 15%.. In Ireland, FTB's represent 34% of the market. In recent years the number of new buyers purchasing property has declined.Decline in number of first-time buyers In the 2007 Scottish parliamentary election the Scottish National Party proposed a \u00a32,000 grant for first-time buyers to help them get onto the property ladder.Brown in economy clash with SNP Grants have not been forthcoming in the rest of the UK, but in July 2007 Housing Minister Yvette Cooper announced it would be broadening the government's Homebuy Shared Equity scheme to help buyers. \"Unless we act now by 2026 first-time buyers will find average house prices are ten times their salary. That could lead to real social inequality and injustice,\" Cooper told Parliament. Since then, first time buyers have regained momentum in the market, with reports in 2010 citing first-time buying as the most popular of consumer enquiries for a local, whole of market mortgage adviser - accounting for 37% of total enquiries.Consumers Seeking Pension Advice in July 2010 In 2016 the UK Government launched the Help to Buy ISA for first time buyers through incentivising them to use savings to fund a deposit on a property. The money saved is then boosted by 25% up to a maximum of \u00a33000. In April 2017, the Lifetime ISA was launched. It was launched to replace the Help to Buy ISA (which was closed in Nov 2017). The Lifetime ISA gives a similar 25% top-up from the government towards a First Time Buyer's home purchase, but also gives the flexibility to save the money and the top-up for retirement. ==See also== * First time home buyer grant * Help to Buy * Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation ==References== ==External links== Category:Housing in the United Kingdom Category:Housing in the Republic of Ireland Category:Economy of the Republic of Ireland Category:Real estate bubbles of the 2000s ",
