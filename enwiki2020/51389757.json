    "text": "On 21 August 1986, a limnic eruption at Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon killed 1,746 people and 3,500 livestock. The eruption triggered the sudden release of about 100,000\u2013300,000 tons (1.6 million tons, according to some sources) of carbon dioxide (). The gas cloud initially rose at nearly and then, being heavier than air, descended onto nearby villages, displacing all the air and suffocating people and livestock within of the lake. A degassing system has since been installed at the lake, with the aim of reducing the concentration of in the waters and therefore the risk of further eruptions. == Eruption and gas cloud == It is not known what triggered the catastrophic outgassing. Most geologists suspect a landslide, but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake. A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn. Others still believe there was a small earthquake, but because witnesses did not report feeling any tremors on the morning of the disaster, this hypothesis is unlikely. The event resulted in the supersaturated deep water rapidly mixing with the upper layers of the lake, where the reduced pressure allowed the stored CO2 to effervesce out of solution. It is believed that about of gas was released. The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing, due to iron-rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being oxidised by the air. The level of the lake dropped by about a metre and trees near the lake were knocked down. Scientists concluded from evidence that a column of water and foam formed at the surface of the lake, spawning a wave of at least that swept the shore on one side. Since carbon dioxide is 1.5 times the density of air, the cloud hugged the ground and moved down the valleys, where there were various villages. The mass was about thick, and travelled downward at . For roughly , the gas cloud was concentrated enough to suffocate many people in their sleep in the villages of Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Subum. About 4,000 inhabitants fled the area, and many of these developed respiratory problems, lesions, and paralysis as a result of the gas cloud. Lake Nyos disaster, Cameroon, 1986: the medical effects of large scale emission of carbon dioxide?, BMJ, Volume 298, May 27, 1989, It is a possibility that other volcanic gases were released along with the CO2, as some survivors reported a smell of gunpowder or rotten eggs which indicates that sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were present at concentrations above their odour thresholds. However, CO2 was the only gas detected in samples of lake water, suggesting that this was the predominant gas released and as such the main cause of the incident. == Effects on survivors == Cattle suffocated by carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos One survivor, Joseph Nkwain from Subum, described himself when he awoke after the gases had struck: > \"I could not speak. I became unconscious. I could not open my mouth because > then I smelled something terrible ... I heard my daughter snoring in a > terrible way, very abnormal ... When crossing to my daughter's bed ... I > collapsed and fell. I was there till nine o'clock in the (Friday) morning > ... until a friend of mine came and knocked at my door ...

Following the eruption, many survivors were treated at the main hospital in Yaound\u00e9, the country's capital. It was believed that many of the victims had been poisoned by a mixture of gases that included hydrogen and sulfur. Poisoning by these gases would lead to burning pains in the eyes and nose, coughing and signs of asphyxiation similar to being strangled. == Aftermath == The scale of the disaster led to much study on how a recurrence could be prevented. Several researchers proposed the installation of degassing columns from rafts in the middle of the lake. The principle is to slowly vent the by lifting heavily saturated water from the bottom of the lake through a pipe, initially by using a pump, but only until the release of gas inside the pipe naturally lifts the column of effervescing water, making the process self- sustaining.Degassing Lake Nyos project http://pagesperso- orange.fr/mhalb/nyos/nyos.htm Starting from 1995, feasibility studies were successfully conducted, and the first permanent degassing tube was installed at Lake Nyos in 2001. Two additional pipes were installed in 2011. Following the Lake Nyos disaster, scientists investigated other African lakes to see if a similar phenomenon could happen elsewhere. Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2,000 times larger than Lake Nyos, was also found to be supersaturated, and geologists found evidence that outgassing events around the lake happened about every thousand years. ==In popular culture== A Greek novel by Basileios Drolias focusing on the Lake Nyos disaster and the degassing of the lake was published in 2016. ==See also== *Lake Monoun disaster *Lake Kivu *List of natural disasters by death toll == References == == External links == *Google Earth view of the area around Lake Nyos Category:1986 natural disasters Category:1986 in Cameroon Category:Natural disasters in Cameroon Category:20th-century volcanic events Category:Gas explosions Category:August 1986 events in Africa ",
