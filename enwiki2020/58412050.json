An anti- racism group, Courageous Conversations, \"wants to put a plaque next to the statue addressing slavery as part of the Civil War. Members say the statue, in its current state, represents slavery. Currently, another plaque sits outside the courthouse referring to African-Americans as 'pioneer settlers.'\" Williamson County Commissioners voted 4\u20131 not to allow the plaque, which would require the approval of the Texas Historical Commission in any event. \"The commissioners expressed a desire to discuss the issue more, or even consider erecting a civil rights statue.\" ==See also== * 1916 in art * List of Confederate monuments and memorials * Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials ==References== ==External links== * Category:1916 establishments in Texas Category:1916 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Georgetown, Texas Category:Confederate States of America monuments and memorials in Texas Category:Outdoor sculptures in Texas Category:Sculptures of men in Texas Category:Statues in Texas ",
