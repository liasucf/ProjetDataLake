    "text": "The Prime Minister's Youth Council () is an advisory board created by the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau in 2016. Up to thirty Canadian youth aged 16 to 24 comprise the non-partisan board. Members advise the prime minister on education, economy, climate change and other issues affecting youth. Trudeau announced the formation of the council on Twitter on 19 June 2016, after which he fielded questions online. It was the first time he used social media to make a major announcement as Prime Minister. Members of the council meet in-person or online via video or audio conference, several times per year. Meetings may take place anywhere in Canada and the council held exceptional virtual meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Some have felt that online meetings may be a hindrance to any Inuit youth on the council, as Internet access is not widespread in Nunavut, Nunatsiavut, Nunavik and other Arctic areas of Canada. Trudeau stated that he will work with organisations to ensure all youth are connected during the initiative. ==Members== The first 15 members of the Council were announced in September 2016, 11 members from the second cohort were announced in January 2017, 10 members from the third cohort in June 2018, and 8 members from the fourth cohort in August 2019. === Current Members === ==== Cohort 3 ==== * Zander Affleck - Yellowknife, Northwest Territories * Habon Ali - Toronto, Ontario * Jack Campbell - Vancouver, British Columbia * Ashley Cummings - Yukon; Nunavut * Elijah Dietrich - Winnipeg, Manitoba * Tagalik Eccles - Rankin Inlet, Nunavut * Sagar Grewal - Calgary, Alberta *Pier-Maude Lanteigne - New Brunswick *Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9pine-Cossette - Montreal, Quebec *Kathryn McIntosh - Halifax, Nova Scotia ==== Cohort 4 ==== *Jamuna Both\u00e9 - Moncton, New Brunswick *Alfred Burgesson - Halifax, Nova Scotia *Sarah Fancy - Nova Scotia *Erin Knight - Manitoba *Conor McIsaac - St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador *Nancy Mitchell - Toronto, Ontario *Brooks Roche - Montague, Prince Edward Island *Sila Rogan - Winnipeg, Manitoba === Past Members === ==== Cohort 1 \u2014 September 2016 to March 2018 ==== *Sara Abdessamie \u2013 Fredericton, New Brunswick *Mustafa Ahmed \u2013 Toronto, Ontario *Hani Al Moulia \u2013 Regina, Saskatchewan (originally a refugee from Syria) *Alex Bouchard \u2013 Haines Junction, Yukon *Joseph Darcel \u2013 Winnipeg, Manitoba *Gregory Francis \u2013 Kingsclear First Nation, New Brunswick *Sylvia Pascua Matte \u2013 Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories *Rachel Smale \u2013 Pond Inlet, Nunavut *Donovan Taplin \u2013 Wabana, Bell Island, Newfoundland and Labrador *Aaron Taylor \u2013 Debert, Nova Scotia *Macgregor 'Mac' Tebbutt \u2013 Penticton, British Columbia *\u00c9lyse Tremblay- Longchamps \u2013 Montreal, Quebec *Nmesomachukwu Umenwofor-Nweze \u2013 Iqaluit, Nunavut (originally from Nigeria) *Ashley Whiteman \u2013 Edmonton, Alberta *Chris Zhou \u2013 Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island ==== Cohort 2 \u2014 January 2017 to January 2019 ==== *Rayene Bouzitoun \u2013 Montreal, Quebec *Simone Cavanaugh \u2013 Montreal, Quebec *Molly French \u2013 Sherwood Park, Alberta *Lauren Kennedy \u2013 Ancaster, Ontario *Dana Kenny \u2013 Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island *Francois- Olivier Picard \u2013 Qu\u00e9bec, Quebec *Neha Rahman \u2013 Toronto, Ontario *Gabe Senecal \u2013 Melfort, Saskatchewan *Sara Wheale \u2013 Breton, Alberta *Justin Charles Wong \u2013 West Vancouver, British Columbia *Riley Yesno \u2013 Thunder Bay and Eabametoong First Nation, Ontario ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 establishments in Canada Category:Justin Trudeau Category:Government agencies established in 2016 Category:Government of Canada Category:Youth in Canada ",
