Exhibition about the life and works of Estell\u00e9s in Convento del Carmen (Carmen's Convent), Valencia, 2013 == Biography == Vicent Andr\u00e9s Estell\u00e9s was twelve years old when the Spanish Civil War broke out. During its course, he trained to become both a baker and a goldsmith, and learned to write on a typewriter. The war had a profound impact on his work, in which death is a recurring theme. Estell\u00e9s spent his teenage years in Valencia, where he developed an interest in literature. During that period, he was most influenced by Charles Baudelaire, Pablo Neruda, Paul \u00c9luard, Cesare Pavese, and Walt Whitman, Catalan poets such as M\u00e0rius Torres, Jacint Verdaguer, Josep Carner, Carles Riba, Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol and Joan Salvat-Papasseit, as well as the Valencian poet Ausi\u00e0s March and the Balearic poet Bartomeu Rossell\u00f3-P\u00f2rcel.

Although he is better known for his poetry, he also wrote novels, plays, screenplays, as well as his memoirs. The main themes of his work are death and sex, and they are always dealt with from a popular, everyday, simple, direct, and even vulgar perspective.Su poes\u00eda parte de unos elementos bien determinados: el mundo cotidiano y sus aspectos m\u00e1s vulgares, el di\u00e1logo con algunos autores predilectos (Ausi\u00e0s March, Garcilaso, Horacio, C\u00e1tulo y los poetas catalanes desde Carles Riba y Foix hasta Espriu y Ferrater) la vindicaci\u00f3n de un pueblo y de una lengua sometidos al silencio y, por encima de todo, la necesidad obsesiva de escribir para dejar constancia del mundo y de la experiencia del poeta, de catalogar la realidad en forma de palabras, y la exaltaci\u00f3n de las relaciones er\u00f3ticas como motivaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica de esta vida y \u00fanico enfrentamiento significativo con la muerte\". (Francesc Parcerisas, quoted in Reciclatge (Nivell superior), page 230. It is difficult to categorize his entire work. In fact, some works were reworked from books or private notes such as \"Manuscrits de Burjassot\" (the Manuscripts from Burjassot), \"Can\u00e7oner\" (Anthology) or \"Mural del Pa\u00eds Valenci\u00e0\" (Mural of the Valencian Country), from which he only published extracts or the poems he considered most appropriate. His first publications were \"Ciutat a cau d'orella\" (Whispered City) (1953), \"La nit\" (The Night) (1956), \"Donzell amarg\" (Bitter Youth) (1958) and \"L'amant de tota la vida\" (The Lifelong Lover) (1966), which are only a small selection of what he had written at that point. From the 1970s onwards, he published more frequently and received numerous awards. He published \"Lletres de canvi\" (Bills of Exchange)(1970), \"Primera audici\u00f3\" (First Audition) (1971), \"L'inventari clement\" (The Clement Inventory) (1971). In (1971) he published two major works: \"La clau que obri tots els panys\" (The Key That Opens All Locks) (which contained \"Coral Romput\" (Broken Coral)) and the best-seller \"Llibre de les meravelles\" (Book of Marvels), perhaps his most famous work. From that moment onwards, Estell\u00e9s began to gain recognition and published his Complete Works, including \"Recomane tenebres\" (I Would Recommend the Dark) (1972), \"Les pedres de l'\u00e0mfora\" (The Stones from the Amphora) (1974), \"Manual de conformitats\" (Manual of Conformities) (1977), \"Balan\u00e7 de Mar\" (Swing of the Sea) (1978), \"Cant temporal\" (Temporary Singing) (1980), \"Les homilies d'Organy\u00e0\" (Homilies of Organy\u00e0) (1981) which includes \"Coral romput\", \"Versos para Jackeley\" (Verses for Jackeley) (1983), \"Vaixell de vidre\" (Glass Ship) (1984), \"La lluna de colors\" (Colourful Moon) (1986), y \"Sonata d'Isabel\" (Isabel\u2019s Sonata) (1990). His most important prose works are \"El coixinet\" (The Little Cushion) (1988), his play \"L'oratori del nostre temps\" (The Oratory of Our Times) (1978), and his memoirs: \"Tractat de les maduixes\" (Strawberry Treaty) (1985), \"Quadern de Bonaire\" (Bonaire\u2019s Notebook) (1985), and \"La parra boja\" (The Crazy Vine) (1988). == Aesthetics == The three levels of oppression that are evident in his works are the reason why Estell\u00e9s's aesthetics have been described as \"irate\". * Personal oppression: He describes a vital situation in which persecution and humiliation are constant. This situation unavoidably requires being assertive and acting consequently. It shows love as a possibility of salvation and redemption. * Collective oppression: He describes a collective life characterized by economic misery, fear of being socially criticized, and a situation of ignorance devastating the people which he feels he belongs to. * National oppression: He describes a sense of despair \u2014 a particular sensitivity caused by cultural, linguistic, and national abduction. He is sensitive to the Valencian people's fight to dignify their own culture. Some of his most frequently recurring topics are death, love and eroticism, hunger and political oppression, as well as daily life. Put together, these themes provide a considerable formal and tonal variety. == Recognition == In 1993, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Valencia.Acto de Investidura como Doctor \u201cHonoris Causa\u201d del Excm. Sr. Dr. Vicent Andr\u00e9s Estell\u00e9s.

This piece, showing him sitting on a park bench, writing on top of a pile of books, has suffered four loutish attacks. For instance, it was covered in blue paint and the arms of his glasses were broken. Likewise, extreme right blavers attempted to destroy a bust of Estell\u00e9s that was put up in Burjassot in 1979. == Works set to music == Estell\u00e9s is one of the most popular Catalan-language poets among musicians. His works have been set to music several times, mostly by Ovidi Montllor. Montollr's version of the poem \"Els Amants\" (The Lovers) is especially remarkable \u2014 it has been performed live on many occasions.
