As well as exhibiting the museum's core collections, it also mounts summer temporary exhibitions (e.g. \"La diffusion des cultes \u00e9gyptiens et alexandrins dans le monde romain \u00e0 L'\u00c9gypte copte et l'\u00c9gypte musulmane\" and \"Le laraire d'Esprit Calvet\"), conferences and networking events, particularly for scholars. The museum is based at 27 rue de la R\u00e9publique in a 17th-century building, previously the chapel of the city's Jesuit College. It was begun in 1616, initially to plans by \u00c9tienne Martelange and then by Fran\u00e7ois de Royers de la Valfeni\u00e8re from 1620 onwards. de la Valfeni\u00e8re raised the walls as far as the nave's main cornice.Joseph Girard, op cit, .
