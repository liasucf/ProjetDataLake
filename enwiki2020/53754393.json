    "text": "Ernest J. Weinrib is a legal academic specializing in Jurisprudence and legal philosophy, specializing in private law. He teaches at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. ==Theories== Faculty of Law, University of Toronto. In Weinrib's theories he sees the world of private law (that is tort, contract and restitution) as being composed of \"bilateral relationships between individuals whereby one person's right is always a function of another person's duty.\"Peter Cane, Corrective Justice and Correlativity in Private Law, 16 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (1996) (3): 471. Because of this he argues that private law cannot explain factors like punitive damages and other remedies used for behavior modification. Private law he argues is an ends to itself and not a means to some other particularly political, economic or social change. The only purpose, he says, for \"private law, is to be private law\".Peter Cane, Corrective Justice and Correlativity in Private Law, 16 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (1996) (3): 471. Weinrib sees that private law \"regards the parties to a lawsuit as active and passive poles of the same injustice. The injustice [occurs] in a disruption of the parties\u2019 equality, whereby each party has what is rightfully his or hers.\"Anthony R. Sangiuliano, Book Notes: Corrective Justice, by Ernest J.
