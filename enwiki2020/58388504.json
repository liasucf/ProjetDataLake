    "text": "Joseph Dominic Frayne (26 February 18821939 England and Wales Register \u2013 11 December 1942) was a British trade union leader, who served as President of the Cardroom Amalgamation and Chair of the General Federation of Trade Unions. Frayne was born in Reddish and worked for several years as a stripper-and- grinder in a cotton mill in Stockport. He was active in the Stockport Card, Blowing and Ring Room Operatives' Association, and in about 1916, he was appointed as full-time secretary of the union. The union was affiliated to the Cardroom Amalgamation (CWA), and Frayne was accordingly appointed to its executive committee. He was held in high esteem by the members of the CWA and, despite Stockport being one of its smaller affiliates, he was elected as President of the Amalgamation in 1926, defeating Archie Robertson, and then W. H. Carr by 35 votes to 34 in the final round of voting. In 1932, Frayne's two sons, aged eight and five, drowned in a pond in Reddish, the older boy while trying to save the younger. Frayne stood down as president of the CWA in 1936 to served a two-year term as chair of the General Federation of Trade Unions. The following year, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He died in Manchester. ==References== Category:1882 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Stockport Category:Presidents of British trade unions Category:Presidents of the General Federation of Trade Unions (UK) Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Reddish ",
