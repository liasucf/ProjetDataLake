The album has one single: \"Don't Take My Funk\", featuring Catfish Collins and Bobby Womack. ==Critical reception== The album has been generally well received. Metacritic reported an overall rating of 68, with six \"positive\" and five \"mixed\" reviews. Daniel Ross of the BBC said the album was \"waking up a new generation to funk\u2019s heritage\", though he said that all the cameos made the album feel \"sluggish and bloated at times\". Betty Clarke of The Guardian gave the album 4/5 stars, reporting that the album was \"as close to the Mothership as it gets\". ==Track listing== By AllMusic and Music Thread. ==Notes== * Bootsy announced a world tour starting on May 3, 2011 on the back of the album, encompassing the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. * A limited edition copy of the album was released with an \"eye- popping\" 3-D holographic cover, making the album seem \"alive\", according to Bootsy. ==References== ==External links== * Bootsy Collins' Official Site Category:2011 albums Category:Bootsy Collins albums Category:Mascot Records albums ",
