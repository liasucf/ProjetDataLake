    "text": "Lescar Cathedral The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lescar (Latin: Dioecesis Lascurrensis; French: Dioc\u00e8se de Lescar; Basque: Leskarreko elizbarrutia), in south-western France, was founded in the fifth century, and continued until 1790. It was originally part of the Province of Novempopulania, and Lescar held the seventh place among the cities. Its see was the Cathedral of the Assumption in Lescar, begun in 1120; the crypt of the cathedral was also the mausoleum of the family of Albret in the 16th century.Gallia christiana I (1715), pp. 1283-1284. The bishopric was suppressed by the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution , in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in September 1790, as part of a systematic effort to eliminate redundant bishoprics in France. By the Concordat of 1801, struck by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the diocese of Lescar was not revived, and the territory of the diocese was divided between the diocese of Agen and the diocese of Bayonne.Lescar (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] ==Bishops of Lescar== ===to 1200=== * ? c. 506: Saint Julien I.The old prayer book (Breviarium) of the diocese of Lescar states that Julianus was a deacon of the Church of Trier, who was consecrated a bishop by St. Leontius of Trier (died 19 February 446, according to Gams, p. 318). The editors of Gallia christiana (I, p. 1285) argue that Julianus belongs at the beginning of the fourth century. The Breviarium says that Leontius was a native of Aquitaine, which may be a fact or a wish. The Martyrologicum Gallicanum (quoted by Dubarat at p. xviii) also says that Julian took part in the Council of Orange in 441. The name Julius does appear, but no bishopric is named: J.
