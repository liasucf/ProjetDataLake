As of 2007, its runway is serviced by two airlines, Satena,Servicio A\u00e9reo Territorios Nacionales SATENA which has three flights a week to and from Bogot\u00e1 and two flights a week to and from Villavicencio, and Air Colombia, which flies twice a week from the city of Villavicencio, through Barrancominas, Guain\u00eda and then arriving at In\u00edrida. This airline operates a Douglas DC-3 which makes the trip an entire adventure. However, the San Fernando de Atabapo airport in Venezuela is just 30 km away.

Traveling by the river it takes several hours, or even days, depending on the type of craft taken. ===Public transportation=== With the arrival of more and more people, a public transportation mechanism has been established. Around 500 auto rickshaws provide an efficient and inexpensive means of transportation. The standard fare (which covers almost all the destinations within the town) is around US $.50. There are also mini-vans available for large groups; the fare remains US $.50 per person. ==Notes== ==External links== * Official website of the Inirida municipality * Aerial photograph of Puerto In\u00edrida c.2000 * Asesoria Presidencial para Las Regiones: Puerto In\u00edrida Category:Municipalities of Guain\u00eda Department Category:Capitals of Colombian departments ",
