    "text": "\"All Ghillied Up\" is a level in the 2007 first-person shooter game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Taking place in Pripyat, Ukraine, it was designed by Mohammad Alavi, and is unusual for its stealth gameplay in a game that is otherwise action-oriented, and the choices it offers the player. During development, its enemy artificial intelligence was secretly added to the game due to its unusual complexity. \"All Ghillied Up\" has since been recognized by critics as one of the greatest levels in video games, being praised for its atmosphere and player freedom. The level is also included in the remastered version of the game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The name refers to the ghillie suits worn by the characters in the mission. == Level content == \"All Ghillied Up\" is the thirteenth level in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare single-player campaign. Set in Pripyat, Ukraine, the player's character proceeds through a timber building within a field, past a house, and through an abandoned church whilst taking out enemies with the assistance of Captain MacMillan. The player proceeds to another field where they encounter a platoon with tanks advancing across it. They hide from the enemies in the foliage using the ghillie suits in prone. They proceed past further areas containing inactive tanks, helicopters and shipping units whilst dealing with enemies. They encounter another platoon with helicopters and military vehicles. In stealth, they crawl under a series of military vehicles. Soon after, they traverse various buildings, including the famous Azure Swimming Pool, encountering wild dogs, culminating in them setting up in the abandoned Polissya hotel to prepare for an assassination. Throughout the level the player is presented with numerous choices, which MacMillan responds appropriately to. One instance of this is found near that start of the level, once the player passes the abandoned churchyard, MacMillan will warn of an enemy helicopter flying above telling the player get down. However, the player can choose to shoot the helicopter down using a FIM-92 Stinger found in the church and MacMillan will say \"now you're just showin' off.\" During other examples, MacMillan will criticize the player character when he ruins their cover, and correct them when the player aims at the incorrect target. ===Plot=== \"All Ghillied Up\" is presented as a flashback in which the player assumes control of Captain Price, as a lieutenant. Set in 1996, fifteen years before the events of the game, Price has to sneak across an irradiated wasteland in Pripyat, Ukraine with Captain MacMillan. Pripyat is a town near Chernobyl which was abandoned after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The mission ends with MacMillan and Price setting up in the abandoned Polissya hotel preparing for an assassination. The next mission, \"One Shot, One Kill\", concludes with a failed assassination attempt, a hurried retreat, and a final stand-off in front of the Pripyat amusement park ferris wheel. \"All Ghillied Up\" introduces parallels between Captain Price and the game's main player character Soap MacTavish. == Development == \"All Ghillied Up\" was designed by Mohammad Alavi, who also designed \"Crew Expendable\", another level in Modern Warfare, and \"No Russian\", a controversial level in the sequel Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The level was based on game mechanics used in Half-Life and Metal Gear Solid. In it, non-player characters (NPCs) react differently to the player based on distance and angle, rather than a simple proximity trigger. For example, a player might lie prone in the grass and an enemy will not notice them. This code was created in secret by Alavi due to the difficulty of explaining its intricacies to the AI programmer, who was already swamped with work. Alavi called the internal code \"garbage\", but said that it still \"did exactly what [he] wanted it to do\", and that he did not \"have to compromise on the feel of the gameplay\". It took Alavi three months and more than 10,000 lines of code to make the first minute of gameplay for the level. The lead designer, Steve Fukuda, played the first minute ten different ways and had fun each time, making Alavi consider it a success. The script was later used as the basis for the AI in Modern Warfare 2. == Reception == === Initial reception === Official Xbox Magazine Ryan McCaffrey appraised \"All Ghillied Up\" and noted it was the best level in the game and one of the best stealth levels in gaming. He commended the section where the player has to lie in a grassy field while a platoon, including tanks, walks past for its high tension. === Retrospective commentary === GB Buford of Kotaku called \"All Ghillied Up\" one of the best levels in video game history, citing its heavy freedom of choice in approaching the level. Comparing it to the game's previous level, \"Safehouse\", he remarked that while the player's commanding officer could be obeyed to get through the level successfully, the player could also win by disobeying his orders and he will still back up the player, rather than simply killing the player for failing to obey. He also complemented the \"incredibly tense\" prone section as implementing the mechanic in an interesting way. PC Gamer said \"All Ghillied Up\" was one of the strongest levels in Modern Warfare and that it \"demonstrates the real craft of a linear story-driven first-person shooter\". They went on to compare it to DayZ with its equally dramatic scenarios and allowing for \"personality and freeform set pieces\". IGN called the level one of the best stealth missions in games, and Digital Trends described it as among the greatest in any first- person shooter.\" Ars Technica Sam White compared the level's atmosphere and tension to that seen in the Fallout series. Sam Sant of Game Revolution said it was one of gaming's most iconic missions, also noting the ghillie suits worn in the mission were a fan favourite. PlayStation Official Magazine \u2013 UK called the level a \"stealth masterclass\" and considered it to be the greatest level in a first-person shooter and likely the best video game flashback of all time, particularly praising the pacing and level of player agency. In a 2019 poll of LADbible readers, \"All Ghillied Up\" was voted the best Call of Duty mission with 67% of the 6,180 votes, above \"Vendetta\" from World at War and \"Vorkuta\" from Black Ops. == Legacy == \"All Ghillied Up\" was referenced in the movie Hardcore Henry, whose director, Ilya Naishuller called it \"one of the best levels of all time\". In 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a soft reboot of the sub series, players can unlock the \"All Ghillied Up\" pack which allows players to wear a ghillie suit and wield a bolt-action sniper rifle, in camouflage with additional netting and silencer similar to that seen in the mission. == References == Category:Video game levels Category:Call of Duty Category:Chernobyl disaster in fiction ",
