In 1956, the courses moved to prefabricated buildings and temporary installations. The current lyc\u00e9e was built at the start of the 1960s. It is built to resemble a bird spreading its wings. There is a residential tower inside. For the school's name, Saint- Exup\u00e9ry was proposed and refused, as another lyc\u00e9e had also proposed this name. The question was then asked again and Rodin was eventually preferred, due to the fact that he was born and raised in the areaM. Deixonne, Le Lyc\u00e9e Rodin .Fonds F 17 bis, Archives de Fontainebleau. == Layout == The lyc\u00e9e Rodin, which also contains a college, can hold around students (currently around ). It is a general lyc\u00e9e, and prepares for ES, L and S. There are clubs, covering the socio-educational needs. This includes clubs for chess, cooking, English-language theatre, photography, yoga and cinema. Sports clubs for AS, college, and lyc\u00e9e include badminton, football, badminton, basketball, gymnastics, and climbing. Some participants take part in competitions. The \"History of Arts\" option was launched for the first time for L in 1993 and at secondary level in 1994. The lyc\u00e9e Rodin has been a pilot lyc\u00e9e for interdisciplinary teaching. The new reforms (2010) have removed old-style deterministic teaching, but the lyc\u00e9e Rodin maintains this teaching in the form of \"workshops\". This allows all students to attend lectures on methodical readings of works of art, and for future students from the first to final years to better approach their speciality programme (coefficient 6 of the bac). === Lyc\u00e9e ranking === In 2015, the lyc\u00e9e was ranked 73rd out of 109 at d\u00e9partemental level on quality of teaching, and 962nd at national level.Classement d\u00e9partemental et national du lyc\u00e9e. The ranking was based on three criteria: the level of bac results, the proportion of students who obtain a baccalaur\u00e9at having spent their last two years at the establishment, and \"added value\" (calculated based on social origin of students, their age, and their national diploma results).M\u00e9thodologie du classement national des lyc\u00e9es fran\u00e7ais. === CPGE rankings=== The national rankings for preparatory classes to grandes \u00e9coles (CPGE) are based on rates of admission to the grandes \u00e9coles. In 2016, L'\u00c9tudiant gave the following rankings for 2015 : {| class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"text-align:right\" ! Stream ! Students admitted to a grande \u00e9cole* ! Admission rate* !

In the 1970s, they went on strike every year. They took part in many strikes involving lyc\u00e9es, most recently in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. During the 2005 movement against the Fillon law, they were one of the most active establishments. Again, strongly active against the CPE in 2006, they reacted in 2007 against the LRU under the impetus of SUD Lyc\u00e9en activists, and took part in a strike of several months in 2008 against cuts in education posts. The newspaper Le Monde cited the school as an example of one of the most active. Aur\u00e9lien Boudon, head of national student coordination in 2009, and federal secretary of SUD \u00c9tudiant studied there between 2005 and 2008. The influence of Jeunesses communistes r\u00e9volutionnaires militants (the youth organisation of the LCR), then the \"youth section\" of the Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste, remains relatively important. During the 1990s, many militants of the Lutte ouvri\u00e8re came to talk and debate in front of the school entrance. == Alumni == * Jean-Paul Huchon, politician, President of the regional council of \u00cele-de-France since 1998. * C\u00e9dric Klapisch, director, actor, and producer. * Philippe Decoufl\u00e9, French dancer and choreographer. * Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota, actor, dramatists, and theatre director. * Jacno (Denis Quilliard), French composer and musician, founder of the punk group Stinky Toys. * Romain Duris, French cinema actor * Santiago Amigorena, director and writer * J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Mondon, composer and electronic music producer. * \u00c9ric Kristy, novelist and director. * Nathalie Nell, actress * R\u00e9gis Schleicher, member of terrorist organisation Action directe. * Didier Fran\u00e7ois, journalist * No\u00e9mie Lvovsky, actress and director. * Lomepal, rapper, singer, and skater. == Former teachers == * Jacques Borel, writer, Prix Goncourt 1965 for his novel L'Adoration (Gallimard). * Marc Ferro, historian, teacher of history/geography.Le Ressentiment dans l\u2019histoire: comprendre notre temps, par Marc Ferro, \u00e9ditions Odile Jacob, 2007. * Writer Le\u00efla Sebbar (Le\u00efla Pignon), French teacher. == Access == The access to the lyc\u00e9e is via line 6 on stations Corvisart or Glaci\u00e8re as well as on Bus (RATP) line .
