    "text": "The first election under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was a late election held June 15, 1913. Augustus Octavius Bacon was first elected by the Georgia Legislature in 1894. His most recent term had ended March 3, 1913, but the Legislature had failed to elect a successor. The Governor of Georgia then appointed Bacon to begin the term starting March 4, 1913. Bacon was re-elected in this late election, running unopposed. He would serve only until his death February 14, 1914, leading to another interim appointment and eventual special election. == See also == * 1912 and 1913 United States Senate elections == References == 1913 Georgia United States Senate ",
