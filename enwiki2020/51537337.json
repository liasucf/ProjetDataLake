    "text": "\u03b92 Normae, Latinised as Iota2 Normae, is a single, blue-white star located in the southern constellation of Norma. It is positioned to the west of Rigil Kentaurus but can be difficult to spot against the Milky Way. It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +5.57. Measuring its parallax reveals it is located away from the sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by an interstellar extinction factor of 0.24 due to intervening dust. The radial velocity of this star is zero, indicating it is neither moving toward nor away from the Sun. Iota2 Normae is a B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B9.5 V. It is larger than the Sun with 2.6 times the mass of the Sun and about 3.1 times the Sun's radius. The star is estimated to be 257 million years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 111 km/s. It is radiating approximately 40 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 10,593 Kelvin. ==References== ==External links== *Alcyone page Normae, Iota2 Category:Norma (constellation) Normae, Iota2 Category:Durchmusterung objects 144480 5994 079153 ",
