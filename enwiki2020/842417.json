The Old and the new, Bodedern, Anglesey Bodedern lies on the B5109, about east of its junction with the A4025 south of Llanfachraeth. About to the south, beyond the A55 road lie the villages of Caergeiliog and Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn. The Valley Wetlands, an area of lakes and marshes and a RSPB bird sanctuary, lie between these two villages. Bodedern is the closest village to the island's largest natural lake, Llyn Llywenan, which lies to the north. The parish church (St Edern's Church, Bodedern) dates from the 14th century and is a Grade II* listed building, being listed because it is considered a good example of a late medieval church with some fine interior fittings. Presaddfed Hall is a small grade II* listed country house which stands amongst woodlands to the north-east of the village at the southern tip of Llyn Llywenan. The main block was built in 1686 and is joined to an earlier block by a later block built in 1875. A walled garden lies to the east of the house Once the seat of the Lewis family, several of whom served as High Sheriff of Anglesey, it is now a country hotel. Presaddfed Burial Chamber is a pair of Neolithic chamber tombs located a short distance northwest of Bodedern near the southern end of Llyn Llywenan. The other scheduled monument within the community is an early Christian Cemetery, east if the village, which is thought to be the location of an ancient chapel, Eglwys Ederyn. The site, at which 114 burials were recorded, was excavated in 1971, revealing several stone cists, and a stone inscribed with the word 'Ercagni', now kept in Bodedern Church.. ==References== ==External links== * A Vision of Britain Through Time * British Listed Buildings * Genuki * Geograph * Office for National Statistics ",
