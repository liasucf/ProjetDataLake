    "text": "Stalheim is a village in the municipality Voss in Vestland county, Norway. The small village lies along the European route E16 highway in the northeastern part of the municipality. The village sits at a high point in the inner part of the N\u00e6r\u00f8ydalen valley which leads northeastwards towards the N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjorden. The highway runs through a series of tunnels to descend into the valley, although the old road Stalheimskleivi can still be used with its hairpin turns and 20% grade. The Stalheimsfossen waterfall is the most notable sight in the area. The view from Stalheim is well known from several paintings, in particular Johan Christian Dahl's painting Fra Stalheim from 1842. Sivlesteinen, a memorial of the poet Per Sivle, was raised by Noregs Ungdomslag and other organizations at Stalheim in 1909. ==History== In 1943 Lebensborn activity took over the use of Stalheim Hotel.Ho skulle bli Hitlers ideal-barn ==Media gallery== File:Dahl-Stalheim.jpg|Dahl's Fra Stalheim (1842) File:Sivlesteinen-Stalheim.JPG|Per Sivle memorial stone at Stalheim File:Stalheimskleiva.jpg|View of the old Stalheimskleiva road (with the hotel at the top) File:Stalheim Hotel and Naerodalen Hardanger Fjord Norway.jpg|View of the Hotel, looking down into the N\u00e6r\u00f8ydalen valley ==References== Category:Voss Category:Villages in Vestland ",
