    "text": "The Aldranser Bach is a small river at Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria. The source of the Adranser Bach is in a forest near Aldrans. It flows in northern direction to Ambras Castle. In the past, there was a public swimming pool that was fed by the Aldranser Bach. In the park of the castle the Aldranser Bach supplies the Grand Pond with fresh water and then flows further through Small Pond and the castle's park to Ambras, where it merges with the Lanser Bach that flows into the Inn River. The Aldranser Bach has a length of about . Aldranser Bach is classified as a protected area. ==Water quality== Due to the fact that the river flows through forested areas, it has an above-average water quality, and benefits from significant self-purification. In winter, the Aldranser Bach prevents the total freezing of the Grand Pond, which ensures a functioning habitat for the water birds and fishes that reside there throughout the year. ==Flora and fauna== Despite the small size of the river, it is inhabited by rare birds such as peacocks and herons. The upper portion of the river is too narrow to sustain life for fishes; they can be found in the lower course of the river. The river also flows through a narrow ravine named which ends in a waterfall. Grand Pond Category:Rivers of Tyrol (state) Category:Rivers of Austria ",
