While in Sweden, Hamilton won the championship's 2008 Sportsmanship Award, an award only given out to one male junior curler and one female junior curler. The next year, at the 2009 World Junior Championships held in the newly completed Vancouver Olympic Centre, they failed to defend their title, ending up with bronze medals. Hamilton and his juniors team also competed at the 2009 United States Olympic Trials, which doubled as that year's national championship, finishing in eighth place with a 3\u20136 record. For the 2009\u201310 season Hamilton returned to Jeremy Roe's team, as third.

Hamilton attended the combine but was not chosen as one of the ten male HPP curlers. John Shuster, three-time Olympian at that point, was also not chosen and in response created a new team nicknamed \"The Rejects\", bringing on Hamilton at second, fellow Olympian and combine reject John Landsteiner at lead, and Tyler George at third, who hadn't attended the combine due to his work. They maintained this line-up for four seasons and found great success. At their first National Championships together in , they defeated Hamilton's former skip Brown in the final to win the gold medal. Representing the United States at the in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Team Shuster missed out on the playoffs when they lost a tiebreaker to Finland's Aku Kauste. As a result of its success, Team Shuster was added to the High Performance Program for 2016.

Despite finishing in second, Team Shuster earned enough points throughout the season to secure their return trip to the . In Basel, Switzerland they defeated Japan's Yusuke Morozumi in the bronze medal match, earning the first World Men's medal for the United States since 2007. For the 2016\u201317 season they added Joe Polo, a former teammate of Shuster and George, as alternate and won the . At the , their third Worlds in a row, they lost in the bronze medal game against Team Switzerland, skipped by Peter de Cruz. Hamilton attended a second world curling championship this season, representing the United States at the 2017 World Mixed Doubles Championship after he and his sister and doubles partner Becca Hamilton won the US Championship. At the Worlds in Lethbridge, Alberta they won their group during the round-robin phase and were the second seed going into the playoffs but ultimately ended in tenth place. Early in his fourth season on Team Shuster, Hamilton won the 2017 United States Olympic Curling Trials with them and then a month later won the 2017 United States Mixed Doubles Curling Olympic Trials with Becca, earning his spot in both curling disciplines for his first Olympics. In the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, the US team lost four of its first six matches and needed to win all of its three remaining matches to qualify for the playoffs, but all of its remaining opponents (Canada, Switzerland, and Great Britain) were currently among the top four teams. Nevertheless, the US team won all three matches to finish the round-robin in third place with a record of 5\u20134. In the semifinals they defeated Canada's Kevin Koe, a two-time world champion, to reach the gold-medal match versus Niklas Edin's team representing Sweden. The gold-medal game was close through seven ends, with the score tied 5\u20135, but the United States scored five in the eighth end to set up a 10\u20137 victory. This was the first Olympic gold medal in curling for the United States. In the mixed doubles competition, the Hamilton siblings did not fare as well, finishing in sixth place with a 2\u20135 record. === 2018\u2013present: Post-Olympics === After the Olympics George took a break from competitive curling and Team Shuster replaced him at third with Chris Plys.

They defended their United States title at the 2020 United States Men's Championship, defeating Rich Ruohonen in the final to finish the tournament undefeated. The national title would have earned Team Shuster a spot at the final Grand Slam of the season, the Champions Cup, as well as the chance to represent the United States at the 2020 World Men's Curling Championship, but both events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their Champions Cup qualification will instead carry over to the 2021 Champions Cup. ==Personal life== Hamilton works as an R&D; technician for Spectrum Brands.
