    "text": "The 1900 FA Cup Final was an association football match between Bury and Southampton on Saturday, 21 April 1900 at the Crystal Palace stadium in south London. It was the final match of the 1899\u20131900 FA Cup, the 29th season of the world's oldest football knockout competition, and England's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, better known as the FA Cup. Bury and Southampton were both appearing in their first finals. Both teams joined the competition in the first round proper and progressed through four rounds to the final. As a member of the Football League First Division, Bury were exempt from the competition's qualifying phase. Southampton, as a member of the Southern League would normally have been required to pre-qualify but, as champions of the Southern League for three seasons in succession from 1896\u201397 to 1898\u201399, they were given byes through the qualifying phase to the first round. The final was watched by a crowd of 68,945 and Bury, leading 3\u20130 at half-time, dominated the match to win 4\u20130 with goals by Jasper McLuckie (2), Willie Wood and Jack Plant. Bury won the cup again in 1903 but that was their last appearance in the match. Southampton reached the 1902 final but were defeated by Sheffield United; they eventually won the cup in 1976. ==Background== The FA Cup, known officially as The Football Association Challenge Cup, is an annual knockout association football competition in men's domestic English football. The competition was first proposed on 20 July 1871 by C. W. Alcock at a meeting of The Football Association committee. The tournament was first played in the 1871\u201372 season and is the world's oldest association football competition. The 1900 match between Bury and Southampton at Crystal Palace was the 29th final and the last of the 19th century. Both teams were appearing in the final for the first time. Bury were members of the Football League First Division and, in the 1899\u20131900 league competition, amassed 32 points to finish in 12th position, only five points clear of the relegation placings. Southampton were members of the Southern League and had been its champions in each of the three previous seasons. In the 1899\u20131900 league, they had slipped to third place below new champions Tottenham Hotspur. Southern League teams normally had to qualify for the first round proper of the FA Cup but, as reigning champions of their league, Southampton were exempted from pre-qualification and were given byes to the first round. Bury's team between 1895 and 1907 was selected by a three-man committee but with club secretary Harry Spencer Hamer in charge of the team on match days. Southampton's club secretary Ernest Arnfield took charge of their team on match days. ==Route to the final== ===Bury=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\" !width=\"25\" | Round !width=\"90\" | Opposition !width=\"50\" | Score |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| First | Burnley (a) | 1\u20130 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Second | Notts County (a) | 0\u20130 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Second (replay) | Notts County (h) | 2\u20130 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Third | Sheffield United (a) | 2\u20132 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Third (replay) | Sheffield United (h) | 2\u20130 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Semi-final | Nottingham Forest (n) | 1\u20131 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Semi-final (replay) | Nottingham Forest (n) | 3\u20132 |- | colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:white;\"| Key: (h) = Home venue; (a) = Away venue; (n) = Neutral venue |} Bury entered the competition in the first round proper and played four matches en route to the final. All four of their opponents were other teams in the Football League First Division. In the first round, Bury were drawn away to Burnley, who were relegated at the end of the 1899\u20131900 league season. Bury won the tie 1\u20130 with a goal by Charlie Sagar before a crowd of 6,020. In the second round, Bury drew 0\u20130 away to Notts County at Trent Bridge. The replay at Gigg Lane was watched by a crowd estimated as over 4,400. Goals by Sagar and Willie Wood ensured a 2\u20130 victory. Bury were drawn away again in the third round to the FA Cup holders Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Bury held United to a 2\u20132 draw in front of 22,766 people, their goals scored by Jasper McLuckie and Wood. Another replay was necessary but local interest soared and a new attendance record was set at Gigg Lane with 20,139 cramming into the ground. It is believed that many more people broke in without paying or managed to watch by climbing the overlooking trees outside. Bury won the match 2\u20130 with goals by Jack Plant and Billy Richards. The semi-finals were staged at neutral venues and Bury were drawn to play Nottingham Forest, the only other First Division team left in the competition, at the Victoria Ground in Stoke-on-Trent. Team captain Jack Pray scored a fifteenth-minute penalty but the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw after a second penalty was missed. For the third time in this cup run, a replay was required, this time at Bramall Lane. The crowd in Sheffield was 15,000 but it was estimated that only 400 or so Bury supporters were able to make the trip as the match was on a Thursday evening. They were rewarded by seeing their team recover from a 2\u20130 deficit to win the match 3\u20132 after extra time. Forest scored twice in the first two minutes and it looked as if Bury were going out of the cup. They were able to prevent any more Forest goals before half-time and then Sagar pulled one back after 55 minutes. With five minutes remaining, McLuckie scored the equaliser and it was 2\u20132 at the end of normal time. The rule was that extra time must be played but the Forest players, perhaps not knowing this, made a protest. After 110 minutes, Sagar scored his second to secure a 3\u20132 win and take Bury to their first FA Cup final. ===Southampton=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\" !width=\"25\" | Round !width=\"90\" | Opposition !width=\"50\" | Score |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| First | Everton (h) | 3\u20130 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Second | Newcastle United (h) | 4\u20131 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Third | West Bromwich Albion (h) | 2\u20131 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Semi- final | Millwall Athletic (n) | 0\u20130 |- !scope=row style=\"text-align:center\"| Semi-final (replay) | Millwall Athletic (n) | 3\u20130 |- | colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:white;\"| Key: (h) = Home venue; (a) = Away venue; (n) = Neutral venue |} Like Bury, Southampton entered the competition in the first round proper and played four matches en route to the final. Whereas Bury were drawn away in each of the first three rounds, Southampton were always drawn at home. In their first round match at The Dell, they faced First Division Everton and achieved a surprise 3\u20130 win before a 10,000 crowd. Two of their goals were scored by former Everton player Alf Milward, the other by Archie Turner. In the second round, Southampton hosted First Division Newcastle United whom they had defeated at the same stage two years earlier. This match was played on Saturday, 10 February 1900 in wintry conditions. With the match goalless, Jack Farrell was forced to leave the pitch with a dislocated left collar-bone. Southampton played on with ten men until the 50th minute when referee Arthur Kingscott abandoned the match because of a heavy snowstorm. The sides met again the following Saturday before an 8,000 crowd. Roddy McLeod replaced the injured Farrell and scored twice in a convincing 4\u20131 victory. The other two goals were scored by Jimmy Yates and Archie Turner. The third round match was played only a week later against West Bromwich Albion, another First Division side. Turner and McLeod scored in a 2\u20131 victory. The crowd was 9,000. The semi-finals involved two teams in the First Division and two in the Southern League. The draw kept the leagues apart and guaranteed that a side from the Southern League would reach the FA Cup Final for the first time. Southampton's opponents were Millwall Athletic, who had just defeated Football League champions Aston Villa in the second replay of their third round tie which Dave Juson and David Bull have described as \"three epic confrontations\". To prepare for the semi-final, the Southampton players were sent to Buxton, a spa town, for a week's special training which began with a morning walk followed by a bath. The club secretary, Ernest Arnfield, explained the training routine to Chums magazine: The semi-final was played on Saturday, 24 March at the Crystal Palace which was also the venue for the final. A 30,000 crowd watched a goalless draw. The replay was the following Wednesday at Reading's Elm Park when a crowd of only 10,000 saw Alf Milward score two goals and Jimmy Yates one in a straightforward 3\u20130 victory which put Southampton through to their first appearance in the final less than 15 years after the club was founded. ==Match== ===Pre-match=== The Bury team and officials travelled to London on Thursday, 19 April, two days before the match. They stayed at the Tavistock Hotel in Covent Garden until the Monday following. With unusually sunny weather that April, there was a heatwave in London on matchday. Conditions were uncomfortable for both the players and the crowd of 68,945. According to one report, most of the crowd were \"rooting\" for Southampton, who were the first southern team to reach the final since 1883. The referee, Arthur Kingscott from Derbyshire, had officiated Southampton's game against Newcastle in the second round. Bury won the toss and decided to kick off with the sun behind them. ===First half=== The first half was dominated throughout by Bury. The match report in The Times ascribes their success to the method of the half-backs (Pray, Leeming and Rose) in feeding their own forwards and killing the Southampton game. From the start, the Bury forwards directed high crosses into the goalmouth to test the Southampton goalkeeper, Jack Robinson. After nine minutes, a cross from the right by Plant was converted by McLuckie into the first goal. Willie Wood added the second after 16 minutes, slotting home a loose clearance after Robinson had failed to hold a shot by Plant. Robinson then made two saves, but the match was over as a contest when McLuckie scored his second after 23 minutes \u2013 he received a pass from Wood and hit a shot which Robinson did not attempt to stop. ===Second half=== Southampton tried to recover in the second period when Milward and Harry Wood both had attempts on goal, but to no avail. The Times report says there was, at times, some evenness in the play though Bury with a clear lead \"played with a certain amount of leisure\". Bury scored the fourth and final goal with ten minutes of the match remaining. Robinson had conceded a corner when saving a shot by Jack Pray. The corner was taken quickly by Richards to Plant, who hit a hard shot along the ground which Robinson could not stop. According to Philip Gibbons, Bury's 4\u20130 win was a \"football lesson\" for the Southampton players. ===Details=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"2\"| |- !width=\"45\"| |- |GK || Fred Thompson |- |RB || Jack Darroch |- |LB || Tommy Davidson |- |RH || Jack Pray |- |CH || Joe Leeming |- |LH || George Ross |- |RW || Billy Richards |- |IR || Willie Wood |- |CF || Jasper McLuckie |- |IL || Charlie Sagar |- |LW || Jack Plant |- |colspan=4|Club secretary: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Harry Spencer Hamer |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=\"2\"| |- !width=\"45\"| |- |GK || Jack Robinson |- |RB || Peter Meechan |- |LB || Peter Durber |- |RH || Samuel Meston |- |CH || Arthur Chadwick |- |LH || Bob Petrie |- |RW || Archie Turner |- |IR || Jimmy Yates |- |CF || Jack Farrell |- |IL || Harry Wood |- |LW || Alf Milward |- |colspan=4|Club secretary: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Ernest Arnfield |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules * 90 minutes. * 30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. * Replay if scores still level. * No substitutes.

James made a speech recorded in The Times and began by saying it was a great honour to present the cup to the Bury team. Bury later reported that their cup final earnings amounted to \u00a3938 16s 6d with a further \u00a3350 1s 6d from their two semi-final games. The club had been struggling financially for the last two years so this was much-needed revenue. As the season ended, the club's debts of \u00a31,230 had become a credit balance of \u00a31,329. Reporting on the match, the Southampton correspondent for Athletic News described the team's performance as \"a weak, wavering, pitiable and lamentable show\" in which not one member of the team \"played up to his reputation\". The post-match reports agreed that defeat by a Football League side including two current England internationals (Sagar and Plant) was excusable, but the margin of defeat and Southampton's poor standard of performance were not. The Times said that Bury played splendid football to outclass their opponents, but Southampton's \"show was the worst seen for many years\". Twelve years later, the correspondent \"Recorder\" of the Southampton Pictorial claimed that there was an argument before the match between the English and Scottish players at Southampton about who should play as centre- forward. The Scottish players wanted Roddy McLeod but the English, who were a majority, wanted Jack Farrell. The Scottish players had doubts about Farrell's temperament and saw McLeod as a more selfless player. \"Recorder\" said that the dispute created disharmony in the team and one unnamed player allegedly said later that he gave up on the match because he could see that others were not trying. After the league season ended in May, both players left the club. Bury made one more appearance in the FA Cup Final when they defeated Derby County 6\u20130 in 1903. Southampton have played in four finals altogether: they lost to Sheffield United in 1902 and to Arsenal in 2003, but they won the cup in 1976 when they defeated Manchester United. ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * 1900 Category:1899\u20131900 in English football Category:Bury F.C. matches Category:Southampton F.C. matches Category:April 1900 sports events ",
