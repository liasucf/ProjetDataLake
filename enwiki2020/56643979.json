    "text": "Jane Marguerite Lindsley (later Marguerite Lindsley Arnold; October 2, 1901 \u2013 May 18, 1952) was the first woman to be appointed to a year-round park ranger position in the United States National Park Service. Lindsley had a ten-year career as a ranger and as a ranger-naturalist starting in 1921. ==Early life and education== Lindsley was born and raised in Yellowstone\u2014her father, Chester Lindsley, was the park\u2019s superintendent while it was transitioning from the Army to the NPS.Kaufman 1998, pg. 12 Growing up in Yellowstone gave Marguerite a unique opportunity to connect with the land.\"Marguerite Lindsley: the First Permanent Female Ranger.\" She received an education from her mother, Maude, at home for most of her life before college.Kaufman 1998, pg. 77Turner 2012, pg. 66 Lindsley attended Montana State College for her undergraduate degree.Kaufman 1998, pg. 78 By 1923, she had received her master\u2019s degree in bacteriology from the University of Pennsylvania and was working in a lab.Turner 2012, pg. 65Kaufman 1998, pg. 78 However, this job was not satisfying for Lindsley\u2014she quit her job, bought a motorcycle, and rode cross- country back to her home in Yellowstone to pursue a career there.Kaufman 1998, pg. 78 ==Career== In 1921, during her college years, Lindsley was first employed as a temporary ranger-naturalist in Yellowstone.Turner 2012, pg. 67 In 1925, after receiving her graduate degree and returning to Yellowstone, she became the first permanent female park ranger in the country.\"Marguerite Lindsley: the First Permanent Female Ranger.\" Some individuals, including Chief Inspector J.F. Gartland of the Department of the Interior, voiced strong opposition to the appointment of women rangers, and Lindsley noted that she felt pressure to perform well despite criticisms of her suitability for the position of a ranger: \"many still think that women's work should be inside and it is a problem sometimes to satisfy everyone even tho [sic] I may be qualified for the work in the field.\"Kaufman 1998, pg. 78-79 Regardless of these criticisms, Lindsley helped normalize women\u2019s positions in the NPS\u2014for example, because the NPS did not have an official ranger uniform for women, Lindsley designed her own.\"Marguerite Lindsley: the First Permanent Female Ranger.\" An adapted version of this uniform would be imitated by other women rangers and would eventually become standard. Lindsley worked alongside other pioneering women rangers and ranger-naturalists in Yellowstone, such as Irene Wisdom, Frieda Nelson, and Elizabeth Conard.Kaufman 1998, pg. 79 Lindsley performed a variety of jobs during her time as a ranger and a ranger- naturalist. Not only did she hold positions at information centers and museums at the park,\"Marguerite Lindsley: the First Permanent Female Ranger.\" but she also taught classes about the park,\"Marguerite Lindsley: the First Permanent Female Ranger.\" performed water testing,Turner 2012, pg. 67 and published field notes in Yellowstone Nature Notes.Kaufman 1998, pg. 78 ==Later Life== In 1928, Lindsley married fellow ranger Ben Arnold and began working park part- time during the summer season and writing for Nature Notes in the winter.Kaufman 1998, pg. 78 Their son was born in 1932.Kaufman 1998, pg. 78 ==Notes== ==References== Kaufman, Polly Welts.
