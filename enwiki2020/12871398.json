    "text": "\"800-pound gorilla\" is an American English expression for a person or organization so powerful that it can act without regard to the rights of others or the law. The phrase is rooted in a riddle joke: This highlights the disparity of power between the 800-pound gorilla and everything else. The term can describe a powerful geopolitical and military force, or, in business, a powerful corporate entity that has such a large majority percentage of whatever market they compete within that they can use that strength to crush would-be competitors. In law, the phrase occurs semi-(in)formally as a characterization of judges vs. courts; as in: \"Standard/Court Rule\" vs \"Gorilla/Judge Rule\".Offenkrantz and Lichter, \"Sua Sponte Actions in the Appellate Courts: The 'Gorilla Rule' Revisited\" The metaphor has been mixed, on occasion, with the metaphor of the elephant in the room.Stevens, Heidi. \"The 800-pound grammar gorilla,\" Chicago Tribune.
