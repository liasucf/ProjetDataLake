They would also introduce daily rates for child care centres. A referendum was forced after the Chamber of Commerce collected 1,179 signatures between 8 April and 11 May 2016. After validation, 1,144 were deemed valid, meeting the requirement of article 64 of the constitution for at least 1,000 signatures. The Landtag approved the holding of a referendum on 9 June by a vote of 13\u201312, making a referendum optional rather than compulsory. A second vote on an amendment by the Progressive Citizens' Party passing by 19 votes to six nonetheless agree on organising the referendum. The government set the date of the referendum on 14 June. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Choice !Votes !% |- |align=left|For||2,100||17.61 |- |align=left|Against||9,826||82.39 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||168||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||12,094||100 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||19,765||61.19 |- |align=left colspan=3|Source: Government of Liechtenstein |} ==References== Category:2016 referendums Category:2016 in Liechtenstein 2016 Category:September 2016 events in Europe ",
