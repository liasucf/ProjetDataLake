    "text": "The 1976 California Golden Bears football team was an American football team that represented the University of California, Berkeley during the 1976 NCAA Division I football season. Under head coach Mike White, the team compiled an overall record of 5\u20136 and 3\u20134 in conference. The quarterback and leader of the previous season's team was Joe Roth. Because of that outstanding season he was one of the Heisman Trophy candidates at the beginning of the season. He had a great start, however halfway through it his performance started to drop. Unknown to almost everyone, Roth was diagnosed with melanoma the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Only coach White and his closest friends knew about it. With Roth continuing to play he still had a strong season and was named an All-American. His last game was in January 1977 at an all-star game in Japan and he died several weeks later in Berkeley. His former locker is dedicated in his honor and the annual home game against UCLA or USC is known as the Joe Roth game. ==Schedule== ==Roster== *OT Ted Albrecht *LB Jeff Barnes *QB Fred Besana *PK Jim Breech *TE George Freitas *DB Anthony Green *LB Phil Heck *DB Ken McAllister *OG Greg Peters *QB Joe Roth *LB Burt Toler *WR Wesley Walker ==Draft picks== The following players were claimed in the 1977 NFL Draft. {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#121849;color:#F8E616;\" | Player || Position || Round || Pick || NFL Club |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | Ted Albrecht || Offensive tackle || 1 || 15|| Chicago Bears |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | Wesley Walker || Wide Receiver || 2 || 33 || New York Jets |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | Fred Besana || Quarterback || 5 || 115 || Buffalo Bills |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | Jeff Barnes || Linebacker || 5 || 139 || Oakland Raiders |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | Phil Heck || Linebacker || 11 || 297 || Denver Broncos |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | Greg Peters || Offensive guard || 12 || 332 || Dallas Cowboys |} ==References== California Category:California Golden Bears football seasons California Football ",
