    "text": "First edition (publ. Penguin Random House) Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations is a book by Amy Chua. It was published in February, 2018, and covers the topic of how loyalty to groups can be more important than ideology, and applies this idea to both failures of American foreign policy abroad and the rise of Donald Trump within the United States. == Reception== The book was criticised by The Guardian, which stated that it was \"a well-intentioned book that never quite comes together. The Financial Times stated that it was an important book, and supported Chua\u2019s argument \"that America\u2019s liberal elite has contributed to Trump\u2019s rise by failing to acknowledge its own sense of tribalism\"; it did, however, also state that it left the \"crucial question\" of how to create a \"non-tribal world\" unanswered. The book was praised by author J. D. Vance, a former student of Chua and author of Hillbilly Elegy, saying that \"Political Tribes is a beautifully written, eminently readable, and uniquely important challenge to conventional wisdom.\" == References == Category:Books by Amy Chua Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:Books about Donald Trump Category:American political books ",
