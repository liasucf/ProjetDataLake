    "text": "Combat Zones That See, or CTS, is a project of the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)Wikisource:DARPA Solicitation Number SN03-13: Pre-Solicitation Notice: COMBAT ZONES THAT SEE (CTS) whose goal is to \"track everything that moves\" in a city by linking up a massive network of surveillance cameras to a centralized computer system. Artificial intelligence software will then identify and track all movement throughout the city. CTS is described by DARPA as intended for use in combat zones, to deter enemy attacks on United States troops and to identify and track enemy combatants who launch attacks against U.S. soldiers. Civil liberties activists and writers of dystopian fiction believe that such programs have great potential for privacy violations, and have openly opposed the project. ==See also== *Information Awareness Office *Surveillance *VIRAT *Heterogenous Aerial Reconnaissance Team *Closed-circuit television *Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System *Autonomous real-time ground ubiquitous surveillance imaging system ==References== ==External links== *DARPA BAA 03-15 official project description and bid solicitation Category:DARPA Category:Military equipment of the United States Category:Surveillance Category:Research projects ",
