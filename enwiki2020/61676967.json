He wrote not only on Anglo-Saxon themes but also later English literature. His 1967, Grammar and meaning in poetry was awarded the 1968 William Riley Parker Prize. Commenting on his work Brown (1987) notes Greenfield's insistence, when looking at Anglo-Saxon texts, on \"the necessity of going back again and again to the text as source for interpretative strength.\" Brown, George H.
