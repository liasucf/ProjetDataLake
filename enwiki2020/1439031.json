    "text": "The Cernan Earth and Space Center is a public planetarium on the campus of Triton College in the Chicago suburb of River Grove. It is named for astronaut Eugene Cernan (1934-2017), who flew aboard the Gemini 9 and Apollo 10 missions and, as commander of Apollo 17, was the last astronaut to leave his footprints on the Moon. The Cernan Center's 93-seat dome theater houses a Konica-Minolta Super MediaGlobe II fulldome digital projector, a Voyager V-17OWC laser projection system, and numerous auxiliary projectors. Using this equipment, the Cernan Center presents a wide range of programs to persons of all ages who attend its special school and group presentations and weekend public programs. One Saturday night each month, the Cernan Center offers a Monthly Skywatch program that presents the latest news and discoveries in the fields of astronomy, space science, and geoscience. The Cernan Center also features Earth- and space-related exhibits, the Friends of the Cernan Center membership program, the Star Store gift shop, and a website (link provided below). ==References== ==External links== *Cernan Earth and Space Center Home Page *Cernan Center's Star Store Category:Planetaria in the United States Category:Museums in Cook County, Illinois Category:Science museums in Illinois Category:Gene Cernan ",
