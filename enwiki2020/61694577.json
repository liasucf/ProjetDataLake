The main headquarters for the Desert Training Center was Camp Young, this is where General Patton's 3rd Armored Division was stationed. Camp Bouse is located miles from Bouse, Arizona, just north of Arizona State Route 72 and about north of Interstate 10. deserttrainingcenter.com Camp Bouse Marker Database, 740th Tank Battalion, Daredevil Tankers Camp Bouse was built in August of 1943 by the 369th Engineer Battalion. Camp Bouse was home to a secret program to see if a very bright arc lamp could be used to temporary blind the enemy in battle at night. The Desert Training Center was built to prepare troops to do battle in North Africa to fight the Nazis during World War 2. When completed the camp had shower buildings, latrines, wooden tent frames, and a 500,000 gallon water reservoir. The top secret weapon was a 13 million candlepower carbon arc lamp mounted on US Medium Tank M3Canal Defence Light (CDL). Six Tank Battalions were selected for top secret project: Leaflet. The troops at the camp were not allowed to talk about their activities with those not in the camp program. In the end, it was decided that bright light would too quickly give away the M3 tanks position and that antitank rounds would hit the M3 tanks quickly. Troops that worked with the new secret weapon CDL, at Camp Bouse, were from the 526th Armored Infantry Battalion, the 554th Ordnance Heavy Maintenance Company, the 9th Tank Group and the 701st. Other units that trained at Camp Bouse were the 701st Tank Battalion, 736th Tank Battalion, 738th Tank Battalion, 739th Tank Battalion, 740th Tank Battalion and the 748th Tank Battalion, nicknamed \"The Rhinos\" trained at Camp Bouse. The troops were trained to fight in the North African campaign.
