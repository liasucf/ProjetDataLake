He was the second director of the Franckenschen Stiftungen, a collection of schools for orphans. ==Biography== Freylinghausen was born on 2 December 1670. He studied theology in Jena and in 1695 was his assistant in ministry at St. Ulrich's Church in Halle. At his death in 1739, he was priest of St. Ulrich and director of the orphanages and boarding schools.

His Geistreiches Gesangsbuch (Spiritual Songbook), a hymnal with 1500 old and new songs was known as \"Freylinghausen's Songbook\" abroad. ==Legacy== A melody from his main hymnal was combined with a modern text, when it appeared in the common German hymmal Gotteslob in 2013, the penitential song \"Zeige uns, Herr, deine Allmacht und G\u00fcte\" as GL 272. ==References== Category:1670 births Category:1739 deaths Category:German Baroque composers Category:18th-century classical composers Category:German classical composers Category:German male classical composers Category:18th-century German composers Category:18th- century male musicians ",
