    "text": "The smooth texture of this basaltic volcanic bomb is aphanitic. IUGS classification of aphanitic extrusive igneous rocks according to their relative alkali (Na2O + K2O) and silica (SiO2) weight contents. Blue area is roughly where alkaline rocks plot; yellow area where subalkaline rocks plot. Original source: * (ed.); 1989: A classification of igneous rocks and glossary of terms, Blackwell Science, Oxford. An aphanitic volcanic sand grain, with fine-grained groundmass, as seen under a petrographic microscope Aphanite, or aphanitic as an adjective (from the Greek \u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, \"invisible\"), is a name given to certain igneous rocks that are so fine-grained that their component mineral crystals are not detectable by the unaided eye (as opposed to phaneritic igneous rocks, where the minerals are visible to the unaided eye). This geological texture results from rapid cooling in volcanic or hypabyssal (shallow subsurface) environments. As a rule, the texture of these rocks is not the same as that of volcanic glass (e.g., obsidian), with volcanic glass being non-crystalline (amorphous), and having a glass-like appearance.Bates and Jackson, 1984, Dictionary of Geological Terms, 3rd ed., Prepared by the American Geological Institute Aphanites are commonly porphyritic, having large crystals embedded in the fine groundmass or matrix. The large inclusions are called phenocrysts. They consist essentially of very fine-grained minerals, such as plagioclase feldspar, with hornblende or augite, and may contain also biotite, quartz, and orthoclase. ==Common rocks that can be aphanitic== * Andesite * Basalt * Basanite * Dacite * Felsite * Phonolite * Rhyolite * Trachyte ==References== Category:Aphanitic rocks Category:Igneous petrology Category:Volcanic rocks Category:Subvolcanic rocks ",
