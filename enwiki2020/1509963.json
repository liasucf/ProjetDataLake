    "text": "Frank Alain James Leboeuf (, born 22 January 1968) is a French actor, sports commentator and former French international footballer who played as a centre back. With the French national team, Leboeuf won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2000 European Championship as well as a number of domestic trophies, most famously during his 5 years at Chelsea. Since the conclusion of his playing career, Leboeuf has transitioned to acting, appearing in stage and film productions. ==Club career== Leboeuf was born in Marseille FFF Statistics and raised in Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer. He was introduced to football by his father, a former Stade Rennais coach, who trained children in the sport. After starting his career in 1986 in the lower divisions of the French leagues, Leboeuf moved to Laval in 1988. In 1991, he moved to Strasbourg and played there until 1996, when he made a switch to English club Chelsea for \u00a32.5m. He played over 200 games for the club and scored 24 goals, mainly from penalties and set pieces. With Chelsea, he won two FA Cups, one League Cup and one Cup Winners' Cup. He left in 2001 for club Olympique Marseille, before finishing out his career in Qatar. ==International career== For France, Leboeuf was capped 50 times, scoring four goals. Although he was mainly a substitute in the 1998 World Cup, he stepped in for red carded Laurent Blanc to play in the final, a 3\u20130 win against Brazil, a match in which he famously man-marked Ronaldo. In the final Ronaldo was able to make only a couple of his trademark runs thanks to Leboeuf's defensive performance. Leboeuf received a winner's medal at Euro 2000. He then played at the 2002 World Cup. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list France's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=7|International goals |- ! # !! Date !! Venue !!
