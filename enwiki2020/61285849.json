On 18 January 2000, accompanied by Dutch soldiers and UNMIK police, he entered the Suhareka Municipal Council offices of Haki Gashi under the pretence that the offices were to be commandeered for his use.

Following this, he was appointed as UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in El Salvador and Belize. Shortly after his appointment, he's quoted as saying: > It's hard to say, but 71 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, is unacceptable. > The Salvadoran people do not deserve it. It's a war. If an analysis is made > of the period of the war in El Salvador, there are currently more deaths per > year than during the years of the conflict. It is an intense war with a very > complex appearance and features. > There is analysis, there are diagnoses ... an exaggeration of diagnoses on > the subject of violence in El Salvador. But what must be done is to > seriously address from the preventive and repressive point of view this > phenomenon, because it is unacceptable the homicide rate is unacceptable. > Equally unacceptable is homicide against women ... Everyone deserves > respect, but women deserve more respect. In April 2015, at a conference entitled UN Agencies Addressing The Larger Issues he said: > The whole issue of poverty actually is really all these dimensions, from > health, education, is really what we are here to support the state and > society to work on. It's to establish policies that enable us the private > sector to be competitive in a market place that is not Belizean, but its > regional and its global. He was replaced in the role of UN Coordinator by UNICEF's Gordon Jonathan Lewis, whilst Stefano Pettinato, took on the UNDP role. He was appointed by Helen Clark, UNDP Administrator as her Special Representative to UNDP's Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People on 27 May 2015 to replace Frode Mauring who had served in that role from February 2011.

Of these 10 are UN volunteers, 74 are UNDP staff and the remainder are on service contracts. As head of the office, he represents UNDP at the most senior level in the occupied Palestinian territory with overall responsibility for operational management of activities under the Administrators guidance. At that appointment he was quoted as saying: > I feel privileged by the opportunity of serving again in the West Bank, > including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip in my new capacity as UNDP Special > Representative, UNDP will continue supporting the Palestinian people in > fulfilling their own aspirations and improving their lives.
