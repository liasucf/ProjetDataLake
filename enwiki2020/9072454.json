The lake is situated on the mainland between the small villages of Degnepoll and Tenneb\u00f8, just east of the town of M\u00e5l\u00f8y. The Norwegian national road 15 highway runs near the southern shore of the lake. Degnepollvatnet is a popular spot for fishing and swimming during the summer. During the winter, the lake is widely used for ice skating, but the most recent winters have not provided adequate cold weather for it to freeze. The lake has been used as a source of drinking water. ==See also== *List of lakes in Norway ==References== ==External links== * Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate Category:Kinn Category:Lakes of Vestland ",
