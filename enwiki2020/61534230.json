    "text": "Comeback is the fourth and final studio album by German all-female pop-rap band Tic Tac Toe, released in 2006 by A One Entertainment. The album was their first in nearly a decade recorded in the original line-up, after Ricarda \"Ricky\" W\u00e4ltken had re-joined the band. The album was preceded by the single \"Spiegel\" in 2005 which became a top 10 hit in German-speaking countries. However, the second and final single, \"Keine Ahnung\", was a commercial failure and did not enter any charts. The album itself was a moderate top 40 chart success. == Track listing == == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2006) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) |align=\"center\"|26 |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (European Top 100 Albums) |align=\"center\"|73 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany (Media Control) |align=\"center\"|25 |- |align=\"left\"|Switzerland (Swiss Hitparade) |align=\"center\"|43 |} == References == Category:2006 albums Category:German-language albums Category:Tic Tac Toe (band) albums ",
