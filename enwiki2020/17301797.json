    "text": "Alex Rodr\u00edguez (born May 18, 1971) is a Mexican film editor with more than twenty film credits. Rodr\u00edguez was born in Saint-Martin-d'H\u00e8res, France. He has edited several films directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, commencing with Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n (2001). He and Cuar\u00f3n were nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing for the film Children of Men (2006). The critic Wesley Morris described their work as follows: \"'Children of Men' has a blistering immediacy that's singular in this age of rapid cutting. Along with Alex Rodr\u00edguez, Cuar\u00f3n cut the picture himself, and while he uses digital effects as enrichment, he builds scenes within the camera's frame rather than just in an editing room. So the film is as theatrical as it is cinematic.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican film editors ",
