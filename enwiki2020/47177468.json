    "text": "The Dr. Clay House is a historic house at Walnut and Center Streets in Leslie, Arkansas. It is a 1-1/2 story, with irregular massing that includes a main block with a hip roof, a projecting front gable, and a rear addition. A shed- roof porch extends across the front, with turned posts and balustrade in a fanciful Folk Victorian style. Built in 1907 for a local doctor, it is the city's finest example of this style. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Searcy County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1907 Category:Houses in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Searcy County, Arkansas ",
