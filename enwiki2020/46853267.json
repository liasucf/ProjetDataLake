Because of the nature of maritime travel, there is often a substantial loss of life. This list covers those disasters where 30 or more lives were lost. ==Peacetime disasters== Many maritime disasters happen outside the realms of war. All ships, including those of the military, are vulnerable to problems from weather conditions, faulty design or human error. Some of the disasters below occurred in periods of conflict, although their losses were unrelated to any military action. The table listings are in descending order of the magnitude of casualties suffered. {|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" |- !data-sort-type=\"number\" |Year ! width=\"115\" |Country !Description !data-sort-type=\"number\" |Deaths !class=\"unsortable\" |Image |- | 1865 | | \u2013 On 27 April 1865 this Mississippi riverboat, steaming north with an excessive number of passengers on board, suffered a series of boiler explosions. 1,168 of her 2,137 passengers died in the ensuing fire or from drowning. | 1,168 | 125 px |- |1822 || China | \u2013 The Chinese junk was bound for Batavia, Dutch East Indies.
