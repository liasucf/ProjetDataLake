Sohail Tanvir, an uncapped allrounder, replaced him. Misbah-ul-haq was a controversial selection ahead of Mohammed Yousuf. Yet Misbah ended up being the 2nd highest run scorer in the competition. {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- style=\"background:#aad0ff;\" !width=5%|No. !width=20%|Player !width=18%|Date of birth !width=6% | T20s !width=6%|Batting !width=20%|Bowling style !width=25%|First class team(s) |- || 18 || Shoaib Malik (c) || 1 February 1982 || 4 || Right || Right arm off break || PIA/Sialkot Stallions |- || 36 || Abdur Rehman || 1 March 1980 || 2 || Left || Slow left arm orthodox || HBL/Sialkot Stallions |- || 25 || Fawad Alam || 8 October 1985 || 1 || Left || Slow left arm orthodox || NBP/Karachi Dolphins |- || 21 || Iftikhar Anjum || 1 December 1980 || 1 || Right || Right-arm medium || ZTBL/Islamabad Leopards |- || 23 || Kamran Akmal || 13 January 1982 || 4 || Right || Wicket-keeper || NBP/Lahore Lions |- || 22 || Misbah-ul-Haq || 28 May 1974 || 2 || Right || Right arm leg break|| SNGPL/Faisalabad Wolves |- || 26 || Mohammad Asif || 20 December 1982 || 2 || Left || Right-arm fast medium || NBP/Sialkot Stallions |- || 88 || Mohammad Hafeez || 17 October 1980 || 3 || Right || Right arm off break || SNGPL/Faisalabad Wolves |- || 1 || Salman Butt || 7 October 1984 || 2 || Left || Right-arm off spin || NBP/Lahore Eagles |- || 10 || Shahid Afridi || 1 March 1980 || 3 || Right || Right arm leg break || HBL/Karachi Dolphins |- || 33 || Sohail Tanvir || 12 December 1984 || 0 || Left || Left-arm medium fast || Attock/Rawalpindi Rams |- || 55 || Umar Gul || 14 April 1984 || 1 || Right || Right-arm fast medium || HBL/Peshawar Panthers |- || 27 || Yasir Arafat || 12 March 1982 || 1 || Right || Right-arm medium || KRL/Rawalpindi Rams Sussex Sharks |- || 75 || Younis Khan || 29 November 1977 || 4 || Right || Right arm leg break || HBL/Peshawar Panthers Yorkshire Phoenix |} ===Scotland=== {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- style=\"background:#aad0ff;\" !width=5%|No. !width=20%|Player !width=18%|Date of birth !width=6% | T20s !width=6%|Batting !width=20%|Bowling style !width=25%|Domestic team |- || 27 || Ryan Watson (c) || 12 November 1976 ||0 || Right || Right-arm medium fast || Forfarshire |- || 4 || John Blain || 4 January 1979 || 0 || Left || Right- arm fast medium || Rotherham Town |- || 23 || Dougie Brown || 29 October 1969 || 0 || Right || Right-arm fast medium || Warwickshire Bears |- || 24 || Gordon Drummond || 21 April 1980 ||0 || Right || Right-arm medium fast || Watsonians |- || 37 || Gavin Hamilton || 16 September 1974 || 0 || Left || Right-arm medium fast || East Brierley |- || 10 || Majid Haq || 11 February 1983 || 0 || Left || Right arm off break || Ferguslie |- || 8 || Ross Lyons || 8 December 1984 || 0 || Left || Slow left arm orthodox || Clydesdale |- || 25 || Neil McCallum || 22 November 1977 || 0 || Right || || Grange |- || 5 || Gregor Maiden || 22 July 1979 || 0 || Right || Right arm off break || Grange |- || 17 || Dewald Nel || 6 June 1980 || 0 || Right || Right-arm medium fast || Greenock |- || 28 || Navdeep Poonia || 11 May 1986 || 0 || Right || Right- arm medium fast || Warwickshire Bears |- || 22 || Qasim Sheikh || 30 October 1984 || 0 || Left || Left-arm medium || Clydesdale |- || 55 || Colin Smith ||27 September 1972 || 0 || Right || Wicket-keeper || Aberdeenshire |- || 12 || Fraser Watts || 5 June 1979 || 0 || Right || || Greenock |- || 99 || Craig Wright || 28 April 1974 || 0 || Right || Right-arm medium || Greenock |} ==See also== *2007 ICC World Twenty20 *2007 ICC World Twenty20 officials ==Notes== ==External links== *CricketArchive \u2013 2007 ICC World Twenty20 competition page *Cricinfo \u2013 2007 ICC World Twenty20 competition page *Cricinfo \u2013 Squad overview *T20 cricinfo-The home of T20 Cricket Squads, 2007 Icc World Twenty20 Category:Cricket squads Category:ICC T20 World Cup squads ",
