According to the book, in the very first years of the United States, the Continental Congress granted a \"perpetual\" Charter to a secret \"Commonwealth\" of privateers, which was founded during the American Revolution and rendered useful service to the young US. In later years, however, these \"privateers\" (in fact, pirates) acted mainly for their own private benefit, engaging in manifestly illegal activities while relying on that original Congressional authorization, and strongly resisting any attempt to disband them. In fact, all four US Presidents who were assassinated while in office - Abraham Lincoln in 1865, James A. Garfield in 1881,William McKinley in 1901 and John Kennedy in 1963 - had tried to oppose this \"Commonwealth\" and were assassinated as a direct result; the pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated them into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like Woodrow Wilson during WWI and Franklin Roosevelt in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role, and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. In the book's present, this \"Commonwealth\" of privateers/pirates remains active into the 21st Century, and wield considerable power behind the scenes. They no longer derive their profits from outright piracy on the high seas, having shifted into up-to-date lucrative forms of organized crime. But their leader, on board his private yacht, maintains \"the old pirate traditions\" such as \"walking the plank\" (in an early chapter, this is applied to an unlucky accountant whom the pirate leader wrongly suspected of betrayal). The current President, Cotton Malone's ultimate boss, is determined to put an end to this criminal \"Commonwealth\" (and not let himself be assassinated in the process). But first, Malone must complete the delicate task of locating a page torn from the 18th Century Congressional Record, recording the authorization given to the \"Commonwealth\". Malone must follow a convoluted trail from the museum in Thomas Jefferson's estate at Monticello, where the Founding Father left a message in code of which the numerous visitors are not aware, and leading to a mysterious seaside cave on a desolate shore, where a glass panel protects an ancient document from the fury of the breaking waves. Only once that centuries-old Congressional authorization been located and destroyed, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, is the President free to act decisively and break up the modern pirates. ==References== ==External links== * *History Matters, the Steve and Elizabeth Berry foundation to preserve historical sites *Biography at Bookreporter.com *Modern Signed Books BlogTalkRadio Interview with Rodger Nichols about The 14th Colony May 2016 Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Novelists from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People from St. Augustine, Florida Category:21st-century American novelists Category:People from Camden County, Georgia Category:American male novelists Category:American male short story writers Category:21st-century American short story writers Category:21st-century American male writers ",
