    "text": "Joe Barry (born July 5, 1970) is an American football coach who is assistant head coach and linebackers coach for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). Barry is the son of former Detroit Lions offensive line coach Mike Barry, and the son-in-law of Las Vegas Raiders defensive-line coach Rod Marinelli. ==Coaching career== Barry played linebacker at the University of Michigan from 1989 to 1990 before transferring to the University of Southern California. Prior to coaching in the NFL, Barry held coaching positions in college football at Northern Arizona, UNLV, and USC. At a press conference on December 21, 2008, following the Lions' 42\u20137 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Detroit News sports columnist Rob Parker addressed a question about Barry to Rod Marinelli, inquiring whether Marinelli wished that his daughter had \"married a better defensive coordinator.\" (Barry was the Lions' defensive coordinator at the time.) The question was criticized as unprofessional and inappropriate. The next day, Parker wrote that the comment was \"an attempt at humor\" and not a malicious attack. Parker has not written for the Detroit News since, and has not attended any press conferences since the incident, including the one Marinelli gave following his dismissal as head coach of the Lions. On January 6, 2009, the Detroit News announced that Parker had resigned from the newspaper the previous week.Detroit News Columnist Who Insulted Coach Quits SI.com, January 6, 2009 Barry signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars as linebackers coach.
