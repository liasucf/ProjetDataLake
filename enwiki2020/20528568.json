It is located approximately south of central Copenhagen on the island of Amager. Neighbouring settlements include the Copenhagen suburb of Sundbyvester to the north and Kastrup to the south. Copenhagen Airport is situated to the east of T\u00e5rnby. It includes the islets Saltholm and Peberholm. ==History== While there's no clear date for the founding of T\u00e5rnby, archaeological expeditions prior to the building of the \u00d8resund Bridge suggests that the first traces of T\u00e5rnby have originated around the 12th century, around a farm from which the village grew. In the 16th century the Danish King Christian II invited Dutch settlers to Amager. Because of this, T\u00e5rnby, like the neighbouring city Drag\u00f8r, also has small traces of Dutch history and culture.http://taarnbybib.dk/forside/stads- _og_lokalarkivet/hvad_er_lokalhistorie/trnby_historie In 1970, T\u00e5rnby also became the administrative division of the adjacent city of Kastrup, as part of a larger reform of the Danish counties.:da:Tidslinje for Danmarks historie ==Geography== The town is situated in the island of Amager, close to Drag\u00f8r, in the southern suburbs of Copenhagen and is part of the capital's urban area. The terrain is quite flat and doesn't rise more than 8 meters (appr. 26 feet) above sea level. T\u00e5rnby also incorporates the islands of Saltholm and Peberholm, natural and artificial respectively, both situated in the \u00d8resund Strait. While T\u00e5rnby has a history of farming, it has been almost completely urbanised, leaving only small traces of farmland in the southernmost parts.T\u00e5rnby Kommune historie (danish) The westernmost part of the municipality contains Amager F\u00e6lled, a protected wildlife and recreational area. As such, the area is primarily used for birdwatching and various recreational activities.
