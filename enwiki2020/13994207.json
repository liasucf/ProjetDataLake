    "text": "Eugene McGuigan, C.S.Sp. was the first athletic director of Duquesne University, serving in that capacity from 1920 until 1923. Known on campus as \"Father Mac,\" McGuigan also coached baseball, football, and basketball. ==Men's basketball== McGuigan was the Duquesne Dukes men's basketball coach from 1914 to 1920 and again from 1921 and 1923. During his overall tenure as coach, the Dukes garnered 66 wins and 35 losses, a .653 win percentage. Aiming to avoid the association of the name of a Holy Ghost father with the perceived rowdiness of the game of basketball, Father McGuigan was dubbed \"Coach Gene Martin\" in newspaper reports. ==References== Category:Year of death missing Category:Year of birth missing Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American Roman Catholic priests Category:Duquesne Dukes athletic directors Category:Duquesne Dukes baseball coaches Category:Duquesne Dukes men's basketball coaches Category:Holy Ghost Fathers ",
