It is among the earliest examples of a stone donjon or keep, which would become a common feature of later Norman castles in various parts of Europe. The construction of the donjon dates to around 1000 AD;Gravett, Christopher (2004), Norman Stone Castles (2): Europe, 950-1204, Osprey Publishing, (p. 12) it was constructed by an architect named Lanfred (or Lansfred, Lanfrai) under the orders of Count Rodulf of Ivry (French: Raoul d'Ivry). Following Orderic Vitalis, Rudolf's wife, Aubrey or Aubr\u00e9e, is said to have had the architect beheaded, so that he couldn't build a similar castle for another warlord. The donjon has marked similarities with later Norman castle keeps, in Normandy notably Avranches, and in England notably Colchester Castle and the White Tower at the Tower of London; it has been suggested that Ivry was the model for these buildings.Radford, David and Gascoyne, Adrian, Colchester, Fortress of the War God: an Archaeological Assessment, Oxbow Books, (Chapter 10). \"...an early 11th century predecessor for Colchester and the White Tower has been identified at Ivry-la-Bataille near Evreux in Normandy (Impey and Parnell 2000, 19). The castle was reconstructed several times up to the 15th century and was repaired by Philibert de l'Orme in 1553. Only ruins now remain, but form an attractive walk overlooking the valley of the River Eure. It is an official historical monument of France (MHC). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Castles in Eure Category:Ruined castles in France Category:Monuments historiques of Normandy ",
