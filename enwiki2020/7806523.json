    "text": "Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) is a medical college in New Delhi, India affiliated to University of Delhi and run by the Delhi government. It is named after Indian freedom fighter and first education minister of independent India Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. It was established in 1959 at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg near Delhi Gate. Four hospitals attached to MAMC have a combined bed strength of 2800 beds and cater to millions in Delhi alone and many more from the surrounding states in north India. The college is a tertiary care referral centre and has teaching programs for graduate and postgraduate degrees and residency and subspecialities/fellowships (referred to as superspecialities in India). == History == MAMC at Night. The history of Maulana Azad Medical College can be traced to 1936, when India was under British rule. During that time, Indian Medical Service was being heavily manned by the British. In 1940, Martin Melvin Curickshank of the Indian Medical Service (IMS) was appointed Medical Superintendent of Irwin Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of New Delhi. He was appointed specifically to establish a medical college complex near Ramlila Maidan. But before his plans could come to fruition, the Second World War started in 1939 and the plan of a new medical college had to be dropped. During the Second World War, some barracks were rapidly constructed near Safdarjung's tomb to establish a medical centre for American troops fighting in this region. That hospital was well equipped, with x-ray machine, a laboratory, and other facilities for various emergency procedures. After the Second World War was over, America handed over the hospital to Indian government and it is now known as Safdarjung Hospital. Later a medical college was started there by Central Government Health Scheme of the Health Ministry. MAMC made a very humble beginning in 1958 at the erstwhile Irwin hospital (now the Lok Nayak Jay Prakash Hospital). The foundation stone for the new buildings of the college was laid in October 1959 by Govind Ballabh Pant at the 30 acre land of the old Central Jail which was not in use. ==Courses offered== Four hospitals \u2013 Lok Nayak Jay Prakash Hospital, GB Pant Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research, Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences and Guru Nanak Eye Centre \u2013 are situated in the college campus and attached to the college. These make available 2800 beds, 7200 daily outpatient attendance and 47 operation theatres for the patients and for the medical students to learn. It caters to 290 undergraduate students, 245 post graduate and post doctoral students per year being trained by 426 faculty members and 810 resident doctors. The medical college offers MBBS and MD and MS degrees and postgraduate residency courses for super-speciality / sub-specialty fellowship degrees of MCh and DM. Institutes offering degrees in nursing and pharmacy are also attached to the college. There are more than 30 courses being offered in MAMC in the Medical Stream. Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, a sister institute, located within the camps provides courses in super specialties and basic subjects. Post Doctoral courses in Pediatric surgery and Neonatology are available at MAMC. Post Doctoral courses in other specialties like GI Surgery, Cardiology etc are available at GB Pant Hospital. == Ranking == MAMC Delhi was ranked 17th among medical colleges in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework in 2020.
