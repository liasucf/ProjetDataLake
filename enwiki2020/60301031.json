    "text": "The water crisis in Metro Manila, Philippines is the ongoing crisis that affected most of the households with a water interruption. The crisis usually occurs in dry season from March to May. The water suppliers, Manila Water and Maynilad, held responsibility for the crisis. == Crisis == === Water shortages === On March 15, 2019, different sectors rallied in front of MWSS regarding the water shortage. On March 6, 2019, about ten thousand households across Metro Manila began to lose water supplies. On March 11, the water level in La Mesa Dam reached 68.93 masl, below its critical level of 69 masl. Manila Water COO Geodino Carpio cited the delay of water infrastructure projects, such as the constructions of a wastewater treatment plant in Cardona, Rizal and the Kaliwa Dam in Tanay, Rizal, for the issue. Manila Water also noted the critically low levels of the reservoir held by La Mesa Dam, its lowest level in 12 years, which the company relies on as their emergency supply of water source. The affected residents have to wait in queue and for the arrival of the fire truck to obtain water for basic needs. On March 20, President Rodrigo Duterte threatens to terminate the contract with Manila Water and Maynilad amidst the water crisis. On March 22, 2019, it was reported that the Manila \"was finally able to improve water availability to 96 percent.\" === Water interruptions === Due to low levels of water sources in Angat Dam and Ipo Dam, rotational water interruptions will likely to occur at any time (with the prior announcements from the water supplier) across Metro Manila. Other consumers had to wake up early in the morning to obtain the water for basic needs.MWSS kinalampag dahil sa serye ng water interruption ng Maynilad, Manila Water | TV Patrol (October 24, 2019).
