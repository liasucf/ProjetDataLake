    "text": "The Battle of Sangamner was fought between the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire in 1679. This was the last battle in which the Maratha King Shivaji fought. The Mughals had ambushed Shivaji with a large force when he was returning from the sack of Jalna. The Marathas engaged in battle with the Mughals for three days but lost to the Mughals. Shivaji successfully escaped while the combat continued until Maratha general, Sidhoji Nimbalkar was killed alongside 2,000 Maratha soldiers and Santaji Ghorpade finally took to flight after being routed. Shivaji returned to Raigad safely early in december that year.Sardesai G.S., New History of the Marathas Volume 1, pg.254 https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.32141/page/n265/mode/2up ==References== Sangamner Sangamner Category:1665 in India Sangamner \\ ",
