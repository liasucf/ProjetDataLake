    "text": "The Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award, known until 2009 as the Mary Woodard Lasker Public Service Award, is awarded by the Lasker Foundation to honor an individual or organization whose public service has profoundly enlarged the possibilities for medical research and the health sciences and their impact on the health of the public. The award, worth $250,000, is presented in odd-numbered years to a winner selected from among policy makers, journalists, philanthropists, advocates, scientists, and public health professionals. It is named after the philanthropists Albert Lasker and Michael R. Bloomberg. Initially known as the Albert Lasker Public Service Award, it was known from 2000-09 as the Mary Woodard Lasker Public Service Award in honour of his wife. ==Winners== Source: Lasker Foundation *2019 Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance *2017 Planned Parenthood *2015 M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res *2013 Bill Gates and Melinda Gates *2011 The Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health *2009 Michael Bloomberg *2007 Anthony Fauci *2005 Nancy Brinker *2003 Christopher Reeve *2001 William Foege *2000 Betty Ford, Harold P.
