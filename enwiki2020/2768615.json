    "text": "The golden cave catfish (Clarias cavernicola) is a critically endangered species of airbreathing catfish. Listed as Critically Endangered (CR B1+2c, E v2.3) This cavefish is only known to live in the Aigamas cave, Otjozondjupa region, Namibia.Cave catfish (Clarias cavernicola) at ARKive . Images of Life on Earth It has also been reported from the nearby Dragon's Breath Cave, but this is an error. The golden cave catfish lack pigmentation and are up to 16.1 cm (6.3 inches) in standard length. They have very small eyes that are covered with skin, and are probably effectively blind. They feed on detritus and invertebrates that fall into the lake in which they live. The population is estimated at 200\u2013400 individuals. Little is known about its reproduction, and attempts to breed it in captivity have failed. The population is threatened by chance events and water extraction from the cave lake, which has resulted in a drop of the water level. It is the only known cavefish in mainland Southern Africa.Aldemaro, R., editor (2001). The Biology of Hypogean Fishes.
