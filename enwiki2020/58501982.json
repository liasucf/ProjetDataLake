An examination of sexism in the Hollywood film industry, the film interviews a variety of actresses and women filmmakers on their experiences in the industry.\"TIFF review: This Changes Everything\". Now, September 9, 2018. ==Release== The film premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. The film received multiple standing ovations and was only the second documentary to be shown in Toronto's iconic 2600-seat Roy Thomson Hall. The film was created in association with Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, Artemis Rising Foundation, David Yurman and Lyft Entertainment.

On January 17, 2019, Deadline Hollywood announced that the film's theatrical, streaming, and broadcast rights for North America had been acquired by Good Deed Entertainment, and that the film would be released theatrically in the first half of 2019.\"\u2018This Changes Everything\u2019 Docu About Hollywood Discrimination Acquired By Good Deed\".

Pete Hammond from Deadline called the film \u201cpowerful and fascinating\u201d. He writes, \u201cSome might believe that this movie especially, considering the subject matter, should be helmed by a woman. Donahue, however, is the one who got it made and feels correctly that it is as much if not more important to open the eyes of men in this regard.\u201d In his Variety review, Peter Debruge writes, \"There\u2019s something to be said for solidarity shown by those who have nothing to gain from their support beyond the advancement of the greater good. So, like white people at a Black Lives Matter rally or straight folks at a Gay Pride parade, Donahue deserves credit for proactively going out of his way to make a movie that tells it like it is \u2014 and paints it as it could be.\" ==Accolades== This Changes Everything was named first runner- up for the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award: Documentaries.\"'Green Book' boosts awards season prospects with TIFF audience award win\".
