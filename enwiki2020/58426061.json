She completed twelve whaling voyages before burnt her in the Bering Straits in June 1865 on Brunswicks 13th voyage. ==Career== It is currently unclear what Brunswick did between her launch in 1827 and her first voyage as a whaler in 1834. As a whaler, most of her whale hunting took place in the North Pacific, though she also hunted in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean on occasion.
