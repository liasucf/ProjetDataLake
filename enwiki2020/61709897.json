It is the wild progenitor of the West African domesticated crops Dioscorea rotundata and Dioscorea cayennensis. D. praehensilis is a liana with an edible tuber root found in African rainforests and seasonal tropical forests. The tuber roots reach their maximum starch reserves during the dry season.
