    "text": "The 2008 Champ Car World Series season would have been the 30th season of the series and the fifth instance of the Champ Car World Series. It was scheduled to begin on April 20, 2008 and end on November 9 had the open wheel unification not occurred. The season, with the sole exception of the Long Beach Grand Prix (won by Will Power), was canceled on February 21, 2008 because of the buyout of Champ Car by the rival IndyCar. The Rexall Grand Prix of Edmonton and the Gold Coast Indy 300 were retained and transferred to the IndyCar Series schedule. The schedule included what would have been the first Monterey Grand Prix since 2004 and the supposed debut of the Champ Car Grand Prix of Spain. Some of the Champ Car races were scrapped. Later on, Toronto (2009), Houston (2013), Road America (2016), Portland (2018), and Laguna Seca (2019) would also be revived by the unified series. ==Races== The 2008 Champ Car schedule was announced in November 2007 before the unification announcement {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" |- !Rnd !Date !Race Name !Circuit !City/Location |- !1 |April 20 | Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach |Streets of Long Beach |Long Beach, California |- !2 |April 27 | Grand Prix of Houston |JAGFlo Speedway at Reliant Park |Houston, Texas |- !3 |May 18 | Champ Car Grand Prix at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca |Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca |Monterey, California |- !4 |June 1 | Champ Car Grand Prix of Belgium at Circuit Zolder |Circuit Zolder |Heusden-Zolder, Belgium |- !5 |June 8 | Champ Car Grand Prix of Spain at Circuito Permanente de Jerez |Circuito de Jerez |Jerez de la Frontera, Spain |- !6 |June 22 | Champ Car Grand Prix of Cleveland |Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport |Cleveland, Ohio |- !7 |June 29 | Champ Car Mont-Tremblant |Circuit Mont-Tremblant |Mont-Tremblant, Quebec |- !8 |July 6 | Steelback Grand Prix of Toronto |Exhibition Place |Toronto, Ontario |- !9 |July 20 | Rexall Grand Prix of Edmonton |Edmonton City Centre Airport |Edmonton, Alberta |- !10 |July 27 | Champ Car Grand Prix of Portland |Portland International Raceway |Portland, Oregon |- !11 |August 10 | Road America Grand Prix |Road America |Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin |- !12 |September 14 | Champ Car Grand Prix of Holland at TT Circuit Assen |TT Circuit Assen |Assen, Netherlands |- !13 |October 26 | Gold Coast Indy 300 |Surfers Paradise Street Circuit |Surfers Paradise, Australia |- !14 |November 9 | Gran Premio Tecate Presentado por Banamex |Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez |Mexico City, Mexico |- |} * All 2008 Champ Car races were going to be run on road courses and street circuits. * The Champ Car Grand Prix at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca was set to return on May 18. * The Champ Car Grand Prix of Spain was going to debut on June 8 at the Circuito Permanente de Jerez in Spain. ==Team and driver lineup== The following teams and drivers were expected to compete for the 2008 Champ Car season.
