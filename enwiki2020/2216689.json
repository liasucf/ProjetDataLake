    "text": "A controlled explosion is a method for detonating or disabling a suspected explosive device. Methods which are used to set off a controlled explosion include clearing the area and using a bomb disposal robot to attach a shaped charge to the suspected bomb to sever the explosive from its detonator. Another classic method of controlled explosion is to place the suspected bomb in a skip and fill it with sand before detonating it with a self-incendiary device or a fuse. == See also == * Bomb disposal * DEMIRA ==External links== * BBC News summary of \"controlled explosions\" Category:Law enforcement techniques Category:Bomb disposal ",
