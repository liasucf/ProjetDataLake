The song was written by Grey members Michael Trewartha and Kyle Trewartha, Robert McCurdy, Christopher Petrosino, and Asia Whiteacre. It was released on July 22, 2016, through Republic Records and Universal Music Group. \"Starving\" is included on the Japanese edition of Steinfeld's debut extended play, Haiz (2015). It serves as the record's third and final single. ==Background== In an interview with Nylons Irina Grechko, Steinfeld said \"'Starving' is a song about sort of knowing someone, or getting to know that certain someone, to the point where even though you were somebody before that person came along, they have given you this whole new outlook on yourself and on life. It's this idea that since you came into my life everything is different, and I didn't know that it could be this different since you came into my life.\" ==Critical reception== Katherine Barner of Idolator called the song \"a dreamy, teen romance anthem.\" Teen Vogues Isis Briones said that the song \"has a soft guitar start and builds up to a mellow dance tune, perfect for a low-key summer night with your best friends. Thanks to the catchy lyrics and Zedd's smooth transitions, you'll instantly pick up on all the words to the song after just listening to it a few times. There's no doubt this single will soon top the charts, so get on it early and add it to your playlist ASAP.\" ==Chart performance== \"Starving\" debuted at number 96 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated August 20, 2016.
