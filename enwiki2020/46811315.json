Filming took place from 22 October to 24 November 1930. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Heinrich Richter and Victor Trivas. ==Reception== The British film critic Raymond Durgnat wrote in a 1993 article about Ozep for Film Dope: \"The Karamazov film is a tour de force of stylistic eclecticism: expressionist acting (Kortner), dynamic angles, Russian editing, marathon tracking shots. It's a real showpiece of formalism geared to psycho-lyrical ends, exactly as Eisenstein intended, except that Dostoievskian soul-torments replace Leninist collectivism to which the 'official' montage-masters tuned their lyres.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1931 drama films Category:1931 films Category:Films based on The Brothers Karamazov Category:Films directed by Fedor Ozep Category:Films directed by Erich Engels Category:Films of the Weimar Republic Category:German drama films Category:German films Category:German-language films Category:German multilingual films Category:Terra Film films Category:German black-and-white films ",
