WASP-39b is in the Virgo constellation, and is about 700 light- years from Earth. As part of the NameExoWorlds campaigns at the 100th anniversary of the IAU, the planet was named Bocaprins, by Aruba. The planet is named after the beach Boca Prins in the Arikok National Park. The star WASP-39 was named Malmok. ==Characteristics== thumb|left|400px| Comparison of \"hot Jupiter\" exoplanets, including WASP-39b (top row; 4th from left) (artist concept) From top left to lower right: WASP-12b, WASP-6b, WASP-31b, WASP-39b, HD 189733b, HAT-P-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b, HAT-P-1b and HD 209458b. WASP-39b has a mass of about 0.28 times that of Jupiter and a radius about 1.27 times that of Jupiter. The exoplanet orbits WASP-39, its host star, every 4 days. Hot water molecules were found in the atmosphere of WASP-39b in a 2018 study. WASP-39b is also notable for having an extremely low density, near that of WASP-17b. While WASP-17b has a density of g/cm3, WASP-39b has a slightly higher density of g/cm3. ==See also== * WASP-6b * WASP-17b * WASP-19b * WASP-31b * WASP-121b ==References== ==External links== Category:Exoplanets discovered by WASP Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2011 Category:Giant planets Category:Hot Jupiters Category:Exoplanets with proper names ",
