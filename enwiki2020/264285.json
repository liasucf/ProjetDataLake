Inouye International Airport , also known as Honolulu International Airport, is the principal aviation gateway of the City and County of Honolulu on Oahu in the State of Hawaii. It is one of the 30 busiest airports in United States, with traffic now exceeding 21 million passengers a year and rising.\"The State of Hawaii Airport Activity Statistics By Year 2007-1994\" , Department of Transportation, Airports Division, State of Hawaii. The airport is named after U.S. Senator and Medal of Honor recipient Daniel K. Inouye, who represented Hawaii from 1963 until his death in 2012. The airport is located in the Honolulu census-designated place three miles (5 km) northwest of Honolulu's central business district., effective December 20, 2007\"Honolulu CDP, HI .\" U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on May 21, 2009. Main roads leading to the airport are Nimitz Highway and the Queen Liliuokalani Freeway of Interstate H-1. Daniel K. Inouye International Airport serves as the principal hub of Hawaiian Airlines, the largest Hawaii-based airline, and is host to major United States and international airlines, with nonstop flights to North American, Asian, and Oceania destinations. It offers services to the various airports of the Hawaiian Islands as well as most major western U.S. cities and many smaller gateways, especially in California; the airport has also succeeded in attracting long-haul services to the East Coast including the recently added destinations of Boston and Washington\u2013Dulles, which have joined established services to Atlanta, New York\u2013JFK, and Newark. It is also the base for Aloha Air Cargo, which previously offered both passenger and cargo services under the name Aloha Airlines. This airline ceased passenger flights on March 31, 2008, and sold off its cargo services to Seattle-based Saltchuk Resources, Inc. (also owners of inter-island sea-based shipping company Young Brothers and Hawaiian Tug & Barge). In 2012, the airport handled 19,291,412 passengers and 278,145 aircraft movements and processed 412,270 metric tons of cargo. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017\u20132021, in which it is categorized as a large-hub primary commercial service facility. ==History== HNL opened in March 1927 as John Rodgers Airport, named after World War I naval officer John Rodgers. It was funded by the territorial legislature and the Chamber of Commerce, and was the first full airport in Hawaii; aircraft had previously been limited to small landing strips, fields, and seaplane docks. From 1939 to 1943, the adjacent Keehi Lagoon was dredged for use by seaplanes, and the dredged soil was moved to HNL to provide more space for conventional airplanes. The U.S. military grounded all civil aircraft and took over all civil airports after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rodgers Field was designated Naval Air Station Honolulu. The Navy built a control tower and terminal building, and some commercial traffic was allowed during daylight hours. Rodgers Field was returned to the Territory of Hawaii in 1946. At the time, at , it was one of the largest airports in the United States, with four paved land runways and three seaplane runways. John Rodgers Airport was renamed Honolulu Airport in 1947; \"International\" was added to the name in 1951. Being near the center of the Pacific Ocean it was a stop for many transpacific flights. By 1950 it was the third-busiest airport in the United States in terms of aircraft operations, and its runway was the longest in the world in 1953. In summer of 1959 Qantas began the first jet service to Honolulu on its flights between Australia and California. Qantas introduced these jet flights with Boeing 707 aircraft operating a routing of Sydney \u2013 Fiji \u2013 Honolulu \u2013 San Francisco.http://www.timetableimages.com , Nov. 6, 1959 Qantas system timetable Aeronautical engineer and airline consultant, Frank Der Yuen, advised in the design of the original building and founded its aerospace museum. The original terminal building on the southeast side of runways 4 was replaced by the John Rodgers Terminal, which was dedicated on August 22, 1962 and opened on October 14, 1962. From 1970 through 1978, the architect Vladimir Ossipoff designed a terminal modernization project that remodeled this terminal and created several additions, which included the Diamond Head Concourse in 1970, the Ewa Concourse in 1972, and the Central Concourse in 1980. Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) used Honolulu as a transpacific hub for many years, initially as a connecting point between the West Coast and Polynesia (Fiji, New Caledonia, and New Zealand) in 1946, followed by service to East Asia through Midway Island and Wake Island from 1947. By 1960, Pan American was serving the airport with Boeing 707 jets. Pan Am flight number 1, operating a 707, flew a westbound routing of San Francisco \u2013 Honolulu \u2013 Wake Island \u2013 Tokyo \u2013 Hong Kong and continuing on to New York City via stops in Asia and Europe. The airline also operated nonstop 707 service to Portland, Oregon (continuing to Seattle) and Los Angeles.

The plan involves implementing short-term projects within the first five years to improve passenger service and increase security and operational efficiencies. As part of the modernization, flight display monitors throughout the airport have been upgraded, new food and beverage vendors have been added, and a new parking garage across from the international arrival terminal has been completed. Current projects include an international arrivals corridor with moving sidewalks built atop the breezeway leading to the Ewa Concourse. The first phase of the project was completed in October 2009, while the remainder of the two phase project was completed in 2010. In 2011, Hawaiian Airlines renovated the check-in lobby of the Interisland Terminal, replacing the traditional check-in counters with six circular check-in islands in the middle of the lobbies, which can be used for inter-island, mainland, and international flights. This renovation project was fully funded by Hawaiian Airlines and not a part of the modernization program. Hawaiian Airlines renovating inter-island terminal check-in lobby at Honolulu International Airport, Honolulu Star Advertiser retrieved March 31, 2011 Future projects include construction of a Mauka Concourse branching off the Interisland Terminal, the first concourse expansion at Honolulu International Airport in 15 years. Construction of the concourse will involve replacing the existing Commuter Terminal. This new concourse will be for the exclusive use of Hawaiian Airlines, and will allow it to reduce use of overseas terminal gates for international and US mainland flights. This will mean less walking for passengers who check in, clear security, and use the baggage claim at the inter-island terminal. It will also free up gates in the overseas terminal for use by other airlines. Landside plans include construction of a consolidated rental car facility (CONRAC). A temporary rental car center is currently being built in the overseas parking garage so that the existing rental car facilities can be demolished to make way for the new permanent facility. By 2012, Hawaiian Airlines was re- establishing Honolulu International Airport as a connecting hub between the United States mainland and the Asia-Pacific region.Russell, Edward. \"ANALYSIS: Honolulu's reascendant connecting hub .\" Flightglobal. October 30, 2012. Retrieved on October 30, 2012.

May 8, 2013. Retrieved on May 9, 2013. During the 2016 legislative session, the Hawaii state legislature passed a resolution requesting the Department of Transportation to rename Honolulu International Airport for the late U.S. senator and Medal of Honor recipient Daniel Inouye. The new name first appeared in Federal Aviation Administration documentation on April 27, 2017, and the airport was officially renamed in a ceremony at the airport on May 30, 2017. After years of delays, on May 30, 2018, the state airports division broke ground on the Mauka Concourse with plans for its completion by the end of 2020. On June 1, 2018, the Department of Transportation started renumbering all gates and baggage claim numbers. Gates were renamed alphanumerically and baggage claim numbers were renumbered from alphanumerical to numerical. The Hawaii Department of Transportation cited the expansion of existing terminals in the airport as a reason to renumber all gates and baggage claims. The renumbering was the first done since 1993. ==Authority== A Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 717 taxiing with the airport's control tower in the background Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawaii. The official authority of Daniel K.

Inouye International Airport has 48 gates (42 jet-way gates and 6 hard stands) in three terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3. The Wiki Wiki Shuttle provides inter-terminal transportation between the ticket lobbies of all three terminals and between the concourses in terminals 1 and 2. All gates in terminals 1 and 2 are connected post- security; however, passengers walking from Terminal 1 to gates in Terminal 2 must pass through a USDA agricultural inspection station for carry-on luggage. Effective June 1, 2018, the gate numbers at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport were renamed to an alphanumeric format, and the baggage claim numbers (formerly alphanumeric) were renumbered to numeric. These changes are intended to accommodate expansion with the new Mauka and Diamond Head concourses. ===Terminal 1=== Terminal 1, formerly known as the \"Interisland Terminal,\" opened in 1993. The $130 million 8-gate terminal was the largest construction project undertaken at that time by the State Airports Division and replaced an earlier terminal built in 1961. In 1995, a 5-gate extension to the terminal, which also featured a new post-security walkway to Terminal 2 (formerly known as the \"Overseas Terminal\") opened. On May 30, 2018, the state airports division broke ground on the Mauka Concourse after years of delays. This new concourse will add space for 11 narrow-body aircraft or six wide-body aircraft, feature a post-security walkway to the rest of Terminal 1 and a new six-lane TSA security checkpoint. Terminal 1 houses Hawaiian Airlines (interisland, U.S. Mainland and international flights (except Japan flights)). Terminal 1 has 13 gates. Those gates consist of A13-A20, and B1-B5. The terminal will see the addition of gates A1-A11 upon the completion of the long awaited Mauka Concourse. All gates in the terminal are used by Hawaiian Airlines and its subsidiary \u02bbOhana by Hawaiian. ===Terminal 2=== Terminal 2, formerly known as the \"Overseas Terminal,\" opened on August 22, 1962. From 1970 through 1978, architect Vladimir Ossipoff designed a terminal modernization project that remodeled this terminal and created several additions, which included the Diamond Head Concourse in 1970, the Ewa Concourse in 1972, and the Central Concourse in 1980. Terminal 2 houses AirAsia X, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, Asiana Airlines, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Fiji Airways, Hawaiian Airlines (Japan flights), Japan Airlines, Jetstar Airways, Jin Air, Korean Air, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and WestJet. Terminal 2 has 29 gates across three concourses and the main terminal building. Those gates consist of C1-C9, D1-D2, E1-E10, F1-F2, and G1-G10. Gates C4 and C9 are capable of handling an Airbus A380. All gates in the terminal are designated as common-use, shared among all the airlines. No gates are assigned to any specific airline and can change daily based on need. ===Terminal 3=== Terminal 3, formerly known as the \"Commuter Terminal,\" opened on May 29, 2018 between the Delta and United Cargo facilities on the Diamond Head side of the airport.Terminal 3 . Mokuleleairlines.com. The terminal was originally a single-story facility located north of Terminal 1 adjacent to Nimitz Highway, but this older facility was closed on June 1, 2018 for demolition in order to make way for the Mauka Concourse expansion of Terminal 1. Originally a larger replacement commuter terminal was planned to be built on the Diamond Head side of the airport, but those plans were ultimately canceled. This was largely due to bankruptcy of three of the four airlines occupying the terminal and the higher-than-expected cost of the project. Terminal 3 houses Mokulele Airlines. All boarding and deplaning are conducted directly on the apron. Terminal 3 has one ground-level gate (Gate H1). ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== ===Cargo=== ===Fixed-base operators=== A number of fixed-base operators are located along Lagoon Drive on the airport's southeastern perimeter. While these focus on general aviation services, there are a few small passenger airline operations that operate from these facilities, rather than from the main terminal complex. Air tour flights typically depart from this area as well. ==Traffic and statistics== The largest airline at Honolulu airport is Hawaiian Airlines offering 13,365 seats per day, which represents a 45% market share. The No. 2 and No. 3 carriers are United and Japan Airlines (JAL) with 7.7% and 7.4% market share respectively. Traffic between Honolulu and the mainland United States is dominated by flights to and from Los Angeles and San Francisco. These two cities, plus Seattle, account for around half of all flights between the mainland and Honolulu. Hawaiian Airlines, with 11 routes, has the highest market share on routes between Honolulu and the continental United States. Internationally, Japan is the dominant market. Two-thirds of international seats head for Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo (both Haneda and Narita airports) with services provided by Japan Airlines, Air Japan, China Airlines, Korean Airlines, Delta, Hawaiian, or United. Narita alone is served with 61 weekly departures and is the second busiest international route from the United States, trailing only the lucrative John F. Kennedy Airport-London Heathrow route. Other major international routes are to Seoul (25 weekly departures operated by Korean Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Hawaiian, and Jin Air), Sydney (12 weekly departures operated by Hawaiian, Jetstar, and Qantas), and Vancouver (19 weekly departures split between Air Canada and Westjet). In October 2009, China-based Hainan Airlines was granted approval for a nonstop flight from Honolulu to Beijing. It would be the first mainland Chinese carrier to serve Hawaii and the airline's second US destination after Seattle. The airline originally planned to launch the service by the summer of 2010,Hawaii flights by Chinese airline may not start until summer but the route has been further delayed due to visa concerns and landing fees.Direct route to China delayed , Honolulu Star-Advertiser, August 15, 2010. China Eastern, however, announced that it will begin nonstop flights from Honolulu to Shanghai on August 9, 2011 instead, marking the first ever direct, regularly scheduled service between China and Hawaii. On January 21, 2014, Air China launched the second China-Hawaii route with nonstop flights from Honolulu to Beijing, also the first nonstop route between the two cities. ===Top destinations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" width= align= |+ Busiest domestic routes from HNL (July 2019 \u2013 June 2020) |- !
