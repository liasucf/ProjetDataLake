This week, Bob shows us how difficult it is to launch an acting career when you live in Sheffield. He follows one young hopeful who - armed with a few appearances in Look North - tries to get a sponsored car and clothes. Despite the attentions of an image consultant, he still holds out hope of getting a part as a menacing cop.

Meet Canadian Troy Hurtubise - a man with a mission. After being attacked by a grizzly bear he's determined to track down the beast wearing a specially made protective suit. To test the suit, Troy allows himself to be hit by cars and baseball bats, does T'ai chi while dressed like Frank Spencer and plays a series of games with hand grenades.

Bob's \"uncle\" makes an appearance with his saxophone, and the musical theme continues when a Sheffield youth proves that white men can sing reggae. Also, more embarrassing reminders of Bob's celebrity carousing and an explanation why men in flat caps are funny. |- |5 |9C25776) |1998 |Bob Mills |Conrad Green |Tony Gregory |- |colspan=\"6\"|This week, Bob introduces us to Aaron Russo, the Hollywood film producer who became so angry about the government that he hired a studio to tell us he was \"mad as hell\". Despite a passing resemblance to Danny Baker and a problem with remembering percentages, Aaron still finds time to swap cooking tips and share a few gender jokes. Also, we meet the strictest teacher, who enforces discipline with a shotgun, and a boy who really loves The Birds. |- |6 |9C25777 |1998 |Bob Mills |Conrad Green |Tony Gregory |- |colspan=\"6\"|Bob Mills begins another trawl through televisual heaven with a trip to the USA. First off, he meets the bad boys from a motorbike gang who teach him all about how to stand up for himself in a bar-room brawl. He then scoots off to the other side of town to hitch up with his friends in the local police force. There is also just enough time to squeeze in a bizarre film featuring a little known appearance by Bill Cosby.

Bob also catches up with friends in the US police to deliver a master class in the art of the arrest. |- |10 |9C25781 |1998 |Bob Mills |Conrad Green |Tony Gregory |- |colspan=\"6\"|Bob Mills returns to one of his favourite shows, London Bridge, to see a master class in magic and discover what happened to Rodney Bewes after The Likely Lads.

But she can't shake her nasty cough, and always seems to run out of time. |- |11 |9C25782 |1998 |Bob Mills |Conrad Green |Tony Gregory |- |colspan=\"6\"|Bob Mills continues his quest to seek out the weirdest and wackiest folk on the globe. This week he introduces Paul Nolan, a gigolo who is \"too handsome to live\". He lets us in on some of the tricks of his trade, such as sure-fire strategies for wooing the women: \"always talk to women about soap operas\", and \"always end your sentences with 'mate'\". This works particularly well with Australian punters! This week's show also rediscovers Sarah Michelle, one of Britain's forgotten stars, whose career as a singer was kick-started after her arrest in Greece for lewd dancing. Her first single, Dirty Dancing, flopped. The campaign for a re-release begins here!

A man in Brentwood proves that key sites of the ancient world were actually airports with spaces set aside for customs, and detailed models gleaned from hieroglyphics show that Egyptians could travel across the world.
