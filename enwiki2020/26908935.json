    "text": "Watch Out is the fifth album by the Spanish group Barrab\u00e1s, released in 1975. The album was later re-released on CD in Spain as Desperately. American jazz musician Herbie Mann featured in the recording of the album, after his hit cover of Barrab\u00e1s' song \"Hi Jack\", which was released earlier that year. Also appearing was American saxophonist Michael Brecker. The girl posing on the cover of the album is Ellen Michaels. \"Desperately\" / \"Broadway Star\" was released as a single, although \"It\" was the B-side in some countries. Barrab\u00e1s' next album, Swinger, was re-released on CD under the title Watch- Out, but is unrelated to this album. ==Track listing== #\"Broadway Star\" (Fernando Arbex) \u2013 3:59 #\"It\" (Arbex) \u2013 3:57 #\"Fire Girl\" (Enrique Morales) \u2013 5:05 #\"Desperately\" (Arbex) \u2013 5:20 #\"High Light\" (Ernesto Duarte, E.
