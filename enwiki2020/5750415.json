W. Bush and press secretary for George W. Bush), Michael Waldman (Clinton), George Stephanopoulos (Clinton), James Fallows (Carter), Chris Matthews (Carter), Hendrik Hertzberg (Carter), Anthony R. Dolan (Reagan), Michael Gerson (George W. Bush), and Clark Clifford, who wrote speeches for Harry Truman.Robert Schlesinger, White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters, (Simon & Schuster 2008).
