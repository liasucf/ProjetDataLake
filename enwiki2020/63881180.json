    "text": "COBOL Cowboys is a Gainesville, Texas software consulting company founded by Bill (age ) and Eileen Hinshaw in 2013. It was named after the Clint Eastwood movie Space Cowboys, in reference to bringing subject matter experts out of retirement. The company specializes in updating legacy COBOL code on mainframe computers, often found in the back office of banks, other long-lived companies, and government agencies. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, unprecedented unemployment numbers, over 5 million new filings for several weeks, meant that legacy state unemployment systems, while reliable, failed to process the volume of claims. States including Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey put out calls for COBOL programmers to work on their unemployment systems; New Jersey stated their system was over 40 years old. The Verge identified at least 12 states with COBOL used for unemployment systems including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Rhode Island, and California. The Verge also noted that 25 years of budget cuts has led to reduced maintenance and modernization of systems. ==See also== * Open Mainframe Project * Year 2000 problem * COBOL#Legacy ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex Category:Software companies based in Texas Category:Cooke County, Texas Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:COBOL ",
