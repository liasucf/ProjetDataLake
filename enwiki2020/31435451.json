Cameron was associated with the cocaine-fuelled ravages of the razor gang violence of that era, commonly associated with her contemporaries, Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh, both criminal entrepreneurs who controlled much of Sydney's illegal sex industry and Sly-grog distribution during that period. Nellie Cameron received 73 criminal convictions during her life of crime, mainly for soliciting and vagrancy, and had the distinction of becoming the first woman in Australia to be convicted of consorting with criminals.\"Ellen Katherine (Nellie) Cameron (1910\u20131953)\", Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, 'Ellen Katherine (Nellie) Cameron (1910\u20131953)', accessed 7 November 2011. ==Early life== Ellen (Nellie) Katherine Kelly was born in the inner city Sydney suburb of Waterloo in 1910, the youngest child of Colin Kelly, who later served in the AIF in World War I, and Lillian Kelly (n\u00e9e Ruddock),Name: Nellie K Kelly Birth Date: 1910 Father's Name: Colin Kelly Mother's Name: Lilian Birth Place: New South Wales Registration Year: 1910 Registration Place: Waterloo, New South Wales Registration Number: 33377 Ancestry.com.

Cameron was a Roman CatholicAdmission Record, Nellie Cameron, State Reformatory 29 July 1930. and was educated at an exclusive girls' school on the North Shore. In 1926 Cameron ran away from home,Tilly Devine & the Razor Gang Wars, 1927\u201331 caught a train to the city, seduced a married tram driver, and began living with him in Woolloomooloo.Toby Creswell, Notorious Australians (Angus & Robertson, 2011). ==\"The Kiss of Death Girl\"== When Cameron began her career in prostitution in 1926 in Sydney's Surry Hills and Woolloomooloo districts at the age of fifteen, she was a blue-eyed blonde. Soon Cameron became Sydney's most popular and most expensive prostitute and was known as Sydney's Underworld Beauty Queen and also as the \"Kiss Of Death Girl\" or \"The Angel Of Death\",According to Larry Writer's book Razor (on which Underbelly: Razor was based), it was another popular Sydney prostitute of the time, 'Pretty' Dulcie Markham, who was better known as the Angel of Death. as most of her boyfriends or husbands were subsequently murdered. During her years in crime, Cameron was kidnapped, beaten, stabbed, razor slashed, and shot on numerous occasions. Early in 1927 when Cameron met Norman Bruhn (1894\u20131927), a Melbourne-born dockworker and gunman, thief, standover man and pimp feared for his garroting skills,Norman Bruhn who was forced to leave Melbourne by rival gunman Squizzy Taylor in November 1926, she was described as \"a redhead with a ripe figure and provocative china blue eyes\".James Morton and Susanna Lobez, Gangland Australia (Victory Books, 2010):71\u201372. At that time Cameron was a street prostitute on William and Palmer Streets with no connection to Tilly Devine or any other madam. Despite having a wife and children, Bruhn soon became Cameron's lover and pimp, although she also worked as a dance instructor at Professor Bolot's Academy in Sydney's Oxford Street, commuting between Sydney and Queensland on a regular basis. According to Larry Writer, Cameron \"perfected the age-old game called 'gingering' in Australia. During sex with one of her clients, an accomplice would emerge from beneath the bed and take the client's wallet from his pants or jacket. At that point, coitus would be interrupted by angry banging on the door by another involved in the scam, Cameron, feigning panic, would exclaim it was the police or her irate husband, and urge the client to dress and depart by the back door. Keen to avoid the embarrassment of public prosecution or a beating, the customer would flee and usually not notice until later that his wallet was missing.\" Cameron also was a cocaine runner and a fence for stolen property. Bruhn, who attempted to dominate the duopolised gangland milieu, was shot twice in the stomach outside a sly grog den in Charlotte Lane, Darlinghurst on 22 June 1927 by a hit squad sent by either Devine or Kate Leigh.Morton and Lobez, 2007:71\u201372,\"GANG WARFARE. Darlinghurst Murder. Few Clues\", Sydney Morning Herald (24 June 1927):11. and subsequently died in the early hours of 23 June 1927.Bruhn's Death Wish Within weeks of Bruhn's death, Cameron began a series of relationships with a successive string of other Sydney criminals: Ernest Lyle Connelly (1903\u20131969), shot in Womerah Avenue, Kings Cross by rival gunman and future husband, Guido Caletti (or Calletti) in February 1929;James Morton and Susanna Lobez, Gangland Australia (Victory Books, 2010):84.

After an altercation, Devine shot at the fleeing Cameron, Green, and Hourigan, and accidentally killed a taxi driver. Subsequently, on 11 July 1931 Green, Horigan and Cameron were charged with \"robbery under arms\", being accused of having assaulted Devine, whilst armed with a revolver, and robbing him of a diamond tiepin valued at \u00a350.\"Alleged Theft of Tiepin\", The Sydney Morning Herald (Monday, 13 July 1931):11.

On 16 November 1931, after visiting her then de facto husband Frank Green at St. Vincent's Hospital where he was in a serious condition after being shot in the stomach, Nellie Cameron was herself shot in the shoulder in Burton Street, East Sydney whilst walking home from the hospital. Later, she refused to cooperate with police.\"WOMAN SHOT. Underworld Feud. No information for police\", Sydney Morning Herald, (17 November 1931):9. Cameron's first marriage was to the feared Sydney gangland figure Guido Caletti (1900\u20131939), who was the leader of a vicious Sydney gang known as the \"Darlinghurst Push\". The couple had fled New South Wales to Victoria due to outstanding arrest warrants. They married at the local registry office at Fitzroy, Victoria on 20 February 1934 with Nellie using her birth name, Ellen Kelly.Victoria BDM, \"Guido Caletti & Ellen Kelly\".

On 31 March 1952, Cameron was attacked at her flat by Donohue, who shot her in the stomach. Cameron was admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in a critical condition with a bullet lodged in her liver.
