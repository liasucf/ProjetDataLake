    "text": "Millwall Football Club is an English association football club based in South Bermondsey, London. They were founded in 1885 and first joined The Football League in 1920. Their first and only season playing in a major European cup competition was in 2004 when they qualified for the 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup. They had also played in the Anglo-Italian Cup == 1992\u201393 Anglo-Italian Cup == Millwall were entered into the Anglo-Italian Cup for the first time in 1992. In their group they were drawn with Charlton Athletic and Portsmouth. However they failed to progress as they finished bottom of the group with a 2\u20131 loss to Charlton at The Old Den and a 1\u20131 draw with Portsmouth at Fratton Park. == 1993\u201394 Anglo-Italian Cup == Millwall entered the Anglo-Italian Cup again in 1993. They were drawn with Charlton and Crystal Palace. However they again finished bottom of the group with a 3\u20130 loss to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and a 2\u20132 draw with Charlton at The Den. == 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup == Millwall qualified for their first UEFA competition by reaching the final of the 2003\u201304 FA Cup. As their opponents Manchester United had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League by virtue of their placing in the 2003\u201304 Premier League, it was guaranteed that Millwall would play in the UEFA Cup, despite losing the FA Cup final 3\u20130. In the first round they were drawn against Hungarian side Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC. Millwall drew the first leg 1\u20131 at home at The New Den with Dennis Wise scoring Millwall's first European goal. Prior to the second leg, there was violence between the clubs' supporters; supporters of Millwall and Ferencv\u00e1ros both have reputations for football hooliganism. Two Millwall fans were stabbed in the hooligan violence. Millwall brought 3,000 fans to Budapest for the return leg, which the club lost 3\u20131 at Stadion Albert Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n, going out 4\u20132 on aggregate. Ferencv\u00e1ros were later charged by UEFA for the violence and racist abuse during the second leg. There were reports that Millwall hooligans would be travelling to Edinburgh when Ferencv\u00e1ros were due to play Heart of Midlothian in later rounds; however, Millwall sent a security expert, who stated it was unlikely to happen due to the risk of arrest and spending Christmas in a Scottish prison. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

In 2013, the club reached the semi-finals of the 2012\u201313 FA Cup. As the other finalists Manchester City had already qualified for Europe, the winner of the semi-final would have entered the 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League. However, Millwall lost 2\u20130 to Wigan Athletic at Wembley Stadium and changes to UEFA qualifying criteria later meant that runners-up of the FA Cup would no longer enter the UEFA Europa League if the winners had already qualified for Europe. == References == Millwall Europe ",
