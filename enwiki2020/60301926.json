    "text": "Lethal Lesbian is Israel's only lesbian film festival. The festival has been held annually since 2008, and screens independent short, documentary and feature films from Israel and abroad. == The festival == The festival was initially conceived by LGBT activists Anat Nir and Dana Ziv, who organize and produce the festival with feminist Lior Elefant, who serves as the festival's artistic director. Before Lethal Lesbian was organized as a festival, it began as independent lesbian film nights, organized by friends of the Ziv and Nir. The evenings were so successful, that the need for a festival in this niche seemed clear to the two founders. The goal of Lethal Lesbian is to promote lesbian filmmaking of all types. The festival screens short and full-length films of all genres, and in some years, produces a concurrent exhibition of women's art. Though occasionally films by straight women (and one man) have been included in the festival lineup, the majority of films are by lesbian and bisexual women. Every year the festival has a theme, and a short promotional movie is produced. These promos have become very popular online. In its first years, the festival took place in various venues, though in recent years, as it has grown to sold-out crowds, the Tel Aviv Cinematheque has become its home. In 2018, as the festival celebrated a decade of queer women's film, the mainstream press lauded its staying power \"in a landscape in which cultural events have trouble maintaining stability over time\". The festival is one of only few events aimed specifically for women in the LGBT community, and has provided a supportive venue for the works of filmmakers in the community. == See also == * List of women's film festivals * Women's cinema * List of LGBT film festivals * TLVFest == References == == External links == * Category:2008 establishments in Israel Category:Festivals in Tel Aviv Category:Film festivals established in 2008 Category:Film festivals in Israel Category:Lesbian culture in Asia Category:Lesbian events Category:LGBT culture in Tel Aviv Category:LGBT events in Israel Category:LGBT film festivals Category:Women in Israel Category:Women's film festivals ",
