    "text": "Bonifaciu Florescu (first name also Boniface, Bonifacio, Bonifati, last name also Floresco; born Bonifacius Florescu;Potra, p. 133 May 1848 \u2013 December 18, 1899) was a Romanian polygraph, the illegitimate son of writer-revolutionary Nicolae B\u0103lcescu. Born secretly outside his parents' native Wallachia, at Pest, he was taken by his aristocratic mother in France, growing up as an erudite Francophone and Francophile. Florescu graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e Louis- le-Grand and the University of Rennes, returning home at age 25 to become a successful lecturer, polemicist, and historian of culture. Influenced by his father's politics, he was for a while a prominent figure on the far-left of Romanian liberalism and nationalism, which pitted him against the conservative society Junimea, and against his own conservative cousin, Prime Minister Ion Emanuel Florescu. The conflict led to his losing a professorship at Ia\u0219i University and being sidelined when applying for chairs at the University of Bucharest. His critique of Junimist literature, structured around a classical defense of prosody, inspired a libel by Mihai Eminescu\u2014famously depicting Florescu as a \"homunculus\". Florescu had significant success as a self- proclaimed irredentist, agitating for Romanian causes in disputed Bukovina and Transylvania. Ultimately, however, he failed in his bid to rise through the National Liberal Party, as the latter moved to the center, and fell back on independent journalism, founding several periodicals of his own. He had a long but interrupted collaboration with another dissident liberal and poet, Alexandru Macedonski, who co-opted him on his Literatorul editing team during the 1880s. A precursor, but not an affiliate, of the Romanian Symbolist movement, Florescu had steadier friendships with the younger Symbolists Mircea Demetriade and Iuliu Cezar S\u0103vescu. His main contribution to pre-Symbolist belles-lettres is prose poetry in the manner of Catulle Mend\u00e8s. A committed bohemian, whose lifestyle interfered with his literary output and his teaching job at Saint Sava, Florescu is sometimes read as a herald of decadent writing. He was important to the Macedonskian Symbolists for his familiarity with French culture, but was primarily an expert in 18th-century literature. His criticism, modeled on Villemain, Sainte-Beuve and Taine, was perceived as refined in its context, but later enlisted objections for its pedantry and amateurism. He was a prolific translator passionate about exotic topics, authoring some of the first Romanian versions of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. ==Biography== ===Origins=== Born a Wallachian subject, Bonifaciu Florescu descended from the boyar nobility: the B\u0103lcescus recognized him as a family member; the Florescus, however, refused to accept that Nicolae B\u0103lcescu was the father.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 130, 135, 145 His father's family, of lesser rank and prestige, had been founded by Father Necula, a Wallachian Orthodox parson, who purchased the B\u0103lce\u0219ti estate in 1766. Unusually rich for his social position, he bought for his sons small boyar offices.Bodea et al., pp. 11\u201315; Potra, pp. 113\u2013114 Despite taking the same name, Nicolae and his two brothers descended from the clan through their mother Zinca; she married Pitar Barbu sin Petre C\u0103pitanul\u2014a gentleman farmer of Prahova, who also owned townhouses in Bucharest.Bodea et al., pp. 16\u201321; Potra, pp. 114\u2013118 Barbu's financial troubles and quick death contributed to the family's marginalization.Bodea et al., pp. 19\u201325; Potra, pp. 113\u2013122 The poet's mother, Alexandrina \"Luxi\u021ba\" Florescu, claimed direct descent from Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave, and was the daughter of Logothete Iordache Florescu, as well as aunt of Ion Emanuel Florescu, the Wallachian militia chief.C\u0103linescu, p. 530 The family also had Greek and Albanian ancestors. Iordache, a Ghica on his mother's side, ran in the 1842 election for the Wallachian throne, under the Regulamentul Organic regime; his wife, Anica, was a Soutzos.L\u0103custeanu & Crutzescu, p. 270 At age 17, Luxi\u021ba was married off to a Russian Pole, but divorced him in 1836, alleging that he was hypersexual; he was probably also an alcoholic.Potra, pp. 131\u2013132 She may have then met B\u0103lcescu at the Florescu home in \u0218erban-Vod\u0103, Bucharest, which functioned as a club for progressive intellectuals; however, Bonifaciu was most likely conceived while the couple reunited in Paris.C\u0103linescu, pp. 185, 530; Potra, pp. 131\u2013132 Reportedly, B\u0103lcescu, ill with tuberculosis and absorbed by his conspiratorial work, informed Luxi\u021ba that they could never be married, which she accepted.Potra, p. 132 Youth from both families were deeply involved in the Wallachian revolution of 1848, which occurred some weeks after Bonifaciu's birth. Luxi\u021ba was shielded by her brothers in the Kingdom of Hungary, without informing Nicolae of her whereabouts or her pregnancy, until after she delivered.Potra, pp. 132\u2013134 Bonifaciu was thus born in Pest; his date of birth is variously given as May 14,Alexandru Piru, \"Florescu Bonifaciu\", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, Vol. I, p. 593. Pite\u0219ti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. May 17, or May 27.C\u0103linescu, p. 530. \"May 27\" also in Potra, pp. 133\u2013134, while Crutzescu has \"April 27\" (p. 490) In July, he was baptized into Orthodoxy at a Pest chapel shared by the Greek and Romanian Orthodox churches. The baptismal record omits mention of his father's family name, but indicates his godfather as Inochentie Chi\u021bulescu (future Bishop of Buz\u0103u).Potra, pp. 132, 133 By July, B\u0103lcescu had been appointed foreign minister of revolutionary Wallachia, but then a reshuffle pushed him into the background.C\u0103linescu, p. 185 Eventually, the Russian and Ottoman empires intervened militarily, and the revolutionaries were pushed into exile or imprisoned. Brothers Nicolae and Costache B\u0103lcescu escaped to Paris, passing through insurgent Hungary; the third B\u0103lcescu brother, Barbu, was taken to Istanbul as a hostage.Bodea et al., pp. 25\u201326; C\u0103linescu, pp. 184, 185\u2013188; Potra, pp. 120\u2013121 Three of Luxi\u021ba's brothers\u2014Iancu, Dumitrache, and Costache Florescu\u2014participated in the events, and played a part in the shootout with the loyalist Colonel Grigore L\u0103custeanu, whom they eventually arrested. Unusually, Costache Florescu's daughter married L\u0103custeanu's brother Iancu while the colonel was still in captivity.L\u0103custeanu & Crutzescu, pp. 34\u201335, 160\u2013162 All three brothers were repressed during the foreign intervention: Iancu Florescu was arrested by the Russians and spent some eight years in Siberia, returning after the Crimean War removed Wallachia from the Russian sphere of influence; Costache and Dumitrache were taken into Ottoman custody, returning after nine years of exile in Bursa. While Iancu took up law practice,L\u0103custeanu & Crutzescu, p. 98 Dumitrache is best known for setting to music the poetry of Vasile Alecsandri.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 131 With material support from Chi\u021bulescu, Luxi\u021ba and her son returned to Wallachia in 1850.Potra, pp. 133, 134 Although she only formally adopted Bonifaciu in 1858, to solidify his claim to the Florescu estate, he grew up knowing that the exiled B\u0103lcescu was his father.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 133, 134\u2013135 Prevented from returning home (with a brief exception in August 1852, when he only met Zinca at Turnu M\u0103gurele),Potra, pp. 120\u2013121 Nicolae died in the Two Siciles (November 1852). His grave is presumed lost.C\u0103linescu, p. 188; Potra, p. 145 ===French studies and 1873 return=== Luxi\u021ba and Bonifaciu were also largely absent from Wallachia as the country merged with Moldavia into the United Principalities (the basis for modern Romania). Bonifaciu attended Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, living with his mother on Rue Saint-Jacques, and possibly obtaining a scholarship from the Romanian government.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 134 He grew up speaking French at home, and only later perfected his Romanian, which he always spoke with an accent and a guttural R.Potra, p. 136 His impromptu versions of Romanian orthography reflected phonemic spelling with unusual consistency for his day, and they unwittingly recorded his own difficulties in pronouncing Romanian words. This trait was ridiculed by philologist Hanes Suchianu as the very \"apex of phoneticism\".Longinescu, pp. 6, 8 Familiarized with B\u0103lcescu's works by age 17, Bonifaciu declared his father to have been a \"genius\", \"Romania's only prose writer\".Potra, pp. 134\u2013135 He followed Nicolae's radical orientation, declaring the French Revolution as the \"triumph of justice, liberty and equality, and a great step toward fraternity\"; he also took up the cause of Pan-Europeanism, arguing for \"one great European republic, as in America.\"Potra, pp. 137\u2013138 Reading up on the events at home, Florescu was indignant about the 1866 coup against Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In his view, Cuza, albeit ruling with an \"authoritarian hand\", was preferable to the foreign-born replacement Carol of Hohenzollern.Potra, p. 138 Passionate about literature, Florescu and his colleague Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dam\u00e9 set up their own newspaper, L'Avenir (\"The Future\"), which only put out a few issues.Potra, pp. 134, 317 Florescu was described by teachers and relatives as a charming but inattentive student, and was once moved to a remedial class, ultimately obtaining his baccalaur\u00e9at in August 1868. In October 1872, he graduated from the literature faculty of the University of Rennes.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 430 From mid 1873, he returned with his mother to Bucharest, where she became the curator of a retirement home maintained by the Sisters of Charity.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 135\u2013136 Her son debuted in the Romanian press with an overview of history as reflected in Romanian folklore; it was hosted in Rom\u00e2nul, published by C. A. Rosetti (July\u2013August 1873).C\u0103linescu, p. 1003 On October 3, Florescu married Rose-Henriette Le Roho d'Alcobia (born 1849), the orphaned scion of an Anglo-French-Portuguese family.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 140. See also Nastas\u0103 (2010), pp. 51, 83, 237 According to one account, they did not have any children of their own, but later adopted a boy named Ion.Potra, p. 140 Contrarily, literary historian George C\u0103linescu suggests that Ion was the couple's natural son, \"a direct descendant of Nicolae B\u0103lcescu\".C\u0103linescu, p. 1004 On October 5, following an examination performed by historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu,Potra, p. 136. See also Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 244 Florescu had obtained a \"provisional\"Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 430; (2010), p. 237 professorate at the department of world literature within the literature faculty of Ia\u0219i University. He thus replaced Nicolae Ionescu, who preferred to keep his seat in the Assembly of Deputies.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 136 Researcher George Porta suggests that Florescu never actually took hold of his chair, being snubbed by two successive Education Ministers: Christian Tell and Vasile Boerescu.Potra, pp. 136, 137\u2013138 However, his introductory lesson was published in Hasdeu's newspaper, Columna lui Traian,C\u0103linescu, pp. 530, 1003; Perpessicius (1943), p. 239 which also hosted Florescu's homage to the retiring poet Grigore Alexandrescu.Petre V. Hane\u0219, \"\u00cendrept\u0103ri \u0219i \u00eentregiri la biografia lui Gr. Alexandrescu\", in Preocup\u0103ri Literare, Nr. 5/1936, p. 262 During his time in Ia\u0219i, Florescu, supported by physician Anastasie F\u0103tu, also founded and operated an adult high school.Perpessicius (1943), p. 239 ===Clash with Junimea=== In April 1874, a conservative coalition that included Junimea society of Ia\u0219i formed the national government, with Lasc\u0103r Catargiu as Prime Minister. The cabinet had Bonifaciu's cousin, Ion Emanuel Florescu, for a Defense Minister\u2014described by critics as authoritarian in his handling of political opposition.Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 84\u201385; (1935), pp. 163, 192; Theodorian-Carada, pp. 56\u201357 Bonifaciu himself was dismissed immediately by the new Education Minister, Junimist ideologue Titu Maiorescu, who \"could not stand him.\" In his official report, Maiorescu noted that, although Florescu was an erudite, his peculiar teaching style was driving students away. This dispute doubled as a cultural conflict between liberals such as Florescu and Junimea. Florescu spent much of his time in polemics with the minister, and also with the Junimist poet Mihail Eminescu. The latter scandal began in January 1876 with Florescu's derisive note in Rom\u00e2nul. Here, Florescu attacked Junimism (and implicitly Eminescu's work) as a \"torrent of little poets\"\u2014although, in the same text, he praised Eminescu's lover Veronica Micle for her own \"beautiful\" verse.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 241\u2013242; Pop, pp. 59\u201362 Declaring himself dissatisfied with the assonance of Junimist poetry, Florescu demanded a more thorough literary consonance. As noted later by the critic Perpessicius, this request was \"bizarre\" and \"drunk on prosody\", although Florescu had \"his indisputable merits.\"Perpessicius (2001), pp. 62\u201363, 146 Perpessicius also proposes that it formed part of a press campaign \"in bad taste\", \"as vociferous as it was impotent\", seeking to undermine Junimeas steady rise,Perpessicius (2001), p. 85 with Florescu \"in so very many ways, from the pestering to the inept, ready to censor Eminescu's budding oeuvre.\"Perpessicius (1943), p. 214 Florescu's review was immediately challenged by Nicolae Scurtescu, who sent Rom\u00e2nul a letter in which he expressed solidarity with Eminescu, and asked to be struck out from Florescu's list of \"good poets\", suggesting that Florescu had no qualification to compile such lists.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 242\u2013243; Pop, pp. 60\u201361 Eminescu would also respond later in 1876 with the libel Epistol\u0103 deschis\u0103 homunculului Bonifaciu (\"An Open Letter to Bonifaciu the Homunculus\"). Its reference to a mysterious newspaper, Pruncul (\"The Babe\"), was later identified as a jibe at Rom\u00e2nul, whose predecessor was an 1848 sheet, Pruncul Rom\u00e2n (\"The Romanian Infant\").Pop, pp. 58\u201359 The \"letter\", written in tones of \"rising anger\",C\u0103linescu, p. 470 reads: Cartoon in Ghimpele, the liberal magazine, depicting Titu Maiorescu and the \"new direction\" at Junimea (November 1875). The barrel ridden by Maiorescu is marked Instruc\u021biunea public\u0103 (\"Public Instruction\"), in reference to his job as Education Minister C\u0103linescu finds the poem to be a \"vigorous satire\", its reference to \"B. Florescu's 'oakum' brain [...] describing quite well a fibrous arrhythmic state\". By 1880, the \"homunculus\" imagery was rehashed for the early draft of an ample poem, Scrisoarea II, part of which is specifically dedicated to ridiculing Eminescu's detractors.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 232\u2013233; (2001), p. 146; Pop, pp. 59\u201360 As noted by Perpessicius, Florescu, unlike Rosetti, was never mentioned in the more definitive satire, Scrisoarea III. This, he suggests, may be a sign of his relative insignificance among Eminescu's enemies.Perpessicius (2001), pp. 288\u2013289 ===\"Free\" course and 1875 incidents=== Overall, Potra notes, Florescu was largely unemployed, and pushed to make his living by giving private lessons in French\u2014his students included the two daughters of physician Constantin Istrati and the future dramatist Ioan Bacalba\u0219a.Potra, pp. 138\u2013139, 144 \"Turned proletarian\", he and Rose- Henriette lived in rented rooms at Pasajul Roman. Maiorescu only allowed Florescu to teach an optional \"free\" course at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters. The lessons were a corpus of \"critical modern history\" (published as a textbook in 1875), discussing such topics as progressivism, the Ancien R\u00e9gime, British constitutionalism, and German nationalism, as well as the genesis of Wallachian boyardom. They were also indirectly supervised from Paris by professor Henri Pigeonneau, who sent Florescu a bibliography.Potra, pp. 136, 141 Although Florescu expressed his frustration over lacking oratorical skills, the lectures made him very popular with Bucharesters.Potra, pp. 136\u2013137, 142 Florescu's radicalism also brought him into contact with Hristo Botev, instigator of the Bulgarian National Revival, whom Florescu met in Bucharest and perhaps acquainted with the works of B\u0103lcescu.Damian Hurezeanu, Constantin N. Velichi, \"Date noi privind p\u0103trunderea ideilor Interna\u021bionalei I in Rom\u00e2nia \u0219i \u00een r\u00eendurile emigra\u021biei bulgare din \u021bara noastr\u0103\", in Romanoslavica, Vol. XI, 1965, p. 30 Some controversy did occur locally when Florescu expressed his democratic beliefs in his university lectures, describing boyardom as a bane and congratulating his own family for giving up on privilege.Potra, p. 137 His early work as a polemicist includes two volumes of Etiam contra omnes (\"Even against All\"), published alongside the brochure Una suta de adev\u0115rur\u012d (\"A Hundred Truths\").C\u0103linescu, p. 1003; Perpessicius (1943), pp. 239\u2013241, 244; Teodorescu et al., p. 330. See also Sei\u0219anu, pp. 183\u2013184 The latter comprised aphorisms tinged by anti-Junimism, originally appearing in the daily Telegraphul de Bucuresc\u012d, where he also published essays discussing \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie's Discourse on Voluntary Servitude.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 240\u2013241 He kept a grudge against Maiorescu, and, in 1875 letters for Ap\u0103r\u0103torul Lege\u012d newspaper, accused others, notably Cezar Bolliac, of behaving \"like Maiorescu\".Perpessicius (1943), pp. 241, 243 Despite this, in 1877 Florescu was theater chronicler at the Junimea daily, Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103.Iorga (1934 I) p. 252 His journalism was by then prolific, with articles also taken up in Columna lui Traian and Rom\u00e2nul, and also in liberal papers such as Albine \u0219i Viespi, Aleg\u0103torul, and Revista Contimporan\u0103. Some were encyclopedic overviews, with topics such as Pre-Columbian Mexico (1875) and the settlement of Iceland (1877);Potra, pp. 141\u2013142 others were the first in a series of Studi\u012d literare (\"Studies in Literature\") where he carried on with critiques of prosody.C\u0103linescu, pp. 530, 986 Another contribution was as a translator, where he made local literary history with Edgar Allan Poe's \"Tell-Tale Heart\" in 1875, followed in 1876 by \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\".Liviu Cotr\u0103u, \"Edgar Allan Poe in Romanian Translation\", in Emron Esplin, Margarida Vale de Gato (eds.), Translated Poe, p. 77. Lanham: Lehigh University Press & Rowman & Littlefield, 2014. Also in 1875, Florescu involved himself in the dispute between Romania and Austria-Hungary, concerning the Duchy of Bukovina\u2014Romanian-inhabited, but taken by the Austrian Empire following the rearrangement of 1775. His work, published as a brochure co-authored by Vasile Maniu, accused the Austrians of double-dealing and fraud perpetrated against Moldavia and the Ottomans.Potra, p. 141. See also Perpessicius (1943), p. 241 Such ideas endeared him to the Romanian nationalists in Transylvania, which was also under Austro-Hungarian rule. In that region, Florescu's work was displayed as an important contribution in Orientul Latin, the nationalist, Pan-Latinist, anti-Junimist review of Ioan Alexandru Lapedatu.Iorga (1934 I), pp. 116\u2013117 Florescu also involved himself in the dispute over Jewish emancipation: with his school friend Dam\u00e9, he translated into French Hasdeu's Histoire de la tol\u00e9rance religieuse en Roumanie (\"History of Religious Tolerance in Romania\"). Octavian Onea, \"Hasdeu la o sut\u0103 de ani de la moarte\" , in Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103, Nr. 38/2007; Teodorescu et al., p. 331 In April 1875, with help from liberal agitators, Florescu seized the opportunity to lecture on Bukovina at the Romanian Atheneum. The Catargiu government forbade it and threatened him with arrest, though he eventually found an open venue at Suhr Circus, between Calea Victoriei and Lipscani.Bacalba\u0219a (1935), pp. 153\u2013155; Perpessicius (1943), p. 241 Despite his attested incompetence in public speaking, this event attracted a crowd comprising, in some reports, as many as 6,000 nationalists.Bacalba\u0219a (1935), pp. 140, 155; Potra, p. 142 Shortly after the Suhr Circus incident, Romanian liberal groups formed the National Liberal Party, which became focused on regaining power. For three weeks in April 1876, Florescu's cousin was the conservative Prime Minister of a mainly soldiers' cabinet. Outmaneuvered by the opposition, it fell and was replaced with a National Liberal government, headed by Manolache Costache Epureanu\u2014himself replaced after the June election with Ion Br\u0103tianu, supported by the party's radical, or \"Red\", majority.Bacalba\u0219a (1935), pp. 181\u2013190, 281 ===Literatorul=== Literatorul of June 1, 1880, featuring Floescu's essay on the Greek chorus and translations from Henri Murger, alongside poetry by Macedonski, Th. M. Stoenescu, and Carol Scrob During this episode of liberal triumph an intrigue, Florescu befriended the liberal poet Alexandru Macedonski, who sympathized with him in his conflict with Maiorescu. Macedonski wrote a poem denouncing Maiorescu's \"scholarly tribe\" and Florescu's 1874 sacking.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 239\u2013240 Between March and June, Florescu published his own newspaper, the republican and anti- conservative Stindardul (\"The Flag\"), alongside Macedonski and dramatist Pantazi Ghica; however, Macedonski soon quit the enterprise.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 239, 243\u2013244; Potra, pp. 141, 142\u2013143; Tudor Vianu, \"Alexandru Macedonski\", in \u0218erban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne. III: Epoca marilor clasici, p. 455. Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1973 As a \"Red\", Florescu tried but failed to present himself as a candidate in Ilfov County: in primaries, his colleagues preferred Eugeniu St\u0103tescu over him;Bacalba\u0219a (1935), p. 190 in June 1876, he withdrew from Stindardul, declaring himself exhausted by the elections and by his regular work, the \"five hours of daily tutoring\".Perpessicius (1943), p. 244 As noted by memoirist Constantin Bacalba\u0219a, both Florescu and Macedonski had political ambitions and were very popular in liberal circles, but they were also \"transient heroes, the sort that go down with their ephemeral wave.\"Bacalba\u0219a (1935), p. 140 In July 1876, minister Gheorghe Chi\u021bu ruled Florescu's 1873 appointment valid, but only assigned him to a history-and- French teacher's position at Saint Sava High School.Potra, pp. 137, 138 According to the satirical gazette Ghimpele, Florescu, \"erstwhile a communist, yesterday a liberal\", taught his pupils extravagant and inaccurate lessons in history. It also alleged that he skipped classes in order to promote the magazine Nuvelistul, on which he also worked as a writer.Rococo, \"Dou\u0115 celebrit\u0103\u021b\u012d necelebrate de celebrit\u0103\u021bile academice\", in Ghimpele, Nr. 24/1877, p. 2 In 1877\u20131878, the Romanian War of Independence (or more specifically, Romania's contribution to the Russo-Turkish War) opened the way for the country's evolution into a Kingdom of Romania (1880). Although independence occurred under a National Liberal mandate, Bonifaciu's cousin is widely credited with having helped modernize the Romanian Land Forces and getting them battle-ready.Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 100, 154; (1935), pp. 134\u2013136, 173; \u0218erban Cioculescu, \"Ion Ghica\", in \u0218erban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne.

See also Theodorian-Carada, pp. 9\u201310 Bonifaciu also contributed, on the humanitarian side, publishing the collection Quelques vers, which specified that it collected money au profit des bless\u00e9s (\"to help the wounded\").C\u0103linescu, p. 1003; Teodorescu et al., p. 331 Meanwhile, Florescu saw himself as fit to occupy the vacated French- language chair at Bucharest University. However, this was converted into a Romance studies chair by government order, then assigned to Gian Luigi Frollo\u2014the enduring perception was that Br\u0103tianu was clamping down on French influence, for fear of upsetting Germany.Juliette Adam, \"Lettres sur la politique ext\u00e9rieure\", in La Nouvelle Revue, Vol. 72, 1891, p. 412 Florescu tried but failed to obtain a professorship in psychology and aesthetics at Bucharest University, and narrowly lost the race for the Romance chair.Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 408, 430 From January 1880, with Macedonski and Th. M. Stoenescu, Florescu edited a cultural review, Literatorul, where he published notes on the Franco-Prussian WarPotra, p. 142 and his new prose poetry, the \"watercolors\" and \"sanguines\".Marino, p. 521 The embryo of a local Symbolist movement, Literatorul soon became noted for its prolonged polemic with Eminescu, which was carried by both Macedonski and Florescu.Iorga (1934 I), p. 200; Pop, pp. 58\u201359 The latter also censured Macedonski's estranged friend, Duiliu Zamfirescu, who defected to Junimea. When he later alleged that this was for material gain, Zamfirescu simply dismissed him as a zevzec (\"nitwit\").Emanoil Bucu\u021ba, \"Scrisorile trimise de Duiliu Zamfirescu lui Titu Maiorescu\", in Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale, Nr. 6/1935, pp. 580 Florescu himself eventually withdrew from the enterprise after a mysterious quarrel with Macedonski, who then accused him, also in Literatorul, of having squandered public money with his teaching.C\u0103linescu, p. 529 However, according to scholar \u0218erban Cioculescu, Florescu and Stonescu, together with poet-actor Mircea Demetriade\u2014all three \"faint and subdued figures\"\u2014, remained the last Macedonski loyalists as the latter fell into disgrace.\u0218erban Cioculescu, \"Introducere general\u0103\", in \u0218erban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne. III: Epoca marilor clasici, pp. 10\u201311. Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1973 Similarly, critic Adrian Marino notes that, while Macedonski's program was \"constructive, evolved and receptive of the most fecund modern orientations\", its main adherents, Florescu included, were \"insignificant [and] obscure\".Marino, p. 518 His own monthly, Portofoliul Rom\u00e2n (\"The Romanian Portfolio\"), appeared between March 1881 and June 1882, hosting poetry by Demetriade and Florescu's \"watercolors\",X., \"Bibliografie. Portofoliul\", in Convorbiri Literare, Nr. 6/1881, p. 286 as well as his various historical essays\u2014much praised by the Romanophile Frenchman Abdolonyme Ubicini.Potra, pp. 140, 142\u2013143 In a note published therein, he revealed that Portofoliul only existed because of Petru Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu, whose recent law on debt relief had spared Florescu from his creditors. This news was reviewed with amusement in Junimeas Convorbiri Literare, which remarked that literature \"owes so much to Mr. Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu\". The same magazine derided Florescu's attempt to summarize philosophically the history of Austria on five pages: \"The bigger the country, the shorter its philosophy.\" Additionally, Florescu announced that he was working on a fragmentary treatise on the historiosophy of the Balkans, seen by him as a single cultural and racial space.Dumitru Popovici, \"Difuzarea ideilor 'Lumin\u0103rii' \u00een \u021b\u0103rile rom\u00e2ne\", in Studii Literare, Vol. III, 1944, pp. 83, 134 His other contributions included a rhyming obituary to painter Ion Andreescu, taken up in Binele Public newspaper and then carved on Andreescu's tombstone.Potra, p. 141 ===Bohemian=== In 1884, the Florescus moved out of Pasajul Roman and to a small house on Calea Victoriei, with Bonifaciu founding a literary serial, Biblioteca Omulu\u012d de Gust (\"The Library of Tasteful Men\"),Potra, p. 140. See also Bucur, p. 89 where he issued the collected poems of Alexandru Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu.C\u0103linescu, p. 995 The year also witnessed a release of his collected historical essays, as Memento de istorie universal\u0103 sau Istoria \u00een tablour\u012d (\"World History Memento or, History in Scenes\"); his translation of Musset's play \"Never Swear That You Be Not Forsworn\"; and his critical edition of Count Buffon's Discours sur le style.Teodorescu et al., p. 331. See also Bucur, p. 89; C\u0103linescu, pp. 530, 1003 In August of the following year, Rom\u00e2nul had a row with the National Liberal Party, causing Florescu to side with the former. The core issue was again nationalism: Prime Minister Br\u0103tianu gave in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and expelled a group of Transylvanians, including Nicolae Ciurcu, publisher of L'Ind\u00e9pendance Roumaine. When Rom\u00e2nul protested and was raided by police, Florescu showed up to express solidarity, one of several National Liberals to do so\u2014the others were Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu, Dimitrie Gianni, and George D. Pallade.Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 11\u201313 In 1886, his essay on the 1848 revolution was taken up by the same L'Ind\u00e9pendance Roumaine. By then, the historian lived a bohemian life, and was a regular at Fialcovsky Coffeehouse, where he appeared \"jocular and always absent minded\".Livescu, p. 25 According to the recollections of Mariu Theodorian-Carada, although \"Boniface Florescu\" and Demetriade made efforts to keep it alive, by 1886 \"Fialkovsky was dwindling\".Theodorian-Carada, p. 95 Potra notes that Florescu was memorable as a Bucharest \"type\", \"with his quite disheveled appearance, his paddling, slow and measured stride, and above all with his way of life\".Potra, p. 130 Reportedly, he always wore just one galosh,Baba Vi\u0219a, \"R\u0103va\u0219e Intime.

Longinescu, who was schooled at Saint Sava, recalls that his teacher had an unusual, crooked, stride, which matched his handwriting.Longinescu, p. 6 An unnamed Saint Sava alumnus recalled in 1926: \"Just about every day, he would walk the streets reading from a newspaper or a book, and, since he was shortsighted, he kept [it] very close to his eyes, and so he bumped into streetlights or street corners, after which he would present his excuses.\"Potra, p. 139. See also Iorga (1939), p. 338 The writer Maica Smara, who shared a home with Bonifaciu, Henriette-Rose, and sculptor Ion Georgescu in the 1880s, recalls that they \"never once opened a window\", and notes: \"hoopoes did better housecleaning than them.\" Physician Constantin Dimitrescu-Severeanu, who visited his home, records that Bonifaciu and wife slept on a pile of hay, and that Florescu looked like \"he never washed his face more than thrice a year.\"Crutzescu, p. 179 Florescu was a heavy drinker and smoker, and, according to another one- time student, Constantin Kiri\u021bescu, only seemed at ease in coffeehouses and bars; he despised Saint Sava and, with time, only showed up for that work because it paid a salary.Nastas\u0103 (2010), pp. 237\u2013238, 439 According to Dr. Severeanu, he borrowed money from both friends and students, promising that they were for him to write a new book. Longinescu additionally claims that Florescu was \"unusually cultured, but lacked common sense\", and so the victim of \"countless student pranks\".Longinescu, pp. 7\u20138 Among the students who remained loyal to Florescu was the poet Iuliu Cezar S\u0103vescu, who, in 1886, also became a member of Macedonski's circle.Iorga (1934 II), p. 139 While his picturesque demeanor was laughed at, Florescu's erudition was acclaimed, in particular concerning his passionate Saint Sava lessons about 18th-century French literature, which was regarded as his main field of expertise. The courses were published in several installments, from 1887 to 1893, followed by the book edition of Studi\u012d literare.C\u0103linescu, pp. 1003\u20131004; Potra, p. 141; Teodorescu et al., pp. 330\u2013331.

Octavian Oncea, \"I. L. Caragiale... Patru clase primare (\u0219i gimnaziale), sau studii superioare?!\", in Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Nr. 1\u20132/2014 Interested in spiritism, from about 1890 Florescu also attended Hasdeu's s\u00e9ances, alongside Bishop Ghenadie, George Ionescu-Gion, and Ioan S. Neni\u021bescu; Theodor Speran\u021bia acted as medium.C\u0103linescu, p. 372; Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Sic cogito. Ce e via\u021ba?\u2014Ce e moartea?\u2014Ce e omul?, pp. 156, 235. Bucharest: Editura Libr\u0103riei Socec & Co., 1907 In 1892, he produced a volume of his collected poetry, as Ritmur\u012d \u0219i rime (\"Rhythms and Rhymes\"). Its theoretical notes on prosody relaunched the attack on Eminescu, depicting him and the younger Alexandru Vlahu\u021b\u0103 as \"enemies of rhythm and rhyme\"; of the latter two, he favored rhythm, and translated a fragment from Victor Hugo in blank verse, to prove his point. The book also featured his renditions of poems by: Henri Auguste Barbier, Mellin de Saint- Gelais, Charles Baudelaire, Pierre de Ronsard, Alfred de Musset, Cl\u00e9ment Marot, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Isaac de Benserade, Paul Scarron, Alexandre Soutzo, Ponce Lebrun, and Charles Rivi\u00e8re Dufresny.Teodorescu et al., p. 331 His work of the period also covered selections from other classics and moderns of French literature: Moli\u00e8re, Voltaire, Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer, Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Quinet, George Sand, Henri Murger, Paul Armand Silvestre, Th\u00e9odore de Banville, and Jos\u00e9-Maria de Heredia; more exotically, he also rendered into Romanian works by Walter Scott and Fern\u00e1n Caballero, as well as samples of Malagasy and Indian poetry. Also publishing in Giurgiu an anthology of 17th- century poetry in French, he moved house closer to Saint Sava in 1891, at a new address on Soarelui Street, which also became the editorial offices of his new gazette. Called Dumineca (\"The Sunday\"), and published to February 1891, it was co-edited by Demetriade and S\u0103vescu, and possibly managed by the latter.Iorga (1934 II), p. 7 ===1890s irredentism=== University of Bucharest students rallying in support of the Transylvanian Memorandum, 1892 photograph A while after, Florescu's cousin, a prominent figure in the Liberal Conservative Party, briefly served as Prime Minister. Reportedly, Bonifaciu had hopes that Ion Emanuel would reestablish the Bucharest French-language chair and assign him to it, but the relevant minister, G. Dem. Teodorescu, vetoed any such move. The premier was eventually sidelined from within the party by Catargiu, and lost a vote of no confidence, ushering in the February 1892 elections; he died in Paris in May 1893.Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 126\u2013133, 138\u2013142, 154. See also Theodorian-Carada, pp. 11\u201312, 118\u2013119 Around that time, Bonifaciu had begun writing a biography of his father, in French; unpublished, it was later preserved by the B\u0103lcescu Memorial Museum.Bodea et al., p. 18 With Demetriade, he became a regular contributor to S\u0103vescu's own literary magazine, launched in 1893 as Liga Literar\u0103.Iorga (1934 II), pp. 30\u201331 Florescu was also a regular at Grigore Tocilescu's scientific journal, Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie \u0219i Filologie. Tocilescu, his cousin thrice removed, allowed him to publish his notes on B\u0103lcescu's complex mediation between the Hungarians and Romanians of Transylvania.Potra, pp. 141, 143 His own hard-line stance on the Transylvanian issue, expressed during the Transylvanian Memorandum incident of 1892, alienated him further from both dominant parties. By November 1893, he was editing a newspaper called Irredenta Rom\u00e2n\u0103 (\"The Romanian Irredenta\"), his contribution there derided by the National Liberal Dimitrie Sturdza. Sturdza argued that Florescu's goal of annexing Transylvania to the Romanian kingdom was unrealistic; he also declared that such radicalism was only serving Romania's enemies, with Florescu and his colleagues \"either sold out or very incompetent and stupid.\"Eugen Brote, Cestiunea rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een Transilvania \u0219i Ungaria.

Bucharest: Tipografia Voin\u021ba Na\u021bional\u0103, 1895 Joining the nonpartisan Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, Florescu was a direct contributor to its irredentist propaganda, working alongside the Italian sympathizer Roberto Fava.Dimitrie Braharu, Chestiunea rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een Italia \u00een timpul Memorandului, pp. 105, 128. Cluj: Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, 1942 He also helped the young nationalist liberal, Take Ionescu, polishing his letters of protest against Austria- Hungary, written in French. As Ionescu recalled decades later: \"Bonifaciu was a veritable savant, but had endured the unrepentant bohemian. He only worked when we pressed him to, with us looking over his shoulder.\"Sei\u0219anu, p. 96 During this stage of his life, Florescu became close friends with Georges Bibesco, French-speaking son of Prince Gheorghe Bibescu (whom his father and uncles had deposed in 1848). He translated Bibesco's defensive biography of his father, which ran at over 1200 pages in the printed edition of 1893\u20131894.Potra, pp. 142, 143\u2013144 As he noted in a dedication to Bibesco, he considered him a friend through their shared Francophilia, but nonetheless a political adversary.Iorga (1939), p. 338 Bibesco then enlisted Florescu's services in clearing Prince Gheorghe of the allegations that he intended to concede all of Wallachia's mining industry to Russian venture capitalists.Potra, p. 144 Florescu also worked with Theodor Assan and A. Dobrovici on a history of the United Principalities, published as Unirea Rom\u00e2n\u0103 (\"The Romanian Unification\"), and translated Bibesco's tract on the history of Wallachia and Moldavia under Regulamentul Organic. Also in 1894, Florescu was an unsuccessful candidate for the vacated chair of medieval and modern history at Bucharest University\u2014a position ultimately taken up by Nicolae Iorga in 1895.Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 243\u2013245, 430 According to historian Lucian Nastas\u0103, his \"permanent failure\" to obtain academic credentials had an explanation \"as plain as they get: his attitude was openly and actively anti- Junimist.\"Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 430 Reflecting back on the period in 1939, Iorga himself noted: \"Shame that in this literary world of ours, guided by groups and interests, that poor man never heard a good word for that consuming labor of his and for his true talent, inherited from his father.\"Iorga (1939), p. 339 Florescu gathered his Literatorul pieces as Aquarele \u0219i poezi\u012d \u00een proz\u0103 (\"Watercolors and Prose Poems\"), with contributions by Demetriade and a C. Dr\u0103gulinescu, and with samples from Murger.Teodorescu et al., p. 330 His work for 1894 additionally included the first volume of a French\u2013Romanian dictionary (comprising 6 volumes in all), followed in 1895 by an overview of French lyrical poetry \"between the 10th and 20th centuries\".C\u0103linescu, p. 1004; Potra, pp. 141, 143; Teodorescu et al., p. 331 In his final years, Florescu made one more attempt at founding a review\u2014the 1894 weekly Dacia Viitoare (\"Future Dacia\")\u2014and contributed an overview of the Horea\u2013Clo\u0219ca rebellion to the Symbolist journal Revista Oriental\u0103.Potra, pp. 140, 141, 142 ===Later years and death=== Florescu eventually resigned from Saint Sava, but continued to teach history and French at Mihai Viteazul High School, at the military high school, and at the Saint Nephon seminary.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Teodorescu et al., p. 331.

Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1973 For a while director of a new magazine, \u021aara Literar\u0103 (\"The Literary Country\"), he was also a contributor to Ion Livescu's Revista Theatrelor, aimed at the community of actors and theater aficionados.Livescu, p. 34 Livescu saw him as one of the great critics in the field, equal to Ionescu-Gion and Grigore Ventura.Livescu, p. 59 In 1896, with S\u0103vescu, Florescu began translating from a history of Albanian literature (in Italian, by Alberto Stratic\u00f2).Nicolae Iorga, Albania \u0219i Rom\u00e2nia, p. 8. V\u0103lenii de Munte: Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc, 1915 By then, Florescu had published over 200 books, comprising his own works alongside translations, and had had his own verse anthologized by poet Radu D. Rosetti (in Cartea Dragoste\u012d, 1896). Before August 1899, Florescu's work was hampered by an illness, later diagnosed as ventricular hypertrophy; he was living with his family in a small house on Speran\u021bei Street, north of Col\u021bea Hospital.Potra, pp. 144\u2013145. See also C\u0103linescu, p. 530 Luxi\u021ba Florescu died in October of that year, aged 83,C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, pp. 135, 144 and Bonifaciu only two months later, on December 18. Demetriade unexpectedly dropped by on a visit just after his friend's death, recalling: \"he had woken up more joyful than ever. Always one to enjoy a pun, he asked his wife, whose name was Rose, to hand him a rose that had been left in some glass. Just after Madam Florescu handed him that flower, the soul of this man, always a poet, went out with the perfume of the rose.\"Potra, p. 145 A brief obituary in Literatorul credited him as someone \"illustrious but unhappy\", who \"stood up to the intellectual degeneracy into which our country was continuously pushed.\"\"Bonifaciu Florescu \u2014 A \u00eencetat din via\u021b\u0103\" in Literatorul, Nr. 1/1900, p. 4 He was buried in the family crypt at \u021aig\u0103ne\u0219ti Monastery, next to his mother, with a funeral ceremony attended by the Bucharest aristocracy and the Saint Sava students.Potra, pp. 135, 145. See also C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Crutzescu, p. 490 The grave has since been lost during extensive repair work on the monastery grounds.Potra, p. 146 Florescu was survived by both his wife and his son. In 1900, Henriette-Rose took a small pension from the state, awarded to her by a review committee which included Costache B\u0103lcescu.Potra, pp. 145\u2013146 She lived for 28 more years, to January 1928.C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 145 Ion, an officer in the Romanian Land Forces, married in February 1910 Elena Kalinderu, a relative of agriculturist and art collector Ioan Kalinderu.C\u0103linescu, p. 1004; Potra, p. 140 He had two children of his own: Mircea Ioan (born 1912, killed in a car accident in 1929), and judge Ion \"Nelu\" Florescu, who emigrated to Brazil and was still alive in 1941. Bonifaciu Florescu's work and family history gained more exposure after the August 1944 coup and during early Romanian communism, when left-wing ideologies turned B\u0103lcescu into their hero. At the time, Potra notes, the Florescus came to accept Bonifaciu's paternity, published secret notes and rare photographs, and even helped Camil Petrescu write his romanticized biography of the revolutionary.Potra, pp. 130\u2013131 In the 1950s, Soviet historiography proposed that Florescu was secretly a Communard, and that he supported Sergey Nechayev, the Russian revolutionist, providing him with his own passport. The claim was reviewed with skepticism by the Romanian scholar Georges Haupt, who noted that \"Florescu\" was actually a certain N. F. Melediu.Haupt Gheorghe, \"Influen\u021ba \u00een Rom\u00e2nia a revistei Colocol (Clopotul) editat\u0103 la Londra de revolu\u021bionarul democrat rus A. I. Herzen (1860\u20131870)\", in Studii. Revist\u0103 de Istorie \u0219i Filosofie, Nr. 4/1950, p. 111 As noted in the 1980s by Potra, the real Florescu had been causally forgotten, despite being both B\u0103lcescu's heir and, on his own, \"a distinguished scholar, a true encyclop\u00e9diste.\"Potra, pp. 129\u2013130 ==Literary work== George C\u0103linescu saw Florescu as a characteristic product of the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, his didactic art \"decent\" but \"convoluted and timid, overwhelmed by ideas of classicism\".C\u0103linescu, p. 530; Potra, p. 141 His lyrical poetry respects all the criteria that he wanted to impose on Eminescu; nonetheless, critics argue, it is not ungraceful, nor devoid of sentiment.C\u0103linescu, pp. 530\u2013531; Perpessicius (1943), pp. 244\u2013245; Potra, p. 141 However, according to Potra, his 1883 epitaph for Ion Andreescu is \"very dull, in pointless verses which tell us nothing about the value of our great painter.\" As seen by comparatist Marin Bucur, Florescu's work in verse was already culturally irrelevant by 1875.Bucur, p. 29 As a literary innovator directly inspired by Catulle Mend\u00e8s,C\u0103linescu, p. 531; Potra, p. 141 Florescu tied to popularize a genre prose poetry \"from life\", the so-called \"watercolors\" or \"sanguines\". According to Adrian Marino, these were among the more adequate and modern samples of Literatorul prose\u2014alongside those by S\u0103vescu, Constantin Cantilli, and D. Teleor; the rest were \"tendentious, abstract\", and \"dependent\" on Macedonski's verdicts. Received with sarcasm by other critics, they include fragments about blind and insane children, or about children sleeping in each other's arms, and, as comparatist Mihai Zamfir argues, were \"experiments [...] pushed into oblivion\" by the more mature Symbolist prose poetry of \u0218tefan Petic\u0103 (ca. 1900). Mihai Zamfir, \"\u0218tefan Petic\u0103 \u2013 suavul vis\u0103tor\" , in Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103, Nr. 42/2009 His epistolary novel, Etiam contra omnes, depicts the worldview of \"Recaredo\", a Peruvian spiritist and Pan-Latinist intellectual. It impressed a young Take Ionescu, who found Recaredo to be the perfect human, and his racial ideology a symbol of Romania's own discords with her various neighbors.Perpessicius (1943), pp. 223, 239; Sei\u0219anu, pp. 183\u2013184 As Florescu informed his readers, these were \"pages written at a time when only literature was my comfort\"\u2014words expressing, again, his enmity for Junimea. The novel, Ionescu believed, had a mission to \"instill Romanianism\", and also to cultivate solidarity between Romanians and Greeks.Sei\u0219anu, p. 184 Florescu also earned some attention as a literary essayist, popularizer, and critic\u2014much inspired by four scholars, whom he deemed the elite of French literature: Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Villemain, Sainte-Beuve, Hippolyte Taine, and Emile Hennequin.Bucur, p. 88 C\u0103linescu stresses that Florescu's opening lesson of 1873 was \"a lamentable rigmarole that addressed the issue of historical objectivity\". Later tracts were \"wordy, without proper ranking of values\". According to Bucur, Florescu was an \"amateur\", \"textbook cultivated\", \"a cultural journalist enthusiastic about beauty and culture, taking pains not to fatigue a public that cannot sustain the effort.\"Bucur, pp. 88\u201389 According to Iorga, his exposition was \"always lively, not without fortunate characterizations\"\u2014such as when Florescu depicted Danton as a \"poor man's Mirabeau\". Overall, however, Iorga referred to Florescu as a \"bizarre\" or \"weird\" author.Iorga (1934 I), pp. 117, 252; Perpessicius (1943), p. 239 Similarly, the anti-Symbolist Ilarie Chendi viewed Florescu as \"cultured, but ill-regulated\".Ilarie Chendi, \"Via\u021ba literar\u0103. Iar\u0103\u0219 despre decaden\u021bii no\u0219tri.\u2014Pe cine pre\u021buesc ei.\u2014Pe cine pre\u021buim noi?\u2014Un decadent simpatic.\u2014Cei m\u0103run\u021bi\", in Tribuna, Nr. 261/1909, p. 1 Although marginally supportive of Symbolism, Florescu was noticeably unimpressed by its herald Baudelaire, and, Bucur writes, \"understood nothing from Mallarm\u00e9 and Verlaine\". Chendi saw Florescu as the instigator of Romania's Decadent movement, which revolved around a cult for Baudelaire; however, he believed that Florescu's particular contribution was reviving another cult, that of romantic poets: Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, and Alexandru Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu, whom Florescu rated \"above Eminescu\". In 1878, he also described a non-Symbolist poet, Ronetti Roman, as a master, Romania's answer to Musset and Heinrich Heine.\"Diverse. Unu poetu teneru de mare viitoriu\", in Biseric'a si Scol'a. F\u00f3ia Biseric\u00e9sca, Scolastica, Literaria si Economica, Nr. 13/1878, p. 102 Some reviewers attribute Macedonski's affection for Florescu to the latter's \"attachment to French culture\"Bucur, p. 89 or, more precisely, to Macedonski's snobbery: \"A writer turned proletarian and with relations all across the world, who descended from Michael the Brave, from N. B\u0103lcescu, and from some of the leading princely families, with relatives in Portugal, England and India\u2014that catered to Macedonski's preferences.\" ==Published books== *Etiam contra omnes (2 vols.), Bucharest, 1875 *Una suta de adev\u0115rur\u012d, Bucharest, 1875 *Cursu facultativu de istoria moderna critica, Bucharest, 1875 *R\u0103pirea Bucovine\u012d (with Vasile Maniu), Bucharest, 1875 *Quelques vers au profit des bless\u00e9s, Bucharest, 1877 *Memento de istorie universal\u0103 sau Istoria \u00een tablour\u012d, Bucharest, 1883 *Curs metodic de limba franc\u012duz\u00e8sc\u0103, Bucharest, 1887 *Sanguine (translated from Catulle Mend\u00e8s and followed by Sanguine rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti), Bucharest, 1889 *Morceaux choisis, XVII-e si\u00e8cle.
