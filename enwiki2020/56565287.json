His father, Ivan Akimovich Mal\u2019tsov expanded the family business, previously based on glass and linen production by developing the metallurgy industry in Lyudinovo, Kaluga Oblast. From this basis Sergei developed the Mal\u2019tsov industrial region an area which covered about 215,000 hectares mostly along the Bolva River. He turned the industrial region into a major centre of machine building. It was here that the first rails, locomotives, steamships, and screw propellers were made in Russia. By 1875, Mal\u2019tsov was able to found a corporation which included over 30 enterprises with a combined capital of 6 million rubles. These works were nationalised in 1885. ==References== Category:1810 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Russian businesspeople ",
