The important water resource is the Yom River. ==History== Originally named Mueang as the capital district of Sukhothai Province, in 1917 the district was renamed Thani (). In 1932, the province Sukhothai was abolished and merged into Sawankhalok Province. In 1939 the province was renamed Sukhothai, and the district, by then named Sukhothai Thani () was renamed Mueang Sukhothai. ==Administration== The district is divided into 10 sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 98 villages (mubans). The town (thesaban mueang) Sukhothai Thani covers tambon Thani. There are a further two sub-district municipalities (thesaban tambon): Ban Suan and Mueang Kao, each covering parts of the same- named tambons. There are a further nine tambon administrative organizations (TAO). {| ! No. ! Name ! Thai ! Villages !
