    "text": "The 1988\u201389 Courage Area League South was the second full season of rugby union within the fourth tier of the English league system, currently known as National League 2 South, and counterpart to Courage Area League North (now known as National League 2 North). Lydney won the championship despite having an identical win/draw/lose record to Havant in second place, and finished top due to a superior points difference, gaining promotion to the 1989\u201390 National Division Three. Three teams were relegated; Ealing (to London Division 1), Stroud (to South West Division 1) and Sidcup (to London Division 1). Last season Sidcup finished second, and this season lost all ten matches. ==Structure== Each team played one match against each of the other teams, playing a total of ten matches each. This was the first season of fixed Saturdays for league matches. The champions are promoted to National Division 3 and the last three teams are relegated to either London 1 or South West 1 depending on their locality. ==Participating teams and locations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Ground !Capacity !City/Area !Previous season |- | Camborne || Recreation Ground || 9,000 || Camborne, Cornwall || 4th |- | Cheltenham || Prince of Wales || 2,000 || Cheltenham, Gloucestershire || 10th |- | Ealing || Horsenden Hill || || Horsenden Hill, Ealing, London || Promoted from London 1 (champions) |- | Havant || Hook's Lane || 1,500 || Havant, Hampshire || 5th |- | Lydney || Regentsholme || 1,500 || Lydney, Gloucestershire || 3rd |- | Redruth || Recreation Ground || 12,000 || Redruth, Cornwall || Promoted from South West 1 (champions) |- | Salisbury || Castle Road || 1,500 || Salisbury, Wiltshire || 9th |- | Sidcup || Crescent Farm || || Sidcup, Kent || 2nd |- | Southend || Warners Park || || Southend, Essex || 7th |- | Stroud || Fromehall Park || || Stroud, Gloucestershire || 6th |- | Sudbury || Moorsfield || || Sudbury, Suffolk || 8th |} ==League table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |- bgcolor= |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"| {|border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- |width=20% style=\"border:0px\"| |style=\"border:0px\"|1988\u201389 Courage Area League South Table |width=20% style=\"border:0px\" align=right| |} |- !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"195\"|Club !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Played !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Won !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Drawn !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Lost !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points for !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points against !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points diff !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points |- bgcolor=#d8ffeb align=centre | 1 ||align=left| Lydney (C) || 10 || 8 || 1 || 1 || 240 || 98 || 142 || 17 |- align=center | 2 ||align=left| Havant || 10 || 8 || 1 || 1 || 177 || 92 || 85 || 17 |- align=center | 3 || align=left| Camborne || 10 || 6 || 1 || 3 || 198 || 126 || 72 || 13 |- align=center | 4 || align=left| Redruth || 10 || 6 || 1 || 3 || 136 || 81 || 55 || 13 |- align=center | 5 || align=left| Sudbury || 10 || 5 || 1 || 4 || 141 || 89 || 52 || 11 |- align=center | 6 || align=left| Cheltenham || 10 || 4 || 2 || 4 || 122 || 151 || \u221229 || 10 |- align=center | 7 || align=left| Salisbury || 10 || 4 || 1 || 5 || 113 || 139 || \u221226 || 7 |- align=center | 8 || align=left| Southend || 10 || 4 || 0 || 6 || 116 || 168 || \u221252 || 8 |- bgcolor=#ffcccc align=center | 9 || align=left| Ealing (R) || 10 || 3 || 0 || 7 || 144 || 188 || \u221244 || 6 |- bgcolor=#ffcccc align=center | 10 || align=left| Stroud (R) || 10 || 3 || 0 || 7 || 119 || 180 || \u221261 || 6 |- bgcolor=#ffcccc align=center | 11 || align=left| Sidcup (R) || 10 || 0 || 0 || 10 || 74 ||168 || \u221294 || 0 |- |colspan=\"15\"| *Points are awarded as follows: # 2 pts for a win # 1 pt for a draw # 0 pts for a loss # If teams are level at any stage, difference between points for and against applies |-|align=left| |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px;font-size:85%;\"| Green background is the promotion place.
