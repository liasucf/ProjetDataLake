This broadcast became the highest-rated public television program ever at that time, far surpassing viewership expectations. He was also taught sociology at the City College of New York for three and a half years. Shortly after the 1972 World Championship ended, he began writing a syndicated column about chess for Newsday; at its peak, this column was published in 82 newspapers around the world. He later hosted a two-hour broadcast covering the World Chess Championship 1986. This segment was recorded at WNYE-TV in Brooklyn and aired on 120 public television stations. ==Chess playing career== Lyman won the Boston Chess Championship as a teenager.
