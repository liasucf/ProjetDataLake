    "text": "Dead Bees Records is a French independent record label, with a roster of indie rock artists and bands. ==History== Dead Bees Records was started in 2003 by two Toulouse-based musicians, Seb Wood (from Call Me Loretta) and Seb Duclos (from the Nova Express, Fuck Buddies), under the terms of an unincorporated association. The label was named after a quote from the Howard Hawks movie To Have and Have Not: \"Was you ever bit by a dead bee?\". The label was initially intended to release the debut recordings by Call Me Loretta or the Nova Express, but soon expanded its scope by importing or promoting international acts. Dead Bees was the first French label to work with Bomp! Records, The Committee to Keep Music Evil and Celluloid Dreams to bring the Brian Jonestown Massacre to French audiences. Dead Bees later added numerous French, U.S. and British artists to its roster, and has earned acclaim for the label's yearly record sampler, released through creative commons license. Black Bees Records, the African division of Dead Bees Records, was created in 2014. The first release was Nigerian band La\u00efka's debut album. ==Roster== === Current roster === * All in The Golden Afternoon * Alone In 1982 * The Black Feathers * Brian Coatsie * Call Me Loretta * The Chemistry Set * Cotton Club * D.
