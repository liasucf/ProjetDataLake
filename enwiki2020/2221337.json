Radziszowski was born in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, and received his PhD from the Institute of Informatics of the University of Warsaw in 1980. His thesis topic was \"Logic and Complexity of Synchronous Parallel Computations\". From 1976 to 1980 he worked as a visiting professor in various universities in Mexico City. In 1984, he moved to the United States, where he took up a position in the Department of Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Radziszowski has published many papers in graph theory, Ramsey theory, block designs, number theory and computational complexity. In a 1995 paper with Brendan McKay he determined the Ramsey number R(4,5)=25. His survey of Ramsey numbers, last updated in March 2017, is a standard reference on the subject and published at the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. ==References== ==External links== * Radziszowski's survey of small Ramsey numbers * Home Page * Sound file of Radziszowski speaking his own name (au format) Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Polish academics Category:Polish mathematicians Category:Polish computer scientists Category:Rochester Institute of Technology faculty Category:Combinatorialists Category:University of Warsaw alumni ",
