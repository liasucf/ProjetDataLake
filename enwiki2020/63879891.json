    "text": "The Second Massimov Cabinet was the 9th composition under the Government of Kazakhstan that was led by Karim Massimov. It was formed on 2 April 2014 after Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov resigned from office just weeks after Kazakhstan's currency tenge lost its value, causing an inflation which led to protests in the cities. As a result, President Nursultan Nazarbayev appointed Massimov, who was quickly approved by the Parliament to be the Prime Minister due to his previous record of promoting business-friendly policies during his previous term as the Prime Minister from 2007 to 2012. The government ended after President Nazarbayev appointed Massimov as the head of the National Security Committee on 8 September 2016. Massimov was succeeded by his First Deputy Bakhytzhan Sagintayev who led the new government after he was confirmed by the Parliament the next day on 9 September. == Composition == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Functions ! colspan=\"2\" |Holder !Start !End |- |Prime Minister |145x145px |Karim Massimov |2 April 2014 |8 September 2016 |- |First Deputy Prime Minister |129x129px |Bakhytzhan Sagintayev |16 January 2013 |8 September 2016 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |131x131px |Bakhyt Sultanov |6 November 2013 |11 November 2018 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |144x144px |Gulshara Abdykhalikova |28 November 2013 |11 November 2014 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |133x133px |Berdibek Saparbayev |11 November 2014 |11 September 2015 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |128x128px |Dariga Nazarbayeva |11 September 2015 |13 September 2016 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |135x135px |Askar Myrzakhmetov |14 June 2016 |15 December 2017 |- |Prime Minister's Office |138x138px |Erlan Qo\u015fanov |2 January 2012 |27 March 2017 |- |Ministry of Foreign Affairs |139x139px |Erlan Idrissov |28 September 2012 |28 December 2016 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Defense |140x140px |Serik Akhmetov |3 April 2014 |22 October 2014 |- |133x133px |Imangali Tasmagambetov |22 October 2014 |12 September 2016 |- |Ministry of Emergency Situations |131x131px |Vladimir Bozhko |13 November 2007 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Internal Affairs |137x137px |Kalmukhambet Kassymov |11 April 2011 |12 February 2019 |- |Ministry of Civil Service | |Talgat Donakov |29 December 2015 |13 September 2016 |- |Ministry of Information and Communications |132x132px |Dauren Abaev |6 May 2016 |25 February 2019 |- |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Agriculture | |Asyljan Mamytbekov |11 April 2011 |6 May 2016 |- |138x138px |Askar Myrzakhmetov |6 May 2016 |15 December 2017 |- |Ministry of Justice |131x131px |Berik Imashev |20 January 2012 |13 September 2016 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Education and Science | |Aslan Sarinjipov |2 September 2013 |10 February 2016 |- | |Erlan Sagadiev |10 February 2016 |25 February 2019 |- |Ministry of Healthcare | |Salidat Qaiyrbekova |7 October 2010 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population | rowspan=\"2\" |141x141px | rowspan=\"2\" |Tamara Duisenova |27 June 2013 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development |6 August 2014 |25 January 2017 |- |Ministry of Transport and Communications |134x134px |Zhenis Kassymbek |7 March 2014 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Industry and New Technologies | rowspan=\"2\" |134x134px | rowspan=\"2\" |Asset Issekeshev |12 March 2010 |6 August 2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Investment and Development |6 August 2014 |21 June 2016 |- |134x134px |Zhenis Kassymbek |21 June 2016 |25 February 2019 |- |Ministry of Culture | rowspan=\"2\" |130x130px | rowspan=\"2\" |Arystanbek Muhamediuly |11 March 2014 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Culture and Sports |6 August 2014 |17 June 2019 |- |Ministry of Economic Integration |110x110px |Zhanar Aitzhanova |16 April 2011 |11 May 2016 |- |Ministry of Finance |130x130px |Bakhyt Sultanov |6 November 2013 |11 November 2018 |- |Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning | rowspan=\"2\" |128x128px | rowspan=\"2\" |Erbolat Dosaev |16 January 2013 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of National Economy |6 August 2014 |5 May 2016 |- |Ministry of Environment and Water |134x134px |Nurlan Kapparov |4 April 2014 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Oil and Gas | |Uzakbay Karabalin |3 July 2013 |4 August 2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Energy |141x141px |Vladimir Shkolnik |6 August 2014 |25 March 2016 |- |133x133px |Kanat Bozumbayev |25 March 2016 |18 December 2019 |} == References == Category:Cabinets of Kazakhstan Category:2014 in Kazakhstan Category:Cabinets established in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Kazakhstan ",
