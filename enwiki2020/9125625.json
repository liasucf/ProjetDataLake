They faced a Bradford City side who had earned their highest position in the league. Newcastle's preparations were upset by long-term injuries to England international centre-forward Albert Shepherd and Peter McWilliam. Bradford's team showed just one surprise with Scottish centre-half Willie Gildea drafted in for just his 10th game for the club. The first match at Crystal Palace ended goalless after extra time meaning for the second successive year the final went to a replay. City made one change to their team for the replay with Bob Torrance coming in for Gildea, who never played for City again. Newcastle's team remained unchanged. The replay, which took place at Old Trafford, was settled by a single goal for Bradford, a header scored by captain Jimmy Speirs. It was a new trophy that Speirs lifted, appropriately made by Bradford jewellers Fattorini's. The cup triumph remains Bradford's only major honour. ==Match details== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| |- |GK||Mark Mellors |- | ||Robert Campbell |- | ||David Taylor |- | ||George Robinson |- |CH||Willie Gildea |- | ||Jimmy McDonald |- |OR||Peter Logan |- | ||Jimmy Speirs (c) |- | ||Frank O'Rourke |- | ||Archie Devine |- | ||Frank Thompson |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4|Peter O'Rourke |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=4| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| |- |GK||Jimmy Lawrence |- | ||Billy McCracken |- | ||Tony Whitson |- | ||Colin Veitch (c) |- | ||Wilf Low |- | ||David Willis |- | ||Jock Rutherford |- | ||George Jobey |- | ||Jimmy Stewart |- | ||Sandy Higgins |- | ||George Wilson |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4|The Directors Committee |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *Replay if scores still level. *No substitutions. |} ===Replay=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| |- |GK||Mark Mellors |- | ||Robert Campbell |- | ||David Taylor |- | ||George Robinson |- |CH||Bob Torrance |- | ||Jimmy McDonald |- |OR||Peter Logan |- | ||Jimmy Speirs (c) |- | ||Frank O'Rourke |- | ||Archie Devine |- | ||Frank Thompson |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4|Peter O'Rourke |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=4| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| |- |GK||Jimmy Lawrence |- | ||Billy McCracken |- | ||Tony Whitson |- | ||Colin Veitch (c) |- | ||Wilf Low |- | ||David Willis |- | ||Jock Rutherford |- | ||George Jobey |- | ||Jimmy Stewart |- | ||Sandy Higgins |- | ||George Wilson |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4|The Directors Committee |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *No substitutions. |} ==References== * == External links == *Match report at www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk *1911 FA Cup winners... *FA Cup Final kits 1911 FA Cup Category:Bradford City A.F.C. matches Category:Newcastle United F.C. matches Category:April 1911 sports events Category:1911 sports events in London ",
