His Collegian Press, Inc. bought the existing magazine College Humor from Dell Publishing by the mid-1930s, publishing it through 1942. In mid-1936, Pines refuted a claim by the Cartoonists Guild of America that College Humor had not agreed to pay the $15 Guild minimum, payable within 30 days, for drawings by Guild members. In October 1952, his Standard Magazines purchased Silver Screen and Screenland from the Henry Publishing company. Pines added comic books to the mix in 1939 with the publishing imprint Standard Comics,Standard at the Grand Comics Database which became in turn the parent company of two comic-book lines: Better PublicationsBetter Publications at the Grand Comics Database and Nedor Publishing.Nedor Publishing at the Grand Comics Database Collectors and historians sometimes refer to them collectively as \"Standard/Better/Nedor\". In 1942, Pines founded the paperback book publisher Popular Library, remaining its president through 1966 and serving as chairman through 1968. He retired in 1971 and continued as a consultant.

He was a leader of the publishers' division of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and United Jewish Appeal in December 1949 when he was elected to the board of director of the New York Guild for the Jewish Blind, and was made a life trustee of the Federation in 1968. As of at least mid-1960, he was a member of the board of the Magazine Publishers Association. Pines' brother Robert, who died of a heart attack at age 52 on August 8, 1949, was a 1918 Columbia University graduate who practiced law from 1921 to 1935 before becoming editor and publisher of College Humor magazine; in 1941, he became editor and publisher of See magazine.

The couple had two daughters: Judith Ann Bernard, born July 25, 1939, and Susan, born May 8, 1942. The family lived at 965 Fifth Avenue during this the time. By mid-1963, when Judith announced her engagement to Anthony Edward Marks, a Columbia University doctoral candidate in anthropology, Pines and his wife were separated or divorced, he living at 605 Park Avenue and Jacquelyn at 767 Fifth Avenue.
