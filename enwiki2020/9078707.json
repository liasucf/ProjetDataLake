By 2007 between Longswamp and Rangiriri was three lanes with a median barrier. In 2012 the Te Rapa Spur was opened, followed by the Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia section in 2013. The Cambridge bypass opened on 16 December 2015, six months ahead of schedule. The route has now been fully designated, and funding was secured for the Huntly and Hamilton sections. The Huntly section opened in March 2020, but the Hamilton section was delayed due to the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. The 15 km Cambridge Section now has a 110kmph speed limit for light vehicles as of 11 December 2017. == Bay of Plenty == === Takitimu Drive (Pyes Pa - Mount Maunganui Expressway) (SH 2/SH 29) === From Pyes Pa to Chapel Street near the city centre. An interchange exists with Tamatea Arikinui Drive, along with a \"coat-hanger\" interchange, which is used with Elizabeth Street and heads north towards Mt Maunganui. The section from Pyes Pa to the SH 2 interchange is tolled. From 1 August 2015 it was added to the New Zealand state highway network as part of SH 29. === Tamatea Arikinui Drive (Bethlehem - The Avenues Expressway) (SH 2) === From 15th Avenue to just before Bethlehem Town Centre, with interchanges at Cambridge Road, Waihi Road and Takitimu Drive (Pyes Pa - City Expressway). === Tauranga Eastern Link (SH 2) === Connects Tauranga to Paengaroa (with SH 33) via Papamoa, bypassing Te Puke. In late 2006 the first phase was opened from Maungatapu to Bayfair. Full motorway was completed in 2015 with the tolled section between Papamoa and Paengaroa opened to the public in August that year. The tolled section from Papamoa to Paengaroa now has speed limit for light vehicles of 110 kmph as of 11 December 2017 == Hawke's Bay == ===Hawke's Bay Expressway (SH 2)=== From SH 2 at Hawke's Bay Airport to SH 2 at Pakipaki, south of Hastings. == Wellington == === Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway (SH 1) === Approximately in length, this was New Zealand's first motorway. The first section opened in 1950. === Wellington Urban Motorway (SH 1) === From Ngauranga to Te Aro, === Kapiti Expressway (SH 1) === The Kapiti Expressway is an under-construction four-lane grade- separated expressway, stretching from Mackays Crossing north of Paekakariki to just north of \u014ctaki on the Kapiti Coast. When completed, it will bypass the existing two-lane State Highway 1 through Raumati, Paraparaumu, Waikanae and \u014ctaki. The section from Mackays Crossing to south of Raumati was completed in 2007 with the grade separation of the Mackays railway level crossing. Work on the Raumati to Peka Peka started in December 2013 and opened on 24 February 2017, with minor finishing works completed by July. Construction of the section from Peka Peka north to \u014ctaki commenced in late 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2020. === Transmission Gully Motorway (SH 1) === Under construction, from Mackays Crossing near Paraparaumu to the Johnsonville- Porirua Motorway, bypassing Centennial Highway. === Hutt Expressway (Hutt Road, Western Hutt Road, River Road) (SH 2) === From the Wellington Urban Motorway at Ngauranga through the Hutt Valley to the Fergusson Drive intersection at Maoribank in northern Upper Hutt. It has three names: Hutt Road from Ngauranga to Petone, Western Hutt Road from Petone to Silverstream, and River Road from Silverstream to Maoribank. . The section south of Melling is dual carriage and is fully grade separated. The section from Melling north to Silverstream is dual carriage with a mixture of at-grade and grade separated intersections. The section north of Silverstream is a 2+1 road with at grade intersections. == Canterbury == === Christchurch Northern Motorway (SH 1) === From north of Kaiapoi over the Waimakariri River through to the northern suburb of Belfast. Its southernmost interchange (Kainga/Marshland) is unusual in that northbound traffic merges from the right, while southbound traffic is carried on a large loop to the right up and over the onramp. The reason for this design was to accommodate a future southern extension into central Christchurch, with the northbound onramp being the first part of the northbound carriageway. Northbound there are three more interchanges; Tram Road (Oxford), north off, south on; Kaiapoi (diamond interchange); and Lineside Road ( to Rangiora), north off, south on. It is dual carriageway from Belfast (Main North Road) to Lineside Road, single lane each way with no median strip to Woodend. === Christchurch Southern Motorway (SH 76) === Short motorway bypassing a part of southern Christchurch city. Lost its status as a motorway after plans to extend the original section (between Curletts Road and Barrington Street, which was built in the early 1980s) stalled. Since 2012, the road has been extended from Curletts Road to Halswell Junction Road with the original section widened to four lanes and interchanges at both Curletts Road and Barrington Street), thereby regaining motorway status. === Christchurch-Lyttelton Motorway (SH 74) === From the intersection of Ferry and Dyers Roads along Tunnel Road through the Lyttelton Tunnel to the intersection of Norwich Quay and Simeon Quay. It is single lane with interchanges at Bridle Path and Port Hills Road. There is a passing lane southbound from the Port Hills Road interchange. === Western Belfast Bypass (SH 1) === == Otago == === Former Dunedin Northern Motorway (SH 1) === This undivided highway had its \"motorway\" signs removed several years ago, and is now called Dunedin-Waitati Highway.

It is one of the southernmost motorways in the world. The length of the motorway is only 13 km. == See also == *New Zealand state highway network ==References== Motorways And Expressways In New Zealand Category:Transport in Auckland ",
