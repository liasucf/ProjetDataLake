Like many other friends, she quickly develops spiritual powers of her own after Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper. Throughout the series, Orihime learns about Ichigo's duty as a Soul Reaper and decides to accompany him when he goes to Soul Society to save Rukia Kuchiki. Besides the manga series, Orihime has also appeared in other media from Bleach franchise, including the anime series, animated films, video games and rock musicals. She has been fairly popular among readers of the manga since her introduction, having ranked within the top 10 or the top 20 in all of the characters popularity polls of the series. Additionally, various pieces of merchandising have been developed based on her appearance such as figurines and key chains. Publications from manga, anime and other media have also commented on her character with most praising her traits and development. In the animated adaptations of Bleach, Orihime is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka in Japanese. In the English adaptations, she is voiced by Stephanie Sheh. ==Creation and conception== Along with Ichigo Kurosaki, Orihime has the hardest face to draw according to Tite Kubo. Due to her importance in the manga, Kubo wanted more practice drawing her so that it would be easier to do so.Weekly Shonen Jump interview, year 2004, issue 42 When Kubo was asked to make a cover with a female character during Christmas, Kubo initially thought of using Rukia Kuchiki; However, he later changed to use Orihime as he thought she was more suitable for such a role. She becomes the true female lead for the rest of the Bleach franchise after the second anime season/manga arc, which was recognized when her character depth and importance raised drastically after she came back from the Soul Society and started to become a prominent plot device for Ichigo's character development and for the story itself, consequently Orihime was featured along with female leads from other Weekly Shonen Jump series on a special Shonen Jump cover.\"Gathering of Heroines\". Weekly Shonen Jump 2006-36+37: Cover. Stephanie Sheh, Orihime's English voice actress, found Orihime to be a \"tricky\" character as she noted a challenge to find a balance with her voice as although she sometimes seems ditzy, in other times she is very strong. ==Character outline== Orihime is friendly, humorous, sensitive and kind. She comes off as na\u00efve and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Her cooking style can be described as very bad, disgusting, or more often strange to the point that aside from Rangiku Matsumoto, no one would think it delectable, and is one of the running jokes in the series. Orihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing or even dangerous consequences. She tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as initially fantasizing a date with Ichigo, later ending into her becoming a boxing champion prior to being shot. Her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Orihime experiences most feelings, which leads her to be jealous of the relationship that Ichigo and Rukia Kuchiki share despite her friendship and admiration of both of them. Through her expanding role in the manga, Orihime was happier and goofier at the start of the series, but later arcs deal with her feelings of inadequacy and inner turmoils. Orihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by her distant aunt provided that she continuously obtain good marks in school, which she does. She and her brother Sora were raised by parents who treated them poorly. When Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For nine years, the siblings lived in harmony, until Sora died in a car accident. ==Appearances== ===In Bleach=== Orihime first appears in Bleach pilot chapter that Tite Kubo submitted to Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump.

Orihime become spiritually aware after being saved by Ichigo from Acidwire, her late brother turned into a hollow. The hollow attacks Karakura High School, but Orihime uses her own power Shun Shun Rikka to save Tatsuki Arisawa. After Rukia Kuchiki is taken back to Soul Society to be executed, Orihime joins Ichigo with Ury\u016b Ishida, Yasutora Sado and Yoruichi Shihoin, in an effort to save her. Upon arriving in Soul Society, their group is split up, and Orihime wanders the city with Ury\u016b.

After sitting on the sidelines for the second arrancar invasion, Orihime has Tsubaki restored by Hachigen Ush\u014dda, and Orihime goes to Soul Society to train for the next attack. While traveling between the two realms, she meets Ulquiorra Cifer, who threatens to kill Ichigo and her friends, unless she agrees to go to Hueco Mundo. Orihime leaves and heads to Hueco Mundo. There, Orihime is introduced to S\u014dsuke Aizen, a former Soul Reaper and current leader of the Arrancar. Aizen explains that he intends to use Orihime's Shun Shun Rikka to restore the , though she decides to use her powers to destroy the Orb instead. Before she can act on her plans, Ichigo and a group of others arrive in Hueco Mundo to save her. When Ichigo is defeated while facing Ulquiorra, Grimmjow Jeagerjaques, wanting to battle Ichigo at full strength, frees Orihime from her confinements so that she can heal him. Ichigo battles with Grimmjow and ultimately claims victory. They are then attacked by Nnoitora Jiruga, but after Nnoitora's death at the hands of Kenpachi, Orihime is captured once again. Ichigo rushes to her location, and engages Ulquiorra in battle, but is once again defeated. During the aftermath, she discovers that Ichigo is transformed into a new hollow and he mortally hurts Ulquiorra. Ulquiorra starts to turn into ashes as he asks Orihime if she is afraid of him. Orihime, after saying that he is not frightening, tries to reach his hand but Ulquiorra finally disappears. As Ichigo returns to the world of the living, Orihime remains behind to heal an injured Ury\u016b. After Aizen is defeated, Orihime returns to living a normal life until Ury\u016b is attacked and badly injured by a human with supernatural powers. She is later confronted by Tsukishima, the one who attacked Ury\u016b, and his subordinate Shishigawara, and Tsukishima stabs her with his Fullbring before leaving. Later it is revealed that Tsukishima's power has altered her memories. Later, Orihime and her friends went to Hueco Mundo to fight off the Wandenreich, a group of Quincys seeking to destroy Soul Society led by an all powerful leader named Yhwach.

Ten years after Ichigo's victory, she marries Ichigo and has a son with him named Kazui. ===In other media=== Her character has gained additional popularity even among non-fans thanks to a short looped animation of Orihime twirling a leek (specifically, a negi, or Welsh onion) played to \"Ievan Polkka\". Known as the Loituma Girl, the five frames used in the flash cartoon were taken from the second episode in the anime.

Various publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Orihime's character, adding praise to her traits and development. Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine liked Orihime's development in the first volume of the manga as her encounter with the hollow from her brother added \"more dimension\" to her character rather than her portray of a \"big-breasted bimbo\" in which she was initially introduced.

Stephanie Sheh was praised as one of the best voice actors from Viz Media's dub by Carl Kimlinger from ANN. Carlos Alexandre from popcultureshock.com also praised Sheh's work, noting that she makes a good interpretation from Orihime's character. In an Anime News Network poll, Orihime was voted as the fourth worst cook in anime. ==See also== * List of Bleach characters ==References== Category:Anime and manga characters who use magic Category:Bleach characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001 Category:Female characters in anime and manga Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Orphan characters in anime and manga Category:Teenage characters in anime and manga Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities ",
