    "text": "The Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900, with an objective lens of in diameter, was the largest refracting telescope ever constructed. It was built as the centerpiece of the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900. Its construction was instigated in 1892 by Fran\u00e7ois Deloncle (1856\u20131922), a member of the French Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s. Since it was built for exhibit purposes within a large metropolis, and its design made it difficult to aim at astronomical objects, it was not suited for scientific use. When the year-long exposition was over, its builders were unable to sell it. It was ultimately broken up for scrap; the lenses are still stored away at the Paris Observatory. ==Design== The telescope: overall side view (top); the siderostat (left) and lens tube (right); ocular lens end (inset) The telescope had two interchangeable objective lenses (for visual and photographic use respectively) in diameter, with a focal length of . Due to its extremely large size, the telescope was mounted in a fixed horizontal position. Light from astronomical objects was redirected into the optical tube assembly via a Foucault siderostat, a movable plane mirror in diameter, mounted in a large cast-iron frame at the objective lens end of the telescope. The horizontal steel tube was long. The telescope\u2019s eyepiece/plate end could be shifted five feet on rails for focusing. With the lowest power of 500\u00d7, the field of view was 3 arc minutes. ==Construction of the telescope== The eye-piece holder The mirror for the siderostat was ground mechanically by the Gautier Company (headed by Paul Gautier, 1842\u20131909) and took nine months to finish. The blank for the mirror was cast by Georges Despret, director of the Jeumont glassworks in northern France. The lens blanks were cast by \u00c9douard Mantois (1848\u20131900) and ground by Gautier.Launay, pp. 463-466. By the time the Paris Exhibition opened only the object lens for photographic observation was ready. The visual object lens, unfinished, was put on display nearby. ==Erection of the telescope== The instrument in place The telescope was erected in the Palais de l\u2019Optique on the Champ de Mars, near the Eiffel Tower. The tube, oriented north-south, was made up of 24 cylinders in diameter and rested on 7 concrete and steel pillars; its axis was above the floor. The room at the end which housed siderostat with the mirror had a movable dome to allow direct access to the sky.Launay, pp. 467-468. ==Scientific observations== A few scientific observations were made using the giant telescope, even though it was not designed for scientific use. Th\u00e9ophile Moreux (1867\u20131954) observed sunspots through the telescope and made drawings of them. And Eug\u00e8ne Michel Antoniadi (1870\u20131944) made several drawings of nebulae. As well several large photographs of the surface of the Moon, made by Charles Le Morvan (1865\u20131933), were published in the Strand Magazine, November 1900.Launay, pp. 471-473. ==Aftermath== An 1892 cartoon ridiculing Fran\u00e7ois Deloncle who proposed the project The company which had organized in 1886 to build the telescope declared bankruptcy after the Expo, and the telescope was put up for auction in 1909. No buyer was found and eventually the components were scrapped. The diameter mirror is on display at the Observatoire de Paris, and two of the lenses have recently been discovered in packing crates in the basement.Launay, p. 468-471. Poor optics were not why the telescope did not work well. The telescope was located at a fair with much light pollution and near a very large city with much air pollution, and near sea level. The tube was not ventilated and the air inside was likely humid. Throughout its existence the telescope was the butt of many derisive jokes and unflattering cartoons. In part this was due to the belief of the academic community that the telescope would be completely useless, which it certainly was as far as science is concerned. As the centrepiece of an exhibition showcasing the best of the recent advances in industry and technology, it nonetheless served a purpose.Launay, pp. 461\u2013462. ==Bibliography== * Paul Gautier, \u201cNote sur le sid\u00e9rostat \u00e0 lunette de 60 m de foyer et de 1,25 m d\u2019ouverture,\u201d in Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour 1899 (Paris, 1898), pp. C1\u2013C26. * Fran\u00e7oise Launay, \u201cThe Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900\u201d, Journal for the History of Astronomy, 38 (2007), 459\u2013475. == See also == * List of largest optical refracting telescopes * List of largest optical telescopes historically ==References== Category:Optical telescopes Telescope Category:1900 in France Category:1900s in Paris Category:1900 in science Category:Great refractors ",
