    "text": "Delta Sigma Lambda (\u0394\u03a3\u039b) was a social fraternity founded on September 9, 1921 formed entirely of members of the Order of DeMolay. It continued for about fifteen years, numbering 13 chapters in its rolls, with several closing in the early years of the Great Depression. Delta Sigma Lambda's remaining chapters either disbanded or were absorbed by other fraternities by 1937. ==History== The origins can be traced to the spontaneous rise of a number of local collegiate organizations based on the principles of the Order of DeMolay during 1921-1924. On December 23, 1924 six of these fraternities met in Lawrence, Kansas to consider the formation of a National fraternity based on these principles. Those represented were: *Delta Sigma Lambda: University of California, University of Arizona *Star and Crescent: Purdue University *Scimitar Fraternity: University of Kansas *Delta Kappa Fraternity and Illinois DeMolay Club: University of Illinois *Delta Lambda:University of Nebraska Others were invited to attend, but were unable. By December 25, the consolidation was finalized, taking the name and founding date from Delta Sigma Lambda, the oldest group. In 1927 it became a junior member of the National Interfraternity Conference. In September 1933, the group merged with Theta Alpha (founded in 1909 with chapters at Syracuse and Cornell). Later that year the Grand Council of the Order of Demolay recognized Delta Sigma Lambda as the national college Fraternity. In the following years through 1937, many of the chapters died, with Theta Chi in 1937 agreeing to absorb the chapters at Purdue University and University of Montana and their alumni and other chapters either withdrawing to join other national fraternities or going local. ==Symbols== Badge: Jeweled Shield containing the letters \u0394\u03a3\u039b at the top, a star and crescent in the center and below, the Greek letters \u0398\u0391. ==Chapter List== *Alpha - University of California - 1921 *Beta - University of Arizona - 1922 *Gamma - University of Nevada - 1922 *Beta (2) - University of Kansas - 1924 - Originally founded as the Scimitars *Epsilon - University of Nebraska - 1924 - Originally founded as Delta Lambda - Withdrew to join Phi Gamma Delta *Zeta - Purdue University - 1924 - Originally founded as Star and Crescent *Eta - University of Illinois - 1925 - Originally founded as Delta Kappa *Theta - University of Montana - 1927 - Originally founded in 1924 as the Templars.
