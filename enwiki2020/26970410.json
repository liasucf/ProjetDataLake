However on 2 April 2012 the band announced that they had decided to leave Mercury Records, with a statement made by lead singer, Ant West; \"We have been restricted over the past two years as to how much music we have been able to share with you. This has been one of the most frustrating parts about being signed to a major record label, no longer being in control of releases. We recorded our album one year ago and it is yet to surface so we decided to take the matter into our own hands. We wrote fifty-six songs for our album and you guys have only had access to two of them: we\u2019ve wanted to give you more but it\u2019s been an impossibility. Today we decided to leave Mercury Records, and the team there were kind and understanding enough to let us take our album with us.\" On the day of the announcement the band also postponed their upcoming April tour to July. They released the track, 'Swim Teams', as an apology for those who had bought tickets to the tour, and thank them for being patient for the past year. On 8 April Futures announced the launch of their independent self-owned label, Indigo, through whom they released their new album in June 2012.
