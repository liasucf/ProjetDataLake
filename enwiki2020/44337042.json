    "text": "' ('The mouth of the righteous'), WAB 30, is a sacred motet composed by Anton Bruckner in 1879. is a Gregorian chant used as gradual of the ,Commune Doctorum and as introit ICommune Confessoris non Pontificis (I) and gradual IICommune Confessoris non Pontificis (II) of the . == History == Bruckner composed this gradual on 18 July 1879. Bruckner dedicated it to Ignaz Traumihler, choirmaster of St. Florian Abbey.van Zwol, pp. 706-707 When Traumihler saw the manuscript, he asked: \"\" (Is this the whole text?) Therefore, Bruckner added on 28 July 1879 a verse Inveni David in Gregorian mode followed by a repeat of the Alleluja.van Zwol, pp. 237-238 The first performance occurred not as foreseen on Traumihler's name-day (31 July 1879), but four weeks later, on 28 August 1879 on the feast of Saint Augustinus under Traumihler's baton, with Bruckner at the organ. The work was first edited by Theodor R\u00e4ttig, Vienna in 1886, together with three other graduals: Locus iste, Christus factus est and Virga Jesse. In this first edition, something went wrong: the motet and the first Alleluja were issued, but not the extra verse (Inveni David) and the repeat of the Alleluja. The extra verse and the repeat of the Alleluja were \u2014 wrongly \u2014 classified by Grasberger as a separate work (Inveni David, WAB 20). The full original setting, the manuscripts of which are archived at the \u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek,U. Harten, pp. 221 & 326 is put in Band XXI/28 of the .Gesamtausgabe - Kleine Kirchenmusikwerke == Text and music == The text of the motet is two verses of Psalm 37, which is Psalm 36 in the Vulgata (). The text of the added verse is taken from Psalm 89 (). :{| | |style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just. The law of his God is in his heart: and his feet do not falter. Alleluia.Os justi meditabitur on ChoralWiki I have found David, my servant; I have anointed him with my holy oil. Alleluia.Inveni David on ChoralWiki |} The original work of 18 July 1879, a 69-bar gradual, is scored in Lydian mode for choir a cappella. On two occasions (bars 9\u201313 and 51\u201356) the choir is divided into eight voices. The second part on \"Et lingua ejus\" (bars 16\u201342) is a fugato without any alteration.M. Auer, pp. 72\u201373 The last sentence, on \"et non supplantabuntur\" (bars 65-69), is sung pianissimo by the soprano, on a sustained tonic chord by the five other voices (). It is followed by a two-bar unison Alleluja in Gregorian mode. On 28 July 1879, Bruckner added an extra verse Inveni David scored for unison male voices with organ accompaniment, and a repeat of the 2-bar Alleluja. According to Elisabeth Maier the melody of the Alleluja is a quote of the Alleluja of the introit In medio ecclesiae of the Missa de Doctoribus.Elisabeth Maier, Der Choral in den Kirchenwerken Bruckners, Bruckner-Symposion, 1985, cited in: U. Harten, p. 327 The extra verse is apparently Bruckner's own composition. Traumihler was a fervent supporter of the Cecilian Movement; the reason why Bruckner composed this motet in Lydian mode, without any alteration in the key and in the whole score, and with large use of unaltered chords. == Selected discography == The first recording of Os justi occurred in 1931: * Ludwig Berberich, M\u00fcnchner Domchor \u2013 78 rpm: Christschall 141 The large majority of the recordings follows the first edition, sometimes without Alleluja.
