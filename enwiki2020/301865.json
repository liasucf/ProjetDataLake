In 1795, she married Dmitry Lvovich Naryshkin, a hofmeister. In 1799, with her spouse's approval, she entered into a relationship with Alexander, who became tsar in 1801. She was well liked by Alexander's family, except by his consort, the empress Elizabeth Alexeievna. She is described as fascinating and charming, with the ability to attract people, and called \"The Aspasia of the North\". Phillip Vigel wrote that she had beauty \"so perfect that it seemed impossible\". In 1803, she made an attempt to have Alexander divorce his spouse and marry her, but she failed. She accompanied the tsar to the Vienna Congress in 1815, which gave him bad publicity. She had at least four illegitimate daughters by Alexander. Three of them (two named Yelizaveta and one named Zinaida) died in infancy, and the other, Sofia, lived to aged 16. She also had a son, Emanuel, who wasn't admitted by her husband and was possibly also the tsar's child. Her children were: *Marina Naryshkina (1798 \u2013 11 August 1871) *Yelizaveta Naryshkina (born and died 1803) *Yelizaveta Naryshkina (born and died 1804) *Zinaida Naryshkina (1806 \u2013 18 May 1810) *Sofia Naryshkina (1808 \u2013 18 June 1824) *Emanuel Naryshkin (30 July 1813 \u2013 31 December 1901) Alexander was persuaded to leave her in 1818 and went back to his wife, Elizabeth. He continued to talk of her as his family. ==References== * Mistresses of Russian Royalty, Including: Anna Pavlova, Natalia Brasova, Maria Naryshkina, Catherine Dolgorukov, Pauline de Rothschild, Princess Olga *Troyat, Henri Alexander of Russia: Napoleon's Conqueror Dutton Adult; First edition. edition (January 31, 1983) Category:Mistresses of Russian royalty Category:Russian nobility Category:1779 births Category:1854 deaths Category:18th-century Russian people Category:19th-century Russian people Maria ",
