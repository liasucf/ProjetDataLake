He also holds the South American indoors record, with 5.52 metres, and is the only Argentine athlete to conquer a gold medal in any World Championship at any category. Germ\u00e1n was first coached by his father within a family of pole vaulters; his brother Guillermo Jr. (in 2001) and sister Valeria (in 2005) also participated in World Junior Championships. During the 2006 South American Games, he won the gold medal (5.65 m) and his brother Guillermo silver (5.20 m). He currently trains in Italy with pole vaulting star Yelena Isinbayeva, co-coached by Vitaly Petrov. In 2010 Germ\u00e1n won the Platinum Konex Award from Argentina as the best Atlete from the last decade in his country. In 2015, he finally broke his own national record (after 9 years), jumping 5.75 at the Pan-American Games. ==Personal best== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- !Event !!
