    "text": "Bouza is a town in southwestern Niger. A town of eight thousand, it is the administrative center of Bouza Department, part of Tahoua Region. ==Culture and situation== Bouza Department is in a largely Hausa-speaking area, which has become in the last century an area of marginal agriculture. There are also populations of Fula and Tuareg peoples who traditionally engage in nomadic and semi-nomadic animal husbandry: the Fula Woadabe with cattle and the Tuareg largely with camel. The major highway of the region, completed in the 1970s, bypassed Bouza Department to the west, heading south from Regional capitol Tahoua to the large southern city of Birni-N'Konni near the Nigerian border. The major (unpaved) road in the area -- RN16 runs through Bouza town from Madaoua to the south to Keita in the north, before reaching Tahoua in the northwest of the Region.Projet d\u2019am\u00e9nagement des routes Tibiri-Dakoro et Madaoua-Bouza-Tahoua.
