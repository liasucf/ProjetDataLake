    "text": "The Building at 1401-1407 Elmwood Avenue is a historic rowhouse building at 1401-1407 Elmwood Avenue in Evanston, Illinois. Built in 1890, the three-story building includes four rowhouse units. It was one of several rowhouses built in the late nineteenth century in Evanston; these rowhouses were a precursor to Evanston's many suburban apartments, which also offered house-like living in a multi-unit setting. Architect Stephen A. Jennings, a prominent Evanston architect who designed several of Evanston's large single-family homes, designed the building. The building's design includes a large central gable, enclosed porches supported by arches on the corner units, porches with shed roofs on the central units, and a bracketed wooden cornice. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 1984. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1890 ",
