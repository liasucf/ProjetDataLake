    "text": "The Argentine presidential election of 1898 was held on 10 April to choose the president of Argentina. Julio Argentino Roca was elected president for a second period. ==Background== Having obtained the aging Luis S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a's resignation in favor of Vice President Jos\u00e9 Evaristo Uriburu (who was good stead with both Roca and Mitre), Roca once again carried the PAN standard in 1898. The UCR, which had lost its founder, Leandro Alem, to suicide in 1896, was divided between those who backed Senator Bernardo de Irigoyen's drive to form coalitions with more conservative parties, and those who supported the party's new leader, Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen (who boycotted this and future \"election songs\" - establishing what later became known as the UCR's \"break before bending\" policy).Levene, Ricardo. A History of Argentina. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1937. Public debate was heated on the eve of the January 30 elections to a constitutional assembly entrusted to increase the number of congressmen and cabinet members, as well before the April 10, 1898, general election. The electoral college yielded no surprises, though, and Roca was returned to the presidency.Todo Argentina: 1898 ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=19% ! colspan=2| Argentine Republic |- | Population | align=right| 4,462,000 |- | Voters | align=right| 89,200 |- | Turnout | align=right| 2% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Julio Argentino Roca | National Autonomist Party | 218 |- | Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre | National Civic Union | 38 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 256 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 44 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 300 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Vice Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Norberto Quirno Costa | National Autonomist Party | 217 |- | Juan Eusebio Torrent | National Civic Union | 23 |- | Valent\u00edn Virasoro | Liberal Party of Corrientes | 7 |- | Julio Argentino Roca | National Autonomist Party | 6 |- | Lino D.
