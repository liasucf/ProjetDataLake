Established as a daughter of the Church of St Paulinus, Crayford in 1900, St Augustine's became its own parish in 1925. The church is dedicated to the patron saint Augustine of Canterbury. A prominent war memorial has stood at the front of the church since at least 1930. St Augustine's was subject to air raids during both world wars. The church received families from the east of London that had been 'bombed out' during the Second World War. The local community was supported during the war by a British Restaurant operating from St. Augustine's Church Hall, which supplied up to 250 lunches six days a week to residents, the school, and nearby factories. Substantial rebuilding work was required following a direct hit during an air raid in 1944, and following a fire in 1991 which destroyed the roof and much of the internal fabric.Thomas, E.O.Slade Green and the Crayford Marshes, Bexley Education and Leisure Services Directorate, 2001, == References == == External links == * St Augustine's, Slade Green, London Borough of Bexley * Slade Green \u2013 St Augustine of Canterbury Category:Church of England church buildings in the London Borough of Bexley Category:Diocese of Rochester Category:Churches completed in 1900 Category:20th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Churches bombed by the Luftwaffe in London ",
