    "text": "\"Wedding Bells\" is a song written by Claude Boone and recorded by Hank Williams on MGM Records. It peaked at No. 2 on the Best Selling Retail Folk chart in 1949. == Background == \"Wedding Bells\" had been first recorded by Knoxville radio veteran Bill Carlisle on King Records in 1947. According to country music historian Colin Escott, Claude Boone, who played guitar for Knoxville bluegrass star Carl Story, bought the song for twenty-five dollars from James Arthur Pritchett, a local musician and drunk who performed under the name \"Arthur Q. Smith.\" The song's narrator describes his despair over the love of his life marrying another man. According to Boone, Hank called it \"the prettiest song he'd ever heard.\" Williams recorded it at Castle Studio in Nashville on March 20, 1949 with Fred Rose producing and was supported by Dale Potter (fiddle), Don Davis (steel guitar), Zeb Turner (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and Velma Williams (bass). \"Wedding Bells\" was significant because it was the first single following Hank's biggest hit yet, \"Lovesick Blues.\" The recording session for \"Wedding Bells\" took place after Williams' first ever flight. Hank telegrammed producer Fred Rose before takeoff: \"Flight 58 will arrive at 5:45. I hope.\" == Cover versions == *Hank Snow covered the song in 1957. *It was recorded by Marty Robbins in 1958. *George Jones recorded it for his 1962 LP My Favorites of Hank Williams. *Jerry Lee Lewis included the song on his 1967 LP Soul My Way, although it had been recorded several years earlier. *Dean Martin recorded the song for his 1965 album Dean Martin Hits Again. *Charlie Rich covered the song on his 1967 album Charlie Rich Sings Country and Western. *It was featured as part of a Hank Williams medley on Conway Twitty's 1971 album How Much More Can She Stand. *Glen Campbell recorded it for his Williams tribute album in 1973. *Lissie recorded the song for her 2009 EP Why You Runnin'. *It was recorded by Bill Anderson in 1968. * Australian Reg Lindsay included his version on the album Reg Lindsay Classics, c 1981 * Australian Dusty Rankin covered the song on his album, A Portrait of Dusty, 1974. == References == Category:1949 songs Category:Hank Williams songs Category:MGM Records singles Category:Songs about marriage ",
