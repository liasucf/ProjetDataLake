The film was released worldwide on 18 November 2016. ==Plot== The film tells the story of Krishnan Nair Aka Kichu, who got a chance as a child artist and makes up his ambition to be a super star in the industry, though in his adulthood he becomes a typecast with small and similar roles he performed in his childhood. Ann Mariya (Prayaga Martin) is a newcomer to Kattappana and becomes friends with Kichu quickly, believing him to be connected with the film industry on seeing a photograph of him standing next to Priyadarshan at a local studio. Kichu mistook her boundless closeness to be love and when he sees her with her college senior Amit and confronts her, he feels shattered. The same day he has a film shoot where the director James Antony (Kalabhavan Shajon) takes a chance with him believing him to be apt for portraying the central character of his new venture. But the producer, being a newbie is not ready to risk it all and so Kichu had to forfeit the part. Returning home he faces yet another problem where two girls whom he sent to a nearby film location were mistreated, one being his neighbor's daughter, Kani. The neighbor presumes that Kichu sent them with intentions for his personal gain. His father beats and reproaches him to get lost. Kichu, out of despair decides to commit suicide. A car drives towards him, drifting and tumbling over near the edge of the cliff, the suicide point. The person appears to be an owner of a startup from their town. Kichu rescues him and reckons suicide is not an answer to problems. Another person who comes to the suicide point reads Kichu's suicide note describing his story and has a change of heart and meets Kichu. Now Kichu has acknowledged Kani's love for him, he remains friends with Ann and has overcome his inferiority complexes. Towards the credits, Kichu is called again to don the role of a petty thief in a movie. At the location however, it turns out that the role is being done by another person and Kichu is actually the hero of the film. ==Cast== *Vishnu Unnikrishnan as Krishnan Nair (Kichu) *Dharmajan Bolgatty as Dasappan (Dasan) *Prayaga Martin as Ann Maria *Lijomol Jose as Kanimol *Siddique as Surendran (Sura), Kichu's father *Salim Kumar as 'Naxalite' Chandran, Kani's father *Dini Daniel as Seema, Kichu's mother *Siju Wilsson as Geo *Swasika as Neethu *Pradeep Kottayam as Vijayan, Dasappan's father *Rahul Madhav as Giridhar *Kalabhavan Shajon as Director James Antony *Seema G.
