    "text": "Toonsylvania is an animated television series, which ran for two seasons in 1998 on the Fox Kids Network block (usually placed in a block called \"The No Yell Motel\" that contained other scary kids shows such as Goosebumps and Eerie, Indiana) in its first season, then was moved to Monday afternoons from September 14, 1998 until January 18, 1999, when it was cancelled. It was executive produced in part by Steven Spielberg, as DreamWorks' first animated series. The show had recurring cartoon series that appeared in each episode. (Unlike Animaniacs, Toonsylvania did not have a wide range of characters and almost every episode had the same content.) The main segments were \"Frankenstein\", \"Night of the Living Fred\", \"Attack of the Killer B Movies\" and \"Melissa Screetch\". ==Plot summary== A typical episode of Toonsylvania starts with a cartoon series called \"Frankenstein\" (a parody of Mary Shelley's novel of the same name), about the adventures of Dr. Vic Frankenstein (voiced by David Warner), his assistant Igor (voiced by Wayne Knight) who always sets out to prove that he is a genius like his master, and their dim-witted Frankenstein Monster known as Phil (voiced by Brad Garrett). Before the second cartoon, there is an animated vignette where Igor is on the couch with Phil and tries to fix the TV remote, but in every episode there is a new problem with it (a running gag akin to the couch gags seen on The Simpsons). After that, there is a cartoon series called \"Night of the Living Fred\", about a family of zombies. This segment was created by cartoonist Mike Peters. Sometimes, a parody of a B-list horror movie would air instead of a \"Night of the Living Fred\" cartoon. After that, there is a short segment called \"Igor's Science Minute\", where Igor gives a science lesson (be it a musical piece or a spoken piece) that always ends in disaster. The final segment is \"Melissa Screetch's Morbid Morals\", where Phil the Frankenstein Monster does something bad and Igor punishes him by reading a horror tale involving a bratty girl named Melissa Screetch (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) who does not heed the warnings of adults (usually given by her mother) and suffers the consequences for it one way or another. ===Second season changes=== In season two, Bill Kopp and Jeff DeGrandis left the show and were replaced by Paul Rugg. The series' format changed into more of a sitcom style, with Igor, Dr. Vic Frankenstein and Phil interacting with a variety of new characters, including a snooping next-door neighbor Seth Tuber (voiced by Jonathan Harris), who was based on Norman Bates from Psycho. He interacted with his \"immobile\" mother by putting his hand over his mouth and talking into it. There was also a typical Transylvanian angry mob that was, in fact, a cheerful group of Beatles-esque hipsters. Most of these new characters were voiced by Paul Rugg, who also improvised many of their lines. The only other backup segments to re- materialize in season two were the B-movie parodies (though some episodes of \"Night of the Living Fred\" aired) and Melissa Screetch in a new segment called \"The Melissa Screetch Show\". Whenever Melissa was disappointed with a friend or a family member, she would go home and cover herself under her bed sheets where she pretended to host a show. She then had her transgressor on as a guest star and often did away with them in an ironic manner. ==Series overview== == Episodes == === Season 1 (1998) === === Season 2 (1998\u201399) === ==Music== The music for the series was written by Michael Tavera, Keith Baxter, Christopher Neal Nelson, John Paul Given, Christopher Klatman and Thom Sharp.
