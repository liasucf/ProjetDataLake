    "text": "IllumiNations was a series of nightly fireworks shows at Epcot before IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth was created in 1999 for the Millennium Celebration. ==Le Carnival de Lumiere== The first evening presentation, Le Carnival de Lumiere, premiered on October 23, 1982. It celebrated world festivals with fountains, film, music, and other effects. The show used rear projection screens on barges floating on the World Showcase Lagoon. Between the projection barges were fountain/fireworks barges controlled by Apple computers. The show could be viewed only from points between the Mexican and Canadian pavilions. ==A New World Fantasy== A New World Fantasy was the 2nd version of a fireworks show at Epcot and was set to classical music played on synthesizer. It opened in the summer of 1983 and used floating barges that had rear projection screens on them. The barges were the same as the first show at Epcot, Carnival de Lumiere. The show also added 'Pichel lights' that moved automatically. * Most of the soundtrack can be found on Don Dorsey's album \"Busted\", but the \"Great Parades and Pageants\" segment was removed. * The complete soundtrack can be found on a promotional Don Dorsey album. ===Show program=== ====Fanfare==== 1\\. \"Fanfare\" from La P\u00e9ri :: Paul Dukas ====Act I: Celebrations on Land==== 2\\.

It featured lasers emitted from barges and from around the lagoon. The \"Skater\" segment featured the first use of non-continuous lines in a laser animation and was the first use of laser graphics on a water-droplet screen. * Most of the soundtrack can be found on Don Dorsey's album \"Busted\", but the \"Great Parades and Pageants\" segment was removed. * The complete soundtrack can be found on a promotional Don Dorsey album. ==IllumiNations== This show used most of the arrangements for \"A New World Fantasy\" and \"Laserphonic Fantasy,\" but instead of being arranged solely with synthesizers, the resulting arrangements were rescored for full orchestra, mostly using the original orchestration by the composers. New music was created for the show's theme by Don Dorsey and Bruce Healey. The \"Great Parades and Pageants\" section used in the previous installments was omitted and replaced with a celebration of all the individual countries of World Showcase (except Norway, which had just opened by the show's premiere). This installment of IllumiNations began a radical new use for effects in fireworks shows. To add to the Pichel lights, fountains, laser barges, and laser graphics projected behind the fountains, the directors made the lights representing the different interact with the music and the rest of the show. In another strange turn of events, they decided not to use fireworks until the very end of the second act, and then the third act would show the fireworks off at their best. ===Show program=== ====Opening==== ====Act I==== 1\\.
