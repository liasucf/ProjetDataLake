Retrieved on September 25, 2012. \"A.Media, Inc. New York 667 Fifth Ave., 3rd Fl. New York, NY 10022\" The company also had offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It was founded in 1989 by Jeff Yang, Amy Chu, Sandi Kim and Bill Yao to cover East Asian American issues and culture, and grew out of a campus magazine Yang edited while an undergraduate at Harvard University. The magazine operated for twelve years. On its tenth year, the magazine made a profit for the first time. During that year it reached its circulation high of 200,000. When the economy declined in 2001, the magazine declined. Until it ceased on February 20, 2002, it was the largest publication for Anglophonic East Asian Americans in the United States, with bimonthly readership exceeding 200,000 in North America. Though well-known and influential in the East Asian American community, it was almost never profitable in its thirteen-year existence. In November 1999, it obtained 4.5 million dollars in venture capital funding, and the company was renamed aMedia, reflecting a branching out into Web publishing. Unfortunately, this change came right as the dot-com boom was turning to bust. In early 2000, right after announcing their move to a office in San Francisco, the stock market nose-dove. In a desperate attempt to recover, they merged with Click2Asia in November 2000. After a tough shareholder fight, the merged company was shut down in 2002. ==See also== * Yolk magazine ==References== ==External links== *A.
