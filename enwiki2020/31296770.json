She had no playing participation before entering the league, but she had been involved actively in the game since she was in school. I actually had no pitching participation and had never played organized baseball... I had practiced baseball with our school team all through high school, but of course, they would not let me play in the games. I was also the batgirl for our town team of men and practiced with them and went to all the games. I loved the game and had a strong arm, she recalled in her autobiography. ==AAGPBL career== Descombes joined the league in 1953 with the Grand Rapids Chicks. My coach and friend was 'Beansie' Risinger (pitcher Earlene Risinger), she said. At first, Grand Rapids manager Woody English let her pitch batting practice, but most of the time she had her running in the outfield, practicing until about midseason before getting her first chance to pitch. Expanding her comments about Risinger, Descombes explained that she taught her to relax and believe in herself. In her rookie season, Descombes posted a 0\u20131 record with a 7.45 earned run average in seven relief appearances and was a member of the Champion Team, even though she did not pitch during the postseason.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book \u2013 W.
