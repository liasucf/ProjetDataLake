    "text": "The orange-breasted falcon (Falco deiroleucus) is a bird of the falcon family. It is probably closely related to and looks like a larger version of the bat falcon. These two, in turn, are probably closest to the aplomado falcon and constitute a rather old American lineage of Falco.Probably diverging from their relatives some 8-5 million years ago, during the Late Miocene. See Birregard (1994), Helbig et al. (1994), Wink et al. (1998), Griffiths (1999), Groombridge et al. (2002), Griffiths et al. (2004) It is found from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. It's a medium-sized falcon at long and a weight of .Identification \u2013 Orange-breasted Falcon (Falco deiroleucus) \u2013 Neotropical Birds. Neotropical.birds.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2013-03-07. It is a bird predator, with strong talons that enable it to catch prey in flight, and is considered by some \u2013 such as the German-Brazilian ornithologist Helmut Sick \u2013 as filling the ecological niche of the peregrine falcon as a breeding species in tropical America. The orange-breasted falcon, however, seems to favor more heavily wooded habitats than the peregrine, therefore the species does not seem to be in ecological competition with peregrine falcons wintering or breeding in South America. Living in the predominately tropical climates of Guatemala and Belize, these birds use the humidity of their niche to their advantage. The orange-breasted falcon purposely crashed into leaves of trees with water gathered on them as a form of bathing.Eisermann, Knut. \u201cAn Observation of Foliage-Bathing by an Orange-Breasted Falcon (Falco Deiroleucus) in Tikal, Guatemala.\u201d The Wilson Bulletin, vol. 117, no. 4, 2005, pp. 415\u2013418., doi:10.1676/04-111.1. The orange-breasted falcon has a similar plumage to the much smaller bat falcon and is generally considered most closely related to that species now.
