    "text": "Lani Jean Minella (born July 28, 1950) is an American voice actress, voice director, and producer mostly working in the games industry. She is also the founder and owner of the voice-acting agency, AudioGodz. ==Career== After college, Minella started on Morning Drive radio for an alternative station in the late 1980's. After hearing her celebrity impersonations, GTE Interactive Media contacted her and asked her to imitate voices from the movie FernGully: The Last Rainforest, which was being pitched for a LaserDisc presentation to Magnavox and Philips. She was then referred by the company to their CD-Roms division, where she worked on more voices and assisted script writing on games for children. Minella asked the company if there were others doing similar work, and they suggested that she should go to trade shows, which led her to attend showcases like Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Game Developers Conference in San Jose, and Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, where she gave out business cards but failed to get any offers. This led her to start her AudioGodz, a production company specializing in all aspects of voiceovers from talent to casting, directing, writing and production, in 1992. In 1996, Minella worked on a major first-person shooter video game, Duke Nukem 3D, as voice director and actress, voicing most of the female characters in the series. Lani helped cast the voice actor of Duke Nukem, Jon St. John. She met Jon when she was cast as the voice for a commercial he was producing in San Diego. After being impressed by her voices, Jon imitated the voices back at Lani and she asked if he had ever done voice acting for video games. She shortly got him a telephone interview with the game's creator, George Broussard, and eventually got him the part of Duke. Lani's first major voice role in a video game was for Her Interactive's adventure-mystery series Nancy Drew, starring as the titular character Nancy Drew, debuting with 1998's Secrets Can Kill. Lani reprised her role as Nancy Drew in 31 other video games, with her last being Sea of Darkness in 2015. Her Interactive's CEO then decided to find a voice actress local to the Seattle area (Lani lives in San Diego). Since starting her career and becoming well known for her unique 4-octave vocal range, Lani has provided voices for many voices for other characters in a variety of video games, including the Sea Emperor Leviathan in Subnautica, Rouge the Bat in Sonic Adventure 2, Ivy Valentine from the Soulcalibur series, Lucas in the Super Smash Bros. series, various characters in The Land Before Time games, Luke in the Professor Layton series, Commandant Steele in Borderlands, Tiamat and Silitha in Darksiders, Sindel and Sheeva in the 2011 Mortal Kombat, and Mia in Fire Emblem Heroes. ==Personal life== Minella is half Italian. In her spare time, she does vocal coaching, gardening, and taking care of her rescue pets when she's home. ==Filmography== ===Animation=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width=95%; font-size: 95%;\" |+ List of voice performances in animation ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:40px;\"| Year ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:250px;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:290px;\"| Role ! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Crew role, notes ! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Source |- | || Burn-Up Excess || Maya Jingu, others || English dub || Resume |- | || .hack//SIGN || Girl || English dub || |- | || Geneshaft || Dolce Saito, Chacha, others|| English dub || |- | || Justice League Unlimited || Mayor of Central City || Episode: \"Flash and Substance\" || |- | || All Grown Up! || Kid, Old Woman || Episode: \"TF + KP || |- | || The Cleveland Show || Hispanic Woman || Episode: \"Flush of Genius\" || |- | || Motown Magic || Lorenzo || || |} ===Feature films=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width=95%; font-size: 95%;\" |+ List of voice performances in feature films ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:40px;\"| Year ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:40px;\" | Title ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:290px;\"| Role ! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Crew role, notes ! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Source |- | || Ferngully: The Last Rainforest || Background voices || Debut voice role, LaserDisc release || |- | || The Queen's Corgi || Ginger || US Version || |- | || It Chapter Two || || Loop Group || Tweet |} ===Video games=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width=95%; font-size: 95%;\" |+ List of voice performances in video games ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:60px;\"| Year ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:290px;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#b0c4de; width:290px;\"| Role ! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Crew role, notes, region ! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Source ! style=\"background:b0c4de;\"| Region |- | 1995 || Astal || All voices|| || |- | || Bubsy 3D || Bubsy Bobcat, others || Voice Talent || |- | || Candy Land Adventure|| Captain Cookie, Princess Lolly, Queen Frostine, Gramma Nut, Tree 2, Red Ant 1, Queen Bee, Miner 1 || || |- | || Diablo|| Adria the Witch, Wirt the Peg-Legged Boy || || |- | -2002 || The Land Before Time games || Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Petrie, Chomper, Spike, Mo || Voice characterization || |- | || Starcraft || Dropship Pilot || || |- | || Rocky & Bullwinkle's Know-It-All Quiz Game || Sherman || || |- | -2015 || Nancy Drew games || Nancy Drew, various characters || || |- | || Snowboard Kids 2 || Slash Kamei, Damien, Wendy Lane || || |- | || Evil Zone || Alty Lazel, Midori Himeno, Ihadurca || || |- | ||Final Fight Revenge || Poison || || |- | || Duke Nukem: Zero Hour || Female Commander || Voice actor || |- | || Blue Stinger || Janine King || Voice actor and director || |- | || Tail Concerto || Waffle Ryebread, Panta || || |- | || 40 Winks || Ruff, Tumble, mother || || |- | || Evil Dead: Hail to the King || Anne Knowby, Grammy, Deadites || || |- | || D2 || Martha || || |- | || Diablo II: Lord of Destruction || Malah, Ancients || || |- | || Half-Life: Decay || Gina Cross, Colette Green || || |- | -2004 || Sonic the Hedgehog games || Omochao, Rouge the Bat, Void || Voice actor and director || || US/EUR/NA |- | || Illbleed || Eriko Christy, Michelle Waters|| Uncredited || |- | || AirBlade || Kat || Voice actor and director || |- | || Frogger: The Great Quest || Various characters || || |- | || Slots from Bally Gaming || Olive Oyl, Betty Boop || || |- | -present || Soulcalibur games || Ivy Valentine || Voice actor || |- | || The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth II || Galadriel, Spider Rider || || |- |-present || Fire Emblem games || Mia (Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn onward), Micaiah (Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn only), Mist (Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn only) || Voice actor || |- | - || Professor Layton games || Luke (US English), Flora, Emmy, various others || || |- | || GrimGrimoire || Amoretta Virgine, Opalneria Rain || || |- | || Super Smash Bros.
