    "text": "Rossmore is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is bound to the east by Kemps Creek, the west by South Creek, the north by Fifteenth Avenue, and the south by Rileys Creek in the southwest and a non natural border from there. The main road through the centre of the suburb is Bringelly Road. ==History== Rossmore was originally known as Cabramatta after the parish of Cabramatta. It was the subject of a novel called The Cabramatta Store by Mary Theresa Vidal, which is believed to be the first novel published by a woman in Australia. In 1856, the railway line was extended from Granville to Liverpool and a station was established at what is now the modern-day Cabramatta. There was a horse stud in the area called Rossmoor Stud which is believed to have been named after Rossmore Lodge, a famous horse stud in Kildare, Ireland. To avoid confusion with the new station of Cabramatta, the old town of Cabramatta became known as Rossmore. Rossmore Post Office opened on 22 March 1897. == Heritage listings == Rossmore has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * 130 Rossmore Avenue West: Church of the Holy Innocents ==Demographics== According to the 2016 census, Rossmore had a population of 2,286 people with a median age of 39, which was slightly higher than the national median age of 38.
