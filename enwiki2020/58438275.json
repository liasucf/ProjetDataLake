The municipality was centered around the island of Tj\u00f8tta plus the mainland to the east and south as well as over 3000 islands, islets, and skerries to the west. The administrative centre of Tj\u00f8tta was the village of Tj\u00f8tta, located on the island of Tj\u00f8tta, where the Tj\u00f8tta Church is located. ==History== The municipality of Tj\u00f8tta was established in 1862 when it was separated from Alstahaug Municipality. Initially, Tj\u00f8tta had a population of 2,781. On 1 July 1917, the southeastern district of Tj\u00f8tta (population: 1,097) was separated to become the new Vevelstad Municipality, leaving Tj\u00f8tta with 2,287 inhabitants. On 1 July 1920 the Gisk\u00e5en farm with 10 inhabitants was transferred to Vevelstad. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the part of Tj\u00f8tta located on the eastern part of the island of Alsten (population: 180) was incorporated into Leirfjord Municipality. On 1 January 1965, the Skogsholmen island area in western Tj\u00f8tta (population: 196) was incorporated into Vega Municipality. The rest of Tj\u00f8tta Municipality (population: 1,477) was merged with most of Alstahaug Municipality (population: 920) and the town of Sandnessj\u00f8en (population: 3,856). ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Tj\u00f8tta, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council of Tj\u00f8tta was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms.
