Jin Dynasty jade ring with coiled-dragon design Qing Dynasty flag with a coiled dragon ==Word== The Chinese compound panlong' combines pan \"coiling; curling; curving; bending; winding; twisting\" and long or \"dragon\". Longpan \"dragon coiling\", the reverse of panlong, is a literary metaphor for \"person of unrecognized talent\" (see the Fayan below). Panlong \"coiled dragon\" can be written or , using pan 's homophonous variant Chinese character pan or \"tray; plate; dish\". Another example of this graphic interchangeability is panrao or \"twine round; surround; fill\". Two Classical Chinese panlong idioms are panlongpi (\"coiling dragon habit\") \"gambling addiction\" (alluding to 5th-century gambler Liu Yi or Liu Panlong ) and panlong-wohu (lit. \"coiling dragon crouching tiger\") \"talented people remaining concealed\". In Fengshui and Four Symbols theory, the Dragon and Tiger are symbolic opposites. Take for instance, longtan-huxue (\"dragon's pond and tiger's cave\") \"dangerous places\" or Wohu canglong Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. ==Textual usages== Coiled Dragon Chinese classic texts began using panlong in the Han Dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE). The (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi (8, tr. Morgan 1934:95) first records panlong as a decorative style on Chinese bronzes. > Great bells and tripods, beautiful vessels, works of art are manufactured. > The decorations cast on these have been superb. The mountain dragon, or > pheasant, and all animals of variegated plumage, the aquatic grass, > flamboyants and grains of cereals were engraven on them, one symbol > interwoven with another. The sleeping rhinoceros and crouching tiger, the > dragon, wreathed in coils, were wrought. The later term panlongwen \"coiled-dragon pattern/design (on bronzes, pillars, etc.)\" compares with panchiwen (see chilong ) and panqiuwen (see qiulong ). Another Huainanzi context (15, tr. Morgan 1934:199) lists longshepan (lit. \"dragon snake coiling\") \"serpentine passage\" as a good ambush location. > An exiguous pass, a ferry pontoon, a great mountain, a serpentine defile, a > cul-de-sac, a dangerous pitfall, a narrow ravine, full of winding ways like > the intestines of a sheep, a hole like a fisher's net, which admits, but > from which there is no exit, are situations in which one man can hold back a > thousand. The materialist philosopher Yang Xiong (53 BCE \u2013 18 CE) used both panlong and longpan. His Fangyan \"Regional Speech\" dictionary (12, tr. Visser 1913:73) defined panlong \"coiled/curled dragon\", \"Dragons which do not yet ascend to heaven [cf. tianlong \"heavenly dragon\"] are called p'an-lung.\" His Fayan \"Words to Live By\" anthology (4, tr. Carr 1990:112) coined the metaphor longpan (lit. \"dragon coiling\") \"person of unrecognized talent\", \"'a dragon coiled in the mud will be insulted by a newt,' meaning 'a sage will be ridiculed by a fool'.\" The (2nd century CE) Shangshu dazhuan commentary to the Classic of History (1, tr. Carr 1990:113) parallels panlong and jiaoyu (or jiaolong ), \"the 'coiled dragon' was greatly trusted in its lair, the ' dragon; crocodile' leaped in its pool.\" The (12th century CE) Song Dynasty Biji manzhi \"Random Jottings from the Green Rooster Quarter\" by Wang Zhuo (tr. Visser 1913:117) describes using panlong dragons in sympathetic magic for rainfall, \"where a mirror, adorned on the backside with a \"coiled dragon\", p'an lung, , is said to have been worshipped (rather used in a magical way) in order to cause rain.\" ==Proper names== Banry\u016b sinking the Ch\u014dy\u014d.
