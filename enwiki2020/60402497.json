    "text": "Paul Boyle (born 14 January 1997) is an Irish rugby union player for Pro14 and European Rugby Challenge Cup side Connacht. He can play across the back-row. ==Early life== Born in Gorey, Wexford, Boyle first began playing rugby aged 7 with Gorey. ==Connacht== Boyle came through the underage ranks for Leinster and was a member of their sub-academy, whilst also playing club rugby with Lansdowne in the All-Ireland League, but was never offered a place in the full academy with his native province, which led to Boyle joining Connacht's academy ahead of the 2017\u201318 season. Boyle went on to make his senior Connacht debut against provincial rivals Munster in January 2018. Boyle's performances for Connacht during the early months of the 2018\u201319 season saw him rewarded with his first professional contract with the province, which will see him graduate from year two of the academy and join the senior squad until at least June 2021. ==Ireland== Boyle captained Ireland under-20s at the 2017 World Rugby Under 20 Championship, where they finished ninth overall. ==References== ==External links== *Connacht Profile *Pro14 Profile * Category:Living people Category:1997 births Category:Rugby union players from County Wexford Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Lansdowne Football Club players Category:Connacht Rugby players Category:Rugby union number eights Category:Rugby union flankers ",
