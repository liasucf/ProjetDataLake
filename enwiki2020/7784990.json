    "text": "Henok Goitom (; born 22 September 1984) is an Eritrean professional footballer who plays as a centre forward for AIK. He has spent most of his career with AIK (two spells) and in Spain, playing 215 matches and scoring 42 goals in the latter country both major levels combined \u2013 109 games and 14 goals in La Liga. He also competed professionally in Italy and the United States. Born in Sweden to Eritrean parents, Goitom represented Eritrea at the senior international level after having appeared for the Sweden U19 and U21 teams. ==Early life== Goitom was born in Solna, Stockholm, and raised in the nearby Husby district. His parents were born in Eritrea. ==Club career== ===Udinese=== Goitom moved to Italy in 2004 to join Udinese Calcio, rarely being an option during his short stay. However, in his sole Serie A appearance, on 19 February 2005, he only needed seven minutes as a late substitute to score the 90th minute 1\u20131 equaliser against Inter Milan. ====Loan to Ciudad de Murcia==== Subsequently, Goitom served a two-year loan in the Spanish second division with Ciudad de Murcia. He netted 15 league goals during his second season. === Real Murcia === In 2007, Goitom was released by Udinese and signed a four-year deal with neighbouring Real Murcia, for a reported \u20ac3 million. The president of UD Almer\u00eda, Alfonso Garc\u00eda, however, announced the club would take matters to court: as he appeared before the media during the presentation of Aitor L\u00f3pez Rekarte, showed journalists papers which proved an agreement had already been reached between Almer\u00eda and Udinese. With Murcia, Goitom only scored twice during the entire campaign, which saw the team eventually relegated from La Liga as last. ==== Loan to Valladolid ==== In July 2008, he was loaned for one season to fellow league side Real Valladolid, which had an option to buy at the campaign's closure. Established as first-choice, Goitom netted twice as Valladolid beat Recreativo de Huelva 3\u20132 away on 8 March 2009, but was also sent off during the match (as teammate \u00c1lvaro Rubio). He finished the season as team top scorer, at ten. === Almer\u00eda === In late July 2009, Goitom was released by Murcia and joined fellow league side Almer\u00eda, replacing Sevilla FC-bound \u00c1lvaro Negredo. His 2009\u201310 season output consisted of one goal, in a 1\u20131 home draw against CD Tenerife; also, even though he was the only pure striker in the squad, he was never an undisputed starter, but the Andalusians retained their top division status in the end. On 19 January 2011, Goitom scored one of Almer\u00eda's most important goals, netting a penalty kick in a 3\u20132 win at Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a (4\u20132 on aggregate), with them reaching the semi- finals of the Copa del Rey for the first time ever (he added one more in the competition, against Real Sociedad). However, he again only netted once in the league, in a 2\u20132 home draw against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and the club returned to the second division after four years; in mid-August 2012, he terminated his contract. ===AIK=== On 16 August 2012, Goitom signed with his hometown club AIK Fotboll in the Allsvenskan. In November 2015, it was announced he would be released when his contract ended on 31 December. ===Getafe=== On 22 March 2016, after being unemployed for almost three months, Goitom agreed to a short-term deal at Getafe CF. He made his debut about a week later, coming on as a second half-substitute in a 0\u20132 away loss against Rayo Vallecano. Goitom only totalled 125 minutes of action during his spell, and his team suffered top-flight relegation. ===San Jose Earthquakes=== On 10 August 2016, Goitom joined San Jose Earthquakes on a free transfer. He made his Major League Soccer debut nine days later, coming from the bench in a 1\u20132 loss to Houston Dynamo at the Avaya Stadium. At the end of the season, where he only started in two of his appearances, the club announced that they would not be exercising their option to extended Goitom's contract. ===Return to AIK=== On 3 March 2017, it was announced that Goitom had signed a two-year contract with his former club AIK, thus returning to his birth country and its top flight. In February of the following year, he became team captain. ==International career== === Sweden === Goitom was a regular starter for the Swedish under-21 team during 2006, and played for the nation during qualification for the 2006 and 2007 UEFA European Championships. He was never called up to the Sweden national team, although he was considered for a place in the squad for a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Russia. === Eritrea === In September 2015, at age of 30, Goitom made an official request to FIFA for permission to play for Eritrea. He won his first cap on 10 October, in a 0\u20132 home loss to Botswana for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers; he scored in the return leg, to a final 1\u20135 defeat on aggregate. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\"|Udinese |2003\u201304 |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Serie A |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |0||0 |- |2004\u201305 |1||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |2||1 |- |2005\u201306 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |0||0 |- |2006\u201307 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !1!!1!!1!!0!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!!2!!1 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Ciudad Murcia (loan) |2005\u201306 |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |37||8||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |37||8 |- |2006\u201307 |38||15||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |38||15 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !75!!23!!0!!0!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!!75!!23 |- | valign=\"center\" |Murcia |2007\u201308 |La Liga |31||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014 |33||2 |- | valign=\"center\" |Valladolid (loan) |2008\u201309 |La Liga |29||10||2||1|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |31||11 |- | rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\" |Almer\u00eda |2009\u201310 | rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\" |La Liga |21||1||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |21||1 |- |2010\u201311 |26||1||5||2|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |31||3 |- |2011\u201312 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |31||6||3||1|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |34||7 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !78!!8!!8!!3!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !86!!11 |- | rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\" |AIK |2012 | rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\" |Allsvenskan |9||1||1||0||2||1 |12||2 |- |2013 |27||8||3||1|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |30||9 |- |2014 |28||12||1||1||4||1 |33||14 |- |2015 |29||18||4||3||6||6 |39||27 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !93!!39!!9!!5!!12!!8 !114!!52 |- | valign=\"center\" |Getafe |2015\u201316 |La Liga |2||0||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |2||0 |- | valign=\"center\" |San Jose Earthquakes |2016 |Major League Soccer |8||0||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |8||0 |- | rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\" |AIK |2017 | rowspan=\"4\" |Allsvenskan |24||5||2||0||5 |1 |31||6 |- |2018 |30 |12 |6 |1 |4 |0 |40 |13 |- |2019 |30 |11 |5 |1 |8 |3 |43 |15 |- |2020 |14 |4 |4 |1 |0 |0 |18 |5 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !98 !32 !17 !3 !17 !4 !132 !39 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !415!!115!!39!!11!!29!!12 !483!!138 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Eritrea |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2015||2||1 |- |2019||2||0 |- !Total||4||1 |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Eritrea's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # !!
