    "text": "\"I Will Survive\" is a hit song first performed by American singer Gloria Gaynor, released in October 1978. It was written by Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris. A top-selling song, it is a popular disco anthem, as well as being certified Platinum by the RIAA. The song's lyrics describe the narrator's discovery of personal strength following an initially devastating breakup. It received heavy airplay in 1979, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and on the UK Singles Chart on consecutive weeks. The song is also frequently recalled as a symbol of female empowerment. In 2016, the Library of Congress deemed Gaynor's original recording to be \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry. ==Releases== Originally released as the B-side to a cover version of the Righteous Brothers song \"Substitute\", \"I Will Survive\" became a worldwide hit for Gaynor when disc jockeys played that side of the record instead (kick-started by legendary Studio 54 DJ Richie Kaczor). \"Substitute\" appeared on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart for four weeks in October\u2013November 1978, peaking at No. 107. \"I Will Survive\" then entered the Billboard Hot 100 in December that year and reached No. 1 on the chart in March 1979. The song received the Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording in 1980, the only year the award was given. Gloria Gaynor performed the song \"I Will Survive\", which became one of her signature songs. A promotional video was filmed in 1979 at the New York discoth\u00e8que called Xenon. Sheila Reid- Pender of Harlem is the featured skater in the video from the skating group, The Village Wizards. Although three videos were filmed that day, the \"I Will Survive\" video was the only one to survive. Gaynor was not present during the taping of the rollerskating segment of the video. Gaynor and Pender met for the first time on July 7, 2014 in New York at the 92nd St. YMCA after Gaynor's lecture and promotional signing of her book 'We Will Survive'.S. Pender In this book, Gaynor said, \"I wanted everybody\u2014including myself\u2014to believe that we could survive\". Following the success of fellow 1970s disco stars Sister Sledge with remixed singles in the UK in 1993, \"I Will Survive\" was also remixed and released that summer. This remix reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. In November 2013, Gaynor released a gospel album entitled We Will Survive, which includes a new, updated remix of \"I Will Survive\" by DJ Shpank in both extended and radio edit formats. ==Impact and legacy== VH1 placed \"I Will Survive\" at #1 in their list of 100 Greatest Dance Songs in 2000. Rolling Stone listed the song at number 492 in their List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004. Billboard placed it at number 97 in their ranking of The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs in 2008. In 2012, \"I Will Survive\" was ranked at #2 in Rolling Stone poll of The Best Disco Songs of All Time. The Daily Telegraph ranked \"I Will Survive\" #48 in their The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time list in November 2016. In 2017, the song was ranked number 7 in Paste Magazine's The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics list. Pitchfork Media featured it in their list of 50 Songs That Define the Last 50 Years of LGBTQ+ Pride in 2018. They added, > \"'I Will Survive' probably would've become a gay anthem even without the > specter of AIDS. It has an undeniable flair for the dramatic: After moving > through that filigreed piano intro, you can imagine a lone spotlight shining > on Gloria Gaynor as she drags the man dumb enough to break her heart and > crawl back for more. It was released as disco's wave was beginning to break, > topping the Billboard charts a few months before the infamous Disco > Demolition Night at Comiskey Park. Had the story ended there, it'd represent > the last, best gasp of a culture beaten into temporary irrelevance by > thinly-veiled racism and homophobia.\" ===Accolades=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Publisher !Country !Accolade !Rank |- |2000 |VH1 |United States |\"100 Greatest Dance Songs\" |1 |- |2004 |Rolling Stone |United States |\"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" |492 |- |2005 |Bruce Pollock |United States |\"The 7,500 Most Important Songs of 1944-2000\" |* |- |2008 |Billboard |United States |\"The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs\" |97 |- |2009 |The Guardian |United Kingdom |\"1000 Songs Everyone Must Hear\" |* |- |2012 |Rolling Stone |United States |\"The Best Disco Songs of All Time\" |2 |- |2013 |Max |Australia |\"1000 Greatest Songs of All Time\" |120 |- |2016 |The Daily Telegraph |United Kingdom |\"The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time\" |48 |- |2017 |Paste Magazine |United States |\"The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics\" |7 |- |2018 |Pitchfork Media |United States |\"50 Songs That Define the Last 50 Years of LGBTQ+ Pride\" |* |} (*) indicates the list is unordered. ==Personnel== *Vocals: Gloria Gaynor *Drums: James Gadson *Percussion: Paulinho Da Costa *Bass guitar: Scott Edwards *Keyboards: Freddie Perren *Guitars: Bob \"Boogie\" Bowles, Melvin \"Wah Wah Watson\" Ragin *Strings and horns: arranged and conducted by Dave Blumberg ==Official versions== Recorded by Gloria Gaynor * \"I Will Survive\" (1978 single version) \u2013 3.15 * \"I Will Survive\" (1978 album version) \u2013 4.56 * \"I Will Survive\" (1978 12\" Mix) \u2013 8.02 * \"Yo Vivir\u00e9\" (I Will Survive Spanish 12\" Mix) \u2013 7.55 * \"I Will Survive\" (Tom Moulton Mix) \u2013 10.33 * \"I Will Survive\" (2009 re-recording) \u2013 5.35 * \"I Will Survive\" (2009 re-recording Spanish version) - 5.37 ==Charts and certifications== ===Chart performance=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1978\u201379) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |- |- |Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Canadian RPM Disco Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |Canadian RPM Top 15 12inch | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |Canadian RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |Finnish Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |France (SNEP) You have to use the index at the top of the page and search \"Gloria Gaynor\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |Irish Singles Chart 3rd result when searching \"I will survive\" | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |Italy (FIMI) 38\\.
