    "text": "Qu\u00e9bec debout, sometimes styled Qu\u00e9bec Debout ( Stand Up, Quebec or Rise Up, Quebec), formerly the Groupe parlementaire qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois () was a Quebec-based parliamentary group in the House of Commons of Canada during the 42nd Canadian Parliament which consisted of members that resigned from the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caucus. The group did not have a formal leader, but Rh\u00e9al Fortin acted as the party's spokesperson. The group was dissolved on September 17, 2018 with all remaining Qu\u00e9bec debout MPs rejoining the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caucus. == Formation of the Groupe parlementaire qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois == The Groupe parlementaire qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (GPQ) was formed on February 28, 2018 by seven Members of Parliament (MPs) who resigned from the caucus of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (BQ) due to their opposition to the leadership of Martine Ouellet, as well as political differences with her strategy of emphasizing the party's stance regarding active advocacy for Quebec sovereignty rather than a pragmatic approach that focuses on the practical interests of Quebec. While the seven MPs left the BQ parliamentary caucus, they initially remained members of the BQ party itself and had expressed the desire to remain so. The BQ party executive, in a meeting one week after the group's formation, ruled that the seven defecting MPs would not be expelled from the party for leaving the caucus, and would be allowed to rejoin the caucus in the future. == Qu\u00e9bec debout, proposed new party == On May 1, 2018, the seven MPs announced that they were severing all ties with the BQ and considering founding a new political party. The GPQ members announced on May 9, 2018 that their new party would be registered under the name \"Qu\u00e9bec debout\" and would no longer include Quebec sovereignty in its platform. Following Ouellet's decision to resign after losing a leadership review, Terrebonne MP Michel Boudrias and Mirabel MP Simon Marcil announced that they would rejoin the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caucus. The same day, citing the Bloc's vote to focus exclusively on Quebec sovereignty, Qu\u00e9bec debout spokesman Rh\u00e9al Fortin announced that he and the party's other four MPs would not rejoin the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The five Groupe parlementaire qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs were formally redesignated as Qu\u00e9bec debout MPs in the House of Commons on June 6, 2018. On September 17, 2018, they rejoined the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caucus. ==References== Category:Parliamentary groups in Canada Category:42nd Canadian Parliament Category:2018 establishments in Quebec Category:2018 disestablishments in Quebec Category:Political parties established in 2018 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2018 Category:Political parties of minorities Category:Independent politicians in Canada Category:Political schisms ",
