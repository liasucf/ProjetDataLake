    "text": "Little Russia, sometimes Little Rus' (, , , , , ; , ; or Rus' Minor from , ), is a geographical and historical term used to describe the modern-day territories of Ukraine, first used by Galician ruler Boles\u0142aw-Jerzy II, who in 1335 signed his decrees as Dux totius Russi\u00e6 minoris.\u0415\u0444\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0410.\u042f. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a., \"\u041b\u044b\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044c\", 1990, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 87. Little originally meaning the smaller part, with time, \"Little Russia\" developed into a political and geographical concept in Russia, referring to most of the territory of modern- day Ukraine before the 20th century. Accordingly, derivatives such as \"Little Russian\" (, ) were commonly applied to the people, language, and culture of the area. Prior to the revolutionary events of 1917, a large part of the region's \u00e9lite population adopted a Little Russian identity that competed with the local Ukrainian identity. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, and with the amalgamation of Ukrainian territories into one administrative unit (the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), the term started to recede from common use. Its subsequent usage has been regarded as derogatory by Ukrainians. The term is archaic, and Ukrainians regard its anachronistic usage as offensive. == Etymology == Dialectic partition of the Russian language in 1915 (including Little Russian dialect) The toponym translates as Little or Lesser Rus\u2019 and is adapted from the Greek term, used in medieval times by Patriarchs of Constantinople since the 14th century (it first appeared in church documents in 1335). The Byzantines called the northern and southern parts of Rus\u2019 lands () \u2013 Greater Rus\u2019) and ( \u2013 Lesser or Little Rus\u2019), respectively. Initially Little or Lesser meant the smaller part, as after the division of the united Rus' Metropolis (ecclesiastical province) into two parts in 1305, a new southwestern metropolis in the Kingdom of Halych-Volynia consisted of only 6 of the 19 former eparchies. \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u0410. \u0412. \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c // \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u2013 \u041c.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0410\u041d \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, 1947. \u2013 \u2116 7. \u2013 \u0421. 24\u201338. It later lost its ecclesiastical associations and became a geographical name only. In the 17th century, the term Malorossiya was introduced into Russian. In English the term is often translated Little Russia or Little Rus\u2019, depending on context.Some works of modern scholars that make such distinction are: Paul Robert Magocsi \"The Roots of Ukrainian Nationalism: Galicia As Ukraine's Piedmont\", University of Toronto Press (2002), Serhii Plokhy, \"The Origins of the Slavic Nations: Premodern Identities in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus\", Cambridge University Press (2006), ==Historical usage== Nikolay Sergeyev. \"Apple blossom.

In a 1335 letter to Dietrich von Altenburg, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, he styled himself \u00abdux totius Rusi\u00e6 Minoris\u00bb. The name was used by Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople in 1361 when he created two metropolitan sees: Great Rus' in Vladimir and Kiev and Little Rus' with its centers in Galich (Halych) and Novgorodok (Navahrudak). King Casimir III of Poland was called \"the king of Lechia and Little Rus'.\" According to Mykhaylo Hrushevsky, Little Rus' was the Halych-Volhynian Principality, after the downfall of which the name ceased to be used.\u0413\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041c.\u0421. \u0406\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438-\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438, \u0442\u043e\u043c I, \u041a. 1994, \"\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0430\", \u0441. 1\u20132. In the post-medieval period, the name Little Rus' was first used by the Eastern Orthodox clergy of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, e.g. by influential cleric and writer Ioan Vyshensky (1600, 1608), Metropolitan Matthew of Kiev and All Rus' (1606), Bishop Ioann (Biretskoy) of Peremyshl, Metropolitan Isaiah (Kopinsky) of Kiev, Archimandrite Zacharias Kopystensky:de:Zacharias Kopystenski of Kiev Pechersk Lavra, etc.\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041e. \u0412. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0456 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u043e\u044e. \u2013 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0456\u043c \u00ab\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u00bb (1998), \u2013 \u0441. 276. The term has been applied to all Orthodox Ruthenian lands of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Vyshensky addressed \"the Christians of Little Russia, brotherhoods of Lviv and Vilna,\" and Kopystensky wrote \"Little Russia, or Kiev and Lithuania.\" The term was adopted in the 17th century by the Tsardom of Russia to refer to the Cossack Hetmanate of Left-bank Ukraine, when the latter fell under Russian protection after the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654). From 1654 to 1721, the official title of Russian tsars contained the language (literal translation) \"The Sovereign of all Rus': the Great, the Little, and the White.\" The term Little Rus' has been used in letters of the Cossack Hetmans Bohdan Khmelnytsky\u00ab\u2026\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0436 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u044f\u00bb. \"\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0441 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439. \u0414\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0432 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\", \u0442.

Innokentiy Gizel, Archimandrite of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, wrote that the Russian people were a union of three branches\u2014 Great Russia, Little Russia, and White Russia\u2014under the sole legal authority of the Moscow Tsars. The term Little Russia has been used in Ukrainian chronicles by Samiilo Velychko, in a chronicle of the Hieromonk Leontiy (Bobolinski), and in Thesaurus by Archimandrite Ioannikiy (Golyatovsky).https://sk.theglossypages.com/golyatovsky-ioannicius-95281\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041e. \u0412. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0456 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u043e\u044e. \u2013 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432: \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0456\u043c \u00ab\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u00bb, 1998. \u2013 \u0441. 279. The usage of the name was later broadened to apply loosely to the parts of Right-bank Ukraine when it was annexed by Russia at the end of the 18th century upon the partitions of Poland. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Russian Imperial administrative units known as the Little Russian Governorate and eponymous General Governorship were formed and existed for several decades before being split and renamed in subsequent administrative reforms. Up to the very end of the 19th century, Little Russia was the prevailing term for much of the modern territory of Ukraine controlled by the Russian Empire, as well as for its people and their language. This can be seen from its usage in numerous scholarly, literary and artistic works. Ukrainophile historians Mykhaylo Maksymovych, Nikolay Kostomarov, Dmytro Bahaliy, and Volodymyr Antonovych acknowledged the fact that during the Russo- Polish wars, Ukraine had only a geographical meaning, referring to the borderlands of both states, but Little Russia was the ethnonym of Little (Southern) Russian people.In his private diary Taras Shevchenko wrote \"Little Russia\" or \"Little Russian\" twenty one times, and \"Ukraine\" 3 times (\"Ukrainian\" \u2013 never) and (\"Kozak\" \u2013 74). At the same time in his poetry he used only \"Ukraine\" (and \"Ukrainian\" \u2013 never).

The term Little Russian language was used by the state authorities in the first Russian Empire Census, conducted in 1897. ==From Little Russia to Ukraine== The term Little Russia, which traces its origin to medieval times, was once widely used as the name for the geographic territory. The first appearance of the name Ukraine (Ukrayina) was in 12th-century chronicles; it was used sporadically from the mid-17th century until it was reintroduced in the 19th century by several writers making a conscious effort to awaken Ukrainian national awareness.Ukrainians in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine But it was not until the 20th century when the modern term Ukraine started to prevail, while Little Russia gradually fell out of use. ==Modern context== The term Little Russia (Rus' Minor) is now anachronistic when used to refer to the country Ukraine and the modern Ukrainian nation, its language, culture, etc. Such usage is typically perceived as conveying an imperialist view that the Ukrainian territory and people (\"Little Russians\") belong to \"one, indivisible Russia.\"Analysis of the events of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine by Prof. Y. Petrovsky-Shtern Retrieved May 23, 2007 Today, many Ukrainians consider the term disparaging, indicative of imperial Russian (and Soviet) suppression of Ukrainian identity and language. It has continued to be used in Russian nationalist discourse, in which modern Ukrainians are presented as a single people in a united Russian nation. Mikhail Smolin, \"\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u00ab\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u00bb \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e(Overcoming the \"Ukrainianness\" and the all-Russian unity), \u00ab\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u042e\u0433\u043e-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u00bb, \u21161, 2006 \u0433. This has provoked new hostility toward and disapproval of the term by some Ukrainians. ==\"Little Russianness\"== The concept of \"Little Russianness\" () is defined by some Ukrainian authors as a provincial complex they see in parts of the Ukrainian community due to its lengthy existence within the Russian Empire. They describe it as an \"indifferent, and sometimes a negative stance towards Ukrainian national-statehood traditions and aspirations, and often as active support of Russian culture and of Russian imperial policies.\"Ihor Pidkova (editor), Roman Shust (editor), \"Dovidnyk z istorii Ukrainy\", 3-Volumes, \"\u041c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\" (t. 2), Kiev, 1993\u20131999, (t. 1), (t. 2), (t. 3). Mykhailo Drahomanov, who used the terms Little Russia and Little Russian in his historical works, applied the term Little Russianness to Russified Ukrainians, whose national character was formed under \"alien pressure and influence\" and who consequently adopted the \"worse qualities of other nationalities and lost the better ones of their own.\" Ukrainian conservative ideologue and politician Vyacheslav Lypynsky defined the term as \"the malaise of statelessness.\"Ihor Hyrych. \"Den\". Lypynsky on the imperative of political independence Retrieved May 23, 2007 The same inferiority complex has been said to apply to the Ukrainians of Galicia with respect to Poland (gente ruthenus, natione polonus). The related term Magyarony has been used to describe Magyarized Rusyns in Carpathian Ruthenia who advocated for the union of that region with Hungary. The term \"Little Russians\" has also been used to denote stereotypically uneducated, rustic Ukrainians exhibiting little or no self- esteem. The uncouth stage persona of popular Ukrainian singer and performer Andriy Mykhailovych Danylko is an embodiment of this stereotype; his Surzhyk- speaking drag persona Verka Serduchka has also been seen as perpetuating this demeaning image.
