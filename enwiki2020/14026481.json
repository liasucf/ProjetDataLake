    "text": "Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114 (1946), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a draft board's refusal to classify a Jehovah's Witness as minister is, after exhausting administrative remedies, subject to judicial review.. == Background == According to the judicial opinion itself: > Estep's local board classified him as I-A, i.e., as available for military > service. Sec. 5(d) of the Selective Service Act exempts from training and > service (but not from registration) \"regular or duly ordained ministers of > religion\". Under the regulations those in that category are classified as > IV-D. Estep, a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, claimed that he was entitled > to that classification. The local board ruled against him. He took his case > to the appeal board which classified him as I-A. He then asked the State and > National Directors of Selective Service to appeal to the President for him. > His request was refused. The local board thereupon ordered him to report for > induction. He reported at the time and place indicated. He was accepted by > the Navy. But he refused to be inducted, claiming that he was exempt from > service because he was an ordained minister of the gospel. He was indicted > under 11 of the Act for wilfully failing and refusing to submit to > induction. He sought to defend on the ground that as a Jehovah's Witness he > was a minister of religion and that he had been improperly denied exemption > from service, because the classifying agencies acted arbitrarily and > capriciously in refusing to classify him as IV-D. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1946 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Stone Court Category:Jehovah's Witnesses litigation in the United States Category:Conscription in the United States Category:Conscription law Category:1946 in religion Category:Christianity and law in the 20th century ",
