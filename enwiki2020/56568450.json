He for brief served as the Chairman Union Council before he was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a candidate for Pakistan Muslim League (N) for Constituency NA-154 (Lodhran-I) in by-polls held in February 2018. He received 113,542 votes and defeated Ali Tareen, a candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and son of Jahangir Khan Tareen. The seat fell vacant following the disqualification of Jahangir Khan Tareen by the Supreme Court of Pakistan for being \u201cdishonest\u201d in December 2017. The constituency was considered a stronghold of Tareens and PTI and hence the defeat of a PTI candidate was termed a \"a major upset\" and \"huge blow\" to the party ahead of the July 2018 elections. He took an oath as Member of the National Assembly on 19 February 2018. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Pakistani MNAs 2013\u20132018 Category:People from Lodhran District Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
