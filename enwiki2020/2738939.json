He completed his military career at the rank of Lieutenant General. == Life == He was an illegitimate son of Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia and a French actress. Konstantinov graduated from Mikhailovskoye Artillery School in St. Petersburg in 1836. In 1844, he invented a device for measuring the flight speed of projectiles at any point of their trajectory. In 1847 Konstantinov created a ballistic rocket pendulum, which would allow to establish a law of changing rocket motion in time. With the help of this device, he was able to determine the influence of the form and design of a rocket on its ballistic characteristics, thereby laying the foundations for calculated rocket designs. In 1849 he was appointed commander of the Petersburg Rocketry Department (\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435). In 1861, he supervised the construction of a rocket factory in Nikolayev, which he would head six years later. Konstantinov is known to have created structurally perfect missiles (for the 19th century) with a range of 4 to 5 km, launch pads, and rocket-making machines. He authored a number of works on rocket science, artillery, firearms, pyrotechnics, and aeronautics. A crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him. == See also == * List of Russian inventors == External links == *Biography of Konstantinov Konstantinov, Konstantin Konstantinov, Konstantin Konstantinov, Konstantin Konstantinov, Konstantin Konstantinov, Konstantin Category:19th-century Russian people ",
