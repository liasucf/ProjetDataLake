After becoming a flying instructor and a short period as manager of the Mercury Aviation Company, founded by one of his students, Cecil B. DeMille, Wilson became more and more skilled in performing stunts, including wing-walking, and left the company to become a professional stunt pilot, specializing in Hollywood aviation films.Wynne 1987, pp. 16\u201317. Wilson worked together with stuntmen like Frank Clarke and Wally Timm and also for film companies, including Universal Pictures.

Wilson produced his own movies until 1927, when he went back to work with Universal. ==Reception== Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo, in Aviation in the Cinema (1985) said The Sky Skidder was only one of a long list of aviation films that showcased Wilson's talents. He alternately wrote, acted and flew in a career that \"spanned more than 10 years, and he acted in more films than any other professional pilot.\" In The Sky Skidder , Pendo noted, \"The aerial stunts featured a parachute jump, a faked plane change, and the pick-up of the heroine from a car by the hero on a ladder hanging from a plane.\"Pendo 1985, p. 7. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Pendo, Stephen.
