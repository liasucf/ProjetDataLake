    "text": "Jason Neil Beckford (born 14 February 1970) is an English former footballer who played as a forward for Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers, Port Vale, Birmingham City, Bury, Stoke City, Millwall, Northampton Town in the 1990s. He also managed Mossley from 2003 to 2007, taking the club to two promotions. His elder brother Darren also played professional football. ==Playing career== Beckford began his career at Manchester City in 1987\u201388, who were then a Second Division side under the stewardship of Mel Machin. City won promotion as the division's runners-up in 1988\u201389, and went on to finish 14th in the First Division in 1989\u201390 under new boss Howard Kendall. Towards the end of the 1990\u201391 season, new manager Peter Reid allowed Beckford to drop down a division to play four games on loan at Don Mackay's Blackburn Rovers. After returning from Ewood Park, he found himself out of the first team picture at Maine Road. John Rudge \u2013 who had sold his brother Darren a few months earlier \u2013 brought Beckford on loan to Port Vale in September as cover for the injured Keith Houchen. He claimed a goal in a 2\u20131 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 12 October, before leaving Vale Park after five Second Division appearances. He moved on to Birmingham City in the 1991\u201392 season for a \u00a350,000 fee, though would never force himself into manager Terry Cooper's first team plans. He scored the \"Blues\" consolation goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Stoke City at the Victoria Ground on 4 January, but started just two league games as Birmingham won promotion as runners-up of the Third Division. He started three games in the 1992\u201393 campaign, and claimed a goal at St Andrew's in a 2\u20130 win over Southend United on 1 September. Beckford's only appearances in the 1993\u201394 season came at Gigg Lane in a three-game loan spell with Mike Walsh's Bury. Beckford spent the first half of the 1994\u201395 season at Stoke City, but made just three starts for the \"Potters\". He then joined Mick McCarthy's Millwall, and played nine First Division games in the second half of the 1994\u201395 season. However, he left The Old Den at the end of the season, and arrived at Third Division side Northampton Town for the start of the 1995\u201396 campaign. He made four substitute appearances for Ian Atkins's \"Cobblers\", before announcing his retirement at Sixfields due to injury. ==Management and coaching career== Beckford arrived at Mossley after coaching Bolton Wanderers' Academy side. He was appointed assistant manager in June 2002 and, following Ally Pickering's sudden departure in July 2003 he was appointed team manager. He led the \"Lilywhites\" to second place in the North West Counties League in 2003\u201304, which was enough to secure a place in the Northern Premier League. A seventh-place finish in 2004\u201305 saw Mossley miss out on the Division One play-offs by a three-point margin, before they won the league in 2005\u201306. However they could not survive in the Premier Division, and Beckford left the club after relegation in 2006\u201307. After leaving this post in April 2007, he returned to Bolton in 2008 as part of the club's restructured youth academy, and also worked as the under-16 coach alongside Steve Morgan at Oldham Athletic. In August 2012, he moved to Canada to work as Newmarket Soccer Club's technical director. ==Personal life== His brother, Darren Beckford, is a former professional footballer, and his son Ethan Beckford has also played professional football. ==Career statistics== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Manchester City |1987\u201388 |Second Division |5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |1988\u201389 |Second Division |8||1||0||0||4||0||0||0||12||1 |- |1989\u201390 |First Division |5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |1990\u201391 |First Division |2||0||0||0||1||1||0||0||3||1 |- |Blackburn Rovers (loan) |1990\u201391 |Second Division |4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- |Port Vale (loan) |1991\u201392 |Second Division |5||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Birmingham City |1991\u201392 |Third Division |4||1||0||0||0||0||1||0||5||1 |- |1992\u201393 |First Division |3||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||1 |- |1993\u201394 |First Division |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |Bury (loan) |1993\u201394 |Third Division |3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- |Stoke City |1994\u201395 |First Division |4||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||5||0 |- |Millwall |1994\u201395 |First Division |9||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||9||0 |- |Northampton Town |1995\u201396 |Third Division |1||0||1||0||0||0||2||0||4||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !53!!4!!1!!0!!5!!1!!4!!0!!63!!5 |} :A.
