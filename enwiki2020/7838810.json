The road continues after the traffic light junction of Nicoll Highway, Esplanade Drive and Raffles Avenue towards Orchard Road. It then ends at the junction of Fort Canning Road, Bencoolen Street and Orchard Road, which it continues to be Orchard Road. Stamford Road is home to several landmarks, including Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford and the National Museum of Singapore. ==Etymology and history== Stamford Road was named after the modern founder of Singapore, Thomas Stamford Raffles. It was formerly known as Hospital Street. In Hokkien, it was formerly known as lau chui khe or \"flowing water road\", due to the high tide, the now covered up Stamford Canal overflowed its banks. The road used to house the Saint Andrew's School from the late 19th century till 1941 when it moved to Woodsville Hill. The site was taken by the now demolished National Library in 1960 until it was demolished in 2005 to make way for the new Fort Canning Tunnel. ==Landmarks== This is a list of landmarks, from east to west. *Civilian War Memorial *Saint Andrew's Cathedral *Raffles City and Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford *City Hall MRT station *SMRT Headquarters Building *Capitol Building *CHIJMES *Stamford House *Stamford Court *Singapore Management University *National Museum of Singapore *Vanguard Building ==References== *Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern University Press, Category:Roads in Singapore Category:Downtown Core (Singapore) Category:Museum Planning Area ",
