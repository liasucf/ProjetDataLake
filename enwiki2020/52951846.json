Along with a Polish national team, three other squads were given wildcard places into the race, and as such, formed the event's 22-team peloton. The number of riders allowed per squad was seven, down from eight, in 2016; all teams except (six riders) did so, and therefore the start list contained a total of 153 riders. ==Stages== ===Stage 1=== ;29 July 2017 \u2013 Krak\u00f3w to Krak\u00f3w, The opening stage of the 2017 Tour de Pologne was a ride around Krakow, effectively designed for the sprinters. Having left from the city's Old Square, the peloton completed an anti-clockwise loop around the city, which contained the only two categorised climbs, in the villages of Bachowice and Kasz\u00f3w, both fourth category. Once the riders returned to Krak\u00f3w, they first passed the sole intermediate sprint, before completing three laps around a circuit, to complete the day's running. {| |- || || |} ===Stage 2=== ;30 July 2017 \u2013 Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry to Katowice, The second stage was another opportunity for the sprinters. After the start in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry, the riders headed south-east, passing through the intermediate sprints in Piekary \u015al\u0105skie, Chorz\u00f3w and Siemianowice \u015al\u0105skie, following devious roads before hitting the finishing circuit in Katowice. It contained the two category four climbs of the day, and the final metres before the finish line headed slightly downhill, with speeds of about expected from the top riders. {| |- || || |} ===Stage 3=== ;31 July 2017 \u2013 Jaworzno to Szczyrk, After the opening two sprint stages, the next stage took the riders into the Silesian Beskids with a route that favoured the climbers. After a reasonably flat first half, the first category Salmopol was climbed, before the riders entered a circuit containing the Zameczek climb, which was climbed twice. Once the riders had descended, they returned over the Salmopol, going in the opposite way from that climbed previously, with the summit coming before the finish line. The final ascent was only long, but averaged 11.3%. {| |- || || |} ===Stage 4=== ;1 August 2017 \u2013 Zawiercie to Zabrze, With a length of , the fourth stage was the longest stage of the 2017 Tour de Pologne. Having started in Zawiercie, the first section of the route was hilly, covering the sole categorised climb of the day in Olkusz, where there was also an intermediate sprint, with the other two being in Jastrz\u0119bie- Zdr\u00f3j and Rybnik. A finishing circuit was also utilised in the finishing city of Zabrze, with three laps of a long loop being completed to complete proceedings. {| |- || || |} ===Stage 5=== ;2 August 2017 \u2013 Olimp Nagawczyna to Rzesz\u00f3w, The stage started from Olimp Nagawczyna, near D\u0119bica, heading south- east, through the Podkarpackie Voivodeship. The route was hilly throughout, with four categorised climbs all coming in the second half of the section \u2013 two ascents in Gmina Lubenia and one in \u0141any (part of the village Matys\u00f3wka), before the riders entered Rzesz\u00f3w, where the only intermediate sprint was held. There, the peloton entered the lengthy circuit, to be covered once, and containing another ascent of \u0141any, the summit coming before the finish. {| |- || || |} ===Stage 6=== ;3 August 2017 \u2013 Wieliczka Salt Mine to Zakopane, {| |- || || |} ===Stage 7=== ;4 August 2017 \u2013 Terma Bukowina Tatrza\u0144ska to Bukowina Tatrza\u0144ska, {| |- || || |} ==Classification leadership table== In the 2017 Tour de Pologne, four different jerseys were awarded. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers at intermediate sprints (three seconds to first, two seconds to second and one second to third) and at the finish of all stages: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. The leader of the classification received a yellow jersey; it was considered the most important of the 2017 Tour de Pologne, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Points for the mountains classification |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 20 || 14 || 10 || 6 || 4 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 10 || 7 || 5 || 3 || 2 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 5 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 3 || 2 || 1 ||colspan=2| 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 1 ||colspan=4| 0 |} There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a purple jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher- categorised climbs. Double points were also awarded for the premier first- category climb on the final stage. Additionally, there was a sprints classification, which awarded a white jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 20 in a stage. For winning a stage, a rider earned 20 points, with a point fewer per place down to 1 point for 20th place. The fourth and final jersey represented the active rider classification, marked by a blue jersey. This was decided at the race's intermediate sprints, awarding points on a 3\u20132\u20131 scale. There was also a classification for Polish riders, with the highest-placed rider appearing on the podium each day. As well as this, a teams classification was also calculated, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background-color: #efefef;\" ! width=\"2%\"| Stage ! width=\"14%\"| Winner ! width=\"14%\"| General classification () 25px ! width=\"14%\"| ! width=\"14%\"| Mountains classification () 25px ! width=\"14%\"| ! width=\"14%\"| Polish rider classification () ! width=\"14%\"| |- |scope=row| 1 | Peter Sagan |style=\"background:yellow;\"| Peter Sagan |style=\"background:white;\"| Peter Sagan |style=\"background:violet;\" rowspan=2| Martijn Keizer |style=\"background:lightblue;\"| Martijn Keizer |style=\"background:salmon;\"| Pawe\u0142 Franczak |style=\"background:navajowhite;\"| |- |scope=row| 2 | Sacha Modolo |style=\"background:yellow;\"| Danny van Poppel |style=\"background:white;\"| Danny van Poppel |style=\"background:lightblue;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Adrian Kurek |style=\"background:salmon;\"| Kamil Gradek |style=\"background:navajowhite;\"| |- |scope=row| 3 | Dylan Teuns |style=\"background:yellow;\" rowspan=3| Peter Sagan |style=\"background:white;\" rowspan=5| Peter Sagan |style=\"background:violet;\" rowspan=2| Maciej Paterski |style=\"background:salmon;\" rowspan=\"5\"| Rafa\u0142 Majka |style=\"background:navajowhite;\" rowspan=\"3\"| |- |scope=row| 4 | Caleb Ewan |style=\"background:lightblue;\" rowspan=4| Bert-Jan Lindeman |- |scope=row| 5 | Danny van Poppel |style=\"background:violet;\"|Maxime Monfort |- |scope=row| 6 | Jack Haig |style=\"background:yellow;\" rowspan=2| Dylan Teuns |style=\"background:violet;\"| Antwan Tolhoek |style=\"background:navajowhite;\" rowspan=2| |- |scope=row| 7 | Wout Poels |style=\"background:violet;\"| Diego Rosa |- ! colspan=2|Final !style=\"background:gold;\"| Dylan Teuns !style=\"background:offwhite;\"| Peter Sagan !style=\"background:#B93B8F;\"| !style=\"background:#0049DC;\"| !style=\"background:red;\"| Rafa\u0142 Majka !style=\"background:#FF8C00;\"| |} ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * 2017 Category:2017 UCI World Tour Category:2017 in Polish sport Category:July 2017 sports events in Europe Category:August 2017 sports events in Europe ",
