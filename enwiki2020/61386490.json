    "text": "Mission BBQ is an American barbecue restaurant chain based in Glen Burnie, Maryland. Bill Kraus and Steve Newton opened the first location on September 11, 2011, as a way to support military, police, firefighters, and first responders. Unlike many barbecue restaurants, Mission BBQ does not specialize in any one regional barbecue, and instead, offers a variety of regional meats and sauces. ==History== Bill Kraus, a former apparel executive, and Steve Newton, a former restaurant executive, started with the concept of supporting military and public response forces, and then decided to go into the barbecue industry. After doing some market research throughout the United States, they opened the first Mission BBQ in Glen Burnie, Maryland on the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. They opened another Mission BBQ in Perry Hall, Maryland the following year before recording growth numbers of three new restaurants in 2013, nine in 2014 and 2015, and 17 in 2016. Growth spiked sharply post-2017, with the company planning an expansion strategy of 20 to 25 new locations a year, all privately owned and financed through M&T; Bank and Goldman Sachs. ==Operations== After getting a handle on the barbecue scene in the United States, Kraus and Newton decided to not include microwaves or freezers in their restaurants, and instead, smoking the meat just a few hours ahead of time. Mission BBQ locations are decorated with community- donated memorabilia from military and public response forces, and every store pauses operations at noon each day to play the national anthem. The chain also utilizes servers in the dining area of the restaurants. Mission BBQ also operates a catering business. ==Community outreach== The concept of supporting military came from co-founder Bill Kraus, who had two sons serve in the United States Marine Corps. Mission BBQ has utilized multiple methods to support the military and veterans, such as fundraisers preceding the opening of new locations, giving free food to veterans on their wars' remembrance days, and hiring local veterans. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Restaurant chains in the United States Category:Barbecue restaurants Category:Restaurants established in 2011 Category:American companies established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Maryland ",
