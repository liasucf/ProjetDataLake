    "text": "Artist's conception of the Milky Way Galactic astronomy is the study of the Milky Way galaxy and all its contents. This is in contrast to extragalactic astronomy, which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies. Galactic astronomy should not be confused with galaxy formation and evolution, which is the general study of galaxies, their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take. The Milky Way galaxy, where the Solar System belongs, is in many ways the best studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible wavelengths by regions of cosmic dust. The development of radio astronomy, infrared astronomy and submillimetre astronomy in the 20th Century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time. == Subcategories == A standard set of subcategories is used by astronomical journals to split up the subject of Galactic Astronomy: # abundances \u2013 the study of the location of elements heavier than helium # bulge \u2013 the study of the bulge around the center of the Milky Way # center \u2013 the study of the central region of the Milky Way # disk \u2013 the study of the Milky Way disk (the plane upon which most galactic objects are aligned) # evolution \u2013 the evolution of the Milky Way # formation \u2013 the formation of the Milky Way # fundamental parameters \u2013 the fundamental parameters of the Milky Way (mass, size etc.) # globular cluster \u2013 globular clusters within the Milky Way # halo \u2013 the large halo around the Milky Way # kinematics and dynamics \u2013 the motions of stars and clusters # nucleus \u2013 the region around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way (Sagittarius A*) # open clusters and associations \u2013 open clusters and associations of stars # solar neighbourhood \u2013 nearby stars # stellar content \u2013 numbers and types of stars in the Milky Way # structure \u2013 the structure (spiral arms etc.) == Stellar populations == * Star clusters **Globular clusters **Open clusters == Interstellar medium == * Interplanetary space - Interplanetary medium - interplanetary dust * Interstellar space - Interstellar medium - interstellar dust * Intergalactic space - Intergalactic medium - Intergalactic dust == See also == * Galaxy ** Milky Way * Extragalactic astronomy ==References== ==External links== *Mapping the hydrogen gas in the Milky Way *Mapping the dust in the centre of the Milky Way Category:Astronomical sub-disciplines ",
