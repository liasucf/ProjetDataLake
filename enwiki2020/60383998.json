She comes from an Irish Catholic family and attended high school at DeLaSalle High School, graduating in 2001.

A third book, Hot Young Widows Club, was also published in 2019. She is also the host of a podcast called \"Terrible, Thanks for Asking\". ==Nonprofit and support group== In 2015, McInerny founded the nonprofit \"Still Kickin\", which got its name from a phrase on one of her late husband's t-shirts. Each month the nonprofit designates a \"Still Kickin Hero\", who then receives the proceeds from the sales of branded merchandise. Benefits of the nonprofit include those struggling with illness, death, or other challenges. McInerny created the Facebook grief support group called the \"Hot Young Widows Club\". The group has hundreds of members, approximately 6% of whom are men. ==Personal life== In 2010, McInerny began dating Aaron Purmort.
