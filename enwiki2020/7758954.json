    "text": "Root was a multimedia project composed of 25 one-minute guitar pieces improvised by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. These samples were sent out to around 100 people - both visual artists as well as musicians - in Hoover bags to remix or create accompanying artwork for. The results were then released on CD, as a limited edition CD in a numbered hoover bag (of which only 2000 were created), as a 5 piece vinyl box set, and as an exhibition which featured work by Angela Bulloch, David Bowie, Gavin Turk and many others. Though no track listing comes with the album, just a list of the track contributors, some titles have come out in interviews with those involved. These are listed below where applicable. ==Track listing== #\"Untitled\" w/ Derek Bailey - (1:07) #\"Keep Trying the Old Number\" w/ Alec Empire - (4:58) #\"Untitled\" w/ Mogwai - (1:12) #\"Moore Shit\" w/ Luke Vibert - (4:50) #\"Untitled\" w/ Donald Christie & The Underdog - (1:38) #\"101%\" w/ Blur - (5:54) #\"Untitled\" w/ Mark Webber - (2:28) #\"Untitled\" w/ Stereolab - (3:42) #\"Beaujolais Nouveau Day\" w/ Cheap Glue - (2:11) #\"Untitled\" w/ Add N to (X) - (2:55) #\"Untitled\" w/ Spring Heel Jack - (5:16) #\"Hard as Fuck '97\" w/ The Hypnotist - (0:37) #\"Your Love\" w/ The Mellowtrons - (2:01) #\"Roots\" w/ Warren Defever - (4:01) #\"Untitled\" w/ V/Vm - (2:34) #\"Untitled\" w/ The Third Eye Foundation - (4:09) #\"No. 11\" w/ David Cunningham - (1:57) #\"Needled\" w/ Echo Park - (3:33) #\"National Enhancer\" w/ Merzbow - (3:44) #\"Super\" w/ Richard Thomas - (5:48) #\"Untitled\" w/ Stock, Hausen and Walkman - (4:10) #\"Kleen\" w/ Twisted Science vs Burzootie - (2:40) #\"Scion\" w/ Bruce Gilbert - (3:15) #\"Untitled\" w/ Arashi vs The Red King - (2:37) #\"Chew on This\" w/ Russell Haswell - (1:02) ==References== * Category:1999 compilation albums ",
