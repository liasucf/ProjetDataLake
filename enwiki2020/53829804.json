Designed by dragster and funny car builder Sammy Miller in 1974, the car was allegedly a product of Miller's dislike of repeated funny car fires. It featured bicycle front wheels, a low-mounted, front-sloping rear wing, and a mid-mounted engine (placed further ahead of the rear axle than most similar dragsters).Taylor, p.38. The body was a pronounced wedge shape, and covered the front of the slicksTaylor, p.38 photo. (unlike Wynns Stormer, which had a more conventional body and broad wedge fairings over the engine and exhaust, ahead of the rear tires). The exhaust pipes were also enclosed.Taylor, p.38 photo In theory, the wedge body offered an aerodynamic advantage, decreasing turbulent airflow over the rear wheels, as well as increasing downforce;Taylor, p.37, \"Leland Kolb 'Polish Wedge'\". in practise, the extra weight exceeded any advantage. Miller ran the car for the 1974 season, but had \"mixed results\";Taylor, p.38. the car had no obvious edge over more conventional rear-engined dragsters. ==Notes== ==Sources== *Taylor, Thom. \"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\" in Hot Rod, April 2017, pp.30-43.
