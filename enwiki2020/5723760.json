    "text": "Andi Zeisler (born c. 1972, New York) is a writer and co-founder of Bitch Media, a nonprofit feminist media organization based in Portland, Oregon. == Biography == In 1994, Zeisler graduated from the Colorado College with a BA in fine art. After graduation, she moved with high school friend Lisa Jervis to Oakland and began making plans for their own zine when Sassy magazine was purchased by another publisher. Sassy's change in focus led the pair to believe there was a niche they could fill. In 1996, Zeisler co-founded Bitch magazine with Jervis which began as an all-volunteer zine with a circulation of three hundred copies. In 1998, the pair began to grow the magazine into a quarterly publication with help from the Independent Press Association. It is now internationally distributed with a circulation of more than fifty thousand. Bitch Media's mission is to provide and encourage an engaged feminist response to pop culture. In 2007, the magazine was moved to Portland and in 2009 rebranded as Bitch Media. Zeisler's writing, which focuses mainly on feminist interpretations of popular culture, has been featured in a variety of publications including Mother Jones, the San Francisco Chronicle, and Ms. In 2016, she published We Were Feminists Once about the relationship between pop culture (or marketplace feminism) and the feminism that challenges power through activism. ==Published works== * BitchFest: 10 Years of Cultural Criticism from the Pages of Bitch Magazine.
