Youth Academy is the football academy system of Greek professional football club Olympiacos consisting of six official youth teams (Under-10, Under-13, Under-14, Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19), based on the young athletes' age. Other age-based youth teams (e.g. Under-8) are also part of the academy, however they do not appear as official youth teams. Olympiacos' U-15, U-17 and U-20 teams all play in Greek Superleague's youth competitions (Super League U-15, U-17 and U-19 respectively), while the U19 team is a regular participant in the UEFA Youth League. The latter also featured in the 2012-13 Next Gen Series, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition. == Academy Personnel == As of 6 October 2020 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- | align=left|Academy Director | align=left| Antonis Pikoulas |- | align=left|Technical Director | align=left| Thodoris Eleftheriadis |- | align=left|U-19 Manager | align=left| Antonis Nikopolidis |- | align=left|U-19 Coach | align=left| Tasos Pantos |- | align=left|U-17 Manager | align=left| Dimitris Mavrogenidis |- | align=left|U-15 Manager, Head scout | align=left| Ariel Ibagaza |- | align=left|Youth Goalkeeping Coach | align=left| Luigi Cennamo |- | align=left|U-17 Goalkeeping Coach | align=left| Nikolaos Katsikostas |- | align=left|Scout | align=left| Giorgos Famelis |- | align=left|Scout | align=left| Giorgos Vaitsis |- | align=left|Scout | align=left| Vasilis Georgopoulos |- | align=left|Scout | align=left| Nikos Krimitzas |- |} == Olympiacos U-19 Squad == As of 6 October 2020 == Olympiacos U-17 Squad == As of 6 October 2020 == Olympiacos U-15 Squad == As of 6 October 2020 == Honours == Titles won by the Olympiacos academy's teams. ;Olympiacos U-20 * Greek Superleague U-20: 2009-10, 2012-13, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 * U-20 Torino Tournament: 2009 * Dubai Emirates Cup: 2010 * Memoria XXVIII Torneo Juvenil: 2012 ;Olympiacos U-17 * Greek Superleague U-17: 2009\u201310, 2010\u201311, 2014\u201315, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 * U-17 Shakhtar Donetsk Tournament: 2008 * U-17 Anorthosi Cyprus Tournament: 2010 * U-17 Tannenhof Cup: 2013 * U-17 Chicago Indoor Soccer League Champions: 2016 ;Olympiacos U-15 * Greek Superleague U-15: 2013-14, 2015-16, 2019-20 * U-15 Annual Swallows Cup: 2015 * U-15 Chicago Holiday Cup Tournament: 2015 ==References== Category:Olympiacos F.C.
