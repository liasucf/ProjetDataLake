After that Sinnerud skated for 15 years in North America, winning six U.S. and Canadian titles in total. He returned to Norway for the 1904 world and national championships. He won both, but was later stripped of these titles because he participated in professional races in the U.S. (it is not known whether he was paid for that). Disappointed, Sinnerud returned to the U.S. and skated there professionally for several years, winning nothing, but placing within the podium in several races. Although Sinnerud was Norwegian he was often referred to in American newspapers by the nickname \"The Terrible Swede\" because of his speed and the Swedish\u2013Norwegian Union.Old Verona by Robert L. Williams, pg. 87. Arcadia Publishing (1998). \"Sinnirud in front\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Jan. 4 1903, pg. 6**** In 1910 he returned to Norway for good and worked as a farmer outside of Hamar. He also converted his house into an accommodation and training center, becoming Norway's first speed skating coach. His trainees included Jan Langedijk, Klaas Schenk, Kees Broekman, Michael Staksrud, Reidar Liaklev and Hans Engnestangen. Sinnerud was married to Astrid Margaretha Fjetre. He closed up his training center in 1956, after a sudden death of his son Arve at age 43. His grandson Sven Peter Sinnerud became a technician at the Vikingskipet, preparing ice for all championships conducted there since 1994. ==References== ===Notes=== Category:1876 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Hamar Category:Norwegian male speed skaters Category:Norwegian speed skating coaches Category:Norwegian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Norwegian farmers Category:World Allround Speed Skating Championships medalists ",
