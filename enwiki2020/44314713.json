Despite the loss, Robinson, \"who at times stood Harvard's backs on their heads,\" played well. \"Robinson and Duncan stood out all afternoon.\" ===1923=== He was the captain of the 1923 team which upset the Alabama Crimson Tide on Thanksgiving Day 16 to 6. On that game he said, \"Psychology did the trick and turned the tables on the Crimson, for the word went the rounds on the campus that \"they can't do it\"'\u2013referring to Alabama's chances of walking on the Florida team. He also remarked on the many goal line stands by Florida. Robinson was selected All-Southern in 1923. ==References== Category:American football tackles Category:Florida Gators football players Category:All-Southern college football players Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:Sportspeople from Mobile, Alabama Category:1902 births Category:1982 deaths ",
