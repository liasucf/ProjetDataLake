He is also an indie filmmaker. == Career == Remic was first published in 2003 through Orbit Books with his fast-paced action SF thriller, Spiral, and has since written over twenty novels including the Clockwork Vampire Chronicles, a fantasy series, The Blood Dragon Empire grimdark fantasy novels, and A Song For No Man's Land, dark fantasy set during the First World War. His books have been translated into six languages. Remic previously worked as an English teacher at Counthill School and Branston Community Academy in Branston, Lincolnshire, England. Remic writes and directs indie films, originally for the UK-based independent film company Anarchy Films, now for RAM films, and in 2015 released his directorial debut film Impurity. Recently he made films about the iconic ZX Spectrum computer, notably Memoirs of a Spectrum Addict which received \"Pick of the Month\" in Retro Gamer Magazine, followed by Spectrum Addict: LOAD \"FILM2\" in 2018. Remic wrote a number of computer games when he was a child, including several text adventures for the ZX Spectrum in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some of these appeared on the cover-mounted cassettes that accompanied Crash magazine, and others were sold by mail order. Many of his games were produced under the name Psychedelic Hedgehog Software. In 2018 Remic achieved a dream to meet many Spectrum heroes such as Roger Kean, Oliver Frey, Clive Townsend, Jon Ritman, John Hare, Steve Turner, Gary Bracey, Simon Butler, Jim Bagley and many other Spectrum veterans whilst making his documentary feature films. ==Bibliography== === Spiral === # Spiral (Orbit, 2003, ) # Quake (Orbit, 2004, ) # Warhead (Orbit, 2005, ) === Combat K === # War Machine (Solaris, 2007, ) # BioHell (Solaris, 2009, ) # Hardcore (Solaris, 2010, ) # Cloneworld (Solaris, 2011, ) === Clockwork Vampire Chronicles === # Kell's Legend (Angry Robot, 2010, ) # Soul Stealers (Angry Robot, 2010, ) # Vampire Warlords (Angry Robot, 2011, ) * Omnibus (Angry Robot, 2012, ) === Rage of Kings === # The Iron Wolves (Angry Robot, 2014, ) # The White Towers (Angry Robot, 2014, ) === A Song for No Man\u2019s Land === # A Song for No Man\u2019s Land (Tor-Forge, 2016) # Return of Souls (Tor-Forge, 2016, ) # The Iron Beast (Tor-Forge, 2016) === Standalone works === * Serial Killers Incorporated (Anarchy Books, 2011, ) * SIM (Anarchy Books, 2011, ) * Theme Planet (Solaris Books, 2012, ) * Toxicity (Solaris Books, 2012, ) === Anthologies === * Legends 2: Stories in Honour of David Gemmell (NewCon Press, 2015, ASIN B00YMDLVQ8) ==Filmography== *Memoirs of a Spectrum Addict *Spectrum Addict Load \"Film2\" *Memoirs of a Spectrum Addict 2.5 The Lost Tapes *8-Bit wars (in production) ==References== ==External links== * *Anarchy Books * * *Andy Remic ZX-Spectrum games at WOS *Andy Remic interview at Punktalk Category:English science fiction writers Category:Writers from Manchester Category:Living people Category:1971 births Category:English male novelists ",
