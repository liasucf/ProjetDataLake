She was the legal wife of Kobayakawa Takakage, third son of daimy\u014d M\u014dri Motonari. ==Life== Lady Toida was born as the daughter of Kobayakawa Masahira \u2013 the head of the Numata-Kobayakawa clan, which was the head family of the Kobayakawa clan \u2013 but because Masahira died at the young age of 21, her older brother, Shigehira, succeeded the Numata-Kobayakawa clan seat, but Shigehira became blind at a young age. In 1550, he was detained by \u014cuchi Yoshitaka and M\u014dri Motonari under the suspicion of liaison with the Amago clan, and he was forced to retire and enter the priesthood. In 1551, Lady Toida was married to the third son of Motonari, Takakage, who was adopted into and succeeding the Takehara- Kobayakawa clan. This way, the two clans were reunited. Although there were no children between the two, Takakage did not take a concubine, as their relationship was harmonious. However, the Kobayakawa bloodline ceased. For that reason, they adopted Motonari's youngest son, Mototsuna (later named Hidekane) to succeed the family name. Her posthumous Buddhist name is Jik\u014din Gekkei Eichi (\u6148\u5149\u9662\u6708\u6e13\u6c38\u667a). Her tomb is in Yamaguchi at Taiunji Temple. ==In popular culture== Lady Toida is portrayed in the 1997 NHK Taiga drama M\u014dri Motonari as \"Lady Ako\". She is portrayed by Fujiyoshi Kumiko, with her younger incarnation portrayed by Mifune Mika.\u963f\u53e4\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u767b\u5834\u3057\u305f\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30fb\u6f14\u3058\u305f\u4ff3\u512a\u4e00\u89a7 | \u30bb\u30f3\u30b4\u30af\uff01\uff01\uff01 \u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u3084\u6b66\u5c06\u306a\u3069\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u4e09\u8239\u7f8e\u4f73\uff5c\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u30fb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7 \u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 ==References== Category:1619 deaths Category:16th-century Japanese women Category:17th- century Japanese women Category:People of Sengoku-period Japan Category:Kobayakawa clan ",
