One of the world's largest automotive museums, the Petersen Automotive Museum is a nonprofit organization specializing in automobile history and related educational programs. ==History== Founded on June 11, 1994 by magazine publisher Robert E. Petersen and his wife Margie, the $40-million Petersen Automotive Museum is owned and operated by the Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation. The museum was originally located within the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and later moved to a historic department store designed by Welton Becket. Opened in 1962, the building first served as a short-lived U.S. branch of Seibu Department Stores, before operating as an Ohrbach's department store from 1965 to 1986. Six years after Ohrbach's closed, Robert Petersen selected the largely windowless site as an ideal space for a museum\u2014allowing artifacts to be displayed without harmful exposure to direct sunlight. In 2015, the museum underwent an extensive $125 million renovation. The building's fa\u00e7ade was redesigned by the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, and features a stainless-steel ribbon assembly made of 100 tons of 14-gauge type 304 steel in 308 sections, 25 supports and 140,000 custom stainless-steel screws. An Interpretive Master Plan, performed by ObjectIDEA and Brent Johnson Design, re-envisioned the exhibition program and re-organized the collection as three museum experiences under one roof: \"The History, Industry, and Artistry of the Automobile.\" Designers at The Scenic Route configured interior spaces to accommodate changing exhibits. The remodeled museum opened to the public on December 7, 2015.

The remaining half of the collection is kept in a vault, located on the basement level of the building. Age restrictions and an admission premium are in effect to view the vault collection. The ground floor focuses on automotive artistry, showcasing an array of extravagant automobiles. The second floor is principally concerned with industrial engineering\u2014including design, performance, and a collection of interactive teaching exhibits. Special displays on the industry floor cover racing, motorcycles, hot rods and customs. The third floor chronicles the history of the automobile with an emphasis on the car culture of Southern California. Some of the cars, automotive memorabilia, and exhibits include: * An extensive Porsche exhibit (until January 2019), including the rare 1939 Porsche 64, one of only two in existence. * A unique exhibit on the history of the Japanese automotive industry, with many cars on view from Japanese collections * An exhibit on powered children's racecars * The NASCAR Herbie used during filming of Herbie: Fully Loaded. * Lightning McQueen from Disney Pixar Cars and Cars 2 * 1967 Ford MKIII GT40 * 1956 Jaguar XKSS formerly owned by Steve McQueen * 2011 Ford Fiesta from Ken Block\u2019s Gymkhana 3 * 1992 Batmobile from Batman Returns *Ferrari 308 GTS Targa used by Tom Selleck in Magnum, P.I.

Petersen Foundation in April 2011, which includes cash and the property the museum was leasing, as well as many of the vehicles belonging to the Petersens. ==Museum in popular culture== On March 9, 1997, after a party at the museum, The Notorious B.I.G. got into an SUV with his entourage and drove to a red light where he was murdered by an unknown assailant.
