    "text": "The Jordan Rugby Committee is a non-profit organisation with the sole responsibility of developing the sport of rugby in Jordan. It is funded by the Jordan Olympic Committee and is an associate member of World Rugby. Jordan Rugby became an associate member of Asia Rugby in 2008 and then a full member in 2016. == Rugby clubs in Jordan == * Amman Citadel Rugby ClubCitadel RFC. * Nomads Rugby Club * Amman Saracens == Domestic competition == In 2016, through developing five teams to compete in the Domestic 15's League, the Jordan Rugby Committee fulfilled Asia Rugby's criteria for full membership Status. Nomads, Citadel and Aqaba Sharks were the first teams to compete in domestic competitions since 2012. The two new teams welcomed to the competition in 2016 were the Amman Saracens and Citadel Warriors. The Domestic 7's League commenced in July 2016. == Jordan national team == The National Team was officially formed back in 2008, appointing Raymond \"Duaine\" Lindsay as their Head Coach and a few coaching staff from Scotland. For the first couple of years, Jordan played occasional friendly matches, including a few games against Bahrain, until 2010, were they played their first competitive match against Lebanon. Even though they had lost that match by a thin margin, Coach Duaine and his team moved on from that defeat to go on and win the Asian 5 Nations Division IV in 2011, beating Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This was a remarkable achievement for a relatively new team with only a couple of competitive matches under their belt. Since then it has been a bumpy ride, with the team struggling financially and the players struggling with balancing their commitments between work and playing the sport. Jordan's captain from 2010 to 2012 was Saleh Fleifel, succeeded by Zaid Arabiat in 2013 and then by Mohammed AlMajed in 2015. ==Youth development == === Get into Rugby === Get into Rugby was created by World Rugby as a way of introducing the game to the general public. The programme focuses on non contact rugby or tag rugby, where the players just need to make contact with the belt instead of tackling the opponent to the ground. Other than that the basic principles of the game are the same. In Jordan, this programme has been adopted by 10 schools across Amman, who all take part in an annual tournament divided into grades of ability. The tournament is then celebrated with a Get Into Rugby Festival Finale where all the school teams compete for a trophy to commemorate a successful campaign. Jordan Rugby has a vision to expand participation into this programme through the Universities.Get into Rugby.
