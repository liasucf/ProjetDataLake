Ricci started performing in punk bands at the age of 14.Bledsoe, Wayne \"Out Gay Bluesman is opening Ears and Minds\" . Scripps News, November 28, 2007 Initially a vocalist, Ricci decided to pursue an instrument as well and the band chose harmonica for him. Being a blues fan, Ricci's mother encouraged his development as a harmonica player. Ricci names Howard Levy and his overblowing technique as having influenced his early harmonica playing as well as his decision not to switch to the saxophone. He further developed his playing style listening to and emulating Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, Pat Ramsey, and Adam Gussow. Jason has also directly referenced Pat Ramsey as a major influence in his developing a fast pentatonic approach to his playing, stating he prefers to be deliberate in his note choice in favor of speed for \"speed's sake\". ===Musical career=== In 1995, Ricci moved from Portland to Memphis, TN, where shortly thereafter he placed first in the Sonny Boy Blues Society contest at 21 years of age. Later that same year Ricci recorded his first album, Jason Ricci. In Memphis, Ricci began playing with David Malone Kimbrough, son of Junior Kimbrough, and soon was a part of the bands of both Kimbroughs and was sitting in with R. L. Burnside.Bledsoe, Wayne . \"Out Gay Bluesman is opening Ears and Minds\" . Scripps News, November 28, 2007 This also marked a dark period for Ricci, as drug addiction led to a one-year stint in jail.

In 2000, he received a two-page write up in Blues Access magazine by Adam Gussow (harmonica player for Satan and Adam) saying: > I am convinced he along with New Jersey's Dennis Gruenling is one of the > best harmonica players of his generation. Gussow has also included Jason Ricci in the Top 10 All Time Harmonica Players list on his Modern Blues Harmonica website. After 15 months with Big Al and the Heavyweights, and a brief period of living in Raleigh, North Carolina, Ricci started his own band, Jason Ricci & New Blood, in 2002. This band features Shawn Starski, who, in June 2008, was named by Guitar Player magazine as one of the \"Top Ten Hottest New Guitarists.\" In 2005, Ricci was honored with the Muddy Waters Most Promising New Blues Artist award.

Later in 2009 the band recorded Done With The Devil for the same Label. Done With The Devil signaled a new direction in Ricci's musical inspiration, as his study of the occult strongly influenced the writing on the album.Arnold, J.W.. \"Jason Ricci Bringing His Blues Harmonica Magic to K.C.\".

This has been a professional obstacle as well as an opportunity for Ricci to challenge both gay stereotypes and traditional blues expectations: > The [gay] community doesn't like drum sets and guitars and actual live > music. They're used to lip-synching, and dudes in dresses, and Madonna, and > Cher, and techno beats. Those are the things that kept me from coming out > earlier. I felt like I had nothing in common with the gay community, and I > still don't feel like I have a lot in common with the community. I'm hoping > that changes, but the majority of their icons are press-friendly little > Mickey Mouse-doll figureheads that you're more likely to see on a show > redecorating somebody's house than onstage at a blues festival... When I > came out of the closet as a gay white male from an upper-middle-class > suburban home, I came out as not just gay, but as a white guy, and as a guy > who likes punk, and as a guy who didn't come from total poverty, and all > those things that we associate with being 'blues' things. And when I did > that, I wanted to sing about that. I wanted to write songs about what my > life was like, and I wanted to use terminology that was modern.Long, Autumn > . \"Jason Ricci Gets His Rocks Off\" . Blues Revue Magazine .
