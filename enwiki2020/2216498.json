    "text": "Samuel H. Pottle (May 8, 1934 \u2013 July 4, 1978) was an American composer, conductor, and musical director involved in many theatrical and television productions. Born in New Haven, Connecticut, he is perhaps best remembered for his work on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, having co-written the iconic theme song for the latter. However, Sam Pottle was also involved with many theatrical productions in the 1960s and 1970s. His principal collaborators were David Axlerod and Tom Whedon, although he also worked with other lyricists. Pottle graduated from Yale in 1955. At Yale he was president of the Yale Dramatic Association, and in 1954 he wrote the music for the Dramat's wildly successful original musical, \"Stover at Yale.\" His father was Frederick Pottle, Sterling Professor of English at Yale. He died on July 4, 1978 in New York City. His partner, writer Charles Choset dedicated the 1982 plays Letters to Ben and The Messiah to him. His remains were donated to medical science. ==Credits== ===Theatre=== All Kinds of Giants (off Broadway) (1961) book and lyrics by Tom Whedon Money a Musical Play for Cabaret (1963) with book and lyrics by David Axlerod and Tom Whedon The Mad Show (1966) Broadway theatre - conductor Keep Tightly Closed in a Cool Dry Place (La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, 1968) - composer Cry for Us All (Broadway, 1970) - musical supervisor *The Meehans (1977) - composer ===Television=== ====Sesame Street==== *Musical director *Composer **\"What's the Name of That Song?\" (with David Axlerod) - 1974 **\"City-Country Song\" (with Emily Kingsley) - 1974 **\"Mary Had a Bicycle\" (with David Korr) - 1974 **\"I Just Adore Four\" (with Joseph A.
