    "text": "Park Road 100 (PR 100) is a Park Road in the U.S. state of Texas. The highway is located in the Rio Grande Valley of the state in Cameron County. The highway runs along South Padre Island through the town of the same name. ==Route description== PR 100 begins at the Queen Isabella Causeway in Port Isabel, with the highway continuing west as State Highway 100. The 2.37 mile bridge crosses Laguna Madre and is the only road connecting South Padre Island to the mainland. After crossing Laguna Madre, the highway enters the town of South Padre Island and intersects itself near the Schlitterbahn water park and resort. The section of Park Road 100 south of this intersection acts as a spur for the southernmost part of the island. PR 100 runs north through the island/city, passing by many resorts, bars and restaurants. Just north of Edwin King Atwood Park the highway runs about half a mile between both the Laguna Madre and the Gulf of Mexico, before running only a few feet east of the former. The highway dead-ends shortly after entering into the Padre Island National Seashore. ==Junction list== ==References== 0100 Category:Transportation in Cameron County, Texas Category:1968 establishments in Texas ",
