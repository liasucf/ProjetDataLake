The category was initiated in 2016 alongside Outstanding Short Form Variety Series and Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series. The awards replaced the now-retired category for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program. These awards are not presented at the Primetime Emmy Awards show, but at the Creative Arts Emmy Award show. ==Winners and nominations== ===2010s=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"5%\" | Year ! width=\"25%\" | Program ! width=\"65%\" | Producers ! width=\"5%\" | Network |- | rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2016 (68th) |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Childrens Hospital | Rob Corddry, Jonathan Stern, David Wain, Keith Crofford and Mike Lazzo, executive producers; Krister Johnson, co-executive producer | Adult Swim |- | Fear the Walking Dead: Flight 462 |Troy Miller, Dave Erickson and David Wiener, executive producers; Tally Barr, producer | AMC |- | Hack Into Broad City |Abbi Jacobson, Ilana Glazer, Tony Hernandez and Lilly Burns, executive producers; Ryan McCormick, producer | ComedyCentral.com |- | Her Story |Katherine Reed Fisher, executive producer/producer; Eve Ensler, executive producer; Jen Richards and Laura Zak, co-executive producers | YouTube |- | UnREAL: The Auditions |Tamara Kaiser and Christian Martin, executive producers | Lifetime |- | rowspan=6 style=\"text- align:center\" | 2017 (69th) |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Los Pollos Hermanos Employee Training | Dan Appel, Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, Ariel Levine and Melissa Bernstein, executive producers; Rob Knox, producer | AMC |- | Brown Girls | Sam Bailey and Fatimah Asghar, producers | OpenTV |- | Fear the Walking Dead: Passage | Dave Erickson, Frank Scherma and Justin Wilkes, executive producers; Andrew Bernstein, producer | AMC.com |- | Hack Into Broad City |Abbi Jacobson, Ilana Glazer, Tony Hernandez and Lilly Burns, executive producers; Kelsie Kiley, producer | ComedyCentral.com |- | Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot | Geoffrey Colo, Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, Jeffrey Bell, Jeph Loeb and Joe Quesada, executive producers | ABCd / ABC.com |- | rowspan=6 style=\"text- align:center\" | 2018 (70th) |-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | James Corden's Next James Corden |Ben Winston, Rob Crabbe, James Corden, Adam Abramson, Ryan McKee, executive producers; David Lamattina, producer | CBS on Snapchat |- | aka Wyatt Cenac | Wyatt Cenac, executive producer; Chris Marsh and Daniel Goldberg, producers | Topic.com |- | An Emmy for Megan | Megan Amram, Dave Kneebone and Janel Kranking, executive producers; Joseph Carnegie, producer | anemmyformegan.com |- | Grey's Anatomy: B Team | Abby Chambers, executive producer; Val Cheung, producer; Produced by Mohamed Saad Mansoor | abc.go.com |- | The Walking Dead: Red Machete | Alex Coley Brown, Noam Dromi, Jay Williams, executive producers; Nick Bernardone and Avi Youabian, producers | AMC.com |- | rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2019 (71st) |-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | State of the Union In 2019, the AMC series Better Call Saul Employee Training: Madrigal Electromotive Security was nominated.
