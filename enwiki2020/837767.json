He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election on November 3, 1919 and served until 1926. ==Political career== Moore ran for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a provincial by-election held in the Cochrane electoral district on November 3, 1919. The by-election was called due to the death of speaker Charles Fisher. He defeated E.V. Thompson a candidate of the governing Liberals in a tough race. The Liberals attempted to win the by-election by having every member of the Cabinet and many back benches in the Liberal caucus campaign in the district. Moore was selected at a nomination meeting held on July 16, 1919, and campaigned in the district well before the writ was dropped. With Moore winning the by-election, he became the first member elected under the United Farmers banner, joining two farmer-friendly Non-Partisan League MLAs already in the legislature. Moore was re-elected in the 1921 Alberta general election. He served until 1926 before retiring. ==References== ==External links== *Legislative Assembly of Alberta Members Listing Category:1874 births Category:1952 deaths Category:United Farmers of Alberta MLAs ",
