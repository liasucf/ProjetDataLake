    "text": "Interleukin-29 (IL-29) is a cytokine and it belongs to type III interferons group, also termed interferons \u03bb (INF-\u03bb). IL-29 (alternative name INF\u03bb1) plays an important role in the immune response against pathogenes and especially against viruses by mechanisms similar to type I interferons, but targeting primarily cells of epithelial origin and hepatocytes. IL-29 is encoded by the INFL1 gene located on chromosome 19 in humans. It is a pseudogene in mice meaning the IL-29 protein is not produced in them. == Structure == IL-29 is, with the rest of INF-\u03bb, structurally related to the IL-10 family, but its primary amino acid sequence (and also function) is more similar to type I interferons. It binds to a heterodimeric receptor composed of one subunit INFL1R specific for INF-\u03bb and a second subunit IL10RB shared among the IL-10 family cytokines. == Function == === Effects on immune response to pathogenes === IL-29 exhibits antiviral effects by inducing similar signaling pathways as type I interferons. IL-29 receptor signals through JAK-STAT pathways leading to activated expression of interferon-stimulated genes and production of antiviral proteins. Further consequences of IL-29 signalization comprise the upregulated expression of MHC class I molecules, or enhanced expression of the costimulatory molecules and chemokine receptors on pDC, which are the main producers of INF-\u03b1. IL-29 expression is dominant in virus-infected epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, also in other musocal tissues and skin. Hepatocytes infected by HCV or HBV viruses stimulate the immune response by producing IL-29 (INF-\u03bb in general) rather than type I interferons. It is also produced by maturing macrophages, dendritic cells or mastocytes. It plays a role in defense against pathogens apart from viruses. It affects the function of both innate and adaptive immune system. Besides described antiviral effects, IL-29 modulates cytokine production of other cells, for example, it increases secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 by monocytes and macrophages, enhances the responsiveness of macrophages to IFN-\u03b3 by increased expression of IFNGR1, stimulates T cell polarization towards Th1 phenotype and also B cell response to IL-29 was reported. === Antitumor immunity === The impact of IL-29 on cancer cells is complicated and it depends on cancer cell type. It shows protective antitumor effects in many cases such as skin, lung, colorectal or hepatocellular cancer, but it was also reported its protumor effects on multiple myeloma cells. INF-\u03bb are considering as tool in cancer therapy with effects on more restricted cell types and fewer side-effects than type I interferons. === Autoimmune diseases === Abnormal expression of IL-29 could be involved in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune diseases by enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other autoimmune\u2010related components. High levels of IL-29 in serum or disease-specific tissue was observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic sclerosis and uveitis. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Interleukins Category:Cytokines Category:Immunology Category:Genes on human chromosome 19 ",
