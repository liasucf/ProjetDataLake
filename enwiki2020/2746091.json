It includes vocal contributions from Martin Barnard, Wendy Stubbs, and Helen White. \"Sometime Later\" peaked at number 91 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Critical reception== Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, describing it as \"a gently queasy blend of sounds and styles that manages to be tasteful and downright romantic without being airbrushed soul.\" He wrote: \"When the duo fully stretches its collage/sampling muscles, as on the title track, it can be quite breathtaking, a careful balance between chaos and atmospherics.\" Larry Flick of Billboard stated that the album \"combines the sample-happy experimental sound of the electronic underground with traditional pop sounds.\" Randall Roberts of CMJ New Music Monthly called it \"slow, deep, sexy nighttime music, so richly recorded and alive with pleasure that only the extremely sexually repressed could not feel it down there.\" ==Track listing== ; Samples *\"The April Fools\" by Percy Faith on My Things *\"What the World Needs Now Is Love\" by Burt Bacharach on Rain *\"My Autumn's Done Come\" (uncredited) by Lee Hazlewood on Sometime Later and Somewhere Not Here *\"Delaney Takes a Break\" by Michel Legrand on Delaney *\"Not the Lovin' Kind\" by Lee Hazlewood and \"Who Needs Forever\" by Astrud Gilberto (both uncredited) on Hazeldub *\"Plus Fort Que Nous\" by Francis Lai and \"Summertime\" by Memphis Slim on Slim *\"A House Is Not a Home\" by Ronnie Carroll and \"The Ghost's Leavetaking\" by Sylvia Plath on Back *\"The Hour of Enchantment\" by Ron Moody and \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" by Dusty Springfield on Nyquil *\"Courtyard\" by Bobbie Gentry on With *\"Save the Sunlight\" by Herb Alpert and Lani Hall on Firefly ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Corin Dingley \u2013 production, photography * Andy Jenks \u2013 production, photography * Wendy Stubbs \u2013 vocals (2, 9, 13) * Martin Barnard \u2013 vocals (3, 4, 8, 12) * Helen White \u2013 vocals (4, 6, 11) * Donald Skinner \u2013 instrumentation on additional loops * Alex Lee \u2013 instrumentation on additional loops * Angelo Bruschini \u2013 instrumentation on additional loops * Daniel Jones \u2013 strings score * Gavin Wright \u2013 strings conducting * Paul Hicks \u2013 strings overdub engineering * Alex Scannell \u2013 strings overdub engineering assistance * Andy Bradfield \u2013 mixing * Ben Findlay \u2013 mixing assistance, additional overdub engineering * Jacquie Turner \u2013 mixing assistance, additional overdub engineering * Russell Kearney \u2013 mixing assistance, additional overdub engineering * Marco Migliari \u2013 mixing assistance * Justin Griffith \u2013 mixing assistance * Emma Jones \u2013 mixing assistance * Kevin Metcalfe \u2013 mastering * Stephen Male \u2013 art direction * Latifah Cornelius \u2013 design * Jack Webb \u2013 photography * Donald Christie \u2013 photography ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1997 debut albums Category:Alpha (band) albums Category:Melankolic albums ",
