Gabriel Monod (7 March 1844 \u2013 10 April 1912) was a French historian, the nephew of Adolphe Monod. ==Biography== Born in Ingouville, Seine-Maritime, he was educated at Le Havre then went to Paris to complete his education, lodging with the de Pressens\u00e9 family. The influence of Edmond de Pressens\u00e9, a pastor and large-minded theologian, and of Madame de Pressens\u00e9, a woman of superior intellect and refined feeling, who devoted her life to educational works and charity, made a great impression on him. In 1865 he left the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, and went to Germany, where he studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and Humboldt University in Berlin. The teaching of Georg Waitz definitely directed his studies towards the history of the Middle Ages. Returning to France in 1868 he was nominated by Victor Duruy to give lectures on history, following the method used in German seminaries, at the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, Gabriel Monod, with his cousins Alfred and Sarah Monod, organized an ambulance with which he followed the whole campaign, from Sedan to Le Mans. He wrote a small book of memoirs of this campaign, Allemands et Fran\u00e7ais (1871), in which he spoke of the conquerors without bitterness; this attitude was all the more praiseworthy as his mother was originally from Alsace, and he was unable to resign himself to the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Coll\u00e8ge de France. Professor Gabriel Monod (Biblioth\u00e8que de la Sorbonne, NuBIS) The war being over he returned to teaching. At this period of his life he wrote Gr\u00e9goire de Tours et Marius d'Avenche (1872); Fr\u00e9d\u00e9gaire, whose history, taken from original manuscripts, he published in 1885; a translation of a book of W. Junghans, Histoire critique des r\u00e8gnes de Childerich et de Chlodovech, with introduction and notes (1879); \u00c9tudes critiques sur les sources de l'histoire carolingienne (1898, 1st part only published); and Bibliographie de l'histoire de France (1888). He himself said that his pupils were his best books; he intended to teach them not so much new facts as the way to study, endeavouring to develop in them an idea of criticism and truth. They showed their gratitude by dedicating a book to him in 1896, \u00c9tudes d'histoire du moyen \u00e2ge, and after his retirement in 1905 by having his features engraved on a slab (see \u00c0 Gabriel Monod, en souvenir de son enseignement: \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes, 1868\u20131905, \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, 1880-1904. 26 May 1907).
