    "text": "A Way with Words is an American weekly public radio program discussing the use of language (mainly American and Canadian English), with other languages earning more occasional mention) in everyday life, along with linguistics, lexicology and folk etymology from a pool of listener questions from weekly callers into the program, along with a weekly word game with quiz expert and comedian John Chaneski. The program is distributed mainly for weekend airing across member stations of NPR, utilizing the Public Radio Exchange for program distribution. That week's program is then distributed weekly as a podcast on Mondays. ==Background== left It was produced by KPBS-FM in San Diego from 1998 to 2007 and has since then been produced by Wayword, Inc. The show was originally hosted by authors Richard Lederer and Charles Harrington Elster. After five and a half years, Elster left the show and was replaced by journalist and writer Martha Barnette. In October 2006, Lederer announced his retirement from the show. He was replaced by writer and lexicographer Grant Barrett in January 2007. On August 2, 2007, KPBS-FM announced it would stop production of A Way with Words, saying it did not have enough experience or manpower to distribute a weekly program across North America. In September 2007, Martha Barnette and Grant Barrett, co-hosts of A Way with Words, along with the show's producer Stefanie Levine, announced the creation of Wayword, Inc., an independent production company that would continue series production, along with a further agreement where KPBS remained the program's flagship station. Wayword began to distribute the program with the November 24/25, 2007 episode. Its distribution has since increased five-fold across the nation under this arrangement. ==References== == External links == * Category:American talk radio programs Category:American public radio programs Category:1990s American radio programs Category:1998 radio programme debuts Category:2000s American radio programs Category:2010s American radio programs Category:Audio podcasts Category:English-language radio programs Category:American radio game shows Category:Educational podcasts ",
