It was released on October 3, 2006 by Geffen Records. ==Promotion== \"My Life\" was released on May 8, 2007 as the album's lead and only single. It is also featured in Bratz: The Movie and on its soundtrack. Music videos for \"Dance With Me\", \"The Texting Song\", \"Salsa\", \"Summer's Gone\", \"Make a Wish\", \"My Life\", \"I Got Your Back\", \"Carousel\", \"Back to Basics\", \"Good Times\", \"Countdown\", \"Bubblegum\" and \"Eavesdroppin'\" were produced to promote the album. They are currently available for purchase on iTunes. The group further promoted the album through live performances, mostly on Dance Revolution since they were the show's house band. All songs, except \"The Slumber Party Girls Theme\" and \"Dance Revolution Theme\", were performed on the show. They also made a guest appearance on The Early Show on the album's release date to promote it and performed \"Countdown\". During that special guest appearance, they spoke of a made-for-TV movie and television series in development, but due to the group's disbandment in the summer of 2007, those projects were cancelled. Despite heavy promotion on the album, It failed to chart on the Billboard 200 chart or any major chart and was a commercial failure. == Critical reception== The album earned mixed reviews from music critics. Marisa Brown of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, calling it \"With good beats and hooks, It's absolutely nothing that hasn't already been done a million times before, but for what it is, it's done pretty well\". However, Bullz-Eye.com's Jason Thompson panned the album. criticizing it's forgettable and disposable pop sound. He also noted that none of the songs were memorable, saying \"They\u2019re all as wretched and forgettable as you would imagine they are. There is nothing here even worth making fun of in a completely base way, it\u2019s that pointless\". He gave the album zero stars out of five. ==Track listing== #\"Countdown\" (Kura, Mazza, Ridel) \u2013 2:55 #\"The Texting Song (BTW, This is All 4 U)\" (Crawford, Ferguson, Mischle, Ridel) \u2013 2:56 #\"Bubblegum\" (Emmanuel, Fair, Martin, Ridel) \u2013 3:24 #\"Make a Wish\" (Fair, Munson, Ridel) \u2013 3:05 #\"Good Times\" (Crawford, Ferguson, Louriano, Ridel) \u2013 2:51 #\"I Got Your Back\" (Crawford, Fair, Ferguson, Louriano, Ridel) \u2013 3:29 #\"My Life\" (Harris, Mazza, Ridel) \u2013 2:50 #\"Dance with Me\" (Fair, Mischke, Munson, Ridel) \u2013 2:44 #\"Carousel\" (Fair, Ridel, Scapa) \u2013 3:26 #\"Salsa\" (Harris, Mazza, Ridel, Sandstrom) \u2013 3:15 #\"Summer's Gone\" (Fair, Modesto, Ridel, Sheth) \u2013 2:57 #\"Eavesdropping\" (Brucculeri, Fair, Hidalgo, Kelley, Pascal, Ridel) \u2013 3:34 #\"Back to Basics\" (Fair, Hendricks, Ridel) \u2013 2:46 #\"The Slumber Party Girls Theme\" (bonus track) (Fair, Ridel) \u2013 1:12 #\"Dance Revolution Theme\" (bonus track) (Fair, Ridel) \u2013 2:36 == Personnel == *Charlie Bisharat \u2013 Violin (Electric) *David Brookwell \u2013 Executive Producer *Christian Brucculeri \u2013 Producer *Anthony Caruso \u2013 Assistant Engineer *Luis Conte \u2013 Percussion *Tyler Coomes \u2013 Drum Programming *Drop Squad \u2013 Producer *John Easton \u2013 Producer *Mike \"Angry\" Eleopoulos \u2013 Engineer *Colin Emmanuel \u2013 Producer *Ron Fair \u2013 Harmonica, Percussion, Arranger, Keyboards, Programming, Producer, Executive Producer, Vocal Arrangement, Mixing, Slide Whistle, Toy Piano *Deb Fenstermacher \u2013 Marketing *Gary Grant \u2013 Horn *Bernie Grundman \u2013 Mastering *Ron Harris \u2013 Keyboards, Producer *Ron Harris \u2013 Bass *Hylah Hedgepeth \u2013 Artist Coordination *Kyle Hendricks \"Rain\" \u2013 Producer *Tal Herzberg \u2013 Bass, Producer, Digital Editing *Jerry Hey \u2013 Horn, Horn Arrangements *Andy Heyward \u2013 Executive Producer *Dan Higgins \u2013 Horn *Jun Ishizeki \u2013 Engineer *Judy \u2013 Stylist *Carlene K \u2013 Make-Up *Kimberly Kelley \u2013 Guitar, Producer *Gelly Kusuma \u2013 Assistant Engineer *Mike Maliani \u2013 Executive Producer *John Marx \u2013 Representation *Anthony Mazza \u2013 Guitar, Producer *Sean McNamara \u2013 Executive Producer *Moises Modesto \u2013 Producer *Peter Mokran \u2013 Mixing *Dean Nelson \u2013 Mixing Assistant *Sheryl Nields \u2013 Photography *Jeff Norskog \u2013 Management *Dave Pensado \u2013 Mixing *Jack Joseph Puig \u2013 Mixing *Bill Reichenbach Jr. \u2013 Horn *Stefanie Ridel \u2013 Producer, Executive Producer, Vocal Arrangement *Sammy \u2013 Stylist *Nicky Scapa \u2013 Producer *Ashish Sheth \u2013 Producer *Justin Siegel \u2013 A&R; *Sabrina Sweet \u2013 Make-Up *Michelle Thomas \u2013 Marketing *Eric Weaver \u2013 Mixing Assistant ==References== * Category:2006 debut albums Category:Slumber Party Girls albums Category:Albums produced by Ron Fair ",
