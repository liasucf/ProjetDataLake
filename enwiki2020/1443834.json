    "text": "Newark Liberty International Airport Station (also known as Newark International Airport Station and the Rail Link station) is a railroad station on the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in Newark, New Jersey. The station provides access to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) via the AirTrain monorail which connects the station to the airport's terminals and parking areas. It is served by New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line and Amtrak's Northeast Regional and Keystone Service trains. The station, located in the Dayton neighborhood of the city, has no pedestrian access, bus service, parking facility, or drop-off area. ==History== An Amtrak Northeast Regional train at the station in 2007 The station opened on October 21, 2001. It is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), the airport's operator, and therefore has a different design than NJT and Amtrak stations, especially the signage, which is the same as used throughout the airport. The Port Authority originally intended to name the station \"Newark Airport\" but changed it to \"Newark Liberty International Airport\" after the airport's renaming, which honors the victims of the September 11 attacks and the proximity of the airport to the Statue of Liberty. ==Station layout and service== ===Northeast Corridor=== On the NEC, it is a 6-minute trip to Newark's Penn Station, where connections are available to the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) system to Jersey City, Hoboken and Lower Manhattan as well as the Newark Light Rail and regional bus services. New York City's Penn Station, where connections are available to Long Island Rail Road and the New York City Subway, is a 22-to-25-minute trip. Trenton is a 31-to-50-minute trip and Philadelphia is a 59-to-67-minute trip. NJT local trains stop at Secaucus Junction, where connections are available to other New Jersey Transit Rail Operations commuter lines in northern New Jersey and Metro-North Railroad's West of Hudson services. ===AirTrain Newark=== Passengers connecting between the Northeast Corridor and AirTrain Newark must pass through faregates and pay a fee. This fee is usually included in the ticket price and encoded on magnetic stripes of NJT tickets with the station as the origin or destination (denoted with **EWR**). Monthly pass holders who do not have Newark Airport as the origin or destination for their pass need to pay the fee, which is waived for children 11 and under. There is a staffed Amtrak ticket counter between AirTrain and the NEC platforms. Although there are NJ Transit staff on site, passengers are required to use the ticket vending machines (TVMs) on either side of the faregates for NJT service. ===Platform layout=== NJ Transit trains typically stop on the outer platform tracks, while Amtrak trains typically stop on the inner platform tracks. The two center tracks, which do not serve the station, are often used by express NJ Transit trains, as well as Amtrak service that does not stop here (the Acela Express, some Northeast Regional, most Keystone trains, and all long- distance services). {|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=75|M |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=550|Connection between Northeast Corridor and AirTrain |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=8|P NEC platforms |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 5 |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward Rahway, Jersey Avenue or Trenton (North Elizabeth or ) \u2190 toward South Amboy, Long Branch or Bay Head (North Elizabeth or ) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 4 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward Northern Virginia (Metropark) \u2190 limited service toward Harrisburg (Metropark) |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 PM express service does not stop here \u2190 PM express service does not stop here \u2190 services do not stop here |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 2 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| services do not stop here \u2192 AM express service does not stop here \u2192 AM express service does not stop here \u2192 |- |Track 1 | limited service toward New York (Newark Penn Station) \u2192 toward Boston (Newark Penn Station) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track A |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| toward New York (Newark Penn Station) \u2192 toward Hoboken or New York (Newark Penn Station) \u2192 |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=2| |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|No service |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 No passenger service \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|No service |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 No passenger service \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=3|P AirTrain platforms |Track 2 |\u2190 toward Terminals (Parking Lot 4) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 1 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward Terminals (Parking Lot 4) |} ==PATH extension proposal== In September 2012, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that work would commence on a study to explore extending the PATH system to the station. The new station would be located at ground level to the west of the existing NJ Transit station. A storage yard for PATH trains would also be built. There would be a park and ride facility at the stop, with a new entrance to the surrounding Dayton neighborhood, and an overpass to the existing NJ Transit and AirTrain platforms. In 2014, the PANYNJ proposed a 10-year capital plan that included the PATH extension, which was approved by the Board of Commissioners on February 19 of that year. However, in late 2014, there were calls for reconsideration of Port Authority funding priorities. The PATH extension followed the route of existing Manhattan-to-Newark Airport train service , while there was no funding for either the Gateway Tunnel under the Hudson River, or the replacement of the aging and overcrowded Port Authority Bus Terminal. On January 11, 2017, the PANYNJ released its 10-year capital plan that included $1.7 billion for the extension. Under the plan, construction is projected to start in 2020, with service in 2026. Two public meetings on the project were scheduled for early December 2017. ==References== ==External links== *Newark Airport Amtrak & New Jersey Transit Station (USA RailGuide -- TrainWeb) *Newark-Airport, NJ (EWR) (Amtrak's Great American Stations) Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations Category:Amtrak stations in New Jersey Category:PATH stations in New Jersey Category:Stations on the Northeast Corridor Category:Port Authority of New York and New Jersey AirTrain Category:Newark Liberty International Airport Category:Transportation in Newark, New Jersey Category:Airport railway stations in the United States Category:Railway stations in Essex County, New Jersey Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2001 ",
