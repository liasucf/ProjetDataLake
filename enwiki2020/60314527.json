The church was designed by Spanish-Mexican architect, F\u00e9lix Candela and constructed between 1953 and 1955. The monks who had commissioned the project favored a Gothic building and reportedly did not realize the design's modern style until after construction had started. == References == Category:F\u00e9lix Candela buildings Category:Churches in Mexico City Category:Churches completed in 1955 ",
