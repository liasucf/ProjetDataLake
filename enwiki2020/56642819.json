    "text": "The Union of Women Painters and Sculptors (Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs) was founded in 1881 in Paris as a society for the promotion of female artists. The Union was founded by sculptor and educator H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bertaux (Mme. Leon Bertaux) and had as many as 450 members at its peak. Noted members include Virginie Demont-Breton, who became president after Bertaux in 1894, and artist Marie Bashkirtseff. In the Studio by Union member Marie Bashkirtseff (1881) Opportunities for women within the Parisian art world in the 19th century were limited. The influential \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts did not begin admitting women until 1897. Prior to that year, the only state-sponsored option for women\u2019s art education was the National School of Drawing for Young Women (\u00c9cole Nationale de Dessin pour les Jeune Filles), which received less funding than men\u2019s schools. Additionally, women were prohibited from joining many other existing exhibition groups, schools, and public art spaces. The Union\u2019s goals were to create a community to educate and support female artists and by displaying their work. They published the Journal des femmes artistes newsletter, where members of the Union could communicate and comment. They also founded and organized the annual Salon des Femmes as an exhibition of women\u2019s art exclusively. The Salon was intended to be a non-traditional and non-hierarchical exhibition, including decorative arts and giving new and established artists equal access to preferred hanging spaces. The first Salon des Femmes occurred in January 1882, and the Union continued to organize and publicize the event eachyear. At the 1896 Salon des Femmes, 295 women exhibited their work. In addition to these efforts, members of the Union, especially Bertaux, campaigned for women\u2019s entry into the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and for their eligibility to compete for the Prix de Rome art prize. == References == Category:Women and the arts ",
