    "text": "In convex analysis, a non-negative function is logarithmically concave (or log-concave for short) if its domain is a convex set, and if it satisfies the inequality : f(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y) \\geq f(x)^{\\theta} f(y)^{1 - \\theta} for all and . If is strictly positive, this is equivalent to saying that the logarithm of the function, , is concave; that is, : \\log f(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y) \\geq \\theta \\log f(x) + (1-\\theta) \\log f(y) for all and . Examples of log-concave functions are the 0-1 indicator functions of convex sets (which requires the more flexible definition), and the Gaussian function. Similarly, a function is log-convex if it satisfies the reverse inequality : f(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y) \\leq f(x)^{\\theta} f(y)^{1 - \\theta} for all and . ==Properties== * A log-concave function is also quasi-concave. This follows from the fact that the logarithm is monotone implying that the superlevel sets of this function are convex. * Every concave function that is nonnegative on its domain is log-concave. However, the reverse does not necessarily hold. An example is the Gaussian function = which is log-concave since = is a concave function of . But is not concave since the second derivative is positive for || > 1: ::f(x)=e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} (x^2-1) leq 0 * From above two points, concavity \\Rightarrow log-concavity \\Rightarrow quasiconcavity. * A twice differentiable, nonnegative function with a convex domain is log- concave if and only if for all satisfying , ::f(x) abla^2f(x) \\preceq abla f(x) abla f(x)^T, :i.e. ::f(x) abla^2f(x) - abla f(x) abla f(x)^T is :negative semi-definite. For functions of one variable, this condition simplifies to ::f(x)f(x) \\leq (f'(x))^2 ==Operations preserving log- concavity== * Products: The product of log-concave functions is also log- concave. Indeed, if and are log-concave functions, then and are concave by definition. Therefore ::\\log\\,f(x) + \\log\\,g(x) = \\log(f(x)g(x)) :is concave, and hence also is log-concave. * Marginals: if : is log-concave, then ::g(x)=\\int f(x,y) dy :is log-concave (see Pr\u00e9kopa\u2013Leindler inequality). * This implies that convolution preserves log-concavity, since = is log- concave if and are log-concave, and therefore ::(f*g)(x)=\\int f(x-y)g(y) dy = \\int h(x,y) dy :is log-concave. ==Log-concave distributions== Log-concave distributions are necessary for a number of algorithms, e.g. adaptive rejection sampling. Every distribution with log-concave density is a maximum entropy probability distribution with specified mean \u03bc and Deviation risk measure D. As it happens, many common probability distributions are log- concave. Some examples:See *The normal distribution and multivariate normal distributions. *The exponential distribution. *The uniform distribution over any convex set. *The logistic distribution. *The extreme value distribution. *The Laplace distribution. *The chi distribution. *The hyperbolic secant distribution. *The Wishart distribution, where n >= p + 1. *The Dirichlet distribution, where all parameters are >= 1. *The gamma distribution if the shape parameter is >= 1. *The chi-square distribution if the number of degrees of freedom is >= 2. *The beta distribution if both shape parameters are >= 1. *The Weibull distribution if the shape parameter is >= 1. Note that all of the parameter restrictions have the same basic source: The exponent of non- negative quantity must be non-negative in order for the function to be log- concave. The following distributions are non-log-concave for all parameters: *The Student's t-distribution. *The Cauchy distribution. *The Pareto distribution. *The log-normal distribution. *The F-distribution. Note that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of all log-concave distributions is also log-concave. However, some non-log-concave distributions also have log- concave CDF's: *The log-normal distribution. *The Pareto distribution. *The Weibull distribution when the shape parameter < 1\\. *The gamma distribution when the shape parameter < 1\\. The following are among the properties of log- concave distributions: *If a density is log-concave, so is its cumulative distribution function (CDF). *If a multivariate density is log-concave, so is the marginal density over any subset of variables. *The sum of two independent log-concave random variables is log-concave. This follows from the fact that the convolution of two log-concave functions is log-concave. *The product of two log-concave functions is log-concave. This means that joint densities formed by multiplying two probability densities (e.g. the normal-gamma distribution, which always has a shape parameter >= 1) will be log-concave. This property is heavily used in general-purpose Gibbs sampling programs such as BUGS and JAGS, which are thereby able to use adaptive rejection sampling over a wide variety of conditional distributions derived from the product of other distributions. ==See also== *logarithmically concave sequence *logarithmically concave measure *logarithmically convex function *convex function ==Notes== ==References== * * * * Category:Mathematical analysis Category:Convex analysis ",
