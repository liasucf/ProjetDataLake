    "text": "Acaste is a genus of extinct trilobite of the order Phacopida which lived throughout the Silurian period. They are characterized by a convex dorsal surface, an absence of spines, a shortening of the head-shield and a general rounding off of all angles.H H Swinnerton - Outlines of Palaentology, Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd, 1972 (p. 247) . Species include Acaste downingiae British Palaeozoic Fossils - Natural History Museum 4th edition 1975. Plate 29. . (Wenlock Series). == Etymology == * A. lokii is named after Loki, the Norse god of mischief. Loki tricked the blind god H\u00f6\u00f0r to kill the god of beauty Baldr, and so started the demise of the world (or Ragnar\u00f6k). This epithet was chosen by Edgecombe because it is based on the cephalon of A. longisulcata, which has turned out to be a mixed collection. The pygidium of A. longisulcata belongs to a Phacopoidea. * A. zerinae is named in honor of Zerina Edgecombe, the wife of the species author. == Taxonomy == === Species previously assigned to Acaste === Some species originally designated to Acaste have now been reassigned to other genera. * A. birminghamensis = Llandovacaste birminghamensis * A. constrictus = Acastoides constricta * A. cordobesa = Pennaia verneuili * A. henni = Acastoides henni * A. verneuili = Calmonia terrarocenai ==References== ==See also== *List of trilobites Category:Acastidae Category:Phacopida genera Category:Silurian trilobites Category:Trilobites of Africa Category:Trilobites of Oceania Category:Silurian first appearances Category:Early Devonian genus extinctions Category:Wenlock series fossils ",
