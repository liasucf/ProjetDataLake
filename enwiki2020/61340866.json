It is written by and adapted from the Argentine telenovela Amar despu\u00e9s de amar. The telenovela premiered on June 17, 2019 and ended on September 13, 2019. == Plot == \u00abAmar Depois de Amar\u00bb tells the story of four great passions and the crime they unleash between the Macedo family and the Oliveira family. Raquel Macedo (Maria Jo\u00e3o Pinho) and Gon\u00e7alo Macedo (Pedro Lima) are happy, have been married for 20 years and have two twin sons: Frederico (Gon\u00e7alo Norton) and Alice (Catarina Rebelo). Gon\u00e7alo is a majority partner in an oyster nursery company and a fish and seafood distribution factory. Rich heir, disputes control of the company with his cousin and minority partner, Andr\u00e9, who blackmails and swindles him. Gon\u00e7alo's mother, Matilde (Helena Isabel), always disregarded her daughter-in-law for her lightness of mind and carelessness. When Gon\u00e7alo has an accident that puts him in a coma, Matilde will do his best to \"get rid of\" her and to take control of the family business. Marina Oliveira (Dina F\u00e9lix da Costa) and Augusto Oliveira (Filipe Vargas), also married for 20 years, have two teenage children: Catarina (Carolina Frias) and Nicolau (Bernardo Lobo Faria). In keeping with the family harmony that they both cherish, the couple have been trying to forget about their professional frustrations: Augusto is a contractor but would like to be a PJ inspector, as he had been before, and Marina wanted to be a ballroom dancer - where she had a future, above all, as a tango dancer - an activity she abandoned because of her children. She will still have a third child \u201cout of time\u201d, which will prevent her from starting over at a later age. The two couples know each other and, initially against the wishes of Augusto, whom Gon\u00e7alo's wealth bothers, and Gon\u00e7alo, whom the intimacy between Raquel and Marina bothers, become inseparable friends. Raquel finds in Marina her missing friend, but Gon\u00e7alo will also find in her an overwhelming and corresponding passion. The love between the two, which they both believe to be an absolute secret, will come to light when they suffer an attack and a car accident. Marina dies and Gon\u00e7alo is in a coma. A police investigation is born here that leads us to meet almost every character. As it turns out, they could all have reason to have committed this crime because, after all, they all knew more about that passion than they let on - Alice and Nicholas; Xavier (Pompeu Jos\u00e9), compadre of Augustus; Aurora (Sofia Nicholson), factory employee, and especially Andr\u00e9 (Nuno Pardal), Gon\u00e7alo's sinister cousin. Judiciary Police inspector Miguel Meireles (Pedro Teixeira) will play a leading role in this investigation in which he invests everything, also, to try to cheer up his wife, Laura Meireles (Fernanda Serrano) who, above all , wants to be a mother without success, and is dedicated to writing a new crime-inspired fiction that hits Marina and Gon\u00e7alo. Laura's involvement in this inquiry will go far beyond what is advisable and thus endanger her life and put her marriage at risk. ==Cast== === Main === * Maria Jo\u00e3o Pinho - Raquel Macedo * Pedro Lima - Gon\u00e7alo Macedo * Filipe Vargas - Augusto Oliveira * Dina F\u00e9lix da Costa - Marina Oliveira * Fernanda Serrano - Laura Meireles * Pedro Teixeira - Miguel Meireles ===Secondary=== * Helena Isabel - Matilde Macedo * Catarina Rebelo - Alice Macedo * Gon\u00e7alo Norton - Frederico Macedo * Nuno Pardal - Andr\u00e9 Macedo * Carolina Frias - Catarina Oliveira * Bernardo Lobo Faria - Nicolau Oliveira * Ana Varela - Sara Sousa * Teresa Faria - J\u00falia Campos * Diogo Lopes - Jo\u00e3o Paulo Nunes * Sofia Nicholson - Aurora Justo * Dinarte Branco - Vicente Barrigoto * Isabel Figueira - Lu\u00edsa Barrigoto * Teresa Tavares - Aline Matias * Lu\u00eds Esparteiro - Ant\u00f3nio Gouveia * Pedro Almendra - \u00c2ngelo Severino * Tom\u00e1s Alves - Kevin Silva * Jo\u00e3o Lagarto - Joaquim Zorra * Rodrigo Trindade - Sebasti\u00e3o Gaio * Pompeu Jos\u00e9 - Jos\u00e9 Emanuel Xavier * Jo\u00e3o Didelet - Joaquim Jos\u00e9 \u00abQuim Z\u00e9\u00bb Rodrigues * Vicente Wallenstein - Manuel \u00abMan\u00e9\u00bb Ant\u00f3nio dos Santos ==References== Category:Portuguese telenovelas Category:Televis\u00e3o Independente telenovelas Category:2019 Portuguese television series debuts Category:2019 Portuguese television series endings Category:2019 telenovelas Category:Portuguese-language telenovelas ",
