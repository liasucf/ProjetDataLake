    "text": "Ko 2 (English: King 2) is a 2016 Indian Tamil political thriller film co- written and directed by Sarath, who earlier worked as associate director/ screenplay writer for films like Unnaipol Oruvan and Billa 2. The film is being produced by Elred Kumar and features Bobby Simha and Nikki Galrani in the leading roles, while Prakash Raj reprises his role from the first film. Bala Saravanan, Ilavarasu, and John Vijay play supporting roles. The music was composed by Leon James with editing by Richard Kevin. This film is a remake of the 2014 Telugu political thriller film Prathinidhi, starring Nara Rohit. A stand-alone sequel to the successful 2011 film Ko, the film was planned to release in April 2016 but released on 13 May 2016. ==Plot== A common man named Kumaran (Bobby Simha) kidnaps the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Yogeeswaran (Prakash Raj), at a private old age home event in Chennai. The news goes viral, and everyone from the local to the central cabinet starts taking the issue personally. Home Minister Thillainayagam (Ilavarasu) appoints Santhanapandian (John Vijay), the Police Commissioner of Tirunelveli, to rescue Yogeeswaran. Santhanapandian questions Bala (Bala Saravanan), a minister's son who was discovered unconscious at the scene of the kidnapping. Bala tells that he and Kumaran had become friends when Kumaran had saved him from a group of thugs, but they are shocked to see that they both of them love the same girl - Priyadharshini (Nikki Galrani). Bala also reveals that Kumaran willingly allowed him to pursue his relationship with Priyadharshini in exchange for making arrangements for Yogeeswaran to attend the old age home event. Meanwhile, as Santhanapandian and his deputy, ACP Arivazhagan (Bharath Reddy), strive to get clues about Kumaran, Kumaran explains to Yogeeswaran his motive for kidnapping him. Kumaran was an orphan, but due to the efforts of an honest politician named Kumaraswamy (Nassar), who had sponsored him, he got a good education and became a journalist with the News7 TV channel. When he went to Kumaraswamy's house to thank him for his contribution to his life, he found out that Kumaraswamy had gone missing for many days. On further investigation, he learned that Kumaraswamy had been buried alive by Thillainayagam and his sons Kishore (Shan) and Prathap. Thillainayagam had contested against Kumaraswamy in the last election and had defeated him by rigging the vote, which forced Kumaraswamy to file a case against him and demand a recount. When Kumaraswamy refused to withdraw the case against him, Thillainayagam and his sons buried him alive. Kumaran then filed a case against Thillainayagam and asked Kumaraswamy's intellectually disabled son, also named Kumaran (Karunakaran), who was unaware that his father had been killed, to give the statement to the police inspector. However, the police inspector was Thillainayagam's aide and informed him about Kumaran. Thillainayagam's sons then took Kumaran on a bus and pushed him out en route. He was then run over by a lorry and died. In order to avenge the deaths of Kumaraswamy and his son, Kumaran hatched a plan with Priyadharshini and Bala to kidnap Yogeeswaran in order to expose Thillainayagam slowly through false media reports based on false replies by Bala while being interrogated by the police. In the process, Thillainayagam's sons are taken into questioning. After being tortured, they eventually give in and expose Thillainayagam as Kumaraswamy's murderer, even giving them the location in Thillainayagam's lawn where Kumaraswamy was buried. Thillainayagam is arrested, and Kumaran releases Yogeeswaran. Kumaran also escapes from his hideout and poses as a journalist, while Yogeeswaran says that he cannot identify the kidnapper. Even Santhanapandian gives up on pursuing the kidnapper as the latter had kidnapped Yogeeswaran with good intentions. ==Cast== * Bobby Simha as Kumaran, a man who kidnaps Yogeeswaran in order to expose Thillainayagam * Prakash Raj as Chief Minister Yogeeswaran, who gets kidnapped by Kumaran while attending an old age home event * Nikki Galrani as Priyadharshini, a woman whom both Kumaran and Bala love but whom Kumaran sacrifices his love for * Bala Saravanan as Bala, Kumaran's friend who helps him kidnap Yogeeswaran * Ilavarasu as Home Minister Thillainayagam, the antagonist who wins an election unfairly and kills Kumaraswamy * John Vijay as Police Commissioner Santhanapandian, a man appointed by Thillainayagam to rescue Yogeeswaran * Nassar as Kumaraswamy, an honest politician who sponsors Kumaran but gets killed in the hands of Thillainayagam and his sons * Karunakaran as Kumaran, Kumaraswamy's son who did not know about his father's death but dies after getting run over by a lorry * Bharath Reddy as ACP Arivazhagan, Santhanapandian's deputy * Shan as Kishore, Thillainayagam's son * Reshma Pasupuleti as Deepa * Mayilsamy as Yogeeswaran's party volunteer * Crane Manohar as Yogeeswaran's party volunteer * Gowtham * Ravi Venkatraman ==Production== Following the success of Ko (2011) directed by K.
