    "text": "Aleksandar \u0110uri\u0107 (; born 12 August 1970) is a former professional footballer. He is currently a Principal for Sport Singapore and ActiveSG Football Academy and has played in the Singapore Cosmopolitan Football League, a top amateur football league in Singapore for SCC First prior to his retirement from professional football. He was noted for being a prolific striker with strong physical presence. His professional approach to his fitness and a disciplined lifestyle contributed to extending a career spanning over three decades. \u0110uri\u0107 was junior kayaking champion of Yugoslavia when he was 15 and was ranked 8th in the world at 17. He represented Bosnia and Herzegovina in the C-1 500m canoeing event the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the Olympics, he returned to Hungary to resume his football career. In 1999, he signed for Tanjong Pagar United in the S.League where he was converted to a striker for the first time in his career. He won trophies with subsequent clubs Home United, Geylang United, Singapore Armed Forces and Tampines Rovers. He won eight league titles and three Singapore Cups in 16 seasons, amassing three Player of the Year and four top scorer awards on the way to becoming the league's all-time top scorer. At international level, he debuted for Singapore at the age of 37 years in 2007. He became the first foreign-born player to start a match as captain in May 2008. He was in the Singapore squad for the AFF Championship in 2008, 2010 and 2012, the latter of which Singapore won. He retired from international football in December 2012 with a record of 24 goals in 53 matches. In 2013, he assumed his new duties as full-time fitness coach at his club Tampines Rovers. He retired from his playing career at the age of 44 in November 2014. == Early life == Aleksandar \u0110uri\u0107 was born in Lipac on the outskirts of Doboj, in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The childhood supporter of Red Star Belgrade spent his formative years in the youth teams of his hometown club FK Sloga Doboj as a goalkeeper and later, as a midfielder. He also took up kayaking at the age of 12 on the advice of the doctor treating his growth disorder of the chest. He became junior kayaking champion of Yugoslavia when he was 15 and by age 17, he was ranked 8th in the world. \u0110uri\u0107 was drafted into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) at the age of 17, and became an officer during his service. With the impending Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. \u0110uri\u0107 recalls: \"My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don\u2019t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child.\" With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, \u0110uri\u0107 left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The break-up of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league. === 1992 Summer Olympics === In 1992, \u0110uri\u0107 received an invitation from the newly formed Bosnian Olympic Committee to compete for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the C-1 500 m canoeing event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Despite not having trained for two years and the ongoing conflict between the Serbs and the Bosniaks, he accepted the request as he ultimately decided he was first and foremost a sportsman. As the Bosnian Olympic Committee could not afford to pay for his travel, he had to hitch-hike his way over to Barcelona. With only a letter from the Olympic Committee and no valid passport, he managed to get a truck ride to the Austrian border but was initially refused passage by a disbelieving immigration officer who thought he was a refugee seeking asylum. After convincing them of his credentials with a phone call to the Olympic Committee, the border guards helped him persuade someone to take him half-way to Slovenia, where he managed to get another ride to the airport and flew to Barcelona. A two-day trek later, he made it to the Summer Olympics where he was one of Bosnia's ten debuting competitors. He had to borrow equipment from the Italian and Spanish teams to complete in the event and was eliminated in the repechages. After the Olympics, he resumed his football career with Szeged LC. == Club career == === Australia === An associate of \u0110uri\u0107 helped to arrange for a trial in Australia with Frank Arok, a retired Serbian footballer of Hungarian descent and former Australia coach. In 1994, he moved to South Melbourne Hellas in the National Soccer League where he played as a defender. He also played for other Australian clubs such as Port Melbourne Sharks, Gippsland Falcons, Heidelberg United, West Adelaide and had a brief stint with Chinese side Locomotive Shanshan in 1997. In 1999, \u0110uri\u0107\u2019s club West Adelaide went bankrupt. He received offers from Hong Kong and Singapore but chose to move to the latter where he began his S.League career with Tanjong Pagar United. At this stage of his career, he had been playing on the left flank as a winger or left-back. His coach Tohari Paijan converted the 6'4\" player into a striker. He scored 11 goals in 16 league matches as the club finished third. \u0110uri\u0107 returned to Australia at the end of the season and obtained Australian citizenship in the hope of representing the Socceroos. He played for Sydney- based Marconi Stallions, reverting to his left midfield position. In June 2000, \u0110uri\u0107 moved permanently to Singapore with Home United, playing as a striker again. He scored 11 goals in all competitions for his new club as he won the 2000 Singapore Cup in front of a 45,000 crowd at the National Stadium. He was released by the club at the end of the season. === Geylang United === In 2001, \u0110uri\u0107 signed on with Geylang United where he formed a strong understanding with forward Mohd Noor Ali, a partnership they would later replicate at Singapore Armed Forces and credit with creating \"at least half of all my goals\". Geylang won their first S.League title in five years after defeating Jurong in the final matchday, with \u0110uri\u0107 scoring 37 goals that season. Geylang played Home United in the 2001 Singapore Cup final. Home United led 4\u20130 at half-time as \u0110uri\u0107 and playmaker Brian Bothwell came off with injuries. Defender Noh Rahman was withdrawn after injuring his knee ligament and Noor Ali was sent off as 9-men Geylang lost with a final score of 8\u20130. Despite coach Jang Jung stating in a post-match interview that \u0110uri\u0107 would be leaving the club with seven other players, he signed a three-year contract extension and went on to score 97 goals in 126 league games over four seasons. In 2003, he joined an exclusive club of S.League players who had scored 100 domestic goals. With the success of the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, the AFC revamped their continental competition by introducing the AFC Champions League and the AFC Cup. Geylang as 2001 S.League winners participated in the 2002\u201303 AFC Champions League qualification. They were drawn against DPMM in the second round of the Eastern qualifying zone; \u0110uri\u0107 scored once in the home leg and twice in the away leg as Geylang progressed 7\u20130 on aggregate. They met Chinese Jia-A League club Shanghai Shenhua in the final qualifying stage, exiting 5\u20131 on aggregate with \u0110uri\u0107 scoring a goal in the second leg. Geylang entered the inaugural AFC Cup as 2003 S.League runners-up. \u0110uri\u0107 scored in both legs of the quarter-finals as Geylang United knocked Perak out of the competition. He scored a total of five goals in the competition as Geylang made the semi-finals, missing out on the finals with a 1\u20130 defeat to Al-Wahda in the second leg after a 1\u20131 draw in the away leg. === Singapore Armed Forces === \u0110uri\u0107 signed for Singapore Armed Forces in November 2004. The Warriors won the league four times, achieving the S.League and Singapore Cup double in 2007 and 2008 as he finished league top- scorer three times in 2007, 2008 and 2009. \u0110uri\u0107 scored 129 goals in 150 league appearances with the club. His prolific form was recognised with the S.League Player of the Year award in 2007 and 2008. He scored his 200th domestic goal with a 5-minute hat-trick over Liaoning Guangyuan on 9 July 2007. and broke Mirko Grabovac's league record of 244 goals in local competitions with two goals in a 2\u20132 draw with ex-club Geylang United on his 38th birthday. The club also defeated Home United 5\u20134 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time in the 2008 Charity Shield. In 2009, Singapore Armed Forces became the first Singapore club to advance to the AFC Champions League after defeating PEA and PSMS Medan in the play-offs. They were drawn against Kashima Antlers, Suwon Samsung Bluewings and Shanghai Shenghua for the group stage. \u0110uri\u0107 scored a goal in the match against Suwon Bluewings on 19 May 2009. The club failed to make it to the next round, ending bottom of the group with five losses and a draw. In September 2009, \u0110uric agreed to join Sriwijaya of the Indonesian Super League for a reported US$110,000 a season contract. However, a month later, he told the press that he declined the offer in the end because Sriwijaya tried to change the terms of the contract which was mutually agreed upon. === Tampines Rovers === \u0110uric's relationship with Singapore Armed Forces had been damaged with his attempted transfer to Sriwijaya. Following their decision not to offer him a new contract, he signed for Tampines Rovers in 2010. He scored 20 league goals in his first season there as the club finished in second place. He clinched three consecutive S.League titles with Tampines Rovers from 2011 to 2013, and four Charity Shield honours from 2011 to 2014. He became the first player to reach a milestone 300th goal on 27 September 2010 with two goals against Balestier Khalsa in the Singapore Cup. With 328 goals in 444 top division club appearances, \u0110uric was ranked by IFFHS as the world top scorer in July 2011. He picked up his third Player of the Year award in 2012 and finished joint league top-scorer with Moon Soon-Ho in 2013. \u0110uri\u0107 announced his decision to quit professional football at the end of the 2014 season, having been convinced by the club management to postpone his initial plans to retire at the end of 2012. He started the season having scored a record 378 domestic goals. Tampines failed to reach the 2014 AFC Champions League after losing to South China at the first qualifying round. The club dropped into the 2014 AFC Cup accordingly, and was eventually eliminated in the group stage. He ended the season with eight goals in 35 appearances across all competitions as Tampines finished third in the league. \u0110uri\u0107 retired from his playing career after his final match in a 2\u20131 loss to Brunei DPMM in the Singapore Cup third- place play-off match on 5 November 2014. == Return to Amateur Football == \u0110uri\u0107 returns to competitive football in 2017 where he joined Singapore Cricket Club and took part in Cosmopolitan Football League, simply known as CosmoLeague which is a top amateur football league in Singapore. == International career == It took \u0110uri\u0107 three personal attempts before he received his Singaporean citizenship on 27 September 2007 as he was not on the Football Association of Singapore's Foreign Sports Talent Scheme.

He made his international debut at the age of 37 years and 89 days against Tajikistan in the first leg of the second round of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers on 9 November, contributing with an immediate impact by scoring both goals in a 2\u20130 victory. \u0110uri\u0107 started the match following injuries to attacking midfielder Shi Jiayi and striker Indra Shahdan Daud. The result coupled with a 1\u20131 draw in the second leg meant that Singapore progressed to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. He continued his fine form on the international stage, scoring against Lebanon and Uzbekistan as Singapore finished third in Group 4.
