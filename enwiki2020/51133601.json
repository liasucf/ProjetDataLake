    "text": "\"The Other Side\" is the 8th episode of the supernatural drama television series Grimm of season 2 and the 30th overall, which premiered on October 19, 2012, on NBC. The episode was written by William Bigelow, and was directed by Eric Laneuville. ==Plot== Opening quote: \"I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden marionette. It must be wonderful, one that can dance, fence and turn somersaults.\" A group of friends participating for an academic bowl meets for a meal and leaves to their houses. One of them is then killed by a L\u00f6wen. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) attend a work function in the PPD. When Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are called to investigate the murder, Renard (Sasha Roiz) offers to take Juliette home. After leaving her, she takes a shower. Renard sneaks in the house and watches her showering, then leaves. Coach Anker (Hans Altwies) becomes the main suspect in the case for his attitude to Nick and Hank. Wu (Reggie Lee) presents to the officers a new intern, Ryan (Michael Grant Terry). After another contestant is killed, Anker decides to cancel the bowl. The next day, Anker is found dead. They find the watch of another contestant, Pierce Higgins (Logan Miller) in the contestant's possession and deduce that he may be a suspect. Adalind (Claire Coffee) turns out to be living in Vienna and meets with Renard's brother, Eric (James Frain). He reveals that while they share the same father, Renard's mother was a Hexenbiest. Renard is only half-royal and, because of his bastard status, he and his mother were forced to move to Portland. Pierce deduces that his mother (Mary Page Keller) is the killer and calls Nick and Hank. However, Pierce discovers he is in fact the killer, as his mother altered him before he was born to be a L\u00f6wen and a Genio Innocuo at the same time, and his L\u00f6wen part is committing the crime. He escapes and attempts to commit suicide, but is stopped by Nick at the last minute. He is placed in prison and uses his L\u00f6wen side to attack inmates. Renard's condition continues deteriorating, and he decides to find an antidote from Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) in the spice shop. Monroe states that the antidote may be difficult to find if he does not discover who is the person he is getting affected by and whom it could also affect. Renard debates whether or not to tell him, as Nick could know. ==Reception== ===Viewers=== The episode was viewed by 5.03 million people, earning a 1.5/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \"C+\" grade and wrote, \"Early in its run, Grimm used its epigraphs as a way to introduce whatever fairy tale was the topic of the episode's major plot. As the show progressed, the epigraphs became indicative of some thematic resonance between a tale and an episode. Now, the writer's seem to be combing any and all fairy tale-adjacent material for quotes to fit a plot that never sprang from the Grimm tales themselves. I understand why the source material can be limiting, but the writers have shown a range of literary influences. Episodes that contrast strong in-show mythology with a scramble to tie in fairy tale elements shows how over- complication of this world may not be playing to Grimms advantage.\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \"This episode, called 'The Other Side,' was not without some forward momentum for the continuing stories of Juliette and Renards potion- induced obsession with each other and of Adalind's return. Once the show established the group of ill-fated academic decathlon kids, it moved on to Nick and Juliette getting ready for a dinner in Renard's honor \u2013 he received an award for his work with the Portland Police. A thank you from Nick to Juliette for accompanying him to a dinner he hopes isn't too dull is met with Juliette's response of, 'Of course. This is what couples do \u2013 they go to each other's boring work functions.'\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \"'The Other Side' sets its procedural story up as one large metaphor for the upcoming drama that is about to unfold. I just wish the killer kid story hadn't been used back-to-back. Thankfully, Pierce being the culprit isn't the main takeaway from the story \u2013 it's his genetics. Pierce is half Lowen, half Genio Innocuo, and, because of that, if he can't keep his emotions in check his violent side comes out. It's a light twist to what Renard is going through.\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \"In the world of Grimm, knowledge is the type of leverage needed to survive. Nick had to learn quickly about the Wesen world in order to become a better Grimm, Hank's reaction to the news that Nick can see creatures as well was one of comfort, and Juliette has been trying to get her memory back in order to fully love her partner once again. With Monroe having to pick up information at the spice shop in Rosalee's absence, Renard continuing to obsess over Juliette with no end in sight, and Adalind attempting to get in good with the royal family to get vengeance for her mother, knowledge played a big part in 'The Other Side'.\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \"Up until the ending, 'The Other Side' was a great Wesen-of-the-week episode that did a nice job of balancing Adalind's plotting and mythology with cop-procedural action. It was fun to see Monroe geek out about the spice shop and Hank get upset about the Grimms' bloody past. Plus Renard is such a strong character that I even liked the Juliette storyline. But Nick and Hank's cynical shrugging-off of a mentally unbalanced kid who desperately needed help not only felt out of character for both of them, it also destroyed the whole premise of Grimm \u2014 that Nick, despite being a Grimm, is still a good guy.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Grimm (season 2) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ",
