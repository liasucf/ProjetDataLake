    "text": "The Retrospective EPs are a series of digital EPs by English rock band Keane, with the first being released on 5 December 2008 as the Everybody's Changing EP or Retrospective EP1. The cover art features the font Cochin for the first time since the release of \"Bend and Break\" in 2005. ==Everybody's Changing== The first Retrospective EP was the band's 2003 and 2004 hit single \"Everybody's Changing\", from their debut album Hopes and Fears. The final track \"Into the Light\" was never released, and features pianist Rice-Oxley on lead vocals.
