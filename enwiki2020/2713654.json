Found originally in 1838 in the Urals, it was first named knaufite but was later changed to volborthite for Alexander von Volborth (1800\u20131876), a Russian paleontologist.Mineral Galleries Tangeite (synonym: calciovolborthite), CaCuVO4(OH), is closely related. ==Occurrence== Volborthite was first described in 1837 for an occurrence in the Sofronovskii Mine, Yugovskii Zavod, Perm, Permskaya Oblast, Middle Urals, Russia. It occurs as an uncommon oxidation mineral in vanadium bearing hydrothermal copper ores. It is associated with brochantite, malachite, atacamite, tangeite, chrysocolla, baryte and gypsum. ==References== Category:Copper(II) minerals Category:Vanadate minerals Category:Phosphate minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ",
