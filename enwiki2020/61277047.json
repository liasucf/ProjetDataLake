    "text": "An election was held to fill the Municipal Assembly of the newly-created City of Greater New York on November 2, 1897. The charter of the new city had created a bicameral Municipal Assembly, consisting of an upper Council and a lower Board of Aldermen. Each chamber was elected from specially-made districts. In addition, the president of the Council was elected in a separate election on the same day. Democrats won majorities in both chambers of the Assembly, winning 26 of the Council's 28 seats and 47 of the 60 aldermanic seats. Affiliates of Tammany Hall filled all of Manhattan's seats in the Council. In addition, Democrat Randolph Guggenheimer won the Council Presidency. Bicameralism would prove to be short-lived, as the Municipal Assembly was replaced with a unicameral Board of Aldermen in 1901. ==Council election== The Council was divided into ten districts, eight of which elected three members each.Charter \u00a719 The remaining two--one covering Queens and the other Staten Island--elected two members each. One of the members from Queens was elected from Long Island City and Newtown and the other from the remainder of the borough. The entirety of the Bronx was located in the fifth district alongside upper Manhattan. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Members elected to the Council |- !District !!Member !!Note |- |rowspan=\"3\"|1 |||John T.
