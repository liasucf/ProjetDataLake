    "text": "U.S. Acres (known as Orson's Farm outside the United States and as Orson's Place in Canada) is a comic strip that originally ran from 1986 to 1989, created by Jim Davis, author of the comic strip Garfield. U.S. Acres was launched on March 3, 1986 in a then-unprecedented 505 newspapers by United Feature Syndicate. For most of the last year of the strip's existence, Brett Koth, who had been assisting Davis on Garfield at that time, was given co- creator's credit in the strip, and signed his name to the strips along with Davis. The strip was centered on a group of barnyard animals, with the main character being Orson, a small pig who had been taken from his mother shortly after being born. At the peak of the comic's popularity, there were children's books, plush animals (particularly of the characters Roy, Booker, Sheldon, and Orson), and posters of the main characters. An animated adaptation was included in the TV show Garfield and Friends, as a spin-off segment, and continued to be so for several years after the strip ended, which was even lampshaded in one of the final strips. The final daily strip was printed on April 15, 1989, while the final Sunday appeared on May 7, 1989. Most papers only ran the Sunday strip, usually in the same page as Garfield. The strip was relaunched as an online webcomic on October 1, 2010 the date going back to March 3, 2010. The relaunch was announced the day before in a question and answer column in USA Today. Later, in celebration of U.S. Acres's twenty- fourth anniversary, the strips prior to August 1, 1986 were released on Garfield.com. On August 7, 2016, a Garfield comic strip showed the U.S. Acres gang (sans Bo and Blue) in its logo box, featuring Garfield eating a bag of chicken feed. In August 2019, Jim Davis sold the rights to U.S. Acres to Viacom as part of its acquisition of Paws, Inc. ==Comic strip collections== Five comic strip collections were published, by Topper Books of New York City. # (1986-03-03 through 1986-10-04) # (1986-10-05 through (1987-05-09) # (1987-05-10 through 1987-12-13) # (1987-12-14 through 1988-07-17) # (1988-07-18 through 1989-02-18) Also, at least six comic strip collections were published by Berkley Books of New York City. However, some of these books are missing months of the strip and / or have strips out of order. # # (1986-05-24 through 1987-08-16) # (1986-08-18 through 1986-11-03) # # # (1987-04-14 through 1987-05-09, 1987-12-14 through 1988-02-08) The final two months of U.S. Acres were not published as part of an American collection. The last U.S. Acres collection was published in England as a mass-market paperback, titled Orson's Farm Cuts the Corn. The collection, which has since gone out of print along with the rest of the U.S. Acres books, contains fifty- nine of the final sixty strips (one Sunday strip was not printed) and is the rarest of any U.S. Acres/Orson's Farm collection. ===Children's books=== * * * * * *Wade Dives In * * *Wade's Haunted Halloween (from 1990) *Happy Birthday, Sheldon ==Characters== The primary traits of the cartoon's main characters were established during the run of the comic strip, even down to such visual gags as the head on Wade's inner tube having the same facial expression as Wade. ===Primary characters=== ====Orson Pig==== Orson Pig (voiced by Gregg Berger): A bossy na\u00efve pig whose work ethic makes him the functional leader. His good humor being tested is one of the common gags in the cartoons. In 1986, Orson had long eyelashes (to represent him as a young piglet) until they disappeared on December 31, 1987, and Booker and Sheldon called him Mom (though it was inconsistent because at other times they just call him Orson). Being the runt of his litter, Orson's original owner intended to get rid of him. Orson fell from the pick-up taking him away from his birthplace and moved to the farm known as U.S. Acres. and was later found by a farm girl who persuaded Orson to follow her to her father's farm. Orson's alter-ego is a costumed superhero named Power Pig, which more often than not causes his friends or adversaries to fall down laughing at him. Orson loves books, but is very influenced by them, by sometimes doing what's in the book. Sometimes when Orson reads a book, particularly a scary one, the stuff he reads about usually appears behind him and scares the others away. He also disliked Roy. ====Roy Rooster==== Roy Rooster (voiced by Thom Huge): The strip's antihero. Roy is a loud, wisecracking rooster who endlessly enjoys practical jokes with Wade being his favorite target. With few exceptions he is tolerated because his job of waking up everyone and 'tending' to the chickens is important, but he does his best to avoid labor whenever possible. In the cartoon, he is more well- liked by the others and is often the one to defeat the series antagonists such as Orson's brothers. In spite of his lazy nature, Roy has proven to be a very capable protector of the chickens, coolly outsmarting and defeating the predators, such as the Weasel and the Fox, that try to kidnap them with a series of practical jokes and gags. Even though he is a jerk and insults everyone, Roy is not a bully and doesn\u2019t really mean any harm. He is allergic to flowers, a fact that was first established in a strip published on July 2, 1986. ====Wade Duck==== Wade Duck (voiced by Howard Morris): Wade is the \"cowardly craven duck\" of the farm. His good nature is sometimes shadowed by his overwhelming hypochondria and pantophobia. Wade is always seen wearing a kiddie pool flotation inner tube, which (as part of a continuous running gag) has a duck head in front of it that shares the same facial expressions as Wade \u2013 even down to the direction in which Wade is looking. ====Booker==== Booker (voiced by Frank Welker): A chick named by Orson for the pig's love of books. Booker and Sheldon were still eggs when Orson found them abandoned and decided to hatch them. Booker is extremely adventurous and (over) confident despite his size. He often chases worms, but can never seem to catch them. In the comic, he often called Orson \"Mom.\" ====Sheldon==== Sheldon (voiced by Frank Welker): Booker's twin brother, who decides not to hatch. He became very philosophical and introspective over the course of the strip, and began musing on his \"Sanctum Sanctorum\" (a small mound of grass). A recurring gag is to portray his shell as the perfect living space within, without ever showing it. In one episode, the shell finally hatched, only to reveal another shell underneath. ====Bo Sheep==== Bo Sheep (also voiced by Frank Welker): Lanolin's brother. In the comics, he was depicted as being unintelligent and perky. However, in the TV series, he was a surfer dude and shown as not particularly bright, but always calm, cool, collected, dependable, and a great cook. ====Lanolin Sheep==== Lanolin Sheep (voiced by Julie Payne): Usually shown as a hard worker, but with a personality the polar opposite of her brother: loud and disagreeable. Her name is that of the grease produced by wool-bearing animals, such as sheep. In the comic strip, she was much more abrasive than in the television series. She revealed that she has wider arms and fingers than Roy during a fight, and was the only one who could put Roy in his place. In the TV series, she was always seen doing laundry, but in one episode, Roy pointed out that none of them normally wear any clothes and wondered where all the laundry was coming from. Ironically enough, in the same episode, Roy is wearing a bathing suit. ===Secondary characters=== * Filbert (voiced by Howard Morris): A worm Booker often chases, but with no success. He lives in a hole with his wife Estelle and their son Willy. He appeared in the animated series, but his name was never revealed on the show. * Cody: A dog who took pleasure in chasing the barnyard's animals and trying to maul them. He was eventually removed from the strip towards its end without any explanation and he never made an appearance or was even mentioned in Garfield and Friends. His final appearance was on September 13, 1988. * Blue: A blue cat who was friends with Cody and kept him in line. Like Cody, she disappeared from the strip towards its end without any explanation and she never made an appearance or was even mentioned in Garfield and Friends. Her final appearance was March 28, 1988. * Mort, Gort, & Wart (voiced by Frank Welker, Thom Huge, and Howard Morris, respectively): Orson's three larger, meaner brothers who played a much bigger role in the animated series than they ever did in the comic strip, where they were unnamed. They stopped appearing in the strip after Orson was taken away from his mother, but began appearing as tormentors to Orson as well as frequent burglars of the farm's crops in the animated series. * Max the Skateboarding Bird: An eccentric, flightless bird that first appeared as a mysterious creature in a wall that Wade spoke to on October 13, 1986. Jim Davis solicited ideas from readers (specifically children) as to what they thought the creature might be. On March 3, 1987, Davis revealed his pick in the strip. Max did not appear again following the week. * The Weasel (voiced by Gregg Berger): A television-exclusive character who often tries to kidnap the chickens so that he can eat them, but is usually stopped by Roy. The only other regularly recurring antagonist (even though he never appeared in the strip), he occasionally attempts to catch and eat Sheldon as well. * The Bull: A mean bull that lives in the barnyard. * The Worms: Random worms that Booker chases. * Plato: A talent Black Rooster popular with the chickens who replaces Roy in the episode \"Cock-A-Doodle Duel\" causing Roy to leave. Though popular with the chickens, he is a coward who hides from the weasel forcing Roy to come to their rescue. Wade even notes Plato is more cowardly than Wade himself. Plato appears in another episode as a giant bunny rabbit shepherd who sends a cryptic letter to the farm warning them \"The Bunny Rabbits is coming\" which causes Wade to panic and everyone to note the letter's improper grammar by saying \"Shouldn't it be the Bunny Rabbits ARE coming?\" as a running gag throughout the episode. At the end the farm experiences a bunny rabbit stampede and Plato appears explaining he sent the letter. ==References== ==External links== *U.S. Acres at Garfield.com * *Incomplete list of U.S. Acres books at Michigan State University Libraries \u2013 Special Collections Division \u2013 Reading Room Index to the Comic Art Collection \u2013 \"U.S.A.\" to \"U Zemlji\" Category:Jim Davis (cartoonist) Category:1986 comics debuts Category:1989 comics endings Category:Comic strips started in the 1980s Category:Comics about pigs Category:Comics about ducks Category:Comics about animals Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Fictional farms ",
