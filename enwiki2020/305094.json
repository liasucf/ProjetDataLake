    "text": "East Sheen, also known as Sheen, is an affluent suburb in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Its long high street has goods stores, convenience services, offices, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, pubs and suburban supermarkets and is also the economic hub for Mortlake of which East Sheen was once a manor. This commercial thoroughfare, well served by public transport, is the Upper Richmond Road West which connects Richmond to Putney. Central to this street is The Triangle, a traffic island with a war memorial and an old milestone dating from 1751, marking the distance to Cornhill in the City of London. The main railway station serving the area, Mortlake, is centred north of this. Sheen has a mixture of low-rise and mid-rise buildings and it has parks and open spaces including its share of Richmond Park, accessed via Sheen Gate; Palewell Common, which has a playground, playing fields, tennis courts and a pitch and putt course; and East Sheen Common which is owned by the National Trust and leads into Bog Gate, another gate of Richmond Park. ==Etymology== The earliest recorded use of the name is c. 950 as Sceon and means shed or shelters. The area was designated separately from Sheen (an earlier name for Richmond) from the 13th century, as the southern manor of Mortlake. ==Local politics== East Sheen is in the Richmond Park constituency. The Member of Parliament is Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats. Every four years, residents elect three councillors to Richmond upon Thames Council. East Sheen has traditionally been seen as a safe Conservative ward, but in the 2018 elections, one Liberal Democrat and two Conservatives were elected. == History == === Manor and hamlet status === East Sheen was a hamlet in the parish of Mortlake: Earliest references specifically to the present area of land, rather than references to parts of Mortlake, emerge in the 13th century, generally under its early name of Westhall. Originally one carucate, it was sold in 1473 by Michael Gaynsford and Margaret his wife in the right of Margaret to William Welbeck, citizen and haberdasher, of London. The Welbecks held it until selling in 1587. Later owners of what remained, the Whitfields, Juxons and Taylors were equally not titled, as with Mortlake's manorial owners, nor had an above average size or lavish manor house. === Development of the Temple Grove, Palmerston country estate === Prime Minister Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston sold the southern purported manor to private developers as a young man. The southern estate of Temple Grove, East Sheen, first belonged to Sir Abraham Cullen, who was created a baronet in 1661. He died in 1668, and his first son Sir John in 1677. His second son Sir Rushout Cullen seems to have sold the estate shortly afterwards to Sir John Temple, attorney-general of Ireland, brother to Sir William Temple, diplomat and author, who was earlier of adjoining West Sheen, giving the home his name. It belonged to the Temples until Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, who later would serve as Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, sold it soon after coming of age in 1805. It was bought by Sir Thomas Bernard, who rebuilt the Jacobean style front of the house shown in a drawing hung in the house of 1611. Sir Thomas sold it about 1811 to Rev. William Pearson who founded the Temple Grove Preparatory School for boys. The school moved in 1907 to Eastbourne and the estate was given over to house and apartment builders. East Sheen was included in the Metropolitan Police District in 1840. Before 1900, Mortlake developed a secular vestry to help administer poor relief, maintain roads, ditches and other affairs.IGEW John Marius Wilson: Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870\u201372) From 1892 to 1894 Mortlake (including East Sheen) formed part of the expanded Municipal Borough of Richmond.Vision of Britain \u2013 Mortlake parish (historic map ) In 1894, nearby North Sheen was created as a civil parish, being split off from Mortlake and remaining in the Municipal Borough of Richmond.Vision of Britain \u2013 North Sheen parish (historic map ) The remainder of Mortlake (including East Sheen) was instead transferred to the Barnes Urban District,Vision of Britain \u2013 Barnes UD/MB (historic map ) which became the Municipal Borough of Barnes in 1932. In 1965 North Sheen was incorporated into Kew which, with the rest of the Municipal Borough of Richmond, joined the Municipal Borough of Twickenham and the Municipal Borough of Barnes to form the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. In the wards of the United Kingdom, Sheen has the largest share of Richmond Park of its surrounding five wards. ==Economy== East Sheen concentrates its commercial area to the main through street: its long high street has transport/furniture/hardware stores, convenience services, offices, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and pubs and suburban supermarkets and is also the economic hub for Mortlake of which East Sheen was once a manor. This wide-footpath street is the Upper Richmond Road West which connects Richmond to Putney. Central to this street is The Triangle, a tree- lined traffic island with a war memorial and an old milestone at the intersection of Upper Richmond Road West with Sheen Lane. The main railway station serving the area, Mortlake, is centred 300m north of this.Grid square map Ordnance Survey website ==Churches== Christ Church, East Sheen Entrance to air-raid shelter at St Leonard's Court East Sheen lies in the ecclesiastical parish of Mortlake with East Sheen. In addition to the Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin the district has two daughter churches: Christ Church, and All Saints. Christ Church, situated near the crossroads of Christchurch Road and West Temple Sheen, was built by Arthur Blomfield on land formerly part of a farm at the entrance to Sheen Common in the 1860s. It was originally planned to be opened in April 1863; however, the tower collapsed shortly before completion and had to be rebuilt. The church was finally completed and consecrated nine months later, on 13 January 1864. All Saints was built on land bequeathed under the will of Major Shepherd-Cross, MP for Bolton who lived at nearby Palewell Lodge from 1896 until his death in 1913. The church was consecrated on All Saints' Day 1929, a year and two days after the foundation stone was laid by Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother). East Sheen has two other churches: East Sheen Baptist Church and Parkside Christian Centre. East Sheen has no separate Roman Catholic church; the church of St Mary Magdalen Mortlake and Our Lady Queen of Peace Church, Richmond also serve East Sheen. ==Other notable features== There is a Grade II-listed air raid shelter, dating from before the Second World War, at St Leonard's Court, a block of flats on St Leonard's Road, near Mortlake railway station. ==Notable residents== ===Living people=== Mosaic by Sue Edkins at Sheen Lane Centre honouring Tim Berners-Lee * Sir Tim Berners- Lee (born 1955), computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web, grew up in East Sheen and attended Sheen Mount Primary School.
