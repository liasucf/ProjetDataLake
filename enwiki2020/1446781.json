    "text": "is a monthly sh\u014djo manga magazine published by Kodansha in Japan. First published in December 1954, it is a long-running magazine with over 60 years of manga publication history. The target demographic for Nakayoshi (like Ribon and Ciao) is girls of age 8\u201314. Roughly the size of a phone book (hence the term \"phone book manga\"), it generally comes with furoku, or small gifts, such as popout figures, games, small bags, posters, stickers, and so on. The furoku is an attempt to encourage girls to buy their own copies of the magazine rather than just share with a friend. It is one of the best-selling sh\u014djo manga magazines, having sold over 400million copies since 1978. In the mid-1990s, Nakayoshi retailed for 400 yen and had an average of 448 pages. The estimated average circulation of Nakayoshi at this time was 1,800,000. Its circulation peaked at 2,100,000 in 1993. In 2007, its circulation was 400,000.Japan Magazine Publishers Association Magazine Data 2007 . During the 1990s, then editor-in-chief, Yoshio Irie attempted to move the magazine away from \"first love\" stories and introduced several fantasy manga such as Sailor Moon. During that period, Nakayoshi pursued a \"media-mix\" campaign, which involved close coordination of the magazine, anime productions based on the manga, and character merchandising. Nakayoshi is also published on the 6th of each month. ==Serializations== ===Current=== * Okko's Inn (2006\u2013present) * Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card (2016\u2013present) ===Past=== ====1954\u20131979==== * Princess Knight (1958) * Angel's Hill (1960\u20131961) * Sarutobi Ecchan (1971) * Candy Candy (1975\u20131979) * Ohay\u014d!
