    "text": "The 2016 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 8, 2016, to elect representatives for all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states. Non-voting members for the District of Columbia and Territories of the United States were also elected. These elections coincided with the election of President Donald Trump, although his party lost seats in both chambers of Congress. The winners of this election served in the 115th Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2010 United States Census. In October 2015, the House elected a new Speaker, Republican Paul Ryan, who was re-elected in the new term. Democrat Nancy Pelosi continued to lead her party as Minority Leader. Elections were also held on the same day for the U.S. Senate, many governors, and other state and local elections. == Results summary == Source: Note: does not include blank and over/under votes which were included in the official results. {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white;\" | style=\"background:; width:56.78%;\" | 241 | style=\"background:; width:43.22%;\" | 194 |- | Republican | Democratic |} {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align:right\" ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=center rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Parties ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=center colspan=4 | Seats ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=center colspan=3 | Popular vote |- ! 2014 ! 2016 !

In an \"open\" primary, any registered voter can vote in any party's primary. In a \"closed\" primary, only voters registered with a specific party can vote in that party's primary. In a \"top-two\" primary, all candidates run against each other regardless of party affiliation, and the top two candidates advance to the second round of voting (in Louisiana, a candidate can win the election by winning a majority of the vote in the first round). All of the various other primary types are classified as \"hybrid.\" Alaska in 2008 provides one example of a hybrid primary: the Democratic Party allowed unaffiliated voters to vote in its primary, while the Republican Party only allowed party members to vote in its primary. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
