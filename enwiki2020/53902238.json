She served in the Royal Navy through the end of World War II and was returned to the custody of the United States Navy on 7 March 1946. On 5 June 1946, less than three months after her return, she was struck from the Navy list; and, on 11 October 1947, she was sold to Luria Brothers & Co., of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. == See also == * List of United States Navy LSTs == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1942 ships Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the Royal Navy Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United Kingdom Category:S3-M2-K2 ships ",
