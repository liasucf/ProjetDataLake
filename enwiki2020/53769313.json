    "text": "The somewhat involved history of the ownership and management of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden can be split up into three main categories: the managers of the various theatrical and operatic companies which played there (historically, a mixture of actor-managers and impresarios); the leaseholders of the opera houses built on the land; and the owners of the freehold (i.e. ground landlords). From the early 20th century the theatre's management tended to be split between a general administrator and a musical/artistic director. The horizontal alignment of dates in the table is only approximate. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! style=\"width:15%;\" | Theatre ! style=\"width:30%;\" | ManagementA fairly compete list of 18th and 19th century managers is found in ! style=\"width:30%;\" | Leaseholder ! style=\"width:25%;\" | FreeholderThe dates of the Dukes of Bedford as freeholders are from their succession to the title, not their full dates. |- | rowspan=\"6\" |First theatre December 1732 \u2013 September 1808 | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| 1732\u20131761 John Rich | 1732 3rd Duke of BedfordDied September 1732 aged 24, at Coruna, Spain |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 1732\u20131771 4th Duke of Bedford |- | 1761 John Beard, Rich's son-in-lawBeard married John Rich's daughter Charlotte, retired due to deafness in 1767. | 1761 Priscilla Rich |- | 1767 George Colman |July 1767 George Colman, William Powell, Thomas Harris, & John Rutherford |- | 1774 Thomas Harris, sub-leased to Thomas Hull 1775\u20131782 | 1785: Thomas Harris (owned nearly 75% of the lease) | 1771\u20131802 5th Duke of Bedford d. aged 36 |- | 1803 Thomas Harris & John P.
