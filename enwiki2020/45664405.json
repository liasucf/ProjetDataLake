    "text": "Bradley Hart is a New York-based Canadian contemporary artist, best known for the photorealistic portraits that he creates by injecting paint into bubble wrap. ==Early life and education== Hart was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Hart family business of restaurant design and construction introduced young Bradley to the workings within wood and metal shops, where his interest in the creative process was kindled. At age 11, Hart was enrolled into Thornton Hall, a private art school where he took classical art training including the replication of Renaissance masters works for 20 hours a week.\u201cBradley Hart Interview.\u201d HUNTED PROJECTS.Video: Bradley Hart Studio Visit, HUNTED PROJECTS In 2002, Hart received his B.A. from the University of Toronto, Canada, with a double major in Visual Art and Semiotic Communication Theory and a minor in Cinema Studies. Hart relocated to New York City in 2008, where he lives and works today. == Artistic Style == Hart works mainly with bubble wrap as his unique canvas and creative material. According to the artist, the idea of turning the commonly used packing plastic into art came from his encounter of overly protective museum security guards and a leftover roll of bubble from his first solo show in New York.Reuters, 2014. \"The New Meaning of Pop Art (Video),\" March 28. Since then, Hart has developed \"a conceptually complex and elaborate system that includes the perpetual invention of mechanized methods allowing for his art to spawn more art.\"Zafman, Deborah.\u201cThe Madness to Bradley Hart\u2019s Method: Technique Becomes Technology and Art Spawns Art\u201d. ===Injections=== Hart's oeuvre of interrelated series initiates with the Injection paintings. The subjects of Hart's paintings, ranging from portraiture of celebrities and friends to full-scale scenery and snapshots of life,Laluyan, Oscar. 2015. \"Bradley Hart: Injecting a New Line of Descendants,\" Arte Fuse Magazine, March 3. come from his personal photograph collection.Hart, Bradley. Artist Statement. Using software that he developed with a friend, Hart assigns a color code to each bubble which corresponds with a paint-loaded syringe.Weir, Bill. 2013. \"Steve Jobs Immortalized in Bubble Wrap Art,\" Yahoo! News, March 26. The artist then injects the acrylic paint into each cell of the bubble wrap, resulting in pixelated hyperrealist recreations of the chosen images. On average, it takes Hart about 150 hours to finish each Injection work.Stuart, Hunter. 2013.\"Bubble Wrap Paintings By Bradley Hart Are The Coolest Things You'll See Today,\" The Huffington Post, March 19. ===Impressions=== While injecting, Hart intentionally overfills the bubbles with a calculated amount of paint so that the excess paint would drip down the flat side of the bubble wrap.\u201cPress Release: Descendants.\u201d Anna Zorina Gallery. Retrieved on 2015-02-06. The drips fuse upon drying and are then removed from the plastic.Riley-Adams, Ella. 2014. \"Bradley Hart Reinterprets Classical Paintings (with Bubble Wrap),\"The Creators Project, May 1. This layer becomes the next series, titled Impression, which is a natural byproduct of the previous Injection work and yet constitutes an independent body of works on its own. ===Assemblages=== Hart recycles at every level of his studio practice. Dried paint from the mixing jars and studio surfaces, such as the floor, palette, the bubble wrap and the drop sheet, is collected and assembled to produce either the Created Waste or the Wasted Paint series. Intention distinguishes the two. For Creative Waste, the artist decisively spills the acrylic in a way that mimics the natural splatters from his previous series. Wasted Paint, on the other hand, is composed solely of accidental spills including those produced in the Created Waste process. Hart related during an interview that \"[t]he created waste and the waste paint series are created through an emotional response to what I see much like an action painter but for me it is more sculptural than painterly,\" and that different series provided him with different types of satisfaction. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === 2015 Descendants, Anna Zorina Gallery, New York City 2014 The Masters Interpreted, Cavalier Galleries, New York City 2013 SCOPE, Cavalier Galleries, Miami, Florida 2013 An Artist\u2019s Impressions, RePopRoom, New York City 2013 The Bubble Wrap Proposition: Chapter 1, Cavalier Galleries, Greenwich, Connecticut 2012 What?
