    "text": "The Republican Turkish Party (, CTP) is a social-democratic political party in Northern Cyprus. The party was founded in 1970 by Ahmet Mithat Berbero\u011flu, a lawyer, in opposition to the leadership of Faz\u0131l K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck and Rauf Denkta\u015f. On 30 June 2008, the Republican Turkish Party became a consultative member of the Socialist International (voted in by all members except the Greek Cypriot Movement for Social Democracy). It became a full member of the organization in 2014. == Policies and ideology == The CTP is a social democratic political party, positioned on the centre-left on the political spectrum. The party espoused a pro-Soviet stance during the Cold War, especially under the leadership of \u00d6zker \u00d6zg\u00fcr. However, the party never described itself as explicitly communist. Under \u00d6zg\u00fcr, the party held rapprochement meetings with the Greek leftist party of Cyprus, the Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL). Under Mehmet Ali Talat, the party shifted towards its current moderate leftist position. On the Cyprus dispute, the CTP traditionally favours a pragmatic approach, and supports the reunification of the island. During the presidency of former CTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat, the party led reunification talks with the Republic of Cyprus. == History == === 20th century === The Republican Turkish Party was established in 1970 by Ahmet Mithat Berbero\u011flu, in opposition to Rauf Denkta\u015f, and later his National Unity Party (UBP). The CTP was further vocally opposed to Faz\u0131l K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, who served as the first Vice President of the Republic of Cyprus. The CTP was led by \u00d6zker \u00d6zg\u00fcr between 1976 and 1996; \u00d6zg\u00fcr also served as Deputy prime minister in the aftermath of the 1993 legislative election. === 21st century === Mehmet Ali Talat became party leader in 1996, taking over from \u00d6zg\u00fcr. Under his leadership, the party lost 7 seats in the 1998 elections, becoming the fourth largest party in Northern Cyprus. However, in 2003, he led the party to victory, scoring over 35% of the vote, and taking 19 of the 50 seats in the Assembly of the Republic. The following year, Talat formed a government and became prime minister on 13 January 2004. He stepped down in 2005, after winning that year's presidential election; he went on to serve a single term as President of Northern Cyprus, until 2010. During his presidency, Talat conducted weekly meetings with the Greek Cypriot president, Demetris Christofias. The two leaders discussed issues such as power-sharing, armed forces, land ownership, and other problems that would arise in the event of reunification of the island. Ferdi Sabit Soyer served as leader of the CTP for a certain period, and became prime minister in April 2005 after Talat's presidential victory, serving until May 2009.http://www.pes.eu/ferdi_sabit_soyer The CTP lost the 2009 legislative election to the National Unity Party, and entered into opposition in the Assembly of the Republic. After winning the 2013 elections with 38% of the vote and 21 seats, the CTP chairman \u00d6zkan Yorganc\u0131o\u011flu, in office since 2011, became prime minister of Northern Cyprus on 2 September 2013. His government also included the rightist Democratic Party (DP). In the 2015 presidential elections, CTP fielded Sibel Siber as their candidate. However, Siber took just under 23% of the vote, and was eliminated in the first round of voting. As a result, \u00d6zkan Yorganc\u0131o\u011flu resigned as prime minister two months later; \u00d6mer Kalyoncu, also of the CTP, then formed a grand coalition with the National Unity Party. On 16 April 2016, the CTP government was ousted by a coalition led by H\u00fcseyin \u00d6zg\u00fcrg\u00fcn, consisting of the National Unity Party and the Democrats, who together ruled Northern Cyprus as a minority government until 2018. The Republican Turkish Party was returned to power following the 2018 elections. Despite dropping from 38% of the popular vote and first place in 2013 to only 21% and second place, the party was able to put together a four-party coalition, which also included the People's Party, the Communal Democracy Party and the Democratic Party, and held 27 of the 50 seats in parliament. The leader of CTP, Tufan Erh\u00fcrman, was appointed Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus by President Mustafa Ak\u0131nc\u0131 on 2 February 2018. == Leaders of the Republican Turkish Party == * Ahmet Mithat Berbero\u011flu (27 December 1970 \u2013 31 October 1976) * \u00d6zker \u00d6zg\u00fcr (31 October 1976 \u2013 14 January 1996) * Mehmet Ali Talat (14 January 1996 \u2013 21 May 2005) * Ferdi Sabit Soyer (21 May 2005 \u2013 5 June 2011) * \u00d6zkan Yorganc\u0131o\u011flu (5 June 2011 \u2013 14 June 2015) * Mehmet Ali Talat (14 June 2015 \u2013 13 November 2016) * Tufan Erh\u00fcrman (13 November 2016 \u2013 present) == Election results == === Parliamentary === {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Assembly of the Republic ! rowspan=2| Election ! colspan=3| Votes ! colspan=2| Seats ! style=\"width:150px\" rowspan=2| Role ! style=\"width:200px\" rowspan=2| Notes |- ! style=\"width:50px\"| # ! style=\"width:50px\"| % ! style=\"width:50px\"| Rank ! style=\"width:50px\"| # ! style=\"width:50px\"| \u00b1 |- ! 1976 | 97,637 | 12.9 | 3rd | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | new | | style=\"text-align:left\"| |- ! 1981 | 152,805 | 15.1 | 3rd | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 3 | | style=\"text- align:left\"| |- ! 1985 | 317,843 | 21.4 | 2nd | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 7 | | style=\"text-align:left\"| |- ! 1990 | | 44.5 | 2nd | style=\"text- align:right;\"| | 4 | | style=\"text-align:left\"|With Party for Democratic Struggle. |- ! 1993 | | 24.2 | 3rd | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 3 | | style=\"text-align:left\"| |- ! 1998 | 145,874 | 13.4 | 4th | style=\"text- align:right;\"| | 7 | | style=\"text-align:left\"| |- ! 2003 | 469,279 | 35.2 | 1st | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 13 | | style=\"text-align:left\"| |- ! 2005 | 577,444 | 44.5 | 1st | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 5 | | style=\"text- align:left\"| |- ! 2009 | 415.574 | 29.2 | 2nd | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 9 | | style=\"text-align:left\"| |- ! 2013 | 477,209 | 38.4 | 1st | style=\"text- align:right;\"| | 6 | | style=\"text-align:left\"|Opposition from 2016. |- ! 2018 | 1,121,478 | 20.9 | 2nd | style=\"text-align:right;\"| | 9 | | style=\"text- align:left\"|Opposition from 2019. |} == References == == External links == * Category:Cypriot nationalism Category:Political parties in Northern Cyprus Category:Parties related to the Party of European Socialists Category:Social democratic parties Category:Progressive Alliance Category:Full member parties of the Socialist International Category:Political parties established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Cyprus ",
