    "text": "The Military Region 5 Commandos (French: Commandos de la R\u00e9gion Militaire 5), MR 5 Commandos or MR 5 Cdos for short, were an elite military unit and Special Operations force of the Royal Lao Armed Forces (commonly known by its French acronym FAR), which operated during the final phase of the Laotian Civil War from 1969 to 1975. ==Origins== In 1969 some 300 selected Laotian personnel from the Royal Lao Army (RLA) were sent to Thailand to attend advanced Airborne and Ranger courses manned by instructors from the Royal Thai Army Special Forces (RTSF) at their Special Warfare Centre and Recondo School co- located at Fort Narai in Lopburi Province.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 18. Upon returning to Laos after completing their training, they went to provide the core of a new Para-Commando battalion which was assigned to Military Region 5, hence became known as \"Military Region 5 Commandos\". ==Structure and organization== By January 1970, MR 5 Cdos strength peaked at 340 officers and enlisted men, all airborne-qualified volunteers, organized into a battalion comprising one headquarters (HQ), three company HQ sections, and three Commando companies.Conboy and McCouaig, South- East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 18. The unit was based in Ban Y Lai, north of Vientiane, Laos capital city.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Operational history 1969-1975== The MR 5 Cdos were initially employed primarily on counter-insurgency sweeps targeting Pathet Lao guerrilla units around Vientiane, though in later years they were deployed in other military regions to demonstrate symbolic support from the Royal Lao Government. During September 1971 one company participated in Operation Golden Mountain, the successful capture of Phou Khout Mountain, overlooking Muang Soui in Military Region 2 (Long Tieng),Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 302. and in 1972 two companies were sent to Military Region 4 (Pakse) to assist RLA units in the recapture of Khong Sedone. As late as May 1975, after the collapse of the FAR, a single remaining company from the MR 5 Cdos was fighting Pathet Lao forces north of the Laotian capital city.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Weapons and equipment== The MR 5 Cdos used the standard weaponry and equipment of US origin issued to FAR units, complemented by captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms such as AK-47 assault rifles that allowed its personnel to use ammunition retrieved from enemy caches while on operations. * Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver * Colt.45 M1911A1 Pistol * Smith & Wesson Model 39 Pistol * TT-33 Pistol * Type 56 assault rifle * Type 56-1 Assault rifle * AKM Assault rifle * M16A1 Assault rifle * CAR-15 Assault carbine * RPD Light machine gun * Type 56 Light machine gun * M72 LAW Anti- tank rocket launcher * M79 grenade launcher * M203 grenade launcher * M1918A2 BAR Light machine gun * Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal Medium machine gun * M19 Mortar 60 mm * M18 Claymore anti-personnel mines ==See also== * Air America (airline) * Commando Raider Teams * Directorate of National Coordination * Laotian Civil War * Lao People's Armed Forces * Pathet Lao * Royal Lao Armed Forces * Royal Lao Army Airborne * Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) * SPECOM * Vietnam War * Weapons of the Laotian Civil War ==Endnotes== ==References== *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces, Elite series 33, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1991. *Kenneth Conboy with James Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, Boulder CO: Paladin Press, 1995. , 1581605358 ===Further reading=== *Kenneth Conboy and Don Greer, War in Laos 1954-1975, Carrollton, TX: Squadron/Signal Publications, 1994. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75, Men-at-arms series 217, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Khambang Sibounheuang (edited by Edward Y.
