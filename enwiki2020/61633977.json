The team were able to identify ash from the eruption, dated to 75,000 years before present, in the lake sediment, however found no evidence of the volcanic winter previously hypothesised. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Cardiff University Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Physical geographers Category:British geographers Category:Women geographers Category:21st-century British women scientists Category:20th-century British women scientists Category:20th-century geographers Category:21st-century geographers Category:1980 births ",
