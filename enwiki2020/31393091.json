UMCC was working completely legal under the laws of Compassionate Use Act of 1996 otherwise known as prop 215. On March 15, 2005 LAPD Sergeant Miguel Lopez received complaints of marijuana smoking near the UMCC offices on Wilshire Boulevard. UMCC was raided by the LAPD seizing 209 pounds of medical marijuana, 21 pounds of hashish, 12 pounds of marijuana oil and all the collective members capitol reserves ($186,416.00). No Criminal Charges filed Because of Scott's declaration stating \"All cannabis products obtained or produced by UMCC are only distributed to patient members of UMCC\u2024, UMCC does not allow the distribution of cannabis products to non-patients or non-members.\" testimony in the state court connection to the motion was connected to all of the seized assets. Proceedings 9th Circuit Court of Appeals: UNITED STATES v. $186,416. Feil finally accepted a five year term in a federal prison camp after two years of threats from the government to incarcerate his wife and father in law to 10 years in prison. ===Controversy=== October 2009 published decision in the 186,416 v United States Case. Feil won that case. This win not only returned the money to Feil, but it set the legal precedent that illegally obtained warrants by local police that violated State laws would not be admissible as evidence in Federal cases. The Federal Government is continuing their case against Scott and the others related to UMCC, although now the government can't use any evidence to prosecute Mr. Feil because it has all been suppressed. On August 19, 2009 Feil once more entered a Federal courtroom now facing criminal charges for his involvement in UMCC. Although medical marijuana is legal in California state law it still remains illegal in the United States federal law. Because there is no exception for medical marijuana distribution under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971. However, to be classified under a schedule 1 drug, there is to be no known medical benefits. Ironically, Medical Marijuana is a schedule 1 drug, yet there are multiple medical benefits which marijuana provides. During the 2008 presidential campaign, when President Obama was asked about his stand on medical marijuana he did state he would not have the justice department prosecute medical marijuana patients. This included raids on businesses complying with the state laws. Attorney General Eric Holder's statement that the Drug Enforcement Administration would end its raids on state-approved marijuana dispensaries, Obama said during the presidential campaign that he supported the controlled use of marijuana for medical purposes, when attorney General Eric Holder was asked about medical marijuana policy in the US he replayed \"What the president said during the campaign ... will be consistent with what we will be doing here in law enforcement,\" he said. \"What (Obama) said during the campaign ... is now American policy.\" ==Activist== Scott Feil has always been in full support of NORML and ASA with fundraisers and speaking at monthly meetings. ==See also== * Legal and medical status of cannabis * Places that have decriminalized non-medical marijuana in the United States * Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act * Medical cannabis in the United States * California Proposition 215 (1996) ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from Petaluma, California Category:American cannabis activists Category:American people convicted of drug offenses Category:Cannabis law reform in the United States ",
