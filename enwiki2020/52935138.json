    "text": "Coming Home is the fourth studio album by American rock band Falling in Reverse. The album was released through Epitaph Records on April 7, 2017. It is the last album to feature drummer Ryan Seaman and guitarist Derek Jones, and only album to feature lead guitarist Christian Thompson and bassist Zakk Sandler. == Background == The band members announced in 2016 that they had begun to work on their next album stating \"It's a huge left turn. It sounds like nothing we've ever done. Every song is very vibey, There's more feeling in it instead of a lot of metal,\" further stating that, \"We're challenging ourselves now more than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible, because you would think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go all over the place like we would normally do.\" On December 19, the band released the first single \"Coming Home\" from the album that at the time was not named. On January 20, 2017, the band announced that the album would be called \"Coming Home.\" The same day, they released the single \"Loser.\" The third single \"Broken\" was released on March 21, 2017. On April 4, 2017 they released a music video for \"Coming Home.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits for Coming Home adapted from AllMusic.
