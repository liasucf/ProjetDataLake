A remix version produced by Puerto Rican record producer Eliel was also included on the album. \"Segurosqui\" was Daddy Yankee's second song to chart on Billboard after peaking at number 32 on the Tropical Airplay chart on August 23, 2003. In April 2006, Daddy Yankee stated that \"When I released [the single] 'Seguroski', everyone said I couldn't do better than that. Then came 'Gasolina'. And, again, many people told me I would never do anything better than 'Gasolina'. That's what everybody has told me a thousand times over the years.\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2003 songs Category:2003 singles Category:Daddy Yankee songs Category:Puerto Rican artists Category:Reggaeton Category:Spanish-language songs ",
