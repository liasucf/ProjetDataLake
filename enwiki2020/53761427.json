    "text": "&&&&& is the debut mixtape by Venezuelan electronic producer Arca. It was released on 23 July 2013 through Hippos in Tanks and SoundCloud. Even though 14 tracks are listed, the entire mixtape is in sequence as a single track. A vinyl release of the mixtape with an alternative album cover was released on January 2014 and was limited to 500 copies. On 28 July 2020, Arca announced a re-release of &&&&&, making the mixtape available on streaming platforms for the first time on 18 September 2020. == Composition == &&&&& is an experimental electronic record with influences of dub, hip-hop, grime and ambient music. Stereogum described the record as \"even darker and denser\" than Arca's two previous Stretch EPs. ==Critical reception== &&&&& received critical acclaim from music critics. Tiny Mix Tapes says the mixtape \"has the potential to conjure an emotional frenzy that\u2019s alluring to the senses in a way that so much electronic artistry fails to even approach.\" No Ripcord praised the mixtape for \"its density, its intensity, its I'm-lost-in-a-big- city feel, its warm gust of beats blowing while the subway comes squeaking into the station, its darkness, its late-night ecstasy, its rawness, its rawness like raw milk, like drinking raw milk or eating sushi in an inexpensive restaurant somewhere on a street with trash and tweakers, its little motifs that twinkle like stars or Christmas lights, its muscular compactness.\" In a review of the reissue, Pitchfork said that \"there\u2019s something a bit melancholy about listening to &&&&& now\u2014the feeling that instead of freeing us from the past, technology has left us stuck in a loop, endlessly refreshing in search of a better world that never arrives, but that we can still dream of in our art.\" The album was eventually sent to Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s management, leading to the two artists collaborating on her eighth studio album Vulnicura. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Arca \u2013 production * Jesse Kanda \u2013 artwork ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 mixtape albums Category:Arca (musician) albums Category:Albums produced by Arca (musician) Category:Self-released albums Category:Albums free for download by copyright owner ",
