There is also an oblique metallic-blue streak from a white dot on the costa at two-fifths to the middle of the wing, as well as an irregular zigzag metallic-blue transverse line at three-fifths, not reaching the costa. A nearly straight grey line runs from a white dot on the costa at three-fifths to the dorsum at three-fourths and there is a pale iridescent- grey marginal line around the apex and termen, preceded by an irregular-edged narrow metallic-blue fascia.
