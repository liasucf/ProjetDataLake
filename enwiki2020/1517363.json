Running through Redhill is the primary road leading north out of Nottingham, now named Mansfield Road, which is part of the A60. Prior to it was considered to be the southern limit of Sherwood Forest. A professional guide to lead travellers safely through the forest to Mansfield could be hired from the now-demolished \u2018Guide House\u2019, which stood on the eastern side of Mansfield Road to the north of Roscoe Avenue. ==References== ==External links== *The Redhill Academy Category:Villages in Nottinghamshire Category:Gedling ",
