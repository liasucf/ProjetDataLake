Finally, in greed, Shailendra agrees to always maintain his relationship with Aradhna and not betray her by making relationships with women that he employs. Unfortunately, one day an evil woman named Raveena decides to dupe Shailendra into her charms and turn him against Aradhna to gain his full trust to gain his property and business. Shailendra, who was blindfolded by Raveena, lent her money to buy a flat of her own (because at the time she was staying in a hotel), and she lied to Shailendra that she had financial problems. Meanwhile, Shantanu (the Sareens' family friend), and Chandar (Shailendra's elder brother), plotted many plans to eliminate Raveena from Shailendra's life. A few of these plans were not successful. Unfortunately Sanjana and Vrinda was also sided with Raveena just for the money and their side of the property.
