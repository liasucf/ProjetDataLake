During the hyperinflation in Germany after World War I, he was able to purchase a lot of Karl Marx\u2019s writings. After he returned to Japan, he became an assistant professor at Kyushu University. In 1926, he became a professor. He was also known as a coterie of the magazine \"R\u014dn\u014d\" and an artist and became one of the leading Marxian economists in Japan. When the crackdown against socialism and communism became severe, Sakisaka was resigned with two other professors in 1928. He moved to Tokyo, and involved in compilation and translation of the remodeled \"Marx Engels complete collection\". In 1930s, he was active as a representative of the group \"R\u014dn\u014d\". In 1937 he was arrested and imprisoned in connection with the First Popular Front Incident. After spending bail, speech activity was sealed, translated German books anonymously, and lived self-sufficiently in agriculture. While World War II, many socialists and communists turned for life, he was not able to actively resist the regime, but he was not support the regime. After World War II, socialism and communism movement were made possible again.

From 1960s to 70s, Socialist Association that kept lower activists began to have a great say within the Socialist Party. His sentiment was strongly reflected in the \"Socialist Association Thesis\" decided in 1968, which could be said to be the culmination of his socialist thought.
