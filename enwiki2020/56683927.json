It also has a new camera, a fingerprint sensor at the back instead of the front, 6 GB of RAM instead of 4 GB, omission of the CTIA headphone jack in favour of USB-C, a 5.5\" OLED screen rather than a 5.3\" LCD, Qi wireless charging, and a larger battery capacity. The device has a Snapdragon 835 like its predecessor. The display is curved, but the phone lacks palm rejection technology which is found in other curved smartphones.NOKIA 8 SIROCCO REVIEW: GOOD WORK NOKIA, BUT BUYERS CAN SKIP THIS FLAGSHIP The 8 Sirocco is the very first Nokia device featuring IP67 water resistant, which was never found in earlier Nokia phones including Lumia series. ===Software=== The Nokia 8 Sirocco ships with Android Oreo and can be updated to Android 10. ==Reception== The Nokia 8 Sirocco received mixed to positive reviews. Daniel Van Boom of CNET praised the device, stating that \"The Nokia 8 Sirocco is fast, feels sturdy, has a long battery life and runs the sleek Android One operating system.\" while noting that \"It lacks any standout features to justify its premium pricing. The Nokia 8 Sirocco's camera isn't reliable enough, and its design, while improved over the regular Nokia 8, feels stout and a little outdated\". Sandra Vogel of ZDNet also praised the phone\u2019s \"Solid steel frame, Android One ensuring 2 years of updates, 128GB of internal storage and IP67 rating for dust/water resistance\" while criticising the \"poor implementation of a curved screen and 16:9 ratio display\". ==References== Category:Nokia Android smartphones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2018 Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording ",
