    "text": "The 2nd Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China (Traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u5171\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2d\u592e\u5c40) was the first such bureau to be convened within the 2nd Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of China. It was held in 1922. It was not preceded by a Central Bureau in 1921, as that concept had not developed yet. But all bodies met all at once in the 1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China. This Central Bureau was followed by the more foundational 3rd Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China. In 1925, it started to be known as the politburo. ==References== Category:Communist Party of China ",
