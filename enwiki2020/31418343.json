    "text": "The J\u00f3sika ['y\u0254:\u015fik\u0254] domain in Surduc, a village in S\u0103laj County, Romania, consists of a low-rise castle on the left bank of Some\u0219 River and a crypt built on a steep cliff at the entrance from Jibou into the village. The crypt, locally known as \"Baron's crypt\" (), was built in 1825, in the memory of Mikl\u00f3s J\u00f3sika's father who died a year before. On the facade can be read \"Parenti optimo pietas proculium posuit ano. MDCCCXXVII-mo\", an inscription executed in 1828 by Hirschfeld Friedrich, a sculptor born in Debrecen. Here lived and worked from 1824 until 1853, writer Mikl\u00f3s J\u00f3sika, founder of the Hungarian romantic novel. Between the walls of the castle, he wrote the historical novel \"Abafi\", his style being likened to Walter Scott. Members of J\u00f3sika family, originating in the north of the current Hunedoara County, contributed significantly to the rise and final appearance of the castle. It is important from a historical perspective, because here Prince of Transylvania Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi served a last lunch with Cs\u00e1ky Istv\u00e1n before the battle of Zsib\u00f3 (today Jibou) of November 15, 1705, lost to the Austrian imperial army led by General Ludwig von Herbeville. The castle is included in the List of Historical Monuments elaborated by the Ministry of Culture, as monument of local importance. == History == The baroque church on the main alley In the 17th century, Surduc, and hence the mansion, were property of Cs\u00e1ky family. From their mansion built in the middle of a park has not been preserved but the house of the servants. The mansion was turned into castle probably in the 18th century, because in the early 19th century the building is already registered as castle. In 1810 becomes the property of J\u00f3sika family. Maternal grandmother of Hungarian writer Mikl\u00f3s J\u00f3sika was a descendant of Cs\u00e1ky family. An inventory from 1854 records a building consisting of 17 rooms, including the writer's bureau and a chapel. The castle was built with stone from the nearby Roman castra of Tih\u0103u. The castle had a park where subsequently were found several fountains and a statue of Maria Theresa. The stone lions from the park were sent to the Wessel\u00e9nyi Castle of Jibou in the 1970s. On the main alley, there is a baroque church, and the main salon of the castle was full of remarkable pictures. The pieces of furniture were hand-carved, and the chandeliers surprised by elegance and refinement. Establishment of the communist regime in Romania led to the transformation of the castle into the headquarters of Station for Mechanization of Agriculture. Many valuable pieces here have disappeared or were destroyed. == References == Category:Castles in Romania Category:Buildings and structures in S\u0103laj County Category:Historic monuments in S\u0103laj County ",
