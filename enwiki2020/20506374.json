    "text": "The Steinitz exchange lemma is a basic theorem in linear algebra used, for example, to show that any two bases for a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements. The result is named after the German mathematician Ernst Steinitz. The result is often called the Steinitz\u2013Mac Lane exchange lemma, also recognizing the generalization . by Saunders Mac Lane of Steinitz's lemma to matroids. . == Statement == If \\\\{v_1, \\dots, v_m\\\\} is a set of m linearly independent vectors in a vector space V, and \\\\{w_1, \\dots, w_n\\\\} span V, then: 1\\. m \\leq n; 2\\. The set \\\\{v_1, \\dots, v_m, w_{m+1}, \\dots, w_n\\\\} spans V, possibly after reordering the w_i. ==Proof== Suppose that we have the indicated sets of vectors. We wish to show that for each k \\in \\\\{0, \\dots, m\\\\}, we have that k \\le n, and that the set \\\\{v_1, \\dotsc, v_k, w_{k + 1}, \\dotsc, w_n\\\\} spans V (where the w_j have possibly been reordered, and the reordering depends on k). We proceed by mathematical induction on k. For the base case, suppose k is zero. In this case, the claim holds because there are no vectors v_i, and the set \\\\{w_1, \\dotsc, w_n\\\\} spans V by hypothesis. For the inductive step, assume the proposition is true for some k < m. Since v_{k+1}\\in V, and \\\\{ v_1,\\ldots, v_k,w_{k+1},\\ldots,w_n\\\\} spans V (by the induction hypothesis), there exist coefficients \\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_n such that :v_{k+1}=\\sum_{j=1}^k \\mu_j v_j+\\sum_{j=k+1}^n \\mu_j w_j. At least one of \\\\{\\mu_{k+1},\\ldots,\\mu_n\\\\} must be non-zero, since otherwise this equality would contradict the linear independence of \\\\{ v_1,\\ldots,v_{k+1} \\\\}; note that this additionally implies that k+1 \\le n. By reordering the \\mu_{k+1}w_{k+1},\\ldots,\\mu_{n}w_n, we may assume that \\mu_{k+1} is not zero. Therefore, we have : w_{k+1}= \\frac{1}{\\mu_{k+1}}\\left(v_{k+1} - \\sum_{j=1}^k \\mu_j v_j - \\sum_{j=k+2}^n \\mu_j w_j\\right). In other words, w_{k+1} is in the span of \\\\{ v_1,\\ldots, v_{k+1},w_{k+2},\\ldots,w_n\\\\}. The latter span therefore contains each of the vectors v_1, \\ldots, v_k, w_{k+1}, w_{k+2}, \\ldots, w_n , and hence must contain the span of these latter vectors as a subset. But since the latter span is V (by the induction hypothesis), this simply means that the span of \\\\{ v_1,\\ldots, v_{k+1},w_{k+2},\\ldots,w_n\\\\} contains V as a subset (thus is V). We have therefore shown that our claim is true of k+1, completing the inductive step. We have thus shown that for each k \\in \\\\{0, \\dots, m\\\\}, we have that k \\le n, and that the set \\\\{v_1, \\dotsc, v_k, w_{k + 1}, \\dotsc, w_n\\\\} spans V (where the w_j have possibly been reordered, and the reordering depends on k). The fact that m \\leq n follows from setting k = m in this result. ==Applications== The Steinitz exchange lemma is a basic result in computational mathematics, especially in linear algebra and in combinatorial algorithms.Page v in Stiefel: == References == * Julio R.
