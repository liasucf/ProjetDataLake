Kittson county were Chippewa and French and Irish... also known as Metis ==Ohio== *Ashtabula\u2014from Lenape ashtepih\u0259le, 'always enough (fish) to go around, to be given away'; contraction from apchi 'always' \\+ tepi 'enough' + h\u0259le (verb of motion). *Chillicothe\u2014from Shawnee Chala\u00b7ka\u00b7tha, referring to members of one of the five divisions of the Shawnee people: Chalaka (name of the Shawnee group, of unknown meaning) + -tha 'person'; the present Chillicothe is the most recent of seven places in Ohio that have held that name, because it was applied to the main town wherever the Chalakatha settled as they moved to different places. *Conneaut\u2014probably derived from Seneca ga-nen-yot, 'standing stone'. See the article conneaut. Compare Juniata, originating from the name Onayutta or Onojutta in another Iroquoian language (probably Susquehannock), and the Oneida nation, whose name On\u0119\u02d9y\u00f3te\u02c0 also means 'standing stone'. *Coshocton\u2014derived from Unami Lenape Koshaxkink 'where there is a river crossing', probably adapted as Koshaxktun 'ferry' ('river-crossing device'). (Mahr's footnote references Zeisberger's Indian Dictionary, p. 49.) *Cuyahoga\u2014originally Mohawk Cayagaga 'crooked river', possibly related to kayuha 'creek' or kahyonhowanen 'river'. The Mohawk form of the name \"Cayagaga\" means 'crooked river', though it became assimilated to the Seneca name \"Cuyohaga,\" meaning 'place of the jawbone' in Seneca. The river is in an area mainly settled by the Seneca people in the 18th century, and the Seneca name stuck. *Geauga\u2014Onondaga jyo\u2019\u00e4\u00b7gak, Seneca jo\u2019\u00e4\u00b7ka\u2019, 'raccoon' (originally the name of the Grand River). *Mingo and Mingo Junction\u2014named after the Mingo people, Iroquoians who moved west to Ohio in the 18th century, largely of the Seneca nation; alternate form Minqua, both derived from Lenape Menkwe, referring to all Iroquoian peoples in general, possibly from Onondaga yenkwe, 'men'. (Although Brinton makes no attempt to account for the change of initial y- to m-.) *Muskingum\u2014Shawnee Mshkikwam 'swampy ground' (mshkikwi- 'swamp' + -am 'earth'); \"The Muskingum River was the channel by which eastern Ohio was penetrated, mainly by the Delawares during the first half of the eighteenth century, and to a much lesser extent by bands of Shawnees preceding the Delawares by a few decades. In its present form Muskingum, this river name has been in use among both Indians and whites for more than two centuries as another one of those terms of Indian-white travel-and-trade lingo, such as Ohio, Scioto, and others. Whatever its aboriginal form may have been, Muskingum as a river name was fragmentary, requiring in any Indian language the addition of a term signifying 'river.' Zeisberger and other Moravian missioners spelled it Muskingum, as we do today, as well as Mushkingum (transliterated from German-based Muschkingum). Most likely, both of these spellings represented two different pronunciations current among the Delawares. Zeisberger's definition of the name, based on a combination of moos, 'an elk,' and wuschking, 'eye' (in his own spelling), meaning 'elk's eye,' looks like a folk etymology resting on the similarity in sound between Muschkingum and wuschgingunk (Zeisberger's spelling), defined as 'on or in the eye.' John Johnston states that 'Muskingum is a Delaware word, and means a town on the river side.' This is partly correct and partly wrong. Muskingum (or Mushkingum, for that matter) indeed is a Delaware word, but by no stretch of the imagination does it mean 'a town on the river side.' It is certain though that it named a town on the river side. Possibly this town was an old Shawnee settlement whose name the nearby Delawares adapted to their own tongue in the form of *M'shkiink'm (Mushkinkum), and by force of folk etymology understood it to mean 'elk's eye.' It appears quite probable that the original Shawnee place name as assimilated by the Delawares, may have been *m'shkeenkw/aam(-), a Shawnee term combining *m'shkeenkw-, 'swampy,' with -aam, a stem approximately denoting '(land, soil, etc.) being as indicated,' and invariably followed by -'chki or some other adverbial determinant, with the composite meaning, 'where the land is swampy, soggy.' Where this place was located, it is impossible to ascertain. Evidently, in their assimilation of this Shawnee place name, the Delawares, disregarding as unessential the final locative affix, were solely concerned with *M'shkeenkwaam, from which it was but a small step, over intermediary *M'shkeenk'm, to folk-etymologically conditioned *Muushkiink'm ( Mushkinkum; Muskingum). taken to mean 'elk's eye' in Lenape by folk etymology, as if < mus 'elk' \\+ w\u0259shkinkw 'its eye'. *Ohio River\u2014from Seneca Ohiyo 'the best river' or 'the big river'. Ohiyo (pronounced \"oh-\u02c8hee-yoh\") is the Iroquois translation of the Algonquian name Allegheny, which also means 'the best river'. The Indians considered the Allegheny and Ohio to be all one river. Alleghany, or as some prefer to write it, Allegheny,\u2014the Algonkin name of the Ohio River, but now restricted to one of its branches,\u2014is probably (Delaware) welhik-hann\u00e9 or [oo]lik-hann\u00e9, 'the best (or, the fairest) river.' Welhik (as Zeisberger wrote it) is the inanimate form of the adjectival, meaning 'best,' 'most beautiful.' In his Vocabulary, Zeisberger gave this synthesis, with slight change of orthography, as \"Wulach'ne\u00fc\" [or [oo]lakhanne[oo], as Eliot would have written it,] with the free translation, \"a fine River, without Falls.\" The name was indeed more likely to belong to rivers 'without falls' or other obstruction to the passage of canoes, but its literal meaning is, as its composition shows, \"best rapid- stream,\" or \"finest rapid-stream;\" \"La Belle Riviere\" of the French, and the Oue-yo\u00b4 or O hee\u00b4 yo G\u00e4-hun\u00b4-d\u00e4, \"good river\" or \"the beautiful river,\" of the Senecas. For this translation of the name we have very respectable authority,\u2014that of Christian Frederick Post, a Moravian of Pennsylvania, who lived seventeen years with the Muhhekan Indians and was twice married among them, and whose knowledge of the Indian languages enabled him to render important services to the colony, as a negotiator with the Delawares and Shawanese of the Ohio, in the French war. In his \"Journal from Philadelphia to the Ohio\" in 1758, after mention of the 'Alleghenny' river, he says: \"The Ohio, as it is called by the Sennecas. Alleghenny is the name of the same river in the Delaware language. Both words signify the fine or fair river.\" La Metairie, the notary of La Salle's expedition, \"calls the Ohio, the Olighinsipou, or Aleghin; evidently an Algonkin name,\"\u2014as Dr. Shea remarks. Heckewelder says that the Delawares \"still call the Allegany (Ohio) river, Allig\u00e9wi Sipu. *Olentangy\u2014an Algonquian name, probably from Lenape ulam tanchi or Shawnee holom tenshi, both meaning 'red face paint from there'. The Vermilion River likewise was named with a translation of the original Ottawa name Ulam Thipi, 'red face paint river'. *Piqua\u2014Shawnee Pekowi, name of one of the five divisions of the Shawnee. *Sandusky\u2014from Wyandot saandusti meaning 'water (within water-pools)' or from andusti 'cold water'. *Scioto\u2014derived from Wyandot sk\u025bn\u01eb\u00b7t\u01eb\u2019, 'deer' (compare Shenandoah, also derived from the word for deer in a related Iroquoian language). *Tuscarawas\u2014after the Iroquoian Tuscarora people, who at one time had a settlement along the river of that name.\"Until after 1800 the name Muskingum also applied to its north branch, today officially called Tuscarawas. The latter name commemorates the Iroquoian Tuscarora Indians, who once had a settlement, Tuscarawi, or Tuscarawas, at its upper course, near present Bolivar, on the line of Stark and Tuscarawas counties.\" *Wapakoneta\u2014from Shawnee Wa\u00b7po\u2019kanite 'Place of White Bones' (wa\u00b7pa 'white'+(h)o\u2019kani 'bone'+-ite locative suffix).\"bone: ho\u0294kani\" Wick R.

The word in common use among Algonkin [i.e., Algonquian] tribes for river is sipu, and this includes the idea of 'a stream of flowing water'. But in the mountainous parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia sipu did not sufficiently convey the idea of a rapid stream, roaring down mountain gorges, and hanne takes its place to designate not a mere sipu, or flowing river, but a rapid mountain stream.\" or oolik hanna, which means 'best flowing river of the hills' or 'beautiful stream'.Alleghany, or as some prefer to write it, Allegheny,\u2014the Algonkin name of the Ohio River, but now restricted to one of its branches,\u2014is probably (Delaware) welhik-hann\u00e9 or [oo]lik-hann\u00e9, 'the best (or, the fairest) river.'

Heckewelder says that the Delawares \"still call the Allegany (Ohio) river, Allig\u00e9wi Sipu,\"\u2014\"the river of the Alligewi\" as he chooses to translate it. In one form, we have wulik-hann\u00e9sipu, 'best rapid-stream long-river;' in the other, wulik\u00e9-sipu, 'best long-river.' Heckewelder's derivation of the name, on the authority of a Delaware legend, from the mythic 'Alligewi' or 'Talligewi,'\u2014\"a race of Indians said to have once inhabited that country,\" who, after great battles fought in pre-historic times, were driven from it by the all-conquering Delawares,\u2014is of no value, unless supported by other testimony. Originally the name of the Allegheny River, later used to name the Allegheny Mountains too. David Zeisberger published a divergent view in 1780, giving the original form of the name as \"Alligewinenk, which means 'a land into which they came from distant parts'.\"\"All this land and region, stretching as far as the creeks and waters that flow into the Alleghene the Delawares called Alligewinenk, which means 'a land into which they came from distant parts'. The river itself, however, is called Alligewi Sipo. The whites have made Alleghene out of this, the Six Nations calling the river the Ohio.\" *Aliquippa\u2014Lenape alukwepi 'hat'; after Queen Aliquippa, who was named that because she wore a large hat. *Analomink\u2014From \"tumbling water.\" *Catawissa\u2014Lenape, 'growing fat;' a reference to a Delaware Chief in the area, Lapachpeton. *Conemaugh\u2014Lenape kw\u0259n\u0259muxkw 'otter'. *Conshohocken\u2014Lenape kanshihakink 'in elegant land': kanshi 'elegant' + haki 'land' + -nk locative suffix. *Juniata River\u2014from onoyutta, 'standing stone' in an Iroquoian language, probably Susquehannock. The Juniata Tribe lived by the river's banks and set up a tall standing stone with inscriptions in the center of their sacred meeting ground at the confluence of the Juniata River and Standing Stone Creek (in present-day Huntingdon). Compare Conneaut, Oneida. *Kingsessing\u2014The name Kingsessing or Chinsessing comes from the Delaware word for \"a place where there is a meadow\". *Kiskiminetas\u2014derived from Lenape kishku manitu 'make daylight' (kishku 'day' \\+ manitu 'make' ), a command to warriors to break camp and go on maneuvers while it is still night (as though it were daylight), according to John Heckewelder. *Kittanning\u2014Lenape kithanink 'on the main river': kit 'great, large, big' + hane 'swift river from the mountains' + -ink locative suffix, \"the big river\" or \"the main river\" being an epithet for the Allegheny-cum-Ohio, according to John Heckewelder.
