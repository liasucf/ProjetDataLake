    "text": "Iceland originally planned to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with the song \"Think About Things\" by Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0, selected through the national final contest S\u00f6ngvakeppnin 2020 organised by the Icelandic broadcaster R\u00daV. == Background == Prior to the 2020 Contest, Iceland had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 36 times since its first entry in 1986. Iceland's best placing in the contest to this point was second, which it achieved on two occasions: in 1999 with the song \"All Out of Luck\" performed by Selma and in 2009 with the song \"Is It True?\" performed by Yohanna. Since the introduction of a semi-final to the format of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2004, Iceland has failed to qualify to the final seven times. In 2019, Iceland placed tenth in the grand final with the song \"Hatri\u00f0 mun sigra\" performed by the band Hatari. The Icelandic national broadcaster, R\u00edkis\u00fatvarpi\u00f0 (R\u00daV), broadcasts the event within Iceland and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. Since 2006, Iceland has used a national final to select their entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, a method that has once again returned for the selection of their 2020 participation. ==Before Eurovision== ===S\u00f6ngvakeppnin 2020=== S\u00f6ngvakeppnin 2020 was the 15th edition of S\u00f6ngvakeppnin, the national song contest that selects Iceland's entries for the Eurovision Song Contest. ====Format==== Ten songs in total competed in S\u00f6ngvakeppnin 2020. The winner was decided after two semi-finals, a final and a superfinal. The two semi-finals were held on 8 and 15 February 2020, with five songs competing in each. The final was held in the Laugardalsh\u00f6ll indoor sports arena in Reykjav\u00edk on 29 February 2020. There, the top two songs from each semi-final competed, with the top two finalists then competing in a superfinal. The Icelandic national broadcaster also reserved the right to select a wildcard act for the final out of the remaining non-qualifying acts from both semi-finals. ==== Competing entries ==== R\u00daV opened entry submissions from 13 September 2019 until 17 October 2019. S\u00f6ngvakeppnin entries must have a version in Icelandic which is performed in the semi-final. If a song makes it to the grand final, the lyrics can be performed in the language intended for Eurovision. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Artist ! colspan=\"2\" | Song ! rowspan=\"2\" | Composer(s) |- ! width=\"150\" | Icelandic title ! width=\"150\" | English title |- | Brynja Mary | \"Augun \u00fe\u00edn\" | \"In Your Eyes\" | Brynja Mary Sverrisd\u00f3ttir, Lasse Qvist, Kristj\u00e1n Hreinsson |-style=\"background-color:gold; font-weight:bold;\" | Da\u00f0i & Gagnamagni\u00f0 | \"Gagnamagni\u00f0\" | \"Think About Things\" | Da\u00f0i Freyr P\u00e9tursson |- | Dimma | \"Almyrkvi\" | | Dimma, Ing\u00f3 Geirdal |- | El\u00edsabet | \"Elta \u00feig\" | \"Haunting\" | El\u00edsabet Ormslev, Zoe Ruth Erwin, Da\u00f0i Freyr P\u00e9tursson |- | Hildur Vala | \"Fellibylur\" | | Hildur Vala Einarsd\u00f3ttir, J\u00f3n \u00d3lafsson, Bragi Valdimar Sk\u00falason |- | \u00cdsold & Helga | \"Klukkan tifar\" | \"Meet Me Halfway\" | Birgir Steinn Stef\u00e1nsson, Ragnar M\u00e1r J\u00f3nsson, Stef\u00e1n Hilmarsson |- | Iva | \"Oculis Videre\" | bgcolor=\"#F08080\" | ~~\"Oculis Videre\"~~ | Iva Mar\u00edn Adrichem, Richard Cameron |- | Kid Isak | \"\u00c6vint\u00fdri\" | | \u00deorm\u00f3\u00f0ur Eir\u00edksson, Kristinn \u00d3li Haraldsson, J\u00f3hannes Damian Patreksson |- | Matti Matt | \"Dreyma\" | | Birgir Steinn Stef\u00e1nsson, Ragnar M\u00e1r J\u00f3nsson, Matth\u00edas Matth\u00edason |- | N\u00edna | \"Ekk\u00f3\" | \"Echo\" | \u00de\u00f3rhallur Halld\u00f3rsson, Sanna Martinez, Einar B\u00e1r\u00f0arson, Christoph Baer, Donal Ryan |} : a.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2020, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Iceland was placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 14 May 2020, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show. However, due to 2019-20 pandemic of Coronavirus, the contest was cancelled. In the Eurovision Song Celebration youtube broadcast in place of the heats, it was revealed that the song would have performed 9th, between Poland and Switzerland == References == == External links == * Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 Category:Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest Eurovision ",
