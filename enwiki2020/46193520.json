    "text": "Antoine Bauza (born August 25, 1978) is a French game designer. He designs board games, role-playing games and video games as well as being an author of children's books. == Life and career == Bauza was born on August 25, 1978. As a teenager, he was very interested in role-playing games, and wanted to become a video game designer. However, Bauza decided not to pursue video games as a career because he did not want to move away to Shanghai or Montreal, where video game companies were hiring at the time. He instead decided to become a teacher. After reconnecting with friends who started to hold their own game nights, Bauza began making his first board game prototypes in 2003 during his free time while studying at the Institut Universitaire de Formation des Ma\u00eetres. An avid board game player, Bauza decided to start making board games in 2007. In 2010, he began working on board games full-time. == Board games == * Chabyrinthe * Draftosaurus * Ghost Stories * Hurry\u2019Cup * Bakong * Pocket Rockets * Monster Chase! * Pony Express * Hanabi * 7 Wondershttp://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/ed8f294a-4937-11e2-803a-ba68653806cb/Les_nouveaux_classiques_du_jeu_de_soci\u00e9t\u00e9 * 7 Wonders Duel * Rockband Manager * Mystery Express * Dojo * Dr. Shark * Witty Pong * Takenoko * Ali * Tokaido * The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet * Terror in Meeple City * Samurai Spirit * Victorian Masterminds * Wellcome back to the dungeon == Role-playing games == * Exil * Final Frontier * Little Wizards == Video games == * Furry Tales * World of Lovecraft == Awards == * Meeples' Choice Award (2010) for 7 Wonders * Deutscher Spiele Preis (2011) for 7 Wonders * Kennerspiel des Jahres (2011) for 7 Wonders * As d'or Jeu de l'ann\u00e9e (2012) for Takenoko * Spiel des Jahres (2013) for Hanabi * Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Award (2013) for Hanabi (in German) ==References== == External links == * Antoine Bauza's designer page at BoardGameGeek * Antoine Bauza's designer page at RPGGeek * Antoine Bauza's website * Interview with Antoine Bauza (Little Metal Dog) * Interview with Antoine Bauza (Meeple Town) * Designer Spotlight: Antoine Bauza Category:Board game designers Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:French game designers ",
