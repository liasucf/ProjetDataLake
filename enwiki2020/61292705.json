    "text": "The Manoir du Clap is a manor located in the village of La Cerlangue, in Upper Normandy. The domain of \"Le Clap\" also includes old stables, an ancient shed, and some other buildings. The older part of the manor house was built at the end of the 16th century, under the reign of Henry IV of France. It was extended at the end of the 18th century, and again at the end of the 19th century.Lebourgeois, Patrick, La Cerlangue: sur les falaises de l'estuaire, \u00c9d. des Falaises, 2012 ==History== During the 11th century, the village of La Cerlangue was at the edge of the forest of Lillebonne. Lillebonne was an important city that was extended by Richard II in 1025. It became the chief town of the duchy, thanks to William the Conqueror.Jacques Le Maho, L'apparition des seigneuries ch\u00e2telaines dans le Grand-Caux \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque ducale, Arch\u00e9ologie m\u00e9di\u00e9vale, vol. 6, no 1, 1976, p. 5\u2013148 At that time, La Cerlangue was a part of the barony of Tancarville. Jacques Le Maho describes the town as a \"domaine non fieff\u00e9\" which belonged to the Baron of Tancarville. Then it became a \"comt\u00e9\" (French equivalent of an earldom), under the dominion of Jean II de Melun, the Count of Tancarville,Provinces, pays and seigneuries of France, P.D. Abbott, 1981 La Cerlangue was considered as the \"pr\u00e9vost\u00e9 of La Cerlangue\".Deville, Achille, (1789-1875), Histoire du ch\u00e2teau et des sires de Tancarville, Le Livre d'histoire, impr. 2009 During the Hundred Years' War, an English earldom of Tankerville was created, in parallel with the French county.Avenel, Alain, Tancarville: un ch\u00e2teau, un canal, un pont, toute une histoire, Falaises, 2008 After that war, lords and landowners rebuilt the destroyed mansions, castles and manor houses. The Manoir du Clap was built a hundred years after the conflict, in a place called \"Le Clap\", not far from La Cerlangue. That spot was particularly dynamic. Jens Christian Moesgaard testifies that the road starting from Tancarville, reaching La Cerlangue and passing through Le Clap was a local economical node.Jens Christian Moesgaard, La circulation des monnaies noires en Haute-Normandie, 1337-1577, Revue numismatique, vol. 6, no 165, 2009, p. 221\u2013305 A noble family decided to build a manor house here. This is the first phase of the Manoir du Clap. A rapier and various old pieces of furniture attest that this settlement happened during the reign of Henri IV, more precisely, between 1590 and 1608. In 1740, the manor was bought by the Yon family, who modified it. The family added 18th-century mouldings (in Louis XV, Louis XVI and Directoire styles). At the end of the 19th century, the mansion was enlarged, and a big banqueting room was added to the building. The enlarged house was able to host special guests, including the composer Arthur Honegger, who recited \"Jeanne d'arc au B\u00fbcher\" to the family in 1935. == References == Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Seine-Maritime ",
