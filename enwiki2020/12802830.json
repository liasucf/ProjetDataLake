It was coined during the ROC period of China, and refers to the following cities: *Chongqing *Wuhan *Nanjing Sometimes, Changsha or Nanchang are added, making the Four Furnaces (). In addition to the above 5 cities, Hangzhou and Shanghai are added to form the Seven Furnaces (\u4e03\u5927\u706b\u7089).
