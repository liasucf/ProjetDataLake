(2016): Preservation Obscures Pelagic Deep-Sea Fish Diversity: Doubling the Number of Sole-Bearing Opisthoproctids and Resurrection of the Genus Monacoa (Opisthoproctidae, Argentiniformes). PLoS ONE, 11 (8): e0159762. They are also known as mirrorbellies, in reference to the bioluminescent organ in their intestines.Two new species of deep-sea fish may communicate with light shining from their bellies, by Robin Meadows, at PLOS RESEARCH NEWS; published August 10, 2016; retrieved April 13, 2017 ==Species== There are currently 3 recognized species in this genus: * Monacoa grimaldii (Zugmayer, 1911) (Mirrorbelly) * Monacoa griseus J. Y. Poulsen, Sado, C. Hahn, Byrkjedal, Moku & Miya, 2016 (Grey mirrorbelly) * Monacoa niger J. Y. Poulsen, Sado, C. Hahn, Byrkjedal, Moku & Miya, 2016 (Black mirrorbelly) Until 2016, it was believed there was a single species of Monacoa, but in 2016 it was determined that they're actually 3 distinct species. The griseus and niger are distinct from the grimaldii because of their differences in pigmentation. An examination of their complete mitochondrial genomes further suggests the species are distinct. ==References== Category:Taxa named by Gilbert Percy Whitley ",
