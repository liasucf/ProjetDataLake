    "text": "Tehran Children: A Holocaust Refugee Odyssey is a book by Mikhal Dekel published in 2019. In it Dekel reconstructs her father Hannan's journey as a child refugee fleeing Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II. Hannan was one of nearly 1,000 child refugees who travelled from Central Asia to the Middle East as they fled the conflict. The book includes archival research, memoir, and travel reportage from Poland, Russia, Uzbekistan, Iran and Israel. The New York Times wrote that the experiences of these children had been \u201clittle researched and reported\u201d prior to Tehran Children. The book examines the \u201cprofound dislocations \u2013 geographical, familial, psychological \u2013 of the first stages of the German invasion of Poland,\u201d leading to an exodus in which the children endured Soviet Gulags, the \u201cstarving regions of Communist Uzbekistan, until they found refuge in Iran.\" The Times noted \u201cTehran Children suggests pathways for further research into a wide range of topics,\u201d including American Jewish leadership during World War II. the Jewish Agency in Palestine, Polish- Jewish relations, and Bukharan Jewish communities, along with questions about the psychology of survival. \"'Tehran children [is] not simply another detail of the Holocaust but a matter of enduring existential, psychological and moral reflection.\" Reviewers have drawn comparisons between the events recorded in Tehran Children and the experience of child refugees around the world through the present day. The Guardian writes: \u201cwhat makes Dekel\u2019s study so valuable is not just its assiduous detailing of one family\u2019s fate during the second world war, but how it also makes us reflect on our current era, with its mass migrations of desperate people fleeing conflict and hardship only to meet inflamed nativism and the desire to shift responsibility for their fate from one country on to the next.\u201d Tehran Children is a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize in 2020. ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Books about the Holocaust ",
