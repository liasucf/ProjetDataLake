He was most recently the manager of Boldklubben Frem As player he played for B 1903, Cercle Brugge, FC Lorient and Akademisk Boldklub and played two caps for the Danish national football team. As manager he has managed Akademisk Boldklub a couple of times, but he is most famous for his controversies with FC Copenhagen chairman Flemming \u00d8stergaard and former chairman of Akademisk Boldklub, Per Frimann. The first controversy was about Andersen being fired as manager of FC Copenhagen after only one match, and the other because Andersen in his autobiography called Frimann the reason why AB had had economic problems. Frimann began talking about a possible lawsuit, but this was solved, when Andersen made a public apology.Thomas Mikkel Mortensen, \"Christian Andersen siger undskyld\", Berlingske Tidende, November 20, 2004 ==References== ==External links== *Danish national team profile Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Denmark under-21 international footballers Category:Danish football managers Category:Royale Union Saint-Gilloise players Category:Cercle Brugge K.S.V. players Category:FC Lorient players Category:Akademisk Boldklub players Category:Akademisk Boldklub managers Category:F.C.
