The film centres on the interaction between \u00c1ila (Tailfeathers), an indigenous woman with a stable and happy domestic life, and Rosie (Violet Nelson), a more impoverished First Nations woman who has just been a victim of domestic abuse, after they meet in the street. The majority of the film consists of one long, unbroken shot. The film premiered at the 2019 Berlin Film Festival in the Generation program, and had its Canadian premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. It was nominated for six Canadian Screen Awards, including Best Motion Picture, and won three, including Best Director. == Plot == The film opens with a series of vignettes introducing Rosie (Violet Nelson) and \u00c1ila (Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers). Rosie is a young expectant mother living with her violent boyfriend and his mother. \u00c1ila visits a doctor to have an IUD inserted. After her appointment \u00c1ila encounters Rosie, battered and barefoot in the rain, having just fled her boyfriend, who is fast approaching down the street. \u00c1ila, unsure of what to do, offers Rosie shelter in her nearby apartment. Once inside, Rosie remains on the defensive, hesitant to hand over her clothes to dry. While changing in the bathroom, she steals \u00c1ila\u2019s anxiety medication, and later her wallet. Rosie slowly opens up, revealing that she was recently phased out of foster care, but remains adamant they not call the police. \u00c1ila insists they should at least find a women\u2019s shelter for Rosie to spend the night. She eventually agrees to consider an abuse safe house, but only if \u00c1ila comes with her and they make a stop on the way, although she avoids saying where or why. On the way, Rosie becomes good-humoured, telling the cab driver she and \u00c1ila are sisters, and that \u00c1ila is on her way to enter in rehab for her drinking, much to \u00c1ila\u2019s bemusement. She tells the story of their father dying, possibly mirroring her own truth. At Rosie\u2019s stop, \u00c1ila secretly follows her into an apartment complex, and witnesses her exchanging the anxiety medication for cash. Back in the cab, \u00c1ila quietly confronts Rosie over the drug exchange, who turns hostile and accuses \u00c1ila of looking down on her. As they reach the safe house, \u00c1ila refuses to go in with Rosie until she tells the truth. Rosie insists she was only selling, not using, and pays for the cab after \u00c1ila realizes her wallet is gone. The two are greeted by Cat (Charlie Hannah) and Sophie (Barbara Eve Harris). \u00c1ila explains what happened, and Rosie details some of her boyfriend\u2019s abuse, but restates that she won\u2019t go the police, due to him being on bail, and her belief that they won\u2019t treat her with respect. She also does not wish to join her grandparents in Port Hardy, for fear of being judged as a young single mother. Sophie and Cat offer Rosie a room at the safe house for as long as she needs, and access to social services. After a moment alone with her unborn child in the bathroom, Rosie tells the others that she wants to return home to her boyfriend, downplaying the abuse she shared earlier, and insisting that he won\u2019t be angry if she returns right away. On the way out, Sophie assures the frustrated \u00c1ila that it\u2019s normal for victims of abuse to need several tries before gaining the courage to leave their abuser, and gives \u00c1ila money for the taxi. \u00c1ila and Rosie share a quiet ride back to Rosie\u2019s apartment. Rosie asks \u00c1ila if she\u2019s mad at her. \u00c1ila says she\u2019s not, and tells Rosie she\u2019ll be a good mother. Rosie says \u00c1ila will too. At the apartment, \u00c1ila tearfully watches Rosie walk away before driving off as night falls over East Vancouver. == Production == The film's title comes from an essay by Billy-Ray Belcourt. The story is based on a personal experience of Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers. Production of the film involved an indigenous youth mentorship program, funded through Telus Storyhive, which placed 11 young First Nations filmmakers within each department as mentees. === Real-time transitioning technique === The directors initially intended for the film to play as one continuous, real-time shot in order to create a heightened state of immediacy for both the actors and the audience. When cinematographer Norm Li suggested shooting on 16 mm film, they were faced with an 11 minute limit due to the size of 16mm film magazines. To circumvent this, he orchestrated a system dubbed \"Real-Time Transitioning\" in which, at planned cut points, he would hand off the spent camera to an assistant, and be handed another to continue filming; the two shots would then be stitched together in editing. In total, 12 cut points are hidden for the final film. This also allowed the editor, Christian Siebenherz, to blend different takes together from the 5 days of shooting. == Reception == === Critical reception === The film was critically acclaimed upon release. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 8.33/10. The website's consensus reads, \"The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open uses an encounter between two strangers as the catalyst for a thoughtful drama as poetic as its title.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 8 critics. ===Accolades=== At TIFF, the film received an honourable mention from the Best Canadian Film award jury. It was subsequently screened at the imagineNATIVE Film and Media Arts Festival, where it won the award for Best Dramatic Feature, and at the Vancouver International Film Festival, where it received the Best BC Film Award and the BC Emerging Filmmaker Award. On December 11, the film was named to TIFF's annual year-end Canada's Top Ten list. In January 2020, the film was named the winner of the Vancouver Film Critics Circle Award for Best Canadian Film, and of the Toronto Film Critics Association's Rogers Best Canadian Film Award. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=6| Canadian Screen Awards | rowspan=\"6\" | 28 May 2020 | Best Motion Picture | Tyler Hagan, Lori Lozinski | | rowspan=\"6\" | |- | Best Director | rowspan=\"2\" | Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers, Kathleen Hepburn | |- | Best Original Screenplay | |- | rowspan=\"2\" | Best Actress | Violet Nelson | |- | Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers | |- | Best Cinematography | Norm Li | |- !scope=\"row\" | Festival du nouveau cin\u00e9ma | 7\u201318 October 2020 | Grand Prix ! | | |- !scope=\"row\" | imagineNATIVE Film and Media Arts Festival | 22\u201327 October 2019 | Best Dramatic Feature ! | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Online Film Critics Society | 6 January 2020 | Best Non-Theatrical Releases ! | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Toronto Film Critics Association | 8 December 2019 | Best Canadian Film | rowspan=\"4\" | Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers, Kathleen Hepburn | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=5| Vancouver Film Critics Circle | rowspan=\"5\" | 16 December 2019 | Best Canadian Film | | rowspan=\"5\" | |- | Best British Columbia Film | |- | Best Director of a Canadian Film | |- | Best Actress in a Canadian Film | Violet Nelson | |- | One to Watch | Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Vancouver International Film Festival | rowspan=\"2\" | 24 September\u20139 October 2019 | Best BC Film | Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers, Kathleen Hepburn | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | BC Emerging Filmmaker | Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2019 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Films directed by Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers Category:Films directed by Kathleen Hepburn Category:First Nations films Category:2019 drama films Category:Films set in Vancouver Category:Films shot in Vancouver ",
