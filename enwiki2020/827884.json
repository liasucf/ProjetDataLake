The club plays at the national Rheinpark Stadion, which has a capacity of 5,873 when all seated but has additional standing places in the North and South ends of the ground, giving a total stadium capacity of 7,838.Facts & Figures FC Vaduz They currently play in the Swiss Super League following promotion from the Swiss Challenge League after the 2019\u201320 season. Vaduz is unique in that it represents its own national association in the UEFA Europa League when winning the domestic cup, whilst playing in another country's league. This is due to Liechtenstein not organising its own league. Vaduz have historically had many players from Liechtenstein, many of whom have played for the Liechtenstein national team, but nearly all these players have moved abroad, and now the majority of the first team squad are foreign players from different areas of the world. The signing of experienced goalkeeper Peter Jehle from Tours and Franz Burgmeier from Darlington boosted the Liechtensteiner contingent to six by the start of the 2009\u201310 season.Squad FC Vaduz ==History== Chart of FC Vaduz table positions in the Swiss football league system Fussball Club Vaduz was founded on 14 February 1932 in Vaduz, and the club's first chairman was Johann Walser. FC Vaduz is the only professional football club in Liechtenstein. In its first training match, which Vaduz played in Balzers on 24 April of that year, the newly-born team emerged as 2\u20131 winners. The club played in Vorarlberger Football Association in Austria for the 1932\u201333 season. In 1933, Vaduz began playing in Switzerland. Over the years Vaduz struggled through various tiers of Swiss football and won its first Liechtensteiner Cup in 1949. Vaduz enjoyed a lengthy stay in the Swiss 1. Liga from 1960 to 1973, which is the third tier of the Swiss football league system. Vaduz has been required to pay a fee to the Swiss Football Association in order to participate as a foreign club, around \u00a3150,000 a year. There have been calls for this agreement to be revoked, but discussions have meant that a permanent arrangement has now taken place for a Liechtenstein representative to be allowed to participate in the Challenge League or Super League in future. From the 2001\u201302 season, Vaduz played in the Swiss Challenge League (formerly called Nationalliga B), the second tier of the Swiss league system. Since then, Vaduz have been one of the best teams in the Challenge League and gave serious challenges towards promotion to the Super League, especially in 2004 and 2005, playing two-leg play-offs in both cases. In the 2007\u201308 season, Vaduz secured promotion to the Swiss Super League on 12 May 2008 by winning the Challenge League on the final day of the season, giving Liechtenstein a representative at the highest level of Swiss football for the first time. Vaduz, however, were relegated back to the Challenge League after one season in the top flight. Vaduz finally returned to top level after five years in the Challenge League. In May 2010, the two Liechtenstein teams FC Vaduz and USV Eschen/Mauren decided on a better cooperation, especially on the exchange and the development possibilities of the players of both teams. In principle, the agreement should replace the missing substructure at FC Vaduz and promote cooperation in the sense of Liechtenstein football. FC Vaduz is the first address for professional footballers. In 1992, Vaduz qualified for European football for the first time, entering the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as Liechtenstein Cup winners, but lost 12\u20131 on aggregate to Chornomorets Odesa of Ukraine in the qualifying round. In 1996, Vaduz qualified for the first round proper with their first European victory, winning 5\u20133 on penalties against Universitate Riga of Latvia, after a 2\u20132 aggregate scoreline, although Vaduz lost their first round tie to Paris Saint-Germain of France 7\u20130 on aggregate. After the Cup Winners' Cup was abolished, Vaduz have annually entered the UEFA Cup (now the UEFA Europa League) as a result of winning the Liechtenstein Cup every year since 1998, except 2012. However, they have never got past the qualifying rounds to date. However, Vaduz did come within one second of reaching the first round proper of the UEFA Cup in 2002. With the aggregate scores level, and with opponents Livingston scheduled to go through on away goals, Vaduz won a late corner. The ball was sent into the box, and Marius Zarn hit a goal-bound shot. However, the referee (Luke Harrington) blew the whistle for full-time just before the ball crossed over the line, and Livingston progressed through in controversial circumstances. For the 2005\u201306 season, Mats Gren was a coach. In the first round of the 2005\u201306 UEFA Cup qualifying, FC Vaduz defeated Moldovan opponent FC Dacia Chi\u015fin\u0103u. In the second round they met the Istanbul club Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K., against which they have been eliminated. FC Vaduz started their European campaign in 2009\u201310 by beating Scottish side Falkirk in the second qualifying round of the Europa League. However, they lost 3\u20130 on aggregateFC Vaduz \u2013 FC Slovan Liberec : 0\u20131 Match report from Scorespro.comFC Slovan Liberec \u2013 FC Vaduz : 2\u20130 Match report from Scorespro.com to Czech side Slovan Liberec in the third qualifying round. In the 2014\u201315 Swiss Super League season, Vaduz survived for the first time in their history in the Swiss Super League. They finished in 9th place with 31 points won. They also won their 43rd Liechtenstein cup, becoming world record holders of a domestic cup in the process. In season 2015\u201316 FC Vaduz started their European campaign in the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League by beating S.P. La Fiorita from San Marino in the first qualifying round of the Europa League. In the second round, Vaduz progressed against N\u00f5mme Kalju FC to progress into the third qualifying round of the Europa League where they were drawn against fellow Swiss Super League club FC Thun. FC Thun won 2\u20132 on the away goals rule. Vaduz won their domestic cup for the forty-fourth time and were eighth in the Swiss Super League. They won a team record thirty-six points. Vaduz player Armando Sadiku represented Albania at Euro 2016. The team appeared for the first time appear in a popular sports video game FIFA 17. This is the first time in history that a team from Liechtenstein appeared in the sports video game series. After three years in the elite Swiss competition, the only and most awarded Liechtenstein team relegated. It was not a good season 2016\u201317, where they even changed the coach Giorgio Contini after almost 5 years at the helm, and in his place came the German coach Roland Vrabec, but Vaduz has not succeeded to survive in Swiss Super League. On 5 September 2018, they terminated the agreement with Roland Vrabec. On September 17, they presented a new coach Mario Frick. He is a first coach from Liechtenstein in history. In season 2019\u201320 FC Vaduz started their European campaign in the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League by beating Brei\u00f0ablik from Iceland in the first qualifying round of the Europa League. In the second round, Vaduz caused a shock by knocking out Hungarian side MOL Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. In the third qualifying round of the Europa League they played against Eintracht Frankfurt. The Bundesliga team easily won both matches. However, those matches were historic for the club. In first match in Vaduz were 5,908 spectators and the entire city has a population of 5,521. ==Legal status== Vaduz is one of several expatriate European football clubs, including Swansea City and Cardiff City playing in the English Football League, AS Monaco playing in France, San Marino Calcio playing in Italy and some other minor clubs doing likewise in different leagues. The difference between Vaduz and the aforementioned clubs is that its status in Switzerland is a \"guest club\", and as such it does not participate in the Swiss Cup and cannot represent Switzerland internationally, which makes Champions League qualification from league football impossible under current rules other than by winning the Europa League or the Champions League itself. Since Vaduz has never finished higher than 8th in the Super League and therefore could not be argued to have qualified, such a situation has not occurred. ==Rheinpark Stadion== Main stand of the Rheinpark Stadion with Vaduz Castle in the background. Rheinpark Stadion The Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz is the national stadium of Liechtenstein. It plays host to the home matches of the Liechtenstein national football team, and is also the home of Liechtenstein's top football club, FC Vaduz. It lies on the banks of the River Rhine, just metres from the border with Switzerland. The stadium has a fully seated capacity of 5,873, plus additional standing places, giving it a total capacity of 7,584. The building of the stadium cost roughly 19 million CHF. The stadium was officially opened on 31 July 1998 with a match between FC Vaduz, the Liechtenstein Cup holders at the time, and 1. FC Kaiserslautern, the then Bundesliga champions. Kaiserslautern won the match 8\u20130. Liverpool F.C. played here against Olympiacos F.C. in a friendly in 2005. Rheinpark Stadion hosted the likes of FC Chornomorets Odesa and Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in this tournament but failed to progress past the qualification rounds. The construction of the stadium became necessary because the FIFA World governing body FIFA and the European association UEFA threatened not to allow more European and international matches in Liechtenstein if the country did not provide a modern venue in accordance with international standards. In Liechtenstein, no own championship is played, but a cup competition is organized. Its series winner FC Vaduz is therefore represented in the Europa League almost every year. The national team has not been represented in any major competition such as the World or European Championship, but in the qualifications to do so. Rheinpark Stadion sits less than 1 km west of Vaduz city centre on the eastern bank of the Rhein River. Vaduz holds the distinction of being one of the few capitals in the world to lack its own airport and railway station. Rheinpark Stadion consists of four stands: North, East, South and West. There are a limited number of free parking spaces located at Rheinpark Stadion on matchdays which are allocated on a first-come first-served basis. ==Current sponsorship== Companies that FC Vaduz currently has sponsorship deals with include: * Liechtensteinische Landesbank \u2013 main sponsor * MBPI AG \u2013 main sponsor * Puma \u2013 kit manufacturer * Accurata Treuhand und Revisions AG \u2013 official sponsor * Brauerei Sch\u00fctzengarten AG \u2013 official sponsor * Heim Bohrtechnik AG \u2013 official sponsor * Kibernetik AG \u2013 official sponsor * Hirslanden Private Hospital Group \u2013 medical partner * Orthop\u00e4die St. Gallen \u2013 medical partner ==Honours== ===Domestic competitions=== * Liechtenstein Football Championship :File:Cup Winner.png Winners (1): 1936 * Liechtenstein Football Cup :File:Cup Winner.png Winners (47) (World Record): 1948\u201349, 1951\u201352, 1952\u201353, 1953\u201354, 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, 1959\u201360, 1960\u201361, 1962, 1965\u201366, 1966\u201367, 1967\u201368, 1968\u201369, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371, 1973\u201374, 1979\u201380, 1984\u201385, 1986, 1987\u201388, 1989\u201390, 1991\u201392, 1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 1997\u201398, 1998\u201399, 1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301, 2001\u201302, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2010\u201311, 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315, 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319 ::File:Cup Finalist.png Runners-up (13): 1945\u201346, 1946\u201347, 1947\u201348, 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351, 1954\u201355, 1971\u201372, 1976\u201377, 1983\u201384, 1986\u201387, 1990\u201391, 1996\u201397, 2011\u201312 ===Switzerland competitions=== * Swiss Challenge League (2nd tier) :File:Cup Winner.png Winners (3): 2002\u201303, 2007\u201308, 2013\u201314 ::File:Cup Finalist.png Runners-up (3): 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305, 2019\u201320 ==European record== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
