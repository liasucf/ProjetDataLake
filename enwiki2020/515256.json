    "text": "Balsam is the resinous exudate (or sap) which forms on certain kinds of trees and shrubs. Balsam (from Latin balsamum \"gum of the balsam tree\", ultimately from Semitic, Aramaic busma, Arabic balsam and Hebrew basam, \"spice\", \"perfume\") owes its name to the biblical Balm of Gilead. Balsamum tolutanum, Myroxylon balsamum Myroxylon, the source of Balsam of Peru and Balsam of Tolu, is a genus of tree grown in Central America and South America. Pictured Myroxylon peruiferum. == Chemistry == Balsam is a solution of plant-specific resins in plant-specific solvents (essential oils). Such resins can include resin acids, esters, or alcohols. The exudate is a mobile to highly viscous liquid and often contains crystallized resin particles. Over time and as a result of other influences the exudate loses its liquidizing components or gets chemically converted into a solid material (i.e. by autoxidation). Some authors require balsams to contain benzoic or cinnamic acid or their esters. Plant resins are sometimes classified according to other plant constituents in the mixture, for example as: * pure resins (guaiac, hashish), * gum-resins (containing gums/polysaccharides), * oleo-gum-resins (a mixture of gums, resins and essential oils), * oleo-resins (a mixture of resins and essential oils, e. g. capsicum, ginger and aspidinol), * balsams (resinous mixtures that contain cinnamic and/or benzoic acid or their esters), * glycoresins (podophyllin, jalap, kava kava), * fossil resins (amber, asphaltite, Utah resin). Usually, animal secretions (musk, shellac, beeswax) are excluded from this definition. == The Balsam of Matariyya == The Balsam of Matariyya was a substance famous as a panacea among physicians in the Middle East and Europe during the Antique and Medieval periods. The substance has long been used as a medicine, with early references to the substance recorded as far back as 285 BC. The Balsam of Matariyya was said to be derived from an Egyptian plant and is sometimes also referred to as the balm of Gilead or the balm of Mecca. == List of balsams == * Acaroid resin (Xanthorrhoea sp.) * Acouchi balsam (Protium sp.) * Ammoniacum * Asafoetida (Laser) * Balm of Gilead * Balm of Mecca * Balsam fir - Abies balsamea * Balsam of Peru * Balsam of Tolu * Balsam Specific * Bisabol * Bdellium * Benzoin resin * Bukhoor * Cabreuva balsam (Myrocarpus frondosus, Myrocarpus fastigatus) * Camphor * Canada balsam * Chinese lacquer (Japanese lacquer) * Copaiba balsam * Copal * Corneiba balsam (Schinus terebinthifolius or Lithraea brasiliensis) * Damar * Dragon's blood (Calamus draco) * Elemi * Frankincense (Olibanum) * Galbanum * Guayac (Guaiacum officinale) * Guggul * Gurjun balsam * Imbauba balsam (Cecropia adenopus) * Labdanum * Mastic * Myrrh * Obira balsam (Apocynaceae) * Opopanax * Umiri balsam (Humiria floribunda) * Rosin (Colophony) * Sagapenum * Sandarac * Sarcocolla * Storax balsam * Turpentine * Venice turpentine (Larch turpentine) (Larix europaea) * Wallaba balsam (Eperua sp.) == Safety == Some balsams, such as Balsam of Peru, may be associated with allergies. In particular, Euphorbia latex (\"wolf's milk\") is strongly irritant and is cytotoxic. == See also == * Basamum == References == Category:Resins Category:Plant products ",
