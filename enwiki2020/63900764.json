He was a son of Wilhelm von Pourtal\u00e8s (1815\u20131889) and Charlotte Luise Auguste Gr\u00e4fin von Maltzan zu Wartenberg und Penzlin. His father spent a number of years in Venice creating a collection of Renaissance sculpture, which included works by Jacopo Sansovino and Andrea Riccio, and paintings by old Italian masters. His siblings included Louise de Pourtal\u00e8s (who died aged 29 in 1879), Johanna Albertine Antoinette de Pourtal\u00e8s (wife of Bernard von Jagow-Calberwisch) and Rosa Margarete Guillemette Mathilde Auguste von Pourtal\u00e8s (wife of Moritz von Hohenthal). Among his extended family were uncles Count Guillaume von Pourtal\u00e8s and Count Albert von Pourtal\u00e8s (a member of the Prussian House of Lords who was appointed the Prussian Minister to France by William I and was succeeded by future Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1861). His family, who were originally Swiss, were Protestant bankers. The Pourtal\u00e8s title was created in 1750 by the King of Prussia Frederick William II. He was also a cousin of Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Chancellor of the German Empire and Minister President of Prussia from 1907 to 1917. Another cousin was Count James Pourtal\u00e8s, who previously owned the family estate and went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. ==Career== Formal and informal military and diplomatic connections in 1914 with the Triple Alliance (brown) and the Triple Entente (green) Pourtal\u00e8s was Prussian Minister to the Kingdom of Bavaria in Munich (under Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria) until 1907, and conducted diplomacy in the style of the grand seigneur, holding posts in Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands and France. When Pourtal\u00e8s arrived in St. Petersburg, he came with seventeen vanloads of furniture. Pourtal\u00e8s succeeded Count Monts as the German Ambassador to the Russian Empire in Saint Petersburg from 1907 (when Russia went into a coalition with Britain and France, known as the Triple Entente, and formed as a counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria- Hungary, and Italy) until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. While Ambassador, Wilhelm von Mirbach served as the embassy clerk. Pourtal\u00e8s was deeply involved in the 1914 July Crisis, which was a series of interrelated diplomatic and military escalations among the major powers of Europe in the summer of 1914 that ultimately led to the Great War and started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro- Hungarian throne. Pourtal\u00e8s handed Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov Germany's declaration of war. In his obituary, the New York Times wrote that Pourtal\u00e8s \"supported the official German explanation of the cause of the World War. He asserted the innocence of his country and expressed belief that the Czar had been forced into war against his will by the Russian war party. He believed that the surest guarantee of peace would have been an alliance of Germany, Russia and France, which he said the Kaiser and the Czar tried to accomplish. He was one of those who accepted the theory that England had been feverishly pushing a policy of encirclement of the Central Powers. ==Personal life== Schloss Glumbowitz He was married to Gisela Elisabeth Kordelia Maria Charlotte Maximiliane Rahel Josepha Gr\u00e4fin von Kanitz (1873\u20131957), the daughter of Georg von Kanitz and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boniface Pauline Luise Gr\u00e4fin von Hatzfeldt zu Trachenberg. Her maternal grandparents were Pauline de Castellane and Count Maximilian von Hatzfeldt, who spent ten years from 1849 to 1859 as the German Minister to France and who signed the Treaty of Paris in 1856 which ended the Crimean War. After her grandfather's death, her grandmother remarried to Louis de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, duc de Valen\u00e7ay, 3rd duc de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord. Her aunt Margarete was the wife of the Ambassador Anton Saurma von der Jeltsch. Count von Pourtal\u00e8s died on 3 May 1928 at Bad Nauheim, Germany. ===Residences=== In 1824, his grandfather Count Karl von Pourtal\u00e8s (who married Marie Louise Elisabeth de Castellane), a Royal Counselor, purchased the estate of Schloss Glumbowitz which included a classicist palace. Friedrich later owned the palace which he filled with \"numerous works of art\" that were gifted to him by his father. Pourtal\u00e8s also owned a country estate, Villa Mettlen, in the municipality of Muri bei Bern in Bern, Switzerland. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources Category:1853 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Pourtal\u00e8s family Category:People of the German Empire Category:German diplomats Category:German people of World War I Pourtal\u00e8s ",
