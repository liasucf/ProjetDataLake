The area is about 100 meters wide and 250 meters long, composed of an estimated 35,000 columns of basalt rocks. The rocks are dark lava columns with roughly flat surfaces of different shapes - round, pentagon, hexagon, polygon etc. Ghenh Da Dia looks like a gigantic beehive or a pile of dinner plates, hence the name \u2013 Ghenh Da Dia (The Sea Cliff of Stone Plates). These rock columns were created from volcanic eruptions millions of years ago; when the molten basalt flows met cold water, they solidified and shaped these rare polygonal formations due to thermal contraction effects. Ganh Da Dia was enlisted as a National Heritage site in January 1998 by Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. ==See also== * Giant's Causeway, a similar site in Northern Ireland ==References== *http://english.vov.vn/Travel/Places/Rock-masterpiece-at-Ghenh-Da-Dia-in-Phu- Yen-province/281519.vov *https://web.archive.org/web/20150705013114/http://vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/thoi- su/du-lich/ky-quan-ghenh-da-dia-2162897.html *http://news.zing.vn/Ghenh-Da- Dia-Phu-Yen-Dau-chan-thien-duong-post458851.html Category:Tourist attractions in Vietnam Category:Geology of Vietnam Category:Volcanism of Southeast Asia ",
