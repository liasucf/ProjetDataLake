    "text": "The 1917 Auckland Rugby League season was its 9th. Due to the large number of players now serving in the First World War it was agreed to relax transfer rules to allow players from stronger teams to join weaker teams to even the competition. It was noted how many men from various clubs had been killed in battle by the beginning of 1917. They were Cecil Walker, Doug Dawson, T Marshall (Grafton Athletic), Charles Savory, T McWhirter, G Cook, N Vause, V McCollum, Alf Gault, T Lambert, E Tiernan, F Stubbs, W. G. Handle (Ponsonby United), B Hart, F Gladding, A Powley, Chas Mann (North Shore Albions), William Moeki, G Jones, W Harris, S Magee, S Greer (City Rovers), A Miller, C Sinton, and L O'Leary (Sunnyside). City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone. Ponsonby had also had over eighty of its member join the war effort. Thirty three teams entered the six grades. This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that Otahuhu was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. Grafton Athletic also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason. Ponsonby United won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over City Rovers in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same season following on the footsteps of City Rovers who had won both titles the year prior. == Representative season == At the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious Auckland Rugby Union club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with Ponsonby United and City Rovers at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with Grafton Athletic. == Victoria Park == In 1916 the fence around Victoria Park had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as Carlaw Park with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future. ==First grade championship== Twenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both Otahuhu and Grafton Athletic were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort. After their Round 4 default to North Shore where only two Otahuhu players turned up they decided to amalgamate senior teams with Grafton. This was short lived however as Grafton themselves only lasted until Round 7 when they themselves defaulted a week later. Ponsonby United were crowned champions for the first time in their existence. ===Final standings and fixtures=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld !width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W !width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D !width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L !width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F !width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A !width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ponsonby United |8||7||0||1||109||51||14 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Newton Rangers |9||6||0||3||153||77||12 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|City Rovers |9||6||0||3||110||71||12 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|North Shore Albions |9||4||0||5||84||91||8 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Grafton Athletic |7||0||0||7||21||144||0 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Otahuhu |4||0||0||4||12||55||0 |- |} ==== Round 1 ==== ==== Round 2 ==== ==== Round 3 ==== ==== Round 4 ==== ==== Round 5 ==== ==== Round 6 ==== ==== Round 7 ==== Grafton continued to struggle to put out a competitive team and played 3 men short against Newton. ==== Round 8 ==== The unknown try for Ponsonby in their win over North Shore was described in the New Zealand Herald match report as \u201ca fierce combined rally resulted in the pack taking the ball over for a try\u201d. Grafton defaulted their match with City and this ended their season as they were unable to field a side for any further competitive matches. ==== Round 9 ==== ==== Round 10 ==== On 21 July Ponsonby played a match versus the Waterside Workers after both Otahuhu and Grafton had left the competition. Ponsonby won the match by 14 points to 3. ===Roope Rooster knockout competition=== After both Otahuhu and Grafton Athletic had dropped out of the senior grade there were only 4 senior teams left. However the Waterside Workers formed a team and played a match versus Ponsonby during the season, and they also played in the first round of the Roope Rooster. Following the conclusion of the Roope Rooster competition on 25 August a benefit match was played between City Rovers and Newton Rangers at Victoria Park. It was won by City 31 points to 11. On 1 September City defeated Ponsonby in another exhibition match, described as \u201cone of the fastest and most exciting matches this season\u201d by 13 points to 12 at Victoria Park. ==== Round 1 ==== ==== Semi final ==== ==== Final ==== ===Top try scorers and point scorers=== The following point scoring lists include both Senior Championship matches and the Roope Rooster competition. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries |- |1||George Iles||Newton Rangers||12 |- |2||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||7 |- |3||S Jones||Ponsonby United||6 |- |3||Bill Williams||Newton Rangers||6 |- |5||C Nicholson||North Shore||5 |- |6||Stan Walters||North Shore||4 |- |6||L Boon||North Shore||4 |- |6||Len Farrant||Newton Rangers||4 |- |6||R Clarke||City Rovers||4 |- |6||Artie Rae||Ponsonby United||4 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!DG!!Points |- |1||A Cross||Ponsonby United||2||12||8||1||0||48 |- |2||C Potier||Newton Rangers||1||12||8||1||1||47 |- |3||George Iles||Newton Rangers||12||3||0||0||0||42 |- |4||Ernie Asher||City Rovers||2||10||4||0||0||34 |- |5||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||7||4||0||0||0||29 |- |6||Nicholson||North Shore||5||3||0||0||0||21 |- |7||S Jones||North Shore||6||0||0||0||0||18 |- |7||Bill Williams||Newton Rangers||6||0||0||0||0||18 |- |} ==Senior exhibition and charity matches== ===Mackrell Memorial=== On 8 September a combined match was played between Ponsonby-Shore and Newton-City with the proceeds devoted to a memorial to the late William Mackrell. This was a premonition of the future with City and Newton several decades later actually combining clubs. ===Gala match in the Auckland Domain=== On 15 September a gala day was held with Rugby League and Football (\u201cAssociation\u201d) played to raise money for the RSA. It was declared a success and 200 pounds was raised. The match was played between Ponsonby United who had won the league championship and a combined team from the remainder of the clubs in the senior grade (City Rovers, Newton Rangers, and North Shore Albions). The combined team won by 26 to 21. The day also featured a sprint race between 6 players from the senior teams. It was won by Nicholson of the North Shore Albions. A \u2018house match\u2019 was also played between Hobson Hotel and Thompson and Hill's which Hobson Hotel won by 23 points to 3 . ===Exhibition matches=== City and Ponsonby United played an exhibition match on 24 September at Victoria Park. On 29 September a very controversial cross code match was played between Railway (a combination of Marist Brothers Old Boys and City) who were the winners of the Auckland Rugby Union competition, and Ponsonby, the Auckland Rugby League club champions. The match was not sanctioned by the Auckland Rugby Union as Railway was also scheduled to play an annual charity rugby union match versus University on the same day. The Railway team playing the league code had \u201cgone over to the Northern Union game\u201d. They played a further match against City Rovers which they lost by 18 points to 6 before moving to the Auckland Rugby League full-time in 1918. They would eventually amalgamate with Grafton Athletic and in 1919 they would reform as the Marist Rugby League Old Boys club\u201d. ===Other club matches and lower grades=== ====Lower grade clubs==== Manukau, Remuera and Riverhead did not field teams in any grades in 1917. Richmond were being named as Richmond Rovers in the newspaper reports for the first time. *Northcote Ramblers *Post and Telegraph (affiliated with the Ponsonby United club) *Pupuke *Richmond Rovers *Sunnyside *Thames Old Boys ==Representative fixture== Auckland played a match against a Military Representative side representing the Trentham, Featherston, and Tauherenikau camps at the Auckland Domain on 13 October. A large crowd attended and the total proceeds of the game were devoted to the Red Cross. === Auckland v Military Representatives === ===Auckland matches played and scorers=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !No!!Name!!Club Team!!Play!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||1||2||0||0||6 |- |2||Thomas McClymont||Ponsonby United||1||1||0||0||3 |- |2||Thomas||Newton Rangers||1||1||0||0||3 |- |2||C Mitchell||City Rovers||1||1||0||0||3 |- |2||Sam Lowrie||Ponsonby United||1||1||0||0||3 |- |2||Maurice Wetherill||City Rovers||1||1||0||0||3 |- |7||A Cross||Ponsonby United||1||0||1||0||2 |- |8||Stewart||North Shore Albions||1||0||0||0||0 |- |8||J Hogan||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |8||Jim Rukutai||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |8||R Clarke||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |8||George Seagar||North Shore Albions||1||0||0||0||0 |- |8||George Paki||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Auckland Rugby League Official Site Category:Auckland Rugby League seasons Auckland Rugby League ",
