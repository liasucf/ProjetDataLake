Production was handled by Divine Styler, Bryan Velasco, Everlast, Evidence, RichGains, Dj Skizz and the Alchemist. It features contributions from Maiya Sykes on backing vocals, Corey Cofield on bass, Philip Fisher of Fishbone on drums, and Artyom Manukyan on cello, with guest appearances by fellow rappers Aloe Blacc of Emanon, Slug of Atmosphere, and beatboxer Rahzel. The album debuted at number 21 on the Billboard Americana/Folk Albums chart and at number 15 on the Independent Albums chart in the United States, at number 77 on the German Albums Chart and at number 18 on the Swiss Albums Chart. == Background == In an August 2018 interview with Stereogum, Everlast stated, regarding referencing his former group House of Pain in the album title, \"I don\u2019t plan them out too much. Especially album titles, they just kind of happen. That one is again trying to figure out what the record was, it\u2019s just kind of like to me it just represents everything I\u2019ve ever done.\" Later in the interview, when asked about House of Pain last touring in 2017, he stated \"We brought it back a couple times for fun and it's just... it's just done. I can't do it anymore [...] We\u2019ve only gotten together twice in the last 15 years and that was for the 20th anniversary and then for the 25th anniversary. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing it for the 30th anniversary. I\u2019m done.\" He also explained: \"Another reason I called the album [Whitey Ford's House Of Pain] is because it's kind of a way [to] say, 'this is all that's left'\". == Track listing == == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} == References == Category:2018 albums Category:Everlast (musician) albums Category:Albums produced by Evidence (musician) ",
