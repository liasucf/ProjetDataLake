    "text": "Port Melbourne is a railway station in the Melbourne suburb of the same name located on the former Port Melbourne line, the first significant railway in Australia. The station was opened in 1854 to carry passengers arriving at Station Pier to Flinders Street station. The railway line was closed in 1987 to be converted to light rail, currently route 109. The station building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is located north of Beach Street and to the east of Canberra Parade, having since been converted into a medical centre and cafe to serve the recent residential developments in the area. ==References== * * *Victorian Railways Port Melbourne Line Rail Diagram Bridge Street to Piers 1919 *Port Melbourne Signal Box 'A' Diagram 1964 Category:Disused railway stations in Melbourne Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1854 Category:Victorian Heritage Register Category:Railway stations closed in 1987 Category:1987 disestablishments in Australia Category:Listed railway stations in Australia ",
