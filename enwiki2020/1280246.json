    "text": "Derrick Allen Mahorn (born September 21, 1958) is an American former professional basketball player who played power forward and center for the Washington Bullets, Detroit Pistons, Philadelphia 76ers, and the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is currently a radio analyst for the Detroit Pistons Pistons Announcers and works as a co- host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio. Mahorn was dubbed by Piston announcer George Blaha the \"Baddest Bad Boy of them all.\" Mahorn gained a reputation for physical play, which he used to compensate for his relatively limited leaping ability. He served as a team leader of the Detroit Bad Boys teams of the late 1980s, winning his only NBA Championship in 1989 along with captain Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, and Dennis Rodman among others. ==College career== Mahorn played college basketball at Hampton University. He was a three-time NAIA All- American and owned 18 school records. He scored 2,418 points while playing for the Pirates, averaging 20.3 points per game he is an amazing basketball player overall and so was his teammates. ==Playing career== The turning point of Mahorn\u2019s career was perhaps when he was traded by the Washington Bullets to the Detroit Pistons. He was unhappy with the trade initially and, as he claimed in a 2014 ESPN documentary, showed up to training camp overweight and out of shape. After teammate Bill Laimbeer took him aside and spoke with him about what he was brought there for, Mahorn acquiesced and became an integral part of the Pistons\u2019 core. In 1989, Mahorn won his only NBA championship with the Pistons. Two days after the Pistons won the championship in 1989, the NBA held an expansion draft for its two newest franchises, the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves. League rules dictated that only eight players on each roster could be protected from being drafted by either team, and the Pistons elected not to extend that protection to Mahorn. As such, he was made the second pick in the expansion draft and the first to be taken by the Timberwolves; the Pistons were conducting their victory celebration in Detroit while the draft was happening and Mahorn was taken aside during the festivities so he could be told. Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey tried to reacquire Mahorn to no avail, and years later Mahorn was shown to still be bothered by what transpired as the story of the trade brought him to tears during the 2014 ESPN film about the team. Mahorn, as it turned out, would never play for Minnesota. After refusing to report to the Timberwolves, he ended up being traded instead to the Philadelphia 76ers, where he teamed with superstar Charles Barkley (despite previous rivalries with him) to form the top-rebounding duo of \"Thump N' Bump.\" After two seasons, Mahorn moved to the Italian Serie A for the 1991\u201392 season. Mahorn later played for the New Jersey Nets for four seasons, before returning to the Pistons in 1996\u201397 under coach Doug Collins. He retired after the 1999 season, after a second stint with the 76ers. In 2018, Mahorn was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame ==Coaching== Mahorn then served as a color commentator for Pistons radio broadcasts, and as an assistant coach under former teammate Bill Laimbeer with the WNBA's Detroit Shock. Laimbeer and Mahorn led the Shock to multiple WNBA titles. On July 22, 2008, at a Sparks-Shock game, Mahorn attempted to break up a brawl. When attempting to restrain Lisa Leslie, he put his left hand out and Leslie fell to the ground. Mahorn was suspended for two games.Arritt, Dan. \"Candace Parker, Lisa Leslie suspended after WNBA fight\". Los Angeles Times. July 25, 2008. On June 15, 2009, he became the head coach of the Shock, a position he held until the franchise moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma after the season. Shortly afterward, Mahorn continued his work with Pistons radio, doing color commentary alongside Mark Champion. In 2017, Mahorn became head coach of Trilogy, the eventual champion of the BIG3 basketball league's inaugural season. His team's players included Al Harrington and Kenyon Martin. ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Washington | 52 || 0 || 13.4
