He courted the famed Gu\u00f0r\u00fan \u00d3sv\u00edfursd\u00f3ttir. Although Gu\u00f0r\u00fan preferred his foster-brother Kjartan \u00d3lafsson, she gave herself to Bolli because of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged to Ingibj\u00f6rg Tryggvad\u00f3ttir, the sister of King \u00d3lafur Tryggvason. Bolli engaged in hostilities with his foster-brother, which ended with him killing Kjartan, and then being killed in turn by Kjartan's kinsmen at the dairy. ==Death and aftermath== Bolli was well known for his skill and his swordsmanship. Prior to the attack, Thorstein the Black said \"however underhanded he may be where he is, you may make up your mind for a brisk defence on his part, strong and skilled at arms as he is. He also has a sword that for a weapon is a trusty one.\"Chapter LV The Death of Bolli Bolli dealt one of his attackers a blow, which clove him through the head to the shoulder, killing him. His second son, Bolli Bollasson, was born the winter after his killing, and his first son Thorleik was only four at the time. They grew up in Holyfell, after his mother Gu\u00f0r\u00fan exchanged homes with the renowned Snorri the Go\u00f0i.Chapter LVI Bolli Bollison is born Gu\u00f0r\u00fan constantly argued for revenge for his killing, but eventually his two sons made peace with the sons of \u00d3laf, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the Thorness Thing; it is not known how much money was exchanged in compensation as part of the agreement, but \"both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs\".Chapter LXXI Peace between the Sons of Bolli and the Sons of Olaf ==Footnotes== ==External links== *Full text and several English translations in the Icelandic Saga Database *Translation in English by Muriel Press (The Temple Classics, London, 1899) *Text with modern Icelandic spelling *Laxd\u00e6la saga in an English translation by Muriel A.
