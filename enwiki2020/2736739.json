    "text": "Matterhorn Peak is located in the Sierra Nevada, in the western U.S. state of California, at the northern boundary of Yosemite National Park. At elevation, it is the tallest peak in the craggy Alps-like Sawtooth Ridge and the northernmost peak in the Sierra Nevada. The peak also supports the Sierra's northernmost glacier system. It was named after the Matterhorn in the Alps. Matterhorn Peak is quite near to Twin Peaks, and just north of Whorl Mountain. The peak can be ascended without climbing gear. ==In popular culture== Jack Kerouac, in The Dharma Bums (1958), describes a hike up and a run down the mountain. This led to the classic observation, \"You can't fall off a mountain.\" == See also == * Hoover Wilderness * Matterhorn == References == == External links == * * In the Footsteps of Jack Kerouac on Matterhorn Peak Category:Mountains of Yosemite National Park Category:Mountains of Mono County, California Category:Mountains of Tuolumne County, California Category:Mountains of Northern California ",
