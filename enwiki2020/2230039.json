Bronze also issued German and Spanish 7\" vinyl versions which had a different sleeves, as well as a Japanese release, with a colour picture insert with song lyrics in English and Japanese. One sided test pressings (not mis- presses, but used in the trade) escaped the pressing plant and are on the market. The song opens with an overdriven bass intro played by Lemmy. For the lyrics, he said he \"used gambling metaphors, mostly cards and dice\u2014when it comes to that sort of thing, I'm more into the one-arm bandits actually, but you can't really sing about spinning fruit, and the wheels coming down\".Kilmister, Lemmy & Garza, Janiss. White Line Fever. Published: 2002, Simon & Schuster (Trade Division). . On 6 September 1980, Lemmy was interviewed by Graham Neale on BBC Radio 1's Rock on Saturday show, \"Bomber\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Love Me Like a Reptile\" were played. The following month, on 6 and 20 October, the band played the song on BBC TV show Top of the Pops.Burridge, Alan. Illustrated Collector's Guide to Mot\u00f6rhead. Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing. . ==Commercial success== The song spent 13 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, and originally peaked at number 15 upon its initial release. At the midweek point in January 2016 it reached No. 9 and in the official Friday chart they reached number 13, following the death of frontman Lemmy in December 2015 and subsequent dissolution of the band. It has sold 208,830 digital copies as of January 2016. It reached the top of the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts on 9 January 2016. ==Critical reception== The song \u2013 which \"put a choke on the British music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed\" \u2013 is considered the definitive Mot\u00f6rhead anthem, albeit not by Lemmy. \"I don't see the song that way at all,\" he said in 2000. \"I believe we've done our best work since Eddie left the band in 1982.\" In March 2005, Q placed it at No. 27 in a list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, stating, \"This song has an intro which wouldn't be out of place ushering in the end of the world.\" In 2009, it was named the tenth greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. In 2014, NME ranked it number 155 in a list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In May 2019, \"Ace of Spades\" was named the favorite poker- themed song in a survey of 1,000 customers of online poker site PokerStars. The song reportedly \"not only won, but crushed\" the other finalist, \"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga. ==Track listing== # \"Ace of Spades\" (Ian Kilmister, Eddie Clarke, Phil Taylor) \u2013 2:49 # \"Dirty Love\" (Kilmister, Clarke, Taylor) \u2013 2:57 == Personnel == * Lemmybass, lead vocals * \"Fast\" Eddie Clarkelead guitar * Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylordrums == Certifications == ==Live version== \"Ace of Spades (live)\" is a 1988 7-inch vinyl release of the song by Mot\u00f6rhead. The single has no picture sleeve; it was issued (and withdrawn) in a plain white paper cover. All three songs on the single appeared on the band's No Sleep at All live album, which was recorded at the Giants of Rock Festival in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland on 2 July 1988. The band had wanted \"Traitor\" as the A-side, but \"Ace of Spades\" was chosen instead, when the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops. So despite the popularity the song had achieved, this single was not as successful as the original version, which reached No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980, as it became only available at gigs and through the Mot\u00f6rheadbangers fan club. The song became a staple of the band's live set, with Lemmy acknowledging that despite becoming \"sick\" of performing it, they \"can't ditch Ace of Spades, it wouldn't be right. If I go to see Little Richard, I expect to hear Good Golly Miss Molly, or I'd be pissed off\". However, Lemmy softened his view on performing Ace of Spades live later on, saying \"I used to have that thought occasionally, but I killed it. \"Ace of Spades\" has been really good to us, and it's one of the best songs that I ever wrote. So I suppose you have to put up with it, because everybody wants to hear it, every night.\" Live versions have appeared on the albums No Sleep 'til Hammersmith (1981), N\u00f6 Sleep at All (1988), Everything Louder than Everyone Else (1999), Live at Brixton Academy (2003), Better Mot\u00f6rhead than Dead: Live at Hammersmith (2007), The W\u00f6rld Is Ours - Vol. 1: Everywhere Further Than Everyplace Else (2011), The W\u00f6rld Is Ours - Vol. 2: Anyplace Crazy as Anywhere Else (2012), and Clean Your Clock (2016). It was the first song that Phil Campbell and W\u00fcrzel played with the band \u2013 on the \"Bambi\" episode of The Young Ones. The lineup is particularly rare until 1987: Lemmy, Campbell, W\u00fcrzel and Taylor. Taylor had already left the band by the time the filming started, but kept to his promise of making the performance. In September 1993, WGAF Records re-released the original 1980s track on CD-single, cassette single, 12\" vinyl picture sleeve and picture disc versions, the song was coupled with \"Louie Louie\", \"Dirty Love\", and \"Ace of Spades (The CCN Remix)\", and although the band were not too pleased with the CCN Remix version, this single peaked at No. 23 in the UK chart. ===Single track listing=== # \"Ace of Spades\" (Lemmy, Eddie Clarke, Phil Taylor) # \"Dogs\" (Lemmy, W\u00fcrzel, Phil Campbell, Taylor) # \"Traitor\" (Lemmy, W\u00fcrzel, Campbell, Taylor) ==Cover versions== * New Zealand alternative rock band Shihad paid tribute to Lemmy's death by covering the song at the Rhythm and Alps festival in 2015. *British metal band Bullet for My Valentine covered the song for a special edition of their album Venom. *Ten American band Widespread Panic covered the song, most recently at a 2017 Halloween run of shows in Las Vegas, Nevada. * \"Ace of Spades\" was covered by Kobra and the Lotus, featuring guest guitarist Rik Emmett.
