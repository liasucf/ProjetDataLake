Wallen also co-wrote songs with other artists, including Saint Asonia (\"Ghost\" and \"Beast\" off Flawed Design), Red (\"Sever\" from Declaration), Pillar (\"Call to Action\" and \"Lose It All\" from Confessions), Fuel (\"Scars in the Making\" from Angels & Devils), Saving Abel (\"She Got Over Me\" from Saving Abel) and Emmaus Road (\"Unbelief\" from Transformed). ==Biography== ===Early years and Copper=== Copper's roots go back to Shady Spring, West Virginia, where Wallen and lead guitarist Shane Bragg had been friends since the first grade. They teamed up for occasional acoustic shows, but only began seriously putting a band together while Wallen was attending college at University of Tennessee in Knoxville and Bragg was enrolled at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. The original lineup included Wallen, Bragg, bass player Brad Reynolds, and a rotating pair of drummers. They recorded Copper's debut album, Exchange (2001). Drummer and singer Brack Owens joined soon after Exchange was released, and a second album, The Fragile Fall, was recorded with producer Travis Wyrick and released in 2003. Bragg then left the band and was replaced by Shawn Lickliter. Owens and Lickiter were later replaced by Lincoln Nesto on drums and Mike Barnes on lead guitar. The first single from The Fragile Fall, \"By Now\" went to Active and Modern Rock radio and entered the top 50 within nine weeks. \"Turn\" was the second single, was also registered on Radio & Records Active \"Most Added\" chart for two straight weeks, and reached the top 50 as well. In support of the album, a music video for a song \"Inside and Out\" was released. In 2005, Copper was selected from 3000 participants as the winner of J. D'Addario, Guitar.com and Fuse \"We're Listening\" contest, resulting in appearance on the Fuse Daily Download in March 2006 and being the centerpiece of D'Addarios television and print campaign. In 2008, Copper released their third album, Take My Chances. It included single \"Broken Sky\" and a song \"Call to Action\", which was covered and re-recorded by a Christian rock band Pillar for their album Confessions in 2009. Soon after the album release, Copper went on hiatus, playing two reunion shows: in 2011 and The Fragile Fall 15th anniversary show in 2018. Copper has played more than 300 shows overall, headlining and supporting bands like Thirty Seconds to Mars, Shinedown, Seether, 10 Years, Breaking Benjamin, and Saliva. ===Adelitas Way and Allies EP=== From 2009 to 2013, Wallen was a guitarist and backing vocalist for Las Vegas, Nevada based rock band Adelitas Way.
