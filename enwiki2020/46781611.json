The concert is available on CD-R and digital download at http://live.brucespringsteen.net. Recorded at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio on August 9, 1978, during the band's Darkness Tour, the show is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the most essential live recordings by Springsteen and the E Street Band. Rolling Stone said of the recording \"This is simply the greatest live LP this greatest of live rockers has ever officially released.\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/bruce-springsteen- the-agora-cleveland-1978-20150113 The show was originally broadcast live on the radio with bootlegs circulating for years but this marks the first official release of the album, completely restored and remastered. ==Background== The concert was sponsored by radio station WMMS as part of their 10th anniversary. WMMS announced the concert on air just 12 days before the show and free tickets were sent to listeners who dropped off a self- addressed stamped envelope at a local record store chain. Two tickets each were sent to 375 fans chosen at random from the thousands of requests that were received.Scott, Jane. \"The Happening\" The Plain Dealer August 4, 1978 The concert was broadcast live on WMMS and seven other Midwestern radio stations. The audio mix and recording were supervised by Springsteen's manager Jon Landau and audio engineer Jimmy Iovine.Girard, Jim. \"Thank you Boss\" Scene August 17\u201323, 1978 Engineer Toby Scott, who remastered the 2014 release, found tapes of the concert at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland where they were part of the Springsteen exhibit \"Asbury Park to the Promised Land.\" Comparing the tapes to other copies of the concert, Scott thought this was the best version and potentially the original master tapes.http://live.brucespringsteen.net/live-music/0,11757/Bruce-Springsteen--- The-E-Street-Band-mp3-flac-download-8-9-1978-The-Agora-Cleveland-OH.html The exact source of the tapes is unclear as there were two audio feeds\u2014one to Agency Recording studio, located on the second floor of the Agora building, and another to a production truck parked outside.
