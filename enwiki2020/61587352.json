Spanish strategic interests have been increasing over the past few years, both politically and economically, with the growth in the number of Spanish companies in the country having been exponential. Despite the excellent state of bilateral relations and the enormous affinity in bilateral and international affairs, the dispute regarding renewable energies arose after the revision of the regulatory framework by the Spanish authorities ( 2013) and that has affected important Emirati investments in Spain.
