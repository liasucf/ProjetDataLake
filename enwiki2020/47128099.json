Since that time, an urgent need was felt to establish schools which would eliminate the vacuum created by their loss. On 12 August 2009 some alumni of Netarhat, on the initiative and invitation of the Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, came forward to help the state government by adopting roles suitable for them on the basis of their experience at Netarhat. Taking into consideration the need of the present circumstances it was accepted by general consensus that the medium of instruction would be English. On the suggestion of Chief Minister Kumar in the meeting it was also decided that only one school would be opened that would be co-educational and would provide a common platform to both meritorious boys and girls to garner quality education under the guidance of qualified and experienced teachers chosen from all over the country. Under the guidance of the State Government's Human Resource Department's Principal Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, the department set the wheels in motion in a record time of less than a year.
