    "text": "United Nations Security Council Resolution 132, adopted on September 7, 1959, decided to appoint a sub-committee consisting of Argentina, Italy, Japan and Tunisia, and instructed it to examine statements made before the Council concerning Laos and to receive further statements and documents, and make inquiries and report to the Council as soon as possible. It was the only resolution adopted by the Security Council in 1959. Laos had previously accused troops from North Vietnam of crossing its shared border and undertaking military attacks against Laos; the Security Council President convened a meeting urgently. Resolution 132 was adopted by ten votes to one against, from the Soviet Union. The sub-committee concluded that the crossings were of a guerilla nature and it could not be clearly established that North Vietnamese troops were responsible. ==See also== *List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 101 to 200 (1953\u20131965) ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0132 0132 0132 Category:1959 in Laos Category:1959 in Vietnam Category:September 1959 events ",
