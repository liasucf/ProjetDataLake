    "text": "Frederick Joseph Cooper (16 March 1888 \u2013 27 June 1958) was an English cricketer who played ten first-class matches for Essex between 1921 and 1923. Although mostly not an effective batsman \u2014 he was dismissed for single-figure scores in 14 of his 18 innings \u2014 Cooper made 32 on debut against Kent, then hit 52 from number nine against Gloucestershire in his second match. He also hit 32 (again) against Somerset the following year. (The remaining innings of his career was also single-digit, but not out.) His bowling was similarly rarely decisive, but he did manage to take five of his eight career wickets in one innings when he claimed 5\u201371 against the Combined Services in 1922. Cooper was born in Wetherby, Yorkshire, and died at the age of 70 in York. ==External links== * * Statistical summary from CricketArchive Category:1888 births Category:1958 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Essex cricketers Category:People from Wetherby Category:Cricketers from Yorkshire ",
