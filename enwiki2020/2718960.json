    "text": "Hogeschool Sint-Lukas Brussel, based in the Schaarbeek municipality of Brussels, Belgium, is allegedly still the only independent art school in Flanders. It is a predominantly Dutch-speaking institution located on the Paleizenstraat/Rue de Palais, and at another site, within reachable distance of Brussels' North Station. The Hogeschool provides exclusively art-related university-level higher education, hence the name. It houses around 1,000 students across its academic provision, and can trace its roots back to the first foundation of a Sint-Lukas art school in 1880. The school offers master programmes (four years) across the disciplines of audio-visual arts, graphic and publicity design, photography and fine art and bachelor programmes in interior design and construction. It also organizes Transmedia, a postgraduate programme for art students. The Hogeschool actively encourages student mobility, and maintains several links with art schools across the continent through the Socrates programme and the Erasmus programme, with language of instruction to exchange students being English in the appropriate circumstances. It is closely associated with the Sint-Lukas gallery in the city, showcasing contemporary art and its documentation. ==See also== * Institut Saint-Luc, the independent French-speaking equivalent in Brussels with the same name ==External links== * Hogeschool Sint-Lukas Brussel * More information about higher education in Flanders/Belgium (in English) * Find an officially recognised programme of this institution in the Higher Education Register Category:Universities and colleges in Brussels Category:Culture in Brussels Category:Art schools in Belgium Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger in Belgium ",
