    "text": "Charles Le Roy (12 February 1726 \u2013 12 December 1779) was an 18th-century French physician and Encyclop\u00e9diste. An advisor to the king, he was professor of medicine at the University of Montpellier, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 royale de m\u00e9decine and the Academies of Montpellier, N\u00eemes and Toulouse. == Life == Charles Le Roy was the youngest of the four sons of French watchmaker Julien Le Roy (1686\u20131759).Julien Le Roy ou la naissance de l'Horloge Horizontale He had three brothers, the watchmaker Pierre Le Roy (1717\u20131785), the physicist Jean- Baptiste Le Roy and the architect Julien-David Le Roy (1724\u20131803). His paternal uncle Pierre Le Roy (1687-1762) was also a watchmaker. His father gave him an excellent education. Because he was weak and vulnerable, the young Le Roy was sent to the Mediterranean city of Montpellier where he began to study medicine, which he continued in Italy. From there he went to Paris. But soon he was forced for health reasons, to settle again in Montpellier. He obtained his doctorate at the local medical school and soon became a professor. His teaching was very highly considered because of his thoroughness and accuracy. He had a wealth of experience, and it was a great loss for Montpellier when he returned to Paris in 1777 at the urging of his family. But this return to the capital proved fatal, for he died two years later. == Achievements == In 1755, Le Roy tried to cure a patient of his blindness by sending electric current pulses through a wire wound around the head. The blind man perceived vivid flashes of light, but could not be cured.Pascual- Leone, A. and Wagner, T., A Brief Summary of the History of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2007. 9:527\u2013565 This is considered the first experimental evidence that nerves could be electrically stimulated, 36 years before the description of electrophysiological phenomena by Galvani. == Works == *1755: M\u00e9moire o\u00f9 l'on rend compte de quelques tentatives que l'on a faites pour gu\u00e9rir plusieurs maladies par l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, Hist Acad Roy Sciences (Paris), M\u00e9moire Math Phys.;60:87\u201395. *1758: De aquarum mineralium natura et usu, Montpellier, *1759: Qu\u00e6stiones chemic\u00e6 duodecim pro cathedra vacante, Montpellier, *1759: De purgantibus.
