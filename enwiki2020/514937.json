    "text": "The saying holds that the world is supported by a chain of increasingly large turtles. Beneath each turtle is yet another: it is \"turtles all the way down\". \"Turtles all the way down\" is an expression of the problem of infinite regress. The saying alludes to the mythological idea of a World Turtle that supports the flat earth on its back. It suggests that this turtle rests on the back of an even larger turtle, which itself is part of a column of increasingly large world turtles that continues indefinitely (i.e., \"turtles all the way down\"). The exact origin of the phrase is uncertain. In the form \"rocks all the way down\", the saying appears as early as 1838. References to the saying's mythological antecedents, the World Turtle and its counterpart the World Elephant, were made by a number of authors in the 17th and 18th centuries. The expression has been used to illustrate problems such as the regress argument in epistemology. ==History== ===Background in Hindu mythology=== Four World Elephants resting on a World Turtle Early variants of the saying do not always have explicit references to infinite regression (i.e., the phrase \"all the way down\"). They often reference stories featuring a World Elephant, World Turtle, or other similar creatures that are claimed to come from Hindu mythology. The first known reference to a Hindu source is found in a letter by Jesuit Emanuel da Veiga (1549\u20131605), written at Chandagiri on 18 September 1599, in which the relevant passage reads: Veiga's account seems to have been received by Samuel Purchas, who has a close paraphrase in his Purchas His Pilgrims (1613/1626), \"that the Earth had nine corners, whereby it was borne up by the Heaven. Others dissented, and said, that the Earth was borne up by seven Elephants; the Elephants' feet stood on Tortoises, and they were borne by they know not what.\"Will Sweetman, Indology mailing list, citing Dieter Henrich, 'Die \"wahrhafte Schildkr\u00f6te\"' Hegel- Studien 2 (1963), pp. 281-91, and J. Charpentier, 'A Treatise on Hindu Cosmography from the Seventeenth Century (Brit. Mus. MS. Sloane 2748 A).' Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London 3(2) (1924), pp. 317-342. Purchas' account is again reflected by John Locke in his 1689 tract An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, where Locke introduces the story as a trope referring to the problem of induction in philosophical debate. Locke compares one who would say that properties inhere in \"Substance\" to the Indian who said the world was on an elephant which was on a tortoise, \"But being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-back'd Tortoise, replied, something, he knew not what\".John Locke (1689). An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book II, Chapter XXIII, section 2 The story is also referenced by Henry David Thoreau, who writes in his journal entry of 4 May 1852: \"Men are making speeches ... all over the country, but each expresses only the thought, or the want of thought, of the multitude. No man stands on truth. They are merely banded together as usual, one leaning on another and all together on nothing; as the Hindoos made the world rest on an elephant, and the elephant on a tortoise, and had nothing to put under the tortoise.\" ===Modern form=== In the form of \"rocks all the way down\", the saying dates to at least 1838, when it was printed in an unsigned anecdote in the New-York Mirror about a schoolboy and an old woman living in the woods: A version of the saying in its \"turtle\" form appeared in an 1854 transcript of remarks by preacher Joseph Frederick Berg addressed to Joseph Barker: William James Many 20th-century attributions claim that philosopher and psychologist William James is the source of the phrase.Robert Anton Wilson (1983). Prometheus Rising. Phoenix, AZ: New Falcon Publishers. p. 25. James referred to the fable of the elephant and tortoise several times, but told the infinite regress story with \"rocks all the way down\" in his 1882 essay, \"Rationality, Activity and Faith\": The linguist John R. Ross also associates James with the phrase: ==In epistemology and other disciplines== The metaphor is used as an example of the problem of infinite regress in epistemology to show that there is a necessary foundation to knowledge, as written by Johann Gottlieb Fichte in 1794:Fichte, J. G. (1794). Ueber den Begriff der Wissenschaftslehre oder der sogenannten Philosophie (Concerning the Conception of the Science of Knowledge Generally) (A. E. Kroeger, Trans.). David Hume references the story in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion when arguing against God as an unmoved mover:David Hume (1779). Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, part 4. Bertrand Russell also mentions the story in his 1927 lecture Why I Am Not a Christian while discounting the First Cause argument intended to be a proof of God's existence: ==Notable modern allusions or variations== References to \"turtles all the way down\" have been made in a variety of modern contexts. For example, \"Turtles All the Way Down\" is the name of a song by country artist Sturgill Simpson that appears on his 2014 album Metamodern Sounds in Country Music. \"Gamma Goblins ('Its Turtles All The Way Down' Mix)\" is a remix by Ott for the 2002 Hallucinogen album In Dub.https://books.google.com/books?id=xxfGBQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT154 Turtles All the Way Down is also the title of a 2017 novel by John Green about a teenage girl with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder.Senior, Jennifer (October 10, 2017). \"In John Green\u2019s \u2018Turtles All the Way Down,\u2019 a Teenager\u2019s Mind Is at War With Itself.\" The New York Times. Retrieved October 29, 2017. Stephen Hawking incorporates the saying into the beginning of his 1988 book A Brief History of Time: Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court discussed his \"favored version\" of the saying in a footnote to his plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States: Microsoft Visual Studio had a gamification plug-in that awarded badges for certain programming behaviors and patterns. One of the badges was \"Turtles All the Way Down\", which was awarded for writing a class with 10 or more levels of inheritance. ==See also== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== ==Further reading== * Category:Concepts in epistemology Category:Concepts in metaphysics Category:Concepts in the philosophy of science Category:Epistemological theories Category:Flat Earth Category:History of ideas Category:History of philosophy Category:Legendary turtles Category:Metaphors referring to animals Category:Metaphysical theories Category:Mythological cosmologies Category:Philosophical arguments Category:Philosophical concepts Category:Philosophical problems Category:Pyrrhonism ",
