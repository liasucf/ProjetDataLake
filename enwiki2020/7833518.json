    "text": "Tembo Tabou, written by Franquin and Greg, drawn by Franquin and Jean Roba, is the twenty-fourth album of the Spirou et Fantasio series, and the twentieth under Franquin's authorship. The story was initially serialised in Le Parisien Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 in 1959, and later in Spirou magazine, before it was published, along with the Marsupilami story La Cage, as a hardcover album in 1974. ==Story== In Tembo Tabou, Spirou and Fantasio find themselves on another expedition travelling upstream an African river, in search of vanished American author Oliver Gurgling Thirstywell. Events become increasingly more strange when they discover red elephants, befriend a pygmy tribe, learn of Marsupilami's love of eating warrior ants, and confront a gang of \"protection racket\" thugs who cultivate meat-eating plants. The story The Cage cronicles an awful day at work for intrepid poacher Bring M. Backalive, obsessed with capturing a living sample of a baby Marsupilami, who learns the cost of angering a Marsupilami father. ==Background== The title story of this album was produced in the period between the making of Spirou et les hommes-bulles and QRN sur Bretzelburg. ==Trivia== In the 1970s, Swedish publishing house Carlsen Comics deemed the story's contents to be racially offensive, and the album was never published in Sweden. However, it was published in Denmark by Interpresse. The story was later published in Sweden in book form, included in the collected series of Franquin's Spirou. ==References== * Franquin publications in Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es Footnotes ==External links== * Spirou official site album index * Franquin site album index Category:Comics by Andr\u00e9 Franquin Category:Spirou et Fantasio albums Category:1974 graphic novels Category:1974 in comics Category:Comics set in Africa Category:Works originally published in Le Parisien Category:Literature first published in serial form ",
