Kearney graduated with highest honors from Princeton University with an A.B. in economics in 1996 and was inducted as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She received the Wolf Balleisen Memorial Award from for completing her 96-page long senior thesis, titled \"The Economic Determinants of Age at First Birth in United States Metropolitan Areas: An Empirical Analysis\", under the supervision of Anne Case. She then pursued graduate studies with the support of a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Harry S. Truman Scholarship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she received a Ph.D. in economics in 2002 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Essays on public policy and consumer choice: applications to welfare reform and state lotteries\", under the supervision of Jonathan Gruber and Joshua Angrist. == Research == Kearney's research focuses on issues related to social policy, poverty, and inequality. In work with Phillip B. Levine, receiving attention in the popular media, she found that greater access to Sesame Street in the show's early days led to improved early educational outcomes for children. Kearney and Levine also found that MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom programs led to a sizable reduction in teen births, accounting for as much as one-third of the overall decline in teen births in the year and a half following the show\u2019s introduction in 2009. She has written extensively about income inequality and has testified before the Congress on the topic of U.S. income inequality. She co-authored a 2013 proposal for a Secondary Earner Tax Deduction that formed the basis for a tax proposal included in proposed legislation and in Obama's proposed 2015 budget. === Selected works === * MS Kearney, R Wilson, 2018 \"Male Earnings, Marriageable Men, and Non-Marital Fertility: Evidence from the Fracking Boom,\" Review of Economics and Statistics 100(4): 678-690. * MS Kearney, PB Levine, 2017 \"The Economics of Non-Marital Childbearing and the Marriage Premium for Children,\" Annual Review of Economics (9). * MS Kearney, 2016 \"Should we be concerned about income inequality?\" in Ed.
