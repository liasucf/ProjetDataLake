    "text": "Walter, Abbot of Evesham or Walter de Cerisy was an 11th-century abbot and church leader of England under the Norman conquest.Chron. de Evesham (Rolls Ser.), 95, 96. V. C. H. Worc. i. 306\u20138. He is known from the Domesday Book and several legal documents. ==Name== He is known variously as Walter de Cerisy, or more simply as Walter, a monk of Cerisy, a small village to the east of Amiens and 12 km from Albert in France. It is not known if he was born in the village or had merely lived in the Abbey at Cerisy-la-For\u00eat. ==Legal cases== Walter is known for his varied legal actions, at a time that the newly established Norman kings were taking lands from the nobility and ecclesiastical estates. === Bishop Wulfstan === There was a court case between himself and Bishop Wulfstan, who pleaded before the king and established that \"4 hides in Bengeworth, Worcester, and houses in the city of Worcester belonged to his holding, so that the abbot ought to do him service from them like his other tenants\". The bishop also argued that > the sake and soke of Hampton, Worcestershire should belong to his hundred of > Oswaldslow, so that the people of Hampton should plead there, pay geld > there, do military service and the other royal services required from these > hides, and pay church and burial dues there.Walter, Abbott of Evesham, at > Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England. Wulfstan argued that these rights which Walter had refused to provide had been set in the time of Edward the Confessor.Placita Anglo-Normannica : Law Cases from William I to Richard I - Preserved in Historical Records (London: S. Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington, 1879) p16. The witnesses were called but before proceeding to trial Walter (on the advice of friends) confessed and accessed to Wulfstan. === Odo of Bayeux === In 1077 Odo of Bayeux, the brother of William the Conqueror brought an action against Walter as the Abbott of Evesham Abbey, claiming that certain lands were obtained illegally under the prior abbot,Knowles, Brooke and London (eds.), The Heads of Religious Houses : England and Wales. 1, 940\u20131216, p. 47 \u00c6thelwig, whom he had recently succeeded.Knowles, David (1976). The Monastic Order in England: A History of its Development from the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council, 940\u20131216 (Second reprint ed.). Cambridge, UK: (Cambridge University Press, 1976). . p248. \u00c6thelwig had been a deputy of Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester, and, prior to being appointed abbott, \u00c6thelwig had administered estates for Ealdred. Then, as abbott, \u00c6thelwig had worked to recover estates that had been lost to Evesham, as well as acquiring more estates. Although the charge of \u00c6thelwig misappropriating lands is possible, Odo had already been in court actions with Ealdred over occasions where Odo had confiscated of lands held by Worcester, and this action could equally been seen as part of both the ongoing acquisition of estates by Odo and his continuing disagreement with Ealdred. The court cases are part of a large collection of pleadings, at this time, against a process of Nomanization that within a decade saw 64% of land in England consolidated into the hands of just 150 individuals, and many of the nobility deprived of their estates. === Urse d'Abetot === Walter appears to have been involved with the dispute between Urse d'Abetot, Sheriff of Worcestershire and the Bishops Wulfstan and Ealdred, of York. This dispute was also over land, in this case the misappropriation of bishopric estates by Urse, in his role as Sheriff. ==Historicity== Walter was a witness of a charter wherein Queen Matilda granted three hides at Garsdon in Wiltshire to Malmesbury Abbey. Walter, Abbot of Evesham, 1077-1104, at Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England. He was recorded in the Domesday Book,Walter 13 Walter, abbot of Evesham, fl. 1086 where he is listed as a tenant-in-chief of several properties.Chron. de Evesham (Rolls Ser.), 95, 96. V. C. H. Worc. i. 306\u20138. He was a witness to a charter of William the Conqueror that Bishop Wulfstan should \"have fully his sake and soke, his services, and all the customs belonging to his hundreds of Oswaldslow\". The Domesday Book seems to indicate that, by 1088, Odo of Bayeux and Urse d'Abit\u00f4t had been successful in acquiring the lands they had claimed.'Houses of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Evesham', in A History of the County of Worcester: Volume 2, ed.
