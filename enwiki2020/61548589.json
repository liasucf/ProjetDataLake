He made his first-team bow on 8 December 2012 during an Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n win away to Argentinos Juniors, which preceded a further six appearances for the midfielder in 2012\u201313; including his Copa Libertadores debut against Olimpia in February 2013. In total, Vieyra featured in fifteen games for Newell's in four seasons; though didn't start a league game in that time. In January 2016, Vieyra went to Paraguay with Cerro Porte\u00f1o. He was selected just four times in 2016, which preceded Vieyra departing on loan to fellow Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n team Nacional in 2017. Vieyra scored on his Nacional debut, netting his first senior goal in a home loss to Deportivo Capiat\u00e1; that was one of four goals in his first campaign with them. He remained to play in two more seasons with Nacional, scoring thirteen times in the process; which included braces in 2018 over Guaran\u00ed and 3 de Febrero. Midway through 2019, on 1 August, Vieyra agreed a move back to his homeland with Hurac\u00e1n. His bow arrived on 18 August versus Patronato as they lost 2\u20131, though Vieyra did assist his team's goal. Vieyra netted his first Argentine top-flight goal in February 2020 against Godoy Cruz. He departed the club months later. In July 2020, Vieyra headed to Central C\u00f3rdoba. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Newell's Old Boys |2012\u201313 |rowspan=\"4\"|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |4||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3Appearance(s) in the Copa Libertadores||0||0||0||7||0 |- |2013\u201314 |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- |2014 |4||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||4||0 |- |2015 |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !12!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!3!!0!!0!!0!!15!!0 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Cerro Porte\u00f1o |2016 |rowspan=\"4\"|Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n |4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- |2017 |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2018 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2019 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !4!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!0!!0!!4!!0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Nacional (loan) |2017 |rowspan=\"3\"|Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n |13||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2Appearance(s) in the Copa Sudamericana||0||0||0||15||4 |- |2018 |27||7||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||1||0||0||29||8 |- |2019 |18||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||1||0||0||20||5 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !58!!15!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!2!!0!!0!!64!!17 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Hurac\u00e1n |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"2\"|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |8||1||0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||9||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Central C\u00f3rdoba |2020\u201321 |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !82!!16!!0!!0!!0!!0!!10!!2!!0!!0!!92!!18 |} ==Honours== ;Newell's Old Boys *Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2012\u201313 Torneo Final ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:People from Arrecifes Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Paraguay Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Paraguay Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Newell's Old Boys footballers Category:Cerro Porte\u00f1o players Category:Club Nacional footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n footballers Category:Central C\u00f3rdoba de Santiago del Estero footballers ",
