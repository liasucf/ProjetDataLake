In January 2020, Debney was replaced, with the board of directors stating that he had \"engaged in conduct inconsistent with a nonfinancial company policy.\" In late February 2020, a separation agreement showed that Debney would receive a compensation package from American Outdoor Brands worth over $1 million. His total compensation for the fiscal year ending in April 2019 had been $3.8 million. ==References== ==External links== * Profile at bloomberg.com * Smith & Wesson Inside The Chamber James Debney Shot Show 2014 via YouTube Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American chief executives Category:American people of British descent Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester ",
