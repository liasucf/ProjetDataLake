Following 2004's Hurricane Jeanne, the organization provided scholarships to 3,600 children in Gona\u00efves, Haiti. It continued to provide scholarships, school funding, meals and other charitable benefits to citizens of Haiti in the following years. After the 2010 Haitian earthquake, Y\u00e9le became prominent in raising funds for disaster relief. According to Jean, Y\u00e9le raised over $1 million in 24 hours over Twitter.

By February 2010, questions were reported about the history and management of Y\u00e9le. The New York Times reported that the charity had failed to file tax returns for several years. The former executive director, Sanjay Rawal, questioned Y\u00e9le's ability to handle large projects and criticized its lack of financial controls. By August 2012, chief executive Derek Q. Johnson was the last remaining officer of the charity.
