    "text": "Brendan Hurst (born April 1, 1972) is a former professional rugby league player who played for the Gold Coast Chargers and Sydney Roosters from 1994 to 2000. Hurst is the leading point-scorer in the history of the Chargers. ==NRL career== Hurst debuted for the Gold Coast Chargers in 1994, becoming the leading points-scorer in the clubs' 11-year tenure in the NSWRL/ARL. Hurst moved to the Sydney Roosters prior to the 1998 NRL season, one year before the Chargers folded, where he played 21 games before retiring in 2000. ==Post-NRL career== After his retirement, Hurst worked as the sponsorship manager for the Roosters, before being hired as an assistant coach at the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2002. In December 2004, Hurst became the CEO of the Ipswich Jets. Hurst's appointment was the subject of some controversy, as former Redcliffe Dolphins lower grade coach Rob Campbell claimed he had been offered the job by Ipswich previously. Hurst retired from his position as CEO on the 29th of January 2007, due to a desire to travel. As CEO, Hurst was noted for his good relationship with the Ipswich Junior Rugby League. ==References== Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Gold Coast Chargers players Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Rugby league players from Queensland ",
