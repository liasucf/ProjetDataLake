    "text": "Andrew Alexander Ranicki (born Andrzej Aleksander Ranicki; 30 December 1948 \u2013 21 February 2018) was a British mathematician who worked on algebraic topology. He was a professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. ==Life== Ranicki was the only child of the well-known literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki and the artist Teofila Reich-Ranicki; he spoke Polish in his family. Born in London, he lived in Warsaw, in Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg, and attended school in England at the King's School, Canterbury from the age of sixteen.Emilia Smechowski: \u201eEr hatte die Wucht eines Niagara-Falls\u201c, Interview in TAZ, 13. September 2014, S. 32 f.Volker Hage, Martin Doerry: Spiegel-Gespr\u00e4ch: \u201eIch habe nie gefragt\u201c, Der Spiegel, May 26, 2014'Cambridge Tripos: English; Medical Sciences; Mathematics', Times, 20 June 1969. Ranicki studied Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with a BA in 1969. At Cambridge he was a student of topologists Andrew Casson and John Frank Adams. He earned his doctoral degree in 1973 with a thesis on algebraic L-theory. Ranicki received numerous awards and honors for his scientific achievements during his studies. From 1972 to 1977 he was a Fellow of Trinity College.Curriculum Vitae, Andrew Ranicki From 1977 to 1982, he was Assistant Professor at Princeton University. In 1982 he began at the University of Edinburgh as a lecturer; in 1987 he was promoted to Reader. In 1992, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Directory of Fellows , page 33. Since 1995, Ranicki has been the Chair of Algebraic Surgery at the University of Edinburgh.Chair of Algebraic Surgery, University of Edinburgh, Communications and Marketing. Several times he stayed as a visiting scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, most recently in 2011.Johannes Seiler: \"Mathematics is a drug!\" A conversation with Andrew Ranicki, Bonner General-Anzeiger from January 8-9, 2011 on the website of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics Bonn ==Personal life, death, and legacy== Ranicki was married to American paleontologist Ida Thompson in 1979; they have a daughter. Ranicki suffered from leukemia; he died peacefully in the presence of his wife.Thomas Anz: Obituary of Andrew Ranicki, literaturkritik.de, February 22, 2018.
