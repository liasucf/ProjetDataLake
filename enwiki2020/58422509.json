She reported that conditions on the fishing grounds were very bad. Seven ships had been sunk, several had been beset by ice, and the rest had not killed more than an average of four fish each.Lloyd's List \u21165733. Laetitia, Clark, master, arrived at Aberdeen and reported a more complete accounting of how many whales each vessel had take, and which were beset by ice. Brunswicks 50 tons came from four fish.Lloyd's List \u21165734. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Master ! Owner ! Trade ! Notes and source |- | 1825 | W.
