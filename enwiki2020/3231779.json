A designer and muralist, Chanler received much of his art training in France at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, and there his most famous work, titled Giraffes, was completed in 1905 and later purchased by the French government. Robert D. Coe, who studied with him, described Chanler as being \"eccentric and almost bizarre.\" Chanler rose to prominence as an acclaimed American artist when his work was exhibited in the 1913 Armory Show in New York City. ==Family and early life== Robert Winthrop Chanler, 1912, Leopard and Deer, gouache or tempera on canvas, mounted on wood, , Rokeby Collection.

His siblings and he became orphans after the death of their mother in 1875 and their father in 1877, both to pneumonia. The children were raised at their parents' Rokeby Estate in Barrytown, New York. John Winthrop Chanler's will provided $20,000 a year for each child for life (equivalent to $470,563 in 2018), enough to live comfortably by the standards of the time.Thomas Lately, A Pride of Lions: The Astor Orphans; the Chanler Chronicle, W.

When he returned to the U.S. in the early 1900s, he purchased a townhouse on East 19th Street, decorated it with his own works, and called it his House of Fantasy. The townhouse became a social center for New York's art community. Like Shinn, Chanler was a personality and a figure in his time. Chanler was a member of the New York State Assembly (Dutchess Co., 2nd D.) in 1904, but did not run for re-election. In 1907, he was elected sheriff of Dutchess County, New York, and remained in that office for three years.Tad Richards, \"Robert Chanler: Over the top wasn\u2019t enough,\" Hudson Valley One, June 2, 2016 Chanler specialized in painted screens and was a member of the National Society of Mural Painters. A ceiling mural of buffaloes painted by Chanler is in the Coe House in Brookville, New York. He was also a member of the Architectural League of New York. He painted a ceiling inside the Colony Club, a private member's club located at Park Avenue and 62nd Street in New York City. In 1905, Chanler exhibited a work entitled Au Pays des Girafes (or et argent) at the Salon d'Automne in Paris (no. 328 of the catalogue).Salon d'Automne, 1905, Au Pays des Girafes, no. 328, Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art d\u00e9coratif This was the exhibition that prompted critic Louis Vauxcelles to label a group of painters \"fauves\" (wild beasts), thus marking the birth of Fauvism.Russell T. Clement, Les Fauves: A Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, , 1994 ===The Armory Show=== The 1913 Armory Show in Chicago featuring two of Chanler's screens Flamingoes, 1897 Chanler's work was featured in the 1913 Armory Show in New York, and he was one of the most acclaimed American artist in the exhibition. The elaborately painted screens he submitted were placed near the entrance of the show (Gallery A), where they captured the attention of the public and critics.Megan Fort, The Armory Show at 100, the Fantastic Robert Winthrop Chanler, New York Historical Society, 2013 Chanler's screen titled Hopi Indian Snake Dance was reproduced in the New York Herald, 15 February 1913.Laurette E. McCarthy, Robert Winthrop Chanler\u2019s Armory Show Screens: more than ever realized, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution A work titled Porcupines was reproduced on postcard made for the Armory Show. Another screen by Chanler depicting porcupines is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.Robert Winthrop Chanler, \"Porcupines\" and \"Nightmare\", 1914, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York According to the catalogues for the Armory Show, Chanler was represented by nine screens at the New York venue and eight screens at the Art Institute of Chicago, but photographs and written sources, including Walter Pach's annotated New York catalogue and the Supplement to the New York catalogue located in the Armory Show records and the Walter Pach papers, indicate that around 25 screens were displayed during the three weeks in Manhattan, and at least nine at the Chicago exhibition. ===Patrons and friends=== Chanler's portrait, painted by his friend Guy P\u00e8ne du Bois in 1915, came to epitomize the world of money, fashion, and status with which he was well acquainted.A Lover of Beauty, Guy P\u00e8ne du Bois Painted His Ideal. Robert Winthrop Chanler, stained glass window (one of seven, with a study drawing) in the Whitney Studio, New York City, 1918\u20131923, private collection Like many women of her class, Mai Rogers Coe was a patron of artists and had a taste for the elaborate, decorative works of Robert Winthrop Chanler. He painted decorative murals in Mai Coe's bedroom (1921) and in the family's breakfast room, the Buffalo Room (1920). In 1918, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney commissioned Chanler to create a set of seven stained glass windows for her sculpture studio on MacDougal Alley in Greenwich Village. She asked Chanler to decorate the entire space and over a period of five years, he created an immense chimney-piece of three-dimensional flames, floor to ceiling, in plaster with additional inserts of bronze blazes.Allison Meier, \"Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney\u2019s Restored Studio Opens for Public Tours,\" Hyperallergic, May 17, 2016 He covered the entire ceiling with plaster constellations and then created the windows.Wendy Moonan, \"Robert W. Chanler's (Stained) Glass Menagerie,\" Introspective Magazine Chanler also designed murals for Gertrude's studio in Greenvale, New York, including a seaworld fantasy in the bathroom. The studio is extant and privately owned. Chanler's murals at the Villa Vizcaya, 1916 Gertrude Vanderbilt and Mai Rogers Coe were perhaps Chanler's greatest patrons, but he received commissions from other wealthy families for decorative murals and screens. By 1920, when he completed the murals in the Buffalo Room, Chanler's work was well known. He later received favorable commentary in The Upholsterer and Interior Decorator magazine for his murals in Mai Coe's bedroom (1921) and in International Studio magazine for his painted screens (1922). Around this time, Chicago industrialist James Deering commissioned him to paint an \"undersea fantasy\" fresco on the ceiling of the indoor/outdoor swimming pool at Villa Vizcaya (1916\u20131925), Deering's winter home in Miami, Florida. Clarissa Buch, \"Vizcaya Restores Iconic Swimming Pool Grotto and Rare Mural by Robert Winthrop Chanler,\" Miami New Times, Monday, June 13, 2016Allison Meier, \"The Fantastic Fall of a Boisterous and Beloved Gilded Age,\" Hyperallergic, September 16, 2016 Chanler was close friends with Hervey White and a member of White's Woodstock artist colony in the early 1920s. White wrote of Chanler, \"He could correlate his subjects in any period, the politics, sociology, and art. He could illustrate with the customs of the populace, he could give incidents for illustration of his points, then break off with a personal explanation of his conduct. He was a man of great emotion and great mind.\" Towards the end of his life, Chanler owned a house in Woodstock, where he exhibited his work in local exhibitions.The Art of Robert W. Chanler ==Personal life== Plaster bust of Robert W. Chanler by Cecil de Blaquiere Howard, 1928 On April 12, 1893, he married Julia Remington Chamberlain, a daughter of William Chamberlain and Mary Bradhurst Remington. Julia's elder sister Alice was the first wife of Robert's elder brother Lewis. They had two daughters: Julia on November 24, 1898, and Dorothy Chanler on March 25, 1905. The couple divorced on August 7, 1907. After his divorce from Julia, Chanler had a whirlwind romance with opera singer Natalina \"Lina\" Cavalieri. They married on June 18, 1910, but separated by the end of their honeymoon, and their divorce became final in June 1912. After the divorce, Lina returned to Europe, where she became a much-loved star in pre- Revolutionary St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Ukraine. Chanler died on October 24, 1930, at an art colony in Woodstock, New York, after being in a coma for 12 hours. ==Legacy== Chanler's work has been compared to the fantastical works of some renaissance painters. His works involve the use of sculpted gesso, transparent glazes, and gilded finishes to produce ornate and decorative designs. His work still exists in his family's estate, Rokeby near Barrytown, New York, the Luxembourg Museum, and in private collections across the country. In 2010, Chanler's decorative plaster ceiling at the Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Studio was the focus of a conservation study by a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania.Whitney Studio Ceiling, Architectural Conservation Laboratory. The ceiling, which had been painted over numerous times, was found to contain vivid colors amidst metallic overlays and glazes.Art of Robert Winthrop Chanler. Extensive restoration of Chanler's murals and the painted plaster ceiling at Villa Vizcaya was begun in 2016. ==References== ==Further reading== * Robert Winthrop Chanler: Discovering the Fantastic, Edited by Gina Wouters, Andrea Gollin, Foreword by Eve M.
