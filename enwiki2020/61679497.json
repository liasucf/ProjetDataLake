During that period several other building such at Motihar kuthi were constructed in the area for silk and indigo trading. When Dutch traders left India after the fall of Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah in 1757, they handed over the building to British East India Company. The company later sold the building to Robert Watson and Company in 1833. After the British left in 1947, the building was used as government's supply center. In 1953, the building was handed over to newly started Rajshahi University to use as its administrative building. The building was handed over again to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to preserve as a heritage site of the city. ==Building description== Boro Kuthi is located on the bank of the river Padma, south of Rajshahi College.
