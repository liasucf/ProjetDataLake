Kimondiu began running marathons as a pacesetter when he finished the 2000 New York City Marathon in sixteenth place. The following year, Kimondiu became the first ever pacesetter to win at the Chicago Marathon. In further marathons, Kimondiu competed at the Boston Marathon in 2002 and resumed his Chicago appearances in 2002 and 2003. After a third place finish at the 2004 Tokyo International Marathon, Kimondiu did not finish the New York City Marathon that year. A few years later, Kimondiu ran at the 2006 Tokyo International Marathon and 2007 Tokyo Marathon, but did not complete either marathon. Kimondiu's last marathon was at the 2012 Hong Kong Marathon, where he came in fifteenth place. ==Early life== Kimondiu was born on 30 November 1977 and spent his childhood in Kilungu, Kenya.
