    "text": "\"I Can't Seem to Say Goodbye\" is a song written by Don Robertson and originally recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis during his time with Sun Records. The recording didn't see the light of day until 1970, when it was included on the second Jerry Lee Lewis album released by the new owner of Sun Records, Shelby Singleton. (In June 1969, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips sold the entire Sun catalog to Shelby Singleton, which included a treasure trove of unreleased Lewis recordings. With Jerry Lee's rebirth as a country star for Smash Records, Singleton began releasing these older songs and packaged them in such a way that many buyers assumed they were recent recordings.) The song was also released as a single from that album, reaching number 6 on the Cash Box Country Singles chart and number 7 on the Billboard country chart. == Track listing == == Charts == {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=col|Chart (1970) !scope=col|Peak position |- !scope=row| US Cash Box Country Singles | 6 |- |} == References == Category:1970 songs Category:1970 singles Category:Jerry Lee Lewis songs Category:Sun Records singles Category:Country music songs ",
