    "text": "Luke Joseph Scarpa (October 4, 1928 \u2013 April 3, 2012) was an American professional wrestler who was best known by the ring name Chief Jay Strongbow. He portrayed a Native American wrestler, who wore a war bonnet to the ring and would \"go on the warpath\" when the fans started cheering him against an opponent. In reality, he was a business-minded Italian-American. ==Professional wrestling career== Strongbow's wrestling attire ===National Wrestling Alliance (1947\u20131970)=== Scarpa's wrestling career began in 1947, under his real name. He was a standout in the Georgia and Florida territories of the National Wrestling Alliance throughout the 1950s and 1960s, winning several championships and becoming a fan favorite. ===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970\u20131979)=== In 1970, Scarpa began working for Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation as Chief Jay Strongbow, a Native American gimmick complete with a traditional headdress and Native themed wrestling moves.Slotnik, Daniel E. Joe Scarpa, Who Gained Wrestling Fame as Chief Jay Strongbow, Dies The New York Times (April 5, 2012). Retrieved July 7, 2013. He feuded with the likes of \"The Golden Greek\" Spiros Arion, \"Handsome Jimmy\" Valiant, and Superstar Billy Graham, nearly winning the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship. A memorable match against \"Iron Mike\" McCord featured Strongbow applying his sleeper hold. But Lou Albano, McCord's manager, interfered by smashing a cast on the Chief's forehead. It was alleged that Strongbow had previously jumped Albano in the locker room, breaking his arm. McCord was disqualified, but Strongbow was cut wide open by Albano's blows. Strongbow settled the score in front of a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, beating Captain Lou Albano convincingly. Strongbow picked up a win at Madison Square Garden in the summer of 1970, shortly after he entered the WWWF, pinning top contender Crusher Verdue, who was managed by Lou Albano. In 1975, he began feuding with Spiros Arion. Arion, a popular and seemingly unbeatable babyface, returned to the WWWF after an absence and teamed with Strongbow. Arion turned on Strongbow, destroying his headdress on Philadelphia television after he had tied Strongbow in the ropes, and rubbed the feathers in his face. Arion was now a heel, and pinned Strongbow in eastern arenas as he went on to challenge champion Bruno Sammartino. Strongbow won his first WWWF World Tag Team Championship on May 22, 1972 with partner Sonny King. They defeated the team of Baron Mikel Scicluna and King Curtis Iaukea. Strongbow and King held the title for a month before losing it to the team of Mr. Fuji and Professor Toru Tanaka on June 27. Four and a half years later, on December 7, 1976, Strongbow won his second WWWF World Tag Team Championship, this time with partner Billy White Wolf. The team won the title in a three-team tournament, defeating The Executioners and Nikolai Volkoff and Tor Kamata. Their reign was cut short in August 1977 when the belts were vacated due to White Wolf suffering a neck injury at the hands of Ken Patera's Swinging Full Nelson. In 1979, he feuded with Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, who broke Strongbow's leg. The two wrestled all over the WWF circuit, including an \"Indian Strap match\" at Madison Square Garden on July 30, 1979. ===NWA Detroit / Big Time Wrestling (1976)=== Strongbow also competed for The Sheik's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Detroit. He had a memorable feud with \"Bulldog\" Don Kent, which culminated in a \"shark cage match\" in 1976. Strongbow and Kent fought inside of a small shark cage, with the first man to escape being declared the winner. With an assist from fellow fan favorite Mark Lewin, Strongbow was able to escape the shark cage victorious. ===NWA Georgia / Mid- Atlantic and other territories (1980-1981)=== After wrestling in the WWF for 9 years, Strongbow went to work for Georgia Championship Wrestling and Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling. In Detroit he feuded with Don Kent once again. Then he feuded with Baron Von Raschke in Georgia. He won the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship defeating Luke Graham on October 11, 1980 in Puerto Rico. Then dropped the title on December 20 to Danny Condrey. In 1981 he went to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling where he feuded with Kevin Sullivan. ===Return to WWF (1982\u20131986)=== In 1982, Strongbow formed a tag team with his on-screen brother, Jules Strongbow. On June 28, the Strongbows won the tag team championship from the team of Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito in New York City's Madison Square Garden. During the match, special guest referee Ivan Putski counted the winning fall, but did not see Fuji's foot draped over the bottom rope. On the July 13 episode of Championship Wrestling, the Strongbows lost the titles back to Fuji and Saito, but on the October 26 episode of Championship Wrestling, the Strongbows defeated Fuji and Saito for their second WWF Tag Team Championship reign as a team. On the March 8, 1983 episode of Championship Wrestling, the Strongbows lost the titles to The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika). After failing in regaining the belts, the Strongbows disbanded. ===Retirement (1986\u20131994, 2008)=== Strongbow retired in 1986, but would still step back into the ring from time to time, most notably for a legends battle royal in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 1987. In retirement, Strongbow became a WWF road agent and worked in the company's front office. He also participated in a 1994 storyline in which he mentored Tatanka (an actual Native American of the Lumbee tribe). Strongbow was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Gorilla Monsoon. Strongbow's last appearance in WWE was a brief appearance on the November 17, 2008 episode of Monday Night Raw when Stephanie McMahon introduced him to the audience in Atlanta. ==Personal life== Strongbow in 2011 His son, Joe Jr. wrestled in the 1980s and early 1990s mainly as Mark Pyle and Mark Young in the WWF from 1986-1990 and Vince Young in WCW. Joe Jr. died in 2016 at the age of 48. He also has a daughter Connie Pacheco of Portland, Oregon. ==Death== Scarpa fell at his home in late 2011 and was hospitalized. He died in that hospital on April 3, 2012, at the age of 83. He was buried in Griffin, Georgia. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Championship Wrestling from Florida **NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Florida version) (2 times) **NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Florida version) (3 times) - with Jose Lothario **NWA World Tag Team Championship (Florida version) (1 time) - with Don Curtis *Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling **NWA Gulf Coast Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Gulf Coast version) (2 times) - with Lee Fields *NWA Mid-America **NWA Mid-America World Tag Team Championship (3 times) - with Lester Welch (2) and Alex Perez (1) **NWA Tri-State Heavyweight Championship (Alabama version) (1 time) *Mid-South Sports **NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Macon Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with El Mongol **NWA World Tag Team Championship (Georgia version) (1 time) - with Don Curtis *New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2011 *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI Most Popular Wrestler of the Year (1973) **PWI Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year (1979) **PWI ranked him # 214 of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the \"PWI Years\" in 2003. *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum **(Class of 2009) *World Wrestling Council **WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *World Wide Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Federation **WWWF / WWF Tag Team Championship (4 times) - with Sonny King (1), Billy White Wolf (1), and Jules Strongbow (2) **WWF Hall of Fame (Class of 1994) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter :*Most Washed Up Wrestler (1983) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1928 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Professional wrestlers from New Jersey Category:Professional wrestling executives Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:WWE Hall of Fame inductees Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:Deaths from falls ",
