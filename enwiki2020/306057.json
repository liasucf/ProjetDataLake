    "text": "Father Louis Hennepin, O.F.M. baptized Antoine, (12 May 1626 \u2013 5 December 1704) was a Belgian Roman Catholic priest and missionary of the Franciscan Recollet order (French: R\u00e9collets) and an explorer of the interior of North America. ==Biography== Antoine Hennepin was born in Ath in the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Hainaut, Belgium). In 1659, while he was living in the town of B\u00e9thune, it was captured by the army of Louis XIV of France. Henri Joulet, who accompanied Hennepin and wrote his own journal of their travels, called Hennepin a Fleming (a native of Flanders), although Ath was and still is a Romance-speaking area found in present-day Wallonia. Joulet's use of the term \"Fleming\" here denotes a lack of understanding or generalization of this demonym, which was common at that time.Profile, archive.org; accessed 20 November 2015. Painting by Douglas Volk, of Father Louis Hennepin seeing Saint Anthony Falls. Hennepin joined the Franciscans, and preached in Halles (Belgium) and in Artois. He was then put in charge of a hospital in Maestricht. He was also briefly an army chaplain.Corrigan, Michael. \"Register of the Clergy Laboring in the Archdiocese of New York\", Historical Records and Studies, Vol. 1, United States Catholic Historical Society, 1899 p. 34 At the request of Louis XIV, the R\u00e9collets sent four missionaries to New France in May 1675, including Hennepin, accompanied by Ren\u00e9 Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. In 1676 Hennepin went to the Indian mission at Fort Frontenac, and from there to the Mohawks. In 1678, Hennepin was ordered by his provincial superior to accompany La Salle on an expedition to explore the western part of New France. Hennepin departed in 1679 with La Salle from Quebec City to construct the 45-ton barque Le Griffon, sail through the Great Lakes, and explore the unknown West. Hennepin was with La Salle at the construction of Fort Crevecoeur (near present-day Peoria, Illinois) in January 1680. In February, La Salle sent Hennepin and two others as an advance party to search for the Mississippi River. The party followed the Illinois River to its junction with the Mississippi. Shortly thereafter, Hennepin was captured by a Sioux war party and carried off for a time into what is now the state of Minnesota.Shea, John Gilmary. DESCRIPTION of LOUISIANA, By FATHER LOUIS HENNEPIN, RECOLLECT MISSIONARY: Translated from the Edition of 1683, and compared with the Novella Decouverte, The La Salle Documents and other Contemporaneous Papers, New York: John G Shea (1880), pp 368\u201370. (The spelling Recollect is the translator's. See original title page (image at Hathi Trust).) In September 1680, thanks to Daniel Greysolon, Sieur Du Lhut, Hennepin and the others were given canoes and allowed to leave, eventually returning to Quebec. Hennepin returned to France and was never allowed by his order to return to North America.Profile, Dictionary of Canadian Biography (online)]; accessed 20 November 2015. Local historians credit the Franciscan R\u00e9collet friar as the first European to step ashore at the site of present-day Hannibal, Missouri.National Geographic Magazine, July 1956, Vol CX, No. 1, pp 135\u201336. Two great waterfalls were brought to the world's attention by Hennepin: Niagara Falls, with the most voluminous flow of any in North America, and the Saint Anthony Falls in what is now Minneapolis, the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. In 1683, he published a book about Niagara Falls called A New Discovery. The Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton created a mural, \"Father Hennepin at Niagara Falls\" for the New York Power Authority at Lewiston, New York. ==Books by Hennepin== Illustration from the 1688 Dutch edition of Description de la Louisiane Hennepin authored: * Description de la Louisiane (Paris, 1683), * Nouvelle d\u00e9couverte d'un tr\u00e8s grand pays situ\u00e9 dans l'Am\u00e9rique entre le Nouveau-Mexique et la mer glaciale (Utrecht, 1697), and * Nouveau voyage d'un pays plus grand que l'Europe (Utrecht, 1698). * A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America (2 volumes); reprinted from the second London issue of 1698 with facsimiles of original title-pages, maps, and illustrations, and the addition of Introduction, Notes, and Index By Reuben Gold Thwaites. A.C. McClurg & Co., Chicago, 1903. The truth of much of Hennepin's accounts has been called into question \u2014 or flatly denied \u2014 notably by American historian Francis Parkman, himself also cited for cultural bias, including against both French and Native Americans. ==Legacy== Places named after Hennepin are found in the United States and Canada: Illinois: * The city of Hennepin, Illinois * Hennepin Room at Starved Rock Lodge and Conference Centre in Utica, Illinois * The Hennepin Canal Michigan: * Point Hennepin, the northern tip of Grosse Ile, an island on the Detroit River south of Detroit * Hennepin Street in Garden City, Michigan * Hennepin Road in Marquette, Michigan * Hennepin, significant as the first self-unloading bulk carrier.
