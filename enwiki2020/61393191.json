    "text": "Prince Carl Gustav, Duke of Sm\u00e5land (25 August 1782 - 23 March 1783) was a prince of Sweden. ==Early life== Born at Drottningholm, Gustav was the second son in the marriage of King Gustav III (1746\u20131792) and Queen Sophia Magdalena (1746\u20131813) of Sweden. He had one elder sibling, Gustav Adolph who would become King of Sweden. The baby was described as strong, healthy and big, and born as he was shortly after the death of King Gustav's mother, Carl Gustav's father was especially fond of him. == Death == In March 1783 the young prince suddenly took ill, probably from inappropriate foodErik L\u00f6nnroth in Den stora rollen p. 84 and died when he was little over a half year old. He was interred in Riddarholm Church in Stockholm. His father took the death very hard and had never been seen so grief stricken, unable even to attend the little boy's funeral. After Carl Gustav's death Gustav III began new phases in his own life, travelling far away from Sweden, gradually increasing his power and starting war. Several writers have attributed the change in his personality and activity at least in part to his strong reaction at the death of his second son.Oswald Kuylenstierna in Gustav III; Hans Liv, Person och G\u00e4rning, Stockholm 1921 p 138Leif Land\u00e9n in Gustaf III en biografi p. 61 == Arms == File:Serafimersk\u00f6ld Prince Charles Gustave Duc Smaland 1782-1783 Riddarholmen.svg|Coat of arms of Prince Carl Gustav, Duke of Sm\u00e5land ==References== Category:1782 births Category:1783 deaths Carl Gustav 1782 Category:House of Oldenburg Category:People from Stockholm Category:Burials at Riddarholmen Church Category:Sons of kings ",
