The depot in Clio was constructed in 1873 to service the line. The building was used by the railroad until 1960. After its use as a depot was discontinued, it spent some time as a laundromat. The building was purchased by the Clio Area Historic Association in 1977, and was renovated in the 1980s to turn into a museum. ==Description== The Clio Depot is a one-story vernacular frame structure clad with clapboard. The building is rectangular and has a gable roof.
