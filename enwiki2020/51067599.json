His son, Jean-Claude B\u00e9d\u00e9no Dejaure, called Dejaure fils was also a playwright. == Life == When he presented his first plays to the Italian actors, for them to treat him with some respect, Dejaure had added the title \"Baron\" to his name, although he was the son of a merchant. But after his early success, he renounced this title, which he no longer needed. From 1789 to 1795, he gave the Com\u00e9die-Italienne as well as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, eighteen theatre plays, comedies, operas and op\u00e9ras comiques (including several with Rodolphe Kreutzer), of little invention but interesting, with dramatic effects and morality, which have been successful for most of them. == Main works == *1789: Les \u00c9poux r\u00e9unis, one-act comedy, in verse *1790: Ferdinand ou la Suite des Deux Pages, one-act op\u00e9ra comique *1791: Lodo\u00efska ou les Tartares, three-act op\u00e9ra-comique, music by Rodolphe Kreutzer *1791: Louise de Valsan, three-act comedy *1791: L\u2019Incertitude maternelle ou la Chose impossible, comedy in one act and in verse *1791: Le Franc-Breton ou le N\u00e9gociant de Nantes, comedy in one act and in verse, later transformed into an op\u00e9ra comique on a music by Kreutzer *1796: Imog\u00e8ne ou la Gageure indiscr\u00e8te, op\u00e9ra comique in three acts and in verse imitated from Cymbeline by Shakespeare *1798: La Dot de Suzette, one-act op\u00e9ra comique mingled with ariettes, music by Fran\u00e7ois-Adrien Bo\u00efeldieu *1798: Les Quiproquos espagnols, two-act opera with ariettes, music by Devienne *1799: Montano et St\u00e9phanie, three-act op\u00e9ra comique, music by Henri Montan BertonThe third act of this play was remade in 1801 by Gabriel-Marie Legouv\u00e9. *1801: Astyanax, three-act op\u00e9ra comique, music by Kreutzer. ==References== == Sources == * Ferdinand Hoefer, Nouvelle Biographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, t.XIII, Paris, Firmin-Didot, 1866, (p. 375-6). == External links == * Jean-\u00c9lie B\u00e9d\u00e9no Dejaure on C\u00c9SAR * Jean-\u00c9lie B\u00e9d\u00e9no Dejaure on Data.bnf.fr Category:Writers from Paris Category:18th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:1761 births Category:1799 deaths ",
