Lautenschlager reimbursed some of the costs and paid a fine of $784. Her driver's license was also revoked for a year. Also in 2004, a state Ethics Board investigated Lautenschlager's use of her state car, ruling that her personal use of it exceeded state-allowed limits but finding \"no corrupt motive or intention to obtain a dishonest advantage\". ====Re-election campaign==== In 2006, Lautenschlager faced a Democratic challenger, Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, a 2002 candidate for Governor and former Assistant Attorney General.
