It is the seat of W\u0142odawa County, situated in the Lublin Voivodeship since 1999. it has a population of 14,800. ==Geography== The town lies along the borders of Poland with both, westernmost Belarus and Ukraine, on the banks of the Bug River, from Che\u0142m in Poland and Brest in Belarus; from Terespol, from Lublin, and from Liuboml in the Volyn Oblast of Ukraine. It is close to the Belarusian southernmost strip of the Brest Raion within the Brest Region bordering with north-western Ukraine. ==History== W\u0142odawa was first mentioned in historical records in 1242. The first written mention of the town in an Old Slavonic chronicle which speaks about Prince Daniel staying there, escaping from the Tartars in 1241. In 1446-1447 the surrounding territories were annexed into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the river W\u0142odawka marked the border between the Duchy and the Polish Crown within the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Union. In 1475 Micha\u0142 and Aleksander Sanguszko received the town in exchange with the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon. For the next 100 years the town became the home for the Sanguszko family. They built their castle here and developed the town's prosperity. The Sanguszko profited from the border crossing which was bringing good income. In 1534 the town received city rights, confirmed in 1540. At that time the influx of the Jewish population started, which promoted commerce and crafts. The location on the large river, Bug, favored the rapid development of the city as a commercial and transit center. By the end of the 16th century, W\u0142odawa passed into the hands of Andrzej Leszczy\u0144ski and from that time belonged to the Leszczy\u0144ski family for next generations. As Leszczy\u0144ski was a Calvinist, W\u0142odawa soon became an important center of Protestantism. In 1624 a Calvinist church and a school were built here. Between 1633 and 1648, the minister of the Calvinist congregation in W\u0142odawa was Polish historian and poet Andrzej W\u0119gierski. In 1634 a Calvinist synod was held in W\u0142odawa, which was attended by delegates from the entire Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Protestants from Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia also settled in W\u0142odawa at that time. Baroque Pauline monastery in W\u0142odawa In 1648, the Cossack-Tatar army plundered and destroyed the city, killing almost the entire population, including all Jews. In 1657 the city was devastated again, this time by the Swedes during the Deluge. John III Sobieski and the subsequent Polish kings granted the right to four annual fairs. Horses and, above all, oxen from nearby Volhynia were sold at these fairs, with the latter being even sold to Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, Berlin and Vienna. These fairs, as well as the staple right for salt contributed to W\u0142odawa's wealth. In the 17th century, Rafa\u0142 Leszczy\u0144ski, father of the future Polish King Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, became the owner of W\u0142odawa, but due to debts he sold it to Ludwik Pociej. Pociej brought the Paulines from the Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery in Cz\u0119stochowa to W\u0142odawa and built their monastery. In the 18th century, the city was the property of the Pociej, Flemming, Czartoryski and Zamoyski families. After the Partitions of Poland, W\u0142odawa was annexed by Austria in 1795. In 1809, it briefly returned to Polish rule, being part of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it became part of Congress Poland, initially autonomous, but later forcibly integrated within Imperial Russia. The inhabitants of W\u0142odawa actively joined the January Uprising in 1863. After the fall of the uprising, bloody repressions began and the attempts at Russification intensified. During World War I, from 1915 to 1918, the city was occupied by the Germans. Polish Military Cemetery from World War II Following Poland's return to independence, W\u0142odawa became a seat of the W\u0142odawa County. In 1939, before the onset of World War II, the population of W\u0142odawa was 9,293. There was a garrison of heavy artillery regiment and the division of the field artillery in the town, used by the Pomorze and the Modlin armies in the defence of Poland against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. W\u0142odawa was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 3 September 1939. ===Ethnic Minorities=== ====Jewish community==== Great Synagogue dating back to the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth The existence of a Jewish community in W\u0142odawa is first recorded in connection with the Lublin fair of 1531. By 1623 W\u0142odawa had a representative in the Council of the Four Lands. The community's prosperity was due to the granting of a city charter in 1534. For much of the early modern period, a time when the Polish-speaking community of the region was predominately engaged in agriculture, Jews appear to have composed much of the population of the city, engaged in all forms of craft production and trade. The community was devastated by the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648,Squaring of the Circle: Polish-Jewish Relations Through the Ages : the Story of an Unrequited Love, By Arnon Rubin, by Tel Aviv University Press, 2005, p. 10 but afterwards re-established and rebuilt. By 1765 the town had 630 Jews. In 1693, the town had 197 dwellings, 89 owned by Jewish families. The census of 1773 records Jewish physicians, butchers, millers, barbers, goldsmiths, tailors, furriers, merchants, and carters, in addition to one Jew in each of the trades of coppersmith, cobbler, glazier, chandler, and wheelwright. There were also 8 schoolmasters, 2 educators, a cantor, a bass player and a cymbal player.The complex of Synagogue Buildings in Wlodawa, Malgorzata Podlewska-Bem, Leczynsko-Wlodawskie Lakeland Museum, Wlodawa There were 2,236 Jews in 1827 and 6,706 in 1907. In the late 19th century W\u0142odawa had a Jewish-owned steam- powered flour mill, tannery and soap factory. Of the 184 stores in the town, 177 were owned by Jews. W\u0142odawa's first Zionist organization was formed in 1898, the town also had Bund, Agudath Israel and Poalei Zion organizations. There was a Beis Yaakov school for girls also.Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust, Shmuel Spector, NYU Press, 2001, Vol 3, p. 1452 Small Synagogue, 18th century W\u0142odawa was over 70% Jewish before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland and the Holocaust. The city became part of the Nazi German Lublin District of the General Government following the invasion. W\u0142odawa Ghetto was set up by the German administration in 1941. Jews from all neighbouring locations were sent there. The Ghetto was overcrowded and lacked food and medicine. Starvation and disease were common. Round ups for the Holocaust transports to the nearby Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp took place in waves: 1,300 Jews in May 1942, 5,400 in October, 2,800 in November 1942, and 2,000 in April 1943, as well as the last 150 in May 1943. In June, all remaining Jewish children under the age of 10 were deported and gassed. During the ghetto liquidation action, at the end of October 1942 hundreds of Jews escaped to the surrounding forests. W\u0142odawa Jews were mostly deported Sobib\u00f3r, but some were executed locally at the German Arbeitslager workcamps such as the one at Adampol. Several Jews from Adampol and the W\u0142odawa Ghetto were able to escape, and joined the Parczew partisans in the forests, fighting actively against the Nazis with Soviet assistance and weapons. The Jewish cemetery was demolished by the Germans who used the headstones as road building material, and turned the Synagogue into military storage. On the road to W\u0142odawa there is a memorial to the Jews from W\u0142odawa who were killed at Adampol. No Jews are known to live in the town today, although the handsome, Baroque, Wlodawa Synagogue serves as major tourist attraction. A W\u0142odawa landsmenschafte (society) was founded in America for survivors and descendants of W\u0142odawa's Jewish Community and has members scattered throughout the US, Canada, Australia, England, Israel and elsewhere. London had a Wlodawa Synagogue (London). ====Amish Community==== In the 1700s, while some Amish families traveled west from Germany and Switzerland in their quest for religious freedom in Pennsylvania, others would venture to Central and Eastern Europe. In 1781, the Austrian emperor Joseph II invited German farmers to move to Galicia, after seizing the region (which today lies in southeastern Poland and Western Ukraine) in the First Partition of Poland. Other Amish however settled the area of W\u0142odawa, which was then still part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Nolt, A History of the Amish, p. 64-65). ==Points of interest== Gabriel S\u0142awi\u0144ski (pl), 1784-1785 There are several monuments and tourist attractions worth seeing in W\u0142odawa: * Saint Louis church and baroque monastery, founded by Pauline Monks in the 18th century.
