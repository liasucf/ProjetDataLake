Suseela. The film stars Visu, Vijayakanth, Srividya, S. V. Sekhar and Viji. The film had musical score by M. S. Viswanathan. The film was remade in Kannada as Madhuve Madu Tamashe Nodu. It was based on a play by Visu and Kathadi Ramamurthy. The film is a black comedy showing the evils of Dowry. ==Plot== Ganeshan and Ethiraj are best friends and colleagues. Ethiraj is a widower and an alcoholic while Ganeshan is married and has a sister and a brother. Ganeshan does not earn enough and borrows from Ethiraj and Rowthar, a Muslim man who frequently runs a grocery shop. A misunderstanding arises when Ethiraj's mother proposes marriage between Ganeshan's sister and Ethiraj leading to a rift in their friendship. He challenges that he would get his sister married in a pompous manner. However, the groom's family is behind dowry. The mother of the groom runs the family tyrannically. How Ganeshan struggles to make ends meet with many subplots makes it an interesting movie to watch. In the end, with help from many people, he gets his sister married only for his own sister to ask him about the remainder of the dowry. ==Cast== *Visu as Ganesan *Vijayakanth as Ethiraj *Srividya as Uma *S.
