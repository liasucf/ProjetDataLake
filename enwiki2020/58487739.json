Songs from it were performed by multiple musical collectives and individual soloists (including Razin, Svetlichny, Maslov, Samoshin and others). In 1992, Barefoot Girl was released. At that time, the soloist was Vasyuta. In album releases, he is listed as the author of the songs. In the middle 1990s, Maslov made an attempt to create a group with the same name. They released two albums with the vocals of Samoshin and Ruslan Maslov (Vladimir's son). Vasyuta took Maslov to court and won the case; the next album of Maslov-Samoshin team did not mention Sweet Sleep. Vasyuta continues to promote the group. He releases albums and tours. Sweet Sleep appears on television. Most of the time, Vasyuta performs in Germany. In Russia he performs at corporate festivals with 1980's stars.\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0412\u0430\u0441\u044e\u0442\u044b \u0442\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u00ab\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430\u00bb In October 2000, Vasyuta was reportedly unable to tour and was looking for a performance double. ==References == ==External links== * Official site * \u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u044f \u0412\u0430\u0441\u044e\u0442\u044b * \u0414\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 Category:Musical groups established in 1989 Category:Soviet pop music groups Category:Russian pop music groups ",
