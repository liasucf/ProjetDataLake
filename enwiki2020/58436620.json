Her paper, \"An industrial revolution of the thirteenth century,\" was \"widely read,\" and discussed how medieval textile workers made significant contributions to the technology of textile work in England. Her work led to the \"discovery of the importance of rural industry in late-medieval England,\" according to The Economic History Review. She, along with scholars, Lewis Mumford and Marc Bloch, \"captured the imaginations of a younger generation of scholars in the emergent field of the history of technology with their new vision of medieval technological prowess.\" Carus-Wilson studied 13th century England's textile industry and described a \"rapid adoption of waterpowered fulling.\" Her article used research drawn from primary sources such as royal and ecclesiastical records. Her research showed a type of revolution in technology that was similar to the Industrial Revolution in the amount of change it caused in 13th century England and how quickly it was adopted. In the early 1960s, she contributed 2 chapters on the wool industry to the second volume of the Cambridge Economic History of Europe (1963), which The Economic History Review called \"valuable.\" == Publications == *Medieval Merchant Venturers (London, 1954) - collected essays, 1929 to 1950. *England's Export Trade 1275\u20131547, with Olive Coleman (Oxford, 1963). ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Profile Category:1897 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Academics from Montreal Category:People educated at St Paul's Girls' School Category:Alumni of Westfield College Category:British women historians Category:Economic historians Category:Academics of the London School of Economics Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:Historians from Quebec Category:Canadian emigrants to England ",
