The 1944 H\u00fcrtgen Forest Peace Museum (Friedensmuseum H\u00fcrtgenwald 1944) was opened on 29 March 1983 in Kleinhau in a stone barn. Its aim was to recall the heavy fighting during the Second World War in the Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest, in which the Americans suffered a costly defeat. In setting up the museum, Konrad Schall from Winden gathered many exhibits: vehicles, documents, uniforms and other artefacts that witness to the battles in the surrounding area. Later, part of the exhibition was taken over by the municipality from Schall's legacy. They, in turn, transferred it to the H\u00fcrtgen Forest History Society (Geschichtsverein H\u00fcrtgenwald). On 15 September 2001 the present 1944 H\u00fcrtgen Forest Museum (Museum H\u00fcrtgenwald 1944 und im Frieden) was opened. The peace museum is divided into the following themed rooms: * H\u00fcrtgen Forest Local History * The Siegfried Line in the area of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest * Card room * The Wehrmacht in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest * The US Army in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest * The H\u00fcrtgen Forest in the post-war period == External links == * Official website * Wissenschaftliche Bestandsaufnahme zum Museum, RWTH Aachen und Uni K\u00f6ln (pdf; 1,9 MB) H\u00fcrtgen Forest H\u00fcrtgen Forest H\u00fcrtgen Forest ",
