Kamminga is also credited with the discovery of the Malakunanja site and excavations at Nauwalabila where possibly the oldest dates for Aboriginal occupation have been found in Australia.Alice Roberts, The Incredible Human Journey, A&C; Black, 5 Apr 2010 He directed the archaeological survey of the Alligator River in Arnhem Land in the 1970s in part contributing to the declaration of the area as part of Kakadu National Park, and undertook research projects at La Trobe University Sydney University and the Australian National University in the 1980s. Kamminga has been involved in some contentious areas in the field of archaeology, such as taking up the issue of perceived bias in the appointments of academics to positions in Prehistory departments in Australian Universities, in particular the favouring of Cambridge University graduates.Challenging a Cambridge academic colony down under, Tertangala (University of Wollongong Students' Representative Council), Vol. 16, No. 2, June 1990, p. 8; Curio, Vol. 21, 11-20 June 1990, pp. 22-23; Academic colonies. Honi Soit, No. 2, July 1990, pp. 18-19 He has also taken up the cause of protection of Aboriginal sites against development.James Woodford, 'Bones of contention block beach development', Sydney Morning Herald, 17 April 2004 Kamminga is also consultant to the erotic garden and tea house created by Kattai Kamminga in Chiang Mai, Thailand.Chiang Mai Citylife 2015 Issue 02, The Art of Erecting a Garden ==Publications== * Kamminga, J., 1978.
