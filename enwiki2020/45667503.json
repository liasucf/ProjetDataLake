    "text": "Dupla Identidade (literally Double Identity; English title: Merciless) is a 2014 Brazilian crime drama television series created by Gl\u00f3ria Perez. It was produced and aired by Rede Globo. This was the first Brazilian series entirely recorded and post-produced in 4K. ==Plot== Eduardo Borges (Bruno Gagliasso), or Edu, is a young man above all suspicion: handsome, smart, and sensitive. However, his perfect man appearance is simply a mask that covers up his fearsome personality: a dangerous psychopath behind a number of crimes that have caught the police's attention. A cold, conniving, and callous criminal; a serial killer who kills purely out of pleasure. Edu gets romantically involved with Ray (D\u00e9bora Falabella), a compassionate and daring young woman who sees in him the personification of the perfect man. Erratic and emotionally unstable, Ray bets everything on this romance, letting herself be manipulated by her boyfriend, without suspecting his double life. Unable to solve the murders, the police put together a team equipped with the most advanced forensic techniques, led by Chief Dias (Marcello Novaes) and the psychologist Vera (Luana Piovani), a specialist in criminal behavior. Both with contrasting personalities, they have already worked together in the past, and were once in a troubled relationship. This reencounter brings back old feelings, revealing that there still is a spark between them. Due to a work-related matter, Edu manages to infiltrate the police. Oblivious to the fact that the killer is close by, they start an electrifying pursuit of the serial killer, who is deliberately leaving clues to challenge them. Edu becomes fascinated with playing mind games on Vera, who is determined to find out who the killer is and how he commits his crimes. ==Cast and characters== * Bruno Gagliasso as Eduardo \"Edu\" Borges/Brian Borges * D\u00e9bora Falabella as Rayane \"Ray\" Gurgel * Luana Piovani as Vera M\u00fcller * Marcello Novaes as Delegado Alexandre Dias * Marisa Orth as Silvia Veiga * Aderbal Freire Filho as Senador Oto Veiga * Mariana Nunes as Dina * Bernardo Mendes as Junior (Oto Veiga Junior) * Luana Tanaka as Elda * Paulo Tiefenthaler as Nelson Pereira * Igor Angelkorte as Ivan * Glaucio Gomes as Assis * Felipe Hintze as C\u00edcero * Thiar\u00e9 Maia as Claudia * Brenda Sabryna as Tatiana \"Tati\" Dias * Maria Eduarda Miliante as Larissa Gurgel ==Awards and nominations== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !Year !Award !Category !Nominated work !Result |- |rowspan=11|2014 | Pr\u00eamio Extra de Televis\u00e3o | Best Author | Gl\u00f3ria Perez | |- | rowspan=2| Trof\u00e9u APCA | Best Actor | Bruno Gagliasso | |- | Best Director | Mauro Mendon\u00e7a Filho | |- |rowspan=2| Melhores do Ano | Best Actor (Series/Miniseries) | Bruno Gagliasso | |- | Best Actress (Series/Miniseries) | Luana Piovani | |- | rowspan=4 | Pr\u00eamio F5 | Best TV Series Creator | Gl\u00f3ria Perez | |- | Best Actor (Series/Miniseries) | Bruno Gagliasso | |- | Best Supporting Actor (Series/Miniseries) | Marcello Novaes | |- | Best Supporting Actress (Series/Miniseries) | D\u00e9bora Falabella | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Retrospectiva UOL | Best Actor | Bruno Gagliasso | |- | Best Actress | D\u00e9bora Falabella | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s Brazilian television series Category:2010s crime drama television series Category:2010s mystery television series Category:2014 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2014 Brazilian television series endings Category:Brazilian crime television series Category:Brazilian drama television series Category:Brazilian mystery television series Category:Brazilian thriller television series Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:Rede Globo original programming Category:Telenovelas by Gl\u00f3ria Perez Category:Television series about fictional serial killers Category:Television shows set in Brazil ",
