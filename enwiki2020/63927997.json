Her research considers HIV, viral hepatitis, emerging infections and tropical infections in developing countries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside working on the front lines of the response, \u00c7evik was an advisor to the Chief Medical Officer of Scotland and the World Health Organisation. == Early life and education == \u00c7evik is from Turkey. She studied medicine at the Ege University Faculty of Medicine. As a medical student, \u00c7evik was involved with projects and youth organisations related to sexual health. She served on the executive committee of the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations committee on reproductive health. In this capacity she worked with international organisations including United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNAIDS and MTV. Working with the UNFPA, \u00c7evik delivered an international peer education training programme on sexual and reproductive health and rights. \u00c7evik secured funding from the United States Embassy Youth Empowerment Grants to study HIV related stigma in health care settings. The outcomes of this research transformed curricula in eleven medical schools, and was presented at the XVII International AIDS Conference, 2008 in Mexico. As a result of her advocacy, in 2009 (at already at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine), \u00c7evik was invited to join the UNAIDS programme coordinating board meeting. \u00c7evik leading international peer-education programmes during her medical degree. She moved to London for her graduate studies, completing a master's degree in public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and University College London. Her research considered HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Her studies were sponsored by an international postgraduate scholarship from Rotary International, which is awarded annually to distinguished leaders around the world. She was appointed a clinical researcher at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where she completed her specialist training in internal medicine. \u00c7evik completed her Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians in 2015. She is currently undertaking doctoral research at the University of St Andrews. == Research and career == In 2016 \u00c7evik moved to Scotland, where she joined NHS Lothian as a Senior Registrar in infectious diseases. Her research considers HIV and tuberculosis. She has studied the epidemiology of these diseases in South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. \u00c7evik is leading a phase 3 clinical trial that looks to reduce the treatment time for patients with drug resistant tuberculosis. In 2020 she was awarded a Clinical Academic Training Fellowship, supported by the Chief Scientist Office Scotland, to establish the biological mechanisms that underpin a poor response to tuberculosis treatment in patients in Kampala. === Leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic === During the COVID-19 pandemic \u00c7evik served an advisor to the Chief Medical Officer of Scotland and the World Health Organisation. As part of this work, \u00c7evik is working on the management of misinformation surrounding coronavirus disease. Throughout the pandemic she provided expert commentary to the public about coronavirus disease. \u00c7evik made use of Twitter to keep the public up-to-date with coronavirus-related research. She identified that, as of May 2020, evidence indicated that transmission often occurred after sustained close contact and indoors, such as within households, family gatherings, connected indoor environments such as restaurants and offices. Cevik called for more comprehensive contact tracing data to better understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Working with Colin McCowan, Cevik investigated household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland. Working with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), \u00c7evik has looked to transfer clinical studies related to coronavirus disease to developing countries. She created a series of guidelines for clinicians outlining how they should respond to SARS-CoV-2. As part of her work with ISARIC, \u00c7evik looks to identify the risk factors for severe illness in patients with Comorbidities such as HIV. She works with ISARIC on rapid scientific reviews that can inform government policy. Writing in the BMJ, \u00c7evik highlighted the importance of ensuring HIV status and testing is included in the management of COVID-19. alt= === Academic service === \u00c7evik is Associate Editor of the Elsevier journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection. She serves on the steering committee of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), as well as leading an Erasmus Programme project that looks to implement infectious diseases training in undergraduate medical education. She serves on the executive committees of the Scottish Microbiology & Virology Network and the British HIV Association. Alongside her academic research, \u00c7evik is interested in science communication and how physicians can best use social media to disseminate their research. She has made use of social media network analysis to understand how scientists and physicians use Twitter. Her interest in science communication resulted in her developing the BHIVA social media strategy. == Selected works and publications == * * * * == References == ==External links== * Muge Cevik at University of St Andrews School of Medicine * Muge Cevik at University of St Andrews Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Coronavirus researchers Category:Turkish physicians Category:21st- century British medical doctors Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Ege University alumni Category:Science communicators Category:Turkish women scientists Category:British women scientists ",
