Cola Daily https://www.coladaily.com/2018/08/15/laura- alice-spong/. She graduated cum laude from Vanderbilt University, where she majored in English and first took drawing classes, in 1948, married later that year, and moved with her husband to Columbia, South Carolina. Between 1949 and 1959 Spong had six children.Roefs, Wim (2011). \"Laura Spong: a Chronology,\" Laura Spong, 2006-2011: Age as an Administrative Device. Columbia SC: if ART Gallery, p. 22 ==Career== Beginning in the mid-1950s Spong took art classes at the Richland Art School of the Columbia Museum of Art.Roefs, Wim (2011). \"Laura Spong: a Chronology,\" Laura Spong, 2006-2011: Age as an Administrative Device. Columbia SC: if ART Gallery, p. 22 Among her instructors there were J. Bardin and Gil Petroff, two of the modern artists who introduced New York School paradigms to mid-century Columbia.Gilkerson, Mary Bentz (2011). \"Laura Spong's Compositional Dance,\" Laura Spong, 2006-2011: Age as an Administrative Device. Columbia SC: if ART Gallery, p. 7 Spong became a member of the Columbia Artists' Guild and in 1957 was one of three winners of the guild's spring exhibition at the Columbia Museum of Art. From that year Spong was an active member of the Columbia art community, her work often recognized by inclusion in juried exhibitions and awards in the region.Roefs, Wim (2011). \"Laura Spong: a Chronology,\" Laura Spong, 2006-2011: Age as an Administrative Device. Columbia SC: if ART Gallery, p. 22 After her husband's death in 1973, Spong worked for the Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation for ten years, but continued to paint and exhibit. It was not until the mid to late-1980s, however, that Spong became a full-time artist. She took a studio space at Vista Studios in downtown Columbia in 1991. She was enormously productive thereafter, with her work seen in many solo and group exhibitions, receiving awards, and being acquired for public and private collections.Roefs, Wim (2011). \"Laura Spong: a Chronology,\" Laura Spong, 2006-2011: Age as an Administrative Device. Columbia SC: if ART Gallery, pp. 22-25 She was active to the end of her life, completing works shortly before her death.Ellis, Sarah (2018). \"Laura Spong: Obituary,\" The State newspaper https://www.thestate.com/news/local/article216646900.html ==Work== From the beginning of her career, Spong worked mostly in a vernacular associated with Abstract Expressionism. Her mature style developed gradually, moving away from geometric to more organic gesture in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Roefs, Wim (2016). \"The Persistent Laura Spong,\" Laura Spong at 90: Six Decades in Painting. Columbia SC: if ART Gallery, pp. 3-4. According to Mary Bentz Gilkerson, Spong's mature work has more affinity with the paintings of Robert Motherwell and Joan Mitchell, than with Jackson Pollock. \"Line in her work,\" according to Gilkerson, \"moves between calligraphic and pictographic, alluding to, without ever specifying, representational images.\"Gilkerson, Mary Bentz (2011). \"Laura Spong's Compositional Dance,\" Laura Spong, 2006-2011: Age as an Administrative Device.
