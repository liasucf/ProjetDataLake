    "text": "Sistema Globo de R\u00e1dio (in English: Globo Radio System), or SGR, is a Brazilian media group owned by Grupo Globo that began with the inauguration of R\u00e1dio Globo in 1944, and today it has control of several other radios from different parts of Brazil. SGR also operates in the Pay-TV segment, where its radios offer music programming options to more than 6 million subscribers of NET, Sky Brazil, Oi TV and Claro TV operators. In 1975, the SGR began to adopt a logo whose letters resemble that of Globo Network, made by Hans Donner with the color dark blue, with the name of \"Sistema Globo de R\u00e1dio\". In 2009, the SGR started to have a distinct visual identity of Globo, adopting a logo in the colors blue and gray, with the name SGR. Previously, the group operated in the web radio segment, with Multishow FM, GNT Radio, Radio Canal Brasil and Radio Impacto, as well as Globo FM and RadioBeat, which replaced its former terrestrial stations in Rio de Janeiro. In 2015, with the extinction of these last two, the SGR stopped operating with web radios. == Stations == * BH FM - 102.1 MHz * CBN RJ - 92.5 MHz * CBN SP - 90.5 MHz * CBN Bras\u00edlia - 95.3 MHz * CBN Belo Horizonte -106.1 MHz * Radio Globo RJ - 98.1 MHz == External links == * - Grupo Globo Category:Mass media in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Grupo Globo subsidiaries Category:1944 establishments in Brazil ",
