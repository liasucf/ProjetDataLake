    "text": "Howling Bells is the self-titled debut album of London-based Australian indie rock band Howling Bells. The album was released through Bella Union in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2006. It was produced, engineered and mixed by Ken Nelson and was recorded at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool, in early 2005. The album was predominantly written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Juanita Stein. The majority of the album's themes revolve around her own relationships and feelings of affection. Most of the songs were demoed in Australia, but all were recorded in England, as the band relocated there to work with Ken Nelson. Five singles were released from the album, four of which appeared on the UK Singles Chart. The album peaked in the Top 100 in the UK and just outside the Top 50 in Australia. It was, at the time, the fastest selling album on the Bella Union label, and it appeared on album of the year lists in eight different publications. In 2006, Howling Bells was a finalist for the Australian Music Prize Award and a nominee for the Shortlist Music Prize. The 12-track set features a wide array of music styles, including rock, pop, country, folk and blues. Howling Bells performed at numerous club shows and festivals around the world to promote the album. They supported various artists, including Editors, Mercury Rev, Placebo, Snow Patrol and The Killers. In general, Howling Bells was received extremely well by music critics. Those who reviewed it less favourably argued that the album's content was superficial and that the songs were repetitive at times. ==Background== Most of the song lyrics on Howling Bells were written by Juanita Stein when she took time off from the band's previous incarnation, the Sydney-based pop rock group Waikiki. All members of Howling Bells were also in Waikiki. After growing discontent with their pop rock sound, the band members opted to assume an indie rock identity and changed their name to Howling Bells. The group began to perform material from Howling Bells while still called Waikiki. The majority of the lyrical subject matter centres on Juanita's own interpersonal relationships.Cohen, Ben (31 March 2009). \"We Meet The Howling Bells\". t5m Insider. The 5th Medium Ltd.

Afterward, drummer Glenn Moule, guitarist Joel Stein, and bass guitarist Brendan Picchio arranged the music around her words.Fletcher, Jon (November 2006). \"Interview: Howling Bells\". New-Noise.

The band found a country house in the mountains of Victoria, where they spent a month creating demo tracks for the album. \"Broken Bones\" and \"Blessed Night\" were the only two tracks not to be demoed in Australia. \"I'm Not Afraid\", the album's last track, was written by Peter Stein (Joel and Juanita's father), who is also a songwriter and musician.\"Juanita Stein\".

After hearing Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head, they agreed that was how they wanted their album to sound. They sent demos to Ken Nelson, who was responsible for producing A Rush of Blood to the Head. Nelson soon responded, stating that he would be interested in working with them.Fungus, Slender (14 May 2009). \"Howling Bells Interview \u2013 We Talked to Juanita Stein from Coldplay's Latest Support Act\". Coldplay official website. EMI (IP) Ltd. Archived from the original on 24 May 2009. Retrieved 26 February 2011. With little financial security, they relocated to London and waited for Nelson to finish production on Coldplay's X&Y.; The start date of the recording of Howling Bells was repeatedly delayed because Coldplay was dissatisfied with its studio sessions. In the meantime, to support themselves, the members of Howling Bells took up temporary work. Eight to ten months after their arrival in England, Nelson contacted them with the news that he would soon be ready to record. ==Recording and getting signed== In early 2005, the band started recording Howling Bells at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool. Some of Coldplay's equipment from the X&Y; sessions was still in the facility when Howling Bells arrived. They recorded Howling Bells in two to three months, with all the main vocal and instrument tracking done in real time, as if in a live setting. This was a staple of Nelson's recording approach. Due to the personal significance of her songs, Juanita had the studio lights turned off in order to make the recording experience feel more private. The band appreciated Nelson's techniques and studio abilities. They stated that he was great sonically and very adept at de-emphasising some songs that they had initially approached overzealously. They also expressed that they felt fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with the award-winning producer.

Note: Included in 26 May 2006 print edition. Tim DiGravina of Allmusic wrote that \"shallow subject matter, often goofy rhyming lyrics, and a heavy-handed use of falsetto sometimes sidetracks the album as a whole.\" He also argued that \"The Night is Young\" stole structural elements and the guitar conclusion of Coldplay's \"Yellow\". However, he added that \"the good ultimately outweighs the bad, making for a flawed but still satisfying debut.\" Emily Mackay of Playlouder compared the band with The Duke Spirit, Sons and Daughters and Tarnation, and she commented, \"Howling Bells have crafted a unique, glossy, gothic gloom.\" She finished with a word of caution: \"It veers close, however, to being too polished ...
