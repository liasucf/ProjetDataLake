Tisei served in the House until 1990, when he was elected to the Massachusetts Senate. He was elected Assistant Minority Leader in 1997 and Minority Leader in January 2007.

He decided not to challenge him in 1996. ===2010 statewide election=== On July 28, 2009, Tisei was named the campaign chair for Charlie Baker's 2010 gubernatorial run. On November 23, 2009, Baker named Tisei as his running mate, and thus as a candidate for lieutenant governor. Just prior to the announcement of Tisei as Baker's running mate, Tisei publicly disclosed that he is gay for the first time in an interview with the Boston Globe. Baker and Tisei, unopposed in the Republican primary, were defeated in the general election. The Patrick/Murray ticket defeated Baker/Tisei 48%\u201342%.

They won Wakefield, where Tisei currently resides, 56%\u201337%, and Lynnfield, where Tisei grew up, 66%\u201329%. ===2012 congressional election=== In November 2011, Tisei announced his plans to challenge eight-term U.S. Congressman John F. Tierney (D-MA 6th). The newly redrawn Massachusetts's 6th congressional district remained largely the same, but added Billerica, Tewksbury, and Andover. This was a swing district where Scott Brown got 58% of the vote in January 2010 and where Baker/Tisei got 50% in the November 2010 gubernatorial election. Tierney barely came out on top over Tisei, by 3,500 votes out of 374,244 cast. The race was the closest in New England. Tisei\u2019s campaign made a number of payments for a political consultant, campaign aides, a fundraiser, and a digital marketing firm in 2011 from a state campaign fund. David Scharfenberg of The Boston Globe speculated that the payments were to support his campaign for Congress. The Tisei campaign has noted that the payments were all made prior to his official declaration of candidacy for Congress and that they were for activities in support of a potential run for state-level office. ===2014 congressional election=== Tisei ran against Democratic nominee Seth Moulton in 2014. It was widely thought that he would face incumbent Congressman John F. Tierney in a rematch from the 2012 race. But on September 9, Tierney became the fourth member of the U.S. House of Representatives to lose a primary election in the 2014 cycle. Roll Call previously called the race between Tierney and Tisei a \"Toss up\", but did not re-evaluate the race after the primary upset. Tisei boycotted the Republican state convention because of the \"socially conservative platform the party adopted.\" But the National Republican Congressional Committee has given him \"On the Radar\" status, meaning that the NRCC \"will help to provide candidates and their campaigns the tools they need to run successful, winning campaigns.\" He was endorsed by the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund but was soundly beaten by Moulton in the general election, by 149,638 votes (54.97%) to 111,989 (41.13%). ==Political views== Tisei has stated about his political ideology: \"I have a pretty independent voting record. I try not to be an ideologue. I look at every issue that comes up individually...\" The Martha's Vineyard Times reported that Tisei \"sees himself as a traditional Republican, believing in individualism, limited government involvement in people's personal lives, and an emphasis on the role of the individual\" and as \"a libertarian on social issues.\" ==Personal life== In July 2013 Tisei and his longtime partner Bernie Starr were married. They reside in Wakefield. They also own a home at the Katama neighborhood of Edgartown, Massachusetts at Martha's Vineyard. Since 1992, Tisei has been a real estate broker with Northrup Associate Realtors. In 2000, Tisei became co- owner of Northrup with Starr. ==References== ==External links== * Campaign website * * * Campaign contributions at OpenSecrets.org Category:1962 births Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American real estate brokers Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:American University alumni Category:Candidates in the 2010 United States elections Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT state legislators in Massachusetts Category:Living people Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:Massachusetts state senators Category:Politicians from Somerville, Massachusetts Category:People from Wakefield, Massachusetts Category:People from Edgartown, Massachusetts ",
