    "text": "Twelve Forever is an American animated web series created by Julia Vickerman, a former writer and storyboard artist known for her work on Clarence and The Powerpuff Girls. Twelve Forever premiered in the United States on Netflix on July 29, 2019. The original pilot was produced for Cartoon Network, by Cartoon Network Studios, and was originally released on their website on May 18, 2015. In December 2017, it was announced that Netflix had acquired the rights to Twelve Forever for a full series, with production duties being handled by The Cartel and Puny Entertainment. Shadi Petosky began working on the show sometime before July 2017, when she hoped for more episodes of Danger & Eggs. One of the executive producers of the series, Petosky, described Reggie as a queer character \"coming to terms with her sexuality\". The series also features a number of other LGBTQ characters: Mack and Beefhouse, a couple in the fantasy world of Endless Island, and Galaxander, who previously had a boyfriend. Ultimately, the series ended after its first season with no further plans to continue it, as noted by Petosky in a tweet. As such, GLAAD recognized the series as one of those shows released in 2019 with LGBTQ representation. ==Premise== The series centers on Reggie Abbott (Kelsy Abbott), an imaginative 12-year-old whose desire to remain a child is so powerful she can enter another world in which she never has to grow up: an island called Endless where her childhood toys and drawings are real. She is joined by her friends Todd (Antony Del Rio) and Esther Hopkins (Jaylen Barron), who visit this amazing world to live out their superhero fantasies and escape the responsibilities of impending adulthood. Life and reality often catch up with them in Endless as the preteens start dealing with growing pains and conflicts develop between them. The negativity the friends experience while dealing with their new complicated problems feed their enemy, the nefarious Butt Witch (Matt Berry), who seeks to destroy Endless. ==Voice cast== * Kelsy Abbott as Reggie, Wade, Kathy, Flaps, Flowery Woman, Billy Canyon, Tammy, Dr. Tenders, Swimple Jan, Plates, Mike, Omelet, Winged Moyse * Antony Del Rio as Todd, Chairold, Garrett, Sherbert * Jaylen Barron as Esther, Pretty Please, Tater Tot, Gorbis, Darla, Tori * Matt Berry as The Butt Witch * Steve Agee as Big Deal, Mack, Beefhouse, Galaxander, Hunk, Monster Brown Roger * Wade Randolph as Borbo, Dr. Champion, Mr. Christopherson, Label Maker Monster, Lump, Uncle Paul, AJ, Bobby * Laura Zak as Mrs. Krandle, Tanopy, Explorer Sally, Pancake, Rooty, Lorbis, Queen Limerick * Bridget Everett as Judy * Spencer Rothbell as Colin, Swimple Dan, Tasty Troy, Pitui-Terry, Squad Bro, Rance, Big Ol' Gordon, Jacques Board, Shaun * Nick Sumida as Bags of Marbles, Beth, Chewing Gum Stanley, Garrett, Se\u00f1or Corduroy * Brandon Wardell as Dustin * Daniel Amerman as Aaron * Sam Brown as Manny, Schmaaron * Noel Fielding as Guy Pleasant * Kate Freund as Donna * John Eric Bentley as Mr. Kapusinski * Ron Funches as Manguin * Brittany Ashley as Kendra, Leslie * Amy Sedaris as Sadmantha * Maximus Riegel as Ogden * Stephanie Beatriz as Conelly * Chris Fleming as Mr. Fleming * Ashley Boettcher as Gwen * Curt Neill as Rodney * Paul Williams as Captain Elmer * Reese Hartwig as Shane (Pilot only) * Jorge Diaz as Tristan (Pilot only) ==Episodes== === Cartoon Network pilot (2015)=== === Season 1 (2019) === ==Reception== There have been a variety of reviews. Lacey Womack of ScreenRant praised the series while others praised the \"great pedigree\" of those working on the show. While some described the show as having a \"sense of its Midwest, small town setting as the backdrop of conformist pressure\" and compared it to Gravity Falls, and praised its LGBTQ representation, putting it alongside shows such as Steven Universe, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, The Dragon Prince, and OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes. At the same time, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction contributor Steven Pearce gave a short positive review of the show, arguing that the show juggles dark and light, the real world and the imagined world, with Endless acting out \"metaphorical versions of Reggie's real-world problems.\" Pearce also argued that the series is good and inventive, bringing in surrealism, \"pre-teen angst, humour and twelve year-olds using flame- throwers.\" In January 2020, GLAAD nominated the show for its Outstanding Kids & Family Programming award, along with a host of other shows. ==Controversy, cancellation, and possibility of a second season== In September 2019, a Tumblr post from 2010 by Julia Vickerman, the show's creator and executive producer, was revealed which seemed to talk about self-described pedophilia involving a 14-year-old boy, putting the show in jeopardy. The same month, Shadi Petosky announced that the show had been cancelled in a now-deleted tweet, but did not mention the controversy around Vickerman. While Petosky was described as the executive producer on the show in a July 2019 AP article on LGBTQ representation in animation, she stated in September 2019 that she had no connection with the show since the show's first season had premiered on Netflix earlier that year. The following year, in two articles published in April and May 2020, Lacey Womack of Screen Rant stated the show was \"on an indefinite hiatus,\" with uncertain plans for the future. ==References== ==External links== *Twelve Forever on Netflix * *Twelve Forever Official Website and Store Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:LGBT-related animated web series Category:Netflix children's programming Category:2010s American surreal comedy television series Category:Television series by Netflix Animation Category:Television series set in the 2000s Category:Television shows set in Iowa Category:Middle school television series Category:Animated television series about children Category:LGBT-related animated series ",
