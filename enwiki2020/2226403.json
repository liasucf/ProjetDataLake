    "text": "A man playing a gend\u00e8r A gend\u00e8r is a type of metallophone used in Balinese and Javanese gamelan music. It consists of 10 to 14 tuned metal bars suspended over a tuned resonator of bamboo or metal, which are tapped with a mallet made of wooden disks (Bali) or a padded wooden disk (Java). Each key is a note of a different pitch, often extending a little more than two octaves. There are five notes per octave, so in the seven-note p\u00e9log scale, some pitches are left out according to the pathet. Most gamelans include three gend\u00e8r, one for sl\u00e9ndro, one for pelog pathet nem and lima, and one for pelog pathet barang. The gend\u00e8r is similar to the Balinese gangsa, which also has an individual resonator under each key, and the saron, which, although trough-resonated, does have a set of tuned metal bars or keys. It is also similar to the Javanese slenthem, which is pitched lower and has fewer notes. In some types of gamelan, two gend\u00e8rs are used, both spanning approximately two and a half octaves, the gend\u00e8r barung and the gend\u00e8r panerus, pitched an octave higher than the other. In Gamelan Surakarta, the gend\u00e8r panerus plays a single line of melodic pattern, following a pattern similar to the siter. The gend\u00e8r barung plays a slower, but more complex melodic pattern that includes more separate right and left hand melodic lines that come together in kempyung (approximately a fifth) and gembyang (octave) intervals. The melodies of the two hands sometimes move in parallel motion, but often play contrapuntally. When playing gend\u00e8r barung with two mallets, the technique of dampening, important to most gamelan instruments, becomes more challenging, and the previously hit notes must be dampened by the same hand immediately after the new ones are hit. This is sometimes possible by playing with the mallet at an angle (to dampen one key and play the other), but may require a small pause. Both types of gend\u00e8r play semi-improvised patterns called cengkok, which generally elaborate upon the seleh. These are relatively fixed patterns, but can be varied in a number of ways to suit the style, pathet, irama, and mood of the piece, as well as the skill of the performer. The cengkok repertoire for gend\u00e8r are more developed and specific than those for most other elaborating instruments. Similarly, the gend\u00e8r barung is likely to give cues for changing parts or irama, especially in the absence of a rebab, which usually leads the ensemble. It may also play the buka of a piece. ==See also== * Gamelan * Bonang * Kethuk * Music of Java ==References== ==External links== *Video *Javanese Gend\u00e8r barung *Javanese Gend\u00e8r panerus, with audio Category:Panerusan instruments Category:Plaque percussion idiophones Category:Keyboard percussion ",
