    "text": "Lone cypress tree on the coast of Pebble Beach, California, May 2005 The Lone Cypress is a Monterey cypress tree in Pebble Beach, California. Standing on a granite hillside off the 17-Mile Drive, the tree is a Western icon, and has been called one of the most photographed trees in North America. It is located between Cypress Point Club and the Pebble Beach Golf Links, two of world's best-known golf courses. Possibly as old as 250 years, the cypress has been scarred by fire and has been held in place with cables for 65 years. The look of the tree changed significantly when it lost its leftmost branch during a storm in 2019. The Monterey cypress grows naturally only in Pebble Beach and Point Lobos. A drawing of the tree was registered as Pebble Beach Company's trademark in 1919. The company said the trademark protected not only the logo but also the tree itself. == Gallery == File:Lone Cypress, 17 Mile Drive.jpg|thumb|Postcard of Lone Cypress at Midway Point, 17 Mile Drive, by Edward H.
