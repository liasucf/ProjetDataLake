Philipus, his father and sister were part of the first colony of settlers in Pella from the Netherlands in 1847. with He went into farming and when he retired to this house, he owned five farms. His two-story brick house is a transitional structure. It combines the Dutch construction techniques of the early settlers with American architectural design. The later is found the house's basic I-house design, and the Renaissance Revival detailing. The former is found in the use of beam anchors and the floor system where the flooring rests on top of the floor joists without a subfloor between them. The original stoop porch with its saw-tooth railing was replaced around 1905 with a sitting porch that covered the three center bays and had a railing that encircled the second floor porch. It was removed in 2001. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1877 Category:I-houses in Iowa Category:Pella, Iowa Category:Houses in Marion County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marion County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Dutch-American culture in Iowa ",
