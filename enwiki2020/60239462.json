The state legislature chose 10 electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Tennessee voted for incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln. The state (along with Louisiana) both chose electors for the election after being captured early in the American Civil War. However, due to issues related to the Civil War, their votes were rejected. ==Footnotes== ==References== Tennessee 1864 Category:1864 Tennessee elections ",
