    "text": "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life is the second book by blogger and author Mark Manson. In it Manson argues that life's struggles give it meaning, and that the mindless positivity of typical self-help books is neither practical nor helpful. It was a bestseller. ==Publication history== The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck was published under the imprint of HarperOne, a division of HarperCollins Publishers, and was released on September 13, 2016. As of May 2019, over 8 million copies of the book had been sold. ==Contents== The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that isn't practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas. The book has nine chapters with the following titles: 1\\. Don't Try. 2\\. Happiness is a problem. 3\\. You are not special. 4\\. The value of suffering. 5\\. You are always choosing. 6\\. You are wrong about everything (But so am I). 7\\. Failure is the way forward. 8\\. The importance of saying no. 9\\. And then you die. ==Reception== The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck first appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List at #6 for the category of How-to and Miscellaneous for the week of October 2, 2016. It reached #1 for the first time on July 16th, 2017. As of the end of May 2020, the book has spent 179 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list . The book also appeared on the Washington Post Bestseller List at #9 in the Non- fiction/General category for the week of September 25, 2016, and on the Toronto Star List at #1 in the Self-Improvement category on September 23, 2016. In 2017, it was the best-selling nonfiction book from Barnes & Noble, the #4 best-selling book on all of Amazon.com, and the #9 best-selling book in Canada. Kirkus Reviews said that the book was \"[a] good yardstick by which self-improvement books should be measured.\" The book was noted as a prominent instance of an industry wide trend of swear words in book titles during the 2010's. == References == ==External links== * Mark Manson \u2013 Official Website Category:Self-help book stubs Category:Self-help books Category:2016 non- fiction books Category:English-language books Category:HarperOne books ",
