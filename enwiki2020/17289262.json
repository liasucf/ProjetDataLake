It was magical. I had been giving so much emotional energy to gambling that only half of myself was out there writing. Gambling was a time suck, an energy suck, a creativity suck. I started going to GA meetings every Thursday night, and the writing flourished. It had so much more energy and passion.\" He lost up to $30,000 to his gambling addiction in a single weekend and he was eventually left with $150,000 in credit-card debt. Loeb is a keen follower of rock band Grateful Dead, which he compares to the film industry in its fanbase. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Title !! Writer !! Producer !!
