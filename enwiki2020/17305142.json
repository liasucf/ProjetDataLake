The museum was established in 1934, and reopened in 1964 in its current premises. The museum as it stands today was built by the architects D. Fatouros and G. Triantaphyllides, professors of the Polytechnic School and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki between 1963 and 1964. The museum has been referred to as the most important archaeological museum in Eastern Macedonia and one of the most important museums in Greece. The museum contains prehistoric artifacts found all over the Kavala regional unit such as in Neapolis (old Kavala), Amphipolis and places such as Oisyme, Galypsos, Dikili Tas, Tragilos, Mesembria, Nikisiani and Avdira. ==Interior== Amphipolis, the site that many of the museum exhibits were found On the ground floor of the museum are artifacts from ancient Amphipolis including a marble bust of a woman (4th century BC), a marble grave stela of an ephebe (5th century BC), a large gold finger ring and a gold olive wreath that were found in Macedonian Tomb 1 (3rd century BC), a headless marble statue of a woman wearing a peplos (1st century BC), and a portrait bust of the Roman empress Agrippina.
