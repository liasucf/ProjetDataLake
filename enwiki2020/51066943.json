    "text": "The Cathedral Basilica Minor of Our Lady of Light (),Catedral Metropolitana Bas\u00edlica Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais also called Curitiba Cathedral, is a Catholic church in the city of Curitiba, in the state of Parana in Brazil. In 1668, a small wooden church was built on the site, in the old town of Curitiba today, with a church dedicated to Our Lady of Light and Jesus. In 1693, the City Council was established in the place in order to elect the first municipal authorities. On March 29 of the same year, the foundation of the town of Nossa Senhora da Luz e do Bom Jesus dos Pinhais Curitiba became official. Years later, this little building gave way to a larger church in stone and clay, completed in 1721, called the church headquarters. This, in turn, was demolished between 1875 and 1880, to finally build the present cathedral, whose work was carried out between 1876 and 1893. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Brazil *Our Lady of Light (disambiguation) Internal view ==References== Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Paran\u00e1 (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Curitiba Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1893 Category:Basilica churches in Brazil ",
