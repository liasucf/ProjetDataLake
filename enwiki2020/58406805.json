    "text": "Christoffel Coetzee de Villiers (1850\u20131887), born in Beaufort West as the fourth son of a wagon-maker, and married in Wellington where he then settled, spent his last years as a printer's clerk in Cape Town. His passion for researching his own family's history eventually grew into his compilation of Geslachts-Registers der Oude Kaapsche Famili\u00ebn,C.C. de Villiers, Geslachts- register der Oude Kaapsche Familien (red. G. McC. Theal), three volumes, Van de Sandt de Villiers, Cape Town, 1893\u20131904. a complete (in so far as it was possible) genealogy of colonists' descendants born at the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope during the Dutch period (1652\u20131806). He died of pneumonia with his life's work uncompleted and leaving his family in penury, having expended all his resources on his research. On his death-bed, he extracted a promise from his friend and mentor, the historian George McCall Theal, to finish the work and have it published. == Oude Kaapsche Famili\u00ebn == The publication, financed by the Cape Government at Theal's insistence, had to wait until a few years after Theal's appointment (in 1891) as Colonial Historian. Only the first volume was sponsored, though: publication of the two others was conditional on sales of the first recovering its production cost. The public's reception was overwhelming and the three volumes are now collector's items. They set a standard of scholarship, aspired to but rarely equalled by later genealogists, and remain a standard reference work well over a century later.Oude Kaapsche Famili\u00ebn is available as e-books: Vol.1, Vol.2, Vol.3 == References == Category:1850 births Category:1887 deaths Category:People from Beaufort West Category:South African genealogists Category:19th-century South African writers ",
