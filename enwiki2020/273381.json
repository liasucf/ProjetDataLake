    "text": "A violent crime, violent felony, crime of violence or crime of a violent nature is a crime in which an offender or perpetrator uses or threatens to use force upon a victim. This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective, such as murder or rape, as well as crimes in which violence is used as a form coercion. Violent crimes may, or may not, be committed with weapons. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may vary from homicide to harassment. Typically, violent criminals includes aircraft hijackers, bank robbers, muggers, burglars, terrorists, carjackers, rapists, kidnappers, torturers, active shooters, murderers, gangsters, drug cartels, and others. ==Violent crime by country== The comparison of violent crime statistics between countries is usually problematic, due to the way different countries classify crime.Segessenmann, Tanya Section 2 - International Comparisons of Recorded Violent Crime Rates for 2000, Research & Evaluation Unit, Ministry of Justice, Wellington, New Zealand. 11 June 2002 Retrieved 23 June 2007. Valid comparisons require that similar offences between jurisdictions be compared. Often this is not possible, because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may include: homicide, murder, assault, manslaughter, sexual assault, rape, robbery, negligence, endangerment, kidnapping (abduction), extortion, and harassment. Different countries also have different systems of recording and reporting crimes. ===Australia=== The first annual national survey of crime victimization in Australia, the Crime Victimisation Survey, was conducted in 2008-09. Personal crimes included in the survey are: *Physical assault *Threatened assault (including face-to-face and non face-to-face) *Robbery (including attempted) *Sexual assault (including attempted) In 2009, the Australian Standard Offence Classification (ASOC), which had no single category for violent crime, was replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC). The ANZSOC also has no single category for violent crime, but the first 6 of its divisions involve offenses committed against a person: #Homicide and related offences; #Acts intended to cause injury; #Sexual assault and related offences; #Dangerous or negligent acts endangering persons; #Abduction, harassment and other offences against the person; #Robbery, extortion and related offences. ===Canada=== Canada conducts an annual measure of crime incidences called the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). UCR \"Violent Criminal Code\" violations include: homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, assault, robbery, criminal harassment, uttering threats, and other violent violations. Canada also collects information on crime victimization every five years via its General Social Survey on Victimisation (GSS). Among the eight GSS crimes tracked are three violent crimes: sexual assault, robbery, and physical assault. ===New Zealand=== New Zealand's crime statisticsNew Zealand Recorded Crime Tables has a category for violence that includes homicides, kidnapping, abduction, robbery, assaults, intimidation, threats, and group assembly, while all sexual offences are shown in a separate category from violence. ===Europe=== Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, England, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece and Sweden count minor violence like slapping another person as assault.European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics \u2013 2010, fourth edition, p30. An example is the case of Ilias Kasidiaris in 2012. Kasidaris, then spokesperson for Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party, slapped a left-wing female opponent in the face during a live televised debate. He was subsequently wanted by Greek prosecutors for assault and faced an arrest warrant.Greek far-right Golden Dawn MP wanted for assault. BBC.co.uk. June 7, 2012. Retrieved November 15, 2013. France does not count minor violence like slapping somebody as assault. The United Kingdom includes all violence against the person, sexual offences, as violent crime. Today, violent crimes are considered the most heinous whereas historically, according to Simon Dedo, crimes against property were equally important. Rates of violent crime in the UK are recorded by the British Crime Survey. For the 2010/2011 report on crime in England and Wales, the statistics show that violent crime continues a general downward trend observed over the last few decades as shown in the graph. \"The 2010/11 BCS showed overall violence was down 47 per cent on the level seen at its peak in 1995; representing nearly two million fewer violent offences per year.\" In 2010/11, 31 people per 1,000 interviewed reported being a victim of violent crime in the 12 preceding months. Regarding murder, \"increasing levels of homicide (at around 2% to 3% per year) [have been observed] from the 1960s through to the end of the twentieth century\". Recently the murder rate has declined, \"a fall of 19 per cent in homicides since 2001/02\", as measured by The Homicide Index. ===United States=== Violent crime in the United States per the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). There are two main crime databases maintained by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ): the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report (UCR). Non-fatal violence is reported in the NCVS, which measures rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault reported by households surveyed by the U.S. Census Bureau. The UCR tracks similar non-fatal violence, plus murder and non-negligent manslaughter recorded by law enforcement. There are significant methodological and definitional differences between the NCVS and UCR: *The NCVS includes estimates of both reported and unreported crimes, while the UCR collects data on crimes recorded by the police. *The UCR includes homicide, arson, and commercial crimes, while the NCVS does not. *The UCR excludes simple assault (attacks or attempted attacks without a weapon resulting in either no injury or minor injury) and sexual assault, which are in the NCVS. *The NCVS data are estimates from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households, but the UCR data are based on the actual counts of offenses reported by law enforcement. *The NCVS excludes crimes against children under 12 years, persons in institutions, and, possibly, highly mobile populations and the homeless; however, victimizations against these persons may be included in the UCR. Since they use different methodologies and measure overlapping, but not identical, crimes, the data are complementary and not necessarily congruent. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Crime rates per 1000 population |- !

The overall rate rose from 22.6 victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2011 to 26.1 in 2012. Most of the increase was in simple assaults. From 1993 to 2012, overall violent victimization declined by two-thirds, from a rate of 79.8 per 1,000 to 26.1 per 1,000. In 2011, the UCR violent crime rate had dropped to 386.3 cases per 100,000 persons, compared to 729.6 per 100,000 in 1990. Using FBI data. U.S. homicide data is also available in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). ==References== ==Further reading== *Falk, \u00d6rjan, M\u00e4rta Wallinius, Sebastian Lundstr\u00f6m, et al. 2014. \"The 1 % of the population accountable for 63 % of all violent crime convictions.\" Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology 49(4): 559\u201371. . . . * * * * * * ==External links== *Centre for International Crime Provention (CICP) *Civitas: Crime *International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) *United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime *Ten Years of Protecting Children, FBI Crime, violent ",
