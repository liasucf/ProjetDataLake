Engineering was later separated off and merged with the College of Industrial and Technical Education to form the College of Engineering and Technology. The founding dean of the newly formed College of Physical and Mathematical Science in 1972 was Jae R. Ballif.Ernest L. Wilkenson and W.

It operates the BYU planetarium and the various telescopes connected with BYU's observatory. Besides astronomy the department has research groups in Acoustics; Atomic, Molecular and Optical studies; Condensed Matter; Plasma; and Theoretical and Mathematical physics.BYU Physics Department website The program also works closely with the David O.
