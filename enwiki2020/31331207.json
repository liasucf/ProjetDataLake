    "text": "Borko Stefanovi\u0107 (born 5 February 1974, born as Borislav Stefanovi\u0107) is a Serbian politician who was the leader of the Levica Srbije political party. Prior to founding Levica Srbije, he was active in the Democratic Party in Serbia, with whom he engaged in a high-profile split in the summer of 2015. He was one of Serbia's representatives during the Belgrade-Pristina negotiations.\"Belgrade, Pristina launch new talks\" setimes.com 9 March 2011 Link retrieved 10 March 2011 He was the Political Director of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and former Chief of Staff for Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremi\u0107. ==Early life== Stefanovi\u0107 was born in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, SFR Yugoslavia in 1974. He graduated from high school in Sremski Karlovci before enrolling in the University of Novi Sad Faculty of Law, where he graduated in 1999. Stefanovi\u0107 played bass guitar in a punk rock band called 'Generacija bez budu\u0107nosti' (Generation without a Future), which last performed in 2011. ==Political career== Stefanovi\u0107 first became politically involved in 1999, when he joined the Citizens' Alliance (known in Serbian as GSS, the acronym for Gra\u0111anski savez Srbije), an anti-nationalist party. He left the party in 2001, after which he had no party affiliation for two years. ===Democratic Party (2003-2015)=== After the assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107, Stefanovi\u0107 joined the Democratic Party in Serbia. In an interview with Novi Plamen, Stefanovi\u0107 referred to \u0110in\u0111i\u0107's assassination when discussing on his entry into the Democratic Party, describing it as \"my personal response to an uncivilized act.\" In 2008, Stefanovi\u0107 was the chief negotiator of the sale of Naftna Industrija Srbije to Gazprom Neft. The sale did not involve a public tender, since other enterprises were not offered a chance to bid. The conditions to which Stefanovi\u0107 negotiated were criticized in the local media, as the price at which NIS was sold at approximately one fifth of its market value at the time. One of the most influential conditions of the sale was that the South Stream would run through Serbia, even though for Gazprom there was greater logistical convenience to bypass Serbia. The South Stream project was cancelled after the annexation of Crimea by Russia, which resulted in sanctions on Russian politicians and enterprises. In 2014, the Serbian government began an investigation on the privatization of NIS. In December 2010, Stefanovi\u0107 was appointed by president Boris Tadi\u0107 as Serbia's representative for the Belgrade-Pristina negotiations. In July 2011, Blic reported that Serbia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vuk Jeremi\u0107 attempted to replace Stefanovi\u0107 in his position in the Belgrade-Pristina talks. Jeremi\u0107 sought to completely remove the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of having any participation in the talks, allegedly saying that his Ministry and the negotiations \"have contradicting goals\". However, according to Blic's sources, Boris Tadi\u0107 did not approve Jeremi\u0107's removal of Stefanovi\u0107 from Serbia's negotiation team on Kosovo. On top of the allegations of Jeremi\u0107's attempt to remove Stefanovi\u0107 from the Kosovo talks, Stefanovi\u0107 was Jeremi\u0107's best man at his wedding. In September 2011, Jeremi\u0107 replaced Stefanovi\u0107 as chief of staff of the MSP with Serbia's former ambassador to Slovakia, Danko Proki\u0107. ====Split from the Democratic Party==== From 2015, Stefanovi\u0107 became engaged in a political rift with the Democratic Party. In a manifesto outlining several long-term goals, Stefanovi\u0107 argued for the creation of a \"Confederation of the West Balkans\", which would unite Serbia with other states in the Balkans, after which foreign debts of the united countries would be frozen for five years. He added, \"I am not for any nationalization and I am for integration into the European Union, but I sympathetically see some parts of the program of the Greek Syriza.\" Stefanovi\u0107 argued against austerity, and was especially critical of pension and salary reductions for middle class citizens. He said that \"the Democratic Party must make a drastic departure from our people who led wrongful policies, which like the current government were crazy about neoliberalism, but essentially were only moved to their personal gains.\" On December 10, 2015, Stefanovi\u0107 resigned from the Democratic Party. He said that the \"last straw\" was when the Democratic Party nominated Bojan Dimitrijevi\u0107, who sought the rehabilitation of Milan Nedi\u0107, as a candidate in a local election in \u010cukarica. ===Levica Srbije (Serbian Left)=== Later in December 2015, Stefanovi\u0107 founded his own party, Levica Srbije (Serbian Left). While founding the new party, he initially collaborated with Jovo Baki\u0107, who wrote most of the party's original ideological profile. However, Baki\u0107 quickly left the project after disagreements with Stefanovi\u0107 on the party's strategy and politics. Vladimir Unkovski-Korica, a political science professor at the University of Glasgow, commented on the Baki\u0107- Stefanovi\u0107 split, claiming that \"Borko Stefanovi\u0107 wants a party more like the Democratic Party in the United States, rather than like one of the leftist parties in Europe.\" In the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election, Levica Srbije recorded their debut election with 0.95% of the vote. On November 23, 2018, Stefanovi\u0107 was injured from a physical assault while talking to an audience in Kru\u0161evac. He blamed the assault on incumbent president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, who Stefanovi\u0107 accused of creating a \"gruesome atmosphere\" for opposition politicians. ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Novi Sad Category:Serbian diplomats Category:University of Novi Sad alumni Category:Democratic Party (Serbia) politicians Category:Party of Freedom and Justice politicians Category:Kosovo\u2013Serbia relations Category:Members of the National Assembly of Serbia ",
