Together with James Haglund, Kurt Luoto and Sarah Mason, she introduced the quasisymmetric Schur functions, which form a basis for quasisymmetric functions. van Willigenburg earned her Ph.D. in 1997 at the University of St. Andrews under the joint supervision of Edmund F. Robertson and Michael D. Atkinson, with a thesis titled The Descent Algebras of Coxeter Groups. She was awarded the Krieger\u2013Nelson Prize in 2017 by the Canadian Mathematical Society. ==Selected publications== == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of British Columbia faculty Category:Canadian women mathematicians Category:20th- century Canadian mathematicians Category:21st-century Canadian mathematicians Category:Combinatorialists Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
