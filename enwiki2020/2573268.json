    "text": "Rubidium nitrate is an inorganic compound with the formula RbNO3. This alkali metal nitrate salt is white and highly soluble in water. ==Properties== Solubility of rubidium nitrate in water Rubidium nitrate is a white crystalline powder that is highly soluble in water and very slightly soluble in acetone. In a flame test, RbNO3 gives a mauve/light purple colour. ==Uses== Rubidium compounds have very few applications. Like caesium nitrate, it is used in infrared radiation producing pyrotechnic compositions as a colorant and an oxidizer, e.g. in decoys and illumination flares. It is also used as a raw material for preparation of other rubidium compounds and rubidium metal, for manufacture of catalysts and in scintillation counters. It is rarely used in fireworks to produce a red-violet colour. ==Production== RbNO3 can be prepared either by dissolving rubidium metal, its hydroxide or carbonate in nitric acid. :RbOH + HNO3 \u2192 RbNO3 \\+ H2O :2 Rb + 2 HNO3 \u2192 2 RbNO3 \\+ H2 ==References== Category:Rubidium compounds Category:Nitrates Category:Pyrotechnic oxidizers Category:Pyrotechnic colorants ",
