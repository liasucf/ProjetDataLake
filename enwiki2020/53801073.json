Marshall Islands maintains an Honorary Consulate in New Delhi. == History == INS Satpura arrives in Majuro (August 2016) The Indian Navy personnel of the INS Satpura visits Majuro (August 2016) Diplomatic relations between India and the Marshall Islands were established in April 1995. India was among the first countries to establish diplomatic ties with the Marshall Islands. The country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, of which India is an official dialogue partner. Bilateral relations received a boost following the initiation of the Forum for India\u2013Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) by the Narendra Modi government in 2014. A Marshallese delegation including Foreign Minister Tony deBrum attended the first India-Forum for Pacific Island Countries (FIPIC) Summit hosted in Suva, Fiji on 19 November 2014 by Prime Minister Modi. Marshall Islands voted for India's candidature for a Non- Permanent Seat on the UN Security Council for the year 2011\u201312, and also supported the G-4's resolution of reforming the UN Security Council. ==High level visits== Speaker of the Parliament Kessai Note and a parliamentary delegation visited India in the late 1990s. Then Ambassador of India to the Marshall Islands (resident in Manila) Amit Dasgupta led an Indian delegation to attend the Post Forum Dialogue Meetings Forum held in Majuro in September 2013. Dasgupta also held talks with the Marshallese Foreign Minister and Speaker of Parliament. Minister of Internal Affairs Wilbur Heine visited New Delhi in October 2013 to attend the South-South Cooperation for Child Rights in Asia and the Pacific, organised by the Indian Ministry of Women and Child Development. Minister for Public Works Hiroshi Yamamura and Tobolar Copra Processing Authority of RMI CEO Jemi Nashion visited Kochi in February 2015 to participate in the 51st Asia Pacific Coconut Community Session/Ministerial Meeting. President Christopher Loeak led a Marshallese delegation to attend the 2nd FIPIC Summit held in Jaipur on 21 August 2015. At the summit, Loeak spoke about the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference and praised India's role in combating climate change. Loeak said, \"No country is more central to success in Paris than India. With its booming economy, its technological ingenuity and its big appetite for clean energy, the world\u2019s biggest democracy is well poised for strong and visible leadership on climate change. Thankfully, there are few clean energy crusaders like Prime Minister Modi.\" He also held bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Modi on the sidelines of the summit. Loeak was the first Marshallese head of state to visit India. Speaker Kessai Note, who had visited India over a decade earlier, would go on to become the first commoner (rather than a traditional chief) to be elected to the Presidency after the visit. ==Military relations== INS Satpura visited Majuro on 13\u201315 August 2016 after participating in RIMPAC-16, and was the first Indian Navy ship to visit the country. The crew of the ship met with Marshallese police forces, and senior Government and military authorities, and also held sporting and cultural interactions. == Nuclear weapons case == On 24 April 2014, Marshall Islands filed cases against India, and eight other nations who have declared or are believed to possess nuclear weapons, at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that the countries had not fulfilled \"their obligations with respect to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\". The Government of the Marshall Islands alleged that the countries were in breach of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT). However, India has not signed the NPT. The Marshall Islands aimed to urge nations to resume negotiations to eradicate their nuclear weapons stockpiles. Six of the nine nations did not respond to the suit and the cases against them did not proceed. Only India, Pakistan and the United Kingdom accepted the authority of the ICJ, and responded to the suit arguing that the cases against them should be dismissed as the ICJ did not have the jurisdiction over the matter. The 16 judge ICJ bench that heard the case accepted India's argument and delivered its verdict with nine votes in favour and seven against. The case against India was dismissed on 5 October 2016; ICJ presiding judge Ronny Abraham ruled, \"The court upholds the objection to jurisdiction raised by India. Therefore the tribunal cannot proceed to the merits of the case.\" This was the first case involving in India at the ICJ, since a 1999 case filed by Pakistan alleging that one of its naval aircraft had been shot down by the Indian Air Force. Like the Marshall Islands case, India had successfully argued that the Pakistan case should be dismissed as the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the matter. This was also the first case regarding nuclear weapons heard by the ICJ since it issued an advisory opinion on the subject in 1996. ==Trade== Bilateral trade between India and the Marshall Islands is constrained by the large distance between the two countries and the small size of the Marshallese economy. Trade between the two countries totaled US$ 102.32 million in 2015\u201316, rising sharply from $130,000 the previous fiscal.

India announced that it would provide a grant-in-aid of US$ 100,000 annually to each of the 14 Pacific Island countries, including the Marshall Islands, at the Post Forum Dialogue partner meeting in 2006.
