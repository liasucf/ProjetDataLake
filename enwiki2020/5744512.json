Founded in 1982 by British ad men John Bartle, Nigel Bogle, and John Hegarty, BBH has offices in London, New York City, Singapore, Shanghai, Mumbai, Stockholm and Los Angeles and employs more than 1,000 staff worldwide. The company is part of international agency group Publicis.

It became the agency icon and spawned the phrase, \"when the world zigs, zag\". The Levi's black sheep poster was not an easy ad to buy because at the time all jeans ads had people in them, but it proved successful. Over the next 28 years, BBH went on to produce many award-winning films for Levi's. \"Launderette\" featured Nick Kamen and was set to Marvin Gaye's recording of 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'. Levi's sold over 2 million boxer shorts in one year. In 1991, BBH cast the then-unknown Brad Pitt in the Levi's commercial titled \"Camera.\" Other classic work includes \"Drugstore\", \"Creek\", \"Flatbeat\" featuring Flat Eric \u2013 a small yellow puppet, \"Clayman\" and \"Odyssey\" which was directed by Jonathan Glazer. The 28-year relationship resulted in a total of seven number one singles in Europe. Beyond Levi's, the company been responsible for creating long-running campaigns for other global brands, such as ' for Audi which John Hegarty coined in 1984, \"The Lynx Effect\" for Unilever which propelled the male body spray into the number one spot globally and \"Keep Walking\" for Johnnie Walker which bought the brand sales up from 13% of the global market when the campaign broke in 2000, to over 20% at the end of 2013 according to IWSR. In 1997, Leo Burnett Worldwide purchased a 49% share in BBH; that share was then held by the Publicis advertising group.Patel, Kunur.

In early September, BBH announced that it had withdrawn from its SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract, first entered into in 1999. BBH had contended that the union's contractual terms, which do not permit the use of non-union actors and provide for compensation minimums and residuals, put the agency at a competitive disadvantage, stating that \"Many of our peer agencies are not signatories.\" SAG-AFTRA countered that it had added certain waivers for low-budget commercials, among other provisions, to its contract language, in response to concerns about profitability. The union also said that the strike was against BBH only, and not other subsidiaries of the Publicis Group, including Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, who are themselves signatories of the contract at issue. ==Awards== BBH has won the Queen's Award for Export twice.
