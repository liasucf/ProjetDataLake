    "text": "\"Dark Reign\" is a 2008\u201309 comic book branding used by Marvel Comics. It deals with the aftermath of the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, which led to a shift of power in the Marvel Universe toward Norman Osborn. The title \"Dark Reign\" refers to Osborn's rise to national power and the ramifications thereof. Joe Quesada, then-editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, stated that \"Dark Reign is not really an event, it's what's happening in the Marvel Universe.\" He believes that \"Dark Reign leads to an interesting place in the Marvel Universe. I think you'll see a pulling back at the end of Dark Reign, but you'll understand at the end of it what we were trying to get to.\" ==Publication history== The Dark Reign story-line began with the release of the Secret Invasion: Dark Reign one-shot, written by Brian Michael Bendis and with art by Alex Maleev, in December 2008. It then continued in a number of standalone mini-series and some individual issues of ongoing Marvel Comics titles throughout 2009. Selected ongoing Marvel titles were temporarily renamed to highlight their involvement in the event. Initial promotional images for the story-line included a series of \"We Lost, They Won\" images showing a severed robotic head of Iron Man, Emma Frost holding Cyclops's blood-covered visor, the new Captain America bowing to Norman Osborn's Iron Patriot form, Daken's Wolverine form looking down, Thor motionless on Loki's female form, Venom's Spider-Man appearance defeating Spider-Man, Henry Pym's Wasp alias (with Wasp's picture in the background), and the Green Goblin (which quotes that \"He won\"). There is no core limited series as there was in the preceding \"Secret Invasion\" event. Instead, the story-line is made up of one-shots that help fill in the gaps, limited series exploring the effect of the event on teams and individuals, as well as tie-ins with other ongoing series. The main story-line led into the 2010 \"Siege\" crossover event, although some plot elements are ongoing. ==Plot== Following the Skrull invasion of Earth during \"Secret Invasion\", Norman Osborn leveraged his success in defeating the Skrulls to replace Tony Stark as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Deadpool played a large part in this, as he was supposed to send the information on how to kill the Skrull Queen Veranke to Nick Fury. An error occurred during the process and the information went to Osborn, suggesting subterfuge on Osborn's part. Osborn shot Veranke in the head and became the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., which he replaced with H.A.M.M.E.R. Osborn simultaneously formed an alliance called the Cabal with Doctor Doom, Emma Frost, Namor, Loki, and the Hood. He used H.A.M.M.E.R. to carry out his own agenda and, at times, the Cabal's. However, Osborn's actions and his reputation influenced a number of heroes and villains to attempt to resist Osborn's rule and remove him from power by force, if necessary. ==Main characters== * Norman Osborn is the former Green Goblin and central focus of \"Dark Reign\". He is featured in most of the ongoing series and mini-series linked to the \"Dark Reign\" story-line. Brian Bendis notes that \"people know he's a bastard, but ignore it as long he gives them safety.\"Wizard Magazine #210 (April 2009) The character is shown as willing to destroy anything that would threaten his new status as public hero. Writer Matt Fraction has commented that as the Iron Patriot, he is a \"showman in armor\". Osborn keeps the more volatile members of the Cabal in line with a \"secret weapon\" which is revealed to be the Void.Wizard Magazine #212 (June 2009) Across multiple titles, the character is shown to have retained his mental instability from his days as the Goblin.Secret Invasion: Dark Reign (February 2009)The Mighty Avengers #24 (June 2009)Thunderbolts #131 (June 2009) * The Hood is featured heavily during the \"Dark Reign\" story-line in both New Avengers and Punisher. In the first, writer Brian Bendis explored the character's relationship with Dormammu and his quest to become the new Sorcerer Supreme. Rick Remender, writer of Punisher, focused more on his activities as a gangster and criminal. During the event, the character also features in the Dark Reign: The Hood mini-series, written by Jeff Parker, and has a major role in Marvel Zombies 4. Writer Fred Van Lente explains that, \"The Hood, of course, may not be acting of his own volition, since he has an unholy alliance with the Dread Dormammu, who may want the zombies and the virus that creates them for his own nefarious purposes. Plus, the Hood doesn't just bring any group of villains with him on this jaunt. He brings a very horror-oriented group of villains with him.\" This group is the Night Shift. * Doctor Doom hopes to use the Cabal to conquer the world and, aided by his ally Namor, seize power when Osborn implodes, preferring to consider the Cabal as an association rather than as partners. A short story written by Jonathan HickmanDark Reign: The Cabal (June 2009) reveals that he plans to kill or enslave all of his current Cabal allies in the near future. Doom is shown almost killing the Black Panther when the latter rejects a chair in the Cabal.Black Panther (vol. 5) #2 (May 2009) Doom also uses Latveria to house the Asgardians as part of an agreement with Loki, which allowed them to get rid of Thor, who had been exiled from Asgard at the time. However, Doom has made it clear that he trusts neither LokiThor #603 (November 2009) nor Namor,Dark Reign: Made Men (digital comics) #1 (April 2009) but merely finds them useful for his own designs. In Siege: The Cabal, Doom leaves the Cabal after one of his Doombot duplicates he sent in his place is attacked by Osborn's secret weapon. * Loki is often written as a great manipulator. He uses Osborn's help to make Thor kill Bor (Odin's father), and cause Thor's banishment.Thor #600 (April 2009) Then, with Doom's help, Loki realizes his plan of taking the throne of Asgard. However, during Chthon's attack on Earth, Loki, disguised as the Scarlet Witch, gathers a new Mighty Avengers team, which defeats the evil god.The Mighty Avengers #21\u201323 (March \u2013 May 2009) Loki has since subtly manipulated them to endanger Osborn's mental state and quicken his fall. * Namor has possibly the smallest role in the Cabal, appearing mostly in titles written by Matt Fraction. Fraction shows him as a warrior with great pride, and builds a sexual relationship between him and Emma Frost. Namor becomes one of the leaders of the Dark X-Men, as shown in Fraction's Uncanny X-Men as well as their own \"Dark Reign\" tie-in series. Namor was written as a loyal member of the Cabal until \"Utopia\", where he and Emma Frost betrayed Osborn and helped the X-Men create their own island. * Emma Frost wants the mutant community to have a position of power in Osborn's new world order. Matt Fraction has written a number of stories which indicate her relationship with Cyclops has suffered because of secrets they keep from each other. Frost and Namor become the leaders of the Dark X-Men. She helps lead the Dark X-Men until the regular X-Men are captured. She and Namor turn against Osborn and help establish the Utopia island. During a battle with the Dark Avengers, Frost uses her telepathy to defeat the Sentry by taking part of the Void into herself and frightening him away. Until recently, she had to remain in her diamond form in order to keep the Void trapped. * Ms. Victoria Hand was a former S.H.I.E.L.D. Business Affairs Operative. She is now Osborn's Deputy Director of H.A.M.M.E.R. Osborn has given her a list of jobs for building \"a new world peacekeeping task force from scratch,\" including, but not limited to: creating an acronym for H.A.M.M.E.R., writing a full report on the Fifty State Initiative, and stripping down and rebuilding Camp Hammond. Osborn calls her \"my eyes and ears and mouth,\" and names her his second-in- command over his team of Avengers. She is sent by Osborn himself to take on Bruce Banner and his son, Skaar, where she shows great battle skills. ==One- shots== There are a number of one-shots which helped the transition from \"Secret Invasion\" and filled in other details behind the main story-line. ===Dark Reign: Files=== ===Dark Reign: The Cabal=== Written by Rick Remender, Jonathan Hickman, Matt Fraction, Kieron Gillen, and Peter Milligan, this one- shot features five vignettes that provide further information about the motivations of the members of the Cabal.

It sees Punisher as he wants to kill Norman Osborn once and for all but Goblin sends his cabal member Hood against Punisher. Punisher then went against Hood's gang but little did he know that he would have date with the dead one's also. ===Secret Warriors=== This series, co-plotted by Brian Bendis with Jonathan Hickman writing, was launched as part of the \"Dark Reign\" story- line. Following their introduction in the \"Secret Invasion\" tie-in issues of The Mighty Avengers, Fury and the Secret Warriors discover that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been controlled by HYDRA since its creation, and set out to defeat both HYDRA and Norman Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R. ===Spider Woman=== Feeling like the most screwed over person on Earth due to Veranke's actions, Jessica is approached to join S.W.O.R.D. by Abigail Brand, which she accepts.

After run-ins with HYDRA, another Skrull, and the new Thunderbolts, Jessica eventually finds a wayward Skrull and she takes it down with the help of her teammates in the New Avengers. After the mission is over, Brand offers her different, new opportunities within S.W.O.R.D ===S.W.O.R.D=== Henry Peter Gyrich is being assigned as S.W.O.R.D. co-commander alongside Abigail Brand.

He manages to take several notable aliens into custody including Noh-Varr, Adam X, Beta Ray Bill, Jazinda, Karolina Dean, and Hepzibah. ===Vengeance of Moon Knight=== Moon Knight returns to New York after faking his death with Jake Lockley as his dominant personality, but still struggles against his violent nature and is hounded by Khonshu in the form of a small imaginary tormentor resembling a man in the Moon Knight costume with a bird skull who goads him to kill. ===War Machine=== ===The Amazing Spider-Man=== The Amazing Spider-Man #595\u2013599 ===Avengers The Initiative=== ===Captain America=== ===Captain Britain and MI 13=== ===Dark Wolverine=== ===Deadpool and the Thunderbolts=== During \"Secret Invasion\", Osborn steals information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls.Deadpool (vol. 2) #3 (December 2008) The story \"How Low Can You Go?\"Deadpool (vol. 2) #6\u20137 (March \u2013 April 2009) deals with the fallout from that, as writer Daniel Way explains: \"The first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things.\" The story also sees the return of Bob, Agent of HYDRA. \"I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends', so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this story-line together that moment presented itself.\" This all leads directly to a confrontation with the new Thunderbolts team (now composed of black ops mercenaries) in \"Magnum Opus\", which crosses over between Deadpool (vol. 2) #8\u20139 and Thunderbolts #130\u2013131. According to Thunderbolts writer Andy Diggle, \"It's a natural progression for Deadpool to go after Norman, and for Norman to send his personal hit-squad after Deadpool.\" In Deadpool (vol. 2) #10, Osborn discovers that the Thunderbolts failed to kill Deadpool, so he sends Bullseye, posing as Hawkeye, to kill him. However, Bullseye also fails twice, and then pays Deadpool the money Osborn owed so his life would be spared.
