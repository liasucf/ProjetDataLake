It is composed of 14 members selected from various standards boards and for their technical and scientific expertise related to voting systems and equipment. NIST chairs and manages the TGDC, provides technical guidance in areas such as encryption, usability engineering and testing, and performs work to improve testing and conformity assessment programs for voting systems. As part of its development of new voting standards, NIST consults with TGDC subcommittees and holds regular subcommittee teleconferences and periodic TGDC meetings. Teleconference audio archives, TGDC meetings, and TGDC meetings and presentations and related NIST work material are open to the public. The public may also view and submit comments and position statements to the TGDC.Technical Guidelines Development Committee Home Page == Charter == The Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) assists EAC in developing the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.

NIST has coordinated with the TGDC to host a number of public meetings, in which NIST technical staff presented results of analysis and recommendations for voluntary voting systems guidelines. This work culminated in the production of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines Version 1 (VVSG Version 1), delivered to the EAC on May 9, 2005. NIST is now consulting with the TGDC to develop the second version of the VVSG. TGDC meetings are open to the public, and the public is invited to send public comments to the TGDC. == References == == External links == *Technical Guidelines Development Committee - provided by NIST *Technical Guidelines Development Committee - provided by EAC Category:United States Department of Commerce Category:National Institute of Standards and Technology Category:Electronic voting ",
