    "text": "DamEttan (called Division 1, 2007\u20132015) is the second-highest women's ice hockey league in Sweden, below the SDHL and above Damtv\u00e5an. Beginning with the first official women's ice hockey Swedish Championship in 1988, the league served as the highest division for women's ice hockey and the winner of its playoffs was named Swedish Champion. During the 2007\u201308 season, the best Division 1 teams qualified for a newly created premier league, the Riksserien (renamed SDHL in 2016), which made Division 1 the second-tier league. The league is split into four geographical divisions: DamEttan S\u00f6dra (South), DamEttan Norra (North), DamEttan \u00d6stra (East), and DamEttan V\u00e4stra (West). The DamEttan play-offs feature the top teams from each division, competing against each other for a chance to gain promotion to the SDHL. == Current clubs (2019-20) == === DamEttan S\u00f6dra === * IF Malm\u00f6 Redhawks * Karlskrona HK * IF Troja/Ljungby * Link\u00f6ping HC Dam (2nd team) * Trollh\u00e4ttans HC * Hvidovre IK Source: === DamEttan Norra === * Skellefte\u00e5 AIK * MODO Hockey * IF Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven * Lule\u00e5 HF Source: === DamEttan \u00d6stra === *AIK *Almtuna IS *Hammarby IF * Haninge Anchors HC * Kallh\u00e4lls IF *SDE HF *S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje SK *Tullinge TP HC Source: === DamEttan V\u00e4stra === *F\u00e4rjestad BK *Leksands IF (2nd team) * Sandvikens IK *SHK Hockey Club *H\u00e4llefors/Filipstad *V\u00e4ster\u00e5s IK Source: == References == == External Links == * League statistics and data from the Swedish Ice Hockey Association\u2019s stats site Sweden Category:Ice hockey leagues in Sweden Category:Women's ice hockey competitions in Sweden Category:2007 establishments in Sweden Category:Sports leagues established in 2007 Category:Women's sports leagues in Sweden Category:Professional sports leagues in Sweden ",
