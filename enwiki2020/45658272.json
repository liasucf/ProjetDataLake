    "text": "\"Jet Boy\" is the closing track and second 7\" single from the New York Dolls' self titled debut album. It was written by Dolls lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Johnny Thunders. The lyrics are simply about a jet boy who stole his baby. There is little explanation as to what a jet boy is other than to say that he flies around New York City. Tony Glover of Rolling Stone described the song as \"Marvel Comics meets the Lower East Side.\" The New York Dolls famously performed \"Jet Boy\" on The Old Grey Whistle Test on 27 November 1973. After their performance, \"Whispering\" Bob Harris, host of the program, laughingly referred to the performance as \"Mock rock.\" The original B-side to \"Jet Boy\" was the love song \"Vietnamese Baby,\" written by David Johansen. According to journalist Steve Taylor, \"Vietnamese Baby\" dealt with the impact of the Vietnam War at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun was undermined by thoughts of collective guilt. (Sample lyrics: \"Catch me your slaves, shot at/Every riffle on the way and I gotta/Show you more mustard gas than any girl ever seen/Since I been blasted, I've been blown, I've been backing away/You've got to back it away/You've got to take a search of values/Yeah, But I've got a concert out to play\") Album producer Todd Rundgren played synthesizers on the track. \"Jet Boy\" b/w \"Babylon\" and \"Who Are the Mystery Girls\" (both from Too Much Too Soon) were released by Mercury Records in the UK in 1977. == References == ==External links== * *New York Dolls * Category:1973 singles Category:New York Dolls songs Category:Songs written by Johnny Thunders Category:1973 songs Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Songs written by David Johansen ",
