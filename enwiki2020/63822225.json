Financial Time Review, December 29, 2016, accessed May 1, 2020 In JazzTimes, Philip Booth noted \"A Place in Time, suggests that the group\u2019s penchant for fruitful compositions, dynamic interplay and bracing solos remains intact. More than half of the set is devoted to originals ... Here\u2019s hoping it won\u2019t take another 15 years for a sequel\".Booth, P.
