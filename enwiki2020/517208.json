    "text": "Boffin is a British slang term for a scientist, engineer, or other person engaged in technical or scientific research and development. The World War II conception of boffins as war-winning researchers lends the term a more positive connotation than related terms such as nerd, egghead, geek or spod. A \"boffin\" was viewed by some in the regular services as odd, quirky or peculiar, though quite bright and essential to helping in the war effort. ==Origins== ===Civil=== The origins and etymology of boffin are obscure. A link to the mathematician and evolutionary theorist Buffon has been proposed. Alternatively, linguist Eric Partridge proposed the term derived from Nicodemus Boffin, the good-hearted 'golden dustman' character who appears in the novel Our Mutual Friend (1864/5) by Charles Dickens, described there as a \"very odd-looking old fellow indeed\". In the novel, Mr Boffin pursues a late- life education, employing Silas Wegg to teach him to read. William Morris has a man called Boffin, based on Charles Dickens and said to be a variant of 'Biffin', meet the newly arrived time traveller in his novel News from Nowhere (1890). Dickens had referred to a 'Miss Biffins', an artist with only vestigial arms and legs, in Martin Chuzzlewit (1843). Thus at this time a 'Boffin' is a good-hearted person who has suffered from 'hard times', been ill-regarded, taken an opportunity to better themselves and done well, demonstrating remarkable social mobility. Possibly ill-favoured in appearance, possibly artistic. ===Military=== Eric Partridge noted that the word was used in the Royal Navy as \"an unkind term for any officer over forty\".Ronald W. Clark, The Rise of the Boffins, Phoenix House, 1962 Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press, 2006 () On the other hand, the Oxford English Dictionary quotes use in The Times in September 1945: First published in A Supplement to the OED I, 1972. Malvern was home to both TRE and RRDE, who were later merged into RRE. It supported all the services. The then superintendent of TRE uses the term to refer to earlier R.A.F. usage and in a 1942 RAF training film (School for Secrets) the word was cited as armed-forces slang for an RAF technician or research scientist. The founder of the organization that became TRE, Robert Watson-Watt cites Air Vice-Marshal G. P. Chamberlain, who played a vital part in the use of radar to defeat night- bombers, as the source. Of its etymology Sir Robert wrote: \u201cI am not quite sure about the true origins of this name of Boffin. ... I am sure it has nothing at all to do with that first literary \u201cBack Room Boy,\u201d the claustrophiliac Colonel Boffin, who as you remember never overtly emerged from his back room, although his voice was clearly audible from it. It is the very essence of the Boffin that he should emerge frequently and almost aggressively from the Back Room to which, however, he must return on his missions of interpretation and inspiration.\u201d Chamberlain claimed that 'A Puffin, a bird with a mournful cry, got crossed with a Baffin,In service 1934-1941. a mercifully obsolete Fleet Air Arm aircraft. Their offspring was a Boffin, a bird of astonishingly queer appearance, bursting with weird and sometimes inopportune ideas, but possessed of staggering inventiveness, analytical powers and persistence. Its ideas, like its eggs, were conical and unbreakable. You push the unwanted ones away, and they just roll back.' A naval origin is supported by reports of an anti-submarine trial by HM Signal School April 1 1941 based on equipment from TRE. Thus the origin appears to be Naval, rather than Air. Either way, it seems to have originated with servicemen working with radar 'boffins' and quickly adapted by other servicemen and boffins themselves. ==Usage == ===Civil=== The word made a few appearances in literature prior to World War II. J. R. R. Tolkien used Boffin as a surname for a hobbit family in The Hobbit (1937) (deriving the name from an Oxford family of bakers and confectioners. This family provides the main heroes, who meet Dicken's mould and are also small, like Sarah Biffen. There is also a Sergeant Boffin in Tolkien's Mr. Bliss (written around 1932, published 1982). ===World War II=== War-time reference to scientist was particularly associated with the members of the team that worked on radar at Bawdsey Research Station under Sir Robert Watson-Watt, but also with mathematicians like Alan Turing, aeronautical engineers like Barnes Wallis and their associates, and the scientists of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. Watson-Watt cites Robert Hanbury Brown as the prototypical boffin, who notes: \"It is quite wrong to use the word \u2018boffin\u2019 simply to describe a scientist or technician; a boffin is essentially a middleman, a bridge between two worlds ...\". Alternatively, Lindemann noted that Mervyn O'Gorman had inaugurated the use of scientific methods in aeronautical development at the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough, developing a cadre of 'leaders and explorers' who have retrospectively been termed 'boffins'.The Earl of Birkenhead, The Prof in Two Worlds: The Official Life of F.A. Lindemann, Viscount Cherwell, Collins, 1961 Some \"have been careful to differentiate between the true boffin and the 'nark', who was a member of the scientific staff of the Experimental Flying Section at Farnborough.' Similarly, the Secretary of State for War cites the contribution of an operational analyst to the U-boat war in 1943.\u201d Robert Watson-Watt,Sir Robert Watson-Watt, The Natural History of the Boffin, Proceedings of the Institute of Radar Engineers, 1953, page 1699 provided the following definition: \"The Boffin is a researcher, of high scientific competence, who has learned that a device of great technical elegance, capable of a remarkable performance in the hands of a picked crew, is not necessarily al good weapon of war. He (sic) is the instrument for building into the design provisions which depend on close analysis of the vehicle in which the device is to operate, the field conditions in which it is to operate and above all things, the competence of those who are to operate, maintain, and repair it. He alone can save us from the danger of engendering electronic dinosaurs; he alone can provide on the one hand the knowledge on which the machine can be measured to the man and on the other, the knowledge on which can be based the selection, training, and (this is important) the inspiration of the normal human beings on whom its successful use, in the end, must rest. He must have an understanding and an appreciation of these normal human beings. He can reach these only through having their confidence. He is a middleman, but he is a middleman who can effect enormous economies and enormous increases in efficiencies. He is a rare bird, but he should be free to flit over the whole field of defense science, its origins, and its applications.\" He also noted that \u201cIt is a term of respect, and admiration, but particularly a term of affection\u2014an affection which is expressed, as is the English way, in a slightly outside-in, jocular way so that the affection and admiration may not be regarded as too demonstrative.\u201d Thus a Boffin seems the type of person described by Isaac Newton (1642-1726/7) who, in his advice to the Admiralty, made an important distinction when he said that 'if, instead of sending observations of seamen to able mathematicians on land, the land would be able to send able mathematicians to sea, it would signify much more to the improvement of navigation and the safety of men's lives and estates on that element.' Watson-Watt stated that 'the bill of the boffin has two separate functions. One is to poke into other people's business and the other is to puncture 'the more highly coloured and ornate eggs of the \"Lesser Back Room Bird\", which are quite inappropriate to the military scene.' Henry Tizard has also been regarded as the prototypical boffin. More widespread usage may have been encouraged by the common wartime practice of using substitutes for critical words in war-related conversation, to confuse eavesdroppers or spies. ===Cold War=== In 1952 the Secretary of State for War noted the need to develop 'Colonel Boffins' at Shrivenham (1952). Notably,Richard Vincent acquired the nickname 'the boffin' after working at Malvern (1960-62) as a Gunnery Staff Captain and, via RMCS Shrivenham, rosing to become Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom).\"Field Marshal Lord Vincent obituary\", 13 September 2018, The Times In the 12 January 1953 issue of Life magazine, a short article on Malcolm Compston depicted him testing \"the Admiralty's new plastic survival suit\" in the Arctic Ocean; the article, entitled \"Cold Bath for a Boffin\", defines the term for its American audience as \"civilian scientist working with the British Navy\" and notes that his potentially life- saving work demonstrates \"why the term 'boffin', which first began as a sailor's expression of joking contempt, has become instead one of affectionate admiration\". By 1962 Boffins were characterised as 'the man (sic) who could understand the viewpoint of the Services, who worked with them, and who frequently shared their dangers' and R V Jones, wartime head of scientific intelligence, was referred to as a boffin. By the late 60s the term was being used to include all scientists who had worked at Malvern, irrespective of how closely they worked with the services, even 'backroom' staff.Captain Spencer Freeman CBE, Production under Fire, C J Fallon, 1967 ===Popular Culture=== Boffin continued, in the immediate postwar period, to carry some of its wartime connotation, as a modern-day wizard who labours in secret to create incomprehensible devices of great power. For example, the comics of the period depicted them as developing imaginative machines.Ed. Daniel TatarskyEagle Annual of the Cutaways, Orion Books,2009 However, their more nuanced wartime role was not reflected in popular culture, such as the 1951 Festival of Britain and the term was even used in the UK parliament (1953) to refer to boffins as narrow academics. The image of the technical boffin-hero was popularised by Nevil Shute's novel No Highway (1948), PaulBrickhill's non- fiction book The Dambusters (1951) and Shute's autobiography Slide Rule (1954). Films of The Small Back Room (1948), No Highway (1951, as No Highway in the Sky), and The Dambusters (1954) also featured boffins as heroes, as did stand-alone films such as The Man in the White Suit (1951) and The Sound Barrier (1952). John Wyndham's novel The Kraken Wakes (1953) includes a song called \"The Boffin's Lament\" or \"The Lay of the Baffled Boffin\", with Naval Boffins. A 1959 biography refers to 'muzzle-headed boffins in cob-webby small backrooms'. By the 1980s boffins were relegated, in UK popular culture, to semi-comic supporting characters such as Q, the fussy armourer-inventor in the James Bond films, and the term itself gradually took on a slightly negative connotation.\"Who are you calling a boffin?\", 24 September 2010, Jenny Rohn, The Guardian Thus, by the late 1990s, while the need for 'high-calibre' research staff with 'intimate knowledge' of users and their potential needs was well recognized, the term 'boffin' was no longer used in its original sense, lest it conjure up images of 'mad scientists'. Eds. Robert Bud and Philip Gummett, Cold War Hot Science, Harwood, 1999 This changed after 2003, with Backroom Boys: The Secret Return of the British Boffin and with a nostalgic popular book to accompany the Science Museum's 'Dan Dare and the Birth of High-Tech Britain' Exhibition. This describes the optimism as the war-time boffins turned their attention to turning Britain into 'a place of ingenious, and beautifully crafted home-spun technology and design', until thwarted by the consumerist policies of Harold Macmillan. Norman Foster is cited as carrying forward the spirit of the boffin. There has also been academic recognition that by 1959 boffins had become under-appreciated, under- valued and under-used, to the extent that the post-war vision of an integrated approach to the development and use of the sciences was never fully realized. ==References== ==Further reading== * Christopher Frayling, Mad, Bad And Dangerous?: The Scientist and the Cinema (2005) * George Drower, Boats, Boffins and Bowlines: The Stories of Sailing Inventors and Innovations, The History Press (2011) * Alfred Price, Instruments of Darkness: The Struggle for Radar Supremacy, Kimber, London (1967) * R.
