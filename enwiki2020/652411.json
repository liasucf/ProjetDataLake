Dagen H logo Left- hand traffic in Stockholm in 1966 Dagen H (H day), today usually called \"H\u00f6gertrafikoml\u00e4ggningen\" (\"The right-hand traffic diversion\"), was the day on 3 September 1967, in which the traffic in Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right.50 \u00e5r sedan: S\u00e5 gick det till n\u00e4r Sverige fick h\u00f6gertrafik, Expressen, 1 September 2017 The \"H\" stands for \"H\u00f6gertrafik\", the Swedish word for \"right traffic\". It was by far the largest logistical event in Sweden's history. Headlamp sold in Sweden not long before Dagen H. Opaque decal blocks the lens portion that would provide low beam upkick to the right, and bears warning \"Not to be removed before 3 September 1967\". A pair of colored gloves used in 1967 by Swedish authorities in order to remind drivers they should drive on the right as the traffic was changed ==Background== There were various arguments for the change: *All of Sweden's neighbours drive on the right, including Norway and Finland, with which Sweden has land borders, and five million vehicles cross those borders annually. *Approximately 90 percent of Swedes drove left-hand drive vehicles, and this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane highways. City buses were among the very few vehicles that conformed to the normal opposite- steering wheel rule, being right-hand drive (RHD). Includes photographs of a RHD bus in Odenplan, 1962 and a RHD trolleybus in Vattugatan in 1964. However, the change was unpopular; in a 1955 referendum, 83 percent voted to keep driving on the left. Nevertheless, the Swedish Parliament approved Prime Minister Tage Erlander's proposal on 10 May 1963 of right hand traffic beginning in 1967, as the number of cars on the road tripled from 500,000 to 1.5 million and was expected to reach 2.8 million by 1975. The Statens H\u00f6gertrafikkommission (HTK) (\"the state right-hand traffic commission\") was established to oversee the change. It also began implementing a four-year education programme on the advice of psychologists. The campaign included displaying the Dagen H logo on various commemorative items, including milk cartons and underwear. Swedish television held a contest for songs about the change, and the winning entry was \"H\u00e5ll dig till h\u00f6ger, Svensson\" ('Keep to the right, Svensson') written by Expressen journalist Peter Himmelstrand and performed by The Telstars.The Telstars - H\u00e5ll dig till h\u00f6ger, Svensson, YouTube, 23 February 2013 As Dagen H neared, every intersection was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic. Workers roamed the streets early in the morning on Dagen H to remove the plastic. A parallel set of lines was painted on the roads with white paint, then covered with black tape. Before Dagen H, Swedish roads had used yellow lines. Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, 20,000 in Stockholm alone. ==The switch== On Dagen H, Sunday, 3 September, all non- essential traffic was banned from the roads from 01:00 to 06:00. Any vehicles on the roads during that time had to follow special rules. All vehicles had to come to a complete stop at 04:50, then carefully change to the right-hand side of the road and stop again (to give others time to switch sides of the road and avoid a head-on collision) before being allowed to proceed at 05:00. In Stockholm and Malm\u00f6, however, the ban was longerfrom 10:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sundayto allow work crews to reconfigure intersections. Certain other towns also saw an extended ban, from 15:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sunday. One-way streets presented unique problems. Bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street. Intersections had to be reshaped to allow traffic to merge. == Results == The relatively smooth changeover saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents.Et tu, Iceland? Another change to right hand driving, Autocar, 23 May 1968 On the day of the change, only 157 minor accidents were reported, of which only 32 involved personal injuries, with only a handful serious. On the Monday following Dagen H, there were 125 reported traffic accidents, compared to a range of 130 to 198 for previous Mondays, none of them fatal. Experts suggested that changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking, as people already drove left-hand drive vehicles, thereby having a better view of the road ahead; additionally, the change made a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the target level and thus was followed by very cautious behaviour that caused a major decrease in road fatalities. Indeed, fatal car-to-car and car-to-pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result, and the number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%. These initial improvements did not last, however. The number of motor insurance claims returned to 'normal' over the next six weeks and, by 1969, the accident rates were back to the levels seen before the change. Trams in central Stockholm, in Helsingborg and most lines in Malm\u00f6 were withdrawn and replaced by buses, and over one thousand new buses were purchased with doors on the right-hand side. Some 8,000 older buses were retrofitted to provide doors on both sides, while Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 exported their right-hand drive (RHD) buses to Pakistan and Kenya. The modification of buses, paid by the state, was the largest cost of the change. Although all road traffic in Sweden became right handed, metro and railways did not switch to new rules and continue to drive on the left, with the exception of tram systems. Additionally, many of them were abandoned as a result of Dagen H; only the trams in Norrk\u00f6ping and Gothenburg and three suburban lines in the Stockholm area (Nockebybanan and Liding\u00f6banan) survived. Gothenburg had high cost for rebuilding trams, while Stockholm had cost only for bus purchasing, since the remaining lines had bidirectional trams with doors on both sides. In any event, most trams in Stockholm were replaced by the metro, a decision made long before the Dagen H decision. Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the right in May 1968, on a day known as H-dagurinn. ==See also== *730 (transport) *Switch to right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia *Transport in Sweden ==References== ==External links== *Television coverage of changeover, Sveriges Television *The Day Sweden Turned Right, BBC World Service, 2 September 2016 *Border crossing between Sweden and Finland, 1967 *\"A \u2018thrilling\u2019 mission to get the Swedish to change overnight\", BBC, 18 April 2018 Category:Traffic law Category:Transport in Sweden Category:1967 in Sweden Category:1967 in transport Category:Driving in Sweden ",
