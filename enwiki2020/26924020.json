    "text": "ThisIsRealMusic.com is an online hip-hop, soul and urban alternative music discovery tool. The site hosts a collective of indie, midstream and mainstream artists from across the globe and serves as a source to learn about and listen to new and established musicians. The site was originally created and programmed by its current Editor in Chief, Talib Nelson in 2006 as a music blog. But after a new partnership with indie film producer Terrance Wilmore and a massive overhaul, it turned into a fully functioning music website with articles, music videos, blogs, a music sampler, video interviews, free downloads (legal) and video blogs created by some of the artists themselves. The website relaunched in February 2009 and has since been able to align itself among bigger more established music sites. ==Featured Artists== *Eric Roberson *Lenny Kravitz *Amel Larrieux *J*Davey *The Foreign Exchange *Jay-Z *Jimi Hendrix *Kanye West *The Roots *Little Dragon *Musiq Soulchild *Talib Kweli *YahZarah *Citizen Cope *Jill Scott *SaRa *Erykah Badu *Outkast *Lupe Fiasco *TV On The Radio *The Gorillaz *N.E.R.D. *Raheem Devaughn *And more... ==References== ==External links== * ThisisRealMusic.com * Webby Discovery: ThisisRealMusic.com * Review of ThisisRealMusic.com Category:American music websites ",
