Delgado ended the season tied with Cal Ripken, Jr. for 37th place on the all-time career home run list with 431. ====2008 season==== During spring training 2008, Delgado was diagnosed with a hip impingement, however, the Mets decided to keep him on the active roster. As in the previous year, Delgado began the season in an offensive slump with a .204 batting average in April, and hitting just three home runs, but once again his stats improved as the season continued. In May, his batting average increased to .235 with five home runs. On June 15, 2008, Delgado broke Juan Gonz\u00e1lez's record for most runs batted in by a Puerto Rican player.

He played his last major league game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 10, 2009. Eight days later on May 18, the Mets announced that Delgado had a bone spur and a torn labrum in his hip, and he would have to undergo surgery. The Mets reported the next day that the surgery was successful and Delgado would be out for approximately ten weeks, which would delay his quest for 500 home runs. However, he did not play again in 2009. Delgado filed for free agency on November 5. Delgado made his return to the Puerto Rico Baseball League (PRBL) for the 2009 season, registering a batting average of .364 and one home run in his first three games. ===2010 free agency=== In February 2010, Delgado underwent another hip operation, this time to reconstruct the labrum on his right hip; he also underwent a micro-fracture procedure on his hip socket. Although Delgado had reportedly received interest from Major League clubs (including the Mets and Florida Marlins), he felt pain in his hip and decided to undergo the second surgery to be better prepared for the coming season. According to his agent, David Sloane, Delgado \"felt, despite the time it would take, it was a better option for him to be the Carlos Delgado of old instead of an old Carlos Delgado.\"Rosenthal, Ken. \"Agent: Delgado has hip surgery again,\" Fox Sports (February 20, 2010). ===Pawtucket Red Sox=== On August 7, 2010, the Boston Red Sox signed Delgado to a minor league contract. He played 5 games with the triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox between August 9 and 15, collecting 3 singles in 13 at-bats (.231, 0 HR, 2 RBI). This was the entire extent of Delgado's 2010 season after Delgado suffered a setback with his surgically repaired hip. ===Retirement=== On April 13, 2011, Delgado officially announced, while in San Juan, Puerto Rico, his retirement from professional baseball after 17 years in Major League Baseball. On December 7, 2012, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that Delgado would become the 10th person inducted to the club's Level of Excellence. The induction occurred on July 21, 2013 at Rogers Centre in Toronto. Delgado also threw the ceremonial first pitch for that day's game, with the Toronto Blue Jays playing against the Tampa Bay Rays. ===Career statistics=== In 2035 games over 17 seasons, Delgado posted a .280 batting average (2038-for-7283) with 1241 runs, 483 doubles, 18 triples, 473 home runs, 1512 RBI, 1109 bases on balls, .383 on- base percentage and .546 slugging percentage.

He reprised his role as hitting coach for Team Puerto Rico in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. ==Post-retirement career== After retiring, Delgado has continued to work in matters closely related to baseball. In February 2013, he was announced as the new member of the Board for the Development of the Puerto Rican Full-Time Athlete. This agency is directed by the Department of Sports and Recreation of Puerto Rico. Also, in March 2013, he served as hitting coach for the Puerto Rico national baseball team that represented the island at the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The team finished second in the rankings. He reprised his role as hitting coach for Team Puerto Rico in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. In his only appearance on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2015, Delgado received just 3.8% of the vote, below the 5% minimum required to remain on future ballots. That same year, he was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. ==Personal life== Delgado lives in his hometown of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. He is married to Betzaida Garc\u00eda, who is also from Aguadilla. They have a son, Carlos Antonio, and in 2010 adopted a baby daughter, Mariana Isabel. ===Social activism=== Like his hero (Roberto Clemente), Delgado is a well-known peace activist, and has been open about his political beliefs. As part of the Navy-Vieques protests, Delgado was actively opposed to the use of the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico as a bombing target practice facility by the United States Department of Defense, until bombing was halted in 2003. He is also against the occupation of Iraq. In the 2004 season, Delgado protested the war by silently staying in the dugout during the playing of \"God Bless America\" during the seventh inning stretch. Delgado does not make a public show of his beliefs, and even his teammates were not aware of his views until a story was published in July 2004 in the Toronto Star. Delgado was quoted as saying \"It's a very terrible thing that happened on September 11. It's (also) a terrible thing that happened in Afghanistan and Iraq, ... I just feel so sad for the families that lost relatives and loved ones in the war. But I think it's the stupidest war ever.\" The story was the subject of a media frenzy, mostly in New York, where on July 21, 2004, as was anticipated, Delgado was booed by Yankee fans for his passive protest during a game at Yankee Stadium. Delgado had explained that the playing of \"God Bless America\" had come to be equated with a war in which he didn't believe. In a New York Times interview, Delgado said this is what he believed in, and \"It takes a man to stand up for what he believes.\" After being traded to the Mets, in a conciliatory measure, Delgado opted to stand during the singing of \"God Bless America.\" Among other charity work, Delgado is well known for his generous visits to hospitals in his hometown where, on Three Kings Day, he brings toys to hospitalized children. In 2006, he joined Puerto Rico's Senate President in co-sponsoring a massive Three Kings gift-giving effort in the town of Lo\u00edza. Delgado started his own non-profit organization, \"Extra Bases\" to assist island youth. In 2007, Delgado donated video conference equipment to allow his hometown's Buen Samaritano Hospital to establish a regular link with a hospital in Boston in order to allow for remote diagnoses through telemedicine. Delgado has also contributed to improving Puerto Rico's public education system. In 2007, he participated in \"Sapientis Week\", an initiative sponsored by the non-profit Sapientis which brings distinguished public figures into classrooms in order to raise the public's awareness of the education crisis in Puerto Rico. Delgado taught a class on Athletic Mental Training and Health at the Ramon Power y Giralt School in the Luis Llorens Torres public housing complex. For his efforts, Delgado was awarded the Roberto Clemente Award in 2006. The award goes to the player in baseball who best exemplifies humanitarianism and sportsmanship, and was named after Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente in 1973. Prior to the 2008 season of the Puerto Rico Baseball League, Delgado was involved in an initiative to provide economic help to the Indios de Mayag\u00fcez team. ==Awards and honors== * World Series champion () * 2-time All-Star (2000, 2003) * 3-time AL Silver Slugger Award (1999, 2000, 2003) * AL RBI leader (2003) * 2000 AL Hank Aaron Award * 2000 Sporting News Player of the Year Award * 2006 Roberto Clemente Award * Toronto Blue Jays Level of Excellence * Member of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame ==See also== * Afro-Puerto Ricans * List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico * List of Toronto Blue Jays home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball home run records * List of Major League Baseball doubles records * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career total bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual doubles leaders * MLB hitters with four home runs in one game ==References== ==External links== : Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League RBI champions Category:Baseball coaches Category:Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Florida Marlins players Category:Knoxville Blue Jays players Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:New York Mets players Category:Pawtucket Red Sox players Category:People from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Senadores de San Juan players Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players Category:2009 World Baseball Classic players ",
