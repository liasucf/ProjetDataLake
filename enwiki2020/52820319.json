The pleon consists of a single segment, although the original fused segments are still discernible by lateral grooves. The telson is triangular, bears two small ridges near the base and a semicircle of tiny tubercles. Average body length is 10 mm. ==Distribution and habitat== The species occurs on the west coast of southern Africa, from L\u00fcderitz in Namibia to Cape Point in South Africa. It inhabits the intertidal zone or shallow water, where it may be found among weeds or under stones. For unknown reasons, the original description by Camill Heller reports the type locality as \"Java\". == References == Category:Sphaeromatidae Category:Crustaceans described in 1868 Category:Isopoda Category:Crustaceans of South Africa ",
