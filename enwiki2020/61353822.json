Its headwaters lie \"a short distance from the northwest arm of Moose Lake\". The river runs parallel to railway from The Pas to Churchill, for much or its length. In October 2018 a train operated by the Arctic Gateway Group derailed while crossing the river, releasing \"liquid petroleum\". ==References== Category:Rivers of Manitoba ",
