SEPTA Route 15, a surface line trolley running along Girard Avenue and Richmond Street, services the community; however Route 15 from the intersection of Frankford and Girard Avenues to the Westmoreland Loop is temporarily serviced by bus as portions of Richmond Street and Girard Avenue are affected by the construction at the Girard Avenue Interchange of U.S. Interstate 95. ===Rapid Transit=== Nearby rapid transit stops of the Market\u2013Frankford Line (commonly referred to as the \"EL\" or the \"Blue Line\") include Spring Garden Station (connection to Route 25 and Route 43), Girard Station (connection to Route 15), Berks Station (connection to Route 3), and York\u2013Dauphin Station (connection to Route 39 and Route 89). ===Roads and Highways=== Automobile continues to be a popular method of transportation for area residents.
