    "text": "Compound analgesics are those with multiple active ingredients; they include many of the stronger prescription analgesics. Active ingredients that have been commonly used in compound analgesics include: * aspirin or ibuprofen * caffeine * codeine or oxycodone * paracetamol (acetaminophen) * phenacetin Several such formulations have disappeared from over-the-counter status in drug store aisles and other retail outlets. One example is APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) compound tablets common from the 1940s to 1983; because of harmful side effects of phenacetin, Anacin in the U.S. was reformulated to eliminate it; while Vincent's APC is no longer sold. Some others have been judged to contribute too often to substance abuse. Another example is Bex, a once popular Australian compound analgesic which is no longer sold. It contained 42% aspirin, 42% phenacetin, plus caffeine. The United States Food and Drug Administration also now requires that manufacturers of compound analgesics unequivocally state each ingredient's purpose. ==References== ==External links== * APC definition and brief history.
