About 40 fathers \u2013 and some mothers \u2013 from across the country gathered in the centre of Oxford. Activists travelled the streets in two battle buses before heading to Witney to Conservative Party leader David Cameron\u2019s constituency off-ice, where they met Henry Bellingham, Conservative shadow spokesman for justice, who spoke to them for thirty minutes. In June 2010, Crawford demonstrated with other fathers outside Ken Clarke's home in West Bridgford.
