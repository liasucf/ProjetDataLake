It is a single-story Tudor Revival brick structure, whose shape is that of an H missing an arm (to the rear). To the front, it presents two gable-ended projecting sections, joined by a central portion with its roof ridge running parallel to the street. The right gable section has a large multipane window, with a trio of decorative square elements at the gable peak. The entry is found at the left side of the center section, with a window beside. Another large multipane window adorns the left gable section. The house was built in 1929, and is a distinctive local example of Tudor Revival architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1929 Category:Houses in Fayetteville, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fayetteville, Arkansas ",
