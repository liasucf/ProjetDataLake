Amitostigma tetralobum. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2004. Downloaded on 10 September 2015. The flowers are pink or pale purple. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 1912 by Achille Eug\u00e8ne Finet, as Peristylus tetralobus. It has been placed in both Orchis and Amitostigma. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014, in which this species was included as Amitostigma tetralobum, found that species of Amitostigma, Neottianthe and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Amitostigma and Neottianthe were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis tetraloba. == References == Category:Endemic orchids of China tetraloba Category:Endangered plants Category:Orchids of Yunnan Category:Flora of Sichuan Category:Plants described in 1912 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
