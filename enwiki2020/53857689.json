The Broncos were led by eighth-year head coach Terry Malley and played home games on campus at Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Santa Clara finished the season with a record of four wins and six losses and were outscored by their opponents for the season. Santa Clara competed in the last year of the Western Football Conference (WFC). The WFC folded in part because of a new NCAA rule that prohibited member institutions who competed at the level in other sports to compete at the level in football. Rather than move up to D-I for football, the university discontinued the football program after this season. (Rival Saint Mary's continued its football program as a Division I-AA independent for eleven more seasons.) In eight seasons as head coach of the Broncos, Malley compiled a record. ==Schedule== ==Team players in the NFL== No Santa Clara Broncos players were selected in the 1993 NFL Draft. ==Notes== ==References== Santa Clara Category:Santa Clara Broncos football seasons Santa Clara Broncos football ",
