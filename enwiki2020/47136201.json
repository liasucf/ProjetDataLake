Visual Components software is used for applications including layout planning, production simulation, off-line programming and PLC verification. ==History== Visual Components was founded 1999 in Helsinki, Finland. The company philosophy was to make manufacturing design and simulation technology easy to use and accessible to manufacturing organizations of all sizes. Visual Components\u2019 first product was a layout configuration and visualization tool for JOT Automation, a Finnish supplier of automated test and assembly solutions. In 2003, KUKA released KUKA.Sim Layout, a KUKA branded robot simulation and off-line programming software, developed by Visual Components In 2005, Visual Components introduced the \u201c3D\u201d product family; its first family of branded Visual Components products. In 2016, Visual Components introduced the Visual Components 4.0 product family. Visual Components 4.0 was built on a new software architecture and platform. The architecture was designed to take advantage of modern computing hardware and 64-bit processors. The platform was designed with Open APIs to facilitate easy customization and development of 3rd party applications. In December 2017, KUKA announced the acquisition of Visual Components. Following the announcement, a statement was made by KUKA that Visual Components remain a hardware neutral simulation platform, and would continue to support and expand its list of robot models, currently 1,200+ models from 30+ robot brands. ==Products== ===Essentials === Allows users to design, build, and simulate production processes using ready- made components. It also includes features for robot teaching, PLC connectivity, virtual reality, and more. === Professional === Includes everything in Essentials and provides tools for component modeling. === Premium === Includes everything in Essentials and Professional, and provides tools for off-line programming and advanced robotics applications. == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
