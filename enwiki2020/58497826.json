There is a new betting system that is used this season. 200 million won (the winner's final prize money) will be equally divided among the four producer teams (50 million won for each team) prior to Round Two, and can be used to evaluate each passed rapper's rap in the round.

Three: Fight Money Battle Round + Revival Round \u2013 The bets each rapper received from Round Two has been carried forward to this round. Different from the 1-on-1 Rap Battles that have been used in previous seasons, for this round, there can be a triple battle. MC Kim Jin-pyo will randomly pick a card with a rapper's name, and contestants that want to battle against this picked rapper can step forward to ask for a battle. The picked rapper will then pick one of the rappers for a 1-on-1 rap battle. A triple battle is established if a picked rapper picks two of the rapper challengers, or when one rapper wants to go up and join an already set 1-on-1 rap battle. The winner of each triple battle will take all the money of the two other rappers in each triple battle, and the latter two will also be eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie, a sudden death 1-on-1 match will be held to determine the winner. Selected rappers that were eliminated in this round will participate in the 1-on-1 revival round, where the winner of each 1-on-1 battle will advance to the next round, the Group Battle. The winner of each Revival Round battle will receive 100,000 won as Fight Money. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Rapper #1 !Result !Rapper #2 !Result !Rapper #3 !Result !Total Fight Money Accumulated |- |D.Ark |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Owen Ovadoz |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Choi Eun-seo |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated | 12,600,000 |- |Chillin Homie |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Osshun Gum |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |New Champ |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |3,600,000 |- |Keem Hyo-eun |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Pento |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Reddy |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |10,300,00 |- |24 Flakko |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |DOX-A |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Lee Su-rin |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |4,300,000 |- |Black Nine |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Errday |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Walter |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |800,000 |- |Seo Il-gyo |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Ryno |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Logan |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |5,000,000 |- |JJK |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Jo Won-woo (H2ADIN) |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Choi LB |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |1,300,000 |- |Changstarr |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Boo Hyun-seok |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Simba Zawadi |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |5,100,000 |- |Swervy |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Park Dan |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Lee Dong-min |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |300,000 |- |Lil Tachi |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Coogie |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Zene The Zilla |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |10,300,000 |- |Snacky Chan |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Dbo |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |YunB |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed (via sudden death against Dbo) |5,000,000 |- |pH-1 |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Kidd King |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Kid Milli |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |12,400,000 |- |POY Muzeum |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Loopy |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |NO:EL |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |9,700,000 |- |Dayday |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Superbee |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed (via sudden death against Chaboom) |Chaboom |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |16,400,000 |- |Nafla |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |EK |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Bully Da Ba$tard |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |27,000,000 |- |Los |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Damndef |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |FeveR |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |6,700,000 |- |Slick O'domar |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Choi Seo-hyun (Dooyoung) |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |A-Chess |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |2,300,000 |- |ODEE |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Siano |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Mac9 |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |5,300,000 |- |OLNL |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Young Jay |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Rakon |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |3,600,000 |- |Qwala |style=\"background:lightblue\"| Passed |Kim Seung-min |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |Louie |style=\"background:red\"| Eliminated |1,400,000 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" border=\"2\" |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Revival Round |- |Dbo |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\" |Zene The Zilla |- | style=\"background:aqua\" |pH-1 |vs. |Reddy |- |Bully Da Ba$tard |vs. | style=\"background:aqua\" |Chaboom |- |NO:EL |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\" |EK |- |} : Indicates the winner. * Round Four: Group Battle \u2013 The remaining 24 contestants after Round Three will be split into two teams: Team Nafla and Team Superbee, named after the two rappers that currently have the most Fight Money accumulated.

Regarding this controversy, Mnet have released an official statement that they will only air footage of D.Ark that is necessary to properly convey the efforts of the other contestants and the judges, instead of completely editing him out. His song for the 1st Live Performances, titled \"Trap Middle School Kid\", was not released on various music sites, and his performance of the song on the show was also not uploaded on the official Mnet channel. * At the end of the 1st Live Performances Round, fans were outraged due to the outcome of EK vs. Kid Milli's match-up in which they believed that voting was based on popularity over performance. Although both performances were entertaining, most fans, even some of those who supported Kid Milli, believed that EK's performance stood out more and had a more dynamic presence that dominated the atmosphere. In fact, the entire audience cheered for EK similar to how Nafla did for him during the Group Battle Round. Despite this, Kid Milli won the match-up with a landslide. Fans believed that Kid Milli felt sorry for them, stating that the audience favored him over EK due to his popularity. Others praised EK for featuring his own dance crew, Most Badass Asian (M.B.A) and presented one of the most legendary performances in Show Me The Money history, without any featuring artist. ==Discography== ==Notes== ==References== 4 Category:2018 South Korean television seasons Category:Music competitions in South Korea ",
