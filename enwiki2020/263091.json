    "text": "5.5 GHz cantenna as a feed horn A cantenna (a portmanteau blending the words can and antenna) is a homemade directional waveguide antenna, made out of an open-ended metal can. Cantennas are typically used to increase the range (or discovery) of Wi-Fi networks. == Construction == A Pringles cantenna for Wi-Fi The cylinder portion of the can may consist of metal-coated paperboard. Although some designs are based on a Pringles potato chips can, this tube is too narrow to increase the 2.4 GHz signal by a useful amount, although at 5 GHz it would be about the right size. However, a cantenna can be made from various cans or tubes of an appropriate diameter. Some designs include a pole mount to elevate the cantenna. At 2.4 GHz, losses can occur if the cable from the cantenna to the Wi-Fi circuitry is too long. A more efficient cantenna can be made by minimising this length or connecting the cantenna directly to the Wi-Fi circuitry. == Use == A cantenna on an OLPC laptop Cantennas are typically used for extending a wireless local area network (WLAN). The tiny design makes them ideal for mobile applications such as wardriving. Cantennas can be used to increase cell phone range,MAKE: Blog: Cell phone - Cantenna diagram and parts list improve reception, and decrease noise. A cantenna can be used as a satellite dish feed horn. The 5.5 GHz cantenna dimensions are almost perfect in that they make a good fit for the standard TV satellite dish. The resulting setup is a low-cost high-quality high-gain antenna. Such setups are widely used in wireless community networks for long-distance links. Cantennas may be used with other RF devices such as wireless security cameras.Cantenna.com User Guide == See also == a Cantenna * WokFi * WarXing == References == == External links == * Extend your wireless network by building a Wi-Fi cantenna * Amateurlogic Episode 3 (Construction details for a more efficient cantenna) * Waveguide Can-tenna * Youtube video on How To Build A low loss Cantenna * How To Build A Tin Can Waveguide Antenna * Do-It-Yourself Wireless Antenna Update * Cantenna Calculator * How to build Cantenna (Video) Category:Wireless networking Category:Radio frequency antenna types Category:Antennas (radio) ",
