McAllister, and T. N. Campbell (1962). \u201cIn Memoriam: George Charles Marius Engerrand.\u201d Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 32:1-8.Campbell, T. N. (1962). \u201cGeorge Charles Marius Engerrand, 1877-1961.\u201d American Anthropologist 64(5):1052-1056. He studied at the University of Bordeaux, earning licentiates in geology (1897) and botany (1898). As a university student, he was a Dreyfusard in the controversy over the false conviction of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Consequently, under the sponsorship of French geographer and anarchist \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus, after graduation he emigrated to Belgium to avoid service in the French military. In Belgium, he taught, did field research, and published on geological and archaeological subjects, including the controversial identification of \u201ceoliths,\u201d or possible primitive stone tools dating well back into the Pleistocene.Engerrand, Georges (1905). \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de la question des \u00e9olithes.\u201d Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des sciences pures et appliqu\u00e9es 23:541-548. In 1907, Engerrand moved to Mexico, where he continued his work in both archaeology and geology and became a Mexican citizen in 1908. He was a professor of prehistory at the National Museum of Anthropology and a successor to Franz Boas as director the Escuela Internacional de Arqueolog\u00eda e Historia. Among many contributions, he played a key role in developing a prehistoric stratigraphic chronology for the Valley of Mexico and in investigating rock art in northwestern Baja California.Engerrand, Georges (1912). \u201cNouveaux petroglyphes de la Basse- Californie.\u201d Revue Anthropologique 22:200-211.Laylander, Don (2014). \"The Beginnings of Prehistoric Archaeology in Baja California, 1732-1913.\" Pacific Coast Archaeological Society Quarterly 50(1&2):1-31 However, the political climate during the Mexican Revolution was unfavorable, and in 1917 Engerrand again emigrated to the United States. After teaching briefly in Mississippi, he served as a member of the University of Texas\u2019s anthropology department from 1920 until 1961, producing an ethnographic study of the German immigrant community of Wends in Texas.Engerrand, George C.
