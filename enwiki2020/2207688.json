The shop sold groceries and only had a turnover of \u00a320 per week, during the 1850s when Knightsbridge grew into one of the most fashionable parts of London. In 1860 Charles sold the business to his son, Charles Digby Harrod. The trade at Harrods continued to grow and by 1868 the shop had sixteen staff and the turnover had risen to \u00a31,000 per week. Harrod concentrated on encouraging wealthy people to his store and provided a personalised service for important customers.
