    "text": "Great Urban Race is an urban scavenger hunt hosted by Red Frog Events where teams solve clues and complete mental and physical challenges while navigating their way through a city. In 2012, there were 20 races around the world. The 2012 championship race was held in Las Vegas on November 10 for a grand prize of $10,000. == History == Mirroring the TV show The Amazing Race, founder of Red Frog Events, Joe Reynolds wanted to give people the opportunity to experience that same type of competitive adventure. At the time, Reynolds owned and operated his own house painting business. In 2007, Reynolds organized and launched Great Urban Race, LLC which held its first race on September 15 in Chicago, Illinois. After the Chicago race, Reynolds, with the help of friend and business partner Ryan Kunkel, put on seven more races around the country that year. By 2008, Great Urban Race had expanded to 20 cities nationwide, including a national championship race held in Las Vegas for a $10,000 grand prize. Throughout the first four years of the event, Great Urban Race has had over 34,000 participants. After the growth of Great Urban Race, Reynolds and Kunkel launched another race series, Warrior Dash, and renamed the company to Red Frog Events. === 2007 === The inaugural Great Urban Race took place in Chicago in 2007, spurring seven other events. In less than four months Great Urban Race went from a single race to a national event. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width: 500px\" |- ! scope=\"col\" width=\"375\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" width=\"375\" | Date |- | Chicago, IL || September 15, 2007 |- | Denver, CO || September 29, 2007 |- | Boston, MA || October 13, 2007 |- | Cincinnati, OH || October 20, 2007 |- | San Francisco, CA || November 3, 2007 |- | Austin, TX || November 17, 2007 |- | Los Angeles, CA || December 2, 2007 |- | San Diego, CA || December 8, 2007 |} === 2008 === Great Urban Race took place in 20 cities in 2008.

There is a prize for the team with the best costume after each race. * The course is designed for the fastest teams to finish in 1.5 to 3 hours, with the majority finishing in 3 to 4 hours. The race course is shut down after 5 hours. * The distance of the race depends on the route taken by each team. Typically a race is between 4 and 8 miles. === Race Details === On race day, the Great Urban Race website suggests participants arrive a half-hour to an hour before the start time. At 12pm, sealed envelopes containing the clue sheet are distributed and the race begins. Rules for the race are: * There can be up to four members per team. As of 2012 there are no adult or family divisions. * Teams may travel by foot or public transit, which includes buses, trains, subways, and public trolleys. No taxis, bikes, or roller blades are allowed. * Teams are allowed to solve clues in any order they choose. Some teams solve all clues and map out a route before leaving the start line, while others prefer to solve clues en route. * Teams are required to finish 11 of 12 clues correctly. The clock begins once the clue envelopes are opened, and times are recorded as teams cross the finish line under the Great Urban Race finish arch. * Penalties are given to teams who did not complete or incorrectly completed a clue. For each clue not completed correctly, teams receive a 30-minute penalty that will be added to their final time. * After penalty adjustments, teams with times longer than five hours will receive a DNF (did not finish). === Clues === Clues vary between race locations and include physical challenges, puzzles, brainteasers and interaction with the public. Examples of past clues include: Greek dancing lessons, learning how to surf, Segway riding, Tae Kwon Do lessons, bicycle racing, fish wrangling, anagrams, cryptograms, etc. === Awards === Every Great Urban Race concludes with an awards ceremony and costume contest. Cash prizes are awarded to the top three teams. :1st place: $300 :2nd place: $200 :3rd place: $100 * The top three places are also awarded free entry into the Championship Race. * Top 25 teams qualify for the Championship Race. * Best Costume: Teams nominate themselves for this award and the winner is judged by crowd applause. * The St. Jude Hero award is given to the first team that crosses the finish line wearing a St. Jude cape, signifying they've raised at least $250 for St. Jude * The St. Jude Top fundraising winners qualify to compete in the Championship Race. == Charity Partnerships == Great Urban Race partners with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital on a national level. Participants are encouraged to register as St. Jude Heroes and raise funds for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Heroes that raise at least $250 are eligible for race day prizes. A St. Jude representative is present at each race and determines fundraising totals. Red Frog Events donates an additional $10 for every person who registers as a St. Jude Hero and commits to raising funds for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 2009 was the first year Great Urban Race partnered with St. Jude and since then, Red Frog Events and Great Urban Race has raised over $300,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Great Urban Race also pairs with local philanthropic organizations at each event. One clue at each race requires participants to donate a needed item to a local charity. Past charities have included Ronald McDonald House, food banks, and shelters. == Championship Race == The Championship Race consists of two parts: a preliminary race from 9am-1pm and the Elite Eight race which is from 2pm-5pm. The top eight teams compete in the Elite Eight race which consists of intricate clues throughout the designated city. The top team from the Elite Eight race wins a prize of $10,000. Afterwards, Red Frog Events hosts a post- race party for all participants in the city where the race is held. ==References== ==External links== *Great Urban Race *Red Frog Events *Red Frog Events Blog *Facebook: Great Urban Race *Twitter: Great Urban Race *YouTube Category:Scavenger hunts ",
