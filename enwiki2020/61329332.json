He was appointed the ouparach (heir apparent or viceroy) in 1618. He was appointed the regent after Chey Chettha II's death, assuming the title uprayorach (\u17a7\u1797\u1799\u17c4\u179a\u17b6\u1787), the title usually borne by kings who had abdicated but retained executive powers. Outey married Princess Ang Vathi, whom was the former fianc\u00e9e of king Thommo Reachea II (Ponhea To). The dissatisfied king rebelled against him but was defeated and executed together with Ang Vathi in 1631. Ang Tong Reachea (Ponhea Nou) was crowned the new king. Ang Tong Reachea died in mysterious circumstances in June 1640. Although Ponhea Chan should be the next king, Outey forced Chan to give the crown to his own son Batom Reachea. With the help of Cham and Malay mercenaries, Chan assassinated Outey on 5 January 1642.the historical background - Shodhganga, page. 30 In the same time Batom Reachea was away on a hunting trip. Chan captured him and had him executed in Oudong. ==References== * Bernard Philippe Groslier avec la collaboration de C.R.
