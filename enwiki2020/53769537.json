    "text": "Pavle Tvrtkovi\u0107 (; 1834\u201351) was a Serbian Orthodox priest from Bosnia who participated in the rebellion organized by priest Jovica Ili\u0107 in northeastern Ottoman Bosnia in March 1834, published a collection of Old Serbian documents in 1840, and was the Serbian court priest of Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (r. 1839\u201342). Tvrtkovi\u0107 was from Bosnia. Tvrtkovi\u0107, who was Jovica's closest associate and had in the preceding years fled to Belgrade, organized people in Serbia, and at first had the support of Serbian Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107. Notable priests Tvrtkovi\u0107 and Milo Vitkovi\u0107 and some serfs from Bosnia had met in Po\u017earevac with Prince Milo\u0161 whom they asked to take up the side of the Christians in Bosnia at the Porte. Those who stayed in Serbia prepared from \u0160abac a rebellion in the nahiye of Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Tuzla and Derventa. The rebellion, which broke out in the Derventa and Grada\u010dac nahiye and was active 10\u201313 March 1834, was quickly suppressed by the Ottoman government. After the collapse of the rebellion, Prince Milo\u0161 received and protected some of the rebel leaders and protested at the Porte over the atrocities and penalties. Tvrtkovi\u0107, who since 1835 often signed himself as Karano-Tvrtkovi\u0107 (, sometimes rendered ), arrived at Trieste in September 1835 during his trip through Dalmatia and Montenegro. Tvrtkovi\u0107 was hired as the court priest of Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (r. 1839\u201342). In 1840, Tvrtkovi\u0107 published The Serbian Memorials (), a collection of Old Serbian documents from the Dubrovnik Archive. The publication sparked some controversy, as he had put his name on someone else's work and allegedly \"barely could read\". In December 1840 Tvrtkovi\u0107 informed the Serbian court over the dissatisfaction of the Christians in Bosnia with the rule of Vecihi Pasha and failure to comply with the hatt-i sharif. When Prince Mihailo was forced to flee Serbia to Austrian territory in August or September 1842, Tvrtkovi\u0107 likely before or together with him crossed into Zemun. Tvrtkovi\u0107 spent the 1842\u201343 winter at Zemun, then went to Novi Sad. He lived in Novi Sad until May 1848. In Novi Sad, at Sima Adamovi\u0107's house, he swore in some rebel leaders. He befriended writer \u0110or\u0111e Rajkovi\u0107. He later stayed at Slavonski Brod, and was treated medically at Topusko. He died some years prior to 1870, as a parish priest in Slatina. He wanted to change his listed surname in the baptism register, and was answered on 5 August 1851 by Orthodox bishop Jovanovi\u0107 that the name could not be changed without Imperial approval, and noted that Tvrtkovi\u0107 had in his 27 November 1837 request signed only as \"Karanovi\u0107\". In documents held at the Archive of the Eparchy of Upper Karlovac it is seen that he after 1834 signed as Karanovi\u0107 (), then Karano-Tvrtkovi\u0107, and finally in 1850 and 1851 as Tvrtkovi\u0107. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:Serbian Orthodox clergy Category:Serbian rebels Category:People from the Principality of Serbia Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
