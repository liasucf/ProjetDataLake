However summer-like weather generally occurs from November to early April, and wintery weather can occur between May and September. ===Summer=== Summer is the time of year with the greatest temperature variation for Perth. Maximum temperatures usually range between and , and minimum temperatures usually range between and . The hottest month is February, with an average maximum temperature of , which is the second highest monthly maximum of the Australian capital cities, only behind Darwin. Humidity during summer is usually low, with an average 3 pm dew point of in February. Perth has colder summer nights than Sydney, Brisbane and Darwin however, with the highest minimum monthly temperature being , in February. On most summer afternoons a sea breeze, known locally as the \"Fremantle Doctor\", blows from the southwest, providing relief from the hot north-easterly winds. Temperatures often fall below a few hours after the arrival of the wind change. The average 3 pm wind speed for January at Swanbourne, on the coast is , making afternoon beach visits sometimes unpleasant. Suburbs closer to the coast generally have lower maximum temperatures than suburbs further inland, as the sea breeze arrives later. When the sea breeze does not arrive, temperatures can reach above . The sea breeze is strongest in December and January, because the sea and land temperatures have a larger difference than in February and March. Heat waves usually occur a few times per year where temperatures reach and above. They are caused by slow moving high pressure systems that stay in the Great Australian Bight for a few days. They create north-easterly winds which bring hot, dry air from the outback. The WA Department of Health defines a heat wave to be 3 or more consecutive days where the forecast minimum and maximum temperatures average at least . The Bureau of Meteorology defines a heatwave to be three or more days of unusually high maximum and minimum temperatures. Temperatures above occur on average 25.8 times per year, and temperatures above occur on average 3.6 times each year. They occur most often in January and February, but they have been known to occur anytime between November and March. Most days above only occur once or twice per heatwave, however heatwaves with 4 consecutive days above have occurred twice in Perth, in February 2016 and February 1933. The humidity for the most part is low when it is hot in Perth, but for the few days after a heatwave, winds are generally south to south-westerly, causing higher than usual humidity. Visiting the beach is a common summertime activity for Perth, particularly during heatwaves. Sun protection should be used, because the average ultraviolet index during summer is 12 (extreme). The hot, dry and sometimes windy summer conditions in Perth causes bushfires to be common in and around Perth.

Tropical cyclones do not ever hit Perth, as the sea surface temperatures are too low for tropical cyclones to exist there, however remnants of ex-tropical cyclones from the north-west of Western Australia can bring heavy rain. This happens more often from late summer to mid autumn compared to early and mid summer. Summer has a greater number of extreme rainfall events than winter. Perth's highest one day rainfall totals are all during summer.
