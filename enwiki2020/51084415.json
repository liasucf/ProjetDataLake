The party sat on the centre-left of the Chamber of Deputies between the small republican opposition and the centrist Third Party, but to the left from the conservative Resistance Party. == History == The founder of the Movement Party was Jacques Laffitte, an Orl\u00e9anist banker who supported the July Revolution of 1830. For his role in the King Louis Philippe I's coronation, Lafitte was charged to form a government, but last only six months as the King became more conservative over time.
