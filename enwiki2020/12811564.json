    "text": "Xylofagou ( []) is a sprawling Greek-Cypriot village situated close to the A3 Motorway between Dhekelia (Larnaca) and Paralimni / Agia Napa. It lies on the northern flank of a hill, on the edge of an area of a group of several similar villages known as the \"Kokkinochoria\" (\"the red villages\"), known for growing vegetables, especially potatoes, in red soil. ==Etymology== \"Xylo\" is the Greek word for \"wood\" and a \"fagou\" is an extremely popular barbecue-style spit roast used on holidays and high-days for cooking souvlakia. Most of the village lies in Larnaca District. ==Landmarks== The town is home to a medieval Venetian watchtower. Near Xylofagou is the Cave of the 40 Martyrs, where Christian soldiers sacrificed their lives in the 16th century to evade capture by the Ottomans. ==Xylophagou Tower== Xylophagou Tower is a Venetian watchtower located in Pyrgos, south of Xylofagou.
