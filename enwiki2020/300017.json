Kingston Penitentiary was one of nine prisons in the Kingston area which range from low-security facilities to the maximum-security facilities Kingston Penitentiary and Millhaven Institution (which was initially built to replace Kingston Pen). The institution was built on land described as \"lot number twenty, in the first concession of the Township of Kingston\". The cells originally measured 73.7 cm (26 inches) wide by 244 cm (8 feet) deep and 200.7 cm (6 feet, 7 inches) high. The area had a 12 foot high wooden picket fence. In 1845, towers, stock walls and the north gate house were completed. In 1859 \u2013 1861 a dome was added connecting four cellblocks. The site was chosen for \"combining the advantages of perfect salubrity, ready access to the water, and abundant quantities of fine limestone.\"J. A. Edmison The History of Kingston Penitentiary Kingston, Ontario Queen's University. p. 25. Retrieved January 20, 2010 Six inmates were accepted when the penitentiary was opened. English author Charles Dickens visited Kingston in 1842 and commented in his American Notes, \"There is an admirable jail here, well and wisely governed, and excellently regulated, in every respect. The men were employed as shoemakers, ropemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, carpenters, and stonecutters; and in building a new prison, which was pretty far advanced towards completion. The female prisoners were occupied in needlework.\"Charles Dickens, Pictures from Italy: And American Notes for General Circulation, p. 362, G.W. Carleton & Company, 1874 The penitentiary's western wall adjoins the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour, which hosted the sailing events for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Immediately across the road to the north is the now-closed Kingston Prison for Women (the property was bought by Queen's University in January 2008), which functioned from January 24, 1934 to May 8, 2000 to take female prisoners who had been housed in segregated quarters in the main facility.

The Lethbridge Herald, August 16, 1954, p.1\u2014involving 900 inmates. During the riot a breakout was attempted, but was foiled by the guards at the gate. The trouble apparently began during a morning baseball game in the exercise yard, when a guard was attacked, followed by several inmates setting fire to various buildings in the yard, including the shops and a warehouse, causing an estimated $2 million in damages. The disturbance was quelled by the guards aided by 160 Canadian Army troops and a squad of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers. The 50 ringleaders were placed in solitary confinement.\"Extra Guards Patrol Big Pen After Riot\". Syracuse Herald Journal, August 16, 1954, p.7 ====1971==== On April 14, 1971, a riot lasted four days and resulted in the death of two inmates and destruction of much of the prison. Security was substantially increased and prison reforms were instituted. Six guards were held hostage, but all were eventually released unharmed.Special Report: 'A horrendous scene', Kingston Whig-Standard April 9, 2011 The prisoners issued formal grievances to the media including lack of recreational time, lack of work, and concerns about their future conditions in the newly built Millhaven Prison. A 1971 inquiry into the riot, chaired by Justice J.W. Swackhamer, reported that they had \"already noted a number of causes for Kingston's failure: the aged physical facilities, overcrowding, the shortage of professional staff, a program that had been substantially curtailed, the confinement in the institution of a number of people who did not require maximum security confinement, too much time spent in cells, a lack of adequate channels to deal with complaints and the lack of an adequate staff which resulted in the breakdowns of established procedures to deal with inmate requests. The polarization between inmates and custodial staff, between custodial staff and professional staff, led inevitably to the destruction of the program and deterioration in the life of the institution.\" This riot, together with successors in 1975, led to an official Sub-Committee on the Penitentiary System in Canada, chaired by Justice Mark MacGuigan.Annual Report 2007/08, 35th Anniversary, Office of the Correctional Investigator, 1973-2008 The 1977 MacGuigan Report recommended the creation of an Independent Chairperson (ICP) to investigate prisoner complaints.Independent Chairperson to Adjudicate Disciplinary Proceedings 1977 ===1971\u20131981=== From 1971\u20131981, the penitentiary served as Corrections Canada's Ontario Region Reception Centre.

In its later years, Kingston Penitentiary became known as a \"dumping ground for bad guards\", and after an investigation by the RCMP, eight guards were terminated.Daniel Schwartz, \u201cKingston Pen: 7 things to know about Canada\u2019s notorious prison\u201d, \"CBC News\", September 26, 2013.
