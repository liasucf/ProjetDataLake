The purpose of the march was to protest against the Government of Mexico. The march was organized by the National Strike Council (CNH, in Spanish, Consejo Nacional de Huelga), the organization behind the Mexican Movement of 1968. CNH called for a silent pacifist demonstration to controvert Mexican Government allegations of violence of the movement and the silence made by President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz in his Fourth Government Inform on September 1, 1968 about the students and the movement. So the demonstration was entirely silent and with Mexican flags instead strike' red and black flags also paintings and portraits of heroes of Mexico.
