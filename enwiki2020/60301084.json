    "text": "VOC exempt solvents are organic compounds that are exempt from restrictions placed on most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the United States. This class currently includes acetone, dimethyl carbonate, methyl acetate, parachlorobenzotrifluoride (Oxsol 100), tert-butyl acetate, and propylene carbonate. == Solvent == In the US, dimethyl carbonate was exempted under the definition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by the U.S. EPA in 2009.http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/fact_sheets/voc_exemp01011309.pdf. Information about the EPA's action on exempting dimethyl carbonate as a VOC and petitioner's background information, public comments and other references are available electronically at http://www.regulations.gov, EPA\u2019s electronic public docket and comment system. The docket number for this action is Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0948. See http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1pfpr.html and scroll down to Jan 13, 2009 pdf for the rule. Due to its classification as VOC exempt, dimethyl carbonate has grown in popularity and applications as a replacement for methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and other solvents. tert-Butyl acetate is used as a solvent in the production of lacquers, enamels, inks, adhesives, thinners and industrial cleaners. It also gained EPA VOC exempt status. ==Safety== VOC exempt status does not mean that the solvent is non- flammable and thus safety must be carefully considered. Acetone for example has an extremely low flash point and care is needed in handling. ==See also== *Greenhouse gas ==References== Category:Regulation of chemicals Category:Solvents Category:Regulation in the United States ",
