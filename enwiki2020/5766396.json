Widespread and common throughout its large range, the glossy-mantled manucode is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. ==Habitat== The glossy-mantled manucode live in lowland rainforest, riverine and monsoon forests, forest edge, swamp-forest and woodlands. ==Description== Manucodia ater. Museum specimen The glossy-mantled manucode is medium-sized, around 42 cm long, glossed green, blue and purple black with a red iris, black bill, long graduated tail and somewhat elongated upper breast and neck feathers. Both sexes are similar. The female is a slightly smaller than the male. In appearance, the glossy-mantled manucode resembles and is difficult to distinguished from its nearest relatives, the crinkle-collared and jobi manucodes. ==Biology== These birds have diurnal habits. They tend to move alone or in pairs, rarely in small groups: They spend most of their time looking for food among the branches of trees, ready to hide themselves in the thick vegetation when disturbed. They are not particularly timid, but it is easier to hear their calls or flights rather than observe them directly. The diet consists mainly of fruits, figs and arthropods. ==Bibliography== * Beehler, B. M.
