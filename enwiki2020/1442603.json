    "text": "Yogi's Gang is an American animated television series and the second incarnation of Hanna-Barbera's Yogi Bear series; which aired 16 half-hour episodes on ABC from , to . The show began as Yogi's Ark Lark, a special TV movie on The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie in 1972. Fifteen original episodes were produced for broadcast on ABC, with the hour-long Yogi's Ark Lark thrown in as a split-in-half two-parter. The show confronted social and cultural issues like ecology and bigotry, with villains named Mr. Waste, Mr. Bigot, the Envy Brothers, Lotta Litter, the Greedy Genie and Mr. Cheater. After a successful run on Saturday mornings, episodes of Yogi's Gang were serialized on the syndicated weekday series, Fred Flintstone and Friends in 1977\u201378. In the late 1980s, repeats were shown on USA Cartoon Express and later resurfaced on Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Yogi's Gang is the only Yogi Bear show to have a laugh track. ==Plot== Yogi, Quick Draw, Huck and the rest of the gang encounter a variety of villains such as Captain Swashbuckle Swipe, Smokestack Smog, Lotta Litter, the Envy Brothers, Mr. Hothead, Dr. Bigot (and his henchmen Professor Haggling and Professor Bickering), the Gossipy Witch of the West, J. Wantum Vandal, the Sheik of Selfishness, Commadore Phineas P. Fibber, I.M. Sloppy, Peter D. Cheater, Mr. Waste, Hilarious P. Prankster, and the Greedy Genie, who act as their friends, hosts and/or guests, but embody some of the most common human faults and vices. Yogi and crew would often put up with them which ends with the villains either being repelled or outdone by their actions. ==Characters== * Atom Ant * Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy * The Hillbilly Bears * Hokey Wolf and Ding-A-Ling Wolf * Huckleberry Hound * Lippy the Lion and Hardy Har Har * Magilla Gorilla * Peter Potamus and So-So * Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks * Punkin' Puss & Mushmouse * Quick Draw McGraw & Baba Looey * Ricochet Rabbit & Droop-a-Long * Secret Squirrel and Morocco Mole * Snagglepuss * Snooper and Blabber * Squiddly Diddly * Touch\u00e9 Turtle and Dum Dum * Wally Gator * Yakky Doodle * Yogi Bear and Boo-Boo Bear ==Voices== * Josh Albee - Freddy, Jimmy * Julie Bennett \u2013 Cindy Bear * Tom Bosley \u2013 Commadore Phineas P.
