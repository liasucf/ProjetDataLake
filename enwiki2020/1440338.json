With a total land area of , it is the largest city in the island of Luzon and the fourth largest city in land area in the Philippines, after Davao City, Puerto Princesa, and Zamboanga City. It holds the title as the most number of voters in the province with voters. Ilagan was a first class municipality before it became a city. == History == === Early history === The town was then called by its native Gaddang settlers as Bolo during the pre- Spanish conquest era. It is one of the populous settlement during that period and site of the vast tobacco plantation in the region making it one of the most important economic areas in northern Luzon. === Spanish colonial era === Shortly after Juan de Salcedo conquered Northern Luzon in 1587, Gov. Rodrigo de Penalosa sent Capt. Pablo de Carreon to explore Cagayan Valley as well as to establish missions in towns. Among the Spanish missionaries who penetrated deeply into the region was P. Pedro Jimenez, who founded Ilagan. The town of Bolo was founded by the Dominicans in 1619 in honor of Saint Ferdinand of Castile. The old Bolo was situated in the western side of Cagayan River in what is known today as Barangay Naguilian-Baculod. The cultural shock brought by the dominating social and economic regulations introduced by the Spanish authorities propelled the natives to dissent in the Mallig and Ilagan-Tumauini territories in what was known as the Gaddang Revolution. The natives abandoned their settlement after burning their church and houses until 1622 when the Spanish government pardoned and exempted them from paying tribute within three years. After the Gaddang revolt, the natives re-established their settlement upon the efforts of Fr. Pedro Jimenez in 1678 on the east side of the river thereby giving the legendary name for Ilagan which is the reverse of the word Nagali meaning \"transfer\". The Dominicans accepted the settlement as an ecclesiastical mission given the name San Fernando de Ilagan in honor of its patron, Saint Ferdinand of Castile. On May 4, 1686, Ilagan was founded and missionaries converted the natives to Christianity. Ilagan was made the capital of Cagayan Valley when Brig. Manuel Sanchez Mira was then the governor of the whole territory. Ilagan was the scene of the 1763 revolt in Isabela led by Dabo and Marayag against the collection of tribute, the enforcement of tobacco monopoly committed by the friars during the Spanish occupation. Upon the separation of Isabela on May 1, 1856, Ilagan became the capital of the province. === American colonial era === On August 4, 1901 the American occupation under the United States-Philippine Commission has enacted the Provincial Government Act 210 that has re-established Isabela and other provinces in the Philippines. Rafael Maramag, a former municipal president (mayor) of Ilagan was appointed as the first governor. The act then re- established Ilagan as the provincial capital. On November 13, 1925, Gaffud has approved a resolution filed by all \"Municipal Presidents of the Isabela\" (the counterpart of the present-day Mayors' League) following a four-day convention. The resolution called for the erection of a monument in honor of the country's National Hero Jos\u00e9 Rizal in the old Ilagan public plaza in Barangay Bagumbayan. By the turn of the 1950s the new Poblacion was located uphill from the old Saint Ferdinand Parish Church (formerly known as Saint Ferdinand Cathedral in Barangay Bagumbayan) to Barangay San Vicente; site of the current City Hall. ===Martial law === When Ferdinand Marcos' September 1972 declaration of Martial Law began a 14 year period of authoritarian rule, the province of Isabela - including Ilagan - became a center of both conflict and protest when Marcos crony Danding Cojuangco and his associate Antonio Carag managed to block a Spanish-era grant which was supposed to see the return of Hacienda San Antonio and Hacienda Santa Isabel in Ilagan to local farmers. Cojuangco and Carag purchased the two haciendas themselves, displacing tens of thousands of farmers who were supposed to get those lands back a hundred years after the Spanish acquired them. In its desire to serve its parishioners, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan hosted a Social Action Center which would help the farmers. In the Social Action Center's newsletter, the \"Courier,\" researcher Sabino Padilla Jr. documented and exposed the ways by which Cojuangco, Carag, the provincial government and the military harassed the farmers who were supposed to get the land. This all led to a protest march in joined by 12,000 protesters from all over Isabela, and eventually, for 4,000 farmers to finally get the titles to their land. But it also earned the ire of the administration. In 1982, Padilla and 12 others were arrested by the regime and jailed under poor conditions at the Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya Stockade of the Philippine Constabulary until almost the end of the Marcos regime. In 1983, soldiers went as far as to raid the residence of the Bishop of Ilagan, Miguel Purugganan, in search of alleged rebels and firearms. They found none, but continued to keep Bishop Puruggananan and the church workers under him under military surveillance. === Incorporation as a city === Ilagan has attempted to gain cityhood status at least five times in its history: *During the Spanish colonization period, Ilagan applied to gain cityhood status from the Spanish Government but was unsuccessful. Ilagan could have been the second city of the Philippines after Nueva Segovia, now Lal-Lo, Cagayan. *During the administration of then Mayor Paguirigan, but was shelved during the American occupation. *On February 2, 1998, congress passed Republic Act No. 8474 which sought to convert Ilagan into a city. But the plebiscite held on March 14, 1999 turned down its bid for cityhood under the administration of then Mayor Uy. The majority of the people voted no in that event. *During the administration of then Mayor Albano, Ilagan's cityhood status did not push through when the mayor was gunned down by three unidentified men in the night of June 27, 2006 in Quezon City. Mayor Albano used the term C-U-DAD Ilagan for campaigning the cityhood status of Ilagan. *In 2012, led by then Isabela 1st District Representative Rodolfo Albano Sr., renewed its bid for its cityhood. Local officials of the town headed by then Mayor Josemarie Diaz, expressed support for the town's conversion into a city. On May 22, 2012, the congress approved the cityhood bill of Ilagan on its House Resolution No. 144 and was signed by then President Benigno Aquino III. Plebiscite was held on August 11, 2012, with a majority of votes voting \"yes\". By virtue of Republic Act 10169, Ilagan was then proclaimed as a new component city, the third in the province of Isabela and the fourth in Cagayan Valley on the same day by COMELEC Commissioner Armando Velasco.ILAGAN KICKS OFF CITYHOOD BID Manila Bulletin.

Hectares of forest land are strictly protected by authorities like the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), several NGOs and the Local Government Unit. === Climate === == Demographics == In the , the population of Ilagan, was people, with a density of . The rapid increase of population in Ilagan is attributed to the current growth of economic activities specially in the sectors of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Housing. Ilagan is one of the 145 emerging cities in the Philippines with more than 100,000 residents. Statistics from the Philippine Statistics Authority show that Ilagan had a population 131,24311 in 2007, which increased to 135,174 people in the 2010 census making Ilagan as the most populous city in the province of Isabela and the second in Cagayan Valley after Tuguegarao. === Religion === Ilagan's population is predominantly Roman Catholic.

There are also Protestants, Baptist, Church of Christ, Adventists, Born Again groups, Victory Christian Fellowship, Latter Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, Islam, and Philippine-based groups like Iglesia Ni Cristo and Ang Dating Daan that accounts to the city's population. These religious organizations have their own temples and churches sparsely located in the city. Some Ilague\u00f1os were converted to Islam where their mosque is found in Barangay Baligatan. == Economy == Agriculture and fishery remains to be the main backbone of Ilagan's economy. There are almost 23,803 hectares that are basically cultivated land and 314 hectares are utilized for fish culture. However, the suitable farm area of Ilagan is 32,153.19 hectares potentials for crops, livestock and fish production. This figure shows that a significant percentage (24.99%) is not being fully utilized for agricultural production leaving them idle and under utilized. Commerce and trade is the second economic based income of the people of Ilagan. In the year 2006, statistics showed that there are currently 1,795 registered business establishments. For year 2000, commercial trade was at 1,996 revealing that there were more or less than 201 establishments that had been closed down within the period 2000\u20132006. There were even more establishments in 1995 with a total of 1,877 in all. The trend shows that from 1995 to 2000, there was a growth of 2.94%, but from 2000 to 2006 a decreasing growth rate of -1.75% was registered. Just like the past years, for the year 2006, commercial activities within the municipality are classified into wholesale, retail and service-oriented businesses. The industrial sector of the municipal economy comprises 210 establishments in year 2006 as compared with 207 in 2000. This reflects a 2.4% increase in industrial activities over a period of six years (2000\u20132006). The existing industries are mostly on a micro scale except for the Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. located in Barangay Guinatan which is the only significant employment generator within the locality at that time. Following the previous year's trend, industries currently operating are agro-industries, wood-based manufacturing or service- oriented industries. The commercial area includes areas which are occupied by public markets, wholesale and retail stores, restaurants, banks, shops and other establishments or structures engaged in commercial activities. The bulk of those who are engaged in trade and commerce are found in the public markets. The area covered by the commercial area is approximately 90.56 hectares or 2.62% of the urban core. As compared to the 2000 existing commercial area of 17 hectares, the increase of 73.56 hectares in 2007 is an indication that Ilagan is racing towards commercialization. The transformation of Ilagan into a fast growing municipality in Cagayan Valley became evident upon the assumption in office of then Mayor Josemarie L. Diaz, the re- structuring of the economic landscape of the municipality and the eventual transformation of its business climate into a business friendly environment successfully lured multi-national companies in investing their capitals into its market. Economic boom began to ingulf Ilagan with the entry of eight (8) banks and financial institutions in just a number of months. The Local Government of Ilagan responded positively with these developments by the enactment of legislative measures including the provision of the Investment Incentive Code which provided for tax incentives to investments. These measures eventually opened the flood gates for big investments to enter the local market that included the establishments of malls like the Northstar Mall and Talavera Square Mall that house the Savemore, Robinsons Supermarket, Puregold, Jollibee, McDonald's, Red Ribbon, Goldilocks, Mang Inasal, Greenwich, Chowking and many other stores. At present, Ilagan has one of the fastest-growing economy in the province of Isabela as well as in the whole Cagayan Valley over the past years. The city is the primary growth center and investment hub of the Cagayan Valley region due to the rapid commercialization and stabilization of the different sectors involved in its economy. It has two major public markets which is the old Pamilihang Bayan ng Ilagan located in Centro Poblacion (now called Xentro Market) and the multi-million pesos New Ilagan Public Market Complex in Barangay Baligatan. In front of the public market is a three-storey structure called as Ilagan City Mall, the first LGU- owned and operated mall in the city. The increasing number of market goers coming from the different regions of the city and adjacent municipalities, prompted city officials to facilitate the construction of the modern market. Ilagan is home to eighteen (18) banks which is primarily composed of universal, commercial, savings and rural banks. There are also thousands of commercial establishments composed of distributors, retail and wholesale. Pawnshops, lending companies, insurance agencies, cooperatives and other financial institutions are spread all over the city. === Food and beverage === There are several food and beverage companies in the city.

These barangays were dubbed as \"Butaka City\" of Ilagan, where the Guinness Book of Records' entry for the biggest lounge chair in the world, the Butaka, was manufactured. === Tobacco industry === Ilagan became one of the largest producers of tobacco during the Spanish time. The Tobacco Monopoly have caused the valley to languish in poverty from 1785 to 1797. The lifting of the monopoly was caused by the heavy loss incurred by the government. A Royal Decree released in 1882 totally abolished the monopoly and attracted foreign capitalist to invest in the country. In Ilagan, the Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas or the Tabacalera was established in 1881 and produced the famous La FLor de Isabela which was the largest company of its kind in the world at that time. The Tabacalera acquired two haciendas in Ilagan: the Hacienda San Antonio and Hacienda Santa Isabela. === Agri-support activities === At present, most of the industries in the city are agri-based. For the past ten years, there has been a great number of local investment in poultry and hog raising. At present, there are seven poultry contract growers and 33 small and medium scale hog raisers in Ilagan. Other support facilities, warehouses and small rice mills, strategically located in different barangays of Ilagan address the storage needs of farmers during the harvest season. === Jeep and tricycle body building === There are 9 motor vehicle assembly shops in Ilagan; 5 jeepney assembly shops and 4 tricycle side-car makers. These motor vehicle assembly shops respond to the increasing need for transportation service in the city. == Culture == Ilague\u00f1os today reflects a combination of indigenous, Chinese and Hispanic descent. The core community was composed of tribes notably the Agta, Ibanag, Gaddang, Yogad, and Kalinga which mirrors the habitation of the Philippines believed to have started 26,000 years ago with various strains of Aetas, then Indonesians coming 5,000 years ago and the Malays in droves starting of Aetas, then Indonesians coming 5,000 years ago and the Malays in droves starting 200 years B.C. up to 1500 A.D. Trade and cultural relations with Chinese preceded the 16th century incursion of the Spaniards. Ilocanos who already developed their own distinct traits were recorded to have migrated massively in the 19th century owing to the accessibility of the land and vast opportunities in the area straddling from the present day provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya. It was proclaimed a province by a Royal Decree and Named Isabela de Luzon on the first day of May in 1856. The present day Ilagan is an area that was detached from the old province of Nueva Vizcaya. The first municipal president of the town, Rafael Maramag, added luster to the history of his hometown by becoming the first governor of the province of Isabela after its reorganization by the Americans in 1901. Since then, the fortunes of Isabela as a province and Ilagan as a town followed a similar path to the rest of the country's history as a commonwealth nation and as a free republic in 1942, the Japanese occupation, liberation, political and military independence to this day. Ilagan today, acknowledged as the corn capital of the country lives its economic boom while playing a vital contributory role for the province of Isabela as its capital since its creation as a province.

On-going road constructions are the Ilagan-Divilacan road and the Ilagan-Delfin Albano-Mallig Road which are expected to be completed in five years and the former later this year 2013. Ilagan's longest bridge is the Malalam Bridge in Barangay Malalam going north. ==== Baculud Overflow Bridge ==== In 2014, the city government inaugurated the Baculud Overflow Bridge that connects the poblacion area to the northeastern barangays going to Tuguegarao. However, in 2016, the structure was damaged by flood brought by the torrential rain when Typhoon Haima or locally known as Super Typhoon Lawin struck the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan. The authorities had to close the bridge until the completion of its rehabilition which began in 2017.

It is expected to connect the city's western barangays and nearby municipalities of Delfin Albano and Tumauini. Before the construction of the new bridge, residents have to use barges to transport agricultural products to the market. With its completion, residents would no longer have to pay barge fees, and travel time between barangays on either side of the river has been cut short drastically. The bridge in Santa Maria (Cabiseria 8) was completed and opened to the public in 2015. Road concreting and widening, creation of diversion and circumferencial roads and farm to market roads were prioritized by the national and city government to help mobilize the transportation goods and delivery of basic services within the city's jurisdiction and neighboring municipalities. ==== Ilagan-Divilacan Road ==== The construction of an 82-kilometer Ilagan-Divilacan Road through the protected Sierra Madre mountains is on-going to open access to the coastal towns of Divilacan, Palanan and Maconacon.
