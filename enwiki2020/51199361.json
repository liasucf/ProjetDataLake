    "text": "The Dog Stars is a post-apocalyptic fiction novel by Peter Heller. Set in Colorado, a man lives a lonesome existence in an airplane hangar with his dog and dour gunman he has befriended. When a mysterious transmission comes through on the radio while he\u2019s flying his old Cessna, it sparks a hunt for the provenance of the sound. ==Reception== NPR described the novel as crackerjack and said \"With its soulful hero, macabre villains, tender (if thin) love story and action scenes staggered at perfectly spaced intervals, the story unfolds with the vigor of the film it will undoubtedly become. But it also succeeds as a dark, poetic and funny novel in its own right.\" https://www.npr.org/2012/08/07/157431750/dog-stars-dwells-on-the-upside-of- apocalypse The Boston Globe also had praise for the novel, stating, \"Peter Heller serves up an insightful account of physical, mental, and spiritual survival unfolded in dramatic and often lyrical prose, a difficult tale in which unexpected hope persistently flickers amid darkness.\" https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2012/08/15/review-book-the-dog-stars- peter-heller/UxjqQFMxrmfDxVMjbrtHYO/story.html ==References== Category:American post-apocalyptic novels Category:2012 American novels Category:Alfred A.
