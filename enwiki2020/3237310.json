    "text": "Ravinder \"Ravi\" Kahlon (born May 15, 1979 in Victoria, British Columbia) is a Canadian politician and field hockey player. Kahlon began playing field hockey as a defender in the Victoria League at age twelve; he was selected to the Junior National Team in 1999 and was named team captain. Kahlon was a student at Camosun College in Victoria, British Columbia at the time. He earned his first international senior cap for the Men's National Team in 2000 against Malaysia in Brussels. Eventually competing at every level of international competition, Kahlon's career would include playing three times in Hockey World Cup qualifying tournaments, representing Canada at the Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games, and a tenth-place finish at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In 2013, Kahlon was inducted into the Delta Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2016, Kahlon announced he would be running for office in the 2017 British Columbia provincial election with the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP). Kahlon won the NDP nomination in Delta North, an electoral district in Delta, British Columbia, a suburban city in Metro Vancouver. Delta North is considered a swing district, having been won three times each by the BC NDP and British Columbia Liberal Party in the six elections prior to 2017. When the election was held on May 9, 2017, Kahlon defeated Liberal incumbent Scott Hamilton by a margin of 9.14 percentage points. The 2017 British Columbia election resulted in a hung parliament, with no party controlling a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. However, the NDP was eventually able to form a minority government with the support of the Green Party of British Columbia. The NDP government was sworn in on July 18, 2017, with new Premier John Horgan naming Kahlon as Parliamentary Secretary for Sport and Multiculturalism. Kahlon supported eventual winner Jagmeet Singh for leader of the federal New Democratic Party in that party's 2017 leadership election. == Electoral record == ==International senior competitions== * 2000 \u2014 Olympic Games, Sydney (10th) * 2001 \u2014 World Cup Qualifier, Edinburgh (8th) * 2002 \u2014 Commonwealth Games, Manchester (6th) * 2003 \u2014 Pan American Games, Santo Domingo (2nd) * 2004 \u2014 Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Madrid (11th) * 2004 \u2014 Pan American Cup, London (2nd) * 2006 \u2014 Commonwealth Games, Melbourne (9th) * 2007 \u2014 Pan American Games, Rio de Janeiro (1st) * 2008 \u2014 Olympic Games, Beijing (10th) ==References== *Canadian Olympic Committee Category:1979 births Category:Canadian male field hockey players Category:Field hockey players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2007 Pan American Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Living people Category:Olympic field hockey players of Canada Category:Politicians from Victoria, British Columbia Category:Sportspeople from Victoria, British Columbia Category:Canadian people of Indian descent Category:Canadian people of Punjabi descent Category:Canadian Sikhs Category:Canadian sportsperson- politicians Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games medalists in field hockey Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Canada Category:Canadian sportspeople of Indian descent Category:British Columbia New Democratic Party MLAs Category:Canadian politicians of Indian descent ",
