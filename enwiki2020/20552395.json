That day, while escorting three Savoia-Marchetti SM.84, leading 10 MC.202s of 151\u00aa Squadriglia, Doglio fought with Spitfires from 249 and 185 Squadron. During a head-on attack, he hit the Spitfire BR377 of Flight Sergeant C.S.G. De Nancrede from Squadron 249, that had to crash-land on Ta 'Qali airfield, near Mdina.Cull with Galea 2004, p. 111. On the 6th, Doglio encountered again the Spitfires of 249 Squadron, while escorting three Cant.Z.1007 bis, and he claimed another Supermarine fighter, confirmed by his wingman Tarantola to crash north of Valletta, but the 249 that day had no losses, even if the Squadron had two aircraft shot up, one of them was flown by Sgt. Beurling, who three weeks later would kill Doglio in combat over Gozo. The following day, Niclot and seven other Macchi pilots were escorting for the first time the Ju 88A-4 of Kampfgeschwader 77. In the sky over Luqa, they clashed with seven Spitfires. Niclot and his wingman shot down the Spitfire of Flt. Sgt. D. Ferraby from Squadron 249 (AB500).

Six Spitfires of 126 Sq. attacked them head-on, while eight other Spitfires of the 249 Sq. attacked from left (\"10 hour direction\"). Niclot was preparing to counter-attack the Spitfires or 126 Sq. when his wingman, Sergente Ennio Tarantola, tried to warn his commander, waggling his wings, as Italian radios worked badly, of the Spitfires diving on them from the left, but Niclot understood that Tarantola was warning him of the Spitfires he had already spotted. Beurling's Spitfire VC in which he shot down Doglio, on 27 July 1942 Fl. Sgt. George \"Screwball\" Beurling, from 249 Sq., first scored hits on Sergente Faliero Gelli's aircraft, who later crash landed on Gozo, and soon after shot down Doglio's C.202 (MM 9042), who was waggling his wings to warn his fellow pilots of Spitfires closing \"head-on\". \"The poor devil simply blew to pieces in the air\", Beurling recalled the following year, writing the book Malta Spitfire, together with journalist Leslie Roberts.Beurling and Roberts 1944 Flight Sgt.
