It worked to free India from the British rule. This party, before fading away, was highly active in Punjab Province (British India) and left an impact on major cities of Punjab like Amritsar, Lahore, Sialkot, Multan, Ludhiana and Gurdaspur. The Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam,Samina Awan, Political islam in colonial Punjab Majlis-e-Ahrar 1929-1949 , P.153, Politics of Islamic symbolism, The MAI: Politics of Personalities, Oxford university Press was originally part of the failed Khilafat movement and emerged as a religio-political party after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 and the disintegration of the Khilafat movement in 1922. Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari presided over the meeting and Maulana Mazhar Ali Azhar delivered the manifesto of an All India Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam. It became first line offending party against Ahmadi Muslims by declaring that their objectives were to guide the Muslims of India on matters of nationalism as well as religion. Ahrar spearheaded the movement to have Ahmadi Muslims officially declared as non-Muslims.Samina Awan, Political Islam in colonial Punjab Majlis-e-Ahrar 1929-1949 , P.27, Politics of Islamic symbolism, The MAI: Politics of Personalities, Oxford university Press By the early 1930s, the Majlis-e-Ahrar- e-Islam (hereafter called Ahrars) had become an important political party of Muslims in the Punjab. The activists' agitation centered on the princely states, and was predicated on mobilisation around socio-religious issues. Besides these campaigns, the Ahrar also participated in the mainstream political developments of British India between 1931 and 1947. Its political career can be divided into two parts; the AHRAR\u2019s response to political and constitutional issues, and its performance in electoral politics.Samina Awan, Political Islam in colonial Punjab Majlis-e-Ahrar 1929-1949 , P.67, Politics of Islamic symbolism, The MAI: Politics of Personalities, Oxford university Press The Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam stood strongly against the partition of India, with its leader Afzal Haq stating that the \u201cPartition of India is, in fact, the cry of upper classes \u2026. It is not a communal demand as some people think but a stunt in order that the poor classes may not concentrate their thought and energies on all important questions of social and economic justice.\u201d It was a member of the All India Azad Muslim Conference, which gathered to show support for a united India. === Activism in Pakistan === In November 2012, the Government of Pakistan banned Abdul Latif Khalid Cheema, leader of Tehreek-e-Khatme Nabuwwat and Secretary General of Majlis-e-Ahrar-e- Islam, from delivering a speech in the Chichawatni and district Sahiwal area due to the security situation in Muharram. The president of Majlis-e-Ahrar Syed Ata-ul-Muhaimin Bukhari was also banned from delivering any speeches for three months in Multan. In Pakistan, the party opposed the Ahmadiyya Movement.The early champions of anti-Ahmadi cause Herald (Dawn Group of Newspapers), Published 3 November 2018, Retrieved 19 December 2018 This culminated in the 1953 Lahore riots; in 1954 Majlis-e-Ahrar was banned.
