    "text": "Alexandria Kostial was a 21-year-old University of Mississippi (ole miss) student who was found dead near a Mississippi lake in July 2019. A suspect, 22-year-old Brandon Theesfeld of Fort Worth, Texas, was arrested and charged with murder after Kostial's remains were discovered by a Lafayette County deputy. It was reported that Kostial had been shot multiple times. University of Mississippi student Rex Ravita, a former dorm neighbor of suspect Brandon Theesfeld, later described the suspected killer as misogynistic and arrogant, saying \"I'm not going to sugar coat it, he was pretty much a daddy's boy type. Constantly had to reference his father's money, how his dad could get him out of anything, just that attitude all the time. Any type of vulgar comment he could say, any type of rude comment to anybody in our dorm, any of the women.\" Ravita lived in the same dormitory as Theesfeld for a year and claimed Theesfeld and Kostial dated on and off again for about a year before her death. The funeral for Alexandria Kostial was held in a suburb of St. Louis in July 2019. ==References== Category:2019 controversies Category:2019 in Mississippi Category:2019 deaths Category:2019 crimes in the United States Category:2019 murders in the United States Category:Murdered American students ",
