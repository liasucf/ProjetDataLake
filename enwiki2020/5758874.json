It is sometimes also called Resavica or Resava (not to be confused with another Velika Morava's right tributary of Resava or its own tributary of Resavica). The Resav\u010dina originates near the village of Pro\u0161tinac in Svilajnac municipality. The river originally flows to the north, but soon turns west at the village of Dubnica and enters the western half of the Veliko Pomoravlje region. At the village of Ku\u0161iljevo, the river receives the small stream of Beljeva from the left and turns northward, which is the general direction of its course for the rest of the flow. The river flows parallel to the Velika Morava river as its satellite flow, in the Morava's floodplain, so there are no settlements on the Resavica itself, but several large villages are located in its valley (Porodin, \u017dabari, Simi\u0107evo, Aleksandrovac Po\u017eareva\u010dki, Vla\u0161ki Do, Poljana), all of them located on the Po\u017earevac-Svilajnac road, parallel to the river, but few kilometers to the east. At the dual village of Prugovo-Lu\u010dica, the southern suburbs of the town of Po\u017earevac, the Resav\u010dina turns west and empties into the Velika Morava near the horse stud farm of Ljubi\u010devo, one of two most famous in Serbia, just several kilometers southwest of the Po\u017earevac itself. The Resav\u010dina belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, drains an area of 174 km\u00b2, and it is not navigable. Category:Rivers of Serbia ",
