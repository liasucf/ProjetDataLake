    "text": "A V\u00e9ronique rocket being tested for launch in French Algeria V\u00e9ronique was a French liquid-fuelled sounding rocket that was partly developed by German scientists who had worked in Peenem\u00fcnde. Based on the German V-2 rocket, V\u00e9ronique was the first West European liquid-fuel research rocket. A successor to the cancelled Super V-2, the V\u00e9ronique was built between 1950 and 1969 in several versions, of which the versions P2, P6 and R were only experimental models. They were made in Vernon, Eure. The name Veronique is a portmanteau of Vernon-\u00e9lectronique, and is also a common French first name. The first V\u00e9ronique launch, on 20 February 1954, resulted in a launch failure, followed by a second launch a day later, on 21 February reaching in altitude with diesel oil and nitric acid as fuel. The second used turpentine instead of diesel oil, gaining 50% higher altitude. == See also == * Aggregat 8 * French space program ==References== Category:Sounding rockets of France Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 1950 Category:1950 in military history ",
