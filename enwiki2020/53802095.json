    "text": "William \"Mother\" Elliot , also known as Bill, (9 May 1867 \u2013 16 April 1958) was a New Zealand rugby union footballer who toured with the 1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team. Elliot was one of five P\u0101keh\u0101 (European) players in the predominantly M\u0101ori team, and his addition strengthened the side. Playing at half-back, he became one of the most prolific players on the tour, and appeared in at least 86 of their 107 matches in the British Isles, Australia and New Zealand. While on tour he played in all three of the internationals against England, Ireland, and Wales. When he returned from the tour he continued to play provincial rugby for Auckland, whom he represented from 1887 to 1896. Before he departed with the Natives he had twice represented Auckland against the touring British side, and had scored a try against them in the second match, a 4\u20130 victory for Auckland. He was initially selected for New Zealand for their 1893 tour of Australia, but was unable to secure leave from work. == See also == * List of 1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team matches == References == == Sources == * * * * Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:Rugby union players from Auckland Category:1867 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Auckland rugby union players Category:Rugby union halfbacks Category:M\u0101ori All Blacks players ",
