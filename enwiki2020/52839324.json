He also scored in the match against Thailand, making him the youngest ever international male goalscorer - a record which still stands. Since then, he has accumulated 13 international caps. ==Coaching career== Tun now works as the assistant manager for the Myanmar national under-20 football team. ==Career statistics== === International === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
