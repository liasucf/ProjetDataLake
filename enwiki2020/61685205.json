He graduated from the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University in 1955, and was assigned to work as an assistant to the renowned scholar Liang Sicheng at the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He helped Liang found the Architectural Theory and History Research Office, which became part of the Institute of Architectural Sciences after 1957. In 1973, Yang moved to the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on the invitation of director Xia Nai. There he established the program for architectural archaeology. He spent the rest of his career at the institute and was later promoted to associate professor and professor. He also taught as an adjunct professor at Fudan University, Tongji University, South China University of Technology, and National Taiwan University. Yang's research focus was the history and archaeology of architecture. In 2001, his Collection of Papers on Architectural Archaeology (\u5efa\u7b51\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u96c6, 1987) was voted by readers of the national academic newspaper China Cultural Relics News () as the best book on archaeology and museology of the 20th century.

The museum resembles the Chinese character yong (), meaning \"city wall\", in its ancient pictographic form of the oracle bone script (a square representing walls surrounded by four gateways). However, his design choice has been criticized for being too literal rather than figurative, thus limiting the design solution. He also designed the Longshan Culture Museum, which opened in 1994 at Chengziya, the type site of the Longshan culture, in Shandong. The museum is in the shape of a black bird, a sacred symbol of the culture. == References == Category:1931 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Chinese architectural historians Category:Chinese archaeologists Category:Scientists from Hebei Category:Historians from Hebei Category:Writers from Baoding Category:Tsinghua University alumni Category:Fudan University faculty Category:Tongji University faculty Category:South China University of Technology faculty Category:National Taiwan University faculty Category:Chinese architects Category:Museum designers ",
