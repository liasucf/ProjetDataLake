    "text": "Eta Ursae Minoris, Latinized from \u03b7 Ursae Minoris, is a yellow-white hued star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Minor. This is an F-type main-sequence star of stellar classification F5 V with an apparent magnitude of +4.95, making it faintly visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 33.63 mas as seen from the Earth, it is located 97 light years from the Sun. The star is moving closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of \u221211 km/s, and is traversing the sky with a relatively high proper motion of 0.271 arc seconds per year. Eta Ursae Minoris is about one billion years old and has an estimated 1.35 times the mass of the Sun. It has a high rate of spin with a projected rotational velocity of 84.8 km/s. These coordinates mark a source of X-ray emission with a luminosity of . Eta Ursae Minoris may form a wide binary system with a magnitude 15.3 companion star, located at an angular separation of 228.5 arc seconds. In some Arabic star charts it's labeled \u0627\u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u02bcanwar al-farqadayn, \"the brighter of the two calves\", and paired with \u03b6 Ursae Minoris as \u0627\u062e\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0646 akhf\u0101 al- farkadain \"the dimmer of the two calves\". The names may originally refer to a pair of Ibexes, and are more properly applied to \u03b2 UMi and \u03b3 UMi respectively, the brighter two stars in the rectangle of Ursa Minor. ==References== Category:F-type main-sequence stars Ursae Minoris, Eta Category:Ursa Minor (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects Ursae Minoris, 21 148048 079822 6116 ",
