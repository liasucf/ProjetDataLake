    "text": "The Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal (CGDSM) is a personal decoration of the United States Coast Guard that was established 4 August 1949. Prior to this date, members of the Coast Guard were eligible to receive the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. The medal is presented for, \"Exceptionally meritorious service to the government in a duty of great responsibility.\" The Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal, which replaced the Transportation Distinguished Service Medal in 2002, is another higher precedence Distinguished Service Medal that may be awarded to Coast Guardsmen. ==Criteria== The Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to any member of the U.S. Coast Guard who distinguishes themselves by exceptionally meritorious service to the United States Government in a duty of great responsibility. The exceptional performance of duty must be clearly above what is normally expected and must have contributed materially to the success of a major command or project. The decoration is typically awarded to senior flag officers, such as the Commandant of the Coast Guard. However, this does not preclude the award of the medal to any person who meets the eligibility requirements. The bestowing authority of the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal is the Secretary of Homeland Security. Prior to 2003, the award was authorized by the Secretary of Transportation, and prior to 1967, it was authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury. ===Devices=== Additional awards of the CGDSM are denoted by inch gold stars. ==Notable recipients== *Admiral Alfred C.
