The reconstruction began in 1992 and ended in 1999. On May 25, 2000, with the Bull \"Ad christifidelium spirituali\" Pope John Paul II erected the Diocese of Gospi\u0107-Senj, while bringing the church to the status of cathedral. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Croatia ==References== Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Croatia Category:Buildings and structures in Gospi\u0107 Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1783 Category:Buildings and structures in Lika-Senj County ",
