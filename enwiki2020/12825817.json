On the way to Leadville, Colorado she meets J.J. \"Leadville\" Johnny Brown, who falls in love with her and promises to give her whatever she wants (\"I'll Never Say No\"). After they marry, Johnny sells a claim and provides Molly with the money she wants, enough to enter the high social life in Denver (\"Beautiful People of Denver\"). Molly and Johnny, now dressed in gaudy finery, are made fun of by the Denver society people she wants to impress, and they travel to Europe, against Johnny's better instincts. The couple, and especially Molly, are welcomed and accepted by European royalty, but the attentions of Prince DeLong towards Molly upset Johnny and he returns to Leadville alone. Molly realizes that Johnny is her true love, and she sails for home on the RMS Titanic (\"Dolce Far Niente\"). As the Titanic sinks and the tragedy unfolds, Molly survives in one of the lifeboats. She finally is reunited with Johnny, who has built Molly her own \"castle,\" a beautiful home in the Rocky Mountains. ==Musical numbers== ;Act I *Overture\u2014Orchestra *I Ain't Down Yet\u2014Molly Tobin and Her Brothers *Belly Up to the Bar, Boys\u2014Molly Tobin, Christmas Morgan and the Miners *I've A'ready Started In\u2014Johnny \"Leadville\" Brown, Christmas Morgan, Charlie, Burt and Gitter *I'll Never Say No\u2014Johnny \"Leadville\" Brown *My Own Brass Bed\u2014Molly Tobin *The Denver Police\u2014Three Policemen *Beautiful People of Denver\u2014Molly Tobin *Are You Sure? -- Molly Tobin, Monsignor Ryan and Guests *I Ain't Down Yet (Reprise)-- Molly Tobin and Johnny \"Leadville\" Brown ;Act II *Happy Birthday, Mrs. J.
