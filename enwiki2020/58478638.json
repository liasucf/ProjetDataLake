He served in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom and was later diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. His book Fearvana was endorsed by the Dalai Lama and Jack Canfield. ==Early life and education== Nanavati was born in Bombay, India, on October 15, 1984. He has also lived in Bangalore, Singapore, Austin, and Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He did his Bachelors of Arts in History at Southwestern University. During his high school years at Westlake High School, he watched the film Black Hawk Down, which inspired him to join the United States Marine Corps. He currently lives in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. ==Career== After overcoming drug addiction, despite two doctors suggesting boot camp could kill him because of a blood disorder, he enlisted in the Marines. Nanavati was then sent to Haditha, Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was an infantry non- commissioned officer, where one of his jobs was to walk in front of vehicles to find improvised explosive devices and another as communications liaison. He later did his Masters of Arts in journalism from Syracuse University's S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. He eventually ended his tenure as a sergeant before graduating. He was also diagnosed by the Department of Veterans Affairs with post traumatic stress disorder and survivor's guilt, which led him to alcoholism and depression before realizing he was on the brink of suicide. As a result, this led him to research neuroscience, psychology and spirituality. While at base in Iraq, he started to run to cope with the stress of war. He then also decided to trek across every country in the world as a self-challenge. In addition to seeking to run across the world, he also discovered skydiving, mountain biking, scuba diving, rock climbing and ice climbing as \"anything that forced me to face my fears.\" He is also a public speaker. ==Fearvana== Nanavati in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
