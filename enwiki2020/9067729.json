The following year, they set up a photo studio in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. They had two children, Dorothea and Darius, Jr. In 1906, the couple moved to Seattle. Darius gave up studio work and focused instead on the lumber industry and scenic photography. Tabitha developed the negatives and made the prints, which were sent back to the logging camps and sold to the loggers. Darius used an 11\" X 14\" Empire State view camera with a custom made tripod that could extend twelve feet high. He used glass plates until 1914, when he switched to film. After falling from a stump in October, 1940, Darius was forced to give up photography. He spent the last five years of his life sorting and organizing his negatives. He died in 1945 and is buried with his wife in Nooksack. The major collection of his work is held by the Whatcom Museum in Bellingham, Washington. The University of Washington Libraries also has a collection of his work. Darius' brother Clark Kinsey was also a photographer of early 20th Century logging in Washington. == References == Category:1869 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Maryville, Missouri Category:People from Sedro-Woolley, Washington Category:Artists from Seattle Category:19th-century American photographers Category:People from Snoqualmie, Washington Category:20th-century American photographers Category:Photographers from Missouri Category:Photographers from Washington (state) ",
