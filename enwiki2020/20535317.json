Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2012-06-18 Its name is derived from the feminine form of the Latin word cruentus, which means \"stained with blood\" and is a reference to the red spots on its upper dorsum.Definition of cruentus from Wiktionary It was transferred to the genus Ardeadoris on the basis of DNA evidence.Johnson R.F. & Gosliner T.M. (2012) Traditional taxonomic groupings mask evolutionary history: A molecular phylogeny and new classification of the chromodorid nudibranchs. PLoS ONE 7(4): e33479 ==Distribution== This species was described from Osprey Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in the tropical Western Pacific Ocean. It has also been recorded from the Philippines, the Lembeh Strait in northern Sulawesi, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. This species of nudibranch is not common.Rudman, W.B., 2000 (October 25) Glossodoris cruenta Rudman, 1986. [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. ==Description== Ardeadoris cruenta, head towards the camera Ardeadoris cruenta has a pale-lemon colored body with a bright yellow and white lined frilly mantle and foot.
