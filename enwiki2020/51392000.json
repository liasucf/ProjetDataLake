    "text": "Morwong is a genus of fishes belonging to the family Latridae found in oceans off Australia and New Zealand. They were formerly included in the genus Cheilodactylus in family Cheilodactylidae, but based on genetic and morpological analyses they have been moved to genus Morwong in family Latridae.Ludt, W.B., Burridge, C.P. & Chakrabarty, P. (2019). A taxonomic revision of Cheilodactylidae and Latridae (Centrarchiformes: Cirrhitoidei) using morphological and genomic characters. Zootaxa 585(1). ==Systematics== Morwong fuscus resting on a sponge There are two recognized species in this genus: * Morwong ephippium \u2013 painted moki * Morwong fuscus \u2013 red morwong Although the red morwong has usually been assigned to Cheilodactylus, DNA studies published in the early 2000s recover Cheilodactylus fuscus as closer to Nemadactylus than to the Cheilodactylus type species. In the meantime, John E. Randall has recommended using the generic name Morwong for C. fuscus. In this case, Cheilodactylus ephippum would also become a referred species of Morwong, as M. ephippum, because Burridge and White (2000) and Burridge and Smolenski (2004) recover it as sister to the red morwong.Burridge, C.P., and White, R.W.G. 2000.
