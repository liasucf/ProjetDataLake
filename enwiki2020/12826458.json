He is the brother of former MLB catcher Tony Pe\u00f1a and the uncle of current Boston Red Sox minor league pitcher Tony Pe\u00f1a, Jr. ==Career== He was initially signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in , but was released prior to the start of the season. In 1984 he was signed by the Tigers, spending five seasons in their minor league organization before making his major league debut in . Since Ram\u00f3n was in the American League while Tony was playing for the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League, and since interleague play didn't begin until , the two brothers never played against each other in the major leagues. His career was much shorter and less successful than those of his two relatives. In eight career regular season games, had a lifetime earned run average of 6.00, allowing twelve earned runs in eighteen innings, as well as a WHIP of 1.89. Although he didn't earn a decision in any of his eight appearances, he didn't pitch a game in which his team earned the win. He made his major league debut on April 27, against the California Angels at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California. Pe\u00f1a surrendered three runs on seven hits in 2 innings in a relief appearance in a 10-3 Tigers loss.
