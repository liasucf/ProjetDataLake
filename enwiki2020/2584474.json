    "text": "I Love Trouble is a 1994 American romantic comedy/crime film starring Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte. It was written and produced by the husband-and-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, and directed by Shyer. == Plot == Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson are two rival Chicago newspaper reporters. Sabrina is young and ambitious, whereas Peter is a fading star and has just published his first novel. They reluctantly join forces to unravel the mystery behind a train derailment. They argue over almost everything but discover a conspiracy involving genetically altered milk. ==Cast== * Julia Roberts - Sabrina Peterson * Nick Nolte - Peter Brackett * Saul Rubinek - Sam Smotherman/Ernesto Vargas * James Rebhorn - The Thin Man * Robert Loggia - Matt Greenfield, Chronicle Editor * Kelly Rutherford - Kim * Olympia Dukakis - Jeannie, Peter's Secretary * Marsha Mason - Senator Gayle Robbins * Eugene Levy - Justice of the Peace * Charles Martin Smith - Rick Medwick * Dan Butler - Wilson Chess * Paul Gleason - Kenny Bacon * Jane Adams - Evans * Lisa Lu - Virginia Harvey * Nora Dunn - Lindy * Megan Cavanagh - Mrs. Delores Beekman ==Production== Nolte and Roberts notoriously did not get along with each other during the making of the film. Roberts has described him as \"disgusting,\" whereas Nolte has said she's \"not a nice person.\" ==Reception== The film grossed over $30 million in box-office receipts in the United States and less than $62 million worldwide. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 22% rating based on 46 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"There appears to be no Love lost between the fatally mismatched coupling of Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte in this screwball misfire that just isn't worth the Trouble.\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine wrote: \"The goings-on seem lacking in wit and inspiration, tolerably entertaining but far from effervescent.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"Maybe it would have been funnier if the evil cow conglomerate had been replaced by something sillier and more lightweight; it's hard to sustain a romantic comedy in the face of death threats.\" According to Nolte, it's the worst film he has ever appeared in. He felt he sold his soul by doing it, and he did it only for the money. As a result, he was tense while on the set, and did not have a good working- relationship with Julia Roberts. Roberts has on her part called Nolte the worst actor she has ever worked with.Nick Nolte - Biography TalkTalk == Year- end lists == * 6th worst \u2013 Peter Travers, Rolling Stone * Top 12 worst (Alphabetically ordered, not ranked) \u2013 David Elliott, The San Diego Union- Tribune *Dishonorable mention \u2013 Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News * Dishonorable mention \u2013 Dan Craft, The Pantagraph ==Music== Elmer Bernstein originally wrote the underscore, but his music was thrown out and David Newman called in at such a late stage that posters with Bernstein's name on the credits were already displayed. With only two weeks to rescore the film, Newman - who usually orchestrates the bulk of his scores himself - utilized a small army of orchestrators to help him complete the score: Scott Smalley, Chris Boardman, William Kidd, Peter Tomashek, Steven Bramson, Christopher Klatman, Don Davis, Joel Rosenbaum, Arthur Kempel (misspelt \"Kempl\" in the end credits), Mark McKenzie, Brad Warnaar (misspelt \"Warner\" in the end credits) and John Neufeld. The soundtrack album was released by Var\u00e8se Sarabande, including a cover version of the Smokey Robinson song \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\"; only Smalley and Boardman receive orchestrator credit on the album (however, Ross receives an acknowledgement - as does Alan Silvestri, who was also attached to the project). # Here's Peter (5:09) # Here's Sabrina (1:54) # Calling All Boggs (1:15) # Honeymoon Night (4:55) # Two Scoop Snoops (3:39) # Everybody Buys the Globe (:46) # Scoop de Jour (3:15) # Sabrina's Hip (1:04) # Wild Goose Chase (1:16) # The Beekman Agreement (2:02) # Keyhole Foreplay (1:20) # Happily Ever After (2:21) # \"I Love Trouble\" (3:43) # You've Really Got a Hold On Me - Robbyn Kirmsse (3:37) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1994 films Category:Films directed by Charles Shyer Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Shyer Category:1990s romantic comedy films Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films shot in Wisconsin Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Touchstone Pictures films Category:Caravan Pictures films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films with screenplays by Nancy Meyers Category:Films scored by David Newman Category:1994 comedy films ",
