The Cit\u00e9 internationale des arts was a Franco-Scandinavian idea proposed by the Finnish artist Eero Snellman (1890-1951) during a speech at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. It was only after the Second World War that this idea was taken up by Mr. and Mrs. F\u00e9lix Brunau and became a real project. It took the form of an association created in 1947 which benefited from the support of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Academy of Fine Arts and the City of Paris. It had its first headquarters at the Ministry of Culture on rue de Valois before moving to 18 rue de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville in the 4th arrondissement, the City of Paris having granted an emphyteutic lease for the construction of a set of live-work spaces.Cit\u00e9 internationale des arts on Le Parisien Opened 1956, Inaugurated in 1965, the Cit\u00e9 internationale des arts offers residency workshops known as \"living workshops\" () designed for work and housing, located at two main sites.
