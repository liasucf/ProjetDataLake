High Orchard was an industrial area of the city of Gloucester in England that was developed in the 19th century on the former orchard of the Priory of Llanthony Secunda (1136). The area was closely associated with Gloucester Docks immediately to the north, and served by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and railway transport. It was the site of Fielding & Platt's Atlas Works and a number of other significant local employers. It was centred on High Orchard Street which ran between Llanthony Road to the north and Baker Street to the south. To the west was Baker's Quay and to the east Southgate Street. Immediately south of Baker Street was the terminus of the High Orchard branch railway line. Most of the area is now the site of the Gloucester Quays shopping centre and associated buildings, with some original buildings surviving as part of the shopping centre and along the canal side. ==Early history== High Orchard was sited on the former orchard of the Priory of Llanthony Secunda,Medieval Gloucester: Topography.

Firms imported timber, prepared it for the building industry, and preserved it by kyanizing it or treating it with creosote. The flour-milling industry was present and flour-milling machinery was made at High Orchard Works (1851), while Atlas Works (1860) was the home of Fielding & Platt who made industrial machinery with a specialism in heavy-duty hydraulics. The cabinet makers J. A. Matthew & Co. built a large manufactory in 1894 that was destroyed by fire in 1912.Gloucester, 1835-1985: Economic development to 1914. British History Online.
