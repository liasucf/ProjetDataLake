He was joined by the mother-daughter tandem of Boots Anson-Roa (a former host of the original Student Canteen), Chiqui Roa-Puno (newscaster of PTV and one of the top female sportscasters at that time), Ernani \"Jong\" Cuenco, Pia Pilapil, Jojo Alejar, and actor-musician Paco Arespacochaga in the show. Some elements of Student Canteen were seen in the show, along with former contestants from \"Student Canteen\"'s singing portions who gamely sang and entertained audiences via the segment \"Student Canteen Corner\". The show ended on November 3, 2000 due to low ratings and was replaced by Lunch Break, produced by the controversial Mateo Management Group. ==See also== * List of programs previously broadcast by Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation Category:Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation original programming Category:Philippine variety television shows Category:1999 Philippine television series debuts Category:2000 Philippine television series endings Category:Filipino-language television shows ",
