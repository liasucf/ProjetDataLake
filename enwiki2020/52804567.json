    "text": "Reluciente, Rechinante y Aterciopelado is the first live album by Colombian band Aterciopelados. It was recorded before a live audience of 140 guests in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, on June 2, 2015 and released as a CD and DVD on April 22, 2016. Directed by Roberto de Zubir\u00eda and produced by Rafael Arcaurte the album includes featured performances by Le\u00f3n Larregui, Spanish singer Macaco, Goyo (ChocQuibTown) and Catalina Garc\u00eda (Monsieur Perine). The proposal to record a concert film came from Sony Music Colombia after the band's comeback concert at Rock al Parque 2014. After almost two months of rehearsals the concert was recorded. The album contains songs from their previous albums El Dorado, La Pipa de la Paz, Caribe At\u00f3mico and Gozo Poderoso as well as songs from solo projects by the members of the band. As of July 2017, the DVD has been certified Gold in Colombia, denoting 5,000 copies sold. ==Recording and scenery== The musical pre-production was carried out in Tigo Music Studios by Audiovisi\u00f3n, the studio where the band recorded some of their most well-known works. The concert took place in RTI studios, which was illuminated with lamps made out of 810 bottles of detergent and softeners, a large velvet heart, a tree made of tires and plastic caps, and CDs that served as a framework on the steps. Juan Garces was in charge of the scenery. The recording consisted of two sessions totaling approximately three hours. The first, beginning with Baracunatana, included El Estuche, El \u00c1lbum and Rompecabezas. They then go ahead into a couple solo songs, Soy La Semilla Nativa from Ni\u00f1os Cristal by Buitrago and Yo, one of the most glittering hits from the album Dos by Echeverri. The second session contains an unreleased track called Re which is a tribute to the Mexican band Caf\u00e9 Tacuba. It consists of sets of words with the \"Re\" syllable and a Norte\u00f1o melody. For the interpretation of Maligno, Le\u00f3n Larregui of the band Zo\u00e9 and Colombian bandoneon player Giovanni Parra were invited to perform with them. Bolero Falaz, Luz Azul with Spanish singer Macaco and Florecita Rockera with Goyo of ChocQuibTown and Catalina Garcia of Monsieur Perine closed off this block. At the end, La Estaca was performed as a gift to the public, however it is not included in any format of the release. ==Track listing== ==Certifications== ==Personnel== ;Musicians * Andrea Echeverri: vocals, rhythm guitar * H\u00e9ctor Buitrago: bass, backing vocals * Gregorio Merch\u00e1n: drums * Leonardo Castiblanco: guitar * Natalia Pazos: percussion and chorus * Catalina \u00c1vila: percussion and chorus ;Additional musicians * Marco Antonio Farinango: winds * Giovanni Parra: bandoneon * Le\u00f3n Larregui: vocals and chorus * Macaco: vocals and chorus * Goyo: vocals and chorus * Catalina Garc\u00eda: vocals and chorus ;Recording personnel * Rafael Arcaute: producer * Rafa Sardina: mixing * Paula P\u00e9rez: wardrobe * Roberto de Zubir\u00eda: film director * Roberto Le\u00f3n: film technical team * Mauricio Pardo: film technical team ;Artwork * Art Direction: Beatriz Leal and Juan Garc\u00e9s * Design and diagrams: Andrea Hermida and La Post * Illustration: Andrea Hermida, Andrea Echeverri, Juan Andr\u00e9s Moreno, Santiago Uribe, La Post * Photography: Juan Andr\u00e9s Moreno, Giancarlo Barco ==References== ==External links== Category:2016 compilation albums Category:Aterciopelados albums ",
