    "text": "The Magic Garden is the second album by American pop group the 5th Dimension, released in 1967 (see 1967 in music). Considered a concept album, it tells the story of a couple's love and the end of their relationship. In more recent discussions of the album, that love affair is said to be about Jimmy Webb \u2014 who authored 10 of the album's 11 tracks \u2014 and his time with singer and then- girlfriend Susan Horton (In fact, the name Susan is referenced specifically on the track \"Dreams/Pax/Nepenthe\"). The only non-Jimmy Webb song on the album, \"Ticket to Ride\", is an unused track from the group's first album, Up, Up and Away. Following the success of Up, Up and Away, which spawned two Top-20 singles on the Billboard Pop Chart, expectations were high for The Magic Garden. However, the album just missed the Billboard Hot 100, and no Top 20 singles would emerge from it in the US. The first single, \"Paper Cup\", rose only to #34. \"Carpet Man\", the album's second single, landed at #29 in the US, but found great success in Canada, charting at #3 on Toronto's CHUM chart, and #11 on the RPM chart, in March 1968. The group performed the song on Kraft Music Hall (on an episode hosted by John Davidson) and the Ed Sullivan Show. ==The Worst That Could Happen== One of the album's cuts, \"The Worst That Could Happen\", was released as a single by the Brooklyn Bridge in December 1968, charting top 40 on Billboard in January and becoming a top 3 hit in the US. The 5th Dimension would have to wait for their next album, Stoned Soul Picnic, to achieve the same chart placement. To capitalize on the success of \"The Worst That Could Happen\", Soul City Records re-released The Magic Garden as The Worst That Could Happen. The re-release reverses the front and back covers of the original LP. The vinyl label still carried The Magic Garden as its title. The original Magic Garden album was released in both mono (SCM-91001) and stereo (SCS-92001). It is unknown whether its reissue as The Worst That Could Happen was also reissued in mono, as Soul City's parent company, Liberty Records (and most other record labels) began phasing out monaural releases in the US in 1968: stereo copies keep its original matrix number on Soul City / Liberty, SCS-92001. The album, retitled \"The Worst That Could Happen\". The front cover is an image originally used on the back cover of The Magic Garden. ==Track listing== All songs were written by Jimmy Webb, except where noted. ;Side one #\"Prologue\" \u2013 1:24 #\"The Magic Garden\" \u2013 2:48 #\"Summer's Daughter\" \u2013 3:03 #\"Dreams/Pax/Nepenthe\" \u2013 3:24 #\"Carpet Man\" \u2013 3:16 #\"Ticket to Ride\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) \u2013 4:00 ;Side two # * \"Requiem: 820 Latham\" \u2013 4:26 #\"The Girls' Song\" \u2013 4:09 #\"The Worst That Could Happen\" \u2013 2:37 #\"Orange Air\" \u2013 2:38 #\"Paper Cup\" \u2013 2:48 #\"Epilogue\" \u2013 :56 ==Personnel== ;Performers * Billy Davis, Jr. \u2013 lead vocals (track 9), background vocals * Florence LaRue \u2013 lead vocals (tracks 5, 8), background vocals * Marilyn McCoo \u2013 lead vocals (track 8), background vocals * Lamonte McLemore \u2013 background vocals * Ron Townson \u2013 background vocals * Jimmy Webb \u2013 orchestra conductor The credited musicians (roles not specified) are Hal Blaine, Joe Osborn, Larry Knechtel, Mike Deasy, Tommy Tedesco, Dennis Budimir and Johnny Rivers. ;Production * Jimmy Webb \u2013 music arranger * Bones Howe \u2013 producer, engineer * Armin Steiner \u2013 engineer * Elliot Federman \u2013 audio mastering * Mandana Eidgah \u2013 product manager * Rob Santos \u2013 reissue producer * Mike Hartry \u2013 digital transfers * Joanne Feltman \u2013 archives coordinator * Glenn Korman \u2013 archives coordinator * Woody Woodward \u2013 art director * Mathieu Bitton \u2013 reissue art director * Ron Wolin \u2013 design * Wayne Kimbell \u2013 illustrations * Ed Osborne \u2013 photography * George Rodriguez \u2013 photography * Mike Ragogna \u2013 liner notes ==Charts== ===Album=== Billboard (North America) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position |- |1968 |Black Albums |43 |- |1968 |Pop Albums |105 |- |} ===Singles=== Billboard (North America) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |1967 |\"Paper Cup\" |Pop Singles |34 |- |1968 |\"Carpet Man\" |Pop Singles |29 |- |1970 |\"The Girls'Song\" |Pop Singles |43 |- |} ==Cultural impact== \"Carpet Man\" has been covered by the Nocturnes, the Charade, the Parking Lot, and by the founder of the 5th Dimension's Soul City record label, Johnny Rivers.
