Iserbyt's father and grandfather were Yale University graduates and members of the Skull and Bones secret society. == Career == Iserbyt served as the senior policy advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of Education, during the first term of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Iserbyt later came across a federally-funded grant entitled Better Education Skills through Technology (Project BEST), part of which was headed \"What we (U.S. Dept. of Education) can control and manipulate at the local level\". After leaking this document to Human Events, she was removed from her post in the Department of Education. She later served as a staff employee of the U.S. Department of State (South Africa, Belgium, South Korea). Iserbyt was scheduled to do a briefing for officials of the Brazilian government in 2019 regarding her book which was just translated into Portuguese but her trip was cancelled when she fell and broke her hip and femur the week before. == Publications == She is known for writing the book The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America. The book alleges that changes gradually brought into the American public education system work to eliminate the influences of a child's parents, and mold the child into a member of the proletariat in preparation for a socialist-collectivist world of the future. She considers that these changes originated from plans formulated primarily by the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education and Rockefeller General Education Board, and details the psychological methods used to implement and effect the changes. She also wrote Back to Basics Reform, which documents her experiences working in the U.S. Dept. of Education, where she was privy to past and future plans to restructure American education. == Personal life == In 1964, Iserbyt married Jan Iserbyt (2 May 1929 \u2013 5 May 2008); they had two sons.
