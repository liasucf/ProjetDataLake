They returned to Siam in 1913 with four Nieuport monoplanes and four Breguet biplanes. An aerodrome constructed at Don Mueang and the army aviation units moved there on 17 March 1914. On 27 March 1914 the unit became the Army Air Corps. Since then, 27 March has been observed as the birthday of the Royal Thai Air Force. In 1918, the Army Air Corps gained the status of a division consisting of three wings. It remained under the army until December 1921 when it was renamed the Air Division and was placed directly under the Ministry of War. The Air Division's name changed again in 1935 to the Air Force Division. In 1937 it was proclaimed the Royal Thai Air Force. In 1967 the Army Aviation School was founded, and the Army Aviation Center was created on 20 September 1977. ==Mission== * Planning, directing, and practicing And study about Operation of the Royal Thai Army. * Conduct research Develop, define principles and make texts in science associated. * Ruling the military units that the Ministry of Defense requires The commander of the Army Aviation Center is responsible for. ==Organization== * Royal Thai Army Aviation Center Headquarters ** Royal Thai Army Aviation Regiment *** Light Aviation Company *** 1st Air Mobility Company *** 2nd Air Mobility Company *** 3rd Air Mobility Company *** 9th Air Mobility Company *** 21th Aviation Battlion *** 41st Aviation Battlion ** Science Division ** Service Division ** Airport Division ** Aviation Communications Division ** Aviation Safety Division ** Disease examination unit ** Army Aviation School ** Department of Aviation ** Aviation Base Defense Battalion ** Aviation Communication Support Division ===Aircraft=== The Royal Thai Army is known to operate the following aircraft types: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\" |- ! style=\"width:9%;\"| Photo ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Model ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Type ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Origin ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Quantity !Notes |- ! style=\"align: centre; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Helicopters |- | 120px || Bell AH-1F Huey Cobra || Attack helicopter || ||7|| Will replace by Boeing AH-6.
