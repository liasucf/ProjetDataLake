    "text": "1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours is a collection of early recordings by American rock band Green Day, released on October 1, 1991 by Lookout Records. Often erroneously referred to as the band's debut album, the compilation combines the band's actual debut 39/Smooth and its first two extended plays Slappy and 1,000 Hours, which are all currently out of print, hence its name being an amalgamation of the album and the two EPs. The album included one cover, \"Knowledge\" (originally from the Slappy EP), which was originally by influential California punk band Operation Ivy, whose singer, Jesse Michaels, contributed the artwork for the album. The cover art features the same image from 39/Smooth. Lookout! re-released the album in 2004 with special limited packaging and all new enhanced CD-ROM features, including live performances and pictures. The album was re-issued in the same packaging in 2007 through Reprise Records after Green Day pulled the album in August 2005, as well as all of its other material released through the label, from Lookout! due to unpaid royalties. The album has been certified Gold in the U.S. by the RIAA, and according to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold 632,000 copies in the U.S. as of August 2010. The album was certified Gold in the UK on July 22, 2013, representing sales of at least 100,000. It has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. ==Release== Initially released in 1991 through Lookout! Records (despite the 1990 copyright date on the album), the label re-issued the album in a remastered form in 2004. It was re-released on CD on January 9, 2007, by Reprise Records, the label Green Day has been signed to since leaving Lookout!. In Europe, the album was already re-released by Epitaph Europe, and has remained in print. It was reissued on vinyl on March 24, 2009, by Reprise in a package containing the original 10-song 39/Smooth LP along with reissues of the 1,000 Hours and Slappy EPs. On the 2009 reissues, the song \"I Want to Be Alone\" is omitted. ==Reception== Reviews of 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours were largely mixed; for example, The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars. Brad of Punknews.org gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \"All in all, this album succeeds at being quite good. It shows obvious influences from the Clash and the Ramones, and is a good debut for a young band that would later change the course of Punk Rock forever by opening the floodgates for New School bands.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Green Day * Billie Joe Armstrong \u2013 lead vocals, guitar * Mike Dirnt \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals * John Kiffmeyer \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals Additional performers * Aaron Cometbus \u2013 backing vocals, \"teeth\" on \"Knowledge\" Production * Andy Ernst \u2013 producer, engineer * Green Day \u2013 producers * John Golden \u2013 mastering * Susie Grant \u2013 front cover photo * Jesse Michaels \u2013 artwork * Pat Hynes \u2013 artwork, graphic design, layout design * Chris Appelgren; Aaron Cometbus; Rich Gargano; David Hayes \u2013 artwork * Murray Bowles; Arica Pelino \u2013 photography * Ted Jensen \u2013 remastering * John Yates \u2013 packaging ==References== ==External links== *1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:Green Day compilation albums Category:1991 compilation albums Category:Lookout!
