    "text": "Lapa, originally named Km 7, is a train station on CPTM Line 8-Diamond, located in the district of Lapa in S\u00e3o Paulo. ==History== Footbridge above the station platforms. With the arrival of the railways of S\u00e3o Paulo Railway in 1867 and Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana in 1875 to the region of Lapa, the English railway implanted the first station in the neighbourhood. Because of that, Sorocabana couldn't build their station, due to legal affairs. Therefore, Sorocabana had to wait until the end of the SPR concession to build their station. In 1951, a small post was implemented to help the Lapa Tendal. At the time, the then City Councillor Nicolau Tuma suggested the construction of a new unified Lapa Station, being the first of many suggestion that would be presented in the following decades. With the demand growth, a new building was built and opened on 1 June 1958, with the name of Km 7. However the construction works were only finished in 1961. In the end of the 1970s, the old station was demolished, giving place for a new station, built by Christian-Nielsen Engenheiros e Construtores, hired by FEPASA and reopened on 6 July 1985. The station, along with the entire line, was transferred to CPTM, which operates it since then. ===Projects=== Due to the existence of two Lapa stations, separated for and without connection with each other, two project to unify the stations were made: * In 1978, S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Company projected the west expansion of the East-West Line with Pompeia station and the terminus in Lapa station, which would be rebuilt, with connection from the Metro to the FEPASA and RFFSA commuter train lines, and would count with a bus terminal attached to it. Because of the lack of funds, the project was cancelled, and the line had its terminus in Barra Funda station. * In 2010, CPTM hired, along with Una Arquitetos, a project to unify Lapa stations. The project was influenced by the project of the burial of Lapa-Br\u00e1s branch. It hasn't been executed yet. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1958 ",
