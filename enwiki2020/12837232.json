On 12 February 1814 she took part with HMS Caledonia in a hot action against the French line-of-battle ship Romulus off Toulon; the French 74 managed to escape to Toulon by sailing close to the coast to avoid being surrounded. With the 1817 changes to the rating system Boyne was rerated as a 104-gun first rate ship. On 23 November 1824, Boyne was driven ashore at Portsmouth during a gale. In 1826 she was cut down (razeed) to become a two-deck, 76-gun third-rate ship of the line. On 1 December 1834 she was renamed HMS Excellent and became a training ship. On 22 November 1859 she was renamed HMS Queen Charlotte and paid off the following month before being broken up from December 1861.
