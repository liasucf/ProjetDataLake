Hsu completed her bachelor's and master's degrees, both in law, at National Chengchi University. She then pursued doctoral studies at the University of Freiburg. Upon her return to Taiwan, Hsu began teaching law at Tunghai University, then joined the faculty of National Chengchi University. In 2003, President Chen Shui-bian nominated Hsu to the Council of Grand Justices. She was confirmed by the Legislative Yuan and took office on 3 October 2003. Hsu authored Constitutional Interpretation No. 666, issued by the court on 6 November 2009 regarding the penalization of prosecution, which opined in part that selling sexual services was a matter of free choice of profession, which is a right protected by the Constitution.
