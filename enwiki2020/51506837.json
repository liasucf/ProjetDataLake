Includes the prior defined local supercluster, the Virgo Supercluster, as an appendage. **** Virgo Supercluster - one of the approximately 10 million superclusters in the observable universe. It spans 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years), and contains at least 100 galaxy groups and clusters, including the Local Group. ***** Local Group - specific galaxy group that includes the Milky Way and at least 53 other galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. ****** Milky Way Galaxy - a specific barred spiral galaxy ******* Orion Arm - a spiral arm of the Milky Way ******** Solar System - the Sun and the objects that orbit it, including 8 planets, the 3rd planet closest to the Sun being Earth ********* Earth's orbit - path through which the Earth travels around the Sun. The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is 149.60 million kilometers (92.96 million miles). == Movement of the Earth == * Earth's orbit * Earth's rotation * Earth's precession == Features of Earth == * Age of the Earth * Figure of the Earth (size and shape) * Earth radius * Models of the Earth ** Globe ** World map ** Gravity of Earth ** Earth's magnetic field ** Natural environment ===Earth's spheres=== ====Atmosphere of Earth==== ==== Earth's biosphere ==== * Ecosystems * Biomes * biogeographic realms * Marine realms * Bioregions * Ecoregions (list) * Anthroposphere * Noosphere ==== Earth's geosphere ==== * Structure of the Earth * Earth's surface * Lithosphere of Earth (solid Earth) * Earth's crust * Land * Landforms (list) * Continents * Africa * Antarctica * Asia * Australia * Europe * North America * South America * Pedosphere * Ocean floor * Earth's mantle * Earth's core * Outer core * Inner core ==== Earth's hydrosphere ==== This sphere represents all water on Earth, wherever it is and in whatever form within the water cycle. * Water, by relative altitude ===== Atmospheric water ===== * Water vapor * Clouds * Precipitation ===== Cryosphere (frozen water) ===== * Polar ice caps * Ice sheets * Ice caps * Glaciers ===== Surface water ===== * Bodies of water (list) * World Ocean * Southern Ocean * Oceans - This includes the Earth's 5 oceans: The Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. * Groundwater ===== Water, by salt content ===== * Fresh water * Brackish water * Seawater === Astronomical events on Earth === * Meteor showers (list) * Meteorite falls * Tides * Eclipse - This includes both a lunar eclipse and solar eclipse. * Equinox - This includes both the March equinox and the September equinox. * Solstice - This includes the Summer solstice, June solstice, Winter solstice, and December solstice * Manhattanhenge === Natural satellites of Earth === * Moon == History of Earth == History of Earth * Age of the Earth * Geocentric model * Geological history of Earth ** Geologic time scale ** Early Earth * Timeline of natural history * History of the world == Future of Earth == Future of Earth * Climate change * Global catastrophic risk == See also == * Earth and atmospheric sciences journals * Earth phase * Earth sciences ** List of fields of science that study the Earth * Geoscience organizations * List of environmental organizations * Outline of the Solar System * World ==References== == External links == * National Geographic encyclopedic entry about Earth * Earth \u2013 Profile \u2013 Solar System Exploration \u2013 NASA * Earth \u2013 Climate Changes Cause Shape to Change \u2013 NASA * United States Geological Survey \u2013 USGS * Earth \u2013 Astronaut Photography Gateway \u2013 NASA * Earth Observatory \u2013 NASA * Earth \u2013 Audio (29:28) \u2013 Cain/Gay \u2013 Astronomy Cast (2007) * Earth \u2013 Videos \u2013 International Space Station: ** Video (01:02) \u2013 Earth (time-lapse) ** Video (00:27) \u2013 Earth and Auroras (time-lapse) Earth Earth * ",
