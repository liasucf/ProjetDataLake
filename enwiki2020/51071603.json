    "text": "An Anthology of Australian Verse (1907) is an anthology of poems edited by Australian critic Bertram Stevens. The editor notes in his introduction that the book is \"A selection of published and previously unpublished verse\" representative of the best short poems written by Australians or inspired by Australian scenery and conditions of life, - 'Australian' in this connection being used to include New Zealand.'Austlit - An Anthology of Australian Verse by Bertram Stevens ==Critical reception== A reviewer in The Leader noted that the anthology \"will be gratefully received by those who are willing to acknowledge that there are sweet strains worth remembrance among the vast volume of minor poetry. If a critical judgment may cavil at the inclusion of some who have been awarded this distinction, the plea may be urged that we know not the mass of rejection.\" And concluded \"On the whole, the work of selection has been well done, and the editor may be complimented on the discretion and critical taste he has displayed. \"\"Australian Verse\", The Leader, 27 October 1906, p31 In The Western Mail a reviewer was unequivocal: \"This is perhaps the most serious effort that has yet been made to compile an anthology of Australian poetry, and not until many years shall have passed, and a greater store of poetic material shall have been acquired, will the publication be superseded. It is beyond doubt the best of its kind that has yet appeared, and for this result the able editor deserves more than a passing word of thanks. The best writers are, so far as it is possible to average the general taste, represented by their best work, and most poems that have earned a justified popular favour, have, where length has permitted, been included.\"\"Books and Magazines\", The Western Mail, 17 November 1906, p50 ==Contents== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" |----- | valign=\"top\" | * William Charles Wentworth ** \"Australasia\" * Charles Harpur ** \"Love\" ** \"Words\" ** \"A Coast View\" *William Forster ** \"The Love in Her Eyes Lay Sleeping\" * James Lionel Michael ** \"Through Pleasant Paths'\" ** \"Personality\" * Daniel Henry Deniehy ** \"Love in a Cottage\" ** \"A Song for the Night\" * Robert Richardson ** \"Superstites Rosae\" * Richard Rowe ** \"Soul Ferry\" * Sir Henry Parkes ** \"The Buried Chief\" * Thomas Alexander Browne (\"Rolf Boldrewood\") ** \"Perdita\" * Adam Lindsay Gordon ** \"A Dedication\" ** \"Thora's Song\" ** \"The Sick Stockrider\" * Henry Kendall ** \"Prefatory Sonnets: I\" ** \"Prefatory Sonnets: II\" ** \"September in Australia\" ** \"Rose Lorraine\" ** \"To a Mountain\" ** \"Araluen\" ** \"After Many Years\" ** \"Hy-Brasil\" ** \"Outre Mer\" * Marcus Clarke ** \"The Song of Tigilau\" * Patrick Moloney ** \"Melbourne\" * Alfred Domett ** \"An Invitation\" ** \"A Maori Girl's Song\" * James Brunton Stephens ** \"The Dominion of Australia\" ** \"The Dark Companion\" ** \"Day\" ** \"Night\" * Thomas Bracken ** \"Not Understood\" ** \"Spirit of Song\" * Ada Cambridge ** \"What of the Night?\" ** \"Good-Bye\" ** \"The Virgin Martyr\" ** \"Honour\" ** \"Despair\" ** \"Faith\" | valign=\"top\" | * Alexander Bathgate ** \"The Clematis\" * Philip Joseph Holdsworth ** \"Quis Separabit?\" ** \"My Queen of Dreams\" * Mary Hannay Foott ** \"Where the Pelican Builds\" ** \"New Country\" ** \"No Message\" ** \"Happy Days\" * Henry Lea Twisleton ** \"To a Cabbage Rose\" * Mrs. James Glenny Wilson ** \"Fairyland\" ** \"A Winter Daybreak\" ** \"The Lark's Song\" * Edward Booth Loughran ** \"Dead Leaves\" ** \"Isolation\" ** \"Ishmonie\" * John Liddell Kelly ** \"Immortality\" ** \"Heredity\" * Robert Richardson ** \"A Ballade of Wattle Blossom\" ** \"A Song\" * James Lister Cuthbertson ** \"Australia Federata\" ** \"At Cape Schanck\" ** \"Wattle and Myrtle\" ** \"The Australian Sunrise\" * John Farrell ** \"Australia to England\" * Arthur Patchett Martin ** \"Bushland\" * Douglas Sladen ** \"Under the Wattle\" * Victor Daley ** \"Players\" ** \"Anna\" ** \"The Night Ride\" * Alice Werner ** \"Bannerman of Dandenong: An Australian Ballad\" * Ethel Castilla ** \"An Australian Girl\" ** \"A Song of Sydney\" * Francis Adams ** \"Something\" ** \"Gordon's Grave\" ** \"To A.
