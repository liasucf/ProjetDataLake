It was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on 6 November 1999, between and with 72,500 in attendance. Australia won the game by 35 points to 12, and with it, their second World Cup, having also won the 1991 tournament in England. ==Match summary== ===First half=== In front of a capacity crowd of 72,500 at the recently completed Millennium Stadium, Australia met France in the fourth Rugby World Cup Final. For both teams it was their second Final. Australia were resilient in defence throughout the tournament while France promised an attacking back line full of talent. In damp and cold conditions France took an early lead with a Christophe Lamaison penalty after just two minutes. Penalty kicking would be the story of the day and Matt Burke equalled the scores after four minutes with a successful kick. The Australian forwards dominated in the loose and their tactic of continually kicking for territory and position proved effective. Lamaison offered some respite by slotting a 12th-minute penalty to give France a 6\u20133 lead. Injury and the subsequent substitution of Olivier Magne disrupted the France back row line-up after 20 minutes. Matt Burke, however, showed imperious accuracy as time and again French exuberance in the loose was penalised. By half-time the Australians led 12\u20136 with all points from the two talented goal kickers. ===Second half=== As with the first half Burke and Lamaison traded penalty goals. After an hour the contest was still in the balance with the score at 18\u201312 to Australia. France continued to look lacklustre as the Wallabies began to mount a series of attacks. A Burke penalty after 64 minutes put Australia more than one score in front, and theoretically clear. With only 15 minutes remaining Ben Tune crashed over for the first try of the contest with Burke again adding the conversion points. A further infringement and yet another Burke penalty seemed to have won the game for Australia. The last action of the final was a rolling forward surge and try for Australian second-half substitute Owen Finegan. Inevitably Matt Burke slotted the conversion. Referee Andr\u00e9 Watson called time on the contest with Australia emphatic winners 35\u201312. Again the final was hardly a classic match, though the modern approach of effective defensive lines and an outstanding goal kicking display proved to be rewarded. Australia were rewarded for their efforts with a second World Cup win and captain John Eales accepted the Webb Ellis Cup from Queen Elizabeth. ==Match details== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |FB ||15||Matt Burke |- |RW ||14||Ben Tune |- |OC ||13||Dan Herbert || || |- |IC ||12||Tim Horan || || |- |LW ||11||Joe Roff |- |FH ||10||Stephen Larkham |- |SH ||9 ||George Gregan || || |- |N8 ||8 ||Toutai Kefu |- |OF ||7 ||David Wilson |- |BF ||6 ||Matt Cockbain || || |- |RL ||5 ||John Eales (c) |- |LL ||4 ||David Giffin |- |TP ||3 ||Andrew Blades |- |HK ||2 ||Michael Foley || || |- |LP ||1 ||Richard Harry |- |colspan=3|Replacements: |- |CE ||16||Nathan Grey || || |- |CE ||17||Jason Little || || |- |SH ||18||Chris Whitaker || || |- |FL ||19||Owen Finegan || || |- |LK ||20||Mark Connors |- |PR ||21||Dan Crowley |- |HK ||22||Jeremy Paul || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Rod McQueen |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |FB ||15||Xavier Garbajosa || || |- |RW ||14||Philippe Bernat-Salles |- |OC ||13||Richard Dourthe || || |- |IC ||12||\u00c9mile Ntamack |- |LW ||11||Christophe Dominici |- |FH ||10||Christophe Lamaison |- |SH ||9 ||Fabien Galthi\u00e9 || || |- |N8 ||8 ||Christophe Juillet || || |- |OF ||7 ||Olivier Magne |- |BF ||6 ||Marc Lievremont || || |- |RL ||5 ||Fabien Pelous |- |LL ||4 ||Abdelatif Benazzi |- |TP ||3 ||Franck Tournaire |- |HK ||2 ||Raphael Ibanez (c) || || |- |LP ||1 ||Cedric Soulette || || |- |colspan=3|Replacements: |- |FB ||16||Ugo Mola || || |- |FH ||17||Stephane Glas || || |- |SH ||18||St\u00e9phane Castaign\u00e8de || || |- |FL ||19||Arnaud Costes || || |- |LK ||20||Olivier Brouzet || || |- |PR ||21||Pieter de Villiers || || |- |HK ||22||Marc Dal Maso || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Jean-Claude Skrela |} |} ==References== Final 1999 Category:Sports competitions in Cardiff Category:1999 in Australian rugby union Category:1999\u20132000 in French rugby union Category:1990s in Cardiff Category:Australia national rugby union team matches Category:France national rugby union team matches Category:History of rugby union matches between Australia and France Category:November 1999 sports events in the United Kingdom ",
