The brand achieved significant popularity in the 1960s due to the endorsement of the Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. Products manufactured by Ludwig include drum kits and hardware. The company also commercialises other percussion instruments (from the Musser Mallet Company acquired in 1965) such as marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones and bar chimes through its parent company Conn-Selmer.Mallet instruments on Conn-Selmer websiteOur brands on Conn-Selmer website, 11 Nov 2019 == History == The Ludwig Drum Company was established in 1909 by William F. & Theobald Ludwig, sons of a German immigrant to the United States. William Jr. had been a professional drummer, playing with circuses and touring vaudeville shows, along with the occasional skating-rink gig. Since this work was irregular, he and his brother, Theobald, opened a drum shop in Chicago; they called it Ludwig & Ludwig. The company started with a concept for the design and manufacture of a functional bass drum pedal. The company added new products to its catalog, such as snare drums and timpani, in 1916. In 1917, Ludwig signed a deal to build rope drums to support World War I. Theobald Ludwig died in 1918, and William continued on his own. By 1923, the factory was the largest drum manufacturer in the world, employing 240 workers. In the late 1920s, the company was sold to the C.G. Conn instrument company. William Ludwig stayed on to run the company for Conn (which also owned the Leedy Drum Co. at this time). Eventually, William Ludwig decided to leave Conn and start a new company of his own. He was unable to use the Ludwig name since that trademark now belonged to Conn who continued to market Ludwig & Ludwig drums. In 1937, William bought a factory building and started The WFL Drum Company (his initials). The company continued producing drums at a small scale for the duration of World War II, but William got back to the idea of making the company a large drum manufacturer after the armistice. WFL was a competitor with Ludwig and Ludwig. Conn combined their two drum brands into one in the early 1950s, forming Leedy & Ludwig, and then decided to quit the drum business altogether. In 1955, William and his son Bill Jr. were able to buy the Ludwig trademark back from Conn, and over the next few years their company and its products transitioned from the WFL brand to being called \"Ludwig\" again. Despite initial success, Ludwig's global breakthrough would occur February 9, 1964, when The Beatles made their historic American TV debut on The Ed Sullivan Show.\"The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964\" on Ed Sullivan website\"The Beatles\u2019 first Ed Sullivan Show\" on The Beatles Bible The Ludwig logo, displayed on the front of Ringo Starr's bass drum, could be seen by the television audience of about seventy-three million people.\"The 1960s\" at Vintage Ludwig Drums\"The origins of Ludwig drums\" on The Chicago Reader As it happens, Starr chose that brand upon joining the band simply because he liked the oyster pearl black color of the drum kit he chose. The publicity resulted in Ludwig's sales doubling quickly to $13 million, which prompted production to increase to a 24/7 production as the company became the foremost drum manufacturer in North America for twenty years. Ludwig acquired the \"Musser Mallet Company\", a manufacturer of xylophones, marimbas and vibraphones, in 1965. Ludwig was a strong presence in the marching drum market. Their drums along with their Slingerland rivals. During the 1970s, Ludwig's \u201cChallenger\u201d line of snare drums offered sophisticated tuning and strong build quality. Ludwig drums were used by many leading drum and bugle corp. On 4 November 1981, William F Ludwig II sold the business to the Selmer Company (now Conn-Selmer). Selmer closed the Damen Avenue factory in the ensuing years and moved the drum production business to Monroe, North Carolina, in 1984.Selmer's History, 7 Dec 2011 In 2002, Ludwig merged with Conn-Selmer, becoming a brand of Conn-Selmer, Inc..About: 2000-2009 on Ludwig website The Musser manufacturing facility remained in LaGrange, Illinois, until 2013, and was then moved to Elkhart, Indiana. == Artists == Some of the musicians that currently or previously played Ludwigs include:Artists on Ludwig website\"A Century of the most famous names\" on Ludwig website *Richard \"Pistol\" Allen (The Funk Brothers) *Jerry Allison (Buddy Holly & The Crickets) *Carmine Appice\"Carmine Appice, an exclusive interview\", Glide Magazine, 8 Jul 2013 *Mick Avory (The Kinks) *Ginger Baker *Derek Ballard (A Band Called O) *Danny Barcelona (Louie Armstrong) *Barriemore Barlow (Jethro Tull) *Carlton Barrett (Bob Marley & The Wailers) *Frank Beard (ZZ Top) *Fred Below *Pete Best *Hal Blaine *Jason Bonham *John Bonham (Led Zeppelin)Drum set up on John Bonham website\"10 Ways To Sound Like John Bonham\" by John Natellion Drum Magazine, Nov 2008 *Cindy Blackman (Lenny Kravitz) *Don Brewer (Grand Funk Railroad) *Bill Bruford (Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, Earthworks) *Tony Buck *Clive Bunker (Jethro Tull) *Clive Burr (Iron Maiden) *Larry Bunker *Jim Capaldi (Traffic) *Eric Carr (KISS) *Nameless Ghoul (Ghost) *Luis Cardenas (Renegade) *Bun E.
