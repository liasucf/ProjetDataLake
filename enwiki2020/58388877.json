    "text": "Kenneth Davies (20 September 1923 \u2013 14 November 2008) was an English professional footballer who played as a winger in the Football League for Walsall and Brighton & Hove Albion. ==Life and career== Davies was born in Doncaster, West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1923. He played junior football along with Billy Woodcock, brother of Bruce who would become British Heavyweight Boxing Champion and continued in the position of Centre Forward at Oswin Avenue School. He qualified at Doncaster Plant works as a coppersmith working on such legendary engines as The Silver Link, The Flying Scotsman and The Mallard. As war loomed this would become reserved occupation so Kenneth was never enlisted. Kenneth played football for the plant team and after one of the games was approached by Mr. Mark Crook offering the opportunity to become a professional footballer. He joined Wath Wanderers and spent time at the nursery club before playing for the parent club Wolverhampton Wanderers in wartime football 1944\u201346. He scored his first goal playing against Aston Villa at Villa Park playing alongside the great Billy Wright. He moved on to Walsall of the Third Division South ahead of the 1946\u201347 Football League season for a \u00a3600 fee. He scored 5 goals from 28 league appearances over two seasons, and then moved on to another Southern Section club, Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a3250 fee, where he played 38 league matches over two years, again scoring 5 goals. Together with three Brighton teammates, Eric Lancelotte, Fred Leamon and Jock Sim, he signed for Chippenham Town in 1950. He helped Chippenham win the 1951\u201352 Western League title, finish as runners-up three years later, and was still with them in the 1956\u201357 season.
