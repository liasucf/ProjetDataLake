The Embassy is situated in Chanakyapuri, the diplomatic enclave of New Delhi, where most of the embassies in India are located. The Embassy is also responsible for the Swedish honorary consulates in India, located in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai, and also the diplomatic relationship with Nepal and Maldives. The Ambassador of New Delhi is also accredited to Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives. ==History== The Embassy building was inaugurated in November 1959 in the presence of the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. The embassy building was designed by Swedish architects Sune Lindstr\u00f6m and J\u00f6ran Curman. The 40,000 square meters of greenspace surrounding the embassy was landscaped by Walter Bauer. Once the embassy building, including the Ambassador's residence reception rooms, staff housing and recreational areas were completed, it was formally handed over to the first Swedish Ambassador Alva Myrdal. The Swedish organization SIDA moved into a new extension in the Embassy area in 1988-89. The National Property Board Sweden replaced the windows and doors in the accommodation buildings in 2005-06. In 2009, the Swedish trade council got new, larger offices and separate entrance in the Embassy area. == References == Category:Diplomatic missions of Sweden Category:Diplomatic missions in New Delhi Category:India\u2013Sweden relations ",
