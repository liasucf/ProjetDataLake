Paterson went to the Mayo Clinic for a fellowship in radiology. He received further training in radiotherapy at clinics at the University of Chicago, in Toronto and South Africa. He returned in 1930 to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh as acting director of the radiotherapy department. In 1931, Paterson was appointed as radiotherapy director of the recently combined Holt Radium Institute and Christie Hospital in Manchester. Edith Paterson began her research at the Holt institute without position or salary. She in time developed her own reputation as a researcher. In November 1943, Paterson and his wife were invited by the government of Australia including Queensland and Victoria to assist with the establishment of a cancer institute that would provide medical care and services to the community. The Australian government allocated \u00a3100,000 for an institute dedicated to cancer treatment and research, with treatment methodologies to focus on X-ray and Radium.McKell, W.J.

Paterson retired in 1962 and he and his wife devoted their efforts to the running of a cattle and sheep farm at Stenreishill, near Moffat, Scotland. He died at home in his sleep.Lewis, Nancy R.
