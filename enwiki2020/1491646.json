    "text": "The Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) is a division of the American Library Association, and it is the world's largest organization dedicated to library service to children. Its members are concerned with creating a better future for children through libraries. ALSC's membership is composed of more than 4,000 members, including children's and youth librarians, children's literature experts, publishers, education and library school faculty members, and other adults dedicated to library services for youth. ALSC has nearly 60 active committees and task forces carrying out the work of the Association, including developing programs for youth and continuing education; publishing resources and journals for youth librarians; and evaluating and awarding media for children. ALSC sets a standard for library service to children through the regular updating of Competencies for Librarians Serving Children in Public Libraries. The most recent competencies, adopted in 2015, emphasize seven core areas of competency that include services, programs, outreach, collection development, and administrative practices that contribute to quality library service for youth. ==Major Initiatives== The Association of Library Service to Children supports five major initiatives focused on continuing education for children's librarians; enhanced library services and programming for children aged 0\u201314 years; and collaboration with other agencies serving youth. ===El D\u00eda de los Ni\u00f1os/El D\u00eda de los Libros (Children's Day/Book Day) === El d\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os/El d\u00eda de los libros (Children's Day/Book Day), commonly known as D\u00eda or Diversity in Action, is an ongoing celebration of children, families, and reading that culminates yearly on April 30. D\u00eda was created by author/illustrator Pat Mora in collaboration with REFORMA. ===Babies Need Words Every Day=== As part of their commitment to bridging the 30 million word gap, ALSC created colorful posters and booklists designed to be hung in accessible public spaces, such as bathroom changing tables and on buses, to inform parents of ways to read, talk, sing, and play with their babies. Posters are available to print for free in both English and Spanish. ===Every Child Ready to Read\u00ae @ your library\u00ae=== Every Child Ready to Read\u00ae @ your library\u00ae, commonly abbreviated as ECRR, is a parent education program designed by ALSC and the Public Library Association. The initiative focuses on the development of early literacy skills in children ages 0\u20135. Many storytimes and other early childhood programs in libraries across the world incorporate research and practices from ECRR. The ECRR toolkit is designed to help librarians teach parents that early literacy begins at home and is taught by parents. The toolkit was revised in 2011. ===Media mentorship=== In 2015, the ALSC Board accepted a white paper titled \"Media Mentorship in Libraries Serving Youth.\" This paper outlines the role of librarians and other library staff who serve youth and families with particular regard to materials and practices surrounding digital media. ===Everyday Advocacy=== In recognition that libraries must advocate for their patrons and themselves within their communities, Everyday Advocacy provides resources and training materials to empower library workers to take action in a grassroots effort to build awareness of and support for the library. ALSC continually advocates for the support and enhancement of library services to children and those who provide it by encouraging practitioners to speak out within their communities to promote the value of those services. The division also partners with other agencies that serve children to spread the word about the power of reading, early literacy, and youth services. == Awards, Grants, & Scholarships == ===Book and Media Awards=== ALSC announces the awards listed below every January at a Monday morning press conference that takes place during the American Library Association Midwinter Meeting. * The Newbery Medal was named for eighteenth-century British bookseller John Newbery.
