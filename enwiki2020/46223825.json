The Ducks were led by sixth year head coach Dana Altman. They played their home games at Matthew Knight Arena and were members of the Pac\u201312 Conference. They finished the season 31\u20137, 14\u20134 in Pac-12 play to win the Pac-12 regular season championship. They defeated Washington, Arizona and Utah to be champions of the Pac-12 Tournament. They received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament where they defeated Holy Cross, Saint Joseph's, and Duke to advance to the Elite Eight where they lost to Oklahoma. ==Previous season== The 2014\u201315 Oregon Ducks finished the season with an overall record of 26\u201310, and 13\u20135 in the Pac-12. In the Pac\u201312 Tournament, the Ducks made it to the Championship game where they lost to Arizona, 52\u201380. They received an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament as an 8-seed in the West Region. They defeated Oklahoma State in the second round before losing to Wisconsin in the round of 32. ==Off-season== ===Departures=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" ! Name !! Number !!

In the Quebec educational system, students complete high school a year earlier than in the rest of North America, and normally attend a pre-university school known as a CEGEP. After Boucher's final year of high school in 2010\u201311, he did not academically qualify for CEGEP, and was out of school in 2011\u201312 before attending a prep school in Alma, Quebec for 2012\u201313 and playing 13 games in that season (considerably fewer that a typical U.S. prep school schedule). The NCAA initially treated the end of his final year of high school as his graduation date and his prep school year as his first year of college competition. Oregon applied for a waiver from the NCAA, citing serious family hardship during Boucher's high school years, the abbreviated nature of his prep school basketball season, and his satisfactory academic progress at Oregon. ==Schedule== |- !colspan=6 style=\"background:#004F27; color:yellow;\"| Exhibition |- !colspan=6 style=\"background:#004F27; color:yellow;\"| Non- conference regular season |- !colspan=6 style=\"background:#004F27; color:yellow;\"| Pac-12 regular season |- !colspan=6 style=\"background:#004F27; color:yellow;\"| Pac-12 Tournament |- !colspan=6 style=\"background:#004F27; color:yellow;\"| NCAA Tournament ==Ranking movement== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;text-align:center;\" |+ Ranking movement Legend: \u2588\u2588 Increase in ranking. \u2588\u2588 Decrease in ranking. \u2588\u2588 Not ranked the previous week.
