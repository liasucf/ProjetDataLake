This building is made of red sandstone. This is a three-story building. The people believe that soil and stone have been used in the past and it was constructed by a person named Matia and named after it was Matia Mahal. But to study the structure inside it, it is known that the building was a horse of the fortress of horses here. The texture is similar to the horse. Here also the signs of binding elephants are clearly visible. The main door is very high but the entrance door is also high so that elephants can get out of comfort.
