Bezaleel had arrived in South Australia from England aboard Thomas Lowry in December 1848; Eliza arrived on Eden June 1838 with her widowed mother Elizabeth Merritt. He was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, then joined his father's mercantile brokerage business, which he and his brother George Gollin (1860 \u2013 July 1946) took over on their father's death. George shortly left for London, to manage business at that end. At first Gollin & Co. ran its operations from offices in the Widows' Fund Building, Grenfell Street, then in 1897 moved to larger premises in the Brookman Building, also on Grenfell Street. Around the same time W. J. Gollin left for Sydney and with a Liverpool cousin founded a Sydney branch. In 1889 a Melbourne branch was founded, and in 1901 the company was restructured as Gollin & Co., Proprietary Limited, with its headquarters from 1902 at 561\u2013563 Bourke Street, Melbourne, with branches in Sydney, Adelaide and London, later Brisbane, Perth, and four major cities in New Zealand. The Melbourne headquarters was a five-storey building designed by Charles D'Ebro and built by Clements Langford.

By 1927 it had 200 agencies around the world. A wide variety of commodities was traded: from importing Michelin tyres, oil and kerosene to export of fruit from Mildura to England. W. J. Gollin lived in London for much of his later life, and retired from business around 1925. The company became a subsidiary of Gollin Holdings Limited, incorporated in Victoria on 30 August 1957. The company went into liquidation on 30 June 1976. ==Family== Gollin married Adelaide Rachel \"Ada\" Raphael (7 August 1857 \u2013 17 November 1929) on 12 November 1879.
