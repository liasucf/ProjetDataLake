Color&Co; enables consumers to consult one-on-one with an independent colorist via live video, and creates personalized at-home hair coloring kits based on the colorist's guidance and the consumer's preferences. ==Background== Color&Co; was founded independently in 2017 by a collective of colorists and tech engineers from L\u2019Oreal Research and Innovation. It was developed within L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Technology Incubator. Color&Co; launched online in May 2019. Consumers complete a questionnaire to select their hair color or consult with an independent colorist via real-time video chat. Based on the results of the questionnaire, or the outcome of the consultation, Color&Co; selects a base color, and adjusts the depth and tone of the shade to create a \"Colorbox\" which is shipped to the consumer. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 establishments in New York City Category:L'Or\u00e9al brands Category:Hair care products ",
