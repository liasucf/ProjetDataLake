    "text": "The Real Thing is a live album by Midnight Oil, and includes a cover version of Russell Morris's classic \"The Real Thing\". It was initially issued in Australia with a bonus disk of interview material listed as containing 2 tracks (\"Interview\" and \"Track by track\") but the CD was divided into 30 tracks, dividing the interview up so that past albums and each track on \"The Real Thing\" gets a short discussion followed by snippet from the album or song being discussed. Later international releases had a bonus disk with videos of \"Cemetery In My Mind\" and \"Redneck Wonderland\". ==Track listing== # \"The Real Thing\" (Johnny Young) # \"Say Your Prayers\" (Moginie) # \"Spirit of the Age\" (Garrett, Moginie) # \"Feeding Frenzy\" (Garrett, Moginie) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"Tell Me the Truth\" (Garrett, Moginie) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"The Dead Heart\" (Garrett, Hirst, Moginie) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"Tin-legs and Tin Mines\" (Garrett, Gifford, Moginie, Rotsey) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"Short Memory\" (Garrett, Hirst, Moginie) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"In the Valley\" (Garrett, Hirst, Moginie) \u2013 Sony Studios NYC (April 1993) for MTV Unplugged # \"Blue Sky Mine\" (Garrett, Hillman, Hirst, Moginie, Rotsey) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"US Forces\" (Garrett, Moginie) \u2013 The Metro Theatre, Sydney (October 1994) # \"Warakurna\" (Moginie) \u2013 Sony Studios NYC (April 1993) for MTV Unplugged # \"Truganini\" (Hirst, Moginie) \u2013 Sony Studios NYC (April 1993) for MTV Unplugged # \"The Last of the Diggers\" (Hirst) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000) !scope=\"col\"| Position |- |- |} ==Personnel== ===Midnight Oil=== *Peter Garrett - lead vocals *Bones Hillman - bass, vocals *Rob Hirst - drums, vocals *Jim Moginie - guitars, keyboards *Martin Rotsey - guitars ===Additional personnel=== *Chris Abrahams - piano, organ *Stewart Kirwan - trumpet *Andrew Bickers - tenor saxophone *Anthony Kable - trombone *Basheri - percussion *Sunil de Silva - percussion *Charlie McMahon - Didgeridoo ==References== Category:Midnight Oil live albums Category:2000 live albums ",
