    "text": "The 1973\u201374 Virginia Squires season was the 4th season of the Squires in the American Basketball Association. The team finished 6th in points scored at 106.3 points per game and 9th in points allowed at 111.3 points per game. The team was 15\u201327 midway through the season, but they went 13\u201329 in the second half of the season. Their biggest losing streak was 6 games, with their highest winning streak being 3 games, done twice. Despite this, they clinched the fourth and final playoff spot by 7 games. The Squires lost to Dr. J and the New York Nets in the Semifinals in 5 games. The money troubles that had troubled the franchise meant that the Squires were forced to trade away pivotal players of the franchise in order to provide short term stability. Julius Erving (along with Willie Sojourner) was traded to the New York Nets for George Carter and cash before the season started.http://www.nba.com/history/players/erving_bio.html Swen Nater was traded on November 21, 1973 to the San Antonio Spurs. The night of the All- Star Game, it was announced that the Squires sold George Gervin to the San Antonio Spurs for $225,000. Gervin's last game with the team was on February 1, but a court battle delayed his play with the Spurs, though it was all settled in favor of the Spurs by March 3.http://www.remembertheaba.com/ABAArticles/KingArticleGervin.html This was the last season the Squires made the playoffs as they went into a tailspin for the next two season, losing over 60 games each season.https://www.basketball- reference.com/teams/VIR/1974_games.html ==Roster== * 34 Mike Barr - Shooting guard * 31 Roger Brown - Center * 35 George Carter - Small forward * 25 Jim Eakins - Center * -- Scott English - Small forward * 44 George Gervin - Shooting guard * 30 George Irvine - Small forward * 12 Jim Ligon - Power forward * 4 Larry Miller - Shooting guard * 31 Swen Nater - Center * 40 Barry Parkhill - Shooting guard * 5 Cincy Powell - Power forward * 14 Roland Taylor - Point guard * 13 Dave Twardzik - Point guard * 11 Bernie Williams - Shooting guard ==Final standings== ===Eastern Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ !
