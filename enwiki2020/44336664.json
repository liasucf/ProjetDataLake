Administratively, the town belongs to the Trnava Region, Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda District. The town is renowned for its thermal spring. ==History== In the 9th century, the territory of Ve\u013ek\u00fd Meder became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The first written record about Ve\u013ek\u00fd Meder was in 1248 under name Villa Meger. The population of the town has been predominantly Hungarian at least since the Middle Ages. In the Middle and Modern Ages, the settlement was a little market town in the western part of Kom\u00e1rom county. In 1466, Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus gave the town privileges. During the period of 1914-18 (World war I), near the town's railway station, was the location of the Austro-Hungarian death camp Kriegsgefangenenlager Nagymegyer. The Serbian cemetery in Ve\u013ek\u00fd Meder has mass graves and monument to 5,153 Serb and Montenegrin war prisoners who died in the Kriegsgefangenenlager Nagymegyer, Austro-Hungarian POW camp. After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops occupied the area, later acknowledged internationally by the Treaty of Trianon.
