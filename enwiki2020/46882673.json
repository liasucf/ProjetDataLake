    "text": "Anti-monarchism in Japan was a minor force during the twentieth century. == History == In 1908, a letter allegedly written by Japanese revolutionaries denied the Emperor's divinity, and threatened his life. In 1910, K\u014dtoku Sh\u016bsui and 10 others plotted to assassinate the Emperor. In 1923, 1925 and 1932 Emperor Hirohito survived assassination attempts. After World War II, the communists were antagonistic to the Emperor. The Japanese Communist Party demanded the abolition of the emperor system. They boycotted the formal opening of the National Diet in 1949 because of the presence of Hirohito. The Japanese Communist Party continued to be antagonistic after Hirohito's death. During the Imperial visits to Otsu, Japan in 1951, and Hokkaido in 1954, Communist posters and handbills antagonistic to the Imperial Family Members were plastered in the cities. In 1951, three thousand students in Kyoto University protested against the reign of Emperor Hirohito. == See also == * Japanese dissidence during the Sh\u014dwa period * Assassination attempts on Hirohito == External links == * * * * * * * * * == References == Category:Japanese Resistance Category:Left-wing politics in Japan Category:Republicanism in Japan ",
