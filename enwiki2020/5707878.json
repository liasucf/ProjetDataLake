    "text": "Bandipore () or Bandipora is the headquarters of district of Bandipore in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is located on the northern banks of Wular Lake\u2014the second-largest freshwater lake in Asia. Bandipora has a terraced garden similar to that of Nishat Bagh in Srinagar. Bandipora is bound by mountains on three sides and by Wular Lake on the fourth. Bandipora is famous for three A's - A'lim (knowledge), Adab (good habits or literature) and Aab (water). As can be known from the folklore, the name of Bandipora originated either from Bund of Wular as Bund e pur, from the local folk- singing bands (b\u0101\u1e47d) as Baand e pur or from the enclosed (band) geographical location as Bandh e pur. Bandipora is bound by mountains on three sides and by Wular Lake in the fourth. ==Geography== Bandipore is situated on the banks of the Wular, a large fresh-water lake which is home to a lot of migratory birds. Inadvertent dumping of the polluted river waters and sewage affluence has led to a pandemic growth of algae in the waters of the Wular which is threatening the lake and its supporting life itself. The main source of pollution to Wular is Jhelum River. The Jhelum River carries all the waste from Srinagar city and other surrounding areas and deposits it in Wular. Despite being the richest wetland of South Asia and the largest freshwater lake in Asia, no steps have been taken to save Wular. Bandipore is also a stepping town to the higher reaches of Razdan, Gurez and Tragbal. The famous Lolab Valley in Kupwara district is adjacent to the Bandipore. It is just from Bandipore via Aloosa village. Once this road is upgraded it will become a lifeline of the Lolab valley and it will provide an additional route to the Kupwara district. Bandipore was the connecting link between North India and Central Asia via the Silk Road. At Pazalpora village there was a custom and immigration department which is now a forest check-post. Due to the fact, Bandipore is also known as the gateway to Central Asia. There are strong links between Skardu, Gurez and Bandipore. ==Tehsils== Bandipore is divided into seven tehsils * Bandipore * Sumbal Sonawari * Ajas * Hajin * Aloosa * Gurez * Tulail http://bandipore.gov.in/ ==Demographics== Indian census, Bandipore had a population of 25,714.

Commercial cabs ply on that route till Kudara that is the farthest point where the cabs stop, and there onwards the terrain becomes hilly and one has to trek to the higher reaches of Mount Harmukh. Sheera Sar [Lake of Spirits] acts as a base camp for all the mountaineering expeditions for Mt Harmukh. To the north lies Gurez, from Bandipore. Commercial cabs ply on this route during summers, however in winters the route remains closed due to heavy snowfall.
