She goes on missions with Trinket, Sir Garrett, and Clod. Together they go on quests, solve mysteries, and learn valuable lessons. ==Episodes== ==Characters== ===Main=== * Princess Nella (voiced by Akira Golz in US, and Zaris-Angel Hator in UK) is a biracial fun-loving princess who goes in the way of a knight in order to protect her kingdom. Nella is a fearless, confident, and a sweet girl. Her exploration of various hobbies and other interests are the basis of several episodes. Originally Nella was a normal Princess who dreamed of being a knight and received her magical necklace that allows her to transform into a Princess Knight after saving and befriending the unicorn Trinket. * Trinket (voiced by Samantha Hahn in US & UK) is Nella's talking unicorn and best friend who loves fashion, making her very stylish. She is supportive and encouraging of her friends, and will be serious if the situation calls for it, in order to help Nella solve problems. Nella befriended Trinket after saving her when Trinket became trapped in slime while looking for a magic pendant inside a cave, which the unicorn later gave to Nella as a \"trinket\" for saving her. Since Trinket's unicorn name was impossible for Nella to pronounce she gave her the name \"Trinket\" as a nickname. * Sir Garrett (voiced by Micah Gursoy) is a knight who tags along with Nella on her quests. He collects Knightly trading cards that identify different types of magical creatures. He is very smart and offers his intelligence to help the kingdom as well. * Clod (voiced by Matthew Gumley in US, and Joe Attewell in UK) is Garrett's talking steed, who has two horns on his head. He is best friends with Sir Garrett, and is also on good terms with Nella and Trinket. Quite often, Clod is the comic relief of the gang. * Sir Blaine (voiced by Evan Christy) is a mean and bossy nine year-old knight who thinks that he is the best at everything he does. Quite often, his ego causes trouble for himself, and he must ask for help. ===Antagonists=== * Badalf, the Wicked Wizard (voiced by Chris Critelli) is a wizard who wishes to steal all of Castlehaven's fancy things. Though he tends to cause trouble with his magic or steals important magical items for himself he can be friendly at times and in one episode is falsely accused of freezing Trinket at a carnival though Nella later discovers it was all a misunderstanding and Badalf was innocent. * Terry is Badalf's loyal pet goat whom often assists Badalf in his schemes. While he does not speak Badalf can apparently understand his vocalizations. * The Frostbite Brothers, three ice dragons known as Snowpuff (voiced by Pierce Cravens), Freezy (voiced by Chuck Lewkowiecz), and Frozey take Santa's sack of presents. * Olivia (voiced by Alyson Leigh Rosenfeld) is Sir Blaine's princess-obsessed cousin who often causes trouble for Nella and her friends as she is somewhat stuck-up though deep down she is a good person who often focuses too much on appearances. She admires Nella for being a Princess however was at first dismissive of the idea of a Princess Knight though she later came to be more accepting of the idea after Nella saved her. She tends to take advantage of Nella's less glamorous friends such as Smelgly and Minatori causing trouble for them, herself, and Castlehaven, though usually learns important lessons even befriending Smelgy and Minatori in the process. Like her cousin, she and Nella occasionally work together. * Stella is a female Dragon who stole things from Castlehaven around the time Nella befriended Trinket. Stella accidentally kidnapped Trinket when she stole the Unicorn's sleeping bag forcing the young Princess Nella to go on a quest to save her best friend. Nella's courage in confronting Stella who had a fearsome reputation allowed Nella to transform into a Princess Knight for the first time. However though Stella stole things and appeared intimidating she felt terrible when Nella revealed she had taken Trinket and revealed she only stole things to decorate her cave. Nella, Trinket, and friends Nella made along her quest helped decorate Stella's cave. Thankful Stella returned what she stole from Castlehaven and apologized for her behavior causing King Dad to knight Nella for her bravery. ===Recurring=== * King Dad (voiced by Ty Jones) is Nella and Norma's dad who is the ruler of Castlehaven. Despite being a king, he's surprisingly an average dad and is pretty down to earth. He is supportive of Nella and was responsible for knighting her after she bravely confronted the dragon Stella to rescue Trinket. * Queen Mom (voiced by Rebecca Soler (season 1)https://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2017/02/14/jessie-potts- audiobook-rec-caraval-stephanie-garber-narrator-rebecca-soler-interview/ and Alex Covington (season 2) is Nella and Norma's mom.
