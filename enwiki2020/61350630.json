She grew up in the Innere Stadt, the first municipal District of Vienna. As a child, she knew she wanted to be either a pianist or an actress. Although she started an apprenticeship as a graphic designer, at 17 she began a career in the theater. She remained an amateur actor stayed for a long time with the \"Neuen Wiener B\u00fchne\" (New Viennese Stage). == Career == Her break came in 1969, when she played the part of Birgit in Wolfgang Bauer's first play, Magic Afternoon at the Viennese Ateliertheatre. Brigitte Swoboda was awarded the Kainz-Medaille for her work in this role. Swoboda was discovered by Gustav Manker in 1969 and became involved with the People's theater of Vienna. She debuted as Salome Pockerl, the partner of Helmut Qualtinger in Nestroy's The Talisman. In this role, Swoboda broke with tradition. In the words of one journalist, \"Swoboda was not a cute Rousseauen creature\" but rather \"lost through sheer negligence, a most uncomfortably cut proletarian, a shadowy growth from the lowest depths, a discarded changeling from a stable full of city teenagers\". The well known couplet, Ja, die M\u00e4nner hab\u2019n \u2019s gut! (Yes, men have it so good!), sounded \"so dangerous, as if it was scratched with a rusty knife\". (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung)Paulus Manker: Der Theatermann Gustav Manker. Spurensuche. Amalthea, Wien 2010 After this performance, Swoboda played the role of nurse Riki in the premiere of Wolfgang Bauers Change (1969).

(For Nothing!, 1974) and Das Gew\u00fcrzkr\u00e4merkleeblatt (literally: The Spice Seller, 1977).
