Frankrigsgade Sv\u00f8mmehall, an indoor covered swimming pool, is located at No. 35. ==History== The street follows one of the two old main streets in Sundby\u00f8ster. The street was originally named \u00d8strigsgade but this name was changed to Frankrigsgade in 1901(1902 when Sundbyerne was merged with Copenhagen Municipality which already had an \u00d8strigsgade. The new street name was in line with other streets in the area which were named after countries in Southern Europe. The street continued straight to Lyb\u00e6kgade and then continued in a more southeastern direction down to \u00d8resundsvej. The direct continuation of the straight section of the street was called Lauenborggade. Lauenborggade was 1942 incorporated in Frankrigsgade while the eastern, more winding section of Frankrigsgade was renamed Wittenberggade and connected to the extension of \u00d8strigsgade. Several industrial enterprises were located in the street. Christian Ludvig Scheel owned a cardboard factory at the southern corner with Amagerbrogade. The site had previously belonged to Jacob Holm who owned a ropewalk in Reberbanegade. The cardboard factory was from circa 1900 continued by Scheel's son-in-law, Carl Reiermann, who moved it to the other side of Amagerbrogade. Gruberts Metalvarefabrik, a manufacturer of lamps, chandeliers and other metal products, was until c.1940 located at the corner of Frankrigsgade and Wittenberggade. The factory had been founded by Heinerich August Grubert in Tyrolsgade in 1863 but was by his sons moved to the site in Frankrigsgade in circa 1915. It was with its up to 250 workers one of the largest employers in the area. ==Notable buildings and residents== No. 3: The former Sundby Asyl Sundby Church is located at the northern corner with Amagerbrogade.
