    "text": "The Wounded Angel () (1903) is a painting by Finnish symbolist painter Hugo Simberg. It is one of the most recognizable of Simberg's works, and was voted Finland's \"national painting\" in a vote held by the Ateneum art museum in 2006. In a similar 2013 vote held by Nordic Moneta, it was voted second most important. Like other Simberg works, the atmosphere is melancholic: the angelic central figure with her bandaged forehead and bloodied wing, the sombre clothing of her two youthful bearers. The direct gaze of the right-hand figure touches the viewer. The procession passes through a recognisable landscape, that of El\u00e4intarha, Helsinki, with T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6nlahti Bay in the background. Lepp\u00e4nen, Marko: Maalaukseen astuminen \u2013 Haavoittunut enkeli El\u00e4intarhassa Esoteerinen maantiede ja periferiaterapia. Accessed 16 April 2010. The same road still skirts T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6nlahti Bay today. In Hugo Simberg\u2019s time, the park was a popular spot for leisure-time activities among the working classes. At the time, many charity institutions were located in El\u00e4intarha park; in The Wounded Angel the healthy boys are carrying the injured girl towards the Blind Girls\u2019 School and the Home for Cripples. She clutches a bunch of snowdrops, symbolic of healing and rebirth. Simberg himself declined to offer any deconstruction, suggesting that the viewer draw their own conclusions. However it is known that Simberg had been suffering from meningitis, and that the painting was a source of strength during his recovery. The Wounded Angel at the Ateneum website This can also be read metaphorically: meningitis is known to cause neck stiffness, lethargy and light sensitivity, each of which is exhibited by the central figure. If read as lungs rather than wings, such a diagnosis even explains the minor injury, as tubercular meningitis causes abrasions to the upper lungs. The Wounded Angel was praised by a number of Finnish artists when first displayed in 1903 at the Ateneum autumn exhibition. In a letter to his sister Blenda, Simberg wrote on the 10th of October 1903: \u201dI wanted to share the good news with you \u2013 I was not rejected this year, even though the jury was terribly strict. It seems that I have achieved something of a grand succ\u00e9s among my colleagues and the members of the jury. Gall\u00e9n is so excited that I can hardly take him seriously. His first words were the highest flattery of my work and, oddly, he seems quite beside himself with enthusiasm for the big painting. He says that it gives him the impression that I had stood alone in a little cabin, huddled in the midst of a great forest, and had painted in complete indifference to the outside world. He says that it radiates peace and harmony like no other work in the exhibition \u2013 Even Edelfelt said nice things to me.\u201d Olavinen 2000, page 96. Hugo Simberg 1873\u20131917. Text by Anja Olavinen. Helsinki: Ateneum (Ateneum Publications No. 13), When Simberg was asked to paint frescoes for the Tampere Cathedral in 1905\u201306, one was a larger version of The Wounded Angel, his favorite painting. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1903 paintings Category:Symbolist paintings Category:Angels in art Category:Paintings by Hugo Simberg Category:Paintings of the Ateneum ",
