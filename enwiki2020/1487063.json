After a childhood in Florence and enlistment in the Italian army he enrolled in classes at a local military college in Florence. In 1901 he was promoted to the rank of major.

Da Gianina all'occupazione di Corf\u00f9 (agosto-settembre 1923) di Andrea Giannasi :it:Andrea Giannasi, Prospettiva Editrice, 2007, After the end of the hostilities, he commanded Italian troops in Albania. ==Assassination== In 1923 Tellini was part of an Italian delegation sent by the League of Nations to survey the disputed border between Greece and Albania. He was shot and killed, along with four companions, when the car he was driving in was stopped by a fallen tree across the road that ran along the disputed border near the town of Ioannina on the way to the Albanian border. The responsible persons were never found. The incident occurred close to the disputed border and could have been carried out by either side. However, the Italians under Benito Mussolini, blamed the Greek side. The Greek side refused any responsibility. The Italians claimed Greece as responsible and there were anti-Greek retaliations in the country. The Greek government denied responsibility and blamed Albanian bandits in the area. Benito Mussolini demanded 50 million lira in reparations from Greece and the execution of the assassins. On 31 August 1923 Italian troops occupied Corfu in the Corfu incident.THE CORFU INCIDENT OF 1923: MUSSOLINI AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. By James Barros. Princeton, N.
