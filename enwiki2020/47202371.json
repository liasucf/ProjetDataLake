In addition, Valuyska was not credited as contributing to the songwriting process while there is a rule that all participants must've had some part in writing their song. ==Artist and song information== ===Anna Trincher=== Anna Trincher (; born 3 August 2001) is a Ukrainian singer. She also attempted to represent Ukraine in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with her song \"Nebo znaye\" (Heaven knows), placing thirteenth. She\u2019s no stranger to musical competition. In the past, Anna has participated in a number of musical competitions and festivals, including the \u201cNightingale of Ukraine\u201d, the \u201cMy Chance\u201d online competition, the musical division of the International Turkish Olympiad, \u201cNew Wave\u201d 2015 and the Ukrainian edition of \u201cThe Voice Kids\u201d (mentored by singer Natalia Mogilevska). Anna is very active in school, with a particular interest in Algebra and Geometry, as well as English, because it gives her the chance to communicate with new friends from all over the world. Looking towards her future, Anna\u2019s biggest goal at the moment is to honorably represent Ukraine at this year\u2019s Junior Eurovision Song Contest, but beyond that, she\u2019d love to hold her own solo concert, with an audience full of her friends, family, and fans. Her biggest dream, however, is to perform a duet with Beyonc\u00e9. In 2018, she took part in the eighth season of The Voice of Ukraine where she made it all the way to the finals, later securing her spot as the second runner-up. ===Pochny z sebe=== Pochny z sebe () is a song by Ukrainian child singer Anna Trincher and it represented Ukraine in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Sofia, Bulgaria, achieving 11th place with 38 points. ==At Junior Eurovision== At the running order draw which took place on 15 November 2015, Ukraine were drawn to perform twelfth on 21 November 2015, following and preceding host country . ===Final=== Dressed in a flowy orange outfit and emerging from a glittering, metallic lotus at the beginning of her song, Anna sang \"Pochny z sebe (\"Start With Yourself)\" with a lot of power and passion. With images of nature on the screens behind her (ranging from waterfalls and dolphins to volcanoes and flames), the intensity of the presentation seemed to rise with that of the song, until the song's close, when we zoom out on a quietly spinning Earth. Anna Trincher at stage of JESC 2015 ===Voting=== The voting during the final consisted of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released one month after the final. Following the release of the full split voting by the EBU after the conclusion of the competition, it was revealed that Ukraine had placed twelfth with the public televote and thirteenth with the jury vote. In the public vote, Ukraine scored 35 points, while with the jury vote, Ukraine scored 19 points. Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Ukraine and awarded by Ukraine in the final and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the final. ===Points awarded to Ukraine=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * *24px | valign=\"top\" | * |} {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |- ! colspan=5|Televoting Points Awarded to Ukraine |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * |} {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |- ! colspan=5|Jury Points Awarded to Ukraine |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | |- |} ===Points awarded by Ukraine=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ===Split voting results=== The following five members comprise the Ukrainian jury: *Natallia Miedvedieva *Yevgeny Matyushenko *Andrii Yakumenko *Mikhail Nekrasov *Alla Popova {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !colspan=10| Split Voting Results from Ukraine |- !
