Levale credits her interest in the sport of rugby union in part to her Samoan heritage and the complexity of the sport. Levale plays in both rugby sevens and the 15s. She made her debut with the Canadian national team at the age of 17 in 2017 and was the youngest woman to do so since Caroline Crossley in 2015. ==References== Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Canada international rugby sevens players Category:Female rugby sevens players Category:Rugby sevens players at the 2019 Pan American Games Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games medalists in rugby sevens Category:People from the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District Category:Canadian people of Samoan descent ",
