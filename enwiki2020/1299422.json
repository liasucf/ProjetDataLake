    "text": "Goan literature is the literature pertaining to the state of Goa in India. Goan Literature Goa has a population of around 1.4 million and an area of 3,700 sq. kilometres (1,430 sq. miles). For a small region, it has a significant amount of publication activity, possibly in part because its people write in a number of languages\u2014perhaps as many as 13\u2014and also because of the large expatriate and diaspora population of Goans settled across the globe. Among its most noted writers are Laxmanrao Sardessai (1904-1986) and R. V. Pandit (1917-1990), both of whom wrote poetry and prose in Marathi, Konkani, and Portuguese; Shenoi Goembab (1877\u20131946), whose Konkani writing helped to establish Konkani as a modern literary language; Ravindra Kelekar (1925-2010), who wrote some of the twentieth century's foremost Konkani literature; and Pundalik Naik (1952-), whose 1977 novel Acchev was the first Konkani novel to be translated into English. == History == Books from Goa. Goa was the first place in Asia to have a printing press, which was brought by the Jesuits in 1556.A.K. Priolkar, The Printing Press in India: Its Beginnings and Early Development being a quatercentenary commemoration study of the advent of printing in India in 1556, (Bombay: Marathi Samshodhana Mandala, 1958). Nearly all of Goan literature before that time is known to have been destroyed by the Portuguese during the imposition of Inquisition. Goa's Portuguese colonial rulers can hardly be credited with meticulous record-keeping of Goan literature. Thus, Goa has had a long love affair with the written and printed word, although growth has been slow, and punctuated by problems like linguistic breaks and censorship. Peter Nazareth points out that Goans have written in thirteen languages, of which the chief are Konkani, Marathi, English and Portuguese. Nazareth describes Goans as 'cultural brokers': > Goans mediate between cultures, Goans live between different cultures, Goans > are travellers from one part of the world to another. This, in my opinion, > happened when East and West met in Goans under pressure with the Portuguese > conquest. Since that time, our usefulness to the world, wherever we are, is > that we can understand different cultures and help people from different > cultures understand one another. The disadvantage is that if we don't work > on it, we may end up not knowing who we are. Literary writing in Goa began to take shape under Portuguese rule and influence, associated with Portugal's mid-nineteenth-century Regeneration, which saw the reintroduction of the press to Goa, along with expanded Portuguese education. A spate of Portuguese-language publications, 'such as A Biblioteca de Goa (1839), O Enciclop\u00e9dico (1841-1842), O Compilador (1843-1847), O Gabinete Liter\u00e1rio das Fontainhas (1846-1848), A revista Ilustrativa (1857-1866) and O Arquivo Portugu\u00e9s Oriental (1857-1866)', along with J\u00falio Gon\u00e7alves's Ilustra\u00e7ao Goana (1864-1866), while often short-lived, provided new fora not only for the circulation of European literature (whether originally in Portuguese or in translation), but provided growing opportunities for Goans to publish literary and scholarly writing.Paul Melo e Castro. Lengthening Shadows. 2 vols. Salig\u00e3o, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. I pp. 9-10 (quoting p. 9). The first novel published by a Goan was Os Brahamanes (The Brahmans) by Francisco Luis Gomes, published in 1866.Ben Antao, 'Goan Literature in English', Muse India, 64 (November\u2013December 2015), . Later in the nineteenth century, vernacular writing began to emerge in strength, for example in Konkani, the widely spoken local vernacular. The Goan writer Shenoi Goembab (1877\u20131946) was foundational to developing modern Konkani literature.Kiran Budkuley, 'Modern Konkani Classics', Muse India, 64 (November\u2013December 2015), . An official language of the region since 1987,Goanet Reader: Puzzle wrapped in an enigma, understanding Konkani in Goa, http://goanet.org/post.php?name=News&list;=goanet&info;=2006-June/thread&post;_id=044809. Konkani is now studied in schools. Konkani literature emerged alongside the rapid growth of Marathi literature, in which the Goan R. V. Pandit was a notable exponent. S. M. Tadkodkar, who was conferred Ph.D. degree by Goa University for his exhaustive research work on Anant Kaakaba Priolkar, contends that while the Kannadd language of Karnataka province was dominating the Goan culture, Marathi language and culture was embraced by Goans. Now, Marathi has embraced the Goans and would not leave them, willingly. Maximum literature is published in Marathi. There are 8 Marathi dailies published from Goa. Prominent among them are Dianik Gomantak, Tarun Bharat, Lokamat, Navaprabha, Pudhari, Goadoot, Sanatan Prabhat. The Marathi daily Lokmat has the highest circulation (50000+) among all dailies. In the late nineteenth century, extensive contacts with and migration to British-ruled India also encouraged English-language Goan writing, with early exponents including Joseph Furtado. Edward D'Lima, who has done his PhD on the Goan writer Armando Menezes, argues that Goan writing in English goes back to the late nineteenth century, when Goans were migrating out of this Portuguese-controlled colony in favour of jobs in the growing English-speaking British-ruled colonial world. English is probably the most influential literary language in Goa: 'a surge of creativity has erupted in Goan literature in English since 2000 in fiction and nonfiction, drama and poetry'.Ben Antao, 'Goan Literature in English', Muse India, 64 (November\u2013December 2015), . ==Goan writers== Besides English, Konkani and Marathi, Goans, particularly those of the past generation, have contributed significantly to writings in Portuguese. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Name !Dates !Principal language(s) !Principal forms !Notes |- |Ben Antao |1935- |English |fiction and non-fiction | |- |Walfrido Ant\u00e3o |1950s-1980s |Portuguese |short stories | |- |Carmo Azavedo | |Portuguese | |Noted for From the Tip of the Pen (Ao Bico da Pena). |- |Alexandre Moniz Barbosa | |English | | |- |Silviano C.
