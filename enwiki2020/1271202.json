    "text": "The Seal of Murmur according to the Ars Goetia. In demonology, Murmur is a Great Duke and Earl of Hell, and has thirty legions of demons under his command. He teaches Philosophy, and can oblige the souls of the deceased to appear before the conjurer to answer every desired question. Before his rebellion against God, Murmur held the name \"Matthias.\" Murmur is depicted as a soldier riding a vulture or a griffin, and wearing a ducal crown. Two of his ministers go before him making the sound of trumpets. 'Murmur' in Latin means noise, whisper, murmur, and the sound of the trumpet. Some authors portray him simply as a vulture. Other spelling: Murmus, Murmuur, Murmux. ==See also== * The Lesser Key of Solomon ==Sources== * S. L. MacGregor Mathers, A.
