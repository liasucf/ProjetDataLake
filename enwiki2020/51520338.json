Although John Machell and Lady Elizabeth had no direct issue between them, the union of their lines occurred in the next generation, when in 1635 Mathew Machell, the third son of John, married his own step-sister Elizabeth Carryll at Wonersh.Challen, John Machell, M.P., Horsham. Mathew had been apprenticed a Goldsmith in London to the royal silversmith Edward Sewster, who died in 1628 granting the uncompleted term of service to his apprentice.Will of Edward Sewster, Goldsmith of London (P.C.C. 1628).

John therefore became the only heir in blood of the Machell connection with the Carryll and Aungier families. == Early life and education == John was probably nurtured at Great Tangley by his grandmother: his father remarried in 1644 to a widow Jane Smither, sister and co-heir of John Downe of Cobham, Surrey (d. 1661),Downe, who married Elizabeth Sutton, was active in the Cobham confrontations with Gerrard Winstanley, cf.

Mathew's sister Jane had married into the Gavell family who, like the Downes and Suttons, were heirs to lands around Cobham formerly belonging to Chertsey Abbey through pre-Reformation familial connections.T.E.C.

Helena's sister Cecily was the wife of Edward Eversfield, M.P. for Bramber, Sussex in 1661. Early in 1667 Machell sat as a Justice of the Peace, and became a Commissioner for Subsidies, in which role he continued until 1680. He resumed work as a Justice in 1668. In that year his uncle John Machell of Wendover died leaving an established family.Will of John Machell, Gentleman of Buckinghamshire (P.C.C. 1668). John and Helena had four children, of whom two daughters, Isabella (b. 1670) and Caecilia Maria, survived infancy.Challen, 'John Machell, M.P., Horsham', Sussex Notes and Queries (1964). In both parliaments of 1679 Anthony Eversfield, brother of Edward, represented Horsham together with John Michell, and in 1681 John Machell, who had acquired burgages in Horsham,B.M.

In 1691 Machell's second daughter Caecilia Maria married John Parsons at All Hallows- on-the-Wall, and they had a daughter Helena.Challen, 'John Machell, M.P., Horsham', Sussex Notes and Queries (1964). Sir Arthur Ingram (died 1642), Arthur's great-grandfather, had a long parliamentary career and had received considerable royal favour under James I. In the 1685 election Machell and Anthony Eversfield were returned for Horsham, though as a Whig he took little part in the parliament of James II. They were returned together again for the Convention Parliament of 1689. John Machell held his seat in three further parliaments spanning the 1690s, through the election of 1690 (with Thomas White) and those of 1695 and 1698 (with Henry Yates).P. Watson, 'Constituencies: Horsham (Borough)', in D. Hayton, E. Cruickshanks and S. Handley (eds.), The History of Parliament: The House of Commons 1690\u20131715 (Boydell and Brewer 2002), History of Parliament online. He was probably an Exclusionist, and was identified as a Court supporter. Among his parliamentary contributions he advocated the rights of Quakers to make solemn affirmations instead of taking the Oath, attacked the severity of James II's judiciary, and spoke against other oppressive measures. Having been Commissioner for wine licences in 1690\u201391, he soon afterwards advocated a general tax on the imports of French red wines. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick in 1696.'Machell, John (1637\u20131704)', in History of Parliament 1660\u20131690 and 1690\u20131715. == Last years and legacy == Machell was increasingly inactive or absent from parliament during the later 1690s, sometimes on the grounds of health, and did not contest the 1701 elections. His half-brother Joseph having died, in 1689 the widow made a will entrusting her two children Thomas and Anne Machell and their legacies to John Machell's wardship, a role towards the orphans which he accepted as executor in proving their mother's will in 1693.Will of Susan Machell of Cobham, widow: London Metropolitan Archives, Ref. DW/PA/5/1693 will no. 68. John's stepmother Jane and half-brother Mathew Machell made their residence in London, and in his will written in 1702 John Machell left an annuity of \u00a310 per annum to Mathew Machell of London, Gent., his \"brother of the half blood\". Arthur Ingram having died in that year, Edward (1686\u20131714) became 4th Viscount while still at Eton, and soon afterwards was making a good impression at Christ's College, Cambridge, where John Covel had him under instruction and sent his good wishes to Lady Isabella and Mr Machell at Temple Newsam.Christ's College, Cambridge: Letters Online. Letter from John Covel to John Rhoades, 3 November 1702. John Machell died at Temple Newsam, but was buried at Horsham in 1704.Challen, 'John Machell, M.P., Horsham', Sussex Notes and Queries (1964). Hughes and Knight, Hills: Horsham's Lost Stately Home, pp. 14, 18. After other bequests (including provision for his orphaned granddaughter Helena Parsons), the bulk of his fortune was entailed upon his Ingram grandchildren, commencing with Rich and his heirs male in succession, and then in default to each of the other grandchildren and their heirs in turn, upon condition that they should henceforth use the surname Machell and not that of Ingram.Will of John Machell of Horsham, Sussex (P.C.C. 1704). The will was proved in 1704 by the Executors, but in March 1711/12 the 5th Viscount Rich Ingram was sworn into probate. An acknowledgement of this wish was made by the eldest grandson Edward Machell Ingram (who, as master of Temple Newsam, never inherited Hills), but not by Rich or his successors, more than one of whom served as MPs for Horsham.
