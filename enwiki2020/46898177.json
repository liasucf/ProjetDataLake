On 21 October 2019, she reached her best singles ranking of world No. 96, and on 30 September, her best doubles ranking of No. 72. In mid-2020, Kalinskaya tested positive for COVID-19.http://www.tennisnow.com/News/2020/July/World-No-112-Anna-Kalinskaya- Reveals-Positive-Cov.aspx ===2015: Junior Grand Slam final, professional debut=== In just her third professional tournament, Kalinskaya reached the final of an 10k event in Antalya as an unranked qualifier. The run made it possible for her to debut on the WTA rankings as the world No. 1201. At the French Open, Kalinskaya reached the final of the girls' singles event, stunning CiCi Bellis in the semifinals en route to her runner-up finish. In the final, she was defeated in straight sets by Paula Badosa. She made another final, this time during the girls' doubles event at the US Open alongside Anastasia Potapova. They lost the final in straight sets. She made her WTA debut at the Kremlin Cup after being handed wildcard, losing to eventual semifinalist and compatriot Daria Kasatkina in the second qualifying round. Kalinskaya made her second professional final at the ITF 10k event in El Kantaoui but gave a walkover in the final. Nonetheless, this result pushed her into the Top 600 for the first time in her career. Her debut year ended with a 14-6 win-loss record with two 10k runner-up finishes. In addition, she won her first ITF title in doubles on her professional debut at the 25k event in Sunrise with Katerina Stewart. === 2016: Junior Grand Slam doubles title, success on the ITF Women's Circuit === At the Australian Open, Kalinskaya finally won her first Grand Slam doubles title with Tereza Mihal\u00edkov\u00e1. They won the tournament without dropping a set throughout. Four consecutive finals came for Kalinskaya from March to June, winning one 10k title and one 25k title respectively. Her first top-200 win came over Aryna Sabalenka in Minsk. Another 25k title in Aschaffenburg soon allowed Kalinskaya to crack the top 300. It was an impressive year for the Russian, who reached a total of eight finals and entering the top 200 for the first time in her career. Putting together a win-loss record of 41-10, she also made her WTA Tour main-draw debut at the Kremlin Cup, losing to Kristina Mladenovic in straight sets. This started a new phase of her career, which is the gradual transition onto the main tour. ===2017: Transition to the WTA Tour=== Kalinskaya started to play more WTA tournaments in 2017, playing her first Grand Slam event as a professional player at the Australian Open. However, she was defeated by top seed Stefanie V\u00f6gele in the first round of qualifying. Handed a wildcard into the main draw of the St. Petersburg Trophy, Kalinskaya was ousted by Daria Gavrilova in the first round. She received her first Fed Cup nomination for Russia's match in the Fed Cup World Group II, but was only selected for the dead doubles rubber, which she triumphed alongside Anna Blinkova. Her first big win came at the Malaysian Open, where she got through the qualifying rounds and stunned Caroline Garcia for her first top-20 win. Several early exits at 60k events soon followed, but she then reached the second round of the \u0130stanbul Cup as a lucky loser. Kalinskaya was close to another big win, but fell to Anett Kontaveit in a tight three-setter in the second round of the Ladies Championship Gstaad. Her first ITF title came at the 25k level in October, ending the year with a 34-26 win-loss record with three top-100 wins. ===2018: Pursuit for success at the majors=== Kalinskaya started the new year by qualifying for the Australian Open. On her Grand Slam main-draw debut, she lost to Camila Giorgi in straight sets. She made her Fed Cup live rubber debut at the Fed Cup World Group II, putting up a tough fight but falling to veteran Magdal\u00e9na Ryb\u00e1rikov\u00e1 in a thrilling match. Three consecutive 60k semifinals in March allowed Kalinskaya to jump almost 20 spots in the rankings. She lost in the final round of qualifying at both the French Open and Wimbledon. Kalinskaya lost various first round matches on the WTA level, including the Moscow River Cup. In a year of breakthroughs, she made the main draw of the US Open for the first time in her career as well. In the first round, she was defeated by world No.9 Julia G\u00f6rges in three sets. Making another appearance at the Kremlin Cup as a wildcard, Kalinskaya was ousted by Kristina Mladenovic in a repeat of their 2016 encounter on the exact same stage. ===2019: First WTA semifinal, first top-10 win=== Kalinskaya started the year with a triumph at the ITF 25k event City of Playford Tennis International, defeating Elena Rybakina in the final. She then successfully qualified for the main draw at the Australian Open once again, but was defeated by world No. 11, Aryna Sabalenka, in the first round. There were success in doubles for the Russian as she partnered Vikt\u00f3ria Ku\u017emov\u00e1 to reach the final of the St. Petersburg Trophy, a Premier event, and lifted their first WTA title together at the J&T; Banka Prague Open. It was the first WTA title of any kind for Kalinskaya. Kalinskaya won the biggest title of her career at the Engie Open Saint-Gaudens Occitanie, an 60k event. She defeated Ana Bogdan in the final. For the first time in her career, Kalinskaya managed to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon but lost to Magda Linette in the first round. The Russian had an impressive North American hard-court swing, reaching the semifinals of a WTA event for the first time in her career. At the Citi Open, she survived the qualifying rounds before producing a huge comeback against reigning Olympics champion Monica Puig and stunning Kristina Mladenovic for her first win over the Frenchwoman in three attempts. She was ultimately defeated by eventual champion Jessica Pegula in the semifinals. In addition, Kalinskaya reached the same stage for doubles alongside Miyu Kato as well. At the US Open, Kalinskaya prevailed in the qualifying rounds once again. In the first round, she stunned world No. 10, Sloane Stephens, on her Arthur Ashe Stadium debut, winning in straight sets. However, she was unable to back up her win as she was defeated by wildcard Kristie Ahn in her next match. Another WTA quarterfinal soon followed at the Tashkent Open, where she beat Tatjana Maria en route. However, her quarterfinal match was a match to forget as she was beaten by Katarina Zavatska after winning only two games. She ended the year with a second-round appearance at the Kremlin Cup, ensuring that she made her top-100 debut after the tournament. ==Performance timelines== Only main-draw results in WTA Tour, Grand Slam tournaments, Fed Cup and Olympic Games are included in win\u2013loss records. ===Singles=== This table is current through the 2019 China Open. {|class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
