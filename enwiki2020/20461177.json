    "text": "\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" was a hit single from Culture Club's Platinum-plus debut album Kissing to Be Clever. The 7\" single was released only in North America, peaking at #9 in the U.S. and #5 in Canada. In Australia, it was released in September 1983 as a Double A-side single with Karma Chameleon, peaking at #1 and receiving substantial airplay. With this single, in America, Culture Club was the first band to have three Top 10 singles from a debut album since the Beatles. Much like the group's two prior American hits, this song was aided by a hugely popular MTV music video. ==Track listing== ;Canada 7\" vinyl # A. \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" \u2013 2:32 # B. \"Man Shake\" \u2013 2:34 ;USA 7\" vinyl # A. \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" \u2013 2:32 # B. \"Mystery Boy\" ;USA 12\" vinyl # A. \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" (12\") \u2013 4:38 # B. \"Man Shake\" \u2013 2:34 ==Official versions== * \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" (7\") \u2013 2:36 * \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" (U.S. 12\" Remix) \u2013 4:38 * \"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\" (VH1 Storytellers Live) ==Chart positions== *U.S. Billboard Hot 100: #9 *Canadian Singles Charts: #9 *U.S. Hot Dance Club Play: #14 *U.S. Adult Contemporary: #33 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
