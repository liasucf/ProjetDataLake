After her parents divorced in 1973, she was brought to Moscow by her mother, Alla Pugacheva, and lived with her maternal grandparents. At the age of 7, she debuted in the Soviet children's television program \"Veseliye Notki\" (Happy Musical Notes) with the song \"Solnyshko Smeyotsya\" (The Sun Laughs). In 1982, she was cast in the leading role of \"Lena Bessoltseva\" in Scarecrow, a film by Rolan Bykov based on the Vladimir Zheleznikov play of the same name. Production began in 1982 and the film premiered in 1984. It became a critical success, not only in Russia but also overseas, and turned Orbakaite into a child star. Alongside her acting, Orbakaite continued with her budding singing career. In 1983, she sang \"A znayesh, vse yesche budet\" (You know, it will all happen yet) in a duet with her mother. In 1985, she sang the song \"Pust' Govoryat\" in the popular TV program \"Utrenyaya Pochta\" (Morning Mail). Now a young woman, Kristina appeared in the films Viva Gardes-Marines!
