Based in Scottsdale, Arizona, Kahala is one of North America's largest holding company of franchise fast food restaurant companies. In May 2016, the publicly traded Canadian MTY Food Group announced a friendly takeover deal with the Kahala Brands. MTY agreed to pay about US$300 million to acquire Kahala. The two companies generated near $2 billion in revenues in the previous year. Jeff Smit was chosen to lead the US operations of MTY. ==History== A Cold Stone Creamery location Surf City Squeeze was started in the early 1980s by Kevin Blackwell and his wife Kathi, and later became a franchise. Later, in 1998/1999, Sports Group International, Inc. (a company that was originally formed to distributed Spalding-branded sports drinks) merged with Surf City Squeeze with Surf City Squeeze's management taking over full control of the company. Also in 1999, Sports Group International purchased Frullati Cafe & Bakery Chain, bringing the total number of its franchised locations to 200. In 2001, Kevin Blackwell changed the name of his company from Sports Group International to Kahala Corp. after terminating an agreement with Spalding. Also in 2000, Kahala Corp. then developed the Rollerz brand. From 2002 to 2006, Kahala Corp. purchased Ranch One Grilled Chicken, Samurai Sam's Teriyaki Grill, Taco Time, Great Steak, Johnnie's New York Pizzeria, and Blimpie. Kahala also acquired the license to Wafflo. In 2007, Kahala Corp and Cold Stone Creamery agreed to merge creating a combined company holding 13 diversified brands. The combined company generated more than $1.1 billion in system wide sales in partnership with 3,000-plus franchisees and more than 4,600 retail locations. As a result of the merger, Kahala's CEO Kevin Blackwell and Cold Stone Creamery's CEO and chairman Doug Ducey were respectively appoint chairman and CEO of the new combined company, Kahala-Cold Stone. Ducey left a few months later to join tech start-up iMemories after being forced out by Blackwell. In July 2007, Kahala-Cold Stone acquired Cereality Cereal Bar & Cafe. In 2012, Kahala signed a franchising deal with Phoenix-based America's Taco Shop. In 2013, a controlling interest in Kahala Corp. was purchased by the Serruya family of Canada. The Serruyas own and founded Yogen Fr\u00fcz, a chain with 1400 stores around the world. At that time, Michael Serruya became Chairman and Co-CEO of Kahala Corp. Shortly thereafter, Co-CEO Kevin Blackwell left the company. The Serruya family changed the company name from Kahala Corp to Kahala Brands to better align the focus of the business. In June 2015, Kahala Brands purchased Planet Smoothie and Tasti D-Lite. This acquisition added 128 new locations to the overall company store count and increased the total of smoothie-focused locations to over 400 worldwide. Just a few months later in November 2015, Kahala Brands purchased the gourmet coffee and smoothie brand Maui Wowi.
