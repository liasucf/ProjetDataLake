    "text": "Paulina G\u00f3mez Torres (born 29 July 1991) known professionally as Paulina Goto is a Mexican actress, singer, and television hostess, who first gained popularity for her debut role in the Mexican telenovela Ni\u00f1a de mi Coraz\u00f3n in 2010. She was a member of the popular Mexican-Argentine pop group, Eme 15, formed by Televisa producer Pedro Dami\u00e1n, from 2011 to 2014. ==Early life== Paulina Goto was born in Monterrey, Mexico. She has one younger brother named Eduardo. Her mother is a psychologist. Her father is a singer and musician who often co-writes songs with her. When she was 5 years old, Goto and her family moved from Monterrey to Tampico, Tamaulipas where she spent the remainder of her childhood and adolescence. As a young child, she participated in dance classes and began taking ballet lessons when she was four years old. She trained as a rhythmic gymnast from age five until she was fourteen, attending R\u00edtmica Escuela de Gimnasia in Tampico. Goto earned recognition as a state and national champion and represented Mexico in international competitions. In 2000, she competed in rhythmic gymnastics at her first national junior Olympics tournament in Guadalajara, Mexico. In December 2010, she returned to R\u00edtmica Escuela de Gimnasia to participate in a special Christmas themed performance alongside the school's current students. Goto completed her primary education at Escuela Americana de Tampico (\"The American School of Tampico\" in English), a private bi-lingual school with an emphasis on American-style education. She participated in the school choir from an early age. She briefly attended the Tampico campus of Tec de Monterrey but later completed her secondary schooling via online correspondence upon moving to Mexico City when she was 17 years old. ==Acting career== ===Early career (2008-2011)=== Goto began her television career in 2008 as a co-host on the youth-targeted television news show, Roomies, which was produced locally for Televisa del Golfo in Tampico. She spent a year on the show before leaving in 2009. During her time on \"Roomies\", she and some of the cast members were invited to audition for Centro de Educaci\u00f3n Art\u00edstica, the free drama school run by media giant, Televisa, in Mexico City. One month after her CEA audition, Goto was accepted into the school and moved to Mexico City, where she lived with relatives during her first year of school. During her first year, she studied voice, acting, and dance. When she was 18 years old, CEA held auditions for director Pedro Dami\u00e1n's (best known for his work with Latin-pop group, RBD) newest telenovela. Though she had no prior professional acting experience, she was cast as the lead in Ni\u00f1a de mi Coraz\u00f3n, an updated version of Damian's 1997 telenovela, Mi Peque\u00f1a Traviesa. Goto played the dual role of Andrea Paz and Paz's imaginary twin brother, Andres Paz. Following her casting in the series, Goto discontinued her studies at CEA to pursue a full- time acting career. Filming for Ni\u00f1a de mi Coraz\u00f3n began in January 2010 in Mexico City and ended in July 2010. The telenovela premiered on 8 March 2010 in Mexico and ended on 9 July 2010. It premiered on Univision in the U.S. on 23 February 2011. In the spring of 2011, Goto made her theatre debut as the lead female protagonist in the play El Knack directed by Odiseo Bichir, and starring Mexican actors, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Bichir and Alfonso Dosal. ===Breakout success with \"Miss XV\" and other roles (2011-2015)=== In June 2011, Goto attended a casting call in Mexico City for Televisa's teen-oriented musical television series, Miss XV. Actress Danna Paola was originally selected for one of two lead roles but later dropped out before casting was finalized. The following month, Goto was confirmed as the lead for the series. Miss XV is a television series inspired by the famous 1987 telenovela, Quincea\u00f1era, starring Thal\u00eda and Adela Noriega.http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=187262 Grupo F\u00f3rmula Paulina Goto y Eleazar G\u00f3mez protagonizar\u00e1n \"Miss XV\".
