    "text": "At the Cinema! is an album by multi-instrumentalist and composer Buddy Collette's Swinging Shepherds, a jazz group featuring four flautists, recorded in early 1959 and released on the Mercury label.Mercury Records Catalog: 20400 series accessed June 2, 2015 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states: \"Assisted by a fine West Coast rhythm section, Collette and his fellow flutists perform concise versions of 11 songs that were used in the movies. The repertoire ranges from standards such as 'Laura,' 'I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me' and 'Invitation' to a few lesser-known numbers. The treatments are quite respectful but of interest to jazz listeners\". ==Track listing== # \"Colonel Bogey & River Kwai March\" (Kenneth J.
