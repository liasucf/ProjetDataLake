    "text": "The Celebration Bowl is a postseason college football bowl game, first played in the 2015 season, contested between the champions of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) and the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) \u2014 the two prominent conferences of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in NCAA Division I. It serves as the de facto national championship of black college football. The game is held annually on the third weekend of December. Starting with the December 2017 game, it is played at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium; the first two games were played at the Georgia Dome. It is currently the only active bowl game to feature teams from the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). ==History== The Celebration Bowl is a successor to two previous bowl games between the MEAC and SWAC, the Pelican Bowl and Heritage Bowl. Because the Celebration Bowl takes place during the FCS playoff tournament, neither the SWAC nor the MEAC can send their champion to the tournament. At the time the Celebration Bowl was inaugurated, the SWAC's regular season already extended too late into the year for its champion to enter the FCS playoffs, while the MEAC dropped its automatic bid to the FCS playoffs in order to send its champion to the Celebration Bowl. The game is organized by ESPN Events, which also runs the MEAC/SWAC Challenge, the annual interconference game between the two conferences, held over Labor Day weekend in Orlando, Florida. The Celebration Bowl was sponsored by the Air Force Reserve for three playings: 2015, 2016, and 2018. In June 2017, the SWAC announced that it would discontinue the SWAC Championship Game following the 2017 playing, resulting in the SWAC regular season champion automatically qualifying for the Celebration Bowl. However, in June 2018, the SWAC reversed course and continues to hold its championship game, with the winner advancing to the Celebration Bowl. Due to the MEAC cancelling all fall athletics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the SWAC following suit postponing its football season to spring 2021, it was announced that the 2020 Celebration Bowl had been cancelled. ==Game results== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#FE5A1D; color:white; border: 2px solid blue;\"|Date ! style=\"background:#FE5A1D; color:white; border: 2px solid blue;\" colspan=\"2\" | MEAC Team ! style=\"background:#FE5A1D; color:white; border: 2px solid blue;\" colspan=\"2\" | SWAC Team ! style=\"background:#FE5A1D; color:white; border: 2px solid blue;\"|Attendance ! style=\"background:#FE5A1D; color:white; border: 2px solid blue;\"|Series ! style=\"background:#FE5A1D; color:white; border: 2px solid blue;\"|Notes |- | December 19, 2015 | style=|' || 41' || Alcorn State Braves || 34|| 35,528 || MEAC, 1\u20130 || notes |- | December 17, 2016 || North Carolina Central Eagles || 9 | style=|' || 10|| 31,096 || tied, 1\u20131 || notes |- | December 16, 2017 | style=|' || 21'|| Grambling State Tigers ||14|| 25,873 || MEAC, 2\u20131 || notes |- | December 15, 2018 | style=|' || 24 || Alcorn State Braves || 22 || 31,672 || MEAC, 3\u20131 || notes |- | December 21, 2019 | style=|' || 64'|| Alcorn State Braves || 44 || 32,968 || MEAC, 4\u20131 || notes |} ==MVPs== Tarik Cohen was the Offensive MVP of the 2015 game.
