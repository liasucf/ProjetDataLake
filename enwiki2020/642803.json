    "text": "Kedron of Alexandria, also called Kedronos, was the 4th Patriarch of Alexandria. When the priest and Bishops who served in the country learned that the Bishop Avilius, Patriarch of Alexandria had died, they gathered in Alexandria to consult with the Christian people there, and elected Kedronos as successor. It was said that he was among those who had been baptized by Saint Mark, and he was enthroned Patriarch in Babab (October), in 96 AD, during the reign of the Emperor . Kedron was arrested and martyred in the persecution under the Emperor Trajan. It was said that the reason for the arrest was that one of the Roman governors had said to him, \u201cWhy do you not have our gods partake with your God and continue to worship him?\" So he answered, \u201cBecause we do not prostrate before any other.\u201d His martyrdom took place on the 21st of Paoni (28 June), in 106 AD. Kedron was known as chaste and virtuous. He led the Church for eleven years, one month, and twelve days. == References == ;General * *Atiya, Aziz S. The Coptic Encyclopedia.
