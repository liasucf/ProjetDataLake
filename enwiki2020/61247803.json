Since 1996 he had been accused of sexually abusing many women, including his daughter. ==Biography== Sk\u00falason was born in Birtingaholt in Hrunamannahreppur, Iceland, the son of Sk\u00fali Oddleifsson and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir. After graduating from the University of Iceland in 1955, he was ordained priest for service to the Icelandic congregation in Mountain, North Dakota. In 1960 , he was appointed as the first youth representative of the National Church and in 1964 became pastor of B\u00fasta\u00f0arkirkja in Reykjavik. In 1975 he was appointed a Dean in Reykjavik. In 1983 he was appointed and consecrated Bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt and suffragan to the Bishop of Iceland. In 1989 he was elected Bishop of Iceland. His time as bishop saw a great transformation towards more independence for the National Church. The highlight of these changes was the law (on the status, government and practice of the National Church), where the Church was granted the right to decide on the issues that concerned it. At the time, he was also a board member of the Lutheran World Federation and chaired the administration of the Ecumenical Organisation in Strasbourg . ==Sexual abuse== During his tenure, a series of sexual abuse scandals related to priests, as well as accusations against \u00d3lafur himself, started to come out, whereby he was accused of sexually abusing numerous women. At that time the scandals were kept in secrecy and dismissed by the church.\"In Focus: Icelandic National Church\u2019s Council of Specialists & Sexual Violence\", Iceland Review, Reykjavik, 23 September 2017.

However, after his death, in 2010 his daughter Gu\u00f0r\u00fan Ebba \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir attended the Church Council and disclosed that \u00d3lafur had sexually abused her for many years.Kjartansd\u00f3ttir, K. \"Biskup: \u00c6\u00f0ri d\u00f3mst\u00f3lar fara yfir m\u00e1l s\u00e9ra \u00d3lafs\", V\u00edsir.is, Reykjavik, 20 August 2010.
