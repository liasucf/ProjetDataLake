    "text": "Wacken is a municipality near the town of Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Wacken was first mentioned in 1148, but there were probably some settlements before, which is proven by the trove of Germanic artefacts. Today, Wacken is famous for annually staging the world's biggest open air heavy metal festival, \"Wacken Open Air\", which has hosted popular metal acts such as Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Saxon, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Slayer, Rammstein, Mot\u00f6rhead and Judas Priest, as well as local and perennial regulars, including Subway to Sally and Wacken's Firefighters' band. Every citizen gets free entry to the festival. The first main economical income of the village is farming. The second is the W:O:A festival. In 2007, every citizen - from infants to oldest patrons - made an average net profit of about 7,000 \u20ac due supporting, catering and merchandising at Wacken Open Air. The festival is held in July and August, a period which often has stormy weather in that area. Wacken is infamous for its unpredictable and rapid changing weather conditions during the festival. Sun blocker as well as rubber boots are appropriate. Temperatures from +8 to +40 \u00b0C might be expected. During a longer rain period the festival venue gets really muddy and the green of the meadows vanishes in festival infields. Two weeks before each and a week during festival the entire village turns into huge construction or restrained area. Many venues get caged and streets are restricted. In recent years about up to 25,000 tourists went every day to the village during festival without tickets. Due to the festival the entry sign to the village is frequently a victim of road sign theft. == References == == External links == The town's official website Category:Steinburg ",
