    "text": "The 2019 Canadian Championship Final was a two-legged series to determine the winner of the 2019 Canadian Championship, Canada's primary domestic cup competition in men's soccer. The series was played between Canadian Classique rivals Montreal Impact and Toronto FC, both members of Major League Soccer. It was the third time Montreal and Toronto have met in the finals since the cup format was adopted in 2011; with the Impact winning in 2014, and Toronto winning in 2017. The first leg was hosted by the Impact at Saputo Stadium in Montreal on September 18, while the second leg was played at BMO Field in Toronto on September 25. Montreal Impact won their fourth title and first since 2014, following a 3\u20131 victory on penalties after both legs finished 1\u20130 to the home side. As winners, Montreal qualified for the 2020 CONCACAF Champions League as Canada's sole direct entrant. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Team !League !City !Previous finals appearances (bold indicates winners) |- |Montreal Impact |Major League Soccer |Montreal, Quebec |4 (2013, 2014, 2015, 2017) |- |Toronto FC |Major League Soccer |Toronto, Ontario |6 (2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018) |} ==Venues== ==Background== This was the third time Montreal Impact and Toronto FC faced one another in the Canadian Championship final.
