    "text": "Two Strong Hearts Live is a live album by John Farnham and Olivia Newton-John recorded in Melbourne with Philharmonia Australia in April 2015. The live album was released on 16 June 2015 with the live DVD being released on 21 August 2015. ==Critical reception== Cameron Adams gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, \"John Farnham and Olivia Newton-John have a chemistry and friendship you just can\u2019t fake. And zero egos. The fact these two were having serious fun is not lost in the recorded translation. You also see new sides, like Farnham blitzing 'Over the Rainbow' and Livvie cutting loose with rock wailing on 'Hit the Road Jack'. That\u2019s another one of the joys here, we rarely get to hear Olivia live and from the divine thrills of 'Xanadu' to the spine chills of I Honestly Love You it\u2019s our loss. On the Grease favourites 'Summer Nights' and 'You\u2019re the One That I Want', Farnham slips into John Travolta mode [and] Farnham sings 'Olivia Newton-John' better than ONJ\u2019s original duet partner Cliff Richard\". == Track listing == # \"Overture\u201d # \"Two Strong Hearts\" # \"Let Me Be There\" # \"Xanadu\" # \"I Honestly Love You\" # \"Tenterfield Saddler\" # \"No One Comes Close\" # \"Love to Shine\" # \"Suddenly\" # \"Dare to Dream\" # \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" # \"Burn for You\" # \"Hit the Road Jack / Fever\" # \"You're the One That I Want\" # \"Summer Nights\" # \"Hearts on Fire\" # \"If Not for You\" # \"Everytime You Cry\" # \"Physical\" # \"You're the Voice\" # \"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\" ==Charts== Two Strong Hearts Live debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Charts. This is the second time Farnham and Newton-John had topped the charts together; in 1998, their Highlights from The Main Event album (with Anthony Warlow) also peaked at No. 1. {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2015) !Peak position |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 31 |- |} ==Certifications== ==See also== * List of number-one albums of 2015 (Australia) ==References== Category:2015 live albums Category:Live video albums Category:John Farnham live albums Category:Olivia Newton-John live albums Category:Collaborative albums Category:Sony Music Australia albums ",
