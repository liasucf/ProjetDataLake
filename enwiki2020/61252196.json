    "text": "== Rabbi David Elimelech Tzanger == David Elimelech Tzanger (born Nowy Sacz, Poland 1880-1962) was a rabbi and Hasidic personality in his native Poland, Canada and Israel. Tzanger was born to parents Isaac Pinchus and Hinda Rechel Tzanger (n\u00e9e Kirshbaum), who were followers of the Tsanz Hasidic sect. He was a disciple of the first Bobover Rebbe - Reb Shlomo Halberstam. He was originally trained as a ritual slaughterer, however due to his extreme piety and knowledge of Jewish law he was designated as the Krakower (Crakow) Rebbe by the then Bobover Rebbe Ben Zion Halberstam. This was a prestigious position as the city of Cracow was a major centre of Hasidic Judaism. Tzanger was then sent to Canada to lead the Hasidic community there and finally to Israel where he led a community of hasidic Jews in Tel Aviv. Tzanger was buried on the Har Hamenuchot in recognition of his contribution to Judaism.The forgotten hasidim: Rabbis and rebbes in Prewar Canada == Radomsk == On the eve of World War II, Radomsk was the third largest Hasidic dynasty in Poland, after Ger and Aleksander.
