    "text": "\"Devu\u00e9lveme a mi chica\" is a song by the Spanish pop rock band, Hombres G. It originally appeared on their debut album, Hombres G (1985). The song was released as a single and was commercially successful. It was also an international hit. It is one of the group's most popular songs and remains significant in rock en espa\u00f1ol and 1980s Spanish music, being ranked among VH1's \"Las 100 + Grandiosas Canciones En Espa\u00f1ol\". The song is popularly known as \"Sufre, mam\u00f3n\", due to the chorus catchphrase. ==Lyrical content== A 1984 model of a white Ford Fiesta, which is mentioned in the song. The song's narrator describes the dread he feels as he witnesses the romantic encounter between a girl and a boy. The boy travels in a white Ford Fiesta and wears a yellow jersey; the narrator derides him as preppy and a sissy (\"pijo\" and \"marica\" in Spanish, respectively). The narrator demands that the boy return his \"chick\" or that otherwise he will fall victim to \"polvos picapica\" (In Spanish, polvos picapica are a variety of leaves and powders which cause a large amount of itching upon coming in contact with the skin.) The narrator proceeds to burn the boy's jersey. To his dismay, the boy buys five or six more. Consequently, the narrator makes plans to destroy the boy's car. He announces that the boy will die and that the girl will return to him. The lyrics of the song have been described as defying the clich\u00e9 model of masculinity. Instead of chronicling a violent and physical encounter, the narrator uses an unexpected and mischievous method to take revenge: itchy powders. ==Release== The song was originally released as a single in Spain, in 1985. When it was released internationally, it faced scrutiny because of its lyrics, and was censored in M\u00e9xico. ==Track listing== Devu\u00e9lveme a mi chica #\"Devu\u00e9lveme a mi chica\" - 3:16 #\"Nassau\" - 4:41 ==Chart history== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Provider(s) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- | Spanish Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|Radio Luz (RR) Alcazar de S.Juan |align=\"center\"|1 |- |} ==Personnel== Hombres G * David Summers - lead vocals, bass * Rafa Gutierrez - guitar * Daniel Mezquita - guitar * Javier Molina - drums ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Discography * Hombres G: Albums, Songs, Bios, Photos at Amazon.com Category:1985 singles Category:Hombres G songs Category:Number-one singles in Spain Category:1985 songs ",
