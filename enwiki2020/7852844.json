    "text": "Peps Persson (born 20 December 1946 in Klippan) is a Swedish blues and reggae musician from Tj\u00f6rnarp, Scania. Throughout his career he has mostly made music in Swedish and is well known for his Scanian dialect. At an earlier stage he made a few albums in English. ==Career== Persson's career up to 1975 was mostly inspired by the blues, and he's known for having reworked many famous blues and reggae tunes into Swedish, by such artists as Muddy Waters, Elmore James and Bob Marley. After 1975, his career turned away from the blues and focused mostly on reggae. Some of his songs, like \"Falsk matematik\" and \"H\u00f6g standard\", made a political statement, and were considered part of the progg movement. ==Discography== ===Solo career=== *1968 - Blues Connection *1969 - Sweet Mary Jane *1972 - The Week Peps Came to Chicago *1975 - Blues p\u00e5 svenska *1980 - Rotrock *1984 - En del och andra *1992 - Oh Boy ===Peps Perssons Blodsband=== *1974 - Blodsband *1975 - H\u00f6g Standard *1976 - Droppen Urholkar Stenen *1978 - Sp\u00e5r *1988 - Fram med pengarna! *1993 - Spelar f\u00f6r livet *1994 - R\u00f6ster fr\u00e5n S\u00f6dern *1997 - Rotblos *2005 - \u00c4ntligen! ===With Pelle Perssons Kapell=== *1977 - Fyra tunnlann bedor om dan *1982 - Persson sjonger Persson! ===Compilations=== *1993 - Bitar 1968-1992 *2006 - Oh Boy: Det B\u00e4sta Med Peps Persson == External links == *Progg.se - Peps Persson == References == Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Helsingborg Category:Swedish male musicians Category:Swedish reggae musicians Category:Swedish-language singers ",
