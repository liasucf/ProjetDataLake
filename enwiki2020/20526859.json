He fulfilled his military obligation as a lieutenant in the United States Army from 1961 until 1963, stationed on a Nike Site in Denbigh, Virginia, being discharged as a Captain in the reserves in 1965.

Bush of his intention to take senior status effective January 31, 2009. However, word did not become public of his decision until November 2008. Anderson told a local newspaper that he still planned to work \"almost full-time\" but that he hoped to take more vacation time\u2014probably four to six weeks a year\u2014to visit grandchildren in New York and Connecticut. And while Anderson could have taken senior status in November 2001, he chose not to do so, he told the paper, because \"I was having so much fun, I didn't want to.\" ==Cases and controversies== In 1986, Anderson became the subject of an impeachment drive after a three-judge panel on which he sat ordered retrials for several convicted murderers because, they ruled, pretrial publicity had unfairly tainted their trials.

In 2004, Anderson dissented when the 11th circuit refused to rehear a case. The majority had ruled in favor of a law banning LGBTQ couples from adopting children. The vote was 6-6, which warranted a denial of en banc. Anderson's dissent was joined by Judge Dubina. https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/educational-magazines/lofton-v- secretary-florida-department-children-and-families In 2008, Anderson described himself as a judicial \"moderate,\" and added that he \"would like to be thought of as a judge who had no particular agenda and who took each case on the facts and applied the law that the Supreme Court laid down,\" regardless of his own personal view on it. \"And I think that's what I attempt to do, and I think every judge on our court does.\" ==References== == External links == * Category:1936 births Category:20th-century American judges Category:Georgia (U.S. state) lawyers Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Category:Living people Category:People from Macon, Georgia Category:United States Army officers Category:United States court of appeals judges appointed by Jimmy Carter Category:Yale University alumni Category:Military personnel from Georgia (U.S. state) ",
