    "text": "The H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society or HPLHS is the organization that hosts Cthulhu Lives!, a group of live-action roleplayers for the Cthulhu Live version of Call of Cthulhu. Founded in Colorado in 1984, it is now based in Glendale, California. Their motto is Ludo Fore Putavimus (\"We thought it would be fun\"). HPLHS produces a number of Cthulhu Mythos films, including the eponymous The Call of Cthulhu, as well as sound recordings, under its Mythoscope and Mythophone labels, respectively. They also offer props, both for sale and for free download. Originally a hobbyist group, HPLHS has become a for profit company dedicated to creating content faithful to the spirit of the Gothic 1920s source material but leavening it with some humour. ==Productions== ===Printed work=== *Strange Eons** (1986-1990) *The Spirit of Revision - Lovecraft's Letters to Zealia Brown Reed Bishop (2015) *A Shoggoth on the Roof Libretto (2005) *Miskatonic University Monographs **Archeological Interpretations of Myth Patterns in the Iconography of the Codex Beltr\u00e1n- Escavy **The Curious Sea Shanty Variants of Innsmouth, Mass. ===Audio=== The H.P.
