Johann Nikolaus G\u00f6tz (July 9, 1721 in Worms \u2013 November 4, 1781 in Winterburg near Bad Kreuznach) was a German poet from Worms. ==Biography== He studied theology at Halle (1739\u20131742), where he became intimate with the poets Johann W. L. Gleim and Johann Peter Uz, acted for some years as military chaplain, and afterwards filled various other ecclesiastical offices. He died at Winterburg. ==Works== Haydn Die Harmonie in der Ehe HobXXVc3 The writings of G\u00f6tz consist of a number of short lyrics and several translations, of which a rendering of Anacreon is notable. His original compositions are light, lively and sparkling, and are animated rather by French wit than by German depth of sentiment. The best known of his poems is Die M\u00e4dcheninsel, an elegy which met with the warm approval of Frederick the Great. Other works were Thamire an die Rosen and An eine Romansleserin. G\u00f6tz's Vermischte Gedichte were published with biography by K. W. Ramler (Mannheim, 1785; new ed., 1807), and a collection of his poems, dating from the years 1745\u20131765, has been edited by C. Sch\u00fcddekopf in the Deutsche Literaturdenkmale des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts (1893). See also Briefe von und an J. N. G\u00f6tz, edited by C. Sch\u00fcddekopf (1893). ==References== * Category:1721 births Category:1781 deaths Category:German poets Category:People from Worms, Germany Category:German male poets Category:German-language poets ",
