    "text": "Ladislaus Nevnai (; died after 1324) was a Hungarian nobleman and landowner in Slavonia at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. Through his daughters, he was an ancestor of the powerful Treutel and Garai families. ==Biography== Ladislaus originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) P\u00e9c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. He belonged to the so- called Ludbreg sub-branch, founded by his grandfather George P\u00e9c. His father was Serfesd, who was referred with the surname Nevnai after his residence Nevna (or N\u00e9vna), present-day Levanjska Varo\u0161 in Croatia. His uncles were Denis P\u00e9c, a powerful baron and Palatine of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century, and Peter Ludbregi, who owned Ludbreg.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) Nevnai first appears in contemporary records in 1284. He married Yolanda K\u00f3r\u00f3gyi, who came from an influential noble family.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (K\u00f3r\u00f3gyi family) She is mentioned by a sole document in 1290, when she was granted the castle of Orjava (today Orljavac, Croatia) from her father Gregory K\u00f3r\u00f3gyi. Nevnai held estates in Valk\u00f3 and Pozsega Counties, and was considered one of the richest landowners of the region. He fathered two daughters, Catherine and an unidentified girl. Their marriages to Nicholas Treutel and Andrew Garai, respectively, have prompted the rise of the Treutel kinship and the Palatinal branch of the Garai family. Nevnai's grandsons, among others, were the powerful barons Nicholas Garai and John Treutel.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus Dorozsma 4. Garai [Palatinal] branch)Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Treutel kinship 1. Treutel de Nevna family) Nevnai handed over his estate of Nevna to his son-in-law Nicholas Treutel in 1324. It is presumable, he died shortly thereafter without male descendants, ending the Nevnai family line after two generations. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people Category:P\u00e9c (genus) ",
