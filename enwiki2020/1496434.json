    "text": "The Prince's Building () is an office tower with a 6-levels shopping centre, known as Landmark Prince's. Located along the western side of the southern section of Statue Square in Central, Hong Kong, the building is connected to Alexandra House and Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong by pedestrian bridges. ==First generation== The first Prince's Building was a four-storey Renaissance architecture building in 1904 on land created from the Chater reclamation,http://gwulo.com/node/2640?page=1 located directly south of Queen's Building, completed in 1899. The building was designed by Leigh & Orange and had similarities with the Hong Kong Club Building built in 1897. It was replaced by the present building in 1965.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Hongkong-Land-Holdings- Limited-Company-History.html The first building housed several bank and law firm offices including: * Yokohama Specie Bank * Bank of Taiwan * Banque de l'Indochine * Deacons * Johnson Stokes & Master ==Second generation== In 1963 the first building was demolished to make way for the current Prince's Building. It was designed by architecture firm Palmer & Turner. The 29 floor complex is an office and retail complex and is owned by Hongkong Land. In 1965, Hongkong Land constructed the first air-conditioned pedestrian bridge in Hong Kong, connecting Prince's Building to The Mandarin Hotel. This concept was later adapted by other developers, and formed the Central Elevated Walkway system. The 6-level retail podium, now known as Landmark Prince's, houses flagship stores of luxury brands including Cartier, Chanel, Van Cleef & Arpels, Herm\u00e8s and Vacheron Constantin. Landmark Prince's is also famous for smaller upmarket boutique style shops on its 2/F and 3/F; these two retail floors are branded as \"LANDMARK HOME & KIDS\". Tenants of the office tower include Mayer Brown JSM, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The complex borders Statue Square, which it surrounds together with Hong Kong Club Building, Old Supreme Court Building, Mandarin Oriental (former site of Queen's Building) and HSBC Main Building. ==See also== * King's Building * Alexandra House * The Landmark * Hongkong Land * Statue Square ==References== ==External links== * Building's page on Hongkong Land's website (archive) Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Hong Kong Category:Shopping centres in Hong Kong Category:Central, Hong Kong Category:Hongkong Land ",
