    "text": "The Action lib\u00e9rale nationale (ALN, in English: National Liberal Action) was a short-lived provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. It was founded during the Great Depression and led by Paul Gouin. The ALN played an important role in the foundation of the Union Nationale.Patricia G. Dirks, The Failure of L'Action Lib\u00e9rale Nationale, , McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Montreal, 1991. ==Origin and beliefs== The party was created in 1934 by dissidents from the Liberal Party of Quebec. It soon received the support of federal Liberal Member of Parliament \u00c9douard Lacroix and Liberal Member of the Legislature Oscar Drouin. The ALN promoted social justice, nationalism and was not affiliated to any federal party. Its platform included the following proposals:Paul Gouin (1898-1976), Claude B\u00e9langer, Marianopolis College, 1997-2006 * Farm credit; * Voluntary migration from cities to rural areas; * Rural electrification; * Nationalization of electricity; * Corporativism; * Electoral reform; Its ideology was influenced by the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. ==Electoral breakthrough== In order to unite the vote against the Liberal government of Alexandre Taschereau, the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale (ALN) and the Conservative Party of Quebec decided to run only one candidate of either party in each district for the 1935 Quebec election. With 29% of the vote, the ALN elected 26 out of 57 candidates; the Conservatives received 19% of the vote and won 16 seat out of 33 in which they ran a candidate.Bilan du Si\u00e8cle, 1934: Manifeste de l'Action lib\u00e9rale nationale ==Decline== Less than a year later, Conservative Leader Maurice Duplessis, a rising star in provincial politics, tried to pressure ALN Leader Paul Gouin into merging both parties. While Gouin cuts ties with Duplessis, 22 of his Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) joined the new party, known as Union Nationale, which won the 1936 Quebec election. Gouin did not run for re-election to the legislature in 1936. ALN MNAs Vital Cliche, Wilfrid-Eld\u00e8ge Lauriault and Frederick Arthur Monk ran for re-election as Independents. None of them were elected. Cliche ran as an Action lib\u00e9rale nationale candidate in a by-election held on March 17, 1937, in his home district of Beauce. He was defeated. The ALN opposed conscription and contested the 1939 Quebec election. Other than Gouin who took the leadership, the party was unable to attract any of its former candidates from the 1935 election. Instead Ren\u00e9 Chaloult and Oscar Drouin, who had grown disillusioned with Duplessis after they joined the Union Nationale, ran as Liberal candidates. The party won only 4.5% of the vote and none of its 56 candidates were elected. It disappeared soon after. ==Legacy== Even though the ALN did not survive the 1930s political realignment in Quebec politics, many of its policies were eventually implemented by the provincial governments of Maurice Duplessis, Ad\u00e9lard Godbout and Jean Lesage. == Election results == {| border=\"1\" |----- | align=\"center\" | General election | align=\"center\" | # of candidates | align=\"center\" | # of seats won | align=\"center\" | % of popular vote |----- | align=\"center\" | 1935 || align=\"center\" | 57 | align=\"center\" | 26 || align=\"center\" | 29.57% |----- | align=\"center\" | 1936 | align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" | No candidates ran under the ALN label in 1936. |----- | align=\"center\" | 1939 || align=\"center\" | 56 | align=\"center\" | 0 || align=\"center\" | 4.53% |} == See also == * Politics of Quebec * Quebec general elections * List of Quebec premiers * List of Quebec leaders of the Opposition * National Assembly of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * Political parties in Quebec ==Notes== == External links == * National Assembly historical information * La Politique qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise sur le Web Category:Political parties established in 1934 Category:Defunct provincial political parties in Quebec Category:Political parties disestablished in 1939 Category:1934 establishments in Quebec Category:1939 disestablishments in Quebec ",
