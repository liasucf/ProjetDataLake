Theoskepasti church, due to its position, could easily be discerned by invading Arabs, during their raids. However, according to a legend the church was veiled with dark clouds of fog and rendered invisible as soon as the Saracens approached it. Due to this legend the church got the name \"Theoskepasti\" from the Greek words \"Theos\" and \"skepazo\" which mean \"God\" and \"to veil\" respectively. So, the name is 'Veiled by God'. According to another tradition, when once a Saracen managed to enter the church and tried to steal the golden candle, divine power cut off his hands. ==The New Church== The present-day Panagia Theoskepasti church was built on the foundations of the older Byzantine church in 1923. The architecture of the previous church was preserved. A full restoration of the present-day church was completed in March 2009.Restoration of Theoskepasti church http://www.minasmina.com/PROJECTS/Pages/theoskepasti.htm ==Important exhibits== Precious portable icons are kept at Theoskepasti Church.
