    "text": "Claude-Gaspard Bachet Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus' Arithmetica, translated into Latin by Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac. Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac (9 October 1581 \u2013 26 February 1638) was a French mathematician, linguist, poet and classics scholar born in Bourg-en- Bresse, at that time belonging to Duchy of Savoy. Bachet was a pupil of the Jesuit mathematician Jacques de Billy at the Jesuit College in Rheims. They became close friends. Bachet wrote the Probl\u00e8mes plaisants, of which the first edition was issued in 1612, a second and enlarged edition was brought out in 1624; this contains an interesting collection of arithmetical tricks and questions, many of which are quoted in W. W. Rouse Ball's Mathematical Recreations and Essays. He also wrote Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments arithm\u00e9tiques, which exists in manuscript; and a translation, from Greek to Latin, of the Arithmetica of Diophantus (1621). It was this very translation in which Fermat wrote his famous margin note claiming that he had a proof of Fermat's last theorem. The same text renders Diophantus' term \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u1f40\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 as adaequalitat, which became Fermat's technique of adequality, a pioneering method of infinitesimal calculus. Bachet was the earliest writer who discussed the solution of indeterminate equations by means of continued fractions. He also did work in number theory and found a method of constructing magic squares. Some credible sources also name him the founder of the B\u00e9zout's identity.Claude Gaspard Bachet, sieur de M\u00e9ziriac, Probl\u00e8mes plaisants et d\u00e9lectables\u2026 , 2nd ed. (Lyons, France: Pierre Rigaud & Associates, 1624), pp. 18\u201333. On these pages, Bachet proves (without equations) \"Proposition XVIII. Deux nombres premiers entre eux estant donnez, treuver le moindre multiple de chascun d'iceux, surpassant de l'unit\u00e9 un multiple de l'autre.\" (Given two numbers [which are] relatively prime, find the lowest multiple of each of them [such that] one multiple exceeds the other by unity (1).) This problem (namely, ax \u2013 by = 1) is a special case of B\u00e9zout's equation and was used by Bachet to solve the problems appearing on pages 199 ff. For a year in 1601 Bachet was a member of the Jesuit Order. He lived a comfortable life in Bourg-en-Bresse and married in 1612. He was elected member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1635. ==References== * The initial text of this article was taken from the public domain resource A Short Account of the History of Mathematics by W.
