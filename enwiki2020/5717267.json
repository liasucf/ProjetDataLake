    "text": "Andreea B\u0103lan (; born June 23, 1984) is a Romanian pop singer. She made her singing debut on the children's television show, Ba da, ba nu, in 1994. Two years later, she released her debut solo album, Ame\u021bi\u021bi de fum. B\u0103lan earned commercial success as a member of dance duo Andr\u00e8, who released six albums between 1998 and 2001. In 2002, the group was awarded four platinum and one gold record for selling 1.5 million album copies. Andr\u00e8 was influential in bringing platform heels, box braids, mini skirts and push-up bras into fashion. After the breakup of Andr\u00e8, B\u0103lan released another solo album, Te joci cu mine, on June 23, 2002. She has since released five major studio albums and 20 music videos. In 2007, B\u0103lan participated in the show Dancing, where she won the competition. She also placed 2nd in the international version, Dancing Around the World, with dancer partner Petri\u0219or Ruge. Ranked in the top three best-selling Romanian artists in 2008, she was also among the best-selling Romanian artists in terms of concerts. B\u0103lan is recognized as having spectacular shows in Romania, successfully combining music and dance, and showing performances with over ten costume changes. Among other artists, she has worked with Connect-R, Keo, Silviu and Puya. ==Life and career== ===Childhood and early career (1994 - 1998)=== Andreea B\u0103lan was born on June 23, 1984 to S\u0103ndel and Valeria B\u01celan. She was known by those around her during her early years as being a \"very good child\". She attended Ion Luca Caragiale High School in Ploie\u0219ti, passing the Baccalaureate exam in the 12th grade. She began singing at the age of 10, under the guidance of her father. She composed several pieces, with which she participated in a series of performances for children in Ploie\u0219ti. In these recitals, she was noticed by Mihai Constantinescu. B\u0103lan was then invited by him to participate in the children's show, Ba da, ba nu, which was broadcast on the Romanian channel TVR 1. She was later invited to other shows, such as Feri\u021bi-v\u0103 de m\u0103g\u0103ru\u0219, Abracadabra, Video Magazin and Tip Top Mini Top. During this period, she participated in various children's festivals, receiving several awards, with the most notable being the Little Prince International Festival. Attended by children from 16 countries, B\u0103lan was given the \"Little Princess of Europe\" award, presented by the then President of Romania, Emil Constantinescu. Negotiations were made for her to form a group with Simona Nae, but the plans never materialized following disagreements between their parents. In 1997, B\u0103lan took part in Eurovision's National Gala, performing \"Un univers mai lini\u0219tit\", but was disqualified because she did not fit the age criteria. The following year, B\u0103lan became the first child to release an album on a compact disc in Romania. The album, Ame\u021bi\u021bi de fum, contained 10 songs composed by her father and dances orchestrated by C\u0103t\u0103lin T\u00eercolea. Although officially released, it was not widely distributed due to a lack of funds. It was claimed to be the first Romanian dance music release, due to songs on the album, such as \"Rezemat de gard\". ===Andr\u00e8 (1999 - 2001)=== Towards the end of 1998, the musical project Andr\u00e8 was born, with members Andreea B\u0103lan and Andreea Antonescu first meeting on the program Ba da, ba nu. Although member Gigi Antonescu was reluctant to join at first, Andr\u00e8 proved to be a national success, gaining notoriety both within Romania and internationally, with their target audience being teenagers. The songs on their debut album, La \u00eent\u00e2lnire, were made mostly by S\u0103ndel B\u0103lan. The album included the song \"Un univers mai lini\u0219tit,\" known in other countries as \"Iluzii\", which was previously performed by B\u0103lan at Eurovision. Their debut album was released in May 1999 and proved to be a commercial success, selling over 50,000 copies by that September. The group gained major popularity due to their simple musical style and rhythmic beats. To promote the album, they performed \"La \u00eent\u00e2lnire\", \"S\u0103 ne distr\u0103m\" and \"Nu m\u0103 uita\" on numerous television shows, but none of the songs featured music videos. Their first single earned success on radio stations, despite the radio's lack of support for Romanian musicians. In the summer of 1999, the song \"Liber\u0103 la mare\" was released, and became a signature song for the group. The song was played during several occasions, including the Mamaia's Festival, where the song won 1st place, with B\u0103lan becoming the youngest singer to win the award. At the end of that year, the album \"Noapte de vis\" was released, and was promoted with the song \"Noapte de vis (Mo\u0219ule, ce t\u00e2n\u0103r e\u0219ti)\", along with a video for the song. \"Noapte de vis\" was named number 16 in the \"Top 20 after 90\", a ranking organized by Kiss FM and \"Click\" magazine, based on public voting. In 2008, \"Liber\u0103 la mare\" was ranked in the top 29 television made U TV entitled \"Top 100 songs that Romania had broken in two\". Andr\u00e8 released their third album, Prima iubire, in 2000, promoted with the singles \"Prima iubire\" and \"Las\u0103-m\u0103 papa la mare\", both Top 20 hits in Romania. \"Las\u0103- m\u0103 papa la mare\" was named No. 19 in the \"Top 20 after 90\", a ranking organized by Kiss FM and Click magazine, based on public voting. Andr\u00e8 released their next album, Am s\u0103-mi fac de cap, in 2000, which was promoted with the songs \"Am s\u0103-mi fac de cap\" and \"Flori de tei\" as well as their respective music videos. The music video for \"Flori de tei\" became the most expensive video ever made Romania at the time, with a budget of US$12,000, as well as the first music video shot on film. In early 2001, the magazine Bravo awarded the distinction of \"Best band for teens\" to Andr\u00e8. Cat Music rewarded the group with five platinum and one gold certifications for the 1.5 million albums sold, calling their music \"princesses dance music\", and becoming the first group and the only with these awards. The group split shortly because of disagreements. B\u0103lan continued her career by forming a duo with Alina Sorescu. Although they had a number of television appearances, the project ended after six months without releasing an album or a video. At the same time, a greatest hits album was released for Andr\u00e8, named Andr\u00e8 - The Best Of. The group met after the death of the father of Andreea Antonescu, whose last wish was that the group reunite. The group released a duo album, O noapte \u0219i-o zi, in 2001 as well as a single of the same name accompanied by a video, but split again. B\u0103lan consequently denied any chance of a reconciliation work between the two, considering only a possible duet. Throughout her career alongside Antonescu, the two were heavily criticized for the fashion style and image they promoted. The two had a great influence on the young, bringing platform heels, box braids, mini skirts and as well as push-up bras that highlighted their breasts, into fashion. This fashion has been heavily criticized for their vulgarity and for influencing girls with their frivolous image. The two performers were also constantly the attention of tabloid newspapers that published rumors of their quarrels. ===Solo career (2002 - 2007)=== On June 23, 2002, B\u0103lan released her second solo album Te joci cu mine, which was released under the label Cat Music and distributed by Media Services. The album contains the song \"Te joci cu mine\", originally composed for Andr\u00e8. The song was promoted and ranked lowest of the Romanian Top 100. No other singles were promoted on the album. Between June and September of the same year, over 30,000 copies of \"You Play With Me\" were distributed. The success of this album was followed by the release of another album in September, named Liber\u0103 din nou.] Between December 22, 2002 and January 22, 2003, she gave a tour of 14 concerts in the United States. The album included the singles \"Liber\u0103 din nou\" and \"Pl\u00e2ng de dor\". On March 1, 2003, the video for the single \"Pl\u00e2ng de dor\", that would later be available as a maxi single, was filmed. In the following summer, the song \"Nop\u021bi de var\u0103\" was released in the remake album Liber\u0103 din nou. It enjoyed great success on radio, received first place in the \"Best Songs\" category of Mamaia's Festival as voted by viewers. During the same period, B\u0103lan began a collaboration with the band News, a group of 12 instrumentalists, starting a national tour. This collaboration shortly stopped working due to financial problems. B\u0103lan released the album A\u0219a sunt eu in 2004, containing lyrics of a more mature pop rock influence. The album promoted five singles, with three tracks placing on the Romanian Top 100. The singles were released in five separate parts. \"Aparen\u021be\" and \"Oops, eroare\" were each released in 2004, and \"Evadez\", \"Invidia\" and \"O str\u0103in\u0103\" were each released in 2005. This made B\u0103lan one of the few Romanian artists to promote five singles from a single album. The songs on the album are inspired by her life, each covering topics such as fame, life in front of the camera, and failure of love. In 2005, B\u0103lan received a trophy for the best website in the MTV. This website presented a picture of the musician, characterized by black clothes, makeup, and a rebellious attitude, that contrasted with the image B\u0103lan promoted previously. With the album Andreea B, B\u0103lan produced two more singles. The first single was \"Nu \u0219tiu s\u0103 fiu numai pentru tine\" (feat. Keo), which was nominated for the award \"Best Hit - Featuring\" on the Romanian Top Hits. The second single, \"Prinde-m\u0103, aprinde-m\u0103!\", was designated the \"gay song of the year\" in the Gala Gay Awards 2007. \"Prinde-m\u0103, aprinde-m\u0103!\" is the most watched video of the artist on YouTube, with over 2.8 million of hits. ===Dancing and return to dance music (2008 - present)=== B\u0103lan opted to participate in a dance pair in the third season of dance competition television show Dansez pentru tine, broadcast on PRO TV in the spring of 2007. The evolution of the dance pair through the competition was acclaimed by audiences and the jury. B\u0103lan ultimately placed in third place. The dance pair participated in the \"League winners\" season, which was dedicated to the best in the history of the competition and took place in the spring of 2008. B\u0103lan placed first place. Between the two seasons, she was selected to participate in the PRO TV international version of Dansez pentru tine, entitled Dancing Around the World. This competition was held in Mexico, and B\u0103lan participated alongside dance partner Petri\u015for Rudge, her partner during Dansez pentru tine. The pair was ranked in second place, enjoyed great popularity among the Mexican public, and received a contract from EMI Music to record an album. Following her appearance on Dansez pentru tine, her career took her on the rise. Catalin Maruta and Andreea B\u0103lan B\u0103lan was among the best-selling artists in Romania in terms of concerts from 2008 to present in both years, ranking in the top 3.

It was released exclusively on Kiss FM. \"Trippin'\", released in 2010, became one of B\u0103lan's most popular singles released, as well as her first Top 40 hit in the Romanian Top 100 in five years. B\u0103lan performed the song \"Trippin'\" in several events, including the final of Miss Universe Romania in 2010, and at the ninth edition of the Romanian Music Awards. The song contains elements of dance music combined with elements of popcorn, a musical style intensely broadcast on Romanian radio at the time of the song's release. The song \"Like a Bunny\" was released on May 13, 2011 on B\u0103lan's YouTube account, with its music video presenting B\u0103lan in a bathing suit, reminiscent of a Playboy Playmate. On June 8, 2011, B\u0103lan released the song \"Loving\" in collaboration with Andra, Connect-R and Puya. In October 2011, B\u0103lan mentioned that there is a chance of the reunion of Andr\u00e8, since they could not handle a solo career. In 2012, B\u0103lan released the single \"Money Love\".

Presently, B\u0103lan consistently holds concerts around the country. ==Image and musical style== Over her musical career, B\u0103lan has adopted several musical styles and image changes in an attempt to adapt to new trends. Her album Superwoman visibly distanced its musical style from her other recordings of it, containing elements of samba, rock and roll, and jive, and finalizing her image as a soloist dancer. B\u0103lan's choreographies and costumes artist have sometimes been criticized for being too sexual, although in general, her concerts have received positive reviews by both the public and journalists. B\u0103lan has named Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Loredana Groza as singers that she appreciates the most.Andreea in Buftea for the event \"Miscarea inseamna viata\" ==Other aspects== ===Personal life=== In 2004, B\u0103lan moved from her parental home in Ploiesti to Bucharest, where she met Teo P\u0103curar. In 2005, the two were engaged. The couple broke up in 2006 due to disagreements in living arrangements. Shortly after the breakup, B\u0103lan appeared at social events with Keo, who helped her overcome her separation from P\u0103curar. Despite rumors of their separation, B\u0103lan and Keo have denied these rumors. B\u0103lan has completed specialization courses in journalism and philosophy from the Spiru Haret University, Bucharest, citing a desire to have a future career in television. ===Reaction to tabloid newspapers=== B\u0103lan has had a frequent presence in tabloid newspapers. A dispute arose between the singer and TV presenter C\u0103t\u0103lin M\u0103ru\u021b\u0103, on the PRO TV television show Happy Hour in late April 2010. Invited to the show, B\u0103lan presented views critical of newspapers. The conflict continued for a short period, with the two criticizing each other in the press on various occasions, culminating in the blocking of B\u0103lan's appearance in a special edition of the show Dansez pentru tine. ==Discography== ===Albums in Andr\u00e8=== * La \u00cent\u00e2lnire (1999) * Noapte de Vis (1999) * Prima Iubire (2000) * Am S\u0103-mi Fac De Cap (2000) * The Best Of (2001) * O Noapte \u0218i-o Zi (2001) ===Solo albums=== * Te joci cu mine (2002) * Liber\u0103 din nou (2002) * A\u0219a sunt eu (2004) * Andreea B (2006) * SuperWoman (2009) ==Videography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Director ! scope=\"col\" | Album ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 2002 !scope=row| \"Te joci cu mine\" | \u2014 | Te joci cu mine | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2002 !scope=row| \"Liber\u0103 din nou\" | Drago\u0219 Buliga | Liber\u0103 din nou | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2003 !scope=row| \"Pl\u00e2ng de dor\" | Drago\u0219 Buliga | Liber\u0103 din nou | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2003 !scope=row| \"Nop\u021bi de var\u0103\" | \u2014 | Liber\u0103 din nou | style=\"text- align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2004 !scope=row| \"Aparen\u021be\" | \u2014 | A\u0219a sunt eu! | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2004 !scope=row| \"Oops, eroare!\" | \u2014 | A\u0219a sunt eu! | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2005 !scope=row| \"Evadez\" | \u2014 | A\u0219a sunt eu! | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2005 !scope=row| \"Invidia\" | \u2014 | A\u0219a sunt eu! | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2005 !scope=row| \"O str\u0103in\u0103\" | Drago\u0219 Buliga | A\u0219a sunt eu! | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2006 !scope=row| \"Nu \u0219tiu s\u0103 fiu numai pentru tine\" | \u2014 | Andreea B | style=\"text- align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2007 !scope=row| \"Prinde-m\u0103, aprinde-m\u0103!\" | Drago\u0219 Buliga | Andreea B | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2008 !scope=row| \"Baby Get Up and Dance\" | Drago\u0219 Buliga | SuperWoman | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2009 !scope=row| \"SuperWoman\" | Iulian Moga | SuperWoman | style=\"text- align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2009 !scope=row| \"Snow\" | Alex Ceau\u0219u | \u2014 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2010 !scope=row| \"Trippin'\" | Alex Ceau\u0219u | \u2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2011 !scope=row| \"Crazy About You\" | Alex Ceau\u0219u | \u2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2011 !scope=row| \"Like a Bunny\" | Alex Ceau\u0219u | \u2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2012 !scope=row| \"Money Love\" | Alex Ceau\u0219u | \u2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2012 !scope=row| \"M\u0103 doare f\u0103r\u0103 tine\" | Alex Ceau\u0219u | \u2014 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| \u2014 |- | 2013 !scope=row| \"Things u do 2 me\" (feat.
