    "text": "The women's 61 kg powerlifting event at the 2016 Summer Paralympics was contested on 11 September at Riocentro Pavilion 2. Lin Ya-hsuan, representing Chinese Taipei competed in the Games for the fourth consecutive time. The best outcome out of three attempts counted as the final results. The athlete who placed first in each event was allowed a fourth attempt to break the Paralympic or world record. == Records == There are twenty powerlifting events, corresponding to ten weight classes each for men and women. The weight categories were significantly adjusted after the 2012 Games so most of the weights are new for 2016. As a result, no Paralympic record was available for this weight class prior to the competition. The existing world records were as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Record Type !Weight !Country !Venue !Date |- |World record |133 kg | |Toronto |10 August 2015 |- |Paralympic record |align=\"center\"|\u2013 |align=\"center\"|\u2013 |align=\"center\"|\u2013 |align=\"center\"|\u2013 |} == Results == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! rowspan=2| Rank ! rowspan=2 width=305|Name ! rowspan=2 width=50|Body weight (kg) !colspan=4| Attempts (kg) !rowspan=2 width=60| Result (kg) |- ! width=60|1 ! width=60|2 ! width=60|3 ! width=60|4 |- | ||align=left| || 59.13 || 136.0 || 138.0 || 142.0 WR PR || ~~145.0~~ || 142.0 |- | ||align=left| || 60.31 || ~~133.0~~ || 133.0 || 140.0 || \u2013 || 140.0 |- | ||align=left| || 59.32 || 120.0 || 128.0 || ~~134.0~~ || \u2013 || 128.0 |- | 4 ||align=left| || 59.65 || ~~100.0~~ || 100.0 || ~~103.0~~ || \u2013 || 100.0 |- | 5 ||align=left| || 60.40 || ~~100.0~~ || 100.0 || ~~103.0~~ || \u2013 || 100.0 |- | 6 ||align=left| || 60.48 || 75.0 || 80.0 || ~~88.0~~ || \u2013 || 80.0 |- | 7 ||align=left| || 57.83 || 78.0 || ~~81.0~~ || ~~81.0~~ || \u2013 || 78.0 |- | \u2013 ||align=left| || 60.61 || ~~96.0~~ || ~~96.0~~ || ~~101.0~~ || \u2013 || |} == References == * Women's 061 kg Para ",
