    "text": "Chepareria is a town located in West Pokot County, Rift Valley Province of Kenya. Under the Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Chepareria town was named the administrative headquarters of Pokot South Constituency. == Economy of the Rift Valley Province== The highlands provide adequate rainfall for farming and agriculture which is the economic base of the residents of the Rift Valley. Tea from the highlands in the Kericho district enjoy a worldwide reputation, but horticulture is an important part of the district's economy and cattle raising is also practised to a large extent. The full economic potential of the Rift Valley region is, however, far from fully exploited, though the current growth in population and improved education may change this in a near future. People in the province are still mostly rural, but urbanisation is gradually increasing; new cities and towns contain the rural-urban migration and, provided the right policies are instituted, the Rift Valley province will be able to emerge as a national economic and cultural hub. == References == Category:Populated places in West Pokot County ",
