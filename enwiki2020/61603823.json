    "text": "The Forerunner Saga is a trilogy of science fiction novels by Greg Bear, based on the Halo series of video games. The books in the series are Halo: Cryptum (2011), Primordium (2012), and Silentium (2013). The books were released in hardcover, e-book, paperback, and audiobook. Bear was given little restriction on the story of the novel; the Halo universe had not yet been explored in that time period. Cryptum received mixed reviews; some critics liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created, but others disliked the characters, found the plot too slow, and concluded that the novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series. Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo Waypoint, a website that serves as a hub for Halo-related information. Primordium reached number seventeen on the New York Times Bestseller List in Hardcover Fiction. Silentium reached number eight on the New York Times Bestseller List for Hardcover Fiction. ==Background== Greg Bear is the author of The Forerunner Saga. Greg Bear was 343 Industries' first choice to write a trilogy of books based on the history of the Forerunners and another mysterious race known as the Precursors. Bear had been writing a book entitled Hull Zero Three when he was approached to be the trilogy's author. At the first meeting with Bear regarding the book, he was told that it should be a \"classic Greg Bear giant \u2013 in the vein of Eon, Anvil of the Stars and so on\", but inspired by Halo and its extended universe. The book and author were announced on April 6, 2009. 343 Industries' General Manager, Bonnie Ross, stated that the back and forth with Bear made \"the whole experience better\", and was preferable to assigning the author his task with no feedback. Halo franchise development director Frank O'Connor stated, \"The enigma of the Forerunners is really at the heart of the drama and mystery of the Halo universe ... in all the games and the books so far we've only scratched the surface of the terrible events that engulfed the Forerunners and the Galaxy they protected 100,000 years ago\". Although nothing was forced upon Bear in terms of story templates, he had numerous and comprehensive discussions about the history of the Halo universe and the major events of the Forerunner history had already been established through the information hidden in Halo 3. O'Connor said that the book is meant to have a \"hard sci-fi\" feel with a \"hint of space opera, in the mold of Banks, Reynolds and Bear himself.\" The book's cover was designed by Sparth, an artist at 343 Industries known for his \"futuristic vistas\". The artwork was taken directly from art made for Halo 4. O'Connor explained that the cover was intended to \"capture the essence and scope of the book and more importantly, the Forerunner universe.\" The art is supposed to convey \"the sense of wonder that all our main protagonists feel at the scale and scope of Forerunner technology.\" On July 19, 2011, Tor Books revealed the cover, title, and release date of the second book in the Forerunner Saga. On October 12, 2011 the book was completed and submitted to the publisher. On December 28, 2011 the first chapter of the book was made available on the publishers website and chapters 2, 3, and part of 4 were made available on the Halo Waypoint website. Video game website Kotaku was given a five-minute audio clip of the book being read by Tim Dadabo, who voiced the character of 343 Guilty Spark in previous Halo games. At a Comic-Con panel on the Halo Universe, Frank O'Connor stated that the book would have \"resonant connections\" with Halo 4. Bear stated that the interactions of the humans and the Forerunners were some of his favorite parts of the Forerunner trilogy. On April 12, 2013 Tor Books ran a promotion giving away the entire book trilogy to one participant. Greg Bear posted on his site on May 3, 2012 that the third book of the Forerunner trilogy would be released in January and had a working title of Halo: Silentium. The book had its title, first cover and release date announced by Tor Books on July 11, 2012, with a release date of January 8, 2013, for the hardcover, e-book and audio book. On August 25, 2012 Bear stated the book was complete and in revision. On November 8, 2012 Bear stated that he had finished writing the book. Release was later moved off to March 2013 until the release of Halo 4 to avoid revealing any plot details about the game. From February 13, 2013 to the books release, encrypted messages were sent out from the halo waypoint website that allowed fans to unlock additional halo content, and were also included in the paperback and e-book versions. A week before the books release, an excerpt of the first chapter was posted on the publishers website, and the second was on the Halo Waypoint website. Bear used the Forerunner designs and images from the Halo video games as an inspiration, and it showed him there had to be an emphasis on builders within the Forerunner civilization. The books cover was designed by Sparth, in a collaboration with Gabriel Garza, and with design help for the Didact sphere provided by Glenn Israel. ==Synopsis== ===Setting and characters=== The Forerunner Saga takes place approximately 100,000 years before the 26th century setting in the Halo universe, telling the story of the ancient and powerful civilization known as the Forerunners, divided into ranks based on occupations, such as Builders, Warriors, and Lifeworkers. They were preceded by an enigmatic race known as the Precursors. The books revolve around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting, two humans\u2014Chakas and Morning Riser\u2014and other important Forerunners, including the Warrior Didact and Lifeworker Librarian. ===Cryptum=== Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting visits the human planet Erde-Tyrene (Earth), intent on discovering treasures left by the Precursors. With the aid of two human guides, Chakas and Morning Riser, Bornstellar visits a ring island where they find a cryptum\u2014a Forerunner stasis vessel. Inside is the Didact, who after recovering from his hibernation, conscripts Bornstellar, Chakas, and Riser on an interstellar quest given to him by the Librarian. Bornstellar learns that the Forerunners fought a war with humankind 10,000 years prior. After their defeat, the Librarian saved the human race from extinction (they were instead stripped of their technology) and planted a genetic command known as a \"geas\" in them, the cause of Chakas and Riser's subconscious knowledge that led Bornstellar to the Didact. The Didact and his makeshift crew travel to an ancient Precursor planet, Charum Hakkor, where humans had once also settled. The Didact is disturbed to find that many of the Precursor structures on the planet, thought indestructible, have fallen into ruin. The Didact also discovers that a prisoner, protected by Precursor and human containment methods, has escaped. They travel to the nearby planet of Faun Hakkor, another formerly human-settled world, to find it stripped of all sentient life. The Didact sponsors Bornstellar's first mutation\u2014a vital part of Forerunner growth\u2014imprinting his personality, tactics, and memories upon Bornstellar. The Didact's party are captured and imprisoned by Forerunner Builders, under the command of Faber, the Master Builder. Bornstellar is returned to the care of his father because of his family's status and power. Bornstellar learns his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos\u2014massive ringworld weapons. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such weapons, leading to his exile. Bornstellar is called to the Forerunner Capital to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial. He stands accused of crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else. Just as the trial is about to begin, the Forerunner artificial intelligence Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and attempts to assume control of the Halos and use them against the Capital. In the ensuing battle several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs enacting failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape and is recovered by the Librarian and her Lifeworkers. The Librarian informs Bornstellar that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner on Charum Hakkor was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate them; the Timeless One seeks revenge. ===Primordium=== Primordium is told through flashbacks, with a damaged Forerunner AI recovered by a human crew. This Forerunner AI, 343 Guilty Spark, was once the human Chakas, and relates his tale through flashbacks. After Chakas, Riser, Bornstellar, and the Didact were taken prisoner by The Master Builder, Chakas and Riser ended up on the Halo ring known as Installation 07. Chakas is also carrying the imprint of Forthencho, a human general during the Human-Forerunner war. Chakas befriends Vinnevra and her grandfather Gamelpar and the three of them proceed to follow Vinnevra's geas to find a safe place. Unbeknown to them, the installation\u2019s beacon had been reset and they now head towards The Primordial\u2019s lair - The Palace of Pain. They soon reach their destination and witness the Primordial guiding all the humans who had followed their geas to the Palace of Pain. After witnessing The Primordial, they decide to head in the opposite direction and after a long journey they reach the shores of an ocean. There they find a ruined city with Forerunner corpses and a Gravemind locked in a cell pleading for death and freedom. After crossing the ocean, the trio are found by a Lifeworker who accompanies them with several other humans and a giant ape named Mara. While sleeping at night in the refugee center, Chakas is greeted by Riser who warns him not to trust the Lifeworker. Later it is revealed everyone except the three of them are illusions cast by the monitors who are there to extract their spirits and store them as monitors. After breaking out of the illusion they are joined by Riser while Gamelpar dies due to old age. Forthencho converses with the spirit of Yprin Yprikushma within Riser who was responsible for excavating Precursor ruins and moving the Primordial to Charum Hakkor, which Forthencho has disapproved of. The group is finally brought to The Palace of Pain by a transport, where they are greeted by Mendicant Bias. The spirits within all humans are extracted and Mendicant Bias promises them revenge on Forerunners. Those who oppose are killed. Forthencho lies to Bias that Chakas has agreed to help them and they are transported to the Silent Cartographer. As Halo is on a collision course with a nearing planet they try to save it by interfacing Chakas through an infected Forerunner into Halo's system. A fleet led by the Didact then appears from the other side of the planet and the Didact purges Mendicant Bias from Installation 07. Chakas then merges with the Didact to move the halo through a portal. To do so, however, the halo must drop several pieces of itself, thus reducing its diameter to its current size. The Halo survives and Chakas and The Didact visit The Primordial, who has been imprisoned in a reverse time capsule (which speeds up time experienced within enclosure). He reveals that Precursors have decided Forerunners are not meant to inherit the Mantle (they have failed their test), but humans have been selected to be tested now instead; once Forerunners are eliminated, humans will be tested by Flood to check their worthiness for inheriting the Mantle. Didact then disintegrates the Primordial by turning the time dial to full and Chakas is converted into a monitor and is pleased to learn that his friends survived. The story ends with the now powered down monitor been ejected out into space, but not before a partial memory imprint of Chakas/monitor is transferred into the ship's computer. Shortly thereafter he takes control of the ship. It is then revealed that it was Chakas who was converted into 343 Guilty Spark. He is now seeking the spirits of Riser and Vinnevra, for whom he seek the Librarian.. He puts the ship's crew to sleep and takes off. ===Silentium=== Silentium is framed with the in-universe conceit of collected Forerunner testimony and investigations recovered by 26th century humanity. The files in question are said to have been extracted from two sources: the carapace of a deceased Catalog (designated Forerunner remains #879) and a damaged monitor. Both the \"Bornstellar Relation\", the fictional document that encompasses the narrative of Halo: Cryptum and ONI's recovery of 343 Guilty Spark which acts as the framing device for the plot of Halo: Primordium, are referenced. On Erde-Tyrene, Catalog observes the evacuation effort of the planet. Catalog is here to investigate the Battle of the Capital, which resulted in the deaths of the entire Old Council, and demands a testimony from both the Librarian and her husband - the IsoDidact, formerly Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting. However, a warning of an approaching Flood fleet results in the IsoDidact having to leave to defend the territory, so Catalog is sent off with the Librarian. While it accompanies her, she tells it about the events that led to her becoming a Lifeshaper, and her growing split from the original Didact due to their differing opinions about humanity. Over a thousand years earlier, shortly before the Ur-Didact went into exile, he and the Librarian gathered together at their estate on the world of Nomdagro. An associate of Haruspis visited their home and helped guide the Ur-Didact in the Cryptum's preservation process. After the Didact's exile, things continued to deteriorate on the Forerunner political scene. To remain seen as an asset to the Master Builder, the Librarian proposed an expedition to a local galaxy known as Path Kethona to learn about the Flood's origins. Legend dictated that 10 million years ago, ancient Forerunners journeyed to Path Kethona, but actual records detailing this journey had long since vanished. The Old Council approved of this venture and the ship Audacity was constructed for the long journey to Path Kethona. The crew consisted of the Librarian, a Builder named Keeper-of-Tools, a Miner named Clearance-of-Old-Forests, and two Lifeworkers named Chant-to-Green and Birth-to-Light. Arriving at Path Kethona, the crew of Audacity would find it seemingly completely devoid of life. However, they discovered that Precursor architecture existed this far out of the Milky Way. Amongst the artifacts was a vast fleet of ancient Forerunner vessels of war. The Librarian and her crew scanned the Forerunner vessels and found nothing of true interest; any records inside had been destroyed thousands of years ago, as they were uploaded in binary. The Librarian, Keeper and Chant discovered a planet with a civilization of primitive Forerunners confined to the planet and lacking any form of advanced technology; however, the planet's ecology is completely based upon Forerunner genetics. The crew land on the planet to encounter the natives in person. As the Librarian meets the locals in person without armor. The Librarian queries an elder, Glow-of-Old-Suns about the origins of her people and is taken to a valley where she learns that the history of the natives is contained within a vast growth of moss - an organic Domain. By accessing this information reserve, she would learn that Warriors drove the Precursors to Path Kethona during the Forerunners' genocidal campaign against their creators ten million years earlier, and that the planet's inhabitants were descendants of Forerunners exiled there as punishment for refusing to partake in the destruction of the Precursors. Back in the present, the Ur-Didact emerges from a stasis-bubble on a broken-down Builder hulk drifting in a Burn, the designation for a Flood infected star system. Also on-board is a former Promethean named Sharp-by-Striking, another Catalog and a Builder named Maker-of-Moons. It is learned that Sharp lost favor with Faber and Maker was going to give Catalog testimony against Faber, so all three found themselves on the broken ship as well. Their destination is a Flood-infested world called Uthera Midgeerrd. Eventually a Precursor artifact with slithering star roads appears and threatens to destroy the ship. The Ur-Didact, willing to confront whatever lies in the Precursor artifact, remains on the ship while the others escape; only Catalog stays to accompany him. The Ur-Didact and Catalog are captured by the Gravemind and the Ur- Didact's sanity is severely shaken by the resulting encounter. The Gravemind then reveals the true nature of the Precursors. They did indeed reject Forerunners for the Mantle and intended for humans to hold it. The Forerunners did not accept this and drove the Precursors from the galaxy and beyond. Some Precursors survived by going dormant, others became powder that could regenerate their old selves in time, but time rendered it defective and it only created sickness and disease. The Precursors vowed that none of their creations would rise against them again and that all life would suffer and be in perpetual agony, through their new form as the Flood. Back in the Orion complex, Forerunner defenses continue to fall as formerly dormant Precursor artifacts across the galaxy begin to reactivate, with their immense power bolstering the Flood's already enormous forces. The Master Builder is revealed to be alive and well. He rescued the Ur-Didact, who was given power once again. A meeting occurs on Nomdagro between the IsoDidact, Ur-Didact and Librarian that does not go well. Arguments ensue and the Ur-Didact reveals the Gravemind drove him mad and that he would not let humans attain the Mantle. The Flood arrives and ravages Nomdagro as the Audacity and Mantle's Approach leave towards the greater Ark, now the last bastion of the ecumene. On the greater Ark, Omega Halo is there in anticipation for a Flood assault. A power struggle ensues between the IsoDidact and other Forerunner commanders who think the Ur-Didact should instead lead them. The Master Builder manages to regain control for him and the IsoDidact by revealing that the Ur-Didact is being used as a pawn for the Gravemind; after Faber had recovered him, the Ur- Didact conveyed him a sadistic message from the Gravemind which had absorbed Faber's family. A massive Flood fleet led by Mendicant Bias arrives and chaos erupts. In that confusion, the Ur-Didact uses a Composer to compose human populations being stored on Omega Halo and retreats towards Requiem. The Librarian follows behind him, grieving for the loss of her humans. Monitor Chakas is tasked with saving the rest of the humans on the Ark and taking them to the lesser Ark, still hidden from the Ur-Didact and the Flood. The IsoDidact and the remaining Forerunner commanders with Faber in tow go to the Halo and activate it to buy time. Although the pulse destroys some of the Precursor star roads and part of the Flood fleet, both the greater Ark and Omega Halo are soon destroyed by the star roads. Faber remains behind while IsoDidact and the other commanders attempt to escape, but they begin to plummet to their deaths as the Halo is torn apart. Chakas manages to save the IsoDidact and takes him to the lesser Ark via Faber's personal slipspace portal. At the lesser Ark, the remaining six Halos are assigned their monitor caretakers in preparation for their distribution across the galaxy, Installation 07 having been deployed years prior. The IsoDidact has a brief conversation with Chakas, in which he gives him his new designation, 343 Guilty Spark, and assigns him to Installation 04. The IsoDidact then asks Chakas if he would fire the rings, were it his choice, but receives no response. On Requiem, the Librarian sneaks aboard with the Audacity by trailing behind the Mantle's Approach. Requiem's defenses also view her as a friendly and let her in. The Librarian finds Endurance-of-Will, a Promethean and former love interest of the Ur-Didact. Endurance reveals that the Ur- Didact is using the essences of the composed humans and Prometheans to build an army of mechanical Promethean Knights, with which he plans to defeat the Flood and eradicate all species who might challenge the Forerunners in the future. Despite resenting her for being chosen by the Ur-Didact instead of her, Endurance is eventually convinced to help the Librarian take down the Ur- Didact and seal him in a Cryptum. Once done, the Librarian tasks Endurance to watch over the Didact for as long as she can. As she leaves Requiem for Earth, the Librarian is confronted by a large group of Knights and wonders if Endurance chose to become one herself. The Librarian then draws the Flood towards Earth to allow the IsoDidact to fire the seven Halo rings. She sends Chant-to-Green off to the lesser Ark with the planet's remaining humans and passes her title of Lifeshaper on to Chant while remaining on Earth herself. During her last days on Earth, the Gravemind sends down ancient human essences, including the Lord of Admirals, to reveal that the Domain was created by the Precursors as the collection of wisdom from over 100 billion years of knowledge and that it was ingrained in Precursor architecture for safekeeping. In short, the Domain is the mythical Organon. Sadly, the Librarian realizes that the Halos will destroy all of this, and that without the Domain, the Ur-Didact will spend the eons to come in complete silence, dwelling on his own rage and madness. As she watches the Portal's construction, she sincerely hopes humanity will one day inherit the Mantle. At the lesser Ark, the IsoDidact activates the rings while Offensive Bias fends off Mendicant Bias' fleet, allowing the rings to fire before the latter can reach the Ark. In the end, 343 Guilty Spark reflects on the Halos working their power throughout the galaxy. In that instant, he receives the first signals of a young, previously unknown civilization, which is swiftly extinguished by the Array's pulse. Compartmentalization processes then erase large portions of Spark's memory and he forgets his old life. ====Epilogue==== A code to a hidden audio epilogue, titled \"Rebirth\", is included in the form of Forerunner symbols featured in some of the chapter headings for the novel. The code can be used on Halo Waypoint to unlock a forty-minute narration by Greg Bear, describing the reintroduction phase from the perspective of Riser. Having survived the destruction of the greater Ark, Riser, Vinnevra and other humans are relocated on Installation 00 among many other species, where Forerunners watch over them until they are returned to their homeworld. At Riser's request, his people are relocated on a series of islands. Riser meets with the IsoDidact one last time before the Forerunners leave and the humans begin settling in their new home. Days after, a new code was revealed, adding 5 additional minutes to the epilogue, describing the trial of Mendicant Bias after its defeat at the Battle of the Maginot Sphere. ==Release and reception== In the weeks before release, Tor Books released Chapter One for free, and Chapter Two was made available on the Halo Waypoint website. Tor also ran giveaways of the other Halo novels and action figures. An unabridged audio book, narrated by Holter Graham, was released alongside the print edition on January 4, 2011. Upon release Greg Bear did book signings attended by Frank O'Connor. Following its release, Cryptum reached number 22 in the New York Times Best Seller List in the Hardcover Fiction category. It also spent five weeks on the Los Angeles Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list, reaching number 17. Publishers Weekly noted that the book was a bestseller in the hardcovers category in early September 2011 at Borders. Cryptum was met with varying reviews. Dr. Nigel Seel of sciencefiction.com called it tired, unoriginal and boring, saying, \"It's hard to care about the flimsy characters, the plot is wearily over familiar, the hero is passive throughout and overall, not enough happens.\" He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow, concluding, \"This is one for the die-hard Halo fans.\" Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans, but praised Graham's narration. Portland Book Reviews Missy Wadkins felt differently. She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting history lesson. Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel's by recommending it to all science fiction readers, not just Halo fans. Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel; he complimented Bear's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting on too much and ruining the suspense. At San Diego Comic-Con on July 14, 2012 Bear signed copies of the book. Halo: Primordium was on the New York Times Bestseller List: Hardcover Fiction for the week of January 7, 2012 at number seventeen. The Los Angeles Times had the book on its Bestseller List for two weeks, at number 16 and then at number 14 for the weeks of January 22 and January 29. Publishers Weekly listed the book at number seventeen on their Bestsellers Hardcover Fiction for the week of January 16, 2012. Story Hobby reviewed the book and gave it an 80% rating, calling the book a \"big improvement\" over the previous title, citing the exciting conclusion and more human centered story, but called the plot \"weak\". Book Loons called it \"slow\", and said it was only with those familiar with the source material, but that the audio book was very good, and that it had an excellent surprise ending. The book debuted at number eight on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list and number thirty-five the following week. On the New York Times \"Combined Hardcover and Paperback Fiction\" List it was listed at number twenty four for the week of April 7. The book entered USA Todays Top 150 books on March 28, 2013, and peaked at number 128.
