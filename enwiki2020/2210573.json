He taught social studies and coached basketball at several high schools in North Carolina. In 1984 he received a job as a graduate assistant coach for the men's basketball team at Clemson University. Prior to the 1986\u201387 season he was named head coach at Pfeiffer College in Misenheimer, North Carolina. He led the Falcons to a 181\u201391 record in his nine years as their coach, including one berth in the NAIA championship game. ==Charlotte== In 1995 Lutz was named the head coach at Gardner\u2013Webb University, but resigned two weeks after accepting the job in order to become an assistant coach at his alma mater under head coach Jeff Mullins. He served as an assistant under Mullins (1995\u201396) and his successor, Melvin Watkins (1996\u201398). When Watkins accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&M; University, Lutz was promoted and became the eighth head coach of the Charlotte 49ers on April 9, 1998. The 49ers enjoyed consistent success during Lutz's tenure, reaching the NCAA Tournament five times (1999, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005), plus three appearances in the NIT (2000, 2006 and 2008). In 2005 Lutz was a finalist for the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award. On February 23, 2008, Charlotte won at home over Saint Louis 81\u201364, giving Lutz 183 wins at Charlotte and the all-time mark for wins by a 49ers coach, passing Mullins' 182 wins accumulated between 1985 and 1996. Lutz' 49ers were expected to contend for their first NCAA Tournament berth as an Atlantic 10 member in 2009-10. With eight games to go in the season, they had a record of 18-5 and seemed well on their way to a bid. However, they went 1-7 the rest of the way. They bottomed out in the first round of the Atlantic 10 Tournament against UMass when they came out of a timeout with six men on the court. The resulting technical foul derailed a last-ditch rally, and they lost the game.
