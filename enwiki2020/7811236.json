The film was originally titled The Scalper. == Plot == Gary Starke (Garcia) is a New York City ticket scalper who, in the old traditional style of scalping \"works the street\", known as \"the walk\", as opposed to the plethora of modern-day ticket brokers who ply the Internet for sales. Yet when his girlfriend Linda (MacDowell) gets enough of his lifestyle and leaves him, he decides to mend his ways and make one last big score, something that will help him win Linda back and straighten out his life. He finds his chance in an epiphanic moment; an opportunity to scalp a large stack of tickets to see the hottest show in town --- the Pope at Yankee Stadium. == Cast == * Andy Garcia as Gary Starke * Andie MacDowell as Linda Palinski * Richard Bradford as Benny Moran * Alice Drummond as Lady with Cash * Fred Asparagus as Zeus * Louis Mustillo as Harry the Head * Anita Elliott as Refund Lady at the Met * Patrick Breen as San Diego Vinnie * Laura Harris as Alice / 'Cyclops' * Don Novello as Tony * Ron Leibman as Barry the Book * Michael Willis as TV Customer * Jack Cafferty as Newscaster * Molly Wenk as Catholic Schoolgirl Fanny * Daniella Garcia-Lorido as Catholic Schoolgirl Lucy * Abe Vigoda as Arty * Andre B.
