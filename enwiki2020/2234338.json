On October 1, 2011 Calumet acquired the Superior, WI refinery from Murphy Oil USA.

In 2013, Calumet proposed spending $20 million to upgrade a dock near the Superior refinery to transport crude oil on barges across the Great Lakes.http://www.wuwm.com/post/oil-company-looks-great-lakes- shipping-demand- booms#stream/0https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/are-the- great-lakes-the-next-pipeline-for-alberta-crude-oil In August 2017, the Superior refinery was sold to Husky Superior Refining Holding Corporation, a wholly owned unit of Husky Energy.
