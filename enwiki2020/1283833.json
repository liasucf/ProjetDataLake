    "text": "Southern Virginia University (SVU) is a private liberal arts college in Buena Vista, Virginia. The school, though not officially affiliated with a particular faith, embraces the values of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). It was founded in 1867 as a school for girls, and is now a private four-year coeducational institution. The Carnegie Classification categorizes it as a very small baccalaureate only college with an arts & sciences focus. SVU is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. == History == The school was founded as a for-profit institution in 1867 during Virginia's post-Civil War era when Alice Scott Chandler established the Home School for Girls in Bowling Green, Virginia, later renamed the Bowling Green Female Seminary. In 1883, Edgar H. Rowe purchased the school and operated it with Mrs. Chandler as principal. Dr. Rowe moved the school to Buena Vista in 1900, and changed its name to Southern Seminary. It was located in the splendid Buena Vista Hotel, which had been built 10 years earlier to accommodate the large numbers of land speculators investigating the town's iron ore deposits. The iron boom was short-lived, however, and Rowe purchased the hotel. The original hotel still serves as Main Hall, the university's principal building, and holds a place of distinction on the National Register of Historic Places, on which it is listed as the Southern Seminary Main Building. In 1919, Robert Lee Durham, former dean of Martha Washington College (which merged with Emory & Henry College), bought a half-interest in Southern Seminary and became the resident head of the school. An educator, lawyer, engineer, author and inventor, Durham strengthened the school's academic program. In 1922, Durham's daughter, Margaret, married H. Russell Robey, who purchased Rowe's remaining interest in the school and became its business manager and treasurer. Durham and Robey added college- level courses to the school's curriculum, and the first class of the new junior college program graduated in 1925. The period of greatest physical growth of the school, by then called Southern Seminary and Junior College, occurred during the presidency of Margaret Durham Robey, who succeeded her father upon his retirement in 1942. Facilities for art, early childhood education and home economics were added. In 1959, the Robeys turned over the ownership of the college to a Board of Trustees, and the institution changed from proprietary to nonprofit status. In 1961, the school ceased offering high school courses, and the name of the institution was changed to Southern Seminary Junior College. The academic program was expanded to allow students to begin careers after their two years at the school or to transfer to four- year colleges. \"Sem\" became a nationally recognized competitor in intercollegiate riding, winning numerous state, regional and national equestrian competitions. To avoid confusion, the name was again changed to Southern Virginia College for Women, which was shortened in 1994 to Southern Virginia College, when male students were admitted. In the late 1980s and early 1990s enrollment began to slip and the college became financially unstable, which led to a loss of regional accreditation in 1996. In the spring of that year, Southern Virginia College's board of trustees transferred the school's assets and liabilities to a new board, many of whom were members of the LDS Church. The main figure in this reorganization was Glade Knight. In 2000 the school was accepted into pre-accreditation status by the American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE), which is separate from regional accreditation bodies and was renamed Southern Virginia University in April 2001. In 2003 it was granted full accreditation by the AALE. In June 2010 the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools awarded initial candidacy to SVU. Two years later, in June 2012, the university received full regional accreditation. On August 9, 2017 Southern Virginia University officially changed its school colors from green to crimson. == Campus == Main Hall Academic Center SVU's campus consists of twelve main buildings, including Main Hall (the most visible building on campus, used for administrative offices), the Kimball Student Center, the Knight Sports Arena, the Stoddard Center, the Von Canon Library, Landrum Hall, Robey Hall (men's residence hall), Craton Hall (women's residence hall), The Lofts (men's and women's residence hall), Walnut Avenue Apartments (men's and women's residence), Academic Center (the main academic building), and Chandler Hall (theatre and music).url=http://svu.edu/wp-content/pdf/about/campus- map.pdf |title=SVU Campus Map |date=November 21, 2017 | accessdate= 2017-11-21 |publisher=Southern Virginia University The campus area also includes several homes that are used for additional student housing and office space.

The retention rate at SVU is around 71% (after freshman year), with a significant number of students leaving to serve as Missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the graduation rate is 31%. ==Student life== ===Religious activity=== LDS Church principles and activities are fully integrated into life and education at SVU.
