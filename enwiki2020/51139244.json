    "text": "The 1973\u201374 Carolina Cougars season was the 5th and final season of the Cougars in the American Basketball Association. Billy Cunningham (who had been named the MVP the previous season), Dennis Wuycik, and Mike Lewis were hobbled by injuries through the season, which meant the team struggled to gain much ground in the Division, though they finished consistently enough to qualify for a playoff spot for the 2nd straight season. The Cougars finished 2nd in points scored, with 110.5 per game, but 6th in points allowed with 107.0 per game. The team was 26\u201316 by the midpoint of the season (with a seven-game winning streak in the middle of it), while going 21\u201321 for the second half of the season. The biggest losing streak by the team was 6, done near the end of the season, but by that point they had clinched the third spot in the playoffs, finishing 19 games above Virginia, who they beat in their final regular season game at home, 99\u201391. Once again, the Cougars faced the Kentucky Colonels in the playoffs, but once again the Colonels prevailed, this time in a First Round sweep. This turned out to be the final game the Cougars played. Owner Tedd Munchak sold the team after the season ended to a group of New York businessmen, which included Harry Weltman, Donald Schupak, Ozzie Silna and Daniel Silna for $1.5 million. The team subsequently moved to St. Louis to become the Spirits of St. Louis, playing for two seasons.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CAR/1974_games.html ==Roster== * 27 Joe Caldwell - Small forward * 20 Mack Calvin - Point guard * 53 Jim Chones - Center * 32 Billy Cunningham - Small forward * 21 Steve Jones - Shooting guard * 42 Mike Lewis - Center * 23 Gene Littles - Point guard * 22 Ed Manning - Small forward * 24 Ted McClain - Shooting guard * 52 Tom Owens - Power forward * 31 Marv Roberts - Power forward * 14 Ollie Taylor - Shooting guard * 44 Dennis Wuycik - Small forward ==Final standings== ===Eastern Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ !
