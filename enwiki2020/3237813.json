It was a wireless mesh Internet technology designed and implemented through a partnership between Bell Canada Enterprises, Nortel Networks, and the Township of Chapleau. The project began on November 9th, 2005 and had a one-year trial. Researchers from Nipissing University in North Bay, Ontario conducted an investigation to illustrate any existing influences this influx of computer technology may have on the educational community. An analysis of the impact of high-speed internet on the residents and town of Chapleau was published in 2010 by University of Toronto sociologists Jessica Collins and Barry Wellman. \"Small Town in the Internet Society: Chapleau is No Longer an Island.\" American Behavioral Scientist 53 (9): 1344-66. ==References== ==External links== * Project Chapleau * Nipissing University Category:Wi-Fi providers Category:Internet service providers of Canada ",
