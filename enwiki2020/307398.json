    "text": "The MBDA Apache (; ), or Apache AP, is a French-developed air-launched anti- runway cruise missile, manufactured by European arms company MBDA. The Apache system is at the base of the SCALP EG concept, notably for the aerodynamics and the stealth feature. The SCALP EG also has a different propulsion system as well as a different warhead. While the SCALP uses a single high-penetration warhead, the Apache's effect is obtained by dispersal of 10 cluster submunitions. == See also == * SCALP EG * BLU-107 Durandal ==References== MBDA Apache Category:Cruise missiles of France Category:Anti-runway weapons Category:Cluster bombs ",
