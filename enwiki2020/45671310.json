    "text": "The Beans and Bacon mine is a disused lead mine on Bonsall Moor near the village of Bonsall, Derbyshire, United Kingdom. The nearest large town is Matlock.Beans and Bacon Mine , The Historical Gazetteer of England's Place- Names, retrieved 14 March 2015. The mine was in operation from 1920 to 1925,Special Reports on the Mineral Resources of Great Britain, vol. 4, p. 105, Geological Survey of Great Britain, 1952 . but workings around the mine date back to at least 1740 and some are thought to be medieval, making it of some archaeological importance.John Barnatt, Rebecca Penny, The Lead Legacy:The Prospects for the Peak District's Lead Mining Heritage, p. 35, Peak District National Park Authority, 2004. No reason has been given for the mine's unusual name, but other mines in the area are called Mule Spinner, Frogs Hole, Cackle Mackle and Wanton Legs so this mine's name is not atypical.List of Mines, Peakland Heritage, retrieved 14 March 2015 The mine is one of a group in the area scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 as an ancient monument of national importance. The Beans and Bacon mine site includes five coes (stone sheds), one of which contains the founder shaft in one compartment, and the workings descend more than 55 metres (180 ft). The site is one of only two that show numerous different methods of rock breakage on such a small site. These methods include plug and feather, gad and wedge, and gunpowder blasting. In September 2014 a cow was rescued from the Beans and Bacon mine after falling four metres (13 ft) down a shaft. Rescuers enlarged another entrance and coaxed the animal out.\"Cow saved after Bonsall mine shaft fall\", Derbyshire Times, 22 September 2014. ==References== Category:History of Derbyshire Category:Mining in Derbyshire Category:Peak District Category:History of mining in the United Kingdom Category:Archaeological sites in Derbyshire Category:Lead mines in England Category:Former mines in England Category:Underground mines in England ",
