With the end of this industry the Firth of Thames area ceases to be the main point of contact for pakeha and M\u0101ori. At the end of the year Governor King reports half a dozen whaling ships are operating off the north coast.Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand: Whaling The first recorded sealing ship visit to Dusky Sound in 4 years takes place as most sealers visit the recently discovered Bass Strait rookeries instead.Salmond, Anne.

There are women and children on board. In attempting to travel up the Waihou the ship runs aground causing some damage. The crew meet Thomas Taylor,See 1799 who acts as interpreter for the local M\u0101ori who help in unsuccessful attempts to refloat the ship and also provide the crew with food. *20 April \u2013 The Royal Admiral, Captain William Wilson, arrives at Hauraki to collect timber before taking several London Missionary Society Brothers to the mission in Tahiti. They encounter M\u0101ori who help with provisioning and inform them of a ship further up river. They send a boat several days later which soon finds the El Plumier. Captain Wilson later encounters Thomas Taylor who had been staying with local M\u0101ori for 2 years. Captain Wilson and the LMS Brothers record some details of M\u0101ori life given to them by Taylor. *15 June \u2013 The Royal Admiral leaves Hauraki. The Brothers from the LMS later write accounts of New Zealand and raise the possibility of sending a mission there. However the timber voyages end later in the year and nothing comes of these suggestions. *20 August \u2013 The El Plumier leaves Hauraki. She is later captured by the Spanish at Guam and all records of her visit to New Zealand are lost. *5 \u2013 21 December \u2013 TheVenusii, Captain George Bass, visits Dusky Sound.
