    "text": "Sebasti\u00e3o Marcos Barbosa de Oliveira (born 21 June 1976), known as Marcos, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. ==Club career== Born in Siqueira Campos, Paran\u00e1, Marcos started his career with local Paran\u00e1 Clube, appearing regularly during six years. In January 2003 he moved abroad, joining Portugal's C.S. Mar\u00edtimo; a starter from his beginnings, he made his Primeira Liga debut in a 0\u20131 away loss against Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, and went on to draw comparisons to compatriot Everton Machado who played in the island of Madeira from 1988 to 1996 with great success. In the 2004\u201305 season, as Mar\u00edtimo finished seventh with one of the strongest defensive records, Marcos was named Goalkeeper of the Year in the country. He continued to be the undisputed starter until his departure in 2009, at 33. In July 2010, after one year in Italy with lowly A.C. Renate, Marcos returned to Portugal and signed with S.C. Braga, as the club had lost Eduardo and Pawe\u0142 Kieszek in the off-season. He was released by the Minho side in early January 2012, with only one competitive appearance to his credit, a 4\u20130 away win against F.C. Arouca in the 2010\u201311 edition of the League Cup. After being released by Braga, 36-year-old Marcos joined C.D. Feirense of the second level. He returned to his first club Paran\u00e1 the following transfer window, achieving promotion to the S\u00e9rie A in 2017 and retiring immediately after; during his two spells, he appeared in an all-time best 367 matches for the team based at the Est\u00e1dio Vila Capanema. ==References== ==External links== *CBF data *Futp\u00e9dia profile * * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:People from Paran\u00e1 (state) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Paran\u00e1 Clube players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:C.S.
