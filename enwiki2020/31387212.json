    "text": "The Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF) is a Singapore Armed Forces-level task force, formed as a result of the restructuring of the Republic of Singapore Navy's Coastal Command on 19 January 2009. Its role is to ensure Singapore's maritime security and act as a co-ordinating agency for all national maritime agencies to allow for the seamless execution of maritime security operations. Commander MSTF reports directly to the Chief of Defence Force (CDF), but the Chief of Navy (CNV) would have oversight over its various peacetime operations. Assets from the navy, air force and army will be assigned to MSTF as required by operations. MSTF also has the ability to co-op assets from national agencies such as the Police Coast Guard, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and Singapore Customs for a unified response to maritime security threats. MSTF is based at the Singapore Maritime Security Centre within the Changi Command and Control Centre at Changi Naval Base. The MSTF comprises three groups: # The Comprehensive Maritime Awareness (CMA) Group builds and maintains a comprehensive maritime situation picture through its information sharing networks. It works closely with national agencies, international partners and the shipping community (such as ship owners, ships charterers, agents and port operators) to share maritime information. The collated information helps in deciding the allocation of MSTF assets in day-to-day maritime operations and operational responses when required. # The Operations Group, comprising operations planners from the Army, Navy and Air Force, undertakes an integrated approach towards planning and execution of all maritime security operations. It conducts daily patrols, boarding and escort operations in the Singapore Strait and SLOC, to ensure maritime security and the protection of key installations and potential targets. # The Inter-Agency Coordination Group comprises representatives from the Police Coast Guard (PCG), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), and the Singapore Customs (Customs). This group ensures close co- ordination in the execution of maritime security operations at the national level. ==References== Category:Republic of Singapore Navy ",
