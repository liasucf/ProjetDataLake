However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the Barnegat-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft. AVP-47 was assigned the name Metomkin on 23 August 1942. However, she became one of the final two ships to be cancelled when the Navy cancelled the contract for her construction on 29 April 1943 before construction could begin. == References == * * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive Small Seaplane Tender (AVP) Index Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Barnegat-class seaplane tenders Category:Cancelled ships of the United States Navy Category:United States Navy Virginia-related ships Category:Ships built at Lake Washington Shipyard ",
