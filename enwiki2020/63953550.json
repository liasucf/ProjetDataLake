    "text": "Parmotrema rampoddense, commonly known as the long-whiskered ruffle lichen, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. It is widely distributed in tropical regions and grows on the bark of oak and palm trees. ==Taxonomy== It was originally described by William Nylander as a species of Parmelia, from a collection made in Sri Lanka. Mason Hale transferred the taxon to the genus Parmotrema in 1974. ==Description== The colour of the lichen thallus is light greenish-grey, and lacks maculae (paler spots free of photobiont). The lobes comprising the thallus surface are 1\u20133 cm wide and have scattered cilia on the margin, which can be relatively long \u2013 up to 5 mm. The lower surface (the prothallus) is black, rarely with white blotches, and relatively free of rhizines. The cortex contains atranorin, while the medulla contains alectoronic acid. ==See also== *List of Parmotrema species ==References== Category:Fungi described in 1900 Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungi of South America rampoddense Category:Taxa named by William Nylander (botanist) ",
