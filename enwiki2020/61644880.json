According to Friesem (2016), digital empathy is the cognitive and emotional ability to be reflective and socially responsible while strategically using digital media.Yonty Friesem. (2016). Empathy for the Digital Age. In Emotions, Technology, and Behaviors (pp. 21\u201345). https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312502352_Empathy_for_the_Digital_Age == Background == Digital empathy finds its roots in empathy, a human behaviour explained by cognitive and behavioral neuroscientists as, \u201ca multifaceted construct used to account for the capacity to share and understand the thoughts and feelings of others.\" The neurological basis for empathy lies in mirror neurons, where perception and imitation facilitate empathy. At the centre of empathy creation is communication. As communication became increasingly online due to the rapid adoption of digital communications technology in the 1990s through the 2000s, society\u2019s communication patterns altered rapidly, both positively and negatively. Technology usage has transformed human interactions into digital conversations where people now have the ability to instantly share thoughts, feelings, and behaviours via digital channels in a few seconds. It has been observed and researched that digital conversations threaten the appropriate expression of empathy, largely as a result of the \u201conline disinhibition effect\u201d. Psychologist Dr. John Suler defines the online disinhibition effect as the tendency for \u201c people say and do things in cyberspace that they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily say and do in the face- to-face world\u201d. Research has shown that the shift away from face-to-face communication has caused a decline in the social-emotional skills of youth and suggest that \"generations raised on technology\" are becoming less empathic. == Digital Empathy == Increasingly online communication patterns, and the associated phenomenon of online disinhibition, have led to research on \"digital empathy\". Christopher Terry and Cain (2015) in their research paper \u201cThe Emerging Issue of Digital Empathy\u201d define digital empathy as the \u201ctraditional empathic characteristics such as concern and caring for others expressed through computer-mediated communications.\u201d Yonty Friesem (2016) wrote that \u201cdigital empathy seeks to expand our thinking about traditional empathy phenomena into the digital arena.\"Yonty Friesem. (2016). Empathy for the Digital Age. In Emotions, Technology, and Behaviors (pp. 21\u201345). https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312502352_Empathy_for_the_Digital_Age In the handbook of research on media literacy in the digital age, Friesem (2015) further elaborates on this concept by stating that, \u201cdigital empathy explores the ability to analyze and evaluate another\u2019s internal state (empathy accuracy), have a sense of identity and agency (self-empathy), recognize, understand and predict other\u2019s thoughts and emotions (cognitive empathy), feel what others feel (affective empathy), role play (imaginative empathy), and be compassionate to others (empathic concern) via digital media.\"Friesem, Y. (2016). Developing Digital Empathy: A Holistic Approach to Media Literacy Research Methods. In M. N. Yildiz & J. Keengwe (Eds.), Handbook of Research on Media Literacy in the Digital Age (Vol. 1\u2013Book, Section, pp. 145\u2013160). IGI Global. https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-9667-9.ch007 == Applications == Digital empathy is used in healthcare and education. In healthcare, traditional empathetic characteristics can be understood as a physician\u2019s ability to understand the patient's experience and feelings, communicate and check their understanding of the situation, and act helpfully. According to Nina Margarita Gonzalez, digitally empathetic tools in healthcare should meet these conditions of physician empathy by designing empathetic tools through 3 key steps: understand, check, and act. Gonzalez, Nina Margarita (2017, February 18). A Framework for Designing Digital Health Tools with Empathy. Journal of Participatory Medicine.https://participatorymedicine.org/journal/perspective/narratives/2017/02/17/a-framework- for-designing-digital-health-tools-with-empathy/ By ensuring that the digital tool understands the patient experience, the tool can act through \u201cautomated empathy\u201d to provide validating statements or tips. For example, The National Cancer Institute created texting programs that collected information on user\u2019s smoking cessation efforts and provided validation or tips to support them, such as, \u201cWe know how you are feeling. Think about what you are gaining and why you want to quit smoking.\u201d New health communications technology and telehealth makes clear the need for medical practitioners to recognize and adapt to online disinhibition and the lack of nonverbal cues. The University of the Highlands and Islands Experience Lab completed a study on empathy in video conferencing consultations with diabetes patients. It found that many factors impact the level of perceived empathy in a video conferencing consultation, including clarity of verbal communication, choice in pathways of care, and preparation and access to information before the consultation.Raman, S., Blom, J., & Bradley, J. (2016, October). Digital Empathy: Role of empathy in digital health interactions [Monograph]. The Glasgow School of Art. http://radar.gsa.ac.uk/6230/ Given the particular challenge that the online disinhibition effect poses to telehealth or other digital health communications, Terry and Cain suggest that, for physicians to effectively communicate empathy through digitally-mediated interactions, they must be taught traditional empathy more broadly, as the foundational principles are the same. In education, researchers are often concerned with how to use digital technologies to teach empathy and how to teach students to be empathetic when using digital platforms. In \u201cEmpathy for the Digital Age\u201d, Yonty Friesem (2016) found that empathy can be taught to youth through video production, where the majority of students experienced higher levels of empathy after writing, producing, creating, and screening their videos in a project designed to foster empathy. Cheryl Wei-yu Chen similarly found that video projects can help youth develop awareness of empathy in digitally- mediated interactions.Chen, C. W. (2018). Developing EFL students\u2019 digital empathy through video production. System, 77, 50\u201357. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2018.01.006 In their research, Friesem and Greene (2020) used digital empathy to promote digital and media literacy skills of foster youth.Friesem, Y., & Greene, K. (2020). Tuned in: The importance of peer feedback with foster youth creating media. Reflective Practice, 0(0), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1080/14623943.2020.1798919 Practicing cognitive, emotional and social empathy through digital media have been effective to support not only the academic skills of the foster youth, but also their well being, sense of belonging and media literacy skills. As an important practice of digital literacy and media education, digital empathy is an inclusive and collaborative experience as students learn to produce their own media.Friesem, Y. (2017).
