    "text": "Sion Harris (1811 - April 25, 1854) was an American-born Liberian colonist and politician. An emancipated slave, he emigrated to Liberia in 1830 and engaged in a string of adventures, most notably thwarting an attack on the Heddington mission by an army of Loma tribesmen in 1840. He later served in Liberia's House of Representatives.Durwood Dunn, An Abolitionist in the Appalachian South (University of Tennessee Press (1997), pp. 33\u201334. ==Biography== Harris was born in Knox County, Tennessee, in 1811. Little is known of his early life, though he would later state in a conversation with abolitionist Ezekiel Birdseye that he had been a slave. He eventually obtained his freedom, and commenced working as a carpenter. In February 1830, he arrived in Liberia with several other colonists, including George W. Erskine, a Presbyterian missionary who had been trained for the ministry by Isaac Anderson at the Southern and Western Theological Seminary (modern Maryville College). Erskine and several members of his family died shortly after their arrival.\"Brig Liberia's Company, Arrived at Monrovia February 17, 1830\", 1830. Retrieved March 25, 2015. His daughter, Martha, married Harris. On March 8, 1840, Harris and his wife were staying at the home of the Reverend George S. Brown at Heddington, a remote Methodist mission from Monrovia, when a band of 300 to 400 tribesmen led by the Loma chief Gotorah attacked. Having stockpiled muskets, Harris, with help from only his wife, an assistant carpenter, and Brown, managed to fend off the entire attack.\"The Attack on Heddington,\" African Repository and Colonial Journal, Vol. 16, No. 13 (July 1840), p. 194.\"Information Wanted\", Maryland Colonization Journal, Vol. 1, No. 7 (December 1841), p. 102. Gotorah was shot by Harris during the assault, prompting the attackers to retreat.Frederick Starr, Liberia: Description, History, Problems (1913), pp. 83\u201384. Gotorah's half-buried body was later found in the vicinity by Liberian militiamen. His corpse was decapitated, and the head was presented to Governor Thomas Buchanan. Harris was widely praised for his actions.John Saillant, \"Missions and Race Relations in the United States, 1822-1860\", The Foreign Missionary at Home: Explorations in North American Cultural History (University of Alabama Press, 2010), p. 22.Elwood D. Dunn, Amos J. Beyan, and Carl Patrick Burrowes, Historical Dictionary of Liberia (Scarecrow Press, 2000), p. 146. Harris returned to the United States in 1841 to retrieve his brother and several of Erskine's relatives (this was done in part to fulfill Erskine's dying wish). En route from Washington, D.C., to Tennessee, Harris extolled the qualities of Liberia to crowds of free blacks. He met with several members of East Tennessee's abolitionist community, among them Ezekiel Birdseye and John Caldwell.Dunn, p. 57. In October 1841, he delivered a speech to over a thousand attendees at a camp meeting in Maryville organized by Isaac Anderson. He afterward returned to Liberia with over a dozen relatives.Eliza Rhea Anderson Fain, Sanctified Trial: The Diary of Eliza Rhea Anderson Fain, a Confederate Woman in East Tennessee (University of Tennessee Press, 2004), p. xxxiii (note). In August 1853, Harris was elected to one of Montserrado County's seats in Liberia's House of Representatives.\"Results of the Election\", African Repository, Vol. 29, No. 9 (September 1853), p. 286. A few months into his term on April 25, 1854, however, he was killed when he was struck by lightning during a violent thunderstorm.\"The Melancholy Death of Sion Harris,\" African Repository, Vol. 30, No. 8 (August 1854), pp. 228\u2013229. ==References== Category:1811 births Category:1854 deaths Category:People from Knox County, Tennessee Category:People from Montserrado County Category:Members of the House of Representatives of Liberia Category:American emigrants to Liberia Category:Americo-Liberian people Category:Free Negroes Category:Deaths from lightning strikes ",
