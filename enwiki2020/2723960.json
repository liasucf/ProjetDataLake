The name derives from the area being the location of the barns used to store grain before being transported to the Palace at Falkland. The coast around Kingsbarns is also known as a challenging surfing area. Pitmilly, a former estate that was owned by the Moneypenny family for over seven centuries, is located about 1.5 miles from Kingsbarns on the road to St Andrews. Ruins of two mills and the Bronze Age tumulus, Pitmilly Law, are still evident. Little remains of Pitmilly House.
