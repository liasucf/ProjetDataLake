    "text": "El Producto is the debut extended play (EP) by Australian electronic music group The Avalanches. It was released on 8 December 1997 via Wondergram Records and distributed by Shock Records. El Producto was the second release by the group and included their debut single, \"Rock City\", which had appeared on Trifekta Records two months prior. \"Rock City\" was the only single released from the EP, the band had \"started performing widely and attracted a long term recording deal\". Based on the EP's success, Steve Pavlovic, head of Wondergram Records, signed the group to his new Modular Recordings label in May 1998. They also signed with Rex Records for the exclusive United Kingdom four-track EP Undersea Community, which appeared in March 1999. They released their full- length debut album, Since I Left You, on Modular in November 2000. ==Production== The Avalanches sampled material from vinyl records found in thrift-stores in the creation of their music, including the songs in El Producto. Group members, Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann, primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The EP also contained original input from the band, featuring original instrumentation played by the group's members. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Musicians * DJ Dexter \u2013 scratching * Darren Seltmann \u2013 vocals Production * The Avalanches \u2013 recording * David Briggs \u2013 mastering * Matt Gearing-Thomas \u2013 mixing * Richard Robinson \u2013 recording * Sebatron \u2013 recording Credits adapted from El Producto liner notes. ==References== Category:1997 EPs Category:The Avalanches albums ",
