    "text": "14th Street\u2013Union Square is a New York City Subway station complex shared by the BMT Broadway Line, the BMT Canarsie Line and the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. It is located at the intersection of Fourth Avenue and 14th Street, underneath Union Square in Manhattan, and is served by the: *, , , , and trains at all times * and trains at all times except late nights *W train on weekdays *<6> train weekdays in the peak direction In 2016, over 34 million passengers entered this station, making it the fourth-busiest station in the system. The complex is located on the border of several neighborhoods with popular business, residential and nightlife destination spots, including the East Village to the southeast, Greenwich Village to the south and southwest, Chelsea to the northwest, and both the Flatiron District and Gramercy Park to the north and northeast. The station complex consists of three originally separate stations, which were combined on July 1, 1948. They now share a mezzanine, common entrance points, and unified signage. This complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. == History == In the 1990s, this station underwent a major station renovation. On July 9, 1993, the contract for the project's design was awarded for $2,993,948. As part of the contract, the consultant investigated whether it was feasible to reconfigure the IRT passageway, to reframe the exit structure on the Lexington Avenue platforms to accommodate the relocation and widening of stairs, the construction of a new fan room, the removal of stairs on the Broadway Line platforms, the reframing of the existing structure, and the construction of a new staircase between the intermediate and IRT mezzanines. These were all deemed feasible, and in May 1994, a supplemental agreement worth $984,998 was reached to allow the consultant to prepare the design for this work. ==Station layout== ===Exits=== *alt=Two stairs inside Union Square Park on east side of Union Square West at 16th Street * One stair at southeast corner of Union Square East and 15th Street * One stair inside Union Square Park on north side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East * One stair inside Union Square Park on north side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East * One stair on south side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East * Two stairs at southwest corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street * Two stairs at southeast corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street * One stair, escalator bank, and elevator in Zeckendorf Towers at northeast corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street == IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms == 14th Street\u2013Union Square is an express station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line that has four tracks and two island platforms. It opened on October 27, 1904. The uptown and downtown platforms are offset from each other and slightly curved. Gap-filling movable platforms on the downtown side are automatically operated via proximity sensors when trains arrive. The station's mezzanines are located over the platforms. The station has two abandoned local side platforms; the northbound platform is visible through windows, bordered with wide, bright red frames, which is part of a larger, station-wide art installation entitled Framing Union Square, by Mary Miss. From the north end of the downtown platform's mezzanine, the adjacent side platform can be seen through a hole in the plywood. The abandoned platform edges are also visible from the current platforms. ===1991 accident=== On August 28, 1991, an accident just north of the station killed five riders and injured 215 others in one of the worst wrecks since a crash at Times Square\u201342nd Street on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line in 1928 that killed 16 people. The train operator, Robert Ray, was intoxicated and had been overshooting platforms during the entire run from Woodlawn in the Bronx. Just north of this station, his Utica Avenue-bound 4 train was to be shifted to the local track due to repair work on the express one. He was running at in a zone and took the switch so fast that only the first car made it through the crossover. The rest of the train derailed, leading to a massive pile-up. Cars 1435, 1436, 1437, 1439, and 1440 were essentially scrapped on the site, and the track infrastructure suffered heavy structural damage as a result. Service was disrupted for six days, with trains terminating at 59th Street for the duration, as the wreckage was removed. The entire infrastructure, including signals, switches, track, roadbed, cabling, and 23 support columns needed to be replaced. Ray was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released in April 2002 for good behavior. The derailment occurred at the entry to a former pocket track. Similar to 72nd Street on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line, this station was built with extra tracks on the approach to the station. These were between the local and express tracks and were approximately long. The idea was to have a \"stacking\" track where a train could be held momentarily until the platform cleared for it to enter the station. The tracks here and at 72nd Street were rendered useless when train lengths grew beyond these tracks' capacity. When the damage from the 1991 wreck was repaired, the stacking track was removed. A similar track still exists between the northbound tracks south of the 14th Street\u2013Union Square station's northbound platform. ===Image gallery=== File:Union Square subway 001.JPG|Old IRT \"14\" eagle cartouche File:NYCS IRT LexAve 14St.jpg|Abandoned side platform behind the wall and the black bars on the right, whose edge is still visible File:Spring Street Mosaic.jpg|Depiction of the platform in a mosaic at the entrance to Spring Street (8th Avenue) station File:IRT North end Union Sq plat jeh.jpg|Platforms are not aligned; southbound one (background) is farther north == BMT Broadway Line platforms == 14th Street\u2013Union Square, opened on September 5, 1917, is an express station on the BMT Broadway Line that has four tracks and two island platforms. It is the southernmost station in Manhattan with a cross-platform interchange between all four Broadway services. A mosaic on the platform side walls is a depiction of \"the junction of Broadway and ... Bowery Road, 1828,\" as the area was once known. The mezzanine and crossover level has been reconstructed as well. Some former passageways and stairways have been closed off, including one immediately adjacent to the southernmost staircase on the northbound side. This station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The MTA replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with the 1970s wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. They also fixed staircases and platform edges. In 2002, the station was upgraded for ADA-accessibility and its original late 1910s tiling was restored. As part of the upgrade, the MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiled for the walls and floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installed yellow safety treads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions. The station now has an elevator on both platforms as well as connection to the station entrances and passageway to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. In 2005, an artwork called City Glow by Chiho Aoshima was installed here. === Image gallery === File:14th Street Union Square BMT Broadway 005.JPG|Depiction of the junction of Broadway and Bowery Road in 1828 File:Union Sq 14 9-11 name hall jeh.jpg|New tile name tablets on the mezzanine with names of 9/11 victims File:14th Street-Union Square Elevator.jpg|Elevator to southbound platform from mezzanine == BMT Canarsie Line platform == Union Square on the BMT Canarsie Line opened on June 30, 1924, as part of the 14th Street\u2013Eastern Line, which ran from Sixth Avenue under the East River and through Williamsburg to Montrose and Bushwick Avenues. The station has two tracks and one island platform with numerous stairways and exits leading from it. There is one mezzanine attached to this station with entrances on the south side of 14th Street between Broadway and University Place. Other entrances in the complex serve the other services that stop here. The original mosaic band of sky blue, sea green, lime green and yellow ochre stands clearly visible above new green-bordered tile panels. The station has been renovated and is now ADA- accessible with a single elevator going up from the platform to the mezzanine. As part of the 2015\u20132019 MTA Capital Program and the L Project, several modifications were implemented on the platform to improve circulation and to reduce crowding. The stairs from the Broadway Line platforms were rebuilt in March 2019; the stair from the downtown Broadway Line platform was reconfigured entirely. Additionally, a new escalator was installed from the east mezzanine to the platform; it cost around $15 million and opened on September 10, 2020.
