    "text": "Jean-Baptiste Anet (or Annet) (January 2, 1676 \u2013 August 14, 1767) was a French violinist and composer. He was born in Paris. He studied with Arcangelo Corelli for four years in Rome. Afterwards, he returned to Paris about 1700, and was met with the greatest success. There can be little doubt that by his example the principles of the great Italian school of violin-playing were first introduced into France. Probably owing to the jealousy of his French colleagues Anet soon left Paris again, and is said to have spent the rest of his life as conductor of the private band of a nobleman in Poland. He published three sets of sonatas for the violin. ==Published works== * (Paris, 1724) * (Paris, 1726) * (Paris, 1729) * (Paris, 1730) * (Paris, 1730) * (Paris, 1734) ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:French violinists Category:French male violinists Category:French Baroque composers Category:French male composers Category:1676 births Category:1767 deaths ",
