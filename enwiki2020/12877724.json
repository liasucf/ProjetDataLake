In exchange, these former student-athletes agree to participate in school outreach and community service programs addressing social issues of America\u2019s youth. ==Programs and Services== NCAS members are entitled to a variety of programs and services that center around leadership, education and community service. NCAS programs focus on topics ranging from diversity management training, gender violence prevention, alcohol abuse education, outreach, degree completion, and student-athlete recognition. * The Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) Program is a program to motivate student-athletes and student leaders to solve problems such as rape, battering and sexual harassment. The mixed gender, racially diverse MVP Program, composed of former professional and college athletes, motivates men and women to work together in preventing gender violence utilizing a bystander approach to prevention. MVP National is presented in partnership by the Center for the Study of Sport in Society (CSSS). * The Teamwork Leadership Institute (TLI) helps college senior administrators and athletic department staffs, through the provision of diversity training services, apply the principles of teamwork to all areas of athletic departments. * The Alcohol Response-Ability: Foundations for Student- Athletes program is a 90-minute, internet-based alcohol education and life skills program designed specifically for student-athletes and those who work with them in the college and university setting. * National STUDENT-Athlete Day (NSAD), celebrated annually on April 6, honors student-athletes who have achieved excellence in academics and athletics, while making significant contributions to their communities. * Community Service and Outreach Program, arranges for professional and college student-athletes to assist in the coordination of after-school programs on topics related to decreasing violence, avoiding substance abuse, understanding diversity, balancing academics and athletics, goal-setting, sportsmanship, citizenship and conflict resolution. * Degree Completion Program allows former student-athletes to complete their education in exchange for community service. Student-athletes who entered the member institution on an athletic scholarship, in a revenue or non-revenue producing sport are eligible to be readmitted, if academically eligible. Tuition is provided by the institution in the same proportion as it was during the student\u2019s last year of eligibility. Student-athletes are able to continue their education as long as they are making progress toward their degree. In exchange for their tuition, student-athletes participate in the school\u2019s community service and outreach program,. ==Annual events== The NCAS provides an Annual Conference for members on social issues they face in their athletic departments and communities .

And that's the role the NCAS serves. It's the conscience, particularly, of college sport.\" -John Rawlings, Senior VP and Editor, Sporting News * \"This event is extremely important to me; one because I'm being inducted into the [NCAS] Hall of Fame with my late husband; and two, because we're celebrating the development of our youth. This organization is doing an enormous job in helping young people graduate from college, develop their leadership skills, and become interested in giving back to the community.\" -Rachel Robinson, 2004 NCAS Hall of Fame Inductee and Founder, Jackie Robinson Foundation ==References== ==External links== * NCAS Website * Hope for Stanley Foundation Website Category:Sports governing bodies in the United States ",
