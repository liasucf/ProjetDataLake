    "text": "Thuingaleng Muivah (born 3 March 1934) is the present General Secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN). == Early life == Muivah was born in Shongran (Somdal), and did his early schooling at his village and in Ukhrul. Muivah is a Tangkhul (Manipur Naga) from Manipur state. He then joined the Naga National Council (NNC), an armed group campaigning for secession of Nagaland from India. He subsequently became the General Secretary of NNC. When a group of NNC leaders signed the Shillong Accord of 1975 with the Government of India, Muviah and some others denounced them as traitors. ==NNC to NSCN== In 1980, a faction led by Isak Chishi Swu, Muivah and S. S. Khaplang broke away from NNC to form the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN). The NSCN was formed as a result of discontentment with the Shillong Accord, and continued secessionist activities abandoned by the NNC. The group later split into NSCN (IM) led by Swu and Muivah, and NSCN (K) led by Khaplang due to major disagreements. == Peace talks == NSCN (IM) under the leadership of Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu signed a ceasefire agreement with the Government of India in August 1997 after decades of engaging in hostile fighting with Indian security forces. The major breakthrough of the peace talk happened on 3 August 2015 with the signing of a peace accord between Indian Government. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:Nagaland politicians Category:Living people Category:People from Ukhrul district Category:Manipur politicians Category:Naga nationalism ",
