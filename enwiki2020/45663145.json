Its geography provided a home for numerous groups seeking shelter from across West Africa during the slave trade era. The original name of the settlement was Serminakuu meaning groups of 'grasses'. This name was changed to Banda, which is a corruption of 'Woanda' meaning 'they did not sleep'. Ancestors of Banda Ahenkro were allies of the Asante kingdom during wars and they provided a military force that virtually refused to sleep during at-war times. This is because they were predominantly Muslims and were found praying throughout the night. Later, 'woanda' was also corrupted by the Bono neighbours to become Banda. The settlement evolved to become the chief town or 'Ahenkro' within a collection of Nafana communities.
