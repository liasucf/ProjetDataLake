    "text": "The Jersey women's cricket team is the team that represents the Crown dependency of Jersey in international women's cricket matches. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2005, and an associate member in 2007. In April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Jersey women and another international side after 1 July 2018 will be a full WT20I. ==Development== Jersey Cricket requires increased participation and therefore performance from its teams. In order to achieve this, it continues to develop a sustainable structure that will provide cricket opportunities for all. To meet the needs of its growing player base, Jersey is in need of more trained coaches, umpires, scorers and administrators. Jersey has put a high priority on developing women's cricket from grass root level to the senior national side. Hiring of Gemma Dunning as female development coach, courtesy Regional funding support in Jersey, has increased participation numbers in the girls' and women's game. Jersey is working closely with Hampshire CCC and the Guernsey Cricket Board in order to offer competitive and fun playing opportunities across all age groups. ==Records and statistics== International Match Summary \u2014 Jersey Women {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 500px;\" |- | colspan=7 align=\"center\" | Playing Record |- !
