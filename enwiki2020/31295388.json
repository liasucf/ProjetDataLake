    "text": "\"I do not choose to run\" is President Calvin Coolidge's statement to the press on his decision not to run for the 1928 presidential election. The statement was ambiguous, and led to considerable debate as to the intentions of its language. Calvin Coolidge == Background == Coolidge was at his \"Summer White House\" in the Black Hills when he gave his secretary, Everett Sanders, a piece of paper that said, \"I do not choose to run for president in 1928.\" Sanders endorsed Coolidge's declaration, and the announcement was scheduled for the 9 a.m. press conference on Tuesday August 2, 1927.Greenberg, p. 137 However, to avoid an overreaction by the stock market on the east coast, the announcement was moved to midday. At 11:30, Coolidge cut out strips of paper with his statement on it, and at the conference, handed each reporter a strip. Without providing any further information, Coolidge remarked, \"There will be nothing more from this office today.\"Greenberg, p. 137 == Reaction == === Public === Upon Coolidge's announcement, the gathered media were stunned. The public, too, were shocked by the announcement. Many felt Coolidge could easily win a second full term, based on \"Coolidge Prosperity\", the booming economy, and a surplus of over $300 million.Greenberg, p. 145 === Family and colleagues === As early as 1924, Coolidge had made it clear he would not run again after his 1924 campaign. He relayed this to his father after his son Calvin Jr., died.Gilbert, p. 227 After the election, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. \"clearly remembered\" Coolidge mentioning his desire not to run again, a conversation Coolidge also reportedly had with Frank Stearns at the same time.Gilbert, p. 227 Also, Secret Service Agent Edmund Starling, who served at the White House for thirty years, and protected five presidents, recounted that Coolidge decided \"long ago\" not to run again for office.Gilbert, p. 227 While some close to Coolidge knew he wouldn't run for another term, others were stunned by his announcement, including Sanders, his personal secretary.Gilbert, p. 228 Later in the day on August 2, Grace Coolidge found out of her husband's announcement from visiting senator Arthur Capper. She remarked, \"Isn't that just like the man. He never gave me the slightest intimation of his intention. I had no idea.\"Gilbert, p. 228 == Reasons for the statement == After Coolidge's announcement there was much debate as to what he meant in his choice of words. Some took the language as a definitive statement that he was not willing to be president any longer. Others thought that he was hoping to be drafted by the party as a candidate. === Hope to be drafted === Some close to the president took the view that Coolidge was looking to be drafted by the party for the 1928 election. Vice President Charles G. Dawes believed that he \"ardently\" wanted the nomination.Gilbert, p. 229 Commerce secretary Herbert Hoover, himself considering a 1928 election bid, asked Coolidge if his decision was \"absolutely conclusive\", and the president made no direct reply. Even one of Coolidge's closest friends, Senator Butler, said of the decision, \"I do not know what he wants.\"Gilbert, p. 229 As for being drafted as the party's candidate, Coolidge stated that he \"was determined not to have that contingency arise.\"Coolidge, p. 244 === Desire for private life === Political cartoon by Clifford Berryman portraying Coolidge after his statement. Others saw Coolidge's message as a desire to get back to private life. As early as 1924, Coolidge decided he would not run for the presidency a second time. The death of his son, Cal Jr., in 1924, took a heavy toll on the president, which some say led to clinical depression. \"When he died, the power and the glory of the Presidency went with him\", Coolidge later wrote in his autobiography. He also noted that another term would put him in the White House longer than any other man had been there, and ten years is more time than any man should spend there.Greenberg, p. 138 Also, Coolidge took some steps to make sure he was not drafted for the nomination. He said, \"I do not approve the circulation of a petition, such as has been reported in the morning press, requesting me to run for president in 1928. I don't see that anything good could come from it. I hope it will be discontinued.\" He also announced in December 1927, \"My statement stands. No one should be led to suppose that I have modified it. My decision will be respected.\"Gilbert, p. 229 Informed that some Massachusetts Republicans were mounting a campaign to have him win their state's presidential primary, Coolidge informed the Republican state chairman \"Such an action would be most embarrassing to me\u2026 I request that it not be done.\"Gilbert, p. 229 While the language was open for debate, some pointed out that it was the language of a Vermont Yankee. \"The Yankee language is founded on understatement and not overstatement,\" said publisher Charles Thompson.Gilbert, p. 229 === Honoring two-term tradition === Within the Republican party, there was talk that the \"no third term tradition\" could damage Coolidge's, and thus the party's, chances come election day. This led to some party members calling for him not to run for a third term, though most scholars feel their opinion had little effect on Coolidge's reasoning.Gilbert, p. 228 At the time, the Twenty-second Amendment was not a part of the Constitution and thus the \"two term tradition\" was not a firm limit but rather a constitutional convention. There had only been one previous instance of a former vice president winning even one election in his own right after succeeding to the Presidency, this being when Theodore Roosevelt was re- elected in 1904 after succeeding the assassinated William McKinley. However, Roosevelt had served nearly all of McKinley's second term, which may have influenced his decision not to run again in 1908, although he did run unsuccessfully in 1912 against his successor, William Howard Taft. By contrast, Coolidge had only served a little more than half of Harding's unexpired term before winning election in his own right. Nevertheless, some believe that Coolidge was honoring the two-term tradition set by President George Washington, even though Coolidge held the opinion that a vice president who succeeded to part of another president's term would not violate the rule by then running twice for election in his own right.Greenberg, p. 138 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding his actual reasons for not running, Coolidge continued the tradition. Ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment limited the number of times that a person can be elected president to two. Moreover, it further reduced that limit to one in the case of those who had previously served more than half of the unexpired presidential term of another President, which incidentally would have applied to Coolidge had the Amendment been in force during his presidency. The Amendment has yet to apply to anyone succeeding to the presidency - a grandfather clause exempted Harry S. Truman once the amendment came into force, while Lyndon B. Johnson served less than half of John F. Kennedy's term when he became president after Kennedy's assassination. Moreoever, both men initially attempted to run for a second full four-year term, only to both abandon their respective runs for after each made a disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary. ==Popular culture== The phrase entered popular culture of the era. The tune \"I Do Not Choose to Run\", credited to Kenny & Dennishttp://www.oocities.org/Cag03/NovIDoNot.html was recorded in March 1928 by Harry Reser's jazz band for Brunswick Records. The humorous lyrics tell the story of a watch which, rather than ticking and telling time, utters Coolidge's famous phrase.http://www.redhotjazz.com/hreserbands.html An episode of The Dick van Dyke Show is titled \"I Do Not Choose to Run\". In the episode, Rob chooses not to run for city council. In the Seinfeld episode \"The Race\", Jerry tells a story about how he won a high school race, and has been branded as a fast runner because he inadvertently got a head start. When asked to race again in order to confirm the results, Jerry responds by saying, \"I choose not to run.\" == References == ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Political quotes Category:Presidency of Calvin Coolidge Category:1928 United States presidential election Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 1920s ",
