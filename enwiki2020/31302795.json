She is also the founder of the International Sacral Agenesis/Caudal Regression Syndrome Association, or iSACRA, an organization for information sharing, support, and networking. ==Early life== Rogers was born in Brazil where she spent the first part of her life in an isolated crib in a care facility for adults with severe cognitive limitations. At 14 months old she was adopted into a single parent household with many siblings who have different special needs. Jessica was born with the rare condition of lumbosacral agenesis/caudal regression syndrome and has had bilateral leg amputations due to the condition. Her spine ends at approximately T 7\u201310, which caused some paralysis. Jessica was born with one kidney and a very small lower anatomy, a common trait associated with caudal regression syndrome.
