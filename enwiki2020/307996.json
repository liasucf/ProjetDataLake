    "text": "The English Electric Lightning was one of the first aircraft capable of supercruise. Supercruise is sustained supersonic flight of a supersonic aircraft with a useful cargo, passenger, or weapons load performed efficiently, which typically precludes the use of highly inefficient afterburners or \"reheat\". Many well known supersonic military aircraft not capable of supercruise can only maintain Mach 1+ flight in short bursts, typically with afterburners. Aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird are designed to cruise at supersonic speed with afterburners enabled. One of the best known examples of an aircraft capable of supercruise was Concorde. Due to its long service as a commercial airliner, Concorde holds the record for the most time spent in supercruise; more than all other aircraft combined. == Advantages == The main advantage is the ability of an aircraft to fly at supersonic speed without using its afterburner which consumes large amounts of fuel and limits its range. Supercruise capability also provides advantages for stealth aircraft, because an afterburner plume reflects radar signals and creates a significant infrared signature. == History == Concorde routinely supercruised most of the way over the Atlantic, enabling it to travel from London to New York in three hours, a record which has yet to be surpassed by any other commercial aircraft. On 3August 1954, a Gerfaut research aircraft powered by an SNECMA Atar 101D2A engine exceeded Mach1 on level flight without using afterburners.\"The Development of Jet and Turbine Aero Engines\" 4th edition, Bill Gunston, 2006, , p. 160 The first production aircraft intended to exceed Mach 1 in dry level flight was the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter which featured a radical design, with razor-thin, stubby wings attached substantially farther back on the fuselage than most contemporary aircraft. The wing provided excellent supersonic and high-speed, low-altitude performance, but resulted in poor turning capability and high landing speeds. It was the first production aircraft to achieve Mach 2, and the first aircraft to reach an altitude of 100,000 feet after taking off under its own power. The Starfighter established world records for airspeed, altitude, and time-to-climb in 1958, becoming the first aircraft to hold all three simultaneously. The un-reheated Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire powered P.1 prototype of the English Electric Lightning, exceeded Mach1 on 11August 1954. A week previous, on 4August, the P.1, WG760 flown by Roland Beamont on its maiden flight, had unknowingly exceeded Mach1 in a climb, although, due to position error, the Machmeter had only shown a maximum of Mach0.95. Beamont, who had not noticed any change in behaviour of the aircraft, was surprised when informed after the flight data had been analysed. However, this early demonstration of super sonic flight was extremely limited, as the Lightning could only cruise without reheat at approximately Mach 1.02,English Electric Aircraft and their Predecessors, Stephen Ransom & Robert Fairclough, Putnam, London, 1987, (p.227) while later versions were able to achieve much higher speeds, but only for very short time periods. Since the E-E Lightning cannot sustain supersonic speed for 20 minutes as originally stated in the first mission statement by Major Boyd, et al to mention \"Supercruise\" it should not be labeled as such! The BAC TSR-2 strike and reconnaissance aircraft, which first flew on 27September 1964, was one of the first military aircraft specifically designed to cruise supersonically; one of the planned mission profiles was for a supersonic cruise at Mach 2.0 at . Supersonic cruise at lower levels was at Mach1.1 at . The TSR-2 used Bristol Olympus engines, a later version of which would also power Concorde. Qualitative variation in Cd factor (drag coefficient) with Mach number (speed) for aircraft; supercruising above Mach2 is efficient. Only the supersonic transports (SST), Concorde and the last version of the Tu-144 (the Tu-144D), spent most of their time cruising at their design speeds without needing afterburning. Some combat aircraft that are listed as capable of supercruise may only be able to do so without an external weapons load, for example. Reheat was added to Concorde for take-off to cope with weight increases that came after the initial design. As it was available, it was also used for transonic acceleration to reduce the time taken and fuel used to reach cruise. The upgraded Tu-144D had more economical engines than the Tu-144, which did not require afterburners during cruise, as well as a more advanced intake design, which increased the full payload range from (Concorde's operational range was ).TUPOLEV Tu-144, Gordon, Komissarov and Rigmant 2015, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., , p.248 == Military use == The term \"supercruise\" was originally used to describe a fighter performance requirement set forth by USAF Col. John Boyd, Pierre Sprey, and Col. Everest Riccioni, proponents of the F-16 Falcon. Following the entry into production of the F-16, they began work on an improved fighter design with the ability to cruise supersonically over enemy territory for a minimum of twenty minutes. As air combat is often the result of surprise, and the speed of combat is determined by the speed of the surprising aircraft, this would have given a supercruise-capable design a worthwhile performance advantage in many situations. The postulated fighter would have had a top speed of just over Mach 1, and a fuel fraction in excess of 40%, the minimum required to meet the twenty-minute requirement. The fuel fraction requirement necessitated a very austere design with few advanced electronics. The United States Air Force showed no interest in the proposal at that time, but years later revived the term and redefined it to apply to the requirements for the Advanced Tactical Fighter,The Cutting Age, p.141 which resulted in the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 Raptor is capable of supercruise at Mach 1.8 (but is seen here running afterburner). The Dassault Rafale is capable of supercruising with four missiles and a belly drop tank.French Ministry of Defense Orders a Further 59 Rafale Fighters The Eurofighter Typhoon is capable of supercruise at Mach 1.5. The F-22 Raptor's supercruise capabilities are touted as a major performance advantage over other fighters, with supercruise being demonstrated up to at least Mach1.8.Ayton, Mark. \"F-22 Raptor\". AirForces Monthly, August 2008, p. 75. Retrieved: 19 July 2008. Virtually all current and past jet fighters, prior to the F-22, cruise at approximately Mach0.8\u20130.9 with militarily significant weapons loads.\"Gallery of USAF Weapons\", pp. 147\u2013155. Air Force Magazine, May 2006. However, supercruising uses more fuel to travel the same distance than at subsonic speeds, with the Air Force Association estimating that use of supercruise for a dash as part of a mission would cut the F-22's combat radius from about to about . This reduction is unconfirmed because the altitude and flight profile are classified, as are most of the F-22's capabilities, but it is still far less of a reduction than would result from the use of afterburner. There are a few engines in production that are designed to facilitate tactically significant supercruise: * The two Pratt & Whitney F119 that power the F-22 Raptor make it the most capable supercruiser fighter aircraft in service. The F-22 Raptor can supercruise up to Mach 1.8 without external stores.General Jumper qualifies in F/A-22 Raptor, af.mil, January 13, 2005Last of its kind. Flightglobal. (Note: General Electric YF120 supercruise capable engines also powered an F-22 prototype during this fly off, but were not selected for production.) * The EJ200 engine built by EuroJet Turbo GmbH mounted in the Eurofighter Typhoon. It is capable of supercruising at Mach 1.5 with an air superiority missile load. Typhoon pilots have stated that Mach 1.3 is attainable in combat configuration with external stores. * The General Electric F414G in JAS 39 Gripen NG is designed for supercruise and has been shown to achieve Mach 1.2.\"Gripen Supercruises.\" Gripen International, 21 January 2009. * The Snecma M88 that power the Dassault Rafale. The twin engines enable the Rafale to supercruise with four missiles and a belly drop tank. * The two AL-41F-1S engines of the Sukhoi Su-35 can achieve supersonic speed without engaging afterburners.\"AL-41F-1C.\" Independently, Russia is working on Izdelje 30 (after AL31F and AL41F derivatives modifications, like 117S turbofan) and RD33MKRU Morskaja Osa; an all new AL-41 engine with a complete redesign underway to add supercruise ability to the Sukhoi Su-57. This has yet to bear fruit, but the stop-gap 117S engine, produced by this program, seems to achieve the supercruise goal already. It was recently announced that during testing of a Su-35BM fighter equipped with these engines it was travelling at just past supersonic speed it continued to accelerate without the use of the afterburner, thus suggesting that it had supercruise capability, though it has yet to be seen whether this will be possible with a combat load. All known supercruise aircraft can only do so at considerable altitude (where the air is thinner and so offers less resistance), which restricts the use of terrain mask for eluding detection. == Aircraft designed to cruise on afterburner == The Lockheed A-12, SR-71 Blackbird, and YF-12, were designed for sustained operation at supersonic speeds using an afterburner. SR-71 missions flew at maximum range cruise, with afterburner settings in the lower portion of the range, about 98% of the time.\"Flying the SR-71\", Col. Graham, USAF (Ret.), , Zenith Press, 2008, p.132 The North American XB-70 Valkyrie used six General Electric YJ93 engines for sustained flight at Mach3.0, its design point.\"B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report Volume III\", April 1972, SD-72-SH-0003, Space Division, North American Rockwell Unlike the J-58 engine in the SR-71, the YJ93 did not need special fuel, as it used JP-6. Partial afterburner was used for cruise.\"Variable- Geometry Exhaust Nozzles and their Effects on Airplane Performance\" Ammer and Punch, General Electric Co., SAE 680295, Society of Automotive Engineers The XB-70A AV-2 prototype sustained speeds in excess of Mach3 for 32 minutes on one flight. The type was designed to operate at its design point speed for periods of hours over intercontinental ranges. At 100% military thrust (maximum throttle without afterburner), at , the XB-70 would exceed M1.03 so long as its mass did not exceed , rising to M1.2 as the mass dropped to T.O. 1B-70(X)A-1A Flight Handbook Supplement XB-70A page A5-4 The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 was designed for supersonic cruise at Mach 2.35 with partial afterburner in operation. The engines used an extremely low pressure ratio of 4.75, but this was boosted by ram air pressure during supersonic flight.Soviet Spyplanes of the Cold War, Casemate, Yefim Gordon P.70 The low pressure ratio of the compressor meant poor efficiency at subsonic speeds, and high efficiency at supersonic speeds. The BAC TSR-2 was designed to cruise at M2.0 using afterburners, and had a predicted top speed of M2.35. It could also cruise supersonically without afterburner, as demonstrated on a delivery flight.Thornborough, Anthony. TSR2 (Aeroguide Special). Suffolk, UK: Ad Hoc Publications, 2005.
