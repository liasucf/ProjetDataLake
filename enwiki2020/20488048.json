    "text": "Dexter Marsh is a marsh located at the eastern end of Lake Ontario in Dexter, New York. It was declared a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. The marsh is managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as the Dexter Marsh Wildlife Management Area. The marsh is a popular fishing and trapping area as well as a migratory bird layover. Lacking barrier beaches, it is directly exposed to Lake Ontario's winds and waves. It is a relatively undeveloped bay-head area on the Great Lakes. ==See also== *List of National Natural Landmarks in New York *List of New York state wildlife management areas ==References== ==External links== * NYS Department of Environmental Conservation: Dexter Marsh * Map of Dexter Marsh Category:National Natural Landmarks in New York (state) Category:Wildlife management areas of New York (state) Category:Protected areas of Jefferson County, New York Category:Landforms of Jefferson County, New York Category:Marshes of New York (state) ",
