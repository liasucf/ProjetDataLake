The film follows the lives of three brothers living in Miami's notorious brown sub ghettos. Hip hop performers Swizz Beatz, Fat Joe and DJ Kaleb appear in the film. ==Background== Elliot Lovett, whom Gittoes befriended during the filming of Soundtrack to War, told him of his family and his younger brother Marcus, who he insisted was a gifted poet-rapper. Gittoes made the trip to Miami to meet the family, with the intention of creating a Stateside sequel to Soundtrack to War, continuing the theme of music in a dangerous place. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Documentary films about hip hop music and musicians Category:Australian films Category:Australian documentary films Category:Films set in Miami Category:2006 films Category:English-language films Category:2006 documentary films Category:Documentary films about African-American gangs ",
