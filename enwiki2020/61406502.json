    "text": "The Liverpool Plinth is an art space that showcases sculptures for a 12-month period on a plinth outside Liverpool Parish Church in Liverpool, UK. The Liverpool Plinth, in the mould of Trafalgar Square\u2019s Fourth Plinth, occupies a prominent position overlooking Chapel Street and Liverpool\u2019s waterfront. It laid empty since the removal of Brian Burgess\u2019s \u201cChrist on a Donkey\u201d several years ago. First set up in 2018, each sculpture is chosen via a competition open to artists living or working in the north of England (North West, North East, Yorkshire and the Humber). The winner receives \u00a31000. The project was set up by Liverpool Parish Church, working with the Liverpool BID Company along with city gallery and art organisation, dot-art. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Dates ! Winning Sculpture ! Artist !Description ! Picture |- | June 2018 \u2013 June 2019 | Gold Lam\u00e9 | Tony Heaton |Materials: Fibreglass, steel, automotive paint. Dimensions: 9\u20199\u201d(h)x4\u20196\u201d(w) 525(h)x137(w)cm Created: 2014 A suspended, bright gold Invacar which aimes to act as a catalyst for discussion and debate on how disabled people are currently viewed and considered within contemporary society, including that of religion and faith. The Invacar was a societal response initiated by the government in recognition of the increased number of former servicemen injured in the Second World War and a lack of access to public transport. Gold Lam\u00e9 was originally commissioned by DaDaFest for their festival in 2014. | Gold Lam\u00e9 by Tony Heaton, sculpture showcased in The Liverpool Plinth in 2018. |- | June 2019 \u2013 July 2020 | Split Decisions | Sam Shendi |Materials: Bronze, steel, castors Dimensions: 420(w)x120(h)x80(d)cm Split Decisions is part of a collection called \u2018Only Human\u2019 which as a collective explores the themes of mental health and depression. This particular piece expresses the difficulty in making a decision when you are in a depressed state for whatever length of time. It represents the fear of taking a direction, making a choice, to move from a place a person is currently in. The colours are emotions so for example, red being anger or sexuality, green for hope and innocence, pink for childhood and a sweetness etc. The central figure is black and blue, using the expression \u2018black and blue\u2019 for pain. So in this confusion of being unable to make a choice we feel this pain, black and blue, unaware of the bright side of the options or opportunities that lie before us in either direction. This is represented by the legs stretched out and the colours presenting those opportunities. |Split Decision by Sam Shendi, sculpture showcased in The Liverpool Plinth in 2019 |- |July 2020 \u2013 Present |Tidal Shame |Gail Dooley |Materials: Stoneware Ceramic, Metal and Found Objects Dimensions: 168(h)x93(w)x80(d)cm The ceramic bird depicted in Tidal Shame is a gannet, a sea bird which is common to the city of Liverpool. Trapped by authentic sea plastic and detritus collected from UK shores, this sculptural installation presents a striking image of our global marine problem and the real concern we must have of protecting animals. Not only does Tidal Shame showcase the effects that plastic waste has on the natural world, the sculpture highlights the impact that waste has on the birds that inhabit it. Tidal Shame echoes the importance of celebrating our fellow creatures. |Tidal Shame by Gail Dooley, sculpture showcased in The Liverpool Plinth in 2020 |} ==References== Category:Outdoor sculptures in England ",
