In 1997, the KHF focused more specifically on children's health. Partnering with the state's largest advertising agency, Sullivan, Higdon, Sink, the KHF developed the \"Take It Outside\" campaign to urge adults to avoid smoking in homes and buildings where children are present.Wichita foundation spends millions to focus Kansans on healthy children, 1997-09-21, Wichita Business Journal The KHF later became heavily involved with Kansas state government, and universities, and local governments in Kansas \u2014 particularly through the joint Kansas Public Health Workforce Development Coordinating Council \u2014 to fund, develop and coordinate public health workforce training through various educational methodologies, delivery methods and opportunities.

Growing from the original $200 million endowment, the foundation reportedly had $440 million in assets in 2010, to $469 million in assets by the end of 2012. Assets topped $475 million, by May 2013, ultimately reaching $519 million in net assets in 2013http://www.faqs.org/tax-exempt/KS/Kansas-Health-Foundation.html, making the foundation the largest philanthropic entity in the state, according to KHI Pres. Steven Coen, and making it one of the nation's wealthiest such foundations, according to its official website. The foundation funds programs with the interest earned from investments of the original endowment, preserving it as a perpetual funding source. In 2012, it issued over $22.9 million in grants, and by then it had issued over $500 million in grants since its origins in 1985. ==Key People== The foundation is led by President and CEO Steve Coen and Board of Director Chairwoman Commissioner Shelly Buhler. ==Facilities== KHF operates out of its custom-built $9-million downtown multi- story glass building at 309 E. Douglas, in Wichita, Kansas (zip 67202), since the building's completion in 2013. The facility is shared with some of the KHF's affiliate entities, including the Kansas Leadership Center. ==Outcomes== Little clear and detailed information is readily available online about the correlation between Kansas health changes and KHF-backed programs. ===General Health=== Citing the website America\u2019s Health Rankings] (an annual report published by major philanthropic organizations and health groups), the KHF concedes that Kansas fell from the 8th to the 27th healthiest state in the country, during the years 1991 through 2014, when KHF programs were well underway. ===Children=== According to the 2014 KIDS COUNT Data Book, by the Annie E. Casey Foundation \u2014 the leading reference on child health and welfare in the U.S. \u2014 Kansas ranked 15th among the 50 states in overall child well- being. \"Kansas and the Annie E. Casey Foundation\", Kids Count Data Book, 2014, Annie E. Casey Foundation (NOTE: Earlier data was not readily available). ===Smoking and Tobacco Use=== Tobacco use (particularly cigarette smoking) is Kansas' top cause of preventable death and disease, with one of every five Kansas adults smoking cigarettes. However, the KHF largely blames this on decisions by Kansas legislators and governors to underfund tobacco prevention, making Kansas (in 2013) 41st in the nation for per-capita spending on tobacco prevention. In 2013, the federal government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that states spend $32.1 million annually on tobacco prevention, but Kansas was only funding such programs at $946,671 per year \u2014 desipite collecting a combined $154.3 million in 2013 from the settlement and tobacco taxes. Critics cite Kansas politicians' decisions to divert the state's share of the tobacco lawsuit settlement away from tobacco- use prevention and mitigation \u2014 towards completely unrelated activity, particularly to plug shortfalls in the state budget and facilitate tax cuts.Bruce, Giles, Anti-tobacco advocates say Kansas has underfunded smoking prevention, December 9, 2013, Lawrence Journal-World Kansas Department of Health and Education former spokeswoman Miranda Steele has countered that the state's high-school smoking rate (at 14%, below the nationwide average of 18%) is below the smoking rates of neighboring states, including some which spend more, per person, on tobacco prevention. ==References== Category:Medical and health organizations based in Kansas ",
