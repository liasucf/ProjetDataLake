    "text": "The Three Sisters are a trio of peaks near Canmore, Alberta, Canada. They are known individually as Big Sister, Middle Sister and Little Sister. In the traditional language of the \u00cey\u00e2rhe Nakoda (Stoney) the peaks are also referred to as the three sisters. However, the name refers to a story of \u0128-ktomn\u0129, the old man or trickster, who would promise 'three sisters' in marriage whenever he was in trouble.http://www.rockymountainnakoda.com/language/Geographic%20Landmarks ==History== In 1883, Albert Rogers, a nephew of Major A. B. Rogers, named the three summits for the first time: Initially called the Three Nuns, they were later renamed the Three Sisters. This last name first appeared on George Mercer Dawson's 1886 map, which apparently found the name, and was more appropriate in a spirit of Protestantism. ==Peaks== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! align=left|Peak !! metres !! feet !!

Little Sister is a more difficult ascent requiring technical climbing skills. The Three Sisters Traverse is an obscure and dangerous climb seldom done. ==External links== ==References== Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Mountains of Alberta ",
