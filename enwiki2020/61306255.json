The 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was the lead element of the Division and was air-lifted to Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i Base Camp to begin operations. The 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division established a base of operations at T\u00e2y Ninh Combat Base, while 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division concluded Operation Comanche Falls III and began moving to its base of operations at Tonle Cham Camp. The operation was part of II Field Force, Vietnam's Operation Toan Thang II and began on 7 November 1968, as the 1st Cavalry Division moved into III Corps. The mission of the division during this operation was to conduct offensive operations in an assigned tactical area of operations, interdict movement of major PAVN forces south into critical areas of III Corps, locate and destroy PAVN forces, facilities, and material, and be prepared to deploy all or part of the division throughout III/IV Corps. ==Operation== The 1st Brigade was to conduct offensive operations against PAVN forces and installations in northeastern T\u00e2y Ninh Province with one battalion making a reconnaissance in force north and west of Thien Nhon ().
