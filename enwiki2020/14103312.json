His father was a high ranking Crown servant (Pagador-Geral da Marinha) that had allied himself with the liberal cause during the Portuguese Civil War. His mother came from a wealthy landed family, the Corr\u00eaa de Almeida (Counts of S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio), that owned much of the land in the parish,Including the Quinta da Terrugem. With the Napoleonic invasions of Portugal, most of their wealth was lost to the invading French troops. \"Miss\u00e3o Diplom\u00e1tica do Conde Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos no Brasil \u2013 1974\", preface pp. XXII-XXIV with the notable exception of the Palace of the Arches (Pal\u00e1cio dos Arcos)This beautiful palace dates from the end of the 15th century and today belongs to the municipality of Oeiras, where Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos is located. Legend has it the parish of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was named after this palace where King Manuel I watched Vasco da Gama's caravels depart for India. that had belonged to the Counts of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas for centuries. He married on September 6, 1876 Em\u00edlia Ang\u00e9lica de Castro Monteiro (b. Maia, Pedrou\u00e7os, October 3, 1848), maternal granddaughter of the Viscounts and Counts of Castro, and had issue. The titles of Viscount and Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos are held by the Correia da Silva family of Portugal. ==Naval career== He excelled in school from an early age, having attended the School for Nobles (Real Col\u00e9gio dos Nobres) and later enrolled in the Portuguese Naval Academy (Escola Naval) at the age of 14, for which royal permission was needed. At 18 the young ensign had his first experience under fire having been given his first command of the schooner Venus whose mission was to apprehend the pirate Apack in the South China Sea. As a young second lieutenant he was appointed Knight of the Military Order of the Tower and Sword (Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada), Portugal's highest decoration awarded for bravery in combat, for his heroics in pursuing and capturing the Spanish slave ship Virgen del Refugio off the coast of Portuguese Guinea in 1864. As a 27-year-old second lieutenant in 1862 the Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos also commanded the schooner Napier in pursuit of the US confederate pirate ship CSS Alabama in the mid Atlantic near the Azores. He held many other commands, including the brig Pedro Nunes as first lieutenant, which had been King Luis I's personal command before accession to the throne. His appointment was a personal decision of the King with whom he shared a passion for the sea and later a close friendship. Usually such a prestigious command was held by someone of much higher rank and his appointment was proof of the King's confidence in his abilities as a leader of men.\"Miss\u00e3o Diplom\u00e1tica do Conde Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos no Brasil \u2013 1974\", preface pp. XXIV-XXX He later commanded the gunboat Zarco and the corvettes Sagres and Estef\u00e2nia, eventually rising to the top of his career as a naval officer in the Portuguese Royal Navy, having achieved the rank of Vice-Admiral (1895) and Major-General of the Armada (the highest rank of the Portuguese Royal Navy) before his retirement one year prior to his death in 1905. ==Colonial and diplomatic career== The 1stCount of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos had a notable colonial career throughout the Portuguese Empire, having reached its pinnacle as Governor- General of Portuguese India (1881).\"Vice-Reis e Governadores da \u00cdndia Portuguesa \u2013 1999\", pp. 318\u2013319 He was also Governor of Macao (1876\u20131879) and Mozambique (1880), as well as Portugal's first Ambassador to Brazil (1891\u20131893) after the former colony abolished the monarchy and sent Emperor Pedro II of Brazil of the House of Bragan\u00e7a into exile. This prestigious diplomatic post was fraught with difficulties as he represented to the new Brazilian republican government the reigning Portuguese House of Bragan\u00e7a which their ousted Emperor belonged to.\"Miss\u00e3o Diplom\u00e1tica do Conde Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos no Brasil \u2013 1974\" In his diplomatic career he was also Minister Plenipotentiary to China, Japan and the Kingdom of Siam. ==Civil Governor of Lisbon== As Governor of Lisbon in 1890 the Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was responsible for ordering the bloody police crackdown after days of rioting followed the issuing of the British Ultimatum regarding Portuguese colonies in Africa. The republican underground in Portugal seized the opportunity of the humiliating British Ultimatum to blame the monarchy and the King for Portugal's loss of prestige. After news of the Ultimatum and Portugal's concessions in Africa (present day Zimbabwe) reached the Portuguese people, Lisbon was thrown into a state of turmoil following massive rioting which threatened to bring down the regime. This was perhaps the first sign of what was to come when 18 years later King Carlos I and the Prince Royal Luis F\u00edlipe were assassinated by members of the jacobin Carbon\u00e1ria in downtown Lisbon on February 1, 1908, eventually leading to the republican revolution of October 5, 1910. The Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos, in his role as Governor and commander of the police in Lisbon, fulfilled his duty without hesitation, ordering the police to use force, which led to his vilification by the republican press of the time.This is clearly seen in the accusations of Basilio Teles in his \"Do Ultimatum ao 31 de Janeiro (1905)\". This schoolteacher was a member of the Portuguese Republican Party and allegedly also of the Carbon\u00e1ria, having been exiled for his involvement in the uprising of Porto in 1891. He accused the Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos of being an homme \u00e0 poigne of the Crown and of being a sabreur. ==Promotion to \"Grande do Reino\"== Because of his service to the Crown, the Viscount of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was promoted in the Portuguese nobility to a Grandee of Portugal (Grande do Reino)Similar to the Grandees of Spain. In Portuguese nobility, all titles of Count and above (Marquis and Duke) are considered Grandes do Reino. Some lower titles (namely Baron and Viscount) can also be elevated by the King to Grandeza, although this was a rare occurrence. The \"Grandes do Reino\" represent the upper strata within the nobility, second only to the Royal Family, and enjoyed special privileges not afforded to the other nobles. when King Carlos I elevated his title to a Countship (Earl in Britain). His only son Henrique was, like his father, a distinguished naval officer and colonial ruler.He was a Captain (Capit\u00e3o de Mar e Guerra) in the Portuguese Navy, Minister of the Colonies (Ministro do Ultramar) and, like his father, Governor of Macao but, unlike his father, also a republican. In keeping with his family's tradition of bravery, Henrique was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Service Order by King George V of Great Britain for his decisive action in saving British warships from being torpedoed by German U-boats off the coast of Cape Verde during World War I. Because of his beliefs and because of the republican revolution implanted by force of arms in 1910, he never claimed officially (encartar) the title of Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos which nonetheless passed on to his eldest surviving son \u2013 also named Henrique. ==Other achievements and distinctions== The Count of Pa\u00e7o d'Arcos was also a member of His Most Faithful Majesty's Council (Conselho de Sua Majestade Fidel\u00edssima), the Chamber of Deputies (C\u00e2mara dos Deputados) and a Peer of the Realm (Par do Reino) as well as Aide-de-Camp to the King (Ajudante de Campo d'el rei).
