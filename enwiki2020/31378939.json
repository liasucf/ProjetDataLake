    "text": "\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry\" is a song by the British synthpop band Heaven 17, released in 1983 as the fifth and final single from their second studio album The Luxury Gap. It was written by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware, and produced by Marsh and Ware (as British Electric Foundation) and Greg Walsh. It reached No. 17 in the UK and spent seven weeks on the chart. It would be the band's last Top 20 hit in the UK until 1992's \"Temptation (Brothers In Rhythm Remix)\". ==Critical reception== Upon release, Tom Hilbert of Smash Hits commented: \"Highly entertaining pop funk with sardonic 'woo-woos' and a cynical jab at society in general. Witty dance music with gormless backing chants and a piano that is everything that Shakatak isn't.\" Number One wrote: \"Thankfully Heaven 17 have finally clicked and make dance records that you can actually dance to (unlike \"Penthouse and Pavement\"). Now their stylish sound is pure nourishment for the feet, as well as for the head and heart.\" Paul Simper for Number One said: \"The threesome did work pretty hard at getting a hit before with fine dance records like \"Penthouse and Pavement\" and \"Play to Win\"; \"Crushed By the Wheels\" is along similar lines and though still less than great it's easily the best of the three they've made as popstars.\" ==Formats== ;7\" single #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Part I)\" - 3:43 #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Part II)\" - 3:15 ;12\" single #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Parts I & II - Uninterrupted single version)\" - 6:58 #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Album version)\" - 5:55 #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Extended dance version)\" - 6:21 ;12\" single (US release) #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Industrial Mix)\" - 6:54 #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Album version)\" - 5:51 #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (Dub version)\" - 6:17 ;12\" single (Canada release) #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (The Industrial version)\" - 6:52 #\"Crushed by the Wheels of Industry (The Extended dance version)\" - 6:20 ==Personnel== Heaven 17 * Glenn Gregory - vocals * Martyn Ware - synthesizers, backing vocals, producer * Ian Craig Marsh - synthesizers, producer Additional personnel * Greg Walsh - producer, engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1983) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|French Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|34 |- |align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|17 |} ==References== Category:1983 singles Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh Category:1983 songs Category:Virgin Records singles ",
