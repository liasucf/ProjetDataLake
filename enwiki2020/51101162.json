    "text": "Jonathan Pie is a fictional character created and portrayed by English comedian Tom Walker. A political correspondent, Pie appears in a series of online videos in which he rants and explodes in anger about the state of British, American and Australian politics, with the videos being presented as though he were a real reporter speaking his personal opinions to the camera before or after filming a regular news segment. ==History== The first spoof news report featuring Pie, released just after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party in September 2015, was responding to mainstream media reports that gave particular weight to Corbyn's past relationship with Diane Abbott. Walker was soon approached by several media companies, including RT UK, which offered him complete creative control. He worked with RT for several months before leaving in July 2016, just before his appearance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August. The character received international coverage after the 2016 US election, when his comments on Donald Trump's victory went viral, becoming a YouTube trending video. The video had more than 4 million views as of early 2020, more than 10 times any of his preceding videos. PJ Media did not recognise Jonathan Pie as a fictitious character, presenting him instead as a real-life, professional \"British lefty reporter\". Pie has occasionally appeared as the London correspondent for the Australian satirical news and current events programme The Weekly with Charlie Pickering. Pie went on his second tour in 2018 with \"Back to the Studio\". He performed 45 dates in the UK, five dates in Australia and six dates in the US. In January 2020, a collaboration with environmental film maker Franny Armstrong led to a 13-minute mockumentary called Pie Net Zero. Some episodes, including the post- US election episode, were co-written with Andrew Doyle. Andrew's contribution began when the live show started. === Live tours === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
