    "text": "The Global T20 Canada is a 20-over cricket tournament played in Canada. The first edition of the tournament took place during June and July 2018 with six teams competing. Each team featured four local Canadian cricketers in each squad, along with international players. The inaugural tournament in 2018 took place at the Maple Leaf Cricket Club in King City, Ontario, while the 2019 tournament took place at the CAA Centre in Brampton, Ontario. Bombay Sports Limited are the owners of the league, and also the organizers of the Euro T20 Slam that was set to begin on August 30, 2019. The International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the tournament in February 2018, and it is the first fully sanctioned T20 league in North America outside of the Caribbean. Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was pleased with the ICC's decision to approve the league. In May 2018, Cricket Canada announced that the inaugural edition of the tournament would start on 28 June, with the final being held on 15 July 2018. Vancouver Knights won the tournament, beating Cricket West Indies B Team by seven wickets in the final. The 2019 league began on 25 July, with the final match taking place on 11 August. The second- round game between Montreal Tigers and Toronto Nationals on August 7, 2019, was delayed for two hours in a protest over unpaid wages; some pay issues date back to the 2018 tournament. The protest occurred even though Toronto Nationals captain Yuvraj Singh's fundraiser for his YouWeCan Foundation, had been hosted two days earlier by League organizers. The third season of the tournament, scheduled to be held in 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Teams== ===Current=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Team ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Debut ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Captain ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Coach |- | Brampton Wolves | 2019 | Daren Sammy | Phil Simmons |- | Edmonton Royals | 2018 | Mohammad Hafeez | Stephen Fleming |- | Montreal Tigers | 2018 | George Bailey | Tom Moody |- | Toronto Nationals | 2018 | Yuvraj Singh | Geoff Lawson |- | Vancouver Knights | 2018 | Shoaib Malik | Donovan Miller |- | Winnipeg Hawks | 2018 | Rayad Emrit | Lalchand Rajput |} ===Former=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Team ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Debut ! style=\"color:#fff; background:#ff0000;\"| Last |- | Cricket West Indies B Team | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | 2018 |} == Results == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !rowspan=2 scope=col|Season !colspan=3|Final !rowspan=2 scope=col|Final venue !rowspan=2 scope=col|Player of the series |- !scope=col|Winner !scope=col|Winning margin !scope=col|Runner-up |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2018 | Vancouver Knights | Won by 7 wickets | Cricket West Indies B Team | Maple Leaf Cricket Club in King City, Ontario | Lendl Simmons (Winnipeg Hawks) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2019 | Winnipeg Hawks | Won super over by 5 runs | Vancouver Knights | CAA Centre in Brampton, Ontario | JP Duminy (Winnipeg Hawks) |} == Media == Mediapro was appointed as \"global consultant\" for Global T20 Canada's media rights in 2019, handling aspects of world feed production and international distribution via its various regional subsidiaries.
