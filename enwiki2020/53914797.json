    "text": "The Praga R1R is a mid-engined sports car produced by Praga. The R1R represents the first road car made by Praga since 1947, which means 68 years. Because of the 68-year long term hiatus, Praga decided to only make 68 units of the car. The car is based on the Praga R1, a race car by Praga that races in the Dutch Supercar Challenge. == Specifications == The car is powered by a Renault Sport-sourced 2.0-liter F4R turbocharged inline-four, which produces , the power being dependent on the customer's setup. The power is delivered to the rear wheels by a Hewland-built 6-speed semi-automatic transmission, and also making the R1R rear-wheel drive. The transmission also uses a centrifugal clutch. The car has a tendency to backfire constantly when making up-shifts and downshifts. The car has a measurement in curb weight, making the car extremely lightweight, thanks to the use of carbon fiber. The body also features a subframe back at the rear for the engine. The R1R also uses inboard suspension both front and rear, which also features inboard pushrod-operated Koni dampers. The car is able to push downforce that creates more weight than its own curb weight. The R1R is also reported to have a much higher safety level than the race car. == Design == The design of the car is slightly similar to the R1 race car, albeit with a few differences. The headlights and tail lights are now two bulbs instead of a longer straightened variant, the rear wing shape is smaller and is placed in a different position, and the top air tunnel is shaped differently. The design is also slightly smaller than the race car, being smaller in wheelbase, and smaller in length. Other than those changes, the design is still adapted from the R1 racer. The interior is also adapted from the R1, but also with a few differences. The seats have been changed to adapt to road regulations and to give the driver and passenger (if at two-seat configuration) more comfort. == Reception == Evo tested the R1R on August 15, 2016 with Jethro Bovingdon and gave the car a 4/5 rating. According to Evo, the 2.0-liter Renault Sport engine has big character, the R1R has massive downforce, and is very capable on the track. One downside they gave it, however, is that because of how the car is based on a race car and how it is similar to it, it doesn't make the car good for the road, and the seating positions, whether it is single-seat or two-seat, are difficult. Jon Olsson, a professional freeskier and alpine ski racer, gave the car a 9/10 rating on his vlog with the R1R where he laps the car in Ascari Race Resort. In another vlog, where he drives the car from Monaco to Marbella, Spain, he mentioned the car was absolutely incredible, and is best driven if the driver is a person who loves the driving experience, and the drawback being that the car is not for everyone. == References == Category:Praga vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 2015 Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles ",
