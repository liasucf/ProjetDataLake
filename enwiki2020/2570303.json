He arrived at Rangers as a promising young talent, as he had broken into the Chilean national team and was challenging Marcelo Salas and Iv\u00e1n Zamorano for a place in the starting eleven, following a decent scoring record at his club. He made his debut as a substitute in a league match at Motherwell. However injury struck in his second appearance for Rangers versus St Johnstone in the Scottish Cup; he started the game well and scored his first goal for the club, but was then taken off with a knee injury.
