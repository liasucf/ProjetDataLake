    "text": "A pastoral lease, sometimes called a pastoral run, is an arrangement used in both Australia and New Zealand where government-owned Crown land is leased out to graziers for the purpose of livestock grazing on rangelands. ==Australia== Pastoral leases exist in both Australian commonwealth law and state jurisdictions. They do not give all the rights that attach to freehold land: there are usually conditions which include a time period and the type of activity permitted. According to Austrade, such leases cover about 44% of mainland Australia (), mostly in arid and semi-arid regions and the tropical savannahs. They usually allow people to use the land for grazing traditional livestock, but more recently have been also used for non-traditional livestock (such as kangaroos or camels), tourism and other activities. Management of the leases falls mainly to state and territory governments. Under Commonwealth of Australia law, applicable only in the Northern Territory, they are agreements that allow for the use of Crown land by farmers, etc. In the Australian states, leases constitute a land apportionment system created in the mid-19th century to facilitate the orderly division and sale of land to European colonists. Leases within state jurisdictions have variations as to applicability from state to state. Native title can co-exist with pastoral leases, and Indigenous Land Use Agreements may be made between the leaseholder and the affected native title group. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has conducted research on pastoral lands in the terms of the lands as rangelands on a country-wide basis. ===Relevant legislation and management=== Australian jurisdictions have land management legislation that affects the administration of pastoral leases: * New South Wales - Western Lands Act 1901 * Northern Territory - Pastoral Land Act 1992 and Crown Lands Act 1992 * Queensland - Land Act 1994 * South Australia - Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989 and Crown Lands Act 1929 * Western Australia - Land Administration Act 1997 ===Pastoral lease information=== * Northern Territory * Queensland * South Australia * Western Australia - see List of Pastoral leases in Western Australia ==New Zealand== The statutory provisions of pastoral leases are covered by the New Zealand Crown Pastoral Land Act 1998 and the Land Act 1948. The holder of the lease has: * the exclusive right of pasturage * a perpetual right of renewal of the lease for terms of 33 years * no right to the soil, and * no right to acquire the fee simple of any of the land. Pastoral leases are undergoing a voluntary tenure review process. == See also == * Cattle station * Sheep station * List of pastoral leases in Western Australia == References == Category:Australian property law Category:Livestock in Australia Category:Agriculture in New Zealand ",
