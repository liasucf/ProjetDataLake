    "text": "Puxico is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Natalie Hemby, released on January 13, 2017 through her own label, GetWrucke Productions. Hemby started recording the album around the same time she created a documentary about her hometown Puxico in 2010. == Singles == Return was released as the lead single from Puxico on October 21, 2016. == Critical reception == Will Hermes from Rolling Stone stated about the album \"It's a nostalgic LP, musically and thematically, about the value of roots \u2013 surprising, maybe, from a woman behind songs like Lambert's 'Pink Sunglasses' and 'Getaway Driver', which broaden country's palette. But Hemby's a master craftswoman, and in an era of rule-by-Twitter, songs like 'Grand Restoration' and 'Time Honored Tradition' make a case for traditionalism being its own kind of progressivism.\" === Accolades === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
