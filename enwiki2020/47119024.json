It was the beginning of a great entrepreneurial adventure. The Institut M\u00e9rieux was then directed by Dr. Charles M\u00e9rieux and later by Alain M\u00e9rieux and became the leader in the field of human and veterinary vaccines. Until 1994, the M\u00e9rieux family managed several companies in this area before withdrawing from the vaccinology work. At the same time in Chicago, Silliker, a pioneering company in the field of food safety and quality was created in 1967 by Dr. John H. Silliker, a microbiologist known for his work on Salmonella. The M\u00e9rieux Family extended their fields of expertise by addressing Food Safety and Nutrition and acquired Siliker in the 1990s. Silliker started to grow and several laboratories all over the world were acquired by the company which was renamed M\u00e9rieux NutriSciences in 2011. ==Acquisitions== International expansion is one of the cornerstones of M\u00e9rieux NutriSciences' development strategy. This approach is supported by a highly focused acquisition policy. More than 40 acquisitions have been completed since 2007. M\u00e9rieux NutriSciences intends to strengthen its presence in its traditional markets in Europe and the United States, and also pursue its growth in strong emerging countries with significant growth potential.
