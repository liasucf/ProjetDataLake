The conference is attended by procurement managers, procurement specialists, financial managers, medical equipment suppliers, representatives from cities, municipalities and authorities who are responsible for public procurement, and many more. One of the biggest attractions of eBF is the participation of foreign guests from multinationals such as RWE, Google, and Siemens. The conference organisers are rebranding it as a festival of the e-enabling of public and corporate procurement, which means that the programme takes place in five spaces concurrently and includes more than 75 speakers. The conference opens with an exhibition where works of art created by the organisers, speakers, and other participants are exhibited. The conference also features the announcement of the winners of the international Esourcing FSA (Fair Sourcing Awards) competition. Prizes are awarded to representatives of municipalities and companies, and to individuals who have contributed to the development of eAuctions.*Konference eBF aneb ka\u017edoro\u010dn\u00ed rande eAuk\u010dn\u00edch p\u0159\u00edznivc\u016f.
