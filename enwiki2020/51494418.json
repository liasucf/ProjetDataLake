    "text": "Dunderpatrullen is a Swedish electronic music group from \u00d6stersund, J\u00e4mtland. Their music is mostly based in the bitpop sub-genre of chiptune, but has deviated into other territories such as synthwave and EDM. Much of their inspiration comes from classic retro video game composition, often referencing and basing composition off of classic chiptune techniques in a modern context. The band has found success within the gaming enthusiast sphere, playing for events such as DreamHack and N\u00e4rCon, as well as being relatively popular among the gaming crowd. As of 2016, the band is under their own label, after previously being under Beard Monster AB of Warner Music Sweden. They released their first album in 2007, the year after the band was formed, titled for great justice. Three years later in 2010, they would release their second, Analoga Steroider, followed up by Keygeneration in 2014. Since then, they are still producing music, turning to a singles release method before compiling the released songs into their next studio album. The first single of this series was released in 2019 titled Arcadia. == History == === Origin === In 1999, Jim Lindgren started Krull Productions, a name used online for videos created by him and others.
