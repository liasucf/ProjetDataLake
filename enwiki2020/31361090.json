    "text": "Against the World is the third studio album by deathcore band Winds of Plague. It was released on April 19, 2011 through Century Media Records. Against the World features guest appearances from members of Hatebreed, Terror, For Today, Stray From the Path, and retired professional wrestler The Ultimate Warrior (who performs a spoken-word track entitled \"The Warrior Code\"). The album is described in a press release as \"the heaviest-hitting record of the band's already heralded career.\" \"Refined in the Fire\" and \"California\" have been released as singles, and music videos have been released for \"Drop the Match,\" \"California,\" and \"Refined in the Fire,\" breaking the band's prior pattern of having no more than one video released per album. An unreleased song, a cover of The Cranberries song \"Zombie\", was released with the iTunes Store EP for \"California\". Against the World charted at number 60 on the Billboard 200, making it Winds of Plague's highest charting album. ==Track listing== ===FYE Edition bonus disc=== ==Personnel== ;Winds of Plague * Jonathan \"Johnny Plague\" Cooke \u2013 vocals * Nick Eash \u2013 lead guitar * Nick Piunno \u2013 rhythm guitar * Andrew Glover \u2013 bass * Art Cruz \u2013 drums, percussion * Alana Potocnik- keyboard ==References== Category:2011 albums Category:Winds of Plague albums Category:Century Media Records albums Category:Albums with cover art by P\u00e4r Olofsson ",
