    "text": "Morgan Avenue is a station on the BMT Canarsie Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Morgan Avenue and Harrison Place in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it is served by the L train at all times. ==History== Morgan Avenue opened on July 14, 1928, as part of the final leg of the Canarsie Line. This extension connected Montrose Avenue, which had opened four years earlier, to Broadway Junction, which was the western end of the already-operating elevated line to Canarsie. ==Station layout== Tilework This station has two tracks and two side platforms. Both platforms have their original BMT style mosaic trim line and name tablets that are predominantly earth tones of brown, tan, orange with white accents. There are \"M\" tablets for \"Morgan\" on the trim line at regular intervals and name tablets that have \"MORGAN AVE\" in Times New Roman font. There are also directional mosaic signs in the same style as the name tablets. Both platforms have large square columns tiled in white since they are below buildings and not the sidewalk. All of them have name plates reading \"MORGAN AVE\" in black sans serif lettering on a white mosaic background. The mosaic name plates on the columns are unusual to the subway system, since most of the system's station-pillar name plates are merely plaques. ===Exits=== This station has two entrances/exits. * The staffed entrance is at the extreme east (railroad south) end. A long ramp from each platform leads to a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions. A turnstile bank leads to a mezzanine with a token booth and three street stairs going up to all corners of Morgan Avenue and Harrison Place except the northwestern one. This full-time entrance has a station agent booth. One of the stairs features an original BMT design while the other two were renovated later. The entrances serve a mostly industrial area, so they are not heavily used; the one to the northeastern corner was closed in the early 2010s.https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/Subway- Exits-MTA-Closed-Locked-Train-Stairs- Blocked-364549731.htmlhttp://indsecondsystem.weebly.com/morgan-ave.html * The station's other entrance/exit is an unstaffed brick station house on ground level on the west side of Bogart Street on the T-intersection of Harrison Place. There are two exit-only and one High Entry/Exit turnstiles inside and one staircase to each platform at their west (railroad north) ends. This is also a full-time entrance. ==In popular culture== This station appeared in MF Doom's music video of his 1999 single I Hear Voices as well as the New York City-set scenes of the video game Rock Band. ==References== ==External links== * * Station Reporter \u2014 * The Subway Nut \u2014 Morgan Avenue Pictures * Morgan Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View * Bogart Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View (2015) * Platforms from Google Maps Street View (2018) Category:BMT Canarsie Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1928 Category:1928 establishments in New York (state) Category:Williamsburg, Brooklyn ",
