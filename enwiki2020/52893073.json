    "text": "Elizabeth Peterson \"Lisa\" Bender (born May 11, 1978) is an American politician and city planner serving as a member of the Minneapolis City Council from the 10th Ward. In 2018, she was unanimously elected president of the Minneapolis City Council. ==Early life and education== Born in Shoreview, Minnesota, Bender attended Irondale High School and earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota in Spanish and Biology. She received her master's degree in City and Regional Planning from University of California, Berkeley in 2007. == Career == In 2001, she moved to New York City and worked as the Communications Director for the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, traveling across the world advocating for biking, walking, and non- motorized transportation. Bender worked for the City of San Francisco as a city planner before returning to Minnesota in 2009 where she worked for Hennepin County before moving to the Minnesota Department of Transportation to manage Minnesota's Safe Routes to School program. She co-founded the Minneapolis Bicycle Coalition, an advocacy organization working to make riding a bike safer and driving a car more difficult in Minneapolis. In 2012, Bender decided to challenge incumbent Meg Tuthill for the DFL endorsement for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council representing the city's 10th Ward. After six ballots and five hours, she secured the party's endorsement over Tuthill and two other challengers. She defeated Tuthill in the general election on November 5, 2013 with 62.4% of the vote. ===Minneapolis City Council=== Bender was sworn into office on January 6, 2014. She was named chair of the city's Zoning and Planning Committee, one of only two first-term council members to chair a standing committee of the council. Jamar Clark. During her first term, Bender has focused on creating a safe transportation system for pedestrians, expanding affordable housing choices, fighting for workers protections and higher wages, supporting community and environmental health, and defunding the Minneapolis Police Department (while hiring private security for herself, funded by taxpayers). She authored the city's complete streets ordinance, protected bikeway update to the Bicycle Master Plan, accessory dwelling unit ordinance and landmark paid sick leave ordinance, establishing Minneapolis as the first city in the Midwest guaranteeing workers the ability to accrue up to 48 hours of sick and safe time each year. In 2015, she authored an ordinance eliminating or reducing the minimum parking requirement for new residential developments along high-frequency transit routes. The Obama Administration highlighted Bender's parking reform ordinance in its 2016 Housing Development Toolkit as a successful initiative to lessen housing costs, reduce pollution, traffic congestion, and improve economic development. In addition to serving as the chair of the Zoning and Planning Committee during her first term, Bender sat on the Committee of the Whole, the Elections and Rules Committee, the Health, Environment, and Community Engagement Committee, the Taxes Committee, the Transportation and Public Works Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. She was named L'Etoile Magazine's MVP of the year in 2015. In 2016, she was named one of Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal's People to Watch. On April 22, 2017, Bender was endorsed by the DFL for a second term. Bender won her re-election campaign on November 7, 2017, making her the first incumbent in over 20 years to do so in the ward.http://www.southwestjournal.com/news/2017/11/frey-leads-on-election- night/ Following the 2017 elections, Bender was unanimously elected by her colleagues as the new President of the Minneapolis City Council. While serving as President of the Minneapolis City Council, Bender also sits as the vice- chair of the Transportation and Public Works Committee, the Elections and Rules Committee, and the Executive Committee. Bender is also a member of the Zoning and Planning Committee, the Budget Committee, the Housing Policy and Development Committee, the Committee of the Whole, and the Intergovernmental Relations Committee. After the city sent warnings to homeowners about a crackdown on shoveling enforcement, Bender accused the Star Tribune of sexism when their reporter found she was the only City Council member who had complaints against her (seven were recorded) and a fine ($149) for un-shoveled walks. The city had sent and paid a shoveler to clear her sidewalks. In June 2020, in response to the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests, Bender voted with most of the rest of the city council to begin the process of defunding and abolishing the Minneapolis Police Department. This position is controversial, including within the Minneapolis Black community. While Bender and 7 of the other 12 Council members are white, Steven Belton, the Black CEO and President of the Urban League Twin Cities, was quoted in the Star Tribune complaining about a \"significant, dramatic uptick\" in violent crime since the Council vote. Belton called the move irresponsible, and while he supports transforming the police department, he accused council members of failing to consult with the Black community, particularly those on the North Side. Bender also received criticism for an on-air interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota in which Bender called for \"a future without police.\" Camerota then asked: \"What if in the middle of night, my home is broken into? Who do I call?\" Bender replied: \"Yes, I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know -- and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege. Because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality where calling the police may mean more harm is done.\" ==Personal life== Lisa Bender at a campaign event in 2013 Bender lives with her husband Ryan and their two daughters in the Lowry Hill East neighborhood of Minneapolis and is a parent volunteer in the Minneapolis Public Schools. Bender is a year-round bicycle commuter. In 2010, Bender was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer 11 weeks into her first pregnancy. She has since recovered. Three weeks before election day, Bender gave birth to her second daughter in October 2013. In the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Bender was the only elected official in Minneapolis to endorse the Bernie Sanders campaign. She served as the campaign's surrogate before the local media on caucus night when Sanders won Minnesota and was elected to be a delegate at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Bender later supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. ==Electoral history== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" ! colspan=\"5\" | Minneapolis City Council Ward 10 election, 2013 |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Political party/principle !
