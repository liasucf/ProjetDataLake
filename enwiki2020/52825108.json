    "text": "Nathan ben Abraham, known also by the epithet President of the Academy () in the Land of Israel (died ca. 1045 \u2013 1051), was an 11th-century rabbi and exegete of the Mishnah who lived in Ramla, in the Jund Filastin district of the Fatimid Caliphate. He was the author of the first known commentary covering the entire Mishnah. ==Biography== A critical analysis of the time- frame in which the author of the Judeo-Arabic Mishnah commentary lived places him in the early 11th century. Assaf suggests that he was Rabbi Nathan the second, the son of Rabbi Abraham who was called the Pious, a contemporary of Rabbi Abiathar, who served in the geonate of the Land of Israel in 1095 CE.Assaf, S. (1933\u20131934), p. 383; Encyclopaedia Judaica (3rd edition), vol. 12, Jerusalem 1974, s.v. Nathan Ben Abraham II; Pirushei ha-Rishonim (Tamid - part 1), Benei Barak 2001 This view has been rejected by more recent scholars, such as Gil (1983), Friedman (1990), Danzig (1998), Amar (2011) and Fox (1994), who put him two generations earlier. In around 1011, Nathan travelled to Qayrawan, to attend to his family inheritance, and while there he studied under the illustrious Rabbi Hushiel ben Elhanan, one of the greatest Jewish scholars of the time.Friedman, M. (1990a), p. 44 [16], note 37 During this time he would travel to Fustat (Old Cairo), in Egypt, where he had certain business engagements, and where it was that he'd meet his future wife, the daughter of Mevorakh ben Eli, a wealthy citizen of Fustat. Nearing the age of forty, he returned to his native Palestine and, after settling in Ramleh where he vied with a certain gaon Solomon ben Judah of Jerusalem between the years 1038 and 1051 over the position of gaon, he was eventually appointed the Av Beit Din (President of the court) in Palestine, a position only second to that of the gaon,Gil, Moshe (1983), pp. 582\u2013583, 604. and which post he held until his death.Stillman, N.A. (2010), pp. 558\u2013559 During his years of public service, Rabbi Nathan had garnered the support and backing of Diaspora communities, although Solomon ben Judah had secured the backing of the local community, as well as the Fatimid governor of Ramleh.Encyclopaedia Judaica (3rd edition), vol. 12, Jerusalem 1974, p. 858 (s.v. Nathan ben Abraham I). In Palestine, he compiled a commentary on the Mishnah, which commentary enjoyed widespread circulation in the Jewish world in the late 12th and early 13th centuries.Friedman, M. (1990a), p. 43 [15], note 37 ==Commentary== Rabbi Nathan's work is one of the first known commentaries of the Mishnah, ranking with that of Rabbi Hai Gaon's commentary on Seder Taharot in the Mishnah (and is the oldest existing commentary encompassing the entire Six Orders of the Mishnah).Amar, Z. & Kapah, E. (2011b), p. 11 Scholars have ascribed this commentary a unique significance, saying that by virtue of its composition in the Land of Israel, its interpretations are believed to embody an unbroken Palestinian-Jewish tradition on the meanings of difficult words. The treatise also sheds light on the diachrony of Hebrew words. The entire work was rendered into a Hebrew translation by Rabbi Yosef Qafih, with an abridged first edition being published between the years 1955 and 1958, and the second edition in 1965. Even so, the work has not seen widespread circulation.Besides the Harry Fischel Institute that has reprinted sections of the invaluable work, namely, the entire Mishnaic Order known as Zera'im (Seeds), the commentary is relatively unknown among the Yeshivas. ===Anonymous copyist=== Nathan's original Judeo-Arabic commentary of the Mishnah served as the basis for a later recension made by a 12th-century anonymous author and copyist,Schlossberg, E. (2005), p. 281Assaf, Simcha (Kiryat Sefer 1933) presumes that the copyist and redactor lived between the years 1105 CE and 1170 CE, based on the fact that the last of the exegetes mentioned by the copyist is Rabbi Isaac Alfasi (1013\u20131103), while not mentioning at all in his work the explanations given by Maimonides (born 1135), who also compiled a Judeo-Arabic commentary on the Mishnah (see: Nathan ben Abraham (1955), vol. 1, Preface written by Mordecai Yehudah Leib Sachs, appended at the end of the book). believed to be of Yemenite Jewish provenance.Such is the opinion of Rabbi Yosef Qafih and others, based on the author's choice of Arabic words and which tend to show a dialect of Arabic used in Yemen, as well as the manuscript's place of discovery, viz. Yemen. However, this conclusion is not agreed upon by all, since many of the words brought down by Qafih to prove this point and which, according to him, are of a \"pure\" Yemeni dialect, are also Arabic words used in Iraq. Simcha Assaf, however, has presumed that the copyist was originally from Egypt.Qafih, Y. (2018), pp. 28\u201329 It is doubtful that his work would have survived, had it not been for the faithful copyist, whose innovation was to interweave in the existing text the divergent views held by several geonim and the explanations given by them for words and passages in the Mishnah. The author's introduction reads: \"I found the commentaries of Rabbi Nathan, the President of the Academy, [which he made] for explicating the different language usages in the Mishnah, and I have seen fit to add thereto others besides, drawn from the commentaries of Israel's sages.\"Nathan ben Abraham (1955), vol. 1, p. 13 [7a] (end of introduction), appended at the end of the book. The anonymous copyist is said to have lived between 1105 \u2013 1170 CE, making him a contemporary with Rabbi Isaac Alfasi and Nathan ben Jehiel of Rome, the author of Sefer Arukh.Assaf, S. (1933\u20131934), pp. 383\u2013384 He is the first to introduce the work as being a commentary of the Mishnah, written by \"Rabbeinu Nathan, Av ha-Yeshiva\" (the President of the Academy), whom he calls \"the son of Abraham ha-\u1e24as\u012bd\" (Abraham the Pious). This last epithet is believed to have been an error by the copyist, who mistook its true author, Nathan ben Abraham (of the 11th century), with Nathan ben Abraham II, the grandson of the former.Such is the conclusion reached by a host of scholars, as mentioned by Zohar Amar (2011). He then proceeds to bring down a long introduction wherein he spans the history of the written and oral Laws, writing in Judeo-Arabic and commencing with the words, q\u0101l \u011f\u0101mi\u02bfuh (= \"So said the gatherer [of the sayings of the fathers],\" etc.), covering the Torah's reception at Sinai and how it was transmitted down throughout successive generations, naming some thirteen generations from the time of Israel's return from the Babylonian exile to the time of Rabbi Judah HaNasi who compiled the Mishnah in 189 CE. In all this, he never once mentions his own name, but chooses to remain anonymous. He also explains some of the terminology used in the Talmud, such as when a saying is meant to be understood as an external teaching (Baraitta) outside of the Mishnah, and when it is to be understood as a teaching strictly derived from the Mishnah compiled by Rabbi Judah HaNasi. He then mentions the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud under Rav Ashi as occurring in the year 841 of Seleucid era (corresponding with 530 CE), and names the great exegetes that followed this period, namely: the author of Halakhot \u1e32etu'ot and Halakhot Pesu\u1e33ot, Rabbi Yehudai Gaon; the author of Halakhot Gedolot, Rabbi Shimon Kiara; the author of the Beramot (a term applied to the book She\u00ebltot of Rav A\u1e25ai, the Gaon of Shab\u1e25a); Rabbi Hai Gaon; Rabbi Isaac ibn Ghiyyat of Lucena; Rabbi Nissim, the author of Sefer ha-Maftea\u1e25, Rabbi Samuel ben \u1e24ofni, Rabbi Hananel, and Rabbi Isaac Alfasi. A certain book entitled Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24\u0101w\u012b (\"the Compendium\") is cited four times, composed by a certain R. David b. Saadiah.Assaf, S. (1955), pp. 319\u2013322 (= Kiryat Sefer, X [1934], 542\u2013545); Friedman, Mordechai A. (1990a), p. 41 [13]\u201342 [14]. Simcha Assaf and Mordechai A. Friedman are in dispute over whether it was Rabbi Nathan or his Yemenite copyist who quotes from R. David. Three of the author's more extensive commentaries exist for the tractates Berakhot, Shevu'ot and Avot. Since the anonymous copyist makes use of other sources in the original work bequeathed by Rabbi Nathan, it is not uncommon for him to give one explanation for a word in one tractate, but in a different tractate give a different explanation for the same word. The anonymous copyist deviated from the set order of the Mishnah, bringing down the order as follows: (Seder Zera'im) Berakhot, (Seder Mo'ed) 'Eruvin, Pesahim, Sheqalim, Kippurim, Sukkah, Betzah, Rosh Ha-Shannah, Ta'anith, Megillah, Hagiggah, Mo'ed Qatan, etc. An early reference to Nathan ben Abraham's Mishnah commentary is brought down by Rabbi Moses ben Nahman (1194\u20131270), who cites the commentary in his own Talmudic commentary,vide Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashannah 10a saying: \"Likewise, I found written in the glosses of old copies of the Mishnah composed in the Land of Israel where they explained the meaning of sipp\u016bq (Heb. \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e7) as having the connotation of ad\u0101, in the Arabic tongue, [meaning], he that grafts a tree upon a tree.\" The reference here is to Nathan's commentary in Tractate Orlah (1:5). ===Methods of exegesis=== Rabbi Nathan's method of elucidation is mostly similar to that of Maimonides' Mishnah commentary - the two often complementing each other, but differing in several key areas. A comparative study gives readers a glimpse into words that carried different connotations in that period, with occasional words whose identification can have a significant halachic bearing, depending on how they are explained.See: Amar, Z. & Kapah, E. (2011b), p. 13 (note 24), who brings down the classic example of one of the five grains, shibbolet shu'al (Heb. \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc), mentioned in Mishnah Pesahim 2:5 and in Mishnah Menahot 10:7, whose leaven is prohibited during Passover. While the Talmudic exegete, Rashi, holds this to be oats, and Maimonides holds it to be a type of \"wild barley,\" Nathan ben Abraham (1955) called it by its Arabic name sunbulat al-tha'alib (Fox's spike). Another one of the five grains whose leaven is prohibited at Passover is the shiffon (Heb. \u05e9\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05df), which Nathan ben Abraham (1955) explains in Mishnah Menahot 10:7 as meaning al-s\u0101feh (Judeo- Arabic: \u05d0\u05dc\u05e1\u05d0\u05e4\u05d4) and which word, according to Amar, is synonymous with the Arabic word dowsir (Ar. \u062f\u0648\u0633\u0631) - i.e. either one of the cultivated oats (Avena sativa) or Ovate goatgrass (Aegilops geniculata). It is to be noted that Rashi, in his commentary on the Babylonian Talmud (Pesahim 35a), thought that the Hebrew word shiffon meant \u05e9\u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\"\u05d0 (= seigle), or what is actually rye (Secale cereale), a grain crop that is not endemic to Israel. There are above one-hundred entries of plants mentioned in the Mishnah that have been identified by Rabbi Nathan. In some entries, two different explanations are given for one word, the one perhaps under the authority of another rabbinic sage. {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Comparative study of Mishnaic words |- ! style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Mishnah ! style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Hebrew Word !

See Rabbi Yosef Qafih's comment on this matter in Maimonides (1963\u20131967), vol. 1, s.v. Kila'im 1:4, note 34.Schlossberg, Eliezer (1993), p. 148, brings down the words of Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek of Siponto (c. 1090\u20131160), one of the earliest commentators on the Mishnah (only Seder Zera'im survives), who wrote: \"\u2019I\u011f\u00fbs [Pear], the Arabic word is written with a \u1e63\u00e2d (\u05e5) at the end, but when people ceased to distinguish between the stressed consonant (\u05e6) and the vowel shuraq that is sounded-out before the semakh (\u05e1), it has caused the interchanging of these consonantal sounds one with the other.\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05d0\u05d2'\u05d0\u05e5 \u201cal-a\u011f\u0101\u1e63 are commonly known among us under the name al-barq\u016bq\u201d Plum (Prunus domestica)In the above diachronic analysis, Maimonides informs his readers that, in the Maghreb, the name of this fruit tree had changed in meaning over the years. In the Maghreb, \u05d0\u05d2\u05e1 was understood as meaning Plum (Prunus domestica). This view, however, stands in direct contradiction to an old midrashic work, Alpha Beta la-Ben Sira, where it lists thirty or so trees that were planted by the First Man in Babylonia; ten of which fruits are eaten whole, ten of which are eaten only in their outer fleshy part (mesocarp), but whose inner kernels (endocarp) are discarded, and ten of which fruits are eaten only in their inner, fleshy parts, but whose outer husks are discarded. There, it states explicitly that the \u05d0\u05d2\u05e1 was among the fruit eaten whole; hence: \"pear\" as explained by most commentators. Had the \u05d0\u05d2\u05e1 been a plum, as Maimonides alleges, it would have been named in the midrashic work in a different category. | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\"\u05d0 Pear (Pyrus syriaca) (Arabic: \u05d0\u05d2\u05e5) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 (Arabic: kummathra)Hai Gaon (1924), Mishnah Uktzin 1:6 Pear (Pyrus communis) |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text- align:center; width:65px\"|Uktzin 2:2 | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text- align:center; width:65px\"|\u05d0\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u05d0\u05dc\u05e6\u05e2\u05ea\u05e8 Marjoram (Majorana syriaca)Kapah, E.

Amar (ibid.) thinks that the original Judeo-Arabic word may have been related, etymologically, to the Iris plant: sisan (= iris) + bar (= wild). In any rate, according to Amar, Maimonides held the \"erus\" to be a type of \"wide-leaved mint,\" rather than the iris plant itself, since the upper stem of the \"erus\" plant exists in both winter and summer, unlike the iris that exists for the most part only in winter. According to Amar, the Arabic word sayasnabir was used in the Middle-Ages to describe various plants of the family Lamiaceae. In some Arabic dictionaries, the name is applied to wild bergamot mint (Mentha aquatica var. citrata). | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e1\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05de\u05d1\u05e8\"\u05d5 (susimbro)Rabbi Solomon Sirilio, in his commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 5:7[8]), explains: \u201cErusa.

Smith, William (1872), p. 899, who writes on the sisymbrium (\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd): \"...there can be no doubt that it was a species of mint, probably the Mentha sylvestris, as Anguillara contends.

The Vatican MS. of a late 13th-century, early 14th-century copy of the Jerusalem Talmud (Vat. ebr. 133) [folio 88v], however, writes in the margin for the same word \u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d4.

While the Mishnah in Kila'im 1:4 mentions grafting a cultivar of pear known as \"krustemelo\" with the native pear, it says nothing about the allowance of other pear cultivars. The Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 1:4) questions what would happen if the scion of a different cultivar of pear were grafted onto the native pear. The question was answered by bringing down a case where the people in the vicinity of Arieh were grafting a scion of apples onto a cultivar of pear known as \"\u1e25uzrad,\" and when they were confronted by a certain disciple who said that they were not permitted to do so, they immediately cut down the tree. Upon inquiry, they learnt that they did right in cutting down the tree, since their grafting was done with diverse kinds, in direct violation of the Torah. However, to take the scion of the tree \"\u1e25uzrad,\" and to graft it onto the rootstock of a native pear (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d2\u05e1), it is permissible and does not come under the biblical prohibition of diverse kinds. | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05e2\u05d9\u05d6\u05e8\u05d0\u05df Medlar (Mespilus germanica) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05e8 \u201ca kind of apple\u201dSefer Arukh, s.v. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05e8, British Library (Add MS 26881). | style=\"text-align:center;\"| --- |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Kila'im 1:2Also in Mishnah Pesahim 2:6; Uktzin 1:2, et. al | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"| sing. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea pl. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u05d0\u05dc\u05db'\u05e1 Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05db'\u05e1 Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05e7\"\u05d0 Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05db'\u05e1 Lettuce (Lactuca sativa)Hai Gaon (1924), s.v.

Maimonides explains yarb\u016bz\u012bn as meaning a type of wild Goosefoot (Blitum virgatum and Chenopodium murale), to be distinguished from the cultivated variety, Amaranthus blitum var. silvestre. Sefer Arukh and Moses Margolies, in his commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 9:1; Ma'aserot 5:3), have explained the yarb\u016bz\u012bn to mean \"wild asparagus\" (Asparagus aphyllus). | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text- align:center; width:65px\"|\u05d9\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05d6\u05d9\u05df | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05d2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05d6 Pigweed (Amaranthus blitum var. silvestre)Amar, Z.

(2007), p. 74. The Hebrew word used here is a Greek loanword, \u05de\u05dc\u05e4\u05e4\u05d5\u05df (melephephon). The Jerusalem Talmud (Kilayim 1:2) relates an ancient belief that if one were to take a seed from a watermelon and a seed from an apple, and then place them together in an impression made in the earth, the two seeds would fuse together and become diverse kinds. \"It is for this reason,\" says the narrator of the Talmud, \"that they call it (i.e. the fruit) by its Greek name, melephephon. The old Greek word for \"melon\" was actually \u03bc\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf = m\u00ealo(n) apple + \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd = p\u00e9p\u014dn melon, meaning literally \"apple-shaped melon\" (see: Random House Webster's College Dictionary, s.v. melon). This fruit, muskmelon (Cucumis melo), was thought to be a cross-breed between a watermelon and an apple. Maimonides, however, calls \"melephephon\" in Mishnah Kilayim 1:2 and Terumah 8:6 by the Arabic name, al-khiyyar, meaning \"cucumbers\" (Cucumis sativus) \u2013 far from being anything related to apples and watermelons. Nevertheless, today, in Modern Hebrew, the word melephephon is now used to denote \"cucumbers,\" based on Maimonides' identification. | style=\"text- align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05db'\u05d9\u05d0\u05e8 Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05de\u05dc\u05e4\u05e4\u05d5\u05df (melopeppon)Talmudic exegete, Solomon Sirilio (1485\u20131554), mentions in his commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 1:2) that Maimonides explained melephephon to mean in Spanish pepinos = cucumber (Cucumis sativus), which, in the opinion of an early Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi Isaac of Siponto (c. 1090\u20131160), was really to be identified as \u201csmall, round melons\u201d (Cucumis melo), since Rabbi Yehudah in our Mishnah holds that it is a diverse kind in relation to kish\u016bt (a type of cucumber). Moreover, had the melephephon simply been a subspecies of kish\u016bt, explained by Maimonides as having the meaning of al-fakous (Egyptian cucumber = Cucumis melo var. chate), they would not have been considered diverse kinds with respect to each other, similar to a black ox and a white ox that plough together are not considered diverse kinds. | style=\"text-align:center;\"| --- |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Kila'im 1:3 | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"|\u05e0\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u05d0\u05dc\u05d2\u05d6\u05e8 Carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus)Although Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham identifies nefos as being al-jazar (Arabic for carrot / parsnip), he may have actually been referring here to Brassica napus, which vegetable has roots similar to those of carrots (See next two entries under Maimonides and Sefer Arukh). | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e4\u05d2'\u05dc \u05e9\u05d0\u05de\u05d9 \u201cSyrian radish\u201d Rape (Brassica napus)Although the vegetable known as nefos was called by Maimonides by its idiom, \"Syrian radish,\" it was actually not a radish at all, since it is listed in Mishnah Kilaim 1:5 as being a diverse-kind (kila'im) in relation to the true radish (Heb. \u05e6\u05e0\u05d5\u05df). Zohar Amar suggests that it may have actually been Brassica napus (see Amar, Z. (2015), p. 113). One is to bear in mind that Brassica napus has roots resembling those of carrots, for which reason medieval Hebraists and philologists would have classified the vegetable as a carrot. It is to be noted, furthermore, that in foliage, Brassica napus and turnip (Brassica rapa) have similar leaves, for which reason they are not considered diverse-kinds with respect to each other. | style=\"text- align:center;\"| \u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7\"\u05d9 Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) \u05e4\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05e7\"\u05d9 Parsnip (Pastinaca) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \"hem\u0101 in the language employed by the rabbis; these are elongated\"Thus, he explained, in Mishnah Uktzin 1:2. |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Shevi'it 7:1 | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"|\u05e0\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e0\u05d5\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05de\u05d7\u05dc\u05d1 Blossom of the St. Lucie cherry (Prunus mahaleb) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05e1 Parsley (Petroselinum crispum var. tuberosum) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \"white flowers; a weed from which exudes latex when cut\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d7\u05e8\u05e9\u05e3 Thistle (Silybum marianum); artichoke (Cynara scolymus)So explained in Mishnah Uktzin 3:2 |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Avodah Zarah 1:5 | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text- align:center; width:65px\"| \u05e0\u05e7\u05dc\u05d9\u05d1\u05e1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d2\u05d5\u05d0\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9\u05df millet (Panicum miliaceum)Amar, Z. & Kapah, E.

Moreover, peragin are mentioned alongside of rice, millet and sesame, and that all of them are plants that grow in the summer months, which would rule out peragin as being poppy seeds (Papaver somniferum) since the genus known as Papaver grow in the winter months. Moreover, he notes that in the Syriac language, the word peraga = \u0726\u072a\u0713\u0710 means \"a type of millet\" (cf. Payne-Smith, Syriac Lexicon, p. 457), and since the growing season for peragin in the Genizah manuscript is given at six-months, it would eliminate ordinary millet (Panicum miliaceum) and Setaria italica whose growing seasons are merely at two months. Sorghum vulgare does, however, have a growing season of six months. \u05d0\u05dc\u05db'\u05e9\u05db'\u05d0\u05e1 Poppy seeds (P. somniferum) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u05d0\u05dc\u05db'\u05e9\u05db'\u05d0\u05e9 Poppy seeds (Papaver somniferum) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e4\u05e4\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\"\u05d5 Poppy seeds (Papaver somniferum) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| --- |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Kila'im 1:4Also in Mishnah Ma'aserot 1:3; Uktzin 1:6. | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05df | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u05d0\u05dc\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2'\u05dc Quince (Cydonia oblonga) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05d0\u05dc\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2'\u05dc Quince (Cydonia oblonga) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e6\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc Quince (Cydonia oblonga)Sefer Arukh, s.v. \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e9, British Library (Add MS 26881). | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc Quince (Cydonia oblonga) |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text- align:center; width:65px\"|Shabbat 2:1 | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text- align:center; width:65px\"|\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05d3\u05dfVariant spelling, \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05d3\u05df. | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u201cthat which resembles wool between the wood and bark of the willow, but others say it is the Sodom apple (Calotropis procera)\u201d (i.e. bast wick) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u201ca woollen [fibre] that appears in one of the herbal species\u201d | style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u05e2\u05de\u05e8\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d0 \u05d3\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4 (Wool-like bast of the willow tree)Sefer Arukh, s.v. \u05e2\u05de\u05e8, British Library (Add MS 26881). | style=\"text-align:center;\"| --- |- | style=\"background:Navajowhite; color:blue; text-align:center; width:65px\"|Shabbat 2:1 | style=\"background:Navajowhite; text-align:center; width:65px\"|\u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8Literally: \"desert wick,\" and which is explained in the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 20b) as having the meaning in Aramaic of \u05e9\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 (Aramaic: shavra), and which word has been explained in J.

Since the Mishnah mentions \u05d0\u05d2\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd and \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05df as not being heterogeneous to each other, and since \u05d0\u05d2\u05e1 is largely recognized as being a pear, it follows that \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05df must also be a kind of pear, hence: \u05db\u05de\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 = \"wild Syrian pear.\" This view is supported by the Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 1:4), where it cites Tosefta Kila'im 1:4, saying that, in the marketplace of Sepphoris, they had grafted \"krustemelo\" onto a native pear, but when told by a certain disciple that it was wrong to do so, they immediately cut down the tree. Upon inquiry of the matter at Yavne, they learnt that it was not necessary to cut it down, since \"krustemelo\" was accounted as another kind of pear. Solomon Sirilio, in Jerusalem Talmud (Ma'aserot 1:3 and Kila'im 1:4) explains the same episode by saying that \"krustemelo\" was a cultivar of \"apple\" made by grafting the scion of a wild variety of \"apple\" that had no belly onto the rootstock of a native apple whose fruit was round-bellied. Its name, he said, is of Greek origin, having the connotation of \u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf + \u03bc\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf = \"town-apple.\" In any rate, based on the parent-text in the Tosefta, it is evident that one is permitted to take the scion of a hybrid \"krustemelo\", in this case a pear cultivar, and graft it onto the rootstock of a native pear. Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham, speaking of \"krustemelo\" (Heb. \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05df), says that this fruit tree was called in the Land of Israel by the name al-fa\u1e6d\u016bm\u012b. Ishtori Haparchi (1999:263), citing an old Judeo-Arabic commentary on the fruits mentioned in Mishnah Kila'im, chapter 1, says of the \"krustemelo\" (Heb. \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05df) that it is a \"pear\" and that it also bears the colloquial name al- far\u1e6dem\u012b, and that it is only to be found in the land of Canaan, rather than in Babylonia.According Ben Melchizedek, Isaac (1975), p. 79, the fruit which is here intended is Pere calaprice, also known as \"mandolin pear\". Schlossberg, Eliezer (1993), pp. 150\u2013151, commenting on this early commentary of the Mishnah written by Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek of Siponto (c. 1090\u20131160), wrote that \"krustemelo\" was \"an exquisite type of pear which was customary to graft onto a local pear.\" \u05d0\u05dc\u05d1\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05e7 Apricot (Prunus armeniaca)Kapah, E.

The explanation of al-barq\u016bq here follows the use of this word in Yemen, where it had the connotation of \"apricot.\" See Rabbi Yosef Qafih's commentary in Maimonides (1963\u20131967), vol. 1, Kila'im 1:4, note 34.

The Arabic word shaylam (Ar. \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0645) is often used to refer to darnel (Lolium temulentum), but it is thought to have been a generic word for tares or weeds. See: Amar, Z. (2011a), p. 56. The Jerusalem Talmud (Pesahim 2:5 [18a]) calls the \u05ea\u05de\u05db\u05d4 by the name \u05d2\u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05df (Gingidium), which, according to Dioscorides (Book II-167) - as explained by late horticulturalists - is said to be a kind of chervil, and can apply to any of the following genera: Chaerophyllum, Anthriscus, Chaetosciadium and Scandix. Of these, the most commonly grown chervil in Israel is Chaetosciadium trichospermum. Ibn al-Baitar (1989), p. 189, citing Galen, explains Gingidium as rather meaning a species of wild carrot (e.g. Daucus gingidium, or something similar), and rejected the opinion of A\u1e63\u1e6difan ben Basil who said that the word Gingidium meant Shah atarj (\"the king's herb\"), in Arabic, or what is known as fumitory (Fumaria officinalis). In any rate, chervil and wild carrots are both umbels (Umbelliferae) and bear similar foliage, which may have added to the confusion. A sixth-century drawing of the Gingidium in Dioscorides' De Materia Medica (the Juliana Anicia Codex of 512), now in the Austrian National Library in Vienna, shows what appears to be the wild carrot (Daucus gingidium), also known as the Cretan carrot. Pliny the Elder (1951), book XX, ch. XVI, wrote: \"In Syria very great pains are taken over kitchen- gardens; hence the Greek proverb: 'Syrians have plenty of vegetables.' They sow a vegetable called by some gingidion that is very like staphylinus (=parsnip; carrot), only it is slighter and more bitter, though its properties are the same.

Amar notes that, according to Maimonides' description, he may have been referring to the regular headed cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), and that it is only called \"wild cabbage\" insofar as the cultivar was less favorable than the leafy variety, especially kale (Ar. karnub).

Shevi'it, ch. 7, p. 26a [51] ===Modern Hebrew usages=== In Modern Hebrew nomenclature, some of the plant identifications have changed since medieval times. For example, the Modern Hebrew word for cucumber is melafefon (a word formerly used for \"melon\"). The word kish\u016b\u2019\u012bm (formerly \"cucumbers\") is now applied to zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo var. cylindrica), a plant native to the New World. In modern colloquial Hebrew, the word \u1e25azeret (formerly \"lettuce\") is now used to denote horseradish (Armoracia rusticana). Kark\u016bm, formerly used in Hebrew to denote only saffron, is now used also for turmeric. L\u016bf (formerly Arum palaestinum) is now used in modern colloquial Hebrew to denote the broadleaf wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum). Modern botanists in Israel now call Clover (Trifolium) by the name tiltan, which word formerly meant \"fenugreek\" (Trigonella foenum-graecum).The first to propose that tiltan may be clover (Trifolium) seems to have been Ephraim Rubinovich (Plant Names of Ere\u1e93 Israel \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05e6\u05de\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc, Jerusalem 1917, p. 20), who presumably based his identification on the Hebrew root, tiltan = \"consisting of three\" and which was believed by him to be the three-leaf clover, albeit, with disregard to the early rabbinic tradition on the plant's identification. Modern Hebrew now calls cork (Quercus suber) by the name \"sha'am,\" although in Rabbi Nathan's day it had the meaning of \"bamboo.\" Af\u016bnna (der. of af\u016bnnin) is now used in Modern Hebrew as a generic word for all kinds of garden peas, when formerly it was used strictly for chickpeas (Cicer arietinum).Nathan ben Abraham (1955), s.v. Mishnah Shabbat 21:3. See also Amar, Z. (2015), pp. 47\u201348; Sefer Arukh, s.v. \u05d0\u05e4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05df; Isaac ben Melchizedek, s.v. Peah 3:3; Maimonides (1963), s.v. Peah 3:3 and Shabbat 21:3, who writes that the word means garbanzo beans (Cicer arietinum), and who uses the Judeo-Arabic word \u05d0\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05e5 (garbanzo beans) for this plant. Cauliflower is now called kr\u016bv\u012bt in Modern Hebrew, but which formerly was known as ther\u016b\u1e07tor. In many cases, Arabic names are used to identify plants. Most Hebrew speakers will call the frothy relish made from fenugreek by its Arabic name, \u1e25ilbah. So, too, the biblical hyssop, eizo\u1e07, is now popularly called by its Arabic name, zaatar.Based on the Judeo-Arabic translation of the word in the works of Rabbi Saadia Gaon (in his Tafsir, a translation of the Pentateuch, Exo. 12:22); Al-Fasi, D. (1936), vol. 1, s.v. \u05d0\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1; Ibn \u01e6an\u0101\u1e25, Yonah (1896), s.v. \u05d0\u05d6\u05d1 - aleph, zayn, bet; Maimonides (1967), s.v. Nega'im 14:6; and Nathan ben Abraham (1955) in Mishnah Uktzin 2:2. The problems with identification arise from Jewish oral tradition where it expressly prohibits Greek hyssop, and where the biblical plant is said to have been identical to the Arabic word, zaatar (Origanum syriacum), and which word is not to be associated with other ezobs that often bear an additional epithet, such as zaatar farsi = Persian- hyssop (Thymbra capitata) and zaatar rumi = Roman-hyssop (Satureja thymbra). See: The Mishnah (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. Negai'im 14:6 (p. 696); Parah 11:7 (p. 711). The Arabic word sab\u014dn which is now used for soap (borit) is related to the Aramaic word \u1e63ap\u0304ona = \u0728\u0726\u0718\u0722\u0710 (soap). In other cases, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda invented new words, such as \u1e25atzil\u012bm (egg-plants; aubergines), to take the place of Hebrew words long forgotten, but what Nathan ben Abraham understood as being called q\u012bnras. ===Difficult words=== Some referents of Hebrew words have become so entrenched in rabbinic disputes that it is now difficult to ascertain what their original meanings may have been, such as the adjective qam\u016br (Hebrew: \u05e7\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 / \u05e7\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4), in Mishnah Ohalot 3:7, op. cit. 5:1 and Eruvin 8:10. Rabbi Nathan (Ohalot) explains the word as meaning \"plastered,\" (such as with gypsum and which repels water), but Maimonides explained the same word as meaning \"dome- shaped.\" For one, the mouth of an earthenware oven which projected outside the house would be protected from the elements by virtue of its dome-like structure, while, for the other, because of its plastering. R. Hai Gaon explained it differently, saying that qam\u016br was an opening [of the oven or drain pipe] built at its base near to the ground so that the influx of air will cause the fire to burn well, in the case of the oven, or allow for a drainage pipe to air out.Likewise, the word aspethei (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b7\u05e1\u05b0\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b5\u05d9) in Mishnah Ohalot 13:4, is another disputed term. According to R. Isaac of Siponto and R. Shimshon of Sens, the word was used for a weaver's stave; derived from the Greek word \u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7, and being no more than the sword-like batten (beater) used in the weaver's loom for packing of the weft yarn (filling yarn). Since the batten in many cultures is a flat board of wood that is tapered to a thin edge all along its broad side, it is actually called in some countries \"sword.\" Maimonides thought the word aspethei to mean \"nail,\" while his disputant, Rabbi Abraham ben David, thought the same word to mean a \"pair of tongs\" used as an accessory to a candlestick that hung from a wall. Cf. Abraham ben David's gloss in Maimonides' Mishne Torah (Tum'eoth ha-Met 14:7) ===Modern discovery=== The manuscript was retrieved in ca. 1927 by Rabbi Yihya al-Qafih, from the place used by the Jewish community in Sana'a to bury old and worn-out sacred literature (genizah), within the Jewish cemetery itself on the outskirts of the city.Rabbi Yosef Qafih, recalling the event, describes it as follows: \"There is a custom had among most of the people who assume oversight over the synagogues in Yemen that any book that has become worn-out or become very old they'd store it away in the vault situated beneath the hekhal (Ark) and this is its genizah. From time to time, when a sufficient quantity of books, fragments of books, pages and worn-out leaves [of books] has been amassed there, they collect them, place them inside earthenware jars and bury them in the cemetery, near one of the righteous men, and occasionally there are buried books, pages and leaves of valuable worth, which the same person who is meant to oversee [the affairs of the synagogue] has not fully appreciated their worth. To our happiness, many times the grave diggers are too lazy to dig deep, well beneath the earth. Wherefore, occasionally, after the rainy season, especially in the years that are blessed with plenty of rain, the heads of these jars are exposed because of rain erosion, where it eroded and made thin the upper layer of earth. My grandfather who is now deceased, the Rabbi Yihya Qafih, of blessed memory, would complain about the overseers of the synagogues and reprimand them over burying in the genizah things which contain pearls of great beneficial use, and of invaluable worth, without allowing for a man who is more adept [than he] and who knows how to examine them first and to determine what is worthy of being buried and what is still worthy of being used by the coming generations, so as to give some merit to the congregation. He commanded one of the caretakers of the cemetery that, in the event that the heads of the jars such as these should ever be exposed, he was to inform him, before he proceeded to dig deeper in order to bury them once more. I remember when I was about ten years old, the man came to inform my grandfather, of blessed memory, that such [a jar] that had been buried was now exposed. I remember that it was on a Thursday, before nightfall. On the next day, on Friday morning, my grandfather took me with him, and we went out together to the place of the genizah, according to where the informant had directed us. Now since my grandfather, of blessed memory, was already old, above eighty years in age, and it was difficult for him to bend down, I was the one who took out books and fragments of books, and ordinary pages that were wet and moldy, dusty and muddy, both hand-written manuscripts and printed texts; my grandfather, of blessed memory, sitting throughout all this time upon a stone, examining them and sorting them, one by one, until the early afternoon, and then we returned the rest inside the jar and covered it up. We took with us what we had sorted and returned to the city. At the departing of the Sabbath, my grandfather sat down to sort through his spoils, to take-apart the pages [of books] that had already stuck together because of the wetness from the rains that had penetrated within the jar. In this genizah we found hand-written pages from the Babylonian Talmud, and also fragments from Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, from Mishnah commentaries, from the commentaries of Rabbi Saadia Gaon, from the Midrash Hagadol, and many more. Whatsoever our hook brought up on that blessed day is today in my possession. Some of them still show upon them the vestiges of the soil and clay to this very day. Among the spoils, we found an old hand-written book, the majority of whose pages were already sticking together, clumps upon clumps. My grandfather sat a long time, slowly soaking them in water and with great patience, after he had checked and saw to his satisfaction that the letters were not being erased by soaking them in water. I still remember how the pages were strewn across the entire room of my grandfather's workshop, of blessed memory, so that they could dry. After drying and arranging the pages, it was clear that this was the very Mishnah commentary which we now present before our readers. This book was the only surviving sort of its kind in the world, which, had it not been for this action, it would have been lost to the world. The book was missing a few pages, in the Order known as Moed, at the introduction to Tractate Shabbat, it was missing perhaps one page, and in Tractate Pesahim it was again missing perhaps one page, as also in Tractate Yoma it was missing perhaps one page, but the remainder of the book, to our delight, was found altogether complete, from beginning to end\" (See Nathan ben Abraham (1955), vol. 1, s.v. Appendix: Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah [Introduction], p. 6). Three copies were made of the original manuscript, before it was sold to a certain Shelomo Halevi Busani (later of Tel-Aviv), who, in turn, sold the manuscript to the Schechter Library in New York. Today, the original manuscript is housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, under JTS Rab.1492.Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Microfilm 6008. A microfilm of the same is available at the Hebrew University National Library (Manuscripts Department), listed as Microfilm no. F-35334. The pages of the MS., however, show some disorder. One of the three remaining copies, copied in 1930 by Qafih's grandson, was acquired by the Hebrew University library,A Judeo-Arabic copy of the original; three microfilm copies can be seen at the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem: microfilm # F-4850, F-72437 and JER_NLI_593=38. See library's Permanent Link from which a comprehensive study was made of the text by Professor Simcha Assaf who published his findings in the periodical Kiryat Sefer, in 1933. The British Museum possesses a partial copy of Nathan ben Abraham's Judeo-Arabic commentary of the Mishnah (with only the Mishnaic Orders of Zera'im, Mo'ed and Neziqin).British Library, Or. 11117. A microfilm of the same is available at the Hebrew University National Library (Manuscripts Department), listed as Microfilm no's. F-6639 and F-8333. Unlike the disordered pagination in the Yemenite MS., the British Library MS. is collated in its proper order, although part of the Introduction is missing. Among the manuscripts and incunabula collected by David Solomon Sassoon is a two-page Judeo-Arabic copy of the Introduction taken from Rabbi Nathan's commentary, believed to have been singled-out because of its more profound nature.Sassoon, D.S. (1932), pp. 1061\u20131062. Sassoon dated the copy to the 15th-century, but not knowing the full nature of the work, thought it to be an Introduction to the Talmud, and which he surmised was written by Joseph ben Judah ibn \u02bfA\u1e33nin. Rabbi Yosef Qafih has provided a Hebrew translation of the Introduction in the Mishnah published by El ha-Meqorot. ===Publications=== The earliest modern-day printing of Rabbi Nathan's work came in 1955, when the El Meqorot publishers of Jerusalem printed the Hebrew translation of Rabbi Nathan's commentary, yet only as a supplement to other commentaries. In 1958, the same publishers published a single edition, edited by Mordechai Yehuda Leib Sachs. A third edition was published by them in 1965. The Harry Fischel Institute in Jerusalem published the Mishnaic order of Zera'im. In 1973, Me'orot publishers of Jerusalem published an edition of the commentary, although it too was not an exclusive edition, but incorporated other commentaries. ==See also== * Palestinian Gaonate * Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina * List of native plants of Flora Palaestina (A-B) * List of native plants of Flora Palaestina (C-D) * List of native plants of Flora Palaestina (E-O) * List of native plants of Flora Palaestina (P-Z) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * *--() * * * * *(= Kiryat Sefer, X [1934]) * * Danzig, Nahman (1998).
