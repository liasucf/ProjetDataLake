It serves as the home stadium of Mumbai City FC of the Indian Super League. The football stadium holds 7,960 spectators for many ISL games and was expected to be one of the venues for the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. The India national football team played a FIFA international friendly on 3 September 2016 beating Puerto Rico national football team 4\u20131 in front of a packed stadium. This was the first international friendly hosted by the city in 61 years. In June 2018, the stadium hosted all 7 matches of the 2018 Intercontinental Cup, in which the Indian men's football team played against Kenya, New Zealand, and Chinese Taipei in a four-way tournament. India beat Kenya 2\u20130 in the final to win the tournament. Aditya Thackeray, a local politician, and Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor are known to have played an important role in the redevelopment of the stadium. It hosted the 2019 Indian Super League Final featuring Bengaluru FC and FC Goa. Bengaluru F.C won the match due to a late goal from defender Rahul Bheke. This was Bengaluru F.C's first Indian Super League after losing in the final the previous year. ==References== Category:Sports venues in Mumbaihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mumbai_Football_Arena.jpg Category:Football venues in Maharashtra Category:Indian Super League stadiums Category:Sports venues in Maharashtra ",
