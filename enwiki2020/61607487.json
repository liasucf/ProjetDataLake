    "text": "Pompelon is a monotypic moth genus in the family Zygaenidae erected by Francis Walker in 1854. Its only species, Pompelon marginata, was first described by F\u00e9lix \u00c9douard Gu\u00e9rin-M\u00e9neville in 1843. It is a day-flying moth found throughout Southeast Asia, with sightings in the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Sulawesi, Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra. Larvae feed exclusively on Cinnamomum. They often are spotted resting on wild cinnamon trees. Members of this species mimic various species of Euploea. Its larvae have been observed being parasitized by members of the tachinid fly species Senometopia distincta. ==Description== A pair of mating Pompelon Moths P. marginata is a mid-sized day-flying moth with predominantly black and rounded wings, with iridescent blue margins. Its head is surrounded by a red band that resembles that of a collar. Its body stands in stark contrast to its dark dorsal side, having a bright red thorax and abdomen. With its abdomen having a series of black dots along each segment. P. marginata legs are black with a blue metallic sheen. ==Life history== P. marginata caterpillars feed exclusively on Cinnamomum, with each subspecies having a specific species that they feed on. Subspecies found in Singapore have been observed feeding on Cinnamomum iners, whereas others in Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia have been observed feeding on Cinnamomum verum. The larva is predominantly ivory in color, with an uneven distribution of black markings. On the dorsal end, there are verrucae distributed on each segment, they are tipped with black. On these verrucae, there are fine setae, even on the ones distributed on the flanks. When disturbed, the larva emits a clear liquid, potentially serving as a defense mechanism against predation. The pupa tends to bend a single leaf in a U-shaped pattern, forming a brown silk sheet with the tip of the pupa extending out of the sheet. There are also fine white silk threads that emanate from the center of the pupa. ==Subspecies== T. Endo and Y. Kishida (1999) report six subspecies of P. marginata.\"Pompelon marginata (Guerin, 1843)\". Digital Moths of Asia.
