His career peaked again 30 years later as he added his strings and string arrangements to some of the biggest songs and albums of the early 2000's. We are talking \"The Boy is Mine\" \"Cry Me A River\" , and from Graduation and 808's & Heartbreaks to MJ's \"Scream\" and a WHOLE lot in between. Let us not forget his work with the Root's and owning a studio where they would call home for over a decade. Needless to say there is a lot to talk about and learn from our friend Larry Gold.
