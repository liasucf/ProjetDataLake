    "text": "The National Union was a short-lived South African political party founded in 1960 by Japie Basson after he was expelled from the ruling National Party. It was meant to provide a political home for Nationalists who had become disillusioned with J. G. Strydom and Hendrik Verwoerd's increasingly hard-line apartheid policies. Basson recruited former Chief Justice of South Africa Henry Allan Fagan to stand as the party's candidate for President in the 1961 general election, in which the party won 6.26% of the vote but only one parliamentary seat. The party soon fizzled out and was absorbed into the United Party. == References == Category:Liberal parties in South Africa Category:Conservative parties in South Africa Category:Protestant political parties Category:Defunct political parties in South Africa Category:Apartheid in South Africa Category:1960 establishments in South Africa Category:Political parties established in 1960 ",
