He is represented by Greene Naftali. == Early life == Born and raised in Macon, Georgia, Price served four years in the Navy aboard the USS Whidbey Island. His military service enabled him to pursue his art education on the GI Bill. ==Career== Price's artistic practice often involves materials beyond acrylic or vinyl paint, as he incorporates fabric and photographs into his works. The paintings, often on wood panel, embody compositions that blur the line between abstraction and figuration. ==Exhibitions== ===Group exhibitions=== *2013 \u2013 Full Spectrum, Harriet Tubman Museum, Macon, GA *2016 \u2013 Hill of Munch, Rachel Uffner Gallery, New York, NY *2016 \u2013 No Free Tax Art Month, 247365, New York, NY *2017 \u2013 Mondialit\u00e9 (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Asad Raza), Boghossian Foundation \u2013 Villa Empain, Brussels *2017 \u2013 99 Cents or Less, Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, Detroit, MI *2017 \u2013 Fictions, The Studio Museum Harlem, New York, NY *2018 \u2013 FRONT International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art, Cleveland, Ohio *2019 \u2013 Techniques of the Observer, Greene Naftali, New York, NY *2019 \u2013 2019 Whitney Biennial, Whitney Museum of American Art, curated by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta ===Solo exhibitions=== *2016 \u2013 The Modern Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom, Walter Price *2016 \u2013 Karma, New York, Pearl Lines *2017 \u2013 LUMA Foundation, Zurich, 89Plus: Americans 2017 *2018 \u2013 The Modern Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom, Pearl Lines *2018 \u2013 K\u00f6lnischer Kunstverein, Cologne, Germany, Pearl Lines *2018 \u2013 MoMA PS1, Queens, New York ==Permanent collections== *Whitney Museum of Art, New York, NY == Publications == * 2016 - Crystal Black, Karma, New York ==References== ==External links== *Walter Price - Contemporary Art Daily Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:African-American artists Category:African-American painters Category:Artists from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American contemporary artists Category:United States Navy sailors ",
