    "text": "The Murray River in south-eastern Australia has been a significant barrier to land-based travel and trade. This article lists and briefly describes all of the recognised crossing points. Many of these had also developed as river ports for transport of goods along the Murray. Now almost every significant town along the river has a bridge or vehicle-carrying cable ferry nearby. The crossings are listed in order starting from the Murray Mouth and proceeding upstream. ==South Australia== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Image !! Crossing !! Coordinates !! Location !! Built !!

In the 1990s it was found to not be structurally sound enough to safely carry B-double trucks. Until a new bridge could be built, these were diverted from near Monash via Morgan on the Goyder and Thiele Highways to rejoin the Sturt Highway at Gawler, thus travelling further but avoiding the Kingston and Blanchetown bridges. |- | || Blanchetown Bridge || || 1998 || Incrementally launched post tensioned concrete box-girder bridge, built by York Civil. || Replacement bridge on the Sturt Highway immediately north of the 1963 bridge. |-bgcolor=#E0FFFF | 150px || Morgan Ferry || || Morgan|| || || |-bgcolor=#E0FFFF | 150px || Cadell Ferry || || Cadell|| || || |-bgcolor=#E0FFFF | 150px || Waikerie Ferry || || Waikerie|| || || |- | 150px || Kingston on Murray bridge || || Kingston-on- Murray|| 1969 || Sturt Highway A bridge replaced a ferry|| |- | 150px || Berri Bridge || || Berri||1997 || A bridge replaced two ferries|| |-bgcolor=#E0FFFF | 150px || Lyrup Ferry || || Lyrup || |||| |- | 150px || Paringa Bridge || || Paringa-Renmark||1926 || Sturt Highway, liftspan bridge - one lane of traffic each way with pedestrian/bike path in the middle on the former railway alignment. || |} Ferry nameboard As the ferries are registered as boats, each one has a name, usually named after a waterbird. As of December 2017, the ferry names are: *Narrung: Dotterel *Wellington: Heron *Tailem Bend: Rosella *Mannum large (downstream): Swan *Mannum (small, upstream): Pelican *Purnong: Kingfisher *Walker Flat: Stilt II *Swan Reach: Water Hen *Morgan: Coot *Cadell: Albatross II *Waikerie: Quail *Lyrup: Cockatoo ==In Victoria and New South Wales== The south bank of the river forms the border between these two states and former colonies, so in many cases there is a town on each side of the river. If two towns are named in this list, the Victorian one is first for clarity and consistency. Most of the bridges downstream of Echuca are liftspan bridges to enable paddlesteamer traffic to pass underneath even in times of high water flow. The Hume, Newell and Sturt Highway bridges are owned and managed by the Federal Government. The others are the responsibility of New South Wales and Victoria. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Image !!
