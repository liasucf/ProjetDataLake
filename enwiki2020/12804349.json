Among his colleagues in the Mammal Department at the AMNH were Karl Koopman, Marie A. Lawrence, Guy Musser, and Sydney Anderson. In the late 1950s, while on the Puritan Expedition to the Baja Peninsula, he discovered a new species of vesper bat commonly known as Van Gelder's Bat. His later research included the study of the nyala in Mozambique. He was a President of the American Society of Mammalogists from 1968-1970. He was the author of a number of mammalogy books including Biology of Mammals and Mammals of the National Parks as well as a large range of mammal related children's books such as Bats, Animals in Winter, The Professor and the Mysterious Box, The Professor and the Vanishing Flags, Monkeys and Apes, and Whose Nose Is This? He died in 1994 of acute monocytic leukemia. ==Published works== *A Taxonomic Revision of the Spotted Skunks (genus Spilogale) (1959) *New Antrozous (Mammalia, Vespertilionidae) from the Tres Mar\u00edas Islands, Nayarit, Mexico - by Richard George Van Gelder; Richard George Zweifel; Oakes Plimpton (Puritan-American Museum of Natural History Expedition to Western Mexico - 1957) (1959) *Marine Mammals from the Coasts of Baja California and the Tres Mar\u00edas Islands, Mexico (Puritan Expedition) (1960) *The Taxonomy and Status of Bats in Bermuda - by Richard George Van Gelder; David B.
