    "text": "Mihriban Mihri\u015fah Sultan (; 1 June 1916 \u2013 25 January 1987) was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of heir to the throne \u015eehzade Yusuf Izzeddin, son of Sultan Abdulaziz, and Leman Han\u0131m. She was the second wife of \u015eehzade \u00d6mer Faruk, son of the last Caliph of the Muslim world, Abdulmejid II and \u015eehsuvar Han\u0131m. ==Early life== Mihri\u015fah Sultan was born on 1 June 1916 in Be\u015fikta\u015f Palace. Her father was crown prince \u015eehzade Yusuf Izzeddin who had died 4 months before her birth, and her mother was Leman Han\u0131m, the daughter of Ahmed Bey and \u015e\u00fckriye Han\u0131m. She was the fourth child, and second daughter born to her father and the third child of her mother. She had two elder siblings, a sister, \u015e\u00fckriye Sultan, ten years elder than her and a brother, \u015eehzade Mehmed Nizameddin, seven years elder than her. She was the granddaughter of Abdulaziz and D\u00fcrr\u00fcnev Kad\u0131n. At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Mihri\u015fah moved to Alexandria, Egypt. ==First marriage== \u015eehzade \u00d6mer Faruk had an increased interest in his cousin Mihri\u015fah. It was also a public knowledge that things were not going well between Faruk and his wife Princess Sabiha Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Mehmed VI. In 1944, Mihri\u015fah even sided with Faruk when the council chose Prince Ahmed Nihad as the head of the family. While Sabiha backed the council's decision and approved the choice of the leader. His daughters also sided with their mother. Faruk accused Sabiha of turning their daughters against him. But he was already in love with Mihri\u015fah and the issue of the council was just an excuse. Faruk divorced Sabiha on 5 March 1948, after twenty eight years of marriage, and just four months later married Mihri\u015fah in a religious ceremony on 31 July 1948. In the prenuptial agreement she asked that the right to divorce her husband be included in the contract. She owned a small apartment building No. 8 Road 11 off Menashe Avenue in Cairo. Nesli\u015fah Sultan tells in her memoirs that after Faruk married her they were not on good terms with each other. They still saw each other but Nesli\u015fah refused to be anywhere near her. She, however, took good care of Faruk. Realizing how she was sacrificing herself for his sake, Nesli\u015fah decided to see her again. It was Faruk's habit to come to Nesli\u015fah's house for lunch on Mondays, and from then on he began to bring Mihri\u015fah with him. However, their marriage did not last and a few years later, Mihri\u015fah divorced Faruk using her right to divorce her husband. Later Faruk would tell his friends \"I divorced the most beautiful woman in the world to marry the ugliest one. Fate!\" ==Second marriage== After Mihri\u015fah divorced \u00d6mer Faruk, she married \u015eevket Arslano\u011flu. In 1952, Mihri\u015fah returned to Istanbul after the revocation of the law of exile for princesses. She spent her last years with her cousin Gevheri Sultan, daughter of her uncle \u015eehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin, in a spacious apartment in Taksim Square. ==Death== Mihri\u015fah Sultan died on 25 January 1987 at the age of seventy, and was buried in the mausoleum of her great-grandfather Sultan Mahmud II, Divanyolu, Istanbul. ==Ancestry== ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1916 births Category:1987 deaths Category:People from Istanbul Category:Daughters of Ottoman sultans Category:20th-century Ottoman royalty Category:20th-century women of the Ottoman Empire ",
