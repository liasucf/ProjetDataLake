    "text": "Hell Bent for Letters is the second full-length album by the Seattle, Washington-based literary-metal band Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag. It is their first release for Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label. It was produced and recorded by the band's guitarist, Dr. J.M. McNulty, under his less formal name of Jeff McNulty. The album title is a pun on the Judas Priest album Hell Bent for Leather. One reviewer described the album by suggesting, \"[i]magine history class taught by GWAR, and it's still not quite enough to capture the essence of what Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag bring to the table.\"Rob Theakston, [ AllMusic.com review] of Hell Bent for Letters, June 2006.
