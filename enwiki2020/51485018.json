    "text": "Harry McKirdy (born 29 March 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for League Two side Port Vale. McKirdy is a product of the Aston Villa and Stoke City academies. While in Aston Villa's academy he played on loan at English Football League sides Stevenage, Crewe Alexandra and Newport County. He played for Carlisle United on a permanent basis during the 2019\u201320 season and then signed with Port Vale in September 2020. ==Career== ===Aston Villa=== McKirdy was born in London and brought up in the Stoke-on- Trent area, where he attended St Joseph's College. He was on the books of Stoke City from the age of seven to fourteen, and then joined Aston Villa's academy. He signed a scholarship in 2013, and went on to sign a two-year professional contract with the \"Villans\" in 2016. He scored six goals in the 2016 HKFC Soccer Sevens tournament to win the golden boot, with one of his goals coming in the final as Villa beat West Ham United 2\u20130 to claim their sixth tournament title. He achieved this despite having only recently returned to fitness following a five-month lay-off with injury. McKirdy trained with the first-team in 2016\u201317 pre-season, and joined League Two club Stevenage on 31 August 2016, on loan until January 2017. He made his senior debut for \"Boro\" on 24 September, coming on as a substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat to Exeter City at Broadhall Way. He scored his first career goal in an EFL Trophy tie against Brighton & Hove Albion Under-23s on 4 October. He marked his first league start with the winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory at Mansfield Town on 29 October. Head coach Darren Sarll said that \"it was a terrific finish, the temperament of the lad to go through on his debut and finish like that, top drawer, the lad's going to be a good player\". In October 2017, McKirdy signed a contract extension to keep him at Villa Park until 2019. On 19 January 2018, he signed for Crewe Alexandra on loan to the end of the 2017\u201318 season. He scored on his debut after coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3\u20132 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers at Gresty Road on 20 January. Manager David Artell revealed that: \"He even said that if money was an issue then he would look to pay his own way. That made me smile. That shows a real desire and hunger to come out on loan and play some football.\" McKirdy had been keen on the loan move with the \"Railwaymen\" and had consulted with Ashley Westwood and Steve Bruce before making up his mind. He scored three goals in 16 League Two games at Crewe Alex. On 31 January 2019, McKirdy joined League Two side Newport County on loan until the end of the 2018\u201319 season. He made his debut for the \"Exiles\" on 19 February as a second-half substitute in a 4\u20131 win at Notts County. He scored his first goal for Newport on 13 April in a 3\u20130 win against Cambridge United. He was part of the team that reached the League Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 25 May, although he was an unused substitute in the final, which ended in a 1\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers. He was used primarily as a substitute by manager Michael Flynn, making 11 substitute appearances and only two starts during his time at Rodney Parade, scoring one goal. McKirdy was released by Aston Villa in May 2019. ===Carlisle United=== McKirdy signed a one-year deal with League Two club Carlisle United on 11 June 2019. He scored a headed goal six minutes into his debut for the \"Cumbrians\", in a 2\u20131 win over Crawley Town on 3 August. Manager Steven Pressley said after the game that \"I'm pleased for him because he\u2019s a really good kid. He takes a bit of managing, but he's a good kid underneath that\". McKirdy scored 11 goals from 38 games to finish as United's top-scorer for the 2019\u201320 season. However he was released in May 2020. Manager Chris Beech said that \"I respect the skill sets he has got... [but] Harry wasn't happy... [and] I don\u2019t want to get a footballer in a headlock and make him do something he doesn\u2019t want to do\". ===Port Vale=== McKirdy signed a one-year contract with League Two side Port Vale on 11 September 2020 after impressing manager John Askey on trial. ==Style of play== McKirdy is a versatile attacker, able to play in any forward position, either centrally or out wide. Crewe boss David Artell called McKirdy \"a natural goalscorer\" and \"one of those nuisance forwards, who gets under the feet of centre-halves\". He has been criticized for his temperament, particularly in regards to his reactions to jeering by fans both on the pitch and on social media. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Aston Villa |2016\u201317 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\" | Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |Stevenage (loan) |2016\u201317 |League Two |11||1||1||0||0||0||1||1||13||2 |- |Crewe Alexandra (loan) |2017\u201318 |League Two |16||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||16||3 |- |Newport County (loan) |2018\u201319 |League Two |12||1||0||0||0||0||1||0||13||1 |- |Carlisle United |2019\u201320 |League Two |28||5||5||5||2||1||3||0||38||11 |- |Port Vale |2020\u201321 |League Two |2||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"3\" | Career total !69!!10!!6!!5!!3!!1!!5!!1!!83!!17 |} ==References== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Greater London Category:Sportspeople from Stoke-on-Trent Category:People educated at St. Joseph's College, Stoke-on-Trent Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Newport County A.F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
