    "text": "The Saht\u00fa or North Slavey (historically called Hare or Hareskin Indians) are a Dene First Nations people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group living in the vicinity of Great Bear Lake (Saht\u00fa, the source of their name), Northwest Territories, Canada. The Saht\u00fa peoples live in Colville Lake, Deline, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells and Tulita which form the Sahtu Region of the NWT.Sahtu CommunitiesAbout MACA - Sahtu The Dene of the region are represented by the Sahtu Dene Council who, in 1993, signed the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. Saht\u00fa groups include the Hare Dene (K'ahsho Got'ine District, today: Colville Lake and Fort Good Hope), Bear Lake Dene (D\u00e9line District), and Mountain Dene (Tulit'a District). They call themselves also \u0241ehdzo Got\u2019\u0131\u0328ne (Trap People). ==Ethnography== An early description of Saht\u00fa cultures is given in Alexander Mackenzie's journal of his voyage down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789.Voyages from Montreal Through the Continent of North America to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans in 1789 and 1793 Although there are close interrelationships among the Dene communities, they are culturally and linguistically distinct. The K\u2019ahsho Got\u2019ine (Hare(skin) Dene) are now centred in Fort Good Hope and Colville Lake. The Shita Got\u2019ine (Mountain Dene) have joined with the K\u2019\u00e1\u00e1l\u01eb Got\u2019ine (Willow Lake Dene) (they lived around K\u2019\u00e1\u00e1l\u00f4 Tu\u00e9 - \u2033Willow Lake\u2033, today known as Brackett Lake) in the community of Tulit\u2019a. The Saht\u00faot\u2019ine (Saht\u00fa Dene or Great Bear Lake Dene) are named after Saht\u00fa/Great Bear Lake, and are based in Deline. M\u00e9tis people, descendants of relationships established between Dene people and fur traders, reside in all five communities of the region. The Hareskin Dene called themselves K'a so Got\u2019ine/Katoo Got\u2019ine (\"big willow people\") or K\u2019ahsho Got\u2019ine/K'\u00e1shot\u2019 Got\u2019ine (\u2033big-arrowhead-people\u2033, mistranslated as Hareskin people, an English rendering of Gahwi\u00e9 Got\u2019ine - \u2033Rabbit(skin) People\u2033). The D\u00e9line community of the Saht\u00fa Dene experienced great loss during Canada's participation in the Manhattan Project. The need for radioactive materials, (such as radium), to create atomic weapons was met with the deposits mined from the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium on Great Bear Lake. The Saht\u00fa Dene were hired to transport the ore containing radium from the Northwest Territories to be processed in Ontario or the United States. Since much of the uranium that existed in Europe was under Nazi control, the radium deposits in Canada were vital to the creation of the first atomic bombs. Unaware of the radiation's effects, the Saht\u00fa Dene used \"cloth sacks\" to transport the ore.The Dene People of Great Bear Lake Call for a Federal Response to Uranium Deaths in DelineDeline Poisoned? Past area mining linked to cancerNuclear Genocide in Canada The number of deaths caused by radiation is disputed by the Government of Canada. The government report says that the people of Deline did not handle yellowcake but sulfur powder.CDUT Final Report Summary Ultimately, the devastating effects of radiation poisoning impacted the D\u00e9line community severely. A 1999 documentary by Peter Blow entitled Village of Widows detailed the experiences of the Saht\u00fa Dene. == Today's Sahtu Dene First Nations == Sahtu Dene CouncilThe Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated (Sahtu Dene Council * Behdzi Ahda' First Nation (headquartered in Colville Lake (K'\u00e1hbam\u012f\u0301t\u00fa\u00e9 - \u2033ptarmigan net place\u2033), ancestral homeland of the K'ahsho Got'ine (Hare(skin) Dene), the surrounding area is still inhabited by them, reserve: Colville Lake Settlement, Population: 219) * D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 First NationWebsite of the Deline First Nation (Deline (D\u00e9l\u0131n\u0119) - \u2033Where the Water Flows\", pronounced \u2032day-li-neh\u2032, located near the headwaters of the Bear River (Sahtu De), where it rushes out of Great Bear Lake to the Mackenzie River, a place nearby where the lake seldom freezes over was a fishing place for the Saht\u00faot\u2019ine/Sahtugotine (Bear Lake Dene), reserve: Fort Franklin Settlement, Population: 981, Saht\u00fa Dene families are often related to K'ahsho Got'ine (Hare(skin Dene), Gwich\u2019in and Shita Got'ine (Mountain Dene) peoples. The people of Great Bear Lake had to be hardy and resourceful to survive in the past. Within living memory, they lived a nomadic life, following fish and game with the seasons. Many still supplement their diets by hunting, fishing and trapping at least part of the time. Homes often feature a traditional lodge or tipi used to smoke meat and fish. In contrast, many of these same homes today are equipped with satellite dishes to pull in North American television.) * Fort Good Hope First Nation (also known as K\u2019asho Gotine Dene Band orK\u2019asho Go\u2019tine Community Council), headquartered in Fort Good Hope (or the Charter Community of K'asho Got'ine), called R\u00e1dey\u00eel\u00eek\u00f3\u00e9 - \"Where the Rapids Are\" by the local K'ahsho Got'ine (Hare(skin) Dene), is located on a peninsula between Jackfish Creek and the east bank of the Mackenzie River, about 145 km (90 mi) northwest of Norman Wells, reserve: Fort Good Hope Settlement, Population: 869) * Tulita Dene First Nation (Tulita Band Council, also known as Begade Shotagotine First Nation, headquartered in Tulit'a - \"Where the two Rivers Meet\", which was formerly known as Fort Norman, reserve: Fort Norman Settlement, Population: 670) - they are as Begade Shotagotine (eng), Begaa Deh Shuh Tah Got\u2019ie (North Slavey) or as Begaee Shuhagot'ine (South Slavey variety) also members of the Dehcho First Nations of the South Slavey ==Language== Saht\u00fa speak the North Slavey language, which belongs to northwestern Canada group of Northern Athabaskan languages. ==Notable Sahtu people== *Ethel Blondin-Andrew, former Member of Parliament for the district of the Western Arctic * Rosemary Georgeson, mixed Sahtu/Coast Salish multi- media artist * Stephen Kakfwi, politician and was the ninth Premier of the Northwest Territories * Rick Rivet (born 1949), Neo-expressionist painter\"The Fellows: 1999.\" Eiteljorg Fellowship for Native American Fine Art.
