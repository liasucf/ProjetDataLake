    "text": "The Afternoon Delights was a Boston-based vocal studio quartet, including Rebecca Hall, Janet Powell, Robalee Barnes, and Suzanne Boucher. ==Career== In 1981, they released the novelty song \"General Hospi-Tale\" that parodied the ABC soap opera General Hospital. The song peaked at number 23 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles chart and number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Soon after, they released an EP, but it had very little success and the group quickly disbanded. General Hospital revisited the group's iconic single in an episode that aired on April 28, 2013, as part of the series' 50th anniversary. The song was co-written by Harry King (local producer) and Lisa (Lips) Tedesco, a soap updater for Medford-based station Kiss 108. The song was integrated into a movie, Young Doctors in Love, which had a successful run on cable channels in the US and abroad. It sold 850,000 7-inch singles and 250,000 12-inch copies. ==References== Category:Musical groups from Boston Category:American girl groups ",
