Shelton introduced Bill 80-35 in the Guam Legislature to require that the Guam Power Authority generate 50% of its power from renewable energy sources by 2035. Public Law 29-62, authored by then-Sens. Ben Pangelinan, Jim Espaldon and Benjamin Cruz in 2008, set a goal of 25% renewable energy by 2035. At the time, GPA had no renewable energy in its portfolio. As of 2019, 6% of GPA's energy portfolio comes from renewable energy. The solar farm contracts approved in 2018 will bring 120 megawatts online for GPA by 2022, meeting the 25% renewable energy target 13 years early. The new solar farms opening by 2022 will produce solar energy 58.75% cheaper than the previous solar farm. Raising the goal to 50% would eventually save ratepayers $10.4 million a year in the fuel surcharges that show up on their bills.Daily Post Staff.
