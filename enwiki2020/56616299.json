    "text": "In stochastic processes, Kramers\u2013Moyal expansion refers to a Taylor series expansion of the master equation, named after Hans Kramers and Jos\u00e9 Enrique Moyal. This expansion transforms the integro-differential master equation :\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} =\\int dx'[W(x|x')p(x',t)-W(x'|x)p(x,t)] where p(x,t|x_0,t_0) (for brevity, this probability is denoted by p(x,t)) is the transition probability density, to an infinite order partial differential equation :\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \\frac{\\partial^n}{\\partial x^n}[\\alpha_n(x) p(x,t)] where :\\alpha_n(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x'-x)^n W(x'\\mid x) \\ dx'. Here W(x'\\mid x) is the transition probability rate. Fokker\u2013Planck equation is obtained by keeping only the first two terms of the series in which \\alpha_1 is the drift and \\alpha_2 is the diffusion coefficient. ==Pawula theorem== The Pawula theorem states that the expansion either stops after the first term or the second termR.

F. (1967). Approximation of the linear Boltzmann equation by the Fokker-Planck equation. Physical review, 162(1), 186.. If the expansion continues past the second term it must contain an infinite number of terms, in order that the solution to the equation be interpretable as a probability density function. ==Implementations== * Implementation in Python: https://github.com/LRydin/KramersMoyal ==References== Category:Statistical mechanics Category:Stochastic calculus ",
