    "text": "Trevor's World of Sport began as a 2003 BBC television sitcom written and directed by Andy Hamilton and starring Neil Pearson as Trevor. One series of the television series was made, followed by three series which were aired on BBC Radio 4, as a continuation of the television series. ==Cast== * Neil Pearson as Trevor Heslop * Paul Reynolds as Sammy Dobbs * Rosalind Ayres as Theresa * Abdul Salis as Barry * Cosima Shaw as Heidrun * Michael Fenton Stevens as Ralph Renton * Claire Skinner as Meryl ==Plot== The series is set in the world of TS Sports \u2013 a sports public relations firm, run by Trevor Heslop and his partner, the lascivious Sammy Dobbs (Paul Reynolds). Trevor is portrayed as an essentially decent, honest man in the corrupt money-obsessed industry of sporting celebrity, who is still deeply in love with his estranged wife Meryl (Claire Skinner). The other TS Sports office staff are the cool German receptionist Heidrun (Cosima Shaw), whose lesbianism obsesses Sammy; the young black trainee Barry (Abdul Salis); and strongly Christian office manager Theresa (Rosalind Ayres). Andy Hamilton also appears in a minor role within the show, and several actors who have worked in his other comedy shows for television and radio appear. Neil Pearson was in Hamilton's Drop the Dead Donkey, as (briefly) was Michael Fenton Stevens who plays TS Sports' only regular client, fading celebrity Ralph Renton. ==Episodes== ===The television series=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The first episode attracted an average of 3.4 million viewers, dropping to 2.9 million for the second and third episodes. The subsequent episodes were rescheduled from Friday evenings (just after the 9:00pm watershed) to Monday nights (after the 10:00pm news), despite the Radio Times issues having already been published listing the originally scheduled transmission dates. Hamilton went public with his displeasure over the show's scheduling and vowed never to work for BBC1 again, though he has since changed his mind.Hamilton said in February 2009 that since those who made the decisions have now moved on, \"it would have been daft to nurse that grievance for ever\". I did it my way: Andy Hamilton, BBC Radio 7, 09:00 21 February 2009. A radio version was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2004, with subsequent series in 2005 and 2007. ==DVD release== The complete television series was released on DVD by Acorn Media UK on 6 May 2013. ==References== ==External links== * * *BBC Comedy Guide to this show Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:BBC Radio comedy programmes Category:2003 British television series debuts Category:2003 British television series endings Category:2000s British sitcoms Category:2004 radio programme debuts Category:2007 radio programme endings Category:Television series based on radio shows Category:Television series by Hat Trick Productions Category:English-language television shows Category:English- language radio programs Category:2000s British sports television series ",
