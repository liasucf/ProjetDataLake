    "text": "The 1906 Campeonato Paulista, organized by the LPF (Liga Paulista de Football), was the 5th season of S\u00e3o Paulo's top association football league. Germ\u00e2nia won the title for the 1st time. No teams were relegated and the top scorers were Germ\u00e2nia's Hermann Friese and Internacional's Le\u00f4nidas with 7 goals. ==System== The championship was disputed in a double-round robin system, with the team with the most points winning the title. ==Championship== Before the start of the championship, a split happened between the players and officials of Paulistano, with many of the former leaving to join AA das Palmeiras. The previous champions went out of the running for the title quickly, as Paulistano was still trying to rebuild its team and S\u00e3o Paulo Athletic was in decline, so the title was mostly disputed between Palmeiras and Germ\u00e2nia. After a string of poor performances, capped with a 1-9 loss to Internacional, S\u00e3o Paulo Athletic withdrew from the championship. Later, Mackenzie also withdrew, after the school shut down its sports department.O Estado de S. Paulo, 22 oct. 1906, p. 2. After AA das Palmeiras' last match, against Internacional, which would have secured the title for them, Internacional reported AA das Palmeiras to LPF claiming irregularities on ticket sales, and despite the fact that no irregularities were proven, LPF expelled AA das Palmeiras from the league and Germ\u00e2nia were declared champions instead.O Estado de S. Paulo, 23 oct. 1906, p. 4.Correio Paulistano, 23 out. 1906, p. 4. As a consequence, AA das Palmeiras broke with LPF, with both only reconciling in 1909, and the 1906 championship being struck from the league's records upon their reconciliation.O Estado de S. Paulo, 12 mar. 1908, p. 3.O Estado de S. Paulo, 22 mar. 1908, p. 3.O Estado de S. Paulo, 14 jul. 1908, p. 4.O Estado de S. Paulo, 6 ago. 1908, p. 3.O Estado de S. Paulo, 5 dec. 1908, p. 3.O Estado de S. Paulo, 24 dec. 1908, p. 3. However, years later, FPF retroactively declared all of LPF's Paulista championships as official, including the 1906 edition. ==References== Category:Campeonato Paulista seasons Paulista ",
