    "text": "Philippe \"Phil\" Briones (born August 12, 1970) is a French animator, author and comic book artist. His pencils are usually inked by himself. ==Biography== He did his studies in France, at the \" Beaux-arts\" in Beaune, and at the \" CFT Goblins\" in Paris. Right after his studies, he was recruited by Disney Studios to work in animation, and he started by working on \"A Goofy Movie\", in 1994. He worked on several Disney animation movies, but it is important to notice that he has been the clean-up supervisor on Tarzan's adult character, and collaborated with the number one in animation, Glen Keane for 2 years. At the same time, in 2002, he started his author career by working for the French editor \"Soleil Production\" on titles such as \"Les Seigneurs d'Agartha\", \"Tales of the Dragon Guard\" and \"Kookaburra\". He signed his first contract at Marvel Comics in 2006, on the \"White Tiger\" series. Then, he worked on various series with famous characters such as Namor, Iron Man, Spider Man, and X-Men, until he was approached by DC Comics, in 2015. They first offered him to illustrate the \"Suicide Squad\" series. He then worked on a \"Flash\" issue, and is now acting on the \"Aquaman\" Rebirth series. While drawing for DC Comics, he still works for French editors, with some various and sometimes stunning collaborations (Karate Boy, PSG Heroes). Co-scriptwriter, he also has illustrated the Geek Agency Series, which cleverly associate action, pop culture references and humor. He achieved in 2016 an album in the \"7\" collection at Delcourt.( \"7 h\u00e9ros\"). ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title ! Credits !
