It was the fourth single from The Ikettes' debut album Soul The Hits, and became their second R&B; hit of the year following \"Peaches 'N' Cream.\" == Critical reception == The record was chosen as Cash Box's (August 7, 1965) Pick of the Week: > The Iketters are a cinch to create a tremendous sales-stir with this in both > the pop and r&b; markets. The top lid here, \"I'm So Thankful\" a slow- > shufflin' romantic ode about a love-sick gal who is on cloud nine since she > met the fella of her dreams. Undercut, \"Don\u2019t Feel Sorry Me,\" is a hard- > driving blues twister about a jilted lass who claims happy that her romance > went kaput. == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Chart (1965) !Peak position |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | align=\"center\" |74 |- |US Billboard R&B; Singles | align=\"center\" |12 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | align=\"center\" |70 |- |US Cash Box Top 50 R&B; | align=\"center\" |16 |- |US Record World 100 Top Pops | align=\"center\" |60 |- |US Record World Top 40 R&B; | align=\"center\" |7 |} == References == Category:1965 songs Category:1965 singles Category:The Ikettes songs Category:Modern Records singles Category:American pop songs Category:Songs written by Frank Wilson (musician) Category:Songs written by Marc Gordon ",
