Instead, she was referred to by her hull designation. ==Construction== LST-409 was laid down on 9 September 1942, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 929, by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Baltimore, Maryland; launched 15 November 1942; then transferred to the United Kingdom and commissioned on 6 January 1943. ==Service history== LST-409 saw no active service in the United States Navy. The tank landing ship was decommissioned and returned to United States Navy custody on 2 July 1946, and struck from the Navy list on 29 October, that same year. Sometime between 21 November 1946 and 6 January 1947, LST-409 was sold to Greece. == See also == * List of United States Navy LSTs == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1942 ships Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the Royal Navy Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United Kingdom Category:S3-M2-K2 ships ",
