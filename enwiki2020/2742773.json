The sect was found to have engaged in fortune telling fraud in Japan. ==History== It is often called the \"foot reading cult\", because its founder, Hogen Fukunaga, claimed he could make a diagnosis by examining people's feet. He founded the group in 1987 after an alleged spiritual event where he claimed to have realized he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and the Buddha. The group at one time claimed 30,000 members. However, Fukunaga charged $900 for the foot readings and a suspicion arose that he used the money to benefit himself. He was accused of swindling money from housewives and had to pay over a million dollars in damages.\"Foot-reader fined for fraud\", BBC, 25 December 2000 Fukunaga started preaching in 1980, claiming to be the world's final savior following Jesus Christ and Buddha.\"Honohana foot-cult guru gets 12 years for fraud\", The Japan Times, July 16, 2005 He was then 34 and saddled with 500 million yen of debt. Soon he became a household name through the publication of texts (nearly 70 at latest count) penned by ghostwriters. In 1987 the sect gained official recognition as a religious corporation.\"Supreme and ugly truths\", Asahi News, May 7, 2000 In a twist on palm reading, Fukunaga and other cult leaders read the soles of people's feet.\"Police raid foot-reading cult\", Mainichi Daily News, Dec. 2, 1999, They told the victims, who visited the cult for counseling about physical or family problems, that their problems would worsen unless they attended a cult seminar, which cost 2.25 million yen, or donated up to 14.3 million yen to the cult.\"Honohana cultists admit to fraud\", The Japan Times, Oct. 24, 2000 They used shocking words to fuel their concern, falsely claimed their diseases could be cured through training in his cult, and swindled exorbitant amounts of money from them. They were urged to purchase high-priced scrolls and other ornaments that were said to ward off evil, cure illnesses, deliver from sin, and break family curses. The intimidation was often accompanied by a specific threat. A victim was coerced during a number of visits by cult officials to shell out another $22,000 for a five-day training seminar at the cult's sprawling headquarters below Mount Fuji. The purpose, he said, was to \"purify\" his mind and body.Uli Schmetzer, \"In Japan, Spirituality Search Can Lead to Cults\", Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2001 The leader set cult members strict recruitment goals in a bid to swell the group's ranks. Separate goals were set for each of the group's branch offices. When the cult's new facility was being built, at a cost of 600 million yen, Fukunaga reportedly ordered cult members to work toward an even harder goal.\"Cult leader set tough goals for followers\", Yomiuri Shimbun, December 4, 1999 Staff members eagerly studied Fukunaga's methods of threatening people to make them enroll in special training sessions, the sources said. At these meetings, Fukunaga repeatedly said that lying was acceptable to lure people to enroll in the special training. \"You should use your 'wisdom' and say things, even if they may not actually be true.\" He explained that lies were acceptable as people would learn reason once they began the special training. The group prepared a manual to train people.\"Sole man gladhanded rich and famous\", Mainichi Daily News (Japan), Dec. 3, 1999 Fukunaga would wear $5,000 suits and custom-made Italian shoes. His wife, according to senior cult members, regularly spent $6,000 to $7,000 a month shopping. Fukunaga reportedly obtained 60 billion yen from more than 10,000 people over the past 13 years, while he spent enormous amounts enhancing his reputation as a religious leader by \"buying\" audiences with former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II, President Clinton, Mother Teresa, Margaret Thatcher, Sathya Sai Baba and celebrities.

The founder was sentenced to 12 years in prison for bilking his flock out of 150 million yen in the name of religious training. 15 senior cult members were charged with the mass fraud. Nine of the 15 were given verdicts, with all of them convicted.\"Japanese foot-reading cult's 2IC jailed for five years\", AFP, December 6, 2001 Prosecutors charged them with practicing medicine without a license. Fukunaga might yet face manslaughter charges in the deaths of four recruits who died during rigorous initiation rites at Mount Fuji. Legal experts say Japan's criminal justice system is ill-equipped to combat the cult phenomenon. ==References== ==External links== *\"Japanese court throws book at foot cult\", Salon *\"Edited articles on the \"Foot Cult\" of Japan\", Fullerton Category:Religious organizations based in Japan Category:Religious organizations established in 1987 Hana Category:Buddhist new religious movements Category:Christian new religious movements Category:Confidence tricks ",
