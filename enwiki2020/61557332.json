Since the 1980s the collection has been split between two buildings, with the fine arts housed in an 18th-century h\u00f4tel particulier and a separate Lapidary Museum in the former chapel of the city's Jesuit college on rue de la R\u00e9publique. It is one of the museums run by the Fondation Calvet. Its collections also include goldwork, faience, porcelain, tapestries, ironwork and other examples of the decorative arts, along with archaeology and Asian, Oceanic and African ethnography. == History == === The h\u00f4tel de Villeneuve-Martignan === The museum is housed in a building on the site of the Livr\u00e9e de Cambrai, named after its last inhabitant, cardinal Pierre d'Ailly, bishop of Cambrai. In 1719, it was sold to Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Villeneuve, marquis d'Arzeliers and lord of Martignan, in the Principality of Orange.Joseph Girard, op cit, . (1698-1789), Portrait of Esprit Calvet (c. 1778-1780), Avignon, mus\u00e9e Calvet. In 1734, de Villeneuve's son Jacques-Ignace de Villeneuve decided to extend the building to designs by , but later changed his mind and razed the whole building in 1741, replacing it with a completely new one to designs by .Joseph Girard, op cit, . Work on this new construction was only completed in 1749,Joseph Girard, op cit, . which was then bought in 1802 by the businessman Deleutre, who then rented it to the city authorities as a home for Esprit Calvet's collections.
