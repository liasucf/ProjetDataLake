Its building from 1859 in N\u00f8rregade is listed. ==History== When the latin school in K\u00f8ge closed in 1776, it was a great loos of prestige for the town amdaspiring students now had to go to Roskilde, N\u00e6stved of Copenhagen to study. A new school, Borgerskolen, opened in 1808. It was based in the old provost's house, Provsteg\u00e5rden, at the corner of N\u00f8rregade and Katekismusgade. In 1826, Thomas T\u00f8xen, a wealthy merchant with no children, made a donation of 15,000 Danish rigsdaler for the establishment of a \"higher school\" in K\u00f8ge. He had inherited the Oluf I. Jensen House in Brogade (No. 5-7) in 1783 and had previously made large donations to the church and indigent citizens. Only the proceeds of his donation could be used. He outlived his wife and lived the last years of his life at K\u00f8ge Torc 22 up to his death in 1945. In 1856, when the interests had grown to 8,000 rigsdaler, it was finally decided to build the school. A site between the town's North Gate and Norske L\u00f8ve was chosen and the school was inaugurated on 2 February 1859. In the mid-1980s, it was decided to merge the school with Brochmand's School and the name of the school was changed to Sct. Nikolaj Skole. ==References== ==External links== Category:Education in K\u00f8ge Category:Listed buildings and structures in K\u00f8ge Municipality Category:Listed educational buildings in Denmark Category:School buildings completed in 1859 Category:1859 establishments in Denmark ",
