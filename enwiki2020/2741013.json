    "text": "Love at first sight is a personal experience as well as a common trope or stock convention in literature: a person or character feels an instant, extreme, and ultimately long-lasting romantic attraction for a stranger upon first seeing that stranger. Described by poetshttp://wordsarewild.com/index.php/2016/10/first-sight-love/ and critics since the emergence of ancient Greece, falling in love at first sight has become one of the most common tropes in Western fiction. ==Historical conceptions== ===Greek=== In the classical world, the phenomenon of \"love at first sight\" was understood within the context of a more general conception of passionate love, a kind of madness or, as the Greeks put it, theia mania (\"madness from the gods\"). This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological psychological schema involving \"love's arrows\" or \"love darts,\" the source of which was often given as the mythological Eros or Cupid,See, for example, the Amores and the Heroides of Ovid which frequently refer to the overwhelming passion caused by the Cupid's darts. sometimes by other mythological deities (such as RumorSee Ovid's letter from Paris, below.). At times, the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows arrived at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' his or her heart, overwhelming them with desire and longing (love sickness). The image of the \"arrow's wound\" was sometimes used to create oxymorons and rhetorical antithesis. \"Love at first sight\" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, and is illustrated in numerous Greek and Roman works. In Ovid's 8 AD epic, Metamorphoses, Narcissus becomes immediately spellbound and charmed by his own (unbeknownst to him) image, and Echo also falls in love with Narcissus at first sight. In Achilles Tatius's Leucippe and Clitophon, the lover Clitophon thus describes his own experience of the phenomenon: \"As soon as I had seen her, I was lost. For Beauty's wound is sharper than any weapon's, and it runs through the eyes down to the soul. It is through the eye that love's wound passes, and I now became a prey to a host of emotions...\"John J. Winkler (trans.), Leucippe and Clitophon, in Another classical interpretation of the phenomenon of \"hunger at first sight\" is found in Plato's Symposium (c. 385-370 BC), in Aristophanes' description of the separation of primitive double-creatures into modern men and women and their subsequent search for their missing half: \"... when [a lover] ... is fortunate enough to meet his other half, they are both so intoxicated with affection, with friendship, and with love, that they cannot bear to let each other out of sight for a single instant.\" ===Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque=== The classical conception of love's arrows were elaborated upon by the Proven\u00e7al troubadour poets of southern France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and became part of the European courtly love tradition. In particular, a glimpse of the woman's eyes was said to be the source of the love dart: In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a basilisk. Giovanni Boccaccio provides one of the most memorable examples in his Il Filostrato, where he mixes the tradition of love at first sight, the eye's darts, and the metaphor of Cupid's arrow:According to Nathaniel Edward Griffin: \"In the description of the enamorment of Troilus is a singular blending of the Proven\u00e7al conception of the eyes as the birthplace of love with the classical idea of the God of Love with his bows and quiver...,\" in \"Nor did he (Troilus) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart.\"Boccaccio, Il Filostrato, Canto 1, strophe 29 (translation by Nathaniel Edward Griffin and Arthur Beckwith Myrick). William Shakespeare pays a handsome (posthumous) tribute to Christopher Marlowe, who himself wrote \"Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?\" in his 1598 poem Hero and Leander, by citing him the next year in As You Like It: 'Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: \"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?\"'.Peter Alexander ed., William Shakespeare: The Complete Works (London 1962) p. 273 These images of the lover's eyes, the arrows, and the ravages of \"love at first sight\" continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the Renaissance and Baroque literature, and play an important role in Western fiction and especially the novel, according to Jean Rousset. ==Psychological conceptions== Research has shown two bases for love at first sight. The first is that the attractiveness of a person can be very quickly determined, with the average time in one study being 0.13 seconds. The second is that the first few minutes, but not the first moment, of a relationship have been shown to be predictive of the relationship's future success, more so than what two people have in common or whether they like each other (\"like attracts like\"). Infatuation, not to be confused with love at first sight, is the state of being carried away by an unreasoned passion or assumed love. Hillman and Phillips describe it as a desire to express the libidinal attraction of addictive love,Hillman and Phillips inspired with an intense but short-lived passion or admiration for someone. ==Occurrence in literature and the arts== King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid, 1884, by Edward Burne-Jones, depicts an older tale of love at first sight. ===Biblical references=== *Commentaries on the Bible often view the account of Isaac's first view of Rebekah (Genesis 24:67) as love at first sight. *The same holds for Jacob's first sight of Rachel.Nelson's New Illustrated Bible Commentary ed. Earl Radmacher \u2013 1999 \"29:18, 19 loved Rachel: A rare biblical example of \"love at first sight\" (for his father's similar response to Rebekah read Gen. 24:67). The long seven years of service provides a stunning demonstration of the value Jacob placed on Rachel.\" *In 2 Samuel, King David of Israel observes Bathsheba while bathing \u2013 though there is no mention of \"love\" or \"love at first sight.\" \u2013 and commentators equate this to \"lust at first sight.\"David and Bathsheba: Through Nathan's Eyes Joel Cohen, Paulist Press, May 14, 2007, 113 pp. He seduces her, fathers a child with her, and orders her husband Uriah the Hittite to be placed in the front of the battle, which leads to the death of Uriah. ===Literature=== * The works of Dante Alighieri, an Italian poet of the Middle Ages who wrote many times about Beatrice Portinari; Alighieri had fallen in love with her early in his childhood, and her death in 1290 had a major effect on his life. Beatrice appears as a guide in Alighieri's Divine Comedy. * The Elegy of Lady Fiammetta (c.1345) by Giovanni Boccaccio, describes the ravages of love at first sight on a woman. *Troilus and Criseyde (c.1380s) by Geoffrey Chaucer, depicts the fateful love of Troilus and Criseyde in the final days of the Trojan War. * Orlando Innamorato (1486) by Boiardo, the first sight of the beautiful princess Angelica. * Jerusalem Delivered (1581) by Torquato Tasso, the witch Armida enchants the knights that perceive them. * Romeo and Juliet (c.1595), by William Shakespeare, Romeo falls in love with Juliet when he first sees her. * Sense and Sensibility (1811), by Jane Austen, Col.
