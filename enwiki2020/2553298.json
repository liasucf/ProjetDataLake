    "text": "Joseph Hunter (3 August 1855 - 4 January 1891) was a professional cricketer, who played 143 matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1878 and 1888. Hunter also played five Test matches for England. Born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Hunter, who was one of five brothers, learnt his cricket on the beach at Scarborough and went on to become a first-class wicket-keeper. Although not rated as amongst the best of his contemporaries, he went on Alfred Shaw's tour of Australia in 1884/5, and it was there that he played his five Tests. He was dogged by ill-health, however, and retired from cricket in 1888, when he was replaced as Yorkshire's wicket-keeper by his brother, David. Hunter originally was a stonemason, but went on to become a pub landlord. Hunter died in January 1891 in Rotherham, Yorkshire, aged 35. ==References== ==External links== *CricketArchive page on Joe Hunter *Cricinfo page on Joe Hunter *Brief profile of Joseph Hunter by Don Ambrose *A profile of Joe Hunter by Dave Liverman Category:1855 births Category:1891 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricketers Category:United South of England Eleven cricketers Category:Cricketers from Scarborough, North Yorkshire Category:Players cricketers Category:C.
