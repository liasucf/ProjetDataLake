    "text": "G\u00e2teau Basque (Basque: Etxeko biskotxa; \"cake of the house\") is a traditional dessert from the Northern Basque region of France, typically filled with black cherry jam or pastry cream. G\u00e2teau Basque with cream is more typical in the Southern Basque region of Spain. ==Description== Typically G\u00e2teau Basque is constructed from layers of a wheat flour based cake (a butter-sugar pastry dough, in this case p\u00e2te sabl\u00e9e, not bris\u00e9e) with a filling of either black cherry jam or almond or vanilla pastry cream. It has been argued that only black xapata cherries native to the Basque Country should be used. The type of dough used may vary a little. If butter is warmed before mixing with flour the dough will be called p\u00e2te sucr\u00e9e. If it is cold the mixing process will require more work and the dough is called p\u00e2te sabl\u00e9e (it is crumblier). The resulting textures are a little different but mostly for the initiated taster. The flour used is a soft wheat flour with little mineral content (that is, a refined flour, common pastry/cake flour) The proportion of sugar used also varies. But the principle of this cake is having a soft shortbread-type dough 3 to 6 mm thick filled with an almond pastry cream, also called frangipane, and with a shiny egg-coating. It is traditional to mark a Basque cross on the top if the cake is filled with black cherry jam, or to use a crosshatch pattern on top if filled with pastry cream. ==History== The origins of G\u00e2teau Basque are tied strongly with the town of Cambo-les-Bains, Labourd. It may have originally been made with bread and called bistochak in the 18th century. The fishermen took it out to sea. The first known commercialisation of the cake was by Marianne Hirigoyen in Cambo in the first half of the 19th century. Later editions were flavoured with rum, brought back to France by Basques from the West Indies. The G\u00e2teau Basque Festival (F\u00eate du G\u00e2teau Basque) is organized each year in Cambo-les-Bains. Eguzkia (\"sun\" in Basque), an association to promote quality Basque cake, was founded in France in 1994. There is a museum dedicated to the cake, Le mus\u00e9e du G\u00e2teau Basque, in Sare, Labourd. ==See also== * List of cherry dishes ==References== ==External links== * G\u00e2teau Basque Festival Category:French pastries Category:Basque cuisine Category:Cherry dishes Category:French cakes Category:Almond desserts ",
