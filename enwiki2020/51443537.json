    "text": "Greatest Hits is the first compilation album by American pop group The 5th Dimension, released in 1970 by Soul City. It includes all but two of their charting singles to date: \"Go Where You Wanna Go\", their first Top 20 record in the USA, would appear on the follow-up compilation, The July 5th Album, released later that year, while \"Another Day, Another Heartache\" was not included on either compilation. Greatest Hits and The July 5th Album were the final two album releases for Soul City Records' distribution deal with Liberty Records. The 5th Dimension subsequently signed with Bell Records. In a near- mystical coincidence given the band's name, the album peaked at the #5 position on Billboard's Top 200 Albums chart in the summer of 1970, achieving gold record status. Greatest Hits remained in print until replaced by Bell Records' 1972 compilation album, Greatest Hits on Earth which confirmed The 5th Dimension's enduring popularity by charting at #14 in the year of its release. Greatest Hits on Earth remained in print for decades. Of note: * The version of \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" included here is a shortened version of the 4:49 single release, which was the #1 hit of 1969. It omits the reprise of the first verse. No mention of this being a shortened version of the hit is made on the album cover. * \"The Worst That Could Happen\" was not a hit for The 5th Dimension, as it was not released as a single. Johnny Maestro & The Brooklyn Bridge had a hit with the song in early 1969. However, The 5th Dimension's version came first, released on their album entitled The Magic Garden. * \"The Girls' Song\" is the 5th Dimension's final single release on Soul City and was issued specifically to coincide with this album. Originally appearing on The Magic Garden, the single was the band's least successful in three years, due in part to competing with Bell Records' release of new material. ==Track listing== Side One #\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" #\"The Girls' Song\" #\"Stoned Soul Picnic\" #\"The Worst That Could Happen\" #\"Wedding Bell Blues\" #\"California Soul\" Side Two #\"Up, Up and Away\" #\"Blowin' Away\" #\"Carpet Man\" #\"Workin' On a Groovy Thing\" #\"Paper Cup\" #\"Sweet Blindness\" ==Personnel== *Marilyn McCoo - vocals *Florence LaRue - vocals *Billy Davis, Jr. - vocals *Lamonte McLemore - vocals *Ron Townson - vocals ==Musicians== *Hal Blaine - drums, percussion *Joe Osborn, Larry Knechtel - bass *Jimmy Webb, Larry Knechtel, Jimmy Rowles, Pete Jolly - keyboards *Ray Pohlman, Johnny Rivers, Al Casey, Dennis Budimir, Mike Deasy, Bill Fulton - guitars *Larry Bunker - congas, mallets, percussion Category:The 5th Dimension albums Category:1970 compilation albums Category:Soul City Records (American label) albums Category:Albums recorded at United Western Recorders Category:Albums recorded at Wally Heider Studios ",
