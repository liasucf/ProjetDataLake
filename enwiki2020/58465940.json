In 302 BCE, Cassander planned to transfer the town's population to nearby Phthiotic Thebes but this was prevented by Demetrius Poliorcetes. Its site has tentatively been located at a place called Lichas Kastri. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Achaea Phthiotis ",
