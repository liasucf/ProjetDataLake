She is the K&L; Gates Associate Professor of Ethics and Computational Technologies and Senior Associate Dean for Research in the College of Fine Arts at Carnegie Mellon University. ==Life and career== Steenson is a historian of design, architecture and the history of those concepts alongside cybernetics and artificial intelligence. Her current research focuses on the idea of artificial intelligence and how it's viewed and portrayed in contemporary media and culture. She argues that our ideas of artificial intelligence are outdated and this inhibits peoples' ability to understand what it really is. Her book Architectural Intelligence: How Designers & Architects Created the Digital Landscape, published with Graham Foundation support, combines \"an architectural history of interactivity and an interactive history of architecture.\" Steenson holds a PhD in Architecture from Princeton University, a Master\u2019s in Environmental Design from Yale School of Architecture, and a BA in German from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ==Publications== ===Books=== * Architectural Intelligence: How Designers & Architects Created the Digital Landscape (MIT Press, 2017) * Bauhaus Futures (MIT Press, 2019), co-edited with Laura Forlano & Mike Ananny. ===Articles=== * \"Beyond the Personal and Private: Modes of Mobile Phone Sharing in India,\" The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices (2008) * \"Interfaces to the Subterranean,\" Cabinet 41 (summer 2011) - about postal services and pneumatic tube systems ==References== ==External links== * Personal website Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Architectural design Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Yale School of Architecture alumni Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni Category:American women historians Category:American architectural historians Category:Historians of technology Category:21st-century American historians Category:21st-century American women writers ",
