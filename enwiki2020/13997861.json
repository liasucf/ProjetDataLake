In 1997 Arlo's family opened Eisenbergs Skatepark in Plano, Texas where, every year, they hosted the professional skate competition, the Eisenberg's Showdown at the Hoedown. In 2012, after 15 years of success, the skate park closed down, and was leveled to be replaced with spaces for retail and lofts. Arlo achieved widespread notoriety when Senate produced a line of T-shirts featuring tags that said \u2018Destroy All Girls.\" The tags, Arlo's concept, brought attention from CNN, and launched Senate into the mainstream.
