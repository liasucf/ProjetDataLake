    "text": "The Belarus national basketball team () represents Belarus in international basketball matches, and are controlled by the Belarusian Basketball Federation. They came into existence in 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The national team played in their first official match the following year versus Lithuania. While Belarus doesn't have a long tradition on the international stage, they have competed in the pursuit to qualify for the EuroBasket. Although they have yet to clinch that feat, and are Europe's most populous nation to have never qualified for a major international basketball competition. ==History== ===Prior to independence=== Before 1992 Belarus was occupied by the Soviet Union, with Belarusian born players taking part on the Soviet Union national team. They were one of the more prominent teams internationally during this era. ===Later years=== After Belarus gained independence from the Soviet Union, their first attempt to qualify for the premier European basketball tournament came in 1993. They ultimately came up short in their attempt. For qualification to the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Belarus competed in the 2019 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualiers. They finished with an 1\u20133 record in their preliminary group, but it was enough to advance to the first round of the qualifiers. There they were placed in Group A, and right away the national team was overwhelmed in their first two matches by dominant performances from Slovenia and Montenegro respectively. They eventually notched their first win in the group in a rematch against Slovenia, but to no avail. Belarus finished with an 1\u20135 record and failed to qualify. Belarus later went on to compete in EuroBasket 2021 Pre-Qualifiers, but were eliminated in a heartbreaking match to Denmark, in the third and final pre- qualifying window 69\u201366. ==Competitive record== ===EuroBasket=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|EuroBasket !rowspan=18| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- |1947 to 1991||colspan=4|Part of Soviet Union |- | 1993||colspan=4 rowspan=6|Did not qualify |5||1||4 |- | 1995 |6||2||4 |- | 1997 |10||4||6 |- | 1999 |10||3||7 |- | 2001 |15||6||9 |- | 2003 |16||7||9 |- | 2005||colspan=4|Division B |6||4||2 |- | 2007||colspan=4|Division B |8||5||3 |- | 2009||colspan=4|Division B |10||7||3 |- | 2011||colspan=4|Division B |8||4||4 |- | 2013||colspan=4 rowspan=4|Did not qualify |8||2||6 |- | 2015 |12||6||6 |- | 2017 |6||3||3 |- | 2021 |8||4||4 |- !Total!!0/14!! !! !! !!128!!58!!70 |} ===FIBA World Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|World Cup !rowspan=12| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- |1950 to 1990||colspan=4 rowspan=1|Part of Soviet Union |- | 1994||colspan=4 rowspan=7|Did not qualify |- | 1998 |- | 2002 |- | 2006 |- | 2010 |- | 2014 |- | 2019 |10||2||8 |- | 2023||colspan=4|To be determined |colspan=3|To be determined |- !Total!!0/7!! !! !! !!10!!2!!8 |} ===Olympic Games=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|Olympic Games !rowspan=6| !colspan=3|Qualifying |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- |1948 to 1992||colspan=4 rowspan=1|Part of Soviet Union |- |1996 to 2016||colspan=4 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |- | 2020 |- !Total!!0/7!! !! !! !! !! !! |} ==Team== ===Current roster=== Roster for the EuroBasket 2021 Pre-Qualifiers matches played on 3 to 17 August 2019 against Albania and Denmark. ===Depth chart=== ===Head coach position=== * Aliaksandr Papkou - (2008 \u2013 2009) * Mikhail Feiman - (2010) * Andrei Krivonos - (2011 \u2013 2012) * Ruslan Baidakov - (2013 \u2013 2014) * Du\u0161an Gvozdi\u0107 - (2014) * Aleksander Krutikov - (2015 \u2013 2019) * Rostislav Vergun - (2019 \u2013 present) ==Recent results and upcoming fixtures== ===EuroBasket 2021 Pre-Qualifiers=== ===Second round=== ====Group A==== ===Third round=== ====Group E==== ==See also== *Sport in Belarus *Belarus women's national basketball team *Belarus national under-19 basketball team *Belarus national under-17 basketball team *Soviet Union national basketball team ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Belarus at FIBA site *Belarus National Team - Men at Eurobasket.com *Belarus Basketball Records at FIBA Archive Category:National basketball teams National team Basketball Category:1992 establishments in Belarus ",
