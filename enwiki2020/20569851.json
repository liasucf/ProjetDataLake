Founded before 1280 as Schola Duisburgensis, the school was transformed into a Latin school in 1559, which today's Landfermann-Gymnasium acknowledges as its official founding year. In 1925 it was renamed after Dietrich Wilhelm Landfermann (1800\u20131882), who was head of the school from 1835-1841. == See also == * , minor planet == References == Category:Schools in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Educational institutions established in the 1550s Category:1559 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Duisburg ",
