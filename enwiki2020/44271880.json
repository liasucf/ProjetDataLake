    "text": "The city of Corinth, where the Epistle to the Romans was written in the first century, from the summit of Acrocorinth (2007) Romans 1 is the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle, while he was in Corinth in the mid 50s AD, with the help of an amanuensis (secretary), Tertius, who adds his own greeting in Romans 16:22. records that Paul stayed in Greece, probably Corinth, for three months. Attention has been given to Romans 1:26-27 and the biblical viewpoint on homosexual intercourse. The historically dominant viewpoint is that this verse is a blanket condemnation of both male and female homosexual activity, although this has been increasingly challenged in recent years. As of 2011, the traditional viewpoint remains the majority opinion in critical scholarship. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 32 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Koine Greek are:List of manuscripts \u201eFortsetzung der Liste der Handschriften\u201c Institut f\u00fcr Neutestamentliche Textforschung, Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster.

Moody Smith, Jr. showed that in this verse, by exegesis of Galatians 3:11 (also quoting Habakkuk 2:4), Paul took the ek pisteos with the verb zesetai not by the subject of the sentence, ho dikaios.Smith, D.

Jacob Geerlings), Studies in the History and Text of the New Testament in honor of Kennet Willis Clark, Boyd L. Daniels & M. Jack Suggs, eds., pp. 13-25. This is supported by Qumran interpretation of the text, as well as Paul's contemporaries and more recent commentators, such as Lightfoot.Lightfoot wrote: \"I cannot doubt that ek pisteos is to be taken with zesetai; and not with ho dikaios\". Lightfoot, J.B. Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul, Bibliolife. 2010. p. 250. . ==God's wrath on the Gentiles (1:18\u201332)== The first two verses (18\u201319) function as the \"heading\" for the exposition that runs to , that God's wrath falls on all human beings who turn from God and do not follow the truth of God; a consistent picture of a just God who acts to judge sin in both the Old Testament and New Testament. Paul starts first with God's wrath that comes deservedly on the Gentiles (20\u201332), drawn against the background of the fall of the first human beings in to sin. Several scholars believe verses 18 to 32 (and chapter 2) are a non-Pauline interpolation, but this is a minority position.Percy Neale Harrison, Paulines and Pastorals (London: Villiers Publications, 1964), 80\u201385; Robert Martyr Hawkins, The Recovery of the Historical Paul (Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943), 79-86; Alfred Firmin Loisy, The Origins of the New Testament (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 250; ibid., The Birth of the Christian Religion (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 363 n.21; Winsome Munro, Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter, SNTSMS 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 113; John C.

Walker, Jr., \"Romans 1.18\u20132.29: A Non-Pauline Interpolation?\" New Testament Studies 45, no. 4 (1999): 533\u201352. ===Verses 19\u201320=== :For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made. So they are without excuse. NRSV In verses 19-20, Paul writes about the 'knowledge of God'. This passage gives one of the important statements in the Bible relating to the concept of 'natural revelation': that other than revealing Himself in Christ and in the Scriptures, God reveals Himself to everyone through nature and history, and all human beings have the capacity to receive such revelation because they continue to bear the divine image. It echoes what Paul and Barnabas has said to a crowd in Lystra in : :The living God ... made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them, who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.New King James Version ===The Gospel (Romans 1:20-25)=== Paul begins to explain from verse 18 onwards why the \"gospel\" (, to evangeliou tou Christou) is needed: it is to save humankind, both gentiles and Jews, from the wrath of God (). The wrath of God is explained by Lutheran theologian Heinrich Meyer as \"the affection of a personal God, ... the love of the holy God (who is neither neutral nor one-sided in His affection) for all that is good in its energy as antagonistic to all that is evil\".Meyer's NT Commentary on Romans 1, accessed 4 September 2016 ===Verses 26\u201327=== * \"gave them up\" (also in verse 24; \"gave them over\" in verse 28) is from the Greek word paradidomi, \"hand over\", refers to more than a passive withholding of divine grace on God's part, but as God's reaction to the people who turning from the truth of God and his moral requirements, that is to \"turn them over\" their own gods and sinful ways as well as the consequences of it (verses 23, 25, 27). * \"the due\", \"which was meet\" (KJV) or \"was fitting\" (King James 2000 Bible) (Greek: \u1f14\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9, edei). Equivalent to \"was due\" , which is better, though the word expresses a necessity in the nature of the case - that which must needs be as the consequence of violating the divine law.Vincent, Marvin R., Vincent's Word Studies in the New Testament, 1985. * \"penalty\" or \"recompence\" (KJV) (Greek: \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03af\u03b1\u03bd, antimisthian) Greek concordance and lexicon define this word as: \"a reward, recompense, retribution\";Strong, J.

Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers. 1995. . ====Interpretation==== This passage has been debated by 20th and 21st-century interpreters as to its relevance today and as to what it actually prohibits. Although Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity, some scholars and theologians have argued that the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts. Additional controversy has arisen over the authentic text of the passage, and whether Romans 1:26-27 was a later addition to the text. (And thus not inspired) ====Blanket condemnation view==== This perspective sees Romans 1:26-27 is a blanket condemnation of both male and female homosexual activity enduring to the present day. ====Condemnation of unnatural heterosexual sex and gay sex view==== This perspective sees Romans 1:26 is a blanket condemnation of unnatural heterosexual activity enduring to the present day, such as anal sex, whereas Romans 1:27 is a blanket condemnation of male homosexual activity enduring to the present day. ====Interpolation view==== A minority of scholars have suggested that Romans 1:26-27 is a non- Pauline interpolation. This position can be combined with any of the other perspectives listed in the article.Percy Neale Harrison, Paulines and Pastorals (London: Villiers Publications, 1964), 80\u201385; Robert Martyr Hawkins, The Recovery of the Historical Paul (Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943), 79-86; Alfred Firmin Loisy, The Origins of the New Testament (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 250; ibid., The Birth of the Christian Religion (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 363 n.21; Winsome Munro, Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter, SNTSMS 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 113; John C.

Walker, Jr., \"Romans 1.18\u20132.29: A Non-Pauline Interpolation?\" New Testament Studies 45, no. 4 (1999): 533\u201352. ====Cultural view==== Some have suggested that the condemnation was relative to Paul's own culture, in which homosexuality was not understood as an orientation and in which being penetrated was seen as shameful. ====Pagan ritual view==== Others have suggested that it is a condemnation of pagan rituals. ====Experimental view==== Others suggested that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experiment with homosexual activity.
