In contrast to the hard rock version heard on Sound of the Republic, the Heartattack version is a tekno-metal-hardcore version which is much more listener-friendly than the version found on Sound of the Republic. The Heartattack version also is part of a collection of demo recordings which secured Raised Fist a recording contract. The Heartattack version is listed on the CD packaging and disc art as simply Time Will Let You Go instead of Time Will Let You Go; All Alone, I Break as seen on Sound of the Republic. ==Musicians== * Marco Eronen - Guitar * Daniel Holmberg - Guitar * Matte Modin - Drums * Andreas \"Josse\" Johansson - Bass * Alexander \"Alle\" Hagman - Vocals Category:2006 albums Category:Raised Fist albums Category:Burning Heart Records albums ",
