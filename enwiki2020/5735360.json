It tells the stories of Antero Marques Ara\u00fajo and Maria Emilce Pinto. It participated in the Singapore International Film Festival and the 4th International Kerala Film Festival. ==Plot summary== O Sert\u00e3o das Mem\u00f3rias is a black-and-white film that tells the story of two Sertanejos, the inhabitants of Sert\u00e3o. Maria is the female reincarnation of Jesus, representing the strength of the Sartanejo women. She invites the Beatas (holy women) on a mission of prayer for which they journey through the countryside, witnessing social unrest among the population. Maria meets the hero of the peasants, the strong worker Antero whose history intermingles with hers. Through mythical dreams, visions, and stories heard along their journey, we witness the unfolding of Biblical prophecy in which Old Testament texts mingle with the folktales of the Sert\u00e3o. The film aims to show how people try to find strength in myths, art, and religion when faced with the harsh realities of life. ==External links== * *The documentary at Allmovie.
