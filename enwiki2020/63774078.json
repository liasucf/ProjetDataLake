    "text": "Coins minted by the Durocasses. The Durocasses were a Gallic tribe dwelling around present-day Dreux. == Name == The meaning of the name Durocasses is unclear. The second element -casses may have meant 'hair, hairstyle', perhaps a particular warrior coiffure, or 'tin, bronze (helmet?)'. The city of Dreux, attested as Drocas ca. 930 CE (Drewes in the 12th c.), is named after the Gallic tribe. == Economy == The production of coins by the Durocasses suggests that they benefited from some economic autonomy. Their wealth probably came from tolls collected on the inland water shipping on the Eure river. == References == === Bibliography === * * * * Category:Gauls ",
