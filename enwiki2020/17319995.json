    "text": "An Aviation Division () was a type of formation of the Military Air Forces of the Red Army during the Second World War, the Soviet Air Forces, Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) and Aviation of the Military Naval Fleet, and since 1991 remain major formations within the Military Air Forces of the Russian Federation.p.34, Kozlov Before the start of the Second World War, the aviation divisions formed parts of the Long Range Aviation (13.5% of aircraft), and Frontal Aviation (Military Air Forces of the Military Districts in peacetime; 40.5% of aircraft) of the Red Army Fronts, and units assigned to the Combined Arms Armies as the Army Aviation (43.7% of aircraft). There was also a Forces Aviation (2.3% of aircraft) flying liaison aircraft as part of the Corps and Armies' independent flights and squadrons.Svischev From 1942 the aviation divisions were combined into the Air Armies of the Red Army ground forces, assigned one to each Front, Air Defence Forces (PVO) Armies (including the 1st Fighter Army of the PVO), Soviet Naval Aviation and Aviation of the Reserve of the Supreme Command. In organisational terms the aviation divisions were often combined into the aviation corps or an Air Army. In terms of combat assignment the aviation divisions were divided into the bombardment aviation divisions (BAD), assault aviation divisions (ShAD), fighter aviation divisions (IAD), mixed aviation divisions (usually one to a Combined Arms Army; SmAD) and transport aviation divisions (TAD).pp. 15\u201316, Wagner Postwar, fighter bomber aviation divisions (IBAD or ADIB since 1976) and heavy bomber aviation divisions (TBAD) were formed. In 1956, the assault aviation divisions were converted into other units. The composition of the aviation divisions during wartime was not uniform or constant. Although many divisions begun the war with 3 \u2013 5 aviation regiments, due to the heavy losses suffered in the initial period of the Summer-Autumn Campaign of 1941 (22 June \u2013 4 December), during Operation Barbarossa, from August this was reduced to two with consequent reduction in aircraft from 150\u2013180 to 40\u201350. However, commencing with Autumn 1942 the size of the aviation divisions began to increase again, and some had four aviation regiments, or five in the PVO and mixed divisions. However the number of mixed divisions, and expediency of 1942, was gradually reduced and from 1944 the Frontal Aviation divisions adopted a 3\u20134 regiment structure, with the 3 regiments being the more common occurrence in the bombing divisions with some 100 aircraft while the fighter and assault divisions were issued 124 aircraft. The mission profile was flexible depending on the target, with the aviation division deploying as part of the aviation corps, Air Army or independently, utilising the entire aircraft complement, or by regiments, squadrons, flights and even individual aircraft. Bonn et al. wrote in 2005 that the Soviet Air Forces included 10 basic air divisions at the start of the war, 37 basic air divisions were formed during it, of which only three survived to the end. Seven mixed air divisions existed at the start of the war, and 44 were generated during it. Thirteen were destroyed and disbanded, and the rest converted into other types of divisions. Not a single mixed air division was active at the end of the war. Only one was raised to Guards status, and that, the 1st Guards Mixed Air Division, was converted to the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Division after November 1944. Seven bombardment air divisions were active at the beginning of the war, with 66 created during its course. Twenty-seven of the 66 were destroyed, disbanded, or otherwise converted. Eighteen became Guards divisions. Twenty-two specialist long-range air divisions were created during the war, though all were converted to bomber divisions. Forty-eight ground-attack divisions were formed during the war, of which two were destroyed or disbanded and eighteen which became Guards. Eleven fighter divisions existed at the beginning of the war. A hundred and nine in total were formed, of which eleven were destroyed or disbanded, fifteen converted, and 18 became Guards. ==Soviet aviation divisions during the Second World War== The list below includes divisions of the Long Range Air Force. * 1st Mixed Aviation Division * 1st Ferry Red Banner Aviation Division GVF (Civilian Air Fleet) * 1st Aviation Transport Division GVF * 1st Transport Aviation Division * 1st Stalingrad Long-Range Aviation Division- became 1st Stalingrad Red Banner Bomber Aviation Division * 1st Night Heavy Bomber Aviation Division * 1st School Bomber Aviation Division * 2nd Mixed Aviation Division * 2nd Special Purpose Aviation Division * 3rd Bombardment Aviation Division * 3rd Long-Range Aviation Division * 3rd Special Red Banner Communications Aviation Division GVF * 4th Mixed Aviation Division \u2013 became 4th Shock Army aviation 22 February 1942 * 5th Mixed Aviation Division \u2013 disbanded 18 February 1942 * 6th Mixed Aviation Division \u2013 at outbreak of war in Baltic Special Military District, suffered heavy losses in initial German attack, became 48th Army aviation 11 August 1941; reformed immediately and disbanded 11 February 1942 * 7th Mixed Aviation Division \u2013 at outbreak of war in Baltic Special Military District, suffered heavy losses in initial German attack, became 3rd Shock Army aviation 22 February 1942 * 8th Mixed Aviation Division * 8th Bombardment Aviation Division * 9th Mixed Aviation Division \u2013 Served with the Western Special Military District at the outbreak of war, comprising the 13th, 14th, 124th, 126th, 128th, and 129th Fighter Aviation Regiments.
