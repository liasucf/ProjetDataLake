It gives you an eerie feeling of familiarity. However, the scriptwriters here are Udayakrishna and Siby K Thomas, who have managed to churn out profitable flicks by showcasing stupid villains, strained relations and romantic comedies.\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movie- reviews/Ivan-Maryadaraman/movie-review/46814322.cms The critic at NowRunning gave this film a rating of 2/5 stating \"Measure it by any yardstick, and I'd still maintain that 'Ivan Maryadaraman' is certainly not my cup of tea. For that matter, neither is the Telugu original that it blatantly admits to have been inspired from.\" The film was a flop at the box office.http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/16016/malayalam/ivan- maryadaraman/5044/review/ ==References== ==External links== * * http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/16016/malayalam/ivan-maryada-raman/index.htm Category:Indian films Category:Malayalam remakes of Telugu films Category:2010s Malayalam-language films ",
