Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Wildcats were led by sixth-year head coach Neil McCarthy and played their home games on campus at Dee Events Center in Ogden, Utah. In an usually subpar season, the Wildcats were overall in the regular season and in conference play, tied for fifth place. Weber State had appeared in the first five finals of the conference tournament and won the last three, but this year they did not even qualify for the four-team bracket. The Wildcats finished the regular season on a high note, with a three-game winning streak to avoid twenty losses; they also upset league champion Idaho earlier in February ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference \u2013 Weber State Wildcats: 1980\u201381 basketball season Category:Weber State Wildcats men's basketball seasons Weber State ",
