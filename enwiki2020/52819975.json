    "text": "The European qualifying competition for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup was a women's football competition that determined the eight UEFA teams joining the automatically qualified hosts France in the final tournament. Apart from France, 46 of the remaining 54 UEFA member national teams entered the qualifying competition, with Andorra making their World Cup debut and Kosovo making their competitive debut. ==Format== The qualifying competition consists of three rounds: *Preliminary round: The 16 lowest-ranked teams are drawn into four groups of four teams. Each group is played in single round-robin format at one of the teams which are pre-selected as hosts. The four group winners and the best runners-up (not counting results against the fourth-placed team) advance to the qualifying group stage. *Qualifying group stage: The 35 teams (30 highest-ranked teams and five preliminary round qualifiers) are drawn into seven groups of five teams. Each group is played in home-and-away round-robin format. The seven group winners qualify directly for the final tournament, while the four best runners-up (not counting results against the fifth-placed team) advance to the play-offs. *Play-offs: The four teams play two knockout rounds of home-and-away two-legged matches to determine the last qualified team from UEFA. ===Tiebreakers=== In the preliminary round and qualifying group stage, teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss), and if tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria are applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (Regulations Articles 13.01, 13.02, and 15.01): #Points in head-to- head matches among tied teams; #Goal difference in head-to-head matches among tied teams; #Goals scored in head-to-head matches among tied teams; #(Qualifying group stage only) Away goals scored in head-to-head matches among tied teams; #If more than two teams are tied, and after applying all head-to- head criteria above, a subset of teams are still tied, all head-to-head criteria above are reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams; #Goal difference in all group matches; #Goals scored in all group matches; #(Qualifying group stage only) Away goals scored in all group matches; #(Preliminary round only) Penalty shoot-out if only two teams have the same number of points, and they met in the last round of the group and are tied after applying all criteria above (not used if more than two teams have the same number of points, or if their rankings are not relevant for qualification for the next stage); #Disciplinary points (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points); #UEFA coefficient for the preliminary round or qualifying group stage draw. To determine the best runner-up from the preliminary round and the four best runners-up from the qualifying group stage, the results against the teams in last place (fourth place in preliminary round and fifth place in qualifying group stage) are discarded. The following criteria are applied (Regulations Articles 13.03 and 15.02): #Points; #Goal difference; #Goals scored; #(Qualifying group stage only) Away goals scored; #Disciplinary points; #UEFA coefficient for the preliminary round or qualifying group stage draw. In the play-offs, the team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs qualifies for the final tournament. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e., the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e., if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out (Regulations Article 17.01). ==Schedule== The qualifying matches are played on dates that fall within the FIFA Women's International Match Calendar. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Stage !FIFA International Dates |- |Preliminary round |6\u201311 April 2017 |- |rowspan=8|Qualifying group stage |11\u201319 September 2017 |- |16\u201324 October 2017 |- |20\u201328 November 2017 |- |15\u201323 January 2018 |- |26 February \u2013 6 March 2018 |- |2\u201310 April 2018 |- |4\u201312 June 2018 |- |27 August \u2013 4 September 2018 |- |rowspan=2|Play-offs |1\u20139 October 2018 |- |5\u201313 November 2018 |} ==Entrants== The teams were ranked according to their coefficient ranking, calculated based on the following: *UEFA Women's Euro 2013 final tournament and qualifying competition (20%) *2015 FIFA Women's World Cup final tournament and qualifying competition (40%) *UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying competition (40%) The 30 highest-ranked teams entered the qualifying group stage, while the 16 lowest-ranked teams entered the preliminary round.
