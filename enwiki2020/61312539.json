    "text": "Nord\u00f8yvegen () is a planned road project that will connect the northern islands of Haram Municipality and Sand\u00f8y Municipality to the mainland in M\u00f8re og Romsdal county, Norway. The project includes crossing four fjords with tunnels and bridges and upgrading and re-routing roads on the islands to meet national standards. The project will replace several ferry crossings and will cost an estimated . It will provide a faster, ferry-free connection to the mainland for the approximately 3,000 residents of the islands. Map of the project This project will connect a total of seven islands to the mainland using two existing bridges and by building three new bridges, a causeway using fill, and three undersea tunnels. The islands, from north to south, are Finn\u00f8ya, Har\u00f8ya, Fj\u00f8rtofta, Skul\u00f8ya, Harams\u00f8ya, Hest\u00f8ya, and Leps\u00f8ya. The new construction includes: *The Leps\u00f8y Bridge, Lauv\u00f8y Bridge, and Hamnaskjersund Bridge will connect the mainland to the island of Leps\u00f8ya and to the small island of Hest\u00f8ya. The three bridges will be part of a long causeway built with fill in the rather shallow water. A roundabout will be built part-way between the mainland and the two islands. *The long Haramsfjord Tunnel will connect the island of Harams\u00f8ya to the small island of Hest\u00f8ya and the bridge network connecting to the mainland and Leps\u00f8ya. *The long Nogvafjord Tunnel will connect the island to Fj\u00f8rtofta to the island of Skul\u00f8ya (which is already connected to Harams\u00f8ya island by a bridge). *The long Fj\u00f8rtoftfjord Tunnel will connect the island of Har\u00f8ya to the island of Fj\u00f8rtufta. Har\u00f8ya is already connected to the island of Finn\u00f8ya by a bridge. ==References== Category:Proposed roads in Norway Category:Proposed road infrastructure Category:Road bridges in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Road tunnels in M\u00f8re og Romsdal ",
