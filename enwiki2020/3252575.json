Sorrenti performs nationally and internationally. He performs at sports hospitality, charity events, corporate events, club venues and private parties. He performs, MCs, and facilitates at around 200 events per year. ==Career== Whilst studying Architecture at Sydney University, he played rugby union and featured heavily in the acclaimed Architecture Revues over many years. It was here and at the newly opened Sydney Comedy Store that Sorrenti cut his teeth as a performer. In the late 1980s Sorrenti lived and worked as a stand up comic in New York City. Spotted by MTV he became the host of the national Big Blank Show, a live variety/video show which aired nightly from Mon-Thurs. Vince Sorrenti has appeared on virtually every variety show on Australian TV over the last 3 decades. He hosted the game show Let's Make a Deal in 1990. In recent years he has appeared on Australian Celebrity Apprentice, Skating on Thin Ice, Wide Open Road, 20 to 1, Studio 10, and many others. Vince Sorrenti has co-written 2 films. The first was the publicly funded training film entitled No Laughing Matter (1991). It focused on global environmental sustainability and Sorrenti played all 7 characters in the film. He was nominated for awards at the Berlin and New York film festivals and was Awarded Best Training Film at Berlin Film Awards. In the same year he co wrote with Larry Buttrose a feature film entitled Gino (1994). The screenplay was awarded full funding by the FFC (Film Finance Corporation). It received a limited release and was nominated for an AFI Award (Production Design) Whilst studying Architecture at Sydney University, he played Rugby Union and became a keen advocate of student causes. During this time, on annual retreats to Don Hearn's Health Cabins at Munyana on the New South Wales south coast, his eclectic style of stand-up comedy was born. His 'unbelievable' catch-phrase, the product of firm friendships within the Australian Customs Service, evolved during these sabbaticals. A gregarious raconteur, he also enjoys an occasional quiet beer at his favourite haunt, the Star Hotel in Milton or fresh shucked oysters from Don Hearn's private lease. Donny was an amiable mentor and Vince was deeply affected by his passing. Each year on the anniversary of his death Vince re-enacts Donny's Saturday night Land Rover drive to Bendalong bottle shop with the pet magpie perched on the steering wheel (apparently) calling the shots. The alacrity of believing a magpie needs chocolates (really for Donny's mistress back at the caravan) amused Vince immensely. Sorrenti has represented many brands over the years. He is currently the face of Tyreright and Allhomes. In August 2018, Sorrenti was announced as a presenter on the Nine Network new travel series Helloworld, which aired on 7 October 2018. Sorrenti premiered in episode 1 as the Italy and France travel reporter. ==Recognition == Vince Sorrenti is a five-time winner of the Mo Award, presented as recognition of excellence in live performance.
