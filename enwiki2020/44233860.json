He founded the Veruela Abbey, the oldest Cistercian monastery in Aragon. == Biography == ===Family=== Pedro de Atar\u00e9s was the son of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, Lord of Aibar, Atar\u00e9s, and Javierrelatre, and grandson of Sancho Ram\u00edrez, Count of Ribagorza, an illegitimate child of King Ramiro I.

According to the Cr\u00f3nica de San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a, written in the 14th century, he had been the preferred candidate of the Aranonese barons but he then alienated them with his haughty behavior at the assembly, and they instead chose the deceased king's brother Ramiro II, until then a monk. === Founder of Veruela Abbey === Veruela Abbey In 1146, Pedro de Atar\u00e9s founded Veruela Abbey (Real Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Veruela), the most ancient Cistercian monastery in Aragon, with a donation, also confirmed by his mother, to the abbot of the Escaladieu Abbey in France.
