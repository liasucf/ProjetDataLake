    "text": "R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in was a King of Leinster following Brandub mac Echach (died 605).The Book of Leinster gives him a reign of 10 years as K.of Leinster There were two men named R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in active in Leinster in the early seventh century and confusion exists as to which one was king. Some later sources confuse the two R\u00f3n\u00e1ns, but historian Francis John Byrne notes that the earliest sources do not.Francis J.Byrne, Irish Kings, p. 137. ==U\u00ed Cheinnselaig king== The first was R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in (died 624)all dates per The Chronology of the Irish Annals, Daniel P. McCarthy He was King of the U\u00ed Cheinnselaig and was the son of Colm\u00e1n mac Cormaicc of the Sil Chormaic sept.Byrne, Irish Kings, table 10. The historian Francis John Byrne believes he was the one who was King of Leinster. His death is mentioned in both the Annals of Tigernach and the Annals of Ulster.Annals of Ulster AU 624.1; Annals of Tigernach AT 625.1. The later Leinster king Crundm\u00e1el Erbuilc mac R\u00f3n\u00e1in (died 656) was his son. Other sons were Blathmac (died 658) and Cummascach, a King of U\u00ed Cheinnselaig. He was succeeded as king of U\u00ed Cheinnselaig by Crundm\u00e1el Bolg Luatha mac \u00c1edo (died 628). ==U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge king== The second R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in (died 613) belonged to the U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge and was the son of Colm\u00e1n M\u00e1r mac Coirpri.Byrne, Irish Kings, table 9. The Annals of Tigernach includes his death obit with the title King of Laigin.Annals of Tigernach, AT 613.4. These annals interpolated dates for some Leinster kings in this period from the king lists. ==Fingal R\u00f3n\u00e1in saga== R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in of the U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge appears in the Fingal R\u00f3n\u00e1in (The Kinslaying of R\u00f3n\u00e1n), also known as Aided M\u00e1ele Fothartaig meic R\u00f3n\u00e1in (The Killing of M\u00e1el Fothartaig mac R\u00f3n\u00e1in), a Middle Irish language verse tale of the 10th century. The story survives in the Book of Leinster. The protagonist of the tale is named R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac \u00c1edo, but genealogies have R\u00f3n\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in as the father and killer of M\u00e1el Fothartaig.A certain R\u00f3n\u00e1n Crach mac \u00c1edo D\u00edbchine of the U\u00ed M\u00e1il of Leinster existed at this time as well. Professor Dan Wiley notes: \"After R\u00f3n\u00e1n's death, his line of the family became extinct. Subsequent U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge kings of Leinster all trace descent from his brother F\u00e1el\u00e1n mac Colm\u00e1in.\"Dan M. Wiley, \"Fingal R\u00f3n\u00e1in\" , The Cycles of the Kings. According to the saga, R\u00f3n\u00e1n's first wife was Eithne ingen Chummascaig by whom he had a son named M\u00e1elfothartaig. On Eithne's death he remarried to the daughter of Eochaid Iarlaithe (d. 666) of D\u00e1l nAraide. The new queen was very young and attempted to seduce her stepson. So Maelfothartaig went into voluntary exile in Scotland to avoid this. Eventually he returned home but the queen continued her advances which were refused and she tricked the king into having his son murdered. ==Notes== ==See also== *Kings of Leinster ==References== * Annals of Ulster at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * Annals of Tigernach at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * Byrne, Francis John (2001), Irish Kings and High-Kings, Dublin: Four Courts Press, * Book of Leinster,Rig Laigin at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * MacKillop, James, A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology.
