    "text": "Job for a Cowboy is an American death metal band from Glendale, Arizona. Formed in 2003, the band's debut album Genesis was released in 2007, peaking at No. 54 on the US Billboard 200 and selling 13,000 copies in its first week of release. The second album, 2009's Ruination, sold 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week to debut at position No. 42 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band comprises vocalist Jonny Davy, guitarists Tony Sannicandro and Al Glassman and bassist Nick Schendzielos. Davy is the only remaining founding member. The band has played in international music festivals, including Sounds of the Underground, Download Festival, Mayhem Festival, Summer Slaughter, Graspop Metal Meeting, and Wacken Open Air. ==History== ===Formation and Doom EP (2003\u20132006)=== Job for a Cowboy was founded in Glendale, Arizona, during December 2003 by vocalist Jonny Davy, guitarists Ravi Bhadriraju and Andrew Arcurio, bassist Chad Staples, and drummer Andy Rysdam when the band members were no older than 15 and 16. In 2004, they created a MySpace profile, posted songs online, and immediately began to connect with several worldwide fans. Later that year, Staples and Rysdam left Job for a Cowboy and were replaced by Brent Riggs and Elliott Sellers, respectively, as bassist and drummer. Traffic to the band's MySpace profile increased exponentially in late 2005 when the band released their first EP, Doom. The EP attracted the attention of Arizona independent label King of the Monsters, who distributed the disc after an initial self-released pressing by the band. The EP release helped the band win the award for Best Metal Band at the Third Annual Arizona Ska Punk Awards Ceremony in Phoenix, Arizona. Job for a Cowboy extensively promoted their EP, including three performances on the Sounds of the Underground tour. By the end of the year, the band obtained professional management and signed a deal with Metal Blade Records, who reissued Doom with a bonus track. During the same year, 2006, Arcurio left the band and Bobby Thompson joined the group. While Job for a Cowboy was writing material for their first full-length album, Sellers announced that he was leaving the band to go back to school immediately after recording the album. In search of a permanent drummer, the band then posted a bulletin on Blabbermouth.net, which was seen by Jon \"The Charn\" Rice. He made a video of himself, posted it on YouTube, and sent the link to the band. Soon after, Rice joined the band. ===Genesis (2007\u20132008)=== Guitarist Al Glassman, who was originally the guitarist for Despised Icon, joined Job for a Cowboy in late 2008. In March 2007, Job for a Cowboy completed their debut full-length album, Genesis. It was recorded at Blue Light Audio Media in Phoenix, Arizona, with producer Cory Spotts. It was mixed by Sabbat guitarist Andy Sneap. Released on May 15, the album peaked at No. 54 on the Billboard 200 and sold nearly 13,000 copies in its first week, which made Genesis the highest-charting heavy metal debut since Slipknot's 1999 debut album. The album received generally positive reviews, with Kerrang! magazine saying, \"an album that quite literally obliterates everyone else currently residing within the death and grind scenes\" and \"one of the year's most essential metal purchases.\" In June 2007, the band performed at the Download Festival in Donington Park, England. The group also played at the Sounds of the Underground festival along with Amon Amarth, Chimaira, Gwar, and Shadows Fall. In October, Job for a Cowboy co- headlined the 2007 Radio Rebellion Tour, teaming up with Behemoth, Gojira, and Beneath the Massacre. The band featured on the 2008 Gigantour with headliners Megadeth, Children of Bodom, In Flames, and High on Fire. In addition, they confirmed for a number of festivals during 2008, including Wacken Open Air in Germany and a second appearance at England's Download Festival. Job for a Cowboy embarked on a U.S. headlining tour in November and December 2008 with supporting acts Hate Eternal and All Shall Perish. In 2008, Job for a Cowboy once again won the award for Best Metal Band at The Arizona Ska Punk Awards, and took home the award again the next year at the 2009 Awards Ceremony. In late 2008, guitarist Ravi Bhadriraju left Job for a Cowboy to return to school because he wanted to pursue a more rewarding career in the medical field. He was replaced with former Despised Icon guitarist Al Glassman. ===Ruination and Gloom (2009\u20132011)=== On May 1, 2009, the band announced that they had completed recording their second studio album, Ruination, at AudioHammer studios in Sanford, Florida, with producer Jason Suecof.
