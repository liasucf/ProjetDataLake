    "text": "Delphi Lawrence (23 March 1926 - 11 April 2002) was an English actress. She was educated at Halidon House School in Slough, Berkshire whilst living in Colnbrook. Of Hungarian ancestry, Lawrence trained as a concert pianist before becoming an actress. She made her first film in 1952 and over the next decade established a following in British films. She graduated to lead roles, but almost exclusively in \"B\" films. In 1962 she starred in episode 11 of The Saint (\"The Man Who Was Lucky\") as Cora. One of her other prominent TV roles was around the same time, in 1961, where she played the countess in episode 6 of the TV historical adventure series Sir Francis Drake (\"The English Dragon\"). In 1966 she moved to the United States where she began to appear in films and television, and settled there. By the end of the 1960s her roles began to decrease in frequency and importance and in 1973 she retired. She made a brief return in 1975, in the Broadway production of The Constant Wife playing the sister of Ingrid Bergman's character. In 1990 she appeared as Vera Charles in the national tour of Mame starring Juliet Prowse. ==Filmography== * Blood Orange (1953) - Chelsea, a model * Murder by Proxy (1954) - Linda (uncredited) * Meet Mr. Callaghan (1954) - Effie Perkins * Duel in the Jungle (1954) - Pan American Girl * Barbados Quest (1955) - Jean Larson * The Gold Express (1955) - Pearl * Doublecross (1956) - Anna Krassin * The Feminine Touch (1956) - Pat * It's Never Too Late (1956) - Mrs. Madge Dixon * Strangers' Meeting (1957) - Margot Sanders * Just My Luck (1957) - Miss Daviot * Blind Spot (1958) - Yvonne Dubar * The Son of Robin Hood (1958) - Sylvia * Too Many Crooks (1959) - Secretary * The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959) - Margo Philippe * Danger Man (1960-1962) - Stella Delroy View from the Villa * Cone of Silence (1960) - Joyce Mitchell * The Greeneyed Elephant (1960) (Danish title: Elefanter p\u00e5 loftet) - Lisa * Beat Girl (1960) - Greta (uncredited) *The Fourth Square (1961) - Nina Stewart * Seven Keys (1961) - Natalie Worth * The Square Mile Murder (1961) - Mrs. Possner * On the Run (1963) - Yvonne * The List of Adrian Messenger (1963) - Airport Stewardess (uncredited) * Dawn Rendezvous (Ford Corsair launch film) (1963) - Miss Lawrence * Farewell Performance (1963) - Janice Marlon * Der Fall X701 (1964) - Joan Overton * Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965) - 1st Mother * The Last Challenge (1967) - Marie Webster * Cops and Robbers (1973) - Rich Lady (final film role) ==References== ==Sources== * Quinlan, David.
