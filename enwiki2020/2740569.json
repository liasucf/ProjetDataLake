He was educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford and served as a lieutenant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. ==Career== Patrick Wolrige-Gordon was elected Conservative and Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for East Aberdeenshire in November 1958 at a by-election when he was still an undergraduate. He was at the time the youngest MP. He married Anne Howard, daughter of Peter Howard, in 1962 and became involved through Howard in Frank Buchman's Moral Re-Armament (MRA) movement, which attracted much negative comment. He fell out with his local association over the matter and was defeated in the February 1974 general election by the Scottish National Party candidate Douglas Henderson. ==Honours== He was appointed a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights in 1966. ==Family== Wolrige-Gordon had a son and two daughters. His twin brother John (1935\u20132007) changed his name to John MacLeod of MacLeod to take up the role of 29th Clan Chieftain, which he inherited from their grandmother. ==External links== * *Obituary for John MacLeod, brother of Patrick Wolrige-Gordon Category:1935 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Scottish Conservative Party MPs Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford Category:UK MPs 1955\u20131959 Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders officers Category:Unionist Party (Scotland) MPs ",
