The band's main community is D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119, the only populated place on Great Bear Lake. All of its powers and responsibilities were assumed by the D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 Got'\u0131\u0328n\u0119 Government in 2016, but the federal government still recognizes the band for Indian Act enrollment purposes. The D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 First Nation is a member of the Sahtu Dene Council. Under the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, it shares title to 41,437 square kilometers of land in the Sahtu Region. In addition to this regional agreement, the band also ratified a D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 Final Self-Government Agreement in 2014. The resulting D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 Got'\u0131\u0328n\u0119 Government began operating on September 1, 2016, assuming all previous responsibilities of the D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 First Nation, D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119 Land Corporation, and the Charter Community of D\u00e9l\u0131\u0328n\u0119. This merger of a First Nation and a municipality is unique in the Northwest Territories. With Parks Canada, the band jointly governs Saoy\u00fa-\u0294ehdacho, Canada's largest National Historic Site. ==References== Category:First Nations in the Northwest Territories Category:Dene governments ",
