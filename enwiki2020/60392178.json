    "text": "Rosario de los Milagros Prieto P\u00e9rez (Dominican Republic, April 13, 1942), more well known as Rosario Prieto, is an actress of Venezuelan television who has stood out in the genre of telenovelas. Now 76, she is especially celebrated for her work in the telenovela Venevisi\u00f3n Amor secreto as the character Coromoto. == Career == When she was one and a half years old, Rosario Prieto arrived in Venezuela with her parents, who were political refugees. Despite being born in the Dominican Republic, the actress identifies as Venezuelan. Jorge Citino was the choreographer of that program in 1959 and, in his arduous search for all the academies of Caracas to find a classical dancer, he selected Rosario Prieto to be part of \"El Show de Renny.\" One day, when Rosario Prieto was dancing on the stage of \"El Show de Renny,\" she met Chucho Sanoja, director of the RCTV orchestra. She fell in love married him. She then began to explore the world of singing, since she was part of the orchestra led by her husband and studied with master Eduardo Lanz. Two years after being married, Rosario Prieto had her first daughter named Mar\u00eda Eugenia Sanoja Prieto, and later, three sons who died. As a member of the RCTV orchestra, which had many contracts with international record companies, Rosario Prieto had the opportunity to travel to different countries. In some nations such as Mexico, the United States and Spain, she studied as a listener in the performing arts schools. While she traveled, Prieto gained interest in acting. So she decided to take formal classes in Venezuela with Professor Luis Salazar, the founder of a school of acting training in the country. Rosario Prieto debuted as an actress on RCTV in the mid-1960s. She then traveled to the United States where she studied choreography and, upon returning to Venezuela, worked for thirteen years on the newly opened CVTV channel. During this time, the actress had her second daughter, Carolina Prieto de Fern\u00e1ndez. In 1979, she returned to RCTV and worked uninterrupted until the day of its closure, both in dramatic productions and in different genres: humor, competitions, varieties, and more. In addition to all this, Rosario Prieto has a training school of artistic talent called \"Buscando el Actor que todos llevamos dentro\", which has functioned in Caracas and in several other regions of the country. She has taught acting workshops on television, voice and diction, text analysis and body language, as well as various talks on empirical and spiritual content. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Program !Character !Channel |- |1973 |Mily |Diana Tormento |VTV |- |1980 |Rosa Campos, Provinciana |Elena |RCTV |- |1982 |La Guajirita | |RCTV |- |1983 |Marta y Javier |Marg\u00f3 Liz\u00e1rraga |RCTV |- |1983 |Leonela |Se\u00f1ora de Rodr\u00edguez |RCTV |- |1985 |Topacio |Do\u00f1a Pura |RCTV |- |1985 |Rebeca |Teodora |RCTV |- |1986 |Mansi\u00f3n de Luxe |Margarita Luchester |RCTV |- |1986 |Atr\u00e9vete |Dar\u00eda Sep\u00falveda |RCTV |- |1987 |Mi amada Beatriz |Miguelina (\"Ma\u00edta\") |RCTV |- |1988 | La Muchacha Del Circo |Herminia Villas |RCTV |- |1989 |Rub\u00ed rebelde |Dorila |RCTV |- |1989 |Amanda Sabater | |RCTV |- |1990 |De mujeres |Leticia |RCTV |- |1991 |El desprecio | |RCTV |- |1993 |De oro puro |Fausta G\u00f3mez |RCTV |- |1994 |Alejandra |Mar\u00eda de Bustamante |RCTV |- |1994 |Pura sangre |Estacia Brice\u00f1o |RCTV |- |1996 |Los amores de Anita Pe\u00f1a | |RCTV |- |1997 |Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles | |RCTV |- |1999 |Mujer secreta |Evencia de Romero |RCTV |- |1999 |Mari\u00fa |Albertina Navarrete |RCTV |- |2000 |Viva la Pepa | |RCTV |- |2001 |A calz\u00f3n quita'o |Do\u00f1a Celeste de Contreras |RCTV |- |2002 |Trapos \u00edntimos |Eulalia Pinz\u00f3n |RCTV |- |2004 |\u00a1Qu\u00e9 buena se puso Lola! |Luz Elena Aguirre |RCTV |- |2005 |Amor a palos |Zoila Revueltas |RCTV |- |2007 |Camaleona |Numidia Valecillos |RCTV |- |2008 |Nadie me dir\u00e1 c\u00f3mo quererte |Gregoria Salas |RCTV |- |2009 |Esto es lo que hay |Do\u00f1a Carmen Gonz\u00e1lez |RCTV |- |2012 |Teresa en tres estaciones |Petra Bautista |TVes |- |2015 |Amor secreto |Coromoto |Venevisi\u00f3n |- |2016 |Locos y Peligrosos | |Movie |- |2017 |M\u00e1s vivos que nunca |Paloma |Movie |} == References == Category:Dominican Republic emigrants to Venezuela Category:Venezuelan television actresses Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Venezuelan telenovela actresses Category:20th-century Venezuelan actresses Category:21st-century Venezuelan actresses ",
