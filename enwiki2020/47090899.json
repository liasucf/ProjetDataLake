    "text": "The Battle of Vihiers (18 July 1793) was a battle between Royalist and Republican French forces at Vihiers during the War in the Vend\u00e9e. After the Republican division under Jacques-Marie Pilote La Baroli\u00e8re advanced into the heart of the revolt area, it was attacked by the Vendeans under Dominique Piron de La Vienne and routed. The advance guard under Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou held its ground for a long time, but many Republican units from the main body quickly took to their heels. The Republican cavalry under Louis-Nicolas Davout covered the disorderly retreat. The Royalists suffered about 1,000 killed and wounded but inflicted 2,000 killed and wounded on their enemies as well as capturing 3,000 soldiers and 25 artillery pieces. ==References== * * * Category:Battles involving France Category:Conflicts in 1793 Category:Battles of the War in the Vend\u00e9e Category:Battles in Pays de la Loire Category:History of Maine-et-Loire Category:1793 in France ",
