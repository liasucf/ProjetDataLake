    "text": "Earl Denman was a Canadian mountaineer who attempted to summit Mount Everest in 1947. His attempt was very different from the large-scale efforts by British mountaineers around the same time. He had little experience, having only climbed the smaller Virunga mountains in East Africa before this expedition. He did not have much money, equipment, or fuel, and did not enter Tibet with permission. Two Sherpas (one of whom was Tenzing Norgay, later to make the first ascent of Everest) joined his attempt. Norgay later said that he knew Denman had little chance of succeeding, but that he agreed to join Denman because \"the pull of Everest was stronger for me than any force on earth.\" Denman and the two Sherpas reached before a storm compelled them to abort the attempt and turn back. ==References== * Alone to Everest, by Earl Denman * Everest, by Walt Unsworth * Man of Everest, by Tenzing Norgay and James Ramsey Ullman * ' 'Into Thin Air, beginning of Chapter 7, by Jon Krakauer == External links == *Everest History (1947) Category:Canadian mountain climbers Category:Year of birth missing ",
