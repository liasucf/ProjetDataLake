Black & Grey has had one self-titled EP released in 2013, and three singles, Goodbye Misery, What Makes You Who You Are, and Pretty Little Nightmare. They currently are working with producer Jamie Foulds for a full-length LP to be released in 2016. ==History== Black & Grey was formed in 2012 by Brandon Johnson of Potlotek, Nova Scotia and Michael Mellen, of Membertou, Nova Scotia. Their current line up consists of Brandon Johnson on vocals and rhythm guitar, Daniel Paul on the drums, Michael Mellen on leads, and Tyler Mellen on bass. Front-man Brandon Johnson has collaborated with artists such as Gordie Sampson, Steven MacDougall, and Dave Sampson. He also performed in Mi'kmaq Nation Halifax, and appeared on The Candy Show on APTN. His lyrics are not always black & white, often dealing with the grey area between the lines, hence the name Black & Grey. Their debut song Goodbye Misery was released November 5, 2012 as a single on iTunes. Goodbye Misery speaks out against bullying and was dedicated to Amanda Todd. Goodbye Misery was heard throughout the Maritimes and on local radio stations. The proceeds from iTunes purchases go to Leave Out Violence, a foundation based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Black & Grey's second single \"What Makes You Who You Are\" was first performed at the Idle No More UNITY Rally and Concert on January 17, 2013 in Truro, Nova Scotia, and the studio version was released online for download on February 11, 2013. On March 14, 2013, the band released the music video for \"Goodbye Misery\" which was filmed at Sydney Academy High School by Matthew Ingraham, founder of Renegade Entertainment. Like the song, the video was inspired by the Amanda Todd story, and starred students of Sydney Academy. Shaylin MacDonald played the role of Amanda Todd in the music video. Black & Grey have performed at events including The Giant 101.9 Monster Ball (2012), ECMA Aboriginal Artist Showcase (2013), Stronger Than Steel (2013), Autism Society of Cape Breton's Headlining Band for their Fundraiser Autism Rocks for 2 years, ECMA Nominated Aboriginal Artist of the Year (2014\u201316), Music Nova Scotia Nominated Aboriginal Artist (2014\u201315), APTN's Aboriginal Day Live 2014, Cape Breton Screaming Eagles Home Opener (2014), Mi'kmaq Summer Games Headliner 2014, Membertou Trade & Convention Center (2012-2015) frequently, Savoy Theater CBMIC Presented Cape Breton Talent Showcase(2015) and Many More.
