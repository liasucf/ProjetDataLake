    "text": "Jim Crow was a rap group made up of Polow da Don, Cutty Cartel, and Mr. Mo. ==Reactions== Joseph Litman, writing in The Michigan Daily, had a very negative reaction to the group. He wrote: \"Three black men calling themselves \"Jim Crow\" is idiotic because it trivializes the historical implications of the name, especially when they know what it means.\" He also decried the \"misogyny\" and the \"blind consumerism, sexism, and compromised values\" particularly in the lyrics of \"Hot Wheels\". ==Notes== == Discography == === Albums === * Crow's Nest (1999) * Right Quick (2001) === Singles === * Bandits (1999) * That Drama (Baby's Mama) (featuring Jazze Pha, and Too Short) (1999) * Holla at a Playa (featuring Sean Paul of Youngbloodz, and Jazze Pha) (2002) * Hot Wheels !
