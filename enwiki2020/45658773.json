It was established on March 4, 1849 and has no suffragan, but two merged-in eparchial titles. ==Territory and statistics== The archeparchy extends in the central part of Syria, corresponding roughly to the Hama Governorate and Homs Governorate. Its archeparchial see is the city of Homs, where is located the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace. In Yabrud is located the co-cathedral of Saints Constantine and Helen. It is currently governed by Archeparch Jean-Abdo Arbach, B.C. The territory is divided into 21 parishes and there were 30,000 Melkite Catholics in 2010. ==History== The archeparchy consists of territories that were once three separate ecclesiastical entities: Homs, Hama and Yabrud. When in 1724 the Melkite Greek Catholic Church was established, the three eparchies started gradually merged. The union ultimately came during the patriarchate of Maximos III Mazloum and was contextually erected from eparchy of Homs to Metropolitan Archeparchy on March 4, 1849, as the titles of the Melkite Catholic Archeparchy of Hama and Melkite Catholic Eparchy of Jabrud were formally united with the new Metropolitanate. ==Episcopal ordinaries== ;Metropolitan Archeparchs of Homs * Ignace (mentioned in 1759) * J\u00e9remie (mentioned in 1790) * Gregory Atta (February 20, 1849 - December 3, 1899 deceased) * Flavien Khoury (November 21, 1901 - 1920 resigned), Titular Archbishop of Palmyra of the Greek-Melkites (1920 \u2013 ?) * Basil Khoury (November 20, 1920 - October 25, 1938 deceased), Titular Archbishop of Sergiopolis (1938.10.15 \u2013 death 1941.11.21) * Athanasios Toutoungi (October 1, 1938 - December 5, 1961), previously Superior General of Basilian Alepian Order (B.A.) (1934 \u2013 1940); later Metropolitan Archeparch of Aleppo of the Greek-Melkites (Syria) (1961.12.05 \u2013 1968.03.06), Titular Archbishop of Tarsus of the Greek-Melkites (1968.03.06 \u2013 death 1981.02.20) * Jean Bassoul, Basilian Salvatorian fathers (B.S.)
