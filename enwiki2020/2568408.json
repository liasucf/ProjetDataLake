    "text": "In mathematics, a polymatroid is a polytope associated with a submodular function. The notion was introduced by Jack Edmonds in 1970. It is also described as the multiset analogue of the matroid. ==Definition== Let E be a finite set and f: 2^E\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_+ a non-decreasing submodular function, that is, for each A\\subseteq B \\subseteq E we have f(A)\\leq f(B) , and for each A, B \\subseteq E we have f(A)+f(B) \\geq f(A\\cup B) + f(A\\cap B) . We define the polymatroid associated to f to be the following polytope: P_f:= \\left\\\\{\\textbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}_+^E~|~\\sum_{e\\in U}\\textbf{x}(e)\\leq f(U), \\forall U\\subseteq E\\right\\\\}. When we allow the entries of \\textbf{x} to be negative we denote this polytope by EP_f, and call it the extended polymatroid associated to f. === An equivalent definition === Let E be a finite set and \\textbf{u}, \\textbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^E. We call the modulus of \\textbf{u} to be the sum of all of its entries, and denote \\textbf{u} \\leq \\textbf{v} whenever v_i-u_i\\geq 0 for every i \\in E (notice that this gives an order to \\mathbb{R}_+^E). A polymatroid on the ground set E is a nonempty compact subset P in \\mathbb{R}^E_+, the set of independent vectors, such that: # We have that if \\textbf{v} \\in P, then \\textbf{u} \\in P for every \\textbf{u}\\leq \\textbf{v}: # If \\textbf{u},\\textbf{v} \\in P with |\\textbf{v}|> |\\textbf{u}|, then there is a vector w\\in P such that \\textbf{u}<\\textbf{w}\\leq (\\max\\\\{u_1,v_1\\\\},\\dots,\\max\\\\{u_{|E|},v_{|E|}\\\\}) . This definition is equivalent to the one described before, where f is the function defined by f(A) = \\max\\left\\\\{\\sum_{i\\in A} \\textbf{v}(i)~|~ \\textbf{v} \\in P\\right\\\\} for every A\\subset E. ==Relation to matroids== To every matroid M on the ground set E we can associate the set P_M= \\\\{\\textbf{w}_F~|~ F\\in M\\\\}, where for every i\\in E we have that \\textbf{w}_F(i)=\\begin{cases} 1, & i\\in F;\\\\\\ 0, & i ot \\in F.\\end{cases} By taking the convex hull of P_M we get a polymatroid, in the sense of the second definition, associated to the rank function of M. ==Relation to generalized permutahedra== Because generalized permutahedra can be constructed from submodular functions, and every generalized permutahedron has an associated submodular function, we have that there should be a correspondence between generalized permutahedra and polymatroids. In fact every polymatroid is a generalized permutahedron that has been translated to have a vertex in the origin. This result suggests that the combinatorial information of polymatroids is shared with generalized permutahedra. ==Properties== P_f is nonempty if and only if f\\geq 0 and that EP_f is nonempty if and only if f(\\emptyset)\\geq 0. Given any extended polymatroid EP there is a unique submodular function f such that f(\\emptyset)=0 and EP_f=EP. ==Contrapolymatroids== For a supermodular f one analogously may define the contrapolymatroid :\\left\\\\{w \\in\\mathbb{R}_+^E: \\forall S \\subseteq E, \\sum_{e\\in S}w(e)\\ge f(S)\\right\\\\} This analogously generalizes the dominant of the spanning set polytope of matroids. ==Discrete polymatroids == When we only focus on the lattice points of our polymatroids we get what is called, discrete polymatroids. Formally speaking, the definition of a discrete polymatroid goes exactly as the one for polymatroids except for where the vectors will live in, instead of \\mathbb{R}^E_+ they will live in \\mathbb{Z}^E_+. This combinatorial object is of great interest because of their relationship to monomial ideals. ==References== ;Footnotes ;Additional reading * * * Category:Matroid theory ",
