    "text": "Pink Bubbles Go Ape is the fourth studio album by German power metal band Helloween, released in 1991. It marked the departure of guitarist Kai Hansen, with Roland Grapow replacing him. Musically it was written with a softer, less epic, and sometimes humorous approach, which would be later fully implemented in the band's following album Chameleon (1993). The album contains two singles, which are \"Kids of the Century\" and \"Number One\". \"Kids of the Century\" reached #56 in the United Kingdom. There were some tunes recorded for this album, which were either not featured on it (\"Windmill\") or have never been finished (\"City Cries\"). On the other hand, the track \"Heavy Metal Hamsters\" (supposedly written about the band's former record company) was, according to Michael Weikath, never intended to be on the album, but rather on a B-side of a single. ==Track listing== *M - 12, 13 also appears on the single \"Kids of the Century\". *M - 14, 15 also appears on the single \"Number One\". ==Personnel== *Michael Kiske - vocals, acoustic guitar *Michael Weikath - guitar *Roland Grapow - guitar *Markus Grosskopf - bass *Ingo Schwichtenberg - drums * Keyboards \u2013 Pete Iversen, Phil Nicholas / musicial ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1991) !Peak position |- |Swedish Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |- |Norwegian Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |- |Swiss Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 |- |Austrian Albums Chart |style=\"text- align:center;\"|28 |- |German Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|32 |- |UK Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|41 |- |Dutch Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|84 |} ==References== Category:1991 albums Category:Helloween albums Category:Albums produced by Chris Tsangarides Category:Albums with cover art by Storm Thorgerson ",
