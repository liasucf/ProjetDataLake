Its name comes from the moment when he loudly sighed while looking back and longing for his Granada palaces, and in particular the Alhambra, an act which reportedly moved his mother Aisha to whip him, giving the famous quip \"Yora,yora como mujer,lo que no supiste defender como hombre / Weep,weep like a woman,for that which you will not defend as a man.\" ==External links== *Spanish poem by Aguijarro detailedly describing the ordeal.
