    "text": "Hygrocybe conica, commonly known as the witch's hat, conical wax cap or conical slimy cap, is a colourful member of the genus Hygrocybe (the waxcaps), found across northern Europe and North America. Originally described as Hygrophorus conicus, it may be a complex of closely related and similar species. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described scientifically in 1774 by German polymath Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer, who named it Agaricus conicus. Paul Kummer transferred it to the genus Hygrocybe in 1871. ==Description== Showing some black discolouration The witch's hat is a small mushroom, with a convex to conical yellow-orange to red cap 2 to 5 cm (\u00be-2 inches) in diameter, though very occasionally larger specimens up to 8 or 9 cm (3\u00bd in) diameter are found. It turns black when cut or bruised. ==Distribution and habitat== The witch's hat is widely distributed in grasslands and conifer woodlands across North America, Europe and Asia, as well as Australia and New Zealand, being found in summer and autumn. It is likely that what is currently termed Hygrocybe conica is a complex of closely related species, some of which are suspected of being poisonous. Though Hygrocybe conica occurs in Australia, principally near urban areas, many collections originally assigned to this species are the similar Hygrocybe astatogala. ==Edibility== The edibility or otherwise of Hygrocybe conica is unclear; its small size and being coated in a sticky substance render it of limited palatability anyway. There is a report of poisoning from China in the early part of the 20th century which was allegedly from this species. ==See also== *List of Hygrocybe species ==References== ==Further reading== * F\u00fchrer, Bruce Alexander (2005) A Field Guide to Australian Fungi Bloomings Books, Melbourne, Australia, ==External links== * \"Fungus of the Month for October 2001: Hygrocybe conica, the witch's hat mushroom\" by Tom Volk, TomVolkFungi.net.
