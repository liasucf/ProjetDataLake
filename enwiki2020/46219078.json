Roadside memorial for \"The Travelling Church, 1781\" by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America. Monument erected on hilltop site of historic Gilbert's Creek Church. Memorial tablet to \"The Travelling Church\" on the hilltop monument. The Travelling Church was a large group of pioneering settlers in the late 1700s that emigrated from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, to the Kentucky District of Virginia. It was the largest group that migrated to the area in a single movement. The group was led by the Reverend Lewis Craig, one of three pastor sons of Toliver Craig Sr., and its core was his Baptist congregation. The group of about 600 people arrived at Gilbert's Creek, Kentucky, in December 1781. Other preachers in the Travelling Church were Lewis Craig's younger brother Rev. Joseph Craig and his beloved slave Peter Durrett, who later became a pioneering black minister in Lexington, Kentucky. Lewis Craig's other brother who was a minister, Rev. Elijah Craig, did not come with the rest of the Church, as he remained for a while in Virginia to help James Madison establish constitutional religious liberty assurances before joining the group later. The group's pioneering members were to found many churches (including the first north of the Kentucky River), settlements, and other institutions that continue to this day. ==The group and its journey== Seeking religious freedom and economic opportunity, in 1781 Rev. Lewis Craig led a group numbering \"perhaps five or six hundred\"Thomas D. Clark, \"Traveling Church,\" in The Kentucky Encyclopedia (ed. John E. Kleber; Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1992), 897. people known as \"The Travelling Church\" composed of a core comprised by a majority of the Baptist congregation of Lewis' Upper Spottsylvania church, along with other settlers joining in, to the area of Virginia known as Kentucky County.Not until 1 June 1792 did the cross-Appalachian counties separate from Virginia to form the new state of Kentucky. \"Leaving behind the discrimination against them by the established church in colonial Virginia, they sought fertile soil\"Clark, \"Traveling Church,\" 897. for both physical and spiritual fruitbearing. \"This hardy group...was led by the Rev. Lewis Craig, who saw his flock's trek across the mountains as parallel to that of the Israelites leaving Egypt for Canaan.\"Clyde F. Crews, \"Religion,\" in The Kentucky Encyclopedia (ed. John E. Kleber; Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1992), 764. During the fall- winter of 1781, Craig as Moses and Capt. William Ellis as Joshua led the huge train over the frozen and danger-filled Cumberland Gap with only a little loss of life into the rugged frontier of Kentucky for their Promised Land.Cf. Ranck, Travelling Church, 5\u20136, 30, etc. The emigrants included slaves held by the Craigs and others. They walked down the Great Wagon Road in the Blue Ridge Mountains through present-day Lynchburg, Roanoke and Fort Chiswell, gathering members, before joining the Wilderness Road. They crossed the Appalachians through the Cumberland Gap, continued north up the Wilderness Road, and ultimately settled in central Kentucky, establishing their first church and community at Gilbert's Creek.George Washington Ranck, The Travelling Church: An Account of the Baptist Exodus from Virginia to Kentucky in 1781 under the Leadership of Rev.

This memorial by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the Commonwealth of Kentucky for \"The Travelling Church, 1781\" is also known as State Marker 25 and is located on KY 39/Lancaster Rd, ca. 2.5 miles SE of Lancaster, Garrard Co., KY, 40444; 37.577915, -84.558316. The text from State Marker 25: In search of religious freedom, the Reverend Lewis Craig led his entire congregation of 200 Baptists and 400 other settlers from Spottsylvania County, Virginia, and established them here on Gilbert's Creek. This expedition, guided through the wilderness by Captain William Ellis, was the largest group of pioneers ever to enter the District of Kentucky in a single body. Erected by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 1947.\"25 The Traveling Church, 1781\" in Melba Porter Hay and Thomas H. Appleton Jr., eds., Roadside History: A Guide to Kentucky Highway Markers (Frankfort: Kentucky Historical Society, 2002), 3 Up on the hilltop behind the roadside marker was constructed the fortified blockhouse serving as both a house of worship and a place of defense from Indian attacks. There is also a monument to \"The Travelling Church\" atop that hill on the site of the church fort. On the other side of the current road next to Gilbert's Creek they erected the wooden stockade fort known as Craig's Station, where the settlers lived. This original Travelling Church changed their name to Gilbert's Creek Baptist Church when Rev. Craig and others moved on further north two years later to found other churches and settlements. They are the third-oldest Baptist church in Kentucky and, although moved a short distance from the original site, still continue regular worship today. Other churches founded by Travelling Church members and which still continue today include Forks of Dix River Church (1782), South Elkhorn Christian Church (1783), Clear Creek Baptist Church (1785), First African Baptist Church (ca. 1790), Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church (1791, 1801), Bracken Baptist Church (1793), the Providence church in Madison county, etc. ==Travelling Church members== While a complete list of names for those participating in the Travelling Church exodus and settling in Kentucky is impossible, various names are known. > Old William Marshall preached to them, with their pastor, the first Sunday > after their arrival.
