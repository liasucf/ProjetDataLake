He has been capped for Denmark at youth level. ==Early and personal life== The family of Skipper is originally from Lolland, but he was born and raised in Vestegnen, Greater Copenhagen. When he went to primary school, he skipped second grade which he meant contributed to him becoming mature from an early age. == Club career == === Br\u00f8ndby === Skipper joined Br\u00f8ndby IF aged 4. After playing in the youth of Hvidovre IF for a few years, he rejoined Br\u00f8ndby in the spring of 2013 at under-13 level. In April 2015, Skipper signed his first contract with Br\u00f8ndby, keeping him in the club until 2017. As an under-19 player, German club VfL Wolfsburg showed interest in signing him to their youth academy, but a move never materialised. On 30 November 2019, Br\u00f8ndby announced that Skipper would become a permanent part of the first team in the spring of 2019. Concomitantly, he signed his first professional contract which would keep him in the club until 2021. On 28 July 2019, Skipper made his competitive debut with a start in the Danish Superliga match against OB which ended with a 3-2 win for Br\u00f8ndby. His performance was subsequently praised by pundits. Since his debut in week three of the Danish Superliga, he played each match until Br\u00f8ndby signed free agent Andreas Maxs\u00f8 in mid-September. Despite assuming a new role as a substitute, Skipper was still recognised and lauded by the fans of the club. On 22 January 2020, Skipper signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Br\u00f8ndby, running until 2023. == International career == Skipper has won 2 caps for Denmark at U19 level, and has played multiple matches for national youth teams at different levels. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"3\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Br\u00f8ndby |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"2\"|Superliga |11||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- |2020\u201321 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !11!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!11!!0 |} == References == == External links == * * Anton Skipper at brondby.com * Anton Skipper at dbu.dk Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark under-21 international footballers Category:Denmark youth international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Br\u00f8ndby IF players Category:People from Br\u00f8ndby Municipality ",
