It is currently run as a private secondary school, Castle School Pembrokeshire. ==History== The house was built circa 1860 for Sir Alfred Ernle Montacute-Chatfield. It was designed in a plain Italianate style, on a square plan, with two above-ground storeys and a basement. The interior had an entrance hall with a staircase including barley twist balusters. A servants hall was connected to a basement kitchen via a separate staircase. The house became Grade II listed in 1988. ===Castle School=== In September 2015 a private secondary school of 97 pupils and 23 staff relocated to Sodston Manor. Castle School was founded in 2009 by Harriet Harrison and had previously operated from a primary school building in Cresselly. Sodston Manor was bought for \u00a3270,000 and Harrison spent a further \u00a3230,000 on repairs and refurbishment. When it arrived the school opened a Sixth Form. ==References== ==External links== *Castle School website Category:Grade II listed buildings in Pembrokeshire Category:Narberth, Pembrokeshire Category:Country houses in Pembrokeshire Category:Manor houses in Wales ",
