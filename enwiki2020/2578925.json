He played for three years in the National Basketball Association. ==College career== After attending Padre Anacleto High School in S\u00e3o Paulo, Ara\u00fajo went to the United States to play college basketball, attending Arizona Western College in Yuma, Arizona. In his freshman season (2000\u201301), he averaged 12.1 points and 8.4 rebounds per game.Prospect Profile: Rafael Araujo (Ha-fay-el Ar-RU-joe) Ara\u00fajo later explained that AWC coach Kelly Green gave him $400 to get his visa and establish himself in Yuma, despite coaches being forbidden to do so. As a sophomore, he tallied 17.9 points and 10.7 rebounds per game, leading the Matadors to a 28-3 record and a top ten national ranking among junior colleges. He was named Region Most Valuable Player and 2nd Team NJCAA All-American. At the same time Ara\u00fajo was drafted for the Brazil national basketball team at the 2002 World Championships, as NBA player Nen\u00ea could not attend the tournament. After finishing his junior college career, Ara\u00fajo moved to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah where as a junior (2002\u201303), he averaged 12.0 points and 8.9 rebounds per gameBrigham Young Cougars Statistics - 2002-03 (second in the Mountain West Conference). In his senior season, Ara\u00fajo led BYU in scoring (18.4 points per game), rebounding (10.1 rebounds per game), steals (43 total), and blocked shots (25).Brigham Young Cougars Statistics - 2003-04 He was named Co-Player of the Year in the Mountain West Conference, sharing the honor with Air Force's Nick Welch.Araujo still eligible for MWC tourney He was named 2nd Team NCAA All-American by Basketball Times and Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press. With his size and strength, the 6-foot-11, 295-pound Ara\u00fajo impressed many pro scouts during his senior season. On December 6, 2003, he dominated a tough Oklahoma State team, totaling 32 points and 17 rebounds in BYU's 76-71 upset victory.BYU 76, Oklahoma State 71 He concluded his collegiate career with a 24-point, 12-rebound performance in the Cougars' 80-75 loss to Syracuse in the NCAA Tournament.McNamara drains nine 3s for career-high 43 ==Controversy== During the 2002 World Championships in Indianapolis, Ara\u00fajo tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. He was given a 24-month suspension from international play. He was subsequently found clean during tests while a player at BYU, and the NBA did not test players for steroid use.Deseret Morning News | Araujo finishing steroid suspension Ara\u00fajo explained that the tests went positive because at the time he consumed a dietary supplement containing androstenedione, but he could still play because he was only suspended by FIBA, who does not sanction college basketball. Ara\u00fajo was involved in multiple on-court incidents during his senior season at BYU. On March 6, 2004, Ara\u00fajo was reprimanded by the Mountain West Conference (MWC) for hitting UNLV guard Jerel Blassingame during an 89-88 win.Mountain West Conference Reprimands Araujo, March 9, 2004 Six days later on March 12, in a 54-51 loss to Utah, Araujo was charged with a technical foul for elbowing the Utes' Andrew Bogut in the head in the MWC Tournament.GAME 29 RECAP -- HEARTBREAKER ENDS COUGARS VICTORY STREAK ==Professional career== The Toronto Raptors selected Ara\u00fajo with the eighth pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, making him the first college senior drafted that year, one pick ahead of future NBA finals MVP Andre Iguodala. His NBA career was mostly disappointing with him seeing limited action as a rookie, averaging 3.3 points and 3.1 rebounds in 12.5 minutes per game.Rafael Ara\u00fajo Player Page He set a career-high with 14 rebounds against the Sacramento Kings on January 5, 2005. Days later, on January 9, he scored a career-high 14 points against the Golden State Warriors. He later matched that total against the Kings on November 25, 2005. In the 2005-06 season, he again struggled through a disappointing year and had trouble getting playing time, averaging 11.6 minutes a game, 2.3 points, and 2.8 rebounds while shooting a dismal 36.6% from the field. Shortly after that season, Toronto GM Rob Babcock was fired, and it was rumored that the firing, in part, had to do with the drafting of Ara\u00fajo.Raptors Trade Bust Ara\u00fajo to Jazz The player claimed he did not play much with the Raptors because then- coach Sam Mitchell held a grudge against Babcock, and thus he did not want to put Babcock's draft pick on the court. On June 8, 2006, Ara\u00fajo was traded to the Utah Jazz with an undisclosed amount of money for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley. Many viewed this as a new beginning for Ara\u00fajo, a chance for him to change the direction of his career. He worked hard in Utah, dropping his weight from 295 pounds to 275 in an effort to improve his athleticism.Big Loss for Ara\u00fajo He also expressed much interest as he already played in Utah during college. However, he did not fit in well in Utah's offense, which was already set with Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur in the frontcourt, and Ara\u00fajo played sparingly during the 2006-07 season. He averaged 2.6 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in 28 games, averaging only 8.9 minutes per appearance. Ara\u00fajo's rookie contract expired after the 2006-07 season, and Jazz owner Larry H. Miller said publicly that he liked Ara\u00fajo and hoped he could return to the team the following season.Miller Hopes To Re-sign Araujo Ara\u00fajo played for Utah in the 2007 Rocky Mountain Revue, but the Jazz signed 7-foot-1 Kyrylo Fesenko during the offseason, filling the roster spot that Ara\u00fajo held previously. With that opportunity gone, and his NBA career likely over, Ara\u00fajo signed a 1-year, $500,000 contract to play for Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia.Araujo finds a home with Russian Team Ara\u00fajo claimed that despite the easy adaptation, his lack of European passport and Spartak's underperformances led him to leave. Ara\u00fajo was in training camp with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves for 2008 but was waived before the 2008-09 season.Timberwolves Waive Center Rafael Araujo He claimed that this happened because of the arrival of Kevin Love, and because Ara\u00fajo was not in top shape due to an injured knee.Baby: \u201cN\u00e3o tive muitas chances (na NBA) e as que tive n\u00e3o foram justas\u201d After a brief and failed stint at the Shanghai Sharks, in January 2009, Ara\u00fajo signed with Brazilian club Flamengo for the 2009 season. The details of his contract were not revealed. He became the star of the club's team alongside Marcelinho Machado.Ex-piv\u00f4 da NBA j\u00e1 treina no Flamengo Six months later, at the end of the 2009 season, he signed a deal with Paulistano for the 2009-10 season, and in June 2010 he transferred back to Flamengo signing a two-year contract. For his second stint at Flamengo, Ara\u00fajo, for numerology reasons, changed the spelling of his nickname to \"B\u00e0bby\" and his jersey number from 55 to 66. Ara\u00fajo made headlines in January 2011 by shattering a glass backboard with a powerful dunk during a game in the FIBA Americas League. Video of the play was widely circulated across the Internet.Rafael Ara\u00fajo Shatters Backboard In June 2011, he signed a deal with Franca Basquetebol Clube. In 2012, Ara\u00fajo decided to retire, though he was open to return to basketball if he had a good proposal. In October 2012, Araujo returned to basketball, signing with Mogi das Cruzes.Baby is back after retirement He moved to Pinheiros in 2014. ==NBA career statistics== :(Correct as of 30 May 2009)Rafael Ara\u00fajo NBA Stats === Regular season === |- | align=\"left\" | 2004\u201305 | align=\"left\" | Toronto | 59 || 41 || 12.5 || .434 || .333 || .782 || 3.1 || .3 || .4 || .1 || 3.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2005\u201306 | align=\"left\" | Toronto | 52 || 34 || 11.6 || .366 || .000 || .536 || 2.8 || .3 || .5 || .1 || 2.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2006\u201307 | align=\"left\" | Utah | 28 || 0 || 8.9 || .415 || .000 || .621 || 2.4 || .4 || .2 || .1 || 2.6 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 139 || 75 || 11.4 || .405 || .250 || .679 || 2.8 || .3 || .4 || .1 || 2.8 === Playoffs === |- | align=\"left\" | 2007 | align=\"left\" | Utah | 5 || 0 || 5.6 || .375 || .000 || .417 || 2.2 || .2 || .2 || .0 || 2.2 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 5 || 0 || 5.6 || .375 || .000 || .417 || 2.2 || .2 || .2 || .0 || 2.2 ==References== ==External links== * * *NBA Draft Busts *Player profile @ Flamengo.com.br *Ex-Toronto Raptor Rafael Araujo shatters backboard in Brazil (Video) Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Arizona Western Matadors men's basketball players Category:BC Spartak Saint Petersburg players Category:Brazilian expatriate basketball people in Canada Category:Brazilian expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Brazilian expatriates in Russia Category:Brazilian men's basketball players Category:BYU Cougars men's basketball players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Club Athletico Paulistano basketball players Category:Esporte Clube Pinheiros basketball players Category:Expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:Flamengo basketball players Category:Franca Basquetebol Clube players Category:Mogi das Cruzes Basquete players Category:National Basketball Association players from Brazil Category:Novo Basquete Brasil players Category:Sportspeople from Curitiba Category:Toronto Raptors draft picks Category:Toronto Raptors players Category:Utah Jazz players Category:2002 FIBA World Championship players ",
