    "text": "The Gabrantovices were a conjectural group of Ancient Britons inhabiting the coast of what is now Yorkshire in Northern England. They may have been a sub- tribe or sept of the Brigantes or of the Parisi. As with their proposed neighbours, the Lopocares, the Gabrantovices are not directly attested: the name is taken from Ptolemy's name \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u0395\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, or in Latin Gabrantvicvm Sinus \u2014 the Gabrantovician Harbour. This is identified with modern Bridlington Bay or Filey Bay.A.L.F. Rivet, C. Smith, The Place-names of Roman Britain, Batsford (1979) The meaning of the name has been discussed as deriving from one of two Celtic roots, either *gabro- meaning a goat (Welsh gafr) or *gabranto- meaning \"riding a horse\" with second element meaning \"fight\", so \"Goat warriors\" or \"Cavalry warriors\".Helmut Birkhan, Germanen und Kelten bis zum Ausgang der R\u00f6merzeit, B\u00f6hlau (1970)K Jackson, Journal of Roman Studies XXXVIII (1948), 57 ==References== Category:Celtic Britons Category:History of Yorkshire Category:Iron Age peoples of Europe Category:Historical Celtic peoples ",
