The game includes 10 character hand puppets. ==Publication history== The Bullwinkle and Rocky Role-Playing Party Game was designed by David Cook and Warren Spector, and published by TSR in 1988 as a boxed set with a 32-page book, two 16-page books, 108 cards (two decks), 20 cardboard stand-ups (19 characters & 1 blank) , six spinners, two cardstock sheets, 4 dice (2 moose dice & 2 flying squirrel dice) and 10 hand puppets. ==Reception== Lawrence Schick comments that \"The introductory-level rules are so loose, the game barely qualifies as an RPG.\" He commented that the hand puppets \"have no bearing on play, but are nice to have\". The game was a Gamers' Choice award-winner. ==Reviews== *Dragon (Issue 144 - Apr 1989) ==References== Category:Comedy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games based on television series Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1988 Category:The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends Category:TSR, Inc. games ",
