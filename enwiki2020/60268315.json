The show premiered on February 21, 2019 on the premium cable and streaming service Showtime. The series' first season debuted on February 21, 2019, and garnered positive reviews. == History == Desus & Mero is the third series co-hosted by the pair, following the 2014 Complex TV web series Desus vs. Mero, and the 2016 Viceland television and web series Desus & Mero. ==Development & production== Showtime announced they had ordered a half-hour late night series starring Desus and Mero, in June 2018, to be the network's first late night show ever. Desus and Mero stated that the increased budget would allow the show to have more pre-recorded sketches, a research team, and an upgraded set. They also hired a writer's room with the following writers: Mike Pielocik, Josh Gondelman, Claire Friedman, Ziwe Fumudoh, Robert Kornhauser, and Heben Nigatu. The series debuted February 21, 2019. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was their first guest. On April 21, 2019, it was announced that Desus & Mero would expand to air two nights per week, on Mondays and Thursdays. On November 21, 2019, the same day as the airing of Season One's final episode, Showtime announced the renewal of the show for a second season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show went on temporary hiatus, but returned on March 30 in a teleconferencing format from Baker and Martinez's respective homes. In September 2020, the show's Twitter announced that the show had been renewed for a third season. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2019)=== ===Season 2 (2020)=== ==Critical reception== Desus & Mero has received positive reviews. Daniel D'addario wrote for Variety: \"Their perspective, in a sea of late-night shows all modeled on John Oliver's studiousness, feels genuinely new. And Desus and Mero showed enough comic resourcefulness, and enough enthusiasm and warmth, throughout their broadcast to make clear it's worth watching no matter who guests.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kristen Baldwin gave the show a B+ and stated in the review: \"The initial outing revealed a few weaknesses in the new format, but it retained the humor, point of view, and boisterous energy that makes Desus and Mero an essential late-night addition.\" Marc Silver wrote for The Washington Post, \"With their own wit and the help of veterans from the Stephen Colbert and John Oliver late-night shows, they bring a fresh and funny take and add all-too-rarely heard Black and Latino perspectives.\" == Accolades == Hosts Desus and Mero received a 2019 Webby Special Achievement Award for their talk show. The show received a 2019 Television Critics Association Award nomination in the Outstanding Achievement in Sketch/Variety Shows category. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Desus & Mero on Showtime * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2010s American television talk shows Category:2020s American television talk shows Category:2010s American late-night television series Category:2020s American late-night television series Category:Showtime (TV network) original programming Category:Television series reboots ",
