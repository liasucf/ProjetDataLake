    "text": "Appointment with Death is a 1945 play by crime writer Agatha Christie. It is based on her 1938 novel of the same name. == Background == Christie is silent on the writing of both the book and the play in her autobiography. Her biography states that she started writing the play in a burst of enthusiasm after being involved in the preparations for Murder on the Nile which was being presented by her actor friend Francis L. Sullivan. The writing was completed by March 1944 and preparations were made towards the end of the year for an opening in Glasgow before transferring to the West End theatre. Christie wrote to her agent, Edmund Cork, the month before that \"it really seems quite impossible that the play can be ready for Glasgow!\"Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 251) Collins, 1984 Nevertheless, the play did open there at the King's Theatre on 29 January 1945The Scotsman 30 January 1945 (Page 6) and then opened in the West End on 31 March 1945 at the Piccadilly Theatre. The play was not well received by the critics although box office receipts at the start were better than those for And Then There Were None eighteen months earlier. The play was directed by Terence de Marney who had played Philip Lombard in And Then There Were None. The play closed on 5 May after just 42 performances. The original West End production is most notable for the appearance of Joan Hickson in the role of Miss Pryce. Christie was so taken with her performance that she wrote to Hickson and stated that she hoped she would one day play the character of Miss Marple.Haining, Peter. Agatha Christie \u2013 Murder in Four Acts (Page 140). 1990. Virgin Books. Hickson was later cast in this role in 1984 in the BBC television series. The adaptation of the book is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only eliminating Hercule Poirot from the story, but changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton commits suicide and drops several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death, whereas in the novel Lady Westholme is the murderess. In the play, Lady Westholme becomes a purely comic character. == Synopsis of Scenes == The time \u2013 the present. ACT I *The lounge of the King Solomon Hotel, Jerusalem.

Unhappily, her people, with one exception, are less surprising than their surroundings. As a thriller \u2013 how did Mrs. Boynton die? \u2013 the play is tepid and far too talkative. But it does give Miss Mary Clare a strong scene or two as the woman of the gimlet gaze, and Miss Carla Lehmann and Mr. Owen Reynolds both help pleasantly.\"The Observer 8 April 1945 (Page 2) The Guardian's issue of 2 April 1945 contained a review by \"LH\" in which he praised the character of Mrs Boynton but said that, \"her death leaves the last act colourless. The business of spotting which of the many interested hands held the fatal hypodermic syringe is commonplace. It is not the flies caught in the web, but the spider in the middle, that is the evening's strength. Apart from thus pulling down the roof- tree in the second interval, Miss Christie has built up her house of mystery with her usual skill.\"The Guardian 2 April 1945 (Page 6) The Daily Mirrors short review of 3 April 1945, by Bernard Buckham said, \"Has a strong dash of comedy, which it can do with!\"Daily Mirror 3 April 1945 (Page 7) ===Credits of London production=== Director: Terence de Marney Cast of London Production:Christie, Agatha.
