    "text": "The Murder Capital are an Irish post-punk band based in Dublin. The band consists of James McGovern (vocals), Damien Tuit (guitar), Cathal Roper (guitar), Gabriel Pascal Blake (bass) and Diarmuid Brennan (drums). The band are from different parts of Ireland but were formed in Dublin in 2015. == History == The band began performing together in 2015, and set up their own label Human Season Records in 2018 before releasing their first singles in 2019. On 16 August 2019, The Murder Capital released their debut studio album, When I Have Fears, which was produced by Flood and was met with widespread critical acclaim. In autumn 2019 the band performed a sold out tour across the UK and Europe in promotion of the album. == Style == The band has been actively compared to several post-punk and art punk bands to arise out of the United Kingdom over the late 2010s, such as Idles, Slaves, Shame, and fellow Irish band Fontaines D.C., primarily as a result of touring with these bands. Writing for The Guardian, Damien Morris described the band as \"reaching back to Joy Division\u2019s drum tattoos, interlocking with surging, wave-break bass. Pixies' quiet-loud-quiet trick is in there, as are Shame and Savages, while PJ Harvey and the Bad Seeds infest tracks such as Green and Blue.\" In describing the themes of their music, the band told DIY magazine expressed visceral animation eager for improvement in their home town: \"It just feels like there are loads of fuckin' hotels going up over Dublin, where there could be new housing,\" James hammers home. \"There are cranes all over the city. There's one on George's Street right now, and they're gutting this beautiful Georgian house, and I stopped and asked the builder what it was gonna be, and it's turning into a fuckin' Premier Inn.\" The band further said, \"the hotels are only a sidenote to the homelessness, the suicide, the mental health issues. The lack of services available to people who aren't from even middle class backgrounds,\" he continues. \"We just wanna talk about it as much as possible, and make sure that the government knows that we're not happy with the standard of where it's at. People have real issues in their lives, and they need somewhere to go and talk about these things beyond their friends and families. It feels like there's no excuses. I know bad things that have happened to people that were avoidable.\" == Members == The Murder Capital are: * James McGovern \u2013 vocals * Damien Tuit \u2013 guitars * Cathal Roper \u2013 guitars * Gabriel Paschal Blake \u2013 bass * Diarmuid Brennan \u2013 drums ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| IRE ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| When I Have Fears | * Release: 16 August 2019 * Label: Human Season * Format: CD, digital download, streaming, vinyl | 2 || 18 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Feeling Fades\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2019 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Green & Blue\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Don't Cling to Life\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"More is Less\" |} == References == == External links == * Category:Irish rock music groups Category:Post-punk revival music groups Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:Musical groups from Dublin (city) ",
