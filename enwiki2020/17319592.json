Sturston Hall is mentioned in the Domesday Book as one of two manors held by Ulfkell and Wodi, each manor being of half a carucate (a Danish land measure) each. The two manors were given to Henry de Ferrers after the Norman Conquest. By 1348 Sir Ralf Rochfort had inherited Sturston, with Grendon and Shenstone. He died childless, and in 1386 the estates passed to Sir William Chetwynd, 1st Lord Grendon of Ingestre in Staffordshire. Chetwynd sold the manor of Sturston to John Kniveton of Bradley, son of Sir John Kniveton and the hall stayed in the ownership of the Kniveton family for several hundred years.
