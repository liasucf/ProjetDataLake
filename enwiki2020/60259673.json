    "text": "Bert Boyer is an American molecular biologist who is the Professor of Molecular Biology for the Department of Biology and Wildlife at University of Alaska Fairbanks, Bob and Charlee Moore Endowed Professor, Director of Alaska Native Health Research, and OHSU Knight for the Cardiovascular Institute School of Medicine. He was instrumental in forming the Center for Alaska Native Health Research. Boyer's research group specifically focuses on genetic and environmental risk and prevention initiatives related to obesity and diabetes in Yup'ik Eskimos from Southwest Alaska. == Education == In 1982, Boyer received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas. He then attended LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he obtained his Ph.D. for Physiology in 1988.OHSU (2019).

Boyer and his colleagues have conducted a fifteen year longitudinal study in rural Alaska, which involves about 2,000 Yup\u2019ik Alaska Natives based in eleven communities around Alaska. Their research evaluates how the Native peoples subsistence style diet and physical activity may prevent chronic diseases, such as diabetes.CEHS (2019).
