In 1796 she was assigned to the Spanish Philippines, and so she departed Concepcion, Chile for Manila on 10 October 1796 in the company of the third-rates Europa, Monta\u00f1es, San Pedro, and the frigate Pilar.Aguado, Juan-Garcia, Jose M (1999). Un Ingeniero de Marina en el s. XVIII. A Coruna. University de Coruna Press. p. 320 In Manila a typhoon severely damaged the squadron, putting it out of action for nearly two years.Parkinson 1954, p. 139 At the same time, the Anglo-Spanish War broke out between Great Britain and Spain. After repairs were completed, Admiral Ignacio Maria de \u00c1lava y S\u00e1enz de Navarrete attempted to use the fleet to disrupt the British trade with China by sailing the squadron into the South China Sea in search of a British convoy. After fighting an inconclusive battle with a British fleet in January 1797, de Navarrete ordered Fama and Europa to Macau in an attempt to intercept British merchantmen in the Pearl River estuary.Parkinson 1954, p. 157 This operation was likewise a failure, and both ships returned to Manila.Parkinson, C. Northcote (1954). War in the Eastern Seas, 1793 \u2013 1815. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd. p. 157 In 1804 Fama and three other Spanish frigates departed Montevideo for Spain laden silver and gold destined for France. Though Britain and Spain were not at war, the Royal Navy intercepted the Spanish force with the intent to stop its valuable cargo from reaching France. In the ensuing Battle of Cape Santa Maria, a force of 4 British frigates attacked the Spanish frigates. Fama struck her colors in surrender soon after the battle started, but later attempted to flee. She was caught by the faster HMS Medusa and HMS Lively several hours later and forced to surrender a second time. Following her capture, Fama was inducted into the Royal Navy as HMS Fama. She was sold in 1812. == References == * Parkinson, C. Northcote (1954). War in the Eastern Seas, 1793 \u2013 1815.
