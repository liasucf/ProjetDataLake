After the Ottoman conquest of Crete, the Kourmoulis family converted to Islam, producing several beys and aghas, but remaining Crypto-Christians in reality.Dionysios Kokkinos, \u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u039c\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, 6th edition, Athens 1974, vol. 2, p. 23 - 24. Both Kourmoulis and his family protected the Christians of Dikti and Psiloritis region. In 1814, in response to the murder of some armed Ottomans, Kourmoulis was accused as a secret Christian, but managed to be acquitted.Kokkinos, 1974, vol. 2, p. 24 - 25. He participated in the preparation of the Greek Revolution in Crete, being a member of the Filiki Eteria after being initiated by Gregorios Kallonas. During the Easter of 1821, while he was in Chania, he revealed in public his Christian faith.
