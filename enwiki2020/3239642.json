    "text": "\"Heroes\" is a song by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno, produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, and recorded in July and August 1977 at Hansa Studio by the Wall. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his 12th studio album of the same name, backed with the song \"V-2 Schneider\". A product of Bowie's \"Berlin\" period, the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or the United States after its release, but it has since become one of his signature songs. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. Heroes has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"Rebel Rebel\". Inspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the Berlin Wall, the song tells the story of two lovers, one from East and one from West Berlin. Bowie's performance of Heroes on 6 June 1987, at the German Reichstag in West Berlin has been considered a catalyst to the later fall of the Berlin Wall. Following his death in January 2016, the German government thanked Bowie for \"helping to bring down the Wall\", adding \"you are now among Heroes\". Heroes has received numerous accolades since its release, as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the \"greatest songs\" compiled by various music publications; Rolling Stone named the song the 46th greatest ever, and NME named it the 15th greatest. Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that Heroes \"is perhaps pop's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity\". ==Title and lyrics== The song title is a reference to the 1975 track \"Hero\" by German krautrock band Neu!,Mat Snow (2007). \"Making Heroes\", MOJO 60 Years of Bowie: p.69 whom Bowie and Eno admired. It was one of the early tracks recorded during the album sessions, but remained an instrumental until towards the end of production.Nicholas Pegg (2000). The Complete David Bowie: pp. 90\u201392 The quotation marks in the title of the song, a deliberate affectation, were designed to impart an ironic quality on the otherwise romantic or triumphant words and music.Robert Matthew-Walker David Bowie, theatre of music 1985 p46 \"The use of quotation marks possibly implies that the \"Heroes\" are not to be taken too seriously.\"Chris Welch David Bowie: changes, 1970\u20131980 1999 p116 \"The use of quotation marks around the title meant that Bowie felt there was something ironic about being a rock 'n' roll hero to his fans, while he kept his own emotional life as far distant and remote and private as possible.\"NME interview in 1977 with Charles Shaar Murray . Retrieved from Bowie: Golden Years 20 February 2007. Producer Tony Visconti took credit for inspiring the image of the lovers kissing \"by the wall\", when he and backing vocalist Antonia Maass (Maa\u00df) embraced in front of Bowie as he looked out of the Hansa Studio window.David Buckley (1999). Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story: pp.323\u2013326 Bowie claimed that the protagonists were based on an anonymous young couple, but Visconti, who was married to Mary Hopkin at the time, contends that Bowie was protecting him and his affair with Maass. Bowie confirmed this in 2003, over two decades after Visconti and Hopkin's eventual divorce. ==Music== Bowie said that the \"plodding tempo and rhythm\" were inspired by the Velvet Underground song \"I'm Waiting for the Man\". Richard Buskin of Sound on Sound described Heroes as a \"highly experimental piece of art rock\". The music, co-written by Bowie and Eno, is in a two-chord progression (D\u2013G), with a \"brief excursion to familiar chords\" in the key of G. Biographer David Buckley likens it to a Wall of Sound production, a forceful and noisy arrangement of guitars, percussion and synthesizers. Eno said the song always \"sounded grand and heroic\" and that he had \"that very word \u2013 heroes \u2013 in my mind\" even before Bowie wrote the lyrics. The backing track consists of a conventional arrangement of piano, bass guitar, rhythm guitar and drums. The other parts consist of synthesizer parts by Eno using an EMS VCS3 to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three oscillators, producing a juddering effect. In addition, King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to feed back and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the pitch of the feedback. Visconti mixed out Dennis Davis' kick drum, stating that the track \"seemed to plod\" with it but had a more energetic feel without it. ===Vocal gating progression=== Bowie's vocal was recorded after most of the session musicians had departed Berlin, with a \"multi-latch\" system devised by Visconti that creatively misused gating.Hodgson, Jay (2010). Understanding, p.88. . Three microphones were used to capture the vocal, with one microphone nine inches from Bowie, one 20 feet away, and one 50 feet away. Each microphone was muted as the next one was triggered. As the music built, Bowie was forced to sing at increased volumes to overcome the gating effect, leading to an increasingly impassioned vocal performance as the song progresses. Jay Hodgson writes, > Bowie's performance thus grows in intensity precisely as ever more ambience > infuses his delivery until, by the final verse, he has to shout just to be > heard ... The more Bowie shouts just to be heard, in fact, the further back > in the mix Visconti's multi-latch system pushes his vocal tracks, creating a > stark metaphor for the situation of Bowie's doomed lovers.Hodgson (2010), p. > 89. ==Release== Heroes was released in a variety of languages and lengths (\"a collector's wet dream\" in the words of NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray). In contrast to the bewildering audio situation, the video (directed by Nick Ferguson) was a stark and simple affair, the singer captured performing the song in what appeared to be a single take with multiple cameras, swaying in front of a spotlight that created a monotone and near- silhouette effect. Heroes was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single of Bowie's 12th studio album of the same name by RCA Victor (as RCA / PB 11121), with a length of 3:32, and with fellow album track \"V-2 Schneider\" as the B-side. It subsequently appeared, with a longer length of 6:07, as the third track, between \"Joe the Lion\" and \"Sons of the Silent Age\", on the album in October the same year. Another 12\" single, containing both the single and album versions, was released in the US by RCA Victor (as RCA / JD-11151) the same year. The German and French versions, titled Helden and H\u00e9ros, respectively, was released by RCA Victor (RCA / PC-9821). Despite a large promotional push, including Bowie's first live Top of the Pops appearance since 1973, Heroes reached only number 24 in the UK charts, and failed to make the US Billboard Hot 100. In Italy, the song was certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. Bowie filmed a promotional music video for the track in 1977. Directed by Nick Ferguson and shot in Paris, it features numerous shots of Bowie against a backdrop of white light and wearing the same bomber-jacket he wore on the \"Heroes\" album cover. Pegg believes the effect is similar to Liza Minnelli's performance of \"Maybe This Time\" in the 1972 film Cabaret. ==Reception and legacy== Writing for NME on its release, Charlie Gillett slated the record, saying: \"Well he had a pretty good run for our money, for a guy who was no singer. But I think his time has been and gone, and this just sounds weary. Then again, maybe the ponderous heavy riff will be absorbed on the radio, and the monotonous feel may just be hypnotic enough to drag people into buying it. I hope not.\" Despite the poor review it featured at number 6 in the NMEs end of year critics poll for 1977. Later assessments were more favourable. In February 1999, Q magazine listed Heroes as one of the 100 greatest singles of all time as voted by the readers. In March 2005, the same magazine placed it at number 56 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2004, Rolling Stone rated Heroes number 46 in its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was included in 2008's The Pitchfork Media 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present. John J. Miller of National Review rated Heroes number 21 on a list of \"the 50 greatest conservative rock songs\"John J. Miller (26 May 2006). . Retrieved 20 February 2007. due to its anti-Soviet political context. It has also become a gay anthem. Uncut placed Heroes at number 1 in its 30 greatest Bowie songs in 2008. Moby has said that Heroes is one of his favourite songs ever written, calling it \"inevitable\" that his music would be influenced by the song, and Dave Gahan, the lead singer of Depeche Mode, was hired into the band when band founder Vince Clarke heard him singing Heroes at a jam session. Bowie regularly performed the song in concert. ==Accolades== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"|Publication ! scope=\"col\"|Country ! scope=\"col\"|Accolade ! scope=\"col\"|Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"|TIME | United States | \"All-Time 100 Songs\" | 2011 | |- ! scope=\"row\"|Rolling Stone | United States | \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" | 2003 | 46 |- ! scope=\"row\"|NME | United Kingdom | \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\" | 2002 | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\"|NME | United Kingdom | \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" | 2014 | 15 |- ! scope=\"row\"|NME | United Kingdom | \"100 Greatest Songs of NME's Lifetime...So Far\" | 2012 | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"|NME | United Kingdom | \"NME Readers Best Tracks of the Last 60 Years\" | 2012 | 16 |- ! scope=\"row\"|NME | United Kingdom | \"Best tracks of the 1970s\" | 2014 | 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"|NME | United Kingdom | \"David Bowie's 40 Greatest Songs\" | 2014 | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Mojo Magazine | United Kingdom | \"The 100 Greatest Singles of All Time\" | 1997 | 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Sounds | United Kingdom | \"All Time Top 100 Singles\" | 1985 | 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Q | United Kingdom | \"Q Readers Top 100 Singles of All Time\" | 1999 | 36 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Pitchfork | United States | The Pitchfork 500 |2008 | |- ! scope=\"row\"|Pitchfork | United States | \"The 200 Best Songs of the 1970s\" | 2016 | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Radio X | United Kingdom | \"The Top 1,000 Songs of All Time\" |2010 |24 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Radio X | United Kingdom | \"Best of British\" |2016 |7 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Uncut | United Kingdom | \"David Bowie's 30 best songs\" | 2008 | 1 |} N/A designates unordered lists. ==Track listing== All tracks written by David Bowie and Brian Eno, except where noted. ;7\" vinyl * RCA / PB 11121 # \"'Heroes'\" \u2013 3:38 # \"V-2 Schneider\" (Bowie) \u2013 3:10 ;12\" vinyl * RCA / JD-11151 (US promo) # \"'Heroes'\" (Album version) \u2013 6:07 # \"'Heroes'\" (Single version) \u2013 3:29 * RCA / PC-9821 (Germany) # \"'Heroes'\" / \"'Helden'\" (English/German version) \u2013 6:09 # \"'Heroes'\" / \"'H\u00e9ros'\" (English/French version) \u2013 6:09 ==Personnel== * David Bowie \u2013 lead vocals, piano, ARP Solina String Ensemble, Chamberlin, percussion, producer * Robert Fripp \u2013 lead guitar * Carlos Alomar \u2013 rhythm guitar * George Murray \u2013 bass guitar * Dennis Davis \u2013 drums * Brian Eno \u2013 EMS VCS 3 synthesiser, guitar treatments * Tony Visconti \u2013 producer, backing vocals, tambourine, tape reel as percussion ==Charts and certifications== ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1977\u201378) !Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Australia (AMR) |align=\"center\"|11 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Record World Singles Chart 101\u2013150 | align=\"center\"| 126 |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (2016) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|18 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Portugal (AFP) |align=\"center\"|32 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1683 |} ===Certifications=== ==Live versions== * Prior to the single release of Heroes, Bowie first performed the song on the final episode of friend Marc Bolan's Granada Television series Marc (filmed 7 September 1977, broadcast 28 September 1977, after Bolan's funeral). This particular version, released as a 7\" picture disc, on 22 September 2017, has an alternate backing track that was recorded with Bolan playing lead guitar and the T.Rex line up of Dino Dines on keyboards, and the rhythm section of Herbie Flowers on bass and Tony Newman on drums. Coincidentally, prior to joining T.Rex, Flowers and Newman were a part of Bowie's rhythm section on the Diamond Dogs album and its tour, documented on the live album David Live. * Bowie performed the song when he appeared on Bing Crosby's 1977 Christmas TV special, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas. In the performance, filmed on 11 September 1977, Bowie sang over a prerecorded backing track. * On 20 October 1977 Bowie sang the song live on the BBC's Top of the Pops, using a new backing track recorded on the previous day by Bowie, Tony Visconti, pianist Sean Mayes and guitarist Ricky Gardiner. * Performances from the Isolar II Tour have been released on Stage (1978) and Welcome to the Blackout (2018). * Bowie performed the song live on his Serious Moonlight Tour in 1983, as seen in the 1984 concert video of that tour and as heard on the live album Serious Moonlight (Live '83), which was part of the 2018 box set Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988) and was released separately in 2019. * The rendition at Live Aid in 1985 has been described as \"the best version of 'Heroes' [Bowie] had ever sung\".David Buckley (1999).

He said it wasn't appropriate as it was a love song, so he opened with a solo version of Paul Simon's \"America\", and then performed Heroes with the house band led by Paul Shaffer. * Bowie performed the song live during the A Reality Tour in 2003, and a performance from November of that year was released on a DVD in 2004, and later on an album, released in 2010. ==Other releases== * The edited 7-inch single, running at 3:32 mins and backed with \"V-2 Schneider\", was released separately in English, French (\u00abH\u00e9ros\u00bb) and German (\u201eHelden\u201c).
