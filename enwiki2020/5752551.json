    "text": "Emo is the tenth studio album by the American punk rock band Screeching Weasel. It was released on May 18, 1999 through Ben Weasel's and John Jughead's label Panic Button Records. It was their first full length record released through Panic Button Records. The album was recorded in Chicago during the blizzard of 1999. Although the title of the album is a tongue-in- cheek stab at the emo scene that was about to break mainstream at the time, the songwriting on the album is extremely emotional and confessional. Lyricist Ben Weasel had used this style of songwriting many times on previous albums, but this marked a noticeable change in tone. ==Track listing== All songs written by Ben Weasel, except \"Linger\" written by Noel Hogan and Dolores O'Riordan. #\"Acknowledge\" - 2:45 #\"Sidewalk Warrior\" - 1:45 #\"Static\" - 2:18 #\"The Scene\" - 2:44 #\"Let Go\" - 4:08 #\"Regroup\" - 3:51 #\"Passion\" - 2:05 #\"Linger\" - 3:45 #\"Last Night\" - 3:47 #\"2-7 Split\" - 3:35 #\"On My Own\" - 2:49 #\"Bark Like a Dog\" - 5:07 ==Personnel== * Ben Weasel - lead vocals, guitar * Jughead - guitar * Mass Giorgini - bass * Dan Lumley - drums ==References== Category:Screeching Weasel albums Category:1999 albums ",
