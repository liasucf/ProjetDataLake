It was Tony McGahan's fourth and final season as Director of Rugby. ==Summary== Munster were drawn in Pool 1 of the 2011\u201312 Heineken Cup alongside Scarlets, Northampton Saints and Castres. Munster defeated Northampton 23\u201321 in their opening pool fixture on 12 November 2011, thanks to an 84th minute drop-goal from Ronan O'Gara. One week later, away from home against Castres, a last-gasp drop-goal from O'Gara again handed victory to Munster, this time 27\u201324. In the December double-header against Scarlets, Munster emerged victorious from both fixtures, firstly defeating the Welsh side 17\u201314 in the away leg, before winning 19\u201313 at home. In Round 5, Munster beat Castres 26\u201310 at Thomond Park to become the first side to qualify for the quarter-finals. A 51\u201336 win away from home against Northampton in the sixth and final round, including a hat- trick from Simon Zebo, secured a home quarter-final for Munster. However, in the quarter-final, Munster were beaten 22\u201316 at home by provincial rivals Ulster, ending their Heineken Cup campaign for the 2011\u201312 season. In the 2011\u201312 Pro12, Munster finished third with 67 points, in a season that included 14 wins, 1 draw and 7 defeats after 22 regular matches. In the play- offs, Munster lost 45\u201310 away to eventual champions Ospreys, in a match that was Tony McGahan's final as Munster head coach. New Zealander Rob Penney was subsequently confirmed as Munster's new head coach. ==2011\u201312 Playing Squad== ==Pre-season== ==2011\u201312 Pro12== ==Play-offs== ===Semi-final=== ==2011\u201312 Heineken Cup== ===Pool 1=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! style=\"width:200px;\"|Team !width=\"20\"|P !width=\"20\"|W !width=\"20\"|D !width=\"20\"|L !width=\"20\"|Tries for !width=\"20\"|Tries against !width=\"20\"|Try diff !width=\"20\"|Points for !width=\"20\"|Points against !width=\"25\"|Points diff !width=\"20\"|TB !width=\"20\"|LB !width=\"20\"|Pts |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" |align=left| Munster | 6 || 6 || 0 || 0 || 14 || 10 || +4 || 163 || 118 || +45 || 1 || 0 || 25 |- style=\"background:#ffc;\" |align=left| Scarlets | 6 || 3 || 0 || 3 || 12 || 9 || +3 || 119 || 124 || \u22125 || 1 || 2 || 15 |- |align=left| Northampton Saints | 6 || 2 || 0 || 4 || 18 || 16 || +2 || 176 || 160 || +16 || 2 || 2 || 12 |- |align=left| Castres | 6 || 1 || 0 || 5 || 10 || 19 || \u22129 || 111 || 167 || \u221256 || 1 || 2 || 7 |} ===Quarter-final=== ==References== ==External links== *2011\u201312 Munster Rugby season official site 2011\u201312 Category:2011\u201312 Pro12 by team Category:2011\u201312 in Irish rugby union Category:2011\u201312 Heineken Cup by team ",
