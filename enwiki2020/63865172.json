His estate was subsequently confiscated, and the manor house fell into ruin. On the restoration of the monarchy the family regained their lands, and a new house was built by Sir Charles Wolseley, 2nd Baronet, a short distance from the old manor house. There were alterations by James Trubshaw in the 1820s. The hall was damaged by fire in the 1950s, and demolished in 1966. In the 1990s there was some restoration of the gardens, by Sir Charles Wolseley.
