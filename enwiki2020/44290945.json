    "text": "The Murray Apartments and Cottages are a small cluster of historic residential properties at 200, 204, and 206 Seward Street, on the edge of the business district of Sitka, Alaska. Two of the buildings are 1-1/2 story frame cottages, while the third (206 Seward), also known as the Murray Flats and the Baranof Apartments, is a 2-1/2 story frame structure housing four apartments. These buildings originally stood in Douglas, Alaska, and were disassembled and moved to Sitka in 1921 by Abner Murray. They represent the first buildings erected in Sitka specifically intended as residential housing rental units; the apartment house was the first multi-unit residential unit in Sitka to be built since the Alaska Purchase in 1867. The properties were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sitka City and Borough, Alaska ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1921 Category:Buildings and structures in Sitka, Alaska Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Sitka, Alaska Category:Apartment buildings in Alaska ",
