Wellcome Library, London, number 62892. Ethiopian manuscripts are known to have reached Europe as early as the fifteenth century, perhaps even earlier, through Egypt, Ethiopian pilgrims to the Holy Land and through members of the Ethiopian monastery of St Stephen of the Abyssinians in Rome.D. Nosnitsin, \"Ethiopian Manuscripts and Ethiopian manuscript studies. A brief overview and evaluation,\" Gazette du livre m\u00e9di\u00e9val, 58 (2012), 2\u201316. Subsequently, travellers, missionaries, military personnel and scholars contributed to the development of collections outside Ethiopia. In Europe, the three biggest collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are in Rome (Biblioteca Apostolica Vatican), in Paris (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France) and in London (British Library). These three organisations together hold about 2,700 manuscripts. Oriental collections of nearly all significant European libraries also have Ethiopian material, with some still pursuing a policy of acquisition.V. Six, \u201cNeuzugang von \u00e4thiopischen Handschriften an die Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz,\u201d Aethiopica 10 (2007), 177-83. The five largest collections in North America are at Catholic University, the Library of Congress, UCLA, Princeton, and Howard University. Monasteries and modern institutions in Ethiopia have, meanwhile, maintained extensive collections and in some cases are still centres of manuscript production. Parchment (ber\u0101nn\u0101) was used for Ethiopian manuscripts from the time of the Four Gospels books of Abb\u0101 Garim\u0101.Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 154. Apart from Islamic manuscripts, paper only came into general use twentieth century.Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 155. There are eighty eight languages in Ethiopia according to Ethnologue,Ethnologue page on Ethiopian languages but not all support manuscript cultures. The majority of manuscripts are in Ge'ez, the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia. Catalogues of individual collections were written in the nineteenth century, with a key work for the disposition of Ethiopian MSS more widely prepared in 1995 and published by Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson.Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson, R\u00e9pertoire des Biblioth\u00e9ques et des Catalogues de Manuscrits \u00c9thiopiens (DNRS Editions; Paris: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, \u00c9ditions, 1995) Since that time, an online inventory has been developed that documents items labelled as \u201cEthiopian manuscripts\u2019\u2019 in libraries all over the world. This \"Inventory of Libraries and Catalogues of Ethiopian Manuscripts\" was created in 2008 and is maintained since then by A. Wion, C. Bosc-Tiess\u00e9 and M.-L. Derat from CNRS (Paris). The list of institutions below is a partial selection of the most prominent and best known collections, giving special attention to the individual researchers involving in forming the collections and those scholars who wrote the catalogues. == British Collections of Ethiopian Manuscripts == ===Bodleian Library, Oxford=== The early collections in the Bodleian Library at Oxford came from James Bruce, and consisted of 25 Ethiopic manuscripts purchased by the library in 1843. The collection soon grew to 33 manuscripts and these were catalogued and published in 1848 by August Dillmann.August Dillmann, Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae Oxoniensis. Pars 7 Pars 7 (Oxonii: E Typographeo Academico, 1848). Since the mid-nineteenth century the collection has expanded to 130 items. A notable addition in 2002 was an illustrated seventeenth-century manuscript of a Marian text, Arganona Weddase (\u2018Harp of Praise\u2019) (MS. Aeth.e.28).Retrieved September 2016 https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding- resources/guides/hebrew The uncatalogued manuscripts were revisited in 2007 by Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berh\u0101na Tafar\u0101.Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berh\u0101na Tafar\u0101, A Catalogue of Previously Uncatalogued Ethiopic Manuscripts in England: Twenty-Three Manuscripts in the Bodleian, Cambridge University and John Rylands University Libraries and in a Private Collection, (Oxford: Oxford University Press on behalf of the University of Manchester, 2007). ===British Library, London=== Folio from an illustrated Bible, Annunciation to Zechariah, British Library Add MS 59874.

A catalogue of the enlarged collection was prepared by William Wright (orientalist) and published in 1877.William Wright, Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847 (London: British Museum, 1877), iii. Nine decades later, Stefan Strelcyn reviewed the manuscripts that had come to the British Library after 1877 and published a catalogue of them.Stefan Strelcyn, Catalogue of Ethiopian Manuscripts in the British Library Acquired Since the Year 1877 (London: British Museum Publications, 1978). The catalogue lists 108 items (some with multiple parts) and covers the general range of Ethiopian literature from Biblical texts to magical and divinatory writings. The transfer of the India Office collection to the British Library in 1982 brought 6 further manuscripts to the collection, first acquired in 1842 by the India Museum in East India House. A further collection of 39 manuscripts came to the British Library from Roger Wenman Cowley (1940-1988). Cowley spent 15 years in Ethiopia as an Anglican missionary and teacher, during which time he assembled a collection of Biblical commentaries in Amharic.Kirsten Stoffregen-Pedersen, Traditional Ethiopian exegesis of the Book of Psalms (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1995): 2. His MSS consist of copies on paper commissioned by Cowley and executed during the years 1967-77 (except for numbers 19-61, 32, 37, 40-42 and 44 which are copies made at different times in the twentieth century). Cowley used this material in his book Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation, published in 1988. Roger W.

In 1877 a catalogue was published by Hermann Zotenberg and gave an account of the 170 manuscripts then in the collection.H. Zotenberg, Catalogue des manuscrits \u00e9thiopiens (gheez et amharique) de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale (Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 1877).

The library holds a substantial number of photographs, images and digital copies of Ethiopian manuscripts and is host to the Ethiopian Study Center.Retrieved August, 2016, http://www.hmml.org/ethiopia-study-center.html The library is also the home for the Ethiopian Manuscript Microfilm Library.Retrieved August, 2016: http://www.hmml.org/emml.html ===Howard University School of Divinity\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Tweed Ethiopian Manuscript Collection, Washington, DC=== The Andr\u00e9 Tweed Ethiopian Manuscript Collection is one of the five largest collections in North America and is fully catalogued online https://betamasaheft.eu/tweed.html . Its collection of 151 codices and 83 scrolls of spiritual healing (also known as magical scrolls) is only surpassed by four larger collections (Christian/Ge'ez unless otherwise noted): The collection at the Department of Semitic and Egyptian Languages / Institute of Christian Oriental Studies at Catholic University in Washington, DC, with 375 codices (of which 177 are Islamic) plus three codex quires and 374 scrolls; the Library of Congress\u2019s Kane collection, with 211 codices and 83 scrolls; UCLA's collection, with 203 codices and 110 scrolls; and Princeton\u2019s collection, with 177+ (some Amharic) and 678 scrolls. The size of the Tweed collection alone makes it important, but in addition to the more common Psalters and service books, the Tweed collection also contains several manuscripts that are of greater significance due to their age and contents. Perhaps the most significant is a possibly 14th or 15th century Acts of Paul codex. The Acts of Paul is part of the New Testament Apocrypha. Fragments of a 16th century psalter including illuminations of the Madonna and child, St. George, the trinity, and the annunciation, is the next oldest codex holding. A 17th or 18th century collection of the Minor Prophets with Christian commentary is another significant codex. Andr\u00e9 Tweed was an alumnus of Howard University\u2019s Medical School and the first African American board-certified psychiatrist in California. He became interested in Ethiopian manuscripts and artifacts and bought many codices, scrolls of spiritual healing, crosses, and other artifacts during his lifetime. When he became terminally ill with cancer, he sought a permanent, appropriate resting place for his prized possessions. That is how the collection came to be part of Howard University School of Divinity\u2019s (HUSD's) collection. Because of the lack of awareness of the collection on the part of the scholarly world, it has not been accessed frequently by scholars. However, in the academic year 2005-06, Gay Byron, the Baptist Missionary Training School Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, traveled to Washington, DC, during her sabbatical year in which her focus was Ge\u2019ez (Classical Ethiopic) and its usefulness for New Testament research, to see the Tweed collection. With the help of Dr. Henry Ferry, formerly Associate Professor of Church History and Associate Dean of HUSD, and Dr. Alice Ogden Bellis, she photographed the entire Acts of Paul codex for her own scholarly research. In addition to the Acts of Paul, the psalter fragment, and Minor Prophets codices, among the older books are the following from the 18th century: a life of St. Cyrus with 53 illuminated portraits, a life of St. Graba, a liturgical text with two illuminated portraits, a treatise on the Trinity, eight Psalters, some with illuminated pages, a Malka Sellasse Trinity, two Mashafa Genzats (burial liturgies), an 18th or 19th century Deggwa (hymnbook) and a second fragment of a Deggwa, a Prayer of Peter along with other religion- magical prayers, another fragment of prayers from a religio-magical text, and a Dersana Michael \u2013 four readings for the festival of the Archangel including two 20th century paintings. Included among the 19th and 20th century codices are a Prayer of St. Simon Stylite, a Book of the Miracles of Mary including several illuminations, an Ecumenical book of Mary with two portraits, several Miracles of Mary and similar texts, a Homily Hymnbook of St. Michael with a drawing of St. Michael and one of Haile Selassie, many Deggwas (hymnbooks), Psalters, various prayer books, various liturgical books, numerous Gospels of Johns, other Gospel books, New Testament collections without the Gospels, and many religio-magical books. In addition to the manuscripts, there are a variety of other artifacts: silver pectoral crosses, processional crosses made of various materials (silver, brass, copper, iron, wood) \u2013 some on generally later wooden shafts, silver hand crosses, silver star of David pendants, other necklaces \u2013 some made of silver or wooden beads, bracelets, rings, a pocket watch, seals, hair ornaments, coins, artwork of various sorts including a late 15th or early 16th century painted diptych and many other diptychs and triptychs of religious subjects, musical instruments including a lyre, a bronze and wood sistrum (a kind of rattle), a one string violin, a kalimbi or hand piano, eating and drinking vessels such as bowls, vases, water jugs, baskets, and even a horse hair wooden wisk, masks, headrests, stools, and a leather bridle. Gebra Paulos and Gebra Sarabamon, also known as Tweed 150, was returned to Debre Libanos Monastery on January 11, 2016, by a contingent from the Howard University School of Divinity community, including Dean Alton B. Pollard III, Associate Dean Gay Byron, Professor Alice Ogden Bellis, student Lawrence Rodgers, pastor of a church in Baltimore, and Memher Zebene Lemma, a double alumnus of HUSD and the head priest of Debre Genet MedhaneAlem (Mount Paradise Savior of the World), one of the largest Ethiopian Orthodox churches in the Washington, DC, area. Blain Zerihun, the Administrative Assistant of the Associate Dean and a native Ethiopian, was also on hand for the return of the manuscript. This was the first time that any major western institution had returned a manuscript from its collection to Ethiopia. ''' In October 2012 the Howard University School of Divinity community became officially aware that Tweed 150 had been microfilmed as part of a UNESCO project in 1976 when it was in the Debre Libanos collection in Ethiopia. The microfilms taken at that time matched the digitized images that were made as part of a digitization project led by Professor Bellis with the help of chief consultant Stephen Delamarter, Professor at George Fox Evangelical Seminary and also creator of the Ethiopian Manuscript Imaging Project. The match was made as part of the process of cataloguing the collection as a follow-up to the digitizing project. Due to complicated legal, political, and cultural issues, it took three years before it was possible to return Gebra Paulos and Gebra Sarabamon to Debre Libanos Monastery. Finally, with the manuscript having only been appraised and insured within days of departure, the Howard contingent flew directly to Addis Ababa on an Ethiopian Air flight courtesy of Ethiopian Air, arriving on Sunday, January 10, 2016. The delegation then proceeded with the manuscript to Debre Libanos Monastery 110 km away. When they arrived, more than two thousand people were there to greet them. The two-hour ceremony included music, dancing, and liturgical readings. The scripture lesson was the story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32). ===J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles=== Gospels, Canon Table Page, J. Paul Getty Museum, MS102. The J. Paul Getty Museum acquired a single manuscript of the Gospels dating to the early sixteenth century in 2008.Retrieved August 2016 http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/242418/unknown-maker-gospel-book- ethiopian-about-1504-1505/ A number of the folios are visible online through the museum's website as well as Wikicommons. It has now acquired some others. ===Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey=== The core collection of Ethiopic manuscripts at Princeton University was formed by Robert Garrett who collected 113 items in Ge\u2019ez and Amharic and donated them to Princeton University Library in 1942. The collection is fully catalogued online.Retrieved August, 2016: http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C0744.03/c0001 Included in the collection are Psalters, Miracles of Mary, Prayer books, Homilies of Michael, Synaxaria, Anaphora of Addai and Mari, Missals and Gospels. Divination texts are also part of the collection. One of the Miracles of Mary is among the oldest and probably dates to the seventeenth century; the other materials mostly date to the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Garrett acquired most his Ethiopic manuscripts from Enno Littmann who led expeditions to Tigray Region and Axum in 1905 and 1906.Retrieved August, 2016: https://rbsc.princeton.edu/topics/316/divisions/15 The Princeton collection has continued to grow through gift and purchase, and is especially strong in magico-medical scrolls of which there are now more than 500 specimens.For a catalogue by David Appleyard: http://libweb5.princeton.edu/mssimages/ethiopic/index.html Retrieved August, 2016 Of historiographical interest is the pseudepigraphical Book of Enoch (Ge'ez: \u1218\u133d\u1210\u1348 \u1204\u1296\u12ad m\u00e4t\u1e63\u1e25\u00e4f\u00e4 henok).Retrieved August, 2016: http://pudl.princeton.edu/objects/zc77sr50z The Princeton manuscript, according to a stamp on the old binding, belong to Rev.
