    "text": "The 2020 European Canoe Slalom Championships took place in Prague, Czech Republic from 18 to 20 September 2020. Originally they were scheduled to take place in London, England, from 15 to 17 May 2020. However, on 18 March, the European Canoe Association announced that the event had been cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later on it was announced that the event would be held in Prague instead of one of the rounds of the World Cup series. It was the 21st edition of the competition, and took place at the Prague-Troja Canoeing Centre. Several leading countries (including Germany, Great Britain and Slovakia) decided not to participate in the event due to COVID related concerns. ==Medal Summary== ===Men=== ====Canoe==== {| |- |C1 | || 104.90 | || 108.66 | || 109.52 |- |C1 team | Benjamin Sav\u0161ek Luka Bo\u017ei\u010d Jure Lenar\u010di\u010d || 120.43 | Liam Jegou Robert Hendrick Jake Cochrane || 135.83 | Grzegorz Hedwig Kacper Sztuba Szymon Zawadzki || 150.58 |} ====Kayak==== {| |- |K1 | || 97.97 | || 98.49 | || 99.06 |- |K1 team | Boris Neveu Quentin Burgi Mathurin Mador\u00e9 || 110.93 | Ji\u0159\u00ed Prskavec V\u00edt P\u0159indi\u0161 Vav\u0159inec Hradilek || 112.38 | Martin Dougoud Lukas Werro Dimitri Marx || 114.14 |} ===Women=== ====Canoe==== {| |- |C1 | || 121.75 | || 122.05 | || 130.03 |- |C1 team | Tereza Fi\u0161erov\u00e1 Gabriela Satkov\u00e1 Tereza Kneblov\u00e1 || 139.11 | Alja Kozorog Eva Alina Ho\u010devar Lea Novak || 164.07 | Lucie Baudu Claire Jacquet Lucie Prioux || 210.44 |} ====Kayak==== {| |- |K1 | || 112.71 | || 114.61 | || 115.43 |- |K1 team | Kate\u0159ina Kud\u011bjov\u00e1 Veronika Vojtov\u00e1 Antonie Galu\u0161kov\u00e1 || 139.64 | Camille Prigent Lucie Baudu Marjorie Delassus || 140.67 | Corinna Kuhnle Nina Weratschnig Antonia Oschmautz || 145.47 |} ==Medals Table== ==See also== *Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports ==References== ==External links== * European Canoe Association Category:European Canoe Slalom Championships European Canoe Slalom Championships European Canoe Slalom Championships European Canoe Slalom Championships European Canoe Slalom Championships ",
