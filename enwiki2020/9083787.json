    "text": "Philosophy as Cultural Politics: Philosophical Papers: v.4 is a 2007 book by the philosopher Richard Rorty. A compilation of selected philosophical papers written by Rorty between 1997 and 2007, it complements three previous selections of his papers. ==Summary== Rorty explores the relation between philosophy and culture. Topics covered include: # the changing role of philosophy in Western culture over the course of recent centuries, # the role of the imagination in intellectual and moral progress, # the notion of 'moral identity', # Wittgenstein's claim that the problems of philosophy are linguistic in nature, # the irrelevance of cognitive science to philosophy # the mistaken idea that philosophers should find the 'place' of such things as consciousness and moral value in a world of physical particles. ==References== *Richard Rorty, Philosophy as Cultural Politics: Philosophical Papers, Cambridge University Press, 2007. . .
