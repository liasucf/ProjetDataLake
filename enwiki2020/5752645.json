    "text": "\"Everything I Want\" was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, performed in English by Vesna Pisarovi\u0107. The song was performed sixth on the night (following Spain's Rosa with \"Europe's Living A Celebration\" and preceding Russia's Prime Minister with \"Northern Girl\"). At the close of voting, it had received 44 points, placing 11th in a field of 24. The song is an up-tempo number, with the singer revealing that \"love is everything I want\". Its name in the local language (Croatian) is \"Sasvim sigurna\" (Quite Sure). It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 2003 Contest by Claudia Beni with \"Vi\u0161e nisam tvoja\". ==Sources== * http://www.esc- history.com/details.asp?key=919 Category:Eurovision songs of 2002 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:English-language Croatian songs Category:2002 songs ",
