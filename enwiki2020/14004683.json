Support for the \"Urban Camping\" Ban included hotelier Walter Isenberg, Vice Chair of a Downtown Denver Partnership board and major donor to Denver's Road Home, the city agency on homelessness. The ban, now Sec. 38-86.2. of the Denver Municipal Code, passed on May 14, 2012 and supersedes Sec. 38-86.1. which provided the homeless a safe sanctuary in downtown Denver between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Sponsored by Mayor Michael Hancock and Councilman Albus Brooks, the ban was approved by a vote of 9 to 4 by the Denver City Council. A number of organizations are opposing the ban criminalizing homelessness including Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, Denver Catholic Worker, Denver Homeless Out Loud, Downtown Denver and Occupy Denver. Denver Homeless Out Loud compiled a report on the impact of the \"Urban Camping\" Ban after surveying 512 homeless people. == References == Category:Neighborhoods in Denver Denver ",
