    "text": "Glenn Arne Hansen (born 20 September 1972) is a retired Norwegian football goalkeeper. After half a year on Langhus's senior team in 1989, he joined the region's prime team Dr\u00f8bak-Frogn in 1990. He played the 1992 season in Ski, then returned to Dr\u00f8bak-Frogn. In March 1996 Hansen was loaned out to Bradford City, trying his luck in reserve matches. However, in late May 1996 the Norwegian top-flight team Str\u00f8msgodset was bereft of goalkeepers, and Hansen agreed on a loan to them. He then joined Str\u00f8msgodset on a permanent basis, playing there until 2001. He then had a nine-year stint in Follo, staying with them until the 2010 Norwegian Football Cup Final which Follo lost. Hansen then played two seasons for then-second-tier Nesodden, then one season each in Dr\u00f8bak-Frogn, Nesodden and Langhus before retiring as a 43-year old. He joined Ski's coaching setup and even featured for the club's fifth-tier senior team. ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ski, Norway Category:Norwegian footballers Category:Dr\u00f8bak-Frogn IL players Category:Str\u00f8msgodset Toppfotball players Category:Follo FK players Category:Norwegian First Division players Category:Eliteserien players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Norwegian expatriate footballers ",
