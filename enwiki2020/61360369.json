It was originally released from September 29, 2019 while coinciding with the television broadcast of Ultraman Taiga. Eight months after it ended, the series was announced to receive a sequel story in November 2020. ==Synopsis== ===Ultra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes=== The first series, , aired from September 29 to December 22, 2019. It follows after the end of Ultraman R/B the Movie and prelude to Ultraman Taiga with a total of 13 episodes. In Planet Sundowin, Ultraman X and Geed were sent to apprehend Dark-killer after he terrorized the universe until their energies were stolen for the creation of X and Geed Darkness. The two copies defeated their counterparts and proceed to attack Orb on Planet O-50. Due to Zero's failure in protecting Grigio and ended up within the Dark-Killer Zone, the Ultra Brothers summon Rosso and Blu to their headquarters but they fly away before Taro can provide enough explanation, leading to their encounter with Etelgar. After saving a lone Ragon, Ribut bailed Rosso and Blu from Planet Penol whereas Victory and Ginga rescued Orb, X and Geed respectively. Taro explained Dark-Killer's origin: a being of darkness born from the grudges of past monsters that the Ultra Brothers fought before. Taro was able to defeat him with the Ultra Brothers' help, but Dark-Killer was revived, conscripting the resurrected Dark Lugiel and Etelgar to the League of Darkness as he create armies of evil Ultras for intergalactic conquest. Using Zero and Grigio as hostages, Dark-Killer goaded the New Generation Heroes to Planet Tenebris, which they did so despite the possibility of getting into a trap. Orb, Geed and X stay behind to fight their copies, Ginga and Victory faced Lugiel and Etelgar in the Dark Palace as Rosso and Blu entered the Dark-Killer Zone, only to be ambushed by the namesake villain himself. Meanwhile, Ribut unmasked Tregear as the mysterious benefactor of the League of Darkness and attempted to arrest him. Under memories of Ultraman Zero, the first five Ultras harnessed Zero's power to destroy their revived rivals. Grigio managed to muster enough strength to get pass Zero Darkness to recharge her brothers, giving them a chance of counterattack by forming Ultraman R/B and killing both Zero Darkness and Ultra Dark-Killer. In an attempt to gain advantage against the New Generation Heroes, Tregear revived Zero Darkness and Dark-Killer (the latter enlarged to 200 meters) before escaping from Ribut and send the Red Kings as his distraction. After transforming Zero into Zero Beyond for his fight with Zero Darkness, the New Generation Heroes accessed their strongest forms for the final battle. The insane Dark-Killer made his desperate attempt by recreating the evil Ultramen to consume them and grew larger. Under Taro's instructions, the New Generation Heroes charged the Strium Brace for Ginga Strium to perform New Generation Dynamite. While Dark-Killer's fate was guaranteed not to return, Zero revealed that Grigio's kidnapping was to prevent the formation of Groob. The only person other than the Ultras to know about this is none other than Tregear, who voiced his intent to attack the Land of Light and left immediately. The rest of the New Generation Heroes chased after the rogue Ultra as Zero sent Grigio back to her home world, wanting her to protect Ayaka City in her brothers' absence. ===Ultra Galaxy Fight: The Absolute Conspiracy=== The new series, was made in response to Tsuburaya Productions' YouTube channel receiving 1 million subscribers.

In an interview conducted by Tamashii Nations, Sakamoto revealed that the reason Galaxy Fight will be aired on YouTube is due to the overseas popularity of Ultra Series, with Asian region nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, while the real challenge comes in the series separating into 5 minutes per episodes. In comparison to television series, he found that spin-off series provided him with more creativity to generate ideas for the scene, with such example being Ultra Fight Orb's introduction to Lightning Attacker and Emerium Slugger. The inclusion of enemy characters such as Dark Lugiel, Etelgar, Ultra Dark Killer, X and Geed Darkness was already planned from the start as Hikaru Raido, the human host of Ultraman Ginga was chosen as the lead of New Generation Heroes due to his close image with a typical shonen manga protagonist. In September 24, 2019, Tsuburaya unveils additional information, such as synopsis, theme song, cast list and the appearance of Ultraman Ribut since his 2014 appearance in the Malaysian animation series Upin & Ipin. The Director's cut version of the entire series was initially released for limited screening in November 14, 2019 in Shinjuku Piccadilly Cinema. New Generation Heroes receive its Blu-ray and DVD releases on February 27, 2020, with the former includes director's cut version of certain scenes and commentary from the director Sakamoto himself. Limited releases in Amazon Japan will include a 2L Visual Sheet of Ultraman Geed Darkness.
