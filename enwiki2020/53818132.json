This programme was developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MOE), SingaporeMinistry of Education (Singapore) Home Page, \"Ministry of Education (Singapore)\", Retrieved on 5 April 2017. and is adapted from the Primary Mathematics Project developed by MOE. ==Aim of programme== The main aim of PR1ME is to nurture young learners and help them build strong mathematical foundation skills. It is based on the five practices listed in the pentagonMathematics (Primary) Syllabus, \"Ministry of Education (Singapore)\", 2007, Retrieved on 19 April 2017.Wong Khoon Yoong (Dr), Using the Pentagon Framework to Generate Questions to Assess Mathematics Learning, \"National Institute of Education\", 2014, Retrieved on 26 April 2017., which is the framework for mathematics instruction developed by the MOE with problem solving at its core. Mathematical Problem Solving Pentagon *Problem solving is centralJustine Ferrari, Kids get Asian lesson in maths, \"The Australian\", 12 April 2014, Retrieved on 27 April 2017.: Developing problem solving skills should address both the process and the method of solving problems. *Development of metacognition and mathematical thinking skills: Thinking mathematically is a conscious habit and should be developed through consistent use in many contexts. *Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract ApproachLeong Yew Hoong, Ho Weng Kin, Cheng Lu Pien, Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract, \"National institute of Education\", 2015, Retrieved on 26 April 2017.: Develops deep conceptual understanding through making meaningful connections between principles and symbols through concrete activities and visual representation, ensuring deep and long-lasting conceptual understanding. *Process of learning mathematics: Learning to mastery involves a focus on concept development and understanding mathematical relationships, and learning to inquire, communicate, reason, conceptualize, formulate and solve mathematical problems, appreciate the beauty of mathematics and apply mathematics in different contexts. *Consistent formative assessment: Assessment is a routine part of the on-going classroom activity. ==Approach== PR1ME's pedagogical approach and instructional design revolve around problem solving, and the development of metacognition and mathematical thinking skills. Problem solving is central with an emphasis on both the process and strategies, including the Bar Model methodYan Kow Cheong, The Model Method in Singapore, \"National Institute of Education\", 2002, Retrieved on 26 April 2017.. Process helps to build good habits for approaching mathematical problems of all levels of difficulty (UPAC \u2013 Understand, Plan, Answer, CheckP\u00f3lya, George, How to Solve It, \"Wikipedia\", Retrieved on 25 April 2017., Mind Stretchers) while strategies equip students to tackle different types of word problems (Heuristics, Mind Stretchers). The Bar Model method allows students to solve complex word problems using visual representation. Mathematical reasoning and problem posing allows students to be aware of their thought process, enabling them to become proficient problem solvers. Deep conceptual understanding is achieved through systematic teaching of mathematical concepts with a topic taught in-depth and over several lessons. ==See Also== :*Singapore Math :*Mathematics ==External Links== :* Scholastic PR1ME Mathematics Program :* Scholastic Asia Website :* Scholastic Website == Notes == ==References== * * Category:Scholastic Corporation Category:Mathematics education ",
