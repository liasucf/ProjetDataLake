    "text": "Bertha Nicoline Tuxen (14 November 1847 \u2013 5 April 1931) was a Danish painter of still lifes, flowers,and portraits. ==Life== Nicoline Tuxen was a daughter of the naval officer and director of the Orlogsv\u00e6rftet Nicolai Elias Tuxen (1810-1891) and his wife Bertha Laura Gi\u00f8dvad (1815-1908). Her younger brother was the sculptor and painter Laurits Tuxen. Since women were not allowed to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts before 1888, she took lessons with Vilhelm Kyhn at his private drawing school for women (Tegneskolen for Kvinder), which existed between 1865 and 1895. Several study trips led her later to Paris. In 1891 she was awarded the Neuhausen Prize (De Neuhausenske Pr\u00e6mier) and in 1893 with a scholarship from the Royal Academy. Nicoline Tuxen was regularly represented at the prestigious Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition (For\u00e5rsudstilling) in Copenhagen from the middle of the 1880s.Tuxen, Nicoline. In: Weilbachs Kunstnerleksikon Further exhibitions with her participation were, for example, the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois., an exhibition in Antwerp 1894 and the \"Nordische Kunstausstellung\" L\u00fcbeck 1895. She mainly painted flower pictures and still life, in later years also portraits. Their works bear the unmistakable stamp of the Danish Golden Age of painting. Nicoline Tuxen remained unmarried, she died in Frederiksberg at the age of 83 and was buried at the Holmens Cemetery in Copenhagen. ==Gallery== Nicoline Tuxen - An old cottage in \u00d8stofte.jpg|Nicoline Tuxen An old cottage in \u00d8stofte Nicoline Tuxen - Still life with branches in bloom.jpg|Nicoline Tuxen Still life with branches in bloom Nicoline Tuxen - Flowers, 1886.jpg|Nicoline Tuxen Flowers, 1886 Nicoline Tuxen - Portrait of a woman reading in bed.jpg|Nicoline Tuxen Portrait of a woman reading in bed ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Tuxen, Nicoline.
