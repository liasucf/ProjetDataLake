    "text": "Peel Region municipal elections, 2018, were part of the larger Ontario municipal elections, that took place on Monday, October 22. After ballots were cast, Patrick Brown was elected as the mayor of Brampton, Bonnie Crombie re- elected as the mayor of Mississauga and Allan Thompson re-elected as the mayor of Caledon. The election was intended to be the first ever direct election of the Peel Regional chair. However, the election of this position was cancelled after the Doug Ford government introduced The Better Local Government Act, 2018 (Bill 5) in August 2018. ==Open races== Jim Tovey, Mississauga councillor for Ward 1, died suddenly in January 2018. Tovey was in the midst of planning for massive waterfront redevelopment. In February 2018, Brampton councillor Chris Gibson announced his retirement in Wards 1 & 5\\. Officially a city councillor, he had been given the city's additional Regional seat for multiple terms. Regional councillor Elaine Moore, from the same wards, announced her retirement in late March. Gael Miles retirement was made public the evening before the start of registration. Caledon's Doug Beffort retired. ==Peel Region chair== ===Original nomination process=== In 2016, the provincial Liberal government announced voters in the 2018 election would elect regional chairs. Across the province, the selection of regional chairs varies, with some regional councils electing chairs while other chairs being selected by councillors. Peel Region traditionally appointed the regional chair from existing councillors. In early 2018, the candidates for the position of regional chair began to be nominated. Starting the year \"85% sure\" he would run, Ron Starr officially announced his intention to run for Regional Chair in late March 2018. Later, after the cancellation of the position, Starr withdrew to run for re-election in Ward 6. Rumours that were circulating of Patrick Brown running for Regional chair were neither confirmed or denied, when asked by Metroland in May 2018. Brown was accused of sexual misconduct in January, which he denies, forcing his resignation as Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader. He moved to Mississauga after being removed from the party caucus. He did not run for re-election as a Barrie MPP in the June provincial election. Patrick Brown also withdrew from the race. Mississauga councillor Nando Iannicca enrolled in July. Bob Delaney, former MPP for Mississauga- Streetsville, registered in July. Charles Sousa and Harinder Takhar, also former MPPs, agreed to not run, in an effort to not split the vote. Registered candidates included: * Amir S. Ali, Brampton * Parveen Dalal, Mississauga * Bob Delaney, Mississauga * Vitya Sagar Gautam, Brampton * Marcin Huniewicz, Brampton * Nando Iannicca, Mississauga * Masood Khan, Brampton * Ken Looy, Brampton * Gurpreet Pabla, Brampton A shift in Ontario's government after the provincial elections, saw Doug Ford announce the cancellation of the voter elected position of regional chair in Peel. While this prompted Brown to pull his Chair nomination, to run for Mayor of Brampton, Delaney continued his campaign, noting that the law had yet to pass. Incumbent Frank Dale has indicated he may change his mind on retirement, according to The Mississauga News. ===Appointment process=== TVO journalist Steve Paikin has heard suggestion of the following candidates: * Nando Iannicca * Linda Jeffrey * Gael Miles * Elaine Moore * Charles Sousa Former Caledon Regional councillor Barb Shaughnessy, who had run for Mayor of Caledon, indicated that she would not be pursuing the position. ==Brampton== Brampton had 313,273 eligible voters during the 2018 election. A total of 169 voting locations were open across the city. ===Mayor=== In October 2017, incumbent Brampton Mayor Linda Jeffrey announced her intent to run for a second term. Real estate lawyer Wesley Jackson was noted in a February 2018 Peel Daily News article as \"hoping to become Brampton's next mayor.\"Marco Patrone, \"Brampton residents okay with paying higher property taxes, says mayoralty candidate\", Peel Daily News, 21 February 2018, page 6. In July, John Sprovieri announced his intention to run for Mayor of Brampton. Omar Mansoury withdrew. On Election Day on October 22, Patrick Brown was declared the winner. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#ddf; width:200px;\"| Mayoral Candidate ! style=\"background:#ddf; width:50px;\"| Vote ! style=\"background:#ddf; width:30px;\"| % |- |Patrick Brown ||46,894||44.43 |- | Linda Jeffrey (X) || 42,993|| 40.73 |- | Baljit Gosal || 5,319|| 5.04 |- | John Sprovieri || 5,028||4.76 |- | Wesley Jackson || 2,442|| 2.31 |- | Vinod Kumar Mahesan || 1,905||1.80 |- | Mansoor Ameersulthan ||972 |0.92 |} ====Debates==== Brampton Board of Trade is hosting debates of city council candidates throughout the day on September 17, 2018, through live stream, concluding with a Mayoral debate.
