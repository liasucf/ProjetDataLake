He was later created an officer of the Legion d'Honneur, both for his war record, and for his work as principal of a school. Debry was born in Rosi\u00e8res-en-Santerre (Somme). He was a soldier in the First World War. After the war, he met Marguerite, the woman he later married on 12 August 1924 in his home town. In 2005, Andr\u00e9 and Marguerite Debry were able to celebrate their 81st wedding anniversary; this set a record for the longest marriage. They lived together in Argenton-sur-Creuse until his death, aged 107. She died four months afterwards, aged 102. ==References== ==See also== Category:1898 births Category:2005 deaths Category:French centenarians Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
