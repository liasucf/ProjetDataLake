It struck a tree and crashed at White's Farm near Broadway Pound, six miles from the airfield. It burst into flames with the loss of the five-man crew (all but one were Polish) and 22 Army passengers. == Investigation == The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error. The captain completed the first turn to the left after takeoff about 700 feet too low, at about 800 feet instead of the minimum 1,500 feet as mentioned in the departure procedures. Low visibility and poor weather conditions were considered as contributory factors. ==See also== * 1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash ==References== * Category:Accidents and incidents involving Royal Air Force aircraft Broadway Consolidated Liberator crash Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in England Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:1945 in England Category:1945 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:November 1945 events ",
