Some 80 out of 152 lawmakers of the Uri Party joined the new party, a conservative-liberal minority group from the Hannara Party (led by Son Hak-Gyu), and a group of progressive civil rights' group from outside South Korean politics also joined, seeking to complete political reforms. As a result of merge with the Uri Party, this party has been ranked as the biggest political party in the legislative by 140 of 298 seats (as of January 14, 2008). After receiving a 'shocked' result at the 2007 presidential election, the delegates of its party decided to elect a new leader, with adopting a 'Papal conclave'-style system. On January 11, with more than a half delegates' vote, Son Hak-Gyu was elected to lead at the 2008 parliamentary election.Sohn Hak-kyu chosen to lead United New Democratic Party, the Hankyoreh, Retrieved on January 11, 2008 ==Principles of policies== This party's platform emphasized these 4 key ideologies.Official Platform of the UNDP (Korean), the UNDP, Retrieved on August 7, 2007 * Democracy * Peace * Integration (political) * Environmentalism ==Presidential election primary== ===Timeline=== These list of key events has been managed by its public primary election committee(\uad6d\ubbfc\uacbd\uc120\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c).The process of UNDP primary, Public primary election committee of the UNDP, 2007 *August 21 and August 22, 2007 - Official announcement has been made by its committee.
