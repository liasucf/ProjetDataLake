    "text": "The Beebe Railroad Station is a historic railroad station building located on Center Street in Beebe, Arkansas. It is a single-story brick building, with a broad hip roof with overhanging eaves supported by large brackets. It was built in 1910 by the Missouri-Pacific Railroad, and is one of the best- preserved of this type of station in the state. It is also a reminder of the importance of the railroad in Beebe's original development, which was entirely dependent on the railroad. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1910 Category:Buildings and structures in Beebe, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in White County, Arkansas Category:Former Missouri Pacific Railroad stations Category:1910 establishments in Arkansas Category:Former railway stations in Arkansas ",
