    "text": "\"Maybe Tomorrow\" is a hit single recorded by American soul family quintet The Jackson 5, in 1971. The ballad was originally supposed to have been sung (possibly in a different production) by Sammy Davis, Jr. but for various reasons, the entertainer could not get on the schedule to do the song and the song was then given to the Jackson 5. It peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart, and at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is the first single by The Jackson 5 not to reach the top five of the Pop charts. \"Maybe Tomorrow\" was included on the Jackson 5's album of the same title, and was later sampled by rapper Ghostface Killah on his 1996 song \"All That I Got Is You\". The song was released again in 2009 via a Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers' remix, with an orchestral arrangement by Rob Mounsey, from a compilation album The Remix Suite. ==Personnel== *Lead vocals by Michael Jackson *Background vocals by Jermaine Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Jackie Jackson, Tito Jackson *Instruments by Motown Musicians == UB40 version== English reggae band UB40 recorded a reggae-style cover version in 1987. This was released as a single, peaking at #14 in the UK Official Chart, and appeared on their Greatest Hits album released the same year. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1971) !Peak position |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|20 |- |U.S. Billboard Best Selling Soul Singles |align=\"center\"|3 |- |} ==References== ==External links== Category:1971 singles Category:The Jackson 5 songs Category:Songs written by Berry Gordy Category:Songs written by Freddie Perren Category:Songs written by Deke Richards Category:1971 songs Category:Songs written by Alphonzo Mizell ",
