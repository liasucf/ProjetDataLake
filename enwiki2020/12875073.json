    "text": "C\u00fala4 () is an Irish language programming block and a stand-alone television channel for Irish speaking children in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is operated by TG4. ==Development== The strand was first established in 1996 as C\u00falab\u00fala; with the rebrand of TnaG to TG4 in 1999 C\u00falab\u00fala was renamed \"C\u00fala4\". As of 1 September 2009 C\u00fala4 is available as a separate channel to Virgin Media Ireland customers on channel 602. A new schedule coincided with the launch on UPC. The majority of programming is a mixture of homegrown and international programmes which are either dubbed or subtitled in Irish. C\u00fala4 works with international broadcasters to produce Irish versions of hit TV series which are seen on Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and PBS. It also works with homegrown animation companies to produce localized series. C\u00fala4 offers something unique in an already saturated kids television market in Ireland with the existence of RT\u00c9jr/TRT\u00c9, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and the Disney Channel. C\u00fala4's programming is either in Irish or in Irish and English, unlike its competition where the majority of their programmes are entirely in English. ==C\u00fala4 ar Scoil== An educational programme, C\u00fala4 Ar Scoil (\"C\u00fala 4 at School\"), was created in April 2020, in response to the closure of all schools during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland in 2020. This followed RT\u00c9's launch of its Home School Hub in March 2020. It is recorded in Connemara, with teachers Caitriona ni Chualain and Fiachra O Dubhghaill presenting daily lessons for the 30-minute show. A second series began in September. ==C\u00fala 4 strands== *C\u00daLA4 NA n\u00d3G: airing between 07:00 - 14:00 is a programming block targeting pre-school children ages 2 to 5, it airs series such as Elmo's World, Tar ag Spraoi Sesame, Dora the Explorer (in Irish, teaching Spanish), Ni Hao Kai Lan, Franny's Feet, Dive, Olly, Dive, and The Mr. Men Show.
