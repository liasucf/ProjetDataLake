It has become a popular feature for hair coloring, nail art, and even baking, in addition to its uses in home decorating and graphic design. In contrast to ombr\u00e9, sombr\u00e9 is a much softer and gradual shading of one color to another.https://www.arsova.com/balayage-vs-flamboyage-vs-ombre-vs-sombre-vs- foiling ==In fashion== ===History=== Using shading or creating an ombr\u00e9 effect is ubiquitous. For instance in fabric printing, a special printing block, called a \"rainbowed\" block, was used in the early 19th century to produce textiles with graduated color designs. Ombr\u00e9 as a textile treatment came back into fashion in around 1840 and was used throughout the 19th century. In machine embroidery, an ombr\u00e9 effect was achieved by dyeing the threads in graded colors beforehand. ===21st century=== Khloe Kardashian with ombr\u00e9 hair, 2011 Ombr\u00e9 as a hair-coloring technique is believed to have been popularised in 2000 when Britney Spears had her hair dyed in a subtle gradual fade from black at the roots to lighter towards the hair tips. It also was popularized in 2001 when Aaliyah dyed her hair ombr\u00e9. , the ombr\u00e9 hair trend was still popular. The style has been adopted by many celebrities, such as Lucy Hale, Alexa Chung, Lauren Conrad, Nicole Kidman, Beyonc\u00e9, and even Jared Leto, among others. One stylist found that the ombr\u00e9 hairstyle requires very little upkeep, making it easier for it to remain on trend. While ombre was initially the gradual lightening of the hair from dark to light, it has expanded to take on various other techniques, including the fading of a natural color from the roots to a more unnatural color (such as turquoise or lavender) at the tips. The popularization of ombr\u00e9 hair encouraged the spread of this technique to other facets of beauty, such as nail art. The adoption of the ombr\u00e9 nails trend by celebrities such as Lauren Conrad, Victoria Beckham, and Katy Perry, helped popularise it. == Home == A cake with purple ombr\u00e9 frosting Following the early 21st-century trend, many popular home decorators have incorporated ombr\u00e9 into their home decorating styles. Ombr\u00e9 can be used in many products from textiles to glassware, and as a wall-painting technique, where walls are painted in colors graduating to a lighter or darker tone towards the other end. Martha Stewart describes the gentle progression of color in ombr\u00e9 as a transition from wakefulness to slumber. David Kohn Architects have explored the ombr\u00e9 effect in the design of the floor tiling of the interior of an apartment, Carrer Aviny\u00f3, Barcelona. The tile pattern is graded in colour from green at one end of the apartment to red at the other to differentiate the two owners' private spaces. The encaustic tiles were manufactured by Mosaics Mart\u00ed, suppliers of tiles to Antoni Gaud\u00ed. == Baking == In baking, ombr\u00e9 effects are typically achieved through applied techniques such as frosting on a cake, but baking individual cake layers in graduated tones from light to dark is possible. The effect can also be achieved by dyeing and stacking the layers of a cake in the ombr\u00e9 fade. == Makeup == Due to the colour range available for different types of cosmetic products, an ombr\u00e9 effect can be achieved by blending two or more shades together on the eyes, lips, or cheeks. The gradient from dark to light is similar to the practice of contouring, where different tints and shades of natural skin tones are blended, but differs in that contouring is often intended to artificially sculpt the face, whereas ombr\u00e9 can be said to simply mean the blending of any two or more shades, natural or otherwise. ==See also== *Color gradient ==References== ==External links== * Ombre Hair Guide Category:Painting techniques Category:Hairstyles Category:Hair color Category:19th-century fashion Category:20th-century fashion Category:2000s fashion Category:2010s fashion Category:Textile printing Category:Textile arts ",
