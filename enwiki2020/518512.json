Many of the species are found in central and southern China, with a few species in northern Indochina and in the Himalayas. Some of the species have become naturalized in parts of Asia, Australia, the Americas, and southern Europe.Flora of China Vol. 22 Page 163 \u521a\u7af9\u5c5e gang zhu shu Phyllostachys Siebold & Zuccarini, Abh. Math.-Phys. Cl. K\u00f6nigl. Bayer. Akad. Wiss. 3: 745. 1843. The stem or culm has a prominent groove, called a sulcus, that runs along the length of each segment (or internode). Because of this, it is one of the most easily identifiable genera of bamboo. Most of the species spread aggressively by underground rhizomes. Some species of Phyllostachys grow to 100 ft (30 m) tall in optimum conditions. Some of the larger species, sometimes known as \"timber bamboo\", are used as construction timber and for making furniture. Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants, though they can become invasive and troublesome in gardens, unless artificially restricted or grown in containers. The name Phyllostachys means \"leaf spike\" and refers to the inflorescences. Some of the smaller species can be grown as bonsai. ==Taxonomy== ;SpeciesThe Plant List search for Phyllostachys ;Formerly included species now considered better suited to other genera: Bambusa Chimonobambusa Pseudosasa Semiarundinaria Shibataea ==Ecology== Fungi and pathogens growing specifically on Phyllostachys have phyllostachydis or phyllostachydicola species epithets. ==Regulations== Connecticut property owners are liable for the cost of removing Phyllostachys bamboo that grows onto neighboring property, any resulting damages, and fines of $100 per day for growing this bamboo within 40 ft of any adjoining property or public way. New York has proposed regulations listing P. aurea and P. aureosulcata as prohibited invasive species. ==References== * Zheng-ping Wang & Chris Stapleton Flora of China, Volume 22: Poaceae., Science Press u. a., Beijing u. a. 20 ==External links== * * http://delta-intkey.com/grass/www/phyllost.htm Category:Bambusoideae genera Category:Grasses of Asia Category:Garden plants of Asia Category:Taxa named by Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini ",
