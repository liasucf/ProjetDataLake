    "text": "Coming Out is the third album by The Manhattan Transfer, released August 19, 1976 on Atlantic Records. On the advice of their manager Aaron Russo, the group downplayed the \"nostalgic\" tenor of their previous breakthrough album in favor of more contemporary songs. However, the throwback single \"Chanson d'Amour\" became a breakout single in Europe and hit the No. 1 spot in the United Kingdom for three weeks (as well as charting elsewhere in Europe). The song \"Zindy Lou\" featured Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner on drums, Dr. John on piano, and Doug Thorngren on percussion. The song \"Poinciana (The Song of the Tree)\" featured a solo by Michael Brecker. ==Charts== Coming Out debuted on Billboard's Top Pop Album chart on September 18, 1976 and peaked at No. 48. ==Track listing== === LP side 1 === # \"Don't Let Go\" (Jesse Stone) - 2:45 # \"Zindy Lou\" (Johnny Moore, Eddie Smith) \u2013 2:50 # \"Chanson D'Amour\" (Wayne Shanklin) \u2013 2:55 # \"Helpless\" (Holland-Dozier-Holland) \u2013 3:07 # \"Scotch and Soda\" (Dave Guard) \u2013 2:59 # \"The Speak Up Mambo (Cuentame)\" (Al Castellanos) \u2013 3:05 === LP side 2 === # \"Poinciana (The Song of the Tree)\" (Nat Simon, Buddy Bernier) \u2013 4:11 # \"S.O.S.\" (Ron Roker, Gerry Shury, Phil Swern) - 3:10 # \"Popsicle Toes\" (Michael Franks) \u2013 4:16 # \"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\" (Todd Rundgren) \u2013 3:30 # \"The Thought of Loving You\" (David White) \u2013 2:56 The album was re-released on CD in March 1993. == Personnel == The Manhattan Transfer * Tim Hauser \u2013 vocals, vocal arrangements (1-4, 6, 8, 11), song concept (7) * Laurel Mass\u00e9 \u2013 vocals, vocal arrangements (1, 4, 10) * Alan Paul \u2013 vocals, vocal arrangements (1, 11), song concept (7) * Janis Siegel \u2013 vocals, vocal arrangements (1-8, 10, 11) Musicians * Paul Griffin \u2013 organ (1) * Dr. John \u2013 acoustic piano (2) * John Barnes \u2013 acoustic piano (3) * Steve Paietta \u2013 accordion (3) * Clarence McDonald \u2013 acoustic piano (4, 8) * Bill Payne \u2013 acoustic piano (5, 10) * Roger Steinman \u2013 acoustic piano (5) * Arthur Jenkins \u2013 acoustic piano (6), arrangements (6) * Dave Frishberg \u2013 acoustic piano (9), clavinet (9) * Mike Melvoin \u2013 acoustic piano (11) * Ira Newborn \u2013 guitar, orchestral arrangements, musical director, vocal arrangements (5, 9), electric autoharp (10) * Ben Benay \u2013 guitar (3) * Bob Bowles \u2013 rhythm guitar (9, 10) * Andy Muson \u2013 bass * Roy Markowitz \u2013 drums (1, 6) * Jim Keltner \u2013 drums (2, 8) * Ringo Starr \u2013 drums (2, 8) * Jim Gordon \u2013 drums (3, 9) * Rick Shlosser \u2013 drums (4, 11) * Jim Nelson \u2013 drums (5) * David Kemper \u2013 drums (10) * Bobbye Hall \u2013 percussion (1), congas (10) * Doug Thorngren \u2013 percussion (2) * Ralph MacDonald \u2013 percussion (4, 11), congas (6) * Nicky Marrero \u2013 timbales (6) * Johnny \"Dandy\" Rodriguez Jr \u2013 bongos (6), cowbell (6) * Michael Brecker \u2013 tenor saxophone (1) * Jay Migliori \u2013 tenor sax solo (3) * Jackie Kelso \u2013 baritone sax solo (4), tenor sax solo (8) * Randy Brecker \u2013 trumpet (1) === Production === * Richard Perry \u2013 producer * Tim Hauser \u2013 assistant producer * Douglas Botnick \u2013 engineer * Lewis Hahn \u2013 engineer * Rick Rowe \u2013 engineer * Howard Steele \u2013 engineer, remixing * Dennis Devlin \u2013 assistant engineer * Dan Latham \u2013 assistant engineer * Tim Sadler \u2013 assistant engineer * Allen Zentz \u2013 mastering * Bob Defrin \u2013 art direction, design * Abie Sussman \u2013 art direction, design * Suze Randall \u2013 cover photography ==References== ==External links== * Manhattan Transfer official website Category:1976 albums Category:The Manhattan Transfer albums Category:Albums produced by Richard Perry Category:Atlantic Records albums ",
