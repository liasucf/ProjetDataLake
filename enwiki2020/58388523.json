Richard attended St.Marys RC Primary school, St. Thomas Moore Secondary school in Eltham and Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar school. Quinn is the youngest of five children to parents Eileen and Patrick Quinn. Following this he enrolled onto the MA Fashion course at Central Saint Martins where he was awarded the Stella McCartney Scholarship and graduated in February 2016. == Career == In 2016 his graduate collection won the H&M; Design Award, including a \u20ac50,000 cash prize, and he developed pieces from his winning collection that were later sold in selected H&M; stores in Autumn 2017. The collection proved a hit selling out in store and online. In April 2017 he was named as the British Fashion Council's NEWGEN one-to-watch and was awarded exhibition space in the LFW Designer Showrooms. Later in the year he was awarded full NEWGEN sponsorship for the following season to enable him to show at London Fashion Week. On February 20, 2018, Queen Elizabeth II attended Quinn's Autumn/Winter 2018 runway show at London Fashion Week. This marked the first time that the Queen had attended a commercial runway show. After the show finished, Caroline Rush, Chief Executive of the British Fashion Council introduced the Queen who presented Quinn with the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design. On May 7, 2018 Amal Clooney, wife of actor George Clooney, created a stir when she chose to wear a Quinn design to the Met Gala in New York' Metropolitan Museum of Art, instead of a gown designed by Tom Ford's fashion team, which was the original plan. Clooney's choice helped bring Quinn to the attention of the international fashion world. In May 2018 Quinn launched an 11-piece capsule range in conjunction with high street retailer Debenhams. Quinn's stockists include Liberty of London, Matches Fashion and Machine A. == Awards == * 2018 - British Fashion Award - Emerging Talent Women's Wear at the Fashion Awards. * 2018 - Queen Elizabeth II Award * 2016 - H&M; Design Award ==References== == External links == * Official Website Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:Fashion designers from London ",
