    "text": "The men's modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was held on 19 August. Three venues were used: Deodoro Aquatics Centre (swimming), Deodoro Stadium (horse-riding and combined running and shooting) and Youth Arena (fencing). The medals were presented by Timothy Fok, IOC member, Hong Kong and Klaus Schormann, President of the UIPM. == Competition format == The modern pentathlon consisted of five events, all held on the same day. The format was slightly different from the typical modern pentathlon, with two events combined at the end. * Fencing: A round-robin, one-touch \u00e9p\u00e9e competition. Score was based on winning percentage. * Swimming: A 200 m freestyle race. Score was based on time. * Riding: A show jumping competition. Score based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit. * Combined running/shooting: A 3 km run with pistol shooting (the athlete must hit five targets in 70 seconds) every kilometre. Starts were staggered based on points from the previous three events. == Schedule == All times are UTC-3 {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Time !Round |- |Thursday, 18 August 2016 |14:30 |Fencing (Ranking Round) |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Saturday, 20 August 2016 |12:00 |Swimming |- |14:00 |Fencing (Bonus Round) |- |15:30 |Riding |- |18:00 |Combined running/shooting |} == Results == Thirty-six athletes participated. ;Key: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !data-sort-type=number|Rank !Country !Athlete !Swimming Time (pts) !Fencing Victories (pts) !Riding Time (pts) !Combined Time (pts) !Total |- | |align=left| |align=left|Aleksander Lesun |2:05.58 (324) |bgcolor=#F2F5A9|28 (268)\u2666 OR |71.02 (279) |11:32.35 (608) |1479 OR |- | |align=left| |align=left|Pavlo Tymoshchenko |2:05.59 (324) |21 (227) |65.43 (286) |11:05.74 (635) |1472 |- | |align=left| |align=left|Ismael Hern\u00e1ndez |2:02.12 (334) |18 (208) |71.78 (300) |11:14.33 (626) |1468 |- |4 |align=left| |align=left|Valentin Prades |2:04.44 (327) |21 (227) |77.92 (277) |11:04.08 (636) |1467 |- |5 |align=left| |align=left|Riccardo De Luca |2:09.36 (312) |20 (222) |71.56 (300) |11:07.23 (633) |1467 |- |6 |align=left| |align=left|Patrick Dogue |2:07.65 (318) |25 (240) |80.73 (288) |11:23.36 (617) |1463 |- |7 |align=left| |align=left|Max Esposito |1:59.71 (341) |14 (185) |74.39 (300) |11:04.99 (636) |1462 |- |8 |align=left| |align=left|Arthur Lanigan-O'Keeffe |2:03.03 (331) |16 (198) |74.83 (300) |11:12.21 (628) |1457 |- |9 |align=left| |align=left|David Svoboda |2:05.59 (324) |21 (226) |79.48 (282) |11:20.92 (620) |1452 |- |10 |align=left| |align=left|Joseph Choong |1:58.50 (345) |22 (224) |70.31 (293) |11:51.59 (589) |1451 |- |11 |align=left| |align=left|Nathan Schrimsher |2:00.87 (338) |20 (220) |79.42 (282) |11:30.76 (610) |1450 |- |12 |align=left| |align=left|\u00c1d\u00e1m Marosi |2:01.66 (335) |16 (196) |67.87 (293) |11:19.84 (621) |1445 |- |13 |align=left| |align=left|Jung Jin-hwa |2:00.82 (338) |17 (203) |78.75 (283) |11:21.80 (619) |1443 |- |14 |align=left| |align=left|James Cooke |bgcolor=#F2F5A9| 1:55.60 (354)\u2666 OR |14 (185) |80.48 (288) |11:31.07 (609) |1436 |- |15 |align=left| |align=left|Charles Fernandez |2:03.18 (331) |16 (214) |80.58 (271) |11:21.49 (619) |1435 |- |16 |align=left| |align=left|Cao Zhongrong |2:00.08 (340) |17 (204) |74.31 (300) |11:51.14 (589) |1433 |- |17 |align=left| |align=left|Bence Demeter |2:03.89 (329) |19 (217) |74.62 (265) |11:21.98 (619) |1430 |- |18 |align=left| |align=left|Guo Jianli |2:01.94 (335) |19 (214) |73.06 (286) |11:46.21 (594) |1429 |- |19 |align=left| |align=left|Jun Woong-tae |2:00.88 (338) |13 (178) |73.91 (272) |bgcolor=#F2F5A9|11:02.50 (638) \u2666 OR |1426 |- |20 |align=left| |align=left|Valentin Belaud |2:07.83 (317) |19 (216) |74.31 (286) |11:39.37 (601) |1420 |- |21 |align=left| |align=left|Christian Zillekens |2:06.24 (322) |16 (196) |75.90 (286) |11:27.45 (613) |1417 |- |22 |align=left| |align=left|Tomoya Miguchi |2:02.62 (333) |20 (220) |80.30 (281) |12:02.88 (578) |1412 |- |23 |align=left| |align=left|Omar El Geziry |2:03.62 (330) |23 (239) |75.10 (265) |12:11.94 (569) |1403 |- |24 |align=left| |align=left|Pier Paolo Petroni |2:05.51 (324) |13 (179) |75.94 (293) |11:39.60 (601) |1397 |- |25 |align=left| |align=left|Amro El Geziry |1:55.80 (353) |18 (208) |77.23 (291) |12:39.19 (541) |1393 |- |26 |align=left| |align=left|Andriy Fedechko |2:05.63 (324) |16 (198) |79.49 (275) |11:47.68 (593) |1390 |- |27 |align=left| |align=left|Szymon Sta\u015bkiewicz |2:10.16 (310) |21 (227) |73.44 (258) |11:45.88 (595) |1390 |- |28 |align=left| |align=left|Ruslans Nakonechnyi |2:03.83 (329) |13 (180) |72.45 (272) |11:35.70 (605) |1386 |- |29 |align=left| |align=left|Shohei Iwamoto |2:08.65 (315) |09 (154) |bgcolor=#F2F5A9|74.90 (300) \u2666 |11:54.59 (586) |1355 |- |30 |align=left| |align=left|Emmanuel Zapata |2:06.66 (320) |11 (166) |77.50 (277) |12:03.19 (577) |1340 |- |31 |align=left| |align=left|Felipe Nascimento |2:05.39 (324) |09 (155) |75.72 (251) |12:15.59 (565) |1295 |- |32 |align=left| |align=left|Jose Ricardo Figueroa |2:15.39 (294) |09 (156) |122.31 (233) |12:49.13 (531) |1214 |- |33 |align=left| |align=left|Dimitar Krastanov |2:04.96 (326) |19 (215) | |11:02.95 (638) |1179 |- |34 |align=left| |align=left|Justinas Kinderis |2:06.84 (320) |18 (211) | |11:27.33 (613) |1144 |- |35 |align=left| |align=left|Pavel Ilyashenko |2:06.19 (322) |18 (208) | |11:29.79 (611) |1141 |- |36 |align=left| |align=left|Jan Kuf |2:05.84 (323) |19 (215) | |12:15.62 (565) |1103 |} ==Records== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=\"5\"|Broken Olympic records during the 2016 Summer Olympics |- |Total | |1479 pts. |- |Swimming | |align=right|1:55.60 |- |Combined | |align=right|11:02.50 |- |Running | |10:20.18 |- |Shooting - 1 session of 5 shots | |7.39 |- |Shooting - 4 session of 20 shots | |34.08 |} ==References== Category:Modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics ",
