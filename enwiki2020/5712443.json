    "text": "Energoatom, full name National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine () is a Ukrainian state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in Ukraine.Energoatom chief Kim overstepped his powers when signing contract, failed to show up for questioning, says interior minister, Interfax-Ukraine (12 June 2013) As of 2016, Energoatom had an installed capacity of 14,148 MW and generated 81.2 TWh of electricity. ==Overview== Ukraine ranks seventh in the world and fifth in Europe in terms of the number of nuclear reactors operated, total capacity and electricity produced. The Ukrainian nuclear power industry employs more than 38,000 people. In recent years, using only 69.0% of the installed capacity, nuclear power plants have under maximum autumn and winter loads generated about 53% of the country's electricity. Overall the share of electricity generation is about 47%. Currently there are 15 operating power units, including 13 units with VVER-1000 (PWR) reactors, and 2 units of the newer subtype of the VVER-440 reactor. Energoatom is engaged in construction of new power units and rehabilitation of those in operation, purchases of nuclear fuel and removal of radioactive waste, establishing a national infrastructure for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, maintenance of safety at nuclear facilities, retraining and qualification upgrades, and resolution of social problems of the employees. According to the Energy Strategy of Ukraine, NNEGC Energoatom plans to: * select 3\u20134 new sites for construction of new NPPs; * develop a feasibility study for construction of power units to a total capacity of 6 GW on new sites during 2019\u20132021; * substantiate and make a decision on service life extension of the pilot reactor Rivne Unit 1 and subsequently the rest of the fleet depending upon design service life termination periods; * commission Khmelnitsky Unit 2 and Unit 3 for a total capacity of 2 GW by the year 2016. In the longer term, the company intends to: * put into operation replacement and additional power units to total capacity of 12.5 GW from 2024 through 2030; * launch decommissioning activities for six power units once their extended service life terminates; * initiate construction of new capacities rated in total at 6.5 GW in 2027\u20132030 to allow for commissioning after 2030. ===Presidents=== * 2000 \u2013 2002 Yuriy Nedashkovskyi * 2002 \u2013 2005 Serhiy Tulub * 2005 \u2013 2006 Yuriy Nedashkovskyi * 2006 \u2013 2007 Andrii Derkach * 2008 \u2013 2012 Yuriy Nedashkovskyi * 2014 \u2013 2019 Yuriy Nedashkovskyi * 2019 \u2013 present Pavlo Pavlyshyn ==Recent history== In 2011 Energoatom began a project to bring safety into line with international standards at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, with a target completion date of 2017. In 2015 the completion date was put back to 2020, due to financing delays. In 2015 some government agencies made corruption allegations against Energoatom, with concerns raised by Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. In March 2016, Energoatom's assets and bank accounts were frozen by Ukrainian courts over allegedly unpaid debts; Energoatom is appealing the decision, but the frozen finances have led to contractual breaches. In June 2016 its bank accounts were unfrozen. ===2019 wholesale market and management changes=== In July 2019, a new wholesale energy market for Ukraine was launched, intended to bring real competition in the generation market and help future integration with Europe. The change was a prerequisite for receiving European Union assistance. It led to in increased price for industrial consumers of between 14% to 28% during July. The bulk of Energoatom output is sold to the government's \"guaranteed buyer\" to keep prices more stable for domestic customers. On 27 November 2019, Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk announced the dismissal of Energoatom head Yuriy Nedashkovskyi. The Ministry of Energy website later stated the dismissal was \"for reasons including inefficient management, suspicion of embezzlement of state funds and mismanagement of procurement.\" Energoatom subsequently issued a press release rebutting these charges. On 4 December 2019, Ukraine's government appointed Pavlo Pavlyshyn as acting head of Energoatom. During January 2020 Energoatom discussed eight legislative bills with Ostap Shipailo, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament subcommittee on nuclear energy and safety, aimed at meeting international obligations and standards, and the financial stabilisation of Energoatom. In and after January 2020 three long-standing vice presidents were replaced. On 6 May 2020 the Ukrainian Cabinet appointed Herman Galushchenko, a lawyer, vice-president for long-term development and Hartmut Jakob, a financier and energy sector specialist, as vice-president of the financial and economic department. This followed months of disputes as to whether the posts should go to nuclear specialists from inside Energoatom or not, during a difficult financial period for the company. In early 2020 mounting debts caused Energoatom to adjust its new fuel delivery schedule. No purchases of Westinghouse nuclear fuel were made in the first quarter. Energoatom has fuel stocks for a year of refuelling. The difficult financial condition is caused by late payments by the 'Guaranteed Buyer' under the new wholesale market regulations. Energoatom wants to be allowed to increase bilateral contract sales from 5% to 50% of generation. ==List of companies== ===Nuclear Power Stations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Location !
