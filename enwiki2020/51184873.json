It very much works within the established structure of the genre, but it never allows itself to get lazy within that structure. It sets out to earn every moment, to convince the audience at every turn that this relationship is worth fighting for, that every problem that they face is a genuine tragedy. This is a film that believes that love is always a story worth telling, and not just some component of a larger commercial proposition.\" Nazamel Tabares of Movies Philippines rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that \"How to Be Yours is my most favorite Dan Villegas film to date.\" He added that \"the shots are beautiful, the story is smooth and clean and the direction is precise. How to Be Yours is the perfect mainstream romantic film, it doesn\u2019t go big with its confrontations and goes simple but realistic with its dialogues. It may be a surprise as romantic comedies are just something we usually have in Philippine cinemas but How to Be Yours definitely wants to be remembered and it does everything impeccably.\" Oggs Cruz of Rappler in a very positive review wrote that \"How To Be Yours is conventional entertainment done right. It enthralls without a lot of the pandering to the cheap thrills that commonly pervade romances.\" Meanwhile, Eric T. Cabahug of InterAksyon.com noted and praised Bea Alonzo's performance saying that, \"Bea Alonzo is even better, handling her showier and more layered role \u2014 a young woman who blossoms from being an insecure underachiever into a driven, ballsy careerist \u2014 with maturity and sophistication.\" Je C.C. of Philippine Entertainment Portal wrote that \"Both Bea and Gerald are able to deliver commendable performances here, playing as lovers whose commitments are pulled into the opposing poles of love and career. How To Be Yours is a film that conforms with a common template in the mainstream romance cinema, but there is a grace in its approach that somehow sets itself far better than just being ordinary.\" On the other hand, Rito P. Asilo of Philippine Daily Inquirer praised Bea Alonzo's performance saying that, \"The juggling act that Bea\u2014her generation\u2019s finest actress\u2014had to accomplish serves as a showcase for her formidable thespic gifts. With the textured portrayal that she limns to insightful perfection here, she proves that a fine actress can rise above the limitations of a flawed film!\" ===Full Cast & Crew=== *Starring: Bea Alonzo, & Gerald Anderson, Together With Alex Medina, Bernard Palanca, Anna Luna, Divine Aucina, Nicco Manalo, & Janus del Prado, With The Special Participation of: Ana Roces, & Ricardo Cepeda *Directed by: Dan Villegas *Produced by: Kris G.
