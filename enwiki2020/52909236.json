    "text": "Sine oscillations F = 0.01The Biryukov equation (or Biryukov oscillator), named after Vadim Biryukov (1946), is a non-linear second-order differential equation used to model damped oscillators.H. P. Gavin, The Levenberg-Marquardt method for nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems (MATLAB implementation included) The equation is given by : \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2}+f(y)\\frac{dy}{dt}+y=0, \\qquad\\qquad (1) where \u0192(y) is a piecewise constant function which is positive, except for small y as : f(y)= \\begin{cases} -F, & |y|\\le Y_0; \\\\\\ F, & |y|>Y_0. \\end{cases} : F = \\text{constant} > 0, \\quad Y_0 = \\text{constant} > 0. Eq. (1) is a special case of the Lienard equation; it describes the auto-oscillations. Solution (1) at a separate time intervals when f(y) is constant is given byArrowsmith D. K., Place C. M.

Expression (2) can be used for real and complex values of s_k.

A boundary condition is derived from continuity of y(t)) and dy/dt.Pilipenko A. M., and Biryukov V.
