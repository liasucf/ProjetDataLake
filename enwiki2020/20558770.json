    "text": "Traditionally a clarinet quintet is a chamber musical ensemble made up of one clarinet, plus the standard string quartet of two violins, one viola, and one cello. Now the term clarinet quintet can refer to five B clarinets; four B clarinets and a bass clarinet; three B clarinets and two bass clarinets; one E clarinet, two B clarinets, and two bass clarinets; or one E clarinet, two B clarinets, one E alto clarinet, and one bass clarinet. The term is also used to refer to a piece written for one of these ensembles. ==History== One of the earliest and most influential works for this combination of instruments is Mozart's Quintet for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, written for the clarinetist Anton Stadler in 1789. Although a few compositions for this ensemble were produced over the following years, including the Op. 34 clarinet quintet by Carl Maria von Weber, a composer famous for his solo clarinet compositions, it was not until Johannes Brahms composed his Clarinet Quintet in B minor, Op. 115 for Richard M\u00fchlfeld that the clarinet quintet began to receive considerable attention from composers. ==Works for clarinet quintet== * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in A major, K. 581 (1789) * Carl Maria von Weber \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in B major, Op. 34 (1811\u20131815) * Giacomo Meyerbeer \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in E major (1813) * Anton Reicha \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in B major, Op. 89 (1820) and Quintet in F major for clarinet or oboe and string quartet, Op. 107 (1829) * Heinrich Baermann \u2013 three clarinet quintets * Thomas T\u00e4glichsbeck \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in B major, Op. 44 (1863) * Ferruccio Busoni \u2013 Suite in G minor, BV 176 (1880) * Alexander Glazunov \u2013 R\u00eaverie orientale, Op. 14 (1886) * Johannes Brahms \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in B minor, Op. 115 (1891) * Samuel Coleridge-Taylor \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in F minor, Op. 10 (1895) * Henri Marteau \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in C minor, Op. 13 (1908) * Joseph Holbrooke \u2013 Cavatina and Variations, Clarinet Quintet No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15b (1910) and Clarinet Quintet No. 2 Ligeia in G major, Op. 27 (1910, revised 1939 and c.1956; original title Fate) * Robert Fuchs \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in E major, Op. 102 (1914) * Alexander Krein \u2013 Three Sketches on Hebrew Themes for Clarinet Quintet, Op. 12 (1914) and Two Sketches on Hebrew Themes for Clarinet Quintet, Op. 13 (1914) * Max Reger \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in A major, Op. 146 (1915\u20131916) * Herbert Howells \u2013 Rhapsodic Quintet, Op. 31 (1917) * Arthur Somervell \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in G major (1919) * Paul Hindemith \u2013 Clarinet Quintet, Op. 30 (1923, revised 1954) * G\u00fcnter Raphael \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in F major, Op. 4 (1924) * Quincy Porter \u2013 Clarinet Quintet (1929) * Arthur Bliss \u2013 Clarinet Quintet, F. 20 (1932) * Gordon Jacob \u2013 Clarinet Quintet in G minor (1939) * Morton Feldman \u2013 Two Pieces for Clarinet & String Quartet (1961); Clarinet & String Quartet (1983) * Kurt George Roger \u2013 Clarinet Quintet, Op. 116 (1966) * Bernard Herrmann \u2013 Souvenirs de voyage (1967) * Jean Fran\u00e7aix \u2013 Clarinet Quintet (1977) * Isang Yun \u2013 Clarinet Quintet No. 1 (1984) and Clarinet Quintet No. 2 (1994) * Edison Denisov \u2013 Clarinet Quintet (1987) * Dan Welcher \u2013 Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet * Ellen Taaffe Zwilich \u2013 Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet (1990) * Sean Osborn \u2013 Clarinet Quintet (1995) and Quintet for Clarinet and Strings, \"The Beatles\" (2004) * Milton Babbitt \u2013 Clarinet Quintet (1996) * Jennifer Higdon \u2013 Soliloquy * Howard J.
