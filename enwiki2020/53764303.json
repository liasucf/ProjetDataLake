It is shaped like a sea turtle and is covered with an abstract black and white pattern inspired by the forms of the Great Barrier Reef. It was created by Queensland artist BJ Price and has been exhibited on the water at various locations in Australia, including Sydney Harbor in 2014 and Currumbin in 2016. Alphie is 15 metres in length, weighs 375 kilograms and sits 5 metres above the water line when inflated. A smaller version known as \"Wee Alphie\" has also been displayed and photographed in far north Queensland. == References == Category:Australian art ",
