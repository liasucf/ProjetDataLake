It is the largest general-purpose fair in Europe. ==Foundation and early years== The concept of the Foire de Paris was aired in 1889 by a jeweler named Gustave Sandoz, but was dropped as preparations began for the Exposition Universelle of 1900. In 1903 an organizing committee was established by the Chambre Syndicale des Jeux et Jouets, and the first fair was opened in March 1904. During World War I (1914\u201318) the fair was suspended in 1915. In February 1916 the new Minister of Commerce, \u00c9tienne Cl\u00e9mentel, suggested reopening the fair. It was held on 1\u201317 March 1917 on the Esplanade des Invalides, showing only French products. This fair included agricultural machinery for the first time, but also included more than 400 booths devoted to fashion. The fair was again banned in 1918. In 1921 the fair was held on the Champ de Mars and Les Invalides. The first Salon des Appareils M\u00e9nagers (Home Appliances Fair) was held between 18 October 1923 and 4 November 1923 in of the Foire de Paris on the Champ de Mars. The first show was held in a simple hut. In 1923 the Parc des expositions was created at the Porte de Versaille to accommodate the fair and the exhibitions organized by the Ministry of Agriculture. From 1924 the Foire de Paris was hosted in the Porte de Versailles. In 1925 the fair began to include foreign products, showing new openness to international competition. From 1929 the fair has hosted the Concours L\u00e9pine, a competition for inventions. In 1929 the fair had 754 foreign exhibitors.

It was suspended for the rest of the war. ==Post war== The head of the Provisional Government, General Charles de Gaulle, inaugurated the Foire de Paris in 1945. The 1948 fair covered and included luxury goods such as leather and shoes for the first time since the war. It also had 23 television sets, which attracted thousands of people. In 1950 President Vincent Auriol advised the French people, \"Let all who are melancholic and sad come to the Paris Fair, their sorrow will give way to optimism.\" In 1960 the sensation of the fair was a realistic village of 30 fully equipped houses surrounding a church. The organizers arranged for a young couple to be married in the church during the fair. In 1968 the fair suffered from civic disturbances, with the metro on strike on opening day, but still had almost 400,000 visitors. The 1969 fair was overhauled and arranged into large, specialized exhibitions. In 1972 there were one million visitors.
