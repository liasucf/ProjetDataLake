    "text": "Edward Donald Rubin (January 26, 1935 - April 24, 2014) was an American jazz and rock drummer, and composer. His repertoire included rock, jazz, pop, R&B;, folk, and blues, although he had a preference for jazz drumming. Rubin is best known for his performances and recordings during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s with artists Neil Diamond, Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Johnny Rivers, Dexter Gordon, Ornette Coleman, Paul Revere & The Raiders, Don Randi, and many others. == Early life == Rubin was born as Edward Donald Rubin in Cleveland, Ohio, to George and Betty Rubin. He relocated to Venice, Los Angeles, California with his mother when he was ten years old. Rubin's interest in drumming and percussion began and developed by pounding on boxes and playing rhythms on pots and pans in his parents\u2019 kitchen. His parents started him on drum lessons at the age of five. After several years of continuing his pastime of drumming informally at home, Rubin joined band class when he entered junior high school and continued taking band classes throughout junior high and high school when he attended Venice High School in Venice, California. He also played in rock bands he formed with friends beginning in junior high school, and began playing outside gigs in high school. Eventually Rubin met and became a student of jazz drummer Freddie Gruber. == Career == === 1950s === After graduating Venice High School in 1953, Rubin entered college to study music. He took performing arts and musicianship courses at a local community college for a couple years and then quit, deciding he just wanted to go out and get whatever work he could find as a drummer. Rubin began his career as an on-call drummer performing gigs with bands at various local clubs and gradually over the course of a few years developed his reputation in the music industry and among musicians. In 1958, Rubin met bassist Scott LaFaro and the two played a casual gig together. === 1960s === In Los Angeles in early 60s, Rubin performed and recorded with Don Randi, a pianist, keyboard player, and composer who moved to Los Angeles from New York City. In 1962 Rubin was working with Randi as a band member of the Don Randi Trio, and together they recorded the album \u201cLast Night.\u201d \u201cLast Night\u201d was recorded on December 14, 1962 at Sherry\u2019s, a club in Hollywood California, and released in December 1963. Rubin also would sometimes perform with Don Randi in Las Vegas. In 1963, they played at venues such as the Kon Tiki lounge at The Castaways, a Polynesian themed resort on the Las Vegas Strip that occupied the site where The Mirage resort now stands. Later that same year, in 1963, Rubin was contacted by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Johnny Rivers, who made an offer to Rubin to play what was initially thought to be just a two or three- night gig with him. Rivers had relocated to Los Angeles from Baton Rouge Louisiana around 1961. After a couple years without much success making it as a singer and musician, Rivers was asked to perform at Gazzarri's, an Italian restaurant and music venue first located on La Cienega Blvd. in West Hollywood California until it later found its home on the Sunset Strip. Gazzarri\u2019s house band was leaving and Bill Gazzarri, the venue owner, had no other band at the time to replace them. Rivers accepted Gazzarri\u2019s offer to perform temporarily until a new house band was found. However, Rivers didn\u2019t have anyone to perform with and needed to find other musicians to put a band together. Rivers met and knew Eddie Rubin from sitting in and watching his performances with the Don Randi Trio at Sherry\u2019s Lounge, and decided to contact him to be his drummer. Rubin accepted River\u2019s offer. Eddie Rubin and Rivers, with no time to rehearse, performed together as a duo (just guitar and drums) at Gazzarri\u2019s and word quickly got out. In the book Straight Whisky, author Erick Quisling states, \u201cThe two men set up their instruments at Gazzarri\u2019s,\u201d began playing, and \u201cwhat happened after that was pure magic.\u201d Much to their surprise, by the second night people watching got up and started dancing. By the third night or later of performing, huge crowds and celebrities started gathering in Gazzarri\u2019s to hear them play. In his book The Music of Johnny Rivers, Robert Reynolds described the sound of the music as \u201cbeing driven with a catchy pulsating rhythm.\u201d After initial success, Gazzarri offered Rivers more work and allowed bassist Joe Osborn to join him and Rubin. Elmer Valentine, a club promoter, caught on to Rubin and Rivers\u2019 popularity at Gazarri\u2019s, and asked the band to perform on opening night at his new club he was planning to open on the Sunset Strip. The new club planning to open was called the Whisky a Go Go. The band accepted. On opening night Eddie Rubin and Johnny Rivers were the very first artists to ever perform at the Whisky a Go Go, which sparked the Whisky\u2019s rise to one of the most famous music venues worldwide. On opening night on January 15, 1964, the line of people waiting to get in stretched all the way around the block. Inside, there were go go dancers in cages on an elevated platform above the stage. Rubin and Rivers became the Whisky\u2019s house band for the next two years with a packed house every night, attracting both locals and numerous celebrities. The Beatles showed up to the Whisky a Go Go one evening in the summer of 1964 after performing at the Hollywood Bowl, during their first tour in the United States. The Beatles were visiting Sunset Strip and wanted to see what all the hype about Eddie Rubin and Johnny Rivers at the newly opened Whisky a Go Go was all about. During this first year run at the Whisky in 1964, Eddie and Johnny recorded two albums together live at the Whisky. The first live album, At the Whisky a Go Go, was released in February 1964 just one month after the Whisky\u2019s opening. The album received a Gold award, and the hit single \u201cMemphis,\u201d included on the album, was certified as a Gold single. The second live album, Here We a Go Go Again!, was released in April 1964, and included the hit single \u201cMaybellene.\u201d === 1970s === After years of performing and touring with Johnny Rivers throughout the United States and foreign countries, Eddie Rubin was in demand as a drummer. From 1969-1971, Eddie Rubin performed and recorded with singer and songwriter Neil Diamond. Neil Diamond wrote his famous hit song \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d in 1969 and after its massive success that same year, Diamond\u2019s success was taking off. Diamond was in need of a promising new band he could tour with. In July 1969 Eddie Rubin was contacted by Diamond and his manager, who wanted Rubin as the band\u2019s drummer. Rubin agreed to join, and immediately Rubin, Diamond, and the rest of the band prepared to go on tour. In late September 1969 they did a six-night performance at the Troubadour nightclub in Hollywood California, and before the end of the year toured throughout the United States in Maryland, Utah, Texas, Pennsylvania, and many other states throughout the south. In the beginning of 1970, Rubin toured more states with Diamond and then in March 1970 throughout Canada. Later in the summer, July 1970, Eddie Rubin performed with Diamond at the Troubadour (West Hollywood, California) once again. It was here at the Troubadour on July 15, 1970 that Rubin recorded the hit live album Gold: Recorded Live at the Troubadour with Diamond's band. This album, released on August 22, 1970, included the hit songs \u201cSweet Caroline,\u201d \u201cSolitary Man,\u201d and \u201cCherry Cherry.\u201d The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in November 1970, and eventually went 2x Multi-Platinum. == Later years == After numerous years touring and performing around the world as a drummer, in the late 1970s, Rubin pursued his side interest of photography and love of animals. Rubin worked as a photographer for the American Kennel Club. Rubin continued his career as a professional dog photographer for American Kennel Club dog shows and for various private clients for many years through the 1980s and 1990s. Later in 2003, after retiring from his work as a professional photographer, Eddie moved back to Venice California, the place he grew up. Rubin survived a second heart valve repair operation in 2007. On April 24, 2014, Eddie Rubin died from cardiac failure in his home in Venice Beach, California at the age of 79. == Discography == === Albums === * 1963: Last Night, Don Randi Trio * 1964: At the Whisky a Go Go, Johnny Rivers * 1964: Here We a Go Go Again!, Johnny Rivers * 1964: John Lee Hooker, Johnny Rivers * 1967: Whisky A Go-Go Revisited, Johnny Rivers * 1970: Gold: Recorded Live at the Troubadour, Neil Diamond * 1979: MUH Vol. 1 Live Aus Dem Musikalischen Unter Holz In M\u00fcnchen (LP), Various * 1998: The Yellow Balloon, The Yellow Balloon (band) == References == ==Sources== #Clash, Jim. \u201cJohnny Rivers On Whiskey a Go Go Club, Bob Dylan as First Rapper.\u201d Forbes, Forbes Magazine, 16 May 2015, https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2015/05/16/johnny-rivers-on- whiskey-a-go-go-club-bob-dylan-as-first-rapper/#2109a6fe5980. #Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.
