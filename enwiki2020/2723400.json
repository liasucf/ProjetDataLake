It lies approximately 8 kilometres due west of Sydney's central business district. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Abbotsford, Drummoyne, Wareemba, Five Dock, Canada Bay, Concord and Cabarita. In the early days of the colony of New South Wales, it was sometimes known as Stonequarry Cove and Stone Quarry Creek. This may have been because there was once a nearby quarry in Five Dock.Russell, Eric. Drummoyne: a western suburbs' history from 1794.

The bay is a popular location for rowing regattas. It is also the home of the Hen & Chicken Bay SLSC, which holds occasional patrols on the waterway. It is a voluntary organisation which was formed by a number of locals, including Trevor Folsom, to spread the word of water safety locally & abroad. They have traveled all over the world in the name of good times & have a number of alliance relationships with similar clubs. Funding for a permanent Clubhouse on the Bay are ongoing. ==References== Category:Bays of New South Wales ",
