The council chambers in Conder Street were designed by architect Jack Hennessy and built in 1877. Hennessy was later mayor of Burwood. A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the Municipality of Burwood merge with adjoining councils. The government proposed a merger of the Burwood, Canada Bay, and Strathfield Councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 163,000. In May 2016 Strathfield Council challenged the proposed merger between Strathfield, Burwood and Canada Bay and commenced proceedings in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. After the Court heard that there were legal flaws in the report from the State Government appointed delegate who examined the proposal for merging the councils, the NSW Government withdrew from the case and the merger proposal stalled. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Strathfield, Burwood and Canada Bay local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. ==Heritage listings== The Municipality of Burwood has a number of heritage- listed sites, including the following sites listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register: * Burwood, 168a Burwood Road: Burwood Post Office * Burwood, 205 Burwood Road: St Paul's Anglican Church, Burwood * Burwood, 213 Burwood Road: The Priory, Burwood * Burwood, 223 Burwood Road: St. Cloud, Burwood * Burwood, 4 Clarence Street: Lynton, Burwood * Burwood, Great Southern and Western railway: Burwood rail underbridge * Burwood, Great Southern and Western railway: Burwood railway station, Sydney * Burwood, Railway Parade: Burwood Sewer Vent * Croydon, Boundary Street: Shubra Hall * Croydon, Paisley Road: Croydon Sewer Vent * Strathfield, 62 The Boulevarde: Trinity Uniting Church, Strathfield ==Council Logo== Burwood Council introduce in September 2019 a new bold logo designed to reflect the changes which have made it a vibrant and multicultural destination while retaining its heritage.
