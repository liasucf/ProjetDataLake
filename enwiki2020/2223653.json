    "text": "Being Bobby Brown is an American reality television series that debuted on Bravo on June 30, 2005. ==Premise== The series depicts the life of R&B; singer Bobby Brown, his then-wife, pop/R&B; superstar Whitney Houston, and their family. The program showcases the family's home time, along with shopping at the famed Harrod's of London (where they met with the owner Mohamed Al-Fayed), and vacationing in the Bahamas. The program ran on Thursdays, but on occasion aired several times through the week. The highly rated show ran for only one season as Houston did not agree to a second season; thus, Brown and Bravo could not reach an agreement to continue the show. ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:72%;\" |- ! style=\"background- color: #8CDD81; color: #000000;\"| No. ! style=\"background-color: #8CDD81; color: #000000;\"| Title ! style=\"background-color: #8CDD81; color: #000000;\"| Original air date |- |} ==No DVD release== A spokesperson for Bravo has told various news outlets that the series will be kept in the Bravo archives and will not see public light again. ==In popular culture== Houston popularized the phrase \"Hell to the no\" on the series and was nominated for a VH-1 \"Big In '05 Award\" for \"Quote of the Year\". This phrase also appeared on T-shirts. The Soup television series also featured Houston loudly shouting \"Kiss my ass!\" as a running gag, naming it its \"Clip of the Year\". ==Reception== Entertainment Weekly gave the series a grade of \"B\" and commented on how relaxed the couple is with the cameras filming their every move. One reviewer, Barry Garron, wrote that Being Bobby Brown', the reality show spotlighting the R&B; singer whose rap sheet might be longer than his catalog, is undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television.\" Garron and other reviewers noted that the show contained remarks regarding sexuality and excretory functions, and Garron opined that the show robbed Whitney Houston \"of any last shreds of dignity\". Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000s American reality television series Category:2005 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:African-American reality television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Bravo (American TV network) original programming Category:Whitney Houston ",
