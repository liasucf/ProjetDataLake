    "text": "Mark Anthony McGinley is an Irish sportsperson. He has played Gaelic football as a goalkeeper for Naomh M\u00edche\u00e1l and was formerly number one keeper with his county team, Donegal. McGinley has also been involved in the sport of association football and currently plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division with Finn Harps. He is from Ards, County Donegal. ==Playing career== ===Early=== McGinley played association football for University College Dublin in the League of Ireland. He spent time with Fanad United in the Ulster Senior League under the management of Ollie Horgan. He also spent time with League of Ireland side Finn Harps in 2014, while Horgan was manager, but injury prevented him from playing for them. ===2015=== First featuring for his county's Gaelic football team under the management of Rory Gallagher, McGinley joined the senior team for the first time in 2015. He was among thirteen new members of the panel announced in late 2014 for Gallagher's first time in charge; others included Ciaran McGinley and Eoin McHugh. He served as a substitute for the All-Ireland winner Paul Durcan, following Michael Boyle's transfer to Boston before the Ulster Senior Football Championship semi-final against Derry; Durcan then transferred to Qatar, leaving the way clear for McGinley to become Donegal's goalkeeper. ===2016=== McGinley started three games during the 2016 National Football League, playing against Dublin at Croke Park and Monaghan, as well as in the league semi-final in Croke Park, also against Dublin. Gallagher had favoured Peter Boyle in goal for previous league fixtures of that campaign. McGinley's Championship debut came in the 2016 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter-final victory over Fermanagh; in goal from the start, he notably saved a Sean Quigley penalty which Neil McGee conceded during first half stoppage time. McGinley retained his place in goal for the semi-final against Monaghan - which Donegal won after a replay, also featuring McGinley in goal. McGinley played in the Ulster final, a narrow two-point loss to Tyrone, the subsequent All-Ireland qualifier defeat of Cork at Croke Park, and the All-Ireland quarter-final loss to Dublin at Croke Park. ===2017=== McGinley started in goal during many games of Donegal's 2017 National Football League campaign, including Kerry, the draw against Dublin, Monaghan and Mayo - the last of these in which he conceded a penalty which was dispatched by Cillian O'Connor, helping Mayo to a two-point victory. McGinley started in goal for Donegal in the 2017 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter-final victory over Antrim and the semi-final loss to Tyrone, as well as the All-Ireland qualifier victories over Longford and Meath before conceding a penalty and receiving a black card in the loss to Galway at Markievicz Park. ===2018=== Under new manager Declan Bonner, McGinley started in goal during Donegal's opening fixture of the 2018 National Football League campaign against Kerry, only to be injured in the seventeenth minute; Peter Boyle was sent onto the field of play in his place. He then lost his place as first Peter Boyle, and then Shaun Patton, started games in the league. ===2019=== In February 2019, McGinley \u2014 by then neglected by the Donegal Gaelic football team and with no place in the side \u2014 signed for League of Ireland Premier Division side Finn Harps (under the management of Ollie Horgan, whom McGinley knew from his time with Fanad United). In March 2019, McGinley announced his departure from the Donegal Gaelic football team. He did so after Bonner opted for Patton as his first choice goalkeeper for the league fixture on the weekend of Saint Patrick's Day. Meanwhile, Harps goalkeeper Ciaran Gallagher sustained a long-term injury while playing against Dundalk, which - McGinley later confirmed - had led to Horgan contacting him. In April 2019, McGinley featured in his first Finn Harps squad for a league fixture against Sligo Rovers at The Showgrounds. Playing for them by May, against Derry City, McGinley made some critical saves in the first half to keep Finn Harps in the game; however, they lost what was a cup tie after extra- time.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48416783 ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Association footballers from County Donegal Category:Donegal inter- county Gaelic footballers Category:Fanad United F.C. players Category:Finn Harps F.C. players Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code Category:Gaelic football goalkeepers Category:League of Ireland players Category:Naomh M\u00edche\u00e1l (Donegal) Gaelic footballers Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:University College Dublin A.F.C. players Category:Association football goalkeepers ",
