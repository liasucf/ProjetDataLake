    "text": "In computing, `copy` is a command in various operating systems. The command copies computer files from one directory to another. ==Overview== Generally, the command copies files from one location to another. It is used to make copies of existing files, but can also be used to combine (concatenate) multiple files into target files. The destination defaults to the current working directory. If multiple source files are indicated, the destination must be a directory, or an error will result. The command can copy in text mode or binary mode; in text mode, `copy` will stop when it reaches the EOF character; in binary mode, the files will be concatenated in their entirety, ignoring EOF characters. Files may be copied to devices. For example, `copy file con` outputs file to the screen console. Devices themselves may be copied to a destination file, for example, `copy con file` takes the text typed into the console and puts it into FILE, stopping when EOF (Ctrl+Z) is typed. ==Implementations== The command is available in DEC RT-11, OS/8,\"Concise Command Language\" (CCL).

The `copy` command is supported by Tim Paterson's SCP 86-DOS. (59 pages) Under IBM PC DOS/MS-DOS it is available since version 1. A more advanced copy command is called `xcopy`. The equivalent Unix command is `cp`, the CP/M command is `PIP`. The command is analogous to the Stratus OpenVOS `copy_file` command. ==Example for DOS== copy letter.txt [destination] Files may be copied to device files (e.g. `copy letter.txt lpt1` sends the file to the printer on lpt1. `copy letter.txt con` would output to stdout, like the `type` command. Note that `copy page1.txt+page2.txt book.txt` will concatenate the files and output them as `book.txt`. Which is just like the `cat` command). It can also copy files between different disk drives. There are two command-line switches to modify the behaviour when concatenating files: * Text mode - This copies the text content of the file, stopping when it reaches the EOF character. copy /a doc1.txt + doc2.txt doc3.txt copy /a *.txt doc3.txt * Binary mode - This concatenates files in their entirety, ignoring EOF characters. copy /b image1.jpg + image2.jpg image3.jpg ==See also== * XCOPY in DOS, OS/2, Windows etc. * cp (Unix) * Peripheral Interchange Program ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * copy | Microsoft Docs * Open source COPY implementation that comes with MS-DOS v2.0 Category:Internal DOS commands Category:OS/2 commands Category:Windows commands Category:Microcomputer software Category:Microsoft free software Category:Windows administration Category:File copy utilities ",
