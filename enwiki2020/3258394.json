    "text": "Morgion was an American doom/death metal band from Orange County, California, United States. Morgion was formed in 1990 by Dwayne Boardman (guitars), Jeremy Peto (vocals, bass) and Rhett Davis (drums). The band recorded their debut \u201cRabid Decay\u201d demo in 1991, followed by the \u201cTravesty\u201d 7\" in 1993. With the addition of Bobby Thomas (guitars) and Ed Parker (keyboards) in 1994, Morgion recorded a what would become \u201cAmong Majestic Ruin\u201d, licensed for release to Relapse Records in 1997. In 1995, Gary Griffith joined Morgion as a replacement for Parker on keyboards. In 1998, Thomas departed and Griffith took on both guitar and keyboard duties. Morgion then wrote and recorded Solinari; released by Relapse Records in 1999. After a hiatus, 2002 saw the band moving forward with Justin Christian on Bass and an album partnership with Dark Symphonies. \u201cCloaked by Ages, Crowned in Earth\u201d, the final album, was released in April 2004. Boardman and Griffith left Morgion in 2004, and the band was officially put to rest after the drummer and bassist briefly attempted to carry on and tour under the Morgion name. On April 19, 2008, former members Boardman (vocals/guitars), Christian (bass), Griffith (cocals/guitars/keyboards) and Surowski (drums) played a short Morgion set at the Murderfest in Hollywood, California to commemorate the release of Relapse Records' \"Morgion: The Relapse Years.\" The appearance was planned to be the Solinari lineup, but a fallout between members changed plans. The Relapse release contains the recordings \"Among Majestic Ruin\" and Solinari, along with previously unreleased songs, demos and rehearsal tracks from the Relapse era, all remastered February 2008 by Griffith and Mathais Schneeburger (whom co- produced the albums Solinari and \"Cloaked by Ages, Crowned in Earth\"). A compilation of early demo recordings entitled \"God of Death & Disease\" was released in 2012 by Dark Descent Records. The original Solinari lineup was invited to play a one-off \"reunion\" gig at Maryland Deathfest in 2012, but the bassist sustained an arm injury that forced the band to reschedule the show for the following year. Just a few short months before they were set to appear at Maryland Deathfest 2013, the lineup once again suffered a fallout between members and they were forced to cancel their appearance. ==Facts== Morgion is also the name of the god of plague and disease in the world of Dragonlance, coinciding with their debut Rabid Decay and is where the band took their name from. Their album Solinari is also named after a god in the Dragonlance world, Solinari, as a god of magic and ruler of those who wear the white robes. Rhett Davis (lyrics and titles), not knowing his Dragonlance lore very well, stated that Solinari was the black moon in Dragonlance lore, but Solinari is in fact the name of the white moon. 'Nuitari' is the name of the black moon and, given the album artwork, is likely Solinaris' true intended album title. ==Members== ===Final line-up=== *Dwayne Boardman - Death Vocals, Guitars (1990\u20132001, 2002\u20132004) *Gary Griffith - Guitars, Clean Vocals, Keyboards (1995\u20132004) *Justin Christian - Bass (2002\u20132004) *Rhett Davis - Drums (1990\u20131999, 2001\u20132004) ===Former members=== *Jeremy Peto - Death Vocals, Bass (1990-2001) *Bobby Thomas - Guitar (1994-1996) *Ed Parker - Keyboards (1994-1995) *Mike Davis - Guitar (1990-1993) *Brandon Livingston - Keyboards (1999; died 1999) *Peter Surowski - Keyboards (2001-2002) *Adrian Leroux - Clean Vocals, Death Vocals (2003) ===Timeline=== ImageSize =width:800 height:auto barincrement:25 PlotArea =left:120 bottom:80 top:0 right:15 Alignbars =justify DateFormat =mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/2004 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1990 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1990 TimeAxis =orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend =orientation:vertical position:bottom Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_Albums id:other value:gray(0.5) legend:Demos/EPs id:bars value:gray(0.95) LineData= at:06/01/1991 color:other layer:back at:06/01/1992 color:other layer:back at:03/01/1993 color:other layer:back at:03/28/1997 color:black layer:back at:02/23/1999 color:black layer:back at:10/01/1999 color:other layer:back at:06/01/2002 color:other layer:back at:12/01/2002 color:other layer:back at:06/01/2003 color:other layer:back at:04/27/2004 color:black layer:back BackgroundColors= bars:bars BarData= bar:Dwayne text:\"Dwayne Boardman\" bar:Gary text:\"Gary Griffith\" bar:Jeremy text:\"Jeremy Peto\" bar:Rhett text:\"Rhett Davis\" bar:Mike text:\"Mike Davis\" bar:Bobby text:\"Bobby Thomas\" bar:Ed text:\"Ed Parker\" bar:Adrian text:\"Adrian Leroux\" bar:Brandon text:\"Brandon Livingston\" bar:Peter text:\"Peter Surowski\" bar:Justin text:\"Justin Christian\" PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Adrian from:01/01/2003 till:04/01/2003 color:vocals bar:Dwayne from:01/01/1990 till:09/11/2001 color:guitar bar:Dwayne from:11/01/2001 till:04/01/2004 color:guitar bar:Dwayne from:05/01/2003 till:04/01/2004 color:vocals width:3 bar:Mike from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/1993 color:guitar bar:Bobby from:01/01/1994 till:06/01/1996 color:guitar bar:Gary from:06/01/1995 till:06/01/1998 color:keys bar:Gary from:06/01/1998 till:04/01/2004 color:guitar bar:Gary from:05/01/2003 till:04/01/2004 color:vocals width:7 bar:Gary from:06/01/1998 till:04/01/2004 color:keys width:3 bar:Ed from:01/01/1994 till:01/01/1995 color:keys bar:Brandon from:05/01/1999 till:09/01/1999 color:keys bar:Peter from:01/01/2001 till:04/01/2002 color:keys bar:Jeremy from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/2001 color:bass bar:Jeremy from:01/01/1990 till:12/01/2001 color:vocals width:3 bar:Justin from:01/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:bass bar:Rhett from:01/01/1990 till:06/01/1999 color:drums bar:Rhett from:06/01/2001 till:12/01/2004 color:drums ==Discography== * Rabid Decay (1991) * Travesty (1993) * Among Majestic Ruin (1997) * Solinari (1999) * Cloaked by Ages, Crowned in Earth (2004) * Morgion: The Relapse Years (2008) * Morgion: God of Death & Disease (2012) ==External links== * Official Dark Symphonies website (Former Label) * Official Relapse website (Former Label) Category:Heavy metal musical groups from California Category:American doom metal musical groups Category:Relapse Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2004 Category:Musical quartets Category:Musical groups from Orange County, California ",
