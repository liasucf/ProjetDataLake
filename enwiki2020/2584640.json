Prior to this, audio compressed with MP3 had to be decompressed prior to listening. It was released by Fraunhofer IIS (\"Institute for Integrated Circuits\"),\"All title and copyrights in and to the IIS WinPlay3 v2.3b5 software product are owned by: Fraunhofer Institut Integrierte Schaltungen, Am Weichselgarten 3, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany\".

The first warez group to bring WinPlay3 to attention of a wider audience was Compress Da Audio. They released CDs, with WinPlay3 included, on several warez FTP sites. Rabid Neurosis emerged shortly afterwards, after which the scene exploded. Until the release of Winamp in 1997, WinPlay3 was the sole option for playing MP3-compressed music on Microsoft Windows. Unlike modern audio programs, such as Winamp or iTunes, it lacked advanced features such as equalizers, or playlists as a menu option, and concentrated mostly on playback. A playlist can be created by hand, however, in a simple text file listing the system path to each MP3 and saving the file with an M3U extension. The m3u playlist support made it the first widely available media player application that offered a well-integrated streaming experience for the web user. Clicking a link on a webpage launched WinPlay3, which would start a stream of the mp3 listed in the m3u file. The limitations were most likely due to the requirement of a 486DX processor running at 66 MHz for real-time playback, which at the time was fairly high. == References == == External links == * FhG IIS WinPlay3 on Really Rare Wares (September 1995 through May 1997) (16- and 32-bit versions) Category:Windows- only freeware Category:Windows media players ",
