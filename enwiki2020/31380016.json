The Longhorn Network would expand its sports coverage to include five UTSA Roadrunners football games to its schedule for sister campus University of Texas at San Antonio's inaugural football season, the first of which aired on September 10, 2011. The majority of the live events are handled by the Longhorn Network Operations department, which manages the crew that sets up the equipment used to air the event. Over 200 live events were managed by this department during the 2011\u201312 school year. Longhorn Network simulcast featured groups coverage of the 2015 Open Championship, which featured University of Texas alumni Jordan Spieth. In February 2018, the network began to carry coverage of women's softball games at UT's McCombs Field where the university mainly served as a host school for neutral-site matches between northern teams (southern schools and domes regularly host northern schools during the winter), rather than the Longhorns as a competing team, allowing some form of video coverage to the competing schools. ==Controversies== ===High school football=== From the initial announcement of the Longhorn Network, ESPN had made it known that it desired to broadcast up to 18 high school football games per season. The idea was a cause for concern among other Big 12 schools, especially Texas A&M;, due to what that university viewed as possible recruiting violations, and was partly responsible for A&M;'s decision to leave the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference in 2012. During an August 1, 2011, meeting of all Big 12 athletic directors, it was decided that the issue of airing high school football games on the network would be postponed for one year, allowing time for the NCAA to rule on the matter.Big 12 sets up restrictions on Longhorn Network, Houston Chronicle. Retrieved 1 August 2011 On August 11, 2011, the NCAA ruled that no school or conference network would be permitted to broadcast high school sports or any other high school programming, effectively bringing the issue to a close.High school games cannot be on school networks , CBS Sports, retrieved 11 August 2011 ===Big 12 Conference football=== In addition to a non-conference game each season, ESPN desired to place a Big 12 Conference game on the Longhorn Network. At the same Big 12 meeting that discussed high school football telecasts, it was agreed upon that a conference game would be acceptable as long as both schools and the conference office approved the broadcast. It was reported that ESPN asked Texas Tech for permission to broadcast the team's November 5 game against the Longhorns on the network. ESPN told the university that the game would most likely not be carried on any of the ESPN family of networks, leaving a broadcast on the LHN as its only option. In return, ESPN promised to televise two non-conference football games over the next four seasons, televise some other non-football programming, $5 million cash, and help from the network to try to arrange a home-and-home series against a top BCS conference school. Texas Tech passed on the offer with the university's chancellor Kent Hance explaining that \"I don't want a Tech fan to have to give one dime to the Longhorn Network\". ESPN then contacted Oklahoma State about airing games on the network; that university also refused the invitation to appear on the network.Tech says no to Longhorn Network , Amarillo Globe-News. Retrieved 9 August 2011/ Texas Athletics eventually announced that the Kansas Jayhawks had agreed to let its game against the Longhorns on October 29 air on LHN (the University of Kansas's third-tier media rights are also managed by LHN co-owner IMG College). The agreement allowed the Longhorn Network to be the national carrier of the game, except in Kansas markets, where the game was shown on broadcast television.Texas-Kansas football game to air on Longhorn Network, TexasSports.com. Retrieved 2 September 2011. ESPN revealed plans to broadcast the Texas Tech-Texas State game on the Longhorn Network in 2012, however Texas Tech threatened to drop the game in favor of an 11-game schedule, resulting the game being removed from LHN's schedule. In November 2012, ESPN syndicated a second feed of a Longhorn football home game against Iowa State to ABC-affiliated television stations across Iowa (including KETV in Omaha, Nebraska, which is owned by ESPN part-owner Hearst Corporation) to provide access to the game within that state. A secondary announcing team was used for the Iowa State feed. The same was done in September 2013 for a matchup against Ole Miss throughout the state of Mississippi. Mediacom eventually established an online/traditional network with Iowa State in their service area, Cyclones.tv, featuring university programming, along with any live games featuring Texas which are only available through Longhorn Network with Iowa State overlaying their own play-by-play and commentary, or producing their own telecast entirely. ===Potential conflict of interest=== Concerns have been raised by some fans, bloggers and journalists that ESPN's financial stake in the Longhorn Network creates a potential conflict of interest.Open Mikes: Is the Longhorn Network a good or bad idea?
