Rebel Coast was started in 2013 by Kate Seiberlich, Doug Burkett, and Chip Forsythe (an alumnus of California Polytechnic State University). Rebel Coast makes a red wine called Reckless Love, a white wine called Sunday Funday and another red called Lost by Choice. In late 2017, Rebel Coast announced the release of a THC-infused Sauvignon Blanc. The plan was to ship the wine only to customers in US states where recreational use of marijuana was legal. ==References== Category:Wineries in California Category:American companies established in 2013 Category:Food and drink companies established in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in California ",
