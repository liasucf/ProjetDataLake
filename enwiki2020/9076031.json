    "text": "The CWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship was a short-lived professional wrestling championship defended in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA, formerly the Championship Wrestling Association, hence the CWA name) and the World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA) during their joint promotion in 1989 and 1990. The title was abandoned when the two companies split. The Dirty White Boy defeated Dustin Rhodes in the finals of a tournament to become the first CWA Southwestern Heavyweight Champion, records are unclear on who else competed in the tournament. Three wrestlers in total have shared seven total reigns, with Bill Dundee and John Tatum tied for most with three each. Dundee held the championship for a combined 205 days, longer than anyone else. His first reign, from November 19, 1989 to May 3, 1990 is the longest of any individual reign at 165 days. The CWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship is often mistakenly listed as being part of the USWA Southern Heavyweight Championship history. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match. ==Title history== ==List of combined reigns== ;Key {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Symbol !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Meaning |- |style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\"|\u00a4 |The exact length of at least one title reign is uncertain, so the shortest possible length is used. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Rank !scope=\"col\" |Wrestler !data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |# of reigns !data-sort-type=\"number\" scope=\"col\" |Combined days |- ! scope=\"row\" |1 | || 3 || 205 |-style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\" ! scope=\"row\" |2 | || 3 || |- ! scope=\"row\" |3 | || 1 || 48 |} ==Footnotes== ==References== * ==See also== *Championship Wrestling Association *United States Wrestling Association *World Class Wrestling Association Category:Continental Wrestling Association championships Category:United States Wrestling Association championships Category:World Class Championship Wrestling championships Category:Heavyweight wrestling championships Category:Regional professional wrestling championships ",
