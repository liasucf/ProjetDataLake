    "text": "This article provides an incomplete list and broad overview of significant religious sites and places of spiritual importance throughout the world. Sites are listed alphabetically by religion. ==Abrahamic religions== The tomb of Abraham in 2006. Abrahamic religions are monotheistic faiths emphasizing and tracing their common origin to Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him. They constitute one of three major divisions in comparative religion, along with Indian religions (Dharmic) and East Asian religions (Taoic). The three major Abrahamic faiths (in chronological order) are Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some strict definitions of what constitutes an Abrahamic religion include only these three faiths. However, there are many other religions incorporating Abrahamic doctrine, theology, genealogy and history into their own belief systems. ===Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and B\u00e1bism=== The Shrine of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre in Haifa, Israel, in 2007. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is a monotheistic religion founded by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h in 19th century Persia, and consider their religion to progress from or succeed B\u00e1bism or the B\u00e1bi Faith (Persian: \u0628\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0647\u0627 B\u00e1b\u00ed h\u00e1) founded by the B\u00e1b earlier in the century \u2013 emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind. Arc complex administrative buildings at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Center in 2005. A telephone pole, sidewalk and mosque built over the House of the B\u00e1b in Shiraz, Iran in 2008. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed gardens, with the Shrine of the B\u00e1b in the background, in 2008. Located in Bahji, near Acre, Israel the Shrine of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is the most holy place for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and their Qiblih, or direction of prayer. It contains the remains of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahji. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard Acre (He.: \u05e2\u05b7\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9 Akko; Ar.: \u0639\u0643\u0651\u0627 \u02bbAkk\u0101) itself as their holy city, mostly due to the fact that it serves as the location of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and his family's many affairs. Within Acre, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sites include the House of 'Abb\u00fad, the House of 'Abdu'll\u00e1h P\u00e1sh\u00e1, the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n and the Prison cell of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h \u2013 where Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h was incarcerated. The second holiest site in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith \u2013 which is also revered by the few remaining Azalis (post-Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed/B\u00e1bi split followers of B\u00e1bism, who number just several thousand worldwide) \u2013 is the Shrine of the B\u00e1b, located on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel. The B\u00e1b's Shrine contains within its walls the temporary Shrine of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1. The BWC also contains the Monument Gardens \u2013 wherein can be found the graves of some of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's family \u2013 as well as a house in which 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 lived, and the resting place of R\u00fah\u00edyyih Khanum (8 August 1910 \u2013 19 January 2000; born Mary Sutherland Maxwell; the wife of Shoghi Effendi). Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h decreed pilgrimage in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas to two places: the House of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h in Baghdad, Iraq and the House of the B\u00e1b in Shiraz, Iran]. While these major pilgrimages were later replaced (at least in terms of religious significance) by 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, many Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds still flocked to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's home for pilgrimage until the house was confiscated by Muslim authorities hostile to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1922. It has yet to be returned to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. The House of the B\u00e1b was completely destroyed by Iranian Muslims during a state-sponsored persecution of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. A road and mosque were built over the house and a telephone pole now marks the spot where the B\u00e1b proclaimed his prophethood. The city of Baghdad also includes the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n, which shares the same name as \u2013 though is distinct from \u2013 the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n in Acre.

Map of the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem. (Click to expand.) Located in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, the Edicule, also known as the Tomb of Christ, within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the most holy site for many mainstream denominations within Christianity. The area of the Church is regarded as the site, according to their understanding, where Jesus Christ suffered, was crucified, died, buried and resurrected from the dead along a temporal pathway known as the Via Dolorosa (from the Latin; lit. \"way of sorrows\"). The first eight Stations of the Cross can be followed along the route leading up to the Church, inside of which are the final five Stations. The Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, Roman Catholic Church, and Armenian Apostolic Church form the custodians of the Holy Sepulchre and collectively control the most holy pilgrimages within the church along with the Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches who also hold some chapels. Within the walls of the church are the many traditional locations for the events associated with the Passion and death of Jesus: The Stone of Unction (the anointing place of Christ's body), the Prison of Christ (where Jesus was held, incarcerated, before his Passion), a treasure room which holds relics including fragments of the True Cross, and of course Calvary or Golgotha (where Christ was crucified) and the Sepulchre itself \u2013 to name a few. The entrance to the Garden Tomb in 2005. Many Protestant and nontrinitarian denominations regard the nearby Garden Tomb to be the actual crucifixion and resurrection site of Jesus. Still others have claimed that Jesus's tomb is in Japan, or is really located outside of East Jerusalem. Some individuals in the Ahmadiyya Muslim community regard Roza Bal in Srinagar, India, to be Jesus's authentic grave. The Altar of the Crucifixion (Golgotha or Calvary, the traditional site of the Crucifixion of Jesus in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem, in 2011. Other holy sites and shrines of pilgrimage exist in the Holy Land. In Jerusalem the Garden of Gethsemane, the Mount Zion Cenacle of the Last Supper and the Mount of Olives, as well as the Church of the Ascension prove spiritually important. Outside Jerusalem are pilgrimage places including the Sea of Galilee, as well as locations in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Capernaum: The ninth Stations of the Cross along the Via Dolorosa with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the background, in 2006. * Bethlehem: The location of the Church of the Nativity in Manger Square, where Jesus was born. * Capernaum: The town, bordering the Sea of Galilee, is cited in the Gospel of Luke where it was reported to have been the home of the apostles Simon Peter, Andrew, James and John, as well as the tax collector Matthew. In the Gospel of Matthew the town was reported to have been the home of Jesus. According to Luke , Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum on Sabbath. Jesus then healed a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil and healed a fever in Simon Peter's mother-in-law. According to Luke , it is also the place where a Roman Centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant. Capernaum is also mentioned in the Gospel of Mark , in which it is the location of the famous healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof to reach Jesus. According to several Gospels, Jesus selected this town as the center of his public ministry in the Galilee after he left the small mountainous hamlet of Nazareth . Capernaum has no obvious advantages over any other city in the area, so he probably chose it because it was the home of his first disciples, Simon (Peter) and Andrew. * Nazareth: The location of the Church of the Annunciation (in the Catholic tradition marks the site where the Archangel Gabriel announced the future birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary ), St. Gabriel's Church (an Orthodox alternative site for the Annunciation), the Synagogue Church (The Melkite Greek Catholic Church lays claim to this site, which is traditionally that of the synagogue where Jesus preached ), the Church of St. Joseph's Carpentry (occupies the traditional location for the workshop of Saint Joseph); the Mensa Christi Church (run by the Franciscan religious order, commemorates the traditional location where Jesus dined with the Apostles after his Resurrection), the Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent (run by the Salesian religious order, occupies a hill overlooking the city), the Church of Christ (an Anglican church in Nazareth), and the Church of Our Lady of the Fright (marking the spot where Mary saw Jesus being taken to a cliff by the congregation of the synagogue and felt fear on his account). The \"Jesus Trail\" pilgrimage route connects many of the religious sites in Nazareth on a 60 km walking trail which ends in Capernaum. Other important locations identified with the life of Jesus include areas around the Sea of Galilee \u2013 for instance Cana and the Church of the Multiplication in Tabgha \u2013 as well as the Mount of Temptation (in the Judean desert), Mount Tabor, Jacob's Well, Bethany and Bethabara (on the Jordan River). The town of Sepphoris is where the Virgin Mary spent her childhood. Still other revered places may exist within or outside the Holy Land, involving localities associated with the lives of the Twelve Apostles, the Church Fathers, the relatives and ancestors of Jesus, saints, or other figures or events featured in both the Old Testament (sharing religious significance with Judaism or other Abrahamic faiths) and New Testament. The reverence held for these sites may vary depending on denomination.

It also places emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum, and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and notes as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the Apostles. Mainstream Catholicism as a whole is represented by the Holy See (, \"holy chair\") of the Vatican City state (Italian: ),This is the name used in the state's founding document, the Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , article 26. a walled enclave within Rome, Italy. Inside the Vatican the largest church in history, St. Peter's Basilica (L.: Basilica Sancti Petri), is the location of the Papal office and the living quarters of the Pope (in the Apostolic Palace), as well as Vatican Hill \u2013 atop which are Saint Peter's tomb and place of crucifixion, his throne, and his baldachin. Outside St. Peter's Square are many more churches throughout the Vatican and outlying Rome. One important landmark is the Sistine Chapel (L.: Sacellum Sixtinum; I.: Cappella Sistina), in which the Papal conclave takes place. Rome is the place from which Catholics believe the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church were formally founded and begun by Saint Peter (whom they consider to be the \"Prince of the Apostles\") as the appointed successor and first vicar of Christ. Thus while the Holy Sepulchre is still the most sanctified of places for Catholics, the Vatican is an extremely sacred place to the faithful (those of the Latin Church, as well as the Churches sui iuris) as the seat of their supreme authority on Earth. Important papal territories include the four major basilicas (L.: Basilica maior, pl. -es; excluding St. Peter's) \u2013 namely the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (the ecumenical Catholic mother church), St. Peter's Basilica, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls (containing the tomb of Paul the Apostle), and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Other locations of reverence for ardent Catholics include Marian shrines, particularly the localities of F\u00e1tima and Lourdes, where miracles or apparitions attributed to the Virgin Mary took place.

File:SantaMariaMaggiore front.jpg|The Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in 2006. ====Eastern Christianity==== Orthodox or Eastern Christians, like many other Christians, regard the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. They place emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and note as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the apostles and other saints. There are many shrines with the relics of Christian saints and martyrs which are sacred pilgrimage sites for Orthodox Christians as well. Historically, four of the five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire (the Pentarchy) represent the modern patriarchal centers of the majority of Orthodox churches. These are, namely, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem \u2013 excluding Rome. Among the Orthodox, there are many monasteries and convents which are held in high honor and sacred veneration. =====Eastern Orthodox Church===== The coastline of Mount Athos in 2007. Church of St. George in Istanbul in 2007. If the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is taken to be one of the most prominent leaders in the Eastern Orthodox Communion, then St. George's Cathedral in Istanbul \u2013 the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarch \u2013 may perhaps be one of the most important religious sites for Eastern Orthodox Christians. Also of particular importance to the Eastern Orthodox Church and particularly the Greek Orthodox Church is the peninsular Mount Athos, where the most masses in the world are celebrated daily in the Byzantine Rite. Mount Athos arguably comprises the largest community of Christian monastics, ascetics, and mystics (specifically hesychasts) in the world. It is home to twenty Eastern Orthodox monasteries under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch. =====Oriental Orthodox churches===== A road in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia leading to the Holy Trinity Cathedral, the patriarchate of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and a sacred place for members of the Rastafari movement. Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat, Armenia, in 2009. Oriental Orthodoxy is the faith of those Eastern Christian churches that recognize only three ecumenical councils \u2013 the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople and the First Council of Ephesus. They rejected the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon (c. 451). Hence, these Oriental Orthodox Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches, Miaphysite Churches, or the Non-Chalcedonian Churches. These churches are generally not in communion with any of the multifarious Eastern Orthodox Churches but they are in dialogue for a return to unity.Syrian Orthodox Resources \u2013 Middle Eastern Oriental Orthodox Common Declaration Despite the potentially confusing nomenclature (Oriental meaning Eastern), Oriental Orthodox churches are distinct from those that are collectively referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises five basic groups: Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, and Armenian Apostolic churches.Oriental Orthodox Churches These churches, while being in communion with one another, are hierarchically independent.An Introduction to the Oriental Orthodox Churches The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church or Indian Orthodox church is technically autonomous, but still shares some ties with the Syriac Orthodox church. This being the case, each of the six communal churches has their own spiritual headquarters which act as the episcopal sees of their respective Popes or Patriarchs: * Armenian Apostolic \u2014 Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin), Vagharshapat, Armenia * Coptic Orthodox \u2014 St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Abbassia in Cairo, Egypt (formerly St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, Egypt) * Eritrean Orthodox \u2014 Asmara, Eritrea * Ethiopian Orthodox \u2014 Holy Trinity Cathedral, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (see also Rastafari movement) * Indian Orthodox \u2014 Kottayam, India * Syriac Orthodox (includes the Malankara Church and other Saint Thomas Christians) \u2014 Bab Tuma borough, Damascus, Syria (formerly Antioch; temporarily stationed in Homs, Mardin, et al.) ** The Syriac Patriarch himself resides in Dayro d-Mor Ephrem, a monastery near Damascus File:Saint Mark Cathedral, Cairo.jpg|The interior of St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Cairo, Egypt, in 2008. File:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|The interior of St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, Egypt, in 2006. ====Latter-day Saints==== The Holy of Holies as it appeared in the early 20th century. The Salt Lake Temple Latter-day Saints regard with reverence such places as the Garden Tomb and the Garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem, due their connections with the life and ministry of Jesus. Additionally, the most holy place for members of the mainstream LDS Church are the numerous temples around the world, particularly the \"celestial room\" located inside each temple. The purpose of these ordinance rooms is to act as a symbolic representation of the presence of God himself. Additionally, a room inside the Salt Lake Temple, designated as the Holy of Holies, is considered highly sacred due its primary function as a private meditation room for the church's president. Mormon homes are also treated as sacred areas due to the church's emphasis on the sacredness of family union and family-based ceremonies performed in LDS temples. On this subject, the Bible Dictionary in the LDS edition of the Bible states: Once a Mormon family starts dwelling in a home, a special prayer is given by the head of the family (or a close member of the church) asking for the residence to be a shelter against temptation, and dedicating the place to God as long as the family inhabits it. Other venerated sites for Latter-day Saints include historical locations throughout the United States, due to their particular connection to Mormon history and theology. Examples include the Sacred Grove (Palmyra, New York), the Kirtland Temple (Kirtland, Ohio) and Adam-ondi-Ahman (Daviess County, Missouri). However, no mandatory ceremonies are performed in such places. =====Other LDS movement sects===== Mormon breakaway sects, sub-sects and fundamentalist groups sometimes hold the belief that their particular church alone can claim true authority and succession from Joseph Smith, and that other LDS denominations are therefore incorrect or heretical. Thus many sites throughout the United States represent the spiritual headquarters' of these churches: For example, the YFZ Ranch in Eldorado, Texas at one time represented the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) base themselves in Bluffdale, Utah.

File:FLDS Eldorado hi.jpg|The main temple of the YFZ Ranch \u2013 FLDS Church in Eldorado, Texas, in 2006. ====Rastafari movement==== An orthographic projection of Ethiopia in Africa. The Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, an Ethiopian Orthodox Tawahedo cathedral which is also the burial place of Haile Selassie I. Ethiopia is of considerable importance as the setting of the life and death of Haile Selassie. Many Rastas consider Ethiopia the Promised Land. The city of Shashamane is particularly significant. In the capital of Addis Ababa Haile Selassie is buried in the Holy Trinity Cathedral (often called Kidist Selassie, from the Amharic), which is also a significant religious site for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians (see also Oriental Orthodox churches), as it doubles as the seat of the primate of their church. ===Islam=== Pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba during Hajj. The Kaaba, a cuboid structure located within the Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m (Sacred Mosque) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, according to Islamic tradition was rebuilt by Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), and is one of the holiest places in Islam. During his life the Prophet Muhammad laid the Black Stone in one of the corners of the building. Many millions of Muslims visit Mecca and the surrounding areas each year during a pilgrimage known as the Hajj \u2013 the fifth and final pillar of Islam \u2013 during which they circumambulate the Kaaba as part of the ritual. Other significant areas within or surrounding Mecca include areas in which the Hajj takes place, including the Well of Zamzam, Mina and its bridge, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat. The second holiest place for Muslims is the Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina, which is where the Prophet Muhammad is buried under the Green Dome. Caliphs Umar and Abu Bakr are also said to be buried in the Masjid al-Nabawi. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is a sacred place in Sunni traditions as the site from which Muhammad ascended to heaven in the Isra and Mi'raj and was also the first qibla. Mount Sinai also holds significance in Islam.Mount Sinai (Mount Moses) in the Sinai of Egypt Among Shias, the Imam Ali Mosque and Imam Husayn Shrine also hold high significance. Other sites in the Arabian Hejaz are associated with Muhammad: near Mecca, on the mountain of Jabal al-Nour the cave Hira is the place of the Prophet's first revelation. Many other former places of devotion that are historically associated with Muhammad were destroyed under the alleged anti-idolatrous policies of the Wahhabi Saudi government.

File:DomeOfTheRock053011.jpg|The Dome of the Rock (center) and the Al-Aqsa Mosque (surrounding) in Jerusalem. ====Druzism==== Jethro's Tomb in Tiberias, Israel Druzism is a highly distinguished sect of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bli Shi'a Islam, practiced by the Druze community. Most Druze consider themselves Muslims, however most non-Druze Muslims (most Sunnis and many Shi'as) do not regard the Druze as practicing Islam \u2013 and may even condemn their beliefs as shirk (polytheism). The Nabi Shu'ayb, or Tomb of Jethro, near Tiberias in Israel is the most important religious site for the Druze. They have held religious festivals there for centuries and it has been a place of annual pilgrimage. ==== Nation of Islam ==== Mosque Maryam is the international headquarters of the Nation of Islam. ===== Five Percent Nation ===== Five Percenters regard the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City as a place of spiritual importance, referring to the neighborhood as \"Mecca\". They also refer to the Brooklyn borough of New York as \"Medina\". Five Percenters hold a special annual event known as Show and Prove every June at the Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Harlem. ===Judaism=== Map of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. A modern diagram of the Kodesh Hakodashim, or the tabernacle at Solomon's Temple. The Kodesh Hakodashim, Judaism's Holy of Holies, was the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle in the time of Moses as described in the Torah; the term now refers to the space on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem where this sanctuary was located in the Temple in Jerusalem. (This location is often, but controversially, identified as being inaccessible within the footprint of the Islamic Dome of the Rock.) Historically, it could be entered by the High Priest only on Yom Kippur. Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism continue to regard the location as retaining some or all of its sanctity despite the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Entry into sanctified areas has been prohibited in recent times by powerful elements within traditional Judaism, and as a result many religious authorities prohibit or restrict entry into the Temple Mount by observant Jews. Today, Jews recognize the Jewish Quarter of the city, wherein the Mount is located, to be a location of profound spiritual importance. Within the area a stone artifact known as the Western Wall is paramount as the last standing remains of the temple. Along the wall notable featured include the Western Stone and Wilson's Arch. Beneath it a tunnel runs closer toward what was the original Kodesh Hakodashim, ending approximately 150 ft. inward at a place called Warren's Gate. In an alley the Muslim Quarter of the city is a semi-concelead section of the Wall called the Little Western Wall. Aerial view of the Western Wall in 2008. The Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron is the second holiest site in Judaism. Other significant sites include a number of temples within the Jewish quarter of Old Jerusalem, namely the Hurva, Belz, Tiferet Yisrael and the Four Sephardic synagogues. The Beit El Synagogue is of special importance to students of Kaballah. The Biblical Mount Sinai is believed to be the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God \u2013 although there is considerable debate as to the location of the mountain. (Scholarly opinion places it at either the mountain historically known as \"Sinai\" or Mount Seir.) ===Samaritanism=== Samaritans atop Mount Gerizim in 2006. Samaritanism is an Abrahamic or Semitic religion closely related to \u2013 or by some considered an early derivative of \u2013 Judaism, practiced by the Samaritan (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd Shomronim, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646 as-S\u0101mariyy\u016bn) ethnoreligious group, who mostly reside in the region of the Levant and claim ancestry to Israelites with connections to the ancient Eastern Mediterranean kingdom of Samaria. The Samaritan ethnoreligious group and the subsequent Samaritan religion are considered to be, demographically, the smallest of their kind in modern times, with the number of Samaritans worldwide totalling at just 712 as of late 2007. Adherents of Samaritanism consider a formation known as the Holy Rock, atop the summit of Mount Gerizim (Samaritan Hebrew: Ar-gar\u00edzim, Arabic: \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u062c\u0631\u0632\u064a\u0645 Jabal Jariz\u012bm, T.H.: \u05d4\u05b7\u05e8 \u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd Har G\u0259rizz\u00eem, S.H.: \u05d4\u05b7\u05e8 \u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd Har G\u0259rizzim; also romanized as Jirziem), to be their \"holy of holies\". This is comparable with the Temple Mount of Jerusalem as idealized and revered by mainstream Jews \u2013 however Gerizim is located near the Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza (\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628\u0647), adjacent to the Palestinian city of Nablus (present-day Biblical Shechem), in the West Bank. ==Dharmic religions== ===Buddhism=== Purported birthplace of the Buddha in Lumbini, Nepal, a holy shrine also for many non-Buddhists The Bodhi Tree at the Mahabodhi Temple in India.

Lumbini is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Maya gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 563 BCE. Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha. Bodh Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India, is considered by many adherents of Buddhism to be their most holy site. Gautama, who achieved Enlightenment some time around 528 BCE, became the Buddha and founded Buddhism. The Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment while sitting under a peepal tree, called the Bodhi tree, located in Bodhgaya. At this site of his purported enlightenment the Mahabodhi temple now stands. Every year, many Buddhists make pilgrimages from all over the world to visit and meditate at the temple. ====Shugend\u014d==== Pilgrims ascend the steps leading to the entrance of Sanzan Gosaiden temple in 2006, at the summit of Mount Haguro. Shugend\u014d is a small, syncretic, highly esoteric and ascetic sect or sub-sect of Buddhism (mostly related to, and often considered a distinct branch of the Tendai and Shingon schools) combining elements of Zen, Taoism, Koshint\u014d, Japanese folk animism and shamanism. The faith is traditionally believed to have been founded by the \u015brama\u1e47a and mystic-sorcerer En no Gy\u014dja in the 7th or 8th century. In the same manner as the religion of Shint\u014d, Shugend\u014d is largely relegated to Japan. The lay practitioners and monks of Shugend\u014d, called Shugenja or yamabushi respectively, venerate mountains as both spiritual areas and, along with nature as a whole, \"natural ma\u1e47\u1e0dalas\" . Adherents of Shugend\u014d consider the collective Three Mountains of Dewa (consisting of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono), located in the remote Dewa Province of Japan, to be their most sacred of places. The three mountains are also sacred in Shint\u014d. ===Hinduism=== Situated on the banks of river Ganges, Varanasi attracts millions of Hindu pilgrims every year.

All recitations of the Thirumurai (12 holy scriptures of Shaivism) begin and end with the phrase \"Thirucchittrambalam\" (the auspicious holy of holies: chidambaram). Vaishnavites on the other hand consider Sri Rangam as the holiest city and refer to it as the earthly Vaikunta. The \"garbha griha\" (literally womb-house or womb-chamber), the shrine inside a temple complex where the main deity is installed in an area that is in a separate building by itself inside the complex, is the most sacred site within the temple complex. The garbha griha usually contains the murti (idol or icon), the primary focus of prayer. In temples with a spire or vimana, this chamber is placed directly underneath it, and the two them form a main vertical axis of the temple. These together may be understood to represent the axis of the world through Mount Meru. The garbha griha is usually also on the main horizontal axis of the temple which generally is an east\u2013west axis. In those temples where there is also a cross-axis, the garbha griha is generally at their intersection.
