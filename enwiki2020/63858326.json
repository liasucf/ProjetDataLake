Interview with K.O. Nagorsnik on wn.de; accessed on May 4, 2020. (second-best German participant) Nagorsnik won the Germany Cup several times in the German Quizzing Association. As a single player or together with a partner, he takes part in the annual German Quizzing Championship with varying successes. He is the organizer of a monthly pub quiz that takes place in various bars in the city of M\u00fcnster and works on the questions. == Chaser == As a chaser at Gefragt - Gejagt, the German adaptation of The Chase, Klaus Otto Nagorsnik bears the battle name The Librarian. His distinguishing features are a well-groomed beard and wearing bow ties with the jacket. He has been on the show regularly since 2014 and had 105 appearances (as of the end of March 2020). He was able to win 69 of his appearances, around 66 percent. In the remaining 34 percent, Nagorsnik's opposing team won an average of 5,456 euros per appearance, which was rather at the lower end of the profit potential compared to the other chasers. For every appearance in the quiz show, he receives a fee from the television station; the sums he offers to the quiz participants are coordinated with the management of the television station within a span, i. e. Nagorsnik does not have to pay anything out of pocket. == References == == External links == * Ratefuchs from M\u00fcnster chases candidates on TV on www.die-glocke.de (local news from M\u00fcnster). * Thomas Heusner: The quiz champion Klaus Otto Nagorsnik on www.youtube.com; 2:56 minutes. * Alexander Bommes in an interview with Klaus Otto Nagorsnik, 2016 on Das Erste.
