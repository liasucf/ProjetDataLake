He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. He is said to have been the first king in Ireland whose subjects wore gold rings (Old Irish failge) on their hands. He ruled for ten years before being killed, either by S\u00edrna mac D\u00e9in, or by his successor Ollom Fotla, whose father, F\u00edachu F\u00ednscothach, had been killed by Failderd\u00f3it's father Muinem\u00f3n.R.
