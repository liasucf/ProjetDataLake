There is no record of his voting in any division. Chauncy died unmarried on 27 March 1733. Edgcote House descended to Richard Chauncey in 1742 who built a new mansion between 1747 and 1752. ==References== Category:1674 births Category:1733 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1727\u20131734 ",
