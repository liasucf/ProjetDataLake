    "text": "The Grampians viewed from Botanical Hill The Grampians are a set of prominent hills forming the southeast backdrop of Nelson, New Zealand, reaching high. Frequented by locals and tourists alike, the Grampians are covered in a myriad of tracks ranging from leisurely strolls to relatively taxing steep inclines. Entry points to this recreational area are from * The top of Collingwood Street * The corner of Van Diemen and Trafalgar streets * Market Road, Bishopdale A TV transmitter at the top of the Grampians is visible from most of Nelson. Several community and volunteer groups are working towards restoring habitats for native birds on the Grampians by reducing the impact of predators, using pest control methods in conjunction with the Brook Waimarama Sanctuary. ==Areas of interest== The main track zigzags up to the ridge of the hills, providing access to good views over most of Nelson. A lookout near the top offers views over much of the Nelson region. ==References== Category:Hills of New Zealand Category:Landforms of the Nelson Region Category:Tourist attractions in the Nelson Region ",
