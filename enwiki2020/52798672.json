The film was shot in British Columbia, Canada. ==Premise== A father (Gross) and his two children (Milligan, Ferguson) take a trip up to a log cabin in the mountains. Duncan (Hasselhoff) is a diamonds smuggler who unintentionally crashes his plane causing an avalanche that traps the family inside their cabin. He is rescued by the family. While they are trying to dig their way out to freedom, he instead aggressively forces them to search for the diamonds he had smuggled from Russia. ==Critical reception== In his Variety review, critic Tony Scott called Avalanche \"a solid thriller\", highlighting the \"stunning\" camerawork, editing and the musical score. However, AllMovie's Bernadette McCallion was less enthusiastic and only gave the film 2 out of 5 stars. ==Cast== * Michael Gross as Brian Kemp * Deanna Milligan as Deidre Kemp * Myles Ferguson as Max Kemp * David Hasselhoff as Duncan Snyder * Don S.
