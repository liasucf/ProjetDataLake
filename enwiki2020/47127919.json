He then made his Premier League debut on 9 August, playing the first 79 minutes before being substituted for Kevin Nolan as West Ham won 2\u20130 away to Arsenal. Following his start, Oxford became the second-youngest Premier League starter of all-time, after Jose Baxter.

On his 18th birthday, 16 December 2016, Oxford signed a new, four-and-a-half year contract with West Ham. Just over one month later, he was sent on loan to Reading for the remainder of the season. He made his Reading debut on 11 March 2017 in a 3\u20130 away defeat to Preston North End, coming on as a second-half substitute for Paul McShane.

On 12 December, Oxford made his first league start for Gladbach, against Freiburg. After the match, sporting director Max Eberl praised Oxford's development during his time at the club and stated exploratory talks had taken place over a permanent deal. His loan was cut short and he returned to West Ham on 29 December 2017. On 31 January 2018, Oxford was loaned to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach again. On 31 January 2019, Oxford again went out on loan, this time joining German team FC Augsburg until the end of the season. Oxford made nine appearances for Augsburg, his final game coming in the last day of the Bundesliga season in an 8\u20131 defeat by Wolfsburg. On 2 August 2019, Oxford joined Augsburg permanently on a four-year deal. ==International career== Oxford has played for England up to under-20 level and captained his country at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.
