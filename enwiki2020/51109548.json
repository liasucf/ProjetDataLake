Through the re-examination of exotic rocks that had been discovered but neglected by other geologists, Sinitsyn identified these rocks as kimberlites and that the Archangel region of the Soviet Union was diamondiferous. Based on this research he led teams that discovered the Lomonosov and Grib diamond mines, the latter considered to be one of the largest diamond mines in the world. == Early life and education == Sinitsyn was born in Leningrad, May 18, 1939 to a family of scientists and geologists and as a child lived in China and Central Asia. In 1956 he enrolled at the Geological Department of the Leningrad State University and graduated with honors in 1961.
