He is the 2018 Olympic bronze medalist, a two-time World champion (2015, 2016), a two-time World bronze medalist (2013, 2014), a seven-time European champion (2013\u20132019), a two-time Grand Prix Final silver medalist (2014, 2015), a three-time Rostelecom Cup champion (2014\u20132016), a two-time Grand Prix in France champion (2016\u20132017) and an eight-time Spanish national champion (2010, 2012\u20132018). In addition to his bronze medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics, Fern\u00e1ndez placed 14th at the 2010 Winter Olympics and 4th at the 2014 Winter Olympics. He is the first skater from Spain to medal at an Olympic Games, ISU Championship or a Grand Prix event. Fern\u00e1ndez is the second man to break the 100-point barrier in the short program, the 200-point barrier in the long program, and the 300-point barrier in the total score. As of 24 May 2017, he has the second highest personal best scores in both segments and third highest in the combined score. In recognition of his achievements, Fern\u00e1ndez received the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit by the Spanish government on 19 April 2016. ==Personal life== Javier Fern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez was born on 15 April 1991 in Madrid. He is the younger of two children born to Enriqueta, a mail carrier, and Antonio, an army mechanic. Their father stated, \"Between the two children we were spending \u20ac450 a month when my earnings were less than \u20ac1,500\". When Javier went to the United States to train, Antonio took a second job repairing helicopters to cover the expenses. His older sister, Laura, competed in ladies' singles and ice dancing. Fern\u00e1ndez intends to become a coach after his competitive skating career ends. He is a fan of Real Madrid C.F.. Fern\u00e1ndez relocated to Hackensack, New Jersey in the United States in the late summer of 2008. He moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the summer of 2011. ==Career== ===Early career=== Fern\u00e1ndez started skating at the age of six, after his older sister began taking lessons. For a while, he also played soccer, tennis, and ice hockey, but dropped the other sports to focus on skating at age eight. He skated at a small rink in the San Mart\u00edn district before switching a year later to a rink in Majadahonda. One of his earliest coaches was Carolina Sanz, who stated that he had natural talent but initially lacked discipline. Fern\u00e1ndez landed his first triple jump at the age of 12. He had to leave Majadahonda after his sister decided to switch to the Jaca skating club, which offered to cover her costs. The youngest Fern\u00e1ndez joined his sister in Jaca six months later. Fern\u00e1ndez began skating in senior events in the 2006\u20132007 season, but failed to qualify for the free skate at the European Championships and the World Championships in his debut season. After two years in Jaca, where he had been teased and discouraged by a lack of improvement in his skating, he returned to Madrid and considered switching to hockey. ===2008\u201309 season=== In 2008, Fern\u00e1ndez attended a summer camp in Andorra where Russian coach Nikolai Morozov was an instructor. Morozov offered to train him in the United States and Fern\u00e1ndez quickly agreed. Fern\u00e1ndez relocated to Hackensack, New Jersey in late summer 2008. Although he shared an apartment with a Spanish coach and Morozov charged him nothing for coaching, his expenses in the United States were between \u20ac2,000 and \u20ac3,000 a month and he received no financial support from Spain. Fern\u00e1ndez had a breakthrough season in 2008\u20132009, finishing 11th at the 2009 European Championships and qualifying an Olympic spot for Spain with his 19th-place result at the 2009 World Championships. He was the first Spanish men's skater to qualify for the Olympics since 1956. ===2009\u201310 season=== Fern\u00e1ndez received his first senior Grand Prix assignment, the 2009 Troph\u00e9e Eric Bompard where he finished 11th. He was eighth at the 2010 European Championships, earning two spots for Spain in the following year's event. In his first Olympics, Fern\u00e1ndez placed 16th in the short program, 10th in the free skate, and finished 14th overall. He was the first man in half a century to compete for Spain in Olympic figure skating \u2013 since the 1956 Olympics when Dario Villalba competed. Fern\u00e1ndez set a new personal best score on his way to a 12th-place finish at the 2010 World Championships. He added the 4T to his jump repertoire in the 2009\u201310 season. ===2010\u201311 season=== Fernandez performs his Pirates of the Caribbean program at the 2011 World Figure Skating Championships. After Morozov moved back to Russia, Fern\u00e1ndez trained with him in Moscow and also Daugavpils in neighboring Latvia. His assigned events for the 2010\u201311 ISU Grand Prix season were the 2010 Skate Canada International and the 2010 Cup of Russia. He placed fifth at Skate Canada and ninth at Cup of Russia. At the 2011 Spanish Championships, Fern\u00e1ndez cut his hand during the warm-up and received medical attention for twenty minutes, leaving him no time to warm up again. He was unable to defend his title, placing second behind Javier Raya. Since Spain had two men's slots at the 2011 European Championships due to Fern\u00e1ndez' result the previous year, both skaters were sent to Bern, Switzerland. Fern\u00e1ndez fell twice in the short program, leaving him in eleventh place, but was able to move up to ninth after the free skate and once again earned two spots for Spain at the next Europeans. At the 2011 World Championships, Fern\u00e1ndez landed two different quads, (toe loop and Salchow), in the free skate. He earned his first top-ten finish at the event, giving Spain two spots for the 2012 Worlds men's event. In June 2011, Fern\u00e1ndez confirmed that he was no longer working with Morozov and would temporarily train in Canada with Brian Orser. This was due to instability resulting from Morozov's training group moving around frequently and Morozov's focus on Florent Amodio. He said that adding a quad to his short program and improving his basic skating were some of his goals for the 2011\u201312 season. ===2011\u201312 season=== Fern\u00e1ndez at the 2011 Skate Canada International. Fern\u00e1ndez finished 4th at his first competition of the season, the 2011 Nebelhorn Trophy. At an interview conducted at the event, he said that he would continue to train in Canada, with David Wilson and Jeffrey Buttle as his choreographers. Fern\u00e1ndez and Orser said they were working on saving energy and improving spins, transitions and skating skills. His assigned events for the 2011\u201312 Grand Prix season were Skate Canada and Cup of Russia. At Skate Canada, Fern\u00e1ndez executed the only clean quadruple jump in the short program to take the lead over Daisuke Takahashi and Patrick Chan. He placed second in the free skate and won the silver medal overall, exceeding his combined total personal best by over thirty points. He became the first Spanish skater to win a Grand Prix medal. At the Cup of Russia, he placed fourth in the short program, first in the free skate, and finished second overall with an overall total of 241.63 points \u2014 only 0.03 behind gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan.

In Quebec City, he was third in the short program and fourth in the long to win the bronze medal, and in so doing, became the first Spaniard to medal at a Grand Prix Final. Fern\u00e1ndez reclaimed his national title, winning by over eighty points. The remainder of the season proved less successful for Fern\u00e1ndez. Although considered a medal favorite at the 2012 Europeans, he finished sixth. At the 2012 World Championships, Fern\u00e1ndez placed fifth in the short program but dropped to ninth overall after the free skate. After these results, he agreed to perform full run-throughs of his programs more frequently in practice. ===2012\u201313 season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=right |- ! colspan=2 | ISU abbreviations: Jumps |- !

He cited his satisfaction with winning the bronze medal in PyeongChang to finish his season as the reason for the decision. Fern\u00e1ndez also stated his intention to leave Canada, where he had trained since 2011, and return to Madrid to promote figure skating in Spain. Although he did not rule out future competitions entirely, he confirmed that he would not participate in another World Championships or Olympics. === 2018\u201319 season === With the establishment of the new +5 / -5 Grade of Execution (GOE) scale at the start of the season, all previously recorded scores since the 2004 introduction of the ISU Judging System (IJS) were archived as historical statistics. During the 14 seasons the +3 / -3 GOE scale was in use, Fern\u00e1ndez achieved the 2nd highest personal best short program score (109.05), the 3rd highest free skating score (216.41) and the 4th highest total score (314.93). Fern\u00e1ndez decided to skip the 2018\u201319 Grand Prix series, and elected to skate at the Japan Open invitational tournament as his only competition during the first part of the season. He competed for Team Europe at the event, and placed 3rd among men with a score of 157.86 for his free program. Team Europe won the silver medal overall. On 28 November, Fern\u00e1ndez officially stated that he would retire from competitive skating, with the 2019 European Figure Skating Championships as his last competition. Speaking about his decision, he expressed the need to think about the level of competition he wanted to be at, because he felt his body and mind were no longer there, which he had to accept. He added that he preferred to retire at the right time, when he was satisfied with his career and had plans for the future, referring among other projects to his Revolution ON Ice skating show, with which he toured Spain in November and December 2018. The news of his retirement was widely reported in Spanish as well as global media. It was also confirmed that Fern\u00e1ndez would not compete at the Spanish National Championships in December. Fern\u00e1ndez returned to his Toronto base in early January to train for three weeks leading up to the 2019 European Figure Skating Championships. As a tribute to his home country, he selected two Spanish themed programs from his earlier repertoire for his final competition: Malague\u00f1a as the short program, and Man of La Mancha for the free skate. \"I have chosen these two programs to pay tribute to all those fans who with their flags gave me the strength to continue fighting and give the best of myself in so many places around the world.\" Fern\u00e1ndez placed third in the short program at European Championships with 91.84 points after stepping out of the landing of the triple Axel and receiving an underrotation call on his quad Salchow. Fern\u00e1ndez was displeased with his scores: \"I've seen mistakes today in figure skating I've not seen in my whole life. I had a cheated quad Salchow today that was not [cheated]. I saw it on the ice and it was not.\" Referring to the 8.65 point lead Russia's Mikhail Kolyada had over him after the short program, he said: \"I'm known for comebacks so if they let me tomorrow, I'll do it.\" In the free skate, Fern\u00e1ndez landed two quads (with a turnout on the landing of the second jump of his quad-triple toe loop combination), two triple Axels and three more triples, but missed out on his triple flip attempt. He finished first in the segment with 179.75 points, receiving the highest free program component scores (94.20) since the introduction of the revised scoring system at the start of the season, and rose from third to first overall with 271.59 points. Fern\u00e1ndez retired from competitive figure skating with the third highest number of consecutive European titles behind pairs skater Irina Rodnina (who had won 10) and men's skater Karl Sch\u00e4fer (with 8). Commenting on what he leaves behind as legacy, Fern\u00e1ndez stated: \"I think it's good for the world to know that not only skaters from strong countries can appear. I'm from Spain, I\u2019ve got a friend here at my side from Italy [bronze medalist Matteo Rizzo] and another from Russia [silver medalist Alexander Samarin]. Everyone has his own story to tell and it's good that everyone does not come from a strong figure skating country because that means more stories to tell to everyone. I hope I can develop skating more in my home country to try and make it bigger, but I hope with the work I was able to do I've made history and in 20 years some people will still recollect my name.\" As for what heritage he would like to leave to skaters, he said: \"I would like to leave behind a question to think about. What do they prefer: jumps, skating skills or performance? I would like to see these from more skaters. I think this is what our sport needs \u2013 complete skaters who embody something from every aspect of the sport.\" When asked about what his student's legacy to the sport will be, long-time coach Brian Orser said: \"For me and Tracy [Wilson, coaching partner], he is our \u201cposter child,\u201d the very example of what we do with our style of training and coaching. He has done something great for men's skating. He is a perfect model for what male skating should be: athletic and aesthetic, bringing a very personal style. He is also the young boy from Spain who made it. This is something very important and special about him. He promotes skating in his home country, through his shows all over Spain and skating camps. I\u2019ve seen him teaching. He teaches technique and style the way we do. This makes me very proud. He will be an excellent coach.\" ==Awards== Royal Order of Sports Merit of Spain * Gold Medal (2016) Spanish Olympic Committee * Outstanding Athlete of the Year (2014, 2018) National Sports Council * National Sports Awards: King Felipe Award for Best Sportsman (2015) Media * : Athlete of the Year 2015 (2015) * Madrid Sports Press Association (APDM): Individual Athlete of the Year (2017) * La Raz\u00f3n: Uss\u00eda Awards \"Personage of the Year\" (2019) * Marca: 80th Anniversary Awards \"Spirit of Success in Sport: Perfection\" (2018), Marca Leyenda (2019) Municipality * of the Community of Madrid: Grand Cross (2015) * : Gold Medal (2017) * : Gold Medal (2017) ==Programs== Fern\u00e1ndez at the 2015\u201316 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final Fern\u00e1ndez at the 2015\u201316 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final Fern\u00e1ndez at the 2011\u201312 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final Fern\u00e1ndez at the 2011 European Figure Skating Championships === Post-2019 === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
