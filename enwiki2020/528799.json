The modern village was planned in 1814 to resettle communities that had been removed from the surrounding straths as part of the Highland Clearances. ==Toponymy== Helmsdale river (Gaelic Ilidh) is noted by Ptolemy as Ila, which remains an obscure name. The Gaelic name for the village, Bun Ilidh, means Ilie-foot. Norse settlers called the strath Hjalmundal, meaning Dale of the Helmet, from which the modern village name Helmsdale is derived. ==History== Helmsdale Castle, the remains of which were demolished in the 1970s in order to build the new A9 road bridge, was the location of the murder of the 11th Earl of Sutherland in 1567. The Earl and his Countess Marie Seton were poisoned by Isobel Sinclair.Fraser, William, ed., Sutherland Book, vol.1 (1892), pp.121-4, 127-9 The previous bridge, which still stands, was designed by Thomas Telford and completed in 1811. The last force-fire in Helmsdale was in about 1818. ===Gold rush=== Two tributaries of the river were the scene of a gold rush in 1869. The history of Kildonan's gold started in 1818, when a single nugget of gold was found near the Suisgill and Kildonan burns. Late in 1868, a brief announcement in a local newspaper stated that gold had been discovered at Kildonan in the county of Sutherland. The credit for the discovery goes to Robert Nelson Gilchrist, a native of Kildonan, who had spent 17 years in the goldfields of Australia. On his return home, the Duke of Sutherland gave him permission to pan the gravels of the Helmsdale River, and he prospected all the burns and tributaries. ===World War II and after=== During World War II, the Royal Air Force built Loth Chain Home radar station at Crakaig, a few miles south-west of Helmsdale. There was also an RAF Chain Home Low radar station at Navidale, about a mile north-east of Helmsdale. During the Cold War there was a Composite Signals Organisation (CSO) radio monitoring station in Helmsdale itself. The CSO is associated with GCHQ. ===Recent developments=== On 3 August 2008, the Highlands and Islands Council announced plans to modernise and catalyse industry in Helmsdale and its surrounding areas. This included a \u00a33.5 million revamp of the harbour and the development of two battery processing factories. Work on the harbour was set to begin in spring 2009, while the battery plants were expected to open before May 2009. It was hoped up to 50 new jobs would be created. ==Location and transport== West Helmsdale lies across the river from the main village above the railway station; Old Helmsdale is immediately to the north while East Helmsdale is a settlement less than a mile to the east. The village is on the A9 road, at a junction with the A897 to Melvich, and has a railway station on the Far North Line. Buses operate about every two hours from Monday to Saturday and infrequently on Sundays from Helmsdale to Brora, Golspie, Dornoch, Tain and Inverness in the south and Berriedale, Dunbeath, Halkirk, Thurso and Scrabster in the north. These are on route X99 and are operated by Stagecoach in the Highlands, but tickets can be bought on the Citylink website. ==Tourism, culture and sport== Facilities in Helmsdale include an independent youth hostel, a heritage centre, an art gallery, and an inn. Helmsdale hosts a Highland Games which are held on the third Saturday in August each year. For the evening Marquee Dance the village population of 700 doubles thanks to visitors attending the dance. Helmsdale is home to Bunillidh Thistle F.C. and Helmsdale United. ==Economy== Helmsdale is a fishing port at the estuary of the River Helmsdale. It was once the home of one of the largest herring fleets in Europe. ==People from Helmsdale== *Professor Andrew Rutherford CBE (1929\u20131998), Vice-Chancellor of the University of London from 1994 to 1997. *David Mackay (pilot), Chief Pilot of Virgin Galactic, and a former test pilot.
