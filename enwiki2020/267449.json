Sakhnin is situated on an ancient site, where remains from columns and cisterns have been found.Dauphin, 1998, pp. 663-664 It was mentioned as Sogane, a town fortified in 66, by Josephus.Tsafrir et al, 1994, p. 235 A cistern, excavated near the mosque in the old city centre, revealed pottery fragments dating from the 1st to the 5th century CE.Tahan, 2005, Sakhnin Haninah ben Teradion, who was arrested by the Roman authorities for heresy (minut),Joshua Schwartz, Peter J. Tomson,'When Rabbi Eliezer was arrested for heresy,' Jewish Studies, an Internet Journal 2012, vol.10, pp.1-37 p.20, n.59disobeying a decree by Hadrian that forbade the teaching of Jewish law and accepting his martyrdom as the will of heaven, is said to have run a Torah academy there. It may be the village Kfar Sikhnin referred to in rabbinical accounts of the aftermath of the trial of the tanna Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus for heresy. Once the case was dismissed Rabbi Akiva came to visit and asked him if he had ever been pleased in hearing some teaching from a heretic. this query prompted Eliezer to recall an encounter on the road of Sepphoris, with a certain Yaakov from Kfar Sikhnin. Yaakov referred to him a teaching from Yeshua ben Pantiri/Yeshu ha-notsri, usually identified as Jesus, which Eliezer admits pleased him.Schwartz, Tomson, 'When Rabbi Eliezer was arrested for heresy,' 2012 p.6 n.15. In 1961 the biblical archaeologist Bellarmino Bagatti, during a visit to the village, was shown a tomb venerated by Christians, Jews and Muslims, which local tradition identified as that of James the Just. On returning to the village, he discovered that restoration had been undertaken and the site renamed the burial place of Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin. Richard Bauckham has raised the possibility that the Yaakov of Sikhnin in accounts of rabbi Eliezer may be James the grandson of Jude.Richard Bauckham, Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015 p.116.

It finally fell without battle during Operation Hiram, 29\u201331 October 1948. Many of the inhabitants fled north but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers.Morris, 1987, p. 226 The town remained under martial law until 1966. In 1976, it became the site of the first Land Day marches, in which six Israeli Arabs were killed by Israeli forces during violent protests of government expropriation of of Arab-owned land near Sakhnin. Later that same year, three more civilians were killed during clashes with the police. Two natives of the city were killed in Jerusalem during the al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000. The Israeli transcription of the Arabic toponym is an orthographic error, writing Sakhnas instead of Sakhnin.Liora Bigon,Amer Dahamshe, 'An anatomy of symbolic power: Israeli road-sign policy and the Palestinian minority,' Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 2014, volume 32, pages 606 \u2013 621 p.613. ==Sports == Doha Stadium In 2003, the town's football club, Bnei Sakhnin, became one of the first Arab teams to play in the Israeli Premier League, the top tier of Israeli football.Soccer: In Israel and Italy, storied teams rise International Herald Tribune, 15 April 2007 The following year, the club won the State Cup, and was the first Arab team to do so; consequently, it participated in the UEFA Cup the following season, losing out to Newcastle United.
