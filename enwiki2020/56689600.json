    "text": "Somethingness is the ninth studio album by Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace (OLP). Produced under Warner Music Records label by Jason Lader, who also produced their preceding album Curve, this is the band's first studio album in nearly six years and it was heavily promoted using the PledgeMusic platform, a website which facilitates musicians reaching out to their fans to market and distribute music. It is the first OLP album to have been released in two separate volumes; Vol. 1 was released as an EP in August 2017, and the remainder of the album (initially referred to as Vol. 2) was released on February 23, 2018, and contained all of the songs from Vol. 1. The album is the first not to feature original drummer Jeremy Taggart, who departed from the band in 2014, and is the first to feature Jason Pierce, who officially replaced Taggart in 2016. ==Track listing== The official track listing includes the four songs initially released as part of Vol. 1, \"Drop Me in the Water\", \"Hiding Place for Hearts\", \"Falling into Place\", and \"Nice to Meet You\". == Personnel == Information adapted from AllMusic credits listing database. * Duncan Coutts \u2013 bass guitar, background vocals * Raine Maida \u2013 vocals, lyricist * Steve Mazur \u2013 guitar, background vocals * Jason Pierce \u2013 drums, percussion * Jason Lader \u2013 production, design, piano * Spike Stent \u2013 mixing * Brian Lucey \u2013 mastering == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} == References == Category:2017 albums Category:2018 albums Category:Our Lady Peace albums Category:Self-released albums Category:Albums produced by Raine Maida ",
