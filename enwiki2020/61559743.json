    "text": "Malheur City is a ghost town in Baker County, Oregon, United States, situated along Willow Creek. The town was established in 1863 after miners struck gold in the nearby El Dorado mine. Originally located in Baker County, Malheur City became part of Malheur County after the county's formation in 1887. The town became unpopulated around 1911 after mining operations slowed in the area. On August 16, 1957, a brushfire burned all of the town's remaining wooden structures, leaving only stone foundations. ==References== Category:Former populated places in Malheur County, Oregon Category:Ghost towns in Oregon Category:Populated places established in 1863 Category:1863 establishments in Oregon ",
