    "text": "The Gunner Ministry is the ministry of the eleventh Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Michael Gunner. It came into operation on 31 August 2016. ==First (caretaker) ministry== Although Territory Labor's landslide victory in the 2016 election was beyond doubt, a number of prospective ministers\u2014including Labor deputy leader and presumptive Deputy Chief Minister Lynne Walker\u2014had not been confirmed as winners in their seats. For this reason, Gunner had himself, Natasha Fyles, and Nicole Manison sworn in as an interim three-person government on 31 August 2016 until a full ministry could be named. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Gunner also announced that all backbench members of his large caucus will serve as junior ministers, at no extra cost to taxpayers. The new cabinet was sworn in the following day. Notably, it was majority-female; five of its eight members were women. {| class=wikitable ! Portfolio !
