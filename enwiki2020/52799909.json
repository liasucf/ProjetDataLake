The church was built on a one-acre plot of land given by Barbara Rawdon-Hastings, Marchioness of Hastings to the designs of the architect Henry Isaac Stevens. The corner stone was laid on 7 November 1845 by Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe, in the presence of Hon. Capt. Curzon and the Rev. Marmaduke Vavasour. Transept arches were built into the walls to provide for any future enlargement. The apse was laid with Minton black, buff and red encaustic tiles. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Peterborough, Rt. Revd. George Davys on 8 December 1846. ==Parish status== The church is in a joint parish with *St Margaret\u2019s Church, Blackfordby ==Organ== A pipe organ was built by Albert E Pease. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. ==References== Woodville Woodville Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1846 ",
