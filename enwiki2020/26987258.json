The song was chosen internally by broadcaster ORTF. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Lama performed 7th in the running order, following Spain and preceding Luxembourg. \"Un jardin sur la terre\" was a song very much in the traditional French chanson style, contrasting with much of the more generic Eurovision fare which surrounded it.
