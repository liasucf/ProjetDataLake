    "text": "The 2018 Alabama State Senate elections are taking place as part of the biennial United States elections. Alabama voters elected state senators in all 35 of the state Senate's districts. State senators serve four-year terms in the Alabama State Senate. A statewide map of Alabama's state Senate districts can be obtained from the Alabama State Legislature here, and individual district maps can be obtained from the U.S. Census here. A primary election on June 5, 2018 and a runoff election on July 17, 2018 determined which candidates appear on the November 6 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained from the Alabama Secretary of State's website. Following the 2014 state Senate elections, Republicans maintained effective control of the House with a 27-seat majority\u201426 Republican members and 1 independent who caucuses with the Republicans. Democrats hold 8 seats following the 2014 elections. To claim control of the chamber from Republicans, the Democrats would have needed to net 10 Senate seats. The election resulted in the Republican Party holding all previously held seats and taking a seat previously held by an independent who caucused with the Republicans, leading to no effective shift in control of the chamber. The Republicans also gained slightly in the popular vote compared to the 2014 elections. ==Summary of Results by State Senate District== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\" ! colspan=\"1\" class=\"unsortable\"|District ! class=\"unsortable\"|Incumbent ! colspan=\"2\"| Party ! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator ! colspan=\"2\"| Party |- | 1st | Tim Melson | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | Tim Melson | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 2nd | William L.
