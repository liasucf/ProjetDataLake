    "text": "Munch Mobile is a top-down driving game released in arcades in 1983. Developed by SNK, it was licensed to Centuri for the US release. SNK published the game in Japan as Joyful Road. The player controls an anthropomorphic car that uses extending arms to grab items from alongside the road. In 1984, Texas Instruments published a port for the TI-99/4A. ==Gameplay== The game is viewed in the top-down perspective and automatically scrolls forward. The goal is to reach the garage at the far end of the road. The player drives a car with a large hand attached that is used to collect objects along the road. The left 8-way stick controls the car, the right two-way stick controls the hands. Fruits give points and gas containers give more fuel. Players can gain extra points by disposing of the leftover fruit in the trash cans. Trees and other obstacls injure the hand, making it temporarily unusable. Player lives are lost when players run out of fuel or hit other cars. ==References== Category:1983 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Racing video games Category:SNK games Category:Texas Instruments TI-99/4A games Category:Top-down racing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
