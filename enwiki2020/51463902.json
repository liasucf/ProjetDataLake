She won four medals in three different African Championships in Athletics from 1989 and 1992, including one gold in 800 metres at the 1992 edition in June of that year. Only a month later she competed for Ethiopia at the 1992 Summer Olympics in the same event, but ran 2:11.60, more than five seconds slower than at the continental championships, and finished sixth in her qualifying heat, failing to progress to the semi- finals. As of 2016, Hailemariam still holds the Ethiopian national 400 m hurdles record (57.60) she ran at the 1987 All-Africa Games in Nairobi. ==Achievements== {| |- |1987 |All-Africa Games |Nairobi, Kenya |bgcolor=\"cc9966\"|3rd |400 m hurdles |57.60 (NR) |- |rowspan=2|1989 |rowspan=2|African Championships |rowspan=2|Lagos, Nigeria |bgcolor=silver|2nd |800 m |2:08.20 |- |bgcolor=\"cc9966\"|3rd |400 m hurdles |59.51 |- |1990 |African Championships |Cairo, Egypt |bgcolor=\"cc9966\"|3rd |800 m |2:15.14 |- |1991 |All-Africa Games |Cairo, Egypt |bgcolor=silver|2nd |800 m |2:04.99 |- |rowspan=2|1992 |African Championships |Belle-Vue, Mauritius |bgcolor=gold|1st |800 m |2:06.20 |- |Summer Olympics |Barcelona, Spain |29th |800 m |2:11.60 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic athletes of Ethiopia Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Ethiopian female middle-distance runners Category:African Games silver medalists for Ethiopia Category:African Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:African Games bronze medalists for Ethiopia Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1987 All- Africa Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1991 All-Africa Games ",
