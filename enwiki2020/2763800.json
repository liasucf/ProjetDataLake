    "text": "Pont-Aven () Breton:'River Bridge' is a commune in the Finist\u00e8re department of Brittany in northwestern France. ==Population== Inhabitants of Pont-Aven are called in French Pontavenistes. ==History== * Pont-Aven is mentioned among the towns which took part in the Breton anti-tax Rebellion of the Red Bonnets against Louis XIV of France in 1675. ==Arts== Pont-Aven is mainly known because of the group of artists who flocked round \u00c9mile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, and who were joined in 1888 by Paul S\u00e9rusier. They were collectively known as \"Pont-Aven School\" (French: \u00c9cole de Pont-Aven, Breton: Skol Pont- Aven). Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art (PASCA) is an international fine arts program located in the historic artists' colony of Pont-Aven (Brittany, France). The student body is made up of third-year university or art college honors students or post-baccalaureate art majors (fourth/fifth-year) seeking further study. The Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts de Pont-Aven houses a historical reconstruction of Pont-Aven at the end of the 19th century as well as a permanent collection dedicated to the Pont-Aven School. Pont Aven still attracts artists and art lovers with many commercial galleries in addition to the town's public gallery. Pont-Aven, le port ==Geography== The Aven River runs through Pont-Aven. The river has relatively favourable water quality, with pH levels slightly alkaline at about 8.5 and electrical conductivity of 19 micro Siemens per centimeter.Hogan, C Michael, \"Water quality of fresh water bodies in northern France\", Lumina Press, Aberdeen, Scotland 2006 The town is at the interface of the tidal estuary and the freshwater river. ==Sights== Before Pont-Aven attracted Gauguin and other artists it was a centre for milling with the river Aven being divided above the town to provide a mill race which powers a series of water mills. Whilst several of these retain their wheels only the last, the Moulin Poulguin, is still capable of operating. The mill is now a restaurant and you can see the machinery inside. Just outside the town are the beech woods of the Bois d'Amour, a source of inspiration for many artists. The town is close to Domaine de Kerlann Holiday Park on the road to the adjoining commune of Nevez. To the northwest of the town, in the small community of Nizon, the ruins of Ch\u00e2teau de Rust\u00e9phan are to be found. Nizon was more famous than Pont-Aven at the 19th century but the painters made it well known. ==Popular culture== The Brittany Ferries flagship is named after the town. Les Galettes de Pont-Aven is a 1975 drama on the life of a middle-aged aspirant painter who settles in the town. Pont-Aven is the setting for Death in Brittany (2012), the first book in the series of Commissaire Dupin detective novels by Jean-Luc Bannalec (J\u00f6rg Bong). ==See also== *Communes of the Finist\u00e8re department *Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Pont- Aven * Paroisse de Pont-Aven ==References== ==External links== *Official website *French Ministry of Culture list for Pont-Aven * Pont-Aven Art Museum * Pont-Aven School of Contemporary Art * Information on L'Aven Project and John Melvin Category:Communes of Finist\u00e8re Category:Artist colonies ",
