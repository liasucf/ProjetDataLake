Serra do Bouro once belonged to the municipality of \u00d3bidos, but the freguesia was transferred to Caldas da Rainha as this latter municipality developed economically. Two other freguesias of Caldas da Rainha were once part of Serra do Bouro, but were elevated to the status of freguesia themselves: Foz do Arelho in 1919 and Nadadouro in 1957. == History == The area of Serra, as the locals know it, was first inhabited by the Veiga family in the 16th century. This freguesia changed little throughout much time. Electricity and municipal water reached Serra in the 1980s. Throughout the 1900s most of the area's inhabitants emigrated to other countries, particularly to the United States. One of the greatest concentrations of Serra do Bouro descendants is in the area of Perth Amboy, New Jersey (sister city to Caldas da Rainha). Serra has a cemetery called the \"Cemit\u00e9rio dos Ingleses\" (English Cemetery) where remains of two children and 6 women are buried from the October 28, 1892 shipwreck of the S.S. Roumania, an English ship. ==References== Category:Parishes of Caldas da Rainha ",
