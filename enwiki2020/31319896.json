    "text": "The Sam White Bridge is a reinforced concrete and steel overpass beam bridge which crosses Interstate 15 in American Fork, Utah. The original bridge was named for Sam White, a former homesteader in the nearby city of Pleasant Grove. It had only underpass clearance. The new bridge has an underpass clearance of , which exceeds the minimum standard for interstate bridges in the United States. The new 354-foot, 3.82-million-pound (1.73-million-kg, 1910-short-ton, 1733-tonne) bridge was built on the side of the interstate\u2014 from its final location\u2014in order to reduce traffic impact. It was then moved into place over a five-hour period using self-propelled modular transporters, finishing the process three hours ahead of schedule. It is the longest two- span bridge to be moved in the Western Hemisphere, and the second longest in the world to be moved. The Utah Department of Transportation, state and federal transportation and construction officials from around the United States, as well as some from other countries, were present to view it being moved into place. An area of a nearby business park was set aside for the public to watch the bridge being moved into place. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Beam bridges Category:Bridges completed in 2011 Category:Bridges on the Interstate Highway System Category:Interstate 15 Category:Road bridges in Utah Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Transportation in Utah County, Utah Category:Buildings and structures in Utah County, Utah Category:2011 establishments in Utah ",
