    "text": "Parmotrema adspersum is a species of lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. It was originally described as a species of Parmelia by Edvard August Vainio in 1907. John Elix transferred it to Parmotrema in 2002, reasoning that its thick- walled ascospores (measuring 16\u201318 by 6\u20138 \u03bcm) are typical of that genus. Parmotrema adspersum is common in Thailand and the Philippines. ==See also== *List of Parmotrema species ==References== Category:Fungi described in 1907 Category:Fungi of Asia adspersum ",
