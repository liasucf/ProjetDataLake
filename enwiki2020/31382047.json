    "text": "Burnout Crash! (branded Burnout CRASH!) is a downloadable action racing video game in the Burnout series. It is developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, iOS via PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iTunes App Store. In Burnout Crash!, players drive into an intersection and attempt to cause as big a pile-up as possible. Unlike previous games in the series, Burnout Crash! is played from a bird's-eye or aerial view. Points are earned for causing damage and destroying the environment and other vehicles. Leaderboards powered by EA's Autolog service enable players to compare scores with other players. The game features three game modes and six different intersections to play, as well as seven drivable vehicles, for example the Vegas Saloon. The Xbox 360 version of the game also includes a Kinect mode, allowing players to use gestures to control the game. To date, Burnout Crash! was the last title in the series before much of Criterion's staff transitioned over to working on the Need for Speed series, while the remaining staff provide additional work on non-racing game titles. ==Reception== The iOS version received \"favorable\" reviews, while the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 video games Category:Burnout games Category:Criterion games Category:IOS games Category:Kinect games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ",
