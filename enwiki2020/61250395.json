They currently play in the Gwent County League Premier Division. ==History== There has been many clubs in Blaenavon dating back to the 1900s. Most of these clubs had been church sides, and not one of the sides made an impact on a senior level. Clubs that represented the town included Blaenavon Thursday\u2019s, Clapham United from Forge side, The Corinthians, and Garn\u2013y-erw. There is also evidence of a Blaenavon side competing in the Usk & District league in 1936 to 1939. Following the end of the Second World War, Blaenavon man Ernest Pugh founded Blaenavon Blues AFC in the summer of 1946. During the early years the club played in the local leagues. The 1960s saw an upturn in the club's achievements and in 1960 the club won a treble of cups, The Langdon, Benevolent and Peake Cups. Back to back Championship wins in 1960-61 and 1961-62 along with two more Langdon Cup wins and two Benevolent Cup wins saw the club dominate the Pontypool league.https://www.pitchero.com/clubs/blaenavonbluesafc/a/club- history-22121.html The club again won the league in 1966-67. The club applied for admittance into the Gwent Senior and Welsh Football Leagues and were accepted, with the 1968-69 season seeing the Blues playing senior football for the first time in their history. In 1972 former Busby babe Ken Morgans managed the team for a season. The following year saw the club finish third, and in 1974-75 the club finished as champions of the tier 3 Welsh Football League Division Two. The club spent the next three years in the second tier before being relegated. The club continued to play in the Welsh league until the end of the 1990\u201391 season when a decision was made to leave the league given the pending Welsh pyramid re-organisation. About resignation from the league, the club dropped into the Gwent County League. ==Honours== *Welsh Football League Division Two (Tier 3 of the Welsh Football League) - Champions (1): 1974\u201375 *Gwent Central League Division One - Champions (5): 1960-61, 1961\u201362, 1966\u201367, 1992\u201393, 1996\u201397 *Gwent Central League Division One - Runners-Up (2): 1965-66, 2007\u201308 *Gwent Central League Division Two - Champions: (1): 1989\u201390 *Gwent Central League Division Two - Runners-Up (2): 2002-03 *Gwent County League Division 1 - Runners-Up (1): 2005-06 *Gwent County League Division 2 - Runners-Up (1): 2003-04 *Gwent County League Division 3 - Runners-Up (1): 2002-03 *Gwent Senior League Division 2 - Champions (1): 1977-78 *Pontypool League - Champions (3): 1960\u201361; 1961\u201362, 1966\u201367 *The Langdon Cup - Winners (4): 1959\u201360, 1960\u201361; 1961\u201362, 2004\u201305 *The Langdon Cup - Runners-Up (1): 1953\u201354 *Benevolent Cup - Winners (6): 1959\u201360, 1960\u201361; 1962\u201363, 1995\u201396; 2002\u201303; 2003\u201304 *Benevolent Cup - Runners-Up (2): 1964\u201365; 1966\u201367 *E.I.Peake Cup - Winners (1): 1959\u201360 *Open Cup - Winners (2): 1992\u201393; 2005\u201306 *Open Cup - Runners-Up (1): 2007\u201308 *Super Cup - Winners (1): 2005\u201306 ==Welsh Football League history== Information in this section is sourced from the Football Club History Databasehttp://www.fchd.info/BLAENAVB.HTM and the Welsh Soccer Archive.https://www.welshsoccerarchive.co.uk/index.php/welsh-leagues/welsh- league {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !
