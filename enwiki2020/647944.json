Along with Christopher Reid, he is the best-known exponent of Martian poetry, a movement that expresses alienation with the world, society and objects.British Council: Biography \u2013 \"It is worth recalling how The Onion, Memory (1978) and A Martian Sends a Postcard Home (1979), Raine\u2019s first two poetry collections, made such a spectacular impact on the then becalmed world of British poetry, seeming to set off a stylistic revolution of visual similes, wordplay and punning \u2013 even if in the long run it turned out to be a fashion. 'The Martian School', so-called by his friend James Fenton and inaugurated with another, Christopher Reid, had a widespread effect on readers and young poets alike, spawning a host of imitators.\" He was a fellow of New College, Oxford from 1991 to 2010 and is now emeritus professor.
