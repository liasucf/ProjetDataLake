    "text": "The WWE SmackDown Women's Championship is a women's professional wrestling world championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE, defended on their SmackDown brand division. It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the WWE Raw Women's Championship on Raw and the NXT Women's Championship on NXT. The current champion is Bayley, who is in her second reign and longest reign. The title was unveiled on the August 23, 2016, episode of SmackDown Live as the counterpart title to the then-WWE Women's Championship, which became exclusive to Raw as a result of the 2016 WWE Draft. That title was subsequently renamed after the crowning of the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch. In 2019, the NXT Women's Championship became the third main title for WWE's women's division. The SmackDown Women's Championship has been contested in the headlining match of two WWE pay-per-view events: TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in 2018 and, along with the Raw Women's Championship, WWE's flagship event WrestleMania in 2019. It was also the first women's championship to be defended in Saudi Arabia at Super ShowDown in 2020. == History == The inaugural and three-time SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch, shown here after winning her third title along with the Raw Women's Championship (right) at WrestleMania 35 Following the reintroduction of the WWE brand split and subsequent draft on July 19, 2016, then-WWE Women's Champion Charlotte was drafted to Raw, leaving SmackDown without a women's championship. Immediately following SummerSlam on the August 23, 2016, episode of SmackDown, SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon and general manager Daniel Bryan unveiled the SmackDown Women's Championship (Raw's title was subsequently renamed). A six- pack elimination challenge was then scheduled for Backlash on September 11, 2016, to determine the inaugural champion. The six women who competed at SummerSlam in the six-woman tag team match were chosen for the six-pack challenge: Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Carmella, Naomi, Natalya, and Nikki Bella. Lynch became the inaugural champion when she last eliminated Carmella. The NXT Women's Championship would become WWE's third main women's title when the NXT brand, formerly the promotion's developmental territory, became WWE's third major brand in September 2019 when it was moved to the USA Network. The championship belt design is physically identical to the Raw Women's Championship with the only difference being that the background of the center plate and the default side plates' globes are blue (as opposed to red) to symbolize its exclusivity to SmackDown. In what has become a prominent feature of the majority of WWE's championship belts, the side plates can be customized with the champion's logo. During Naomi's second reign, strips of multi interchanging colored LED lights were placed around the outline of the WWE logo and the outline of the belt to go with her \"glow\" gimmick. The title headlined a pay-per-view event for the first time at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in December 2018, where Becky Lynch defended it in a triple threat Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match against Charlotte Flair and Asuka, which Asuka won; this was also the first women's TLC triple threat match. The title was then on the line in a winner takes all triple threat match in the main event of WrestleMania 35 in April 2019, where Flair defended the title against Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey and Lynch, who won the match. This was the first women's match to main event a WrestleMania \u2013 WWE's flagship event. At Super ShowDown in February 2020, the title became the first women's championship to be defended in Saudi Arabia, where Bayley retained the title over Naomi; this was only the second women's match contested in the country. === Inaugural championship match === {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Eliminated !Wrestler !Eliminated by !Method of elimination !Time |- | |Alexa Bliss |Naomi |Pinfall |9:38 |- | |Naomi |Natalya |Submission |10:52 |- | |Natalya |Nikki Bella |Pinfall |12:50 |- | |Nikki Bella |Carmella |Pinfall |12:58 |- | |Carmella |Becky Lynch |Submission |rowspan=\"2\"|14:40 |- | |colspan=\"3\"|Becky Lynch |- |} == Reigns == As of , , there have been 17 reigns between 8 champions and 1 vacancy.
