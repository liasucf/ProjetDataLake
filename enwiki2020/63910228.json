    "text": "\"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\" is a 2010 YouTube video, noted for being the oldest video available for viewing on the PewDiePie channel. The video was uploaded by Felix Kjellberg, the owner of the channel, on 2 October 2010. Also featuring Xebaz, a friend of Kjellberg's, the video shows the two playing Minecraft, a sandbox video game. \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\" has been viewed more than 15 million times ==Background and release== Felix Kjellberg (pictured in 2019) released the video in 2010. Kjellberg registered his current YouTube account on 29 April 2010, after forgetting the password to his old YouTube account.This account would briefly serve as a 2nd channel from 2012 before it was later abandoned during 2014. His first YouTube upload was a different Minecraft video, which he deleted and no longer has access to. Nonetheless, \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\" has been cited as Kjellberg's first video by various outlets. Kjellberg described his commentary at the time as 'shy', and stated \"it was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone. That was unheard of back at the time. No one really did it.\" Released on 2 October 2010, the video is Kjellberg's oldest available for public viewing. The video was released while Minecraft was still in its alpha stage of development. The video's description reads: \"My friend was going to show me something inside the building, somehow a zombie had spawn waiting for us in his minecart.\" Indeed, the video featured \"what sounded like a young man laughing heartily at an unlucky zombie that had gotten stuck in a tree.\" The video featured mainly Swedish off-screen commentary from Kjellberg and Xebaz, although there is occasional swearing in English. This is in contrast to the English he has primarily employed in his later videos. ==Reception and legacy== \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\" has been viewed over 14 million times as of May 2020. The video itself has been cited as one that turned Kjellberg \"into [a] huge YouTube star\" by Business Insider, as well as one of the \"10 most important videos in YouTube history\" by Observer. Despite Minecraft being particularly notable within the Let's Play community, which Kjellberg helped to popularize, he did not upload playthroughs of the game during early periods of the game's popularity. He stated in a video that \"it felt like people were playing it just because it was popular, and not because they were actually [having fun] doing it.\" However, in 2019, Kjellberg began to regularly upload Minecraft gameplays on his channel; Polygon wrote that he began to play the game, in part because, \"he feels that he is flexible enough to not have the game define his channel.\" The Verge cited one content strategist stating that Kjellberg was the top creator for the Minecraft keyword. ==See also== *PewDiePie videography ==References== == External links == * * Minecraft Multiplayer Fun on YouTube Category:2010 YouTube videos Category:Minecraft Category:PewDiePie ",
