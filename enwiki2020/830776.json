    "text": "In mathematics, a discrete valuation is an integer valuation on a field K; that is, a function : u:K\\to\\mathbb Z\\cup\\\\{\\infty\\\\} satisfying the conditions : u(x\\cdot y)= u(x)+ u(y) : u(x+y)\\geq\\min\\big\\\\{ u(x), u(y)\\big\\\\} : u(x)=\\infty\\iff x=0 for all x,y\\in K. Note that often the trivial valuation which takes on only the values 0,\\infty is explicitly excluded. A field with a non-trivial discrete valuation is called a discrete valuation field. ==Discrete valuation rings and valuations on fields== To every field K with discrete valuation u we can associate the subring ::\\mathcal{O}_K := \\left\\\\{ x \\in K \\mid u(x) \\geq 0 \\right\\\\} of K, which is a discrete valuation ring. Conversely, the valuation u: A \\rightarrow \\Z\\cup\\\\{\\infty\\\\} on a discrete valuation ring A can be extended in a unique way to a discrete valuation on the quotient field K=\\text{Quot}(A); the associated discrete valuation ring \\mathcal{O}_K is just A. ==Examples== * For a fixed prime p and for any element x \\in \\mathbb{Q} different from zero write x = p^j\\frac{a}{b} with j, a,b \\in \\Z such that p does not divide a,b. Then u(x) = j is a discrete valuation on \\Q, called the p-adic valuation. * Given a Riemann surface X, we can consider the field K=M(X) of meromorphic functions X\\to\\Complex\\cup\\\\{\\infin\\\\}. For a fixed point p\\in X, we define a discrete valuation on K as follows: u(f)=j if and only if j is the largest integer such that the function f(z)/(z-p)^j can be extended to a holomorphic function at p. This means: if u(f)=j>0 then f has a root of order j at the point p; if u(f)=j<0 then f has a pole of order -j at p. In a similar manner, one also defines a discrete valuation on the function field of an algebraic curve for every regular point p on the curve. More examples can be found in the article on discrete valuation rings. ==References== * Category:Commutative algebra Category:Field (mathematics) ",
