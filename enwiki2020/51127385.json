To prove her worth, she offers to eliminate his other contractors. In exchange for her efforts, she asks if he can find someone for her. Bill is standing on a deserted train platform, and is told by a limping janitor that no trains will be coming until 4:04 in the morning. The janitor suggests he wait in the 24 hour cafe. There, he converses with Annie, a waitress, who notices that he has a terminal disease, and is suicidal. She discusses various ways he can kill himself. Later, Illing, a hitman, is captured by Annie, who is posing as a prostitute. He awakes to find himself handcuffed to a bed before Annie incapacitates and kills him. Mr. Franklyn, the employer, calls his two hitmen and orders them to pick up a briefcase from the lockers at the terminal. They take it to the cafe, and find a pack of matches and an envelope of money. They wonder why Mr. Franklyn has called on them, and not Illing. The match pack is from a strip joint, where they find a dancer resembling the waitress Annie from earlier. She takes the envelope of money as payment for passing on information about the hit Mr. Franklyn wants them to do. She comes on strong to Alfred, but is dismissive of Vince. The hitmen are told to wait in an apartment, and to shoot a person in the window opposite when told. Vince is also secretly told via a phone call to then kill Alfred. The waitress tells Alfred that Vince will try to kill him, so Alfred should kill Vince once the hit is completed. Mr. Franklyn watches from his lair, with monitors displaying camera footage of the cafe and the hitmen's hideout. Back at the train terminal, the waitress takes Bill to an abandoned air shaft, and tries to talk him into committing suicide. Although he described throwing himself down a deep, dark hole as his final act, he cannot jump. The waitress teases him, and Bill tells the waitress that she is a \"naughty girl\". This triggers a memory from his days as a school teacher, where he had two girls in his class that he abused. The waitress reveals that she is one of those girls, and then she stabs Bill in the neck with his pen, and pushes him down the shaft. Meanwhile, Mr. Franklyn calls the hitmen's apartment, and says that they should be ready to take the shot. When Annie appears at the window across the apartment, Alfred pulls his gun on Vince. Annie comes over, and they shoot Vince. Alfred and Annie leave the apartment and run into the janitor, who is arriving to clean up the murder scene. Back in the terminal, the waitress turns on Alfred, tells him that she is not infatuated with him, and shoots him dead. The janitor comes along to clean up the body. The waitress decides to help the janitor take the bodies to the top of the air shaft and drop them both into it. The janitor returns to the terminal, and enters the janitor closet, which is actually Mr. Franklyn's control centre. He is revealed to be Mr. Franklyn in disguise, removing his prosthetic bad teeth and fake latex skin. He stops limping and walks normally. There are dozens of attach\u00e9 cases lined up for future jobs. As he leaves his \"closet\", he is accosted by the waitress and her doppelg\u00e4nger, revealed to be a set of twins, Annie and Bonnie. The twins tie up Mr. Franklyn and describe how their mother died. She was being pursued by her partner, revealed to be Mr. Franklyn, after she witnessed him murder someone and ran back to her flat to protect her twin girls. Mr. Franklyn poured gasoline in her home, and set it on fire. The mother had time to push the girls out a broken window, but could not save herself. After that, the twins spent the rest of their childhood in an orphanage being molested by Bill. The twins tell Mr. Franklyn that he is their biological father and they are ready to exact their revenge. They lobotomise him, finally kill him, then walk out of the terminal together. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== On 12 February 2016, it was announced that Margot Robbie would headline and produce a \"noir thriller\" written and directed by Vaughn Stein, through her production company LuckyChap Entertainment.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 66 reviews, and an average rating of 4.26/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Worth seeking out for only the most hardcore of Margot Robbie completists, Terminal lives down to the medical definition of its title in dreadfully derivative fashion.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Rolling Stones Peter Travers panned the film, awarding zero stars, stating, \"The title of this wretched Tarantino-meets- Blade Runner noir rip-off doubles as a diagnosis\". Rex Reed of the New York Observer also awarded zero stars, calling the film \"a turgid, pretentious, and incomprehensible existential joke.\" David Edelstein of Vulture gave a negative review, criticising the plot's focus, saying, \"since the film doesn't establish a baseline of reality, it's hard to pick out a premise.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a D, writing, \"Vaughn Stein's Terminal takes a mess of dead tropes and Frankensteins them together into a crime saga that's in desperate need of brains. And a soul. And a story.\" Jacob Knight of Birth.Movies.Death. heavily criticised Stein's direction and wrote, \"no amount of pretty pictures could save a script this abysmally written. Stein has penned scene after scene after scene of nasty people talking circles around one another, no character defined by anything beyond their comic book-ready aesthetic.\" Jeffrey M. Anderson of The San Francisco Examiner awarded the film two and a half stars out of four, describing the film as \"mediocre\", though praising Robbie's performance, writing, \"Robbie is a bright one, and even though Terminal isn't much, it offers a chance to watch her shine.\" Clint Worthington of Consequence of Sound heavily criticised Stein's direction, calling the film a \"waste of time\" and \"An entirely empty exercise in dated, exhausting hyper-stylized filmmaking.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film, awarding three out of four stars, writing, \"The final 15 minutes or so of Terminal are flat-out nutso. One can imagine Robbie, Myers et al., breaking into laughter after hearing \"Cut!\" \u2014 not out of disrespect for the material, but out of sheer giddiness for having the opportunity to try something so audacious. Even when it doesn't work, Terminal is a film with never a dull moment.\" Kenneth Seward Jr. of IGN gave a mostly positive review, scoring the film a 7.5 out of 10, indicating it is \"Good\", stating, \"Terminal is an interesting revenge story that mostly works. There are a few missteps, namely a few wasted characters and a straight forward plot made needlessly complicated. Still, Vaughn Stein should be pleased with what's here.\" Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune gave a highly positive review, awarding three and a half out of four stars, praising the film's visual style, noting, \"Every moment of Terminal engages the eye, and \u2014 unexpectedly \u2014 the mind. Even the makeup is arresting \u2014 the arterial red of Annie's lipstick is hypnotic.\" James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave a mixed review, awarding the film two and a half stars out of four, writing, \"At its best, Terminal is a tasty, tangy parfait \u2013 a kaleidoscope of neon-tinged visuals and a twisty storyline with a tortured timeline.\" However, he criticised the film's ending as \"generic\" and \"anticlimactic\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave a mostly negative review criticising Stein's direction, writing, \"An airless debut that says much about its writer-director's cultural diet and little about anything else in the world, Vaughn Stein's Terminal blends tropes from several sorts of crime flicks into a soundstagey affair that's more brittle than hard-boiled.\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times also gave a negative review, calling the film \"a flashy, hyperstylized bore.\" Shaun Munro of Flickering Myth gave a mostly positive review, stating, \"It's messy and navel-gazingly ostentatious, but fitfully entertaining thanks largely to a scene-stealing, against-type performance from Simon Pegg.\" == References == == External links == * * * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 crime thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American films about revenge Category:American neo-noir films Category:British crime thriller films Category:British films Category:British films about revenge Category:British neo-noir films Category:Films about contract killing Category:Films about twin sisters Category:Films produced by David Barron Category:Films produced by Margot Robbie Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Hong Kong crime thriller films Category:Hong Kong films Category:Hong Kong films about revenge Category:Hong Kong neo-noir films Category:Hungarian crime thriller films Category:Hungarian films Category:Irish crime thriller films Category:Irish films Category:LuckyChap Entertainment films Category:Patricide in fiction ",
