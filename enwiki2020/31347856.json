Luis organizes the group and appoints himself leader. They find fresh water and gather coconuts. They then tried to build a shelter and tried to start a fire to keep warm and alert passing ships of their whereabouts, but Andy wants to stay on this island forever, because he is more interested in playing Indians and hunting wild game, and it soon becomes evident that he is unhappy with Luis's leadership. Andy challenges Luis to a proper vote, resulting in a division amongst the group, half in favor of Andy and half in favor of Luis. What follows is a rapid decline into all out war between the two groups. ==Cast== *Roderick Paulate as Andy *Eddie Villamayor as Luis *Toto Jr. as Nilo *Margie Braza as Clarita *Jingle as Glenda *Angelito as Ricky *Efren Montes as Brooks *Zernan Manahan as Lando *Rinna Peredo as Velvy *Michael Sandico as Angelo *Ricky Sandico as Biko ==Differences between the book and the film== *The film depicts boys and girls stranded on the island together, while in the book there were only boys. *In the book, the children elect a leader shortly after being stranded on the island; in the film, the election does not take place until they have already been on the island for several weeks. ==Location== The movie was set on location at Lipata, Padre Burgos, Quezon. == Awards and nominations == {|| width=\"90%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! width=\"10%\"| Award-Giving Body !! width=\"25%\"| Category !! width=\"25%\"| Recipient !! width=\"10%\"| Result |- | rowspan=4| 1st Gawad Urian Awards |- | Best Music (Pinakamahusay na Musika)||Lutgardo Labad|| |- | Best Editing (Pinakamahusay na Editing) || Ben Barcelon|| |- | Best Sound (Pinakamahusay na Tunog) || Willie de Santos|| |} ==References== ==External links== Category:1976 films Category:Filipino-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Philippine films ",
