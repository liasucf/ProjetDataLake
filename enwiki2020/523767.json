    "text": "The Oise ( ; ) is a river of Belgium and France, flowing for from its source in the Belgian province of Hainaut, south of Chimay. It crosses the border with France after about . It flows into the Seine at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a north-western suburb of Paris. Its main tributary is the Aisne. It gave its name to the French departments of Oise and Val-d'Oise. ==Places along the river== In France, the Oise flows through the following d\u00e9partements and towns: *Aisne: Hirson, Guise, Chauny *Oise (named after the river): Noyon, Compi\u00e8gne, Creil *Val-d'Oise (named after the river): Auvers-sur-Oise, Pontoise, Cergy, Jouy-le-Moutier *Yvelines: Conflans-Sainte-Honorine ==Navigation== Over the past few centuries, the Oise has played an important role as an inland shipping waterway connecting the Seine (and thus Paris) with the coastal regions of northern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. With the projected construction of the Seine-Nord Europe Canal, a high-capacity water transport system currently in development, the Oise will be linked at Janville, north of Compi\u00e8gne, with the high-capacity Canal Dunkerque-Escaut, east of Arleux. The Seine-Nord Europe Canal will replace the old Canal de Saint-Quentin and the current Canal du Nord, the capacity of which is far below standard. When the new Seine-Nord connection is complete, it will allow large vessels to transport goods from the Seine, and thus Paris and its surrounding area, to the ports of Dunkirk, Antwerp and Rotterdam. Part of the overall project consists in upgrading the river Oise itself between Creil and Compi\u00e8gne, a project called MAGEO (Mise au gabarit europ\u00e9en de l'Oise) that was put out to public consultation in 2013. Some bends need to be eased and bridges raised to meet the requirements of a class Vb inland waterway. ==Tributaries== The river at Hirson Tributaries include ===Right bank=== * Noirieu * Divette * Mas or Matz * Aronde * Br\u00e8che * Th\u00e9rain ===Left bank=== * Gland * Thon * Serre * Ailette * Ru de Servais * Aisne * Automne * Nonette * Th\u00e8ve ==See also== * Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Oise * List of rivers of France * List of canals in France ==References== ==External links== * River Oise and Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Oise maps and information, on places, ports and moorings on the canal, by the author of Inland Waterways of France, Imray * Navigation details for 80 French rivers and canals (French waterways website section) Category:International rivers of Europe Category:Rivers of Belgium Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Aisne Category:Rivers of Oise Category:Rivers of Val-d'Oise Category:Rivers of Yvelines Category:Rivers of Hauts-de-France Category:Rivers of \u00cele-de-France Category:Rivers of Hainaut (province) Category:Rivers of the Ardennes (Belgium) Category:Rivers of the Ardennes (France) Category:Chimay ",
