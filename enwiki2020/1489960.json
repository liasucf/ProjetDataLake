He has unique vision. His diction is close to daily life but does not lack of literariness. As he said: \u201c...I believe readers will make a conclusion like that after they read. The theme is our life; and at the same time, they will agree that there is no one has ever written our life in this way...As our life should not be like what I wrote, but actually, it is.\u201d ===Attitude=== Some people had commented Wang\u2019s works that though they were interesting, they lack of a positive theme and can not inspire us, etc. And Wang responded: \u201cThough the author is a modest person, he can not accept those opinions. Being positive is one of our norm, but it should not be always mentioned. I think my duty is writing interesting novels as possible as I can, and should not add some deliberate sermonize. My writing attitude is to write some works for those people who read novels, not to teach undereducated youth...\u201d ==External links== * WangXiaobo Net * works of wangxiaobo collection * * Article by the magazine Rue89 (In French) * Italian publication of the short novel 2015 (in Italian) * Introduction to the English translation published by the State University of New York Press ==References== Category:1952 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Writers from Beijing Category:Peking University faculty Category:Renmin University of China alumni Category:University of Pittsburgh alumni Category:People's Republic of China essayists Category:Educators from Beijing Category:20th-century novelists Category:20th-century essayists ",
