    "text": "Mojsije Suboti\u0107(c.1730-1789) was born in Syrmia County and was among the first Serbian painters to be academically-educated in art at Vienna. The complete prevalence of Western orientation in Serbian religious painting in the eighteenth century is seen on the iconostases of the less known painter Mojsije Suboti\u0107 (died 1789) in the village of Martinci and in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. George in the village of Veliki Bastaji (1785),both done in baroque and rococo styles. In the third tier on the iconostasis in Bastaji, a standing Mother of God with the widely spread arms and a dove on her breast is represented amongst the prophets. A dove is a symbol of the Holy Spirit and in the Austrian church, art represents a sort of the Annunciation. The most complete gallery of Serbian rulers and saints is depicted in the second tier. It is interesting to note that, instead of representations of the Mother of God and St. John the Baptist, there are the figures of Saint Sava and St. Simon, who are presenting Serbian rulers and saints to Christ. == References == Category:Icon painters ",
