The capacity reservoir was created by the construction of the Indian Valley Dam across the north fork of Cache Creek in 1975. The long and high earth-fill dam was built for water storage, irrigation and flood control. Although the reservoir is in Lake County, it was built by neighboring Yolo County, who own all water rights to the of water. The dam includes a hydroelectric plant. The cost of the dam and reservoir exceeded $9 million and were funded in part by two bond issues. ==Recreation area== The reservoir is in the Bureau of Land Management's Walker Ridge Recreation Area. All types of recreation are allowed, including boating, camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, bicycling and horseback riding. There are two primitive boat/hike-in campgrounds, Blue Oaks and Kowalski. The area's flora and fauna include manzanita, oak and pine trees, blacktail deer, black bear, and wild turkey. Rare plants such as the Indian Valley Brodiaea and Adobe lily grow here. Fluctuations in water level vary by year as seen at the boat ramp at the northern end of the lake. ==See also== *List of dams and reservoirs in California *List of lakes in California *List of lakes in Lake County, California *thumbList of largest reservoirs of California *List of power stations in California == References == ==External links== *1970 Video presentation by the Yolo County Water Resources Board proposing this Indian Valley project. * BLM webpage on Indian Valley area. *History essay on water rights, Lake County.
