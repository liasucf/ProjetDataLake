The club was named after its origins, the Caucasus Mountains, as Harari means \"Mountainous\" in the Hebrew language. The club's activity was ceased in 1929 due to outbreak of the 1929 Palestine riots, and lack of funds. The club was reformed in 1943 and played at the second tier league of the Palestine League in the 1943\u201344 and 1944\u201345 seasons.Liga Milhamtit Bet participants Davar, 22.10.1943, Historical Jewish Press Liga Bet South division Hamashkif, 24.12.1944, Historical Jewish Press However, the club was folded afterwards, due to financial problems. After the Israeli Declaration of Independence, the club was reformed again in 1959 as Hapoel Harari Yad Eliyahu and entered the league competitions at Liga Gimel. Harari withdrew from Hapoel association prior to the 1961\u201362 season and became independent club once more, returning to its original name.12 New teams registered for Liga Gimel so far (Page 3) Hadshot HaSport, 27.9.1961, archive.football.co.il At the end of that season, Harari beat Hapoel Dimona 6\u20131 in the promotion play-offs for Liga Gimel clubs and were promoted to Liga Bet. The club joined Beitar association, prior to the 1963\u201364 season, and was renamed Beitar Harari Tel Aviv. At the end of the season, Harari finished runners-up in Liga Bet South A division and promoted to Liga Alef, the second tier of Israeli football at the time. However, the club's spell in Liga Alef lasted only one season, as they finished bottom of the South division at the 1964\u201365 season, winning only two games, and relegated back to Liga Bet. In the following season, the club merged with Liga Gimel club, Beitar Bat Yam, and became known as Beitar Harari Bat Yam, which was the full name of the club until the end of the 1968\u201369 season, in which they were relegated to Liga Gimel. In the following season at Liga Gimel, Beitar Bat Yam continued as a separate entity, and the name of Harari was dropped.\"New page\" also in Liga Gimel (Page 7) Hadshot HaSport, 26.9.1969, archive.football.co.il ==References== *Within 41 years in 3 incarnations (Page 5) Hadshot HaSport, 12.6.1964, archive.football.co.il Category:Defunct football clubs in Israel Category:Association football clubs established in 1923 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1965 Category:Football clubs in Tel Aviv Category:1923 establishments in Mandatory Palestine Category:1965 disestablishments in Israel Tel Aviv ",
