    "text": "Dr. H. D. Lucas House was a historic home located at Black Creek, Wilson County, North Carolina. It consisted of two sections: a one-story Greek Revival style doctor's office built about 1850, and a late-19th century, Victorian cottage dated to the early l880s, which served as Dr. Lucas' residence. The cottage was a one-story, three-bay, single-pile frame dwelling with a steeply pitched gable roof. The house has been demolished. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Victorian architecture in North Carolina Category:Greek Revival houses in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Houses in Wilson County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wilson County, North Carolina ",
