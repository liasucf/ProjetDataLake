    "text": "The Practice is an American legal drama created by David E. Kelley centering on partners and associates at a Boston law firm. Running for eight seasons on ABC from March 4, 1997 to May 16, 2004, the show won the Emmy in 1998 and 1999 for Best Drama Series, and spawned the spin-off series Boston Legal, which ran for five more seasons, from 2004 to 2008. Conflict between legal ethics and personal morality was a recurring theme with light comedy being occasionally present. Kelley claimed that he conceived the show as something of a rebuttal to L.A. Law and its romanticized treatment of the American legal system and legal proceedings.https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-david-e- kelley-20161012-snap-htmlstory.html ==Overview== In Season 1, Robert Donnell and Associates features Bobby Donnell as the sole senior partner, Ellenor Frutt, Eugene Young, and Lindsay Dole as his associates, and Rebecca Washington as the firm's receptionist. Later, Jimmy Berluti is hired as an associate. In Season 2, Robert Donnell and Associates becomes Donnell, Young, Dole, and Frutt after Eugene, Lindsay, and Ellenor become partners. Assistant district attorney Helen Gamble becomes regularly entangled in the cases and personal lives of the employees of the firm. In Season 3, Rebecca Washington, who had been attending law school in secret, becomes an associate after passing the bar exam. Lucy Hatcher is then hired as the new receptionist. In Season 4, assistant district attorney Richard Bay, like Helen, becomes a frequent ally and opponent of Donnell, Young, Dole, and Frutt. In Season 5, Lucy becomes a rape crisis counselor in addition to her job as the firm's receptionist. Richard is later assassinated after refusing to throw a murder trial. In Season 6, assistant district attorney Alan Lowe becomes another antagonist against the firm for a short period of time. In Season 7, Lindsay leaves Donnell, Young, Dole, and Frutt to start a new law firm with Claire Wyatt. To fill in the void left by Lindsay, Jamie Stringer is hired as an associate. Bobby later leaves the firm. In Season 8, Donnell, Young, Dole and Frutt has been renamed to Young, Frutt, and Berluti. Eugene has taken Bobby's place as a senior partner, Lucy has left the firm to become a full-time rape crisis counselor, Rebecca has also left the firm for unknown reasons, and Helen is no longer present at the firm's cases. Tara Wilson is hired as a paralegal and Alan Shore becomes an associate. After firing Alan and Tara as well as being sued by the former, Young, Frutt, and Berluti dissolves.

As a result, Dylan McDermott, Kelli Williams, Lara Flynn Boyle, Chyler Leigh, Marla Sokoloff, and LisaGay Hamilton were fired as regulars with McDermott and Sokoloff reappearing as a special guest star and a recurring character respectively in the eighth season. The addition of James Spader and Rhona Mitra to the cast somewhat revived the ratings as Spader went on to win an Emmy for his appearance. However, on March 11, 2004, ABC announced that The Practice would not return for a ninth season; rather, Kelley would create a new spin-off series Boston Legal, starring Spader, Mitra, Lake Bell and William Shatner. ==Episodes== The Practice had 8 seasons and a total of 168 episodes. ===Crossovers=== * \"Axe Murderer\" (S02E26) \u2013 The lawyers of Robert Donnell and Associates work with the lawyers of Cage & Fish on a case in which a woman accused of killing a wealthy client who may have been Lizzie Borden in a past life\u2014a case that begins on Ally McBeal: \"The Inmates\" (S01E20). * \"The Day After\" (S05E14) \u2013 Ellenor Frutt and Jimmy Berlutti are hired to represent Coach Riley, who's been fired from Winslow High for withholding information about Milton Buttle's affair.
