    "text": "The Pat Metheny Group was an American jazz band founded in 1977. The core members of the group were guitarist, composer and bandleader Pat Metheny; and keyboardist and composer Lyle Mays, who was in the group at its inception. Other long-standing members included bassist and producer Steve Rodby, who joined in 1981, and member Antonio Sanchez, who had been the group's drummer since 2002. In addition to a core quartet, the group was often joined by a variety of other instrumentalists expanding the size to six or eight musicians. ==History== ===1970s=== Founder Pat Metheny first emerged on the jazz scene in the mid-1970s with a pair of solo albums. First was Bright Size Life, released in 1976, a trio album with bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius and drummer Bob Moses. The next album, released in 1977, was Watercolors, featuring Eberhard Weber on bass, pianist Lyle Mays, and drummer Danny Gottlieb. In 1977, bassist Mark Egan joined Metheny, Mays, and Gottlieb to form the Pat Metheny Group. ECM released the album Pat Metheny Group in 1978 with songs co-written by Metheny and Mays. Pat Metheny Group marked Mays' first use of the Oberheim synthesizer, which became an integral part of the Group's sound. The group's second album, American Garage in 1979 reached No. 1 on the jazz chart at Billboard magazine. ===1980s=== Left to right: Steve Rodby and Pat Metheny The Pat Metheny Group released the album Offramp in 1982. Offramp marked the first recorded appearance of bassist Steve Rodby in the group (replacing Mark Egan), and also featured Brazilian \"guest artist\" Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos. Vasconcelos had appeared on the Pat Metheny/Lyle Mays album As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls in 1981, and his performance on percussion and wordless vocals marked the first addition of Latin-South American music shadings to the Group's sound. Offramp was also the group's first recording to win a Grammy Award, the first win of many for the group. In 1983, a live album titled Travels was released. It won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance in 1984. 1984 brought the release of First Circle, a popular album that featured compositions with mixed meters. With this album, the group had a new drummer, Paul Wertico (replacing Danny Gottlieb). Wertico and Steve Rodby having both played with the Simon & Bard Group. A soundtrack album The Falcon and the Snowman followed in 1985. It featured the song \"This Is Not America\", a writing and performing collaboration with David Bowie which reached #14 in the British Top 40 and #32 on the US Billboard Hot 100Whitburn, Joel. Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132008, 12 Edition () in early 1985. The South American influence would continue and intensify on First Circle with the addition of Argentine multi-instrumentalist Pedro Aznar. This period saw the commercial popularity of the band increase, especially thanks to the live recording Travels. First Circle would also be Metheny's last project with the ECM label; Metheny had been a key artist for ECM but left over conceptual disagreements with label founder Manfred Eicher. The next three Pat Metheny Group releases would be based around a further intensification of the Brazilian rhythms first heard in the early '80s. Additional South American musicians appear as guests, notably Brazilian percussion player Armando Mar\u00e7al. Still Life (Talking) in 1987, was the Group's first release on new label, Geffen Records, and featured several tracks which have long been popular with the group's followers, and which are still in their setlist. In particular, the album's first tune, \"Minuano (Six Eight)\", represents a good example of the Pat Metheny group compositional style from this period: the track starts with a haunting minor section from Mays, lifts off in a typical Methenian jubilant major melody, leading to a Maysian metric and harmonically-modulated interlude, creating suspense which is finally resolved in the Methenian major theme. Another popular highlight was \"Last Train Home\", a rhythmically relentless piece evoking the American Midwest. The 1989 release Letter from Home continued this approach, with the South American influence becoming even more prevalent in its bossa nova and samba rhythms. ===1990s=== Pat Metheny Group bassist Mark Egan Metheny then again concentrated on other solo and band projects, and four years went by before the release of the next record for the next Pat Metheny Group. This was a live set recorded in Europe entitled The Road to You in 1993, and it featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums alongside new tunes. By this stage, the group had integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its sound, including Mays' addition of midi-controlled synthesized sounds to acoustic piano solos, accomplished via a pedal control. Mays and Metheny refer to the following three Pat Metheny Group releases as the triptych: We Live Here in 1995, Quartet in 1996, and Imaginary Day in 1997. Moving away from the Latin style which had dominated the releases of the previous decade, these albums included hip-hop drum loops, free-form improvisation on acoustic instruments, and symphonic signatures, blues and sonata schemes. ===2000s=== After another hiatus, the Pat Metheny Group re-emerged in 2002 with the release Speaking of Now, marking another change in direction through the addition of younger musicians. Joining the core players (Metheny, Mays and Rodby), were drummer Antonio Sanchez from Mexico City, trumpeter Cuong Vu from Vietnam and bassist, vocalist, guitarist, and percussionist Richard Bona from Cameroon. Following the group's 2002 tour, Bona left to concentrate on his solo career, but appeared as one of two guest artists (the other being mallet cymbalist Dave Samuels) on the group's latest release, 2005's The Way Up, together with a new group member: Swiss-American harmonica player Gr\u00e9goire Maret. The Way Up is a large-scale concept record which consists of a single 68 minute-long piece (split into four sections only for CD navigation). Metheny has said that one of the inspirations for the labyrinthine piece was a reaction against a perceived trend for music requiring a short attention span and which lacks nuance and detail. Many of the textures in The Way Up are created from interlocking guitar lines -- Steve Reich is credited on the CD as an inspiration, along with Eberhard Weber, and there are large open sections for solo improvisation and group interplay. On the group's 2005 tour (when its lineup was supplemented by Brazilian multi-instrumentalist Nando Lauria), The Way Up was played in its entirety as the first half of the concert. The final performance of the piece was at a free show for more than a hundred thousand people at the close of the 2005 Montreal Jazz Festival. Their latest album, The Way Up was released through Nonesuch Records. It is planned that all of Metheny's Geffen and Warner Bros. Records albums are to be rereleased on the label. The Pat Metheny Group played at the Blue Note Tokyo in January 2009 in its core quartet of Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby and Antonio Sanchez. This quartet version of the group later toured the jazz festivals of Europe in the summer of 2010 as part of the \"Songbook Tour\". These concerts featured music from all eras of the group but no new material. In 2015, their song \"Last Train Home\" was featured in the 2012 adaptation of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, specifically the third part Stardust Crusaders as the second ending song. ==Members== ===Past members=== *Mark Egan \u2013 bass (1977\u20131980) *Danny Gottlieb \u2013 drums (1977\u20131982) *Lyle Mays \u2013 piano, synthesizers (1977\u20132010, died 2020) *Pat Metheny \u2013 acoustic and electric guitars, guitar synthesizers (1977\u20132010) *Steve Rodby \u2013 bass guitar, acoustic bass (1980\u20132010) *Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos \u2013 vocals, percussion (1980\u20131982, 1986, died 2016) *Pedro Aznar \u2013 vocals, percussion, melodica, guitars, saxophone, miscellaneous instruments (1983\u20131985, 1989\u20131991, 1992) *Paul Wertico \u2013 drums (1983\u20132001) *Armando Mar\u00e7al \u2013 percussion, vocals (1987\u20131996) *David Blamires \u2013 vocals, miscellaneous instruments (1986\u20131988, 1992, 1994-1997) *Mark Ledford \u2013 vocals, miscellaneous instruments (1987\u20131988, 1992, 1994-1998, died 2004) *Luis Conte - percussion (1994-1995) *Nando Lauria \u2013 guitar, vocals, percussion and miscellaneous instruments (1988, 2005) *Philip Hamilton \u2013 vocals, miscellaneous instruments (1997\u20131998) *Jeff Haynes \u2013 percussion (1997\u20131998), *Antonio S\u00e1nchez, \u2013 drums, percussion (2001\u20132010) *Richard Bona \u2013 percussion, vocals, electric bass, acoustic guitar, miscellaneous instruments (2002\u20132003) *Cuong Vu \u2013 trumpet, vocals, guitar, miscellaneous instruments (2001\u20132005) *Gr\u00e9goire Maret \u2013 harmonica, vocals, miscellaneous instruments (2003-2005) === Timeline === ImageSize = width:1000 height:450 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:100 top:10 right:10 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1977 till:01/01/2021 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 columnwidth:120 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1977 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1977 Colors = id:voc value:red legend:Vocals id:ww value:gray(0.5) legend:Wind_instruments id:g value:green legend:Guitars id:key value:purple legend:Keyboards id:b value:blue legend:Bass id:dr value:orange legend:Drums id:perc value:claret legend:Percussion id:alb value:black legend:Studio_releases LineData = at:01/02/1978 layer:back at:01/08/1979 at:01/01/1982 at:01/04/1984 at:07/07/1987 at:01/07/1989 at:01/07/1995 at:01/07/1996 at:07/10/1997 at:01/07/2002 at:01/07/2005 PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,\u20134) bar:Pat Metheny from:start till:end color:g bar:Nando Lauria from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2005 color:g bar:Nando Lauria from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2005 color:voc width:3 bar:Nana Vasconcelos from:01/07/1981 till:01/07/1982 color:voc bar:Nana Vasconcelos from:01/07/1981 till:01/07/1982 color:perc width:3 bar:Pedro Aznar from:01/07/1983 till:01/07/1985 color:voc bar:Pedro Aznar from:01/07/1983 till:01/07/1985 color:perc width:3 bar:Pedro Aznar from:01/07/1989 till:01/07/1992 color:voc bar:Pedro Aznar from:01/07/1989 till:01/07/1992 color:perc width:3 bar:Mark Ledford from:01/07/1986 till:01/07/1988 color:voc bar:Mark Ledford from:01/07/1986 till:01/07/1988 color:ww width:3 bar:Mark Ledford from:01/01/1995 till:01/07/1998 color:voc bar:Mark Ledford from:01/01/1995 till:01/07/1998 color:ww width:3 bar:David Blamires from:01/07/1986 till:01/07/1988 color:voc bar:David Blamires from:01/07/1986 till:01/07/1988 color:g width:3 bar:David Blamires from:01/01/1995 till:01/07/1997 color:voc bar:David Blamires from:01/01/1995 till:01/07/1997 color:g width:3 bar:Philip Hamilton from:01/07/1997 till:01/07/1998 color:voc bar:Cuong Vu from:01/01/2002 till:31/12/2005 color:ww bar:Cuong Vu from:01/01/2002 till:31/12/2005 color:voc width:3 bar:Gr\u00e9goire Maret from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2005 color:ww bar:Gr\u00e9goire Maret from:01/01/2005 till:31/12/2005 color:voc width:3 bar:Lyle Mays from:start till:10/02/2020 color:key bar:Mark Egan from:start till:01/07/1980 color:b bar:Steve Rodby from:01/07/1980 till:end color:b bar:Danny Gottlieb from:start till:01/01/1983 color:dr bar:Paul Wertico from:01/01/1983 till:01/01/2002 color:dr bar:Antonio Sanchez from:01/01/2002 till:end color:dr bar:Antonio Sanchez from:01/01/2002 till:end color:perc width:3 bar:Armando Mar\u00e7al from:01/01/1987 till:01/01/1997 color:perc bar:Jeff Haynes from:01/01/1997 till:01/07/1998 color:perc bar:Jeff Haynes from:01/01/1997 till:01/07/1998 color:voc width:3 bar:Richard Bona from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2006 color:perc bar:Richard Bona from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2006 color:voc width:3 ==Discography== === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
