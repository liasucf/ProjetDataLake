    "text": "The transfusion is a cocktail made from, e.g., equal parts vodka, grape juice, ginger ale or lemon-lime soda; a small amount of fresh lime juice, a lime wedge, and a fruit garnish (such as grapes) or crystallized ginger. Often it is served in a hurricane glass. ==Variations== Alternatively, it can be made with vodka, ginger syrup, lime juice, Concord grape juice ice cubes, and club soda. Alternatively, it can be made with vodka, grape juice, and Sprite or cranberry juice and ginger ale, and (importantly) a squeeze of a lime wedge. It can be garnished with other fruit as well, and fresh mint sprigs. The transfusion is a golf club standard, since grape juice is more of a staple at golf and country clubs than at restaurant bars. The transfusion mocktail is identical to the cocktail but does not contain any vodka. A transfusion with orange juice substituted for the Sprite or ginger ale is a Madras. You can also make a Madras with cranberry juice. ==References== Category:Cocktails with vodka Category:Cocktails with grape juice Category:Cocktails with cranberry juice Category:Cocktails with lemon-lime soda Category:Cocktails with ginger ale Category:Cocktails with lime juice Category:Fruity cocktails Category:Spicy cocktails Category:Citrus cocktails Category:Cocktails with orange juice ",
