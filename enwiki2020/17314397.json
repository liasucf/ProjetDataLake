    "text": "{| |} The IMPA Tu-Sa, (IMPA - Industrias Metal\u00fargicas y Plasticas Argentinas S.A.), named as Impa Tu-Sa-O in the Flight reference, was a civil trainer developed in Argentina in the 1940s for aeroclub use. It was a conventional, low-wing monoplane with wide-track fixed tailwheel undercarriage. In service, the aircraft demonstrated a number of serious and fundamental design flaws that led to a series of accidents and pilots joking that Tu-Sa stood for Todo Un Sarc\u00f3fago A\u00e9reo (\"Altogether an aerial coffin\"). When it became apparent that the defects could not be corrected without a complete redesign of the aircraft, they were withdrawn from use. ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * Category:1940s Argentine civil trainer aircraft Category:IMPA aircraft ",
