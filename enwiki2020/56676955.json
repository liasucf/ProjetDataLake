    "text": "is a song recorded by Japanese band Dreams Come True for their fifth studio album, The Swinging Star. It was released as the album's lead single by Epic/Sony Records on September 19, 1992. It served as the opening theme to the CX music show Ureshi Tanoshi Daisuki - Friday Night Live, on which the band were regular cast members. The single's coupling song, \"Taiy\u014d ga Miteru\" was used in the advertising campaign for Fujifilm's Fujicolor Super HG 400 film. ==Composition== The lyrics to \"Kessen wa Kiny\u014dbi\" were written by Miwa Yoshida and the song was composed and arranged by Masato Nakamura, while the track was co-produced by the band and Mike Pela. \"Kessen wa Kiny\u014dbi\" came about when Nakamura and Sing Like Talking frontman Chikuzen Sat\u014d decided to challenge themselves to a friendly competition to see who could write the best song using the chord progression to Cheryl Lynn's \"Got to Be Real\" as base inspiration. \"Kessen wa Kiny\u014dbi\" and \"Rise\" by Sing Like Talking, from their album Humanity (1992), were the resulting tracks. Additionally, Nakamura pulled inspiration from Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Let's Groove\" to make the perfect disco anthem. The song is written in the key of C minor with a common time tempo of 126 beats per minute. Yoshida's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5. ==Critical reception== CDJournal critics described the song as a \"fanfare\" that gets your \"adrenaline pumping\". It was praised for capturing the essence of Lynn's \"Got to Be Real\", on which the song is based. ==Cover versions== In 2003, Key of life and A.mia sampled \"Kessen wa Kiny\u014dbi\" on their song \"Friday Let Me Down\" featuring Soul'd Out's Diggy-Mo'. In 2012, Nico Touches the Walls recorded a cover of the song to be included as a B-side to the single \"Yume 1 Go\". In 2014, HY recorded a cover of the song for the Dreams Come True tribute album, Watashi no Dorikamu, released in celebration of the band's 25th anniversary. In 2017, Daichi Miura recorded his rendition of the song for the Dreams Come True cover album, DoriUta Vol. 1. ==Chart performance== \"Kessen wa Kiny\u014dbi\" debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, with 211,000 copies sold in its first week. The single stayed at the top of the chart for three consecutive weeks, selling 136,000 copies on its second charting week and 87,000 copies on its third week. It slid to number three the following week, logging sales of 88,000 units. The single spent an additional three weeks in the top ten.
