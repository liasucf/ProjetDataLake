Early awards were based on popular voting from readers of teenage pop music newspaper Go-Set and television program guide TV Week. They were followed by responses from viewers of Countdown, a TV pop music series (1974\u20131987) on national broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Some of the later award ceremonies incorporated listed nominees and peer-voted awards. From 1987 the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) instituted its own peer-voted ARIA Music Awards. ==1966\u20131972:Go-Set pop poll results== Teen-oriented pop music newspaper, Go-Set was established in February 1966 and conducted an annual poll during 1966 to 1972 of its readers to determine the most popular personalities. Readers were provided with coupons to vote for their choice, with initial categories of 'Male Vocal', 'Female Vocal' and 'Group' for both Australian and International acts \u2013 in later years new categories were introduced and old categories renamed or retired. ===1966=== Printed in Go-Set on 5 October 1966, pages 12 & 13. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:200px; height:200px\" border=\"1\" |+Australian acts: pop poll results |- !
