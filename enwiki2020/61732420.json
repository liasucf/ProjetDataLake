    "text": "Sittin' Here Thinkin', also released as Sad and Lonesome, is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker recorded in 1961 and released by the Muse label in 1979. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Tom Schulte stated: \"John Lee Hooker is a master of the primal, hypnotic Delta blues. Accompanied by nothing other than a bare beat of the drums (if not only the stomp of his own feet), \"The Healer\" can mesmerize. The simple, but effective, tools of his trade are one- chord songs and a ton of downbeat emotion\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"I Bought You a Brand New Home\" \u2013 3:27 # \"I Believe I'll Lose My Mind\" \u2013 3:46 # \"Teasin' Me\" \u2013 3:35 # \"My Cryin' Days Are Over\" \u2013 3:20 # \"Sittin' Here Thinkin'\" \u2013 3:21 # \"Mean Mistreatin'\" \u2013 4:10 # \"How Long?\" \u2013 3:20 # \"How Many More Years?\" \u2013 3:33 # \"C.C.
