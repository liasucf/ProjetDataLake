Set in 1985 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, it stars Molly Miles, Andrea Granera, and Alec Bandzes. The story chronicles the romantic relationship between 16-year-old Lily, and Mesa, a girl her age who she meets on the peninsula. ==Plot== Lily Peony is a precious sixteen year old girl who spends her summers on Cape Cod with her grandmother Anna. Throughout the previous years vacationing, the Peonys grew close with a Cape-native family: single-mother Velma and her teenage son John. During the summer of 1985, after being away from the peninsula for some time, Lily and John find themselves pursuing a mature and unexpected romance which has them both falling quickly for each other. That year, Lily also happens to meet Mesa - a teenage girl who is fascinating to Lily for her undeniable confidence and indescribable beauty. Mesa takes a clear interest in befriending Lily, intrigued by her quiet and mature nature. Through their shared time together, Lily realizes her feelings for Mesa are rather different from her feelings when she is with John. This provokes her internal struggle to identify herself, and feelings for Mesa, over her seemingly more traditional, yet less passionate, relationship with John. ==Cast== * Molly Miles as Lily Peony * Andrea Granera as Mesa * Alec Bandzes as John 'Johnny' Valentine * Patricia Ellis as Anna Peony * Kristin Stearns- Stewart as Velma Valentine * William Cummings as Noah == Production == With a budget $400, principal photography lasted six days, with locations on Cape Cod.
