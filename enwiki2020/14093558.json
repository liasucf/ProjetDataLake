The station is owned by American General Media and broadcasts a regional Mexican music format. ==History== KRQK was signed on December 18, 1979 at the 100.9 FM frequency by Sunshine Wireless of California, broadcasting a top 40 format. In 1985, Sunshine Wireless sold KRQK and its AM sister station KLLB (1410 AM) to Crystal Broadcasting Inc. for $1.75 million. In January 1989, then-rock formatted KRQK applied to the Federal Communications Commission to change frequencies to 100.3 FM; the request was granted the following year. On December 22, 1989, Crystal Broadcasting sold KRQK and its AM counterpart, then known as KTME, to Nova Broadcasting-Santa Maria, headed by Gregg Peterson, for $1.47 million. The station pair changed hands once again in May 1993, when Nova Broadcasting sold the combo to Padre Serra Communications for $450,000. The new owner then flipped KRQK to a regional Mexican format. In September 1999, Padre Serra sold KRQK to Bakersfield, California-based American General Media for $1.3 million. On January 18, 2010, at 11:30 a.m., high winds in the Santa Maria area triggered a power outage that knocked several stations off the air, including KRQK. The station resumed broadcasting one hour later under generator power. ==References== ==External links== * * RQK Category:Santa Barbara County, California RQK Category:1979 establishments in California Category:Radio stations established in 1979 ",
