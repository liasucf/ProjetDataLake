Upon graduating, students were normally commissioned to become teachers at military schools, but he insisted on being allowed to continue his studies in Paris. In 1880, his father finally agreed, and he spent eight years working in the studios of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. He had his first showing at the Exposition Universelle in 1889 and won a medal. As it turned out, when he went back to Turkey, he still became a teacher at a military school. In 1906, he was granted the title \"Pasha\". Two years later, however, at the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era, he chose to retire with the rank of Colonel and become a private art teacher.
