It is located near the border of France and Germany, and little of the castle remains because of geological events. == History == There were two Schauenburg castles near Frenkendorf, Alt (or Old)-Schauenburg about southwest of the village on the top of Chleifl\u00fceli hill and Neu (or New)-Schauenburg to the west. Alt-Schauenburg was probably built around 1275 as the seat of a junior branch of the Schauenburg family. The castle was occupied for less than a century. The 1356 Basel earthquake destroyed much of the castle and shortly thereafter the ruins were abandoned. The ruins were gradually buried, until 1949-50 when they were excavated and repaired. In 1976-77 additional construction helped preserve the site. ==Origin of the name== Neu-Schauenburg was built before Alt-Schauenburg, but because Alt-Schauenburg was destroyed and abandoned first, it came to be known as the old or alt- castle. ==Castle site== Many of the walls are still standing following the two conservation projects. The southern approach was guarded by a shield wall. One corner of the wall was protected by a semi-circular avant-corps. Inside the shield wall, the castle tower and residence hall were rectangular. ==See also== * List of castles in Switzerland == References == Category:Castles in Basel-Landschaft Category:Liestal Category:Ruined castles in Switzerland ",
