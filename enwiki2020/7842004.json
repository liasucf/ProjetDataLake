Around the same time, several subpoenas were issued to aides. The investigation looked at gifts, including several fur coats, as well as Dixon's spending habits. Two of Dixon's associates--campaign chair Dale Clark and Mildred Boyer, a businesswoman who had hired Dixon's sister--pleaded guilty in 2008 to tax charges and cooperated with prosecutors during the Dixon investigation.

She also will be required to donate $45,000 to the Bea Gaddy Foundation and to serve 500 hours of community service at Our Daily Bread.
