As the Victorias were the defending Stanley Cup holder, they would play two challenges, against Toronto and Montreal. ==Regular season== ===Highlights=== ===Final standing=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The first game was played under Ontario rules, the second under Manitoba rules. Unusually, in the first game a goal was scored by Rod Flett of Winnipeg, however this goal was into his own net. No Toronto player is credited for the goal, Mr. Flett is. Winnipeg would win the series 5\u20133, 5\u20133 (2\u20130). ===Winnipeg vs. Toronto Wellingtons=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120\" | Date ! width=\"140\" | Winning Team ! width=\"5\" | Score ! width=\"140\" | Losing Team ! width=\"145\" | Location |- |January 21, 1902||Winnipeg Victorias||5\u20133||Toronto Wellingtons||rowspan=\"2\"|Winnipeg Auditorium |- |January 23, 1902||Winnipeg Victorias||5\u20133||Toronto Wellingtons |- !colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Winnipeg wins best-of-three series 2 games to 0 |} {| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 |+ January 21 |- bgcolor=#cccccc ! width=150 | Toronto ! 3 ! width=30| at !width=150| Winnipeg ! 5 |- |H \"Dutchie\" Morrison || ||align=center| G ||Art Brown || || |- |George Chadwick || ||align=center| P ||Rod Flett || || |- |Irvin Ardagh || ||align=center| CP ||Magnus Flett || || |- |George McKay || 1 ||align=center| RO ||Burke Wood || 1 || |- |D. \"Worts\" Smart || 1 ||align=center| C ||Fred Chadham || 2 || |- |Charles \"Chummy\" Hill || ||align=center| LW ||Fred Scanlan || || |- |Frank McLaren || ||align=center| RW ||Tony Gingras || 2 || |- |} Flett scored for Toronto (own goal) {| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 |+ January 23 |- bgcolor=#cccccc ! width=150 | Toronto ! 3 ! width=30| at !width=150| Winnipeg ! 5 |- |H. \"Dutchie\" Morrison || ||align=center| G ||Art Brown || || |- |George Chadwick || ||align=center| P ||Rod Flett || || |- |Irvin Ardagh || ||align=center| CP ||Magnus Flett || || |- |George McKay || ||align=center| RO ||Burke Wood || || |- |D. \"Worts\" Smart || ||align=center| C || Fred Cadham || || |- |Charles \"Chummy\" Hill || ||align=center| LW ||Fred Scanlan || || |- |Frank McLaren || ||align=center| RW ||Tony Gingras || || |- |} Newspaper accounts omit the goal-scorers for the game. ===Winnipeg vs. Montreal=== After the Montreal HC won the 1902 CAHL title in March, they promptly sent a challenge to the Winnipeg Victorias and a best-of-three series was arranged. The season was mild, and there was an inch of water on the slushy ice for game one. Tony Gingras scored the only goal of game one and Winnipeg shut out Montreal, 1\u20130. Ice conditions improved for game two an Montreal shut out Winnipeg 5\u20130. In game three, Montreal took an early 2\u20130 lead after eleven minutes and then held on for a 2\u20131 victory. Winnipeg attacked furiously at the end, and Montreal's effort was described as \"little men of iron\" by Montreal Star sports editor Peter Spanjaardt. With the victory, the Montreal club won the Cup for the first time since 1894. Jack Marshall of Montreal, who had played for the Winnipeg team in the previous year, faced his old team and scored three goals, including the series clincher. Art Hooper also scored three for Montreal. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120\" | Date ! width=\"140\" | Winning Team ! width=\"5\" | Score ! width=\"140\" | Losing Team ! width=\"145\" | Location |- |March 13, 1902||Winnipeg Victorias||1\u20130||Montreal HC||rowspan=\"3\"|Winnipeg Auditorium |- |March 15, 1902||Montreal HC||5\u20130||Winnipeg Victorias |- |March 17, 1902||Montreal HC||2\u20131||Winnipeg Victorias |- !colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Montreal wins best-of-three series 2 games to 1 |} {| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 |+ March 13 |- bgcolor=#cccccc ! width=170 | Montreal ! 0 ! width=50| at !width=170| Winnipeg ! 1 |- |Billy Nicholson || ||align=center| G || Art Brown || || |- |Tom Hodge || ||align=center| P ||Rod Flett || || |- |Dickie Boon, Capt. || ||align=center| CP ||Magnus Flett || || |- |Art Hooper || ||align=center| RO || Fred Cadham || || |- |Jack Marshall || ||align=center| C ||Burke Wood || || |- |Charles Liffiton || ||align=center| LW ||Tony Gingras || 1 || |- |Jimmy Gardner || ||align=center| RW ||Fred Scanlon || || |- |Billy Bellinghan - Spare || ||align=center| ||Dan Bain - Spare - Capt. || || |- |Ronald Elliot - Spare || ||align=center| ||Charles Johnstone - Spare || || |- |George Smith - Spare || ||align=center| || || || |- |colspan=\"5| Referee- W.
