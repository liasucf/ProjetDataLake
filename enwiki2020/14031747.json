It is the group's third studio album and their fourth release in total.Mono Music, official homepage. http://www.monomusic.se/cd-benny-anderssons-orkester-bao-3.aspx ==Album information== Being a typical Benny Anderssons Orkester album, BAO 3 (the title indicates that it's the third BAO album) includes many different musical styles, ranging from Swedish folk music to pop, jazz, classical tunes and Viennese influences. The album is officially credited to \"Benny Anderssons Orkester, Helen Sj\u00f6holm & Tommy K\u00f6rberg\", indicating that it also includes several tracks with vocals. In fact, compared to its studio predecessor, BAO! in 2004, the number of vocals tracks has increased. Seven out of the 12 tracks on the album are sung by either Helen Sj\u00f6holm or Tommy K\u00f6rberg or as a duet. K\u00f6rberg can be heard on a BAO studio album for the first time, after already appearing together with the group during their tours and also lending vocals to two tracks on Benny Andersson's two solo albums from the 1980s, Klinga mina klockor and November 1989. As usual, most of the lyrics were written by Andersson's former ABBA partner Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, while all the music was composed by Andersson himself. BAO 3 was recorded in Sveriges Radios Studio 5 and Atlantis Studio, both in Stockholm, during 2007. Like all Benny Anderssons Orkester albums, it was engineered by Bernard L\u00f6hr und subsequently mixed by him and Andersson at Mono Music Studio. ===Success and promotion=== BAO 3 did not achieve the same success as the group's other two studio albums, which both topped the Swedish Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for 55 weeks. Nevertheless, BAO 3 entered the charts on November 1, reached the top 3 and also managed to collect a Gold disc during its 34-week chart run.Hitlistan, official Swedish charts. . Retrieved on 7 June 2011. BAO 3 is the first and to date also last album by the group to be released in autumn, namely October. All their other albums were released in late spring and early summer, in May, June or July. And because Benny Anderssons Orkester is also famous for its summer tours, the band and its music is strongly connected with that time of the year. So the album's inability to sell as well as Benny Anderssons Orkester and BAO! could be linked to this rather unusual release date. Due to Helen Sj\u00f6holm giving birth to her first child, Benny Anderssons Orkester did not tour in 2007. Instead, they performed two concerts in Stockholm and Gothenburg to promote the album. Contrary to their summer tours, the venues were not the usual small open-air stages, but rather big concert halls, like the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, where they played in front of 6,000 people. ===Songs and trivia=== Two big Svensktoppen hits were released from BAO 3. \"Fait Accomplit\", with lyrics by Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and vocals by Tommy K\u00f6rberg, entered the radio chart on December 1 and eventually topped the list for 11 weeks in early 2008. In the summer of the same year, the Helen Sj\u00f6holm and Tommy K\u00f6rberg duet \"Nu m\u00e5r jag mycket b\u00e4ttre\" became a top 5 hit on Svensktoppen. The lyrics for this song were written by Swedish poet and dramatist Kristina Lugn. By this time, Benny Anderssons Orkester's hit \"Du \u00e4r min man\" was still going strong on Svensktoppen, albeit already being four years old, and eventually outliving both tracks by far.Svensktoppen, Archiv. http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2023&artikel;=454888. Retrieved on 7 June 2011. *The album also includes a song with English lyrics, \"Crush On You\". This up-tempo pop number, performed in BAO style, is another Sj\u00f6holm and K\u00f6rberg duet. It is said that the song, or at least parts of it, was written back in 1979 during recording sessions for ABBA's Voulez-Vous album. However, a demo version from those sessions with vocals by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog or Anni-Frid Lyngstad does not exist.The Official International ABBA Fan Club, Magazine #93, December 2007. *\"F\u00f6r dig\" originally appeared on Benny Anderssons Orkester's live album BAO p\u00e5 turn\u00e9 in 2006. In 2009, an English- language version, titled \"The Stars\", was recorded for the group's compilation album Story Of A Heart. *\"Upp till dig\", performed by Helen Sj\u00f6holm, borrows some elements from a song called \"(I Am) The Seeker\", another old composition which dates back to the ABBA days. It was ultimately performed as part of the Abbacadabra musical in 1983 and subsequently released on single by B. A. Robertson. *The track \"Bonde s\u00f6ker fru\", with lyrics by Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and vocals by Tommy K\u00f6rberg, is a funny depiction of and parody about the famous Swedish reality TV program Bonde s\u00f6ker fru (farmer seeks wife). It is performed as a Charleston. *\"Helens brudvals\" was written for Helen Sj\u00f6holm's wedding in 2006. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== The following musicians appear on BAO 3:BAO 3 booklet *Benny Andersson: accordion, piano, synclavier, ukulele *G\u00f6ran Arnberg: keyboards *Janne Bengtsson: flute, piccola, barytonflute *P\u00e4r Grebacken: saxophone, clarinet, flute *Leif G\u00f6ras: violin, mandolin, solo-violin on \"Helens brudvals\" *(Nils-Erik) Nicke G\u00f6the: violin, mandolin *(Jan-Erik) Jogga Ernlund: contrabass, bass *Calle Jacobsson: tuba, trombone, bass trumpet *Tommy K\u00f6rberg: vocals *Leif Lindvall: trumpet, fl\u00fcgelhorn, cornet *Kalle Moraeus: violin, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, banjo, mandolin, bouzouki *Olle Moraeus: violin, viola, mandolin, solo-violin on \"Godnattvisa\" *(Pererik) Perra Moraeus: violin, circus-saxophone, mandolin *Lars Rudolfsson: accordion *Helen Sj\u00f6holm: vocals *J\u00f6rgen Stenberg: drums, percussion ==References== ==External links== * BAO 3 at the Swedish album chart Category:2007 albums Category:Benny Anderssons orkester albums ",
