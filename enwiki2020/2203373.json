Paid professionals, many of whom were YMCA leaders, were recruited to help start new Troops and spread the new Scouting program. They were sent out into the San Gabriel Valley towns to organize new troops and recruit leaders. By March 1919, there were nine active troops with 190 boys in the SGV. The Pasadena Council (also known as the Pasadena District Council) of the Boy Scouts of America was organized March 3, 1919, with jurisdiction over Pasadena, Altadena and Lamanda Park. A charter was granted by the BSA National Headquarters dated April 1, 1919 to the Pasadena District Council. Tallman Trask was hired to be the first Scout Executive. Trask had been a District Executive for the Los Angeles Council. He had also served as Los Angeles' camp director. Prior to joining the BSA, Trask was an executive for the YMCA and had run several camps for them. By October 1, 1919, there were 15 active troops with 299 Scouts. The council's name was changed in 1929 to Pasadena-San Gabriel Valley Council to better reflect the geographic area served by the council. In 1951 the name was changed to San Gabriel Valley Council to shorten it and better identify the 29 cities and towns that made it up. ==Organization== * Golden Eagle District ** City of Industry, Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Rowland Heights, West Covina, Valinda, Diamond Bar, Pomona and Walnut.Golden Eagle District Web siteGolden Eagle District history ** The cities of Diamond Bar, Pomona and Walnut were added to Golden Eagle District when Old Baldy Council was split at the Los Angeles\u2013San Bernardino county line on May 1, 2006, and was merged into the San Gabriel Valley Council and California Inland Empire Council. * Lucky Baldwin District ** Arcadia, Monrovia, Sierra Madre, Azusa, Bradbury, Duarte, Irwindale, and Temple City.Lucky Baldwin District Web site * Mission Amigos District ** Alhambra, Monterey Park, El Monte, San Gabriel, South San Gabriel and Rosemead. ** The city of Rosemead was part of the former El Camino Real District until 2007. * Rose Bowl District ** Altadena, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, Pasadena and San Marino. * Valle De Sol District ** Covina, Glendora, Charter Oak, La Verne, San Dimas and Claremont.Valle Del Sol District web site ** The cities of La Verne, San Dimas and Claremont were added to Valle De Sol District when Old Baldy Council was split at the Los Angeles\u2013San Bernardino county line on May 1, 2006 and was merged into San Gabriel Valley Council and California Inland Empire Council. * Former district called: Trails of the Valley District was moved into the Lucky Baldwin District and Mission Amigos District in 2010. ** Azusa, Baldwin Park, Bradbury, Duarte, Irwindale, El Monte and South El Monte. ** Formerly known as San Gabriel River District. ** The cities of El Monte and South El Monte were part of the former El Camino Real District until 2007. ==Camps== * Holt Scout Ranch (now closed) was an SGVC camp located in the San Bernardino Mountains.
