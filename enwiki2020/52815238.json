The district consists of Bay Village, Fairview Park, North Olmsted, Rocky River, Westlake as well as Olmsted Township in Cuyahoga County. ==Life and career== Greenspan is a graduate of Troy University, where he majored in business and accounting.

Prior to moving to Cuyahoga County, Greenspan resided in Sandy Springs, Georgia, where he sat on their inaugural city council. He also sat on the inaugural Cuyahoga County Council, where he was chairman of the finance committee. He was elected in 2010 and again in 2014. ==Ohio House of Representatives== Long-serving state representative Nan Baker was term-limited in 2016 after four terms, leaving a potentially competitive district open. With Greenspan representing exactly the same territory on the county council, he opted to seek to the Republican nomination for the seat. The race was deemed one of the most competitive of the cycle, with Democrat Tommy Greene raising considerable money and receiving numerous high-profile endorsements. However, in the end Greenspan kept the seat in the Republican column with a 56% to 44% win. ==References== ==External links== *Ohio State Representative Dave Greenspan official site Category:Living people Category:Troy University alumni Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Ohio Republicans Category:21st-century American politicians Category:1965 births ",
