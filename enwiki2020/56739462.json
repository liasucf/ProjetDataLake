It is based on Orbital ATK's Star-3 Bus, delivering 64 28 GHz fixed beams covering Africa and parts of Europe. There are also four independent steerable beams that can serve Africa, South America and Europe. The capacity will partially be used to allow Avanti to expand into new markets and provide growth for existing markets. ==Launch== The satellite was launched into geosynchronous orbit by Arianespace on an Ariane 5 rocket in its ECA variant from ELA-3 at Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The launch was originally planned in early 2017 but has been delayed to 21 March 2018, and then to 5 April 2018..
