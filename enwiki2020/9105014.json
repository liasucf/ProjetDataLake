The wine produced here was classified as one of fourteen Troisi\u00e8mes Crus Class\u00e9s (Third Growths) in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible, Workman Publishing, 2001, p.885, It is the northernmost classified growth in the M\u00e9doc. ==History== \"Calon\", meaning a little river skiff used in the Middle Ages to ferry timber across the Gironde estuary, gave the name to this district which was at one point known as Calones or Saint-Est\u00e8phe-de-Calon. In early times, Ch\u00e2teau Calon-S\u00e9gur was one of the original three vineyards in Saint-Est\u00e8phe and, in 1825, Ch\u00e2teau Montrose (in 1855 classified as a Second Growth) was a forest-land parcel belonging to the Calon-S\u00e9gur estate. By marriage, the estate came to be owned by Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de S\u00e9gur who also owned Chateau Latour and Chateau Lafite. Despite his ownership of these two First Growths, the Marquis said that \"I make wine at Lafitte and Latour but my heart is at Calon Segur.\" The wine's label today includes a drawing of a heart around the Chateau's name.H. Johnson & J. Robinson, The World Atlas of Wine, p.88, Mitchell Beazley Publishing, 2005, Kissack, Chris, thewinedoctor.com Chateau Calon-S\u00e9gur In the modern era, the estate has been owned by the Capbern Gasqueton family since 1894. After Mme Capbern- Gasqueton's death, it was sold in 2012 to Suravenir Assurances, an insurance company. == References == Category:Bordeaux wine producers ",
