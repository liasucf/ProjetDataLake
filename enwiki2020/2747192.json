Although he knew Bilbao since his childhood, he studied at Salamanca, where he graduated in Medicine in 1966, specializing in cardiology and radiology. After receiving his doctorate cum laude from the University of Salamanca, then he moved to France to work as an assistant in the Hospital abroad Broussais, of the University of Paris, between 1971 and 1972. There he met Anabella Dominguez, a Mexican student of French philology with whom he would later marry and have a son. Since 1973, he was professor of Physical Medicine and Radiology at the University of the Basque Country and worked in the Hospital of Las Cruces (Baracaldo, Vizcaya), first as a physician assistant and from 1976 as head of the Radiology Department. In 1981, he was appointed Director of the Hospital of Cruces. The following year he was appointed Director of hospitals of the Basque Government. From 1983 to 1987 he served as Director-general of Osakidetza-Servicio Basque Health. In July 1989 he was appointed Secretary general of the Presidency of the Basque Government, performing such work for two years, and assuming the post of Advisor in the Department of health of the Basque Government in 1991. He was also elected Mayor of Bilbao as the head of the list of the coalition between the PNV and Eusko Alkartasuna (EA), thanks to the votes of the Basque Country councilors; and later formed a Pact of Government with Basque citizen initiative, party led by the former Mayor of Bilbao Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gorordo, who had been expelled from the PNV.
