These sensors can be built at home, or bought from certain manufactures. Although there are various types of air pollution sensors, and some are specialized in certain aspects, the majority focuses on five components: ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide. The sensors were very expensive in the past, but with technological advancements these sensors are becoming more affordable and more widespread throughout the population. These sensors can help serve many purposes and help bring attention to environmental issues beyond the scope of the human eye. The EPA maintains a repository of air quality data through the Air Quality System (AQS), where it stores data from over 10,000 monitors in the United States. While use of these sensors was expensive in the past, the 2010s saw a recent trend towards the development of cheaper portable air- quality sensors that can be worn by individuals to monitor local air quality levels. These sensors, can then, in turn, help measure the spatiotemporal coverage and variety of chemical species, and empower individuals and communities to better understand their exposure environments and risks from air pollution. A research group led by William Griswold at UCSD handed out portable air pollution sensors to 16 commuters, and found \"urban valleys\" where buildings trapped pollution. The group also found that passengers in buses have higher exposures compared to those in automobiles. ==History== In December 1952, London\u2019s Great Smog led to the deaths of thousands of people. This event became one of the great turning points in our environmental history because it brought about a radical re-think in pollution control across the United Kingdom. This event further lead to the Clean Air Act, which may have had consequences even more far reaching than it originally intended. This act led to the change in fuel sources, and energy used by industries. Many citizens in major cities across the world suffered some type of health related problems due to excess toxins and pollution in the air. These catastrophic events lead to major cities controlling and measuring atmospheric pollutions. This revolution changed the way we see and understand the environment today. Technology was developed by governments to create air pollution sensors in order to measure the toxins in the environment. With further scientific research and advancements in technology, people are more concerned and conscious with the air the breath. Technology has made air pollution sensors more readily available and affordable for personal use. ==Health== Scientific evidence has indicated that indoor air pollution can be worse than outdoor pollutants in large and industrialized cities. Many products and chemicals used inside the home, for cooking and heating, and for appliances and home d\u00e9cor are primary sources of indoor air pollutants. Kim, S. & Paulos, E. (April 2010). inAir:Sharing indoor air quality measurements and visualizations. Earth, Wind, Flyer. 81-84. Everything we use in the home contributes to the pollution, and can possibly degrade the environment. Air pollution is responsible for 7 million premature deaths around the world each year. When pollutants enter the body through our respiratory system, they can be absorbed in the blood and travel throughout the body, and can directly damage the heart and other vital organs. Health Canada\u2019s research confirms that poor air quality is hazardous to human health and as the population ages more Canadians are at risk. Young children are at risk because on a per-body- weight basis, they tend to inhale relatively more air than adults, and their immature defence systems make them more susceptible to air pollution. The elderly are also at risk due to their weaker lungs, heart, and defence systems. The elderly also tend to have undiagnosed respiratory or cardiovascular health conditions. People participating in strenuous work or sporting activities outdoors breathe more deeply and rapidly than their sedentary counterparts. This increases the risk of these individuals developing air pollution related diseases. Due to its aging and expanding population, the number of Canadians affected grows each year. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Canadians die prematurely each year due to acute air pollution and that high summer temperatures lead to increased illnesses, hospitalization and deaths among older adults. ==References== Category:Air pollution Category:Measuring instruments ",
