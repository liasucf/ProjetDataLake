Her American ancestry went back to an Irish settler of Virginia and a French pioneer of Louisiana. Her great-grandfather, Robert Cunningham, of Virginia, was a soldier of the war for Independence, after which he removed to Tennessee, thence to Alabama, and thence to Illinois, when still a Territory, and there manumitted his slaves. Her father, Captain John M. Cunningham of Marion, Illinois, had been engaged in both the Black Hawk and Mexican-American wars. He was twice elected sheriff and county clerk of Williamson County, Illinois, U. S. marshal of the southern district of Illinois, and President Franklin Pierce appointed him register of the land office at Shawneetown, Illinois. He was also a member of the Legislature of Illinois in 1845 and 1846. Her mother was Miss Elizabeth Fontaine, of a distinguished family of that name which had arrived in Louisiana during the French occupancy of that country and had thence journeyed up the Mississippi River and settled in Missouri. It was here that John Cunningham met Elizabeth Fontaine and they married. When Mary was one year old, her parents removed to Illinois and settled at Marion, her father's home town. By the time she was nine years old, she encountered the dangers of a frontier home, when her father went forth to fight in the Mexican\u2013American War, and braved the miner's life in the Sierra Nevada of California. Mary relieved her mother, who was not strong, of most of the household work, while attending the primitive school of the neighborhood, and trained herself in needlework. In 1853, she was sent to the Convent of St. Vincent, near Morganfield, Kentucky, a branch of the Nazareth Institute, the oldest institution of the kind in the US. This was the nearest educational establishment of sufficient advancement in the higher branches of education. During the time that her father was a captain of volunteers in the Mexican War, John A. Logan was in the same regiment. He and the captain became warm friends, and their friendship continued through life. Mary was the oldest of thirteen children, and the large family, with the modest circumstances of her father, compelled her to start working after her graduation from St. Vincent's in 1855. The instruction she received at Saint Vincent's aided her in the preparation of important papers which were needed by her father, the Captain, for example, acting as his clerk during his tenure as land register during President Pierce's administration. ==Marriage and career== Mary Simmerson Cunningham Logan She met and formed an attachment with John A.

Mrs. Logan immediately identified her interests with those of her husband and in many ways she contributed to his many successes in the political world. She accompanied him on all his professional journeys, an undertaking in those days of wildernesses and no roads, often requiring great endurance and privation. A son, John Cunningham Logan, was born in 1856 but died the following year.

When the army entered upon the Tennessee River campaign, Mrs. Logan again returned to her home, but was soon shocked by the news from Donelson that her husband had fallen at the head of his charging columns, dangerously wounded. She hastened to the scene to care for her husband, a struggle between life and death. At Memphis, in the winter of 1862-3, Mrs. Logan again joined her husband, now a general, and remained there until he led his troops in the campaign which ended in the surrender of Vicksburg.
