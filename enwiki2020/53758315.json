The castle is located in the centre of town beside the brewery. ==History== The first reliable document suggests the castle was built, from wood, in 1360. The order to build the castle was given by King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV, in the location of a former gord of the Dukes of Ole\u015bnica. In 1533, the castle was transferred to the authorities of the city of Wroc\u0142aw. Soon after the castle's courtyard was extended with additional housing units. In the seventeenth and eighteenth-century, the castle underwent further reconstruction, namely after the fire in 1658 and in 1741 after the castle was plundered by Prussia troops during the First Silesian War. In the late- nineteenth century, the castle became property of the Haselbach family who founded the Namys\u0142\u00f3w/Namslau Brewery. Presently, the castle remains property of the town brewery. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 14th century Category:Castles in Opole Voivodeship Category:Namys\u0142\u00f3w County ",
