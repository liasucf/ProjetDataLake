Founded along the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway in the late 1880s, the community was named for the founder's sister. When a post office was opened in the community in late 1906, the potential of confusion with the community of Lela in Wheeler County to the northeast led the Post Office to attach \"Lake\" to the community's name.
