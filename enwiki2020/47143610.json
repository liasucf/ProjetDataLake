The action takes place in Sofia (Nadezhda Borough). The series was filmed block of flats, not a studio. The characters live in an old, Panel\u00e1k building. They were trying to face the negative side of the Bulgarian national psychology and other household problems-poverty, lack of money and annoying relatives (and neighbours). Since Season 3, the action was developing in a new building, because the old one was ruined. It was due to the fault of Tsekov (a contractor). == Actors == *Anton Radichev - Edelweiss Dzhambazov; young retiree, went on a mission in Cambodia living in blocks *Nadya Savova - grandmother Tsetsa Drambozova; Velichko's mother, mother-in-law of Mimi, landlady of Geri beloved grandfather Stefcho, gossip *Yavor Gigov - Velichko Drambozov; Tsetsa's son, husband of Mimi, house manager of the unit tester products *Militza Gladnishka - Mimi Drambozova; Velichko's wife, daughter grandmother Tsetsa, former shot-out player *Milena Markova - Geri; tenant of grandmother Tsetsa, owner of the salon in the block *Nevena Bozukova - Temenuga Balabanova; Geri's roommate (season 1), wife of Zhoro (season 2) works in the salon *Stanimir Gumov - Zhivko Zdravkov; Owner of Funeral bloc * == Seasons == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Seasons !Timeslot !Channel !TV Season !Episodes !Premiere !Finale |- |bgcolor=\"orange\" 1 height=\"10px\"| |1 | rowspan=\"4\" |Thursday, 9:00 PM | rowspan=\"4\" |Nova TV |2011 (Fall) |12 |September 29, 2011 |December 31, 2011 |- |bgcolor=\"green\" 1 height=\"10px\"| |2 |2012 (Spring) |12 |March 15, 2012 |May 31, 2012 |- |bgcolor=\"red\" 1 height=\"10px\"| |3 |2012 (Fall) |12 |September 20, 2012 |December 6, 2012 |- |bgcolor=\"brown\" 1 height=\"10px\"| |4 |2013 (Spring) |12 |March 7, 2013 |May 30, 2013 |} ==References== Category:Bulgarian television series Category:2010s Bulgarian television series Category:2013 Bulgarian television series endings Category:2011 Bulgarian television series debuts ",
