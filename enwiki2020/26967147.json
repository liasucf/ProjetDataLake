The area between axis and line are commonly emphasized with colors, textures and hatchings. * Scatter plot - type of mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values as collection of points for two variables for a set of data. * Circular charts - Radar chart (Spider chart) or Polar chart is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. * Accumulation charts - Pyramid (Cone) or Funnel chart displays data that, when combined, equals 100%. * Tree/Heat map - chart where the areas of the rectangles correspond to values. Other dimensions can be represented with colour or hue. * Finance chart - stock market prices are often depicted with an open-high-low-close chart with a traditional bar chart of volume at the bottom. * Cartogram chart is a map in which some thematic mapping variable \u2013 such as population, economic etc. \u2013 is substituted for land area. * Gantt chart - helps in scheduling complex projects. * Dependency graph is a directed graph representing dependencies of several objects towards each other. * Nomogram - a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a function: it uses a coordinate system other than Cartesian coordinates. * Organizational chart is a diagram that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions/jobs. * Flow chart - a diagram, that represents an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows. ==Flex Chart products== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: xx- small;\" ! style=\"width:15em;\" colspan=\"2\" | Chart type / Framework !
