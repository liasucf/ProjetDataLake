    "text": "Promised Land is the final studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land. The album was recorded in La Jolla, CA and released on 27 March 2001 via Audiophoric label. ==Reception== David R. Adler of Allmusic wrote \"Veteran tenor saxophonist Harold Land returns from a seven-year recording hiatus with Promised Land, featuring Mulgrew Miller on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums. (Sadly, this would be one of Higgins's last sessions.) One would expect nothing other than beauty and grace from these four revered players, and that's what they deliver, aided by the Audiophoric label's \"m-phoric\" recording technology, designed to capture live acoustic performance with exceptional fidelity. (You'll need to increase your volume and give your ears a chance to adjust.) There's a bit of Coltrane and Joe Henderson in Land's playing\u2014and perhaps a bit of Charlie Rouse, too, as Monk's \"Ugly Beauty\" reveals. Miller is in excellent form, dueting with Land on a nine-minute-plus \"What's New\" and taking crisp, inventive solos throughout. The program is evenly split: three standards and three of Land's fairly straightforward, modal pieces.\" A reviewer of All About Jazz stated \"Time allows, eventually, the opportunity for self-actualization\u2014one hopes. After a long, under-appreciated career and sparse discography, tenor saxophonist, Harold Land, affirms his stature on this album as an individual stylist. Land\u2019s sound has matured into something distinctly his own\u2014a combination of the swing style of his early career and a full command of Coltrane-inspired \u201csheets of sound\u201d...Notwithstanding the solid group dynamic between tenor and rhythm section, it is the leader\u2019s voice that prevails throughout this set. Straight-ahead fans will find fulfillment in this album from an often- overlooked jazz veteran.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Harold Land \u2013 tenor saxophone *Ray Drummond \u2013 bass *Billy Higgins \u2013 drums *Mulgrew Miller \u2013 piano ==References== Category:Harold Land albums Category:2001 albums ",
