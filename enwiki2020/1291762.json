    "text": "D\u00e1niel Gyurta (; born 4 May 1989) is a Hungarian former competitive swimmer who mainly competed in the 200-metre breaststroke. ==Biography== Gyurta was born in Budapest. When he was 15 years old, he won a silver medal (with 2.10.80) in the men's 200-metre breaststroke at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. His coaches are S\u00e1ndor Sz\u00e9les, Ferenc Kov\u00e1cshegyi and Bal\u00e1zs Virth. On August 12, 2008 he set an Olympic record in the preliminaries of the 200-metre breaststroke at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. His record was broken one day later by Kitajima in the semi-finals. Gyurta finished fifth in the final. At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships he won gold medal in 200 m breaststroke, edging out Eric Shanteau in the last meters. He was named Hungarian Sportsman of the year for this achievement. Two years later Gyurta retained the gold medal at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships, thus becoming the second man to defend the world title on 200 metre breaststroke after David Wilkie of Great Britain, who won the first two world titles, in 1973 and 1975. At the 2012 London Olympics he won the gold medal and set a new world record for the 200 m breaststroke. After the race, he offered a replica of his Olympic medal to the parents of his former competitor Alexander Dale Oen in tribute to him, a gesture much appreciated by Dale's family. Dale had died on 30 April 2012, a few months before the Games. Later, Gyurta received the international Fair Play Award from UNESCO, in respect of his medal tribute of a fallen fellow breaststroker: Alexander Dale Oen. His younger brother, Gergely Gyurta is also a competitive swimmer. ==Personal bests== In long course swim pools Gyurta's bests are: * 100 m breaststroke: 59.53 (29 July 2012, London) Hungarian Record * 200 m breaststroke: 2:07.23 (2 August 2013, Barcelona) Championship Record, European Record In short course pools Gyurta's best's are: * 50 m breaststroke: 27.00 (10 December 2009) Hungarian Record * 100 m breaststroke: 56.72 (11 December 2009, Istanbul) Hungarian Record * 200 m breaststroke: 2:00.48 (31 August 2014, Dubai) Former World Record ==Awards== * Ribbon Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary \u2013 Knight's Cross (2004) * Hungarian swimmer of the Year (5): 2004, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 * Hungarian Junior Athlete of the Year (2) - the National Sports Association (NSSZ) awards: 2004, 2007 * Junior Pr\u00edma award (2008) * Hungarian Sportsman of the Year (3) - votes of sports journalists: 2009, 2012, 2013 * Ribbon Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary \u2013 Officer's Cross (2010) * Best Youth Hungarian Athlete of the year (1) - the National Sports Association (NSSZ) awards: 2011 * Best Hungarian Junior Sportman of the Year (H\u00e9rakl\u00e9sz) (1): 2011 * Ribbon Order of Merit of Hungary \u2013 Commander's Cross (2012) * UNESCO Fair Play Award (2013) * Swimming World Magazine \u2013 European Swimmer of the Year (1): 2013 * Hungarian university athlete of the year (1): 2015 * Honorary Citizen of \u00dajpest (2016) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Budapest Category:Male breaststroke swimmers Category:Hungarian male swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Hungary Category:Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic silver medalists for Hungary Category:World record setters in swimming Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:Medalists at the FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) Category:European Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:European champions for Hungary Category:Olympic gold medalists in swimming Category:Olympic silver medalists in swimming Category:International Olympic Committee members ",
