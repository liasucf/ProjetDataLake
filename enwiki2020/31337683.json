    "text": "The Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters or Movement for the Struggle for Lithuanian Freedom ( or LLKS) was a resistance organization of the Lithuanian partisans, waging a guerrilla war against the Soviet Union in the aftermath of World War II. The organization was established on February 10, 1949, during a meeting of all partisan commanders in Minai\u010diai village. Jonas \u017demaitis (codename Vytautas) was elected as the chairman of its presidium. On February 16, the 31st anniversary of the 1918 Act of Independence of Lithuania, the Union adopted a declaration proclaiming itself to be the supreme political and military authority in Lithuania. In 1996, after Lithuania regained independence in 1990, the Seimas (parliament) recognized the declaration as an official act of the Republic of Lithuania and \u017demaitis as President of Lithuania. The organization and the partisan war were suppressed by the Soviet security agencies by 1953. ==Structure== ==References== * ==External links== * English translation of the Declaration of February 16, 1949 Category:Military units and formations established in 1949 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1953 Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Lithuania Category:Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic Category:1949 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:1953 disestablishments in the Soviet Union ",
