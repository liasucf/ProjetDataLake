    "text": "Massive Goods (or simply Massive) is a fashion brand and manga publisher. The company works with LGBTQ and feminist comic artists in Japan \u2013 particularly gay manga (bara) artists \u2013 to create products featuring their artwork, and English-language translations of their works. ==History== Massive was founded in 2013 by Anne Ishii and Graham Kolbeins concurrent with the release of The Passion of Gengoroh Tagame: Master of Gay Erotic Manga (Picturebox), the first English-language publication of works by Gengoroh Tagame, which Ishii and Kolbeins co-edited with Chip Kidd. Massive first released a line of t-shirts featuring artwork by Tagame and Jiraiya, which gained popularity in the LGBTQ hip-hop scene. On June 7, 2019, Massive went on hiatus. While the company continues to fulfill online orders, it is not presently planning new product launches or events. ===Fashion=== In partnership with other brands, Massive has launched several fashion and accessory lines, primarily featuring Jiraiya's artwork. In June 2014, Massive, Jiraiya, and Opening Ceremony launched a product line to commemorate Pride Month which featured apparel, accessories, and a Tenga sex toy. That same year, Mission Chinese Food and Massive released a t-shirt collaboration, also featuring art by Jiraiya. A second collaboration with Opening Ceremony and Jiraiya, \"Power-Up Massive\", launched in 2015, along with a line of swim briefs with artwork by Jiraiya created by Pretty Snake, the fashion brand founded by Project Runway contestant Joe Segal. ===Publishing=== In December 2014, Fantagraphics published Massive: Gay Erotic Manga and the Men Who Make It, the first English-language anthology of gay manga. Co-edited by Ishii, Kolbeins, and Kidd, Massive was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Anthology. Massive has published several English-language translations of d\u014djinshi, including Cretian Cow by Gengoroh Tagame, and Caveman Guu and Two Hoses by Jiraiya. In 2016, Massive co-produced with Koyama Press an English-language translation of What is Obscenity?: The Story of a Good For Nothing Artist and her Pussy, a graphic novel memoir by Rokudenashiko. The memoir was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. That same year, Massive began work with Pantheon Books on the English-language translation of My Brother's Husband, Gengoroh Tagame's first all-ages manga. The first volume in the series, translated by Ishii, won an Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material\u2014Asia. Massive Gay Manga, a publishing imprint set to launch under Bruno Gm\u00fcnder Verlag in 2017, was cancelled following the dissolution of the company. ==Artists represented== * Gengoroh Tagame * Jiraiya * Seizou Ebisubashi * Inu Yoshi * Rokudenashiko ==Publications== * The Passion of Gengoroh Tagame: Master of Gay Erotic Manga (2013), edited by Anne Ishii, Graham Kolbeins, and Chip Kidd; collecting works by Gengoroh Tagame * Caveman Guu (2013), story and art by Jiraiya * Massive: Gay Erotic Manga and the Men Who Make It (2014), edited by Anne Ishii, Graham Kolbeins, and Chip Kidd; collecting works by Gengoroh Tagame, Inu Yoshi, , Takeshi Matsu, Jiraiya, Gai Mizuki, Fumi Miyabi, Seizoh Ebisubashi, and Kazuhide Ichikawa * Cretian Cow (2015), story and art by Gengoroh Tagame * What is Obscenity?: The Story of a Good For Nothing Artist and her Pussy (2016), story and art by Rokudenashiko * Two Hoses (2017), story and art by Jiraiya * My Brother's Husband, Volume 1 (2017), story and art by Gengoroh Tagame * My Brother's Husband, Volume 2 (2018), story and art by Gengoroh Tagame * Gengoroh Tagame: Sketchbook (2018), collecting works by Gengoroh Tagame ==References== ==External links== * Massive Goods official website Category:2013 establishments in New York City Category:Book publishing companies based in New York (state) Category:Clothing brands of the United States Category:Clothing companies established in 2013 Category:Companies based in New York City Category:Gay art Category:Gay male pornographic comics Category:Manga distributors Category:Publishing companies based in New York City Category:Street fashion ",
