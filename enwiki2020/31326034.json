    "text": "A breast-shaped hill in the Western Sahara There is an ancient Iberian archaeological site beneath the Mola Murada, one of the mountains of the Moles de Xert, Spain. A breast-shaped hill is a mountain in the shape of a breast. Some such hills are named \"Pap\", an archaic word for the breast or nipple of a woman. Such anthropomorphic geographic features are to be found in different places of the world and in some cultures they were revered as the attributes of the Mother Goddess, such as the Paps of Anu, named after Anu, an important female deity of pre-Christian Ireland. ==Overview== The Mamelon Central, formed by the Bory and Dolomieu craters, Piton de la Fournaise, on 28 brumaire 1801. Drawing by Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent. The name Mamucium that gave origin to the name of the city of Manchester is thought to derive from the Celtic language meaning \"breast-shaped hill\", referring to the sandstone bluff on which the fort stood; this later evolved into the name Manchester.Hylton (2003), p. 6. Mostly breast-shaped hills are connected with local ancestral veneration of the breast as a symbol of fertility and well- being. It is not uncommon for very old archaeological sites to be located in or below such hills, as on Samson, Isles of Scilly, where there are large ancient burial grounds both on the North Hill and South Hill,Samson, South Hill Chambered Cairn - The Megalithic PortalSamson, North Hill - The Megalithic Portal or Burr\u00e9n and Burrena, Aragon, Spain, where two Iron Age Urnfield culture archaeological sites lie beneath the hills.Burr\u00e9n. Parque Arqueol\u00f3gico de la Primera Edad del Hierro en Frescano The \"Breasts of Aphrodite\" in Mykonos, Greece. Also the myths surrounding these mountains are ancient and enduring and some have been recorded in the oral literature or written texts; for example, in an unspecified location in Asia, there was a mountain known as \"Breast Mountain\" with a cave in which the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma (Da Mo) spent a long time in meditation. Travelers and cartographers in colonial times often changed the ancestral names of such hills. The mountain known as \"Didhol\" or \"Dithol\", Woman's Breast, by the Indigenous Australian people, was rechristened Pigeon House Mountain by Captain James Cook at the time of his exploration of Australia's eastern coast in 1770. \"Mamelon\" (from French \"nipple\") is a French name for a breast-shaped hillock. Fort Mamelon was a famous hillock fortified by the Russians and captured by the French as part of the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War of the 1850s. The word \"mamelon\" is also used in volcanology to describe a particular rock formation of volcanic origin. The term was coined by the French explorer and naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent. ==Africa== thelarchic-shaped Naasa Hablood in Somaliland (1896) View of one of the Trois Mamelles in Mauritius.
