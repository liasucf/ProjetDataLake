    "text": "Bernard Bamford Calvert (16 September 1942) is an English musician who played bass guitar and keyboards with The Hollies from 1966 until 1981. ==Career== He worked with several rock and roll groups during the early 1960s, most notably Rickie Shaw and the Dolphins, where he worked with future Hollies members, Tony Hicks and Bobby Elliott. Originally a pianist, Calvert, on Hicks's suggestion, switched to bass. After the break-up of the Dolphins, Calvert played in a number of semi-professional outfits. However, unable to advance his musical career, Calvert took a factory job until he was asked to substitute for Hollies' then bassist, Eric Haydock, in a tour of Scandinavia. After the tour, Calvert played on an Everly Brothers album, and on the Hollies' single, \"Bus Stop\", before returning to his factory job. Shortly after that, he was invited to join the Hollies permanently in 1966. Calvert was friends with Mama Cass Elliot from The Mamas & the Papas. ==Bass Guitars == Fender Precision After Eric Haydock left the band, Calvert was asked to replace him, and when he first joined The Hollies, his first choice of the electric bass was the Fender Precision Bass. The Fender Precision was an early model, still fitted with pickup and bridge covers. Calvert can be seen using this bass in his early years with the band, from 1966 to early 1967. But this particular model of the electric bass would resurface in 1969 where numerous recordings and live performances included this bass, and Calvert used this bass until his departure in 1980. Fender Jazz After the Fender Precision Bass, Calvert moved to a more versatile model of Fender Basses, the Jazz Bass. Similarly to the Fender Precision Bass, it is an early model, still fitted with pickup and bridge covers. Calvert would acquire this model of the electric bass in early-1967, and would use this bass guitar extensively in 1968, until his Fender Precision resurfaced in 1969. Some songs that included the Jazz Bass would be as notable as On A Carousel, Carrie-Anne, King Midas in Reverse, and so on. Rickenbacker 4000 In the early 1970s, around 70' or 71', Calvert purchased and acquired a Rickenbacker 4000 bass. The Rickenbacker 4000 bass was an early model in the bass catalog of Rickenbacker, it was a simple bass, with only one pickup located at the bridge. The distinct tone of the Rickenbacker helped Calvert throughout the 70s in recording and performing. Though he would perform more often with the Precision, his Rickenbacker would be heard the most in 70s recording such as the Distant Light album. Calvert would stick to this bass until his departure from the band. ==Honors == On 24 September 2009, the Hollies were nominated for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and on 18 December 2009 were announced as inductees, to be inducted on 15 March 2010. They were represented at the RRHOF ceremony by Clarke, Nash, Sylvester, Eric Haydock and Calvert. Although all of these members had left the band at various times, Bobby Elliott (drums) and Tony Hicks (guitar) kept the band going but were unable to attend because they had a prior booking. The two of them still lead the band, as of May 2020. ==See also== *List of bass guitarists ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:English rock bass guitarists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:English songwriters Category:People from Brierfield, Lancashire Category:The Hollies members Category:English rock keyboardists ",
