    "text": "Constant Lambert The Rio Grande is a secular cantata by English composer Constant Lambert. Written in 1927, it achieved instant and long-lasting popularity on its appearance on the concert stage in 1929. It is an example of symphonic jazz, not unlike the style of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, although it is very much Lambert's individual conception. It combines jazzy syncopation with lithe Latin American dance rhythms that create an air of haunting nostalgia. The Rio Grande is set to the impressionistic poem of the same name by Sacheverell Sitwell, and takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes to perform. This piece was dedicated to Angus Morrison, who played at its first performance. ==Style== The Rio Grande is scored for alto soloist, mixed chorus, piano, brass, strings and a percussion section of 15 instruments, requiring five players. It combines jazzy syncopations, ragtime and Brazilian influences, harmonies and rhythms inspired by Duke Ellington, with a traditional English choral sound. The outer sections are brisk, surrounding a central nocturne. The piano part often plays triplets against duplets, redolent of a rumba. The coda is based on material from the central section. Lambert noted in a 1928 article: Music critic Christopher Palmer said of this piece that The poem refers to a river in Brazil, although there is no Brazilian river called Rio Grande.Villa-Lobos Website ==Creation== The idea for this piece began when in 1923 Lambert attended Will Vodery\u2019s Plantation Orchestra. He later wrote: \u2018After the humdrum playing of the English orchestra in the first half, it was electrifying to hear Will Vodery\u2019s band in the Delius-like fanfare which preluded the second. It definitely opened up a new world of sound.\u2019 That \"new world of sound\" is the syncopated jazz sound that he would incorporate in The Rio Grande. While George Gershwin was clearly a major influence, Vodery's mention shows us that besides Gershwin, the entire jazz and Broadway zeitgeist of the day served as the influence for this piece. Frederick Delius also served as an inspiration. The chorus\u2019s fortissimo opening statement is a direct transcription of the fanfare that appears frequently in Delius' work (the famous \"Walk to the Paradise Garden\" from A Village Romeo and Juliet, to quote just one instance, has it in almost every bar). Delius knew much about spirituals from living among African-Americans in Florida. ==Premieres== Hamilton Harty Its first performance was a BBC Radio broadcast on 27 February 1928. The piano soloist was Angus Morrison,Morrison taught piano at London's Royal College of Music from 1926 to 1972. Although he largely shunned a concert career, he became friends with several British composers of his generation, notably Constant Lambert and William Walton. For his services to English music Morrison was awarded a CBE in 1979.

It was repeated at the subsequent Hall\u00e9 concert the following month. The first performance in Canada, and in North America, was on 11 February 1930, with Ernest Seitz and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Its first performance in New York City was in May 2018, when the Hunter College Choir, conducted by the Paul F. Mueller, performed this piece alongside Rossini's Stabat Mater. ==Reception== This is generally considered Constant Lambert's most famous work. Lambert intended Summer's Last Will and Testament to be his masterpiece but, to his chagrin, it never surpassed The Rio Grande in popularity.1001 Classical Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die, Matthew Rye ==Recordings== The composer made two recordings of The Rio Grande as conductor, both of which have held their place in the catalogue: * 11 January 1930: Albert Walter Whitehead (male alto; also seen as A.
