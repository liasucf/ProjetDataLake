Vijayaraghavachariar, a Visnhu devote, was a trusted administrator of Joseph Collett. Vijayaraghavachariar began his daily work only after worshipping Pavalavanna Perumal in Kancheepuram. As he was traveling to Kancheepuram daily, Joseph Collett gave money for the construction of this temple near Madras (Chennai) for the convenience of his trusted agent. Upon the completion of the construction of the temple, the area was named after Joseph Collett as Colletpet, which later changed to Kaladipethttp://indiancolumbus.blogspot.com/2011/01/kaladipet-varadaraja- perumal-temple.html. Vijayaraghavachariar continued the Kancheepuram visit. When questioned by Collett, he said that the beauty of the procession deity drew him there. Collett arranged to bring that deity here. Pavalavanna Nather told his devotee that he did not differ in appearance anywhere to His devotees. \"I am in the hearts of my devotees\" He said. Vijayaraghavachariar rendered his services to his Lord throughout his lifetime. ==Speciality of Temple == The Pavalavanna Perumal procession deity of the temple enjoys a special reputation in the temple with a staff in His left hand. The wedding festival is celebrated on the Panguni Uthiram day. He comes to the Mandap with Mothers Sridevi and Bhoodevi before the Mother Perundevi shrine where the festival is celebrated. Throughout the day Perumal grants darshan with Mother. After special Tirumanjanam, He returns to the sanctum sanctorum. During the wedding festival, those facing wedding problems offer unstripped coconut as nivedhana(offering), take it home and do pujas in the faith that their wedding would soon happen. As Perumal grants wedding boon, He is praised as Kalyana Varadaraja Perumal \u2013 Wedding Boon Perumal. A 9-day festival in connection with Sri Rama Navami (Lord Sri Rama's birthday) is celebrated in the temple. As this is celebrated after the birth of Sri Rama, this is called Janana Utsav. In this temple, this festival begins 9 days earlier and ends on Navami the birthday of the Lord, hence called Garba Utsav (Utsav when the Lord was in Mother Kausalya's womb). The coronation of Sri Rama is celebrated on this day. Earlier, it was an 18-day Garba and Birth Utsav covering both the periods. Now, the Garba Utsav only is celebrated. ==Festival== The festivals of the temple are, {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Thiruvottiyur, Varadharaja Perumal Temple |- | Festival || Month |- | 10 day Acharya Sri Ramanuja Vizha || Chithirai (April\u2013May) |- | Vaikasi Brahmmotsava || May\u2013June |- | Krishna Jayanthi || August\u2013September |- | Masi Magam || February\u2013March |- | Panguni Uthiram || March\u2013April |} == References == Category:Hindu temples in Chennai Category:Hindu temples in Tiruvallur district ",
