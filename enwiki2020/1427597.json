    "text": "Ganvie is a lake village in Benin, Africa, lying in Lake Nokou\u00e9, near Cotonou. With a population of around 20,000 people, it is probably the largest lake village in Africa and is very popular with tourists. The village was created in the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries by the Tofinu people who took to the lake to avoid Fon warriors who were capturing slaves for sale to European traders. Making the shallow waters and islands of Lake Nokoue a haven, the Ganvie villagers are often referred to as \"water men\" and the area itself is often called the \"Venice of Africa.\" Originally based on farming, the village's main industries other than tourism are now fishing and fish farming. The only means of transportation to and from the village is through wooden boats.
