    "text": "Avannaata (English: The Northern, (, ) is a new municipality of Greenland created January 1, 2018 from the bulk of the former Qaasuitsup municipality. It encompasses an area of 522,700 km\u00b2 and has 10,726 inhabitants. ==Geography== In the south, Avannaata is flanked by the Qeqertalik municipality. In the southeast, it is bordered by the Sermersooq municipality, however this border runs north-south (45\u00b0 West meridian) through the center of the Greenland ice sheet (), and as such is free of traffic. In the east and northeast it is bordered by the Northeast Greenland National Park. At the southern end of the municipal coastline are the waters of Disko Bay, although some Disko Bay communities belong to the municipality of Qeqertalik. This bay is an inlet of the larger Baffin Bay, which to the north edges into the island of Greenland in the form of Melville Bay. The coastline of northeastern Baffin Bay is dotted with islands of the Upernavik Archipelago, which is entirely contained within the municipality. In the far northwest near Qaanaaq and Siorapaluk, the municipal shores extend into Nares Strait, which separates Greenland from Ellesmere Island. Denmark claims Hans Island as part of Avannaata, while Canada considers it to be part of the Nunavut region of Qikiqtaaluk. ==Politics== Avannaata's municipal council consists of 17 members, elected every four years.
