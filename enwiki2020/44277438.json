    "text": "Miami Worldcenter is a large mixed-use development under constructionhttp://miamiworldcenter.com/news/ led by principals Arthur Falcone and Nitin Motwani, spanning several blocks in the Park West neighborhood of Miami, Florida, just north of downtown. It may include over 25 acres of land, with a convention center, hotel space, residential, as well as copious street level retail and large anchor tenant space, such as Macy's and Bloomingdale's. The hotel and convention center are planned to be part of the same 55 storey building. The hotel will be very large with 1,800 rooms over the approximately convention center. One proposed residential building known as the Miami Worldcenter Signature Tower may rise to the maximum above sea level permitted in that area. The project will connect with the Virgin Trains USA higher-speed rail system's Virgin MiamiCentral station. Taubman announced that it will not be developing an enclosed regional mall as demand moved away from enclosed malls. Instead the plans were changed to reflect an open-air development better suited for Miami's sunny weather. On 14 January 2019, the first development at Miami Worldcenter, the Caoba apartment tower, was opened.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate- news/article224540165.html ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in Miami ==References== ==External links== * * Miami Worldcenter at Emporis Category:Mixed-use developments in Florida ",
