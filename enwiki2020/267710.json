    "text": "Orio al Serio International Airport (), branded as Milan Bergamo Airport, is the third busiest international airport in Italy. It is located in the municipal territory of Orio al Serio, southeast of Bergamo in Italy. The airport is north-east of Milan, where it operates alongside Malpensa Airport and Linate Airport, the city's other two primary airports. The airport served almost 13 million passengers in 2018. The airport is managed by SACBO, a company partially owned by SEA \u2013 Aeroporti di Milano, the operator of Linate and Malpensa airports. SEA, the company that runs the latter two airports, also holds a 31% stake in SACBO. It is also christened \"Il Caravaggio\" after the Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, who lived as a child at Caravaggio in the Province of Bergamo. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== The following airlines operate scheduled and charter services in Bergamo:https://www.milanbergamoairport.it/it/orario-voli-stagionale/ ===Cargo=== ==Statistics== ===Traffic=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=align= |+ style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| Orio al Serio Airport \u2013 traffic information |- style=\"background:#ffdead;\" !
