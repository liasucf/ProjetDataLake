Peter the Great gave some lands close to Saint Petersburg to Senyavin, and the estate became known as the selo of Sinyavino. The selo was destroyed during World War II and never restored, but the name was transferred in the 1920s to the settlement of Sinyavino which was serving peat production. Currently it is an urban-type settlement in Kirovsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia. ==References== Category:Imperial Russian Navy admirals Category:1680s births Category:1738 deaths Category:Russian military personnel of the Great Northern War ",
