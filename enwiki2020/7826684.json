The season saw 11 top-class matches played in the country. In May, MCC published a revised code of the Laws of Cricket, calling themselves the \"Cricket Club at Marylebone\". This established the club as being in charge of the Laws and responsible for the sport's governance. ==Laws of Cricket== MCC produced the first official Laws of Cricket in a meeting on 30 May.The Laws of Cricket, CricInfo.

The Laws provided a more detailed version of the previous codes under which the game had been played, including specifying the size of the pitch, ball and wickets.
