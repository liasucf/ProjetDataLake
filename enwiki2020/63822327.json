Snap Send Solve is a privately owned Australia technology company headquartered in Melbourne. == History == Snap Send Solve was created in 2010 as an entry for the App My State by Outware Mobile as part of a Victorian Government open-data hackathon. The idea for the app was inspired by the founder who was frustrated by how hard it was to report a broken swing in a park. The app won a 2013 Melbourne Design Award. Originally, the free platform only allowed for reporting to every council in Australia however after a request from South East Water, the platform was expanded to include other authorities who have assets in the public domain such as water authorities, telecommunication and power authorities. Since then other authorities and organisations have been added to the platform such as universities, other Government departments such as Agriculture Victoria, Wildlife Victoria and housing communities. In 2015, Snap Send Solve was featured in an article in Government News by Maris Sansom titled 'Apps change the face of government' that outlines how apps such as Snap Send Solve are helping Councils save money by moving to more efficient channels. There are many other digital platforms that councils are adopting to help manage this transition. In 2016 Snap Send Solve entered a commercial agreement with Christchurch City Council in New Zealand. Christchurch City Council entered the app into the ALGIM Web and Digital Symposium where it won the 'Best Use of Social Media/App'. Since 2016 it has been adopted by other councils and authorities in New Zealand including Waimakariri District Council, Selwyn District Council, Ashburton District Council and Canterbury Regional Council. == Community Usage == Usage of Snap Send Solve by the community has grown over time. In 2018, it was reported that councils in New South Wales received 14,758 reports for parking issues. In January 2020 it was reported that Victorians had made 104,164 reports using Snap Send Solve, with the most popular incident categories being rubbish, graffiti and parking.
