The present name, adopted in 1889, is after the northeastern region of New England, the native home of the town's founders. A post office called New England City was established in 1889, and remained in operation until 1907. The Georgia General Assembly incorporated the place as the \"Town of New England City\" in 1891. The town's municipal charter was repealed in 1995. ==References== Category:Former municipalities in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Dade County, Georgia Category:Unincorporated communities in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Populated places disestablished in 1995 ",
