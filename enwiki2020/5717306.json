His Swiss friend Marguerite Respinger (1904-2000), whom he had met when he was studying in Cambridge and had invited to Vienna, was briefly (1926-1931) the only known female interest of Ludwig Wittgenstein. In 1939, Thomas Stonborough married Elizabeth Churchill, but they soon divorced (she was to remarry Washington Evening Star columnist Constantine Brown, and became a journalist and anti-communist activist under the name of Elizabeth Churchill Brown).
