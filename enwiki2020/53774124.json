Its basic order of battle included the 961st, 963rd, and the 965th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 814th Artillery Regiment. Still incomplete when the front line reached the division, the 274th was assigned to the Southern Front's 12th Army, defending the lower Dnieper. After the Soviet encirclement in the Battle of Kiev, the 1st Panzer Group advanced south into the front's northern flank in the rear of the 12th Army. The division, which had never received its full complement of artillery or anti- tank weapons, suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat. On 1 October, the 961st Rifle Regiment was detached to the 15th Rifle Division, and by 20 October the division's remnants were used as replacements for the 4th Rifle Division. === Second Formation === The 274th was formed for a second time from March to 10 May 1942 in the Moscow Military District. The division retained the same basic order of battle as the first formation, but added the 150th Anti-Tank Battalion. After its commander was assigned on 10 May, the division was transferred to the Moscow Defence Zone from the Moscow Military District training command. The 274th became part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command's 4th Reserve Army a month later, and was part of the Kalinin Front's 29th Army by the end of July. The army was moved to the Western Front in August, and the division transferred to the front's 30th Army in October. From April to December 1943, the division was part of the front's 31st Army.
