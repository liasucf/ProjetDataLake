It is located in the French-speaking part of the canton in the Jura mountains. ==History== Belprahon was formerly known by its German name, Tiefenbach, though this name is no longer used. Throughout most of its history, Belprahon was part of the lands of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Abbey's college of canons. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Belprahon became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Belprahon was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village was bypassed by the major roads through the Grand Val and so for most of its history was generally rural and agricultural. In the 1960s many commuters moved into the village and by 1990 three-quarters of the working population commuted to jobs in other towns. A majority of the workers who work in the municipality now work in the services sector. It is the only municipality in the Grand Val that is not part of the parish of Grandval.
