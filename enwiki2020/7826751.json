    "text": "Madingo Kayes is an archaeological site in modern-day Republic of Congo, lying close to the town of Madingo-Kayes. It is the site of one of the earliest documented complex societies in West Central Africa. Excavations conducted by James Denbow in the 1990s established a two order settlement pattern dated to the early centuries CE by Carbon-14 method. At least three sites of differing sizes were found, although their connections and the existence of any sort of settlement or economic hierarchy have not yet been established. ==References== *Denbow, James. \"Congo to Kalahari: data and hypotheses about the political economy of the western stream of the Early Iron Age.\" African Archaeological Review 1990, Volume 8, Issue 1, pp 139-175 Category:Archaeological sites in the Republic of the Congo Congo Category:1990s archaeological discoveries Category:Populated places established in the 1st century Category:1st-century establishments ",
