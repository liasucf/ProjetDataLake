    "text": "\"Lucky You\" is a song by American rapper Eminem featuring guest vocals from American rapper Joyner Lucas. It was sent to UK contemporary hit radio on November 30, 2018 as the third single from Eminem's album Kamikaze. \"Lucky You\" was nominated for the Best Rap Song Grammy Award at the 61st annual awards ceremony. The single also reached the top 10 in Australia, Canada, Finland, Greece, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. ==Music video== On September 10, 2018, Eminem teased on his Instagram that a music video for the song would be released on September 12. The teaser included multiple men in black sweatshirts falling from the sky onto a dirt ground. The video was not released on September 12, leading Eminem to later post another trailer for the music video, saying it would be released on the next day instead. The official video, directed by James Larese, was released on September 13, 2018. In the video, it follows Eminem and Lucas in combat vests and pants strolling throughout the ruins of a city. It includes wrecked cars and abandoned buildings. Throughout the video, multiple hooded men with black sweatshirts appear to be \"copying\" whatever the rappers are doing. This is supposed to be a shot at the new generation of rappers copying what the bigger artists are doing. One scene includes them performing random dances, which the hooded men copied. In the middle of Eminem's verse, a gunshot from the original track goes off, sending the hooded men into the sky. The video ends with the two rappers walking away from the swarm. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Ceremony !Award !Result |- ||2019 ||Grammy Awards (61st) |Best Rap Song | |} ==Track listing== ;Digital Download ==Personnel== *Eminem \u2013 lead vocals, production, mixing *Joyner Lucas \u2013 vocals *Dr. Dre \u2013 executive production *Boi-1da \u2013 production *Illa Da Producer \u2013 production *Jahaan Sweet \u2013 production *Brian \"Nox Beatz\" Eisner \u2013 additional mixing/recording/arrangement ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 31 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece Digital International Singles (IFPI) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (Latvijas Top 40) | 24 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Malaysia (RIM) | 19 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 2 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 6 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 71 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
