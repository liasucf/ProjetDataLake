Accessed 2011-03-26. committed by non- Indians in the Southwestern United States, particularly in the border towns surrounding the Navajo Nation and Jicarilla lands. In her 2006 dissertation, Lisa Donaldson classifies Indian rolling as a \"thrill-seeking hate crime\" and traces its roots to the colonization of the Southwest which created a \"power differential between groups that led to negative feelings toward minorities among law enforcement and local citizens\". The assaults, which often target alcoholic men who are comparatively defenseless, are variously described as representing \"rites of passage\", \"sport,\"Linthicum, Leslie.

Survivors report the act involves being assaulted with rocks, pellet guns, bottles, eggs, and baseball bats. Victims claim, furthermore, that law enforcement officials often refuse to intervene.Banish, Laura. Homeless: \u2018Indian rolling\u2019 still takes place today. The Daily Times. Farmington. 23 April 2004. The term first came to public notoriety in the spring of 1974 when three Navajos were beaten and murdered by white teenagers in the city of Farmington, New Mexico, and their mutilated bodies were subsequently found in a nearby canyon.

Subsequent protests by tribal members turned into riots when permits to march peacefully were revoked or not granted.Research Report: Navajo Community and Farmington, New Mexico (2006).

The incident triggered a report by the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights and inspired the true crime-novel The Broken Circle--A True Story of Murder and Magic in Indian Country by Rodney Barker.Barker, Rodney.
