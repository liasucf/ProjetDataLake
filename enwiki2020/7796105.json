    "text": "\"The Secret\" is a science fiction short story by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, first published as \"The Secret of the Men on the Moon\" in the August 11, 1963 issue of This Week magazine. It was later collected in The Wind from the Sun (1972) as \"The Secret\". ==Plot summary== \"The Secret\" is about a math reporter, named Henry Cooper, who goes to the Moon in 1959, to write a series of publicity articles for the U.N.S.A space division. Although he was invited by the U.N.S.A to provide favorable articles that might sway public opinion before the beginning of the budget deliberations, he finds, on this visit, he is much less welcomed than he was on his last trips there. He begins to suspect that a secret is being kept from him and becomes increasingly curious. A few days later his friend, the police commissioner, takes him to a remote lab. In the lab Cooper confronts one of the head scientists, who becomes convinced that the only way to keep the reporter silent is to bring him in on the secret. The secret, the scientist explains, is rather obvious when you come to think about it, and it's a wonder humankind hasn't thought of it in advance. On Earth the human heart pumps - over several decades - many gallons of blood upstream. Gravity tugs and pulls on the organs and tissues. On the Moon, however, everything is six times lighter than on Earth. The erosion of gravity is six times weaker. Who knows, concludes the scientist, how many years that might add to the human life expectancy? People could live up to 200 years of age. The reporter is then confronted with the sheer numbers of Earth's population - over six billion huddled together with not enough food and not enough space, relying on \"sea farms\" to provide food without sacrificing land. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1963 short stories Category:Short stories by Arthur C.
