    "text": "The Palace of Justice of Brussels (, Dutch: ) or Law Courts of Brussels is the most important court building in Belgium. It is located on the / in the Marolles/Marollen district of Brussels. Built between 1866 and 1883 by the celebrated architect Joseph Poelaert in the eclectic style, the building is reputed to be the largest constructed in the 19th century and is a notable landmark of Brussels. The total cost of the construction, land and furnishings was somewhere in the region of 45 million Belgian francs. This site is served by Louise/Louiza metro station (on lines 2 and 6 of the Brussels metro), and tram lines 92 and 94. From the lower part of town, it is also possible to take a lift called Ascenseur (Lift) des Marolles to access it. ==History== ===Inception and construction=== The current Palace of Justice is located on the Galgenberg hill, between Brussels' upper and lower town, where in the Middle Ages convicted criminals were hanged. A first courthouse had been erected on the site of a former Jesuit church, on Palace Square (today Justice Square), between / (today /) and /. Built between 1818 and 1823 by the architect Fran\u00e7ois Verly, this neoclassical structure had quickly deteriorated, and the question of building a new and larger courthouse arose as early as 1837. It was initially planned to rebuild it in the same place, but this project, the cost of which was estimated at 3 million Belgian francs, quickly aborted. The idea of building it in the Leopold Quarter was no more successful. In 1846\u201347, another reconstruction project was also buried. Joseph Poelart, the architect of the Palace of Justice In 1860, during the reign of King Leopold I, a Royal decree announced the construction of the new Palace of Justice, and an international architectural contest was organised for its design. After several failed proposals, the then-Minister of Justice Victor Tesch appointed Joseph Poelaert to draw plans of the building in 1861. The first stone was laid on 31 October 1866, and the building was inaugurated on 15 October 1883, four years after Poelaert's death. As for the old courthouse, it was demolished in 1892. alt= For the Palace of Justice's construction, a section of the Marolles/Marollen neighbourhood was demolished, while most of the park belonging to the House of Merode was also expropriated. The 75 landlords belonging to the nobility and the high bourgeoisie,AVB, Liste des expropriations, publi\u00e9e dans Poelaert et son temps, p.271: Plan du g\u00e9om\u00e8tre Van Keerbergen indiquant les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9rection du Palais de Justice de Poelaert, 9 f\u00e9vrier 1863 (A.V.B., T.P., 26.242). many of whom lived in their homes, received large indemnities, while the other more modest inhabitants, about a hundred, were also forced to move by the Belgian government, though they were compensated with houses in the Tillens-Roosendael garden city () in the Quartier du Chat in the Uccle municipality.Louis Qui\u00e9vreux, Bruxelles, notre capitale: histoire, folklore, arch\u00e9ologie, 1951, p. 257: \"Ceux qui lui donn\u00e8rent ce sobriquet, ce furent les expuls\u00e9s de la \u00abpartie\u00bb des Marolles d\u00e9molie afin que puisse \u00eatre \u00e9rig\u00e9 le colosse de la place Louise.

Poelaert himself resided in the Marolles, only a few hundred metres from the building, on /, in a house adjoining his vast offices and workshops and communicating with them.Poelaert et son temps, Bruxelles, (catalogue exposition), 1980, p. 166: \"Il habitait une maison rue des Minimes, voisine de ses bureaux et qui communiquait avec ceux-ci\"Le Patrimoine monumental de la Belgique, Bruxelles, 1C, Pentagone, N-Z, Brussels, edition Pierre Mardaga, 1994, p. 466: Boulevard de Waterloo. n\u00b0 12-13 \"Deux maisons bourgeoises jumel\u00e9es de quatre niveaux.\"....\"Le n\u00b0 13 \u00e9tait l'habitation personnelle de l'architecte Joseph Poelaert, au moins durant la construction du Palais de Justice et jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s en 1879. L'actuelle fa\u00e7ade d'allure Second Empire, datant des ann\u00e9es 1860, lui est peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame attribuable\". It is thus unlikely he saw himself as ruining the neighbourhood. Nonetheless, many angry citizens personally blamed Poelaert for the forced relocations, and the expression schieven architect (meaning \"shameful architect\") became one of the most serious insults in the dialect of the Marolles. Although the construction took place during the reign of King Leopold II, he showed little interest in the building, and it is not considered part of his extensive architectural programme in Brussels or his legacy as the \"Builder-King\". ===Damage and renovation=== At the end of the Second World War, on the eve of the liberation of Brussels, the retreating German forces started a fire in the Palace of Justice in order to destroy it, as well as the legal records it contained. As a result, the cupola collapsed and part of the building was heavily damaged. In 1947, the restoration work was entrusted to the architect-engineer Albert Storrer. By 1948, most of the building was repaired, and the cupola was rebuilt higher than the original, whose somewhat flat shape had been criticised. Renovations on the building have been in progress since 2003. These renovations pertain to the repair and strengthening of the roof structure and the walls, as well as putting a new layer on the gilded cupola. Progress is slow, and in 2013, it was reported that the decade-old scaffolding was so rusted and unsafe that the scaffolding itself was in need of renovation. ==Dimensions== Brussels' Palace of Justice was, at the time of its construction, the largest building in the world, and remains today one of the largest courthouses. The edifice is currently , and has a total built ground surface of , bigger than St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The high dome weighs 24,000 tonnes. The building has 8 courtyards with a surface of , 27 large court rooms and 245 smaller court rooms and other rooms. Situated on a hill, there is a level difference of 20 meters between the upper and lower town, which results in multiple entrances to the building at different levels. The building includes huge interior statues of Demosthenes and Lycurgus by the sculptor Pierre Armand Cattier, and figures of the Roman jurists Cicero and Ulpian by Antoine-F\u00e9lix Bour\u00e9. The central portico, high, is surmounted by a bust of the ancient Greek Titaness Themis, personification of divine law and order, by Joseph Ducaju. Moreover, the impressive main hall or salle des pas perdus (literally meaning \"room of the lost steps\") is around including the first floor gallery, and is long and wide. A compass rose with sixteen rays indicates the centre of the room.

Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production in Nazi Germany, stated in his book Inside the Third Reich that he had been dispatched to Brussels in 1940 to study the building. Although lacking the dome and being much smaller, the Justice Palace in Lima, Peru; which houses the Supreme Court of Peru, is based upon Brussels' Palace of Justice. ==See also== * History of Brussels * Belgium in the long nineteenth century ==References== ==External links== *Climbing the Law Courts * Justitiepaleis or Palais de justice Category:Palaces in Brussels Category:Libraries in Belgium Category:City of Brussels Category:Belgian law Brussels Category:Government buildings completed in 1883 Category:Terminating vistas ",
