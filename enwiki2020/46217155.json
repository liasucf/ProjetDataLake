    "text": "The Arun District Council elections, 2015 took place on Thursday 7 May 2015, electing all 54 members of the council, and taking place alongside a general election and other local elections in England and Northern Ireland. From the previous election, the council had undergone boundary changes which had reduced their number by 2. One councillor in Bersted had defected from the Liberal Democrats to the Green Party, bringing in the first Green councillor on Arun since the authority was formed in 1973. Following the elections, the Conservatives held control of the council for their 12th term of office, with Cllr Gill Brown continuing as leader. ==Election result== |} ==Ward results== ===Aldwick East=== ===Aldwick West=== ===Angmering & Findon=== ===Arundel & Walberton=== ===Barnham=== ===Beach=== ===Bersted=== ===Brookfield=== ===Courtwick with Toddington=== ===East Preston=== ===Felpham East=== ===Felpham West=== ===Ferring=== ===Hotham=== ===Marine=== ===Middleton-on- Sea=== ===Orchard=== ===Pagham=== ===Pevensey=== ===River=== ===Rustington East=== ===Rustington West=== ===Yapton=== ==References== Category:2015 English local elections Category:May 2015 events in the United Kingdom 2015 Category:2010s in West Sussex ",
