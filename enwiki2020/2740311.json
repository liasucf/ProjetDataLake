Near Heeley Bridge was Heeley railway station, opposite the Bridge Inn. The road ended at Toll Bar bridge on the Meers Brook, the former boundary between Yorkshire and Derbyshire. The street is home to a variety of pubs, shops, accommodation, a library and a former cinema which has also served as a Marks and Spencer store and a nightclub known as the \"Music Factory\" and \"Bed\", but has now been mostly demolished as part of the redevelopment works to create new retail units' on the ground floor and additional student flats on the upper floors. The 'Bed' facade was granted by the local authority as a landmark to the city and had to be retained; although the building is not listed by English heritage. It has since been restored and serves as the outer facade of a Sainsbury's mini market.
