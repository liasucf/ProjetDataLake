    "text": "The Chateau and Seigneurie de Launay are the estates and Castle of Launay that are situated in western France in the Perche Sarthois. The location of the castle is near the village of Lombron, in the Department of Sarthe. ==Middle Ages== The Seigneurie or Ch\u00e2tellenie or Fief of Launay makes casual appearance in documents dating to the early 11th century. Reference to the current Ch\u00e2teau de Launay first appears in the late 14th century in the form of transfer documents. The history of Launay, at one time one of the most powerful seigneuries in western France, is steeped in the events of the last 600 years. The early history is dependent on archival material which is incomplete. Seigneur (lord) Robin de Launay was the most powerful of the 22 vassals to the Count of Bresteau whose lands spanned seven parishes in western France. Much of the count's holdings were lost in the Hundred Years War. The lands and castle of Launay survived the wars though Robin de Launay did not. In 1404 the daughter of Robin de Launay inherited the properties and the associated title. Soon thereafter she married Pierre de Milon, Seigneur de Mortrie and Lavigne, the latter being a royal vassalage. In 1455 the Seigneurie of Launay passed to Jehan de Bernay who, like Pierre de Milon, was Seneschal to Montfort.Archives National de France RS 385 ==Renaissance== Letters from 1509, 1510, and 1527 make reference to Pierre de Bernay (likely the son of Jehan) as Seigneur de Launay. A rather melodramatic history involving Pierre survives in several sources. In 1523 de Bernay hid Gabrielle d\u2019 Harcourt (age 14 years) at Launay on behalf of his friend Comte (count) Charles de Coesmes, Seigneur de Luc\u00e9.Charles de Coesmes- Chevalier sous Louis XII et Francois I- Baron de Luce 1485-1543, Amalthee 21 Sept 2006 Charles was widowed when Gabrielle's older sister, his first wife, died a few months earlier. According to several accounts, Gabrielle was more than willing to marry Charles but her mother Anne de St. Germain was strongly opposed. Ultimately, Gabrielle and Charles married in a clandestine ceremony near Ch\u00e2teau de Launay on 28 December 1523. Anne de St. Germain pursued Charles de Coesmes and Pierre de Bernay relentlessly. She succeeded in obtaining a royal decree (Fran\u00e7ois I) condemning both men to public decapitation. It was specified that their corpses should remain on display in front of the gates to Anne's castle (Ch\u00e2teau de Bonn\u00e9table). Both men, along with Gabrielle and a few attendants fled and remained on the move for the next year and a half. Taking advantage of the imprisonment of Fran\u00e7ois I, following his defeat at the Battle of Paire, Charles appealed to the Duchess of Angoul\u00eame. Acting on behalf of Fran\u00e7ois I, the duchess granted a pardon to Charles. No mention was made of Pierre, however. Charles and Gabrielle were able to return to the region around Bonn\u00e9table. They eventually became favorites of Fran\u00e7ois and his court. Charles' Ch\u00e2tellenie of Luc\u00e9 was eventually elevated to a barony. The couple divided their time between Bonn\u00e9table and the royal court in Paris. Charles died at age 54 in 1543; Gabrielle remarried 13 months later. Her second marriage (Seigneur de Pescheray) was a short one. She died in 1546 at age 36. To a degree Pierre remained a fugitive. Records reveal that he was arrested on 6 October 1525. The death sentence, still in place, was not carried out but he was forced to pay a heavy fine in 1526. Beyond this all that is known of Pierre de Bernay is that he had a son, Jehan de Bernay, who inherited the Seigneurie de Launay. In 1551 the Seigneurie de Launay passed from the de Bernay family to the wealthy du Gronchay family. For the first time in its history, the transfer of the chateau, its lands and title was through sale rather than inheritance or marriage. Over the next three generations, seven members of the du Gronchay clan held the title and property at one time or another. In 1607 the surviving children of J\u00e9r\u00f4me de Gronchay, Jacquine (b. 1578) and Catherine (b. 1579), Dames de Lari\u00e8res and Launay inherited. When Jacquine married Jehan de Breton, Seigneur de la Calabriere, a few months later, Jehan became Seigneur de Launay, as well as Vaibesnard and Pouvray. Jehan died sometime before 1640, Jacquine then regained the position of Dame de Launay as well as the other seigneuries that had been controlled by her husband. In 1643 Robert le Balleur, son of Catherine du Gronchet and her husband Jean le Balleur, acquired Launay, Jacquine having died without heirs. According to the Charter of Launay, on 23 April 1650, Robert le Balleur, knight, Seigneur de Landres, Knight of the Royal Order, Chamberlain to the King, Sherif of Perche, Seigneur de Launay, Vaibesnard, and Pouvray, made an oath of filet to the Count of Bresteau. The charter shows that the oath was repeated in 1654. The oath was taken up by Catherine le Balleur in 1666 and again in 1671, having inherited from her husband, Robert. Catherine's son, Henri, signed the oath in 1683. In 1694 Henri le Balleur, in the presence of Le Mans notaries, Victor Siger and Guillaume Foin, sold to Monsieur and Madame Andr\u00e9 Guyonneau, king's councillor and lieutenant, Seneschal of Le Mans, The sale was transacted at a price of 150,479 livres. The new Seigneur de Launay, Andr\u00e9 Guyonneau, was king's lieutenant, magistrate of Le Mans and advisor to the king.L'Edict de 1696, Armorial G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France In 1692 he married the very wealthy Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Hoyau. Their son, Fran\u00e7ois Guyonneau, born in 1696, took charge of Andr\u00e9's properties on his death in 1722. Little is known of Fran\u00e7ois; he died in 1760 leaving behind two children, Anne Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9. Anne Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was born 25 August 1728. She was married to the Seigneur de Gigny in 1747. When he died in 1758 she was left with quite a fortune. Contemporaries described her subsequent life as frivolous in the extreme. She managed to spend the entire fortune before dying in poverty and obscurity in 1770.Archive Historique du Maine, BiblioBazaar, Nov 2009. ==French Revolution and 19th century== Her brother, Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 Guyonneau, was the first to style himself as Sieur de Grandmaison. He pursued a military career, first as a lieutenant in the \"Iron Regiment\", later as Captain of the Queen's household. He died in January 1794. The Lombron Parish registry recorded that on Sunday, 18 September 1762 much of the seigneurial Grandmaison was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt and somewhat enlarged over the next two years. In another set back many of the Launay properties were confiscated by the Republicans (French Revolution) in June 1791. Three children were born to Andr\u00e9 Guyonneau and his wife, Anne Gabrielle Harrison d\u2019 Auvours. Two boys died as young children. A daughter, Anne Fran\u00e7oise, was born 1 December 1772. She married Jacques Louis Belin de B\u00e9ru (twice her age at the time of their wedding in January 1796). Despite the seizure of property by the Republic, Anne was quite wealthy at the time of her marriage; her most valuable asset was the Domaine of Grandmaison.Launay alias La Grandmaison, Oeuvre de Pierre Dufour, Instituteur Public, Lombron 1960 Louis was imprisoned in Paris during the Terror. He would have been executed if not for the timely fall from power of Robespierre. Louis went on to have a long and successful career in the National Assembly. He died at age 81 in 1828; Anne died 14 September 1840. At the time of her death the Domaine de Grandmaison included 125 ha. The holdings included the chateau as well as named properties: la Fureti\u00e8re, la Chalopini\u00e8re, les Petits and Grand Gu\u00e9raule and le Degoutier. Anne and Jacques de Grandmaison had no children. Thus, after eight centuries, the powerful Domaine de Launay was poised to be dismembered. The greater part of the domaine, including the chateau and 101 ha of land were acquired (partly through inheritance, partly through purchase) by the widow, Madame Duqu\u00e9 of LeMans. Over the remainder of the 19th century ownership of the ch\u00e2teau changed hands four more times. Much of the land was sold off. At its nadir Grandmaison/ Launay included only 3.4 ha of land. ==World War II and 20th century== In 1912 the property was purchased by the wealthy Rolot family of Paris. It became the principal residence of the son, Jacques Rolot, having earlier served the small family as a summer home. Jaques Rolot fled with his family in advance of the invading Germans in 1940. The ch\u00e2teau was occupied by the Germans throughout most of the war, serving as a command center (9th Panzer Division) and quarters for German officers. Early on, under the direction of the propaganda officer assigned to the unit most of the extensive library was burned. Fortunately, many of the unique historical documents in the library were among the few volumes spared. On 9 August 1944 the ch\u00e2teau and surrounding regions were liberated by the U.S. 5th Armored Division and the 79th Infantry Division.Sarthe, ao\u00fbt 1944 Histoire d'une Lib\u00e9ration, Fabrice Avoie, 2009. ASIN B005MIY9P2 Unfortunately the retreating Germans took time to vandalize the ch\u00e2teau extensively. Following the war, Jacques returned to Lombron but did not resume residence at the ch\u00e2teau. He did oversee considerable repair and restoration. Through the 1950s the ch\u00e2teau and its meager remaining land changed hands numerous times. Ultimately it was acquired by an unremarkable local who lived there with his family for a decade. To the previous insults of fire, political confiscation, war and vandalism was now added the shameless pillage and sale of historic fixtures. Arguably Launay was at its historic ebb when it was sold to Marcel-Pierre Cl\u00e9ach and his wife in 1970. ==Recent history== Monsieur Cl\u00e9ach was early in his political career in 1970. He would go on to become one of the longest serving and most powerful French Senators of the Fifth Republic. He also began the process of restoring Launay to something of its noble past. He extensively repaired and upgraded the interior and also undertook ambitious renovations of the west wing of the ch\u00e2teau. He began the process of reversing the damage done during and subsequent to the war, a project which continues to the present. In 1979 Cl\u00e9ach, having acquired the large Ch\u00e2teau de Lorresse sold Launay to Jacques Maes. Maes continued with improvements to the buildings and repurchased some of the former land holdings, bringing the current expanse to 38 acres. In 2000 Maes sold Launay with its expanded property to David and Marie-Laure MacKee (Baron and Baronne de Monasterevan) who have continued the restoration and conservation efforts. ==References== Launay ",
