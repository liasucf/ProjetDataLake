    "text": "Cotner v. Henry, 394 F.2d 873 (7th Cir., 1968), was a marital privacy case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that a criminal sodomy statute is constitutionally inapplicable to private, consensual physical relations between married persons. Hugh Hefner noted, \"Cotner served nearly three years in prison before the Playboy Foundation was able to free him.\" The Foundation had helped underwrite Cotner's habeas corpus petition. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. ==References== Category:1968 in United States case law Category:United States family case law ",
