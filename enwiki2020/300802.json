    "text": "Huyton ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, Merseyside, England. Part of the Liverpool Urban Area, it borders the Liverpool suburbs of Dovecot, Knotty Ash and Belle Vale, and the neighbouring village of Roby, with which it formed Huyton with Roby Urban District between 1894 and 1974. Historically in Lancashire, Huyton was an ancient parish which in the mid-19th century contained Croxteth Park, Knowsley and Tarbock in addition to the township of Huyton-with-Roby. It was part of the hundred of West Derby, an ancient subdivision of Lancashire, covering the southwest of the county. ==History== ===Medieval=== Huyton was first settled about 600\u2013650 AD by Angles. The settlement was founded on a low hill surrounded by inaccessible marshy land. The first part of the name may suggest a landing-place, probably on the banks of the River Alt. Both Huyton and Roby are mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Huyton being spelt Hitune. ===Industrial development=== Huyton-with-Roby is situated near to the south-western extremity of the former Lancashire coalfield. In the 19th century Welsh workers settled in the area to work in nearby collieries. A Welsh-speaking Non-conformist chapel (Calvinistic Methodists) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby Cronton Colliery finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985). Both Huyton and Roby have stations on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (another station, Huyton Quarry, closed in 1958). The railway's construction was supervised by George Stephenson and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world's first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway's official opening, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington alighted the train at Roby station. ===Second World War=== During the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the Luftwaffe but the scale of destruction was much less than that experienced by Liverpool, Bootle and Birkenhead. Schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton, instead schools and homes were provided with air-raid shelters. Huyton was also host to three wartime camps: an internment camp, a prisoner-of-war camp and a base for American servicemen. The internment camp appeared to have been one of the biggest in the country. Some internees were refugees from the Nazis, including socialists such as Kurt Hager and a large number of artists attacked for their \"degeneracy.\" Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer Kurt Jooss, musicians, sociologist Norbert Elias, anthropologist Eric Wolf and composer Hans G\u00e1l. More than 40 per cent of Huyton's internees were over 50 years old. The camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with barbed wire fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents. Initially the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the Isle of Man. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship the Arandora Star, with the loss of nearly 700 lives, the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the \"Bluebell Estate\" and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of the Second World War. The prisoner of war camp closed in 1948. Some inmates \"went native\", stayed in Britain and married local women. Among those in the Huyton camp was Bert Trautmann, who later went on to be the 1950s goalkeeper for Manchester City. From 1944, American servicemen were temporarily stationed in Huyton. ===Murders=== Huyton was brought to national attention in 2005 after the racially motivated murder of black teenager Anthony Walker in McGoldrick Park. Two white local youths were later found guilty of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. They were 17-year-old Michael Barton (brother of footballer Joey Barton) and 20-year-old Paul Taylor. In July 2008, an 18-year-old man, Michael Causer was battered to death in a homophobic attack at a house in Huyton. ==Governance== In 1894, the township was included in the Huyton with Roby Urban District. \"Since the First World War, Huyton-with- Roby has been transformed into a residential suburb of Liverpool, while agriculture, formerly the area's main occupation, has almost disappeared\". In 1932 Liverpool City Council purchased a large area of the Earl of Derby's Knowsley estate. Thereafter, throughout the 1930s, the city built four large housing estates in the north-west of Huyton-with-Roby. These Liverpool \u2018overspill' housing estates were Fincham, Huyton Farm, Longview and Woolfall Heath. Other smaller developments were commissioned by the urban district council or privately commissioned. By 1950 the population was over 55,000, the vast majority of whom had moved to the area from the city of Liverpool. After the Second World War, the district successfully fought off absorption into the Liverpool City Council boundaries. However, its own application for borough status failed in 1952. On 1 April 1974, Huyton-with-Roby became part of the new metropolitan borough of Knowsley. By convention, Huyton-with-Roby contains Huyton Park, Roby, Longview, Huyton Quarry, Page Moss, Woolfall Heath, Bowring Park, Fincham, and Court Hey. Today this area is divided into seven local government wards: Longview, Page Moss, Roby, St. Bartholomew's, St. Gabriel's, St. Michael's, and Swanside. Huyton was immortalised in a poem by Thomas Arthur Lumley: Huyton, Huyton, two dogs fightin' / One was a blackin and the other was a whitin This recognised the long-standing rivalry within the area between religious factions which reached a nadir in the seventies with end-of- term fighting between opposing Roman Catholic and Church of England Schools such as St. Augustine's of Canterbury and Seel Road School. ==Transport== Huyton is located just west of the M57 motorway which marks its border. Liverpool city centre is to the west via the M62 motorway. ===Huyton railway station=== Huyton railway station, formerly called Huyton Gate, is served by regular City Line services to and from Liverpool, St. Helens, Wigan and further afield. ===Huyton bus station=== Huyton bus station Huyton bus station is on Huyton Hey Road, adjacent to the shopping centre and 140 metres away from the Huyton railway station. Buses from Huyton bus station serve destinations as far afield as Liverpool, Kirkby, St. Helens, Warrington, Runcorn and Liverpool John Lennon Airport. ==Education== Huyton has one secondary school\u2014Lord Derby Academy on Seel Road\u2014and fifteen primary schools. A construction training college is on Princess Drive. ==Amenities== Huyton Parish Church of St Michael The shopping centre of Huyton is still referred to by local people as \"the village\" or \"the villie\", which dates back to the days when the centre was a rural village community. An Asda Walmart complex has been built nearby. There are also around 100 other independent shops and previously hosted an indoor market, which has since been closed. The area is host to Huyton Library (Civic Way) and before 2014 was also served by Page Moss Library (Stockbridge Lane). There is also a contemporary art gallery at Huyton Library. There are eight public parks: Court Hey Park, Bowring Park (the oldest public park in Knowsley, opened in 1907), Huyton Lane Wetland, Jubilee Park (Twig Lane/Dinas Lane), McGoldrick Park (Rydal Road), Sawpit Park (Hall Lane/Sawpit Lane), Stadt Moers Park (covers more than of land between Whiston and Huyton) and St. John's Millennium Green (Manor Farm Road). There are also nine children's playgrounds. Huyton has a King George's Field in memorial to King George V. It also has one of the biggest dogs' homes in Merseyside, Dogs' Trust, located on Whiston Lane. Huyton has many public houses including The Huyton Park Hotel, The Stanley Arms (named after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby), The Crofters, Seel Arms, Queens Arms, Oak Tree, The Old Bank, Longview Social Club and The Swan. The former Wheatsheaf/Rose And Crown reopened as The Barker's Brewery on 23 January 2011, as part of the Wetherspoon chain of pubs. Several former landmark pubs have been demolished for new projects since the late 1990s: The Dovecot, Bluebell Inn, Farmers Arms, Hillside, Eagle and Child, The Quarry Inn and The Quiet Man. In January 2012, the Longview Social Club was destroyed by a fire on the premises. In the early hours of 16 April 2015, four supermarkets at Longview Shops were destroyed by fire and later demolished due to extensive damage. The fire started at a One Stop store and spread across another three businesses. Merseyside Police later revealed the blaze was caused by an attempted burglary. ==Sport== The area is served by Knowsley Leisure and Culture Park (Longview Drive) and King George V Sports Centre (Longview Lane). Huyton-with- Roby boasts two 18 hole golf courses: Huyton & Prescot Golf Club (founded in 1905) and Bowring Golf Club (according to a sign at the course, the oldest municipal golf course in England). Huyton has its own cricket club, located off Huyton Lane which was founded in the mid-1860s by the Stone family and the town has produced at least one first class cricketer: Reginald Moss. Huyton also had a professional rugby league club from 1968 to 1985. It was formed from Liverpool Stanley (1934\u20131951) and Liverpool City (1951\u20131968). Huyton RLFC struggled in the second division of the Rugby Football League until 1985, when they were replaced by Runcorn Highfield. This club, later renamed Highfield, struggled on near the bottom of the pro game: in 1995\u20131996 they gained just one point all season and changed their name to Prescot Panthers, before folding at the end of the 1997 season. (Huytonians still interested in supporting pro rugby league have the choice of either St. Helens or Widnes Vikings, both of whom are away from Huyton). In football, the town has produced two outstanding midfield England internationals: Peter Reid (Everton) and Steven Gerrard (Liverpool). Other footballers include Joey Barton, Craig Hignett, Tony Hibbert, David Nugent, Lee Molyneux, Leon Osman, John Relish, Greg Tansey, Lee Trundle and Callum McManaman. Notably on 28 March 2007, two of Huyton's most prominent footballers starred for England in a 3\u20130 away win in Andorra. Goals came from Steven Gerrard (2) and David Nugent in a proud night for Huyton. Both players were educated at Cardinal Heenan High School, who have a track record as one of the country's top schools for sport. Huyton has many amateur football teams at both junior and senior level, but only one FA Charter Standard Club, Paramount Community Football Club. Despite producing so many pro footballers, Huyton has never been able to sustain a semi-pro club for long. Nearby Kirkby Town changed their name to Knowsley United in 1988 and moved to Alt Park, the former home of Huyton Rugby league Club. In United's first five seasons they were successful. In 1988\u201389 they finished runners-up in the North West Counties Football League. The following season they were champions and won promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One. They were accordingly promoted to the Premier Division. The following season they reached the first round proper of the FA Cup, only to be beaten by Carlisle United at home. The momentum did not last and Knowsley United ceased to be a senior semi-pro side in 1998. Huytonians wishing to support a local semi-pro outfit have Prescot Cables located at Valerie Park in the Northern Premier League (Premier Division) less than away. ==Notable people== Huyton-with-Roby has several Beatles connections.
