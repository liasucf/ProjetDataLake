    "text": "The Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA) was founded in 1999 by Jewish Angelenos who broke away from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Jewish Congress. They sought to assert a Jewish interest in the campaigns for social justice in Southern California, which has the United States' second largest Jewish population. Progressive Jewish Alliance expanded in February 2005 by opening a San Francisco Bay Area chapter. The PJA stated goals are social justice, judicial reform, and improved working conditions. They also try to facilitate dialogue between non-violent young offenders and their victims and between Jews and Muslims. PJA ran the Jeremiah Fellowship, which trains young Jews to be future social justice leaders. In addition, the PJA conducted education programs and quarterly holiday events on the intersection of art, culture and politics. On June 1, 2011, Progressive Jewish Alliance merged with Jewish Funds for Justice (JFSJ), adopting the name Bend the Arc in 2012. ==References== == External links == * Category:Jewish-American political organizations Category:Liberalism and religion Category:Organizations established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in California ",
