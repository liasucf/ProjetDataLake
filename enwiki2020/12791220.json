    "text": "In mathematics, singular integrals are central to harmonic analysis and are intimately connected with the study of partial differential equations. Broadly speaking a singular integral is an integral operator : T(f)(x) = \\int K(x,y)f(y) \\, dy, whose kernel function K : Rn\u00d7Rn \u2192 R is singular along the diagonal x = y. Specifically, the singularity is such that |K(x, y)| is of size |x \u2212 y|\u2212n asymptotically as |x \u2212 y| \u2192 0\\. Since such integrals may not in general be absolutely integrable, a rigorous definition must define them as the limit of the integral over |y \u2212 x| > \u03b5 as \u03b5 \u2192 0, but in practice this is a technicality. Usually further assumptions are required to obtain results such as their boundedness on Lp(Rn). ==The Hilbert transform== The archetypal singular integral operator is the Hilbert transform H. It is given by convolution against the kernel K(x) = 1/(\u03c0x) for x in R. More precisely, : H(f)(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\int_{|x-y|>\\varepsilon} \\frac{1}{x-y}f(y) \\, dy. The most straightforward higher dimension analogues of these are the Riesz transforms, which replace K(x) = 1/x with : K_i(x) = \\frac{x_i}{|x|^{n+1}} where i = 1, \u2026, n and x_i is the i-th component of x in Rn. All of these operators are bounded on Lp and satisfy weak-type (1, 1) estimates. ==Singular integrals of convolution type== A singular integral of convolution type is an operator T defined by convolution with a kernel K that is locally integrable on Rn\\\\{0}, in the sense that Suppose that the kernel satisfies: 1\\. The size condition on the Fourier transform of K :\\hat{K}\\in L^\\infty(\\mathbf{R}^n) 2\\. The smoothness condition: for some C > 0, :\\sup_{y eq 0} \\int_{|x|>2|y|} |K(x-y) - K(x)| \\, dx \\leq C. Then it can be shown that T is bounded on Lp(Rn) and satisfies a weak-type (1, 1) estimate. Property 1. is needed to ensure that convolution () with the tempered distribution p.v. K given by the principal value integral :\\operatorname{p.v.}\\,\\, K[\\phi] = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+} \\int_{|x|>\\epsilon}\\phi(x)K(x)\\,dx is a well-defined Fourier multiplier on L2. Neither of the properties 1. or 2. is necessarily easy to verify, and a variety of sufficient conditions exist. Typically in applications, one also has a cancellation condition : \\int_{R_1<|x|<R_2} K(x) \\, dx = 0 ,\\ \\forall R_1,R_2 > 0 which is quite easy to check. It is automatic, for instance, if K is an odd function. If, in addition, one assumes 2. and the following size condition : \\sup_{R>0} \\int_{R<|x|<2R} |K(x)| \\, dx \\leq C, then it can be shown that 1. follows. The smoothness condition 2. is also often difficult to check in principle, the following sufficient condition of a kernel K can be used: * K\\in C^1(\\mathbf{R}^n\\setminus\\\\{0\\\\}) * | abla K(x)|\\le\\frac{C}{|x|^{n+1}} Observe that these conditions are satisfied for the Hilbert and Riesz transforms, so this result is an extension of those result. ==Singular integrals of non-convolution type== These are even more general operators. However, since our assumptions are so weak, it is not necessarily the case that these operators are bounded on Lp. ===Calder\u00f3n- Zygmund kernels=== A function K : Rn\u00d7Rn -> R is said to be a Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund kernel if it satisfies the following conditions for some constants C > 0 and \u03b4 > 0. : (a) \\qquad |K(x,y)| \\leq \\frac{C}{|x-y|^n} : (b) \\qquad |K(x,y) - K(x',y)| \\leq \\frac{C|x-x'|^\\delta}{\\bigl(|x-y|+|x'-y|\\bigr)^{n+\\delta}}\\text{ whenever }|x-x'| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\max\\bigl(|x-y|,|x'-y|\\bigr) : (c) \\qquad |K(x,y) - K(x,y')| \\leq \\frac{C|y-y'|^\\delta}{\\bigl(|x-y|+|x-y'|\\bigr)^{n+\\delta}}\\text{ whenever }|y-y'| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\max\\bigl(|x-y'|,|x-y|\\bigr) ===Singular integrals of non-convolution type=== T is said to be a singular integral operator of non- convolution type associated to the Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund kernel K if : \\int g(x) T(f)(x) \\, dx = \\iint g(x) K(x,y) f(y) \\, dy \\, dx, whenever f and g are smooth and have disjoint support. Such operators need not be bounded on Lp ===Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators=== A singular integral of non-convolution type T associated to a Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund kernel K is called a Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operator when it is bounded on L2, that is, there is a C > 0 such that : \\|T(f)\\|_{L^2} \\leq C\\|f\\|_{L^2}, for all smooth compactly supported \u0192. It can be proved that such operators are, in fact, also bounded on all Lp with 1 < p < \u221e. ===The T(b) theorem=== The T(b) theorem provides sufficient conditions for a singular integral operator to be a Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operator, that is for a singular integral operator associated to a Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund kernel to be bounded on L2. In order to state the result we must first define some terms. A normalised bump is a smooth function \u03c6 on Rn supported in a ball of radius 10 and centred at the origin such that |\u2202\u03b1 \u03c6(x)| \u2264 1, for all multi-indices |\u03b1| \u2264 n + 2\\. Denote by \u03c4x(\u03c6)(y) = \u03c6(y \u2212 x) and \u03c6r(x) = r\u2212n\u03c6(x/r) for all x in Rn and r > 0\\. An operator is said to be weakly bounded if there is a constant C such that : \\left|\\int T\\bigl(\\tau^x(\\varphi_r)\\bigr)(y) \\tau^x(\\psi_r)(y) \\, dy\\right| \\leq Cr^{-n} for all normalised bumps \u03c6 and \u03c8. A function is said to be accretive if there is a constant c > 0 such that Re(b)(x) \u2265 c for all x in R. Denote by Mb the operator given by multiplication by a function b. The T(b) theorem states that a singular integral operator T associated to a Calder\u00f3n- Zygmund kernel is bounded on L2 if it satisfies all of the following three conditions for some bounded accretive functions b1 and b2: (a) M_{b_2}TM_{b_1} is weakly bounded; (b) T(b_1) is in BMO; (c) T^t(b_2), is in BMO, where Tt is the transpose operator of T. ==See also== * Singular integral operators on closed curves ==Notes== ==References== *. *. *. * (in Russian). *. *, (European edition: ). * ==External links== * Category:Harmonic analysis Category:Real analysis ",
