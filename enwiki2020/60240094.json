    "text": "Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division was a designation applied from 1945\u20131965 to a group of factories operated by General Motors. The terminology is confusing because most plants assembled more than just Chevrolet or B-O-P, and refers to the management structure only. The five brands originated vehicles from their respective \"home\" plants, where vehicles were assembled locally for their respective regions. Vehicles were also produced in \"knock- down\" kits and sent to the branch assembly locations. The \"home\" branches were Flint, Michigan for both Buick and Chevrolet; Oldsmobile at Lansing, Michigan; Pontiac at Pontiac, Michigan; and Cadillac at Detroit, Michigan. Plants operating under Chevrolet Assembly management prior to General Motors Assembly Division management (most established pre-1945) were located at St. Louis, Missouri; Janesville, Wisconsin; Buffalo, New York; Norwood, Ohio; Flint (#2), Michigan; Oakland, California; Tarrytown, New York; Lakewood, Georgia; Leeds, Missouri; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles (Van Nuys), California; Ypsilanti (Willow Run), Michigan; and Lordstown, Ohio. Framingham, Massachusetts is unusual in that it changed from B-O-P to Chevy management prior to becoming GMAD. *Arlington Assembly, Arlington, Texas (Dallas area) *Doraville Assembly, Atlanta, Georgia *Fairfax Assembly, Kansas City, Kansas *Framingham Assembly, Framingham, Massachusetts (Boston area) *Fremont Assembly, Fremont, California (San Francisco Bay area) *Linden Assembly, Linden, New Jersey (New York City area) *South Gate Assembly, South Gate, California (Los Angeles area) *North Tarrytown Assembly, Tarrytown, New York (New York City area) *Wilmington Assembly, Wilmington, Delaware ==References== Category:General Motors ",
