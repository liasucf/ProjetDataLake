    "text": "Victoria Houston is an American writer. She is the author of the Loon Lake Series, a series of murder mysteries. The mysteries are set in the Northwoods of Wisconsin against a background of fly fishing as well as fishing for muskie, bass, bluegill and walleyes. She has also written or co-authored over seven non-fiction books. Houston had been formerly married to a man nine years younger than herself, and their union led Houston to interview 40 couples in similar circumstances, resulting in the book Loving a Younger Man: How Women Are Finding and Enjoying a Better Relationship. Houston lives and works in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. ==Bibliography== Loon Lake Fishing Mystery **Dead Big Dawg (2019) **Dead Firefly (2018) **Dead Spider (2017) **Dead Loudmouth (2016) **Dead Rapunzel (2015) **Dead Lil' Hustler (2014) **Dead Insider (2013) **Dead Tease (2012) **Dead Deceiver (2011) **Dead Renegade (2009) Bleak House Books **Dead Hot Shot (2008) Bleak House Books **Dead Madonna (2007) **Dead Boogie (2006) **Dead Jitterbug (2005) **Dead Hot Mama (2004) **Dead Frenzy (2003) **Dead Water (2001) **Dead Creek (2000) **Dead Angler (2000) **Loving a Younger Man: How Women Are Finding and Enjoying a Better Relationship **Making It Work: Finding the Time and Energy for Your Career, Marriage, Children, and Self * with Jamie Raab ** My Health History * with Tom Shelby ** Michelle and Me (2002) * with James Simon ** Restore Yourself : A Woman's Guide to Reviving her Sexual Desire and Passion for Life (2001) * with Helen L.
