Liliw is perhaps best known for its cold water spring resorts, native homemade sweets and a sizeable shoe industry that rivals that of Marikina City. The town is also known for its baroque church and its Liliw-style houses. The local government is currently undertaking means to conserve its cultural heritage sites and has proposed to enact a legislation that would mandate the usage of the Liliwstyle architecture as the only means of construction and re-construction in the town. If the ordinance passes, Liliw will have a greater chance to become a heritage town, and further support from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. ==History== Founded in 1571 by Gat Tayaw, the small town of Liliw is nestled at the foot of Mount Banahaw, away from Santa Cruz, Laguna's capital. According to a story, Liliw got its name from a bird. It was said that Gat Tayaw and his followers decided to erect a bamboo pole and to name the town after the bird that would first alight at the top of the pole within four days. A crow, however, was the first bird to alight on the pole. A crow was considered bad and so Gat Tayaw and his men moved south and erected another bamboo pole. A beautiful bird alighted on the pole and sang, \"Liw, Liw, Liw\". Thus the town became Liliw. Throughout the Spanish regime, the name Liliw was used. When the Americans came, it became Lilio since the Americans found it easier to pronounce it than Liliw. However, on June 11, 1965, the municipal council passed Resolution No. 38-S-65 which declared Liliw as the official name and spelling of the town. This was to avoid confusion in pronouncing and spelling the name of the town. ==Barangays== Liliw is politically subdivided into 33 barangays. * Bagong Anyo (Poblacion) * Bayate * Bongkol * Bubukal * Cabuyew * Calumpang * Culoy * Dagatan * Daniw * Dita * Ibabang Palina * Ibabang San Roque * Ibabang Sungi * Ibabang Taykin * Ilayang Palina * Ilayang San Roque * Ilayang Sungi * Ilayang Taykin * Kanlurang Bukal * Laguan * Luquin * Malabo-Kalantukan * Masikap (Poblacion) * Maslun (Poblacion) * Mojon * Novaliches * Oples * Pag-asa (Poblacion) * Palayan * Rizal (Poblacion) * San Isidro * Silangang Bukal * Tuy-Baanan ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Liliw was people, with a density of . ==Transportation== Tricycles and jeepneys are popular modes of transportation in Liliw.

Liliw is known for its baroque style church whose fa\u00e7ade is made of striking red bricks. Known as St. John the Baptist church, its first church was built in wood in 1620. The stronger stone church was built from 1643 to 1646. The present church patio has been developed to promote Catholic teachings. Standing in front of the church are several elevated statues of different saints that are patrons of each of the town\u2019s barangays (villages). Standing next to the municipal hall is the statue of Gat Tayaw. On Gat Tayaw and P. Burgos streets still stand the ancestral houses of many of Liliw\u2019s prominent families who got rich during the American time from agricultural products like copra, lanzones, banana, and vegetables like tomatoes and mustasa. Liliw also has many natural attractions like the Kilangin Falls and the colds springs of Batis ng Liliw and Liliw Resort. But the town\u2019s main attraction is its growing footwear industry. It started in 1931 when Casiano Pisuena became interested in making slippers. His first prototype was made from coconut husk and rubber from tire interiors. He soon became successful and many residents of Liliw followed suit. At present there are about 50 stores selling footwear in Liliw. The regular slippers are still the most popular, but many stores are now selling shoes, handbags and other leather goods. Most stores still carry the three-for-P100 slippers. The annual Tsinelas Festival is celebrated every end of April. ==Gallery== Image:Church of Liliw, Facade.jpg|Saint John the Baptist Parish Church File:Liliwjf5832 06.JPG|Liliw town hall File:Liliwjf5800 05.JPG|Poblacion File:Liliw,Lagunajf5701 08.JPG|Tsinelas Capital of the Philippines ==References== ==External links== * Liliw Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * 1995 Philippine Census Information * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Laguna (province) Category:Populated places established in 1571 Category:1571 establishments in the Philippines ",
