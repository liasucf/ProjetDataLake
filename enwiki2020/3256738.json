In March 2006, the single was certified gold by RIAA and has sold over 500,000 copies in all formats in the United States. As of February 2010, \"Walk Away\" has sold over 1.1 million digital copies in the U.S.Moss, Corey. \"Bonus SoundScan numbers for Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, more!\". USA TODAY. February 14, 2006. ==Background== Clarkson called \"Walk Away\" \"one of the brighter songs\" on Breakaway, and said that \"It's just one of those anthem songs where everybody is [bouncing their heads] in the car.\"Moss, Corey. \"Kelly Clarkson Eyeing Black Eyed Peas For New Album\". MTV News. February 14, 2006. She said of its subject matter, \"the whole song is just about if it's not working out, then just leave, don't stay and make it worse.\" After spawning 4 major top 10 singles (\"Breakaway,\" \"Since U Been Gone,\" \"Behind These Hazel Eyes,\" and \"Because of You\") and spending 60 weeks in the top 20 of the Billboard albums chart, Clarkson released \"Walk Away\" as the fifth single. ==Composition== \"Walk Away\" was written by Clarkson, Chantal Kreviazuk, Raine Maida and Kara DioGuardi and produced by Maida, DioGuardi and Kreviazuk. It is one of 5 collaborations with Kara DioGuardi from the album and the first to be released as a single. DioGuardi had become one of the most sought songwriter/producers after playing key roles on hits from Ashlee Simpson's \"Pieces of Me\" to Lindsay Lohan's \"Confessions of a Broken Heart.\" For additional insurance Canadian couple Chantal Kreviazuk and Raine Maida, frequent Avril Lavigne collaborators, assisted on \"Walk Away.\" Tense guitars open the song, setting a cross tone. In \"Walk Away,\" Clarkson's relationship with her boyfriend seemed to be sunk at the start. With his family conspiring against them and aiding in his deceptions, there was no way it was going to work. Clarkson's hurt not only stems from his indifference to her, but his family's animosity towards her. \"You've got your mother and your brother/ Every other undercover/ Tellin' you what to say/\", she sings. In the chorus, he asks her whether or not they should continue dating: \"I'm looking for attention/ Not another question/ Should you stay or should you go?/ Well, if you don't have the answer/ Why you still standin' here?/ Hey, hey, hey, hey/Just walk away.\" In the second verse, she says that he stood up her plenty of evenings. However, each time she believed he would be there. After the chorus is the heated bridge. Clarkson says she wants a relationship where the guy loves her as passionately as she does him. She wants a lover who will support her, not disappear when she needs him the most. She asks if he thinks the relationship is worth fighting for. \"I wanna love/ I want a fire/ To feel the burn/ My desires/ I wanna man by my side/ Not a boy who runs and hides/ Are you gonna fight for me?/ Die for me?/ Live and breathe for me?/ Do you care for me?/ 'Cause if you don't then just leave,\" she sings. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that \"[...] Clarkson vocals fiery and smoldering. She's come a long way from American Idol where she had the sing songs technically perfect with the emotion optional. However, in the single, she unleashes whatever anger she felt from a past breakup and puts it in the song.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it \"driving, anthemic pop tune\" and picked it as one of the album's best tracks. Robert Christgau named it a \"prefab kissoff\". Charles Merwin from Stylus Magazine wrote that \"Luckily, songs like 'Breakaway' and 'Walk Away' are good enough to make you forget about some disappointments on the album.\" On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the song at number 20 in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time. ===Chart performance=== concert tours, as it is one of her most popular songs. \"Walk Away\" debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number 97Clover Hope, \"Nelly Nabs Fourth Hot 100 No. 1\", Billboard.com, January 12, 2006. on the chart dated January 21, 2006. \"Walk Away\" became Breakaway's first release to fail to achieve top 10 status on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 12.
