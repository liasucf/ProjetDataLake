It runs between Machrihanish near the southern end of the peninsula's west coast, and Tarbert at the northern end of Kintyre where the peninsula is linked to Knapdale, via Campbeltown. The way is long, and is fully waymarked. Additionally there are distance markers at intervals along the route. The route is primarily intended for walkers, but most sections can also be cycled. The Kintyre Way is designated as one of Scotland's Great Trails by NatureScot. It can be linked to another one of the Great Trails via Tarbert, where there is a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service to Portavadie, which is the start/finish point of the Cowal Way.Ordnance Survey. 1:50000 Landranger Sheet 62.
