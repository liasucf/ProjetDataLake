    "text": "Caretakers Cottage is an Australian non-profit, non-governmental organisation based in Sydney assisting children and young adults facing homelessness. Caretakers Cottage is funded by the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services to provide services for young people across Sydney's South- Eastern district. Services include short-term, emergency accommodation, semi- independent living options, case support and early intervention for young people at risk of homelessness.Rapana, Jessica. \"Smoking Ceremony for Homeless Program.\" Wentworth Courier. Fairfax Media. 20 May 2015. The early formation of the organisation began in 1972 with the establishment of a teen drop-in centre. The refuge began informally accommodating young people from 1975, and Caretakers Cottage was formally established in 1977 as the Paddington Woollahra Youth Service (PWYS), making it one of the first youth refuges in New South Wales. The organisation has assisted thousands of young people from across Sydney, including many from Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, and an estimated one third of young people assisted are of Aboriginal heritage. ==History== ===1972: The Club=== The roots of Caretakers Cottage begin in 1972 when Laurie Matthews and family founded a drop in centre for teens called \"The Club.\" The centre was supported by just $40 a week, in collaboration with the Holdsworth Community Centre, helping to support youth in the Eastern Suburbs.\"Our History.\" Our History. Caretakers Cottage. Accessed 3 March 2016. ===1975-1977: Informal accommodation and later founding=== In 1975, the Matthews family begin to informally accommodate youth at a property owned by the Oxford Street Uniting Church in Paddington, where Laurie Matthews' father, Reverend Rex Matthews, served as a minister.\"Gwenneth Matthews Notice.\" Sydney Morning Herald. 14 October 2014. Accessed 10 June 2015.Berryman, Nancy. \"Reverend Rex Battling On.\" The Sydney Morning Herald. 2 November 1980. Fairfax Media. The Matthews family lived in a home owned by the parish and the original refuge was in a smaller caretaker's cottage located on the premises, hence the refuge's present name. The refuge began as a place for young people coming from the country to stay while they found work and accommodation. Laurie Matthews first ran the refuge out of his own pocket, and after two years, it became one of the first youth refuges in New South Wales to receive funding from Department of Family and Community Services. After receiving government funding, the refuge then moved into the main house where the Matthews family had previously lived.Howe, Megan. \"Paddington Youth Refuge Faces The Threat Of Eviction.\" Sydney Morning Herald. Fairfax Media. 10 November 1988. In 1977, Caretakers began receiving funding from the New South Wales Department of Family Community Services (FaCS).The department was then known as the Department of Youth and Community Services (DoYCS). During these early years, however, most of the funding for Caretakers Cottage came from the parish's Village Church centre. The refuge was run by Laurie and his wife Sara, who worked for little and often no pay.Berryman, Nancy. \"Couple Run a Refuge for Teenagers.\" The Sun Herald. 29 July 1979 The organisation was incorporated that year under the name Paddington Woollahra Youth Service (PWYS). By 1980, the refuge had moved from the caretaker's cottage to the parsonage and Reverend Rex Matthews allowed the cottage to house an experiential program, funded by local council, allowing old people to live there independently, in the refuge's place. Through its informal start and subsequent founding, Caretakers founded one of the first youth refuges in New South Wales. Other early refuges include Young People's Refuge (now an all- female refuge), founded in 1975,\"About Us.\" Detour House Inc.

Coulter, in 1984, the Caretakers Cottage youth refuge in Paddington was linked to a volunteer \u201cextended family group\u201d at Eastern House, which was next door to the refuge. The members of the family were two parents (Reverend Rex Matthews & his wife Gwenneth Matthews), a 15-year-old sister, 18-year-old brother and a female and male university student.Matthews, P., Maler, D., Fulford, M. & Coulter, D. 1984, A History of Caretakers Cottage, unpublished, Youth Accommodation Association Archives/Caretakers Cottage, Sydney.Coffey, Michael.

April 2014. ===Move to Surry Hills=== After 15 years of the organisation being centered in Paddington, Caretakers Cottage moved to Surry Hills. The move was preceded by an eviction notice from the Uniting Church who owned the property housing the Caretakers Cottage youth refuge. The New South Wales Department of Housing provided funding for the organisation to purchase a new property, however, the organisation was forced to leave Paddington as a result of the shortage of large family homes available for sale in the area. ===Move to Bondi=== Caretakers Cottage moved from Surry Hills to Bondi, where it is currently headquartered. In 2014, the Caretakers Crisis Refuge in Bondi underwent renovations and received the support of Gumtree Roadshow, a corporate social responsibility project by Gumtree Australia, having stylists assist in the refurnishing and redecorating.\"Redecorating on a Budget.\" Gumtree. 10 November 2014.
