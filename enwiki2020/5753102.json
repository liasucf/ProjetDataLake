    "text": "Table game is the term used to distinguish games of chance such as blackjack, craps, roulette and baccarat that are played against the casino and operated by one or more live croupiers, from those performed on a mechanical device like a slot machine or games played against other players instead of the casino such as standard poker. They are popularly played in casinos and involve some form of legal gambling, but also are played privately by varying house rules. The term has significance in that some jurisdictions permit casinos to have only slots and no table games. In some states, this law has resulted in casinos employing electronic table games, such as roulette, blackjack, and craps. == List of table games == === Cards === * Baccarat * Blackjack * Caribbean stud poker * Casino war * Faro * Flop Poker * Four Card Poker * Let It Ride * Mississippi Stud * Pai gow poker * Certain variants of poker * Red Dog * Spanish 21 * Teen Patti * Three Card Poker * Tempeln * Trente et Quarante === Dice / tiles === * Chuck-a-luck * Craps * Pai Gow * Sic bo * Kauda === Random numbers === * Big Six wheel * Roulette === Other === * Fan-Tan * Two-up == See also == * Casino game * Tabletop games == References == Category:Casinos Category:Tabletop games ",
