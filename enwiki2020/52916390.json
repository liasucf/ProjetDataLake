    "text": "140px Allasch is a variety of K\u00fcmmel, a caraway liqueur of around 40% ABV, usually flavoured with bitter almonds, anise, angelica root and orange peel. Invented in 1823 in Allasch, Russian Empire (now in Latvia), a von Blanckenhagen family property, it was widely popular and produced there until 1944 when the Soviet Union re-occupied Latvia and expelled ethnic Germans from the region. In 1830, Allasch was exhibited at the Leipzig Trade Fair and quickly gained popularity, being soon produced by local distilleries. It is now considered a Leipzig specialty, usually drunk as a digestif, although there are also manufacturers outside Leipzig. In Latvia, it is still produced under the name \"Alla\u017eu \u0137imelis\" (Alla\u017ei k\u00fcmmel). ==See also== * ==References== Category:Liqueurs Category:Herbal liqueurs ",
