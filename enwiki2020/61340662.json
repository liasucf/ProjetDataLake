    "text": "Connor Ellis (born 12 May 1997) is a professional footballer who is currently a free agent, having left Limerick F.C. in June 2019. A former youth international for the Republic of Ireland, he previously played for Cork City where he was part of their League of Ireland Premier Division and FAI Cup double-winning team of 2017. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Birmingham, England, Ellis moved to Cork, Republic of Ireland at the age of 12 and played at underage level for his local club Bantry Bay Rovers. ===Cork City U19s=== Ellis was spotted by Cork City and signed for their Under-19 squad in October 2013, aged 16. Ellis scored his first competitive goal against Drogheda United in Bishopstown the following month and would go on to be prolific at Under-19 level, scoring 46 times in 51 games. In his first season, 2013/14, he scored 11 goals, including his first hat-trick for Cork in a 6-0 win over UCD in February 2014. In April 2015, he was named in the League of Ireland Under-19 Team of the Year. It was a 2014/15 season where Ellis had scored 16 goals in 18 games. Ellis scored 14 goals in just 15 games in a shortened 2015 season, which ended with Cork lifting the Under-19 National League trophy after defeating Limerick in the final at the Markets Field. Ellis scored and was awarded the official Man of the Match award in the decider. The Under-19 2016 season coincided with Ellis\u2019 educational commitments as he focussed on his Leaving Certificate, but he still managed to score five goals in five appearances, before making a loan move to Cobh Ramblers. ===Cork City=== On 18 July 2015, Ellis made his first-team debut for Cork City when coming off the bench in a 4-1 win at Longford Town. On 21 July 2015, Ellis was allocated a first-team squad number (17) for the first time. On 12 July 2016, Cork rewarded Ellis for his performances with his first professional contract at the club. Cork manager John Caulfield remarked: \u201cConnor is one of our bright lights, we have great time for him. He has great attributes; he has his feet on the ground and he is working really hard to make the step up and he is showing all the hallmarks that he can do so.\u201d ====Cobh Ramblers (Loan)==== To gain senior experience, Ellis was sent on-loan to First Division Cork-based side Cobh Ramblers on 22 July 2016. He struck four goals in 10 league appearances as he helped Ramblers to the First Division promotion playoffs. Ellis also scored in the playoffs against Drogheda United, but Cobh lost the tie. In the FAI Cup, Ellis netted two goals in two appearances for Ramblers, including in their defeat at top-flight Saint Patrick\u2019s Athletic. ===Cork City=== For the 2017 season, Ellis returned to Cork City. In the season\u2019s curtain-raiser, the President's Cup final, he played in a 3-0 win over 2016 double-winners Dundalk. Due to the scintillating form of future Republic of Ireland and Preston North End striker Sean Maguire, then 19-year-old Ellis was used mainly as a substitute \u2013 totalling 17 league appearances from the bench. He was part of the matchday squad for all four of Cork\u2019s UEFA Europa League games, in ties against Levadia Tallinn (Estonia) and AEK Larnaca (Cyprus). Ellis scored on his only FAI Cup start that year, twice in a 7-0 win over Athlone Town. Cork went on to win the country\u2019s national cup competition on penalties against Dundalk. Overall that year \u2013 as Cork claimed the Premier Division and FAI Cup double \u2013 Ellis scored five goals from limited minutes in 26 appearances in all competitions. ===Limerick=== Having attracted interest from a number of clubs, Ellis \u2013 in search of more regular first-team football \u2013 opted to sign for another Premier Division club, Limerick F.C., on a two-year contract in January 2018. While only signing the deal in January, Ellis had caught the attention of former Newcastle United and Everton defender Neil McDonald, who had left Limerick in the intervening period to take up a coaching position in the UK. Ellis made his league debut for Limerick against Bohemians at the Markets Field on 24 February 2018. Troubled by a hip injury early in the campaign, the striker returned from the midseason break in excellent form and scored his first club goal against Derry City at The Brandywell Stadium on 6 July. He also netted an important goal in a win over Bray Wanderers on 21 September to seal Limerick\u2019s place in the playoffs. There, they lost to Finn Harps, which saw the club demoted to the First Division. Despite offers to remain in the top flight, Ellis stayed with Limerick to aid their promotion push. He scored six goals and won the supporters\u2019 club Player of the Month for March, before the club\u2019s well- documented financial crisis forced Ellis to depart ==International career== Ellis has represented the Republic of Ireland at Under-15, Under-17, Under-18 and Under-19 level, as well as Under-18 Schoolboys. In June 2015, Ellis scored in a 1-0 win for the Irish Under-18s just six minutes after coming off the bench against Luxembourg. In March 2016, Ellis was honoured with the prestigious FAI Schools International Player of the Year award. The award had come after Ellis had helped Ireland to win the 2015 Centenary Shield. The striker scored twice in the 3-2 win over Northern Ireland and also netted a goal in the 1-1 draw away to Scotland. The three winners of the award prior to Ellis were Alan Browne, Sean Maguire and Ryan Manning. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Cork City |2017 |2017 Premier Division |20||2||2||2||3||1||1||0||26||5 |- |2016 |2016 Premier Division |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2015 |2015 Premier Division |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=3|Total !21!!2!!2!!2!!3!!1!!1!!0!!27!!5 |- |Cobh Ramblers (loan) |2016 |2016 First Division |12||5||2||2||0||0||0||0||14||7 |- !colspan=3|Total !12!!5!!2!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!14!!7 |- |rowspan=3|Limerick |2019 |2019 First Division |15||6||0||0||1||0||0||0||16||6 |- |2018 |2018 Premier Division |24||2||2||1||1||0||0||0||27||3 |- !colspan=2|Total !39!!8!!2!!1!!2!!0!!0!!0!!43!!9 |- !colspan=3|Career total !72!!15!!6!!5!!5!!1!!1!!0!!84!!21 |} ==Honours== League of Ireland: 1 * Cork City \u2013 2017 FAI Cup: 1 * Cork City \u2013 2017 President's Cup: 1 * Cork City \u2013 2017 Munster Senior Cup: 1 * Cork City \u2013 2017 Individual * Republic of Ireland Under-18 Schools International Player of the Year: 2015 == References == Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Association football forwards Category:Limerick F.C. players Category:Cork City F.C. players Category:Republic of Ireland youth international footballers Category:Cobh Ramblers F.C. players ",
