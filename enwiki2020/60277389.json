While Juan de Dios Conde was mayor, Antonio Albizu, together with Juan Rond\u00f3n performed as \"teniente alcalde\". Also working closely with Albizu were Juan Pablo Aponte (regidor decano, known today as president of the municipal council), and six council members: Valentin Tricoche, Geronimo Rabassa, Pablo Manfredi, Jose Ortiz de la Renta, Fernando Matute, and Luis Font. Additional personnel at the ayuntamiento were Luciano Ortiz de la Renta, procurador del com\u00fan (a sort of townspeople representative), and Javier de Solis (Council clerk). The ayuntamiento did not meet in a public building during these early beginnings, but was organized under Puerto Rico governor Miguel de la Torre to meet at the house of a notable local citizen, Domingo Ar\u00e9valo.Eduardo Neumann Gand\u00eda.
