    "text": "A young Kintar\u014d battling a giant carp, in a print by Yoshitoshi. is a folk hero from Japanese folklore. A child of superhuman strength, he was raised by a yama-uba (\"mountain witch\") on Mount Ashigara. He became friendly with the animals of the mountain, and later, after catching Shuten-d\u014dji, the terror of the region around Mount \u014ce, he became a loyal follower of Minamoto no Yorimitsu under the new name . He is a popular figure in Bunraku and kabuki drama, and it is a custom to put up a Kintar\u014d doll on Boy's Day in the hope that boys will become equally brave and strong. Kintar\u014d is supposedly based on a real person, Sakata Kintoki, who lived during the Heian period and probably came from what is now the city of Minamiashigara, Kanagawa. He served as a retainer for the samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu and became well known for his abilities as a warrior. As with many larger-than-life individuals, his legend has grown with time. ==Legend== Several competing stories tell of Kintar\u014d's childhood. In one, he was raised by his mother, Princess Yaegiri, daughter of a wealthy man named Shiman-ch\u014dja, in the village of Jizodo, near Mount Ashigara. In a competing legend, his mother gave birth to him in what is now Sakata, Yamagata. She was forced to flee, however, due to fighting between her husband, a samurai named Sakata, and his uncle. She finally settled in the forests of Mount Ashigara to raise her son. Alternatively, Kintar\u014d's real mother left the child in the wilds or died and left him an orphan, and he was raised by a yama-uba or \"mountain witch\" (one tale says Kintar\u014d's mother raised him in the wilds, but due to her haggard appearance, she came to be called yama-uba). In the most fanciful version of the tale, the yama-uba was Kintar\u014d's mother, impregnated by a clap of thunder sent from a red dragon of Mount Ashigara. The legends agree that even as a toddler, Kintar\u014d was active and indefatigable, plump and ruddy, wearing only a bib with the kanji for \"gold\" (\u91d1) on it. His only other accoutrement was a hatchet (ono or masakari). He was bossy to other children (or there simply were no other children in the forest), so his friends were mainly the animals of Mt. Kintoki and Mt. Ashigara. He was also phenomenally strong, able to smash rocks into pieces, uproot trees, and bend trunks like twigs. His animal friends served him as messengers and mounts, and some legends say that he even learned to speak their language. Several tales tell of Kintar\u014d's adventures, fighting monsters and oni (demons), beating bears in sumo wrestling, and helping the local woodcutters fell trees. Oniwakamaru and the Giant Carp Fight Underwater by Utagawa Kuniyoshi, 1835, Brooklyn Museum As an adult, Kintar\u014d changed his name to Sakata no Kintoki. He met the samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu as he passed through the area around Mt. Kintoki. Yorimitsu was impressed by Kintar\u014d's enormous strength, so he took him as one of his personal retainers to live with him in Kyoto.Piggott, J. (1997). Japanese Mythology. London: Chancellor Press. Kintoki studied martial arts there and eventually became the chief of Yorimitsu's Shitenn\u014d (\"four braves\"), renowned for his strength and martial prowess. He eventually went back for his mother and brought her to Kyoto as well. ==In modern Japan== Kintar\u014d is an extremely popular figure in Japan, and his image adorns everything from statues to storybooks, anime, manga to action figures. For example, the manga and anime Golden Boy stars a character with the same name. Kintar\u014d as an image is characterized with an ono, a haragake apron, and sometimes a tame bear. In many of Kintar\u014d's pictures, it seems that he is trying to capture a giant black koi. This seems to glorify his strength as he is able to wrestle with such creature. Kintar\u014d candy has been around since the Edo period; no matter how the cylinder-shaped candy is cut, Kintar\u014d's face appears inside. Japanese tradition is to decorate the room of a newborn baby boy with Kintar\u014d dolls on Children's Day (May 5) so that the child will grow up to be strong like the Golden Boy. A shrine dedicated to the folk hero lies at the foot of Mount Ashigara in the Hakone area near Tokyo. Nearby is a giant boulder that was supposedly chopped in half by the boy hero himself.
