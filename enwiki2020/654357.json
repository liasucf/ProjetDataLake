Retrieved 16 April 2015. His case was still awaiting trial a year later when his name appeared in the Panama Papers. Despite his prior assurances that he did not own companies in tax havens, apparently he used two offshore companies to avoid taxes on millions of euros kept overseas. It has been alleged that he owes taxes to both the Spanish and Panamanian governments. On 23 February 2017, Rato was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to 4\u00bd years' imprisonment. In September 2018, the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Spain., and Rato entered prison on 25 October 2018.Rodrigo Rato ingresa en la prisi\u00f3n de Soto del Real: \"Pido perd\u00f3n a la sociedad\" Ex-IMF head Rodrigo Rato starts jail term in 'black cards' case ==Early life and education== Rodrigo de Rato was born in Madrid, into a rich textile-owning family from Asturias. He is the great-grandson of politician Faustino Rodr\u00edguez-San Pedro y D\u00edaz-Arg\u00fcelles and the son of businessman Ram\u00f3n Rato who was jailed in 1967 for tax evasion to Switzerland through his Banco Siero,El \u00fanico que dijo 'no' a la tarjeta black, Francisco Verd\u00fa. .

Both the Rato and the Figaredo sides of his family owned industries and nobility titles.\u00abFallece Aurora Figaredo, la madre de Rodrigo Rato, a los 90 a\u00f1os.\u00bb La Voz de Asturias.Fondos Familia Figaredo (Real Instituto de Estudios Asturianos). Rato attended a Jesuit school before studying law in the Complutense University. In 1971 Rato went to University of California, Berkeley, and received an MBA in 1974 from the Haas School of Business. ==Career== ===Early beginnings=== In 1975 Rato became involved in the family business, first in Fuensanta, an Asturian mineral water company, and then in two Madrid construction firms. He also became involved in expanding the Cadena Rato chain of radio stations. In 1977 Rato joined the newly formed Popular Alliance (AP), a party containing former ministers of Franco, founded by Manuel Fraga, a close personal friend of his father. In December 1979 Rato was elected to the national executive committee, and became secretary of the AP economic commission. In February 1981 he became one of the party's five Secretaries-General, and was considered to be their economic expert. He supported tight controls on public spending, and an emphasis on the supply side of economics. In October 1982 he won election as an AP member of the Congress of Deputies for C\u00e1diz in spite of having no connection to this Andalucian town. He represented the area until 1989 and subsequently represented Madrid from 1989 to 2000. The 1982 election handed a loss to the AP, and marked the beginning of the long rule of the PSOE and Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez. Until 1984 Rato was the Secretary of the parliamentary group. He then became their economic affairs spokesman where he impressed the party with his attacks on the PSOE's economic policies. He was seen to be on the liberal wing of the party. When Fraga resigned from the leadership in December 1986 Rato backed Miguel Herrero y Rodr\u00edguez de Mi\u00f1\u00f3n who lost the leadership race to Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez Mancha, but managed to keep his positions within the party. During these years he also continued his business career in Aguas de Fuensanta; having previously been the CEO of the company from 1978 to 1982, he served as chairman from 1985 to 1991. In June 1989 Fraga again became interim President after the generally acknowledged failure of the leadership of Hern\u00e1ndez Mancha. The party became the slightly more inclusive People's Party (PP). Rato was given shared responsibility over the elections with Francisco \u00c1lvarez- Cascos Fern\u00e1ndez, the new party Secretary General. He was a close supporter of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, who was voted as the new PP leader on 4 September. On 29 October, the PP lost the general election, though his role in the campaign gave him national prominence. Afterwards he was appointed party spokesman. On 2 April 1990 his father sold the family stake in Cadena Rato for 5 billion pesetas. In June 1991 he stopped being President of Fuensanta, but remained on the board until 1993. On 6 June that year the PP lost another general election to PSOE. In the 12th National Congress in January 1996 he was confirmed as one of the three vice secretaries of the party. ===Minister of Economy and vice president=== Then on 3 March 1996 the PP won the general election. On 4 May Aznar became Prime Minister of Spain, and on 6 May Rato became both second Vice President and Minister of Economy and Finance. On 12 March 2000 the PP won again, this time with an absolute majority. His ministries were reorganised, and he gave all his responsibilities to Crist\u00f3bal Montoro Romero who became Minister of Finance. In his second term he had to fend off various charges of incompatibility between his public office and his private business interests. ===Managing Director of the IMF=== Rodrigo Rato meeting with The Republic of Zambia's President H. E Levy Mwanawasa (16 March 2006) Rato became the managing director of the IMF on 7 June 2004, taking over from Anne Krueger, who had been acting as temporary Managing Director after Horst K\u00f6hler, who at that time was nominated (and later elected) President of Germany, resigned the post 4 March 2004. In June 2007 Rato announced that he would resign from his post the following October, citing personal reasons. On 28 September 2007, the International Monetary Fund's 24 executive directors elected former French Minister for Economics, Finance, and Industry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, over former Czech Prime Minister Josef To\u0161ovsk\u00fd, to be the new managing director in succession to Rato. ==Career in the private sector== ===Bankia=== Rato assumed the presidency of Caja Madrid in 2010, a public savings bank based in the Community of Madrid, and after a merger with other six saving banks he assumed the presidency of the new group now called Bankia. On 7 May 2012, he resigned amid growing concerns about the solvency of the bank. Although the core capital ratio was 10,4%, the Popular Party Government planned to lend about 8 billion euro to the bank to increase its solvency, as was done before throughout Europe (e.g. ING and Northern Rock crisis). Due to his political ties to the governing PP, which decided to inject the funds, Rato resigned. He had his salary cut from \u20ac2.3 million to \u20ac600,000 annually in 2011 due to new laws for rescued banks. ===Other activities=== * International Airlines Group (IAG), Member of the Board of DirectorsBoard of Directors International Airlines Group (IAG). * Mapfre, Member of the Board of Directors (2010\u20132012) ==Legal issues== On 4 July 2012, Rato, along with 30 other former members of the board of directors of Bankia, were charged with accounting irregularities. Bloomberg Businessweek listed Rato as the worst CEO in 2012. In 2011, Bankia had announced profits of \u20ac309 million; after Rato resigned, the figure was amended to \u20ac3 billion in losses. In October 2014, it became known that between 24 October 2010 to 28 November 2011, Rato made 519 purchases with a secret corporate credit card, spending a total of \u20ac99,041. Among these purchases he spent in one day were \u20ac3,547 in alcoholic beverages and \u20ac1,000 in shoes, along with 16 cash withdrawals of more than \u20ac1,000, most of them during the last months of his presidential term. After a hearing 17 October 2014, the Spanish High Court judge Fernando Andreu assigned civil responsibility for the credit card abuse to Rodrigo Rato and Miguel Blesa. Rato was ordered to pay a bond of \u20ac3 million, and was expelled from the People's Party (PP).El PP da de baja a Rato y a los 12 militantes de las tarjetas opacas. El Pa\u00eds (27 October 2014). The case went to court in 2016. On 23 February 2017, Rato was convicted and sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 2020, the High Court acquitted Rato in a separate trial over falsifying accounts and other charges in the listing of Bankia when he was the bank\u2019s chairman. It later granted him a semi-release which allowd him to serve the rest of his sentence in partial liberty.Jes\u00fas Aguado and Emma Pinedo (October 1, 2020), Former IMF chief Rato to leave Spanish prison on semi- release from embezzlement sentence Reuters. ==References== ==External links== *IMF biography *Meet the New Head of the IMF \u2013 Who Is Rodrigo Rato? *Guardian article on his appointment *Biography by CIDOB (in Spanish) *Rodrigo de Rato's Project Syndicate op/eds Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People from Madrid Category:People's Party (Spain) politicians Category:Complutense University of Madrid alumni Category:Economy and finance ministers of Spain Category:Managing directors of the International Monetary Fund Category:Haas School of Business alumni Category:Members of the 2nd Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 3rd Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 4th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 5th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 6th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 7th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 8th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of Spain Category:People named in the Panama Papers Category:Politicians convicted of embezzlement Category:Spanish politicians convicted of crimes Category:Spanish prisoners and detainees Category:Spanish officials of the United Nations Category:Directors of Bankia ",
