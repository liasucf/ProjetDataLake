It is named after the current king of Morocco. The bridge is characterised by its architecture comprising two 200-meters high arched towers, which symbolize the new doors to the cities of Rabat and Sal\u00e9. The deck is supported by two sets of 20 pairs of parallel multi-strand stay cables. The structure forms part of the new 41.5 km Rabat motorway bypass around the city of Rabat and will improve traffic congestion in Hay Riad, the capital's western residential suburb. ==See also== *Rabat Ring Road *List of highest bridges in the world *List of tallest bridges in the world ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Rabat Category:Cable-stayed bridges Category:Bridges completed in 2016 ",
