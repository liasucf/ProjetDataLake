Cochran talked about problems ahead for a city that was creative and fun, but growing so fast that it could become big and bland. \"He was talking about issues we are still talking about today, nearly a decade later, as Austin has grappled with change. He had actually thought about real issues that were facing the city, and not all of his ideas were particularly out there. He certainly wasn't the craziest person I ever dealt with running for office, by a long shot.\" If elected, Cochran promised to plant more trees and wear more conservative dresses to \"respect the office.\"\"Austin's cross- dressing, often homeless icon dies\" Associated Press, March 8, 2012.
