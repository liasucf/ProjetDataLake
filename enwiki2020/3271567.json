    "text": "Cr\u00fce Ball is a 1992 pinball video game developed by American studio NuFX and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Genesis. Themed to glam metal band M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, it features three of their songs: \"Dr. Feelgood,\" \"Live Wire,\" and \"Home Sweet Home.\" The game's prototype name was Twisted Flipper. The producer of the game, Richard Robbins, initially pursued the name Headbangers Ball, but MTV balked at a license and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was added relatively late in development. This game was designed by Mark Sprenger (artist for Space Shuttle, High Speed, and Diner) and Brian L. Schmidt (composer for Space Station and Black Knight 2000). ==References== ==External links== * Cr\u00fce Ball at GameFAQs * Cr\u00fce Ball at Sega-16 * Encyclopedia Bombastica Video at Giant Bomb * * Category:1992 video games Category:Band-centric video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce Category:Musician video games Category:NuFX games Category:Pinball video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Genesis-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Brian L.
