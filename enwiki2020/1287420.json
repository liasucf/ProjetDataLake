    "text": "Six Memos for the Next Millennium () is a book based on a series of lectures written by Italo Calvino for the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, but never delivered as Calvino died before leaving Italy. The lectures were originally written in Italian and translated by Patrick Creagh. The lectures were to be given in the fall of 1985, and Memos was published in 1988. The memos are lectures on the values of literature that Calvino felt were important for the coming millennium. At the time of his death Calvino had finished all but the last lecture. ==The Memos== The values which Calvino highlights are: # Lightness # Quickness # Exactitude # Visibility # Multiplicity All that is known of the sixth lecture is that it was to be on consistency. ==External links== * Six Memos for the Next Millennium (Google Books) * Six Memos for the Next Millennium, Harvard University Press, Category:1988 non-fiction books Category:Italian non-fiction books Category:Books of literary criticism Category:Unfinished books Category:20th- century Italian literature Category:Books of lectures ",
