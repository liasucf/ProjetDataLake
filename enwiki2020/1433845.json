    "text": "Royal Charleroi Sporting Club, often simply known as Charleroi or Sporting Charleroi, is a Belgian football club based in the city of Charleroi, in the province of Hainaut. Charleroi plays in the Belgian Pro League and their current spell at the highest level in Belgian football has started in the 2012\u201313 season. Charleroi was founded in 1904 and they first reached the first division in 1947\u201348. Their highest finish was runner-up in the 1968\u201369 season. They have also twice reached the Belgian Cup final, losing in 1977\u201378 to Beveren and in 1992\u201393 to Standard Li\u00e8ge. Sporting Charleroi have a long- standing rivalry with their crosstown rival ROC de Charleroi-Marchienne, currently playing in the third division. Charleroi play their home matches at the Stade du Pays de Charleroi, which was refurbished for the UEFA Euro 2000. The stadium hosted 3 group stage games in the Euro 2000 among which the 1\u20130 victory of England against Germany. Charleroi have been recruiting several French players in recent years, including Micha\u00ebl Ciani, Cyril Th\u00e9r\u00e9au and goalkeeper Bertrand Laquait. ==History== Charleroi Sporting Club was founded in 1904 and they received the matricule n\u00b022. Twenty years after their foundation, they qualified to play in the Promotion (then the second level in Belgian football) and in 1929, the club changed its name to Royal Charleroi Sporting Club. Rivals from Olympic Charleroi were playing in the first division in the late 1930s and the 1940s, while Sporting Charleroi was playing one level down, until they promoted in 1947. In 1949, Sporting Charleroi finished 4th (2 points behind Standard Li\u00e8ge) whereas Olympic Charleroi was 14th. But Olympic took the lead again until 1955 and their relegation to the second division. At the end of the 1956\u201357 season, Olympic Charleroi had promoted to the first division but Sporting Charleroi finished last in the first division and was thus relegated to the second division. A spell of 9 seasons in the second division followed and in 1966\u201367 Sporting Charleroi was back at the top level. They finished at the second place in 1968\u201369 5 points behind Standard Li\u00e8ge but within two years they were relegated again. In 1974 the first division was changing from 16 to 20 teams and Sporting Charleroi was chosen to play at the top level. Olympic Charleroi promoted too as they had won the second division right before but they remained at the top level for just one season. Sporting underwent a new relegation in 1979\u201380 (17th on 18) but was back five years later. Their best result since then in the first division is a 4th place in 1993\u201394. In September 2005, the G-14 took FIFA to court over the eight-month injury incurred by Abdelmajid Oulmers whilst on international duty with Morocco. ==Colours and badge== The colours of Charleroi are black and white with a shirt generally striped, which led to the team being nicknamed The Zebras. ==Stadium== Stade du Pays de Charleroi The actual ground was baptized in 1939 with a match Sporting-Union du Centre and it was located near the coal mine named Mambourg. In 1985 the stadium was slightly modernized as the club had qualified for the first division. It was then heavily renewed in the late 1990s in view of the 2000 European Football Championship. The name changed on 24 May 1999 from Stade du Mambourg to Stade du Pays de Charleroi. During the tournament, the full capacity of the stadium was up to 30,000 seats. The Stade du Pays de Charleroi hosted notably the match between Germany and England. The highest stand was eventually reduced and the capacity is now 15,000.Het Stade du Pays de Charleroi sporting- charleroi.be (last check 30 March 2018) ==Honours== *Belgian First Division **Runners-up: 1968\u201369 *Belgian Second Division **Winners: 1946\u201347, 2011\u201312 **Runners-up: 1965\u201366 *Belgian Second Division play-offs **Winners: 1985 *Belgian Cup **Runners-up: 1977\u201378, 1992\u201393 ==European record== ===Overview=== Correct as of May 2016 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
