It is situated about north of Fitzroy Crossing and approximately east of Derby just off the Gibb River Road in the Kimberley region. The abundant water supply and multiple food sources of the area enabled Aboriginal peoples to develop a rich cultural life in the area. Examples of both Bradshaw and Wandjina artwork can be found on rock outcrops at the station. Gold prospector and explorer Frank Hann visited the area in 1898 and named Mount Elizabeth after his mother. Pioneer Frank Lacy drove a herd of cattle across the Kimberley and established the station in 1945. Both Lacy and his wife, Theresa, are buried near the homestead. The Lacy family has held the lease since 1945 and started offering accommodation to tourists in addition to rearing cattle in the 2000s. the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others in the Kimberley and Northern Territory.
