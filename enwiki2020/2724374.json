His nickname originates from when, as a teenager, he escaped several rival football fans by jumping into a polar bear pit. His extensive career dates back to an early World Series of Poker visit in 1985. However he first gained public notoriety by finishing runner-up in the \u00a3300 Pot Limit Hold-Em event at the Victoria Casino in London. He went on to become a regular on the Late Night Poker television series, being one of few players to appear in every series. His only win on the series was in his heat during series 3, where he defeated a field including Surinder Sunar and Pascal \"Triple P\" Perrault to get his seat in the Grand Final. He went on to finish 4th in the Final, which was eventually won by Phil Hellmuth Jr. Wilson's biggest win came in 1998, when he won the Carnival of Poker tournament at the Rio, taking home $171,000. In 2001, during the \u00a3300 Pot Limit Hold-Em tournament in Glasgow, Scotland he split the pot to take a \u00a37,500 share of the first prize. The next year he won the $150 Pot Limit Hold-Em tournament in Dundee, Scotland, which included a rare final table appearance by Late Night Poker commentator Nic Szeremeta. In 2004 he won the No Limit Hold-Em tournament at the Crown Australasian Poker Championship in Melbourne, defeating a final table including Peter \"The Poet\" Costa, \"Barmy\" Barny Boatman and \"Cowboy\" Kenna James.
