However, it is subject to inspection by Ofsted and is accountable to the Secretary of State for Education. Children who enter at age 4 are able to continue their school education until it ends at age 18 years. The school has separate Primary, Senior and Sixth Form sections. The main building is a former Victorian private house known as Elderslie. Founded in 1903 as the Holy Trinity Convent School by a group of Catholic nuns of the Trinitarian Sisters of Valence from France, it became secularised in 1985, and in 1986 it was renamed Holy Trinity School under the ownership of a group of parents who formed the Board of Trustees.Independent Schools Inspectorate Retrieved 15 September 2010 In 2014 Holy Trinity became a free school, and is now state-funded, and free to attend.
