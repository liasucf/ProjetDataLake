    "text": "Hattersley is an area of Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, west of Glossop and east of Manchester city centre at the eastern terminus of the M67. Historically part of Tintwistle Rural District in Cheshire until 1974, it is the site of an overspill estate built by Manchester City Council in the 1960s. Hattersley is an area receiving major regeneration which includes new properties and additional retail stores. Hattersley is served by train, Hattersley Station and via bus, with frequent services to Manchester City Centre via the 201 bus service. ==History== ===Construction of the estate=== Manchester in the 1960s Between 1894 and 1936, Hattersley was a largely rural civil parish in the Tintwistle Rural District in the historical county of Cheshire. In 1936, it was annexed to the municipal borough of Hyde but remained undeveloped. At the beginning of the 1960s, most of the area was purchased by Manchester City Council to build a large overspill estate, which became home to many families rehoused from inner-city slum areas like Gorton. Another similar estate was built in Gamesley. Both these estates consist primarily of council-built houses. ===Renewal and privatisation=== Regeneration in Hattersley is coordinated by Hattersley Neighbourhood Partnership. The city council transferred control of most of Hattersley's housing stock to Peak Valley Housing Association in 2006 after an attempt to transfer it to the Harvest Housing Group which collapsed when a \u00a320 million gap in funding to refurbish the homes to new housing standards was identified. The transfer brought a \u00a340 million, seven-year improvement plan for existing housing tied to a \u00a3140m investment from a private developer. Selective demolition has begun to remove some obsolete housing leaving space for redevelopment and investment in education and public services. Seven tower blocks were demolished in 2001. Demolition of some of the 1960s low-rise houses on the estate took place in 2007 and 2008, these houses having deteriorated to a condition where refurbishment was not viable, in spite of these houses being just over 40 years old. In 2012 a Tesco supermarket was opened, despite residents' concern about extra traffic. ==Moors Murders== Moors murderer Myra Hindley and her grandmother Ellen Maybury, together with Hindley's boyfriend Ian Brady, were rehoused in Hattersley from Gorton in 1964 and lived at a new council house in the area \u2013 16 Wardle Brook Avenue \u2013 for approximately 12 months until they Hindley and Brady were arrested in October 1965. Brady spent much of his time at the house with Hindley and together they carried out the killings of 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey and 17-year-old Edward Evans at the house; they had already committed three murders while living in Gorton. The body of Downey was buried on nearby Saddleworth Moor the day after her murder on Boxing Day 1964, It was found in the initial search of the moors nearly a year later, but the body of Edward Evans was found at the house in October 1965 before the couple could dispose of it; the police then found the evidence to link Brady and Hindley to the four earlier murders. In October 1987, Manchester City Council demolished the house as they could not find tenants willing to live there. The site of the house remains vacant, although the surrounding houses remain standing. ==Dale Cregan== On 18 September 2012, drug dealer Dale Cregan made a hoax emergency call to the police from an address in Hattersley, luring Police Constables Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, of Greater Manchester Police there by claiming that there had been an incident of criminal damage. When they arrived, he ambushed the constables, shooting them and throwing an M75 hand grenade at them. Both officers were hit by at least eight bullets as Cregan fired 32 shots in 31 seconds. He later turned himself in at Hyde police station and was charged with their murders. == Community and regeneration == Hattersley had a monthly community newspaper, the Hattersley & Mottram Community News, produced by local people. It ceased publication in 2011 after Tameside Council ended its funding. It is home to No 468 (Hyde and Hatterley) Squadron Air Cadets. Hattersley is now home to both a brand-new community hub and a library. These developments were key in kick-starting regeneration developments across the Hattersley district, which now include new housing developments, a large Tesco superstore, Total Adrenaline (a trampoline, Laser Quest and play centre) and future plans for a Hattersley Retail Park, estimated for completion in 2021. ==Notable people== *Ricky Hatton, the former two-weight world champion boxer, grew up on the estate. *Lisa Huo, brought up in Hattersley, was a contestant on Big Brother 7. *Shayne Ward, from Hattersley, was on The X Factor. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Longdendale ==References== Category:Geography of Tameside Category:Areas of Greater Manchester Category:Manchester overspill estates Category:History of Manchester Category:Hyde, Greater Manchester ",
