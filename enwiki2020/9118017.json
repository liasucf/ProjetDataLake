The carnivore assemblage of La Payunia Reserve, Patagonia, Argentina: dietary niche, prey availability, and selection. M.S. Thesis, University of Montana, Missoula, MT USA. http://www.cfc.umt.edu/grad/ICD/pdf/Berg_Jodi_Thesis.pdf Other mammals include a large rodent, the plains viscacha Lagostomus maximus, and the largest native animal on the reserve, the guanaco Lama guanicoe. A cooperative of around 20 families, Cooperativa Payun Matru, live on the reserve. They round up the wild guanaco every year and shear the animals for their fur.Cooperativa Payun Matru| http://www.payunmatru.com/project.html The annual round up is monitored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, and wool and yarn are exported abroad. == Geography == The area is covered by many small volcanoes, and the biggest are Pay\u00fan Matr\u00fa, Pay\u00fan Liso and Santa Mar\u00eda. Volcanic ash forms a black terrain known as Pampas Negras (Spanish: Black Pampas). The Grande River flows in the zone across volcanic rocks cracks. == References == == External links == * Volcanes de Reserva at P\u00e1gina/12 * La Payunia description and video * Accesses * La Payunia Reserve Category:Protected areas of Mendoza Province Category:Nature reserves ",
