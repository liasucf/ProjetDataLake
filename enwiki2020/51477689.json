He was ordained as a priest in 1860. He came to Edinburgh in 1861 on holiday and was persuaded to stay by the bishop to run the recently re-inaugurated St Patricks. During his long period in Edinburgh he did much to address the social problems of the poorer Catholics in the city, and founded a local branch of the Catholic Young Mens Society (CYMS) in 1865, which had been founded in Ireland by his uncle, Monsignor Richard B. O'Brien. In 1871 he became priest in charge at St Patricks. He did much for the inhabitants of \"Little Ireland\", the Irish community in Edinburgh, centred around the Cowgate. In 1875, together with the 21 year old Michael Whelahan of the CYMS, and in part to mark the centenary of Daniel O'Connell's birth, he founded Hibernian Football Club. Hannan served as the club's first Manager and as President until his death. Despite only starting as a church club Canon Hannan did much lobbying resulting in acceptance of the team playing for the Scottish Cup in 1877, only two years after their foundation. He lived in the house attached to St Patricks Church.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory He died of pneumonia on 24 June 1891.
