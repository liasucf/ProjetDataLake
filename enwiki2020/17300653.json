Programming development is guided by child psychology experts and is designed to encourage a child's skills development, such as counting, vocabulary and color recognition. The BabyFirst logo in the corner changes colors to indicate the skills a segment is intended to develop. Late-night programming is intended to lull viewers to sleep. There are also 41 BabyFirst apps for mobile devices. An app available to AT&T; U-verse viewers allows children to draw on a mobile device and have the drawing appear on the television screen. Some experts argue that exposing children to television at such an early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch with the realities of raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. ==References== ==External links== * , official website * , First Media company website Category:Television networks in the United States Category:Preschool education television networks Category:Children's television networks in the United States Category:Children's television networks in Canada Category:Television channels and stations established in 2003 Category:Early childhood education Category:Articles containing video clips ",
