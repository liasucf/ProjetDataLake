    "text": "Cyclic hemiaminal ether bond derived from an aldehyde Glycosylamines are a class of biochemical compounds consisting of a glycosyl group attached to an amino group, -NR2. They are also known as N-glycosides,. as they are a type of glycoside. Glycosyl groups can be derived from carbohydrates. The glycosyl group and amino group are connected with a \u03b2-N-glycosidic bond, forming a cyclic hemiaminal ether bond (\u03b1-aminoether). Examples include nucleosides such as adenosine. {| |The nucleoside adenosine |} ==References== Category:Biomolecules Category:Carbohydrates ",
