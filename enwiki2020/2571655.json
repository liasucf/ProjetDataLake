He was also a silver medalist in tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.Carl Kempe. Swedish Olympic Committee ==Biography== Carl Kempe was born at Jakobs f\u00f6rsamling in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of industrialist Frans Kempe (1847-1924) and Eva Charlotta Kempe ( Treffenberg). He finished secondary school at Norra Latin in Stockholm, studied at Uppsala University 1903\u20131905 and started to work for Mo och Domsj\u00f6 in 1906. His father had been employed by the family company since 1875, became its managing director in 1884 and chairman of the board in 1908. During this period, the company expanded sharply and acquired other operations with sawmills and forest land. In 1903, the first pulp factory Mo och Domsj\u00f6 opened in at Domsj\u00f6 in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik. During the first decades of the 20th century, pulp mills were established in H\u00f6rnefors and Husum. Carl Kempe had studied abroad and followed his father on business trips in foreign countries. He succeeded his father as CEO of Mo och Domsj\u00f6 in 1917. The company he took over from his father had retained many traits of a traditional lumber producer. During the 1920s, technical advances in the wood industry had began and were carried out on a large scale. Chemical laboratories were established and extensive wood research was initiated. Through large investments in research and development, Carl Kempe was chiefly responsible for its transformation into a modern chemical industry. Kempe himself claimed that he spent his time at university in Uppsala mostly with playing tennis, attending dancing lessons and playing cards; the first of these pastimes, at least, led to his winning a tennis silver medal at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm in the men's indoor doubles event together with Gunnar Setterwall (1881-1928). Ekolsund Manor In 1917, Carl Kempe bought Ekolsund Manor at Enk\u00f6ping Municipality in Uppsala County. During the period 1928\u20131930, he had the southern lane restored and modernized according to drawings by actor, art director and architect Vilhelm Bryde (1888-1974). The estate was used as a residence for his family. He had shown an interest in Chinese art since the 1920s and filled the manor house with Chinese artifacts. Shortly before his death in 1967, Kempe left Ekolsund to the daughters of his second marriage. ==Personal life== Carl Kempe married Helfrid Ingeborg Margareta Hammarberg (1885-1975) in 1919. He was married in 1934 to Aagot Marianne Axell. He was the father of five children. He died during 1967 at Enk\u00f6ping in Uppsala County. ==See also== *Holmen (company) ==References== ==Bibliography== *Gunnar Unger, \"Kempe, Johan Carl\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Vol. 21 (1975\u20131977), pp. 58\u201360. ==External links== *Holmen Group website Category:1884 births Category:1967 deaths Category:People from Stockholm Category:Swedish businesspeople Category:20th- century businesspeople Category:Swedish industrialists Category:Sportspeople from Stockholm Category:Swedish male tennis players Category:Olympic tennis players of Sweden Category:Tennis players at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for Sweden Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:Medalists at the 1912 Summer Olympics ",
