The term is used, primarily, for Armenian translators of the 6th-8th centuries who translated Greek philosophical and other texts. Unlike Golden Age (5th century) authors, their writings largely retain the Greek syntax. Greek authors whose texts were translated include Dionysius Thrax, Plato, Aristotle, Porphurios, Philon of Alexandria, Nemesius, Aratus, Gregory of Nyssa and texts such as Hermetica. Some Armenian authors, most notably Anania Shirakatsi and David the Invincible, wrote original works, drawing extensively from Greek sources and are thus considered part of the Hellenizing School. ==See also== * Graeco-Arabic translation movement, an analogue with Arab scholars ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==Further reading== * * * * Category:Medieval Armenia ",
