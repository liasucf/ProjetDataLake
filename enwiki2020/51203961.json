    "text": "Fearghal M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in, (anglicised Fergal McGovern) was chief of the McGovern Clan and Baron or Lord of Tullyhaw barony, County Cavan from 1359 until his death in 1393. ==Ancestry== His ancestry was Fearghal son of Tom\u00e1s M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in the Second (d. 1340) son of Brian \u2018Breaghach\u2019 M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in (d.1294) mac Donnchadh \u2018Cime\u2019 M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in (d.1269) mac Giolla na Naomh M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in (the Second) (d.1255) mac Giolla \u00cdosa M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in (d.1231) mac Giolla na Naomh M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in, the First (fl.1170) mac Muireadhach M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1n (fl.1130) mac Samhradh\u00e1n (fl.1100), who were all previous chiefs of the clan.M.V. Duignan (1934), \"The Ui Bri\u00fain Br\u00e9ifni genealogies\", pp. 90\u2013137, in JRSAI Vol. LXIV His mother was Nualaidh, the daughter of the Maguire chief and Maguire\u2019s wife \u00c9adaoin \u00d3\u2019Ceallaigh. His brothers were Tighearn\u00e1n, Brian (d. 1337), Aedh (d.1351), S\u00e9an, Conchobhar, Niall M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in who preceded him as chief and died in 1359, Maghnus 'Ruadh' M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in who succeeded him as chief and died in 1408, Giolla na Naomh, Tadhg Buidhe (d.1367), Maghnus Buidhe (d.1357) and Matha (d.1356). ==Chieftainship== On the death of the previous chief in 1359, his brother Niall M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in, Fearghal succeeded and reigned as chief until his death in 1393. Although he is not mentioned in the Book of Magauran, he had a reputation as a great patron of poets. In 1367 his brother Tadhg Buidhe and another relative, Aengus, died. Aengus was probably Fearghal\u2019s second cousin, once removed, the son of Conchobhar, son of Donnchadh, son of Brian \u2018Breaghach\u2019 M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in. If so then Conchobhar must have been a member of the clergy as he is referred to as a deacon and therefore is one of the earliest known clergy in the McGovern clan. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1367 state- Teige Magauran and Aengus, son of the Deacon Magauran, died. The Annals of Connacht for 1367 state- Aengus son of the Dean Mag Samradain rested. Tadc Mag Samradain died. The Annals of Loch C\u00e9 for 1367 state- Aenghus, son of the Dean Mac Samhradhain, quievit. Tadhg Mac Samhradhain mortuus est. In 1372 the poet Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r \u00d3 Dubhag\u00e1in wrote a poem about the tribes of Ireland- Triallam timcheall na Fodla. The McGoverns are mentioned as follows- Mac Samhradhain, knot of every strength, Over the illustrious Teallach Eachdhach; His land is not rendered ugly by the wind. In 1383 Fearghal\u2019s son Maol Sheachlann, who was T\u00e1naiste of the clan, died. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1383 state- Melaghlin Magauran, Tanist of Teallach Eachdhach Tullyhaw, died. ==Death== Fearghal died in April (after the 7th) 1393. The Annals of Ulster for 1393 state- Ferghal Mag Samradhain, namely, chief of Tellach-Eathach, to wit, a general patron to the learned retinues and companies of Ireland, died between Easter and May-Day this year. And troubled and saddened are the learned companies by that death. The Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1393 state- Farrell Magauran, Chief of Teallach Eachdhach, a man of lavish hospitality towards the literati. The Annals of Connacht 1393 state- Fergal Mag Samradain, chieftain of Tullyhaw, a man who was lauded jointly by the poets and satirists of Ireland, [died] between Easter and Mayday. The Annals of Loch C\u00e9 for 1393 state- Ferghal Mac Samhradhain, dux of Tellach-Echach, (and a man who was equally praised by the poets and satirists of Erinn), died between Easter and May-day. ==Family== Fearghal\u2019s sons were Maol Sheachlann (who was T\u00e1naiste of the clan and died in 1383), Brian (died 1427), Donnchadh Ballach (d. 1445) and Cormac. ==References== Category:1393 deaths Category:Irish lords Category:People from County Cavan Category:14th-century Irish people ",
