In 2011 Kane developed Home for Orphaned Dishes as the Children's Commission for Whitechapel Gallery, which displayed a collection of studio pottery as a counterpoint to contemporary slick mass-produced design. The work was purchased by the British Council for their collection.

He contributed But., a series of benches constructed from gravestones mounted on top of welded and powder-coated frames, and in Norwich arranged for a team of six carts pulled by Shire horses to deliver the artworks to the venues as a celebration and procession. In 2019 Kane organised 4 Bed Detached Home of Metal, an exhibition at The New Art Gallery Walsall as part of Home of Metal, a celebration of Heavy Metal's birth in Birmingham.
