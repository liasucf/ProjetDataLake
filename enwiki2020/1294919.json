    "text": "Frederick William Mulley, Baron Mulley, PC (3 July 1918 \u2013 15 March 1995) was a British Labour politician, barrister-at-law and economist. ==Early life== Mulley attended Warwick School between 1929 and 1936. He served in the Worcestershire Regiment in the Second World War, reaching the rank of sergeant, but was captured in 1940 and spent five years as a prisoner of war in Germany. During this time he obtained a BSc in economics from University of London as an external student and became a chartered secretary.Worcestershire Regiment (29th/36th of Foot) Web site At the end of the war, he received an adult scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, and after a brief spell on an economics fellowship at the University of Cambridge (1948\u201350) he trained as a barrister, being called to the Bar in 1954. ==Parliamentary career== Mulley had been a member of the Labour Party since 1936 and at the 1945 general election he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Sutton Coldfield. He became Member of Parliament for Sheffield Park in 1950, a position he held until deselected by his local party prior to the 1983 general election. During a long career in politics he held many ministerial positions including Minister of Aviation (1965\u201367), Minister for Disarmament (1967\u201369), and Minister of Transport (1969\u201370, 1974\u201375). While at the Transport Ministry he believed it would be inappropriate to be seen to be a car driver. Although he owned an Austin Maxi, his wife was the sole user of it during this period. In 1975 Harold Wilson brought him to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science, and in 1976 became Secretary of State for Defence. He fell asleep during the Queen's Jubilee Review of the Royal Air Force at RAF Finningley in 1977 when there was considerable noise around him. Having a small sleep during exercise was referred to by members of the RAF as having a \"Fred Mulley\". It was suggested in the satirical magazine Private Eye that Mulley was guilty of treason (then still a capital offence) for having slept with the Queen. ==House of Lords== After retiring from the House of Commons in 1983, he was created a life peer as Baron Mulley, of Manor Park in the City of Sheffield on 30 January 1984, and he held a variety of directorial positions. ==Legacy== A main road in the Lower Don Valley in Sheffield is named after him. == References == == External links == * |- |- |- |- |- Category:1918 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Alumni of St Catharine's College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of University of London Worldwide Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff- sponsored MPs Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:British Secretaries of State for Education Category:Chairs of the Labour Party (UK) Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964\u20131970 Category:People educated at Warwick School Category:Secretaries of State for Defence (UK) Category:Secretaries of State for Transport (UK) Category:UK MPs 1950\u20131951 Category:UK MPs 1951\u20131955 Category:UK MPs 1955\u20131959 Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:Worcestershire Regiment soldiers Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany ",
