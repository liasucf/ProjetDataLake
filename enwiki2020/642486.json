At that time, the Dutchmen were called \"Flemish\" by the Portuguese.GARCIA, S. Rio de Janeiro: Passado e Presente. Rio de Janeiro: Conex\u00e3o Cultural, 2000. p. 37 == Characteristics == It is located between Catete and Botafogo districts on the edge of Guanabara Bay. The beachfront area is dominated by the Brigadier Eduardo Gomes Park, also known as Aterro do Flamengo, built by Lota de Macedo Soares on nearly 300 acres (1.2 km\u00b2) of land reclaimed from the bay and completed in 1965. The park features gardens designed by well-known Brazilian landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx. The district and surroundings are serviced by three subway stations: Flamengo, Largo do Machado and Catete, and many bus lines that link it to the rest of the city. It is fairly close to the city centre and offers excellent views of P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar (Sugarloaf Mountain) and the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Nowadays, it is mostly a middle-class residential neighborhood. Its main streets are Senador Vergueiro, Marqu\u00eas de Abrantes and Praia do Flamengo. ===Destinations=== *Carmen Miranda Museum *Flamengo Park\u2014Parque Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes *Marina da Gl\u00f3ria *Monument to the Dead of World War II *Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro ==Notable residents== *Z\u00f3zimo Bulbul, actor and filmmaker ==References== Category:Beaches of Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Guanabara Bay ",
