Nadezhda said: \"I live and write with love to my crazy time\u201d. She was a philologist and a musician by education, a playwright by vocation. Although she died at the age of 44, she was referred to as \u201cThe most gifted screenwriter of the perestroika epoch\u201d.60 anniversary of the birth of Nadezhda Kozhushanaya, Russia-K, 15 March 2012 == Biography and creative work== === Childhood === Nadezhda Kozhushanaya (Yamshanova), was born in Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg). Her father was Pavel Ivanovich Yamshanov (the Chief Engineer of a laboratory of the Uralmash plant), who had a rich library of art books and fiction. Her mother was Glafira Mihailovna Yamshanova (Smirnova) (a teacher at a local Metallurgical Technical College). Her parents divorced when Nadezhda was eight. From an early age Nadezhda wrote her own stories and fairy tales. Her story \"Pustiak\" was based on her first dramatic experience of reading aloud for the class . === University === After school 1968 Nadezhda went to A.M. Gorky Ural State University to study philology. She actively took part as an actress and an accompanist in student theatres of the University and Ural State Academy of Architecture and Arts. She composed music and easily played in the piano, guitar and accordion that gave a nudge to the decision to study in the Urals Mussorgsky State Conservatoire, but her mother made a requirement that Nadezhda should graduate the University first. In preparation to her thesis, Nadezhda worked in the museum of Muranovo, where she also gave guided tours about Fyodor Tyutchev. After graduation, according to the common Soviet practice, she was posted as a teacher of Russian to a remote village of Kunara, Sverdlovsk Oblast. In 1975 Nadezhda married Boris Kozhushany and moved to Moscow, where her husband studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute. === Moscow === In Moscow, first she had a clerical job (later she wrote comic stories about it). Plays and other works of this period almost did not survive, but it was the time when she created her own style. Nadezhda said: \u00abEverything that I wrote is needed to be read aloud\u00bb. On 1 December 1980 her daughter Ekaterina was born. In 1982\u20131984 Nadezda studied at the High Courses for Scriptwriters and Film Directors in Moscow as a Screenwriter. After her admission interview, Valentin Chernykh, one of the leaders of the courses, formulated his reluctance to take Nadezhda as: \u201cShe is a person with the character like Gennady Shpalikov, Vladimir Vysotsky, Oleg Dahl.
