    "text": "Had\u017eipopovac () is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Palilula. == Location == Had\u017eipopovac is located in the central part of urban section of the municipality. It borders the neighborhood of Paliula to the south, municipality of Zvezdara (neighborhood Slavujev Venac) and Belgrade New Cemetery to the east, neighborhood of Bogoslovija to the north and the neighborhood and municipality of Stari Grad to the west. Had\u017eipopovac is bordered by the streets of Ruzveltova, Cviji\u0107eva, Zdravka \u010celara, \u010carlija \u010caplina. == Name == The neighborhood was named after the land owned by the old Belgrade family of Had\u017ei-Popovi\u0107 in the area. Map of Urban local communities of Belgrade in Palilula municipality == History == Southwest border is today set by the Cviji\u0107eva Street, but historically this was the route of the creek of Slavujev potok or Bulbulderski potok (Slavuj or Bulbulder Creek), which flew from the Zvezdara hill into the Danube, east of the present location of the Pan\u010devo Bridge. It is completely conducted underground today, into the sewage system. At the modern corner of the Cviji\u0107eva and Zdravka \u010celara, there was a widening, where the creek would overspill and the pond would form. Local population came to the pond for harvesting reeds and shooting ducks. Historically, until World War I, the area was considered to be the part of Bulbulder, as term was applied to the much wider area than today. It included the entire valley of the Bulbulder Creek with the Veliki Vra\u010dar hill, especially its right bank which would today also include Zvezdara Forest, Slavujev Venac, Slavujev Potok, Had\u017eipopovac and Profesorska Kolonija. Major changes ensued after 1886 and construction of the Belgrade New Cemetery nearby. The main street which connected the neighborhood to the rest of Belgrade, Grobljanski Put (Cemetery Road, later street; renamed tp Ruzveltova in 1946) became much busier. In 1893, a tram line of public transportation was conducted through the street. Originally assigned No. 3, it was later changed to No. 8 and in 1949 it became No. 13. Because of this, a small bridge was built over the creek in the 19th century, on the route of the Grobljanska Street. Original wooden bridge was replaced with the stone one in 1929. The bridge was replaced mainly to make easier access to the cemetery, further down the Grobljanska Street. Old bridge was often getting covered in ice during the winter and numerous accidents were recorded. Apart from the Grobljanska Street, the second most important street in this part of town, opposite to the Grobljanska, was cut through by this time, too. Northern section which leads to Had\u017eipopovac and Profesorska Kolonija, to the \u0110u\u0161ina Street, was named Slavujska, while the southern was named Bulbulderska. Name change was proposed for the northern section which reached Profesorksa Kolonija, so it was renamed to Cviji\u0107eva, after the professor and scientist Jovan Cviji\u0107. Two main streets were meeting, but not crossing each other, being cut off from each other by the bridge. Works on the overpass, which allowed the crossing, were finished in December 1930. In this period, at 35 Grobljanska Street, the bus company of Ljubi\u0161a Peri\u0161i\u0107, which maintained the bus line in the neighborhood, built vast garage for its vehicles. It later became known as the Ford Garage. In the early 1941, before World War II began in Yugoslavia, the bus line No. 28 was established, which connected City Hospital (today KBC Zvezdara) to Theatre Square in downtown Belgrade, via Had\u017eipopovac and Profesorska Kolonija. The Ford Garage was burned down by the members of Communist youth organization SKOJ in the night of 26/27 July 1941, as the occupational German forces kept parked vehicles here. After the war, the Ford Garage was adapted into the facility of Automobilsko Beograd company. It was completely demolished later and the shopping mall Zira Center was build instead. It was opened in 2007, while the adjoining Zira Hotel followed in May 2008. After World War II it was the eastern border of the city, today it is kilometers away from the eastern border of Belgrade. == Characteristics == The local community of Had\u017eipopovac had a population of 3,863 in 2011. Administrative name of the local community until the 2000s was \"Oslobodioci Beograda\". At the corner of the Cviji\u0107eva and Ljube Didi\u0107a streets, there is a \"Park Jovan Cviji\u0107\", which is the smallest official park in Belgrade. It developed in the 1960s, when the surrounding residential complex was also built. It covers an area of . Had\u017eipopovac has one elementary school, \"Oslobodioci Beograda\". A lot of neighborhood children also go to elementary school \"Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107\" which is on a border of Had\u017eipopovac and Stari Grad. There is a lot of cafes, bars and taverns in Had\u017eipopovac. Old and famous tavern in this neighbourhood is \"Kosmaj\", at 105 Cviji\u0107eva Street. == Profesorska Kolonija == Roughly, eastern section of Had\u017eipopovac borders with the neighborhood of Profesorska Kolonija (). It has newer buildings than the rest of Had\u017eipopovac which is a cause for the popular quarrels between those who consider them inhabitants of Had\u017eipopovac and those from Profesorska Kolonija. Name of the neighborhood is Serbian for \"Professors' colony\". The neighborhood developed during the Interbellum. It was originally mostly inhabited by the families of the Belgrade University professors and of members of the Serbian Royal Academy, hence the name. The University handed the lots to their professors so that they could build houses and even served as the guarantor for professors' mortgage credits. Among the founders of the neighborhood were 23 doctors of science and 15 members of the Serbian Royal Academy. The base for the drafting of the urban concept and construction of the neighborhood was Belgrade's general urban plan from 1923. The basic design, which was followed almost to the letter during the construction, was that of a garden city. Prior to urbanization, the area consisted of agricultural fields and orchards, which the state was purchasing and then handing them over to the University. Profesorska Kolonija was built from 1926 to 1927, in the area which was formerly considered the northernmost extension of Bulbulder. It was bounded by the streets of Knez Miletina (today Despota Stefana Boulevard), Mitropolita Petra and Zdravka \u010celara, and by the Bulbulder Creek which used to flow through the neighborhood before the urbanization. However, the creek continued to flood the area, especially after heavy rains, cutting off the neighborhood completely from downtown. The drainage network was constructed and the creek was conducted underground by 1933. In 1927, the bus line of public transportation was established, which connected Profesorska Kolonija section with the Belgrade Main railway station. The former creeks route is today the Cviji\u0107eva Street. Similarly, but not entirely in the same vein, in the 1930s several other \"colonies\" were built on Belgrade's outskirts: \u010cinovni\u010dka Kolonija in Vo\u017edovac (Clerks' colony; most resembling the Profesorska Kolonija in terms of architecture), \u017delezni\u010dka Kolonija on Top\u010didersko Brdo (Railway colony) or Radni\u010dka Kolonija at Topovske \u0160upe, near Autokomanda (Workers' colony). Unlike its counterparts, Profesorska Kolonija by the 2020s for the most part managed to keep its original appearance. There are certain urban additions which are considered \"failed\" in comparison to the original architecture, but Profesorska Kolonija remained a neighborhood of pre-war villas with green, lush yards and gardens. The Memorial Museum of Nade\u017eda and Rastko Petrovi\u0107, a former house of Ljubica Lukovi\u0107, cousin of Nade\u017eda and Rastko Petrovi\u0107, is located in the neighborhood and declared a cultural monument. The House of Milutin Milankovi\u0107, at 9 Ljubomira Stojanovi\u0107a street, where the scientist Milutin Milankovi\u0107 lived, is also in the neighborhood. Milankovi\u0107 himself projected the house which was later declared a cultural monument, too. Villa Prendi\u0107, built in 1932-1933 and designed by Milan Zlokovi\u0107 was also declared a cultural monument, in March 2020. One of the most representative edifices of Modern architecture in Belgrade, it is located at 20 Osmana \u0110iki\u0107a Street and faces the park. It was built for Jovan Prendi\u0107 and his wife Dragojla Prendi\u0107, and originally also served as the medical office. Apart from the individually protected objects, in 2020, the entire neighborhood was placed under the protection as the cultural monument, or the spatial cultural-historical unit, which preserved its basic, authentic characteristics. On three sides, the protected area is narrower than the neighborhood itself, covering the old core, while on the western side it extends across the Cviji\u0107eva Street, all the way to the Takovska Street. Borders of the preservation area are the streets Mitropolita Petra, \u010carlija \u010caplina, Bra\u0107e Grim, Ljubomira Stojanovi\u0107a, Cviji\u0107eva, \u0110u\u0161ina, Dra\u017ee Pavlovi\u0107a, Takovska, Cviji\u0107eva again, Bulevar Despota Stefana and Sterijina. Total protected area covers . Profesorska Kolonija is administratively organized as the local community of \"Jovan Cviji\u0107\" which had a population of 2,634 in 2011. == References == Category:Neighborhoods of Belgrade ",
