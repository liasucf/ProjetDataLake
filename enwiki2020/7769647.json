    "text": "Gary Kenneth Penrice (born 23 March 1964) is a former professional footballer. He played for Bristol Rovers, Watford, Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers as a striker. Following a career that saw him make over 400 appearances, he became an assistant manager, attacking coach and later a talent scout. As of August 2013, he is a talent scout for Everton specialising in the European market. ==Early life== Penrice was born in Bristol and grew up in Mangotsfield, where his parents still live today. Penrice was in the same class as ex-Blackpool manager Ian Holloway at school and they still remain close friends today. Penrice's potential footballing ability was evident from a young age and he was signed up as an apprentice by Bristol City; however, they later decided to release him, stating that he was too small to make it as a professional. After being released from his apprenticeship, Penrice, like his father before him, signed for local side Mangotsfield United. Penrice attended the same secondary school team as fellow future professional footballers Gary Smart, Gary Penrice and Ian Holloway, who were all roughly the same age. While playing for Mangotsfield, Penrice attended college and became a qualified plumber, planning to build himself a new career after failing to make the grade at Bristol City. Penrice worked as a plumber for a couple of years before his forgotten dream was to be rekindled. After scouts attended several of Mangotsfields matches, Penrice was offered a trial and signed with the team he and his family supported, Bristol Rovers. ==Playing career== ===Bristol Rovers=== Prior to signing for Rovers, Penrice spent time in the reserve-team. After making his first-team d\u00e9but, Penrice went on to become a regular, playing alongside ex-school friend Ian Holloway. Penrice's twenty goals helped Rovers into the Third Division play-off final in 1989, only to be beaten 2\u20131 on aggregate by Port Vale. ===Watford=== Penrice would later miss out on a fairytale Third Division Championship success with Bristol Rovers to sign for Watford for a club record \u00a3500,000 sale late in 1989. Penrice played for Watford for only one season, scoring 18 goals in 43 appearances, including a run of eight goals in his first nine games, before catching the eye of First Division side Aston Villa. ===Aston Villa=== Following his season with Watford, Penrice was snapped up by Aston Villa for a \u00a31 million in 1991. He went on to score only once for the club in twenty games, spending much time on the sidelines with a broken leg. ===Queens Park Rangers=== Just eight months after signing for Villa, Penrice was taken to Queens Park Rangers by former Rovers boss Gerry Francis. He joined an ex- Rovers enclave and teamed up again with Ian Holloway. Penrice made his d\u00e9but for QPR in November 1991 against Aston Villa and went on to play 63 league games, scoring twenty goals. ===Return to Watford=== In November 1995, Penrice signed for former club Watford. After scoring over twenty top-flight goals, Penrice, now 31, reverted to a deeper creative-midfielder role. ===Return home to Bristol Rovers=== Penrice re-signed for Bristol Rovers on a free transfer in the summer of 1997 to lead them to the Second Division play-offs that year alongside player-boss Ian Holloway in the centre of midfield. After a 16-year career, scoring 110 goals in 400 professional appearances, Penrice retired from playing and became Holloway's assistant manager at Rovers after Phil Bater moved to take control of the youth team. ==Post-playing career== ===Assistant manager=== Since his retirement from playing, Penrice has stuck with friend Ian Holloway as his assistant manager at both Bristol Rovers and later at Queens Park Rangers. He resigned from his position at Bristol Rovers in February 2002. ===Scouting=== After leaving Q.P.R., Penrice followed Holloway to Plymouth Argyle as chief scout in September 2006, turning down the offer of assistant manager. Penrice did, however, become strikers coach on a one-day-a-week basis after being asked by Holloway to help develop Plymouth's strikers by using his attacking knowledge. Penrice left Plymouth Argyle at the end of November 2007, once again re-joining Ian Holloway at Leicester City as head of recruitment. Following Holloway's departure from Leicester, Penrice left Leicester by mutual consent on 1 July 2008 after Nigel Pearson had taken charge at the club. In October 2008, Penrice joined Stoke City as a European Scout. Tony Pulis was eager to add Penrice to the Stoke scouting network to use his knowledge of the European transfer market. He remained at Stoke for three years. Penrice is now involved in international player recruitment on a freelance basis, searching out talent abroad for a number of clubs, including Wigan and Blackpool. The Daily Express reported that he joined Everton F.C. in August 2013. ==Personal life== Penrice is married to Louise and has three daughters: Amy, Rebecca and Grace. ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Bristol Category:People from Mangotsfield Category:Mangotsfield United F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English footballers Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. non-playing staff Category:Sportspeople from Gloucestershire Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football midfielders ",
