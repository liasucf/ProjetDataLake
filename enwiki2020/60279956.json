Jazzdiscography: Buck Hill Leader Entry, accessed March 20, 2019 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow stated \"This particular LP, recorded at the same Northsea Jazz Festival that had already resulted in Easy to Love, features Hill in 1981 leading a quartet ... The solos of Hill and Brown are excellent if not overly memorable, and the results are pleasing and swinging while being a little explorative in spots\". ==Track listing== # \"Alone Together\" (Arthur Schwartz, Howard Dietz) \u2013 9:05 # \"Penn Station\" (Reuben Brown) \u2013 10:50 # \"Yesterdays\" (Jerome Kern, Otto Harbach) \u2013 11:58 # \"Impressions\" (John Coltrane) \u2013 8:45 # \"Spaces\" (Brown) \u2013 7:54 Additional track on CD release ==Personnel== *Buck Hill \u2013 tenor saxophone *Reuben Brown \u2013 piano *Wilbur Little \u2013 bass *Billy Hart \u2013 drums ==References== Category:SteepleChase Records live albums Category:Buck Hill (musician) live albums Category:1983 live albums ",
