    "text": "The Sword of the Spirit is an international, ecumenical association of Christian communities within the Charismatic Movement. The member communities are composed predominately of laypersons. == History == The Sword of the Spirit was founded by Ralph Martin and Steve Clark in 1982. Clark was born in 1940, and studied at Yale University, the University of Freiburg, and the University of Notre Dame. He worked with Ralph Martin as an early leader of the Charismatic Movement in Michigan, publishing several books on charismatic spirituality and Christian community building. == People of Hope == The People of Hope became affiliated with the Sword of the Spirit in 1983. In 1986, the Archbishop of Newark, Peter L. Gerty, ordered the People of Hope community to end affiliation with the Sword of the Spirit. Rev. Philipp Rotunno, liaison for charismatic renewal, branded the Sword of the Spirit an \"Evil Empire\" in response to claims that leadership thought they were \"anointed by god\", exerted excessive control over community members, and the subservient role of women, dubbed \"handmaidens\", in the community. The subjugation of women within the Sword of the Spirit and People of Hope became inspiration for the novel The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, who described gender roles and other practices within the Sword of the Spirit and People of Hope as \"a form of brainwashing\". == Word of God == The initial federation of Sword of the Spirit communities included the Word of God community in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1990, the Word of God disaffiliated with the Sword of the Spirit following an investigation into abuses within the community by Bishop Albert Ottenweller. Founders Steve Clark and Ralph Martin split, Martin remaining with Word of God, and Clark remaining with Sword of the Spirit. Following the disaffiliation, Martin said that the Sword of the Spirit training course was \"an ill-advised venture that led to considerable confusion, turmoil, spiritual distress both in individuals and in the community as a body,\" \"fostered elitism,\" \"attempted to build a comprehensive Christian culture by fiat,\" was especially harmful to women and \"had a negative impact on many marriages and placed undue stress on many families.\" == People of Praise == Current affiliated covenant communities include the People of Praise in Bangalore, India. == Servants of the Word == The Servants of the Word is an ecumenical Sword of the Spirit community of men. The men are committed to serving within other Sword of the Spirit communities. Serious concerns were raised regarding Servants of the Word's child protection policy following the conviction of Jamie Treadwell for sexual abuse of children while a member of Servants of the Word, where it became apparent that Servants of the Word leadership had been aware of similar allegations which had been reported to authorities regarding Treadwell and other Servants of the Word members for at least ten years. == See also == * Emmanuel Community * People of Praise == References == == External links == * The Sword of the Spirit * The Servants of the Word Category:Nondenominational Christian societies and communities ",
