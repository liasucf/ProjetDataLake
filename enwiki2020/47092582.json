He is currently signed to WWE, where he works in the writing team as the Senior Vice President of Creative. In WWE, Kapoor is best known as the manager, translator, and storyline brother of The Great Khali. ==Professional wrestling career== ===World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE=== ====Managing The Great Khali (2007\u20132011, 2014)==== In 2007, Kapoor began his career with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the heel manager and translator for The Great Khali under the ring name Ranjin Singh. On the December 21 episode of SmackDown, Singh competed in his first match, teaming with Khali in a losing effort against Finlay and Hornswoggle. On the January 11, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Singh challenged Hornswoggle to an Arm wrestling contest in a losing effort, after Finlay shocked Singh's hand with the glove that Hornswoggle wore during the contest. Later in 2008, Khali and Singh turned face, with the duo hosting a segment called \"Khali Kiss Cam\". On the April 29, 2011 episode of SmackDown, Khali and Singh were greeted by the debuting Jinder Mahal. The following week on SmackDown, Mahal, unimpressed with how Khali and Singh were acting, confronted Singh about him mismanaging Khali. On the May 27 episode of SmackDown, after Khali was defeated by Kane, Mahal shoved Singh, with Khali then attacking Singh, ending their partnership. On the July 1 episode of SmackDown, Singh revealed that Khali joined with Mahal because they are brothers-in-law (kayfabe), with Mahal threatening to divorce Khali's sister if Khali didn't do as he said, which would bring Khali's family back into poverty. Singh was absent from television for over 2 and a half years, but managed Khali again for one night only in January 2014.http://www.wwe.com/videos/playlists/old-school-raw- january-6-2014-highlights ====Creative team (2011\u2013present)==== Since leaving The Great Khali as his manager, Kapoor has worked for WWE behind the scenes.
