    "text": "The Hiram C. Smith House is a historic residence located west of Winterset, Iowa, United States. Smith was one of the earliest settlers in this township, having acquired the deed to the farm between 1854 and 1856. with This house is an early example of a vernacular limestone farmhouse. It is a 1\u00bd-story, one-room structure composed of rubble stone quarried on the farm and laid in a random bond. Its construction is attributed to Smith, as its rough and simple construction do not reflect the work of any of the stonemasons working in the county at the time it was built. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. His milking shed, built about the same time and on the same property, is also listed on the National Register. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1856 Category:Vernacular architecture in Iowa Category:Houses in Madison County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
