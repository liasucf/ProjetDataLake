Note two 300 meter chimneys, which have since been demolished J\u00e4nschwalde Power Station is located near the village of J\u00e4nschwalde in Brandenburg on the German-Polish border. The lignite-fired power station has an installed capacity of 3,000 megawatts and consists of six 500 MW units. It is the third-largest brown coal power plant in operation in Germany and is currently owned by EPH, who took over its ownership from Vattenfall in 2016. ==Overview== The power station was built by VEB BMK Kohle und Energie (de) between 1976 and 1988. Between the German reunification and the mid-1990s, modern environmental technology was adopted, making higher energy efficiency possible. Despite this, the power station has the fifth- lowest ratio of energy efficiency to CO2 emission in Europe, according to a study by the WWF.http://assets.panda.org/downloads/european_dirty_thirty_may_2007.pdf The Dirty Thirty report J\u00e4nschwalde power station predominantly fires raw brown coal from nearby open-pit mining in J\u00e4nschwalde and Cottbus to the north. At full load the power station burns approximately 80,000 tons of brown coal a day. From one kilogram of brown coal about one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy is produced. The yearly power output lies around 22 billion kWh, 22 TWh. The site formerly featured three obsolete chimneys. These were gradually dismantled in a complex process between 2002 and 2007, as conventional demolition was not possible on the site for space reasons. A unique procedure was introduced for this task: the chimneys were broken down from the top to a height of by a special mechanism equipped with excavators which works round the edges of the chimneys, after which the remaining stacks were demolished by conventional means. ==See also== * List of largest power stations in the world ==Notes== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1976 Category:Towers completed in 1976 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1989 Category:Coal-fired power stations in Germany Category:Vattenfall Category:Towers in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Spree-Nei\u00dfe Category:Chimneys in Germany Category:Energetick\u00fd a pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd holding ",
