(1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 95. He successfully overthrew the Kamakura shogunate in 1333 and established the short lived Kenmu Restoration to bring the Imperial House back into power. This was to be the last time the emperor had any power until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.Sansom 1977: 22\u201342. The Kenmu restoration was in turn overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, ushering in the Ashikaga shogunate, and split the imperial family into two opposing factions between the Ashikaga backed Northern Court situated in Kyoto and the Southern Court based in Yoshino led by Go-Daigo and his later successors. This 14th-century sovereign personally chose his posthumous name after the 9th-century Emperor Daigo and go- (\u5f8c), translates as \"later\", and he is thus sometimes called the \"Later Emperor Daigo\", or, in some older sources, \"Daigo, the second\" or as \"Daigo II\". ==Biography== Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (imina) was Takaharu-shinn\u014d (\u5c0a\u6cbb\u89aa\u738b).Titsingh, ; Varley, p. 241. He was the second son of the Daikakuji-t\u014d emperor, Emperor Go-Uda. His mother was Fujiwara no Ch\u016bshi/Tadako (\u85e4\u539f\u5fe0\u5b50), daughter of Fujiwara no Tadatsugu (Itsutsuji Tadatsugu) (\u85e4\u539f\u5fe0\u7d99/\u4e94\u8fbb\u5fe0\u7d99). She became Nyoin called Dantenmon-in (\u8ac7\u5929\u9580\u9662). His older brother was Emperor Go-Nij\u014d. Emperor Go-Daigo's ideal was the Engi era (901\u2013923) during the reign of Emperor Daigo, a period of direct imperial rule. An emperor's posthumous name was normally chosen after his death, but Emperor Go-Daigo chose his personally during his lifetime, to share it with Emperor Daigo. ===Events of Go-Daigo's life=== Woodblock print triptych by Ogata Gekk\u014d; Emperor Go-Daigo dreams of ghosts at his palace in Kasagiyama * 1308 (Enky\u014d 1): At the death of Emperor Go-Nij\u014d, Hanazono accedes to the Chrysanthemum Throne at age 12 years; and Takaharu-shinn\u014d, the second son of former-Emperor Go-Uda is elevated as Crown Prince and heir apparent under the direction of the Kamakura shogunate.Titsingh, ; Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959) The Imperial House of Japan, p. 204. * 29 March 1318 (Bunp\u014d 2, 26th day of 2nd month): In the 11th year of Hanazono's reign (\u82b1\u5712\u5929\u7687\u5341\u4e00\u5e74), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by his cousin, the second son of former-Emperor Go-Uda. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Daigo is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, ; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jit\u014d, Y\u014dzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. * 1319 (Bunp\u014d 3, 4th month): Emperor Go-Daigo caused the neng\u014d to be changed to Gen'\u014d to mark the beginning of his reign.Varley, p. 243. In 1324, with the discovery of Emperor Go-Daigo's plans to overthrow the Kamakura shogunate, the Rokuhara Tandai disposed of his close associate Hino Suketomo in the Sh\u014dch\u016b Incident. In the Genk\u014d Incident of 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo's plans were again discovered, this time by a betrayal by his close associate Yoshida Sadafusa. He quickly hid the Sacred Treasures in a secluded castle in Kasagiyama (the modern town of Kasagi, S\u014draku District, Ky\u014dto Prefecture) and raised an army, but the castle fell to the shogunate's army the following year, and they enthroned Emperor K\u014dgon, exiling Daigo to Oki Province (the Oki Islands in modern-day Shimane Prefecture), the same place to which Emperor Go-Toba had been exiled after the J\u014dky\u016b War of 1221. In 1333, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki with the help of Nawa Nagatoshi and his family, raising an army at Senjo Mountain in H\u014dki Province (the modern town of Kotoura in T\u014dhaku District, Tottori Prefecture). Ashikaga Takauji, who had been sent by the shogunate to find and destroy this army, sided with the emperor and captured the Rokuhara Tandai. Immediately following this, Nitta Yoshisada, who had raised an army in the east, laid siege to Kamakura. When the city finally fell to Nitta, H\u014dj\u014d Takatoki, the shogunal regent, fled to T\u014dsh\u014d temple, where he and his entire family committed suicide. This ended H\u014dj\u014d power and paved the way for a new military regime. Upon his triumphal return to Kyoto, Daigo took the throne from Emperor K\u014dgon and began the Kenmu Restoration. The Restoration was ostensibly a revival of the older ways, but, in fact, the emperor had his eye set on an imperial dictatorship like that of the emperor of China. He wanted to imitate the Chinese in all their ways and become the most powerful ruler in the East. Impatient reforms, litigation over land rights, rewards, and the exclusion of the samurai from the political order caused much complaining, and his political order began to fall apart. In 1335, Ashikaga Takauji, who had travelled to eastern Japan without obtaining an imperial edict in order to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, became disaffected. Daigo ordered Nitta Yoshisada to track down and destroy Ashikaga. Ashikaga defeated Nitta Yoshisada at the Battle of Takenoshita, Hakone. Kusunoki Masashige and Kitabatake Akiie, in communication with Kyoto, smashed the Ashikaga army. Takauji fled to Ky\u016bsh\u016b, but the following year, after reassembling his army, he again approached Ky\u014dto. Kusunoki Masashige proposed a reconciliation with Takauji to the emperor, but Go-Daigo rejected this. He ordered Masashige and Yoshisada to destroy Takauji. Kusunoki's army was defeated at the Battle of Minatogawa. When Ashikaga's army entered Ky\u014dto, Emperor Go-Daigo resisted, fleeing to Mount Hiei, but seeking reconciliation, he sent the imperial regalia to the Ashikaga side. Takauji enthroned the Jimy\u014din-t\u014d emperor, K\u014dmy\u014d, and officially began his shogunate with the enactment of the Kenmu Law Code. Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Go-Daigo Go-Daigo escaped from the capital in January 1337, the regalia that he had handed over to the Ashikaga being counterfeit, and set up the Southern Court among the mountains of Yoshino, beginning the Period of Northern and Southern Courts in which the Northern Dynasty in Kyoto and the Southern Dynasty in Yoshino faced off against each other. Emperor Go-Daigo ordered Imperial Prince Kaneyoshi to Ky\u016bsh\u016b and Nitta Yoshisada and Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi to Hokuriku, and so forth, dispatching his sons all over, so that they could oppose the Northern Court. * 18 September 1339 (Ryaku\u014d 2, 15th day of the 8th month): In the 21st year of Go-Daigo's reign, the emperor abdicated at Yoshino in favor of his son, Noriyoshi-shinn\u014d, who would become Emperor Go-Murakami.Varley, p. 270. * 19 September 1339 (Ryaku\u014d 2, 16th day of the 8th month): Go-Daigo died;Titsingh, The actual site of Go-Daigo's grave is settled. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Daigo's mausoleum. It is formally named T\u014d-no-o no misasagi.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 420. ==Genealogy== ===Consorts and children=== Empress Kishi and Emperor Go-Daigo.

Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Go-Daigo's reign, this apex of the Daij\u014d-kan included: * Kampaku, Nij\u014d Michihira, 1316\u20131318 * Kampaku, Ichij\u014d Uchitsune, 1318\u20131323 * Kampaku, Kuj\u014d Fusazane, 1323\u20131324 * Kampaku, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1324\u20131327 * Kampaku, Nij\u014d Michihira, 1327\u20131330 * Kampaku, Konoe Tsunetada, 1330 * Kampaku, Takatsukasa Fuyunori, 1330\u20131333 * Sadaijin * Udaijin * Naidaijin * Dainagon ==Eras of Go-Daigo's reign== The years of Go-Daigo's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or neng\u014d. Emperor Go-Daigo's eight era name changes are mirrored in number only in the reign of Emperor Go-Hanazono, who also reigned through eight era name changes.Titsingh, Japanese Imperial kamon \u2014 a stylized chrysanthemum blossom :Pre-Nanboku-ch\u014d court * Bunp\u014d (1317\u20131319) * Gen'\u014d (1319\u20131321) * Genk\u014d (1321\u20131324) * Sh\u014dch\u016b (1324\u20131326) * Karyaku (1326\u20131329) * Gentoku (1329\u20131331) * Genk\u014d (1331\u20131334) * Kenmu (1334\u20131336) :Nanboku-ch\u014d southern court * Eras as reckoned by legitimate sovereign's Court (as determined by Meiji rescript) ** Engen (1336\u20131340) :Nanboku-ch\u014d northern Court * Eras as reckoned by pretender sovereign's Court (as determined by Meiji rescript) ** Sh\u014dkei (1332\u20131338) ** Ryaku\u014d (1338\u20131342) ==In popular culture== Emperor Go-Daigo appears in the alternate history novel Romanitas by Sophia McDougall. ==See also== * Emperor of Japan * List of Emperors of Japan * Imperial cult * Yoshino Shrine ==Notes== ==References== * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
