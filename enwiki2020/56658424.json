    "text": "{| |} The Saint Philippe was a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Royal Navy. She was built at Brest Dockyard, designed and constructed by Laurent Hubac. She was nominally a three-decker, but in practice the upper deck was divided into armed sections aft and forward of the unarmed waist, making the upper deck equivalent to a quarterdeck and forecastle. She took part in the Battle of Cherchell on 24 August 1665 (as flagship of Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon- Vend\u00f4me, Duc de Beaufort) and in the Battle of Solebay on 7 June 1672 (as flagship of Vice-admiral Jean d'Estr\u00e9es). She was refitted at Brest from 2 August to 11 September 1683, emerging with 70 guns, and recommissioned in June 1689 as the flagship of chef d'escadre Jean Gabaret. She took part in the Battle of Beachy Head on 10 July 1690 (as flagship of Alain Emmanuel de Co\u00ebtlogon) and in the Battle of Barfleur on 29 May 1692. Following the latter battle, she was beached at La Hogue where she was attacked and burnt by the English on 2 June 1692 == Sources and references == * *Nomenclature des Vaisseaux du Roi-Soleil de 1661 a 1715.
