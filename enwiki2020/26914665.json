    "text": "Fostedil (A-53,986, KB-944) is a vasodilator acting as a calcium channel blocker which was under development for the treatment of heart conditions such as angina pectoris but was never marketed. It has antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic effects. == Synthesis == Fostedil synthesis: #Treatment of benzanilide with phosphorus pentasulfide or Lawesson's reagent gives thioamide. #Oxidative ring formation by reaction with potassium ferricyanide and base (presumably involving a free radical intermediate) constructs the benzothiazole ring. #Bromination of this compound with N-bromosuccinimide produces bromomethyl intermediate. #The synthesis of fostedil concludes with a Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction with triethyl phosphite. == See also == *Ibrolipim * Calcium channel blocker == References == Category:Benzothiazoles Category:Phosphonate esters ",
