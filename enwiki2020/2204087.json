The main hypothesis is that it resulted from the combination of Bingo and the Disney film Bambi. Later, the founders discovered that children in Italian are called bimbo, while in Hungarian, the word means bud and the phoneme used in China to name it sounds very similar to bread. == Mascot and trademark == The corporate pet, a small polar bear, resulted from the drawing that came to Mr. Jaime Jorba in a Christmas card, and whom Anita Mata, wife of Jaime Sendra, dressed with a white apron and a chef's hat, given a loaf of bread under his arm. The company has made a few failed attempts to change this mascot with some characters like Gruba, a character from the Olocoons franchise.
