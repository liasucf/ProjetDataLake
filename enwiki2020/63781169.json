SNAPAP (SNARE-associated protein) has a role in the SNARE binding complex, and is also associated with Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome and tricuspid valve stenosis. HNRNPCL1 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein C Like 1) has a role in RNA binding and nucleosome assembly. == Clinical significance == C20orf202 has been associated by GWAS to multiple sclerosis. Additionally, through in silico analysis, C20orf202 was identified as being involved in chromosome 20p inv dup del syndrome, a syndrome similar to trisomy 20p. == References == Category:Human proteins ",
