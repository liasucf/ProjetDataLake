    "text": "Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon II was the fifth kingOsorkon (II) Usermaatre, Digital Egypt for Universities. of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Ancient Egypt and the son of King Takelot I and Queen Kapes. He ruled Egypt from approximately 872 BC to 837 BC from Tanis, the capital of that dynasty. After succeeding his father, Osorkon II was faced with the competing rule of his cousin, King Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Potentially, Harsiese's kingship could have posed a serious challenge to the authority of Osorkon, however, when Harsiese died in 860 BC, Osorkon II acted to ensure that no king would replace Harsiese. He appointed his son, Nimlot C, as the high priest of Amun at Thebes, which would have been the source for a successor to Harsiese. This consolidated the king's authority over Upper Egypt and thereafter, Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign was a time of prosperity for Egypt and large-scale monumental building ensued. ==Foreign policy and monumental program== Entrance to the Tomb of Osorkon II Despite his astuteness in dealings with matters at home, Osorkon II was forced to be aggressive on the international scene. The growing power of Assyria was accompanied with increased meddling in the affairs of Israel and Syria - territories well within Egypt's sphere of influence. Osorkon II devoted considerable resources into his building projects by adding to the temple of Bastet at Bubastis,Mohamed I. Bakr and Helmut Brandl, \"Bubastis and the Temple of Bastet\", in: M.I. Bakr, H. Brandl, and F. Kalloniatis (eds.), Egyptian Antiquities from Kufur Nigm and Bubastis. M.i.N. (Museums in the Nile Delta) 1, Cairo/Berlin 2010, pp. 27-36 which featured a substantial new hall decorated with scenes depicting his Sed festival and images of his queen, Karomama. Monumental construction during his reign also was performed at Thebes, Memphis, Tanis, and Leontopolis. Osorkon II also built Temple J at Karnak during the final years of his reign and it was decorated by his high priest, Takelot F (the future king, Takelot II). Takelot F was the son of the deceased high priest Nimlot C and, thus, Osorkon II's grandson. Now, all of Osorkon II's sizeable stone statues are known to be re- used works of earlier periods that merely were re-inscribed for Osorkon II, including the famous \"Cairo-Philadelphia statue of Osorkon II\".H.

(https://www.academia.edu/8241577/Bemerkungen_zur_Datierung_von_libyerzeitlichen_Statuen_aufgrund_stilistischer_Kriterien Osorkon II was the last great Twenty-second Dynasty king of Tanis, ruling Egypt from the Delta to Upper Egypt. His successor, Shoshenq III, lost the effective control of Middle and Upper Egypt that Osorkon II had assembled into a united Egypt. Many officials may be dated to the reign of Osorkon II. Ankhkherednefer was inspector of the palace, Paanmeny probably was his chief physician, Djeddjehutyiuefankh was the fourth prophet of Amun,Statue, Cairo CG 42206, 42207 and Bakenkhons was another prophet of Amun during his reign.Cairo CG 42213 ==Reign length== Statue of Osorkon II from the Temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, displayed in the National Museum of Beirut. Approximately 837 BC, Osorkon II died and he was buried in Tomb NRT I at Tanis. Currently, he is believed to have reigned for more than 30 years, rather than just 25 years as had been interpreted earlier. The celebration of his first Sed Jubilee previously was thought to have occurred in his Year 22, but the Heb Sed date in his Great Temple of Bubastis is damaged and also may be read as Year 30, as Edward Wente notes.Edward Wente, Review of Kenneth Kitchen's The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt c.1100-650 BC, JNES 35(1976), pp.275-278 The fact that this king's own grandson, Takelot F, served him as High Priest of Amun at Thebes-as the inscribed walls of Temple J prove - supports the hypothesis of a longer reign for Osorkon II. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Nile Level Text 14 (dated to Year 29 of an Usimare Setepenamun) belongs to Osorkon II on palaeographical grounds.Gerard Broekman, \"The Nile Level Records of the Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Dynasties in Karnak,\" JEA 88(2002), pp.174-178 This finding suggests that Osorkon II likely did celebrate his first Heb Sed in his Year 30 as was traditionally the case with other Libyan era kings, such as Shoshenq III and Shoshenq V. In addition, a Year 22 Stela from his reign preserves no mention of any Heb Sed celebrations in that year, as would be expected (see Von Beckerath, 'infra'). While Osorkon II's precise reign length is unknown, some Egyptologists, such as J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath - in his 1997 book Chronology of the Egyptian PharaohsJ\u00fcrgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen \u00c4gypten, MAS:Philipp von Zabern, (1997), p.98 & p.191 - and Aidan Dodson have suggested a range of between 38 and 39 years.Aidan Dodson, A new King Shoshenq confirmed?, GM 137(1993), p.58 However, these much higher figures are not verified by the current monumental evidence. Gerard Broekman gives Osorkon II a slightly shorter reign of 34 years.Gerard Broekman, 'The Reign of Takeloth II, a Controversial Matter,' GM 205(2005), pp.31 & 33 English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, in a 2006 \"Agypten und Levante\" article, now accepts that if Nile Level Text 14 is correctly attributed to Year 29 of Osorkon II, then the reference to Osorkon's Sed Festival jubilee should be amended from Year 22 to Year 30.Kenneth Kitchen, Agypten und Levante 16 (2006), p.299 point No.7 Kitchen suggests that Osorkon II would have died shortly afterward, in his Year 31.Kitchen, Agypten und Levante 16 (2006), p.301 section 16 Reliefs from the Tomb of Osorkon II ==Marriages and children== Osorkon II is known to have had at least four wives: * Queen Karomama is the best known of Osorkon's wives. Karomama was the mother of at least two sons and three daughters:Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100\u2013650 BC). 3rd ed. Warminster: Aris & Phillips Limited. 1996 * Isetemkheb is known to be the mother of a daughter named, Tjesbastperu, who was married to the High Priest of Ptah Takelot B.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 2004, * Djedmutesakh IV was the mother of the High Priest of Amun Nimlot C. Nimlot C was a son of Osorkon II and the father of Takelot F, who would become Takelot II. * Mutemhat was another of his wives. Other children of record included: * Prince Shoshenq D was High Priest of Ptah * Prince Hornakht was the High Priest of Amun in Tanis.Nos anc\u00eatres de l'Antiquit\u00e9, 1991. Christian Settipani, p.153 and 166 Osorkon II appointed Hornakht as the chief priest of Amun at Tanis to strengthen his authority in Lower Egypt; however, this was clearly a political move since Hornakht died prematurely before the age of ten.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.325 * Princess Tashakheper may have served as God's Wife of Amun during the reign of Takelot III * Princess Karomama C, who may be identical to Karomama Meritmut, a God's Wife of Amun * Princess Taiirmer Other possible children attributed to Osorkon II include his successor Shoshenq III and the King's Daughter Tentsepeh (D), the wife of General Ptahudjankhef, who was a son of Nimlot C and hence, a grandson of Osorkon II. ==Tomb== Interior photograph of the tomb of Osorkon II The French excavator Pierre Montet discovered Osorkon II's plundered royal tomb at Tanis on February 27, 1939. It revealed that Osorkon II was buried in a massive granite sarcophagus with a lid carved from a Ramesside-era statue. Only some fragments of a hawk-headed coffin and canopic jars remained in the robbed tomb to identify him. While the tomb had been looted in antiquity, what jewellery that remained \"was of such high quality that existing conceptions of the wealth of the northern Twenty-first and Twenty-second dynasties had to be revised.\"Bob Brier, Egyptian Mummies: Unravelling the Secrets of an Ancient Art, William Morrow & Company Inc., New York, 1994. p.144 ==Successor== David Aston has argued in a JEA 75 (1989) paper that Osorkon II was succeeded by Shoshenq III at Tanis rather than Takelot II Si-Ese as Kitchen presumed because none of Takelot II's monuments have been found in Lower Egypt where other genuine Tanite kings, such as Osorkon II, Shoshenq III, and even the short-lived Pami (at 6-7 years) are attested on donation stelas, temple walls, and annal documents.Aston, pp.139-153 Other Egyptologists, such as Gerard Broekman, Karl Jansen-Winkeln, Aidan Dodson, and J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath have endorsed this position as well. Von Beckerath also identifies Shoshenq III as the immediate successor of Osorkon II and places Takelot II as a separate king in Upper Egypt.J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath, \"Chronologie des Pharaonischen \u00c4gypten,\" M\u00c4S 46 (Philipp von Zabern), Mainz: 1997. p.94 Gerard Broekman writes in a recent 2005 GM article that, \"in light of the monumental and genealogical evidence\", Aston's chronology for the position of the twenty-second dynasty kings \"is highly preferable\" to Kitchen's chronology.Gerard Broekman, 'The Reign of Takeloth II, a Controversial Matter,' GM 205(2005), pp.31 The only documents that mention a king Takelot in Lower Egypt, such as a royal tomb at Tanis, a Year 9 donation stela from Bubastis, and a heart scarab featuring the nomen 'Takelot Meryamun' -- now have been attributed exclusively to king Takelot I by Egyptologists today, including Kitchen.K.A. Kitchen, in the introduction to his 3rd 1996 edition of \"The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (c.1100-650 BC),\" Aris & Phillips Ltd. pp.xxxii-xxxiii The English Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, in his book The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt, observes that Shoshenq III built \"a dividing wall, with a double scene showing Osorkon II\" and him \"each adoring an unnamed deity\" in the antechamber of Osorkon II's tomb.Aidan Dodson, \"The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt,\" (Kegan Paul Intl: 1994), p.95 Dodson concludes that while one may argue Shoshenq III erected the wall to hide Osorkon II's sarcophagus, it made no sense for Shoshenq to create such an elaborate relief if Takelot II really had intervened between him and Osorkon II at Tanis for 25 years, unless Shoshenq III was Osorkon II's immediate successor. Shoshenq III must, hence, have wished to associate himself with his predecessor - Osorkon II.Dodson, The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt, p.95 Consequently, the case for establishing Takelot II as a Twenty-second Dynasty king and successor to Osorkon II disappears, as Dodson writes. Takelot II instead founded the twenty-third dynasty of Egypt and ruled a divided Egypt by administering Middle and Upper Egypt. ==References== ==Further reading== * Bernard V.
