    "text": "was a Japanese film director and screenwriter who played a central role in the development of the modern jidaigeki and samurai cinema. ==Career== Born in Ehime Prefecture, It\u014d joined the actors school at Sh\u014dchiku in 1920, but soon began writing screenplays under the recommendation of Kaoru Osanai. He made his directorial debut in 1924 at Teikoku Kinema with Shuch\u016b nikki. After trying to start his own production company, he settled at Nikkatsu and established his name in 1927 with the three-part Ch\u016bji tabi nikki, which is considered one of the masterpieces of jidaigeki. Especially in the silent era, he was known for a very mobile camera style that earned him the nickname \"Id\u014d daisuki\" (Loves Motion), which is a pun on his name. The heroes of his films, such as Tange Sazen and Kunisada Ch\u016bji, were often disaffected, nihilistic loners and thus It\u014d's early films were sometimes considered tendency films. He was criticized, however, for being more of a stylist than a thematically committed filmmaker. While being a director who was less successful after the coming of sound, It\u014d worked with many great jidaigeki stars, especially Denjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi, Yorozuya Kinnosuke, Raiz\u014d Ichikawa, and Tsumasabur\u014d Band\u014d at studios such as Nikkatsu and Daiei, in a career that spanned nearly half a century. In 1991, a partial print of Ch\u016bji tabi nikki, long considered a lost film, was discovered and screened for the public. ==Selected filmography== * Ch\u014dkon (\u9577\u6068) (1926) * Ch\u016bji tabi nikki (\u5fe0\u6b21\u65c5\u65e5\u8a18) (1927) * Shinpan \u014coka seidan (\u65b0\u7248\u5927\u5ca1\u653f\u8ac7) (1928) * Chikemuri Takadanobaba (\u8840\u7159\u9ad8\u7530\u99ac\u5834) (1929) * Zanjin zanbaken (\u65ac\u4eba\u65ac\u99ac\u5263) (1928) *Jirokichi the Rat (\u5fa1\u8a82\u6cbb\u90ce\u5409\u683c\u5b50 Oatsurae Jir\u014dkichi k\u014dshi ) (1931) *\u014csh\u014d (\u738b\u5c06) (1948) *The Gay Masquerade (\u5f01\u5929\u5c0f\u50e7 Benten Koz\u014d) (1958) *Scar Yosaburo (\u5207\u3089\u308c\u4e0e\u4e09\u90ce Kirare Yosabur\u014d) (1960) *Hangyakuji (\u53cd\u9006\u5150) (1961) *Bakumatsu (1970) ==References== == External links == * * Category:Japanese film directors Category:Japanese screenwriters Category:Samurai film directors Category:1898 births Category:1981 deaths Category:People from Uwajima, Ehime Category:Silent film directors Category:Silent film screenwriters Category:20th-century screenwriters ",
