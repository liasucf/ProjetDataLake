    "text": "Julie Anne Legate is a linguist who works in the areas of syntax and morphology. Her work investigates the structural representation of voice in syntax, beginning with a focus on Acehnese, a language spoken in Indonesia, but also including evidence from structures in Celtic, Scandinavian, and Slavic, broadening current cross-linguistic understanding of passive-like constructions. Legate earned her B.A. from York University in 1995 and her M.A. from the University of Toronto (1997). She received her PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2002, writing a dissertation on the Warlpiri language, under the supervision of Noam Chomsky and Sabine Iatridou.MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dm/theses/legate02.pdfPylkk\u00e4nen, Liina. 2008.
