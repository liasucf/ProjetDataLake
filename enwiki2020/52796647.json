The Society of Jesus resumed its educational work in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares with the opening of the school in 1953. == History == The history of Colegio San Ignacio began in 1955 with the construction of a school of philosophy for Jesuits studying for the priesthood; the primary school had preceded it in 1953. With the arrival of the philosophate came the Jesuit archives, which since 2014 have included most of the archival materials of the Jesuits in Spain. The present building was opened in 1971 when the school of philosophy moved to Madrid. The school includes early childhood, primary, and ESO, as well as vocational training in electricity and electronics. There are 532 students served by 42 teachers. In 1970 the future Pope Francis would stay with the Jesuit fathers in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares while completing his final year of spiritual studies leading to solemn profession of vows in the Society of Jesus. thumb ==Further reading== * Manuel Serrano y Sanz, San Ignacio De Loyola En Alcal\u00e1 De Henares: Estudio Hist\u00f3rico, South Carolina: Nabu Press, 2012, 58 pp. ==References== Category:Schools in Madrid Category:Jesuit secondary schools in Spain Category:Catholic schools in Spain Category:Secondary schools in Spain Category:Jesuit secondary schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1955 ",
