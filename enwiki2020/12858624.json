Its only species Ascoglossum calopterum is endemic to Dinagat Island in the southern Philippines, and is critically endangered by collection as an ornamental plant and habitat loss. Flowers are a vivid purple. Plant growth is similar to Renanthera. Based on research published by Kochyan & Schuit. in Phytotaxa 161 (2014) 68, The Royal Horticultural Society considers the species as Renanthera caloptera for hybrid registration purposes.http://www.orchidsnewguinea.com/orchid- information/species/speciescode/1675 Before that 2014 taxonomic revision,Ascoglossum formed several different intergeneric hybrids (nothogenera): {|class=wikitable | (Ren.) || Renanthoglossum (Rngm.) |- | (Aer.) || Nonaara (Non.) |- | || Ngara (Ngara) |- | || Ascoparanthera (Apn.) |- | (Phal.) || Dresslerara (Dres.) |- | || Lauara (Lauara) |- | || Sheehanara (Shn.) |- | || Pantapaara (Pntp.) |- | || Freedara (Fdra.) |} Orchid hybrids are registered with The International Register at the Royal Horticultural Society. One primary hybrid was originated and registered by A.Kolopaking in 1989 as Renanthoglossum Nina Rach (). As of 2014, this is classified as Renanthera Nina Rach http://apps.rhs.org.uk/horticulturaldatabase/orchidregister/orchiddetails.asp?ID=78251 == References == Category:Aeridinae Category:Vandeae genera Category:Monotypic Epidendroideae genera Category:Epiphytic orchids Category:Endemic orchids of the Philippines Category:Critically endangered flora of Asia Category:Flora of Mindanao Category:Species endangered by the pet trade Category:Species endangered by logging Category:Species endangered by slash-and-burn Category:Species endangered by urbanization Category:Species endangered by habitat fragmentation Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
