    "text": "In study of partial differential equations, particularly fluid dynamics, a self-similar solution is a form of solution which is similar to itself if the independent and dependent variables are appropriately scaled. The self-similar solution appears whenever the problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale (for example, self-similar solution describes Blasius boundary layer of an infinite plate, but not the finite-length plate). These include, for example, the Blasius boundary layer or the Sedov-Taylor shell.Gratton, J. (1991). Similarity and self similarity in fluid dynamics. Fundamentals of Cosmic Physics, 15, 1-106.Barenblatt, Grigory Isaakovich. Scaling, self- similarity, and intermediate asymptotics: dimensional analysis and intermediate asymptotics. Vol. 14. Cambridge University Press, 1996. ==Concept== A powerful tool in physics is the concept of dimensional analysis and scaling laws. By examining the physical effects present in a system, we may estimate their size and hence which, for example, might be neglected. In some cases, the system may not have a fixed natural lengthscale (timescale) while the solution depends on space (time). It is then necessary to construct a lengthscale (timescale) using space (time) and the other dimensional quantities present - such as the viscosity u. These constructs are not 'guessed' but are derived immediately from the scaling of the governing equations. ==Classification== The normal self-similar solution is also referred to as self-similar solution of the first kind since another type of self-similar exists for finite-sized problems, which cannot be derived from dimensional analysis, known as self-similar solution of the second kind. The discovery of solution of the second kind was due to Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich, who also named it as second kind in 1956.Zeldovich, Y. B. (1956). The motion of a gas under the action of a short term pressure shock. Akust. zh, 2(1), 28-38. A complete description was made in 1972 by Grigory Barenblatt and Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich.Barenblatt, G. I., & Zel'Dovich, Y. B. (1972). Self-similar solutions as intermediate asymptotics. Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 4(1), 285-312. The self-similar solution of the second kind also appears in different contextsCoenen, W., Rajamanickam, P., Weiss, A. D., S\u00e1nchez, A. L., & Williams, F. A. (2019). Swirling flow induced by jets and plumes. Acta Mechanica, 230(6), 2221-2231. such as in boundary-layer problems subjected to small perturbations, as was identified by Keith StewartsonStewartson, K. (1957). On asymptotic expansions in the theory of boundary layers. Journal of Mathematics and Physics, 36(1-4), 173-191., Paul A. Libby and Herbert FoxLibby, P. A., & Fox, H. (1963). Some perturbation solutions in laminar boundary-layer theory. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 17(3), 433-449.. Moffatt eddies are also a self-similar solution of the second kind. ==Example - Rayleigh problem == A simple example is a semi-infinite domain bounded by a rigid wall and filled with viscous fluid.Batchelor (2006 edition), An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics, p189 At time t=0 the wall is made to move with constant speed U in a fixed direction (for definiteness, say the x direction and consider only the x-y plane), one can see that there is no distinguished length scale given in the problem. This is known as the Rayleigh problem. The boundary conditions of no-slip is u = U on y = 0 Also, the condition that the plate has no effect on the fluid at infinity is enforced as u \\rightarrow 0 as y \\rightarrow \\infty . Now, from the Navier-Stokes equations \\rho \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + \\vec{u} \\cdot abla \\vec{u} \\right) =- abla p + \\mu abla^{2} \\vec{u} one can observe that this flow will be rectilinear, with gradients in the y direction and flow in the x direction, and that the pressure term will have no tangential component so that \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0. The x component of the Navier-Stokes equations then becomes \\dfrac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} = u \\partial^{2}_{y} \\vec{u} and the scaling arguments can be applied to show that \\frac{U}{t} \\sim u \\frac{U}{y^{2}} which gives the scaling of the y co-ordinate as y \\sim ( u t)^{1/2}. This allows one to pose a self-similar ansatz such that, with f and \\eta dimensionless, u = U f \\left( \\eta \\equiv \\dfrac{y}{( u t)^{1/2}} \\right) The above contains all the relevant physics and the next step is to solve the equations, which for many cases will include numerical methods. This equation is \\- \\eta f'/2 = f with solution satisfying the boundary conditions that f = 1 - \\operatorname{erf} (\\eta / 2) or u = U \\left(1 - \\operatorname{erf} \\left(- y / (4 u t)^{1/2} \\right)\\right) which is a self-similar solution of the first kind. ==References== Category:Fluid dynamics ",
