After his death in 1911, a posthumous exhibition was held at the Warsaw \"Zach\u0119ta\" Society of Fine Arts.

Of these, Juliet's Funeral (1873), Hamlet (1873), and, most notably, Hamlet Receiving the Players (1875), were widely recognized as his greatest works. :\"The hallmark of Czachorski's style, however, and the basis of his fame, are his images of beautiful young women in rich interiors, painted with great realism. He has long been regarded a master of rendering fabrics, jewelry and other details to create the atmosphere of luxury and elegance.\" His paintings can be found in all the more famous and larger museums of Poland. His works also make appearances in private collections in many countries including: Germany(Bremen), England and the United States.
