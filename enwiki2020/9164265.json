    "text": "Heinrich Haussler (born 25 February 1984) is an Australian road racing cyclist of German heritage, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam . He has won 2 stages in Grand Tours during his career, one at the 2005 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and another at the 2009 Tour de France. He is also a good Classics specialist, registering top results in notable classic races, and was the 2015 Australian national road race champion. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Haussler was born to a German father and Australian mother and raised in the town of Inverell, New South Wales, Australia, before leaving for Germany in 1998 at age 14 to pursue a dream of being a professional cyclist. ===Professional career=== Haussler turned professional in 2005 and shot to prominence with a stage win in the 2005 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. Haussler took out five wins in 2006 and has had strong classics campaigns since then. He looked set to be a rider of the future in the classics, in 2009 coming in second in both the Tour of Flanders and Milan\u2013San Remo, narrowly beaten in the latter by Mark Cavendish in a photo-finish. He also finished a strong 7th in the 2009 edition of Paris\u2013Roubaix. Haussler's biggest victory so far was the win of Stage 13 in 2009 Tour de France. Haussler lived in Cottbus starting in 1998, and in 2009 in Freiburg im Breisgau. Haussler riding in the Australian national champion's jersey in the 2015 Giro d'Italia A dual Australian/German national, Haussler originally raced under a German license. However, in a 2008 interview on CyclingNews.com, he suggested that he would no longer race for Germany as he wished to compete for Australia in the 2010 UCI Road World Championships in Melbourne. When asked what he would do if chosen to race for Germany in the 2008 UCI Road World Championships or at the 2008 Olympics he stated, \"I wouldn't take it. If you start for a country at the worlds there is a three year ban before you can ride for another.\" The UCI, however, insisted that if Haussler wanted to ride for Australia he would have to give up his German citizenship, which the cyclist said in a November 2009 interview \"is not open for debate at the moment\".http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/haussler-still- hopes-to-ride-for-australia-one-day In July 2010, the Cerv\u00e9lo Test Team announced that Haussler would indeed give up his German citizenship and will ride for Australia in the future. However, a nagging knee injury forced Haussler out of what would have been his international cycling debut for his birth country at the 2010 World Championships.http://www.cervelo.com/en_us/news-blog/article/haussler-to-skip- world-championships/2502/ On 26 August 2010, Haussler's employer, Cerv\u00e9lo Test Team, confirmed rumors that it would cease to exist after the end of the current season.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cervelo-confirms-it-will-end- cycling-team/ On 1 September 2010, it was announced he would be joining the for 2011.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/garmin-confirm-six-more-signings- from-cervelo-for-2011 In the 2012 Tour of California, Haussler was denied victory on the four first stages of the race by Peter Sagan of the squad, who beat him to the line each time. He would have to settle for second on every one of those stages. Haussler left at the end of the 2012 season, and joined the new team for the 2013 season. In 2015 he won the Australian National Road Race Championships for the first time in his career. ==Major results== ;2002 : 1st 20px Time trial, German National Junior Road Championships ;2005 : 1st Stage 19 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : 3rd Overall Sachsen Tour : 7th Overall Niedersachsen\u2013Rundfahrt : 7th Z\u00fcri-Metzgete ;2006 : Vuelta a Murcia ::1st Points classification ::1st Stages 1 & 5 : Circuit Franco-Belge ::1st Stages 2 & 4 : 1st Stage 3 Rheinland\u2013Pfalz Rundfahrt : 3rd Trofeo Mallorca : 6th Cl\u00e1sica de Almer\u00eda ;2007 : 1st Stage 1 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 : 4th Overall Niedersachsen\u2013Rundfahrt ::1st Stage 5 : 10th Rund um den Henninger Turm ;2008 : 1st Stage 1 Bayern\u2013Rundfahrt : 9th Gent\u2013Wevelgem ;2009 : 1st GP Triberg-Schwarzwald : Tour de France ::1st Stage 13 ::20px Combativity award Stage 13 : Volta ao Algarve ::1st Stages 1 & 5 : 1st Stage 2 Paris\u2013Nice : 2nd Overall Tour of Qatar ::1st 20px Sprints classification ::1st 20px Young rider classification : 2nd Milan\u2013San Remo : 2nd Tour of Flanders : 2nd Neuseen Classics : 3rd Grand Prix of Aargau Canton : 4th Dwars door Vlaanderen : 4th Sparkassen Giro Bochum : 6th Overall Tour du Poitou-Charentes ::1st Stage 5 : 6th Paris\u2013Roubaix : 8th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad ;2010 : 1st Stage 2 Tour de Suisse : 2nd Omloop Het Nieuwsblad : 3rd Grand Prix of Aargau Canton : 9th Overall Tour of Qatar ::1st 20px Sprints classification ;2011 : 1st Stage 2 Tour of Beijing : 1st 20px Points classification Paris\u2013Nice : 2nd Overall Tour of Qatar ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stages 2 & 3 : 7th E3 Prijs Vlaanderen ;2012 : 3rd GP Ouest\u2013France : 4th Omloop Het Nieuwsblad : 7th Vattenfall Cyclassics ;2013 : 1st Stage 5 Bayern\u2013Rundfahrt : 4th Gent\u2013Wevelgem : 4th Paris\u2013Bourges : 6th Tour of Flanders : 6th Paris\u2013Tours ;2014 : 1st Stage 1 Bayern\u2013Rundfahrt : 3rd Grand Prix d'Isbergues : 5th Paris\u2013Tours ;2015 : 1st 20px Road race, Australian National Road Championships : 5th Down Under Classic : 7th Paris\u2013Tours : 8th Overall Tour of Qatar : 9th Grand Prix of Aargau Canton : 10th Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race ;2016 : 6th Paris\u2013Roubaix : 7th Milan\u2013San Remo ;2019 : 10th Dwars door Vlaanderen ;2020 : 5th Overall Tour of Saudi Arabia ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !
