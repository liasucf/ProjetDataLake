    "text": "Phi Virginis (\u03c6 Virginis, abbreviated Phi Vir, \u03c6 Vir) is a binary star in the zodiac constellation of Virgo. It can be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of +4.81. Based upon parallax measurements obtained during the Hipparcos mission, it is located roughly distant from the Sun. The two components are designated Phi Virginis A (officially named Elgafar , the traditional name for the system) and B. == Nomenclature == \u03c6 Virginis (Latinised to Phi Virginis) is the binary's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Phi Virginis A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Ideler described an Arabic lunar mansion \"El-\u0121afr\" (Arabic \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0641\u0631 al-ghafr) for the stars Phi, Iota and Kappa Virginis. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Elgafar for the component Phi Virginis A on 1 June 2018 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Neck, refers to an asterism consisting of Phi Virginis, Kappa Virginis, Iota Virginis, and Lambda Virginis. \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.

Consequently, Phi Virginis itself is known as (), \"the Third Star of Neck\". \u9999\u6e2f\u592a\u7a7a\u9928 - \u7814\u7a76\u8cc7\u6e90 - \u4eae\u661f\u4e2d\u82f1\u5c0d\u7167\u8868 , Hong Kong Space Museum. Accessed on line November 23, 2010. == Properties == The primary component, Phi Virginis A, has a stellar classification of G2 IV, indicating that it is a G-type subgiant which is evolving away from the main sequence. It is slightly variable with an amplitude of 0m.06. The star has about 1.8 times the mass of the Sun, 4 times the Sun's radius, and shines with 12.6 times the luminosity of the Sun. It is around 1.5 billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 15.5 km/s. The effective temperature of the star's outer atmosphere is 5,534 K. The secondary, Phi Virginis B, is a magnitude 9.10 companion at an angular separation of 5.160 arcseconds. A second visual companion lies at an angular separation of 91.40 arcseconds along a position angle of 202\u00b0, as of 2000. The system is a source of X-ray emission with a luminosity of . ==References== Category:G-type subgiants Category:Virgo (constellation) Category:Binary stars Virginis, Upsilon Virginis, 102 122408 070755 5409 Category:Gliese and GJ objects BD-01 2957 ",
