    "text": "Wuj\u016bd () is an Arabic word typically translated to mean existence, presence, being, substance, or entity. However, in the religion of Islam, it tends to take on a deeper meaning. It has been said that everything gains its wuj\u016bd by being found or perceived by God.Schimmel, AnneMarie. Mystical Dimensions of Islam. USA: University of North Carolina, 1975. p 142, 267 ==Sufi view== For those of the Sufi tradition, wuj\u016bd has more to do with the finding of God than the existence of God. Although wuj\u016bd is commonly translated as \"existence\", its original meaning is the \"being found\". This \"being found\" is sometimes described as the final stage of fanaa in which one is immersed in the existence or finding of God while all else is annihilated. \"For a Sufi, beyond the realization of the annihilation of the state of nonexistence, there is nothing except existence. There is nothing beyond this nothingness except survival and nothing in death but life. This annihilation implies eternal reunion, as well as existence in full positivity and glory.\"Kamal, Muhammad. \"The Self and the Other in Sufi Thought.\" Religion East & West 6 (2006): 21-32. ==Relation to Wajd== Wajd can be translated to mean 'ecstasy'. Wujud (which is described as ecstatic existentiality in this instance) is said to occur only after one goes beyond wajd. In other words, ecstasy does not lead to anything other than Being. Wajd and Wujud can be better understood in terms of tawhid as well. Tawhid (or doctrine of Oneness of God) is described as a beginning and wujud as an end, with wajd being an intermediary between the two. Abu 'Ali ad-Daqqaq further explains: \"Tawh\u012bd entails the encompassing of the servant. Ecstasy (wajd) entails the immersion of the servant. Wujud entails the extinction of the servant.\u201dSells, Michael A., ed. Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi`Raj, Poetic and Theological Writings. Mahwah, NJ: Paulist, 1996. p 113, 121, 131, 254 The Sufis believe that anyone who experiences wajd brings back some residual knowledge from the object of his finding (wujud). Also, when one gains knowledge from experience, one must attempt to find a contraction to balance it. If one fails to do so, one remains at a lower level of knowledge.Singh, David E. \"The Possibility of Having Knowledge of Al-wuj\u016bd Al-mahd 'sheer Being' According to Ibn 'Arab\u012b S Kit\u0101b Al-jal\u0101l Wa-al-jam\u0101l.\" Islam & Christian-Muslim Relations 10.3 (1999): 295. ==Philosophical view== Ab\u016b l-Q\u0101sim al-Junayd reflects on existence by explaining: \u201cWhen he seizes me with fear, he annihilates me from myself through my existence, then preserves me from myself... Through being made present I taste the flavor of my existence.\u201d He also states \u201cThe wujud (finding, experience, ecstasy, existence) of the real occurs though the loss of your self\u201d The self is another major part of existence in Islamic philosophy. Many claim that the existence of the self is proof for the existence of the Other. This 'Other' is said to be the only Reality, meaning that \u201cwhatever 'is' other than the Other is nonexistent.\u201d As 'Abd al-Kar\u012bm ibn Haw\u0101zin al-Qushayr\u012b puts it: \u201cThe first passing away is the passing away of the self and its attributes to endure through the attributes of the real. Then there is the passing away from the attributes of the real through witnessing of the real. Then there is a person's passing away from witnessing his own passing away through his perishing in the ecstatic existentiality (wujud) of the real\u201d There is also the view that there are two kinds of Being, corporeal and spiritual. Or, \u201cone which is moved and one which causes motion, though itself unmoved\u201d De Boer, T.J. The History of Philosophy in Islam. Trans. Edward R. Jones. New York: Dover, 1967. p 119, 193, 194 It should also be noted that there is a higher kind of existence in understanding than in objects as well. ==Wahdat al-wuj\u016bd== Wahdat al-wuj\u016bd or 'unity of being' can mean that \"there is only one Being, and all existence is nothing but the manifestation or outward radiance of that One Being\". ==Quotes== \u201cExistence is not an inherent quality of essence, but only a predicate or an accident of essence\u201d Corbin, Henry. History of Islamic Philosophy. Trans. Liadain Sherrard. London: Kegan Paul International, 1993. p 160 \u201cAbsolute Majesty-Beauty, like sheer being-sheer possibility, forms the totality of wujud\u201d ==References== Category:Islamic theology Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Islamic terminology ar:\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f ",
