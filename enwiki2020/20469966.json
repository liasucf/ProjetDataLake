    "text": "Bookclub is a monthly programme, devised by Olivia Seligman and hosted by Jim Naughtie and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Each month a novel is selected, and its author invited to discuss it. The title of the chosen work for the next recording is announced at the end of each broadcast; this allows listeners to read the book in advance, and those who attend recording to prepare questions which they can then put to the author. ==See also== * Books in the United Kingdom ==External links== * *Bookclub at RadioListings.co.uk Category:BBC Radio 4 programmes ",
