    "text": "TGK PG () is an automated cargo spacecraft project to replace Progress-MS as the Russian logistic vehicle to the ISS. It was requested for development to take advantage of the increased lift capacity of the Soyuz-2.1b. The initial development contract was awarded to RSC Energia by Roscosmos on December 11, 2015. The spacecraft is not expected to fly before 2020. ==Spacecraft description== Born out of the need to reduce the flights to the ISS from 2018 onward, it was designed as a radical departure from the Progress design. It would incorporate concepts and technologies developed from the Orel and Progress-MS projects. One critical characteristic would be a 370 days on-orbit design life, compared to the 210 days of the Progress and Soyuz. This would allow less ships to be launched per year while maintaining a full complement on the station. It would consist of a service module on the aft, an unpressurized propellant cluster of six tanks on the center, a pressurized module with docking adapter on the fore and a truss structure connecting all the parts. It would use the reaction control system of the Progress-MS and an orbital manoeuvring rocket engine already developed for another spacecraft. The new design would have a single deposit of propellant that could be used by the spacecraft or to refuel the space station. ==See also== * Comparison of space station cargo vehicles ** Progress spacecraft \u2013 an expendable cargo vehicle currently in use by the Russian Federal Space Agency ** Automated Transfer Vehicle \u2013 a retired expendable cargo vehicle used by the ESA ** Cygnus spacecraft \u2013 an expendable cargo vehicle developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation under American CRS program, currently in use. ** H-II Transfer Vehicle \u2013 a retired expendable cargo vehicle used by JAXA ** Dragon 2 cargo spacecraft - a reusable cargo vehicle developed by SpaceX, under American CRS program, currently in use. ** Dream Chaser Cargo System - a cargo variant of the reusable SNC's spaceplane == References == == External links == * RussianSpaceWeb TGK PG Category:Proposed spacecraft Category:Cargo spacecraft Category:Space program of Russia ",
