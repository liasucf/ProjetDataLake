After realizing they shared a common love for vocal harmonies and American roots music, Tuomo & Markus started periodically performing and writing together. The new songs led to recording sessions at Wavelab Recording Studio in Tucson Arizona. These sessions also featured various notable American musicians including Joey Burns, John Convertino and Jacob Valenzuela from Tucson-based Calexico, Wilco members John Stirratt and Pat Sansone as well as Gary Louris from the Jayhawks who also contributed one song on the album Tuomo & Markus' debut album Dead Circles ended up taking almost four years to complete.
