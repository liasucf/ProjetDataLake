The school in Templin was closed in 1956 and the building was used for other purposes until 1996. Since then, it has been empty and is in danger of decay. In 2005, the school was refounded in Joachimsthal. In 2013, there was an initiative to re- establish the school as a boarding school in Templin. On 6 December 2018, the Board of Governors of the European Schools, representing the 28 Education Ministers of the EU Member States, decided to begin the accreditation process for a \"European School Templin\" (EST), now expected to open in 2023. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Boarding schools in Germany Category:Gymnasiums in Germany Category:Educational institutions established in the 1600s Category:Schools in Brandenburg Category:Accredited European Schools ",
