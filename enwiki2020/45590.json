This 13th-century sovereign was named after the 8th-century Emperor Saga and go- (\u5f8c), translates literally as \"later\"; and thus, he is sometimes called the \"Later Emperor Saga\". The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the \"second one;\" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as \"Saga, the second\", or as \"Saga II\". ==Genealogy== Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was .Titsingh, p. 245; Varley, p.228.

When Emperor Tsuchimikado moved to Tosa Province (on Shikoku), he was raised by his mother's side of the family. Because of the sudden death of Emperor Shij\u014d at the age of 10, the question of succession arose. Because the expectations of the court nobility and the Bakufu conflicted, the issue was bitterly contested. Kuj\u014d Michiie and the court nobility supported Prince Tadanari (\u5fe0\u6210\u738b), a son of Retired Emperor Juntoku, but the shikken H\u014dj\u014d Yasutoki was opposed to the sons of Juntoku because of his involvement in the J\u014dky\u016b War. Michiie instead supported Tsuchimikado's son Prince Kunihito as a neutral figure for Emperor. During these negotiations, there was a vacancy on the throne of 11 days. * 11 February 1242 (Ninji 3, 10th day of the 1st month): In the 10th year of Shij\u014d- tenn\u014d 's reign (\u56db\u6761\u5929\u768710\u5e74), the emperor died suddenly; and despite a dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (senso)Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jit\u014d, Y\u014dzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. was received by the second son of former Emperor Tsuchimikado.Titsingh, pp. 244\u2013245; Varley, p. 228. * 19 April 1242 (Ninji 3, 18th day of the 3rd month): Emperor Go-Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, p. 245; Varley, p. 44. In 1242, Prince Kunihito became emperor. In 1246 he abdicated to his son, Emperor Go-Fukakusa, beginning his reign as cloistered emperor. In 1259, he compelled Emperor Go- Fukakusa to abdicate to his younger brother, Emperor Kameyama. Imperial Prince Munetaka became sh\u014dgun instead of the H\u014dj\u014d regents. Henceforth, the sh\u014dguns of the Kamakura Bakufu came from the imperial house. Still, the H\u014dj\u014d regents increased their control of the shogunate, setting up the system of rule by regents. The descendants of his two sons contested the throne between them, forming into two lines, the Jimy\u014din-t\u014d (Go-Fukakusa's descendants) and the Daikakuji-t\u014d (Kameyama's descendants). Their lines would eventually lead to the split between the Northern and Southern Courts. temple and mausoleum honoring Empress Go-Saga In 1272, Go-Saga died. Go-Saga's final resting place is designated as an Imperial mausoleum (misasagi) at Saa no minami no Misasagi at Tenry\u016b-ji in Kyoto.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 423. ==Kugy\u014d== is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.
