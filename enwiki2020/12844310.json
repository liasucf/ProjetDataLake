Poetry in Slovene language achieved its highest level with the Romantic poet France Pre\u0161eren (1800\u20131849). In the 20th century, the Slovene literary fiction went through several periods: the beginning of the century was marked by the authors of the Slovene Modernism, with the most influential Slovene writer and playwright, Ivan Cankar; it was then followed by expressionism (Sre\u010dko Kosovel), avantgardism (Anton Podbev\u0161ek, Ferdo Delak) and social realism (Ciril Kosma\u010d, Pre\u017eihov Voranc) before World War II, the poetry of resistance and revolution (Karel Destovnik Kajuh, Matej Bor) during the war, and intimism (Poems of the Four, 1953), post-war modernism (Edvard Kocbek), and existentialism (Dane Zajc) after the war. Short stories became a popular genre after the 1990s. There are several Slovene literary magazines that publish prose, poetry, essays, and local literary criticism. ===Children's literature and poetry=== ==Music== ===Classical music=== Music of Slovenia historically includes numerous musicians and composers, such as the Renaissance composer Jacobus Gallus (1550\u20131591), who greatly influenced Central European classical music and the Baroque composer Janez Krstnik Dolar (ca. 1620\u20131673). During the medieval era, secular music was as popular as church music, including wandering minnesingers. By the time of Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize. The first Slovenian hymnal, Eni Psalmi, was published in 1567. This period saw the rise of musicians like Jacobus Gallus and Jurij Slatkonja.Oto Luthar The land between: a history of Slovenia In 1701, Johann Berthold von H\u00f6ffer (1667\u20131718), a nobleman and amateur composer from Ljubljana, founded the Academia Philharmonicorum Labacensis, as one of the oldest such institutions in Europe, based on Italian models.George J. Buelow (2004) A history of baroque music, p.701 Composers of Slovenian Lieder and art songs include Emil Adami\u010d (1877\u20131936), Fran Gerbi\u010d (1840\u20131917), Alojz Ger\u017eini\u010d (1915\u20132008), Benjamin Ipavec (1829\u20131908), Davorin Jenko (1835\u20131914), Anton Lajovic (1878\u20131960), Kamilo Ma\u0161ek (1831\u20131859), Josip Pav\u010di\u010d (1870\u20131949), Zorko Prelovec (1887\u20131939), and Lucijan Marija \u0160kerjanc (1900\u20131973). In the early 20th century, impressionism was spreading across Slovenia, which soon produced composers Marij Kogoj and Slavko Osterc. Avant-garde classical music arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of Uro\u0161 Krek, Dane \u0160kerl, Primo\u017e Ramov\u0161 and Ivo Petri\u0107, who also conducted the Slavko Osterc Ensemble. Jakob Je\u017e, Darijan Bo\u017ei\u010d, Lojze Lebi\u010d and Vinko Globokar have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's L'Armonia, an opera. Modern composers include Uro\u0161 Rojko, Toma\u017e Svete, Brina Je\u017e-Brezav\u0161\u010dek, Bo\u017eidar Kantu\u0161er and Aldo Kumar. Kumar's Sonata z igro 12 (A sonata with a play 12), a set of variations on a rising chromatic scale, is particularly notable. ===Opera=== The Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre serves as the national opera and ballet house. ===Film music=== The composer of film scoress for 170 films was Bojan Adami\u010d (1912\u20131995). ===Folk music=== ====Vocal==== Harmony singing is a deep rooted tradition in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. ====Instrumental==== Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, zithers, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In eastern Slovenia, fiddle and cimbalon bands are called velike goslarije. ====Slovenian country music==== Folk musician Lojze Slak From 1952 on, the Slavko Avsenik's band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the West Germany, inventing the original \"Oberkrainer\" country sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and in the Benelux, spawning hundreds of Alpine orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the Slovenian-style polka legacy. Avsenik's most popular instrumental composition is the polka that is titled \"Na Golici\" (in Slovene), or \"Trompetenecho\" (in German), and \"Trumpet Echoes\" (in English). Oberkrainer music, which the Avsenik Ensemble popularized, is always a strong candidate for country (folk) music awards in Slovenia and Austria. Many musicians followed Avsenik's steps, one of the most famous being Lojze Slak. ===Slovenska popevka=== A similarly high standing in Slovene culture, like the Sanremo Music Festival has had in Italian culture, was attributed to the Slovenska popevka, a specific genre of popular Slovene music.Slovenska popevka: velik poudarek na pevcih in skladateljih, pesniki bolj v oklepaju. Enkrat \u0161e zapoj: 50 let Slovenske popevke Vladimirja Frantarja pri celjski Mohorjevi dru\u017ebi., Delo, 5. September 2012. ===Popular music=== Among pop, rock, industrial, and indie musicians the most popular in Slovenia include Laibach, an early 1980s industrial music group, and most recently the Slovenian pop a cappella band Perpetuum Jazzile. ====Pop, rock, metal, and indie music==== File:Red square 1.jpg|The industrial group Laibach during a performance in Koper, 2008 File:2009 Lent Festival - Vlado Kreslin (4).jpg|The folk rock singer-songwriter Vlado Kreslin during a concert at the Lent Festival in Maribor, 2009 File:Ana Pupedan.jpg|A performance of the folk rock group Ana Pupedan from Pivka Other popular bands, most largely unknown outside the country, include Negligence (thrash metal), Elvis Jackson (ska punk), La\u010dni Franz, Bohem, Puppetz (Indie), Tabu, Dru\u0161tvo Mrtvih Pesnikov (pop-rock), Naio Ssaion (Gothic metal), Terrafolk, Leaf Fat (screamo), Avven, Perpetuum Jazzile, Carpe Diem, \u0160ank Rock, Big Foot Mama, Yogurt, Levitan, Dan D, Time to time, Flirrt, Zablujena generacija, Slon in Sade\u017e, Katalena, Rock Partyzani, Shyam, Eroika, Hic et Nunc, Devil Doll (experimental rock), Chateau, Posodi mi j\u00fcrja, Rok'n'band, \u010cuki, Juliette Justine, Zakloni\u0161\u010de Prepeva, Psycho-Path, Dekadent (black metal) and Buldo\u017eer (progressive rock), and most recently Perpetuum Jazzile with more than 12 million views combined for the two a cappella \"Africa\" performance videos since their publishing on YouTube in May 2009 until September 2011,Perpetuum Jazzile: Africa.

After 1990, Adi Smolar, Iztok Mlakar, Vita Mavri\u010d, Vlado Kreslin, Zoran Predin, Peter Lov\u0161in, and Magnifico have been popular in Slovenia, as well. ====World music==== The 1970s Bratko Bibi\u010d's band Begnagrad is considered one of the direct influences on modern world music. Bibi\u010d's unique accordion style, often solo, with no accompaniment, has also made him a solo star. ====Punk rock==== Slovenia was the center for punk rock in the Titoist Yugoslavia. The most famous representatives of this genre were Pankrti, Niet, Lublanski Psi, \u010cao Pi\u010dke, Via Ofenziva, To\u017eibabe, and Otroci Socializma. ====Techno and tech-house==== Slovenia has also produced two renowned DJs: DJ Umek and Valentino Kanzyani. Specialising in a frantic brand of party techno and tech-house, the pair co-founded the label Recycled Loops as well as having many releases on labels such as Novamute, Primate, Intec and Bassethound Records. ==Theatre== Slovenia has a strong tradition of live theatre. Both professional and amateur theatre are financially supported by the government. Professional theatre in Slovenia runs in a repertory system; majority of professional theatres employ an ensemble of actors, and produce a season with four to twelve plays. The plays stay on repertory for minimum one season but often shows continue playing for a few years. There are four national theatres in Slovenia: Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana and Maribor National Drama Theatre, Slovene National Opera in Ljubljana and Slovene National Theatre in Nova Gorica. In addition, there are another nationally funded repertory theatres Mestno Gledalisce Ljubljansko (City Theatre Ljubljana), Mladinsko Gledalisce Ljubljana, Presernovo gledalisce Kranj, Slovensko Ljudsko Gledalisce Celje, Mestno gledalisce Ptuj, Anton Podbevsek Teater Novo Mesto, Gledalisce Koper, Gledalisce Glej and Mini Teater. Lastly, Slovenia also has two national repertory theatres dedicated to producing puppetry; Lutkovno gledalisce Ljubljana and Lutkovno gledalisce Maribor. Independent, small producers are also active in Slovenia, including physical theatre (e.g. Betontanc), street theatre (e.g. Ana Monr\u00f3 Theatre), theatresports championship Impro League, and improvisational theatre (e.g. IGLU Theatre). === History === First theatrical performances in Slovenia date all the way back to the 18th century. Between 1715 and 1727 Passion procession play was performed in the town of Skofja Loka. However, the first play written and performed is Slovene language is Zupanova Micka by Anton Tomaz Linhart which premiered on 28 December 1789. The play was very influential in the formation of national cultural and linguistic identity. Slovenia at the time was not a sovereign country and Slovene not recognized as a language. Majority of literary works and business transactions were conducted in German language and Slovene playwriting as well as discussions regarding the nature of Slovene identity were closely connected with the formation of theatre. In 1879 a Dramatic Society was formed in Ljubljana as a formal attempt to professionalize and institutionalize theatre and playwriting in Slovenia. Between 1879 and 1941 there are several initiatives leading towards professionalization of Slovene theatre; first theatre venue is opened in Ljubljana before the end of 19.century and the Drama Society operates as a kind of three pronged organization under one umbrella. There is research and international dialogue forming a sort of institute like branch, there is an early drama school educating performers, and a repertory theatre with a year long full season. Between 1920 and 1941 the government tries to suppress the theatre, which springs back to life after 1941, when Slovenia joins Yugoslavia. In 1952 additional seven professional repertory theatres are founded by the national government and large municipalities who both provide longterm ongoing funding. Late 50's, 60's and 70's mark the time of a new wave of experimental, independent theatre is Slovenia. ==Visual arts, architecture and design== The Sower (1907), by the Impressionist painter and musician Ivan Grohar, became a metaphor for the Slovenes and was a reflection of the transition from a rural to an urban culture. Slovenia's visual arts, architecture, and design are shaped by a number of architects, designers, painters, sculptors, photographers, graphics artists, as well as comics, illustration and conceptual artists. The most prestigious institutions exhibiting works of Slovene visual artists are the National Gallery of Slovenia and the Museum of Modern Art. ===Architecture=== Modern architecture in Slovenia was introduced by Max Fabiani, and in the mid-war period, Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik and Ivan Vurnik. In the second half of the 20th century, the national and universal style were merged by the architects Edvard Ravnikar and Marko Mu\u0161i\u010d. ===Comics and animation=== Milko Bambi\u010d is known for the first Slovene comic strip Little Negro Bu-ci-bu, an allegory of Mussolini's career, and as the creator of the Three Hearts () brand, still used today by Radenska. After the WW II, both the comics and animated advertisements drawn by Miki Muster gained popularity in Slovenia. ;Animation The first Slovenian animated feature film was the 1998 Socialization of a Bull, made by Zvonko \u010coh and Milan Eri\u010d who together drew fifty thousand frames during the ten years of its making. The first entirely computer made animations are the 2003 Perkmandeljc and the 2008 \u010cikorja an' kafe, both made by Du\u0161an Kastelic. ===Conceptual art=== A number of conceptual visual art groups formed, including OHO, Group 69, and IRWIN. Nowadays, the Slovene visual arts are diverse, based on tradition, reflect the influence of neighbouring nations and are intertwinned with modern European movements. ===Design=== The most known among Slovene interior designers is the designer of Scandinavian design-inspired 1952 Rex chair, Niko Kralj. His design is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art MOMA in New York City. Elan SCX are one of the best industrial design items that changed the world ski industry. They were designed in the internationally known Slovenian Elan company. Elan skis were depicted, even before Elan SCX, in the 1985 James Bond film series part A View to a Kill with Roger Moore. In the romantic comedy film Working Girl, Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) was depicted as skiing on the RC ELAN model skis and poles. ===Graphics=== During World War II, numerous graphics were created by Bo\u017eidar Jakac, who helped establish the post-war Academy of Visual Arts in Ljubljana. ===Illustration=== In 1917 Hinko Smrekar illustrated the notable Fran Levstik's Martin Krpan book about the Slovene folk hero. The children's books illustrators include a number of women illustrators, such as Marlenka Stupica, Marija Lucija Stupica, An\u010dka Go\u0161nik Godec, Marjanca Jemec Bo\u017ei\u010d, and Jelka Reichman. Many generations of children have been educated by the technical and science illustrations created by Bo\u017eo Kos and published in Slovenian children's magazines, such as Ciciban. Recently, Lila Prap's illustrations gained popularity in Japan where children's cartoons based on her illustrations have been televised. ===Painting=== Historically, painting and sculpture in Slovenia was in the late 18th and the 19th century marked by Neoclassicism (Matev\u017e Langus), Biedermeier (Giuseppe Tominz) and Romanticism (Mihael Stroj). The first art exhibition in Slovenia was organised in the late 19th century by Ivana Kobilica, a woman-painter who worked in realistic tradition. Impressionist artists include Matej Sternen, Matija Jama, Rihard Jakopi\u010d, Ivan Grohar whose The Sower (Slovene: Sejalec) was depicted on the \u20ac0.05 Slovenian euro coins, and Franc Berneker, who introduced the impressionism to Slovenia. Espressionist painters include Veno Pilon and Tone Kralj whose picture book, reprinted thirteen times, is now the most recognisable image of the folk hero Martin Krpan. ===Photography=== The sculpture of the poet Valentin Vodnik (1758\u20131819) was created by Alojz Gangl in 1889 as part of Vodnik Monument, the first Slovene national monument. In 1841, Janez Puhar (1814\u20131864) invented a process for photography on glass, recognized on 17 June 1852 in Paris by the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale Agricole, Manufacturi\u00e8re et Commerciale. Gojmir Anton Kos was a notable realist painter and photographer between First World War and WW II. The first photographer from Slovenia whose work was published by National Geographic magazine is Arne Hodali\u010dSlovenia River Excavation, National Geographic, January 2007. ===Sculpture=== The renewal of Slovene sculpture begun with Alojz Gangl (1859\u20131935) who made the first public monument of the notable Enlightenment figure Valentin Vodnik and provided The Genius of the Theatre and other statues for the Slovenian National Opera and Ballet Theatre building.Kiparstvo 19. in 20. stoletja , official website of the National Gallery of Slovenia ==References== ==External links== * Culture.si.
