The first element is to acknowledge the tragedy. It is a three-dimensional map. The map depicts the global scale of the slave trade. * The second element is to, consider the legacy. It has a full scale human figure lying down. This element is in front of a wall with images of the interior of a slave ship. This element is designed to illustrates the conditions that millions of African people were subjected to during the Middle Passage. * The third element, lest we forget is a triangular pool where visitors can reflect and honor the millions of people that lost their lives during the Transatlantic slave trade.
