It is also within walking distance of several business offices and studios, including the Water Garden office complex. The station has entrances on both ends. ==Name and history== Wild Bergamot (Monarda fistulosa) still grows in clumps around the station area. The name \"Bergamot Station\" dates back to 1890, and was a stop and car storage area on the steam powered Los Angeles and Independence Railroad from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles, as well as the subsequent Santa Monica Air Line on the Pacific Electric trolley system until 1953.Los Angeles Herald. \"The Iron Highways.\" June 14 1890. page 2. ==Vehicle maintenance facility== Expo Phase 2 includes a maintenance facility for Expo light-rail vehicles. This facility performs shop-related activities, including servicing, cleaning, inspection and repair of LRT vehicles. It also includes a yard with a storage capacity of up to 45 LRT vehicles. Several locations for this facility were proposed and evaluated, including the \"Verizon site\" (land just west of Bergamot Station, between Stewart Street and Centinela Avenue) and the Bergamot Station site itself. Use of the Verizon site was opposed by many residents of the surrounding Stewart Park neighborhood, who feared the project would create noise and other environmental impact. Use of the Bergamot Station site was opposed by artists at Bergamot Station, who successfully argued that Bergamot had become an irreplaceable resource for the west coast arts community. The City of Santa Monica and Expo built the facility on land which includes the Verizon site, as well as land that was a parking lot owned by Santa Monica College. They believe that with this \"hybrid site\", most environmental impacts from the facility were properly mitigated.
