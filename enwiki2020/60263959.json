The race is the fifteenth round of the 2020 Formula One World Championship and marks the 16th time that the Bahrain Grand Prix has been run as a round of the Formula One World Championship. ==Background== ===Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic=== The race was originally due to take place on 22 March 2020 as the second round of the championship, but the response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to event organisers initially announcing that no spectators would be permitted to attend the race. On 13 March the race was indefinitely postponed. It was the second time the race was postponed after the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix which was ultimately cancelled. In its place, an esports virtual Grand Prix was held on 22 March 2020 featuring race drivers, celebrities and esports racers with the race being won by Guanyu Zhou. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * The race on Formula1.com Bahrain Category:Bahrain Grand Prix Grand Prix Bahrain Grand Prix Bahrain Grand Prix ",
