A Pakistani Baraat Reception\u2014Bridegroom and his close relatives are being garlanded in this photo. Baraat (; ) is a groom's wedding procession in North India and Pakistan. In Indian communities, it is customary for the bridegroom to travel to the wedding venue (often the bride's house) on a mare, accompanied by his family members. The baraat can become a large procession, with booking its own band, dancers, and budget. The groom and his horse are covered in finery and do not usually take part in the dancing and singing; that is left to the \"baraatis\" or people accompanying the procession. The groom usually carries a sword. The term baraati is also more generically used to describe any invitee from the groom's side. Traditionally, baraatis are attended to as guests of the bride's family. The baraat, headed by a display of fireworks and accompanied by the rhythm of the dhol, reaches the meeting point, where the elders of both the families meet. In Indian Hindu weddings, the groom is greeted with garlands and aarti. In traditional Indian weddings, baraats are welcomed at the wedding venue with the sound of shehnais, which are considered auspicious at weddings by Hindus, muslims and Sikhs alike. Actually the concept of Barat came from Hindu God Lord shiva , which later accepted by native of this subcontinent after Islamic and Christian invasion the converted natives also used this tradition in theirs respectively religions, otherwise Baraat is the concept of Hinduism. ==Punjabi baraat== Both men and women participate in the procession of a Punjabi baraat. Close male relatives of both the bride and groom always wear turbans, which indicates honor. When the baraat arrives at the wedding venue, a ceremony known as the (literally, meeting or merger) is carried out, in which equivalent relatives from the groom and bride's sides greet each other. This usually begins with the two fathers, followed by the two mothers, then the siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins; even distant relatives are included in the , which symbolizes the unification of the two clans. ==Rajput baraat== A Rajput baraat was consisted entirely of male members. The bridegroom is usually dressed in a gold achkan, with an orange turban and a churidar or jodhpurs with juttis. The baraat members also must wear achkans or sherwanis with jodhpurs and safas (colorful turbans). The procession to the bride's house looks rather regal as there is absolutely no dancing on the streets by the baraatis. In fact, all members, including the groom who rides an elephant or a female horse, carry swords. The horse is important for the Rajputs. == Gujarati Baraat== Similar groom's procession, consisting of groom and his close relatives and family members in Gujarat is called jaan. ===The Milni=== A simple ceremony takes place and both families exchange well wishes on meeting each other. This is followed by light snacks and tea before the religious ceremony begins. A mother & daughter enjoy the moment. One by one designated family members exchange garlands and a hug. The groom distributes Karah Prashad (ceremonial sacremental pudding) to his family. Everyone then enjoys a grand feast. ==Maithil baraat== ==References== ==External links== * Indian Baraat Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in Pakistan Category:Marriage in Hinduism ",
