    "text": "Edward Bibring (1894\u20131959) was an Austrian/American psychoanalyst. He studied philosophy and history at the University of Czernowitz until the first World War. After his military service he went to study medicine at the University of Vienna, and later was accepted for training by the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, in which he became an associate member from 1925, and then a full member in 1927. He was closely associated with Sigmund Freud. He was an co- editor of the Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse for a brief period. In 1921 he married his fellow analyst Grete L. Bibring, and in 1941 the pair emigrated to the US. ==Writings== His publishing's focused on scientific contributions to the theory of psychoanalytic therapy, the study of depression, and the history of psychoanalysis. Bibring's early writings included studies of the instincts, and of the repetition compulsion.Otto Fenichel The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 598 He also wrote a pair of articles on paranoia in schizophrenia, including a case study of a woman who believed herself to be persecuted by someone called \"Behind\", a figure onto whom she had projected aspects of her own rear.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 429 and p. 598 Ernest Jones reported with approval Bibring's measured disagreement with Freud's concept of the death drive: \"Instincts of life and death are not psychologically perceptible as such; they are biological instincts whose existence is required by hypothesis alone...[&] ought only to be adduced in a theoretical context and not in discussion of a clinical or empirical nature\".Bibring, in Jones, Ernest, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (Plunket Lake Press 2019 e-book) While struggling with writer's block in the States, Bibring did publish a 1954 article on the role of abreaction in what he called \"emotional reliving\" - a theme later developed by Vamik Volkan in his re-grief therapy.Joan Didion, The Year of Magical Thinking (London 2005) p. 53 ==See also== *Ernst Kris *Erik H.
