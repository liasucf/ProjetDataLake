    "text": "Alexander Thomson Burr (November 1, 1893 \u2013 October 12, 1918) was a Major League Baseball player who was killed in World War I. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Burr was known as \"Tom\" to his friends. Press accounts throughout his life, as well as other memoirs, used this nickname, although many baseball references labeled him \"Alex\". Burr attended The Choate School (later Choate Rosemary Hall), where he was a star pitcher. He then went to Williams College, although he turned pro before he ever played a collegiate game. Burr made the New York Yankees roster as a pitcher under manager Frank Chance. However, his only game appearance for the Yankees (on April 21, 1914) came in center field. He had no fielding chances and did not have a plate appearance. Burr returned to Williams College after his pro career ended, although by some accounts he went into business instead of returning to school. He volunteered to serve in the war before ever graduating. He self-financed his trip to France where he volunteered as an ambulance driver before joining the aviation corps. He was killed shortly before the war ended in an airplane accident on October 12, 1918 while serving in the United States Army Air Service in Cazaux, France. After colliding with a fellow pilot, Burr's plane crashed into a lake in flames; his body was recovered after 12 days. He had been serving in France since November 1917 and was 24 years old at the time of his death. Burr was interred in American Expeditionary Forces Cemetery No. 29. During the years after the end of World War I, this cemetery was deconsecrated. Some of the bodies exhumed\u2014including Burr's\u2014were repatriated. Tom Burr's final resting place became Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Chicago. Burr was one of eight Major League Baseball players known either to have been killed or died from illness while serving in the armed forces during World War I. The others were Harry Chapman, Larry Chappell\u201a Harry Glenn, Eddie Grant\u201a Newt Halliday, Ralph Sharman and Bun Troy. ==See also== * List of baseball players who died during their careers ==References== ==External links== * SABR BioProject: detailed biography * Article on Burr's Death from Chicago Daily Tribune, 1918 * Baseball-Reference.com * Baseball Almanac * \"Those Who Served\" Category:New York Yankees players Category:1893 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Jersey City Skeeters players Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Baseball players from Illinois Category:American military personnel killed in World War I ",
