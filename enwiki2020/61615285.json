It is also known as Jagamohana Ramayana or Dandi Ramayana. While it is a translation , it deviates in many was from the original. In some parts he goes against the original text and in some parts follows the original text closely and yet in some other parts he creates entirely new narratives. He also broke new grounds by translating the Bhagabat Gita into Odia. Before this the philosophical and theological texts were not translated into Odia.
