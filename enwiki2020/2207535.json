Nine schools (five elementary, two middle, and two high schools) comprise the school district. Also a section of East Northport, NY == Schools == The district has two high schools (East and West), two middle schools (Candlewood and West Hollow), and five elementary schools (Otsego, Paumanok, Signal Hill, Sunquam and Vanderbilt).Half Hollow Hills: OUR SCHOOLS === High schools === Half Hollow Hills East High School East is located at 50 Vanderbilt Parkway in Dix Hills, New York, across the street from the Half Hollow Hills Community Library - Dix Hills building. Hills East is fed from West Hollow Middle School and is the larger of the two high schools in the district. The current principal is Milton Strong. The building was once expanded in the 1960s and used as both a junior high and a high school, which were located side-by-side and connected to one another, making the building a sprawling structure divided into two wings. For this reason, Hills East has redundant facilities: two main offices, two nurses' offices, two gymnasiums (and two pairs of men's and women's locker rooms), two auditoriums (a main theater and a lecture hall), and three cafeterias (one has since been converted to a weight room). The class of 1978 was the last class where East was the exclusive high school in the district; commencing in 1979 there were graduating classes from both high schools. In 2013, Half Hollow Hills High School East ranked #314 on Newsweek's list of Best High Schools in America. The Hills East school mascot is the Thunderbird, which wears the school colors of red, black, and white. High School East uniquely features a domed planetarium, located one floor above the principal's office in the newer west wing. It houses a Spitz A3P planetarium projector, and is generally used to host class trips from the middle and elementary schools. It is also the home of the Hills East Astronomy Club, where students are taught about the night sky, astronomy and mythology by fellow students and teachers. High School East's other main attraction and centerpiece is the Eugene Orloff Auditorium, a two-level theater boasting a seating capacity of 2200, making it the second largest not-for-profit auditorium on Long Island. It hosts a variety of school events throughout the year, such as student concerts, musicals, awards ceremonies and graduations. The space is also rented out to local arts/cultural organizations and companies for concerts, meetings and other events throughout the year. The stage is a full Broadway-sized stage (88 feet wide, 49 feet deep, three stories tall for fly space (hanging scenery). The stage has an orchestra pit containing two pistons (although only one functions) that are capable of raising and lowering the pit. The Eugene Orloff Auditorium is infamous for its low-quality acoustics, as it was constructed of concrete and never completed. The music wing of the school is located in the hallway running behind the stagehouse. The school also has a lecture hall, located in the older east wing. Recently renovated, It is usually the host of small gatherings and meetings, as well as Advanced Placement exams.

The school's demographics are 63% white, 16% black, 6% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, and less than 1% American Indian, Alaskan, or two or more races. Its male\u2013female ratio is 53\u201347. The school receives Title I funding and 11% of its students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The school was built in 1975 and in its first year was 10th grade only, for class of '78. After its first year of classes, the district was split and the two high schools became typical 10, 11, 12 grade each. It includes a track, turf field, and natatorium.

Opened in 1970, the building's architects, Geo. B. Post and Sons, included unique features and upscale amenities that made the school a design showplace. These included an \"open-concept\" floor plan (originally, most classrooms had no doors, and hallways and rooms had wall-to-wall carpeting for sound absorption), a \"galleria-style\" atrium featuring tropical and exotic plant species (donated by Planting Fields Arboretum of Oyster Bay), a small interior greenhouse, a multi-purpose auditorium that could be divided into three sections (a main theater and two smaller lecture halls), and a central air- conditioning system (making it useful for hosting the district's summer school sessions). On the north side of building (where the annex wing was later built) were once three tennis courts. The current principal is Steven Hauk. The school's athletic teams are collectively known by the nickname \"Wolverines\", and the current school colors are a passionate red, white, black, purple, and occasionally blue.

The first to close was Sweet Hollow in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, Taukomas, The Hills School and Manasquan closed due to declining enrollment. Manasquan became the district's central office building (later renamed as Fran Greenspan Administration Center) and fed to Burr's Lane Junior High School (also closed, eventually becoming part of the Five Towns College campus in the early 1990s). Vanderbilt, Otsego, and Forest Park used to all feed to Candlewood, which feeds to High School West. Signal Hill, Chestnut Hill, Paumonok, and Sunquam used to all feed to West Hollow, which feeds to High School East. Sunquam re-opened in 1999 after being closed since 1991.
