Saputra and produced by Starvision Plus. The film examines the struggle between sexuality and morality in modern Indonesia. It stars Laudya Cynthia Bella, Ardina Rasti and Angie. Released on 11 November 2004, the film achieved domestic ticket sales of 1.1 million and was later adapted into a television series of the same name. ==Plot== Sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Biyan (Laudya Cynthia Bella) wants to be a writer and is determined to remain a virgin until marriage. Her determination is reinforced by the womanizing of her father, which has affected her mother (Henidar Amroe). Biyan hangs out with her schoolfriends Stella (Ardina Rasti) and Ketie (Angie). They belong to a group of materialistic teens who view virginity as old-fashioned and are not afraid to experiment with alcohol. Stella wants to get into acting but is tricked into appearing in a soft-core porn film, while Ketie prostitutes herself to older men in order to purchase consumer goods. Biyan attends an auction for the right to sleep with her idol, Merix. After Biyan outbids a gay man, Merix confides that he has never slept with a woman because he is embarrassed about his small penis. ==Reception== Because the film contains nightlife and promiscuity, it was pulled from distribution in Makassar. ==Awards and Festivals== 1\\.
