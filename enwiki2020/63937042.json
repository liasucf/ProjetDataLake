    "text": "Structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRiC in the AMP-PNP bound state (PDB 5GW5). T-complex protein Ring Complex (TRiC), otherwise known as Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 (CCT), is a multiprotein complex and the chaperonin of eukaryotic cells. Like the bacterial GroEL, the TRiC complex aids in the folding of ~10% of the proteome, and actin and tubulin are some of its best known substrates. TRiC is an example of a Biological machines that folds substrates within the central cavity of its barrel-like assembly using the energy from ATP hydrolysis. == Subunits == The human TRiC complex is formed by two rings containing 8 similar but non-identical subunits, each with molecular weights of ~60 kDa. The two rings are stacked in an asymmetrical fashion, forming a barrel-like structure with a molecular weight of ~1 MDa. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Subunit !! MW (kDa) !!
