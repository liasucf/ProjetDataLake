    "text": "The Farmington River is a river in Liberia. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean near the town of Marshall. The Farmington River, Junk River, and Gbage River join near the Atlantic coast to form an estuary. Some sources suggest that the river reaching the ocean is the Farmington River, whereas the Junk River is its tributary. Other, often older sources suggest the opposite. Firestone Natural Rubber Company established rubber plantations by the Farmington River in 1926. The company built the Firestone hydroelectric power station, completed in 1942, to serve the plantation and the associated industry. In later years, the company has been accused of polluting the river. ==References== Category:Rivers of Liberia ",
