    "text": "The Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo (NT1004) is an ecoregion containing p\u00e1ramo (high moorland) vegetation above the treeline in the Andes mountain range of Venezuela. The isolated habitat has many endemic species. It is relatively stable and intact. ==Geography== ===Location=== K\u00f6ppen climate zones of the Cordillera de Merida The Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo is to the south of the Lake Maracaibo in the Cordillera de M\u00e9rida massif of northeastern Venezuela. It has an area of . It is surrounded by the Venezuelan Andes montane forests ecoregion. ===Terrain=== P\u00e1ramos in the southwest of the Cordillera de Merida include Batall\u00f3 at above sea level and Nari\u00f1o at . The highest point in the central section is the Piedras Blancas peak at , surrounded by extensive p\u00e1ramos, glaciers and lakes. From the Piedras Blancas p\u00e1ramo the land descends to the Mucuch\u00edes p\u00e1ramo at , then continues to gradually descend towards the northeast. ===Climate=== The K\u00f6ppen climate classification is \"ETH\": Alpine tundra, with no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). Where the Northern Andean p\u00e1ramo is generally humid throughout the year with moisture delivered in the form of rain, clouds and fog as air masses are lifted up over the mountains, the Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo is similar to the Costa Rican p\u00e1ramo and Santa Marta p\u00e1ramo, where the trade winds create a distinct dry season. The dominant winds blow northwest from the Amazon region, with a rainy season from around March to November. ==Ecology== The Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo ecoregion is in the neotropical realm, in the montane grasslands and shrublands biome. The ecoregion is part of the Northern Andean Paramo global ecoregion, which also includes the Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo, Santa Marta p\u00e1ramo and Northern Andean p\u00e1ramo terrestrial ecoregions. The plants and animals are adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the high peaks. There is a high level of local endemism, particularly on the more isolated peaks. ===Origins=== The Andes began to rise in the Miocene epoch, but in the north did not reach their present height until the Pliocene during a period of strong volcanic activity between four and five million years ago. This was the period when land rose above the tree line and the protop\u00e1ramo vegetation was formed with new species of the Poaceae, Cyperecear, Arteraceae, Ericaceae and other families. During the later parts of the Quaternary epoch a series of short, cold and dry glacial periods alternated with warmer and more humid interglacial periods. The p\u00e1ramo belts moved lower and joined together in the cold periods, and moved higher into unconnected enclaves when the temperatures rose. The result is a mix of species of tropical and boreal origin with the same genera found in most p\u00e1ramos, but with many endemic species in the individual p\u00e1ramos. The Cordillera de M\u00e9rida is the oldest part of the northern Andes, and has a large connected corridor of p\u00e1ramo. The range is probably where most of the p\u00e1ramo flora of tropical origin developed, then migrated south into Colombia during cold glacial periods. ===Flora=== Horses in the Sierra La Culata National Park The mountain forest extends up to about in altitude, where the p\u00e1ramos begin, Above the p\u00e1ramos are replaced by a periglacial zone with very little vegetation, mostly lichens, mosses and some dwarf plants. No flora or fauna are found above around . The ecoregion mostly consists of dry p\u00e1ramo habitat, with high-altitude tussock grass, stands of dwarf bamboo and open meadows There are also some marshes and bogs, although less than in the wet p\u00e1ramo. ===Fauna=== Redonda chiquinquirana, a butterfly whose females have limited ability to fly, is endemic to the ecoregion. A study of Carabid beetles found diverse and numerous specimens, all endemic to the ecoregion although closely related to species in other ranges. Carbonellia ater is found between . The most important Carabid tribes in terms of numbers of species and of individuals belong to the genera Dyscolus and Bembidion. Endangered amphibians include the Mucubaji stubfoot toad (Atelopus mucubajiensis) and Tam\u00e1 harlequin frog (Atelopus tamaense). Endangered mammals include Musso's fish-eating rat (Neusticomys mussoi). ==Status== The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status \"Relatively Stable/Intact\". Protected areas include the Guaramacal National Park. The Sierra La Culata National Park and Sierra Nevada National Park protect the Ruta de los P\u00e1ramos, a tourist route through the central p\u00e1ramos. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * Category:Neotropic ecoregions Category:Ecoregions of Venezuela Category:P\u00e1ramos ",
