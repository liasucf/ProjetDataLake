    "text": "Lamprais (English: Lumprice) is a Sri Lankan dish that was introduced by the country's Dutch Burgher population. Lamprais is derived from the Dutch word lomprijst, which loosely translated means a packet of food. ==Composition== It consists of two special curries (a three meat curry, often including beef, pork and chicken - and ash plantain with aubergine), seeni sambal, belacan, frikadeller meatballs and rice boiled in stock, all of which is wrapped in banana leaves and baked in an oven. The rice is made by frying raw short grain rice with onions and spices in butter or ghee and then cooking it in a meat stock. A hard boiled egg which has been deep-fried is also a common addition. The traditional recipe always contains three meat items however modern versions can include just a single meat, such as fish or chicken or as a vegetarian version. ==History== From 1658 until 1796, Sri Lanka was under Dutch rule. The Dutch Burghers (an ethnic group of mixed Dutch, Portuguese Burghers and Sri Lankan descent) came up with this delicacy. ==References== Category:Rice dishes Category:Sri Lankan rice dishes Category:Dutch Ceylon Category:Sri Lankan lamb dishes Category:Sri Lankan egg dishes ",
