Sant\u2032 Anna was built as an ocean liner for service between France and New York City. The ship was operational between 1912 and 1915, when she was requisitioned by the French Army and refitted as troopship for use in World War I. On 19 September 1915 a fire broke out on board, which was thought to be an act of German sabotage. On 12 April 1916 Sant\u2032 Anna made her first trip to the Salonika Front with 1,027 Serbian Army soldiers and 129 horses on board. On 11 May 1918 she was again steaming in the Mediterrean Sea on a voyage from Bizerte for Thessaloniki under the escort of two British sloops, and , with 2,025 soldiers on board (574 Senegalese, 429 Kabyle, 194 Annamite, nine Greek, and the rest French). She was torpedoed at 3:15 AM by the Imperial German Navy submarine SM UC-54, commanded by Heinrich XXXVII Prinz Reu\u00df zu K\u00f6stritz, and sank at 3:58 AM off the coast of French Tunisia, some 26 nautical miles east of Cape Bon, killing 605 of the soldiers. The survivors were rescued by the two British sloops, the French Navy destroyer Catapulte, a British gunboat, the French sloop Saint Jean, and the vessels Auguste Leblond and Marguerite Marie. ==See also== *List by death toll of ships sunk by submarines ==Sources== * Navires 14-18 * Technical data, pictures, lists of names * Wreck site * Category:1912 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1915 Category:Ship fires Category:Maritime incidents in 1918 Category:Passenger ships of France Category:Ships built in France Category:Ships sunk by German submarines in World War I Category:World War I shipwrecks in the Mediterranean ",
