    "text": "The Invisible Maniac (also known as The Invisible Sex Maniac) is a 1990 American comedy horror film written and directed by Adam Rifkin (under the pseudonym \"Rif Coogan\") and starring Noel Peters and Shannon Wilsey. ==Impact== The film is primarily regarded for being one of the few non- pornographic works starring lead actress Shannon Wilsey (who later took on the name Savannah). The film's reception had a profoundly negative impact on the actress; despite the fact that it was well received for its comedic merits, she felt mortified about her performance. In an interview for the E! True Hollywood Story documentary on the life of the actress, former boyfriend Billy Sheehan recounted how Wilsey was utterly humiliated during the film's premiere. Whenever the audience would laugh at one of her lines she could not differentiate whether they were laughing at her personally or the character. The experience forever marred Wilsey on a personal level and she soon afterwards resigned herself to pursue a career exclusively in the adult entertainment industry. She rose to the highest auspices of the adult entertainment world, becoming the indisputable \"porn queen\", though her life was forever fraught with personal disappointments and drug addiction, which eventually culminated in her suicide in 1994. She was 23 years old at the time of her death. ==Cast== * Noel Peters as Kevin Dornwinkle * Shannon Wilsey as Vicky * Stephanie Blake as Mrs. Callo * Melissa Moore as Bunny * Clement von Franckenstein as Dr. McWaters ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 films Category:1990s science fiction comedy films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:Films directed by Adam Rifkin Category:Films about invisibility Category:Films based on The Invisible Man Category:1990 comedy films ",
