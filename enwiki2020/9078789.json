    "text": "The posterior surface of the tibia presents, at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the soleal line (popliteal line in older texts), which extends obliquely downward from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. It marks the lower limit of the insertion of the Popliteus, serves for the attachment of the fascia covering this muscle, and gives origin to part of the Soleus, Flexor digitorum longus, and Tibialis posterior muscles. The triangular area, above this line, gives insertion to the Popliteus. ==References== ==External links== * Description at uams.edu * Category:Bones of the lower limb Category:Tibia ",
