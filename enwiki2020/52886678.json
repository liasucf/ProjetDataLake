    "text": "Novakiella is a genus of South Pacific orb-weaver spiders containing the single species, Novakiella trituberculosa that has only been found in Australia and New Zealand. ==Taxonomy== Novakiella was first described by N. Court & Forster in 1993 as a replacement name for Novakia. The sole species N. trituberculosa was originally placed in the now obsolete genus Epeira as E. tri-tuberculata. Carl Friedrich Roewer temporarily moved it to Araneus while dissolving this \"catch-all\" taxon, and it was later placed into its own genus, Novakia, later renamed to Novakiella. ==References== Category:Araneidae Category:Monotypic Araneomorphae genera Category:Spiders of Australia Category:Spiders of New Zealand ",
