    "text": "Rocketmen was a constructible strategy game produced by WizKids and released in 2005 and discontinued in 2006. Part of its marketing included animated adventures based on the character of Nick Sion, a rebel and adventurer facing the evil alliance of Terra and Mars. Announced by Capcom, Rocketmen: Axis Of Evil, a downloadable arcade style video game based on the constructible strategy game, was slated to be released Fall 2007 for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. Rocketmen: Axis of Evil received a Vanguard Unique Game Award at the 2006 Origins Game Fair. ==Description== Similar to Wizkids's sailing-themed Pirates of the Spanish Main, Rocketmen is a game featuring spaceships constructed from polystyrene cards purchased in randomly assorted booster packs. Ships can be customized with various crew and equipment configurations, all of which are used to construct a single fleet. A single booster pack can contain enough for a basic game (two ships, a crew card, a resource card, an asteroid card, a die, and a rules booklet), but maximum customizability requires access to a wider collection. Ship Types include: *Fighter Squadrons *Rocketships *Cruisers *Space Stations *Harvesters Pod Types include: *Arc Laser (red) *Shields (blue) *Tractor beam (purple) In addition, there are asteroid cards used as a home base during most scenarios. There are also resource chips (called microids) used to construct ships held in reserve in certain games, or as victory points in others. ===Factions=== The setting for Rocketmen: Axis of Evil is heavily influenced by movie serial- era space operas. *Legion of Terra \u2013 ruled by a xenophobic totalitarian leader Lord Invictus, the Legion of Terra is a vastly powerful army of disciplined soldiers *Mars \u2013 allied with Terra in the Axis of Evil, the green-skinned Martians have a society entirely based on war *Venus \u2013 part of the Alliance of Free Planets, the blue-skinned Venusians are a people who believe in logic, science, and pacifism and follow a matriarchal society. *Mercury \u2013 part of the Alliance of Free Planets yet traditional enemies of the people of Venus, the golden-skinned Amazon warriors of Mercury are also a matriarchal society, ruled by the Empress Armada. *Rebels \u2013 part of the Alliance of Free Planets, the Terran Rebels fight against their own people in an effort to free Earth ===Sets=== *Axis of Evil \u2013 Base set. *Battle of Titans \u2013 Released December 2005.
