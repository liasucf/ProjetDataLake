He was also known as Daeng Ronggek, Tengku Chik and Daeng Kechil. A year later in 1811, his family moved to Singapura and established a governance there, where they settled near the river (present day Singapore River). In 1823, his father moved the family and followers to the 200 acres of land (part of Teluk Belanga area) as assigned by Sir Stamford Raffles, the palace known as Istana Lama was later completed in 1824. His father died at the palace on 8 December 1825 and was informally succeed by his elder brother Tun Haji Abdullah as the de facto Temenggong. In 1833, Daeng Ibrahim took over his brother Tun Haji Abdullah as the Temenggong of Johor. He later introduced Kangchu system to develop black pepper and gambir. However his appointment was only officially made known on 19 August 1841, and was witnessed by the 4th Governor of the Straits Settlements George Bonham and the Treasurer of Pahang Bendahara Tun Ali at the New Harbour (present day Keppel Harbour). On 10 March 1855, Ali Iskandar signed an agreement with the British Government in Singapore. In this agreement, Ali Iskandar would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive 5,000 Spanish dollars with an allowance of 500 per month, in return, he agreed to transfer all his powers of the Johor territory to Daeng Ibrahim, except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control. Although the treaty recognised Ali Iskandar as the Sultan of Johor, but the title cannot be passed on to his offspring. Thus, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim became the de facto Maharajah of Johor, he renamed this territory as Iskandar Puteri and administered it from his residence at Teluk Belanga. As the Sultan of Riau- Lingga Mahmud Muzaffar Shah was ousted by the Dutch on 7 October 1857 and Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah II was installed as his successor. Raja Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, aware of the situation and later in 1861, he signed a treaty with Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Pahang. The treaty recognized the territories of Johor, the Temenggong and his descendant's right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognition of Johor and Pahang. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire had became two independent states, Johor and Pahang. ==Death== Daeng Ibrahim died in his house Istana Lama at Teluk Belanga on 31 January 1862 and was buried at the nearby Makam Diraja Teluk Blangah with his father. He was succeeded by his eldest son Abu Bakar. ==Legacy== A certain location was named after him in Singapore. * Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim ==References== Category:1810 births Category:1862 deaths Category:People of British Singapore Category:House of Temenggong of Johor ",
