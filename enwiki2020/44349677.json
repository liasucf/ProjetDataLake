It preserves the farm site in barrio Talisay where Jos\u00e9 Rizal was exiled for four years from 1892-1896 after being accused of sedition and plotting the Philippine revolution in Manila by the Spanish colonial authorities. The protected area was established in 1940 as the Rizal National Park covering an initial area of through Proclamation No. 616 signed by President Manuel Luis Quezon.

The Jos\u00e9 Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape occupies a hilly peninsula facing the Dapitan Bay in Zamboanga del Norte. It is located in the seaside barangay of Talisay, about a kilometer northwest from the Dapitan city proper. ==History== The estate in Talisay was purchased by Rizal for P4,000 after winning the Reales Loter\u00edas Espa\u00f1olas de Filipinas () two months after arriving in Dapitan. Rizal built houses in the site, started a farm, put up a school for boys, and built a hospital where he could practice medicine and treat the poor for free. For four years, he worked as a rural physician, farmer, merchant, inventor, painter, sculptor, archaeologist, linguist, teacher, architect, poet, biologist and environmentalist. His mother, Teodora Alonso, sisters and other relatives would later on come to live with him in the farm. In 1897, after Rizal was executed, these properties were confiscated by the Spanish colonial government as indemnity to the state and transferred to the custody of Don Cosme Borromeo. The site was then converted into a public park in 1913 with the structures built by Rizal reconstructed on their original sites. ==Rizal Shrine== Casa Residencia Casa Redonda The protected landscape area contains the Rizal National Shrine, declared in 1973 through Presidential Decree No. 105.
