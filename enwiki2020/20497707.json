Taisun (; Taishan) is the name of the world's strongest crane which has a safe working load of 20,000 metric tons (22,046 short tons). Taisun is designed and built for the installation of very large modules in semi submersibles and FPSO projects and located at Yantai Raffles Shipyard in Yantai, Shandong Province, China. The crane holds the three heaviest lifts of all time: 20,133 metric tons, 17,100 tons and 14,000 tons. Taisun seen lifting the 14,000-ton deck box of the COSL Pioneer drilling semisubmersible. == Concept == Taisun was built to install very large (up to 20,000 ton) integrated modules on top of a vessel's hull. Traditionally, offshore vessels such as drilling semi submersibles or FPSOs were built from the ground up in modules of 1000 to 2000 tons, which meant that much installation, hook up and commissioning work was left to be done on board where access is limited and efficiency lower. Taisun facilitates simultaneous construction of the lower and upper parts of the vessel which allows for a shorter overall project schedule, manpower improvements of up to two million man-hours while safety and quality levels are improved. Taisun with the now-complete SS Amazonia drilling semisubmersible. == Awards == Guinness World Record Taisun holds the world record for \"heaviest weight lifted by crane\", set in Yantai on April 18, 2008 and set at 20,133 metric tonnes (44,385,667.25 lb) by lifting a barge, ballasted with water. Spotlight on New Technology During the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) 2008, Taisun received the Spotlight on New Technology Award for improving safety, speed and efficiency during construction of offshore production vessels. In order to win the award, Taisun met four technology criteria: the technology must be less than two years old and must not be in violation of any known patents, the technology must be proven through full-scale application or successful prototype testing, the technology must have broad appeal for the industry at large and the technology must offer substantial benefits over current technologies.http://updates.spe.org/index.php/2008/05/14/heavy-lift-world- record-holder-wins-otc-spotlight-award Woelfel Best Mechanical Engineering Achievement 2008 During the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) 2008, Taisun received the Woelfel Best Mechanical Engineering Achievement Award from American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This award recognizes technologies which are novel; have a significant impact on the offshore industry; meet health, safety, and environmental standards; and are well conceptualized and developed.http://updates.spe.org/index.php/2008/05/14/heavy-lift-world-record- holder-wins-otc-spotlight-award Taisun setting the heavy lift world record at 20,133 metric tons == Particulars == {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 | Safe Working Load |align=right|20,133 metric tons |- | Height |align=right|133 meters |- | Span |align=right|120 meters |- | Maximum lift height |align=right|80 meters |- | Dry dock length |align=right|380 meters |- | Wire rope length |align=right|50,000 meters |- |} ==See also== {| |- valign=top | *Big Blue *Breakwater Crane Railway *Finnieston Crane | *Fairbairn steam crane *Kockums Crane *Left Coast Lifter | *Mastekranen *Samson & Goliath *Titan Clydebank |} ==References== ==External links== * * www.slideshare.net (Presentation of COSL Pioneer deck box lift) * Google 3D warehouse (downloadable 3d model of Taisun) ;Videos * Construction of Taisun * Taisun's first project, installing the 14000-ton deck box of the COSL Pioneer * Taisun sets world record for Heaviest Topsides Crane Lift with Saipem's Scarabeo 9 * TAISUN installs the 12,000-ton deck box of Schahin's SS Amazonia Category:Individual cranes (machines) ",
