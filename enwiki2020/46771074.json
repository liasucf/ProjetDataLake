    "text": "Lalaban Ako Para Sa Pilipino (English: I Will Fight For The Filipinos) is a song by Filipino boxer and entertainer Manny Pacquiao from the EP with the same name, and his last released single after he announced retirement from singing. It was released on 24 April 2015 with the other singles on the EP with the same name under GMA Records. It was his entrance song to his fight against Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which he lost. It was written by Filipino well- known composer Lito Camo, who is also a close friend of Pacquiao. ==Music video== Pacquiao himself directed the four-minute-and-seventeen-second video. It mostly shows the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan; scenes from his previous fights, notably against \u00c9rik Morales and Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez; and videos of Pacquiao hurt during those fights, with blood on his face. It also features Filipinos praying religiously while smiling or crying; Pacquiao training before his fights; and him performing the song in a studio with a crowd cheering him on, singing along with the track and waving the Philippine flag proudly. At the end of the video, Pacquiao closes his eyes slowly, as if to pray. ==References== Category:2015 songs Category:Manny Pacquiao songs Category:Songs written by Lito Camo ",
