He is primarily a central midfielder but can also play at full- back. ==Career== Koizumi started his career as a junior player with Yokohama F. Marinos, but the club did not promote him to their Under-18 team. He entered Ryutsu Keizai University Kashiwa High School and started playing for the school. He subsequently became a regular in the school team that won the Prince Takamado Cup in 2013. In 2014, Koizumi joined J. League Division 1 club Albirex Niigata and has added some versatility to the Albirex squad. His ability to play in a number of positions across defence and midfield made him an attractive proposition and boss Masaaki Yanagishita was delighted to be able to prise him away from The Big Swan Stadium. ==Club statistics== Updated to 12 January 2018.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4f01\u753b\u51fa\u7248\u793e, \"2017 J1&J2;&J3;\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451 (NSK MOOK)\", 8 February 2017, Japan, (p. 121 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4f01\u753b\u51fa\u7248\u793e, \"2016J1&J2;&J3;\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451\", 10 February 2016, Japan, (p. 126 out of 289) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
