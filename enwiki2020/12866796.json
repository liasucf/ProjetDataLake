Conner & David Hatfield Sparks, Queering Creole Spiritual Traditions: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Participation in African Inspired Traditions in the Americas; (Haworth Press, Binghamton, New York, 2004); Afro-Cuban-American artist specializing at painting, drawing, engraving, installation and graphic design. Boza studied at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \"San Alejandro\" from 1960 to 1962 and then from 1962 to 1964 at the Escuela Nacional de Arte (ENA) both located in Havana, Cuba. He was expelled from San Alejandro due to \"political issues\" and became a lithographer with the Experimental Graphic Workshop in 1965. Boza was fired as a result of the Congress of Education and Culture which convened in 1971 and led to the censorship of many artists in Cuba. In the years between 1971 and his exodus from Cuba in 1980 Boza restored religious statues to earn a living. In 1980 Juan Boza managed to escape Cuba to New York via the Mariel boatlift. Boza described New York as a \"tremendous shock\" and upon arriving in New York \"had to re-build Juan Boza from scratch.\" Boza began developing an Afro-Cuban theme that he realized was part of his culture after leaving Cuba, as well as his participation in the Santeria (also known as Lukum\u00ed) religion. According to Jaun Boza, \"There is no distinction between my faith and my aesthetics.\" He lived in New York City from 1980, when he arrived during the Mariel boatlift until his death, at Brooklyn Memorial Hospital, working at the Printmaking Workshop, the Lower Eastside Printshop and the Art Student League. ==Exhibitions== In 1964, Sanchez presented a personal exhibition in the Galer\u00eda Provincial de Camag\u00fcey in Cuba. Four years later, he created \"Stopper: Gouaches, Drawings and Lithographies,\" shown at the Gallery of Havana. In 1983, Sanchez exhibited \"Juan Stopper: Black Mysticism\" at the Latin Inter-American Gallery in New York. In 1984, his art was exhibited at the Museum of African Americans in Buffalo, New York. In 1990, he presented \"Juan Boza's World\" at the Ollantay Gallery in New York. Sanchez also participated in many collective exhibits. He first group showing was in the 1960 Freedom for Siqueiros at the Seguro M\u00e9dico Building in Havana. In 1970, he exhibited pieces in Sal\u00f3n 70 at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana; in 25 Latin American Engravings at the Gallery Pablo Picasso in Mexico; and in the Fourth American Biennial of the Engraving in Santiago, Chile. In 1975, he participated in the Ninth International Print Biennial at the Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Japan. In 1983, he appeared in the Sixth Biennial of Latin American Engraving\" at the Navy Arsenal in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1984, he appeared in the Third Latin American Graphic Art Biennial. === Individuals Exhibitions === * 1964 \u2013 Galer\u00eda Provincial de Camag\u00fcey, Cuba. * 1968 \u2013 \"Boza.
