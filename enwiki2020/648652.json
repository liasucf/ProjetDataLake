She was born in New York City and has lived in Denmark since age six. She is of Polish and African-American descent. Since 1975, she has worked as a percussionist with various groups, among them Six Winds with Alex Riel. Mazur is primarily an autodidact, but she has a degree in percussion from the Royal Danish Academy of Music. ==Musical life== She has worked with many musicians, including John Tchicai, Pierre D\u00f8rge (New Jungle Orchestra), Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen, Palle Mikkelborg, Arild Andersen, Eberhard Weber, Peter Kowald, Jeanne Lee, Jan Garbarek, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Gil Evans, Dhafer Youssef, and Makiko Hirabayashi (Makiko Hirabayashi Trio). In 1989, she founded the band Future Song, with pianist Elvira Plenar, singer Aina Kemanis, trumpet player Nils Petter Molv\u00e6r, her husband Klavs Hovman (bass) and Audun Kleive, as a second drummer. Later jazz singer Tone \u00c5se joined the band. In a second project, Percussion Paradise, she works regularly with percussionists Benita Haastrup, Lisbeth Diers and Birgit L\u00f8kke. The U.S. magazine Down Beat, in 1989, 1990, 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2002 selected Mazur as a \"percussion-talent deserving wider recognition\". In 2001, she was awarded the Jazzpar Prize, the world's largest international jazz prize. ==Gallery== Image:Marilyn_mazur01.jpg Image:Marilyn-Mazur04.jpg Image:Marilyn-Mazur05.jpg Image:Marilyn-Mazur06.jpg Image:Marilyn-Mazur07.jpg Image:Marilyn-mazur08.jpg Image:Marilyn-mazur09.jpg ==Honors== * Ben Webster Prize, Ben Webster Foundation, 1983 * JASA Prize, Danish jazz journalists, 1989 * Jazzpar Prize, 2001 * Edition Wilhelm Hansens Composer Prize, 2004 * Danish Django dOr (Legend), 2006 * Unlimited Communication, Telenor 2007 * EuroCore-JTI Jazz Award, 2010 * The Grethe Kolbe Grant, Danish Conductors Association, 2013 * No. 1 Jazz Performer, Down Beat, six times ==Discography== ===As leader=== * MM 4 with Mazur Markussen Kvartet (Rosen, 1984) * Marilyn Mazur's Future Song (veraBra, 1992) * Circular Chant (Storyville, 1995) * Small Labyrinths (ECM, 1997) * Colors with LLL-Mental (Hot Wire, 1997) * Jordsange/Earth Songs (Dacapo, 2000) * Poetic Justice with Lotte Anker, Marilyn Crispell (Dacapo, 2001) * All the Birds: Reflecting + Adventurous (Stunt, 2002) * Daylight Stories (Stunt, 2004) * Elixir with Jan Garbarek (ECM, 2008) * Tangled Temptations & the Magic Box (Stunt, 2010) * Celestial Circle (ECM, 2011) * Flamingo Sky (Stunt, 2014) * Marilyn Mazur's Shamania (RareNoise, 2019) ===As guest=== With Lindsay Cooper * Music from the Gold Diggers (Sync Pulse, 1983) * Oh Moscow (Victo, 1991) * Rags & the Golddiggers (ReR, 1991) With Pierre Dorge * Pierre Dorge & New Jungle Orchestra (SteepleChase, 1982) * Brikama (SteepleChase, 1984) * Even the Moon Is Dancing (SteepleChase, 1985) * Canoe (Olufsen, 1986) * Johnny Lives (SteepleChase, 1987) With Jan Garbarek * Twelve Moons (ECM, 1993) * Visible World (ECM, 1996) * Rites (ECM, 1998) With Makiko Hirabayashi * Makiko (Enja, 2006) * Hide and Seek (Enja, 2009) * Surely (Yellowbird, 2013) * Where the Sea Breaks (Yellowbird, 2017) With others * Frans Bak, Natsange (Stunt, 1999) * Jon Balke, Further (ECM, 1994) * Peter Bastian, Northern Lights (Fonix Musik 1997) * Harry Beckett & Pierre Dorge, Echoez of...
