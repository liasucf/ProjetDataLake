    "text": "Burong mangga is a Filipino side dish made by mixing sugar, salt, and water to mangoes that have previously been salted. The mixture of water and sugar should be boiled and cooled first, before pouring it over the salted mangoes. Some variants add chilis to the cooled sugar water mixture. Original \"basic\" burong mangga is made using a brine solution and pouring it over halved unripe or partially ripe mangoes. Mango cultivars commonly used for burong mangga include 'Carabao' mangoes and 'Pico' mangoes. ==See also== *Mango pickle *Chanh mu\u1ed1i -Vietnamese salted lime. *Pickled fruit *Umeboshi-Japanese pickled plum. ==References== Category:Philippine cuisine Category:Plant-based fermented foods Category:Vegetarian dishes of the Philippines ",
