The species occurs in much of Europe but is regionally extinct in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Its habitat is slow flowing streams, pools and ponds. ==Status in Britain== This species was only ever known from two areas in southern England, one around the River Stour and Moors River in east Dorset, where the species was recorded from 1820 to 1963, and the other on the River Tamar in Devon where the species was recorded in 1946 only. ==References== Category:Dragonflies of Europe Category:Corduliidae ",
