    "text": "Jutta Graae Jutta Regitse Pilegaard Graae (1906\u20131997) was a Danish bank employee who became a member of the Danish resistance during the German occupation of Denmark in World War II. After first working as a contact for the resistance worker Ebbe Munck in Stockholm, she became so deeply involved in illegal activities that she had to move to Stockholm herself in September 1943. In 1944, she moved to London where from January 1945 she joined the Special Operations Executive. After the war, she continued to work for Danish intelligence, becoming chief archivist for the Danish Defence Intelligence Service in 1956 until her retirement in 1960. ==Early life== Born on 28 April 1906 in Hiller\u00f8d, Jutta Regitse Pilegaard Graae was the daughter of Julius Constantin Pilegaard Graae (1876\u20131914) and Sigrid Christiane Sibbern K\u00f8hler (1878\u20131966). After completing realskole, she became an assistant at the Invalid Insurance Court. She then spent a year in London before taking up employment at Copenhagen's Sparekassen for Kj\u00f8benhavn og Omegn. ==Resistance work== Under the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, as the sister in law of the journalist Ebbe Munck who was involved in clandestine activities for British intelligence, Graae was able to collect information in her position at the savings bank. It was then forwarded by courier to Munck who was stationed in Stockholm, Sweden. Graee's home on Rosenstandsvej in Ordrup was also used by resistance members to deposit items to be sent to Stockholm. It was here in May 1943 that a key meeting took place between Mogens Fog, Erling Foss and Frode Jakobsen where they discussed how best to coordinate resistance work. When the Germans disbanded the Danish army and navy in August 1943, key members of the resistance had to go underground. As a result, together with Volmer Gyth and P.A. M\u00f8rch of the intelligence service, Graae moved to Stockholm where she acted as secretary and hostess. She became so knowledgeable of resistance activities that in October 1944 she was invited to London to advise Major-General R.H. Dewing who was planning operations in Denmark. The following January she was transferred to the Special Operations Executive which was responsible for coordinating illegal contacts with Denmark. She published her memoirs of her involvement in the Danish resistance in V\u00e6rnepligt (1995). ==Post-war activities== After the war, Graae moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked at the Danish embassy under Henrik Kauffmann. In 1947, she returned to Denmark to join the Defence Intelligence Service, where she became chief archivist in 1956 until her retirement in 1960. In December 1960, she married the estate owner Flemming Juncker (1904\u20132002) whom she had met while working in London. On 25 March 1997, Jutta Graae died in Havndal in the east of Jutland where she is buried in the local cemetery. ==Awards and honours== In 1947, Graae was awarded the Order of the British Empire. She was also honoured with King Christian X's medal for participation in World War II. In 1991, she received the Ebbe Munck prize. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Hiller\u00f8d Municipality Category:Danish resistance members Category:Danish female resistance members Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:20th-century Danish writers Category:Danish women writers Category:Danish archivists ",
