The building today is only a wing of the original castle, which was the seat of the Captain of the Park, the authority administering the Parco Visconteo on behalf of the Visconti family. ==History== Since the 12th century the area had been occupied by a Cistercians monastery. In 1325 the Fiamberti family of Pavia acquired goods and lands in the area and between 1325 and 1341 they built the original castle. In the sixties of the fourteenth century, Galeazzo II Visconti acquired the castle from the Fiamberti. The castle was completed by the Visconti family and incorporated in the Parco Visconteo. == References == ==External links== * Beni Culturali \u2013 Castello di Mirabello Category:Castles in Lombardy Category:Buildings and structures in Pavia ",
