    "text": "John from the kindred P\u00e9c (; died between 1321 and 1327) was a Hungarian lord at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, who served as isp\u00e1n of Veszpr\u00e9m County in 1295. ==Biography== John originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) P\u00e9c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. His father was Denis, an influential baron and skilled military leader during the second half of the 13th century. John had an unidentified sister, who married Stephen Hah\u00f3t.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) John first appears in contemporary records in 1292. He was a confidant of King Andrew III's mother Queen mother Tomasina Morosini, who governed the southern parts of the kingdom as Duchess of Slavonia. John served his lady as Master of the cupbearers in her court. Simultaneously, he also functioned as isp\u00e1n of Veszpr\u00e9m County. By then, inheriting the Mar\u00f3csa (present-day Morav\u010de, Croatia) lordship, he owned the castle of Zelna (today ruins in Sveti Ivan Zelina, Croatia), which was built by his father in the previous decades. His castellan was a certain Paul (\"Churkan\") in that same year. John is last mentioned by sources in 1321. He died childless. His cousin and closest living relative, Nicholas Ludbregi inherited the castle of Zelna (Zelina) from him, according to a document issued in 1327, which suggests, John had died by then. == References == == Sources == * * * Category:1320s deaths Category:13th- century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people John ",
