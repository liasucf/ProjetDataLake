    "text": "Constantin Valentin Budescu (; born 19 February 1989) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays mainly as an attacking midfielder for Astra Giurgiu. He began his senior career at Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti, amassing over 150 appearances throughout the course of six seasons before transferring to Astra Ploie\u0219ti in 2011. With the latter club, which relocated to Giurgiu, he won one Cupa Rom\u00e2niei and one Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei, both in 2014. He had a brief spell with Chinese team Dalian Yifang in early 2016, returned to Astra and then signed for FCSB in June 2017. ==Club career== ===Early years / Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti=== Budescu was born in Manasia, a commune near Urziceni in Ialomi\u021ba County. At the age of 12, with his first team Rapid S\u0103lciile, he once scored \"13 goals in one match\". In 2007, Budescu made his debut in Liga II for Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti whilst still a junior player. Gradually, he imposed himself as a regular first-team member, eventually catching the eye of Rapid Bucure\u0219ti, Politehnica Timi\u0219oara and FC Bra\u0219ov. In 2009, following the transfer of Lauren\u021biu Marinescu to Unirea Urziceni, Budescu took over the number 10 jersey. ===Astra Giurgiu=== In the 2011 summer, Budescu signed a contract with cross-town rivals Astra Ploie\u0219ti, later relocated and renamed Astra Giurgiu. On 21 July 2013, he scored his first hat-trick in Liga I, in the 4\u20130 away win against Viitorul Constan\u021ba. Four days later, during their first ever appearance in the UEFA Europa League, he netted twice in a 2\u20131 success at Omonia as his team played 30 minutes with one player less and qualified to the third round; due to his exploits, he was dubbed the \"Hero of Nicosia\". On 21 August 2014, Budescu scored a penalty against French side Lyon in the first leg of the Europa League play-off (2\u20131 away win, qualification on the away goals rule). On 6 August of the following year, in the same competition but in the third qualifying round, his second leg brace helped defeat West Ham United 2\u20131 at home and 4\u20133 on aggregate. ===Dalian Yifang=== In January 2016, Astra rejected an offer from Steaua Bucure\u0219ti for Budescu. The following month he signed a three-year contract with China League One club Dalian Yifang for an undisclosed fee, with a salary worth \u20ac3 million plus \u20ac500,000 upon signature. Budescu was loaned to his previous club in August 2016, being released by the Asians the following January. ===Return to Astra=== On 26 January 2017, Budescu chose to stay once again with Astra Giurgiu, joining on a one-and-a-half-year contract. On 16 February, he netted a goal against Genk in a 2\u20132 Europa League round of 32 home draw. ===FCSB=== On 10 June 2017, FCSB activated Budescu's release clause. He subsequently signed a four-year deal with the club, being assigned the number 11 shirt. Budescu scored on his debut on 16 July 2017, in a 2\u20131 home victory against FC Voluntari. He again found the net nine days later, converting a free kick in a Champions League third qualifying round home draw to Viktoria Plze\u0148; on 20 December, he was announced by the Gazeta Sporturilor newspaper as the winner of the 2017 Romanian Footballer of the Year award. On 15 February 2018, Budescu offered an assist as Harlem Gnoh\u00e9r\u00e9 scored the only goal of a Europa League round of 32 first leg match with Lazio. ===Al-Shabab=== On 28 June 2018, Budescu penned a three-year deal with Saudi Professional League team Al- Shabab for a reported transfer fee of \u20ac2.5 million, rejoining his former Astra coach Marius \u0218umudic\u0103. ===Third return to Astra=== On 19 August 2019, Astra owner Ioan Niculae confirmed the return of the 30-year-old player, signing a contract on two years. ==International career== Budescu played an unofficial match for Romania B in a 1\u20134 friendly defeat against Poland, in February 2013. His debut for the full side was made two years later, as he came on as a 78th- minute substitute in a 0\u20130 away draw against Hungary for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. On 11 October 2015, Budescu scored a brace against Faroe Islands, helping the country achieve qualification by finishing second in the group one point behind Northern Ireland. ==Style of play== Budescu is regarded as a creative player, with exceptional free kick skills as well as accurate long shots. However, he has also been criticized for his lack of work rate. ==Personal life== Budescu is nicknamed \"S\u0103rm\u0103lu\u021b\u0103\", due to his weakness for traditional food. In October 2014, he married M\u0103d\u0103lina in Ploie\u0219ti, with former footballer D\u0103nu\u021b Coman acting as best man. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti |- |2005\u201306 |14||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||15||4 |- |2006\u201307 |32||7||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||32||7 |- |2007\u201308 |34||10||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||34||10 |- |2008\u201309 |27||6||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||30||7 |- |2009\u201310 |32||7||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||32||7 |- |2010\u201311 |12||7||2||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||14||9 |- !Total !151!!41!!6!!3!!\u2013!!\u2013!!\u2013!!\u2013!!\u2013!!\u2013!!157!!44 |- |rowspan=\"11\"|Astra Giurgiu |- |2010\u201311 |6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||6||0 |- |2011\u201312 |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||9||0 |- |2012\u201313 |26||12||5||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||31||15 |- |2013\u201314 |28||13||6||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||7||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||41||21 |- |2014\u201315 |28||10||0||0||3||1||10||1||1||0||42||12 |- |2015\u201316 |18||8||2||1||1||0||6||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||27||12 |- |2016\u201317 |27||6||5||4||1||1||8||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||41||13 |- |2019\u201320 |21||6||1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||22||6 |- |2020\u201321 |2||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||1 |- !Total !165!!56!!19!!12!!5!!2!!31!!10!!1!!0!!221!!80 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Dalian Yifang |- |2016 |4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||4||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|FCSB |- |2017\u201318 |27||9||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||9||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||37||13 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Al- Shabab |- |2018\u201319 |22||7||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||24||8 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career Total !355||112||28||16||5||2||40||14||1||0||429||144 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Romania |2015||5||2 |- |2016||0||0 |- |2017||4||2 |- |2018||4||1 |- |2019||0||0 |- |2020||0||0 |- ! colspan=2|Total!!13!!5 |} ===International goals=== (Romania score listed first, score column indicates score after each Budescu goal) {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |- ! # !!
