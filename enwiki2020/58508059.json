    "text": "Testosterone propionate/testosterone phenylpropionate/testosterone isocaproate (TP/TPP/TiC), sold under the brand name Sustanon 100 (Organon), is an injectable combination medication of four testosterone esters, all of which are androgens/anabolic steroids. They include: * 20 mg testosterone propionate * 40 mg testosterone phenylpropionate * 40 mg testosterone isocaproate They are provided as an oil solution and are administered by intramuscular injection. The different testosterone esters provide for different elimination half-lives in the body. Esterification of testosterone provides for a sustained but non-linear release of testosterone hormone from the injection depot into the circulation. The medication was a smaller dose than Sustanon 250 and was usually reserved for pediatric use. Sustanon 100 has not been produced since 2009. ==See also== * Testosterone propionate/testosterone phenylpropionate/testosterone isocaproate/testosterone decanoate * Testosterone propionate/testosterone phenylpropionate/testosterone isocaproate/testosterone caproate * List of combined sex-hormonal preparations \u00a7 Androgens ==References== Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Androstanes Category:Combined androgen formulations Category:Prodrugs Category:Testosterone ",
