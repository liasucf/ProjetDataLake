Born in Sellersburg, Indiana, Prentice attended Indiana University, and received an LL.B. from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law in 1942.Minde C. Browning, Richard Humphrey, and Bruce Kleinschmidt, \"Biographical Sketches of Indiana Supreme Court Justices\", Indiana Law Review, Vol. 30, No. 1 (1997), section reproduced in Indiana Courts Justice Biographies page. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, from 1942 to 1946, after which he practiced law in Sellersburg until his appointment to the Supreme Court of Indiana, in 1970. During his tenure on the Court, he served as a commissioner of the National Conference on Uniform State Laws.Three Judges Subject to Bar Poll, 20 Res Gestae 344, 344-45 (1976). He was also \"one of the driving forces\" behind the adoption of the \"lazy judge rule\", which enabled parties to seek the substitution of a judge who they considered to be too slow-acting in their case. Prentice resigned from the court in 1985, and died on July 20, 2014, in Tucson, Arizona at age 95. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Justices of the Indiana Supreme Court Category:Indiana Democrats ",
