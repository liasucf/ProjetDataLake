They reached the second round of the Scottish Cup after a 6\u20131 win away to East Stirlingshire but were eliminated after a second replay by Scottish Football League side Rangers. The defence of Kilmarnock's Ayrshire Cup win from the previous season began with convincing wins against Lanemark - 5\u20131 at Rugby Park - and Stewarton Cunninghame - 14\u20130 at Standalone Park. The run came to an end after a 4\u20133 home defeat to Annbank in the third round. There was success in the Kilmarnock Merchants' Charity Cup as Kilmarnock lifted the trophy for the third time after defeating Kilmarnock Athletic 5\u20130 in the semi-final and Hurlford 2\u20131 in the final. ==Scottish Alliance== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Date !Opponents !H / A !Result F\u2013A !Scorers !Attendance !League position |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |15 August 1891 |Thistle |H |5\u20131 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |22 August 1891 |Port Glasgow Athletic |A |6\u20133 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |29 August 1891 |East Stirlingshire |A |4\u20133 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |12 September 1891 |Airdrieonians |H |6\u20131 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |19 September 1891 |St Bernard's |A |2\u20133 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |26 September 1891 |Northern |H |5\u20132 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffffcc |10 October 1891 |Port Glasgow Athletic |H |0\u20130 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |24 October 1891 |Linthouse |H |2\u20130 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |5 December 1891 |Ayr |H |7\u20130 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |6 February 1892 |Morton |H |8\u20131 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |13 February 1892 |Partick Thistle |A |2\u20133 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |27 February 1892 |King's Park |H |4\u20131 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |5 March 1892 |Linthouse |A |1\u20133 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |19 March 1892 |Northern |A |0\u20132 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |26 March 1892 |East Stirlingshire |H |5\u20130 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |2 April 1892 |King's Park |A |3\u20135 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |9 April 1892 |St Bernard's |H |1\u20130 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |16 April 1892 |Thistle |A |3\u20132 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffffcc |23 April 1892 |Morton |A |3\u20133 | | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |16 April 1892 |Partick Thistle |H |5\u20130 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |7 May 1892 |Airdrieonains |A |2\u20135 | | | |-bgcolor=#ffffcc |14 May 1892 |Ayr |A |1\u20131 | | | |} ;Notes ==Scottish Cup== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F\u2013A !Scorers !Attendance |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |28 November 1891 |First round |East Stirlingshire |A |6\u20131 |Campbell, Tannahill (2), McAvoy |3,000 |-bgcolor=#ffffcc |19 December 1891 |Second round |Rangers |A |0\u20130 | |2,000 |-bgcolor=#ffffcc |26 December 1891 |Second round replay |Rangers |H |1\u20131 |Brodie |3,000 |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |23 January 1892 |Second round second replay |Rangers |N |2\u20133 |Kelvin, McPherson |5,000 |} ==Ayrshire Cup== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F\u2013A !Scorers !Attendance |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |31 October 1891 |First round |Lanemark |H |5\u20131 | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |21 November 1891 |Second round |Stewarton Cunninghame |A |14\u20130 | | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |12 December 1891 |Third round |Annbank |H |3\u20134 | | |} ==Kilmarnock Merchants' Charity Cup== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Date !Round !Opponents !H / A !Result F\u2013A !Scorers !Attendance |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |26 April 1892 |Semi-final |Kilmarnock Athletic |H |5\u20130 | | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |21 May 1892 |Final |Hurlford |H |2\u20131 | | |} ==References== 1891\u201392 Category:1891\u201392 in Scottish football Category:Scottish football clubs 1891\u201392 season ",
