    "text": "The Legend of Chin is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Switchfoot. It was released on June 17, 1997 under independent label re:think Records, which was distributed by Sparrow Records. The album is titled after Jon Foreman's high school best friend, Willis Chin, whose photos and birth date are printed on the album booklet. ==Promotion and subsequent releases== An official music video was released for the song \"Chem 6A\". In 2009, it was published on the official YouTube channel of EMI. As of October 28, 2016, it has had over 130,000 views. In 2004, Switchfoot released a 3-CD compilation entitled The Early Years: 1997-2000, which encompassed their first three albums, including The Legend of Chin. In 2008, \"Concrete Girl\" was included on the band's greatest hits collection, The Best Yet, and \"Chem 6A\" was included in the Deluxe Edition Bonus DVD of The Best Yet. ==Impact== While the album never officially charted on Billboard, tracks from Legend of Chin contributed to late ' pop culture and were revitalized on subsequent Switchfoot projects. Most notably, the song \"You\" was featured on the soundtrack of 2002 movie A Walk to Remember, starring Mandy Moore and Shane West. == Critical reception == The album got a positive review from Billboard, which called it \"An intriguing and surprisingly mature effort for a debut release.\" Mike Rimmer of Cross Rhythms rated the album 7/10 and wrote, \"They may have taken their name from a surfer buzzword but this ain't no Beach Boys album. Instead, a melodic modern rock style reveals some nifty crisp guitar sounds, raspy vocals and a smattering of memorable songs and there's the problem. So much of this still washes over me and despite the fact I've played it about 15 times, it's still barely getting my attention. (...) Sonically this sounds like a great album - all the right ingredients are in place, but like a good Yorkshire pudding, even the finest ingredients won't be enough if it doesn't completely rise! There are moments when this one is more pancake than pudding. However, overall worth checking out.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== SwitchfootCD Liner Notes *Jon Foreman \u2013 guitar, vocals *Tim Foreman \u2013 bass, backing vocals *Chad Butler \u2013 drums, percussion Additional musicians *David Davidson \u2013 strings *Peter Hyrka \u2013 strings *Kristin Wilkinson \u2013 strings *Matt Slocum \u2013 strings *Eric Darken \u2013 percussion *Jimmie Lee Sloas \u2013 guitar *Charlie Peacock \u2013 rhodes, trumpet *Lucas Eddens \u2013 scratching; turntables ==References== ==External links== * The Legend of Chin song lyrics * The Legend of Chin song stories Category:1997 debut albums Category:Switchfoot albums Category:Albums produced by Jimmie Lee Sloas ",
