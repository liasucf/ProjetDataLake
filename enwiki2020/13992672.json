The following year (1926), he went to the I Juegos Centroamericanos (1st Central American Games) held in Mexico. He won the gold in the 400 meters (6:06.3) and 1500 meters (26:17.7), as an individual and a gold medal as member of the relay swimming team 4x100, along with Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, Alberto Gou y Gonzalo Silverio. Four years later (1930), he competed in the II Juegos Centroamericanos (2nd Central American Games) held in Havana. He again won the 400 meters (5:28.6), the 1500 meters (22:22.0), and the relay of 4x100 with Gonzalo Silverio, Cosme Carol and Pablo La Rosa (4:26.2). He also won a silver medal in the 100 meters, just behind his teammate Pablo La Rosa. A little after the 1930 games he suffered an accident and had to retire from competitive swimming. From then on until just before his death he was a teacher and swimming coach. In the 1950s Smith was the swimming coach at Belen School. The Cuban government in 1999, declared that from then on June 30 would be the Day of the Swimmer in his honor. ==References== * Diario Digital article * Palabra Nueva article * Somos Jovenes article * Cuba Ahora article * Granma article * People's Daily article * Prensa Latina article * Natacion article * Prensa Latina article * Enl@ce article * Pasaje Deportivo article * Cuba Ahora article Category:1909 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Varadero Category:Cuban male swimmers Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Cuba Category:Central American and Caribbean Games silver medalists for Cuba Category:Competitors at the 1926 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Competitors at the 1930 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in swimming ",
