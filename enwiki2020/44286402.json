    "text": "Marquis Charles-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean-Maxime de Redon des Chapelles was a theatrically-obsessed aristocrat under the French ancien r\u00e9gime, and a former French cavalry officer, who in Napoleon's France became one of the more prolific authors for the popular stage, writing melodramas and vaudevilles for the boulevard theatres. ==Career== Particularly in the earlier part of his dramatic career, he often worked in collaboration with others, many of them still obscure even now, including composers as well as writers: many of his dramas include songs and ensembles. Almost all survive in copies printed at the time.Catalogue of the Bibliotheue Nationale de France Maxime de Redon also wrote a small number of prose works, one of which touches on political themes. His dramatic career extended from 1805 until at least 1838, ending with a parody of Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas, but almost all details of de Redon's personal life are obscure. His initial successes as a dramatist came in the brief period of Napoleon's Consulate and then Empire, before the Emperor clamped down on plays, from 1807 severely restricting the number of licensed Parisian theatres. After the fall of Napoleon in 1814 and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, de Redon appears to have become embroiled in the subsequent controversy surrounding the restitution of property and financial compensation to those \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had suffered loss or expropriation under the Revolution - a controversy which in part contributed to the fall in 1830 of Louis XVIII. Redon's two pamphlets on the subject are a plea for such restitution; and in the lists of such payments issued by the Ministry of Finance the following year, List for the D\u00e9partement du Gers his father Marquis Charles de Redon (briefly Colonel-in-Chief of the 25th Line Regiment of Infantry, previously the R\u00e9giment de Poitou) is listed as '\u00e9migr\u00e9' and Maxime de Redon as his 'fils et seul h\u00e9ritier.' Redon's sycophantic verses attached as a preface to one volume of the contemporary Annales de la litt\u00e9rature et des arts 5e. ann\u00e9e, vol. 17, 1824 suggest that he was still, or had returned to being, a fervent supporter of the Bourbons. == Dramatic works == with collaborators, and date and location of first performance, as given in subsequent publication *Grimou, ou le Portrait \u00e0 finir, with Pasquier (16 April 1805, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-\u00c9l\u00e8ves) *L'intrigue dans la rue, ou le Professeur de Montmartre, with Defr\u00e9noy (21 September 1805, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-\u00c9l\u00e8ves) *R\u00e9ussirons-nous?, with Defr\u00e9noy (21 September 1805, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-\u00c9l\u00e8ves) *L'Amant instituteur, with Defr\u00e9noy (12 October 1805, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-\u00c9l\u00e8ves) *Avis aux p\u00e8res, ou la Fille corrig\u00e9e, with Defr\u00e9noy (16 May 1806, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Artistes) *Le Ch\u00e2teau myst\u00e9rieux, ou le Crime commis et veng\u00e9 (12 July 1806, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Artistes) *La Bavarde, with Defr\u00e9noy and Lesueur (2 August 1806, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes- Artistes) *Une espi\u00e8glerie d'Arlequin, ou l'Enl\u00e8vement nocturne, with Defr\u00e9noy (21 August 1806, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Artistes) *Quatorze ans de souffrance, ou le Solitaire des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, with Defr\u00e9noy (24 December 1806, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Artistes) *Les Illustres infortun\u00e9s, ou la Souveraine vindictive, with Defr\u00e9noy (8 January 1807, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-\u00c9l\u00e8ves) *Le Pied de boeuf et la queue du chat, with Charrin (9 June 1807, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Artistes) *La Famille des guerriers (1 August 1807, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Artistes) *Confidence pour confidence, with Cantiran de Boirie (31 January 1811, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice) *Les \u00e9coliers (4 November 1823, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *Le Souvenir et l'oubli, ou la Journ\u00e9e d'un bon ma\u00eetre (8 November 1825, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *Les Princes d'\u00c9cosse, ou les Ruines de la for\u00eat (27 December 1827, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *La Boutique myst\u00e9rieuse, ou les Deux voisins (22 October 1828, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *La Muette (13 April 1828, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *Le Jaloux, ou la Maison de sant\u00e9 (16 July 1828, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *Le Faux ermite (29 August 1828, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *La Journ\u00e9e aux \u00e9v\u00e8nements (13 March 1829, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Luxembourg) *L'Oreille du diable (28 September 1837, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Dorsay) *Ruy-Brac (28 November 1838, theatre unknown) == Theatres == Many of the lesser Parisian theatres underwent various changes of name during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods Popular Theatres of 19th Century France. McCormick, J.: London, Routledge, 1993 even if the physical building remained constant. Sometimes also theatre names disappeared, only to be re-used later. Thus one of the many popular theatres staging melodramas, vaudevilles, etc., the The\u00e2tre du Luxembourg (see 1823 et seq.) which sometimes appears also as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre forainforain: fairground du Luxembourg, was situated in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, at no. 6 rue de Fleurus, just outside the Jardin du Luxembourg. It is not to be confused with the present-day marionette theatre within the Gardens themselves. Established in 1816 by the impresario-actor-clown-prompter-showman styling himself Bobino or Bobineau (real name: Saix), and thus sometimes also referred to as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Bobino, the wooden building was demolished in 1868. In the years between 1823 and 1829, Maxime de Redon had several premi\u00e8res at this small theatre. == Prose writings == *Entretiens sur les quatre premi\u00e8res r\u00e8gles de l'arithm\u00e9tique (1812) *Les hommes et les principes (1820) *De l'\u00e9migration et des indemnit\u00e9s (n.d.) *R\u00e9flexions sur l'\u00e9migration, l'indemnit\u00e9 et les circulaires minist\u00e9rielles (1825) == Verses and songs == *Voyage hors des barri\u00e8res (1815) *Chansons de M. le Marquis de Redon (1815) == References == == External links == * Bibliography compiled by Joseph-Marie Qu\u00e9rard in La France litt\u00e9raire, 1835 Category:19th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:French Marquesses ",
