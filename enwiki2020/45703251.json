    "text": "Woodlawn Farm is a historic farm located at 1463 Gerkie Lane east of Jacksonville, Illinois. Michael Huffaker, one of Morgan County's first settlers, established the farm in the 1820s after buying up a large section of land. Due to the many agricultural innovations of the 1830s, Huffaker earned a significant amount of money from his farm and became one of the county's wealthiest residents. Huffaker mainly raised livestock, particularly cattle and pigs, on his farm; while he also grew crops, they mainly served as feed. In 1840, Huffaker built the farm's farmhouse, an I-house with a Greek Revival entrance and frieze. According to local tradition, the house was a stop on the Underground Railroad; as Huffaker employed many free black farmhands, he could conceal escaped slaves among his workers. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 6, 2007. ==References== ==External links== * Woodlawn Farm Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:I-houses in Illinois Category:Greek Revival houses in Illinois Category:Houses completed in 1840 Category:Houses in Morgan County, Illinois Category:Museums in Morgan County, Illinois Category:Historic house museums in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Morgan County, Illinois Category:Farms in Illinois ",
