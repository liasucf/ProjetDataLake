    "text": "Rock of Ages is a 2012 American jukebox musical comedy film directed by Adam Shankman and based on the rock jukebox Broadway musical Rock of Ages by Chris D'Arienzo. Starring country singer Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta leading an ensemble cast that includes Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Malin \u00c5kerman, Mary J. Blige, Bryan Cranston and Tom Cruise, the film features the music of many 1980s Rock and Glam Rock artists including Def Leppard, Journey, Scorpions, Poison, Foreigner, Guns N' Roses, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Bon Jovi, Twisted Sister, Whitesnake, REO Speedwagon, and others. Originally scheduled to enter production in summer 2009 for a 2011 release, it eventually commenced production in May 2011 and was released on June 15, 2012. The film received mixed critical reviews and grossed only $59 million worldwide. However, Cruise was particularly lauded for his performance of \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" and \"Wanted Dead or Alive\". The related film soundtrack also did critically well, certified Gold in Canada. ==Plot== In 1987 Los Angeles, Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) arrives from Oklahoma with dreams of becoming a singer. Barback Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) prepares for another night at The Bourbon Room (\"Sister Christian/Just Like Paradise/Nothin' But a Good Time\"). Sherrie's suitcase is stolen, and Drew gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Room. The club's owner, Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin), and his right-hand man, Lonny Barnett (Russell Brand), are desperate to save the club from a tax debt. They book Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise), a detached and self-indulgent rock star preparing for his final gig with his band, Arsenal. Drew tells Sherrie his own dreams of becoming a rock star, but that he has stagefright (\"Juke Box Hero/I Love Rock 'n' Roll\"). Learning of Stacee's upcoming concert, Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta- Jones), conservative wife of the mayor (Bryan Cranston), organizes a protest in front of the club (\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\") Drew and Sherrie have their first date at the Hollywood Sign, where Drew reveals he is writing a song for Sherrie (\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\"). On the night of Arsenal's final show, Dennis learns the opening act has cancelled; Sherrie convinces him to use Drew's band, Wolfgang Von Colt (\"More Than Words/Heaven\"). Stacee's manager, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti), schedules an interview with Constance Sack (Malin \u00c5kerman), a reporter for Rolling Stone. Constance mentions rumors of Stacee's difficult behavior and implies he was kicked out of Arsenal, which Stacee denies (\"Wanted Dead or Alive\"). Stacee sends Sherrie for a bottle of scotch from his limo. Constance lashes out at the once-great Stacee; they recognize their mutual attraction and are about to have sex when Stacee sings (\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"). Ashamed, Constance leaves as Sherrie enters and collides with Stacee. Drew mistakenly believes that Sherrie and Stacee had sex, and is angrily inspired to sing (\"I Wanna Rock\") for the opening act. Drew and Sherrie break up and she quits the Bourbon Room. Drew tries to run after her but Paul, impressed with his performance, offers him a record deal as Arsenal sings their last song of the night (\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\"). Sherrie takes refuge at strip club the Venus Club (\"Harden My Heart\"), where owner Justice Charlier (Mary J. Blige) offers her a job as a dancer (\"Shadows of the Night/Harden My Heart\"), but Sherrie chooses to wait tables. She realizes she needs more money, as Drew signs to Gill's record label (\"Here I Go Again\"). Dennis worries the Bourbon Room will close and that he has let everyone down. Lonny confesses his love for him, and Dennis reciprocates (\"Can't Fight This Feeling\"). Drew realizes his record deal makes him part of hip-hop boy band \"The Z Guyeezz\" as Joshie Zee, while Sherrie decides to becomes a dancer at the Venus Club (\"Any Way You Want It\"). Sherrie visits the Hollywood sign, where she finds Drew, whose life has also not gone as planned. She tells him she did not have sex with Stacee and will be returning to Oklahoma. They part ways, lamenting their situation (\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\"). Stacee realizes his feelings for Constance and calls Rolling Stone to learn that she is covering his show at The Bourbon Room. Stacee rushes to the venue, where Lonny leads the patrons against Patricia's protest group (\"We're Not Gonna Take It/We Built This City\"). Stacee recognizes Patricia, whom Lonny exposes as a former Arsenal groupie. Drew buys back Sherrie's stolen records and drops them off at the strip club. The Z Guyeezz are rejected by the crowd; Drew spots Sherrie in the audience and leaves the stage. They reconcile and Drew fires Paul. Sherrie reunites Wolfgang Von Colt onstage, where she and Drew perform the song he wrote for her (\"Don't Stop Believin'\"). Stacee, having sex with Constance in the bathroom, is moved by the song. Eight months later, Stacee has rejoined Arsenal and performs the song with Drew and Sherrie, now part of Wolfgang Von Colt, at Dodger Stadium in front of a crowd including Dennis, Lonny, Justice, a pregnant Constance, and Patricia, returned to her rock 'n' roll persona. ==Cast== * Julianne Hough as Sherrie Christian * Diego Boneta as Drew Boley * Russell Brand as Lonny Barnett * Paul Giamatti as Paul Gill * Catherine Zeta-Jones as Patricia Whitmore * Malin \u00c5kerman as Constance Sack * Mary J.

All of the actors sing their own parts in the film. Cruise told People Weekly Magazine that he had always wanted to appear in a musical but he found the idea frightening because he was uncertain whether he could actually pull it off.The full interview was published in the June 26, 2012 issue of People Weekly Magazine.

It creates a piece of something on screen that I don't have to fabricate.\" Of Boneta's audition, Shankman said, \"It's that feeling you get when you realized you've discovered lightning in a bottle. It reminds me of when Zac Efron auditioned for Hairspray, Channing Tatum for Step Up, and Liam Hemsworth auditioned for The Last Song.

The film did, however, do slightly better business than the other newcomer, That's My Boy. Rock of Ages was a box office bomb, grossing $38,518,613 in North America and $20,900,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $59,418,613, failing to bring back its $75 million budget. However, the film still has the seventh-highest opening ever for a musical. ===Critical reception=== Tom Cruise saw positive reviews for his performance as Stacee Jaxx, with critics making parallels to his previous work in the films Interview with the Vampire and Magnolia. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and has a critical score of 42% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 228 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's consensus states: \"its exuberant silliness is almost enough to make up for its utter inconsequentiality, but Rock of Ages is ultimately too bland and overlong to justify its trip to the big screen.\" Metacritic reports a 47 out of 100 rating, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Several critics gave praise to the performances, particularly that of Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Rock of Ages is pretty fun despite a terrible script, bland leads and awful wigs, mainly thanks to a performance by Tom Cruise as fictional hair metal rocker Stacee Jaxx.\" Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Amy Biancolli called his performance \"a revelation\", calling it a \"reminder that he's always at his best in wildly transformative character parts\". Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times praised Cruise's singing, and compared his performance to his earlier work as Lestat in Interview with the Vampire. In her review, Dana Stevens of Slate found Cruise's performance the \"boldest use of the actor since Paul Thomas Anderson made him a rage-fueled motivational speaker in Magnolia\". As for the negative reviews, Rex Reed of The New York Observer was heavily critical of every aspect of the film, giving the film no stars out of his ranking of four and compared the film to Battlefield Earth and Howard the Duck. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw derided the film, and the stage musical, as \"bland and tiring\". Bradshaw also criticized Russell Brand's accent, and gave slight praise to Cruise's performance. Claudia Puig, of USA Today, criticised the main leads of the film as \"deadly dull dreamers\" and the story as \"tame and tone deaf\". Richard Corliss for Time found the cast as being wasted in the film, highlighting Baldwin, Zeta-Jones, Cranston and Cruise, whom Corliss did provide positive reception to his performance. Rock of Ages creator Chris D'Arienzo, though having not seen the film adaptation, spoke negatively on the final product. \"When the trailer came out, I saw there was a monkey in it, and then I knew what kind of movie it was. And I think America knew what sort of movie it was\". D'Arienzo voiced disappointment in how the film depicted itself, stating, Alec Baldwin, who played Dennis Dupree in the film, was also critical, calling it \"a horrible movie\" and \"a complete disaster\". Baldwin had asked New Line Cinema studio head Toby Emmerich to replace him in his role shortly before the start of production. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; vertical-align:bottom;\" ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | List of awards and nominations |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" !
