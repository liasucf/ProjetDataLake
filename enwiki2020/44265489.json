The Guardian. 10 April 2009 Bookey, Mike. \"Bromantic Comedy: Actors squeeze formulaic plot for all its laughs\" The Source Weekly. March 25, 2009. == Description == Bromance, a word that blends the words \"brother\" and \"romance\", can be defined as a \"close nonsexual friendship between men\". Miriam Webster online dictionary RAMANUJAM, SRINIVASA. \"Coming soon, a 'bromantic' comedy\" The Hindu. March 3, 2015. A bromantic comedy finds humor in reversing the formula of the typical \"romantic comedy\". In the film Knocked Up, it is not the man and woman that have the romantic chemistry, but the two men. In I Love You Man, it is not the man and woman (the bride and groom) of the story who fall in love, break up, and then are reunited romantically at the end\u2014but the two male leads. Bromantic comedy films present expressions of male intimacy, while humorously poking fun of the characters' fears of being homosexual.DeAngelis, Michael. Reading the Bromance. Homosocial Relationships in Film and Television. Wayne State University Press. 2014. Batyrefa, Amina. \"Our romance with the \"bromance\"; No homo, man.\" The McGill Daily. January 19, 2013 The \"slovenly hipster\" protagonists of the bromantic comedy usually are not mature and are lacking in ambition. They are \"beta males\" that are into porn and junk food, but they are forced to grow up when they discover \"straight arrow\" women, children and responsibility.\"King of bromance: Judd Apatow\" Independent. 19 August 2009. It is a story of \"the dissolution of a male pack, the ending of a juvenile male bond,\" according to David Denby in The New Yorker.Denby, David. \"A Fine Romance; The new comedy of the sexes\". The New Yorker. July 23, 2007. Bromantic comedies contain the concept of a \"code\" between men: \"bros before hos\". The idea is that the bonds between men are more significant, stronger, deeper and based on mutual understanding, whereas the bonds between a man and a woman can be capricious, shallow and less satisfying. So, if a man leaves his male friends for a woman, he will eventually be dumped, abandoned, betrayed, and/or dominated. This may be too dark for comedy, so bromantic comedies deal with misogyny with tentativeness. There is often an element in the plot that allows the men to go off on their own, away from the women. Examples of this are the \"man cave\" of I Love You, Man, or the \"mancation\" of The Hangover. Aisenberg, Joseph. Bright Lights Film Journal. July 31, 2009. According to film scholar Timothy Shary in Millennial Masculinity: Men in Contemporary American Cinema, a number of films in this genre, like Wedding Crashers, provide a surprising level of bisexuality for its male characters, and a place for more diversified male relationships to exist.Shary, Timothy, author and editor. Millennial Masculinity: Men in Contemporary American Cinema. Wayne State University Press (2012) Shakespeare's play, Love's Labor's Lost, provides, in its opening passage,Text of Love's Labour's Lost at MIT.edu a comedic prototype for the idea of men agreeing to a \"code\" to sequester themselves and avoid romance with the opposite sex. Tranquilli, Marrissa. \"That Awkward Boredom: A Bromantic Comedy\". The Cornell Daily Sun. February 7, 2014Woudhuysen, H. R., ed. Love's Labours Lost (London: Arden Shakespeare, 1998): 61. Judd Apatow is a prominent director of the bromantic comedy genre. His films The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005),Cateridge, James. Film Studies For Dummies. John Wiley & Sons (2015) page 120. and Knocked Up (2007) paved the way for a surge of similar films that were released in the mid-late 2000s.Setoodeh, Ramin. \"Isn't It Bromantic?\" Newsweek 8 June 2009: 73. Academic OneFile. Web. 24 Oct. 2014. Films from this era found an audience for the comedic depiction of same-sex relationships, something to which male viewers could relate, but which had been overlooked by screenwriters.Filippo, Maria San. The B Word: Bisexuality in Contemporary Film and Television. Indiana University Press (2013) . Page 225-226. == History == Aspects of \"bromantic comedies\", including male camaraderie, are found in Barry Levinson's 1982 film, Diner.Stewart, Sara. \"'Awkward' Is the Latest Evolution in Bromantic Comedy.\" New York Post. N.p., 30 Jan. 2014. Web. 31 Oct. 2014. In that film, a group of six male friends struggle with growing up and finding their way in the real world, while they have each other to support them along the way. A similar situation occurs in the films Kicking and Screaming (1995) and The Hangover (2009). With John Hamburg's I Love You Man the genre seems to have reached a particular apogee, as the film goes very far in its depiction of bromance, while receiving many excellent reviews. Wilonsky, Robert. \"I LOVE YOU MAN REACHES BROMANTIC COMEDY'S GREATEST HEIGHTS\". The Village Voice. March 18, 2009 Gleiberman, Owen. \"I Love You, Man; review\" Entertainment weekly March 18, 2009 Metacritic. March 2009 \"I Love You, Man; review\" Premier Magazine.

Then he meets Jason Segel's character, Sydney, who is friendly and a great complement to Peter, but their bromance starts to impact the groom's relationship with his bride-to-be. Broadway has borrowed the idea of the bromantic comedy from the movies and wedded it to the traditional musical form in The Book of Mormon and The Producers.Viertel, Jack. The Secret Life of the American Musical; How Broadway Shows are Built. Sarah Crichton Books. (2016) . page 15 ==Criticism== The genre has its critics who accuse it of political incorrectness and a variety of insensitivities, Freeman, Hadley. \"The Once Mighty Bromance is Dead; and Get Hard Killed it\". The Guardian. 1 April 2015 but the films are satires, and in that sense, the exposing of social ills may be considered to have some potentially positive effect.Baumgarten, Marjory. \"The Interview; film review\" The Austin Chronicle. January 2, 1015 A primary comedic target of the bromantic comedy is the idea that there is a \"code\" of male behavior that may tend to impede men from relating in a realistic or natural way with both men and women. Using satire and ridicule the films expose the flimsy ideology and the fears that are the basis of such \"codes\".Garfield, Robert. Breaking the Male Code: Unlocking the Power of Friendship. Gotham (2015) .DeAngelis, Michael. Radner, Hillary. Reading the Bromance: Homosocial Relationships in Film and Television. \"Grumpy Old Men; Bros Before Hos\". Wayne State University Press (2014) . Page 52. However, social critic David Hartwell concludes that beneath a facade of progressive and liberating motivation, the bromantic comedy genre is ultimately guilty of \"perpetuating the ideologies it is trying (or pretending) to critique.\" Hartwell, David B. True Bromance: Representation of Masculinity and Heteronormative Dominance in the Bromantic Comedy. University of North Texas (2013) == Themes and elements of bromantic comedies == * Male bonding and homosocial bonding * Conflicts with heterosexual bonding * Emphasis of bromance and rejection of homoeroticism, and deliberate confusion of homosocial/homoerotic relationships * There is a focus on male self- consciousness. * An element in the plot that allows the men to go off on their own, away from the women, for example, the \"man cave\" of I Love You, Man, the males-only vacation of The Hangover, or the wedding activities involving the groomsmen in The Wedding Ringer * Infantilism of the male characters * Humor guards the boundary between what is acceptable or unacceptable in a guy's interests * The humor often extends to being considered \"rude\" or \"raunchy\". Gilman, Greg.\" That Awkward Moment; Reviews: Is This Bromantic Comedy Actually Funny?\" The Wrap. January 31, 2014Ordona, Michael. \"Wedding Ringer review: A bromantic comedy that goes there\". SFGate. January 15, 2015. * The films may be referred to as \"wacky\". * Misogynistic elements are often found in the film narrativeDeAngelis, Michael. Reading the Bromance. Homosocial Relationships in Film and Television. Wayne State University Press (2014) . According to DeAngelis, a difference between the \"buddy film\" and the \"bromance\" narrative is that \"women are often treated misogynistically as loving yet controlling and annoying interferences whose demands must always be 'dealt with.'\" And later DeAngelis describes this as a structure \"central to bromance\". ==Notable bromantic comedy films== * Dude, Where's My Car?
