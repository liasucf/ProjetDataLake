    "text": "Fables is a book by Arnold Lobel. Released by Harper & Row, it was the recipient of the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1981.American Library Association: Caldecott Medal Winners, 1938 - Present. URL accessed 27 May 2009. For each of the twenty fables Lobel's text occupies one page, with his colour illustration on the facing page. He gives a moral to each, but while the moral is genuine, the tone of the fables is cheerful and playful rather than moralistic. For instance, in the first fable a bed-loving crocodile admires the orderly pattern of flowers on his bedroom wallpaper. When confronted with the riot of flowers in Mrs. Crocodile's garden he retreats to his bed in distress, where he is comforted by the neat floral rows of the wallpaper. After that he seldom leaves his bed, becoming a sickly shade of green. The moral is, \"Without a doubt, there is such a thing as too much order.\" ==List of Fables== *The Crocodile in the Bedroom (A crocodile enjoys the orderly flowered wallpaper in his bedroom, over his wife's messy garden, but becomes sickly upon never leaving) *The Ducks and the Fox (Two ducks meet a friendly fox, while taking a familiar path to their pond. But when the fox turns out to be after something else, they decide to search for a new safer path) *King Lion and the Beetle (An arrogant lion king demands that everybody, including a tiny beetle, bow to him.

The droll illustrations, with tones blended to luminescent shading, are complete and humorous themselves.\", while Kirkus Reviews found \"there's not a jot of wit, wisdom, style, or originality in these 20 flat and predictable items. The illustrations ... suffer for having less to illustrate.\" Horn Book wrote, \"the author-illustrator has invented twenty animal fables with an original flavor\" and \"Each miniature narrative occupies a page by itself and is balanced by a full-page picture which reflects the crucial event of the fable and portrays the joyfully conceived characters.\" Publishers Weekly called the book \"the most remarkable of the author-illustrator's 60-plus, bestselling award winners.\"according to the back cover of the book In a retrospective essay about the Caldecott Medal-winning books from 1976 to 1985, Barbara Bader wrote that \"in Lobel's natural hand, in spontaneous, cartoony sketches or comic stylizations, the work would have had more sparkle and less ponderousness.\" ==References== Category:1980 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Children's short story collections Category:Picture books by Arnold Lobel Category:Fables Category:Caldecott Medal-winning works Category:Harper & Row books Category:American children's books Category:Ducks in literature Category:Books about bears Category:Books about cats Category:Books about dogs Category:Books about foxes Category:Pigs in literature ",
