Canary Records became OctoArts International in 1978. It was the first record company that introduced \"minus one\" (music used for karaoke) in the market. During the 1970s, the releases of EMI Records were distributed in the Philippines by Dyna Records under the name Dyna EMI. OctoArts at that time was the distributor of Sony Music's international releases. In 1995, OctoArts began a distribution deal with EMI and became OctoArts EMI, leading to the establishment of Sony Music Philippines. In 2002, after a series of restructure, it became EMI Philippines. The PolyEast Records label initially started as a sublabel of PolyGram Philippines (later became part of Universal Music Philippines) until it was eventually acquired by EMI Philippines. It continued being an imprint of the label until 2008 when EMI withdrew from the Southeast Asian market, it became simply PolyEast Records as a joint venture between EMI itself and Piper Paper Corporation. In the period of 2012\u20132013, PolyEast became independent for the second time after EMI was absorbed into Universal Music Group (MCA Music for the Filipino market). == Partnerships == * Universal Records (Philippines) * Universal Music Group == See also == * OctoArts Films * List of record labels == References == == External links == * Category:EMI Category:Philippine record labels Category:Pop record labels Category:Rock record labels Category:Companies based in Quezon City ",
