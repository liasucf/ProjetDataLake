    "text": "Kato Mukasa is an Ugandan lawyer who plays a national and international role in the secular humanism movement. ==Background== Mukasa studied commercial law at Cavendish University Uganda and social administration at Makerere University. He credits his father, Nobert Eden Mukasa, for his interest in critical thinking and his grandfather for his skepticism of religion. By age 12, he was reading through several of the foundational books of humanism, such as the works of David Hume. He was nevertheless interested in religion at a young age; he was beaten at the age of 8 when it was found that he has taken communion without going through the preparatory rites. He attended Catholic high school, but was eventually expelled for refusing to attend mass. ==Humanist Association for Leadership, Equity and Accountability== Mukasa is heavily involved in Uganda's humanist and secular groups. He co-founded the Humanist Association for Leadership, Equity and Accountability (HALEA) in 2007 to promote critical thinking and human rights. Its monthly campus discussions are attended by people of faith and non-believers. It also sponsors students and assists young mothers in acquiring entrepreneurship skills, among other programs. He currently works for the organization, handling legal issues and building a program to train humanist celebrants. As of 2018, Mukasa was Chair of the Uganda Humanist Association. He is a former member of the board of directors of the International Humanist and Ethical Union. In a country where only 0.2 percent of the population identifies as non-religious, his public profile as a humanist and atheist made him a target for religious violence, including an attempted break-in and the burning of his automobile. The police have also been investigating burglaries and harassment against HALEA staff. ==See also== * Irreligion in Uganda ==References== Category:20th-century atheists Category:21st-century atheists Category:Atheism activists Category:Living people Category:Ugandan atheists Category:Ugandan human rights activists Category:Ugandan activists Category:Skeptics Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
