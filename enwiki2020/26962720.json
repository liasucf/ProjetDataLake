    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1810 and 1811 were elections that had the Democratic-Republican Party maintain their majority in the United States Senate. The minority Federalists had gone into the elections with such a small share of Senate seats (8 out of 34, or 23.5%) that, had they won all of the elections, they would still not have reached a majority. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Change in composition == === Before the elections === Composition after June 1810 special election in New Hampshire. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=800px |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | F | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |} === Result of the regular elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=800px |- | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR | width=50px | DR |- | colspan=9 style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | DR |- | | V | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR | | DR |- | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F | | F |} {| |- valign=top !
