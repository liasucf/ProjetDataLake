    "text": "Laureano Oubi\u00f1a Pi\u00f1eiro (born 1946), also known as El Pajarito (The Birdie), is a Spanish smuggler and drug trafficker. == Personal life == Born in Cambados, Pi\u00f1ero began working in his parents' grocery store at the age of 10, and by 15 was distributing products by van to street hawkers. He began his criminal career at the age of 17, at first participating in diesel smuggling with his uncle, and a few months later founding his own black market tobacco company. He married Rosa Mar\u00eda Otero at the age of 18, and went on to have eight children with her; however, they divorced in 1983. After the divorce, he began a relationship with Esther Lago, who had been his secretary, and had an additional three children with her. Lago died in a traffic accident on 28 February 2001. == Arrests and prosecutions == === Early criminal activity === Pi\u00f1ero's judicial record dates back to 1978, when he was sentenced to nine months in prison for bribery. A few years later, in 1983, he was arrested in Playa de Aro after the discovery of a large cargo of smuggled tobacco. Police searched a number of his companies and his personal residence, the Pazo Bai\u00f3n, on the 6th July 1989, where sophisticated telecommunications equipment and a rifle were discovered; less than a year later, on 23 April 1990, he was acquitted on charges of smuggling and illegal possession of firearms, but sentenced to four months for resisting the authorities. However, as he had served more than the sentenced time awaiting trial, he did not go to prison. === Operation Crab === On 12 June 1990, he and Esther Lago were both arrested near the R\u00eda de Arosa after an order by Baltasar Garz\u00f3n during Operaci\u00f3n N\u00e9cora (Operation Crab), a Spanish police operation against drug traffickers in Galicia. They were both sentenced on 27 September 1994 to 12 years in jail and a fine of 1,280,000,000 pesetas each for money laundering, being acquitted once again of charges of drug trafficking. On 7 December of the same year Pi\u00f1ero was released on parole, while Esther Lago did not leave prison until 1997. === Operations Sunrise and Sunset === On 21 June 1997, a truck carrying 5,741 kilograms of hashish from Galicia to the Netherlands was discovered in Martorell. Oubi\u00f1a was implicated in the smuggling, and was subsequently arrested in another raid known as Operaci\u00f3n Amanecer (Operation Sunrise). He was held in prison awaiting trial until December 1998, when he posted a bail of 15 million pesetas. In October 1999 Esther Lago and David P\u00e9rez Lago, Esther's son with her previous husband, were detained in another police operation, operaci\u00f3n Ocaso (Operation Sunset), after 15 tons of hashish were again found on a boat and connected to Oubi\u00f1a; however, he himself escaped arrest, although a warrant was issued for him. His escape was controversial as El Pa\u00eds later reported that he had been in a police station to satisfy his bail requirements just hours before fleeing custody. === Trafficking sentence and extradition === Just a few days after the culmination of Operation Sunset in October 1999, Oubi\u00f1a was for the first time sentenced for drug trafficking by the Audiencia Nacional, the Spanish high court. He was sentenced in his absence to four years and four months in prison, along with a fine of 2,400,000,000 pesetas, and an international arrest warrant was simultaneously authorised for his capture. His lawyer was also sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 1,400,000,000 pesetas. Oubi\u00f1a was detained along with his stepson David P\u00e9rez Lago in Greece in 2000, pursuant to an international arrest warrant issued against him after escaping custody during Operation Sunset. By the autumn of 2000, he had started serving his prison sentence, when his spouse died suddenly in a traffic accident. He was given permission by theAudiencia Nacional to attend her funeral and burial. In 2011, while in prison in Due\u00f1as, the Audiencia Nacional granted him \"grade 3\" prisoner status, meaning he could be held in an open prison, and was freed on 17 July 2012. He returned to prison on 6 February 2014 to serve a sentence of 4 years and 7 months which had been imposed upon him in 2012 for money laundering. On 24 February 2017, whilst in prison in Navalcarnero, a judge granted him once again grade 3 prisoner status; however, he left prison on 13 March after a battle with the prison board, who claimed that he should not have been released. == Illegal financing of the People's Alliance == In 2017, during an interview with Cadena SER, Oubi\u00f1a asserted that he had proof of his illegally financing the People's Alliance political party. == References == Category:Smugglers Category:Spanish drug traffickers Category:1946 births Category:Living people ",
