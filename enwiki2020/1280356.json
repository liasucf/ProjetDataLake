    "text": "The Parnawa Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Duchy of Livonia, part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, since it was formed in 1598 until the Swedish conquest of Livonia in the 1620s. The seat of the voivode was Parnawa (P\u00e4rnu). The voivodeship was created by King Zygmunt III Waza, and it was based on the Parnawa Presidency, created by King Stefan Batory in 1582, after the Truce of Yam-Zapolsky. It effectively ceased to exist in 1621, but officially, Parnawa Voivodeship existed until the Treaty of Oliva (1660). Its main towns were: Parnawa, Felin, Wolmar, Karkus, Salis, Lemsal, and Helme. The title of Voivode of Parnawa, as well as other local titles, remained in use until the Partitions of Poland. It was one of the so-called fictitious titles (Polish: urzad fikcyjny). ==Titular voivodes== The voivodes of Dorpat Voivodeship. *1.Ernst Magnus D\u00f6nhoff *2.Piotr Tryzna *3.Jan Zawadzki *4.Gothard Tyzenhaus *5.Henryk Doenhoff ==References== Category:Voivodeships of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Historical regions in Estonia Category:History of P\u00e4rnu Category:Geography of P\u00e4rnu Category:16th century in Estonia Category:17th century in Estonia Category:18th century in Estonia Category:Duchy of Livonia Category:1598 establishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1621 disestablishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:States and territories disestablished in the 1620s Category:Organisations based in Livonia ",
