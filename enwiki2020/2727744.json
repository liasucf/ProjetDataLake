As of the 2018\u201319 school year, the school had an enrollment of 656 students and 62.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student\u2013teacher ratio of 10.5:1.

Accessed April 1, 2020. ==History== The school was founded as Lower Camden County Regional High School in 1939, in Lindenwold. It served students from up to ten municipalities at one point. The population soon began to grow, however, and Edgewood Regional High School (now Winslow Township High School) was founded in Winslow Township. The school took the name Overbrook Regional Senior High School in the 1950s, and joined its sister school Edgewood as part of Lower Camden County Regional High School District #1. Soon, the student population became too large for the now 60+ year old building to handle, and the current building was erected in 1969 in Pine Hill. The former building became known as Overbrook Regional Junior High School. Overcrowding again became an issue in the late 90s, as Overbrook Junior High School was serving Berlin Township, Clementon, Lindenwold, Pine Hill, and portions of Winslow Township. In 1999, each of the individual school boards voted to dissolve LCCRHSD. Lindenwold would build its own high school and take over the old junior high building to make it the district's middle school. Edgewood Regional Junior High became Winslow Township Middle School, and Edgewood Senior High became Winslow Township High School. Pine Hill would build Pine Hill Middle School in the forested area next to the school. Over the next decade, the population at Overbrook slowly faded from a high of over 1700 students to a new low of just under 800 students. After 28 years at Overbrook, Paul J. Harmelin retired as principal following the 2012\u201313 school year. His replacement starting in the 2013\u201314 school year was Don Borden. Adam Lee was hired as the Principal in July 2015. Lee was a social studies teacher and then an Assistant Principal before being named the Principal. ==Awards, recognition and rankings== The school was the 282nd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology.Staff. \"Top Schools Alphabetical List 2014\", New Jersey Monthly, September 2, 2014.
