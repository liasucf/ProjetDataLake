    "text": "Whitehead Refugee Camp, HK disused in 2008 The old RAF headquarters on Kwun Tong Road, Kai Tak, which housed boat people until 1997 Bat lau dung laai ( or ; ) is a Hong Kong Cantonese corruption of the Vietnamese phrase b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u t\u1eeb nay, meaning \"from now on\" (' = begin, start; ' = \"from\", ' = \"now\"). The phrase was made famous in the 1980s and 1990s in Hong Kong, due to a Vietnamese-language radio public service announcement that was broadcast, nearly hourly, on public radio broadcaster RTHK. == Background of the radio announcement == The broadcast was first made on 16 August 1988, which announced the government's decision to implement a screening policy that would separate refugees from non-refugees (or boat people with economic motivations). The statement was read by Chung Wai-ming, a well-known RTHK radio personality. The Vietnamese portion of the broadcast was read by a Vietnamese boat person who was about to be repatriated. == Content of the announcement == ===Original text of the announcement=== The radio announcement began with a sentence in Cantonese Chinese, the most commonly spoken Chinese variant in Hong Kong. > \u9999\u6e2f[\u653f\u5e9c]\u5c0d\u8d8a\u5357\u8239\u6c11\u5df2\u7d93\u5be6\u65bd\u7504\u5225\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u8ddf\u4f4f\u55f0\u6bb5\u8d8a\u5357\u8a71\u5ee3\u64ad\uff0c\u5c31\u4fc2\u5411\u4f62\u54cb\u8b1b\u8ff0\u5462\u500b\u653f\u7b56\u5605\u5167\u5bb9\u3002 This was then followed by a paragraph in Vietnamese. > B\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u t\u1eeb nay, m\u1ed9t ch\u00ednh s\u00e1ch m\u1edbi v\u1ec1 thuy\u1ec1n nh\u00e2n Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0111\u00e3 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c ch\u1ea5p h\u00e0nh > t\u1ea1i H\u1ed3ng K\u00f4ng.

After that, the announcement ended with another sentence in Cantonese Chinese. > \u525b\u624d\u55f0\u6bb5\u8d8a\u5357\u8a71\u5ee3\u64ad\uff0c\u4fc2\u5411\u4f01\u5716\u9032\u5165\u9999\u6e2f\u5605\u8d8a\u5357\u8239\u6c11\uff0c\u8b1b\u8ff0\u9999\u6e2f\u5c0d\u4f62\u54cb\u5be6\u65bd\u5605\u7504\u5225\u653f\u7b56\u35ce\u3002 ===Meaning of the announcement in English=== The first sentence in Cantonese Chinese: The message in Vietnamese: The final sentence in Cantonese Chinese: == Use of the phrase in Hong Kong == Due to the frequency of the broadcast, many Hong Kong people came to learn the phrase. Some, however, mistook the phrase as a term of greeting, similar to sawasdee in Thai. The phrase eventually became a metaphor for Vietnamese people and even Vietnamese culture. The term is now considered to be a derogatory slur for Vietnamese people. ==Portrayal in Hong Kong Media== ===Early portrayal=== The first recorded instance of the usage of \"B\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u t\u1eeb nay\" in Hong Kong entertainment programmes was during the 1980s, when it was used in a segment of the light entertainment show Enjoy Yourself Tonight. In the segment, a fight in the refugee camp was parodied, and two actors, using the stage names \"B\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u\" and \"T\u1eeb nay\", roughed up one of the audience (played by an actor) in the \"Legislative Council\" meeting who was well known for creating commotions during Legislative Council meetings.\u958b\u653e Issues 37\u201342 \u51b2\u5929\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8, 1990 \"\u300c\u5371\u57ce I \u5317\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62c9\u300d\u4e00.\u4f5c\u8005:\u5f35\u5fd7\u5f3a\u5728\u4e5d\u4e03\u524d\u9014\u8207\u8d8a\u5357\u8239\u6c11\u7b49\u554f\u984c\u56f0\u64fe\u4e0b,\u53d7\u9999\u6e2f\u524d\u9014\u6240\u5f71\u97ff,\u806f\u60f3\u9999\u6e2f\u6703\u5426\u5728\u56de\u6b78\u4e2d\u570b\u6642\u8b8a\u6210 8 \u4e00\u500b\u8d8a\u5357?\u5230\u6642\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u6210\u679c\u6703\u5426\u88ab\u50b2\u5e95\u7834\u58de?.\" ===1990s=== During the 1990s, some asylum seekers managed to use self-made tools to cut through the fence around the refugee camps and escaped. This incident was replayed on RTHK's news parody programme Headline News. In the video, the phrase was split into the following *B\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u? (\u4e0d\u6f0f?) (phonetically close to \"but lau\", which means \"leakless?\", a reference to the supposedly high security measures in the refugee camp) *t\u1eeb! (\u6d1e!) (phonetically close to \"dong\", which means \"hole!\", a reference to the holes that were cut and used as escape routes). *nay! (\u62c9!) (phonetically close to \"lai\", which means \"arrested!\", a reference to the eventual arrest of the escapees). ===2000s=== In the 2000s, Vietnamese cuisine became popular in Hong Kong, and the phrase, which had faded out of memory after the resolution of the refugee problem, resurfaced in an advertising campaign for a Vietnamese restaurant. ===2010s=== The phrase was used at least twice during the 2010s on books. *2010 travel book on Vietnam used the phrase in its title. *A Hong Kong \u00e9migr\u00e9e to Canada used the phrase in her 2017 book on Vietnamese boat people, titled b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u t\u1eeb nay: The Boat People Saga. ==See also== *Comprehensive Plan of Action *Vietnamese people in Hong Kong *Soramimi ==References== ==External links== *A recording of the actual \"B\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u t\u1eeb nay\" announcement that was broadcast on RTHK Category:Mass media in Hong Kong Category:History of Hong Kong Category:Vietnamese diaspora Category:Vietnamese refugees Category:Cantonese words and phrases ",
