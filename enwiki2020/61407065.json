Messmer founded the messmer foundation as a dedication to his daughter Petra, who died of cancer in 2003. The foundation is the institution behind the museum, which opened in June 2009. Every year, up to three exhibitions of classical modern art and contemporary art are presented. Exhibits from its own collection as well as loans from international private and museum collections are on display. In 1978 Messmer succeeded in acquiring large parts of the estate of the Swiss artist Andr\u00e9 Evard. Throughout his life he painted figuratively and abstractly and was regarded as a pioneering painter of Swiss Modernism. Through the artist, the entrepreneur found concrete-constructive art, which today forms the focus of his collection. The first exhibition of the kunsthalle messmer was a homage to Evard and showed only his works. In addition, the International Andr\u00e9 Evard Art Award, founded by Messmer, was named to honor the artist. == Exhibitions (selection) == In addition to the estate of Andr\u00e9 Evard, the Messmer art collection includes works by Max Bill, Georges Braque, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Otto Dix, G\u00fcnter Fruhtrunk, Fran\u00e7ois Morellet, A.
