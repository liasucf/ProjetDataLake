    "text": "The 1983 Alabama Crimson Tide football team (variously \"Alabama\", \"UA\", \"Bama\" or \"The Tide\") represented the University of Alabama in the 1983 NCAA Division I-A football season. It was the Crimson Tide's 91st overall and 50th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Ray Perkins, in his first year, and played their home games at both Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa and Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. They finished the season with a record of eight wins and four losses (8\u20134 overall, 4\u20132 in the SEC). Ray Perkins, who played as a wide receiver for Bear Bryant in the 1960s, was named as the new head coach at Alabama on December 14, 1982, to succeed Bryant after his 25-year tenure as Alabama's head coach. After opening the season with four consecutive wins and rising to #3 in the AP poll, The Tide suffered a controversial 34\u201328 loss to Penn State. Trailing 34-7 entering the 4th quarter, Alabama rallied and seemed to be an extra point away from victory after tight end Preston Gothard appeared to catch a game- tying touchdown pass with eight seconds left in the game. One official signaled a touchdown but was overruled by the back judge who ruled Gothard was out of bounds. Video replay indicated otherwise, however instant replay in college football was still decades away. Bama avenged the previous year's losses to LSU and Southern Miss but lost to Tennessee and Auburn again.1983 Game Recaps, Game Nos. 6, 8, 9, 11 The Crimson Tide completed their season with a 28\u20137 victory over SMU in the Sun Bowl.1983 Game Recaps, Game No. 12 ==Schedule== :Source: Rolltide.com All-time Football Results: 1983 Season ==References== General * Specific Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football seasons Alabama Crimson Tide Category:Sun Bowl champion seasons Crimson Tide ",
