ALMC Stages Rally event was taking place since 1984. Sligo Rally was admitted to the calendar instead, but rescheduled from 15 to 8 of July due to 'exceptional weather conditions' and fears that the heat will melt the road surface. However the heatwave persisted and this date was also cancelled. Eventually the rally took place on 2 September. Carlow Mini Stages Rally organized by Carlow Motor Club and held on 20 May was not a championship counting round. Best five rounds out of seven counted towards championship title. ==== Calendar ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" ! Round ! Dates ! Event ! Rally HQ !
