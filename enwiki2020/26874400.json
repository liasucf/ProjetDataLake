    "text": "Phineas Mendel Heilprin (November 1801 in Lublin, Poland \u2013 30 January 1863 in Washington, D.C., United States) was a Jewish scholar. He early settled in Piotrk\u00f3w and subsequently in Tomasz\u00f3w, where he became a manufacturer and merchant, but, in consequence of oppression by the Russian government, he removed in 1842 to Hungary. His sympathy was with the people in 1848, and after the failure of the revolutionary movement he determined to leave the country. In 1859 he came to the United States, where he remained until his death. He was a close student of the Talmud, and also of the Greek and later German philosophers, acquiring a high reputation among Jewish scholars as a conservative reformer. His works, written in Hebrew, include several controversial writings, dealing with the reform movement among the Jews. ==Family== His son Michael was actively involved in the revolutions of 1848 in Hungary and also emigrated to the United States. ==See also== * Heilprin ==References== * Category:1801 births Category:1863 deaths Category:People from Lublin Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Talmudists Category:Forty-Eighters ",
