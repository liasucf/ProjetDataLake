The cathedral is of brick construction in a modernist style with a prominent clock tower at the east end crowning the sanctuary. The foundation stone was laid in 1961 and the cathedral was consecrated on 14 October 1962. Prior to 1962, the diocese was based at St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, which was constructed in 1866 on the site of an earlier church. St Paul's, previously only a parish church, had been named a pro-cathedral in 1903 in preparation for Bunbury gaining diocesan status the following year. It was demolished in 1963.St Boniface Anglican Cathedral \u2013 Heritage Council of Western Australia.
