    "text": "Michael J. Collins (born 1 November 1940) is an Irish politician who served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Limerick West from 1997 to 2007. Until 2002 he was a member of Fianna F\u00e1il, and since then has been independent. ==Early life and career== Michael Collins was born in Abbeyfeale, County Limerick in 1940. He is the son of James Collins and a brother of Gerry Collins, both Fianna F\u00e1il members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Collins was involved in local politics for many years, serving as a councillor and chairman of the Limerick County Council. He was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1997 general election as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD and held his seat until retiring at the 2007 general election citing health reasons. His nephew, Niall Collins was elected to succeed him, maintaining the family's continuous occupation of a seat in that constituency since the 1948 general election. ==Tax evasion== Collins hit the headlines in 2003 when it was revealed that he had set up a bogus offshore account to evade paying tax. He settled the bill with the Revenue Commissioners, paying over \u20ac130,000 in taxes, interest and penalties. He also resigned from the Fianna F\u00e1il parliamentary party after it emerged he was on a list of tax defaulters. On 11 July 2006, Collins appeared in Rathkeale district court charged with two tax offences: cheating the Collector General and obtaining a tax clearance certificate by false pretences. He was remanded on bail until 28 September 2006 when he was due to appear at Limerick District Court. On 9 January 2007 the Court decided to adjourn the case until after the General Election. On 28 September 2007 after just under an hour of deliberation, a jury of seven men and five women returned its verdict. Collins was found guilty of obtaining a tax clearance certificate under false pretences. ===Response of Standards Commission=== Collins provided a Tax Clearance Certificate and a Statutory Declaration to the Standards Commission on 14 June 2002 as evidence of his compliance with the Tax Acts. When Collins name appeared in Iris Oifigi\u00fail the State gazette, as the holder of a bogus non-resident bank account, the Standards Commission sought legal advice and were advised that in the absence of a complaint, it did not have the legal authority to investigate Collins. The Commission advised the Minister for Finance of the limitations of the Ethics Acts which had been exposed through this matter. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Committee on Members' Interests of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann made a written complaint and the Committee determined that an investigation be carried out by the Commission on foot of this. The investigation commenced but has been suspended pending the outcome of the Garda investigation and legal proceedings. The Standards Commission is concerned at the length of time this matter has been under consideration and urges that it be resolved without delay. ==See also== *Families in the Oireachtas ==References== Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Independent TDs Category:Members of the 28th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 29th D\u00e1il Category:Local councillors in County Limerick Category:Irish people convicted of tax crimes ",
