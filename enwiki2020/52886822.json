    "text": "Sedasta is a genus of African orb-weaver spiders containing the single species, Sedasta ferox. It was first described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1894, [Volume dated 1892, this part published 1894.] and has only been found in West Africa. It was originally placed with the tangle-web spiders, and though was moved to the orb-weavers in 1985, it is still sometimes considered to be a theridiid or a long-jawed orb weaver. ==References== Category:Araneidae Category:Monotypic Araneomorphae genera Category:Spiders of Africa Category:Taxa named by Eug\u00e8ne Simon ",
