    "text": "\"I Show You Secrets\" is a 1994 song recorded by German Eurodance act Pharao, which consists of Indian/German singer Kyra Pharao and American rapper Deon Blue, ex Splash. It was released in 1994 as their debut single from the album, Pharao. The single hit success in many European countries, peaking within the Top 10 in Austria, Finland, Germany and Switzerland. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Pairing of lovely Indian singer Kyra Pharao and rapper Dean Thomas sparks with chemistry. She flutters over a frenetic pop/rave groove with an angelic quality, while Thomas' guttural rhymes are a fine anchor to the track's glossy synths.\" Cash Box noted, \"Utterly pretentious in its opening in a way that you can\u2019t help but love, this smash in Germany sounds like some kind of space-age L.S.D. trip through the cosmos. Going beyond techno, \"I Show You Secrets\" is a song that is at least interesting, and while everyone knows what that normally means, it\u2019s an accurate word for this song and it\u2019s not an insult. Pharao\u2019s five-song single tries something new.\" Music & Media commented that Pharao \"is already rapidly climbing the Media Control charts with an imposing housetrack with trancy overtones. This comes as no surprise really, as it easily holds its own against some of its more familiar competitors.\" John Kilgo from The Network Forty called it a \"superb dance number\". ==Chart performance== \"I Show You Secrets\" was successful on the charts in Europe, reaching the Top 10 in Austria, Finland, Germany and Switzerland. Additionally, it was a Top 20 hit in Sweden, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it peaked at number 18 in September 1994. In Belgium, the single went into the Top 40, while it peaked at number 85 on the UK Singles Chart in the UK, on November 6, 1994. Outside Europe, \"I Show You Secrets\" was a big hit in Israel, where it peaked at number 5. It also reached number 10 on the RPM Dance Chart in Canada.
