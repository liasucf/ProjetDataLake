They were formerly classified in the Old World warbler family Sylviidae or Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae but have recently been shown to belong to the vanga family Vangidae.Yamagishi, Satoshi; Honda, Masanao; Eguchi, Kazuhiro & Thorstrom, Russel (2001) \"Extreme endemic radiation of the Malagasy Vangas (Aves: Passeriformes)\" Journal of Molecular Evolution, 53: 39-46 They are endemic to Madagascar where they occur in forest or scrubland. They forage in pairs for insects, often joining mixed-species feeding flocks. They are small plump birds, about 12 centimetres in length. They have slender bills and usually have a pale eye. Their plumage is mainly grey or brown, paler on the underparts. They have loud, repeated songs. ==Species list== List of species in taxonomic order: * Northern dark newtonia, Newtonia amphichroa *Southern dark newtonia, Newtonia lavarambo (sometimes considered a subspecies of N. amphichroa) * Common newtonia, Newtonia brunneicauda * Archbold's newtonia, Newtonia archboldi * Red-tailed newtonia, Newtonia fanovanae ==References== * Sinclair, Ian & Langrand, Olivier (2003) Birds of the Indian Ocean Islands, Struik, Cape Town.
