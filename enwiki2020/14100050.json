    "text": "Greatest Hits is the first compilation album by English boy band Five. It was released in the United Kingdom through RCA Records on 19 November 2001, just three months after the release of their third studio album, Kingsize. \"Closer to Me\" and \"Rock the Party\" was released as double single on United Kingdom and Ireland. The album was executively produced by Simon Cowell and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. In other countries, the songs were released as separate singles. The songs was included in the previous album Kingsize (2001). The album features thirteen of the band's fifteen singles, excluding \"How Do Ya Feel\", and the international-only release \"Don't Fight It Baby\", as well as two popular B-sides, two brand new remixes, and the original track, \"Set Me Free\", which was recorded during the Kingsize album sessions. The album peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, as well as being certified platinum by the BPI. The album was executively produced by Simon Cowell and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. ==Background== Despite Kingsize only being released three months earlier, Greatest Hits was rush-released due to the imminent split of the band. Scott Robinson revealed on the ITV2 documentary The Big Reunion that the album's release came after Sean Conlon suffered a mental breakdown and threatened to quit the band as he was unable to cope. Alongside the release of the album, a VHS compilation containing all of the band's music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage, and the previously unreleased music video for \"Two Sides to Every Story\". The band's last ever British single, \"Closer to Me\", was used to promote the compilation in the United Kingdom, featuring footage from across the band's history. The Japanese version of the album does not include B-side \"Inspector Gadget\", but instead re-instates one of the missing singles, \"How Do Ya Feel\", and also includes a bonus remix of \"Let's Dance\" that does not appear on any other version of the release. The album was re-released on 7 June 2003. The album made a return to the top ten of UK Albums Chart in 2013, due to the band reforming to appear on The Big Reunion. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Abz Love \u2014 vocals *Jason \"J\" Brown \u2014 vocals *Sean Conlon \u2014 vocals *Ritchie Neville \u2014 vocals *Scott Robinson \u2014 vocals *Producers: Julian Gallagher, Richard Stannard, StarGate, Steve Mac, Ben Chapman *Mixing: Ash Howes, StarGate, Ben Chapman *Engineers: Ben Chapman, Matt Howe, Daniel Pursey, Robin Sellers, Ben Coombs *Programming: Ash Howes, Martin Harrington *Arrangers: Julian Gallagher, Richard Stannard, Dave Arch *Backing vocals: Andy Caine, Richard Stannard, Sharon Murphy, Eliot Kennedy, Tim Woodcock == Charts == === Weekly charts === {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2001) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |align=\"left\"|European Albums (European Top 100 Albums) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|48 |- |- |align=\"left\"|Irish Albums (IRMA) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |- |- |- |align=\"left\"|Scottish Albums Chart (OCC) |align=\"center\"|11 |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2001) !Peak position |- |} == Certifications and sales== ==References== Category:2001 greatest hits albums Category:Five (band) albums Category:RCA Records compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Richard Stannard ",
