She was born in M\u00e1laga, and lives and works in Granada. ==Biography== Mar\u00eda D\u00e1vila holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of M\u00e1laga and a PhD in Art History from the University of Granada. While still a student, she started to have solo exhibitions and to participate in group shows in major art centers in Andalusia. In 2014, she won the M\u00e1lagaCrea 2014 First prize and was preselected two years consecutively to the BMW paintings Awards in 2015 and 2016. ==Work== Her painting deals with the limits of the visible and the boundaries between fiction and reality. Based on a photographic or cinematographic material (family archives, still from movies or documentary films), Mar\u00eda D\u00e1vila explores, more specifically, some aspects of her main theme in different series: * \"Anagn\u00f3risis \u2013 La trama\" (2014) seeks to highlight the underlying similitudes between fiction and documentary films, with an emphasis on the interpretive nature of our relationship to reality. * \"Solsticio\" (2015) deals with our inability to recognize our image and the non-correspondence between memory and lived experience. The series is based on an album of family photographs. * \"Dramatis personae\" (2015) is about the act of looking and being looked at through a dialogue with cinematographic form based on narrative (de)construction such as Surrealist or Nouvelle Vague films. *\"Post scriptum\" is focused on the narrative construction in personal relationships, through a dialogue with cinema and theater.http://www.plataformadeartecontemporaneo.com/pac/testigos- privilegiados-maria-davila/ ==Solo exhibitions== * 2013: Despu\u00e9s, el silencio, Centro Cultural Provincial, M\u00e1laga * 2014: Anagn\u00f3risis - La trama, School of Fine Arts, M\u00e1laga * 2015: Dramatis personae, El Palmeral de las Sorpresas/Espacio Iniciarte, M\u00e1laga * 2017-2018: Post scriptum, Palacio de los Condes de Gabia, Granada ==Group exhibitions (selection)== * 2012: Stand Byes.
