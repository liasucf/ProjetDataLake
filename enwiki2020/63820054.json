    "text": "Lidia Hortencia Rangel \u00c1valos (born December 29, 1955) is a retired Mexican professional wrestler, more commonly known under the ring name Pantera Sure\u00f1a (Spanish for \"Southern Panther\"). She has also worked as the enmascarada (\"masked\") wrestling characters La Gal\u00e1ctica, La Gal\u00e1ctica 2000, Lady Discovery and Lady Metal during her career. Her career began in 1969 and stretched until 2008 where she worked her last match. As Pantera Sure\u00f1a, Rangel started her career as a luchadora enmascarada, but lost her mask to Lola Gonz\u00e1lez in 1977. Her stints as La Gal\u00e1ctica, La Gal\u00e1ctica 2000, Lady Discovery and Lady Metal were all under a mask and only confirmed to be Rangel later in her career. In her almost 40-year career she has won the Distrito Federal Women's Championship, the UWA World Women's Championship, and the Mexican National Women's Tag Team Championship with Martha Villalobos in Mexico, as well as the WWWA World Singles Championship in Japan. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre / Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre :*Distrito Federal Women's Championship (1 time) :*Mexican National Women's Tag Team Championship (1 time) with Martha Villalobos *Universal Wrestling Association :*UWA World Women's Championship (1 time) *All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling :*WWWA World Singles Championship (1 time) == Luchas de Apuestas record == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100% style=\"text-align: center\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Winner (wager) !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Loser (wager) !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Location !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20% scope=\"col\"|Event !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=15% scope=\"col\"|Date !class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=5% scope=\"col\"|Notes |- |Lola Gonz\u00e1lez (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (mask) || Pachuca, Hidalgo || N/A || 1977 || |- |Martha Villalobos (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || N/A || N/A || N/A || |- |Lady Apache (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || N/A || N/A || N/A || |- |Rossy Moreno (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || N/A || N/A || N/A || |- |Rossy Moreno (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || N/A || N/A || N/A || |- |Tania (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || N/A || N/A || N/A || |- |Estela Molina (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Naucalpan, State of Mexico || UWA show || || |- |Vicky Williams (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Naucalpan, State of Mexico || UWA show || || |- |Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Rossy Moreno (hair) || Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro || N/A || || |- |La Gal\u00e1ctica (mask) || Jaguar Yokota (hair) || Kawasaki, Japan || AJW show || || |- |Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Tania (hair) || Mexico City || CMLL show || || |- |Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Karla Ivonne (hair) || Mexico City || CMLL show || || ref |- |Lola Gonz\u00e1lez (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Mexico City || CMLL show || || |- |Zuleyma (hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a (hair) || Mexico City || CMLL show || || |- |Las Nasty Girls (Hair) || Pantera Sure\u00f1a and Wendy (hair) || Mexico City || N/A || || |- |Lady Discovery (mask) || Princesa Guerrera (mask) || N/A || AAA show || || |} ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican female professional wrestlers ",
