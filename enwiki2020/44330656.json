It was followed by Karma Currency, a 16-minute short film on the theme corruption. It was while he was working on Karma Currency that he realized that it was time he made his first feature concluding the Karma series. Karma Cartel is the last film in Karma series by Vinod Bharathan. Vinod constructed the plot structure inspired by the production styles of Pusher, Gang Tapes and Clerks. Armed with HDV camera, he headed to India to make his first feature. No one in India initially believed that his minimal and radical method of filmmaking was good enough to make a feature film. But his persistence gave the main actors little hope, and the project started rolling. But it was already too late as Vinod had only 10 days left to complete filming before he flew back to his family in Denmark for Christmas. Shooting as much as six scenes a day, Vinod juggled the ensemble of 25 actors using Microsoft Excel charts he had earlier prepared in anticipation. Dialogues for the scenes were often improvised in front of the rolling camera, and fewer times did they have the luxury to develop it an hour before the take. Vinod shot the entire scenes in long takes, and the longest single take with the indie filmmaker (Jinu Joseph) telling the story to the actor lasts 7 minutes, which was later taken out of the festival version edit as Vinod thought it would be hard for the foreign audience to follow. The film was shot with a two-member crew with Vinod behind the camera assisted by the sound recordist. Apart from the four cast members of Karma series, the rest of the cast were non-professionals or have never acted before. ===Filming=== Karma Cartel was shot mostly in Fort Cochin, and in parts of Ernakulam. The film was shot following Dogme 95 Manifesto rules 1,3,4,5,6 and 7. There were a lot of random location shifts due to the interference of the festivities of Kochi-Muziris Biennale and the New Year celebrations at Fort Cochin. Inspired by methods used by Anthony Dod Mantle on Festen, Vinod filmed Karma Cartel using Canon XH A1 HDV camera. Karma Cartel was filmed in 10 days. Karma Cartel follows 8 of the 10 rules of Dogme 95 manifesto. Music was later added as Vinod felt that the film lacked \"Indian feel\". Color was also graded as many felt it was too close to documentary when presented in the raw grading. Karma Cartel was filmed in Docu-fiction style to induce realism (arts) of presentation. Even though the film looks like a documentary, the entire plot was either previously scripted or improvised on location. Many of the scenes were shot in single takes because they were filming at noisy live locations, and sometimes only had a maximum of an hour at a given location. ===Themes=== The film uses a social, situational, commentary on the current state of the Indian film industry. It touches on impact of Facebook on film industry and how it has altered the influence of the film craze of the Indian people in general. Having spent a quarter of Vinod Bharathan's life in Scandinavia, he could not avoid the temptation of imitating the social realism widely used in their films, mostly because it looks real, authentic and easy. The three films that inspired Vinod most to create Karma Cartel the way it was made, are The Celebration (Festen) by Thomas Vinterberg, The Hate (La Haine) by Mathieu Kassovitz and Pusher by Nicolas Winding Refn. ==Music== London Based Radio Jocky Sharnita Athwal stepped in as music supervisor when Vinod Bharathan decided that Karma Cartel break a Dogme 95 rule and add pre-recorded music as the film did not have the \"indian Essence\" at the edit-lock phase of post productions. # Waves from inner space - Adi Sharma - Absys Records # Piya - Rita Morar remixed by Talal Qureshi # Rain - Rita Morar remixed by Steve 'Fingerz' Carty and Piyush Bhatnagar # Eternal - Nitesh Batra featuring Tritha # Polarity - Adi Sharma # Soul - Nitesh Batra Featuring Tritha # To Free Self - Adi Sharma # Unexpected - Adi Sharma # Scream - Juttla # additional Soundtracks - Michael A.J. ==Reception== Karma Cartel premiered at the 2011 International Film Festival Ahmedabad, and also showed at Cochin Film Society at Kochi and later traveled to film festivals in Canada, America and Italy, where it won Award of Excellence in filmmaking at Canada International Film Festival 2014, and Best First Time Director Award at American Movie Awards, Nevada, 2014. The Director Vinod Bharathan won the Best Director Award at CinemaVvenire Film Festival, Rome 2014. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 films Category:Dogme 95 films Category:Indian films Category:Malayalam-language films Category:Indian avant-garde and experimental films Category:Indian independent films Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:2010s avant-garde and experimental films ",
