It includes a tripoint where the Italian regions of Lazio, Abruzzo and Molise meet; concerned comuni are Alfedena (AQ), Picinisco (FR) and Pizzone (IS).Carta 1:25.00, Istituto Geografico Militare (on-line:www.pcn.minambiente.it) The tripoint is located on its western sub-summit, at 2185 m, which is also the highest point of Molise. == Toponymy == More than Monte Meta (masculine) the mountain is usually called in the spoken language la Meta (feminine); it gives the name to the Monti della Meta, an Apennine sub-range. == Access to the summit == La Meta covered with snow (march) Due to an important population of Rupicapra pyrenaica ssp. ornata living on the mountain, the access to the area is strictly regulated in order to reduce disturbance. A single footpath (named L1) is accessible to hikers during the summer. Also the days of the week for hikes and the number of hikers admitted per day are fixed, and a previous authorization must be requested to the natural park administration. ==See also== * List of Italian regions by highest point ==Notes== ==External links== * * Category:Mountains of Molise Category:Mountains of Lazio Category:Mountains of Abruzzo Category:Highest points of Italian regions Category:Two-thousanders of Italy Category:Mountains of the Apennines ",
