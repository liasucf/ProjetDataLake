He theorizes about the nature of the unconscious mind and its separation from human language. The unconscious, according to McCarthy, \"is a machine for operating an animal\" and that \"all animals have an unconscious.\" McCarthy goes on to postulate that language is purely a human cultural creation, and not a biologically determined phenomenon. ==Reception== The article was praised by Nick Romeo of The New Yorker. ==References== ==External links== Full text Category:2017 essays Category:Works by Cormac McCarthy ",
