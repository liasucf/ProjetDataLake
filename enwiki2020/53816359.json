    "text": "The South-Central Synod of Wisconsin is one of the 65 synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. Not to be confused with other Lutheran bodies, in which the national expression is called a synod, in the ELCA, a synod is most similar to a diocese or conference in other mainline denominations. The synod claims about 100,000 baptized members and 140+ congregations in south-western and south-central Wisconsin. The current bishop is The Rev. Peter Rogness who was appointed to serve as Interim Bishop beginning September 26, 2019 following the resignation of The Rev. Viviane Thomas-Breitfeld. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America synods Category:Lutheranism in Wisconsin Category:Lutheranism stubs ",
