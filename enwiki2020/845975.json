CPI (ML) Liberation is a political party that was reorganised in Bihar during the Bhojpur Movement after the death of Charu Majumdar and disintegration of the CPI(ML).It has presence in several states of the country namely Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, West Bengal, Delhi, Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka , Assam and Tamil Nadu where it operates through various mass organisations (workers, farmers, women, youth, student unions). == History == In 1973 the original Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) CPI (ML) was split, with one group led by Sharma and another by Mahadev Mukherjee. Vinod Mishra initially belonged to Mukherjee's party, but he and the Burdwan Regional Committee broke with Mukherjee in September 1973. Mishra sought contact with the Sharma group, but the Burdwan Regional Committee was later divided and Mishra denounced the political line of Sharma (a critique, which amongst other things, called for the formation of open mass organizations, a move that almost constituted a heresy in the CPI (ML) movement at the time).Sen, Arindam. The Life of Vinod Mishra In 1974 Mishra came into contact with Subrata Dutta (Jauhar), a leader of armed struggle in the plain areas of Bihar. On 28 July 1974 (the second death anniversary of Charu Majumdar) a new party Central Committee was formed with Jauhar as General Secretary and Mishra and Swadesh Bhattacharya (Raghu) as members. The reorganized party became known as the 'anti-Lin Biao' group (whilst the faction of Mahadev Mukherjee constituted the 'pro-Lin Biao' group). The anti- Lin Biao group became known as the CPI (ML) Liberation.Frontline. The road from Naxalbari . Volume 22 - Issue 21, 8\u201321 October 2005 Mishra served as West Bengal secretary of the new party organization. Under Mishra's leadership new dalams (guerilla squads) were formed. In November 1975 Jauhar was killed in the midst of Lal Sena activities. Mishra became the new party General Secretary in a reorganized five-member Central Committee. Mishra organized a second party congress, held clandestinely in the rural areas of Gaya district in February 1976. The congress unanimously re-elected Mishra as General Secretary. === Reorientation and rectification === Mishra was the political architect of the process of re-orientation of CPI (ML) Liberation. By 1976 the party had adopted a position that armed struggle would be combined with building a broad anti-Congress democratic front movement. The process further elaborated through an internal rectification process initiated in late 1977. Party study circles and party schools were started from central to block level of the party structure. The theory of two line tactics started to develop. In 1981 party tried to unify the other splintered ML factions. The party organised a unity meet with 13 ML factions to form a unified leading core . But the initiative was a failure. ==== The IPF ==== In the early 1980s CPI (ML) Liberation began building an open non-party mass movement (in direct to the original policy of CPI (ML)), the Indian People's Front (founded in April 1982). Nagbhushan Patnaik became the president of IPF. The construction of IPF, through which the underground party could develop links to other democratic forces on the basis of a popular, democratic and patriotic programme, was based on interventions by Mishra. However although Mishra broke with the dogmas of the early CPI (ML), he never renounced Charu Majumdar's legacy.Karat, Prakash. Naxalism Today; At an Ideological . The Marxist, Volume: 3, No. 1, January\u2013March 1985 In the third party congress it was decided that IPF will participate in parliamentary elections. In 1989 IPF's Rameshwar Prasad won the loksabha seat from Ara (Bhojpur). In 1990, IPF won 7 seats from Bihar Legislative Assembly. Special initiatives taken for restructuring the party and open up. IPF hold its first rally on 8 October 1990 in Delhi. ==== The ASDC ==== In 1985, the party launched People's democratic Front (PDF) in Karbi Anglong district of Assam which won a seat in state assembly. In 1987 PDF was transformed to Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC). A sustained mass movement by ASDC help it to sweep district council elections in 1989. In 1981, ASDC's Jayanta Rongpi became an MP in Parliament. In 1996, ASDC was able to send its five-member group in Assam assembly as MLA. In 1992, after the Fifth party congress (Held in Kolkata), the party comes out in the open from its underground status. Mishra was re- elected General Secretary of the party at the sixth congress of CPI (ML) Liberation in Varanasi in October 1997. == Present == The Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) Liberation, led by Dipankar Bhattacharya is a surviving faction of the CPI (M-L).Liberation has established legal overground structures (trade unions, student groups, peasant organisations etc.) and participates in elections. In the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 the party won 0.3% of the votes and one seat (the former ASDC-seat from Assam). In the 2004 elections the seat was lost, mainly due to a split within ASDC. As of 2016, the party has been able to send its representatives to the state legislative assemblies of Bihar and Jharkhand as well as the panchayats of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Punjab. == Publications == The English-language publication of the party is Liberation, and thus the party is called CPI (ML) Liberation. Apart from Liberation, the party publishes a central Hindi weekly organ, Samkaleen Lokyuddh. Some state party committees publish their own organs, like the weekly Ajker Deshabrati in West Bengal, Nabasphulinga in Tripura, Teeppori in Tamil Nadu, Telugu Liberation in Andhra Pradesh, Kannada Liberation in Karnataka, Samkali Lok Morcha in Punjab, etc. ==Mass organizations== The main mass organizations of the party are: *Revolutionary Youth Association (RYA) *All India Students Association (AISA) *All India Agricultural Labour Association (AIALA) *All India Peasants' Coordination Committee *All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) *All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA) *Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC) *All India Construction Workers Federation (AICWF) == States == === Bihar === 260x260px The party has a longstanding conflict with the feudal landlords since the beginning of CPI (ML).
