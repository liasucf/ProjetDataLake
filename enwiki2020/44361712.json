The original team consisted of footballers which have played for clubs from the upper tiers of Hungarian football league system, prior to the Second World War. Givat Haim did not play league games until 1949, when they joined Liga Meuhedet, the temporary second division of Israeli football in the 1949\u201350 season, the first after Israeli independence. Although the club was folded one year later, after most of its players left for new settlements, it was reformed in 1954 and joined Liga Gimel, then the fourth tier, in the 1955\u201356 season.Liga Gimel in football starts Al Hamishmar, 25.11.1955, Historical Jewish Press In their first season in Liga Gimel, Givat Haim won the Samaria division and qualified for the promotion play-offs against Hapoel clubs from Tiberias, Kfar Ata, Safed and Zikhron Ya'akov. Despite a victory of 6\u20132 against Hapoel Tiberias, Givat Haim failed to achieve promotion, and remained in Liga Gimel until the 1958\u201359 season, when they won the Samaria division and were promoted to Liga Bet. In the 1962\u201363 season, Givat Haim finished third in Liga Bet North B division and were promoted to Liga Alef, then the second tier. In the following season, the club finished bottom of Liga Alef North division and dropped back to Liga Bet. During the season, the club suffered a heavy defeat of 2\u201312 at the hands of the league winners, Maccabi Netanya, which broke their goal-scoring record at that match.63\u201364 Season Football Club Maccabi Netanya In the next seasons, Givat Haim was one of the top contenders in Liga Bet North B division. However, they had to wait until the end of the 1971\u201372 season, when they faced Hapoel Ra'anana in the last match of the season. Givat Haim turned a deficit of 0\u20132 into victory of 3\u20132 and were promoted to Liga Alef instead of their opponents, thanks to a better goal difference.In checkered battle Givat Haim won promotion to Liga Alef Davar, 12.6.1972, Historical Jewish Press In the following season, the club finished once more at the bottom of Liga Alef North division and relegated to Liga Bet. In the 1975\u201376 season, the club finished second bottom in Liga Bet North B division and suffered another relegation, this time to Liga Gimel, which became the fifth tier, following the creation of Liga Artzit. Givat Haim made an immediate return to Liga Bet at the end of the 1976\u201377 season,Hapoel association Davar, 12.6.1977, Historical Jewish Press and were promoted to Liga Alef (now as the third tier), after finished runners-up in Liga Bet North B division at the 1977\u201378 season. Thus, the club achieved two successive promotions. However, the yo-yo pattern continued, as the club finished the 1978\u201379 season at the bottom place of Liga Alef North division and dropped back to Liga Bet. Prior to the 1981\u201382 season, the club was renamed Hapoel Emek Hefer, representing the Hefer Valley Regional Council, where Givat Haim is located, rather than the Kibbutz. As Hapoel Emek Hefer, the club mostly battled against relegation, and were eventually relegated to Liga Gimel after finished bottom of the North B division in the 1984\u201385 season. Hapoel Emek Hefer folded at the end of the 1986\u201387 season. Currently, teams from Givat Haim are playing at the Hefer Valley regional leagues, which were not affiliated with the Israel Football Association.Regional leagues \u2013 Football Hefer Valley Regional Council ==Honours== ===League=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !scope=col|Honour !scope=col|No. !scope=col|Years |- !scope=row|Third tier |1 |1971\u201372 |- !scope=row|Fourth tier |2 |1955\u201356, 1958\u201359 |- !scope=row|Fifth tier |1 |1976\u201377 |} ==References== *Not to amaze eyes but to score goal (Page 2) Hadshot HaSport, 3.7.1963, archive.football.co.il Givat Haim Category:Association football clubs established in 1946 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1987 Givat Haim Category:1946 establishments in Mandatory Palestine Category:1987 disestablishments in Israel ",
