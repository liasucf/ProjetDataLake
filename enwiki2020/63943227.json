    "text": "\"Together\" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Sia from the motion picture soundtrack of upcoming musical film Music, co-written and directed by herself. It was released on May 20, 2020, through Atlantic Records. The song is the lead single from the soundtrack, which will be released in 2020 and her upcoming seventh studio album, Reasonable Woman, which is expected to be released in 2021. == Background == Song co-writer and producer alt= The song was first mentioned by Sia in a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, where it was described as a \"cheerful song that matches [Sia's] personality much more than, say, 'Chandelier'.\" It is likely to be the ending of the musical film Music, which was written and directed by Sia herself. Although Music was not a musical originally, Sia told Rolling Stone that she would be given \"roughly $10 million more\" to make it a musical film. Music is set for a release in September 2020. On May 11, 2020, \"Together\" was made available for pre-save on Spotify and Apple Music through wecantakeithigher.com. Sia announced the release of the single through her social media accounts on May 13. The song was written by Sia and American record producer Jack Antonoff and produced by Antonoff, with additional production by Sia's frequent collaborator, Jesse Shatkin. ==Release and music video== The music video to the song was released on May 20, alongside the single. The video stars Music's three principal cast members, Maddie Ziegler, Kate Hudson and Leslie Odom Jr, along with a troupe of dancing children, wearing outfits themed after clouds and rainbows. The one-take visual sees Ziegler leading a high-energy dance around a technicolor room, dressed as a praying emoji and Hudson as a peace hand emoji. \"Together\" was released to adult contemporary radio in the US on June 29, 2020. == Track listing == Digital download and streaming # \"Together\" \u2013 3:25 Digital download and streaming (F9 Remixes) # \"Together\" (F9 Radio Remix) \u2013 3:20 # \"Together\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Together\" (F9 Club Remix) \u2013 7:49 == Credits and personnel == Chris Gehringer served as the track's mastering engineer.
