It is an afromontane species, restricted to the mountains of northeastern Africa. == Phylogeny == The phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. Hedbergia decurva groups with Hedbergia longiflora and Hedbergia abyssinica into a Hedbergia clade nested within the core Rhinantheae. These three taxa share evolutionary affinities with genera Tozzia, Bellardia, Neobartsia, Parentucellia, and Odontites. == References == decurva Category:Species described in 1846 ",
