    "text": "Dale Aycock is an American author of science fiction. Aycock was born on August 1, 1935 in San Joaquin Valley, California. Her first two science fiction novels were Stardrifter and Starspinner, both space operas. Aycock is a member of the South Bay Branch of the California Writers Club and the World Future Society. She lives in Los Gatos, California. == Notable works == === Stardrifter === Stardrifter, also referred to as Star Drifter, is a 1981 novel in which the owner of a interstellar trading company gets caught up in a conspiracy to rule the galaxy. Greg Costikyan reviewed Stardrifter in Ares Magazine #10 and commented that \"The importance is not the plot, which is typical space opera, but Aycock's ability to flesh out characters despite slam-bang action and to turn a pretty phrase or two. Star Drifter is fun reading.\" The book also received reviews from Voice of Youth Advocates and Gene DeWeese of Science Fiction Review. === Starspinner === Starspinner is a 1981 novel in which space pilot Christopher Marlowe must stop his enemy from becoming dictator of Earth. Greg Costikyan reviewed Starspinner in Ares Magazine #11 and commented that \"Aycock's relentlessly fast-paces plot does not allow much time for character development or for depiction of the society in which the characters function. Nevertheless, the human conflict is dealt with in sufficient detail to prevent total loss of interest in the characters. Starspinner is an above-average science fiction novel; Aycock is a writer to watch.\" The book was also reviewed in Voice of Youth Advocates'. == Bibliography == * Stardrifter (1981) * Starspinner (1981) * Starspinner II: Last Man Standing (2007) * Star's End (2015) * Dark Minds (2016) * Firewing (2019) == References == == External links == *Dale Aycock at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:American science fiction writers Category:Women science fiction and fantasy writers ",
