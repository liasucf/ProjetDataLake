    "text": "The Pal\u00f3c are a subgroup of Hungarians in Northern Hungary and southern Slovakia. While the Pal\u00f3c have retained distinctive traditions, including a very apparent dialect of Hungarian, the Pal\u00f3c are also ethnic Hungarians by general consensus. Although their origins are unclear, the Pal\u00f3c seem to have some sort of connections with the Khazar, Kabar, Pechenegs and Cuman tribes. The writings of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Miksz\u00e1th gave new prominence to the people in 1882 with his work The Good People of Pal\u00f3c. The Pal\u00f3c village of Holl\u00f3k\u0151 was proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. ==Etymology== The Cumans were called Polovtsy in Slav sources. The Pal\u00f3c word originates from the Slavic Polovets.Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, The Role of Migration in the History of the Eurasian Steppe: Sedentary Civilization vs. 'Barbarian' and Nomad, Palgrave Macmillan, 2000, p. 247 Although similar to the Hungarians in origins and culture, they were considered distinct groups by the Turks. The first written record of the word \"pal\u00f3c\" as the name of a people appears in the Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd register in 1784. ==See also== * Sz\u00e9kelys * Maty\u00f3 * Csangos * Jasz people * Iazyges * Z\u00e1h (gens) * Amadeus Aba ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Hungary ",
