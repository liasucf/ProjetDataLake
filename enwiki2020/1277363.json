    "text": "In mathematics, a branched surface is a generalization of both surfaces and train tracks. ==Definition== A surface is a space that looks topologically (i.e., up to homeomorphism) like \u211d\u00b2. Consider, however, the space obtained by taking the quotient of two copies A,B of \u211d\u00b2 under the identification of a closed half-space of each with a closed half-space of the other. This will be a surface except along a single line. Now, pick another copy C of \u211d and glue it and A together along halfspaces so that the singular line of this gluing is transverse in A to the previous singular line. Call this complicated space K. A branched surface is a space that is locally modeled on K.Li, Tao. \"Laminar Branched Surfaces in 3-manifolds.\" Geometry and Topology 6.153 (2002): 194. ==Weight== A branched manifold can have a weight assigned to various of its subspaces; if this is done, the space is often called a weighted branched manifold.Shields, Sandra. \"The stability of foliations of orientable 3-manifolds covered by a product.\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 348.11 (1996): 4653-4671. Weights are non-negative real numbers and are assigned to subspaces N that satisfy the following: *N is open. *N does not include any points whose only neighborhoods are the quotient space described above. *N is maximal with respect to the above two conditions. That is, N is a component of the branched surface minus its branching set. Weights are assigned so that if a component branches into two other components, then the sum of the weights of the two unidentified halfplanes of that neighborhood is the weight of the identified halfplane. ==See also== *Branched covering *Branched manifold ==References== Category:Geometric topology Category:3-manifolds Category:Generalized manifolds ",
