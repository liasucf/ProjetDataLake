    "text": "Gallions Reach DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in the Docklands area of east London. It serves the Gallions Reach Retail Park. The station is located on the DLR's Beckton branch, between Cyprus and Beckton stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 3. The platforms have not been extended to accommodate 3-car trains, and although metal catwalks have been installed, these are far too narrow for normal passenger use and Selective Door Operation is used instead. The crossover east of the station which is usually used for trains from the west going to Beckton DLR depot, can also be used for trains from Beckton and Poplar to reverse. This is the easternmost station on the DLR (Beckton is actually further west). ==Future== It is proposed that an extension to Dagenham Dock will diverge from the line east of Gallions Reach if ever built. In 2009 London Mayor Boris Johnson announced a consultation into the possibility of a ferry service at Gallions Reach, linking Beckton with Thamesmead in south east London. However it is now to be a road bridge with either a tram or DLR beside it. This extension is planned to serve a new station at Thamesmead, then Abbey Wood and possibly be brought back around to serve Woolwich Arsenal. The East London Transit has been suggested to be extended here linking Barking Reach and Creekmouth and Barking. In 2016 London mayor Sadiq Khan announced plans for an extension of the DLR from Gallions Reach to Thamesmead (see diagram). Mayor commits to building greener, public transport-focused crossings 4 Oct 2016 ==Connections== London Buses routes 101, 262, 366, 376, 474 and 678 and night route N551 serve the station. ==See also== * Gallions railway station * Manor Way railway station ==References== ==External links== * Docklands Light Railway website - Gallions Reach station page Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1994 Category:Beckton ",
