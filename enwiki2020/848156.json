Forster, and Italian Hours (1909) by Henry James.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/travel/30Florence.html Since the 14th century the city has always been considered a getaway for the upper class of Florence and up to this day Fiesole remains noted for its very expensive residential properties.

The first recorded mention of the town dates to 283 BC, when the town, then known as Faesulae, was conquered by the Romans. In antiquity it was the seat of a famous school of augurs, and every year twelve young men were sent thither from Rome to study the art of divination. Sulla colonized it with veterans, who afterwards, under the leadership of Gaius Mallius, supported the cause of Catilina.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor.Gaius Mallius was a colonist of Fiesole who, according to Sallust (Bellum Catilinae 24.2), was the first to raise an army and take the field against Rome. His nomen is often confused with the more common Manlius. Fiesole was the scene of Stilicho's great victory over the Germanic hordes of the Vandals and Suebi under Radagaisus in 406.Radagaisus was executed 23 August 406 (Herwig Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., History of the Goths, 1988:169); Paulinus of Nola attributed the victory of Stilicho over Radagaisus's Ostrogoths near Fiesole, to the protection of Felix, Peter, Paul and other saints. During the Gothic War (536\u2013553) the town was several times besieged. In 539 Justin, the Byzantine general, captured it and razed its fortifications. A 14th-century depiction from the Nuova Cronica showing the sacking of Fiesole in 1010 It was an independent town for several centuries in the early Middle Ages, no less powerful than Florence in the valley below, and many wars arose between them; in 1010 and 1025 Fiesole was sacked by the Florentines, before it was conquered by Florence in 1125, and its leading families obliged to take up their residence in Florence. Dante reflects this rivalry in his Divine Comedy by referring to \"the beasts of Fiesole.\" (Inferno XV.73).Dante in Love, A.N. Wilson, p. 71 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux: 2011) By the 14th century, rich Florentines had countryside villas in Fiesole, and one of them is the setting of the frame narrative of the Decameron.
