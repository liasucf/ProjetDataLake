Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon R. England watching the progress of an SM-3 anti-ballistic missile in 2008 On June 8, 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recommended Cartwright to be the next Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to replace retiring Admiral Edmund Giambastiani; President George W. Bush formally announced the nomination, with that of Admiral Michael Mullen to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on June 28, 2007. Senator John Warner of Virginia, the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated, \"General Cartwright has an extraordinary grasp and understanding of the global posture that America must maintain in this era of new and ever-changing threats\". Cartwright's nomination was confirmed by the full Senate on August 3, 2007. Due to the retirement of Admiral Giambastiani on July 27, 2007, Cartwright assumed the position immediately upon confirmation. He was sworn in on August 31, 2007, as the 8th Vice Chairman. On March 18, 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that Cartwright had been nominated for a second term as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He was confirmed by the Senate on July 31, 2009.U.S. Senate Legislation & Records Home Nominations Confirmed (Non-Civilian) The military investigated Cartwright in 2009 and 2010 for possible misconduct involving a female Marine captain, and investigators recommended administrative action for \"failure to discipline a subordinate\" and \"fostering an unduly familiar relationship\". Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, however, reviewed the evidence and found it insufficient to warrant corrective action for even the lesser offenses. He stated, \"I do not agree with the conclusion that General Cartwright maintained an 'unduly familiar relationship' with his aide. Nor do I agree that General Cartwright's execution of his leadership responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis his aide or any other member of his staff was inconsistent with the leadership requirements\". \"[Q]uestions about how he oversaw his staff\", however, were mentioned as a reason Cartwright had fallen out as favored candidate of President Obama for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2011. Army chief Gen. Martin Dempsey was named to the post. \"Some Republicans [had] ... quietly criticized Gen. Cartwright, calling him 'Obama's general,'\" one report at the time also said.Entous, Adam, \"Top Officer in Army to Lead Joint Chiefs\", The Wall Street Journal, May 31, 2011. Retrieved May 31, 2011. Cartwright held his retirement ceremony on August 3, 2011. During the ceremony, Deputy Secretary of Defense William J.

Federal investigators reportedly suspected that Cartwright leaked details of the operation to a New York Times reporter.Ellen Nakashima & Adam Goldman, Leak investigation stalls amid fears of confirming U.S.-Israel operation, Washington Post (March 10, 2015). In March 2015, the Washington Post reported that the sensitive leak investigation, led by Rod J. Rosenstein, had \"stalled amid concerns that a prosecution in federal court could force the government to confirm\" information about the highly classified program. U.S. officials feared that if classified information were revealed in any information, it would harm U.S.-Israeli relations and would also complicate the then-pending negotiations on an agreement with Iran over the nuclear program. It was reported that federal prosecutors had discussions with the Office of White House Counsel, then led by Kathryn Ruemmler, on whether certain material important to the case would be declassified, and Ruemmler conveyed that the government was unwilling to provide the documentation. Cartwright denied any wrongdoing; his attorney, Gregory B. Craig, said in March 2015 that Cartwright had no contact with federal investigators for over a year. Craig stated: \"General Cartwright has done nothing wrong. He has devoted his entire life to defending the United States. He would never do anything to weaken our national defense or undermine our national security. Hoss Cartwright is a national treasure, a genuine hero and a great patriot.\" On November 2, 2012, in an interview with the FBI, Cartwright denied he was the source of the leaks. On October 17, 2016, Cartwright entered a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on a charge of making false statements during the leak investigation, a felony. Outgoing President Barack Obama pardoned Cartwright on January 17, 2017, two weeks prior to his scheduled sentencing hearing. ==Post-retirement work== Cartwright was the inaugural holder of the Harold Brown Chair in Defense Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank - a post he held from 2011 until 2017.https://www.csis.org/programs/international-security- program/harold-brown-chair In addition, Cartwright serves as a member of board of directors of The Raytheon Company, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, and as a defense consultant for ABC News. Cartwright is an advisor for several corporate entities involved in global management consulting, technology services and program solutions. predictive and big data analytics. and advanced systems engineering, integration, and decision-support services. He serves as an advisor to the board of directors for Accenture, Enlightenment Capital, IxReveal, Logos Technologies, Opera Solutions, and TASC Inc. He is also affiliated with a number of professional organizations, including the Aspen Strategy Group, The Atlantic Council, Nuclear Threat Initiative, and The Sanya Initiative. Cartwright is also a leading advocate for the phased and verified elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide (\"Global Zero (campaign)\"). In October 2011, he spoke at the Global Zero Summit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, and currently serves as Chair of the Global Zero U.S. Nuclear Policy Commission, which in May 2012 released its report, \"Modernizing U.S. Nuclear Force Structure and Policy,\" calling for the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals 80% to 900 total weapons each, which would pave the way to bringing other nuclear weapons countries into the first-in-history multilateral nuclear arms negotiations. In June 2015, Cartwright was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then- pending negotiations for an agreement between Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program.William J. Broad, Iran Accord's Complexity Shows Impact of Bipartisan Letter, The New York Times (14 July 2015).Public Statement on U.S. Policy Toward the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Endorsed by a Bipartisan Group of American Diplomats, Legislators, Policymakers, and Experts, Washington Institute for Near East Policy (24 June 2015). That letter outlined concerns about several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win the letter-writers' support for it. The final agreement, concluded in July 2015, shows the influence of the letter. Cartwright endorsed the final agreement in August 2015, becoming one of 36 retired generals and admirals to sign an open letter in support of the agreement.[Read: An open letter from retired generals and admirals on the Iran nuclear deal], Washington Post (August 2015). ;Government civilian positions * 2011\u20132013: Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee Member * 2014: National Defense Panel, United States Institute of PeaceReview of 2014 QDR ==See also== * List of United States Marine Corps four-star generals * List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States ==References== ==External links== * Joint Chiefs of Staff * U.S. Strategic Command * Involvement with \"Olympic Games\" aka Stuxnet * * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Joint Chiefs of Staff Category:Vice Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Category:People from Rockford, Illinois Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:Iowa Hawkeyes men's swimmers Category:Naval War College alumni Category:United States Marine Corps generals Category:United States Naval Aviators Category:United States Naval Flight Officers Category:Recipients of American presidential pardons Category:Recipients of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army) Category:Recipients of the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit ",
