Situated in the South Morava basin, it is located in the geographical area known as Pre\u0161evo Valley. It is also known for its source of mineral water and spa town Bujanova\u010dka banja. According to the 2011 census, due to the boycott of Albanians. the largest ethnic group in the town were Serbs, while the largest ethnic group in the municipality were Albanians. ==History== ===Ancient history=== Kale-Kr\u0161evica, located south of Ristovac, is an archaeological site of a 5th-century BC Ancient city of Macedon, thought to be Damastion. The Thracian Triballi and Paeonian Agrianes dwelled in the region, with the Scordisci settling here after the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC. The region was conquered by the Romans after 75 BC. It became part of the Roman propraetorial province Moesia in 29 BC (imperial from 27 BC). In 87 AD the region was re-organized into the Moesia Superior, which was a province of the Roman Empire. ===Medieval Serbian era=== Medieval Serbian state like the Kingdom of Serbia or the Serbian Empire included part of this region in the 12th century and most of it until the 14th century. Since the 15th century, the region was under Ottoman administration. ===Ottoman era=== It became part of Rumelia, as a historical term describing the area now referred to as the Balkans or the Balkan Peninsula when it was administrated by the Ottoman Empire. After the Berlin agreement, signed in 1878, there were some administrative changes in the Ottoman Empire. Bujanovac and its surroundings became part of the \"Pre\u0161evo area\" of the Pri\u0161tina District and in 1905\u20131912 Bujanovac belonged to the 2nd category of borough covering 28 villages. After the Balkan Wars, the area belonged to Kumanovo District of the Kingdom of Serbia. ===Yugoslavia (1918\u201392)=== After the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians, in 1918, Bujanovac became part of Vranje Oblast, which was formed in 1921 after the Vidovdan Constitution. With administrative changes in 1929, it became part of Vardar Banovina, with the town of Skopje as capital. With the forming of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, it was part of Socialist Republic of Serbia from 1943 to 1992. After World War II, in 1947, Bujanovac was established as one of 117 municipalities of Central Serbia, under its own name. From 1945 until 1992 Bujanovac was part of Socialist Republic of Serbia, within SFR Yugoslavia. ===Breakup of Yugoslavia (1991\u201399)=== Sites near Bujanovac where NATO aviation used munition with depleted uranium during 1999 bombing In 1992, the Albanians in the area organized a referendum in which they voted that Bujanovac, Pre\u0161evo and Medve\u0111a should join the self-declared assembly of the Republic of Kosova. However, no major events happened until the end of the 1990s. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, and nearby Kosovo War which lasted until 1999, between 1999 and 2001, an ethnic Albanian paramilitary separatist organization, the U\u00c7PMB, raised an armed insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley, in the region mostly inhabited by Albanians, with a goal to occupy these three municipalities from Serbia and join them to the self- proclaimed Republic of Kosova. Unlike in the case of Kosovo, western countries condemned the attacks and described it as the \"extremism\" and use of \"illegal terrorist actions\" by the group. Following the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the new Yugoslav government suppressed the violence by 2001 and defeated the separatists. NATO troops also helped the Yugoslav government by ensuring that the rebels do not import the conflicts back into Kosovo. Thereafter, the situation has stabilized even though large number of forces exist in this small municipality. In 2009, Serbia opened a military base Cepotina five kilometers south of Bujanovac, to further stabilize the area. ===Modern=== Today, Bujanovac is located in the P\u010dinja District of southern Serbia. On 7 March 2017, the President of Albania Bujar Nishani made a historical visit to the municipalities of Bujanovac and Pre\u0161evo, in which Albanians form the ethnic majority. ==Settlements== Aside from the town of Bujanovac, the municipality includes the following settlements: * Baraljevac * Bilja\u010da * Bogdanovac * Bo\u017einjevac * Borovac * Bratoselce * Breznica * Brnjare * Bu\u0161tranje * \u010car * Dobrosin * Donje Novo Selo * Dre\u017enica * \u0110or\u0111evac * Gramada * Gornje Novo Selo * Jablanica * Jastrebac * Karadnik * Klenike * Klinovac * Kon\u010dulj * Ko\u0161arno * Kr\u0161evica * Ku\u0161tica * Letovica * Levosoje * Lopardince * Lu\u010dane * Lukarce * Ljiljance * Mali Trnovac * Muhovac * Negovac * Nesalce * Oslare * Pretina * Pribovce * Rakovac * Ravno Bu\u010dje * Rusce * Samoljica * Sebrat * Sejace * Span\u010devac * Srpska Ku\u0107a * Sveta Petka * Starac * Suharno * Trejak * Turija * Uzovo * Veliki Trnovac * Vogance * Vrban * Zarbince * \u017dbevac * \u017du\u017eeljica ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the municipality of Bujanovac had a population of 43,302 people.
