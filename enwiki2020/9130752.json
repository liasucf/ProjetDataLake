    "text": "1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group Headquarters and Signal Squadron is a Regular Force Army unit of the Canadian Armed Forces at CFB Edmonton. The Squadron is part of 3rd Canadian Division's 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG). == History == 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group Headquarters and Signal Squadron traces its heritage back to the formation of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals on 24 Oct 1903. Before the end of the Second World War, small signal sections provided tactical communications for the Canadian Army's various Brigade Headquarters. After World War II, Brigade communication requirements expanded significantly, and it became necessary for the Army to expand these sections into Squadrons. In 1958, as part of the Army reorganization the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade Group relocated its headquarters to Calgary from Edmonton. On 15 May 1958 as part of this reorganization, 1 Signal Squadron was formed from elements of the 1 Canadian Divisional Signal Regiment in Borden, Ontario. The Squadron was garrisoned in Calgary. Initially, 1 Signal Squadron was a separate unit from the Brigade Group Headquarters. In 1968, for reasons of efficiency and cost effectiveness, 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade Group Headquarters and 1 Signal Squadron were combined into 1 Canadian Brigade Group Headquarters and Signal Squadron. The role of the Squadron was and continues to be the provision of communications, security and service support to the Commander of 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and his staff. ==Commanding officers== *Major A.P.
