She was born in New Jersey and grew up in Columbia. ==Education== Lina Puerta studied at Institute Lorenzode Medici in Florence, Italy, and earned her BA from Wells College with Honors in Studio Art in 1992. Then she earned her master's degree in Art Education from Queens College in 1998. ==Art== Puerta's work covers several mediums, all of which are heavily influenced by materials and their metaphorical significance to the work. She combines jewelry, fabric, paint, buttons, resin, wire, wood, etc. in her sculpture work, exploring the tension between nature and the human-made. Both her sculpture work and her work on paper focus on themes of nature, man made structures, fragility, and the environment in relation to humanity. Puerta's Botanico Series (2011 - 2014) is installation based and incorporates Polyurethane resin, wood, foam, paint, fiberfill, fabric, chains, rhinestones, beads, trims, and artificial plants and moss to create natural spaces emerging from a human-made object. These works explore the relationship between nature and control, as these organic, plant-based works burst through their designated locations. The Farmworker Series (2017) is one of Puerta's more recent projects. She uses paper making techniques to create vibrant tapestries which bring attention to farm workers on crops in the American south. Puerta weaves different materials in the tapestries, including lace, trims, sequined fabrics, velvet, handmade woven textile, pom-poms, fake fur, and gouache. Each piece also includes [renderings] of the flowers and leaves from the crops represented in each image, as well as, birds and insects as pollinators to these crops. ==Selected Exhibitions== ===Solo Exhibitions=== *Lina Puerta: Tapestries, Smack Mellon, Brooklyn, NY, March 10 - April 22, 2018 *MANIGUA from the Bot\u00e1nico Series, a site-specific installation for The Miller Theatre at Columbia University in collaboration with The UPTOWN Triennale of the Wallach Art Gallery, August, July 17, 2017 - June 2018 *Within/Without, Geary Contemporary, NY, NY, February - March 2017 *Lina Puerta: TRACES, Jack Geary Contemporary, New York, NY February - April 2015 (Catalog) *La Muerte de un Arbol (The Death of a Tree), Residency Exhibition, Materials for the Arts, LIC, NY Dec. 2014 *Lina Puerta: Natura, The Sage Colleges: Opalka Gallery, Albany, NY August, 31 \u2013 October 2009 \u2013 (Catalog) ===Selected Group Exhibitions=== *HyperAccumulators curated by Alexandra Rutsch Brock and Elizabeth Saperstein, Pelham Art Center, Pelham, NY January 18 - March 23, 2019 *Sedimentations: Assemblage as Social Repair, The 8th Floor, New York, NY, June 21 - December 8, 2018 *Living/Breathing, curated by Deanna Evans and Andrew Schwartz, Morgan Lehman 2, New York, NY June 21 - July 27, 2018 *Art, Artists & You, Children's Museum of Manhattan, New York, NY June 8 - December 31, 2018 *Labor & Materials, 21C Museum Hotels, Bentonville, AR, January - November, 2018 *Harlem Perspectives, Faction Art Projects, New York, NY, April 20 - May 13, 2018 *Site & Survey: The Architecture of Landscape.
