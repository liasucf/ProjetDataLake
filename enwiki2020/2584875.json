    "text": "The addition of Finnish area in the Treaty of Tyavzino The Treaty of Teusina, Tyavzin or Tyavzino (), also known as the Eternal Peace with Sweden in Russia, was concluded by Russian diplomats under boyar Afanasiy Pushkin (the poet's ancestor) and ambassadors of the Swedish king at the village of Tyavzino (, ) in Ingria on 18 May 1595 to end the Russo-Swedish War (1590\u201395) between the powers. The treaty revised the provisions of the Truce of Plussa of 1583, restoring to Russia all territory then ceded to Sweden except for Narva. Russia received most of Ingria, with the towns of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Korela Fortress. In effect, the treaty restored the borders predating the Livonian War. The Swedish-Russian border was delineated from the outstream of the Systerb\u00e4ck river into the Gulf of Finland, over lakes Saimaa, Inari, the settlement of Neiden and up to the Murman Sea. Russia had to renounce all claims on Estonia including Narva, and Sweden's sovereignty over Estonia from 1561 was confirmed. Sweden regained control over Ingria by the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617, following the Ingrian War. ==See also== *List of treaties ==Sources== * ==External links== *Text in Swedish with Finnish Translation *Scan of the treaty (IEG Mainz) Teusina Teusina Teusina Category:1595 in Sweden Category:1595 in Russia Category:1595 treaties Category:Russia\u2013Sweden treaties ",
