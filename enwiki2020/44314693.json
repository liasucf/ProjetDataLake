    "text": "Claudio Uberti is a former Argentinian government official who attained political power through personal ties to the former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, becoming head under Kirchner of the \u00d3rgano de Control de Concesiones Viales (OCCOVI), the federal agency that regulates highway concessions. During his tenure at OCCOVI, Uberti was also a key figure in the arrangement of trade deals between Argentinian and Venezuelan firms under the N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez administrations. He was described at the time as a sort of \u201cparallel\u201d ambassador from Buenos Aires to Caracas, and was an intimate of both Kirchner and Ch\u00e1vez. Uberti gained prominence a result of the 2007 Maletinazo or \"suitcase scandal\", in which a suitcase containing nearly $800,000 was seized by Buenos Aires airport police from a passenger on a diplomatic flight of which Uberti was in charge. As a consequence of this seizure, Uberti was ultimately charged with smuggling, money laundering, and the solicitation of bribes. Charges against him were eventually dropped, although an FBI probe concluded that Uberti had been transporting an illegal campaign donation from Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. His nicknames are \u201cPachi\u201d and \u201cUbi.\u201d ==Early life and education== Uberti was born in a town of 7000 people in the county of General Lopez in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, on December 3, 1957. His father, Eugenio, was a construction worker and his mother \u00c9lida, was a hairdresser. His paternal grandfather had come to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1893 at age 16. Perfil stated in October 2008 that in his hometown, Uberti, whose nickname since childhood has been \u201cPachi,\u201d was \u201cknown for his 'erratic behavior' and for scams and swindles. He was \u201ca person who was always in strange things\u201d and whose \u201caffection for money led him down different paths.\u201d One acquaintance of his youth said: \u201cPachi never enjoyed working, he enjoyed the good life.\u201d At 18 he went to Rosario to study law, but left in his third year while working at a bank. During his time in Rosario, he tried to sell a car for which he did not have the proper papers. He also caused a local scandal by gaining access to a professor's house by pretending to be her boyfriend, an incident which landed him in jail. On one occasion in the late 1970s, he pushed a girlfriend off a balcony, almost killing her, and again ended up in the Rosario jail. After his release, he \u201ctook refuge\u201d in Santa Cruz. Eventually he moved to Rio Gallegos, where he worked as an installer of ceramic tiles. He met his wife, Patricia Palacios, there. It was also in Rio Gallegos that he met and befriended Rudy Ulloa, the driver for N\u00e9stor Kirchner. Uberti, Ulloa, and Julio de Vido worked together to raise funds for N\u00e9stor Kirchner's 2003 election campaign. ==OCCOVI== When N\u00e9stor Kirchner became President, Uberti was named head of OCCOVI. He reported to his friend Julio de Vido, who had been installed as Minister of Planning. Founded in 2003, OCCOVI controlled all freeway concessions and was in charge of collecting the tolls on every toll road, highway, and bridge in the country. As head of OCCOVI, he was known jocularly as \u201cel se\u00f1or de los peajes,\u201d or \u201cthe lord of the tolls.\u201d Cronista reported in August 2007 that his contacts in politics and business universally described him as an \u201cobedient\u201d Kirchnerist \u201csoldier.\u201d While holding the position at OCCOVI, Uberti was in charge of Argentinian negotiations with the Venezuelan government involving agreements about energy, farm machinery, and other matters. Uberti has been described as having served at the time as a sort of \u201cparallel ambassador\u201d from Argentina to Venezuela who was on intimate terms with both N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. According to one source, \u201cUberti was present at every single agreement signing between the Argentinian Government and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d Eduardo Arnold, former first vice president of the Chamber of Deputies and former vice governor of the province of Santa Cruz, later said that \u201cUberti was nobody in Santa Cruz\u201d but in Venezuela \u201che was the master of ceremonies. He would not knock on the door, but kick it and come in.\u201d In June 2010, Clarin reported on a secret cable in which Arnold confirmed that he had traveled to Caracas with Uberti and de Vito in April 2005, and that their activities there had been kept secret from the then Argentinian ambassador to Venezuela, Eduardo Sadous. Residents of his hometown said that after Uberti became a part of the national government, he did a great deal to help the area. In February 2008, after the Maletizano scandal made him a household name, the magazine Noticias published an article about \u201cthe quick fortune acquired by Claudio Uberti.\u201d The article said that Uberti's story \u201cshows that an unemployed man can become a millionaire without having to look for work; it is enough to have the necessary contacts and be a Kirchnerista.\u201d The article stated that after six months of government employment, Uberti had \u201ca stunning $2 million apartment on Libertador Avenue, in a top part of Palermo,\u201d and a weekend house in an \u201cexclusive gated community.\u201d The article stated that after Uberti moved into the house, in the exclusive CUBA Fatima country club in Pilar, he ordered the construction of a pool, but being dissatisfied with the results he had it redone four times. According to the report, Uberti did not officially declare his ownership of the house and would not be able to afford it on his official income. \u201cHow do you live as a rich man without working?\u201d Noticias asked, sarcastically calling Uberti's wealth \u201canother Kirchner miracle\u201d and noting that his total assets had been 426 pesos in 2003 and were now 187,126 pesos. An article about the report in Noticias was headlined \u201cClaudio Uberti, or how to make a fortune in the shadow of Kirchner and Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d ==Maletinazo== On August 4, 2007, Uberti and his secretary, Victoria Bereziuk, arrived in Buenos Aires on a private flight from Caracas transporting Argentinian and Venezuelan government officials who were in Argentina to sign a trade deal relating to the building of pipelines. Uberti had been instrumental in arranging the deal and was in charge of the flight. Among the passengers was Venezuelan-US businessman Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, who claimed to be part of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's entourage, and whose suitcase, seized by police at the airport, turned out to contain US$790,550 in cash, which he had not declared. The discovery of the money in the suitcase caused an immediate scandal, and Uberti was promptly asked to resign from his position as head of OCCOVI. His superior, Minister of Planning Julio de Vido, explained that Uberti had been in charge of the plane and should not have allowed Wilson to fly on it. \u201cThe aircraft was joined by people who were not part of the initial delegation,\u201d de Vido said. It was reported later in August that Uberti had left the country 27 times in 12 months, and had always used the military sector of the airport. Despite de Vido's demand that Uberti step down, it was apparently widely understood that de Vido \u201cmust have known about the illegal transfer\u201d of funds, \u201csince those familiar with the Kirchner regime say that nothing happens without De Vido\u2019s approval.\u201d One report suggested that there was \u201creason to believe that this has not been the first cash transfer and that we are talking about cash smuggling on a larger scale.\u201d The report noted several apparent irregularities about the flight, which had been chartered by ENARSA, Argentina\u2019s state oil and gas company. It had landed not at Ezeiza International Airport, where most international flights to Buenos Aires land, but at Aeroparque, and it had landed at 2:30 AM, when that airport is usually closed, requiring a special order to open the airport for the flight and to arrange for the presence of customs officials. Also, the first judge assigned to the case, Marta Novatti, resigned, protesting that she had been harassed by the Kirchnerista customs director, Ricardo Echegaray. As a result of the seizure of the suitcase of money, Uberti was accused of smuggling and, later, of money laundering. Uberti said at a hearing on February 1, 2008, before Maria Luz Rivas Diez, prosecutor for economic crime, that Diego Uzc\u00e1tegui Matheus, vice-president of the state oil firm PDVSA, had introduced him to Wilson at a luncheon on August 3, 2007, the day before the flight. \u201cI had never before had any contact or relation with him,\u201d claimed Uberti, who also stated, \u201cI do not know either the origin or the destination of the money confiscated from Antonini Wilson.\u201d In an August 2011 radio interview, Wilson called Uberti a \u201ccriminal\u201d and said that the suitcase of money with which he had been caught was not his but Uberti's. He said that the PDVSA head had introduced him to Uberti, \u201cthe third man of Argentina,\u201d and that he, Wilson, did not like the looks of Uberti. At the airport, where, he said, Bereziuk had given Uberti \u201ctwo kisses like the mafiosos,\u201d Bereziuk had asked Wilson to help her with a suitcase. This, Wilson said in the 2011 interview, was the suitcase that had been seized from him by the police at the airport. An investigation by the FBI resulted in the conclusion that the money in Wilson's suitcase had been a contribution by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner's 2007 presidential election campaign. She called this claim \u201cgarbage.\u201d Other theories proposed in the media were that the money was intended for pro-Ch\u00e1vez groups in Argentina, was \u201ca kickback to Argentine government officials for a business deal,\u201d was \u201ca bribe for ENARSA,\u201d or that \u201csome renegade PDVSA officials wanted to get some cash out of the party, creating personal reserves for a foreseeable end of the Venezuelan bonanza.\u201d Argentina's own investigation proved inconclusive. In June 2012, justices dismissed the case against Uberti. In July 2012, the C\u00e1mara Nacional en lo Penal Econ\u00f3mico (National Economic Criminal Chamber) closed its investigation of Maletinazo. Periodico Tribuna charged that various authorities had taken actions to prevent Uberti's conviction. The charges against him had been changed to his benefit, and the investigation had been dropped by the Kirchnerist head of the Prosecutions Division of Customs, Federico Machesich, who at the time was a law partner of Uberti's old friend, Marcelo Goldberg. Periodico Tribuna also noted that Uberti's attorney was Diego Pirota, who also represented Vice President Amado Boudou in Boudougate. ==Sadous and Carrio charges== Eduardo Sadous, a former Argentinian Ambassador to Venezuela, claimed in 2010 that Argentinian businessmen had been forced to pay bribes to the Planning Ministry during N\u00e9stor Kirchner's administration. In April of that year, apropos of Sadous's charges, Elisa Carrio, leader of the Civic Coalition, stated that the money acquired in this manner had been \u201csent to Kirchner\u201d and that Uberti had been in charge of collecting the money and giving it to Kirchner. She said that \u201c15 percent [of the bribe money] was to negotiate with Venezuela and 10 percent was for Uberti to keep.\u201d She said that this arrangement explained \u201cwhy Uberti was constantly traveling to the country.\u201d She said that the money seized from Antonini Wilson at the Buenos Aires airport in Maletinazo had been only one of many sums that had been clandestinely transported in such a manner. \u201cThe suitcase,\u201d as she put it, \u201cappeared to be something permanent; they were not only entering the country to finance a presidential campaign.\u201d De Vido called these accusations \u201cinfamous.\u201d Uberti sued Sadous on June 28, 2010, accusing him of perjury. Uberti asked Federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral to examine testimony Sadous had given before Federal Judge Juli\u00e1n Ercolini, in the course of which Sadous had made his charges about the alleged bribery. Uberti maintained that there were contradictions in Sadous's testimony, and asked Canicoba Corral to summon Sadous to testify. ==Later activities== Perfil reported on August 4, 2012, that five years after the Wilson scandal, Uberti was still involved in oil transactions with Venezuela, advising firms on oil deals with PDVSA. As of 2012, according to Perfil, he was under investigation to determine whether he was involved in a scheme to force bribes out of Argentinian businessmen who wanted to export goods to Venezuela. In December 2013, federal prosecutor Carlos Rivolo asked Judge Seb\u00e1stian Casanello to try Uberti and Ricardo Jaime, former Minister of Transportation, because Uberti, as head of OCCoVI, had allowed Jaime to use as his own a Honda Civic owned by OCCAVI. ==Personal life== Uberti and his wife have three children, Mar\u00eda Florencia, Claudio, and Mar\u00eda Cecilia. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1957 births Category:Argentine politicians ",
