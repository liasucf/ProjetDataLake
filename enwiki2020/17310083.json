The federation was founded in June 1967, and is a member of the IOF. ==History== ===History of Orienteering in UK before the BOF=== Orienteering was introduced to the UK in the 1950s and was heavily supported by renowned Olympians including John Disley and Chris Brasher. The early years were helped by orienteers from Sweden: in 1962 Baron 'Rak' Largerfelt of the Stockholm Orienteering Club came to Scotland to help develop the sport. This culminated in the first championship being held in May 1962 at Dunkeld, and the formation of the Scottish Orienteering Association. Later visitors from Sweden included Jan Kjellstr\u00f6m, a son of Silva compass founder Alvar Kjellstr\u00f6m. Kjellstr\u00f6m played an important role in the development of the sport and helped to accelerate developments in orienteering competition, mapping and coaching. Kjellstr\u00f6m died in a road accident early in the year of 1967. 1967 saw the first Jan Kjellstr\u00f6m International Festival of Orienteering or \"JK\", held in memory of Kjellstr\u00f6m. Later that year the British Orienteering Federation was formed by the amalgamation of the English and Scottish Associations leading to the first British Orienteering Championships held at Hamsterley Forest. ===After the Founding of BOF=== With the growth of the sport BOF was founded in 1967, and continued to develop. There were 12 national and regional associations by 1972; the British Schools Orienteering Association joining in 1995 when it was formed to promote orienteering in schools. The Federation's membership had reached around 10,000 by 1998 and the club membership had increased to more 150 clubs. ==Structure== The federation is made up of thirteen constituent associations, one each for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; nine for the English regions; and the British Schools Orienteering Association.
