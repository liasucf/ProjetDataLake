    "text": "Don't Stop Movin' is the sole album by the Italian electronic music duo Livin' Joy. It featured the song \"Dreamer\", which peaked at No.1 on the UK Singles & US Dance charts, both in 1995. Janice Robinson who sang the lead on \"Dreamer\" decided to leave the group soon after, unable to reach a deal to record an album with the band. The band continued on and released \"Don't Stop Movin'\" a few months later, by which time Tameka Starr had been chosen to be the dance group's new lead vocalist. \"Don't Stop Movin'\" peaked at No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in Spring 1996. This was followed by another Top 10 single in the UK, (\"Follow the Rules\"). Two top 20 hits appeared in 1997, \"Where Can I Find Love\" and \"Deep in You\". The parent album, also called Don't Stop Movin', grouped together the hits, including \"Dreamer\" with new vocals by Starr (although the original version with Robinson was included in the album as a hidden bonus track). There had been plans for a widespread commercial release of a single called \"Just for the Sex of It\" in Spring 1999; however these plans never happened. It only received a limited club run, but was released as a single in Australia and the UK. ==Track listing== # \"Dreamer\" (with Tameka Starr) # \"Don't Stop Movin'\" # \"Deep in You\" # \"Follow the Rules\" # \"Pick up the Phone\" # \"Be Original\" # \"Where Can I Find Love\" # \"Don't Cha Wanna\" # \"Whenever You're Lonely\" # \"Let Me Love You\" # \"Don't Stop Movin' (A.
