It was held on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York. Rafael Nadal and Bianca Andreescu were the men's and women's singles defending champions; however, both decided not to compete. Nadal withdrew from the tournament citing safety concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the switchover to the European clay court season immediately afterward, while Andreescu stated that the pandemic had compromised her ability to prepare and compete at her highest level. Dominic Thiem won the men's singles title, defeating first time Grand Slam finalist Alexander Zverev in a five-set match to capture his first Grand Slam title. Naomi Osaka won the women's singles title, defeating Victoria Azarenka in three sets, capturing her second US Open title and third Grand Slam title overall. ==Tournament== The Arthur Ashe Stadium (pictured here in 2006) was the venue for the 2020 US Open finals. The 2020 US Open was the 140th edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States. The tournament will be held on 17 Laykold hard courts. The tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2020 ATP Tour and the 2020 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted only of the men's and women's singles and doubles draws, and both doubles draws were cut to 32 pairs instead of the standard 64. Singles players remain in standard 128-person format in each category. Under the decision of the New York state government, qualifying matches, mixed doubles and junior matches would not be played. It was initially announced that the wheelchair tournaments would not be held normally in every quadrennial year due to conflicting with the Summer Paralympic Games (as this year's Paralympics postponed to 2021); however this was reversed when it would be played rather than not held this year as received criticism from players such as Dylan Alcott. The tournament used two of the three main show courts at the National Tennis Center \u2013 Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium. Grandstand was not used as it was the main stadium of this year's Western & Southern Open, also held in New York City instead of its usual Cincinnati venue. ==Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic== This event is normally the fourth and final major tournament of the year (scheduled for the last Monday of August to second Sunday of September) and the peak of the North American hard court season. Due to concerns relating to the ongoing pandemic, during June 2020, it was announced that this event would take place without spectators (for the first time in the tournament's history, and the first time in all the Grand Slam tournaments' 143-year history) after being approved by Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York state, in which the venue is located. The players entering the United States would not need to get quarantined, but had to get tested for the virus before leaving for New York City and had to continue testing throughout the tournament. If players tested positive for the virus, they would be forced to leave the tournament. In accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regulations, players and personnel had to wear a face mask upon entering the grounds except while practicing, training, and working out. The third-round match between Alexander Zverev and Adrian Mannarino at Louis Armstrong Stadium was delayed for three hours due to a \"collaborative dialogue with health officials\". Mannarino was one of ten players in contact with Beno\u00eet Paire (who withdrew from the tournament after testing positive for COVID-19) that were placed under USTA's additional protocols for coronavirus. The number one women's doubles team of Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic was forced to withdraw from their second round match after the state of New York overruled the New York City government on whether players in contact with Beno\u00eet Paire, but not positive for COVID-19, would be allowed to compete. Mladenovic was one of ten players placed under USTA's additional protocols for coronavirus. ==Broadcast== In the United States, the 2020 US Open is the sixth year in a row under an 11-year, $825 million contract with ESPN, in which the broadcaster holds exclusive rights to the entire tournament and the US Open Series, with Tennis Channel airing overnight replays of the world feed. This means that the tournament is not available on broadcast television. Prior to the broadcast of the women's singles final, Mariah Carey will premiere the video for her song \"Save The Day\", which was filmed in front of Arthur Ashe Stadium on the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and which features clips of past US Open champions Venus and Serena Williams, Sloane Stephens, and Naomi Osaka. In the United Kingdom, Amazon Prime Video holds exclusive rights to the tournament. ==Singles players== ;Men's Singles {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- ! colspan=4|Men's singles players |- style=\"font- size:110%\" !

Alexander Zverev, 2\u20136, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133, 7\u20136(8\u20136) The men's singles tournament began on August 31, with Novak Djokovic holding the top seeding and top players Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal opting out. Ten seeded players suffered defeats in the first two rounds, including 9th seed Diego Schwartzman, who lost in the first round to Cameron Norrie. The third round eliminated a further eight seeded players, most notably 4-seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who fell in a fifth-set tiebreak to Borna \u0106ori\u0107, and 11-seed Karen Khachanov, who lost to Alex de Minaur despite the latter's second-set bagel and subsequent third-set code violation for racket abuse. Much of the fourth-round action was overshadowed by controversy surrounding top seed Novak Djokovic's match against 20th seed Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta. After losing a point while trailing 5\u20136 in the first set, Djokovic hit a ball out of frustration that hit a line judge in the throat. Tournament rules necessitated that Djokovic default the match, marking the first time a top-seeded player had been disqualified from a Grand Slam singles tournament. The quarterfinals took place on September 8\u20139. The top two remaining seeds, No. 2 Dominic Thiem and No. 3 Daniil Medvedev, both advanced in straight sets, while No. 5 Alexander Zverev advanced in four sets and No. 20 Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta advanced in five. Thiem took his semifinal match over Medvedev in straight sets, while Busta won the first two sets before losing the final three to Zverev. This set up a final between Thiem, making his fourth Grand Slam finals appearance, and Zverev, making his first; both players were seeking their first Grand Slam title. Zverev, the underdog, jumped out to an early advantage, taking the first set 6\u20132 and the second set 6\u20134. Thiem battled back in the third and fourth sets, winning them 6\u20134 and 6\u20133, respectively. This set up a fifth and final set, which came down to the wire and was won by Thiem on a tiebreak, 7\u20136 (6), after four hours and one minute, making Thiem the first new Grand Slam winner in six years. This also marked the first time since Pancho Gonzalez in 1949 that a two-set deficit had been overcome in a US Open final. ===Women's Singles=== * Naomi Osaka def. Victoria Azarenka, 1\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20133 The women's singles tournament began August 31, with Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 holding the top seed. The top two rounds, conducted over the first four days of the tournament, saw the exit of seven seeded players, notably 1-seed Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 and 5-seed Aryna Sabalenka, who both fell in the second round in straight sets against Caroline Garcia and Victoria Azarenka, respectively. In the third round, 7-seed Madison Keys was forced to retire her match against Aliz\u00e9 Cornet in the second set after suffering an injury, putting Cornet through to her first-ever US Open Round of 16. The fourth round saw a further four top-ten players fall, notably 2-seed Sofia Kenin, who lost to Elise Mertens, and 6-seed Petra Kvitov\u00e1, who was upset by Shelby Rogers. This left the third- and fourth-seeded players, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as the top two players headed into the finals. Each faced an unranked player, as Williams defeated Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets and Osaka beat Rogers in two. The other two semifinals saw No. 28 Jennifer Brady defeat No. 23 Yulia Putintseva, and unranked Victoria Azarenka upset No. 11 Elise Mertens. This left Azarenka as the only unranked player in the semifinals, but she proved that not to matter in her three-set defeat of Serena Williams, which put her through to her fifth Grand Slam final. She would be met in the final by Osaka, who defeated Brady in three sets to qualify for her third Grand Slam final. In the final, Azarenka got out to an early lead after taking the first set in dominant fashion, 6\u20131. Soon after, Osaka \"woke up from her self-described bad attitude\" and won four straight games in the second set to win 6\u20133 and force the final into a third. Osaka was victorious in the final set as well, winning it 6\u20133 to secure her second US Open title and her third Grand Slam. ===Men's Doubles=== * Mate Pavi\u0107 / Bruno Soares def. Wesley Koolhof / Nikola Mekti\u0107, 7\u20135, 6\u20133 Coming into the men's doubles tournament, the all-Colombian team of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah held the top seed. The first round saw the surprising exit of four of the eight seeded pairs, including the 2-seed pair of \u0141ukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo and the 4-seed pair of Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek and Ivan Dodig. Two more seeded pairs dropped out in the second round, as top-seeded Cabal and Farah faltered, as did the 6-seed German pair of Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies. The remaining two seeded pairs met each other in the semifinals, as No. 8 Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mekti\u0107 defeated No. 3 Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury. The other semifinal saw Jean- Julien Rojer and Horia Tec\u0103u fall to Mate Pavi\u0107 and Bruno Soares; both semifinal matches were decided in two sets. In the final, Pavi\u0107 and Soares jumped out to a lead as they took the first set 7\u20135. Koolhoff and Mekti\u0107 could not respond, and the second set ended in favor of Pavi\u0107 and Soares, giving them their second and third Grand Slam doubles titles, respectively. ===Women's Doubles=== * Laura Siegemund / Vera Zvonareva def. Nicole Melichar / Xu Yifan, 6\u20134, 6\u20134 Entering the women's doubles tournament, the top seed was awarded to T\u00edmea Babos of Hungary and Kristina Mladenovic of France. While the first round saw the exit of only one of the eight seeded pairs in the tournament (the fifth-seeded pair of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Zhang Shuai were defeated by Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend), the second round saw four such occurrences. The bottom three seeded pairs \u2013 No. 6 Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara, No. 7 Victoria Azarenka and Sofia Kenin, and No. 8 Anna-Lena Friedsam and Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1 \u2013 were all defeated, and the No. 1 pair of Babos and Mladenovic were disqualified as a result of Beno\u00eet Paire's positive COVID-19 test, which required Mladenovic, who had reportedly had close contact with Paire, to quarantine and therefore drop out of the tournament. Their match was awarded on a walkover to Gabriela Dabrowski and Alison Riske, and Babos would later refer to the decision as an \"injustice\", citing the numerous negative COVID-19 tests taken by both of the pair and the clearing of a male athlete in a similar situation the day before. The tournament progressed to the quarterfinals, where the No. 2 pair of Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka and the No. 4 pair of Kv\u011bta Peschke and Demi Schuurs were both defeated. In the semifinals, Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend were defeated by the 3-seed pair of Nicole Melichar and Xu Yifan. The other semifinal saw Anna Blinkova and Veronika Kudermetova fall to Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva; both semifinals were decided in three sets. This set up a final between the pair of Melichar and Xu and the pair of Siegemund and Zvonareva; the latter team took the final in two sets (6\u20134, 6\u20134) to win the title. This marked the first women's doubles title for Siegemund and the third for Zvonareva. ===Wheelchair Men's Singles=== * Shingo Kunieda def. Alfie Hewett, 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 7\u20136(7\u20133) The wheelchair men's singles tournament had two seeded players, No. 1 Shingo Kunieda and No. 2 Gustavo Fern\u00e1ndez, and six other unseeded players. In the tournament's opening round, the quarterfinals, Kunieda defeated Nicolas Peifer, and Fern\u00e1ndez defeated St\u00e9phane Houdet, both in two sets. The quarterfinals also saw Casey Ratzlaff fall in three sets to Joachim G\u00e9rard, and Alfie Hewett defeat Gordon Reid in two. In the semifinals, Kunieda faced G\u00e9rard, and bounced back from a first set loss to win in three, while Hewett upset Fern\u00e1ndez in three after splitting the first two sets. This set up a final between top-seeded Shingo Kunieda and unseeded Alfie Hewett; the former in his 29th Grand Slam singles final and the latter in his fifth. The match came down to the wire, with each player taking one of the first two sets by a score of 6\u20133. The third set reached 6\u20136 and went to a tiebreak, where Kunieda was victorious to win his 24th Grand Slam singles title. ===Wheelchair Women's Singles=== * Diede de Groot def. Yui Kamiji, 6\u20133, 6\u20133 The wheelchair women's singles tournament, like the men's competition, was contested by eight players. Two were seeded, No. 1 Diede de Groot and No. 2 Yui Kamiji, while the six others were unseeded. The tournament opened with de Groot defeating Jordanne Whiley and Kamiji defeating Momoko Ohtani, both in straight sets. The other two quarterfinals saw Marjolein Buis eliminate Dana Mathewson in two sets and Ang\u00e9lica Bernal defeat wild card entry Lucy Shuker in three. In the semifinals, both top seeds advanced, with de Groot defeating Buis in three sets and Kamiji beating Bernal in two. This set up a final between the top two seeds, de Groot and Kamiji. The top seeded player, de Groot, did not give Kamiji much of an opportunity for the upset, taking both sets 6\u20133 and winning her third US Open title. ===Wheelchair Quad Singles=== * Sam Schr\u00f6der def. Dylan Alcott, 7\u20136(7\u20135), 0\u20136, 6\u20134 The wheelchair quad singles competition was not played as a traditional tournament bracket; rather, it was played in a round robin-style tournament with the top two finishers moving on to the championship match. Four players took part in the tournament: No. 1 Dylan Alcott, No. 2 Andy Lapthorne, unseeded David Wagner, and wild card entry Sam Schr\u00f6der. In round robin play, Alcott topped the standings by winning all three of his matches, beating Lapthorne and Schr\u00f6der in two sets and Wagner in three. Schr\u00f6der's rather dominant two-set upset of Lapthorne gave him second place and the other berth in the final; Lapthorne finished the round robin with one win and Wagner finished with none. The final was contested by top- seeded Alcott and Schr\u00f6der. The first set was evenly played by both competitors, but was won by Schr\u00f6der in a tiebreak. Alcott recovered with a second-set bagel to force the game into a third set, which was won by Schr\u00f6der in upset fashion, 6\u20134, for his first US Open title. Schr\u00f6der's win was especially unlikely considering that Alcott was seeking his eleventh Grand Slam title while Schr\u00f6der was appearing in a Grand Slam event for the first time. ===Wheelchair Men's Doubles=== * Alfie Hewett / Gordon Reid def. St\u00e9phane Houdet / Nicolas Peifer, 6\u20134, 6\u20131 The wheelchair men's doubles tournament was contested by the same eight players who contested the singles event. The top seed was given to the pair of Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid, with the second seed given to St\u00e9phane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer. Hewett and Reid faced Gustavo Fern\u00e1ndez and Shingo Kunieda in the tournament's opening semifinal round, defeating them in two sets, while Houdet and Peifer took down Casey Ratzlaff and Joachim G\u00e9rard, also in two. This set up a final between the two top seeds, which was won in two sets by the top-ranked duo of Hewett and Reid. ===Wheelchair Women's Doubles=== * Yui Kamiji / Jordanne Whiley def. Marjolein Buis / Diede de Groot, 6\u20133, 6\u20133 As with the men's tournament, the wheelchair women's doubles event was contested by the same group of eight players that played in the singles event. The semifinal round proved not to be a challenge for either of the two seeded pairs, as the top-seeded duo of Marjolein Buis and Diede de Groot defeated Ang\u00e9lica Bernal and Dana Mathewson and he second-seeded pair of Yui Kamiji and Jordanne Whiley defeated Momoko Ohtani and Lucy Shuker, both in straight sets. In the final, Kamiji and Whiley were able to outlast Buis and de Groot, winning both sets by a score of 6\u20133, and earning their eleventh Grand Slam title together. ===Wheelchair Quad Doubles=== * Dylan Alcott / Andy Lapthorne def. Sam Schr\u00f6der / David Wagner, 3\u20136, 6\u20134, [10\u20138] The wheelchair quad doubles event was the smallest at the tournament, with only four players (the same four that contested the singles event) competing. As a result, there was only one match played to determine the champion. In the first set, underdogs Sam Schr\u00f6der and David Wagner jumped out to an early lead by winning the first set 6\u20133, but Dylan Alcott and Andy Lapthorne battled back to force a third with a 6\u20134 second-set victory. The third set was not played traditionally, but rather as just a tiebreak, which was won 10\u20138 by Alcott and Lapthorne to secure them the wheelchair quad doubles title. ==Point distribution and prize money== ===Point distribution=== 2,000 points were awarded to the winners of the men's and women's singles titles. The men's finalist received 1,200 and the women's finalist received 1,300. Men's singles semifinalists each got 720 points, while women's singles semifinalists got 780. Those that were eliminated in the men's singles quarterfinals got 360 points, while women's singles players eliminated in the quarterfinals got 430. The point allotment for those eliminated in the first four rounds of the tournament decreases the earlier a player was eliminated; for the men's singles tournament, the points given were 180, 90, 45, and 10 for each of the first four rounds, while women's singles players got 240, 130, 70, and 10 for an exit in the first four rounds. All men's and women's doubles players that made it past the first round received half the points of their singles counterparts. Men's doubles players that lost their first round matchup did not receive any points, while women's players in the same situation received ten. All winners of a wheelchair competition received 800 points, with the finalists of all competitions except the quad doubles receiving 500 points.
