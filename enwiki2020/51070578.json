    "text": "V883 Orionis is a protostar in the constellation of Orion. It is associated with IC 430 (Haro 13A), a peculiar H\u03b1 object surveyed by Guillermo Haro in 1952. It is assumed to be a member of the Orion Nebula cluster at , although the Gaia Data Release 2 parallax suggests a closer distance. V883 Orionis, like most protostars, is surrounded by a circumstellar disc of dust. The dust has a water snow line, a certain distance where the stellar irradiance from the star is low enough that water can freeze to snow. The water snow line was directly imaged by ALMA, when a stellar outburst increased the amount of insolation and pushed the line out farther. ==Gallery== File:The protoplanetary disc around V883 Orionis (artist's impression).webm|Artist's impression of the planet-forming disc around V883 Orionis File:New observations with ALMA reveal water snow line around young star.webm|Informative video about the planet-forming disc around V883 Orionis File:Artist\u2019s impression of the water snowline around the young star V883 Orionis.jpg|Artist's impression of the water snow line around V883 Orionis, detected with ALMA File:49 Ori - IC 430 - IC 429 - DSS2 labbeled.png|IC 429 and IC 430 next to the star 49 Ori == References == Category:Orion (constellation) Category:Orion Molecular Cloud Complex Category:FU Orionis stars Orionis, V883 ",
