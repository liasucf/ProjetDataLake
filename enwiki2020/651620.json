    "text": "Potos\u00ed, known as Villa Imperial de Potos\u00ed in the colonial period, is the capital city and a municipality of the Department of Potos\u00ed in Bolivia. It is one of the highest cities in the world at a nominal .Bolivia & Main Cities / Potos\u00ed from boliviaweb.com. Retrieved 2010-09-27. For centuries, it was the location of the Spanish colonial silver mint. Potos\u00ed lies at the foot of the Cerro de Potos\u00edNot to be mistaken with Cerro Potos\u00ed, Mexico \u2014sometimes referred to as the Cerro Rico (\"rich mountain\")\u2014 a mountain popularly conceived of as being \"made of\" silver ore that dominates the city. The Cerro Rico is the reason for Potos\u00ed's historical importance since it was the major supply of silver for the Spanish Empire until Guanajuato in Mexico surpassed it in the 18th century. The silver was taken by llama and mule train to the Pacific coast, shipped north to Panama City, and carried by mule train across the isthmus of Panama to Nombre de Dios or Portobelo, whence it was taken to Spain on the Spanish treasure fleets. Some of the silver also made its way east to Buenos Aires, via the Rio de la Plata. Cerro de Potos\u00ed's peak is above sea level. ==Geology== Located in the Bolivian Tin Belt, Cerro Rico de Potos\u00ed is the world's largest silver deposit and has been mined since the sixteenth century, producing up to 60,000 tonnes by 1996. Estimates are that much silver still remains in the mines. Potos\u00ed became the second largest city, and the site of the first mint, in the Americas. By 1891, low silver prices prompted the change to mining tin, which continued until 1985. At peak production in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ore contained up to 40% silver.Cunningham, C.G., Zartman, R.E., McKee, E.H., Rye, R.O., Naeser, C.W., Sanjines V., O., Ericksen, G.E., Tavera V., F., 1996, The age and thermal history of Cerro rico de Potosi, Bolivia, Mineralium Deposita, 31, 374-385 The ore deposits reside in veins present in the dacite volcanic dome. The hill is \"honeycombed\" with underground workings, reaching from the summit to depths of . The conical hill has a reddish-brown gossan cap of iron-oxides and quartz, with grayish-blue altered dacite and many mine dumps below. Basement rocks consist of Ordovician clastic sediments consisting of phyllite with some sandstone interbedding. At about 13.8 Ma, the dome was extruded. During the explosive process, the Venus breccia formed when the ascending dacite magma reacted with groundwater to produce a phreatic eruption. The released pressure allowed the formation of the Caracoles tuff ring on top of the breccia. The magma then extruded outward from a dike to form a volcanic dome over the tuff. The dacite dome is by at the surface and narrows down to the wide dike at depth. Hydrothermal circulation and fracturing soon followed, altering the dacite and depositing ore minerals and gangue in the veins. ==History== Cerro Rico del Potosi, the first image in Europe. Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n, 1553 Widow of the Mines, Potos\u00ed, Bolivia 2004, taken by Manuel Rivera-Ortiz: Miners at work Potos\u00ed, aerial photo Central plaza of Potos\u00ed ===Colonial silver boom=== Founded in 1545 as a mining town, it soon produced fabulous wealth, and the population eventually exceeded 200,000 people. The city gave rise to a Spanish expression, still in use: vale un Potos\u00ed, (\"to be worth a Potos\u00ed\") meaning \"to be of great value\". The rich mountain, Cerro Rico, produced an estimated 60% of all silver mined in the world during the second half of the 16th century. Potos\u00ed miners at first mined the rich oxidized ores with native silver and silver chloride (cerargyrite) that could be fed directly into smelting furnaces. Especially successful were the small clay \"flower pot\" furnaces called guayras, which had been used by the Incas. But by 1565, the miners had exhausted the direct-smelting ore, and silver production plummeted. Silver production was revived by the introduction of the patio process, invented in Mexico in 1554. The patio process used mercury amalgamation to extract silver from lower-grade ores, and those containing silver sulfide (argentite), as was typical of the unoxidized ores found deeper in the mountain. In 1609, another mercury amalgamation method, the pan amalgamation process was invented in Potosi, and proved better-adapted to the conditions at Potosi.Ronald D. Crozier, \u201cSilver processing in Spanish America; the patio process and beyond,\u201d CIM Bulletin, July-Aug. 1993, v.86 n.972 p.86-91. Spanish American mines were the world's most abundant sources of silver during this time period. Spanish America's ability to supply a great amount of silver and China's strong demand for this commodity resulted in a spectacular mining boom. The true champion of this boom in the silver industry was indeed the Spanish crown. By allowing private-sector entrepreneurs to operate mines under license and placing high taxes on mining profits, the Spanish empire was able to extract the greatest benefits. An example of a tax that was levied includes the quinto, a 20% severance tax on gross value. From the raw materials extracted from the mines, coins called pieces of eight were fashioned at the Potos\u00ed mint. For Europeans, Peru\u2013Bolivia was located in the Viceroyalty of Peru and was known as Alto Per\u00fa before becoming independent as part of Bolivia. Potosi was a mythical land of riches, it is mentioned in Miguel de Cervantes' famous novel, Don Quixote (second part, chap. LXXI) as a land of \"extraordinary richness\". One theory holds that the mint mark of Potos\u00ed (the letters \"PTSI\" superimposed on one another) is the origin of the dollar sign. The urban complex in the remote Andes was important enough to be designated a Villa Imperial in the hierarchy of Spanish urban settlements. Although in mountainous terrain, the core of Potos\u00ed was laid out in the standard Spanish grid pattern, where at the beginning of the seventeenth century some 6,000 Spaniards, mostly male, were resident. Indigenous settlements outside the core were more haphazard. The villa was governed by a Spanish corregidor and town council. Some 40 notaries documented and recorded commercial transactions as well as last wills and testaments. Since Potos\u00ed was of such economic importance to the Spanish Empire, the crown bureaucracy was a significant presence. Large churches, lavishly decorated inside, were built, and friars from the Dominican, Franciscans, Augustinians, Mercederians, and Jesuits were present, but no convent for women. There was an ecclesiastical court for legal issues regarding the clergy.Lane, Potos\u00ed, pp. 94-96 === Labor === Native-American laborers were conscripted and forced to work in Potos\u00ed's silver mines through the traditional Incan mita system of contributed labor. Many of them died due to the harsh conditions of the mine life and natural gases. At such a high altitude, pneumonia was always a concern, and mercury poisoning took the lives of many involved in the refining process. According to Noble David Cook, \"A key factor in understanding the impact of the Potosi mita on the Indians is that mita labor was only one form of work at the mines. A 1603 report stated that of 58,800 Indians working at Potosi, 5100 were mitayos, or fewer than one in ten. In addition to the mitayos there were 10,500 mingas (contractual workers) and 43,200 free wage earners. Yet mitayos were required to do the work others refused: predominantly the transport of the ore up the shafts to the mouth of the mine.\" From around 1600, the death rate skyrocketed among the local Native Andean communities. Eight million died in the Potosi Mines the vast, vast majority being Native American slaves brought from all over the Americas. A relatively small number of African slaves, though due to high population density of Natives and transport cost of African slave, their numbers remained low unlike the Carribean islands. ===Colonial-era society=== Potos\u00ed was a multiracial society, with native Andeans, Spanish settlers, and black slaves. The largest sector of the population were native men, forced to labor underground mining the silver ore, but there were considerable opportunities for merchants and native traders, who became wealthy. Suppliers of food as well holders of urban and rural real estate prospered in Potos\u00ed. Women, particularly widows, held property, since they were guaranteed a portion of their husband's estate under Spanish law. Small-scale female vendors dominated street markets and stalls, selling food, coca leaves, and chicha (maize beer).J.H. Elliott, \"The Silver Rush\" https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/21/potosi-silver-rush/ A portion of the female population were sex workers, which is a typical phenomenon in mining towns generally. By the early 17th century, Basques were well established in the city and made up for a substantial number of the inhabitants in Potos\u00ed. They gathered in a confederation opposed to another one, the Vicu\u00f1as, a melting pot of natives and non-Basque Spanish and Portuguese colonists, fighting for control over ore extraction from the mines and its management. Eventually, tension among both factions came to a head, resulting in the eruption of overt armed conflict starting 1622 up to 1625. The Spanish Crown intervened, siding at one point with the Basques. Finally, both factions reached a settlement sealed with a wedding between the son and daughter of the leaders in either side, the Basque Francisco Oyanume and the Vicu\u00f1a general Castillo. One of the most famous Basque residents in Potos\u00ed (1617\u201319) was Catalina de Erauso, a nun who escaped her convent and dressed as a man, becoming a driver of llamas and a soldier.Lane, Potos\u00ed, pp. 100-101 ===Independence era=== During the Bolivian War of Independence (1809\u20131825), Potos\u00ed frequently passed between the control of Royalist and Patriot forces. Major leadership mistakes came when the First Auxiliary Army arrived from Buenos Aires (under the command of Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli), which led to an increased sense that Potosi required its own independent government. Later, the Second Auxiliary Army (under the command of Manuel Belgrano) was forced to retreat, Belgrano made the decision to blow up the Casa de la Moneda. The natives undid the fuse, as many refused to evacuate and would have lost their lives. Two more expeditions from Buenos Aires would seize Potos\u00ed. ===Modern era=== Potos\u00ed continues to be an important administrative center, mining town, tourist attraction, and population center in modern Bolivia. ==Origin of the name== A Spanish colonial two-reales piece (\"two bits\") from the Potos\u00ed Mint There is no authoritative etymology for the word \"Potos\u00ed\". According to legend, in about 1462, Huayna Capac, the eleventh Sapa Inca of what by then was known as the Inca Empire \"set out for Ccolque Porco and Andaccaua, the location of his mines from which were taken innumerable arrobas of silver\" (an arroba is a Spanish unit of weight equivalent to approximately ). Before leaving there, he saw Potos\u00ed, and admiring its beauty and grandeur, he said (speaking to those of his Court): It is believed that \"Potos\u00ed\" is a Quechua word. However, in Quechua the phoneme p'otoj does not refer to a thunderous noise, whereas it does in Aymara. Thus, if Potos\u00ed encompasses the idea of a thunderous noise, the location would have an Aymaran root rather than a Quechuan. The actual sharp structure of the term is contrary to the nature of both Aymara and Quechua. Another explanation, given by several Quechua speakers, is that potoq is an onomatopoeic word that reproduces the sound of the hammer against the ore, and oral tradition has it that the town derived its name from this word. ==Climate== Potos\u00ed features a rare climate for a city of its size, due to its extreme elevation at over 4000m. Semiarid and with average temperatures in its warmest month sitting right on the 10 \u00b0C threshold, the city's climate straddles that of the subtropical highland climate (Cwc, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with subpolar oceanic characteristics and an alpine climate (E). Summers are cool and wet with daily highs rarely rising above 20 \u00b0C, while winters feature cooler days with much colder nights averaging \u22124 \u00b0C. These low temperatures are a result of the extreme precipitation deficit during the winter months with the resulting aridity leading to an increased diurnal temperature variation. ==Neighborhoods== * Old Town * San Gerardo * La Chacra * Cervecer\u00eda * Alto Potos\u00ed * Nuevo Potos\u00ed * San Mart\u00edn * Pampa Ingenio * Nacional Potos\u00ed * San Juan * Concepci\u00f3n * San Crist\u00f3bal * Pailaviri * Cachi Rancho * El Calvario * San Pedro * San Roque * Mercado Uyuni * San Benito * Villa Espa\u00f1a * Huachacalla * Cantumarca * San Clemente * Ciudad Sat\u00e9lite * Plan 40 * Las Delicias * Los Pinos-Cordepo * Las Lecher\u00edas * Villa Mec\u00e0nicos * Villa Copacabana * Villa Venezuela * Villa Nazaret ==Sports== Potos\u00ed is home to football teams Real and Nacional, which play their matches at the 32,000-capacity multi-purpose stadium Estadio V\u00edctor Agust\u00edn Ugarte, one of the highest stadiums in the world. ==Transportation== The city is served by Aeropuerto Capit\u00e1n Nicolas Rojas, with commercial airline flights by Boliviana de Aviaci\u00f3n, Bolivia's flag air carrier. ==Legacy== The city of San Luis Potos\u00ed in Mexico was named after Potos\u00ed in Bolivia. In the United States, the name Potosi was optimistically given to lead-mining towns of Potosi, Wisconsin, and Potosi, Missouri, and also to the silver-mining town of Potosi, Nevada. ==Sister cities== * San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico * York, England, UK * Lhasa, Tibet, China ==Gallery== File:Potosi Street Scene.jpg|Central Potosi street File:Vista panor\u00e1mica de Potos\u00ed.jpg|Panoramic of Potos\u00ed File:Potosi Mining Photo by Sascha Grabow.jpg|Potosi surface mining File:Laguna_Verde_DSCN5693mod.jpg|Laguna Verde, Bolivia File:Cerro Rico Potosi (pixinn.net).jpg|A street in Potos\u00ed with Cerro Rico in the background.
