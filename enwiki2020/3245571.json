    "text": "Lauri Arvi Viita (17 December 1916 \u2013 22 December 1965) was a poet hailing from the Pispala district of Tampere, Finland. Viita was a verbally talented son of a carpenter who became a self-taught writer. He only published four poetry collections, but they became very popular. He also inspired other writers who had a working-class background. Viita's last creative years were shadowed by a mental illness, and he spent several periods in hospital. Viita wrote mainly traditional poetry with rhymes. In 1950s, he was shadowed by emerging modernists such as Paavo Haavikko and Tuomas Anhava. He played with words and published e.g. a poem where all words started with letter K. Viita was married three times and had seven children. His second wife was famous poet Aila Meriluoto. Viita died in a car accident in December 1965. == Selected works == * Betonimyll\u00e4ri (poems, 1947) * Kukunor (a poetic fairytale, 1949) * Moreeni (a novel, 1950) * K\u00e4ppyr\u00e4inen (poems, 1954) * Suutarikin, suuri viisas (poems, 1961) * Ent\u00e4s sitten, Leevi (a novel, 1965) ==References== ==External links== * * Lauri Viita Museum Category:1916 births Category:1965 deaths Category:People from Tampere Category:Finnish male poets Category:20th-century Finnish poets Category:People with schizophrenia Category:20th-century male writers Category:Road incident deaths in Finland ",
