    "text": "Soundtrack to the Apocalypse is a box set by the American thrash metal band Slayer. Released November 25, 2003 through American Recordings, the four\u2013disc CD and DVD set features music from previous albums, unreleased material, and live film. A deluxe edition version (which has the alias \"ammo box\"CMJ New Music Report November 3, 2003. p. 23) was released and featured everything from the standard edition, with the addition of 14 live tracks. The box set's name originated from an alternative title for 2001's God Hates Us All. After discussing among themselves the idea of the box set, the band informed their record company, who initially disliked but later approved the idea. Many dates were stated by band members as to when it would be released. The official release date was not announced until late October 2003. The box set has been released into the public domain five times between late 2003 to early 2007. There were several producers and film directors that were involved with the box set. The set received positive reviews from critics, but was not well received by fans, with the set debuting on no notable charts. ==Conception== Around the time Slayer thought of the album title for 2001's God Hates Us All, Soundtrack to the Apocalypse was considered an alternative name. Vocalist Tom Araya then suggested that if they ever opted to issue a box set, Soundtrack to the Apocalypse would be the most appropriate title. This inspired discussion regarding a possible box set release, which continued for several months. The group decided that once the label agreed to a release, they would be given a little more time to compile the material. Slayer approached the record company regarding a box set release, and discussions lasted roughly a year, since the band had to negotiate with the record company concerning plans they had with the box set which were not in their contract. In September 2003, the record company granted permission to issue the box set and wanted an immediate release for the holiday season. Slayer submitted a range of material for the record company to choose from, instructing them to return a track list of what they felt to be the best items. Following this, Slayer looked at the returned material; if the recorded track was a \u201cgood\u201d performance but the band \"didn\u2019t care for the song\", they asked the record company to select another track. Guitarist Kerry King commented \"there's tons of stuff on there\", citing the amount they had to choose from as a problem. King himself owned five large Tupperware storage boxes full of material amassed over the years. Having every magazine had ever seen the group inside, King also possessed roughly 70 VHS and 8mm videos dating back to 1983. Nick John of Slayer\u2019s management team sifted through every video and transferred them to DVD. ==Production== Soundtrack to the Apocalypses ideal release date was in early November 2003.CMJ New Music Report September 22, 2003. p.21 However, on September 25, 2003, it was announced by employees of MTV that the box set's release date had been pushed back to November 18, 2003.Iann Robinson, Ryan J.
