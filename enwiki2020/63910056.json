It was created in 1841, based on the previous electoral district of the same name for the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. Yamaska was represented by one member in the Legislative Assembly. It was abolished in 1867, upon the creation of Canada and the province of Quebec. == Boundaries == Yamaska electoral district was located in a rural area on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River (now in an area contained in Nicolet- Yamaska Regional County Municipality). The Saint Fran\u00e7ois River ran north through the district, flowing into the Saint Lawrence. The Union Act, 1840 merged the two provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada, with a single Parliament. The separate parliaments of Lower Canada and Upper Canada were abolished.Union Act, 1840, 3 & 4 Vict., c. 35, s. 2. The Union Act provided that the pre-existing electoral boundaries of Lower Canada and Upper Canada would continue to be used in the new Parliament, unless altered by the Union Act itself.Union Act, 1840, s. 18. The Lower Canada electoral district of Yamaska was not altered by the Act. It was therefore continued with the same boundaries in the new Parliament. Those boundaries had been set by a statute of Lower Canada in 1829: == Members of the Legislative Assembly == Yamaska was represented by one member in the Legislative Assembly.
