    "text": "In topology, a subject in mathematics, a graph is a topological space which arises from a usual graph G = (E, V) by replacing vertices by points and each edge e = xy \\in E by a copy of the unit interval I = [0,1], where 0 is identified with the point associated to x and 1 with the point associated to y. That is, as topological spaces, graphs are exactly the simplicial 1-complexes and also exactly the one-dimensional CW complexes. Thus, in particular, it bears the quotient topology of the set :X_0 \\sqcup \\bigsqcup_{e \\in E} I_e under the quotient map used for gluing. Here X_0 is the 0-skeleton (consisting of one point for each vertex x \\in V), I_e are the intervals (\"closed one-dimensional unit balls\") glued to it, one for each edge e \\in E, and \\sqcup is the disjoint union. The topology on this space is called the graph topology. == Subgraphs and -trees == A subgraph of a graph X is a subspace Y \\subseteq X which is also a graph and whose nodes are all contained in the 0-skeleton of X. Y is a subgraph if and only if it consists of vertices and edges from X and is closed. A subgraph T \\subseteq X is called a tree iff it is contractible as a topological space. == Properties == * Every connected graph X contains at least one maximal tree T \\subseteq X, that is, a tree that is maximal with respect to the order induced by set inclusion on the subgraphs of X which are trees. * If X is a graph and T \\subseteq X a maximal tree, then the fundamental group \\pi_1(X) equals the free group generated by elements (f_\\alpha)_{\\alpha \\in A}, where the \\\\{f_\\alpha\\\\} correspond bijectively to the edges of X \\setminus T; in fact, X is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles. * Forming the topological space associated to a graph as above amounts to a functor from the category of graphs to the category of topological spaces. * The associated topological space of a graph is connected (with respect to the graph topology) if and only if the original graph is connected. * Every covering space projecting to a graph is also a graph. == Applications == Using the above properties of graphs, one can prove the Nielsen\u2013Schreier theorem. == See also == *Graph homology *Topological graph theory == References == Category:Topological spaces ",
