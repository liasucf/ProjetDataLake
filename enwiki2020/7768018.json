    "text": "A Night at Birdland Vol. 2 is a 1954 release by jazz drummer Art Blakey, and a quintet which featured Clifford Brown, Lou Donaldson, Horace Silver and Curley Russell. It was first released by Blue Note Records as a 10\" LP (BLP 5038). Two years later, the three 10\" LPs in the set were reissued as 2 12\" LPs; the 12\" Vol. 2 is BLP 1521. Two of the three tracks (\"Mayreh\" and \"A Night in Tunisia\") of the original 10\" Vol. 2 were included in the 12\" Vol. 1. The 12\" Vol. 2 incorporates all three tracks from the 10\" A Night at Birdland Vol. 3 plus a previously unreleased alternate take of \"Quicksilver.\" A Night at Birdland Vol. 2 was reissued for the first time on CD in 1987 with two additional tracks (\"The Way You Look Tonight\" and \"Lou's Blues\"). \"The Way You Look Tonight\" had been previously released on a 2 LP Compilation in 1975 called Live Messengers (BN-LA473-J2). The CD was reissued again in 2001 as an \"RVG Edition\" remastered by Rudy Van Gelder with the tracks in a different order. The 1987 CD used the second 12\" LP cover, the 2001 CD revived the original 10\" LP cover. All of the music surfaced as part of a Clifford Brown box set for Mosaic Records (MR5-104) and a complete Clifford Brown set put out by Capitol has also appeared. The recording was produced by Alfred Lion and engineered by Rudy Van Gelder for Blue Note. ==Track listing== === 10\" LP === === 12\" LP === == CD Reissues == ==Personnel== Art Blakey Quintet: *Art Blakey \u2014 drums *Clifford Brown \u2014 trumpet *Lou Donaldson \u2014 alto saxophone *Horace Silver \u2014 piano *Curley Russell \u2014 bass Production: *Bob Bluementhal, Leonard Feather \u2014 liner notes *Michael Cuscuna \u2014 reissue producer *John Hermansader, Reid Miles \u2014 cover design *Alfred Lion \u2014 producer *Ron McMaster \u2014 digital transfers *Rudy Van Gelder \u2014 engineer, mastering *Francis Wolff \u2014 photography ==Reception== The two albums that were released from the Birdland are considered by The Penguin Guide to Jazz to be part of their \"core collection\".
