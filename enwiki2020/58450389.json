In his role as Mayor, Aldworth received Edward VI when he visited the town on 12 September 1552. Thomas Aldworth is likely to be the son of Robert Aldworth, a tanner of Wantage, then also in Berkshire. Thomas had houses and property in Reading, a house in Wantage that he inherited from his father, and property elsewhere in Berkshire, together with a house on Watling Street in London. Other members of the Aldworth family continued to represent Reading in parliament, including Richard Aldworth in 1661, Richard Neville Aldworth Neville in 1747, and Richard Aldworth-Neville in 1782. In 1797, Richard Aldworth-Neville succeeded to the Barony of Braybrooke. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Reading, Berkshire Category:Mayors of places in Berkshire Category:Members of the Parliament of England (pre-1707) for Reading Category:English MPs 1558 Category:English MPs 1559 ",
