    "text": "\"Alone\" is a song by American singer Halsey from her second studio album Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (2017). A remixed version of the song featuring American rapper Big Sean and British rapper Stefflon Don was released on March 15, 2018 through Astralwerks as the third and final single from the album. ==Background== \"Alone\" contains a sample from \"Nothing Can Stop Me\", written by Tony Hester and recorded by Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr.. \"Alone\" follows \"kinda like this Gatsby vibe,\" as stated by Halsey. It's about a social butterfly at the house party (which is a parallel to the masquerade ball in Romeo and Juilet) referenced in \"Heaven In Hiding\" and \"Strangers\". It is the second character's perspective of this party, with \"Heaven In Hiding\" acting as the first character's perspective. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Halsey with Hannah Lux Davis and released on April 6, 2018, it starts with Halsey walking on a street going to a masquerade ball, she starts dancing before noticing her former lover on the balcony hanging with another woman while various flashbacks from the \"Now or Never\" music video are shown. She starts getting confused and runs to a fountain to vomit and Big Sean's character is there to console her and Stefflon Don is shown rapping her verse and wearing a red dress. The video ends with Halsey celebrating her happiness as confetti falls down, with her former lover staring at her confused by a note she left for him. ==Live performances== Halsey performed \"Alone\" live on Sounds Like Friday Night on April 6, 2018. This was also her first UK television performance. In May, she performed the song on The Voice. ==Track listings== *Digital download #\"Alone\" \u2013 3:27 *Digital download \u2013 Calvin Harris Remix #\"Alone\" \u2013 3:19 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 8 |- |- |- |- |- |} Calvin Harris remix {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ukraine Airplay (Tophit) | 25 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) | 20 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | March 15, 2017 | rowspan=\"2\"| Digital download | Original | rowspan=\"2\"| | align=\"center\"| |- | April 20, 2017 | Calvin Harris Remix | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy | May 4, 2018 | Contemporary hit radio | Original | Universal | |- |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2017 songs Category:Astralwerks singles Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number-one singles Category:Halsey (singer) songs Category:Music videos directed by Hannah Lux Davis Category:Songs written by Ricky Reed Category:Songs written by Halsey (singer) Category:Big Sean songs Category:Stefflon Don songs Category:Songs written by Big Sean Category:Songs written by Dan Wilson (musician) Category:Songs written by Stefflon Don Category:Song recordings produced by Louis Bell ",
