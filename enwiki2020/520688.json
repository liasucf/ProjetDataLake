At the 2016 Census, Research had a population of 2,649. ==History== Settled in the 1850s, Research was the location of extensive orchards by the 1860s. The unusual name arose from the gold rush era in Victoria, during the mid 19th century. Research was then known as Swiper's Gully, but gold was found after the area was re-searched. Swiper's Gully then became Research Gully, and finally, late in the 19th century, abbreviated to Research. Research Post Office opened on 20 October 1902. ==Community== Much of Research today consists of 1 to 35 acre blocks. This area has one of the highest bushfire risks in Australia, due to prolific Eucalyptus and Melaleuca Paperbark trees.
