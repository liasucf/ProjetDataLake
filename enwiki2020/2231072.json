Before the battle the Swedish army was in retreat after the campaign of the previous summer. The main Swedish force was retreating from Vaasa to Nykarleby. The Russians sent a force to cut off the Swedish retreat. In response the Swedes sent a force under Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln to intercept them. The battle ended in a Swedish victory, but the main Swedish army was beaten in the Battle of Oravais the very next day. The battle is described in Johan Ludvig Runeberg's epic poem D\u00f6beln at Jutas. ==Citations and sources== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * Jutas Jutas 1808 Jutas Category:Nykarleby Jutas Jutas Category:History of Ostrobothnia (region) Category:September 1808 events ",
