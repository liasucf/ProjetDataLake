    "text": "The Sadberk Han\u0131m Museum () is a private museum located at the Bosporus in B\u00fcy\u00fckdere quarter of Sar\u0131yer district in Istanbul, Turkey, which was established by the Vehbi Ko\u00e7 Foundation in memory of Vehbi Ko\u00e7\u2019s deceased wife Sadberk. The museum is open every day except Wednesdays. ==Buildings== The museum occupies two separate buildings of charming 19th century wooden villas. The original building is a three-story plus an attic wooden mansion and whose architecture was inspired by European vernacular traditions. The building, constructed of wood and lathe-and-plaster on a masonry foundation, was known as the \"Azeryan Yal\u0131s\u0131\" (Azarian waterside mansion) and belonged to the wealthy Azarian family, Armenian Catholics from Sivas.http://www.maggieblanck.com/Azarian/Azarian.html The building was purchased by the Ko\u00e7 family in 1950, and was used by them as a summerhouse until the decision to convert it into a museum was taken in 1978. The conversion into a museum was carried out between 1978 and 1980 according to a restoration project that had been prepared by Sedat Hakk\u0131 Eldem. It opened its doors to the public on October 14, 1980 with the Sadberk Ko\u00e7 collection on display. The Azeryan Yal\u0131 occupies of space set in grounds measuring a total of in all. On the ground floor is a gift shop and a small tea room. The ceiling over the main entrance, which is no longer used, is decorated with plaster moldings inspired by ancient Roman architecture. Wooden stairways lead to the upper floors. The walls are painted so as to resemble veined marble. The centrally located main halls of the second and third floors and the rooms opening onto them are used for display purposes. The attic is used for storage and also contains offices and a library. The crossed wooden moldings decorating the exterior give the building a distinctive appearance quite different from that of its neighbors. It is because of these molded facades that the building was for a long time popularly known as the \"Threaded Yal\u0131\". In 1983, the Vehbi Ko\u00e7 Foundation purchased the H\u00fcseyin Kocaba\u015f collection for the Sadberk Han\u0131m Museum. It was decided to purchase and restore a semi- dilapidated yal\u0131 adjacent to it to house these new acquisitions. The facade of this second yali, which is thought to have been constructed in the early part of this century, was faithfully reconstructed according to the original. The restoration project was prepared by \u0130brahim Yal\u00e7\u0131n and the work, including the construction of the museum, took two years to complete. This museum, which was opened on October 24, 1988, was given the name the \"Sevgi G\u00f6n\u00fcl Wing\" after the daughter of Sadberk. It houses works from the pre-Islamic period. In 1988 it was awarded the Europa Nostra prize as an outstanding example of modern museum architecture and design. This wing is completely constructed of reinforced concrete. The front is clad in wood while the side is clad in marble stucco treated to resemble wood. This was done as a precaution against fire. The building has three stories in the front and four at the back, including the ground floor on which are located a multi-purpose hall and conservation laboratory. Archaeological objects are displayed in chronological order on the main and other floors. The total exhibition space is . The entrance floor is paved in white Afyon marble while black Adapazar\u0131 marble was used for the floors of the exhibition spaces and the stairs. All the exhibition areas are sealed off from daylight and the display cases are illuminated in keeping with modern museum techniques. ==Exhibits== ===Archeological section (Sevgi G\u00f6n\u00fcl Wing)=== ===Art history section (Azaryan Yal\u0131s\u0131)=== Islamic denomination in the style of a Mamluk tughra by Es-Seyid Mehmed Nuri ==References== ==External links== * Sadberk Hanim Museum Category:Art museums and galleries in Istanbul Category:Bosphorus Category:Museums established in 1980 Category:Archaeological museums in Turkey Category:Historic house museums in Turkey Category:Ethnographic museums in Turkey Category:Ko\u00e7 family Category:1980 establishments in Turkey Category:Former private collections ",
