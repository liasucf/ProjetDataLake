    "text": "Robert Frodeman is former Professor and former Chair, Dept of Philosophy and Religion, University of North Texas, previously at the University of Colorado, and Director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity. A student of Alphonso Lingis and Stanley Rosen, Frodeman works in the areas of environmental ethics and environmental philosophy, the philosophy of geology, the philosophy of science policy, and the philosophy of interdisciplinarity, and has written an extensive body of peer-reviewed academic work in these areas. Throughout his work he emphasizes the role that philosophy can play in addressing ongoing societal controversies such as acid mine drainage, global climate change, and Hurricane Katrina. His most recent work focuses on the use and abuse of knowledge for social amelioration, a topic that has come to be known as critical university studies. Frodeman is also part of a growing movement known as 'field philosophy' where philosophers emphasize working with scientists, engineers, and policy makers rather than an extensive focus on writing and working with other philosophers (e.g., Brister and Frodeman, 2020). In the fall of 2008 Frodeman became founding director of UNT's Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity (CSID). CSID focused on identifying best practices for interdisciplinary research and education, and views the last 100 years of disciplinarity across the academy as breaking down under the pressure of complex problems and the overproduction of knowledge. Frodeman is also the editor of the Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity (2010), second edition 2017. ==Biography== Frodeman attended St. Louis University, where he gained degrees in History and Philosophy, Pennsylvania State University, where he obtained a Ph.D. in Philosophy, studying with Stanley Rosen and Alphonso Lingis, and the University of Colorado, where he then obtained a M.S. degree in Geology. In the 1990s he consulted for the US Geological Survey on questions of science policy. His research focuses on environmental philosophy and public policy and the theory and practice of interdisciplinary research and education. The UNT PhD program in Philosophy that he directed emphasizes 'field' approaches to philosophy where philosophers work with scientists, engineers, and policy makers. He has written more than 100 articles, has authored or edited 16 books. From 2001 he directed the interdisciplinary project New Directions: Science, Humanities, Policy \u2014absorbed by CSID in 2008. CSID was closed in 2014.
