    "text": "Civil procedure in Australia are the rules of civil procedure that govern procedure in the various courts and tribunals established by the Commonwealth, states and territories. These rules are historically derived from, and continues to resemble, the civil procedure in England and Wales. The rules vary to some extent between the different courts and tribunals within federal and state jurisdictions. ==History== Before Federation, each Australian colony had a two- or three-tiered judicial system with a Supreme Court at its apex. [53]. The Supreme Courts followed the model of the Supreme Court of Judicature, as the High Court of Justice was known from the 1870s (when it was established by the Judicature Acts). Civil procedure in these courts was governed by rules made by the judges and known as the Rules of the Supreme Court. ===State implementations of the Rules of the Supreme Court=== * Rules of the Supreme Court (Qld) (repealed) * (current, but substantially repealed) * (current) ==Current civil procedure legislation== Most states have now codified the rules of civil procedure as delegated legislation, sometimes known as Uniform Civil Procedure Rules. The Chief Justice of the relevant Supreme Court is generally the chair of a rules committee with the power to amend the rules.; . However, the title and structure of the relevant civil procedure rules is not uniform across jurisdictions. For example, the and are quite different. In Queensland, the rules were intended to be \"uniform, so far as practicable, for all three courts in the State stream\" \u2013 that is, to unify the procedure of the Supreme, District and Magistrates Court, not participate in a cooperative federalism effort like the Uniform Evidence Acts. The following legislation currently governs civil procedure in each jurisdiction. ===Commonwealth=== * * * * * ===New South Wales=== * * * * * ===Queensland=== * * * Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (UCPR) 1999 (Qld) ===South Australia=== * * Supreme Court Civil Rules 2006 (SA) * * District Court Civil Rules 2006 (SA) * * Magistrates Court (Civil) Rules 2013 (SA) ===Tasmania=== * * ===Victoria=== * * * * ===Western Australia=== * * * * * ===Australian Capital Territory=== * ===Northern Territory=== * * ==See also== * Civil procedure * Judiciary of Australia * Primary and secondary legislation * Lawsuit * Summons * Subpoena * Interlocutory injunction * Summary judgment * Judgment (law) ==References== Category:Australian law ",
