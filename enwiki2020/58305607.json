He was a member of the team that won the multi-million dollar International 2018 and 2019 tournaments. == History == While initially playing Dota 2 in Australia, ana made the decision to move from his city, Melbourne to Shanghai in December 2015 to continue his pursuit in becoming a professional Dota player, where he joined the CDEC in-house league allowing him to compete against highly-rated Chinese players. The invitation to play in China saw him drop out of his high school, where his mother was half-supportive at first, however with Anathan's brother convincing her. Ana began his professional Dota 2 career by joining Invictus Gaming in March 2016 as a substitute for Ferrari_430. His most notable accomplishment with the team was defeating Newbee in the grand finals of NEA 2016. Following The International 2016, ana left the team to join OG. In November, he won his first ever tournament with OG at Elimination Mode Season 2 and later won his first major event by defeating Ad Finem 3-1 in the grand finals of Boston Major. The team's performance continued to stay consistent with additional top 4 performances at Dota Pit League Season 5, StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3, and Dota 2 Asia Championships 2017. Ana would then take his second major at Kiev Major, and the team was invited for The International 2017. OG's had a rough series of tournaments leading up to the International with early eliminations at The Manila Masters and EPICENTER 2017, however, they did finish fourth at Mars Dota 2 League 2017. During The International 2017, the team failed to make it to the upper bracket, and finished 7-8th, falling at the hands of LGD Gaming. Following their loss, ana announced that he would be taking a break from the professional scene. Months later, he later joined Echo International in early 2018, but had returned to OG in early June 2018 following the departure of Fly and s4. Despite a bad start at The International 2018's group stage, OG finished fourth and were seeded into the upper bracket of the main event. Considered underdogs during their entire time at the event, OG and ana advanced to the grand finals and won the tournament by defeating PSG.LGD in the best-of-five series 3\u20132. Following that, he decided to take a break from professional Dota, but returned to the team in March 2019. Later that year, he won The International 2019, making him and the rest of the team the first repeat winners of The International. Following that, he announced another hiatus from the team. == References == * 50px Content in this article was copied from ana at Liquipedia Dota 2, which is licensed under the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 United States (CC BY-SA 3.0 US) license. ==External links== * Category:1999 births Category:Australian esports players Category:Australian people of Vietnamese descent Category:Dota players Category:Living people Category:OG (esports) players Category:Sportspeople from Melbourne ",
