Denoff began his entertainment career in 1977 as the Assistant to the Producers of the original long-running CBS television series Hawaii Five-O, ultimately working as the Associate Producer overseeing post- production. In 1980 he worked as the line producer of the ABC Television film \"A Time For Miracles\" and then secured the rights to a front-page story that was to become an NBC Movie. The 1981 Writers' Guild strike put all productions on hold for over one year. While working from home in the era before call- waiting and needing multiple phone lines, he salvaged an unused multi-line phone system for his own use. Months later, he was asked if he could install a similar system for another businessman, and subsequently formed one of the early telephone interconnect companies, Dencom Systems, Inc.; installing business phone systems for commercial clients in the Los Angeles area. The company gained prominence by guaranteeing 1-hour emergency service response 24 hours a day. It assumed the service contracts of a number of much larger competitors who left the industry. Recognized several times by Inc. Magazine as one of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the US, Dencom grew to over 20 employees in Santa Monica. In 1992, Denoff learned that long-distance services could be re-sold and formed an affiliated company, Fibernet, Inc. to resell the long-distance services of major carriers and provide clear, integrated monthly statements. By offering discounts on the telephone systems to Dencom customers in return for term contracts on the monthly long-distance services, Fibernet quickly became a flourishing business. In 2003, however, Denoff began to downsize the companies in preparation for his long-desired relocation back to New York City, and a return to a creative career. ==Personal life== Denoff resides in New York City and is a Member of The Broadway League (www.broadwayleague.com ), The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and The Recording Academy. Denoff is the son of television writer/producer Sam Denoff and his first wife Bernice Levey.

He was born in New York City attended nursery school at the Hunter College Elementary School. His family moved to Los Angeles at the age of 4 1/2.
