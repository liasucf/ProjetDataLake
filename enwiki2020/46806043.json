It was created in 2014 and is responsible for developing, fostering and regulating a sustainable and world-class space sector in the UAE. The agency is charged with the growth of the sector through partnerships, academic programmes and investments in R&D;, commercial initiatives, and driving space science research and exploration. ==History== The UAE proposed in 2008 to establish a Pan-Arab Space Agency, as a civilian project like the European Space Agency (ESA). The Arab Science and Technology Foundation said an agency for the Middle East and North Africa already had unofficial support from some governments and hoped that a regional organisation for disseminating satellite images could form an early foundation. The agency would monitor security and environmental changes with equatorial satellites. It would not develop its own launch capability, as that was commercially available.Call for pan-Arab space agency, The National 27 October 2008 The proposed regional agency would reduce the cost of putting satellites into orbit and pool talent and research. Plans were submitted to the region's governments and pushed for at the Global Space Technology Forum in December 2009. The UAE had already launched satellites and established an Earth Observation Space Center in Abu Dhabi.UAE develops space industry, itweb 15 April 2009UAE pioneering pan Arab space agency , The Hindu 17 April 2009Abu Dhabi Forum Could Boost Plans for Pan-Arab Space Agency, Khaleej Times 5 December 2009 However, little progress to establish the regional agency was made after the proposal. The United Arab Emirates Space Agency was then established in 2014 by presidential decree. In 2015, it formed a partnership with the Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales of France, as well as with the UK Space Agency. ==Budget== The space agency has gathered about $5.2 billion of funding from government, private, and semi-private entities.https://slate.com/technology/2017/03/why-the-united-arab-emirates-is- building-a-space-program.html. == Strategic programme == The Agency's strategic goals were announced in May 2015 and include: * Develop and guide a world-class national space sector that supports sustainable development. * Promote scientific research and innovation to support progress in space sciences and technologies. * Attract and promote young Emiratis to become space scientists and technology pioneers. * Build and enhance international co-operation and partnership to provide administrative services with high quality standards and transparency. == UAE Space Agency initiatives == The Agency is involved in directing, investing in, and promoting a number of initiatives. The UAE has launched prior to the existence of the Agency commercial satellites constructed by EADS (YahSat 1A and 1B), Boeing (Thuraya 1, 2 and 3) and MBRSC DubaiSat-1 and DubaiSat-2, developed as part of a technology transfer programme with South Korea's Satrec Initiative, resulting in an existing space sector investment of some $5.5 billion. === Space Science Research Centre, Al-Ain === The $27 million Al-Ain based Space Research Centre was announced on 25 May 2015. The Centre is intended as an incubator for space research, development, and innovation. It will be involved in co-ordinating with a number of agencies, including the Emirates Mobile Observatory. === Emirates Mars Mission === The Emirates Mars Mission is being undertaken by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, a Government of Dubai entity. It is preparing for the Mars Hope mission to Mars in 2020 in order to create the first holistic diurnal picture of Mars' atmosphere with three science instruments mounted on an orbiter which is aimed to reach Mars orbit in early 2021. The Centre employs 75 people which the UAE government hopes to double by 2020. === Rashid moon mission === On September 29, 2020, Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the UAE\u2019s unmanned mission to moon in 2024, as the country was seeking to expand its space sector. Sheikh Mohammed also said that the rover named \"Rashid\", after his father who is credited with modernizing Dubai, will cover \"areas not yet reached in previous exploration missions\". === Graduate degree programme in Advanced Space Science === In May 2015, an MoU was signed by Al Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat), the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology and Orbital ATK Inc to create a Degree Programme in Advanced Space Science, the first such course of study in the Middle East. These three entities, with co-ordination and oversight from the UAE Space Agency, will launch the academic programme at Masdar Institute. ===Space tourism=== The space agency is working to bring space tourism to UAE from Al Ain International Airport serving as a potential space port for the agency.explore utilizing Al Ain International Airport as a potential space port ==See also== * List of government space agencies ==References== Category:Space program of the United Arab Emirates Category:Space agencies Category:2014 establishments in the United Arab Emirates Category:Government agencies established in 2014 ",
