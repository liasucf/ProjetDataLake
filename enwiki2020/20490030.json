    "text": "The Boma tribe (Bumo) of the Ijaw people live in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. The thirteen Bumo settlements are: Diebu, Ekowe, Emette, Eniwari, Fonibiri, Igbematoru, Ikianbiri, Kainyanbiri, Ozezebiri , Peremabiri, Polobugo and Seibiri (also known as Opuama). Other than the clan headship which currently resides with the king of Ekowe, there are no common cultural institutions within the Boma tribe, nor do they worship a common clan god. Their Boma identity derives from their tradition of common origin and a common dialect of Ijo. Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005).
