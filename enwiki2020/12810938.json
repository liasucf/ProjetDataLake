    "text": "Route 8 sign near Harlech, North Wales The route passes through the heart of Wales, and is also known by its Welsh name L\u00f4n Las Cymru (English: Wales' Blue Lane). It is largely north-south from Holyhead to Cardiff or Chepstow, and in total measures some in length. Some of its route follows the trackbed of former railway lines, such as L\u00f4n Las Menai, L\u00f4n Eifion, the Mawddach Trail and the Taff Trail; in other places, the route is on public highways. Both ends are easily accessible via the rail network. It is possibly better done North to South, finishing in Cardiff, the capital city. ==Route== ===Cardiff to Brecon=== This largely follows the Taff Trail: Cardiff | Pontypridd | Abercynon | Merthyr Tydfil | Brecon ===Alternative: Chepstow to Glasbury=== Lon Las Cymru provides an alternative south route for those coming into Wales from the Severn Bridge, following Route 42 from Chepstow to Glasbury, where it joins Route 8: Chepstow | Usk | Abergavenny | Glasbury There is also a small loop at the top of Route 42 providing links to Hay-on-Wye. ===Brecon to Machynlleth=== Brecon | Talgarth | Glasbury | Erwood | Builth Wells | Newbridge on Wye | Llanwrthwl | Rhayader | Llangurig | Llanidloes | Staylittle | Machynlleth ===Machynlleth to Porthmadog=== Machynlleth | Dolgellau | Trawsfynydd | Penrhyndeudraeth | Porthmadog ===Porthmadog to Holyhead=== Porthmadog | Penygroes | Caernarfon | Bangor | Holyhead ==External links== * Sustrans map and description - north section * Sustrans map and description - south section * Sustrans Routes2Ride: Cycling L\u00f4n Las Cymru * Wales Trails * A map of the route Category:National Cycle Routes Category:Cycleways in Wales Category:Transport in Anglesey Category:Transport in Gwynedd Category:Cycleways in Powys Category:Transport in Merthyr Tydfil Category:Transport in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Transport in Cardiff Category:Transport in Monmouthshire Category:Elenydd Category:Brecon Beacons ",
