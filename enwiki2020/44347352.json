Marc Navarro won the fight but the fight became notable for the amount of blood the fighters were left fighting in and slipping in during the final round of the cage fight. Under professional fighting rules the fight does not have to be stopped unless the fighters have cuts above their eyes. During the fight the fighters become covered in blood predominately coming from Marc Navarros nose. Marc Navarro was awarded the win and the Swedish team entered a complaint that the blood should have been cleared from the fight cage. Jimmy Justice Millar from Justice TV in the UK re-cut the fight to the Rocky Soundtrack and posted it on YouTube. http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/internet-gives-new-vu-of-life-in- the-city-1.110461 http://dundee.stv.tv/7346/ http://www.wtka- sweden.se/wtka_news/510/micke-foll-efter-stenhard-match/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80evV28wRjc http://www.livestream.com/thedundeechannel ==References== Category:Internet television channels Category:Mass media in Dundee ",
