    "text": "Snipex T-Rex is a single-shot large-caliber anti-materiel rifle chambered for the 14.5\u00d7114mm cartridge and manufactured by XADO-Holding Ltd., Kharkiv, Ukraine. ==Design== This is a classic non-automatic bolt-action rifle with the lowest possible weight intended for severe operating conditions. During loading, the cartridge is inserted into the breech opening with the bolt open. Barrel locking is achieved through a rotating bolt. The rifle has the bullpup design, where the bolt carrier group is located behind the trigger. The rifle is designed taking into account all the requirements for weapons for high- precision shooting. The floating barrel is in free recoil when the bullet flies out. The rifle demonstrates an acceptable level of recoil during shooting. Recoil is suppressed due to the muzzle brake, the effect of a recoil isolator, an elastic multilayer shoulder pad, and optimally balanced weight. The rifle is suitable for shooting resting both on the right and left shoulders. It has a height-adjustable cheek rest that can be installed on the right or on the left side. The rifle has a bipod and an adjustable rear support, which allows for precise adjustment to the shooter's needs. The rifle has a Picatinny rail with 50 MOA gradient, on which various sighting devices can be mounted. ==Specifications== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Caliber, mm || 14.5 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Cartridge || 14.5\u00d7114mm |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Mass, kg || 22.5 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Overall length (assembled), mm || 1,830 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Barrel length, mm || 1,200 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Rifling || 8/17\" |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Safety || safety button, safety sear |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Picatinny rail || top Mil Standard |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Muzzle velocity, m/s || 1,000 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Effective range, m || 3,000 |- | style=\"background:#eaecf0;\" | Maximum range, m || 7,000 |} ==History== The first development was presented at the XIV International Specialized Exhibition \u201cArms and Security 2017\u201d.
