The piece is inspired by the paintings of the Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo.Stucky, Steven. Pinturas de Tamayo (Paintings of Tamayo, 1995) for orchestra: Program Note by the Composer. Retrieved July 11, 2015. ==Composition== ===Inspiration=== Stucky recalled his first encounter with the works of the painter Rufino Tamayo in the score program notes, writing: He continued: ===Structure=== The work has a duration of roughly 22 minutes and is composed in five movements named after Tamayo paintings: #Amigas de los p\u00e1jaros (Friends of the Birds): Vivo #Anochecer (Sunset): Calmo #Mujeres alcanzando la luna (Women Reaching for the Moon): Moderato #M\u00fasicas dormidas (Sleeping Musicians): Adagio #La gran galaxia (The Great Galaxy): Tranquillo ==Reception== Reviewing the world premiere, John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune felt that the work did not live up to Tamayo's art and wrote: Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times received the piece in a more positive light, however, writing, \"Tamayo makes a visual splash, and Stucky responds with a colorful orchestral equivalent.\" Richard Whitehouse of Gramophone similarly remarked, \"Pinturas de Tamayo (1995) draws on the more tangible imagery of Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo, but the music for the most part is hardly less understated \u2013 witness the luminous poise of 'Sunset' or the rapt introspection of 'The Great Galaxy' which makes for an unusually thoughtful apotheosis.\" ==Discography== A recording of Pinturas de Tamayo, performed by Evelyn Glennie and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Lan Shui, was released April 27, 2010 through BIS Records and features Stucky's other orchestral works Spirit Voices and the Concerto for Orchestra No. 2. ==References== Category:Compositions by Steven Stucky Category:1995 compositions Category:Orchestral suites Category:Music based on art Category:Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ",
