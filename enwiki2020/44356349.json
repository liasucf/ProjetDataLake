Olympic '64 had its roots in a band called Pioneers, which was founded in 1961 by pupils from the \u201eMihai Viteazul\u201d High School in Bucharest. Among the members were: Dimitrie William Piki Inglessis (guitar), Lukis Viratsonis (guitar), Mihai Teodorescu (piano), Antheos (double bass), and Titel T\u0103\u021bulescu (drums). In the first years, Cornel Guri\u021b\u0103 also collaborated as a vocalist and guitarist, but later Dorin Liviu Zaharia became their main vocalist. Before they appeared on TV for the first time, on October 9, 1964, producer Valeriu Lazarov suggested that they change their name into Olympic '64, as it was around the time of the opening of the Tokyo Summer Olympics.Doru Ionescu, Timpul chitarelor electrice, Humanitas Educational, Bucure\u0219ti, 2005, p. 77 In the summers they used to play for three months at the Perla restaurant in Mamaia, while in the winters they used to play at the Mon Jardin restaurant in Bucure\u0219ti.
