    "text": "The Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland is an advisory non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government responsible for making recommendations on appointments to certain offices of the judiciary of Scotland. It was established in June 2002 on a non-statutory, ad hoc, basis by the Scottish Government, and was given statutory authority by the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008. All recommendations are made to the First Minister, who must consult the Lord President of the Court of Session before making a recommendation to the monarch in relation to full-time, permanent, judiciary, or before any appointments are made by Scottish Ministers to temporary or part-time judicial office. The board does not make recommendations for, or have any in role in the appointment of, justices of the peace, whose appointments are made by Scottish Ministers on the recommendation of Justice of the Peace Advisory Committees for each sheriffdom. ==History== The Judicial Appointments Board was established in June 2002 on a non-statutory, ad hoc, basis by the Scottish Government, and was given statutory authority by the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008. The board was established on a statutory basis following criticism of its perceived lack of independence from political interference by the executive, and following the Scottish Government's consultation Strengthening Judicial Independence in a Modern Scotland. In 2002 the board initially had equal numbers of lay and legally qualified members: 5 lay members, 3 judicial members, and 2 members from the legal profession (advocate and solicitors). The method of creating the board and appointing members was not without criticism. The Law Society of Scotland in its members' magazine Journal was critical that the appointments process did not follow procedures recommended by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, and the chair of the board is a lay member, a situation said to be \"unique in Europe\", where the norm is for self-governing bodies to control judicial appointments.Criticism of the Judicial Appointments Board on the ground that it lacks any real authority: In 2006 Sir Neil McIntosh, chair of the board, was critical that the Scottish Executive did not put the board on a statutory footing, as is the case for the Judicial Appointments Commission in England. The board continues to be chaired by a lay member, who is appointed to the position by the Scottish Ministers. The chairing member is appointed for a maximum of 4 years, and may be reappointed. ==Process== All recommendations are made to the First Minister, who must consult the Lord President of the Court of Session before making his or her recommendation to the monarch in relation to full-time judiciary. Appointments to the offices of temporary sheriff principal, part-time sheriffs and part-time summary sheriffs are made by the Scottish Ministers. ==Board members== The board has 12 members, with 4 judicial members appointed by the Lord President, and 2 legal members and 6 lay members appointed by the Scottish Ministers. Judicial members include 2 appointed from the Court of Session (but may not be either the Lord President or Lord Justice Clerk), a sheriff principal, and a sheriff. The legal members include an advocate and a solicitor. As of February 2019, current board members were: *Chairing member: Mrs Nicola Gordon *Lay member: Alison Mitchell *Lay member: Deirdre Fulton *Lay member: Professor Stephen Tierney *Lay member: Ms Neelam Bakshi *Judicial member: The Hon Lady Wise, Senator *Judicial member: Sheriff Principal Marysia Lewis *Judicial member: Sheriff Michael O'Grady QC *Judicial member: Lord Minginish, Chairman of the Scottish Land Court *Legal member: Ms Morag Ross, Advocate *Legal member: Ms Eilidh Wiseman, Solicitor ===Chairing members=== Chairing members are always lay members of the board, and are appointed for a period of 4 years (up to a maximum of 8 years).
