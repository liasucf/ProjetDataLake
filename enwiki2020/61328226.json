In 1760 he became a monk and settled in the Rakovac Monastery, located in Srem, where he wrote that he was an artist and icon painter and that in 1760 he received 6 ducats in prize money for his work. He learned his art under the tutelage of Baroque painter Jov Vasiljevi\u010d who was the court painter of Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanovi\u0107 \u0160akabenta.In the church in Kamenica he painted in 1760, the Annunciation, Christ and the Mother of God, the Coronation of the Mother of God, and the Hymn of the Mother of God: O Tebje Raduljetsja. Afterward, he worked at Vukovar and Rakovica Monastery, his most important work. It is known that in late 1771 he started painting in the dining room of the Vrdnik Monastery on the theme of the Battle of Kosovo, which he painted and finished in 1776 after more than four years of work. It is one of the most interesting works of the last of monk-painters, of this new style. Stylistically Ambrozije Jankovi\u0107's frescoes have both the elements of medieval and Baroque painting, giving him an honored place in the line of great Serbian artists Jakov Orfelin, Zaharije Orfelin, Teodor Kra\u010dun, Teodor Ili\u0107 \u010ce\u0161ljar and other academy-educated painters of that time. ==See also== * List of painters from Serbia == References == Category:Serbian painters Category:1730s births Category:Year of death missing ",
