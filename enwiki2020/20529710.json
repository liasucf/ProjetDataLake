    "text": "The Kaingang language (also spelled Kaing\u00e1ng) is a Southern J\u00ea language (J\u00ea, Macro-J\u00ea) spoken by the Kaingang people of southern Brazil. The Kaingang nation has about 30,000 people, and about from 60% to 65% speak the language. Most also speak Portuguese. ==Overview== The Kaingang language is classified as a member of the J\u00ea family, the largest language family in the Macro-J\u00ea stock. The Kaingang territory occupies the modern states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (and, until the beginning of the 20th century, Misiones, Argentina). Today they live in around 30 indigenous lands (similar to Native American reservations), especially at Rio Grande do Sul and Paran\u00e1. In the 1960s, because of a missionary interest (conducted by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL)), the language was studied by Ursula Wiesemann. ==Names== The Kaingang and Xokleng were previously considered a single ethnicity, which went by a number of names, including Amh\u00f3, Dorin, Gualachi, Chiqui, Ingain, Botocudo, Ivitoroc\u00e1i (= Amho), Kam\u00e9, Kayurukr\u00e9, Tain (= Ingain), Taven. Some of these may have been tribal names; others were exonyms. Those living along the coast at the time of the Conquest were called Guayan\u00e1, and are considered to be the ancestors of the Kaingang.Enciclop\u00e9dia dos Povos Ind\u00edgenas no Brasil - Instituto Socioambiental It is unknown to what extent the names might have corresponded to dialectal differences. ==Dialects== ===Loukotka (1968)=== Loukotka (1968) lists the following dialects of Kaing\u00e1n and related language varieties. *Kaing\u00e1n / Caingang / Cam\u00e9 / Taven / Kaingygn / Coroado / Kadyrukr\u00e9 **Central - spoken between the Iva\u00ed River and Tiqui\u00e9 River, Paran\u00e1 State **Southern or I\u00f1acor\u00e9 - spoken in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, now in the villages surrounding the cities of Nonohag and C\u00e1ceres. **Northern - once spoken on the Tiete River **Eastern / Nhakf\u00e1teitei / Yakw\u00e4ndat\u00e9ye / Guayana de Paranapamena - formerly spoken in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo on the Paranapanema River *Binar\u00e9 - once spoken on the left shore of the Uruguay River in the state of Rio Grande do Sul *Xiqui - extinct language from Mato Grosso State, once spoken on the S\u00e3o Francisco River and Piquir\u00ed River *Aweicoma / Bugres / Owaikom\u00e1ng / Xocren - spoken in Santa Catarina State in the hinterland of the cities of Itaja\u00ed, Palmas, and Blumenau ===Mason (1950)=== Mason (1950) lists the following classification for the Caingang group of languages: *Caingang **S\u00e3o Paulo (Coroado); Nyacfateitei **Paran\u00e1 **Rio Grande do Sul *Shocleng *Taven **Tain **Ingain (Wayana, Guayan\u00e1) ***Patte (Basa) ***Chowa ***Chowaca **Ivitorocai **Gualacho (Coronado) ***Gualach\u00ed ***Chiki ***Cabelludo *Dorin **(bands: Jahuateie, Venharo) **(moieties: Cayurucr\u00e9, Votoro, Cam\u00f3) Mason (1950) also lists the Yabutian languages Aricap\u00fa and Yabuti as \"possibly Caingang.\" == Phonology == ===Consonants=== A large number of allophones map to a set of 14 phonemes:Jolkesky, M.

They are realized as voiced prenasalized stops when between a nasal and an oral vowel, as well as word-initially before oral vowels. Between an oral and a nasal vowel they are conversely realized as prestopped . Between two nasal vowels, or word-initially before nasal vowels, they are realized as full nasal stops: . The first two types of realization also apply when occurring in the syllable coda and followed by a non-nasal segment; these voiced/prenasalized will however be additionally unreleased: . However, by convention these stop- phonemes are always written as in the orthography. * When preceded by an oral vowel, the sequences can be realized as geminate stops: . * is optionally labialized: , etc. * The non-glottal fricatives can word-initially be optionally realized as affricates (including their nasal allophones: .) * can optionally be realized as a voiced bilabial fricative , and as a voiced palatal stop .

As a syllable coda it is a flap when oral and approximant when nasal, and may optionally be palatalized: . * Word-initially in a stressed syllable, may vary in realization between dental and alveolar .

It is based on the Latin script, and consists of fourteen consonants and fourteen vowels, matching the fourteen consonants and fourteen vowels of the Kaingang language. {| class=\"wikitable IPA\" |- !colspan=2|Vowels!!colspan=2|Consonants |- !Letter!!Sound !Letter!!Sound |- |a||\u0251 |f||\u0278 |- |\u00e1||\u028c |g||\u014b~\u0261 |- |\u00e3||\u0254\u0303 |h||h |- |e||e |j||j |- |\u00e9||\u025b |k||k |- |\u1ebd||\u025b\u0303 |m||m~b |- |i||i |n||n~d |- |\u0129||\u0129 |nh||\u0272~\u025f |- |o||o |p||p |- |\u00f3||\u0254 |r||\u0279 |- |u||u |s||\u00e7 |- |\u0169||\u0169 |t||t |- |y||\u0264 |v||w |- |\u1ef9||\u028c\u0303 |'||\u0294 |} There are dictionaries and grammars available for Kaingang. A school was set up in 1969 to teach the Kaingang people to read and write their language. However, the school produced many Kaingang speakers who went back to their reservations to teach others and spread the writing innovations they learned. Only one of the dialects is used as the standard written form, though having the writing system provided a source of pride in the language for the Kaingang people. A Kaingang bible has been published, as well as a dictionary and other publications. Examples of Kaingang writing can be found on Omniglot. ==Grammar== ===Postpositions=== Kaingang makes use of postpositions. * goj: water * goj ki: in the water Postpositions are also used to mark subject. * M\u0129g v\u1ef9 venhv\u00f3 t\u0129. The jaguar runs. * Kof\u00e1 t\u00f3g p\u1ef9n t\u00e3nh. The old man killed the snake. ===Verbs=== Kaingang verbs do not inflect. * r\u00e3gr\u00f3: to plant * Ti t\u00f3g r\u00e3gr\u00f3 kr\u00e3n huri. He planted beans. * \u1ebcg t\u00f3g r\u00e3gr\u00f3 kr\u00e3n huri.
