Papworth elected to sign for the Eastern Suburbs side at the commencement of the 1988 season but his progress was hampered with a series of injuries. Over the next four years in rugby league Papworth's considerable talents were rarely on show; successive breaks to his jaw, shoulders and knees limited his game time to but seven appearances. At the conclusion of the 1991 season Papworth announced his decision to retire. Papworth is now a media personality. For 20 years he was commentator for the Shute Shield on ABC Television and occasionally for the Super Rugby rugby union competition on Fox Sports (Australia). ==References== ==External links== *Brett Papworth scoring statistics *Australian Schoolboys who have become Wallabies Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Living people Category:People educated at Epping Boys High School Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:1963 births Category:Rugby league players from Sydney Category:Rugby league centres ",
