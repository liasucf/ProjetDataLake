    "text": "Iva Marija Toli\u0107 (born 24 June 1974) is a Croatian biophysicist, known for her work on the microtubule cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. She is currently Senior Research Group Leader and Professor of Biology at the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute in Zagreb, Croatia. ==Education== Toli\u0107 completed her Diploma in Molecular Biology from the University of Zagreb, Croatia in 1996 and her Graduate Studies in Molecular Biology in the group of Prof. Nenad Trinajsti\u0107, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute and University of Zagreb, Croatia in 1999. Between 1999 and 2001, she completed part of her PhD work with Prof. Ning Wang, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, United States and was awarded her doctorate in Biology in 2002 by the University of Zagreb, Croatia. ==Career== Upon obtaining her doctorate, Toli\u0107 did her first Post-doctoral training between 2001 and 2002 at the Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark working with Prof. Lene Oddershede and Prof. Kirstine Berg-Sorensen on the microrheology of cells. She then joined the European Laboratory for Non- Linear Spectroscopy, Florence, Italy for post-doctoral research with Prof. Francesco Pavone, working on lymphocyte movement and laser microsurgery on the mitotic spindle. Following her Post-doctoral training, Toli\u0107 was appointed as Research Group Leader (W1, equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany in 2005 and was promoted to Senior Research Group Leader (W2, equivalent to Associate Professor) in 2010. In 2014, she moved to the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute, Zagreb, Croatia, being appointed as Senior Research Group Leader and Professor of Biology. ==Research== As independent investigator, Toli\u0107 has carried out pioneering research in the field of cell biology pertaining to the microtubule cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins, discovering: (i) a novel mechanism of kinetochore capture during mitosis by pivoting of astral microtubules around the spindle pole, (ii) a mechanism of regulation of the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein by attachment to its anchor protein in fission yeast and most recently, (iii) 'Bridging fibers' that are non- kinetochore microtubules connecting sister k-fibers and thereby balancing forces in the spindle. In addition, her research has demonstrated that fission yeast does not undergo replicative aging, contrary to existing theories on aging. ==Personal life== Toli\u0107's parents are the journalist and diplomat Benjamin Toli\u0107 and academic Dubravka Orai\u0107-Toli\u0107. She married Nenad Brgi\u0107 in 2014 and she is the mother of two children. She has stated publicly that she sees no conflict between religion and science. == Awards and Achievements== * EMBO Membership, 2018. * Lieben Prize, 2017. * National Science Award of the Republic of Croatia, 2016. * Croatian Women of Influence Award, 2016. * Special award of the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute for outstanding contribution to the scientific excellence and international recognition of the institute, 2015. * European Biophysics Societies Association Young Investigators' Medal and Prize, 2015. * 5000th Grantee of the European Research Council, 2015. * MRAK award for creativity in science awarded for the collaboration with the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute. * Order of Danica Hrvatska for science, outstanding contributions to science and its promotion in the Republic of Croatia and the world, 2014 * Investigator of the Year, European Life Science Award, 2014. * Featured on Cell \"40 under 40\", 2014. ==Membership in Professional Associations and Societies== Toli\u0107 is a member of European Molecular Biology Organization, the Croatian Biophysical Society, the Croatian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Croatian Microscopy Society. In addition, she is Member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the journal Science. ==References== Category:Women biophysicists Category:Croatian biologists Category:Cell biologists Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Croatian expatriates in Germany Category:Croatian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent Category:European Research Council grantees Category:Scientists from Zagreb Category:Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization ",
