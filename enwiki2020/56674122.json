    "text": "The Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference (TRAC) is an academic organisation and conference which was designed to be an arena for open discussion of archaeological theory in Roman archaeology. ==History== TRAC, organised initially by Eleanor Scott, was held for the first time in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Newcastle on 23\u201324 March 1991. Historically, one of TRAC's main focuses has been on the debates surrounding Romanisation, and this dominated many of the volumes during the 1990s. However, since the early 2000s, there have been a rising number of discussions relating to post-imperial and post-colonial approaches to the Roman world. TRAC was originally established as a one-off event, but, the interest that this conference garnered led to it becoming an annual fixture. After the initial meeting in Newcastle, TRAC has been run at many of the major archaeology departments in the UK and has even been organised at institutions in Europe and America. TRAC was joined with RAC (the Roman Archaeology Conference), organised by the Roman Society, at Reading University in 1995. ==Participants== Many of the participants in TRAC are early career scholars or postgraduates who use the conference to outline their own original research and attempt to re-define existing models about the Roman past. Andrew Gardner, in an article in TRAC 2005, raised the issue of a gender imbalance in the history of TRAC conferences. However, in more recent article, Eleanor Scott concluded that TRAC had given an equal platform to female archaeologists working within Roman archaeology. In the 2010s, TRAC has becoming increasingly international. == Annual Meeting Locations == {| class=\"wikitable\" |29th |Canterbury |11-14 April 2019 |- |28th |University of Edinburgh |12-14 April 2018 |- |27th |Durham University |28-31 March 2017 |- |26th |Rome |16-19 March 2016 |- |25th |University of Leicester |27-29 March 2015 |- |24th |University of Reading |28-30 March 2014 |- |23rd |King's College London |4-6 April 2013 |- |22nd |Frankfurt |29 - 1 March April 2012 |- |21st |Newcastle |14-17 April 2011 |- |20th |University of Oxford |25-28 March 2010 |- |19th |Michigan/Southampton |3-5 April 2009/April 17\u201318, 2009 |- |18th |Amsterdam |4-6 March 2008 |- |17th |London |29 - 1 March April 2007 |- |16th |Canterbury |24-25 March 2006 |- |15th |Birmingham |31-3 March April, 2005 |- |14th |Durham University |26-27 March 2004 |- |13th |University of Leicester |3-6 April 2003 |} ==Publications== TRAC was previously published as a set of conference proceedings.
