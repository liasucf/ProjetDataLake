    "text": "Jonathan Newdick, artist and illustrator, was born in Newbury in 1948, and was brought up in the rural South of England. His work references trees, buildings and the land; drawings about rather than of things. In 1971 after graduating from The West Sussex College of Art became a designer in Fleet Street, but left London and returned to Sussex, where he worked as a typographer and then book designer. He also worked as a visiting lecturer at the London College of Printing, alongside working as an illustrator for books and magazines, and continuing to draw landscapes. His diverse work-load led to a Spanish network television documentary production in the early 1980s. In 1990 he was awarded a Master's Degree in the Cultural and Critical Theory of British Art from the University of Sussex after which he turned from designing to drawing and printmaking. He was the Artist in Residence at Petworth House for the National Trust in the late 1990s, where he spent a year on the estate, often working on large-scale pieces in the fields. In 2011, he began work on a set of pencil drawings which can be seen as a continuation of the Recording Britain scheme of the Second World War, documenting barns and farm buildings of the Leconfield Estate in West Sussex which appeared to be under threat from development. Work in public collections include the National Trust . Kevis House Gallery in Petworth has a selection of Newdick's work for sale. ==Collaborations== He set up The Window Press as illustrator in conjunction with author Peter Jerrome to publish a manuscript by photographer George Garland in 1976, recalling Petworth before photography. ==Publications== *The Complete Freshwater Fishes Of The British Isles.
