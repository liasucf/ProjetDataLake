    "text": "The Bray boxing club shooting happened on 5 June 2018. Three men were shot, one died and one of the survivors was Pete Taylor, father of Katie Taylor. ==Shooting== At 6:55am a man walked into the Bray Boxing Club just before a class started and fired a number of shots, killing Bobby Messert, injuring Pete Taylor in the arm and chest and Ian Britton in the legs. There were 12 people in the gym including 1 minor at the time of the shooting. Katie Taylor had previously trained in the club, but was no longer involved and was in the United States at the time. Pete Taylor and the other survivor of the shooting were taken to St. Vincent's University Hospital after being shot. Gardai were looking for a silver coloured Volkswagen Caddy after examining CCTV. The van was thought to have travelled from Bray through Shankill, then abandoned on Pigeon House Road near Poolbeg Generating Station in Ringsend. ==Aftermath== Pete Taylor spoke of his distress in the aftermath of the shooting both at the event and at the death of his close friend Bobby Messet, who had joined the gym in 2010. Petes' partner Karen Brown said on Instagram that she and Pete were relocating abroad after a \"turbulent summer\". The week following the shooting, Wicklow County Council took possession of the building. Katie Taylor issued a statement issuing condolences to the family of Bobby Messet and relief that her father had survived. She mentioned that she was estranged from her father and nothing to do with the club since 2015. She also criticised the media for the use of her name and image in stories relating to the shooting and asked the media to leave her and her family alone. Wicklow County Council had been pursuing Pete Taylor for \u20ac9,533 unpaid rent the month before, which was revealed in a freedom of information request. The council believed that rent had not been paid since 2014. Pete Taylor rejected allegations that the club was in arrears over rent, saying there was a legitimate dispute over the amount owed and he criticised the council for changing locks on the club building. ==Arrests and charges== Gerard Cervi, of no fixed abode, was arrested and charged at a special sitting of Bray District Court in September 2018. The 31-year-old was originally from East Wall. A woman in her 20s was arrested in relation to the case, but released without charge. Mr Cervi was also charged with the attempted murders of Peter Taylor and Ian Britton in January 2019. ==References== Category:Unsolved murders in Ireland Category:People murdered in the Republic of Ireland Category:Deaths by firearm in the Republic of Ireland Category:Irish murder victims Category:June 2018 crimes in Europe Category:2018 murders in Europe Category:2018 crimes in the Republic of Ireland Category:2010s murders in the Republic of Ireland ",
