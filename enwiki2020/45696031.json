    "text": "The Pearl Jam 2015 Latin America Tour was a concert tour by the American rock band Pearl Jam. The tour consisted of nine shows in Latin America, including venues in Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. This was the first tour following the Lightning Bolt Tour that finished in 2014 and the first shows in Latin American since the band released their 2013 album Lightning Bolt. The tour started on November 4 in Santiago, Chile, and finished on November 28 in Mexico City. On August 6, it was announced that the show in Colombia will be moved from Estadio El Camp\u00edn to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Park. The tour started in Santiago, with the band covering John Lennon's song \"Imagine\" during their set. Writing for Consequence of Sound, Alex Young called it \"a truly surreal moment\". At the show in Porto Alegre on November 11, the band covered Pink Floyd's song \"Comfortably Numb\" for the first time. At the show in S\u00e3o Paulo the band dedicated their song \"Love Boat Captain\" to the victims of the Paris attacks, which took place the previous day. They continued the tour by playing their first ever show in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia on November 25. The tour concluded with a show at the Foro Sol Stadium in Mexico City, in front of more than 60,000 people. ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !width=\"150\"|Date !width=\"150\"|City !width=\"150\"|Country !width=\"275\"|Venue |- |- style=\"background:#ddd;\" |colspan=\"4\"|Latin America |- |November 4, 2015 |Santiago |Chile |Estadio Nacional |- |November 7, 2015 |La Plata |Argentina |Estadio Ciudad de La Plata |- |November 11, 2015 |Porto Alegre |rowspan=\"5\"|Brazil |Arena do Gr\u00eamio |- |November 14, 2015 |S\u00e3o Paulo |Est\u00e1dio do Morumbi |- |November 17, 2015 |Brasilia |Est\u00e1dio Nacional Man\u00e9 Garrincha |- |November 20, 2015 |Belo Horizonte |Estadio Mineir\u00e3o |- |November 22, 2015 |Rio de Janeiro |Maracan\u00e3 Stadium |- |November 25, 2015 |Bogot\u00e1 |Colombia |Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Park |- |November 28, 2015 |Mexico City |Mexico |Foro Sol Stadium |} ==Band members== ;Pearl Jam *Jeff Ament \u2013 bass guitar *Stone Gossard \u2013 rhythm guitar *Mike McCready \u2013 lead guitar *Eddie Vedder \u2013 lead vocals, guitar *Matt Cameron \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians *Boom Gaspar \u2013 Hammond B3 and keyboards ==References== Category:2015 concert tours Category:Pearl Jam concert tours ",
