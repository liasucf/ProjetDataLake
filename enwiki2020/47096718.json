    "text": "4-Methylpentedrone (also known as 4-MPD and 4-Methyl-\u03b1-methylamino- valerophenone), is a stimulant drug of the cathinone class that has been sold online as a designer drug. It is a higher homolog of 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone) and 4-methylbuphedrone (4-MeMABP), and the p-methyl derivative of pentedrone. It can also be viewed as the methylamino analog of pyrovalerone. A related compound, 4-methyl-\u03b1-ethylaminopentiophenone (4-MEAP), has been found to be incorrectly sold as 4-methylpentedrone. ==See also== * Buphedrone * Substituted cathinone == References == Category:Cathinones Category:Designer drugs Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors ",
