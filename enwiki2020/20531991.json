    "text": "The Crit\u00e9rium des As (Race of the Aces) was a cycle race that was generally held at the end of the season, with entry by invitation only, for the leading riders of the season. Competitors rode behind pacers on tandems or motorcycles. It was held from 1921 until 1990, mostly in Paris, France but also in Switzerland and Holland. The last Crit\u00e9rium des As was held in 1990 and was replaced by the Roue d'Or des As the following year. ==History== In 1920 the Crit\u00e9rium de la r\u00e9sistance was run from Bordeaux to Paris (Longchamp) and back to Bordeaux, and is regarded as the forerunner of Crit\u00e9rium des As. The paced event was won by Louis Mottiat of Belgium, in 56 hours and 48 minutes. In 1921 the best riders of the season were invited to enter the Crit\u00e9rium des As, 27 laps of a 3.63 km circuit around Longchamp. They rode alone except for pacers who helped on occasional laps, not being fast enough to last longer. Crowds of up to 6,000 watched in the years before the World War II. The individual pacers were replaced by tandems, triplets, motorcycles and finally specialist Derny lightweight motorcycles in 1947. Ren\u00e9 de Latour, a journalist who organised the race in 1943, when the inside of the circuit included flak guns to defend the Renault factory in Boulogne-Billancourt, said: The most prolific winner was Rik Van Steenbergen of Belgium, with five wins. ==Winners== {|width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\"| *1921 Philippe Thys *1922 Ren\u00e9 Vermandel *1923 Jules van Hevel *1924 Jules van Hevel *1925 Achille Souchard *1926 Francis P\u00e9lissier *1927 Gabriel Marcillac *1928 Charles Lacquehay *1929 Georges Wambst *1930 Camille Foucaux *1931 Jean Marechal *1932 Ernest Terreau *1933 Charles P\u00e9lissier *1934 Andr\u00e9 Leducq *1935 Ernest Terreau *1936 Ernest Terreau *1937 Georges Paillard *1938The 1938 race was not called the Crit\u00e9rium des As.
