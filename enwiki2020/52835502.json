The missiles took off from Tongchang-ri, in the Northwest, and some flew 620 miles before falling into the sea between N.K. and Japan. The move prompted US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embark on a diplomatic mission ten days later to Japan, South Korea and China, in an effort to resolve the heightened international tension in the region S.K. defense officials later said the projectiles were Scud-ER ballistic missiles with a 620-mile range. * Mar 7: N.K. bans all Malaysians from leaving its soil, as retaliations escalate over diplomatic rift after Kim Jong-nam's death. ** Mar 9: N.K. allows two Malaysian employees of the United Nations' World Food Program to leave the country, while 9 remain retained. * Mar 10: Commercial satellite imagery reveals that N.K. is continuing to excavate a tunnel at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, which may support an explosion up to 14 times more powerful than its last test. **While the 5th nuclear test (2016) was estimated as 15-20 kilotons, the site is now ready to test up to 282 kilotons. * Mar 13: N.K. boycotts a U.N. review of its human rights record. *Mar 16: It is reported that the number of official markets in North Korea has been quickly growing (under the connivance of the authorities). *Mar 17: It is reported that Kim Jong-un instructed Ministry of State Security officials to refrain from threatening people in order to extort bribes. It is unclear why and how long this new policy will last. * Mar 19: N.K. claims that it conducted a successful ground jet test of a newly developed high-thrust missile engine. This could be progress towards developing an ICBM. *Mar 20: Some reports say that prices for market goods are fluctuating. This may be an indicator of the State's losing princing control, in favor of market forces. * March 22: N.K. fires a missile off its east coast on Wednesday, but the test apparently fails. *Mar 23: In two among numerous recurrent statements, N.K. vows to continue to take nuclear deterrent steps against the U.S.' hard-line policy toward it. **In part N.K. says this is in response to South Korea-U.S. joint military drills taking place in March. **For the first time N.K. also said that it had been testing missile launch drills regularly, and that it would continue to do so. *Mar 24: S.K. officials say that N.K. is all set for its 6th nuclear test. * Mar 25: More reports point to N.K. has been increasingly hacking numerous financial institutions. S.K. officials estimate that N.K.'s \"hacking network is immense, encompassing a group of 1,700 hackers\", which are based outside N.K.

In addition, it was charged in connection with 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to N.K. ** This was the largest civil penalty ever levied in a Commerce export control case. The investigation was triggered by Reuters' investigative journalism. * Mar 8: North Korean banks subject to international sanctions have recently been banned by Swift from using its global financial messaging service, after Swift was caught in violation of sanctions by the UN. ** Seven blacklisted North Korean banks had continued to use the Swift network in recent years despite the UN Security Council sanctions. Later, four had voluntarily withdrawn, leaving three banks identified as Bank of East Land, Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking Corp. UN investigators uncovered evidence that the North Korean banks had continued to use Swift's services despite being subjected to UN sanctions. Upon publication of the UN report, Belgian authorities ordered Swift to ban those banks from using its services. ** However, the tighter enforcement of these sanctions may be ineffectual if China continues to allow N.K. to move funds between the two countries. **Mar 14: The Wall Street Journal reported that despite U.S. sanctions four N.K. banks still remain connected with the international financial system through Swift. ***These banks are: Foreign Trade Bank, Kumgang Bank, Koryo Credit Development Bank, and North East Asia Bank. ***The loophole was possible because Swift is required by law to comply with U.N. sanctions, but doesn't have to abide by U.S. law if its activities do not fall under U.S. jurisdiction, the report said. * Mar 13: After the one-year anniversary of the S.K.'s new North Korean Human Rights Law, its centerpiece North Korean Human Rights Foundation (designed to act as a bridge between the human rights NGOs and the Unification Ministry), is yet to be created due to political divisions.

The policy in fact continues to consist of military deterrence, economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. ** He explicitly rejected any return to the bargaining table in an effort to buy time by halting North Korea's accelerating testing program (continuing this same policy from Obama's administration). Negotiations \u201ccan only be achieved by denuclearizing, giving up their weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said \u2014 a step to which the North committed in 1992, and again in subsequent accords, but has always violated. \u201cOnly then will we be prepared to engage them in talks.\u201d ** He warned that all options should be on the table to stop them, including possible pre-emptive military action \u201cif they elevate the threat of their weapons program\u201d to an unacceptable level. *Mar 19: The U.S. Secretary of State visits China. N.K. issues are prominent in talks, but no new agreements come out of it.

This follows an in- depth 2014 human rights report that recommended prosecution. Actual prosecution remains uncertain. * Mar 30: Kim Jong-nam's body is released by Malaysia to N.K.

Graphic from the United States Geological Survey showing the location of seismic activity at the time of the test, which caused an earthquake of 6.3-magnitude. *Sep 3: N.K. conducts another underground nuclear test. This was N.K's 6th nuclear test since its first one a decade earlier. **The underground blast was by far North Korea's most powerful ever. Experts estimated that the blast was of about 140 kilotons, or 4 to 16 times more powerful than any the North had set off before, making experts wonder whether the North had set off a thermonuclear bomb. **The explosion caused tremors that were felt in South Korea and China. The news of the test were first revealed by seismic authorities that detected an artificial earthquake near the Pyongyang regime's known nuclear test site. **Shortly after the test, N.K. claimed that it had indeed tested successfully a hydrogen bomb, which involved a \u201ctwo-stage thermonuclear weapon\u201d, capable of being loaded on to an intercontinental ballistic missile. *Sep 4: S.K. officials said that they had seen evidence that North Korea may be preparing another test, likely of an intercontinental ballistic missile. *Sep 15: N.K. test-launches another missile that flies over Japan. **The missile flew over Japan and landed in the sea some 1,200 miles east of Hokkaido. *Sep 25: N.K.'s foreign minister states that Trump's comments suggesting he would eradicate N.K. and its leaders are \u201ca declaration of war.\u201d **He also asserts that his country has the right to defend itself by shooting down U.S. planes, even if they are not in the country's airspace. **N.B.: For historical perspective note that N.K. has made similar bellicose remarks in the past.

Such authorization could result in forceful interdiction and lead to escalations, a risk reminiscent to the Cuban missile crisis. The draft resolution also seeks to impose a full oil embargo. *Sep 11: The UN Security Council unanimously ratchets up sanctions again against N.K. **These sanctions fall significantly short of the far-reaching penalties that the Trump administration had demanded, having had to compromise with China and Russia to gain their support: ***The resolution only sets a cap on oil exports to N.K. The U.S. had originally wanted a complete cutoff, but China has long worried that such a drastic measure would lead to N.K.\u2019s collapse. ***It asks all countries to inspect ships going in and out of North Korea\u2019s ports (a provision put in place by the Security Council in 2009) but does not authorize the use of force for ships that do not comply (the U.S. wanted authorization to use force). ***It imposes requirements, but does not ban, the import of North Korean laborers. *Sep 15: S.K plans donate $8 million to two United Nations humanitarian programs in N.K., but Japan's government asks S.K. to reconsider the aid in light of N.K. latest missile test. *Sep 15: U.S. ambassador to the U.N. hinted to N.K. that military options might be on the table if U.N. sanctions do not deter the regime from advancing its nuclear program. *Sep 19: In his speech to the U.N.
