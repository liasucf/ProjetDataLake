The film stars Lee Sung-min, Cho Jin-woong and Kim Sung-kyun. ==Plot== Dae-ho is an ex-cop who is forced to quit his job when an impulsive bust left his partner stabbed and a major felon on the run. Five years have passed since that incident, and now Dae-ho runs a humble restaurant in his hometown Gijang. Never one to question his own superior strength, smarts and righteousness, Dae-ho has appointed himself the unofficial \"sheriff\" of the village, and assembled a dubious posse of locals to keep an eye on things. So when a face from Dae-ho's past re-emerges, claiming to have left crime behind and promising great things for the town, Dae-ho has his suspicions, and he is going to act on them. ==Cast== *Lee Sung-min as Dae-ho *Cho Jin-woong as Jong- jin *Kim Sung-kyun as Duk-man *Kim Jong-soo as Yong-hwan *Jo Woo-jin as Seon- cheol *Lim Hyun-sung as Kang-gon *Bae Jung-nam as Choon-mo *Kim Hye-eun as Mi- seon *Kim Byeong-ok as Chief Kang *Kim Kwang-gyoo as Subsection chief Park *Hiromitsu Takeda as Takeshi *Son Yeo-eun as Hee-soon *Kim Jae-young as Kwak Jeon-moo *Kang Eun-ah as Na-yeong *Noh Kang-min as Seung-hyeon *Choi Moon- kyung as Detective Jo's wife *Jung Man-sik as Il-sik (cameo) *Kim Jong-goo as Seon-cheol's father (special appearance) *Joo Jin-mo as Ship captain Park (special appearance) *Lee Il-jae as Deputy assistant commissioner (special appearance) *Baek Seung-hyeon as Detective Jo (special appearance) *Kim Hong- pa as Real estate director Yoon (special appearance) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2017 films Category:South Korean films Category:2010s crime comedy films Category:South Korean crime comedy films Category:Lotte Entertainment films Category:2017 comedy films ",
