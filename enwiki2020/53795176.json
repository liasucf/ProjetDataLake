Aided with the Parbhani Agriculture University, located in Parbhani city, the district is witnessing positive changes in academics. Colleges such as Government Veterinary College, and research centres related to agriculture from the university are creating Parbhani's image as an upcoming educational hub. Parbhani district is divided into nine administrative sub-units (tehsils), namely, Parbhani, Gangakhed, Sonpeth, Pathri, Manwath, Palam, Selu, Jintur, and Purna. ==Parbhani city== ===Agricultural University=== The first college of Agriculture was established in this region at Parbhani in 1956 by Hyderabad State Government just before the Maharashtra State reorganisation. The current day Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University (VNMAU) was established on 18 May 1972 as Marathwada Agriculture University to fulfil the regional aspirations of agrarian growth, with further responsibilities to provide education in agriculture and allied fields, and to undertake research and facilitate technology transfer in Marathwada region. It is one of the only four Agricultural Universities in the State of Maharashtra. Since 1970s, Parbhani has proved itself as the hub of educational, research, and extension activities. The famous 'Gaorani' cotton, a breed of Indian cotton, is the result of research facilities at Parbhani. The university was renamed after the name of former Chief Minister of Maharashta, Vasantrao Naik, in 2013. College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences is located on the campus of VNMAU which is one of the constituent Veterinary Colleges coming under the authority of Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University, Nagpur from 2000.
