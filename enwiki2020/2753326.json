    "text": "The Latvia national basketball team () represents Latvia in international basketball. They are organized and run by the Latvian Basketball Association. Latvia has reached the European Basketball Championship 15 times, with their ultimate success occurring during the inter-war period, when they became the first team to win the tournament in 1935. Four years later, they had another impressive run to come away with the silver in 1939. After 1939 though Latvia were forced to suspend their national team operations, due to the Occupation of the Baltic states during World War II. Latvia regained independence in 1991, with their national team taking part in international competition once again a year later. ==History== ===Origins of the team=== On 26 November 1923, the Latvijas Basketbola Savien\u012bba was founded, earlier than most basketball federations from other countries.Federation Focus: Latvia On 29 April 1924, Latvia played their first international game versus Estonia, winning it 20\u201316.Federation Focus: Latvia In the winter of 1924, the first men's basketball championship was held, while the first women's championship was organized in 1933.Federation Focus: Latvia Latvians, like their Baltic neighbors Lithuanians and Estonians, also began playing basketball in the 1920s, quickly rising as the strongest of the Baltic teams. On 13 December 1925 in Riga, when the Lithuanian national team played their first international game. Latvia easily swept them with the score of 41\u201320.Stanislovas Stonkus \"Krep\u0161inio kelias \u012f Lietuv\u0105\" (page: 17) Later on, Latvia continued to dominate the future three-times European champions as well (41\u201329 and 123\u201310).1937-ieji ir 1939-ieji \u2013 pirmieji Lietuvos krep\u0161inio \u0161lov\u0117s metai In fact, Latvia had one of the world's strongest national basketball teams. The first Latvian teams consisted of students and pupils, who were trained by coaches of the American YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association).Federation Focus: Latvia Latvia also was one of the eight countries which signed the founding act of FIBA on 18 June 1932 in Geneva, along with Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Argentina. The Latvian representative in this event was J\u0101zeps \u0160adeiko.Federation Focus: Latvia ===EuroBasket 1935=== The Latvian national team at EuroBasket 1935. The Latvians won the first European basketball championship, the EuroBasket 1935 held by the International Basketball Federation's FIBA Europe continental federation. They defeated Hungary in the preliminary round, Switzerland in the semifinals, and Spain in the final to finish at the top of the ten-nation field. Latvia held their opponents to 49 points over three games, the lowest points-against average in the tournament. Their scoring rate, 98 points over three games for 32.67 points per game, was second only to France. Latvia is the smallest country in population to ever win the EuroBasket. In 2012, Latvian film director Aigars Grauba directed the historical sports drama Dream Team 1935 about the journey of the Latvian team towards winning the title. ===1936 Summer Olympic Games (Berlin 1936)=== The Latvia national basketball team participated in the first appearance of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. Latvia were reigning European champions and were considered to be one of the pre-tournament favorites. Although the Olympics did not go that well for the Latvians. They began the tournament with a 20\u201317 victory over Uruguay. However, they were soundly beaten 23\u201334 by Canada and after suffering another defeat to Poland 23\u201328, the Latvians did not qualify for the knockout stage, unlike their neighbors Estonia.1936 Latvia Men's Olympic Basketball This was the first and only appearance for Latvia at the Olympic Games as of 2019 (their female counterparts made their first appearance in 2008). ===EuroBasket 1937=== At the EuroBasket 1937, the reigning champions got off to a great start in their first game in the tournament by blowing out Czechoslovakia 44-11. In their second game they lost a close one to Poland to drop to (1-1) in the standings. They finished up group play with a needed win against France to put them in a three-way tie for the lead of the four-team group. However, it wouldn't be enough for the national team to reach the semifinals as they came out on the bottom of the tie-breaker against Poland and France. This result came about despite the Latvians being the highest-scoring team in the entire tournament and allowing fewer opponent points than any of the other teams in their group. Being in the bottom half of the preliminary group meant that the team could finish no better than fifth. In the classification semifinal, Latvia faced Egypt, which had withdrawn after their first two preliminary matches. They advanced to the 5th/6th place playoff, which they lost to Estonia 41\u201319. ===EuroBasket 1939=== Latvian national team during opening ceremony of EuroBasket 1939 In 1939, despite losing twice, including a rematch of the 1937 game against Estonia, Latvia secured silver medals with 5 wins. Poland, which also had a 5-2 record, finished third as Latvia had won the match between the two teams. The tournament's opening and, in retrospect, decisive game between Latvia and Lithuania ended in a dramatic late victory for the hosts and eventual champions Lithuania, souring the sports relations between the two countries and leading to the cancellation of the 1939 Baltic Cup.Pranas Lubinas - taurusis tarpukario krep\u0161inio mil\u017einas One of the 1939's vice- champions, Alfr\u0113ds Krauklis, once said: \"Frankly saying \u2013 these three Baltic states raised the European basketball. Now they say that its Spanish, and so what? Let them say... And I say \u2013 it's our merit!\".Telecast \"M\u016bs\u0173 krep\u0161inis\" (Season: 1; Episode: 1; Quotation begins at 10:20) ===Soviet and Nazi period (1940\u20131991)=== Due to Soviet and Nazi occupations, Latvians were unable to represent Latvia in FIBA organized tournaments or the Olympic Games. Instead, they were forced to play for the Soviet Union national team. Horrific times in Latvia began. In 1940 the massive people deportations started, implemented by the Soviets. Thousands of Latvians were forced to leave their homeland, thousands of them died due to the active warfare during World War II. Though, despite all the cruel challenges, basketball was continued to be played and retained its popularity in Latvia. In 1941 a Baltic States tournament was organized in Kaunas Sports Hall. The Lithuanian SSR team won the final against the Latvian SSR, 38\u201333. At the 1952 Summer Olympics, Maigonis Valdmanis became the first Latvian representative on the Soviet squad, which won the Olympic silver medals that year. A few years later two other Latvian basketball stars joined the team: J\u0101nis Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161 and Valdis Mui\u017enieks. Later on, the trio won two EuroBasket titles and two times became Olympic vice-champions together. In the 1950s, R\u012bgas ASK, coached by the Soviet legend Aleksandr Gomelsky, became the major force of the Soviet Union and even Europe by winning three consecutive European Cup titles from 1958 to 1960. The club's roster had multiple European champions in J\u0101nis Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161, Maigonis Valdmanis and Valdis Mui\u017enieks.Federation Focus: Latvia Furthermore, in 1960 TTT Riga won the European Cup for Women's Clubs, undoubtedly turning Riga into the capital of basketball with the two major European basketball titles held by the single city's clubs at the same time. And it only was the first of the stunning 18 European titles. In later years other Latvian basketball stars appeared, such as Valdis Valters and Igors Miglinieks, both of whom were eventually crowned as Olympic champions. Valdis Valters is considered to be one of Europe's greatest basketball players of the 1980s. In addition to his Olympic title, he also won the World Cup in 1982 and became the European champion twice, being named as the MVP of EuroBasket 1981. Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 representing Team Latvia at the EuroBasket 2009 ===After the restoration of independence (from 1991)=== On 4 May 1990 Latvia declared the country's independence from the Soviet Union. Consequently, in September 1991 its basketball federation was re- affiliated with FIBA.Federation Focus: Latvia Though, despite having some remarkable players like Valdis Valters, Igors Miglinieks, Ainars Bagatskis, Kaspars Kambala, Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161, Latvia failed to recover its inter-war glory. Their best result after restoring the country's independence is the 8th place achieved at EuroBasket 2001. Although, basketball is slowly regaining its power in Latvia with the help of the medals-winning youth squads. ===EuroBasket 2013=== During EuroBasket 2013, Latvia began their tournament run with two wins against Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro before facing longtime Baltic rival Lithuania. Although in the highly anticipated match between the two nations, Lithuania prevailed 67-59. Latvia then lost their next match versus Serbia, but rebounded to win their final fixture in group play against Macedonia to advance. In the second group phase of the tournament Latvia displayed immediate dominance in their first game of group play over Ukraine winning 86-51. It turned out to be the only win Latvia would record in the group, as they were eventually eliminated. ===EuroBasket 2015=== As one of the hosts for EuroBasket 2015 in Riga, Latvia began their campaign at the tournament victorious over Belgium 78-67. In their second match, they were once again pitted against their rivals Lithuania. Latvia looked to avenge their lost from the prior EuroBasket showdown between the two, as the national team got off to a strong start in the 1st quarter. Unfortunately, the Latvians were unable to maintain the momentum they started the match with, as they fell to their rivals again, 68-49. While it was demoralizing for Latvia to be defeated in that mannerer in front of their home crowd, they recovered quickly to win 2 out of the next three matches they played to move on to the knockout stage. There, Latvia beat Slovenia to advance to the quarterfinals, but ultimately fell short to the eventual bronze medalist France. ===EuroBasket 2017=== At EuroBasket 2017, Latvia entered the competition with high expectations, as they fielded one of their most potent lineups ever. With the addition of Latvian star Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is joining the senior national team for the first time, Latvia was poised to go on a long tournament run. But in their first match they were out lasted by a veteran Serbian squad, 92-82. Although, the national team bounced back in a huge way dismantling Belgium 92-64, with Porzi\u0146\u0123is and J\u0101nis Timma leading the way in scoring with 27 points apiece. They also went on to win their next three matches in group play to finish with a (4-1) record, to earn a spot in the knockout rounds. In their round of 16 match up, they throttled Montenegro 100-68. Latvia ran into an buzz saw in their quarterfinal match though, falling to the eventual champions Slovenia. Latvia finished 5th in the tournament overall, reaching their best post-war result in the history of the national team, in which Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is debuted with astonishing averages of 23.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks at the age of 22. ===Recent years=== On 1 August 2019, Latvia named former player Roberts \u0160telmahers the new head coach of the national team. He will replace Arnis Vecvagars. ==Competitive record== ===FIBA World Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|World Cup !rowspan=12| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- |1950 to 1990||colspan=4 rowspan=1|Part of Soviet Union |- | 1994||colspan=4 rowspan=7|Did not qualify |- | 1998 |- | 2002 |- | 2006 |- | 2010 |- | 2014 |- | 2019 |12||7||5 |- | 2023||colspan=4|To be determined |colspan=3|To be determined |- !Total!!0/7!! !! !! !!12!!7!!5 |} ===Olympic Games=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|Olympic Games !rowspan=13| !colspan=3|Qualifying |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- | 1936||15th||3||1||2 |colspan=3 rowspan=2| |- |1948 to 1988||colspan=4|Part of Soviet Union |- | 1992||colspan=4 rowspan=8|Did not qualify |5||2||3 |- | 1996 |- | 2000 |- | 2004 |- | 2008 |- | 2012 |- | 2016 |3||2||1 |- | 2020 |- !Total!!1/9!!3!!1!!2!!8!!4!!4 |} ===EuroBasket=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%;\" !colspan=5|EuroBasket !rowspan=21| !colspan=3|Qualification |- !Year !Position !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| !width=30| |- | 1935||bgcolor=gold|||bgcolor=gold|3||bgcolor=gold|3||bgcolor=gold|0 |colspan=3 rowspan=4| |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 1937||6th||5||3||2 |- | 1939||bgcolor=silver|||bgcolor=silver|7||bgcolor=silver|5||bgcolor=silver|2 |- |1946 to 1991||colspan=4|Part of Soviet Union |- | 1993||10th||6||2||4 |8||5||3 |- | 1995||colspan=4|Did not qualify |6||0||6 |- | 1997||16th||5||0||5 |10||7||3 |- | 1999||colspan=4|Did not qualify |10||3||7 |- | 2001||8th||7||2||5 |13||9||4 |- | 2003||13th||3||0||3 |10||6||4 |- | 2005||13th||3||0||3 |6||4||2 |- | 2007||13th||3||1||2 |6||4||2 |- | 2009||13th||3||1||2 |6||4||2 |- | 2011||21st ||5||0||5 |8||3||5 |- | 2013||11th||8||4||4 |8||5||3 |- |style=\"border: 3px solid red\"| 2015||8th||9||4||5 |6||6||0 |- | 2017||5th||7||5||2 |colspan=3|Directly qualified |- | 2021 |colspan=4|To be determined |colspan=3|To be determined |- !Total!!14/16!!74!!30!!44!!97!!56!!41 |} ==Results and fixtures== ===EuroBasket 2021 Qualifiers=== ====Group H==== ==Team== ===Current roster=== Roster for the EuroBasket 2021 Qualifiers matches played on 21 and 24 February 2020 against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. ===Depth chart=== ===Head coach history=== ===Notable players=== Retired players: *Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 \u2013 was the highest ever NBA drafted Latvian basketball player until 2015.
