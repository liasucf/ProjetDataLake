    "text": "Annika Billstr\u00f6m (born 7 April 1956 in H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand, V\u00e4sternorrland County) is a Swedish social democratic politician. She was the first female mayor of Stockholm, serving between 2004 and 2006. ==Background== Billstr\u00f6m's background was as the chief financial officer of Handels, the Swedish Commercial Employees' Union between 1987 and 1994. She was elected to the Stockholm City Council serving as road commissioner in 1994\u201398 and commissioner in opposition from 1998 to 2002. ==Mayoralty== Billstr\u00f6m was appointed mayor of Stockholm in 2002 by the City Council after winning the municipal election and forming a majority with the Left party and the Green party. Two of her decisions as mayor in particular were controversial, the first being the new entry toll that was introduced for vehicles entering the centre of Stockholm. The toll was decided on a state-level to ensure support by the Green Party for the newly formed Social democratic cabinet and Billstr\u00f6m was forced to honor this agreement even though she had promised not to in the run up to the 2002 election. In 2006 a referendum was held to let the people of Stockholm determine whether they wanted the entry tolls permanented or not, with more than 51% voting yes. The entry tolls were thus enforced by the conservative majority ruling 2006\u201310. Billstr\u00f6m's other decision was to turn a central building in Stockholm (Skatteskrapan p\u00e5 S\u00f6dermalm) into student housing, which was criticised for being expensive for taxpayers. After losing the election in 2006, Billstr\u00f6m stepped down and was replaced by Carin J\u00e4mtin. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Stockholm Category:People from H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand Municipality Category:Municipal commissioners of Sweden Category:Swedish Social Democratic Party politicians Category:Swedish trade unionists Category:Swedish bloggers Category:Writers from Stockholm Category:Women mayors of places in Sweden Category:Swedish women bloggers Category:21st- century Swedish women politicians Category:20th-century women politicians ",
