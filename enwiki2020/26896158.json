    "text": "The Wieger StG-940 was an East German series of assault rifles loosely based upon the Kalashnikov AK-74. The StG-940 was chambered in 5.56\u00d745mm NATO and the StG-942 in 5.45\u00d739mm M74. The weapon was tested but not officially adopted by the East German Army. It was conceived and developed from 1985 and produced between 1985 and 1990, during the final phase of East Germany's existence as a state. The brand name is a synaeresis of the words Wiesa (town of manufacture) and Germany. The weapon was intended for export but also for the use of the national special forces (the STG-943 was known to be in use with the Stasi). ==See also== * List of assault rifles ==References== ==External links== * Wieger Sturmgewehr * EAST GERMAN WIEGER STG RIFLE * Wieger STG 940 rifles Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 1985 Category:5.45\u00d739mm assault rifles Category:5.56\u00d745mm NATO assault rifles Category:Kalashnikov derivatives Category:Military of East Germany Category:Stasi Category:Carbines nl:Wieger ",
