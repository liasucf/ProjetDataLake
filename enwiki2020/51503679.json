    "text": "Tepee for Two is the 130th Woody Woodpecker cartoon that was released in theaters on October 4, 1963. == Plot == When Woody makes way too much racket with his TV set and musical instruments, his neighbors have had enough and evict him from the entire city. He decides he'd be better off living in the \"wide open spaces\" anyway and makes himself a home out west... on top of an Indian's tepee. The Indian is not pleased with the intrusive woodpecker and tries to remove him from his premises... with little luck. Finally, the Indian slingshots the redhead back to where he came from, only to discover his TV set is left behind and is now playing \"The Woody Woodpecker Show\". == Notes == * This is one of the shorts where Woody Woodpecker loses in the end. The other shorts include Busman's Holliday, Woody's Clip Joint, The Tenant's Racket, Solid Ivory, Smoked Hams, Real Gone Woody, The Screwball, Under the Counter Spy, Well Oiled, The Dizzy Acrobat, Science Friction, The Shutter Bug, What's Sweepin', A Fine Feathered Frenzy, The Coo Coo Bird, Ski for Two, The Beach Nut and Bye, Bye, Blackboard. ==References== == External links == * Tepee for Two in Internet Movie Database Category:English-language films Category:1963 films Category:1963 animated films Category:Walter Lantz Productions shorts Category:Woody Woodpecker films Category:American animated short films Category:Universal Pictures animated short films Category:1960s American animated films Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Animated films about animals Category:Animated films about birds Category:Films about Native Americans Category:American films ",
