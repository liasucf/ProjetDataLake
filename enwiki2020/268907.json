Located in the northwest of the New Territories, it had a population of 449,070 in 2001. ==Geography== Tin Shui Wai New Town Yuen Long District contains the largest alluvial plain in Hong Kong, the Yuen Long-Kam Tin plain. With an area of 144 km\u00b2, the district covers many traditional villages including Ping Shan Heung, Ha Tsuen Heung, Kam Tin Heung, Pat Heung, San Tin Heung and Shap Pat Heung, as well as Yuen Long Town and Tin Shui Wai. Two new towns have been developed within this district. Yuen Long New Town was developed from the traditional market town of Yuen Long Town from the late 1970s. Tin Shui Wai New Town has developed since the early 1990s, and is built on land reclaimed from former fish ponds once common in the district. ==History== Since the Tang Dynasty, the Tang's clan has been living in Pat Heung. Like Tai Po, Yuen Long used to be a traditional market town. ==Culture== ===Special festivals=== The Tin Hau Festival () is on the 23rd of the third month of the lunar calendar. It celebrates the birth of a local deity, Tin Hau. During the day, residents from various walled villages set off at Fung Cheung Road, go via Kau Yuk Road and the Yuen Long Stadium, and end at Tai Shu Ha Tin Hau Temple, which has a 300-year history. ===Cuisine=== * Poon choi () * Sweetheart cake () ==Popular scenic spots== ===Hong Kong Wetland Park=== Hong Kong Wetland Park Hong Kong Wetland Park () is located at the northern part of Tin Shui Wai. It was intended to be an ecological mitigation area (EMA) for the wetlands lost due to Tin Shui Wai New Town development. In 1998, a project named as \"International Wetland Park and Visitor Centre Feasibility Study\" was initiated by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and the Hong Kong Tourism Board with a view to expanding the EMA to a wetland ecotourism attraction. After concluding that it was feasible to develop a wetland park at the EMA site without compromising its intended ecological mitigation functions and the development of the Wetland Park will also enhance the ecological function of the EMA to a world- class conservation, education and tourism facility, the concerned parties started the Wetland Park Project, which is regarded as one of the Millennium projects by the Administrations. ===Kat Hing Wai=== Kat Hing Wai () in Kam Tin is one of the District's best-known walled villages. It is the ancestral home of the Tangs, one of the \"Five Great Clans\" in the territory. Built by the Tangs 500 years ago, it is a rectangular walled village with an area of 100 metres by 90 metres.

In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, pangolins, Chinese leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness. ===Yuen Long Park=== Aviary Pagoda () Yuen Long Park () is a park at Yuen Long Town with recreational facilities.
