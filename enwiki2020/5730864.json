Fussballdaten.de. Retrieved on 2013-10-27. Posipal was born to an ethnic German family in Lugoj, and lived much of his life in West Germany. During his club career he played for SV Linden 07, SV Arminia Hannover, and Hamburger SV.Jupp Posipal. Weltfussball.de. Retrieved on 2013-10-27. At the age of 16, Posipal's family relocated to Germany. In his youth his sportive activities focused on swimming and track-and-field as well as handball.Bitter, J\u00fcrgen. Deutschlands Fu\u00dfball Nationalspieler, Sportverlag, 1997, p. 368. In 1949 he joined Hamburger SV as then coach Georg Kn\u00f6pfle was looking for a forward. However Kn\u00f6pfle soon discovered that Posipal was a strong defender and withdrew him from attack to a half back position. Already a year later in 1950, West German national team coach Sepp Herberger intended to invite Posipal to join the squad for Germany's first international game after World War II, but officials found out that Posipal had a Romanian citizenship and no German. After he had become a West-German citizen in 1951, Posipal debuted in the international game against Turkey in West Berlin. In 1952, Posipal was moved from the right half back position to that of center half. In that position he was considered to be Germany's best during these years and one of the best in European football. In October 1953, he was invited to represent Europe in a game against England at Wembley Stadium. However, during the first round of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, Posipal had lost his form and after being injured for the quarterfinal against Yugoslavia, Kaiserslautern\u2019s Werner Liebrich played as center half instead of Posipal. Being fit again for the semifinal against Austria, Herberger brought Posipal back to the starting team, but since Liebrich had played exceptionally well against Yugoslavia, Posipal played as a right full back at the expense of Fritz Laband. Herberger's trust in Posipal despite his lack of form in previous games paid off as Posipal did very well in the semifinal and the final in the unusual new position. For the rest of his international career, Posipal kept playing as right back with Liebrich as the center half. He finished his football career in 1958. Posipal died at the age of 69 in Hamburg of heart failure. He was married to Gisela and had two sons with her. His son Peer Posipal, who played for the Bundesliga team Eintracht Braunschweig, is a former professional football player as well. His grandson Patrick Posipal is also a professional footballer. == References == Category:1927 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Lugoj Category:German footballers Category:Germany international footballers Category:1954 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:Association football defenders Category:SV Arminia Hannover players Category:Hamburger SV players Category:German people of German-Romanian descent ",
