A number of movies had been made on the episode, the first being a silent film by A. Narayanan in 1929. But the 1936 version in Tamil appears to be the first talkie made on the subject. The film was remade in Telugu by Ghantasala Balaramayya in the year 1943. The film was shot entirely in Pioneer Studios in Calcutta. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1936 films Category:Indian films Category:1930s Tamil- language films Category:Indian black-and-white films ",
