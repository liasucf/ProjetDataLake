    "text": "This is a list of cybersecurity information technology. Cybersecurity is security as it is applied to information technology. This includes all technology that stores, manipulates, or moves data, such as computers, data networks, and all devices connected to or included in networks, such as routers and switches. All information technology devices and facilities need to be secured against intrusion, unauthorized use, and vandalism. Additionally, the users of information technology should be protected from theft of assets, extortion, identity theft, loss of privacy and confidentiality of personal information, malicious mischief, damage to equipment, business process compromise, and the general activity of cybercriminals. The general public should be protected against acts of cyberterrorism, such as the compromise or loss of the electric power grid. Cybersecurity is a major endeavor of the IT industry. There are a number of professional certifications given for cybersecurity training and expertise. Although billions of dollars are spent annually on cybersecurity, no computer or network is immune from attacks or can be considered completely secure. The single most expensive loss due to a cybersecurity exploit was the ILOVEYOU or Love Bug email worm of 2000, which cost an estimated 8.7 billion American dollars. This article attempts to list all of the important Wikipedia articles about cybersecurity. There are a number of minor articles that can be reached by means of links in the listed articles. == General == Introductory articles about cybersecurity subjects: * Security * Computer security * Internet security * Network security * Information security, Data security * List of computer security certifications == Cryptography == The art of secret writing or code. A \"plaintext\" message is converted by the sender to \"ciphertext\" by means of a mathematical algorithm that uses a secret key. The receiver of the message then reverses the process and converts the ciphertext back to the original plaintext. * History of cryptography * Enigma machine * Alan Turing * Cipher * Substitution cipher * One-time pad * Beale ciphers * The Codebreakers * Cryptanalysis * Cryptographic primitive * Cryptographic Service Provider * Data Encryption Standard * Advanced Encryption Standard * International Data Encryption Algorithm * HMAC * HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm * Cryptographic hash function * Collision (computer science) * List of hash functions * Comparison of cryptographic hash functions * Hash-based cryptography * SHA-1 * SHA-2 * SHA-3 * SHA-3 competition * Cryptographic nonce * Salt (cryptography) * Cryptographic strength * Block cipher * Block cipher mode of operation * Stream cipher * Key (cryptography) * Key size * Cryptographic key types * Symmetric-key algorithm * Public-key cryptography * Public-Key Cryptography (conference) * Digital signature * Non-repudiation * Public key certificate * Certificate authority * X.509 * Public key fingerprint * RSA (cryptosystem) * Secret sharing * Internet key exchange * Pretty Good Privacy * Strong cryptography == Steganography == The art of hidden writing. The secret message is hidden within another object, such as a digital photograph. * Steganography * BPCS-Steganography * Steganography tools * Steganalysis * OpenPuff * Kristie Macrakis == Authentication and access == The process by which a potential client is granted authorized use of an IT facility by proving its identity. * Authentication * Login * Password * Passphrase * Password strength * One-time password * Multi-factor authentication * Identity management * Identity management theory * Identity management system * Encrypting PIN Pad * Shared secret * Authorization * Access control * Principle of least privilege * Cryptographic protocol * Authentication protocol * Public key infrastructure * RADIUS * Kerberos (protocol) * OpenID * OAuth * Active Directory Federation Services * Security Assertion Markup Language * SAML-based products and services == Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) == A framework for managing digital certificates and encryption keys. * public key infrastructure * X.509 * Root certificate * public key certificate * certificate authority * CAcert.org * electronic signature * certificate policy * Certificate Practice Statement * certificate revocation list * Online Certificate Status Protocol == Tools == Computerized utilities designed to study and analyze the security of IT facilities and/or break into them on an unauthorized and potentially criminal basis. * List of security assessment tools * Kali * Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks * Nessus (software) * Vulnerability scanner * Nessus Attack Scripting Language * OpenVAS * Yasca * Metasploit project * John the Ripper * Smeg Virus Construction Kit * Virus Creation Laboratory * Exploit kit == Threats == Modes of potential attacks on IT facilities. * Cyberattack * STRIDE (security) * Vulnerability (computing) * Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures * Privilege escalation * Social engineering (security) * Malware * Spyware * Backdoor (computing) * Computer virus * Computer worm * Macro virus * Keystroke logging * Trojan horse * Hardware Trojan * Eavesdropping * Zombie * Botnets * Advanced persistent threat * Man-in-the-middle attack * Man-on-the-side attack * Meet- in-the-middle attack * Length extension attack * Replay attack * Pre-play attack * Dictionary attack * Biclique attack * Denial-of-service attack * Resource exhaustion attack * Brute-force attack * Watermarking attack * Mangled packet * Reverse connection * Polymorphic code * Password cracking * Spoofing attack * POODLE == Exploits == Violations of IT facilities. * Exploit (computer security) * Timeline of computer viruses and worms * Comparison of computer viruses * Malware analysis * XML denial-of-service attack * Distributed denial-of-service attacks on root nameservers * Linux malware * Zero-day (computing) * Virus hoax * Pegasus * Rogue security software * List of rogue security software * MS Antivirus (malware) * AntiVirus Gold * Spysheriff * SpywareBot * TheSpyBot * ByteDefender * Security Essentials 2010 * Email spam * Phishing * Tiny Banker Trojan * Melissa (computer virus) * Brain (computer virus) * CIH (computer virus) * ILOVEYOU * Anna Kournikova (computer virus) * Michelangelo (computer virus) * Simile (computer virus) * Stoned (computer virus) * Acme (computer virus) * AIDS (computer virus) * AI (computer virus) * Cascade (computer virus) * Flame (computer virus) * Abraxas (computer virus) * 1260 (computer virus) * SCA (computer virus) * ReDoS * SYN flood * Billion laughs attack * UDP flood attack * Wi-Fi deauthentication attack * Smurf attack * Mydoom * IP address spoofing * Fork bomb * WinNuke == Criminal activity == Violation of the law by means of breaking into and/or misusing IT facilities.
