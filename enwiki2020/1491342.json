    "text": "Province of Quebec The Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912 is an Act passed by the Parliament of Canada on April 1, 1912, that expanded the territory of the Province of Quebec. It was supplemental to the Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898 that granted the province its first territorial enlargement. The Act transferred to the province the vast territory bounded by the Eastmain River, the Labrador coast, and Hudson and Ungava Bays, extending the northern boundary to its present location. These lands were inhabited by the aboriginal Cree, Montagnais, Naskapi, and Inuit. Canada and Newfoundland disagreed on the location of the frontier between Quebec and Labrador until 1927: see Labrador Boundary Dispute. ==External links== * Reproduction of The Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912 (at pages 239 to 241 of the PDF) printed in 1913 Category:Canadian federal legislation Category:Political history of Quebec Category:Borders of Quebec Category:1912 in Canadian law Category:1912 in Quebec ",
