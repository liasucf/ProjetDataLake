    "text": "The Airline Cooperative (ACO) is a membership organisation formed by a broad group of International Airlines, with the structure of a Cooperative Society. The pivotal aim of the Cooperative is to share non-competitive information, and work together to increase awareness of relevant safety and security concerns, improve efficiency, reduce costs, learn, and grow. http://www.theairlinecooperative.org/ As of March 2015, there were 147 airlines in the group. These airlines are located in 66 different countries worldwide, at 116 different airport base locations. ==Difference to traditional Trade Organisations== The Airline Cooperative is differentiated from existing airline groups like IATA, AEA, ERA, and so on, in that these are all primarily acting as Trade associations, with a vertical structure that focuses on Political Lobbying at the top. The Airline Cooperative instead focuses on peer-to-peer communication, with Airlines talking directly to each other on key focus areas such as Security, Flight Operations, Route information, Large-scale ATC and Weather events, Emergency Response Planning, and Ground Handling issues. ==History== The initial members of The Airline Cooperative came together in 2012, to run a beta-test involving sharing information across the Flight Operations departments of the member airlines.https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Open-new-Airline- members-2390043.S.5936125463230447617 In 2014, the group had expanded to 80 member airlines. http://www.theairlinecooperative.org/ In 2015, the group reached 140 member airlines and continues to grow. ==Members== In March 2015, a published map showed there to be: \\- 147 Airline members worldwide \\- 66 countries with Airline Cooperative airline members \\- 116 Airport bases with airlines taking part in the Cooperative ==References== ==External links== * Category:Airline trade associations Category:Organizations established in 2012 Category:Organisations based in Z\u00fcrich ",
