It provides law enforcement services for the county's road system, freeways in the county, the Milwaukee County Courthouse, the Milwaukee County Jail in downtown Milwaukee and House of Corrections in rural Franklin, the county-owned General Mitchell International Airport, and the Milwaukee County Parks system, including much of the Milwaukee lakefront.
