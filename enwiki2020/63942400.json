She described at least 1 family, 47 species and 4 subspecies of Mollusca. == Life == Mar\u00eda Isabel Hylton Scott was born on August 16, 1889 in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. Hylton Scott attended the Normal School (Escuela Normal), receiving a teacher degree in 1908. She continued her study at the National University of La Plata, where she obtained the title of professor in Pedagogy and Related Sciences in 1911. She studied under the guidance of Dr. Miguel Fern\u00e1ndez and his wife, Dr. Katy Marcinowsky-Fern\u00e1ndez who influenced her first scientific works. At the beginning of the World War I, she worked as an assistant in the Zoology laboratory at the Museo de La Plata in 1914. Later in 1916, Hylton Scott became the first women in Argentina to obtain a doctorate in Zoology. Her doctoral thesis was dedicated to the embryology of the viviparous freshwater fish, Fitzroyia lineata (now under Jenynsia, Characiformes: Jenyns\u00fcdae). She worked as a head of the Laboratory until 1924 and as a substitute professor from 1933 to 1946, returning to this position in 1955. Her university activity was interrupted due to the unstable political situation in Argentina. She participated in some investigational trips, such as to Puerto Madryn in 1916 and to Santa Cruz in 1936 with her husband Max Birab\u00e9n.

She retired at the age of 76 in 1965 and accompanied her husband to Buenos Aires, where he was designated Director of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales. She continued her scientific studies in the field of zoology, publishing five new works from 1977 to 1984. In 1977, at the age of 88, she received an honorable medal on the 100th anniversary of the Museo de La Plata.
