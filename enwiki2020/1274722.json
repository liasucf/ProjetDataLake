    "text": "Exposed is the first live album by English musician Mike Oldfield, released as a double album in July 1979 by Virgin Records. It was recorded at various locations across Europe during the Tour of Europe 1979, Oldfield's debut concert tour as a solo artist that was staged following the release of his fifth studio album Incantations (1978). The album features Incantations and his debut album Tubular Bells (1973) performed in their entirety, plus Oldfield's 1979 non-album single \"Guilty\" as the encore. Exposed was initially marketed as a restricted release with just 100,000 copies produced, but strong sales prompted Virgin Records to give the album a full release. It peaked at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart and earned a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry for selling 60,000 copies. A concert film of the shows at the Wembley Conference Centre during the 1979 tour were released on DVD in October 2005, also entitled Exposed. ==Background== A double CD version was later released. A DVD version of the concert, recorded at Wembley Conference Centre, was released in 2005. Initially during the tour the concerts were being recorded without the knowledge of the musicians, so that they could be paid less money; for just a performance and not a recording, the musicians found out, but the recordings went ahead and the album was produced. The artwork is linked to the title, as it shows a frame of film containing a photo of Oldfield in a concert arena. Among the choir singers were members of the Queen's College, London choir. The album was recorded using The Manor Studio's Mobile unit, and mixed at The Town House, London. The double vinyl album was released in 4 channel quadraphonic sound using the SQ Quadraphonic encoding system. This was one of the last quadraphonic albums released. == Reissues == Exposed has been reissued a number of times including a HDCD reissue by Virgin Records in 2000. the album has not been reissued on CD or digitally by Mercury Records, however other reissued albums include different live recordings from the same period as Exposed. This comes as part of a deal in which Oldfield's Virgin albums were transferred to Universal's label. With the exception of this record and The Orchestral Tubular Bells, all Oldfield's other 1970s albums have been reissued by Mercury Records on CD. However, a re- issue of Exposed by Universal Music Group on heavyweight vinyl has been announced for release on 2 December 2016 on the same day as a vinyl reissue of the Collaborations disc from Oldfield's Boxed compilation. == Track listing == === Side one === # \"Incantations (Parts 1 & 2)\" (Mike Oldfield) \u2013 26:30 === Side two === # \"Incantations (Parts 3 & 4)\" (Mike Oldfield) \u2013 20:50 === Side three === # \"Tubular Bells (Part 1)\" (Mike Oldfield) \u2013 28:36 === Side four === # \"Tubular Bells (Part 2)\" (Mike Oldfield, except \"The Sailor's Hornpipe\") \u2013 11:09 # \"Guilty\" (Mike Oldfield) \u2013 6:22 == Personnel == * Mike Oldfield \u2013 guitars, producer * Nico Ramsden \u2013 guitars * Phil Beer \u2013 guitar, vocals * Pekka Pohjola \u2013 bass guitar * Pierre Moerlen \u2013 drums, percussion * Mike Frye \u2013 percussion * Benoit Moerlen \u2013 percussion * David Bedford \u2013 percussion, string arrangements * Ringo McDonough \u2013 bodhr\u00e1n * Pete Lemer \u2013 keyboards * Tim Cross \u2013 keyboards * Maddy Prior \u2013 vocals * Ray Gay \u2013 trumpets * Ralph Izen \u2013 trumpets * Simo Salminen \u2013 trumpets * Colin Moore \u2013 trumpets * Sebastian Bell \u2013 flutes * Chris Nicholls \u2013 flutes * Orchestral Leader - Richard Studt - violin * Benedict Cruft - violin * Elizabeth Edwards - violin * Jane Price - violin * Nichola Hurton - violin * Jonathan Kahan - violin * Donald McVay \u2013 viola * Pauline Mack \u2013 viola * Danny Daggers \u2013 viola * Melinda Daggers \u2013 viola * Liz Butler \u2013 viola * Ross Cohen \u2013 violins * Nigel Warren-Green \u2013 Cello * Vanessa Park \u2013 cello * David Bucknall \u2013 cello * Jessica Ford \u2013 cello * Nick Worters \u2013 bass * Joe Kirby \u2013 bass * Debra Bronstein \u2013 choir * Marigo Acheson \u2013 choir * Emma Freud \u2013 choir * Diana Coulson \u2013 choir * Mary Elliott \u2013 choir * Mary Creed \u2013 choir * Cecily Hazell \u2013 choir * Wendy Lampitt \u2013 choir * Clara Harris \u2013 choir * Emma Smith \u2013 choir * Catherine Loewe \u2013 choir * Philp R.
