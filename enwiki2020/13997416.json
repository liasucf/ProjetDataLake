These groups may refer to themselves as militia, unorganized militia,Mulloy, Darren (2004) American Extremism: History, Politics and the Militia Movement, Routledge. and constitutional militia.Williams, David C. (2003) The mythic meanings of the Second Amendment: taming political violence in a constitutional republic. Yale University Press. p. 363. While groups such as the Posse Comitatus existed as early as the 1980s, the movement gained momentum after standoffs with government agents in the early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, such groups were active in all 50 US states, with membership estimated at between 20,000 and 60,000.Berlet, Chip & Lyons, Matthew (2000). Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort, Guilford. ==History== Although the far-right patriot movement had long been a fringe factor in American politics, cultural factors paved the way for the wide-scale growth of the ideological militia movement. The catalysts came with the FBI's 1992 shootout with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, and the 1993 Waco siege involving David Koresh and the Branch Davidians at Mt. Carmel in Waco, Texas.Rise Of Citizen Militias: Angry White Guys With Guns Daniel Junas CovertAction Quarterly April 24, 1995Morris Dees, Gathering Storm: America's Militia Threat.

During the 1990s public attention to the militia movement began to grow. The Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the Waco fire, drew nationwide attention to the militia movement as Timothy McVeigh was associated with the Michigan Militia, having possibly attended meetings before the attack. This increased public scrutiny and law enforcement pressure, and brought in more recruits due to the heightened awareness of the movement.Militia Nation Chip Berlet and Matthew N. Lyons Progressive Magazine In March 1996, agents of the FBI and other law enforcement organizations surrounded the eastern Montana \"Justus Township\" compound of the Montana Freemen. The Freemen were a Sovereign Citizen group that included elements of the Christian Identity ideology, espoused common law legal theories, and rejected the legitimacy of the Federal Reserve. Montana legislator Carl Ohs mediated through the standoff. Both Randy Weaver (one of the besieged at Ruby Ridge) and Bo Gritz (a civilian negotiator at Ruby Ridge) had attempted to talk to the group but had given up in frustration, as did Colorado Senator Charlie Duke when he had attempted negotiations.Freemen surrender peacefully to FBI Cable News Network June 14, 1996 A break finally came when far right leaders abandoned the group to their fate.Freemen Were Alone New York Times June 15, 1996 The group surrendered peacefully after an 81-day standoff and 14 of the Freemen faced criminal charges relating to circulating millions of dollars in bogus checks and threatening the life of a federal judge. The peaceful resolution of this and other standoffs after Ruby Ridge and Waco have been credited by some to the creation of the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) in the U.S. Department of Justice in 1994.Christopher Whitcomb, Cold Zero: Inside the FBI Hostage Rescue Team. . (Covers Ruby Ridge, Waco Siege and creation of CIRG.) A 1999 US Department of Justice analysis of the potential militia threat at the millennium conceded that the vast majority of militias were reactive (not proactive) and posed no threat.United States Department of Justice, \"Operation Megiddo\", November 2, 1999, page 22; cited in Robert H. Churchill, \"Arming for the Last Battle: Secular and Religious Millennial Impulses within the Militia Movement\", 1999 Annual Conference of the Center for Millennial Studies, Boston University, Boston, MA, November 9, 1999. By 2001, the militia movement seemed to be in decline, having peaked in 1996 with 858 groups. With the post-2007 global financial crisis and the election of Barack Obama to the United States presidency in 2008, militia activity experienced a resurgence. Militia groups have recently been involved in several high-profile standoffs, including the Bundy Standoff in 2014 and the Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. ===Legal legitimacy=== Most militia organizations envisage themselves as legally legitimate organizations, despite the fact that all 50 states prohibit private paramilitary activity. Others subscribe to the \"insurrection theory\" which describes the right of the body politic to rebel against the established government in the face of tyranny. (In the 1951 case Dennis v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the insurrection theory, stating that as long as the government provides for free elections and trials by jury, \"political self-defense\" cannot be undertaken.) ===Opposition to the government=== While militia organizations vary in their ideologies and objectives, with many high profile organizations espousing anti-tax, anti- immigration, survivalist, sovereign citizen, libertarian, land rights and southern restoration views, they generally share a common belief in the imminent or actual rise of a tyrannical government in the United States which, they believe, must be confronted through armed force. Some believe in the New World Order conspiracy theory.The Hate Map Of America - Interview with Mark Potok, investigative reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center ==Active militia groups== The Southern Poverty Law Center identified 334 militia groups at a peak in 2011.
