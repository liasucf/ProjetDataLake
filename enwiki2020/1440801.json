    "text": "Windows code page 1253 (\"Greek - ANSI\"), commonly known by its IANA-registered name Windows-1253 or abbreviated as cp1253, is a Microsoft Windows code page used to write modern Greek. It is not capable of supporting the older polytonic Greek. It is not fully compatible with ISO 8859-7 because a few characters, including the letter \u0386, are located at different byte values: * `\u00b5` and `\u00b6` are added at their locations from Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1 (0xB5 and 0xB6). This collides with the locations of `\u0385` and `\u0386`, respectively, in ISO 8859-7. * `\u2018` and `\u2019` are moved from their ISO 8859-7 locations (0xA1 and 0xA2) to their Windows-1252 locations (0x91 and 0x92). The displaced `\u0385` and `\u0386` are moved to the vacated space at 0xA1 and 0xA2 respectively. * `\u00a4` and `\u00a5` are added at their locations from Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1 (0xA4 and 0xA5). This collides with additions made to ISO 8859-7 in 2003, when `\u20ac` and `\u20af` respectively were added to the same locations. The `\u20ac` was added to Windows-1253 at 0x80, the same location which it was added to in Windows-1252. An iota subscript (\u037a) was also added to ISO 8859-7 at 0xAA; this remains unallocated in Windows-1253. * Several further characters are added at their Windows-1252 locations, although the rest do not collide with ISO 8859-7. IBM uses code page 1253 (CCSID 1253 and euro sign extended CCSID 5349) for Windows-1253. Unicode is preferred for Greek in modern applications, especially as UTF-8 encoding on the Internet. Unicode provides many more glyphs for complete coverage, see Greek alphabet in Unicode and Ancient Greek Musical Notation for tables. ==Character set== The following table shows Windows-1253.
