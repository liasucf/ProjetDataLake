    "text": "Journey in North America (original Hungarian title: Utaz\u00e1s \u00c9szak-Amerik\u00e1ban) is a book by S\u00e1ndor B\u00f6l\u00f6ni Farkas published in 1834. The author, travelling in the United States of America (New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland and New Jersey) and in Canada (Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario) paid special attention to the social relations of these countries, which he put as an example to the feudalistic Hungary of that time. The book was a big success in the Hungarian Reform Era, being read by the young reformers of the parliament of 1832\u201336 at Pozsony. Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi expressed his thanks to the author in a letter, calling his work the most useful and most beautiful gift. In 1835 the book was banned and could be read only by special permission. The book inspired several young reformers (Ferenc Pulszky, \u00c1goston Trefort, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szalay, P\u00e1l Hunfalvy, Bertalan Szemere, Istv\u00e1n Gorove, L\u0151rinc T\u00f3th, J\u00f3zsef Irinyi) to travel and to write about their experiencies abroad. == Publication == In 1830\u20131831 the author, as the secretary of count Ferenc B\u00e9ldi, traveled to Western Europe, the United States of America, and Canada. He prepared for the trip by reading up on the geography, economy and laws of the respective countries, and he studied their languages. In his book he cites about fifty of the journals, books, statistical publications and political writings he read before and during his journey.Jancs\u00f3 1942: p. 420\u2011434.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2012: p. 424. After his return, he finished his book at the end of 1833 and beginning of 1834, and sent it to his friends G\u00e1bor D\u00f6brentei and Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi. On the advice of friends, he tried to publish it in Leipzig, but on December 20, 1833, he got the answer that the German censors were told to stop at the border every Hungarian book published abroad, to examine it, and give it back to the owner only if the content was not subject to censorship. As this procedure could take more than half a year, it represented a financial risk to the publisher who did not want to tie up his capital and risk losing it.Jancs\u00f3 1942: p. 434\u2013435. Therefore, the author asked permission from the Transylvanian censorship office which he considered more lenient. The censorship office asked the opinion of S\u00e1muel M\u00e9hes, a Calvinist professor, who after reading the book asked that an additional censor be appointed. The Catholic bishop Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs responsible for the censorship named the Catholic abbot J\u00e1nos Szab\u00f3 from the Kolozsmonostor Abbey. These two censors deleted some parts of the text and declared the work eligible to be published.Tardy 1986: p. 535\u2013536. On April 24, 1834, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni Farkas agreed with the bookseller J\u00e1nos Tilsch to publish the book with the following conditions: the fee for the author would be 260 silver forints, half of which payable at the beginning of printing, the other half at the end of it \u2013 latest in August; maximum 1,100 copies could be printed, of which 25 were to be given to the author; the book could not be sold for a price higher than two forints; and the name of the author could not be posted outside the bookshop.Jakab 1870: p. 297. The printing was executed between 30 June and 25 July 1834, and for the second edition between 2 and 23 March 1835.Tardy 1986: p. 534. In September 1835 the Government of Transylvania received the list of prohibited books in which the work of B\u00f6l\u00f6ni Farkas was classified as \"readable only by special permission.\" The author commented in his diary: \"Great honour for my work! After all, it might contain something which had an effect. But it's too late - I assume the poison has had its effect, and it will only be worse with the prohibition.\"Jakab 1870: p. 295.; B\u00f6l\u00f6ni 1971: p. 89\u201390 Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este, governor of Transylvania, started an investigation on 26 April 1836 at the command of the Habsburg emperor to determine how the publishing of the work had been possible under the control of the Transylvanian Censorship. Bishop Mikl\u00f3s Kov\u00e1cs argued that the prohibition arrived only on 25 November 1835 and the censors were informed on 11 December about it. Professor S\u00e1muel M\u00e9hes stated that he executed several deletions in the text and the final approval was given by the censorship office. Abbot J\u00e1nos Szab\u00f3 excused himself saying that he read only the parts proposed for deletion by professor M\u00e9hes and on that basis gave his opinion to the office. The investigation had no consequence to the author.Jakab 1870: p. 295.; Tardy 1986: p. 533\u2013538. == Content == The approximative route The first two chapters describe briefly the travel to Western Europe and the crossing of the ocean. From the third chapter on, the events of the journey are presented together with the description and history of the notable places visited, and a specific social or economical issue. Several statistical data are presented as well. The author constantly compares the United States with his own country; for example when arriving in New York City he realizes two important differences: no passport needed to enter the States and the customs officer accepts the declaration of the traveller and does not check the luggage. The description is completed in some cases by the translation of documents: chapter 8 contains the Declaration of Independence, chapter 13 the Constitution of New Hampshire, and chapter 25 Article Two of the United States Constitution. The content of each chapter is shown in the table below. The 29th (last) chapter describes the trip back to Europe. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Chapter !! State !! Place !! Sights !!

The praise of American society is at once a critique of the Hungarian one. B\u00f6l\u00f6ni Farkas attributes great importance to public education, to the press and non-governmental organizations.Feny\u0151 1964: p. 604.; S\u0151t\u00e9r 1964: vol III. p. 575.; Gell\u00e9n 1976: p. 29. and 34\u201335. In some cases B\u00f6l\u00f6ni included his own liberal thoughts as if they were translations, probably to evade censorship. An example is the speech on the freedom of religion attributed in chapter 18 to President Monroe. In several cases he showed his republicanist views. He considered strange the utopian socialist experiment of the Harmony Society in Economy, Pennsylvania, but appreciated the altruism which created it.S\u0151t\u00e9r 1964: vol. III. p. 575.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2011: p. 211.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2012: p. 428. He attacked slavery vehemently and had bitter words about the treatment of the indigenous people. Similar to Tocqueville, he arrived at the conclusion that freeing the slaves in the future would result in racial conflicts.S\u0151t\u00e9r 1964: vol. III. p. 575.; Gell\u00e9n 1976: p. 36\u201338 == Style == The part about Europe is like a diary characterized by the chronological enumeration of the facts, while the American part is dominated by a thematic approach for which the author made use of several sources of statistical data.Maller 1984: p. 85.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2012: p. 423. The style of the book is characterized by the flexibility of the live speech. In an effort to meet readers' expectations he did not use foreign words, replacing them in some cases with Hungarian expressions of his own invention. Next to expressions describing things specific to America, he showed the original English names in parentheses.Jancs\u00f3 1942: p. 424.; Maller 1984: p. 85\u201386.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2012: p. 426. The descriptions are sometimes colored by romantic elements (e.g., the Falls of the Braan in Scotland, the storm on the ocean, Niagara Falls).Maller 1984: p. 58.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2012: p. 427. Speaking about American society his style is enthusiastic.Gell\u00e9n 1976: p. 28. == Reactions == The book was a huge success: the 1,100 copies of the first edition were soon sold out, and in short time it had another two editions. In the library of the Kolozsv\u00e1r Unitarian College, which was open to the public as well, it was the most borrowed book. It was read by the students at the Eastern Catholic theological seminary in Bal\u00e1zsfalva as well. The journal Jelenkor published the part about George Washington and his home, and recommended the book to the readers in a special note. On 10 September 1834 Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi wrote a letter to the author, in which he called the Journey his most useful and most beautiful gift, and expressed his thanks to the author for it. For the politicians of the Hungarian Reform Era it served as a handbook; among others Lajos Kossuth was reading it, and it was widely known by the young reformers of the 1832\u201336 parliament at Pozsony. A bit later the young Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n knew it almost by heart.S\u0151t\u00e9r 1964: vol. III. p. 574.; Mik\u00f3 1976: p. 429.; Szabolcsi 1979: vol. I. p. 379.; Maller 1984: p. 79\u201380.; Lak\u00f3 1996: p. 60.; Ber\u00e9nyi 2004: p. 118.; Simon-Szab\u00f3 2011: p. 209. On 8 November 1834 the author was elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and in 1835 he was given the Academic Prize for the best book of the year.Jakab 1870: p. 298. From the few contemporary critics, Canon K\u00e1roly Somogyi took exception not to the book itself but the ideas of the religious sects presented in it. In 1842 the advocate Istv\u00e1n \u00c9ll\u00e1ssy attacked the author, asking \"how far will the nation be dragged by the venom of reformism if the followers of the vainglorious North American traveler are permitted to impact the essence of the country's laws?\"Maller 1984: p. 83. The travel of B\u00f6l\u00f6ni Farkas \u2011 together with the travel of Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi to England in 1822 \u2011 encouraged several young reformers to travel and to write about their experiences abroad Ferenc Pulszky (Uti v\u00e1zolatok, 1836), \u00c1goston Trefort (Utaz\u00e1si t\u00f6red\u00e9kek, 1836), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szalay (Uti napl\u00f3mb\u00f3l, 1839), P\u00e1l Hunfalvy (Drezdai levelek, 1839), Bertalan Szemere (Utaz\u00e1s k\u00fclf\u00f6ld\u00f6n, 1840), Istv\u00e1n Gorove (Nyugat, 1844), L\u0151rinc T\u00f3th (Uti t\u00e1rcza, 1844), J\u00f3zsef Irinyi (N\u00e9met-, francia- \u00e9s angolorsz\u00e1gi \u00fati jegyzetek, 1846). They primarily described the social, legal and economical systems and not the geography or art history of the respective countries.S\u0151t\u00e9r 1964: vol. III. p. 576\u2013578.; Szabolcsi 1979: vol. I. p. 510\u2013512. After its initial success, the book was republished only one hundred years later, in 1935, followed by three additional editions, the last one appearing in 1984 in 8,500 copies. == Editions == * Utaz\u00e1s \u00c9szak-Amerik\u00e1ban.
