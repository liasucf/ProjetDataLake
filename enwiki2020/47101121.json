    "text": "Issa Alekasir Rajabi (, born 7 February 1990) is an Iranian footballer who plays as a striker for Persepolis in the Persian Gulf Pro League. He is known for his headers and strength. ==Club career== Alekasir joined Paykan after promoting with Esteghlal Ahvaz to Azadegan League in summer 2012. He spent a poor season with Paykan where he played 12 times without scoring a goal. In summer 2013 he joined to Albadr Bandar Kong. After Albadr Bandar Kong's relegation to Iran Football's 2nd Division in 2014, he joined Aluminium Hormozgan. After shining with his new club, he had offers from Foolad and Naft Tehran in mid-season, he tagged a 3 billion R (about US$80,000) fee which declined by both Pro League sides. He finished season with 11 goals and named as Best goal scorer of 2014\u201315 Azadegan League. ===Naft Tehran=== On 28 June 2015, he joined Naft Tehran with a three-years contract as a free agent. ===Return to Paykan=== In June 2018, he rejoined Paykan, where he played for one season. ===Sanat Naft Abadan=== Alekasir scored 12 goals in the 2019\u201320 season with Sanat Naft Abadan. ===Persepolis=== On 1 September 2020, Alekasir signed a two-year contract with Persian Gulf Pro League champions Persepolis. On 24 September, he scored his first goal for Persepolis in a 4\u20130 win over Sharjah in the 2020 AFC Champions League group stage. On 27 September, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 win over Al Sadd in the Champions League round of 16. On 30 September, he scored two goals in a 2\u20130 win against Pakhtakor in the Champions League quarter-finals. Afterwards, the AFC suspended Alekasir for 6 months because his goal celebration in the game was ruled to be a \"discriminatory gesture\". He has made this slant-eyed gesture during games before. ==Club career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Division !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=2|League !colspan=2|Hazfi Cup !colspan=2|Asia !colspan=2|Total |- !
