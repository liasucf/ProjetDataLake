It was recorded live by Geoff Bullock, Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team. In 2000 the album was certified gold by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35000 units. The majority of the songs for the album were written and composed by Geoff Bullock, the then Worship Pastor of Hillsong Church. ==Album design== The Power of Your Love was designed by a local design firm in Sydney, Australia. The Font used for the title is Century Gothic (a standard font on most Microsoft Computers). The front cover photograph is a panograph taken by Christian photographer; Ken Duncan. His panographs are seen on three other Hillsong album covers. There are no photographs of the actual live service in the original CD sleeve design. The updated version shows \"what's new from Hillsong Music Australia\". ==Reception== In June 1993, Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms rated the album as 7 out of 10 and described the group as willing to \"take on the full hard rocking armoury of AOR to shout praises to God\". He summarised the album with \"What they lack in subtlety they make up for in exuberance ... Recommended to radical worshippers\". ==Track listing== #\"The Time Has Come\" (Geoff Bullock) #\"We Will Rise\" (Bullock) #\"You Placed Your Love\" (Bullock) #\"Your Love\" (Bullock) #\"Blessed Be\" (Bullock) #\"You Are My Rock\" (Bullock) #\"Hear Me Calling\" (Bullock) #\"Refresh My Heart\" (Bullock) #\"The Power of Your Love\" (Bullock) #\"Lord We Come\" (Bullock) #\"I Will Worship You\" (Bullock) #\"You Are My God\" (Bullock & Gail Dunshea) #\"Holy Spirit Rise\" (Bullock) #\"Glory\" (Bullock) #\"Latter Rain\" (Bullock) #\"The Great Southland\" (Bullock) ==Credits== *Geoff Bullock - worship pastor, piano, vocals *Russell Fragar - keyboards, music director *Darlene Zschech - vocals, vocal producer *David Evans - vocals *David Moyse - guitar *Allan Chard - guitar *Andy James - bass *Adam Simek - drums *Stuart Fell - percussion *Jeff Todd - engineer, mixer *Andrew McPherson - assistant engineer *William Bowden - mastering *Cameron Wade - production manager *Nick Asha - front of house Manager *Chris Googe - foldback engineer *Brian Houston - executive producer *Michael Murphy - executive producer ==References== Category:1992 live albums Category:Contemporary worship music albums Category:Hillsong Music live albums ",
