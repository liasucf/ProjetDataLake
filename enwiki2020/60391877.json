    "text": "iMazing is mobile device management software that allows users to transfer files and data between iOS devices (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) and macOS or Windows computers. ==History== Created by DigiDNA, the software was initially released in 2008 as DiskAid, enabling users to transfer data and files from the iPhone or iPod Touch to Mac or Windows computers. DiskAid was renamed iMazing in 2014. Version 2.0 was released on September 13, 2016. ==Description== With iMazing, an iPhone or iPad can be used similarly to an external hard drive. It performs tasks that iTunes doesn\u2019t offer, including incremental backups of iOS devices, browsing and exporting text and voicemail messages, managing apps, encryption, and migrating data from an old phone to a new one. The menu bar app iMazing Mini enables automatic, wireless and encrypted backups of iPhones. The iMazing HEIC Converter is a free desktop app for Mac and PC that lets users convert photos from HEIC format to JPG or PNG. ==See also== * iTunes * Apple Configurator ==References== Category:2008 software Category:IOS software Category:Windows software Category:Mobile applications Category:Data management software ",
