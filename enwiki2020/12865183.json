    "text": "Clarence Barone (July 26, 1963) is an American football coach who is the tight ends coach for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). ==Coaching career== Barone coached as the offensive line coach for the Denver Broncos in 2010, as well as from 2015\u20132016. As the Offensive Line Coach for the Denver Broncos, his offensive line paved the way to victory in Super Bowl 50 over the Carolina Panthers. He also served as the Broncos' tight ends coach in 2009, as well as the 2011\u20132014 seasons, which includes their Offensive record breaking season of 2013 and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVIII. He has also served as offensive line and tight ends coach for the Atlanta Falcons, as well as tight ends coach for the San Diego Chargers. Barone worked with All- Pro players Alge Crumpler (Falcons) and Antonio Gates (Chargers), and Julius Thomas (Broncos) all of whom made multiple Pro Bowl appearances under his guidance. Kyle Rudolph (Vikings) also was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 2017 season. This feat marked the first time in NFL history that a Tight Ends coach had four players selected to Pro Bowls with four teams. In addition, Barone also coached multiple Pro Bowl caliber players as the Offensive Line coach for the Denver Broncos, including; Ryan Clady, Zane Beadles, Louis Vasquez, Matt Paradis and Evan Mathis. Barone coached teams that led the NFL in rushing four times. Along with that the 2015 Broncos rushing attack was hampered by multiple injuries in the early part of the season but rebounded to lead the NFL in rushing from week 6 thru the end of the season. The 2016 season saw the Broncos again dominate the NFL in rushing for the first part of the season before injuries forced three running backs onto the injured reserved list. Prior to coaching the Falcons, Barone had coached offensive lines at seven colleges for 17 years. On February 7, 2016, Barone was the Offensive Line coach for the Broncos that won Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24\u201310. After Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak stepped down in January 2017, Barone was not retained by new head coach, Vance Joseph. Barone was hired that same month to serve as the tight ends coach for the Minnesota Vikings. In 2018, following the sudden death of offensive line coach Tony Sparano, Barone was moved to Offensive Line coach. After spending the 2019 season out of coaching, Barone was hired by the Chicago Bears as their tight ends coach on January 9, 2020. ==Personal life== Barone has three children: Gianna, Stefano, and Isabella./photo/1 ==References== ==External links== * Denver Broncos bio Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Atlanta Falcons coaches Category:Denver Broncos coaches Category:Eastern Illinois Panthers football coaches Category:Houston Cougars football coaches Category:Sacramento State Hornets football coaches Category:Sacramento State Hornets football players Category:San Diego Chargers coaches Category:Texas A&M; Aggies football coaches Category:Texas State Bobcats football coaches Category:Wyoming Cowboys football coaches Category:American River Beavers football coaches Category:People from San Andreas, California Category:National Football League replacement players Category:Minnesota Vikings coaches Category:Chicago Bears coaches ",
