    "text": "Il Postino is an opera in three acts by Daniel Cat\u00e1n with a Spanish libretto by the composer. Based on the novel Ardiente paciencia by Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta and the film Il Postino by Michael Radford, the work contains elements of drama and comedy, integrating themes of love and friendship along with political and spiritual conflict. The opera premiered at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion by Los Angeles Opera on 23 September 2010. Set on a small Italian island, exiled Chilean poet Pablo Neruda receives so much fan mail that a personal postman, Mario Ruoppolo, is hired to deliver his letters. Mario, smitten by Beatrice Russo, turns to Pablo for help writing poetry that would help him win the heart of the woman he longs for. Soon after, Mario and the barmaid fall in love and wed. In the third act, influenced by Pablo's works, Mario begins writing political poems and while reciting at a communist demonstration, violence breaks out and he receives a gunshot wound, killing him. Il Postino was commissioned by Los Angeles Opera who co-produced the premiere production with the Theater an der Wien in Vienna and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. Daniel Cat\u00e1n wrote the role of Pablo Neruda for Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who sang it at the Los Angeles premiere and in subsequent performances in Vienna and Paris.Swed, Mark (24 September 2010). \"Opera review: L.A.

His route to creating the work began when he first saw the 1994 film Il Postino and thought it would make a good opera. However, at the time he was in the midst of composing Florencia en el Amazonas and then received a commission from Houston Grand Opera for his fourth opera Salsipuedes which premiered in 2004. After completing that work, he returned to the Postino project. In an interview shortly before the premiere Cat\u00e1n said: > It's rare that an idea I had 15 years ago resurfaces, then I take it on, > because one changes so much in that time. But when I came back to this idea, > in fact I was still interested in it, but for different reasons. Instead of > identifying with the Mario character, with the young aspiring poet, in fact > now I could see the story from the other point of view, which was of the > older poet.Mangan, Timothy (21 September 2010). \"'Il Postino' becomes an > opera\". Orange County Register. Retrieved 6 October 2016. Discussions with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo who had become the General Director of Los Angeles Opera in 2003 led to a commission from the company which was announced in 2005. The premiere was to have taken place in the 2009 season starring Domingo as the poet Neruda and Rolando Villaz\u00f3n as Mario. However, financial difficulties at Los Angeles Opera caused the postponement of the premiere until the following season. In the interim, Villaz\u00f3n, who was recovering from surgery on his vocal chords, withdrew from the production and was eventually replaced by Charles Castronovo.Pasles, Chris (23 July 2005). \"'Il Postino' opera is in the works\".

The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles where Il Postino had its world premiere The opera finally premiered on 23 September 2010 as the opening production of the 2010 season. It was conducted by Grant Gershon and directed by Ron Daniels with sets and costumes designed by Riccardo Hernandez. The staging also included projections designed by Philip Bussmann that created a Mediterranean atmosphere and at various points showed old footage of political unrest in Chile and a blackboard with poetry written on it. Following the premiere, the Chilean government conferred the on Daniel Cat\u00e1n, Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s who sang the role of Neruda's wife Matilde.Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes, Gobierno de Chile (24 September 2010). \"En estreno mundial de Il Postino: Ministro de Cultura entreg\u00f3 Orden al M\u00e9rito Pablo Neruda\".

He also sang the role when the production travelled to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris in June 2011 and to Santiago, Chile, in July 2012.Boehm, Mike (16 July 2012). \"Placido Domingo wins raves as 'Il Postino' goes home to Chile\".

The Boston Globe via Associated Press. Retrieved 6 October 2016. The actor Massimo Troisi, who played the title role in the film and died shortly after it was completed, owned the rights to the screenplay and had willed them to his five siblings. Once Cat\u00e1n had decided on the Postino project, he visited each of them personally to secure the adaptation rights rather than relying on lawyers. According to Cat\u00e1n's son, he had almost completely formulated the characterisations of the principal singers before he began the actual composition, and the libretto manuscripts contained relatively few revisions.Stearns, David Patrick (17 April 2011). \"Daniel Cat\u00e1n obituary \". The Guardian. Retrieved 6 October 2016. The entirely fictional story of Neruda and his postman is told in both the film and Sk\u00e1rmeta's novel. However, there are several key differences between the novel and both the film and the opera. Ardiente paciencia is set in Chile during the rise and fall of the Allende Government in the early 1970s with Neruda and his wife Matilde living in their house at Isla Negra, on the Chilean coast. The film and opera move the locale from Chile to a fictional Italian island and the time to the early 1950s. Although Neruda and Matilde (who were not yet married) did sojourn to Italy during his exile from Chile and stayed on the Isle of Capri on-and-off between 1951 and 1952, they were guests in Edwin Cerio's villa there and did not have their own house. At that time Neruda had not yet achieved the world-wide fame as a poet that he had by the early 1970s when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\"Neruda\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. Retrieved 6 October 2016. The poems quoted in both the film and the opera were written several years after he returned to Chile. In the opera, Neruda's act 1 aria \"Desnuda\" uses the text from \"Ma\u00f1ana XXVII\" in Cien Sonetos de Amor which was first published in 1959.Hodgson, Irene B.

Like all of Cat\u00e1n's previous operas, the libretto was in Spanish. In a 2008 essay published in Revista de Musicolog\u00eda, he wrote of his dream to establish a strong tradition of Spanish-language opera, which was still lacking in both Spain and Latin America. At the time, he was working on the libretto for Il Postino and wrote: > Is it not ironic, for example, that it has been the Italian cinema that > rescued Neruda with Il Postino? I will now take back Il Postino. I will make > it into an opera and will restore our language to it. Why rescue when we can > create?Cat\u00e1n, Daniel (June 2008). \"\u00d3pera en espa\u00f1ol.

The language choice drew a mixed reaction from the critics. The Los Angeles Times critic found it \"peculiar\" given the Italian setting. Ronald Blum writing for the Associated Press thought the mismatch was \"a bit jarring\" but found that the effect dissipated as the opera unfolded. The critic for the British magazine Opera wrote \"The only real problem is that Cat\u00e1n, for some inexplicable reason, keeps the story set in Italy-despite writing the opera in Spanish. [...] Likewise, Sk\u00e1rmeta's novel is set not in Italy but on an island off the coast of Chile. Where was the dramaturge during all of this?\"Taylor, James C.

Duet: \"Querido Don Pablo\" (Mario's Farewell) Pablo is given a recording of Mario. In the recording Mario thanks Pablo for bringing poetry into his life. ==Critical reception== The critics writing on both the American and the Austrian premieres remarked on the \"unapologetically\" melodious nature of the score and noted that it was reminiscent of Puccini, both in the instrumental colors of the orchestral interludes and in the arias, singling out particularly the writing for the woodwinds and strings. In his review of the Austrian premiere George Loomis wrote that like Cat\u00e1n's previous operas, the score was marked by a \"musical shapeliness\" and a \"capacity to soar and [...] move the listener.\" He also summarized the mixed critical reception in the German and Austrian press noting that the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung pronounced it \"a triumph\" but Die Presse described the opera's story as \"smothered in operatic sugar-icing\", with more than one review describing it as kitsch. Anne Midgette wrote in The Washington Post that \"the language spoken by Cat\u00e1n's lovely score is universal: the safely melodious terrain of international opera.\" It was a view echoed by Joshua Kosman in the San Francisco Chronicle who described the opera as a \"lovely though limited\" work and wrote that \"operagoers who complain that they don't write 'em like they used to can take comfort from Il Postino\".Kosman, Joshua (25 September 2010). \"Opera review: L.A.
