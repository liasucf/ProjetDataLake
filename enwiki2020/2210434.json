Though it uses the KTW callsign in its marketing materials, KTRW is not related to the original Seattle radio station KTW which was at 1250 kHz and is now called KKDZ.www.seatacmedia.com/?p=4438. The station is owned by the Mutual Broadcasting System, LLC (owned by Thomas Read, owner of KSPO), which is unrelated to the defunct nationwide radio network of the same name; however, the station has been using this and the Liberty Broadcasting System name as part of the station's promotion. ==History== KTRW was originally at 970 kHz and was the home of KREM-TV's AM sister until it was sold off to different owners in the 1980s. The current KTRW began as KZUN in 1955. KZUN became KKPL on April 3, 1985. On January 11, 1989, the station changed its call sign to KHDL. On November 5, 1999, the station became KXLI and on October 24, 2005, the current KTRW. On September 25, 2005, the station changed frequency to KXLI's 630 signal and changed its format to adult standards. The format includes Christian music, news and talk. In 2016, KTRW launched an FM transmitter on the 96.5 frequency. ==References== ==External links== *KTRW official website * * TRW TRW Category:Adult standards radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Washington (state) ",
