He was a member of the Sonderkommando in Auschwitz-Birkenau from May to August 1944. He took part in the preparation of the Sonderkommando Uprising of 1944. He is one of the possible authors of the Sonderkommando photographs. ==Biography== Sonderkommando in Auschwitz-Birkenau, August 1944 (clandestine photo) Sonderkommando in Auschwitz-Birkenau, August 1944 (clandestine photo) Sonderkommando in Auschwitz-Birkenau, August 1944 (clandestine photo) Sonderkommando in Auschwitz-Birkenau, August 1944 (clandestine photo) Before the war, Alberto Errera was a soldier in the Hellenic Army, promoted to officer and achieving the rank of captain.

He joined the partisans, the Greek People's Liberation Army, during the German occupation of Greece, as a food supplier. He took the Christian name Alex (Alekos) Michaelides, or, according to his nephew, Alexandros Alexandris.See interview of his nephew : Alberto Errera photograph 280 Sonderkommando Auschwitz. Alexandros Alexandridis was the code name of the brother of Alberto Errera, Samuel Errera, who died as a resistance fighter in Thebes, Greece, in an airstrike. On the night of 24 March 1944, he was arrested by the Germans in Larissa, part of a group of 225 Jews,Gideon Greif, We wept without tears, Yale University Press, 2005, p. 375. and then jailed in the Haidari camp.Marcel Nadjary, \u03a7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc 1941\u20131945 [Chronicle], \u0399\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 \u0395\u03c4\u03c3 - \u0391\u03c7\u03b1'\u03b9'\u03bc, Thessaloniki, 1991, p. 36. But, according to his nephew, he was captured, not as a Jew, but as a leftist.See interview of his nephew : Alberto Errera photograph 280 Sonderkommando Auschwitz. He was deported from Athens on 2 April and arrived at Auschwitz on 11 April, at which point he was one of the 320 Greek (assigned serial numbers from 182,440 to 182,759) selected for labor. His number was 182,552. After spending two days in the Zentral Sauna in Birkenau, he and the other Greek men lived in the Block 12 of the M\u00e4nnerquarant\u00e4ne Lager from April 13 to May 11. Then he was selected, along with 100 Greeks, to be part of the Sonderkommando.See Auschwitz by Tal Bruttmann : as early as 16 May 1944, four convoys, each carrying 3,000 Jews from Hungary in 45 wagons, had to leave Hungary daily for Auschwitz. After being removed from Auschwitz in November 1943 by order of Himmler, Rudolf H\u00f6ss was called back to the camp commandment to prepare the site for the scheduled mass arrival (Aktion H\u00f6ss). On 9 May, orders were given to increase the number of prisoners of the Sonderkommando and Kanada Kommando (see Auschwitz Chronicle by Danuta Czech). In mid-April, the number of Sonderkommando prisoners stood at 207. On May 15, a contingent of 100 men was taken from the quarantine camp among the Greek Jews selected on April 11. He was assigned the job of a Heizer (\"stoker\"), a member of the Sonderkommando assigned to the crematorium furnace, in Birkenau Krematorium V.

According to Filip M\u00fcller,See Filip M\u00fcller, Eyewitness Auschwitz: Three Years in the Gas Chambers, Stein and Day, 1979. Leon Cohen and the historian and fellow prisoner Hermann Langbein,Hermann Langbein, People in Auschwitz, p. 217 : Kaminski and two Greeks who had participated in an earlier discussion of these plans with Porebski decided to organize a rebellion of the Sonderkommando, which had nothing to lose. The name of one of the two Greeks has been passed along; Eduard de Wind writes about Errera from Larissa and Albert Menasche mentions Alexander Hereirra. While Paisikovic does not remember the name, he does recall that a very intelligent Greek who was known on the detail for his beautiful singing took part in the preparatory work. The second Greek is probably Giuseppe Baruch, aka Pepo. who actively participated in the preparations for the Sonderkommando Uprising, alongside Yaacov Kaminski, Jankiel Handelsmann, Jukl Wrobel, Josef Warszawski, a man named W\u0142adek, Giuseppe Baruch and Zalman Gradowski, Zalmen Gradowski, Au c\u0153ur de l\u2019enfer, Tallandier, 2009. among others. According to Izack Cohen, who worked in the Kanada Kommando, Errera was the leader of the Greek resistance group in Krematorium V. He tried to recruit Izack Cohen in the resistance group.From Erich Kulka's notes. See the testimony in Auschwitz Sonderkommando channel's video Through the testimony of Alter Fajnzylberg, we know that it was Errera who took the famous \"Sonderkommando photographs\" in the beginning of August 1944,About these photographs, see Georges Didi-Huberman, Images in Spite of All: Four Photographs from Auschwitz, University of Chicago Press, 2008, first published as Images malgr\u00e9 tout Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit, 2003.Steven Bowman, The Agony of Greek Jews, 1940\u20131945, Stanford University Press, 2009, p. 95 with the help of Dawid Szmulewski,See the testimony of Szmulewski in Jean- Claude Pressac, Technique and operation of the gas chambers, Beate Klarfeld Foundation, 1989. Online a member of the resistance, and three other members of the Sonderkommando, Szlama Dragon, his brother and Alter Fajnzylberg, who kept watch.Hermann Langbein, People in Auschwitz , The University of North Carolina Press, 2004. After taking the photographs, Errera buried the camera in the soil at the camp, for retrieval/discovery later. On 9 August 1944, during the transport from the crematoria of ash that was to be discharged into the Vistula, Errera tried to convince his three co-detainees (including Hugo Baruch Venezia and Henri Nechama Capon) to escape, but they refused. Once on site, Errera stunned the accompanying two Schupos with a shovel and plunged into the Vistula. He was caught during the next two or three days, tortured and killed. As was usual, when a fugitive was caught, his body was exposed at the camp entrance as an example to the other inmates. Errera was awarded by the Greek government in the 1980s for his contribution in the Greek resistance during World War II. ==The Sonderkommando photographs== For many years, the author of the Sonderkommando pictures was not identified. They were credited as anonymous or, by default, assigned to Dawid Szmulewski, even if he mentioned a Greek Jew named Alex. The story of these photos was recorded by Alter Fajnzylberg in his writings in which he evokes the figure of the Greek Jew named Alex (although he forgot the surname). In May 1978, Fajnzylberg answered a letter from the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, about the photographs. He wrote: It was Alex from Greece, but I do not remember his name, who took the photographs. He died during an escape during the transport of ash from incinerated people. These ashes were regularly dumped in the Sola or in the Vistula. Alex disarmed both SS escort[s] and threw their rifles into the Vistula. He died during the pursuit. I do not remember where the camera and other documents were buried because it [was] Alex who performed this work.Alban Perrin, \u00c9crits au c\u0153ur de la catastrophe However, in his diaries, written immediately after the war, Fajnzylberg mentions the attempted escape of a Greek Jew named Aleko Errera. His escape struck their minds and was told by several surviving witnesses: Errikos Sevillias,Errikos Sevillias, Athens-Auschwitz, Lycabettus Press, 1983.
