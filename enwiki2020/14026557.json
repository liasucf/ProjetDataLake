In 1957, he was a political columnist for the daily newspaper La Libert\u00e9 du Massif Central, and an editor for Paris-Presse. In 1958, he joined the weekly magazine Jours de France. He was appointed in 1960 director of information of the Republic of Niger where he created the information services and the daily Le Temps du Niger. In 1962, he founded and directed for five years the daily Le Courrier de Madagascar in Antananarivo. He created in 1967 in Martinique the weekly France Antilles Sp\u00e9cial Dimanche. He was in 1968 in Dakar, Senegal, leading the creation of the daily Le Soleil and of Les Nouvelles Imprimeries du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, both of which paved the way to the plurality and opening of information in French West Africa. Gayot has been active in Canada where he renewed and relaunched the world's oldest French language daily, L'Evang\u00e9line. He brought his expertise to the local press in Vietnam, Egypt, Mauretania, Za\u00efre (now Republic of Congo), Burundi and Iran.La Gazette de la Presse francophone (Paris) Juillet 2005 NJ 122 In 1969, with his friends Henri Gault and Christian Millau, he founded the monthly magazine Le Nouveau Guide, which went against culinary traditions of the time by promoting artistically prepared food, new cooking techniques and fresh ingredients. The three also founded the Gault Millau guide, and coined and promoted the term nouvelle cuisine. In the 1980s and 1990s, Gayot began publishing in the USA a series of restaurant guidebooks known alternatively under the Gault-Millau name or as Gayot Guides. The guidebooks rated and highlighted restaurants deemed to be among the top in their region, with reviews discussing d\u00e9cor, service, ambience and wine lists, with an emphasis on French cuisine. After 2000, his guides were published exclusively under the name Gayot, following a disagreement with the new owners of the French Gault-Millau guides. In 1983, Gayot founded, in Paris, the monthly magazine Pr\u00e9vention Sant\u00e9 in conjunction with Rodale Publishing (Emmaus, PA USA).
