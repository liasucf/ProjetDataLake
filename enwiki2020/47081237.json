The hemicellulose is a polymer of mainly five-carbon sugars C5H10O5 (xylose).Xylose, Material Measurement Technology, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), (2011) and the cellulose is a polymer of six- carbon sugar C6H12O6 (glucose).Glucose, Material Measurement Technology, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), (2011) Cellulose fibers are considered to be a plant\u2019s structural building blocks and are tightly bound to lignin, but the biomass can be deconstructed using Acid hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, organosolv dissolution, autohydrolysis or supercritical hydrolysis. Biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignocellulose) contain vast amounts of fermentable sugars. These sugars may be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks and can be converted into a multitude of biochemical, biofuel, and polymer products by either biological or chemical routes.Renmatix Facilities, Retrieved 23 June 2015] __TOC__ ==Industrial use== In January 2012, BASF invested in Pennsylvania-based Renmatix to produce low-cost, large volume quantities of industrial sugar from lignocellulosic biomass (wood, cane bagasse or straw). Renmatix is currently the only commercial player utilizing supercritical hydrolysis as a route to cellulosic sugar production.\u201cCellulosic Biofuels Industry Progress Report \u201d, Advanced Ethanol Council, (2012-2013) Renmatix is working with multiple partners on development of commercial scale facilities with the capability to produce more than 100,000 tons of cellulosic sugars annually.\u201cBASF invests in Renmatix \u201d, ICIS Green Chemicals, (2012)] The company has a world-class technical center in Pennsylvania and production operations at the Integrated Plantrose Complex (IPC) in Kennesaw, Georgia and the Feedstock Processing Facility (FPF) in Rome, New York.\u201cICIS Innovation Award Winners, Renmatix and Virent, Announce Collaboration On Bio-based Packaging \u201d, Retrieved 23 June 2015 In June 2013, Renmatix also entered a joint development agreement (JDA) with UPM, a Finnish pulp, paper and timber manufacturer, to convert woody biomass into low-cost sugar intermediates for subsequent downstream processing into biochemicals.\u201cU.S. Biobased Products, Market Potential and Projections Through 2025\u201d, United States Department of Agriculture, P.15, (2008) In December 2013, Renmatix and Virent announced a strategic collaboration to convert affordable cellulosic sugars to renewable chemicals and bio-based packaging materials.\u201cMcKinsey & Company Releases New Data About Growth in Industrial Biotech Sector at World Congress\u201d Retrieved 23 June 2015 In March 2015, French Energy Group, Total S.A. entered a joint development agreement (JDA) with Renmatix to use the Plantrose technology to extract second-generation sugars from biomass and develop sustainable and profitable biomolecules for products of interest.Third Annual World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology and Bioprocessing, Toronto, ON, July 11\u201314, 2006 Retrieved 23 June 2015 Biotechnology Penetration in the Chemical Industry {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The availability of industrial sugars from renewable resources, in sufficient quantities and at a favorable cost enables the products to be cost-competitive to fossil fuel based products.Renmatix Facilities, Retrieved 23 June 2015] A 2012 study by Nexant estimates that in the future, it will be possible and potentially economically viable to produce any type of sugar-based chemical product from biomass due to developments in cellulosic processing.\u201cCellulosic Biofuels Industry Progress Report \u201d, Advanced Ethanol Council, (2012-2013) ==References== Category:Biomass ",
