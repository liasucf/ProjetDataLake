Miller is known for her shaved head, and when asked about it, she said: \"I used to hide behind my hair all the time. I had this long, relaxed hair, and I was thinking, 'What am I trying to say? What is that about?' It sort of was a lightbulb moment, and I said: 'You know what? I'm gonna cut it off. I'ma start from ground zero and grow an afro.' I was sitting in the barber shop, and he cut my hair and I fell in love with my skull... and I never turned back. And actually, it's afforded me to be able to play a diverse range of roles \u2013 it had totally the opposite effect that I feared. Where I thought I'd be very limited to what I'd be seen for, it's done the opposite.
