For unknown reasons, the album was delayed by a full year, even though mixing, engineering, and mastering had already been done since August 2017. As of what the vinyl edition of the album says in the credits, the album was recorded in Spain between January 2017 and July 2018. It was mastered in various studios in Los Angeles. At the end of April 2018, Rosal\u00eda published a short documentary video to her social networks where she talked about her new album. She said: \"Everything I have I am leaving it here; I'm in the red, I'm risking a lot. This project is what I've always wanted to do, I've been thinking for a long time about making an album like the one I'm going to release. The flamenco inspiration is still there but, at the same time, it is something else.\" Three days after the international release of the song \"Brillo\", composed by herself and in collaboration with Colombian reggaeton singer J Balvin, the Barcelona-native singer announced on her social networks that she was going to release a new single in the coming days. Finally, on 29 May 2018, \"Malamente\" was released. Rosal\u00eda confessed that El Mal Querer is actually her final bachelor's degree project, graduating from flamenco studies. ==Music== El Mal Querer is a flamenco pop, experimental pop and Latin R&B; record that mixes flamenco music with contemporary urban sounds drawn from pop and reggaet\u00f3n. Critics noted the experimental tendencies in the production. ==Critical reception== El Mal Querer was widely acclaimed by music critics; at Metacritic, the album received an average score of 89, based on five reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Writing for The Guardian, head critic Alexis Petridis highly commended the album, giving it the highest rating and describing it as \"the calling card of a unique new talent.\" He praised Rosal\u00eda's vocals for giving the album \"a head-turning freshness\", noting that her singing style \"is audibly rooted in a different musical tradition to the usual styles in which pop vocalists perform.\" Pitchfork ranked El Mal Querer as the sixth best album of 2018, with Philip Sherburne complimenting its combination of traditional and modern styles, and praising Rosal\u00eda's voice, saying, \"Whether breathy or belting, she's as commanding a presence as Spanish-language pop has encountered in ages\u2014less an ambassador for flamenco than the inventor of her own fascinating hybrid.\" Conversely, Rosal\u00eda has been accused of cultural appropriation by some Spanish publications, due to her use of gitano symbology. She is from Catalonia, which has underlying \"cultural and political tensions\" with Andalusia, the home of flamenco. Paula Ibieta of Phoenix New Times cited \"the questionable nature of Rosal\u00eda's aesthetic and use of Andalusian slang\". Rosal\u00eda has responded that the controversy is positive, and that flamenco elements will always be present in her work. ===Year-end rankings=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Publication !
