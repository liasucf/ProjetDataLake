A group from Seattle was ready to purchase the White Sox and move them to Seattle. As Charlie Finley had business interests in Chicago, he was prepared to move the Athletics to Chicago. Due to his 20-year lease with the city of Oakland (to expire in 1987), Finley was blocked. In the end, White Sox owner Arthur Allyn sold to Bill Veeck, who kept the White Sox in Chicago.Charlie Finley: The Outrageous Story of Baseball's Super Showman, p.229, G. Michael Green and Roger D. Launius. Walker Publishing Company, New York, 2010, ===January=== *January 23 \u2013 Ralph Kiner is elected to the Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He earns his HoF membership by a single vote. ===February=== *February 3 \u2013 Billy Herman, Earl Averill and Bucky Harris are selected for the Hall of Fame by the Special Veterans Committee. *February 10 \u2013 The Special Committee on the Negro Leagues picks Judy Johnson for the Hall of Fame. ===March=== *March 21 \u2013 Georgia Tech shuts out Earlham, 41\u20130, setting an NCAA record for scoring and for winning margin. ===April=== *April 8 \u2013 Hall of Fame outfielder Frank Robinson becomes the first African American man to manage a Major League Baseball team, leading the Cleveland Indians to a 5-3 victory over the New York Yankees. *April 11 \u2013 Hank Aaron returns to Milwaukee as a member of the Milwaukee Brewers. A crowd of 48,160 fans watches Aaron drive in a run in the Brewers' 6 \u2013 2 victory over the Cleveland Indians. Aaron starred for the Milwaukee Braves before the franchise moved to Atlanta for the 1966 season. ===May=== *May 1 \u2013 Hank Aaron goes 4-for-4, driving in two runs in the Milwaukee Brewers' 17\u20133 win over the Detroit Tigers. This brings his career RBI total to 2,211, breaking Babe Ruth's published record of 2,209. On February 3, 1976, the Records Committee will revise Ruth's total to 2,204, meaning that in actuality, Aaron set the record on April 18. *May 4 : **At 5:00 AM, the New York Mets' Cleon Jones is arrested for indecent exposure in St. Petersburg, Florida after police find him naked in a van with a white, teenage girl who is holding a stash of narcotics. The charges are later dropped, however, chairman of the New York Mets M. Donald Grant fines Jones $2,000, four times as much as a Met has ever been assessed before, and forces Jones to publicly apologize during a press conference held in New York, with his wife, Angela, by his side. **The San Francisco Giants beat the Houston Astros 8\u20136 in the first game of a doubleheader at Candlestick Park. In the second inning, Houston's Bob Watson scores what is calculated as the major leagues' one-millionth run of all time, as Milt May hits John Montefusco's first pitch to drive him home. Meanwhile, Dave Concepci\u00f3n of the Cincinnati Reds hits a home run at about the same moment and races around the bases, but Watson, running from second base, scores first. Cincinnati lose to Atlanta, 3-2. (On April 22, 1876, the opening game of the National League's first-ever season, the Boston Red Caps came out ahead of the Philadelphia Athletics by the score of 6-5. Athletics first baseman Wes Fisler scored the very first run in major league history.) *May 5 \u2013 The Oakland Athletics release pinch runner Herb Washington. Washington, who played in 104 major league games without batting, pitching, or fielding, compiled 31 stolen bases and scored 33 runs. His 1975 trading card (no. 407) is the only Topps card ever issued showing the player's position as 'pinch runner'. *May 25 : **Dennis Eckersley, in his first major league start, hurls a three-hit shutout as the Cleveland Indians beat Oakland 6\u20130. **Mickey Lolich's 200th career victory is a rain-shortened, 4\u20131 win over the Chicago White Sox. His catcher is Bill Freehan, who also caught him in his first major league start on May 21, 1963. *May 30 \u2013 Willie McCovey pinch-hits a grand slam to lift the San Diego Padres over the New York Mets, 6\u20132. It is McCovey's 3rd career pinch slam, tying the major league record held by Ron Northey and Rich Reese. It is also his 16th lifetime bases- loaded homer, tying the National League record held by Hank Aaron. *May 31 \u2013 C\u00e9sar Tovar gets the only hit for Texas, the fifth time in his career he has had his team's lone hit in a game. Yankees newly acquired pitcher Catfish Hunter hurls the one-hit 6\u20130 victory. ===June=== *June 1 \u2013 The Angels' Nolan Ryan pitches his fourth career no-hitter, winning 1\u20130 over the Orioles, to tie the record set by Sandy Koufax. Today's win is his 100th. *June 6 \u2013 Luis Tiant wins his 100th game with the Boston Red Sox, defeating Kansas City 1\u20130. Boston's other 100+ winners include Cy Young, Mel Parnell, Smoky Joe Wood, Joe Dobson and Lefty Grove. Carl Yastrzemski draws a walk in the game, his 1,452nd, tying him for 10th on the all-time list with Jimmie Foxx. *June 8 \u2013 Against the Detroit Tigers at Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum, Ken Holtzman of the Oakland Athletics has a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth on a Tom Veryzer double, the only hit he will allow in a 4-0 Athletic victory. Holtzman, having pitched two no-hitters in the National League (as a Chicago Cub in and ), was bidding to join Cy Young and Jim Bunning as the only pitchers to hurl no-hitters in both leagues. *June 18 \u2013 Rookie Fred Lynn drives in 10 runs with three home runs, a triple and a single during a Boston 15\u20131 drubbing of the Detroit Tigers. Lynn's 16 total bases tie an American League record. ===July=== *July 2 \u2013 For the second time in less than a month, an American League pitcher has a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth after having pitched one in the National League. In the first game of a doubleheader at Milwaukee County Stadium, Boston Red Sox pitcher Rick Wise has the bid foiled by a George Scott two-run home run. Wise gives up another home run to Bobby Darwin one batter later, but holds on to win, 6-3. Like Ken Holtzman, whose bid for a third career no-hitter was foiled with two out in the ninth on June 8, Wise had no-hit the Cincinnati Reds at Riverfront Stadium in . In the same game, Boston's Jim Rice hits a home run that comes within four rows of exiting the stadium. Cecil Fielder will become the only player to hit a home run completely out of the stadium, in . *July 4 \u2013 At Veterans Stadium, Jerry Grote steps in as a pinch hitter against long time battery-mate Tug McGraw, who had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies during the off- season. With the Mets down 3-2, Grote connected for a game winning two run home run. Without McGraw to go to in the Mets' bullpen, Rick Baldwin stepped in, and earned the save. *July 15 \u2013 At Milwaukee County Stadium, the National League rallies for three runs in the ninth inning to win the All-Star Game over the American League, 6-3. Bill Madlock and the Mets' Jon Matlack share the MVP award. The game also marks the last of Hank Aaron's record-tying (along with Stan Musial and Willie Mays) 24th All-Star appearance; he lines out to Dave Concepci\u00f3n as a pinch hitter in the second inning. This appearance, like his first in , was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium. *July 17 \u2013 For the second consecutive Chicago White Sox game, Wilbur Wood is the starter, and he tosses his second straight shutout, beating the Detroit Tigers 5\u20130. The two starts were separated by the All-Star game. *July 21 \u2013 F\u00e9lix Mill\u00e1n of the New York Mets has four straight singles but is wiped out each time when Joe Torre grounds into four straight double plays, tying a major league record. New York loses 6\u20132 to the Houston Astros. Torre is the first National Leaguer to do so. *July 24 \u2013 Tom Seaver fans Dan Driessen of the Reds in the second inning for his 2,000th career strikeout. The Reds win, 2-1. *July 27- Ron Guidry, later to be known as \"Louisiana Lightning\" makes his MLB debut for the New York Yankees. He pitches 2 innings, gives up 3 hits but strikes out three in relief. ===August=== *August 2 \u2013 At Shea Stadium, the New York Yankees defeat the Cleveland Indians 5-3 in Billy Martin's debut as Yankee manager. This will be the first of five stints as Yankee manager for Martin, who had played for the Yankees from \u2013 and \u2013. Martin had replaced the fired Bill Virdon as Yankee skipper the day before. (The Yankees played at Shea Stadium for the 1974 and 1975 seasons while Yankee Stadium was being renovated.) *August 6 \u2013 The 56-53 Mets fire manager Yogi Berra and replace him with Roy McMillan. *August 9 \u2013 Davey Lopes steals his 32nd consecutive base for the Dodgers without being caught, in a 2\u20130 win over the Mets. This breaks the major league record set by Max Carey in 1922. Lou Brock gets his 2500th hit versus the San Diego Padres, a single in the 6th off of Dave Freisleben at Busch Stadium. *August 21 \u2013 Pitching brothers Rick Reuschel and Paul Reuschel combine to hurl the Cubs to a 7\u20130 victory over the Dodgers \u2014 the first time brothers have collaborated on a shutout. Paul takes over when Rick is forced to leave in the 7th inning because of a blister on his finger. *August 24 \u2013 In the second game of a doubleheader at Candlestick Park, Ed Halicki of the San Francisco Giants no-hits the New York Mets 6-0. ===September=== *September 1 \u2013 Mets ace Tom Seaver shuts out the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-0, and reaches 200 strikeouts for a major league record eighth straight season. *September 2 \u2013 The San Francisco Giants' Johnny LeMaster sets a major league record by hitting an inside-the-park home run in his first at bat, during a 7-3 win over the Dodgers. Brian Downing, two years earlier, was the first major league player to hit his first homer inside-the-park, but not in his first at bat. *September 3 \u2013 On the final pitch of his Hall of Fame career, Cardinals great Bob Gibson gives up a grand slam to Pete LaCock. It will be LaCock's only bases-loaded homer of his career. *September 5- Larry Andersen makes his major league debut for the Cleveland Indians. Anderson would go on to a 20 year career as a relief pitcher *September 7 - The Cincinnati Reds clinch the National League Western Division title, the earliest (by calendar day) a team has ever clinched their division in MLB history. *September 14 \u2013 The Boston Red Sox top the Milwaukee Brewers at Fenway Park, 8\u20136, as Brewers' 19-year-old shortstop Robin Yount breaks Mel Ott's 47-year-old record by playing in his 242nd game as a teenager. *September 16 \u2013 Rennie Stennett ties Wilbert Robinson's major league record, set June 10, 1892, by going 7-for-7 in a nine- inning game. He collects two hits each in the first and fifth innings, and scores five of his club's runs in a 22-0 massacre of the Cubs, a major league record for the biggest score in a shutout game in the 20th century. John Candelaria pockets the easy win, while Rick Reuschel is the loser. *September 18 \u2013 Released by the Minnesota Twins in January, Harmon Killebrew returns to Metropolitan Stadium a final time with his new team, the Kansas City Royals. He homers off Eddie Bane in the second inning\u2014the final hit, run and home run of his career. *September 24 \u2013 In a scoreless game against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Tom Seaver of the New York Mets has a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth on a Joe Wallis single. This is the third time Seaver has had a no-hit bid broken up in the ninth inning; one of the previous two was a perfect game bid in , also against the Cubs. The Cubs win the game in the 11th inning 1-0, as Rick Monday scores on Bill Madlock's bases-loaded walk. *September 26 - New York Mets rookie Mike Vail strikes out seven times in a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies, setting a National League record that still stands. *September 27 \u2013 The Yankees sweep a doubleheader from the Orioles, giving the Red Sox the AL East title. *September 28 \u2013 For the first time in major league history, four pitchers share in a no-hitter, as the Oakland Athletics shut down the California Angels, 5\u20130, on the final day of the season. Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers are the unique quartet. ===October=== *October 21 \u2013 Delayed a day by rain, Game Six of the World Series will be among the most memorable. Bernie Carbo of the Red Sox hits a three-run home run in the bottom of the eighth to tie the game. Boston loads the bases with no outs in the ninth but cannot score until Carlton Fisk leads off the twelfth with his memorable walk-off home run, which deflects off the left field foul pole for a 7\u20136 victory to tie the series. *October 22 \u2013 At Fenway Park, the Cincinnati Reds win Game Seven of the World Series over the Boston Red Sox, 4\u20133. Cincinnati has come from behind in all four of their victories. Pete Rose is named the World Series MVP. ===November=== *November 10 \u2013 The Kansas City Royals release slugger Harmon Killebrew, ending a 22-year career marked by 573 home runs, good for fifth place on the all-time list. *November 12 \u2013 Tom Seaver of the New York Mets wins his third Cy Young Award, after led the National League pitchers with 22 victories and 243 strikeouts while posting a 2.38 ERA. Seaver had previously won the award in and . *November 20 \u2013 The San Francisco Giants fire manager Wes Westrum, coaxing Bill Rigney out of retirement to replace him *November 26 \u2013 Boston Red Sox center fielder Fred Lynn becomes the first rookie ever to be named American League MVP. Lynn, who hit .331 with 21 home runs and 105 RBI, also posted league-leading figures in runs (103), doubles (47), and slugging (.566), helping Boston to the American League East title. He also won Rookie of the Year honors. ===December=== *December 4 \u2013 Ted Turner enters a tentative purchase agreement to buy the Atlanta Braves. *December 10 \u2013 A deal to move the Chicago White Sox to Seattle, and the Oakland Athletics to Chicago's South Side, is nixed when Bill Veeck repurchases the White Sox and keeps them in Chicago. Seattle would eventually be awarded with an expansion franchise, called the Mariners. *December 11 \u2013 The New York Yankees send starting pitcher Doc Medich to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitchers Ken Brett and Dock Ellis and perennial All-Star second baseman Willie Randolph. *December 23 \u2013 Arbitrator Peter Seitz announces a landmark decision in favor of the Players' Association, making pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally free agents. Seitz is immediately fired by John Gaherin, chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee. McNally, who retired on June 8, will not return to the majors, finishing with a 184-119 career record. ==Births== ===January=== *January 1 \u2013 Fernando Tat\u00eds *January 2 \u2013 Jeff Suppan
