Israel said the attack had been planned as an assassination attempt in retaliation for the kidnapping and death of missing Israeli servicemen in 1986 and the abduction of US Marine and UN peace-keeping officer William R. Higgins in 1988. In retaliation, the Islamic Jihad Organization attacked the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. After the attack, the Islamic Jihad Organization declared that it was carried out as revenge for the martyr infant Hussein, al Musawi's five-year-old son, who had been killed with his father. Later it was revealed by Dieter Bednarz and Ronen Bergman that the original plan of Israel had been just to abduct al Musawi to realize the release of Israeli prisoners. However, Ehud Barak, then Israeli chief of staff, convinced then Israeli Prime Minister Shamir to order his assassination. Al Musawi was succeeded as Secretary General of Hezbollah by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. == References == Category:1952 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Hezbollah founders Category:Secretaries-general of Hezbollah Category:Lebanese Islamists Category:Assassinated Lebanese people Category:Lebanese Shia clerics Category:Lebanese Shia Muslims Category:People murdered in Lebanon Category:Al-Moussawi family Category:Aerial operations and battles involving Israel Category:Assassinations in Lebanon Category:Twelvers Category:Islamic Dawa Party politicians ",
