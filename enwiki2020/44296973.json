    "text": "The Earthbound Papas are a Japanese progressive rock/metal band performing songs and interpretations of music from video games, notably including the Final Fantasy series. Nobuo Uematsu, the acclaimed composer of music in the Final Fantasy series, formed the band after his previous band, The Black Mages, disbanded in 2010. In addition to new arrangements of some Final Fantasy tracks, they have also arranged tracks from other projects that featured Uematsu as a composer and they have produced original compositions for the band's albums. In 2010, the Earthbound Papas were featured on the Distant Worlds II: More Music from Final Fantasy live orchestral release, in which they joined the orchestra for a performance of the song Dancing Mad from Final Fantasy VI. ==Discography== ;Albums * Octave Theory - 2011 {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"3\" |Octave Theory - Track listing |- !No. !Title !Length |- |1. |\"Introduction ~ Octopus Theory\" |6:34 |- |2. |\"Liberi Fatali\" (from Final Fantasy VIII) |4:48 |- |3. |\"Advent: One Winged Angel\" (from Final Fantasy VII Advent Children) |6:12 |- |4. |\"Thread of Fate\" (from Guin Saga) |5:45 |- |5. |\"Metal Hypnotized\" |5:11 |- |6. |\"Eternity\" (from Blue Dragon) |4:46 |- |7. |\"The Forest of Thousand Years\" |6:02 |- |8. |\"Bo-Kon-Ho-Ko\" (from Lost Odyssey) |5:56 |- |9. |\"Homecoming\" |3:34 |} * Dancing Dad - 2013 {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"3\" |Dancing Dad - Track listing |- !No. !Title !Length |- |1. |\"Homecoming Again - Opening Fanfare\" (for Symphonic Odysseys) |4:38 |- |2. |\"Doppelg\u00e4nger\" |5:08 |- |3. |\"Fight With Seymour\" (from Final Fantasy X) |5:24 |- |4. |\"La petite malice du Kijimunaa\" |4:07 |- |5. |\"Toneless\" (from Anata no yurusanai) |5:31 |- |6. |\"Interlude - Anthony's Dream\" |4:18 |- |7. |\"Delight of the Victors\" (from Ultra Dimension Neptune V) |4:50 |- |8. |\"LORD of VERMILLION\" (from LORD of VERMILLION) |5:35 |- |9. |\"Dancing Mad\" (from Final Fantasy VI) |12:34 |- |10. |\"Watashi no Mizu To Sora (from Blue Dragon) |3:49 |} == External links == * Category:2011 establishments in Japan Category:Final Fantasy music Category:Instrumental rock musical groups Category:Japanese instrumental musical groups Category:Japanese progressive metal musical groups Category:Japanese progressive rock groups Category:Japanese symphonic metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2011 Category:Musical quintets Category:Nintendocore musical groups Category:Symphonic rock groups Category:Video game music cover bands Category:Video game musicians ",
