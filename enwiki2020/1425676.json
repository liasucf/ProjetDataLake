    "text": "The Waterloo Warriors are the athletic teams that represent the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The Warriors have found success over certain spans in football, hockey, rugby, golf and basketball among others, and the Warriors have won national championships in hockey (1974), basketball (1975), and women's swimming (1975). For many years from the 1960s through the 1990s, Warrior basketball games attracted the largest and rowdiest basketball crowds in the country. The Warriors Football teams have won two Yates Cup Championships, in 1997 and in 1999. The team's 2010 season was cancelled after a steroid scandal, the biggest ever in CIS Football history. Waterloo's teams were originally known as the \"Mules\" after the school's founding in 1957, and for a while the women's teams were the \"Mulettes\", a name that was almost universally despised and ultimately replaced by \"Athenas\". Today the women's teams also use the nickname Warriors. University Stadium was originally built for the Warriors Football program, but was sold to the City of Waterloo in 1974 when UW could not afford to repair the stadium. The stadium was later sold by the City of Waterloo to Wilfrid Laurier University in 1992, where it is now the home of the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks. The Warriors now play at Warrior Field, which was renovated to be ready for the 2011 football season. ==Varsity teams== Waterloo Warriors teams compete in: * Badminton (m/w) * Baseball (m) * Basketball (m/w) * Cross Country Running (m/w) * Curling (m/w) * Cheerleading (co-ed) * Field hockey (w) * Figure Skating (w) * Ice hockey (m/w) * Football (m) * Golf (m/w) * Rugby (m/w) * Soccer (m/w) * Swimming (m/w) * Squash (m/w) * Tennis (m/w) * Track & Field (m/w) * Volleyball (m/w) ==Waterloo Warriors Football== The Waterloo Warriors football team has been in operation since 1957, winning two Yates Cup conference championships in 1997 and 1999.
