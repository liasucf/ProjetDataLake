    "text": "Tequila and grapefruit combine to form a two-ingredient cocktail based on tequilla. Sometimes other ingredients such as soda water and elderflower liqueur are also added. A variant that uses grapefruit soda and lime juice is a Paloma. If a tequila and grapefruit is mixed with lime juice and agave or honey simple syrup, the result is a grapefruit margarita. If a tequila and grapefruit is mixed with vermouth, the result is a grapefruit martini. ==References== Category:Cocktails ",
