Web. 16 Nov. 2014 Each school year, there are a number of events held on the Lawn to build a sense of community among the students, faculty, and the community in Charlottesville as a whole. Listed are events that have become traditions carried out by the University itself and the students. The Lawn is lined by 54 Lawn rooms and at the north stands the Rotunda (shown) and the Lawn is ended in the south by Old Cabell Hall and a statue of Homer. The upper Lawn by the Rotunda is where most of the events listed are held. == First Year Convocation == Convocation is the only time other than Final Exercises that the entire first year class is together in one place.\"First-Year Convocation.\" University of Virginia Traditions.

The students exit the convocation by signing the honor pledge for their first time as a student at UVA. == Rotunda Sing == At the beginning of each school year, the University of Virginia hosts a Rotunda Sing for all of the students.
