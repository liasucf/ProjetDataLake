So for this character, my approach was the same, that is to get into her head.\" She further said, \"I've never played a real life character before, so I had to be extra careful of everything. For example, I noticed she wore a specific wristwatch. I knew people wouldn\u2019t notice such a detail but I made sure I wear such a watch too.
