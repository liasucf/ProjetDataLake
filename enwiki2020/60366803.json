Midland's road band guitarist Luke Cutchen plays lead guitar, and session musician Paul Franklin contributes on pedal steel guitar. Marissa R. Moss of Rolling Stone Country described the song as \" a mischievous, Texas dance hall-inspired tune in the spirit of Eddie Rabbitt\" and \"a tongue-in- cheek ode to embracing the role of the being someone\u2019s late-night phone call when their other date went south.\" Taste of Country writer Jacklyn Krol said of the song that \"The beat is retro country, but the song's lyric about a charming rogue trying to hook up with other men's women is relevant to any period\" and called it an \"uptempo country hall dance tune\". ==Music video== Duddy directed the song's music video, which features Dennis Quaid portraying a protagonist who is attacked by a number of women while Midland performs the song. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
