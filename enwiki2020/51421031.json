I suspect Elliott is one of the greatest stylists Australian writing has produced, even if a contemporary reader may lose patience at the careful accumulation of detail and minute observation that evokes for me the Sydney in which my parents met and married. I read Edens Lost when it was first published, in the early days of gay liberation, both knowing and not knowing that only a gay man could have written this book.\"\"Sumner Locke Elliott crushed by the sexual constraints of the pre-war world\", The Australian, 8 April 2013 == Notes == * Dedication: For Marie * Epigraph: \"Where the apple reddens / Never pry - / Lest we lose our Edens, / Eve and I.\" / Browning, 'A Woman's Last Word' == Television adaptation == The novel was adapted for a television mini-series, produced by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Central Independent Television.
