    "text": "The Acacia Strain is an American metalcore band originally from Chicopee, Massachusetts. The Acacia Strain is currently signed to Rise Records. In total, the group has released ten full-length albums. == History == Forming in 2001, The Acacia Strain was started by high school friends Vincent Bennett, Christopher Daniele, Ben Abert. Looking to bring their current band Septic Orgasm to the next level of technicality, they brought in their mutual friend, Karrie Whitfield, and high school student Daniel \"DL\" Laskiewicz to play Bass and guitar respectively. The band began playing local shows around Massachusetts and recorded their demo in 2001. After DL received a shoulder injury while playing high school football, Vincent asked friend and current Blood Has Been Shed guitarist, Daniel Daponde, to fill in on guitar while DL healed from his injury. Daniel brought a heavier and more technical aspect to the band, so when DL returned they asked Daniel to stay, thus forming the unusual three guitar lineup. After countless local shows, including quite a few in Vincent's mother's basement, the band was approached by Toby Dutkiewicz, who ran Devil's Head records, if they would join his label. The band agreed and recording for their debut album \"...and Life is Very Long\" began in 2002 at Zing recording studio in Westfield, Massachusetts with Adam Dutkiewicz and Jim Fogarty at the helm with Jim doing most of the tracking. ==Artistry== ===Musical style=== The Acacia Strain's music has been primarily described as deathcore and metalcore, and has been noted to include heavy influences from sludge, doom metal and death metalLets Talk About Knocked Loose Metalsucks along with some punk rock-style aesthetic and sensibilities. AllMusic characterizes the band's musical style as \"utiliz[ing] a bone- crushing rhythm section, apocalyptic samples, and a unique triple-guitar assault to deliver their signature blend of hardcore punk, noise, death metal and doom metal.\" The site's review of Wormwood elaborates on the band's sound as \"an inelegant and unstoppable juggernaut fueled by memories of the unchecked aggression unleashed on the world by the likes of Sepultura and Pantera.\" The band's former bassist, Jack Strong, describes their music as \"hardcore-influenced metal\", Vocalist Vincent Bennett has described his dislike for the band being labeled \"deathcore\" and denies that their music is within the genre. Drummer Kevin Boutot also rejected the deathcore label. The Acacia Strain's influences include Candiria, Integrity, Dismember, Deftones, Rush, Iron Maiden, Crowbar, Meshuggah, Hatebreed, Slayer, Arch Enemy, and Overcast. ===Lyrics=== Written by lead vocalist Vincent Bennett, the band's lyrics generally center around misanthropy and nihilism. Bennett employs misogynistic and sexually deviant imagery in his lyrics, but usually only as metaphors to help get his points across while keeping the songs' overall meanings open for interpretation. ==Members== Current * Vincent Bennett \u2013 lead vocals (2001\u2013present) * Kevin Boutot \u2013 drums (2005\u2013present) * Devin Shidaker \u2013 lead guitar, programming, backing vocals (2013\u2013present) * Griffin Landa \u2013 bass (2015\u2013present) * Tom \"The Hammer\" Smith, Jr. \u2013 rhythm guitar (2016\u2013present) Former * Jeanne Sagan \u2013 bass (2003) * Karrie Whitfield \u2013 bass (2001\u20132003) * Ben Abert \u2013 drums (2001\u20132004, 2004-2005) * Christopher Daniele \u2013 third guitar (2001\u20132005) * Daniel \u201cOuthouse\u201d Daponde \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2001\u20132006) * Seth Coleman \u2013 bass (2004\u20132006) * Daniel \"DL\" Laskiewicz \u2013 lead guitar, programming (2001\u20132013); rhythm guitar (2007\u20132013) * Jack Strong \u2013 bass (2006\u20132015) * Richard Gomez \u2013 rhythm guitar (2013\u20132016) Touring musicians * Mark Castillo \u2013 drums (2004) * Jon Preston - bass (2003) * David Sroka \u2013 third guitar (2009) * Mike Casavant \u2013 third guitar (2009\u20132010) * Tim Cavallari \u2013 third guitar (2010\u20132012) * Tony Diaz \u2013 third guitar (2010\u20132012) * Matt Guglielmo \u2013 drums (2018) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Heat. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Indie. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Rock ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Hard Rock |- ! scope=\"row\" | ...And Life Is Very Long | * Released: * Label: Devil's Head * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3750 | * Released: * Label: Devil's Head, Prosthetic * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Dead Walk | * Released: * Label: Prosthetic * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || 40 || 47 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Continent | * Released: * Label: Prosthetic * Formats: CD, digital download | 107 || 2 || 13 || \u2014 || 18 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Wormwood | * Released: * Label: Prosthetic * Formats: CD, digital download | 67 || \u2014 || 6 || 21 || 8 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Death Is the Only Mortal | * Released: * Label: Rise * Formats: CD, digital download | 51 || \u2014 || 10 || 21 || 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Coma Witch | * Released: * Label: Rise * Formats: CD, digital download | 31 || \u2014 || 4 || 8 || 1 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Gravebloom | * Released: * Label: Rise * Formats: CD, digital download | 146 || \u2014 || 4 || 29 || 8 |- ! scope=\"row\" | It Comes In Waves | * Released: * Label: Closed Casket Activities * Formats: CD, digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Slow Decay | * Released: * Label: Rise * Formats: CD, digital download |87 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} EPs *Money for Nothing (2013) *Above/Below (2013) *The Depression Sessions with Thy Art Is Murder and Fit for an Autopsy (2016) Singles *\"Servant In the Place of Truth\" (2012) Demos *2001 Demo (2001) DVDs *The Most Known Unknown (2010) ==Music videos== *\"Smoke Ya Later\" (2004) *\"3750\" (2005) *\"Angry Mob Justice\" (2006) *\"Skynet\" (2009) *\"The Hills Have Eyes\" (2010) *\"The Impaler\" (2011) *\"Cauterizer\" (2014) *\"Send Help\" (2015) ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 establishments in Massachusetts Category:American metalcore musical groups Category:American deathcore musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Musical groups from Springfield, Massachusetts Category:Musical quintets Category:Rise Records artists ",
