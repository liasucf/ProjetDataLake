    "text": "Rise Records is an American record label currently based in Beaverton, Oregon, mainly focusing on heavy metal and punk rock music artists. ==History== Rise was founded in 1991 by Craig Ericson in Nevada City, California. He released a small number of 7\" records before putting the label on hiatus to attend college. Ericson didn't release anything further until 1999, after moving to Portland, Oregon.Label Profile: Rise Records. Alternative Press, October 2008, p. 56. He began issuing small-print 7\" records, and his first CD release came in 2000, from the group One Last Thing. The label gave a strong foundation to bands Anatomy of a Ghost, Ever We Fall (who later signed with Hopeless) and Fear Before the March of Flames (who signed to Equal Vision). Later signees (e.g. Drop Dead, Gorgeous, Breathe Carolina and The Devil Wears Prada), gained considerable popularity while with Rise, and moved on to what were larger labels at the time (Interscope, Fearless and Ferret, respectively). Rise has also signed some veteran bands, including Hot Water Music, Bouncing Souls, The Bled, Bleeding Through and From First To Last. Rise Records' releases are distributed in the U.S. by ADA and BMG. In July 2013, the company moved from Portland to neighboring Beaverton, Oregon. The label has a distribution deal with Alternative Distribution Alliance, the indie distributor owned by Warner Music Group and directly in Europe and Australia with Warner Music and BMG. On September 9, Australian label UNFD announced a distribution partnership with Rise. On May 18, 2015, BMG announced the acquisition of the label. Rise will maintain its headquarters and Ericson will remain in charge. BMG will help with back office operations and provide Rise a more international reach. On December 8, 2017, Craig Ericson announced his departure from the label. ==Artists== ===Current artists=== * The Acacia Strain * American Nightmare * Angels & Airwaves * At The Drive In * Black Peaks * Blessthefall * Bloodbather * Chapel * Clint Lowery * Covey * Crown the Empire * Dance Gavin Dance * Dave Hause * Derek Sanders * Dune Rats (outside AUS) * Fire From the Gods * Galactic Empire * Gone Is Gone * Issues * Jetty Bones * Knuckle Puck * Kublai Khan * Kvelertak * Le Butcherettes * Make Them Suffer (outside AUS) * Mark Morton * Mayday Parade * Memphis May Fire * Palisades * Placebo * PUPhttps://www.facebook.com/RiseRecords/videos/380357876058426/?__xts__[0]=68.ARAfmHYfkAl_v_vhGYAhm23uXcUmMMsFgmYKrltD2dwwZ-f82hRfT1_AXJDL_NFqCE6awfYjHnXQAM5fPwXXXNbZcfw40qqT5ON7gSYBTXOCTYx_AzZq7ntIaRzaJejWDMxfIci-86vT0Ar60gdUNmS3fs0fXOJGpOlO5mcQsGqTIEHx4m5q-g_utM98Eqn_nS3YOeAA0g0EUdrMM4uhbLTl8nNaIOUNiEknOsqYRQYgwhNW2-9Fzj-8gnCzPh0dxb1NLD9NivjLOxEekeoI3a9v11QiGuEy8dVllt8xwAjswYJ1LI- DfsG8UOPwQn4YRrfADoCWVbK1Ty_O3y3qceNXRk9_-2gP&__tn__=-R * Secret Band * Sevendust * Social Animals * Spiritbox * Thousand Below * Tiger Army * Tilian ===Former artists=== * 7 Seconds (disbanded) * A Different Breed of Killer (active, unsigned) * Abandon All Ships (disbanded) * Acceptance (active, Tooth & Nail Records) * Alive Like Me (disbanded) * American Me (active, unsigned) * Arlington (active, unsigned) * Attack Attack!
