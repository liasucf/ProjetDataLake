    "text": "Triazinanes are a class of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The parent molecules' molecular formula is 393. They exist in three isomeric forms, 1,3,5-triazinanes being common. == Structure == The triazinanes have six- membered Cyclohexane-like ring but with three carbons replaced by nitrogens. The three isomers of triazinane are distinguished by the positions of their nitrogen atoms, and are referred to as 1,2,3-triazinane, 1,2,4-triazinane, and 1,3,5-triazinane. == References == * Heterocyclic Chemistry T.L.
