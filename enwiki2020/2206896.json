Already successful club/dance artists individually, the duo has hit number one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart five times. Their first hit was \"La Puta\" which in 1995 charted fairly well in many clubs, and was also remixed into a reggaeton mix on DJ Nelson & DJ Goldy's: Xtassy Reggae, released on September 20, 2000. 2000's \"Don't You Want My Love\" featured vocalist Debbie Jacobs- Rock. In 2001, Rosabel scored two Top 10 club hits with \"The Power\" featured Jeanie Tracy which peaked at Number 1 and a remix of the Jennifer Holliday classic \"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\" which peaked at Number 6 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play. In 2002 they spent a week at number one with \"That Sound.\" Rosabel's third Number 1 hit came in 2004, shortly after the release of the single, \"Cha Cha Heels\" which features Jeanie Tracy on lead vocals. Their fifth number one, \"Rhythm Intoxication\", came in 2006. \"Cha Cha Heels\" was later featured in the sixth season of So You Think You Can Dance in a cha- cha-cha choreographed by Jean-Marc Genereux and danced by Jakob Karr and Ashleigh Di Lello. In September 2010, they released their next single \"C'Mon Get Funky\" feat Tamara Wallace, which peaked at number 2. They reteamed with Tamara in 2011 for \"Let Me Be Myself\" which peaked at number 7 in February 2012. They were nominated for a 2012 Grammy award for their remix of Rihanna's \"Only Girl in the World\" in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical Category. In 2016, Rosabel achieved their seventh Billboard Dance Chart number 1 single with \"Livin' for Your Love (Your Love)\" featuring the vocals of singer Jeanie Tracy on Carrillo Music.
