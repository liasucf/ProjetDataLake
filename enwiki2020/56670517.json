    "text": "FS Class E.620 was a class of third-rail electric locomotives built by Officine Reggiane for the Italian State Railways (FS). They were built in 1925 using motors and electrical equipment from Class E.10 railcars which had been withdrawn in 1923. They were equipped with six nose-suspended direct current traction motors with a total output of 950 kW. The drive to the axles was by gears and the maximum speed was 85 km/h. After World War II they were converted to 3,000 volt DC operation and became FS Class E.621. ==References== ==Further reading== * Nuovi locomotori per la linea Milano-Varese-Porto Ceresio, in \"Rivista tecnica delle ferrovie italiane\", anno XV, vol.
