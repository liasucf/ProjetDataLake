United States of America) Preliminary Objection.\" International Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Jul., 1997), p. 698. ==Early life and education== Stephen M. Schwebel was born on March 10, 1929 in New York City and while attending high school in New York City developed a strong interest in the United Nations Conference on International Organization being held in San Francisco. The U.N. Conference and the U.N. student organization that he was active in (and that was later affiliated with the United Nations Association of the United States of America), marked the start of a long focus on international relations and law. After entering Harvard University, he became active in the U.N. student movement and participated in founding The United Nations Council of Harvard. In 1950 he received a B.A. magna cum laude with highest honors in government from Harvard and was awarded the Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship. The Knox Fellowship enabled Schwebel to perform research and study in a Commonwealth country of his choice. Schwebel chose to study international law at Cambridge University in England under Sir Hersch Lauterpacht who advised him, upon completion of his year at Cambridge, to attend law school. He subsequently entered Yale Law School where he received an LL.B. (1954). While studying at Yale, Schwebel was told by the eminent professor of law Myres McDougal that in order to become an influential international lawyer he first needed to, \"earn his spurs,\" at the best law firm that would take him.Kreisler, Harry Reflections on a Career in International Law: Conversation with Judge Stephen M. Schwebel of the ICJ. January 22, 1990, Institute of International Studies, University of California - Berkeley. Accessed 3 March 2015. From 1954 to 1959, Schwebel practiced law as an associate at the law firm of White & Case in New York City. While at White & Case, he had the opportunity to participate in one of the largest international arbitration cases of the 20th century - Saudi Arabia v. Arabian American Oil Company. Schwebel was assigned the, \"digging,\" on the case and spent countless hours going through files; however, the experience engendered a lifelong interest in international arbitration. In 1959, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School where he taught until 1961. In 1961 Schwebel started his career with the U.S. State Department as Assistant Legal Adviser on United Nations Affairs. In 1967 he returned to academia as the Burling Professor of International Law at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.Gale Reference Team 2002 \"Biography - Schwebel, Stephen M. (1929 -).\" Contemporary Authors, Thomas Gale. ==Deputy Adviser to U.S. Department of State== In 1974 Schwebel became Deputy Legal Adviser to the U.S. Department of State where he assisted in the formulation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy. During his service as Deputy Legal Adviser, he participated as Associate Representative, Representative Counsel and Deputy Agent of the United States in various cases before the International Court of Justice including: Interpretation of the Agreement of 25 March 1951 Between the World Health Organization and Egypt (1980), United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (1979\u20131980) and, while serving as Assistant Legal Adviser for United Nations Affairs, Certain Expenses of the United Nations (1962). Press Communiqu\u00e9, International Court of Justice, The Hague 97/2, Retrieved 26 July 2017. ===Cambodian accountability=== In September 1978, Schwebel, acting as Deputy Adviser to the U.S. Department of State, sought accountability for the mass executions committed by the Khmer Rouge. Schwebel wrote the U.K. Foreign Office about the possibility of instituting proceedings against Cambodia before the International Court of Justice for genocide. Although Schwebel suggested a basis for the proceedings should be the Genocide Convention, he acknowledged that proceedings of a case against Cambodia based on the convention were not well founded.Smith, Karen 2010 \"Genocide & the Europeans.\" Cambridge University Press, p. 93. Schwebel stated that the atrocities had apparently not been aimed at destroying, in whole or in part, a \"national, ethnical, racial or religious group,\" as defined by the Genocide Convention, but rather those whom the Cambodian authorities deemed to be politically unsympathetic. The UK concurred with Schwebel's concerns by stating that it felt arguments against instituting proceedings were too strong and that the criterion for the atrocities appeared to be the political attitude (or assumed attitude) by the Cambodian government.Smith, Karen 2010 \"Genocide & the Europeans.\" Cambridge University Press, p. 94. ===Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala=== Schwebel was a key member of the U.S. State Department team that initiated and sought to influence, through an amicus brief, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in its hearing of the landmark case Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala. In August 1979, two months before oral arguments at the Second Circuit, Schwebel, as Deputy Legal Adviser, contacted the Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department and expressed the U.S. State Department's desire for the Justice Department to take account of developments in international law, which firmly established that all natural persons are entitled to fundamental human rights. Schwebel wrote: > The position of the (U.S.) State Department on the question of international > law immediately relevant to the District court judgment in Fil\u00e1rtiga is that > acts of torture violate an individual's rights under international law not > to be tortured. That an individual has this right is a conclusion founded on > provisions of the U.N. Charter and authoritative interpretations of those > provisions, on other treaties, on international custom and practice and on > the general principles of law- all as recognized by the U.S. and other > nations. It derives also from international and national judicial decisions. Despite taking over eight monthsAceves, William J. \"The Anatomy of Torture: A Documentary History of Filartiga V.

Pe\u00f1a-Irala, the ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, that torture is prohibited by international law, was heavily influenced by the amicus briefs initiated by Schwebel and his team at the U.S. State Dept.Aceves, William J. \"The Anatomy of Torture: A Documentary History of Filartiga V. Pena Irala.\" Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, p. 52. ==International Court of Justice== In January 1981, Schwebel was elected by the U.N. Security Council and U.N. General Assembly, along with Fikri El-Khani of Syria, to fill vacancies created by the deaths of Richard R. Baxter (U.S.A.) and Salah El Dne Trazi (Syria).(January 1981) Security Council Concludes International Court Elections, United Nations - News & Media. Accessed 3 March 2015. Judge Schwebel was re-elected on February 6, 1988 and re-elected again February 6, 1997. He was elected to Vice President of the Court from 1994 to 1997 and served as President of the Court from 1997 to 2000. During his tenure on the Court Judge Schwebel adjudicated 38 cases. These cases included advisory opinions such as Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons and Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights , and contentious cases between nations such as Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v. India).His opinions in these cases have been characterized by scholars as expansive, impassioned,Highet, Keith \"Evidence, the Court and the Nicaragua Case.\" The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 81, No. 1 (Jan., 1987), p. 4. exhaustive,Singh, Nagendra 1989 \"The Role & Record of the International Court of Justice.\" Martinus Nijhoff, p. 264. closely reasoned and, by those who share his views, brilliant. He was nominated for election to the International Court of Justice by the bipartisan U.S. National Group at the Permanent Court of Arbitration during the presidency of Jimmy Carter and his ruling in the Legality of Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons Case is considered by some scholars to be consistent with that of a moderate conservative.Boyle, Francis A. 2002 \"The Criminality of Nuclear Deterrence.\" Clarity Press, p. 195. Judge Schwebel frequently voted against the majority of his colleagues;Ligny, Roland De \"U.S. World Court Judge Has a Record of Dissent.\" Associated Press, June 27, 1986. however, also voted against his own country (U.S.) more than any other judge in the history of the Court. He believes that a nationalistic view, as opposed to a judicial view, undermines the international systemBernstein, Richard \"American at the Hague Sits in Judgment of U.S.\" The New York Times, 20 September 1985. and that the judicial decision making process must take in to consideration moral considerations relating to equality - beyond just a strict legalist interpretation.Heng Cheng, Tai 2012 \"When International Law Works.\" Oxford Press, p. 146. He resigned from the Court in January 2000.Judge Schwebel Elected President of ICJ Press Communiqu\u00e9, International Court of Justice, The Hague 97/2, Retrieved 3 March 2015. ===Case: Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons=== In January 1995, the U.N. asked the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on whether or not the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstance is permitted under international law. Judge Schwebel was the only judge who answered the question in an affirmative manner.Falk, Richard A. \"Nuclear Weapons, International Law and the World court: A Historic Encounter\" The American Journal of International Law , Vol. 91, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), p. 72. Judge Schwebel holds that the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons is established through state practice over many years by the world's major powers, the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly, the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and other nuclear treaties.\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel\", United Nations Cases, 8 July 1996, p. 312.Falk, Richard A. \"Nuclear Weapons, International Law and the World Court: A Historic Encounter\" The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 91, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), p. 71. He specifically notes that in The Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, the possession of nuclear weapons by the five major nuclear powers is lawful until disarmament and that inherent in possession of nuclear weapons is deterrence and deterrence, by its nature, implies threat of use. > The policy of deterrence differs from that of the threat to use nuclear > weapons by its generality but if a threat of possible use did not inhere in > deterrence, deterrence would not deter. If possession by the five nuclear > Powers is lawful until achievement of nuclear disarmament; if possession is > the better part of deterrence; if deterrence is the better part of threat, > then it follows that the practice of States -- including their treaty > practice-- does not absolutely debar the threat or use of nuclear > weapons.\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons - Dissenting > Opinion of Judge Schwebel\", United Nations Cases, 8 July 1996, p. 314. Judge Schwebel also holds that the principles of international humanitarian law such as proportionality in the degree of force applied, discrimination in the application of force between combatants and civilians and avoidance of unnecessary suffering of combatants, all of which antedate the invention of nuclear weapons, must also apply to nuclear weapons. He acknowledges, however, that it is extremely difficult to apply the principles of international humanitarian law with the practice of employing such destructive weapons;\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel\", United Nations Cases, 8 July 1996, p. 321. although not doing so, in his view, vitiates international humanitarian law.McCormack, Timothy L.H. \"A Non Liquet on Nuclear Weapons - The ICJ Avoids the Application of General Principles of International Humanitarian Law\" International Review of the Red Cross , No. 316, p. 1. Judge Schwebel, draws a distinction between the use of nuclear weapons for countervalue, which he believes cannot be reconciled with international humanitarian law, and the tactical use of nuclear weapons against military targets which he believes, in certain circumstances, can.\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel\", United Nations Cases, 8 July 1996, p. 322. > At one extreme is the use of strategic nuclear weapons in quantities against > enemy cities and industries. This so-called \"countervalue\" (as contrasted > with \"counterforce\" uses directed only against enemy nuclear forces and > installations) could cause an enormous number of deaths and injuries, > running in some cases into the millions; and, in addition to those > immediately affected by the heat and blast of those weapons, vast numbers > could be affected, many fatally, by spreading radiation. Large-scale > \"exchanges\" of such nuclear weaponry could destroy not only cities but > countries, and render continents, perhaps the whole of the Earth, > uninhabitable, if not at once then through longer-range effects of nuclear > fallout, it cannot be accepted that the use of nuclear weapons on a scale > which would -or could -result in the deaths of many millions in > indiscriminate inferno and by far reaching fallout, have profoundly > pernicious effects in space and time, and render uninhabitable much or all > of the Earth, could be lawful.\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear > Weapons - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel\", United Nations Cases, 8 > July 1996, p. 320. Judge Schwebel's view that the use of tactical nuclear weapons, in certain circumstances, complies with international humanitarian law contrasts with members of the Court's majority, and other scholars,Moxley Jr., Charles J. et al. \"Nuclear Weapons - Compliance With International Humanitarian Law and the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty\", Fordham International Law Journal, Vol. 34:595 p. 642. who believe that a nuclear weapon (of any yield) impacts civilians either directly or by an escalation in hostility that might follow.Moxley Jr., Charles J. et al. \"Nuclear Weapons - Compliance With International Humanitarian Law and the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty\", Fordham International Law Journal, Vol. 34:595 p. 640. Judge Schwebel asserts that, in certain circumstances, such as a nuclear depth charge targeted toward an enemy submarine, the antinomy between international humanitarian law and the use of nuclear weapons can be reconciled. He states that a nuclear depth charge targeted toward an enemy submarine does not give rise to immediate civilian casualties, meets the test of proportionality and leaves significantly less radiation in the ocean than the targeted submarines missiles would leave on land. Judge Schwebel characterizes the immense antinomy between the principles of international humanitarian law and nuclear weapons as a titanic tension between state practice and legal principle never before seen by the Court.Sands, Philippe, et al. 1999 \"International Law, the ICJ & Nuclear Weapons\", Cambridge University p. 210. He is critical of the Court's inability to conclude whether or not the threat or use of nuclear weapons is lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of State self- defense.Neubauer, Ronald D. \"Testing the Effectiveness of the International Court of Justice: The Nuclear Weapons Case\",Proceedings of the Annual Meeting (American Society of International Law), Vol. 91, (April 9\u201312, 1997), p. 10. In Judge Schwebel's view, it is unacceptable that the Court rendered a non liquet on such a vital question, despite provisions in Article 38 of the Court statute intended to prevent such an outcome. Schwebel expressed his dismay by stating: > This is an astounding conclusion to be reached by the International Court of > Justice. Despite the fact that its Statute \"forms an integral part\" of the > United Nations Charter, and despite the comprehensive and categorical terms > of Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of that Charter, the Court > concludes on the supreme issue of the threat or use of force of our age that > it has no opinion. In \"an extreme circumstance of self defense, in which the > very survival of a State would be at stake\", the Court finds that > international law and hence the Court have nothing to say. After many months > of agonizing appraisal of the law, the Court discovers that there is none. > When it comes to the supreme interests of State, the Court discards the > legal progress of the twentieth century, puts aside the provisions of the > Charter of the United Nation of which it is \"the principal judicial organ\", > and proclaims in terms redolent of Realpolitik its ambivalence about the > most important provisions of modern international law. If this was to be its > ultimate holding, the Court would have done better to have drawn on its > undoubted discretion not to render an opinion at all. ===Case: Nicaragua v. United States of America=== On April 9, 1984 Nicaragua filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice stating that the United States was violating international law by using military force against Nicaragua and intervening in Nicaragua's internal affairs, in violation of its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.\"Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.\" (application) United Nations Cases, 9 April 1984, p. 1. The United States argued that the Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case and Judge Schwebel in the first, second and third votes held to determine the Court's jurisdiction, agreed; however, on the fourth vote, despite strong admonitions by his own (U.S.) government for dismissal of the application, concurred with his fellow judges that the complaint was admissible and should be heard.\"Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel.\" (jurisdiction and admissibility of application) United Nations Cases, 9 April 1984, p. 562. Judge Schwebel also agreed with the Court that unannounced mining of Nicaragua's ports by the United States was a violation of customary international law. He noted that the unannounced mining had the potential to, and did, affect third party states. Judge Schwebel also found that the United States violated the law of war when the Central Intelligence Agency orchestrated the publication and distribution of a manual titled, Operaciones Sicologicas en Guerra de Guerillas.\"Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel.\" (merits) United Nations Cases, 9 April 1984, p. 266. However, with the exceptions of Judges Shigeru Oda (Japan) and Sir Robert Jennings (UK), he disagreed profoundly with interpretation of what constitutes an armed attack, under international law, by one state on another. The Court's majority found that, under international law, the arms provided by Nicaragua to the pro Nicaraguan insurgent group in El Salvador did not constitute an armed attack on the state of El Salvador by Nicaragua and, as a result, the United States did not have a right under article 51 of the U.N. Charter to collective self- defense in support of its ally El Salvador.\"Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua - Judgment on Merits.\" United Nations Cases, 10 May 1984, p. 161. Judge Schwebel, however, felt that the scale of involvement by Nicaragua crossed a threshold of what, under customary international law, would be considered an armed attack by one state on another. He stated in his dissenting opinion that the Court's majority did not thoroughly consider the prodigious evidence that Nicaragua was aggressively supporting the insurgency in El Salvador. > It (the Court) has excluded, discounted and excused the unanswerable > evidence of Nicaragua's major and maintained intervention in the Salvadoran > insurgency, and intervention which has consisted not only in provision of > great quantities of small arms until early 1981, but provision of arms, > ammunition, munitions and supplies thereafter and provision of command and > control centers, training and communication facilities and other support > before and after 1981.\"\"Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against > Nicaragua - Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel.\" (merits) United Nations > Cases, 9 April 1984, p. 272. Judge Schwebel views the Court as not being even handed in its interpretation of evidence and testimony. He feels that the Court paid insufficient attention to the rights of both the U.S and Nicaragua's neighbors. He found that emphasizing the rights of Nicaragua, while the U.S. claimed that Nicaragua was itself behind the guerrilla movement in El Salvador, \"was incompatible with the principles of equality of States.\"Moore, John Norton \"The Nicaragua Case and the Deterioration of World Order.\" The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 81, No. 1 (Jan. 1987), p. 159. Judge Schwebel also notes that the name assigned to the case (Military & Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua) indicates inherent bias and predetermined judgment. Scholars have written that Judge Schwebel was inhibited, however, in making a case for his view due to the withdrawal of the United States from the proceedings and, as a result, the lack of an advocate in the Court to defend U.S. policy and to attack the evidence presented by Nicaragua.Highet, Keith \"Evidence, the Court and the Nicaragua Case\" The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 81, No. 1 (Jan., 1987), p. 3. ==Post International Court of Justice career== Since the end of his tenure on the International Court of Justice, Judge Schwebel has acted as counsel, mediator and independent arbitrator in disputes that have involved commercial, corporate and public international law. He has been appointed in 67 arbitral proceedings that have included disputes between states and disputes between states and foreign investors. In October 2010, Schwebel was appointed by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon as the Chairman of the Kishanganga/Neelum River Hydro-Electric Project (Pakistan v. India) Arbitration. He also acted as counsel and advocate for Colombia in its territorial and maritime delimitation dispute with Nicaragua and for Belize in its territorial, insular and maritime boundary dispute with Guatemala. In October 2007, Judge Schwebel was appointed to a three-member tribunal tasked with determining whether or not to annul the award (on jurisdiction) rendered in the dispute between the UK registered firm Malaysian Historical Salvors and the Government of Malaysia. ===Arbitral fora=== Judge Schwebel has been chairman or party appointed arbitrator in International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), American Arbitration Association (AAA), Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC), London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (JCAA) and United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) ad hoc proceedings.Directory of Members \u2013 Stephen M.
