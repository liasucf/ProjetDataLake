I want to thank you all for your efforts to get the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project passed. I am pleased to hear about the strong response from university students signing up to support Louisiana Winter.\"\u2014Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, Louisiana \"My father-in-law, Sargent Shriver, always told me that serving others was the most gratifying thing anyone can do. During this week, each of you will come to realize the truthfulness of his wisdom. I commend your involvement in this project and your desire to better the lives of your fellow Americans. You are living proof that our country\u2019s future rests in very capable and very charitable hands.\"\u2014Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, California \"The areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina must be a priority for all Americans\u2014in Congress and throughout the United States. It is our moral obligation to acknowledge that there have always been two America\u2019s here in the United States; and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita lifted the curtain on the connection of race and poverty.... I am personally vested in eradicating the poverty across this country- particularly in the Gulf Coast and support increasing funding and job opportunities for our brothers and sisters trying to rebuild their lives.\"\u2014Congresswoman Barbara Lee, California \"Today's call to action serves as a critical resurgence of attention, compassion, and resources directed toward the residents and displaced of the Gulf Coast. The Louisiana Winter student volunteers will bring a sense of hope and new energy to the rebuilding efforts. There is so much that remains to be done in housing, employment, health care, and education. Only a national effort, fueled by the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project and the employment of tens of thousands of Gulf Coast residents, can bring about the healing and reconstruction of these vital communities. I am very proud of our San Jose State students who will be participating in Louisiana Winter week.\"\u2014Assemblywoman Sally Lieber, Speaker pro Tempore, California State Assembly \"Mississippians believe that we have worked diligently to put our lives and homes back together following Hurricane Katrina. The volunteers all agree. Now we have the opportunity to prove that on a national scale. The Gulf Coast Civic Works Project can help us remind others that there is still much work to be done and make our area whole again and that we still need the support and volunteerism of others.\"\u2014Brian Carriere, Gulfport City Council President \"The Gulf Coast Civic Works Project presents a common sense solution that's as bold and broad as the problem it's trying to solve. In addition to being more efficient than the approaches for rebuilding currently being considered, it represents an investment in the people of the Gulf--not large corporations--and most importantly, it gives survivors the power to rebuild their homes and their lives. ColorOfChange.org is proud to be a supporter of the Gulf Coast Civic Works Project.\"\u2014James Rucker, Director of Color Of Change ==References== Category:Proposed legislation of the 110th United States Congress Category:Effects of Hurricane Katrina Category:United States federal legislation articles without infoboxes ",
