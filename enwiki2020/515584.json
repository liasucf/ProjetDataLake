    "text": "Nyamuragira, also known as Nyamulagira, is an active shield volcano in the Virunga Mountains of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about north of Lake Kivu. The name is derived from the Kifuru and kishi verb Kuragira ngavu, meaning to herd cows; ngavu means cow or cows. It has been described as Africa's most active volcano and has erupted over 40 times since 1885. As well as eruptions from the summit, there have been numerous eruptions from the flanks of the volcano, creating new smaller volcanoes that have lasted only for a short time (e.g. Murara from late 1976 to 1977). Recent eruptions occurred on 2 January 2010 and 8 November 2011. ==Geography and geology== Nyamuragira volcano is an active volcano near the city of Goma of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about north of Lake Kivu. It is in the Nord-Kivu Province. It is north-north-west of Nyiragongo, the volcano which caused extensive damage to the city of Goma in its 2002 eruption. Nyamuragira has a volume of , and covers an area of . It has a low shield profile and contrasts with adjacent steep-sided Nyiragongo volcano. Sulfur dioxide emissions by volcanoes, 1979-2003. Nyamuragira volcano is responsible for a large portion of the sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere by volcanoes. Lava flows from Nyamuragira (upper left) extend to Lake Kivu. ==Recent activity== ===2010 eruption=== At dawn on 2 January 2010, Nyamuragira began spewing out lava flows. There are no settlements close to the volcano, but wildlife officials feared that the eruption may threaten the chimpanzees in the area. Another danger was that the lava could have flowed into the southern sector of Virunga National Park, where there are settlements and villages. Extensive lava flows from the 2010 eruption can be seen on satellite photographsGoogle Earth shows the crater and lava flows very clearly at coordinates -1.408333, 29.200000 reaching south-west to Lake Kivu, about north-west and north-north-east. ===2011 eruption=== The volcano erupted again on 5 November 2011. That eruption produced a high column of lava, and it is said to have been its largest eruption in 100 years. ===2014 lava lake=== Part of crater of Nyamuragira volcano In 2014, a new lava lake appeared at the volcano for the first time in 75 years. The previous lava lake at the volcano was emptied in the 1938 lava flow. The formation of the new lake occurred between June and August 2014. It reached a depth of }. The eruption did not affect the communities in the area but left a lot of ash and air pollution. Sulfate aerosols formed by volcanic sulfur dioxide from the eruptions were observed as far away as over the central Amazon rain forest in South America. By 2018, the lava lake had hardened and the activity appeared to have stopped. Eruptive activity continues during 2020 at the summit caldera. ==See also== * List of volcanoes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ==References== ==External links== * Nyamuragira Volcano * Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program: Nyamuragira * 2006 eruption * \"Congo volcano threat to villages\" BBC report with video, 2010 eruption * \"Nyamuragira volcano - VolcanoDiscovery\" Information, news, videos and photos from the 2011-2012 eruption * VolcanoDiscovery news Category:Polygenetic shield volcanoes Category:Active volcanoes Category:Virunga Mountains Category:Volcanoes of the Great Rift Valley Category:Mountains of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Volcanoes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Lake Kivu ",
