    "text": "Earthbeat is a compilation album of Future Sound of London's early releases, using several aliases. All of the tracks on this album are by Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans (FSOL) but under pseudonyms such as 'Mental Cube' and 'Yage'. The duo had been releasing songs under these aliases for around two years before they recorded \"Accelerator\" as FSOL.http://www.secondthought.co.uk/fsol/ The reason given by Cobain for releasing it is that they wanted to release an EP with loads of singles on it and that at the time they were strapped for cash and they were getting \u00a31000 a track. This album is also very rare as it has been out of print for years. ==Track listing== # Mental Cube - Q (Original) - 4:15 # Yage - Quazi - 6:32 # Candese - You Took My Love - 4:19 # The Future Sound of London - Papua New Guinea (Dumb Child Of Q) - 4:23 # Indo Tribe - Owl - 4:57 # Semi Real - People Livin' Today - 5:03 # Yage - Theme From Hot Burst - 4:35 # Indo Tribe - Shrink - 4:27 # Mental Cube - So This Is Love - 4:51 # Mental Cube - Chile Of The Bass Generation - 4:02 # Smart Systems - Tingler (Remix) - 5:04 # Yage - Coda Coma - 4:51 # Indo Tribe - In The Mind Of A Child - 5:04 # Humanoid - Stakker Humanoid (Coby '94 Mix) - 6:06 # Smart Systems - Creator - 2:58 # Indo Tribe - Bite The Bullet Baby - 3:16 ==Crew== *Written, composed and produced by FSOL *Cover art by Buggy G.
