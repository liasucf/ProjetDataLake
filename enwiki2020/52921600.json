    "text": "{| |} The Reggiane Re.2006 was an Italian fighter aircraft, of which only one prototype was built. == Development == In 1943, Reggiane started work on a version of the Re.2005 that was powered by a Daimler-Benz DB 603. After the bombing of the Reggiane plants in Reggio Emilia, the development team was able to move to Correggio along with some of the finished parts, which were hidden in a high school. They completed the construction of the prototype (without the engine), however, it was not handed over to the German Air Force. The project was kept secret and no information was disclosed to the public. == Aircraft on display == In 1946, the Royal Air Force studied the Re.2006, but it was of little of value and was destroyed, having never flown. However, a part of the landing gear survived and is displayed at Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci. == See also == ==References== Category:Reggiane aircraft Category:World War II Italian fighter aircraft Category:1940s Italian fighter aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft ",
