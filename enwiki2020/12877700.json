Since the fall of Gaddafi regime in 2011, the status regarding homosexuality in Libya remains unchanged. == Legality of same-sex sexual activity == ===Criminal laws=== The country's criminal code prohibits all sexual activity outside of a lawful marriage. Under Article 410 of the Libyan Penal Code, Private homosexual acts between consenting adults are illegal. In the 1990s, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi began to enact \"purification\" laws designed to enforce a harsh view of Islamic law on the population. Libyan courts were given the power to use amputation, flogging and other punishments against persons found to be violating traditional Islamic morality.Stokke, Hugo; Suhrke, Astri; Tostensen, Arne; Haan\u00e6s, \u00d8ystein Rygg (1997). Human Rights in Developing Countries: Yearbook 1997. The Hague: Kluwer International. . In 2010, the Gay Middle East blog, reported that two adult men had been charged with \"indecent acts\", which meant cross-dressing and homosexual conduct.Littauer, Dan (25 December 2010). \"Libya: Two Men Arrested for 'Indecent Acts'. gaymiddleeast.com (via globalgayz.com). Retrieved 15 September 2011. Female homosexuality would also appear to be illegal, as is making any sort of public acknowledgment that a person is gay. In 2010 a French asylum case involved a Libyan girl who sought asylum after being jailed, raped and then returned to her family for a forced marriage after she made a public statement online that she was gay.Staff (25 October 2010). \"Libya: Lesbian To Request Asylum In France\". Ansa Mediterranean (via globalgayz.com). Retrieved 15 September 2011. Vigilante executions, in lieu of the penal code, are more commonplace in ISIS-controlled territories. The criminal code is still technically in operation, although much of Libya is run by competing militias who may choose to execute LGBT people. ISIS in Libya has publicly executed men for homosexuality. ===Gaddafi Government=== The Gaddafi government did not permit the public advocacy of LGBT rights. When discussed, it was always in a negative manner, in keeping with traditional Islamic morality. In 2003, Gaddafi stated that he believed that it was \"impossible\" to contract AIDS-HIV through unprotected, heterosexual vaginal sex.Young, Craig (8 March 2011). \"Being Gay under Gaddafi\" . GayNZ.com. Retrieved 15 September 2011. ===Transititional Government=== The Transitional post-Gaddafi government continues to oppose LGBT rights. In February 2012 a Libyan delegate sparked outrage after telling a United Nations human rights panel that gay people threaten the future of the human race. === Interim Constitution === The Transitional Constitution stipulates that Islam is the official religion and a source of law. The Transitional Constitution also pledges to respect the people's right to have a private life. 2019: As of 2019, Libya has one LGBTQ+ NGO called Kun Libya. Libya's LGBT identifying population remains as of today under pressure to remain closeted due to the fall of the state since 2014. ==Summary table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Same-sex sexual activity legal | https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/21/gay-lgbt-muslim-countries- middle-east Punishment of 4 years or vigilante execution |- | Equal age of consent | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment only | No |- | Anti- discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services | No |- | Anti- discrimination laws in all other areas (incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) | No |- | Same-sex marriages | No |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | No |- | Step-child adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Gays and lesbians allowed to serve openly in the military | No |- | Right to change legal gender | No |- | Access to IVF for lesbians | No |- | Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples | No |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No |} ==See also== *Human rights in Libya *LGBT rights in Africa ==References== Libya Category:Human rights in Libya Libya Category:LGBT in Libya Libya ",
