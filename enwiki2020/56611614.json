    "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured New Zealand in February and March 2019 to play three Tests and three One Day Internationals (ODIs). The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The tour ended early, with the cancellation of the third and final Test match, following the Christchurch mosque shootings. The tour started two day after the conclusion of the 2018\u201319 Bangladesh Premier League, with Bangladesh's coach Steve Rhodes saying that it is \"far from ideal preparation\". Conversely, Bangladesh's wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim said it would be ideal preparation ahead of the World Cup, with New Zealand having conditions similar to those in England. New Zealand won the ODI series 3\u20130, their fourth- consecutive whitewash in a bilateral ODI series at home against Bangladesh. Ross Taylor became New Zealand's leading run-scorer in One Day International cricket, after he surpassed Stephen Fleming's career total in the third ODI. Ahead of the tour to New Zealand, Bangladesh's Test captain Shakib Al Hasan suffered a hand injury. Mahmudullah was named as the captain of Bangladesh's team for the first and second Tests. Shakib was eventually ruled out of the third Test. Kane Williamson was ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the third and final Test, with Tim Southee named as captain in his place. However, the third Test was called off a day before the scheduled start of the match of 15 March 2019, due to the Christchurch mosque shootings. The Bangladesh team were on their way to one of the mosques in Christchurch for Friday prayers, but the team were able to escape to Hagley Oval. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) later confirmed that the team was safe and back at their hotel. New Zealand had won the first two Test matches to win the series 2\u20130. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=2|ODIs |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Kane Williamson (c) * Todd Astle * Tom Blundell * Trent Boult * Colin de Grandhomme * Matt Henry * Tom Latham * Henry Nicholls * Jeet Raval * Tim Southee * Ross Taylor * Neil Wagner * BJ Watling (wk) * Will Young | * Mahmudullah (c) * ~~Shakib Al Hasan (c)~~ * Khaled Ahmed * ~~Taskin Ahmed~~ * Liton Das (wk) * Mominul Haque * Mehedi Hasan * Nayeem Hasan * Ebadot Hossain * Tamim Iqbal * Shadman Islam * Taijul Islam * Abu Jayed * Mohammad Mithun * Mushfiqur Rahim (wk) * Mustafizur Rahman * Soumya Sarkar | * Kane Williamson (c) * Todd Astle * Trent Boult * Colin de Grandhomme * Lockie Ferguson * Martin Guptill * Matt Henry * Tom Latham (wk) * Colin Munro * James Neesham * Henry Nicholls * Mitchell Santner * Tim Southee * Ross Taylor * Will Young | * Mashrafe Mortaza (c) * ~~Shakib Al Hasan (vc)~~ * ~~Taskin Ahmed~~ * Liton Das (wk) * Mehedi Hasan * Nayeem Hasan * Rubel Hossain * Tamim Iqbal * Shafiul Islam * Mahmudullah * Mohammad Mithun (wk) * Mushfiqur Rahim (wk) * Mustafizur Rahman * Sabbir Rahman * Mohammad Saifuddin * Soumya Sarkar |} Ahead of the tour, Taskin Ahmed was ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to injury.
