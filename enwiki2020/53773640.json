    "text": "Sexuality in Africa has various manifestations with attitudes varying, according to by region. Attitudes towards sexuality may diverge along regions between Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, with the former having been under the influence of Christianity and the latter under the influence of Islam.Caldwell, John C., and Pat Caldwell. \"The cultural context of high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa.\" Population and development review (1987): 409-437. Much discussion surrounding sexuality in Africa focuses on the effects of sexually transmitted diseases.Helleve, Arnfinn, et al. \"South African teachers' reflections on the impact of culture on their teaching of sexuality and HIV/AIDS.\" Culture, health & sexuality 11.2 (2009): 189-204. Although there exist African communities that are accepting of female pleasure, others may repudiate against such an attitude,Njambi, Wairim\u0169 Ngaruiya. \"Dualisms and female bodies in representations of African female circumcision A feminist critique.\" Feminist Theory 5.3 (2004): 281-303. while others view sexual acts as primarily a path towards reproduction.Fanusie, Lloyda. \"Sexuality and women in African culture.\" The Will to Arise: Women, Tradition and the Church in Africa (1992): 135-154. Differences in genetic diversity show that in ancient African history, women were more likely than men to copulate and sire offspring, possibly due to female hypergamy.https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/24/women-men-dna-human- gene-pool ==References== ",
