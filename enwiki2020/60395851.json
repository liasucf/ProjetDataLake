    "text": "Carlos Alberto Yaqu\u00e9 (born 12 September 1971) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a forward. ==Career== Almagro were the club who gave Yaqu\u00e9 his start in senior football, with the forward appearing for the team in Primera B Metropolitana between 1989 and 1992. Yaqu\u00e9 moved abroad for the first time in 1992, signing for Colombia's Real Cartagena of Categor\u00eda Primera A. He departed midway through the year after just one appearance, as the club went on to suffer relegation. Yaqu\u00e9 had returned to Argentina with Nueva Chicago. After spending 1992\u201393 with them, Yaqu\u00e9 returned to third tier Almagro in 1994. They won promotion to Primera B Nacional in his second campaign back. He remained there for one further season. In 1997, Yaqu\u00e9 completed a move to Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Ferro Carril Oeste. Nine goals in twenty-eight fixtures followed. 1998 saw Yaqu\u00e9 leave his homeland once more, agreeing terms with Reggina of the Italian Serie B. He left halfway into the 1998\u201399 season, signing for Estudiantes in early 1999. Yaqu\u00e9 stuck with Estudiantes until the middle of 2000, which was followed by him signing a contract with Universitario. He scored eight goals for the Peruvians, which preceded Argentinos Juniors becoming Yaqu\u00e9's eighth club. His return to Argentina lasted until 2002, when Ecuador's L.D.U. Quito signed Yaqu\u00e9. Yaqu\u00e9, having featured eighteen times and netted eight goals in the Ecuadorian Serie A, had a stint in European football for the second time in 2003, after spending time with Ceuta in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B - scoring five times in twelve matches. A move to Hurac\u00e1n sealed a return to Argentina, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Thirty appearances with Hurac\u00e1n came, before Yaqu\u00e9 experienced 2004\u201305 with Defensores de Belgrano in tier two; though it would end with relegation. He rejoined Almagro for a third time in 2005, prior to having spells with Villa Mitre and Los Andes; who he'd score twenty-one goals for. After being sent off in his final appearance for Los Andes, Yaqu\u00e9 joined Almagro for a fourth time in 2009. He took his overall league tally for Almagro to two hundred and thirty-two games and one hundred and fifty-five goals - including ten goals in 2009\u201310, where he netted against former teams Los Andes and Nueva Chicago. Yaqu\u00e9 also scored home and away that season in fixtures with Comunicaciones, a club he would later join in 2011. However, prior to that, Yaqu\u00e9 played for Sarmiento - he found the net four times for the Jun\u00edn outfit. The final goal of his career came on 22 August 2011 during a defeat to Brown. ==Personal life== Yaqu\u00e9's sons, Nahuel and Nicol\u00e1s, are professional footballers; they both played for Almagro at differing levels within the club. Since retirement, Yaqu\u00e9 has worked as an agent; including for Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Real Cartagena |1992 |rowspan=\"1\"|Categor\u00eda Primera A |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Nueva Chicago |1992\u201393 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |14||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||14||2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Ferro Carril Oeste |1997\u201398 |rowspan=\"1\"|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |28||9||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||28||9 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Reggina |1998\u201399 |rowspan=\"1\"|Serie B |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Universitario |2000 |rowspan=\"1\"|Peruvian Primera Divisi\u00f3n |16||8||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4Appearance(s) in the Copa Libertadores||0||0||0||20||8 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|L.D.U.
