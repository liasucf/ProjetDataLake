    "text": "Hoplestigma is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hoplestigmataceae.Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. 2007. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. . One study of pollen suggested that Hoplestigma might be related to the family Ehretiaceae.Joan W. Nowicke and James S. Miller. 1989. \"Pollen morphology and the relationships of Hoplestigmataceae\". Taxon 38(1):12-16. In a comparison of chloroplast DNA sequences in 2014, Hoplestigma formed a strongly supported clade with Coldenia and genera that have always been placed in Cordiaceae.Maximilian Weigend, Federico Luebert, Marc Gottschling, Thomas L.P. Couvreur, Hartmut H. Hilger and James S. Miller. 2014. \"From capsules to nutlets \u2014 phylogenetic relationships in the Boraginales\". Cladistics 30(5):508-518. . The authors of that study recommended that Hoplestigma and Coldenia be included in Cordiaceae. Howerver, traditionally it was included in Boraginaceae sensu lato, as did the APG IV classificationPeter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website. (see External links below) but subsequently placed in its own family within the Boraginales order, by the Boraginales Working Group. Hoplestigma has two species. Both are rare trees of lowland jungle in West and Central Africa.David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book. Cambridge University Press: UK. The genus name Hoplestigma is derived from the Greek , \"a hoof or a cloven hoof\" and stigma, \"a flower stigma\". The botanical name is a reference to the deeply bifid style.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume II. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK.
