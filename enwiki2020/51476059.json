    "text": "Ange-Laurent de La Live de Jully (2 October 1725 \u2013 18 March 1779) was an 18th- century French financier and patron of arts. On 30 June 1741, he married Louise-Elisabeth Chambon, reputed to be more than promiscuous. Madame d'\u00c9pinay tells us she pushed the absence of prejudice to the limit where it takes another name. But even though, she had a son, June 7, 1750. She died in December 1752, struck down by smallpox. We know he led political missions in Geneva. On 1 August 1762, he married his second wife, miss Nettine Walckiers, daughter of a Dutch banker and thus became Jean-Joseph de Laborde's brother- in-law, owner of the ch\u00e2teau de M\u00e9r\u00e9ville. == Honours == * 27 April 1754 : Free Associate of the Acad\u00e9mie de peinture * 20 January 1756 : * Chevalier, baron du Ch\u00e2telet, marquis de R\u00e9moville, seigneur du franc-alleu noble de Saint-Romain == External links == * Ange Laurent de La Live de Jully * Genealogy Category:1725 births Category:People from Paris Category:1775 deaths Category:French financiers ",
