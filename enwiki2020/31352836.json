Engineers in a variety of industries use its software to evaluate the performance of proposed designs in the early phases of the project with the goal of identifying and eliminating potential design flaws. ==History== ESI (Engineering System International) was founded as Engineering Systems International in France in 1973 by Alain de Rouvray along with three other recent PhD.s from the University of California Berkeley: Jacques Dubois, Iraj Farhoomand and Eberhard Haug. The company initially operated as a consulting company for European defense, aerospace and nuclear industries.Reuters company profile of ESI Group On May 30, 1978 the company presented the simulation of an accidental crash of a military fighter plane into a nuclear power plant at a Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) meeting in Stuttgart.E. Haug. (1981) \"Engineering safety analysis via destructive numerical experiments\", EUROMECH 121, Polish Academy of Sciences, Engineering Transactions 29(1), 39\u201349. German automobile manufacturers then tested the applicability of several emerging commercial crash simulation codes, including what would become Pam-Crash crash simulation software. As part of this project, the software's initial version simulated the frontal impact of a full passenger car structure, a Volkswagen Polo car model, in a collision with a rigid concrete barrier at 50 km/h, in an overnight computer run. This was the first successful full-car frontal crash simulation ever performed.E. Haug, T. Scharnhorst, P. Du Bois (1986) \"FEM- Crash, Berechnung eines Fahrzeugfrontalaufpralls\", VDI Berichte 613, 479\u2013505. Finite element simulation provided accurate determination of the structural deformations while rigid body simulation was used during the relatively unimportant deformation and free-flight phases of the simulation.A.K. Pickett, H.G. Hoeck, A. Poth and W. Sehrepfer, \u201cCrashworthiness analysis of a full automotive rollover test using a mixed rigid body and explicit finite element approach.\u201d VDI Berichte 816, p 167-179.

Editor at Large Anthony Lockwood said: \"The Virtual Performance Solution embraces a lot of things, such as gold-standard tools like Pam-Crash. But what it really provides you is an integrated simulation environment... You work across multiple analysis domains with a single core model \u2013 not different models for every load case. This streamlines your workflow, saving time and money by reducing the number of individual solvers you have to deploy and all that model re-creation business.\"Anthony Lockwood, \u201cEditor\u2019s Pick: ESI Releases Virtual Performance Solution,\u201d Desktop Engineering, July 21, 2010.

In a review of VA One, the company's vibro-acoustic simulation software, Desktop Engineering said: \"VA One combines finite elements (FE), boundary elements (BEM), and statistical energy analysis (SEA) in a single model. And you can use it whenever during your design stages, so it minimizes physical prototypes, last-hour design corrections, and a ton of best-guess work. With VA One you can set up your NVH model in a few hours and have your results in minutes if not sooner.\"Anthony Lockwood, \u201cEditor\u2019s Pick: ESI Announces VA One V2009,\u201d Desktop Engineering, March 10, 2010.

The demo pilot moved the reviewer through the plant and right up to a car. The review stated: \"Andre [the demo pilot] was able to move us through the plant and right up to the car. He then walked us through the steps that an employee would go through to install a battery, ratchet in a bolt and install a gas tank. Throughout the demo he pointed out areas of possible interference between the virtual car design and the assembly process.\"John Hayes, \u201cImmersive Virtual Reality,\u201d Engineering.com DesignerEdge, November 28, 2012. == References == == External links == * Category:Software companies of France Category:Simulation software Category:Open Source computer aided engineering applications Category:Companies based in Paris Category:French brands ",
