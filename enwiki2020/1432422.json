Mass grave at the Killing Field of Choeung Ek. The Killing Fields (, ) are a number of sites in Cambodia where collectively more than a million people were killed and buried by the Khmer Rouge regime (the Communist Party of Kampuchea) during its rule of the country from 1975 to 1979, immediately after the end of the Cambodian Civil War (1970\u20131975). The mass killings are widely regarded as part of a broad state-sponsored genocide (the Cambodian genocide). Analysis of 20,000 mass grave sites by the DC-Cam Mapping Program and Yale University indicates at least 1,386,734 victims of execution.Documentation Center of CambodiaYale Cambodian Genocide Program Estimates of the total deaths resulting from Khmer Rouge policies, including death from disease and starvation, range from 1.7 to 2.5 million out of a 1975 population of roughly 8 million. In 1979, Vietnam invaded Democratic Kampuchea and toppled the Khmer Rouge regime, an act that is viewed as having ended the genocide. The Cambodian journalist Dith Pran coined the term \"killing fields\" after his escape from the regime. The Khmer Rouge regime arrested and eventually executed almost everyone suspected of connections with the former government or with foreign governments, as well as professionals and intellectuals. Ethnic Vietnamese, ethnic Thai, ethnic Chinese, ethnic Cham, Cambodian Christians, and the Buddhist monks were the demographic targets of persecution. As a result, Pol Pot has been described as \"a genocidal tyrant\". Martin Shaw described the Cambodian genocide as \"the purest genocide of the Cold War era\".Theory of the Global State: Globality as Unfinished Revolution by Martin Shaw, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 141, Ben Kiernan estimates that about 1.7 million people were killed.\"The CGP, 1994\u20132008\". Cambodian Genocide Program, Yale University Researcher Craig Etcheson of the Documentation Center of Cambodia suggests that the death toll was between 2 and 2.5 million, with a \"most likely\" figure of 2.2 million. After 5 years of researching some 20,000 grave sites, he concludes that \"these mass graves contain the remains of 1,386,734 victims of execution\". A UN investigation reported 2\u20133 million dead, while UNICEF estimated 3 million had been killed.William Shawcross, The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust, and Modern Conscience (Touchstone, 1985), pp. 115\u2013116 Demographic analysis by Patrick Heuveline suggests that between 1.17 and 3.42 million Cambodians were killed,Heuveline, Patrick (2001). \"The Demographic Analysis of Mortality in Cambodia\". In Forced Migration and Mortality, eds. Holly E. Reed and Charles B. Keely. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. while Marek Sliwinski suggests that 1.8 million is a conservative figure. Even the Khmer Rouge acknowledged that 2 million had been killed\u2014though they attributed those deaths to a subsequent Vietnamese invasion.Khieu Samphan, Interview, Time, March 10, 1980 By late 1979, UN and Red Cross officials were warning that another 2.25 million Cambodians faced death by starvation due to \"the near destruction of Cambodian society under the regime of ousted Prime Minister Pol Pot\",The New York Times, August 8, 1979. who were saved by international aid after the Vietnamese invasion. ==Process== Rooms of the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum contain thousands of photos taken by the Khmer Rouge of their victims. The judicial process of the Khmer Rouge regime, for minor or political crimes, began with a warning from the Angkar, the government of Cambodia under the regime. People receiving more than two warnings were sent for \"re-education\", which meant near-certain death. People were often encouraged to confess to Angkar their \"pre-revolutionary lifestyles and crimes\" (which usually included some kind of free-market activity; having had contact with a foreign source, such as a U.S. missionary, international relief or government agency; or contact with any foreigner or with the outside world at all), being told that Angkar would forgive them and \"wipe the slate clean.\" They were then taken away to a place such as Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek for torture and/or execution. The executed were buried in mass graves. In order to save ammunition, the executions were often carried out using poison, spades or sharpened bamboo sticks. Inside the Buddhist Memorial Stupa at Choeung Ek, there is evidence of bayonets, knives, wooden clubs, hoes for farming and curved scythes being used to kill victims, with images of skulls, damaged by these implements, as evidence. In some cases the children and infants of adult victims were killed by having their heads bashed against the trunks of Chankiri trees, and then were thrown into the pits alongside their parents. The rationale was \"to stop them growing up and taking revenge for their parents' deaths.\" Some victims were required to dig their own graves; their weakness often meant that they were unable to dig very deep. The soldiers who carried out the executions were mostly young men or women from peasant families. ==Prosecution for crimes against humanity== In 1997 the Cambodian government asked for the UN's assistance in setting up a genocide tribunal. It took nine years to agree to the shape and structure of the court\u2014a hybrid of Cambodian and international laws\u2014before the judges were sworn in, in 2006.Doyle, Kevin. \"Putting the Khmer Rouge on Trial\", Time, July 26, 2007MacKinnon, Ian Crisis talks to save Khmer Rouge trial, The Guardian, March 7, 2007The Khmer Rouge Trial Task Force , Royal Cambodian Government The investigating judges were presented with the names of five possible suspects by the prosecution on July 18, 2007. On September 19, 2007 Nuon Chea, second in command of the Khmer Rouge and its most senior surviving member, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. He faced Cambodian and foreign judges at the special genocide tribunal and was convicted on 7 August 2014 and received a life sentence. On July 26, 2010 Kang Kek Iew (aka Comrade Duch), director of the S-21 prison camp, was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment. His sentence was reduced to 19 years, as he had already spent 11 years in prison.Sentence reduced for former Khmer Rouge prison chief. The Los Angeles Times, July 27, 2010 On February 2, 2012, his sentence was extended to life imprisonment by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. He died on September 2, 2020 Khmer Rouge executioner 'Comrade Duch' who oversaw notorious torture prison dies age 77. CNN, September 2, 2020. ==Legacy== The best known monument of the Killing Fields is at the village of Choeung Ek. Today, it is the site of a Buddhist memorial to the victims, and Tuol Sleng has a museum commemorating the genocide. The memorial park at Choeung Ek has been built around the mass graves of many thousands of victims, most of whom were executed after interrogation at the S-21 Prison in Phnom Penh. The majority of those buried at Choeung Ek were Khmer Rouge killed during the purges within the regime. Many dozens of mass graves are visible above ground, many which have not been excavated yet. Commonly, bones and clothing surface after heavy rainfalls due to the large number of bodies still buried in shallow mass graves. It is not uncommon to run across the bones or teeth of the victims scattered on the surface as one tours the memorial park. If these are found, visitors are asked to notify a memorial park officer or guide. A survivor of the genocide, Dara Duong, founded The Killing Fields Museum in Seattle, US. ==See also== * Alive in the Killing Fields \u2013 book * Enemies of the People (film) * First Indochina War * First They Killed My Father \u2013 by Loung Ung * Son Sen * Ta Mok * Vietnam War * Mass killings under communist regimes * Never Fall Down * Funan ==References== ==External links== *The Killing Fields Museum \u2013 A museum based in Seattle, US dedicated to preserving the history of the Killing Fields. *Cambodia Tribunal Monitor *Photographs from S-21 \u2013 Photographs from Tuol Sleng (S-21) *Denise Affon\u00e7o: To The End Of Hell: One Woman's Struggle to Survive Cambodia's Khmer Rouge.
