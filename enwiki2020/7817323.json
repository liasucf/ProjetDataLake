    "text": "Interleukin-26 (IL-26) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL26 gene. IL-26 is the most recently identified member of the IL-20 cytokine subfamily, which was formed according to the usage of common receptor subunits and similarities in target-cell profiles and functions. All cytokines belonging to this subfamily are members of the larger IL-10 family. IL-26 is expressed in certain herpesvirus-transformed T cells but not in primary stimulated T cells. IL-26 signals through a receptor complex comprising two distinct proteins called IL-20 receptor 1 and IL-10 receptor 2. By signaling through this receptor complex, IL-26 induces rapid phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3, which enhance IL-10 and IL-8 secretion and as expression of the CD54 molecule on the surface of epithelial cells. == Gene organization and protein structure == The IL26 gene is conserved in various vertebrates. It is located on chromosome 12 (12q15), between the genes encoding IL-22 and IFN\u03b3. Originally named AK155, IL-26 was categorized in the IL-10 cytokine family due to sequence homology and secondary structure similarities. IL-26 is a 171-amino acid protein that exhibits six alpha helices connected by loops and four conserved cysteine residues. Endogenous IL-26 is expressed as a 36 kDa homodimer. == Expression == The IL-26 expression was initially discovered in human HVS-transformed T cells. Since then it was confirmed that T helper 1 cells and Th17 memory CD4+ cells are the major source of IL-26. More accurately, IL-26 is expressed by pro-inflammatory IL-17 producing T cells in chronically inflamed tissues. Furthermore, CD26+ CD4+ T cells produce IL-26 in a model of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). CD4+ T cells polarized toward a regulatory phenotype (Treg), na\u00efve CD4+ T cells, and T helper 2 cells show low or no expression of IL-26. ==Role== Interleukin 26 (IL-26) is an inflammatory mediator and a driver of chronic inflammation due to its ability to act as a carrier of extracellular DNA and as an antimicrobial molecule. These properties suggest that IL-26 can be categorized as a kinocidin. Most biological functions of IL-26 have been identified in pathological situations that feature chronic inflammation. The expression of IL-26 is elevated in Crohn\u2019s disease and it was reported that IL-26 induces the expression of IL-8 and TNF\u03b1 as well as IL-10 in human gut epithelial cells. IL-26 is a natural human antimicrobial that promotes immune sensing of bacterial and host cell death. IL-26, a human Th17 cell\u2013derived cytokine, is a cationic amphipathic protein that kills extracellular bacteria via membrane-pore formation. Furthermore, Th17 cell\u2013derived IL-26 formed complexes with bacterial DNA and self-DNA released by dying bacteria and host cells. The IL-26\u2013DNA complexes triggered the production of type I interferon by plasmacytoid dendritic cells via activation of Toll-like receptor 9, but independently of the IL-26 receptor. The roles of IL-26 in normal physiology remain unknown. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Interleukins ",
