Arriving in Paris in 1938, he began studying piano and music theory with , wrote his Opus 1, a string quartet (for the family!) and then returned to the Conservatoire de Paris (direction of Claude Delvincourt) in specialized solfege class, at Lucette Descaves, where he met Michel Legrand, Roger Boutry, Jean-Michel Defaye and Alain Weber. He then followed Jules Gentil's piano class (1st medal) - studied harmony with Jacques de La Presle (1st prize) - counterpoint and fugue with No\u00ebl Gallon (1st medal and 1st prize) - finally musical composition with Tony Aubin (1st Prix de Rome in 1953 with Ouverture \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise for 2 pianos). He won the 2nd Prix de Rome in 1955 with the cantata Le Rire de Gargantua then 1st Grand Prix de Rome in 1957 with the cantata La f\u00e9e Urg\u00e8le. Bernaud stayed 40 months at the Villa M\u00e9dicis, a stay during which he wrote a quartet for saxophones, Les chants de la jungle - six melodies for baritone and string orchestra on poems from Rudyard Kipling, a Symphony, an Ouverture pour orchestre de chambre (1960), a Messe br\u00e8ve for mixed choir and organ (1958), a Nocturne pour orchestre \u00e0 cordes, Sept m\u00e9lodies pour fl\u00fbte et mezzo soprano on poems by Omar Khayyam. Back in France, he wrote scores for television shows Pr\u00e9sence du pass\u00e9, for short films and also feature films and was appointed, in 1963, professor of solfege for instrumentalists at the Conservatoire de Paris, and a little later, in 1971, harmony teacher in the same establishment.
