Baron Stephan von Sarter (1833\u20131902), a broker and banker, planned to live there, but never did. The villa is owned by the State Foundation of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is served by an intermediate station on the Drachenfels Railway. == Gallery == Treppenhaus im Nordturm von Schloss Drachenburg.jpg|Staircase in Schloss Drachenburg File:20130816 Schloss Drachenburg 02.jpg|View from below (Bonn-Mehlem) File:Drachenburg mit Park, Senkrechtaufnahme.JPG|Schloss Drachenburg from above Schloss Drachenburg Luftbild 01.jpg SchlossDrachenburg1900.jpg|Schloss Drachenburg in 1900 File:20130816 Drachenfels.jpg|Schloss Drachenburg (left) and the Drachenfels ruin (right) on the Drachenfels mountain ==External links== * * Schloss Drachenburg - official site * Schloss Drachenburg - official site Category:Houses completed in 1884 Category:Palaces in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Germany Category:Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) Category:Museums in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Historic house museums in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Rhein-Sieg-Kreis ",
