    "text": "The 2019 Sky Blue FC season is the team's tenth season as a professional women's soccer team. Sky Blue FC plays in the National Women's Soccer League, the top tier of women's soccer in the United States. Since the 2018 Sky Blue finished in last place and only won one game, 2019 offered opportunities for improvement. The off-season didn't get off to a promising start as two of the team's top draft picks, Hailie Mace (2nd overall pick) and Julia Ashley (6th overall pick) chose not to sign with the club. Mace signed with FC Roseng\u00e5rd and Ashley with Link\u00f6pings FC. Sky Blue's third and fourth picks, Paige Monaghan (10th overall pick) and Julie James (11th overall pick) did however choose to come to preseason and were ultimately signed. During preseason training two Sky Blue players suffered season-ending injuries. Defender Mandy Freeman ruptured her Achilles tendon and midfielder Madison Tiernan tore her ACL and MCL. On April 9, 2019 General Manager and President Tony Novo resigned from his position, Sky Blue Vice-President Alyse LaHue was appointed to take over as interim general manager. Kyra Carusa, Sky Blue's 19th overall pick in the 2019 Draft signed with Le Havre AC in France on April 25th, making her the third Sky Blue draft pick to sign in Europe. On June 28th, Denise Reddy was fired as the team's head coach. Her record as head coach was 1-8-24. Goalkeeper coach Hugo Macedo filled in on a temporary basis until the club named Freya Coombe interim head coach on September 4. Sky Blue played their first ever game at Red Bull Arena on August 18th against Reign FC. They set a club record with 9,415 in attendance for the game, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw. The positive feedback and high demand led the club to move their September 29th home finale to Red Bull Arena, where they drew 8,314 for a 1\u20131 draw against the Orlando Pride. ==Team== ===First-team roster=== As of July 19, 2019 ==Competitions== ===Preseason=== ===Regular season=== ==== Regular season standings ==== ===== Results summary ===== ===== Results by round ===== == Statistical leaders == ===Top scorers=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: left;\" |- !Rank !Player !Goals |- !1 | Carli Lloyd !8 |- !2 | Raquel Rodriguez !3 |- !rowspan=3|3 | Jen Hoy !rowspan=3|2 |- | Imani Dorsey |- | Paige Monaghan |- !rowspan=4|6 | Sarah Killion !rowspan=4|1 |- | McKenzie Meehan |- | Domi Richardson |- | Elizabeth Eddy |- |} === Top assists === {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- !Rank !Player !Assists |- !rowspan=2|1 | Sarah Killion !rowspan=2|3 |- | Raquel Rodriguez |- !rowspan=9|3 | Carli Lloyd !rowspan=9|1 |- | Paige Monaghan |- | Jen Hoy |- | Elizabeth Eddy |- | Julie James |- | Nahomi Kawasumi |- | Amandine Pierre- Louis |- | Kenie Wright |- | Savannah McCaskill |- |} === Shutouts === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Player !Clean Sheets |- !1 | Kailen Sheridan !3 |} == Player transactions == ===2019 NWSL College Draft=== : Source: National Women's Soccer League {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Round !Pick !
