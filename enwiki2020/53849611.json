    "text": "Rafael Nadal won his 10th French Open title (his first since 2014) and 15th Grand Slam singles title, defeating Stan Wawrinka in the final, 6\u20132, 6\u20133, 6\u20131 to win the Men's Singles tennis title at the 2017 French Open. Nadal is the only male player ever to win 10 singles titles at the same Grand Slam event. Nadal lost only 35 games in the tournament, his personal best, and the second- best in the tournament's history after Bj\u00f6rn Borg in 1978. Nadal won this event without losing a set for the third time, thereby tying with Borg for this Grand Slam record. Novak Djokovic was the defending champion, but was defeated by Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals. Djokovic was attempting to become the first male player in the Open Era to achieve a double career Grand Slam. This was the first time since 2010 that Djokovic did not reach at least the semifinals at Roland Garros, and it was also the first time since 2009 that Djokovic lost a match in straight sets at Roland Garros. The hard-fought semifinal between Wawrinka and Andy Murray was notable in that it marked the end for both players at the top of the sport, as both suffered injuries that took them out of the game for months.https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/40224502https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2019/01/11/has- andy-murrays-hip-injury-brought-brink-retirement/ As of the 2020 Australian Open, neither player has made it back to a Grand Slam semi-final. Nadal became the third man after Ken Rosewall and Pete Sampras to win a grand slam in his teens, twenties, and thirties. This was the last Grand Slam tournament for former World No. 12 Paul-Henri Mathieu and the last French Open appearance for former three-time quarterfinalist and World No. 9 Nicolas Almagro. It was also the first Grand Slam appearance of future ATP Finals champion Stefanos Tsitsipas, who lost to Ivo Karlovi\u0107 in the first round. ==Seeds== ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==References== ==External links== *Official Roland Garros 2017 Men's Singles Draw *2017 French Open \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Singles Category:French Open by year \u2013 Men's Singles French Open - Men's Singles ",
