Alamos, Sonora, 1696-1968 Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica. Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n His recorded paternal baptismal surname was Corrales, however the surname Corral is commonly used. Image of Ramon Corral's baptism registration from 21 January 1854 Ram\u00f3n Corral first gained public attention in 1872, when General Don Ignacio L. Pesqueira, Governor of the State of Sonora, an undefeated general who had provided many services to his state, created public outrage when he introduced state constitutional reforms. To avoid compliance with a law, Pesqueira introduced, among other reforms, a ban on re-election governor. The young Corral vigorously fought against the Pesqueira administration through the press, founding the newspapers El Fantasma (\"The Phantom\"), and La Voz de \u00c1lamos (\"The Voice of \u00c1lamos\"). His writings in the papers exhibited civil valor, love for democracy, and power as a political adversary of the Pesqueira administration. In the years that followed, Corral increasingly became involved in politics. While General Secretary of the Government of Sonora, Corral was involved with the capture of the indigenous Yaqui military leader Jos\u00e9 Maria Leiva, known as Cajem\u00e9. In La Constituci\u00f3n (Peri\u00f3dico oficial del gobierno del estado libre y soberano de Sonora), beginning with the issue of April 22, 1887, and ending July 8, 1887, Corral published biographical notes about Cajem\u00e9, which were recorded only a few days earlier during personal talks with the captured Yaqui. Cajem\u00e9 was being held at the time in the house of the military chief of the area, Angel Mart\u00ednez, who had personally arrested him while Cajem\u00e9 was hiding in San Jose de Guaymas. Corral married Amparo V. Escalante on February 25, 1888. She was the daughter of Vicente Escalante, a well-known Mexican statesman of the time. The religious element of the twofold marriage ceremony was performed by Father Ortega of Hermosillo, with a civil ceremony performed by Civil Judge Bonito M\u00e9ndez, of the Hermosillo District.A Wedding in Mexico. The New York Times, 1888La Constituc\u00edon. March 2, 1888. p. 2 ==Political career== Corral was one of the cient\u00edficos who advised Mexican President Porfirio D\u00edaz. Corral served as Secretary of State from 1891 to 1895. He became Governor of the Federal District of Mexico in 1900 and was sworn in as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of D\u00edaz in 1903. He became vice-president in 1904 and was re-elected in 1910.Paul Garner, Porfirio D\u00edaz.

Corral traveled with his family to Paris for medical care, where he was diagnosed with cancer. After his operation, the cancer was found to be incurable. In light of his own deteriorating health and the increasing revolutionary opposition to the D\u00edaz government, Corral submitted his resignation, dated May 10, 1911, to Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra, D\u00edaz\u2019s foreign secretary, which de la Barra held until D\u00edaz submitted his own \"Renuncia\" on May 25, 1911.O'Shaughnessy, Edith. (1920). Intimate pages of Mexican history. pp.101-102. ===Letter of Resignation=== Corral's letter of resignation gave no doubt that he had foreknowledge of D\u00edaz's intention to resign, and that the course of events would lead to a new government for Mexico: On the two occasions that the national convention advanced my candidacy as Vice-President of the republic, to figure in the elections with Gen. Diaz as President, I stated that I was prepared to occupy any office in which compatriots considered that I would be of use, and that if the public vote conferred upon me a position so far above my merits, then my intention would be to second in all respects Gen. Diaz's policy, in order to co-operate with him, as far as it lay in my power, toward the aggrandizement of the nation, which had developed so notably under his administration. Those who concern themselves with public affairs and have observed their progress during the last few years will be able to say whether I have complied with my intention. For my part, I can say that I have never endeavored to bring about the least obstacle either in the President's policy or his manner of carrying it out even at the cost of sacrificing my convictions, both because this was the basis of my programme and because this corresponded to my position and my loyalty, as well as that I did not seek any prestige in the office of Vice-President, so useful in the United States and so discredited in Latin countries. In the events which have shaken the country during these latter months, the President has been brought to consider that it is patriotic to resign from the high office that the almost unanimous vote of Mexicans had conferred upon him in the last election, and that it is advisable at the same time, in the interest of the country, that the Vice-President do likewise, so that new men and new energies should continue forwarding the prosperity of the nation. Following my program of seconding Gen. Diaz's policy, I join my resignation with his and in the present note I retire from the office of Vice-President of the republic, begging the chamber to accept the same at the same time as that of the President. I beg of you gentlemen to inform yourselves of the above, which I submit with the protests of my highest consideration. Liberty and Constitution, Paris, May 4, 1911.
