    "text": "Ngawha Springs () is a small settlement approximately five kilometres east of the town of Kaikohe, Northland in New Zealand. It is the location of hot water springs that reputedly have therapeutic properties for those who bathe in their waters, and is the source of the steam used at the Ngawha geothermal field's power station. The nearby Northland Region Corrections Facility is the only prison in Northland. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \"the hot springs\" for Ng\u0101wh\u0101. Ng\u0101wh\u0101 Marae and its meeting house, E Koro Kia Tutuki, are a traditional meeting place for the local Ng\u0101puhi hap\u016b of Ng\u0101ti Kiriahi, Ng\u0101ti Mau, Ng\u0101ti Rangi, Te Uri Hoatau and Te Uri Taniwha. ==Waiariki Pools== Entry to the hot water springs cost $5 per adult. Facilities are very basic, there are no showers, only basic changing facilities; and it is recommended that you bring footwear. The pools themselves vary in temperature and so give a wide range of hot springs from the rather cool 32'c to the extremely hot \"Favourite\" and \"Doctor\". The nearby Ginns Ngawha Spa has been closed since 2015. ==External links== * Ngawha.com ==References== Category:Far North District Category:Hot springs of New Zealand Category:Landforms of the Northland Region ",
