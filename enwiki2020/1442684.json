Placenames Database of Ireland. is a Gaeltacht village in County Kerry, Ireland, on the Dingle Peninsula, 7 kilometres west of Dingle. Due to its long sandy beach, Ventry is a popular tourist destination. The town is connected to Dingle via the R559 regional road. Six kilometres west of Ventry are the ruins of Dunbeg (An D\u00fan Beag), an Iron Age promontory fort on the edge of a steep cliff. Near Dunbeg is Kilvickadownig, home to other archeological ruins, including examples of the beehive house and the grave of Caol or Ch\u00e1il Mic Crimthainn, the last to die in the Battle of Ventry from the well-known Fenian Cycle myths. A site of interest in Ventry parish is Rahinnane Castle, which was the residence of the Knight of Kerry. The Knight of Kerry lived there until Cromwellian times. The castle was built on the site of an old ringfort. The ringfort was built up and a second added with walls of six metres (20 feet), giving the appearance that there may have been a moat, although there never was one. Rahinnane Castle still has its very tiny, narrow, stone stairs, from the first to second floors, which can be carefully climbed. Ventry was home to P\u00e1id\u00ed \u00d3 S\u00e9, the well-known Kerry footballer, who owned a pub across from the parish church until his death in 2012. Canon James Goodman, the music collector and Professor of Irish at Trinity College, Dublin, was raised in Ventry. ==Ventry Bay== Ventry is located at the northeastern end of Ventry Bay, seen to the left in this photo The bay or harbour is a suitable anchorage for sailing and fishing boats.
