    "text": "Dino-Riders is an animated television series that first aired in 1988. Dino- Riders was primarily a promotional show to launch a new Tyco toy line. Only fourteen episodes were produced, three of which were produced on VHS for the United States. The show aired in the U.S. as part of the Marvel Action Universe programming block. The series focuses on the battle between the heroic Valorians and the evil Rulon Alliance on prehistoric Earth. The Valorians were a superhuman race, while the Rulons comprised several breeds of humanoids (ants, crocodiles, snakes, and sharks were the most common). Both races came from the future but were transported back in time to the age of dinosaurs. Once on Earth, the Valorians befriended dinosaurs, while the Rulons brainwashed them. ==Overview== The Valorians were a peaceful race that lived on Valoria until they were attacked by the Rulons. The Valorians attempted to escape the Rulon assault using their \"Space Time Energy Projector\" (S.T.E.P.); however, something went wrong. They were sent back in time, 65 million years to the age of the dinosaurs. Unknown to them, the Rulon flagship Dreadlock were also sent back through time when the S.T.E.P. was activated. After successfully landing on prehistoric Earth, the Valorians - led by Questar - used their AMP (\"Amplified Mental Projector\") necklaces to telepathically communicate with the dinosaurs they encountered and eventually befriended them. On the other hand, the Rulons - led by the warlord Krulos - used brainwashing devices known as brain-boxes to control dinosaurs for their own needs. The Rulons then launched an attack on the Valorians, who called upon their dinosaur friends to assist them in fighting back. After ultimately defeating the Rulons, the Valorians renamed themselves Dino-Riders. In regard to the dinosaur (and other animal) species present, the series is extremely anachronistic, showing late Cretaceous species like Tyrannosaurus rex alongside species from earlier eras, including the Permian genus Dimetrodon, which lived 200 million years earlier, before dinosaurs existed. ==Characters== ===Valorians=== * Questar (voiced by Dan Gilvezan) \u2013 The leader of the Valorians who is strong-willed and courageous. * Mind-Zei (voiced by Peter Cullen) \u2013 A blind elderly warrior with a sixth-sense for detecting people around him.

The first two episodes were produced for release on VHS as standalone specials, the first in 1987 and the second in 1988. Also in 1988, the series transitioned to television, with a further 11 episodes being produced and added to the specials to create a standard season's worth of 13 episodes. Lastly, in 1990, an additional VHS special was produced to promote the new range of \"Ice Age\" figures, released as \"Ice Age Adventure\" (but with the on-screen title \"Dino- Riders in the Ice Age\").

The Ice Age line focused on Ice age mammals rather than dinosaurs. The larger toys in the range also had a motorized walking action with the dinosaur's head swaying from side to side. Each Rulon faction toy came with a different self-automated trap. The dinosaurs were acclaimed for their highly detailed bodies and color, and impressed the Smithsonian Institution, who contacted Tyco to reproduce the dinosaurs (without the motorized mechanisms and wheels) for their \"Dinosaur and other Prehistoric Reptile Collection\". Dinosaur illustrator William Stout was credited for dinosaur design on the show's credits. ===Series 1 (1988)=== The release of the first series of Dino-Riders toys was timed to coincide with the cartoon series on television. It initially consisted of 5 Valorian and 6 Rulon toys, along with eight 2-figure packs. A sixth Valorian toy, Torosaurus, would be released at the end of the series. The Diplodocus, Torosaurus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Triceratops all had motorized walking mechanisms. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey;\" |- ! Valorians !

The Commandos consisted of a human figure with unique weapons and accessories. The most notable toy from this series was the Brontosaurus, which was the largest toy in the entire range, measuring 34 inches long and 15 inches tall. In an effort to keep costs down, Tyco had to abandon several features that were originally intended to be part of the figure. These included motorized walking action, four figures instead of three, and an entirely different weapons system. The Stegosaurus toy had motorized walking action, while the Pachycephalosaurus and Saurolophus both had a mechanism that allowed their bodies to thrust from a horizontal position with their tail in the air into a vertical position with their tail on the ground. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey;\" |- !

The dinosaur sets are among the rarest of the entire range due to a limited production run. The Quetzalcoatlus, originally released as a Valorian in Series 1, was re-released as a Rulon with a new yellow and spotted black paint scheme. The Pachyrhinosaurus had motorized walking action. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey;\" |- ! Valorians ! Rulons |- | Pachyrhinosaurus with Atlas | Quetzalcoatlus with Algar |- | Chasmosaurus with Llava | |} ====Ice Age==== The Ice Age subline was unique in that all of the animals produced belonged to the Valorian faction and, with the rest of the Series 3, are very hard to find. This line also included six more 2-figure packs. The Woolly Mammoth, the largest figure in the range, had motorized walking action. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey;\" |- !

The comics' storylines were considered to be much darker than the cartoon, sometimes focusing on conflicts between the Valorians. For instance, one storyline involves Questar being accused of murdering his jealous, scheming brother, Tark. The first comic book issue, \"The Path\", was released in February 1989 and was 23 pages long. A Dino-Riders Annual was later released as a hardcover book that contained both the first and second issues in one collection. ==Film adaptation== In October 2015, Tracking Board reported that Mattel has teamed with Solipsist Film to develop a live action Dino-Riders movie with Alissa Phillips and Stephen L\u2019Heureux producing. As of 2018, there is no indication in the media that the film is going forward. ==In other media== * In addition to the toys and comics, there were a number of other products released during the Dino-Riders run on television. These were primarily child-oriented products such as colouring books, puzzles, and crayons, but also included clothing, kites, stickers, and costumes. Tyco also released a number of Super Dough play sets. * The character Bix in the Dinotopia series is modeled after the Dino-Riders Protoceratops toy. * In the South Park cartoon episode \"Imaginationland Episode III\", a Rulon Dino-Rider on a Tyrannosaurus can be seen for several seconds marching in the background with the other evil characters. * In the Robot Chicken cartoon episode \"G.I. Jogurt\", the Dino- Riders have a rock song that is performed by Sebastian Bach. This theme song depicts the Dino-Riders treating the dinosaurs like weapons, running a labor camp to have the primitives make the Dino-Riders' stuff, and feeding babies to an armored Tyrannosaurus. Astra (voiced by Seth Green) quotes \"hey, at least we don't have sex with the dinosaurs\" while another person quotes \"speak for yourself, bro.\" * In the Teen Titans Go! episode \"Open Door Policy\" as part of the 5-day \"Island Adventures\" event, the Dino-Riders' battle-armored dinosaurs were parodied when Robin, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Raven find living dinosaurs like a Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Brontosaurus, Pterodactyl, and Velociraptor. They place battle armor on them to see which one is the strongest instead of planning a dinosaur theme park. This doesn't go well as the armored dinosaurs attacked the Teen Titans. In the final part of the \"Island Adventures\" titled \"The Titans Show,\" the armored dinosaurs are among the Island extras that help the Teen Titans fight Control Freak and the villains he assembled to watch this 5-day event. ==See also== * Planet of Dinosaurs * Terra Nova ==References== ==External links== * * * Dino-Riders at the Big Cartoon DataBase * A complete list of aired episodes * dinoriders.com A Dino-Riders fan site * \"Dino-Riders\" Series Recap * Toy and video information * Comic book credits * Dino-Riders by Tyco at www.figure- archive.net Category:1988 American television series debuts Category:1988 American television series endings Category:Action figures Category:Animated television series about dinosaurs Category:1980s toys Category:1980s American animated television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated science fantasy television series Category:Television series by Marvel Productions Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:Marvel Action Universe Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television Category:Television shows based on Mattel toys ",
