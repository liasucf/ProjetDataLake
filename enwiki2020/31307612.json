    "text": "The Santa Clara valley aquifer is a groundwater aquifer located in the southern San Francisco Bay Area. The geology of the Santa Clara valley aquifer consists of a complex stratigraphy of permeable and impermeable units. Management of aquifer resources is associated with the Santa Clara Valley Water District. ==History== The first half of the 20th century saw groundwater extraction increase with the increasing regional population of the Bay Area. Between 1912 and 1966 artesian pressure levels dropped by as much as . The decreasing pressure heads resulted in land subsidence of up to . Recent work has shown that refined management practices have halted land subsidence. ==Hydrogeology== Well core data indicate that the Santa Clara valley aquifer consists of between four and six different water bearing units. The aquifer is composed of both confined and unconfined units. Water bearing units are generally coarse-grained and separated by relatively fine-grained units. The thicknesses of coarse-grained sections vary between in the southeast and between in the south-central and southwestern areas of the valley. Temperature data from monitoring wells indicate that horizontal groundwater flow occurs primarily above in southern-central regions and above in southeastern areas. ==Management== Stream stewardship, wholesale water supply and flood protection for Santa Clara County, California is provided by the Santa Clara Valley Water District. ==References== Category:Aquifers in California Category:Bodies of water of Santa Clara County, California Category:Geology of Santa Clara County, California Category:Geography of the San Francisco Bay Area ",
