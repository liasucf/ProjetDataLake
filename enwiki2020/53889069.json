    "text": "Michael Isaac Peinovich (born 1977), commonly known by his pseudonym Mike Enoch, is an American neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist, blogger and podcast host. He founded the alt-right media network The Right Stuff and podcast The Daily Shoah. Through his work, Peinovich ridicules African Americans, Jews, and other minorities, advocates racial discrimination, and promotes conspiracy theories such as Holocaust denial and white genocide. Peinovich first drew media attention for his use of the \"Sieg Heil\" salute at a conference organized by Richard B. Spencer to celebrate Donald Trump's presidential election; in response to Spencer's cry of \"hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!,\" Peinovich led the audience in a series of Nazi salutes. The salutes were performed in front of a number of journalists, and footage of the speech and the Peinovich-inspired salutes was circulated by the mainstream media. According to Andrew Marantz, the event marginalized the alt right by defining it to the public as a neo-Nazi movement, and led to an exodus of Trump supporters. In early 2017, while operating his anti-semitic media network under the pseudonym Mike Enoch, he was doxxed by fellow neo- Nazis, who released biographical information about Peinovich that contradicted his professed ideology. The dox revealed that Peinovich's own wife was Jewish, and that their wedding had featured traditional Jewish rites and chanting. In addition to his founding of a neo-Nazi media network, Peinovich has drawn attention for his role in organizing book burnings. == Early life== Peinovich grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, in an upper-middle class Episcopalian family. His parents divorced at a young age. He is of Norwegian and Serbian descent. Peinovich attended Columbia High School.Staff. \"Philly.com: Top Neo- Nazi Shock Jock Grew Up in Maplewood NJ\", Village Green of Maplewood and South Orange, October 26, 2017. Accessed July 3, 2019. \"According to a report on Philly.com today, neo-Nazi shock jock and white supremacist Mike Enoch grew up in Maplewood NJ and attended Columbia High School.\" While in high school, Peinovich worked jobs delivering pizzas and chemically testing pools. After graduating high school, he attended and dropped out of several conventional and vocational higher education institutions. He worked in a warehouse for a stereo and electronics store, before eventually obtaining a more lucrative job in programming. After he was doxxed and publicly revealed to be an anti-Jewish conspiracy theorist, he lost his job. ==The Right Stuff== The Right Stuff (TRS) is a white nationalist, neo-fascist neo-Nazi blog founded by Enoch that hosts several podcasts, including The Daily Shoah and Fash the Nation as well Rebel Yell (named after the battle cry used by the Confederates) headed by Identity Dixie a Southern nationalist/neo-Confederate alt-right group modeled after the Identitarian movement and League of the South that is affiliated with TRS. The blog is best known for popularizing the use of \"echoes\", an antisemitic marker which uses triple parentheses around names used to identify Jews and people of the Jewish faith on social media. It is part of the broader alt-right movement in the United States. The Right Stuff was one of the first websites to make use of the term \"cuckservative\". According to the Anti- Defamation League, The Right Stuff, like similar organizations such as The Daily Stormer (a neo-Nazi website founded by Andrew Anglin), has coalesced into a network of regional groups known as \"TRS Pool Parties\" to coordinate activities in the real world, such as posting fliers promoting \"white heritage\" in various cities and universities in the United States and Canada. ===The Daily Shoah=== First broadcast in August 2014 and published weekly (and now three times every week), The Daily Shoah name uses the Hebrew language word referring to the Holocaust. Enoch originally created the show to be libertarian, and later began sharing antisemitic conspiracy theories around Episode 19, after reading The Culture of Critique by Kevin B. MacDonald. On the show Enoch, along with co-host Jesse Dunstan (\"Seventh Son\") and a rotating panel of co-hosts and guests (known as \"the Death Panel\") has addressed topics such as immigration, white nationalism, race relations, feminism, Zionism, anti-globalization and political correctness. The podcast is credited with creating the triple parentheses meme, also known as (((echo))), an antisemitic symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of Jewish ethnicity. , The Daily Shoah reportedly had an audience of 100,000 listeners. ==Doxing incident== In January 2017, users of the imageboard website 8chan leaked the identities of several of its key contributors, including Peinovich, and revealed that his wife was of Jewish ancestry. Other information released included the names of his family members, his job as a software developer, his home address on Manhattan's Upper East Side neighborhood, and his hometown of Maplewood, New Jersey. After initially attempting to deny the reports, Peinovich later admitted that the allegations were true. Though Peinovich initially planned to leave the network, he quickly changed his mind and vowed to continue his activities. In an audio statement released on their podcast, Daily Shoah co-host Seventh Son announced that Peinovich and his wife were separating. The revelation was met with mixed but mostly supportive reactions from individuals including David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer. Peinovich's father asked him to change his surname in light of his neo-Nazi political activities as \"Mike Enoch.\" ==Political activities== After U.S. Congressman Steve King tweeted praise for Netherlands political candidate Geert Wilders's stance against further immigration to Europe, Peinovich joined other alt-right voices in approval of King's position, stating \"King doubles down. Great job. Take note cucks, this is how you *actually* fight the left.\" He had expressed support for Donald Trump during the presidential election and the first months of his term, but disavowed him in April 2017 after Donald Trump ordered missile strikes against Syria. On April 9, Enoch took part in an anti-war protest opposing the 2017 Shayrat missile strike, in which 59 Tomahawk Cruise missiles were launched by the United States against the Shayrat Airbase controlled by the government forces of Bashar al-Assad. The protest, organized by Richard B. Spencer, was counter-protested by anti- fascist activists. On the next episode of The Daily Shoah, Enoch and Spencer railed against the perceived attitudes of mainstream conservatives, especially Baby Boomers, and spoke about the growing (and, in their opinions, undue) influence of Ivanka Trump and Senior Adviser Jared Kushner on President Donald Trump, as well as neoconservative and pro-Israel influences within the Trump administration. He also commented that the alt-right was now \"the only legitimate anti-war movement in the United States,\" and that the Antifa counter-protesters supported Trump and the military strike by virtue of counter-protesting an anti-war demonstration. On April 18, 2017, Enoch joined Richard B. Spencer in giving a talk at Auburn University where he expressed that he and the movement were breaking away from the new direction that the Trump administration was taking. While Auburn administration had initially cancelled the planned event, citing safety concerns, Enoch assisted Spencer in filing a lawsuit on First Amendment grounds. United States federal judge William Keith Watkins issued a ruling requiring Auburn to allow Spencer and Enoch to speak. In April 2018, he was retweeted by Ann Coulter following his dissemination of conspiracy theories relating to the Douma chemical attack in Syria claiming it was faked. After Newsweek asked Twitter for a comment, his account was suspended. ==See also== * Antisemitism in the United States * Criticism of multiculturalism * Criticism of Judaism ==Footnotes== ==References== * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Advocates of conspiracy theories involving Jews Category:Alt-right writers Category:Antisemitism in the United States Category:Anti-immigration politics in the United States Category:Critics of Judaism Category:Critics of multiculturalism Category:American nationalists Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:American people of Norwegian descent Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:American white nationalists Category:American neo-Nazis Category:Columbia High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:People from Maplewood, New Jersey Category:People from Pennsylvania Category:People from New York (state) Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:American bloggers Category:American white supremacists ",
