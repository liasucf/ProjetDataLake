    "text": "The Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational is a women's professional golf tournament on the LPGA Tour that is played in Michigan. A new event in 2019, it is held at Midland Country Club in Midland, Michigan. It is a team event, similar to the Zurich Classic of New Orleans on the PGA Tour, with alternate shot (foursome) in the first and third rounds and better ball (fourball) for the second and fourth rounds. Dow Chemical Company is the title sponsor. For the 2020 edition, the purse will be increased to $2.3 million, with the first place team splitting $559,000. This increase will give the tournament the largest purse on the LPGA Tour for an event that isn't one of the five majors, or the CME Group Tour Championship. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year || Date || Players || Country || Winning score || To par || Margin of victory || Purse ($) || Winner's share ($) |- | 2019 || Jul 20 || Cydney Clanton and Thidapa Suwannapura || || align=right|67-64-63-59=253 || align=center|\u221227 || 6 strokes || align=center|2,000,000 || align=center|241,269 (each) |} ==References== ==External links== * *Coverage on the LPGA Tour's official site Category:LPGA Tour events Category:Golf in Michigan Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2019 Category:2019 establishments in Michigan ",
