    "text": "Wrong is the fourth full-length album by Canadian punk rock band Nomeansno. It was released in 1989 through Alternative Tentacles record label. ==Overview== Wrong was described by drummer John Wright as the band's \"most popular album by a country mile\". When asked to speculate as to the reasons why Wrong enjoyed such relative success, John Wright attributed it to the mainstream success of Nirvana and the rising popularity of alternative music: ==Reception== The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal called it the band's best album, and rated the album as a 10 out of 10, stating, \"Wrong was the mightiest merger between the hateful aggression of punk and the discipline of heavy metal.\"Popoff, Martin: \"The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\", page 316.
