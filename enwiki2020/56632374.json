She entered the Bobsleigh World Cup during the 2015\u201316 season. In January 2017 she won the European Championship in Winterberg with brakewoman Annika Drazek. Later the same year she was part of the gold-winning German team in the mixed team event at the IBSF World Championships in K\u00f6nigssee. Before the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Germany's head coach Ren\u00e9 Spies changed the brakewomen of the country's two leading two-women bobsleighs: Drazek was assigned to pilot Stephanie Schneider, while Jamanka had to work with Schneider's former brakewoman Lisa Buckwitz, with Schneider and Drazek being the most aspiring German team for the Pyeongchang Games. However, Jamanka and Buckwitz won the event, winning Germany's first two-woman bobsleigh medal since 2006, while Schneider and Drazek, who both became injured during the Games, finished fourth. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:German female bobsledders Category:Olympic bobsledders of Germany Category:Bobsledders at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Berlin Category:Olympic gold medalists for Germany Category:Medalists at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in bobsleigh ",
