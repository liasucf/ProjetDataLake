She left Bristol on a voyage as a slave ship but her crew scuttled her in June before having embarked any slaves.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Reliance voyage #18265. Captain James Gordon acquired a letter of marque on 16 March 1804. He sailed from Bristol on 30 April (or 4 May), bound from Gambia to the West Indies. On 28 December Lloyd's List (LL) reported that Reliance, Gordon, master, had been lost in the Gambia River.LL \u21164178. In December 1807 Captain Gordon sued Reliances insurers for lost commission and privileges due to her loss when he scuttled her by fire. Reliance had arrived on the African coast in mid-June 1804. On 24 June a French privateer of superior force appeared. When it became clear that Reliance could neither fight nor escape, Gordon and his men fired her guns into her hold to hole her and then set fire to her to prevent the enemy from capturing her. He and his men then escaped ashore in her long boat. The court found for the plaintiff, Gordon, as the insurance policy expressly covered loss by fire. ==Citations and references== Citations References * * Category:1790 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Captured ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Bristol slave ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1804 Category:Ship fires Category:Scuttled vessels Category:Shipwrecks of Africa ",
