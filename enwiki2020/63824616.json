    "text": "NGC 2950 is a lenticular galaxy in Ursa Major about 60 million light years from the Milky Way. It was discovered in 1790 by the Anglo-German astronomer William Herschel. NGC 2950 is a field galaxy, it is not part of a galaxy cluster or galaxy group, and thus is gravitationally isolated. Measures that do not rely on redshift give a distance of 18,733 \u00b1 3,210 Mpc (\u223c61,1 million astronomical units), which is within the distance calculated by redshift. NGC 2950 hosts two nested stellar bars; the rotation frequency of the secondary bar is higher than that of the primary one. ==References== == External links == Category:Lenticular galaxies Category:Field galaxies Category:Ursa Major (constellation) 2950 27765 5176 ",
