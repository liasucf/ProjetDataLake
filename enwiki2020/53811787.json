    "text": "The Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo (NT1004) is an ecoregion containing p\u00e1ramo (high moorland) vegetation above the treeline in the Andes mountain range of northern Peru and southern Ecuador. Due to its isolation there are high levels of endemism. Despite many human settlements and some destruction of habitat by agriculture and mining, the ecoregion is relatively intact. ==Geography== ===Location=== The Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo is found in the upper regions of the Andes in northern Peru and southern Ecuador. The ecoregion has an area of . The p\u00e1ramo covers ridges and mountains in the high basins of the Piura and Cajamarca regions of Peru and in the south of Ecuador. The northern part of the ecoregion is surrounded by the Eastern Cordillera Real montane forests ecoregion. Further south it adjoins or is surrounded by Tumbes-Piura dry forests, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n dry forests, Peruvian Yungas, Ucayali moist forests, Sechura Desert and Central Andean wet puna. ===Terrain=== The Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo begins at the treeline around of elevation and extends upward to the permanent snowline at about . Some mountains are volcanic in origin from the Tertiary period, but there are also Paleozoic metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, Paleocene batholiths and areas of Precambrian rock. Terrain includes steep slopes on the high peaks, and flat or rolling tablelands cut by deep valleys in which the climate is milder. Soils are wet or marshy, with rocky regions and rock outcroppings. The p\u00e1ramo is the source of many streams that run down the east and west slopes of the Andes and provide an important source of water to the human populations lower down. In Peru it supplies the Quir\u00f3s, Huancabamba and Chinchipe rivers. ===Climate=== The K\u00f6ppen climate classification is \"Cfb\": warm temperate, fully humid, warm summer. The climate is cold, wet and very cloudy, with high rainfall. Temperatures generally fall below freezing at night. ==Ecology== The Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo ecoregion is in the neotropical realm, in the montane grasslands and shrublands biome. The wet shrublands are the most southern group of p\u00e1ramos in the Neotropical realm. The great Huancabamba Depression lies to the south of the ecoregion, a barrier that prevents flora and fauna from migrating between the north and south Andes mountains. The ecoregion is part of the Northern Andean P\u00e1ramo global ecoregion, which includes the Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo, Santa Marta p\u00e1ramo, Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo and Northern Andean p\u00e1ramo terrestrial ecoregions. The plants and animals are adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the high peaks. There is a high level of local endemism, particularly on the more isolated peaks. Part of the Cordillera Central p\u00e1ramo has been identified as a hotspot, a threatened area with a high level of endemism. Other hotspots in Peru include the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n dry forests, central Peruvian Yungas and central Andean puna. ===Flora=== Vegetation includes tussock grasses and cushion plants, shrubs and sedges, often with an under-layer of lichens and moss. The lower levels of p\u00e1ramo merge into dwarf transitional forest and montane cloud forest. The characteristic vegetation consists of plants of the genera Calamagrostis, Agrostis and Hypericum, There are also shrubs of genera such as Polylepis and Escallonia. The isolated position of the p\u00e1ramos has resulted in high levels of endemism among the diverse plant species. There are 300 genera of spermatophytes with 1,000\u20131,500 species, of which about 60% are endemic. Notable species of flora include Cinchona officinalis and Schmardaea microphylla. ===Fauna=== Pudu, the smallest deer in the world, found up to 4,000 metres The fauna of the plateau include species that originated from the Amazon basin, from the tropical Andes and from the northern desert areas. Mammals include mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), little red brocket (Mazama rufina), spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), northern pud\u00fa (Pudu mephistophiles) and small-eared shrews (genus Cryptotis). The mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) is endangered. The ecoregion has three endemic bird species. Endangered birds include the bearded guan (Penelope barbata) and red- faced parrot (Hapalopsittaca pyrrhops). The rufous-breasted warbling finch (Poospiza rubecula) is also endangered. Other fauna include the Huancabamba whorltail lizard (Stenocercus huancabambae), the frogs Astrotheca galeata, Gastrotheca lateonata, Lynchius parkeri, Gastrotheca nebulanastes and genus Eleutherodactylus and butterflies of the genera Dismorphia, Pagyris and Veladyris. Endangered amphibians include Atelopus peruensis, Hyloxalus elachyhistus, Lynchius parkeri, Pristimantis simonsii, Telmatobius brevipes, Telmatobius degener and Telmatobius thompsoni. ==Status== The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status \"Relatively Stable/Intact\". The ecoregion has been used by humans for many years, with many settlements and highways crossing the plateau, but is still fairly intact, A recent expansion of the human population and increase in agriculture is destroying the habitat around settlements. Overgrazing by livestock is causing erosion of the soil. Mining waste sometimes contaminates the rivers. Protected areas include the Podocarpus National Park. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:Neotropic ecoregions Category:Ecoregions of Peru Category:Ecoregions of Ecuador Category:P\u00e1ramos ",
