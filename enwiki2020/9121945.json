The movie is a remake of the 2001 film Saving Silverman. It is directed by Eeshwar Nivas and produced by Ravi Walia. The film revolves around three childhood friends Abhi (Aftab Shivdasani), Amu (Ayesha Takia) and Paglu (Ritesh Deshmukh) who have grown together and when Karthika (Rimi Sen) comes in their life, the whole dynamics of their friendship changes. The film was initially titled Jalsa. De Taali was released on 20 June 2008. ==Plot== Abhishek 'Abhi' (Aftab Shivdasani), Paglu (Ritesh Deshmukh) and Amrita 'Amu' (Ayesha Takia) are best friends since their childhood. Abhi's father (Anupam Kher) is a very rich businessman, and his only son has no interest in work. Abhi has had many girlfriends, but none of them lasted long. Paglu and Abhi's father tells Amu to marry Abhi because they know each other very well. One day Abhi comes and tells Amu that he loves someone that is his childhood friend; Amu thinks that she is the girl whom Abhi loves and she, too, falls in love with him. Abhi later reveals that Kartika (Rimi Sen) is whom he loves. Karthika is actually after his money. Amu is heartbroken. Amu and Paglu start hating her and try to get them separated. Abhi gets angry with them and decides to marry her in another country. At the airport Amu hits Kartika and she falls unconscious. Amu and Paglu kidnap Kartika and force her to write a letter to Abhi saying that she doesn't love him. Paglu tells Abhi that Amu is the right girl for her, and Abhi falls in love with her. Paglu, with Karthika, still kidnapped, finds out that her name is Anjali, not Karthika. She is not in love with Abhi but with his money, and she has a history of cheating people for money. Paglu then frees her and she tells Abhi about the kidnapping. Abhi is unhappy hearing this and decides to marry Karthika anyway. On the wedding day, Paglu tries to stop them from getting them married by bringing all the people she cheated; Abhi gets angry and tells Paglu and Amu to get out. The next day, Abhi comes back, apologizes to them and says that he isn't married. He tells them that yesterday when they left Anjali told him that she has learned a lot from the time Paglu and Amu kept her in captivity. She apologizes that she can't marry him and that Amu is the right girl for him. Abhi proposes to Amu. Later, Paglu ends up with the changed Anjali. == Cast == * Ritesh Deshmukh as Paresh \u201cPaglu\u201d Gurudev * Aftab Shivdasani as Abhishek \u201cAbhi\u201d Aggarwal * Ayesha Takia as Amrita \u201cAmu\u201d * Rimi Sen as Anjali / Karthika Rai * Anupam Kher as Mr. Agarwal, Abhishek\u2019s father *Mukul Dev as Sunil *Pavan Malhotra as Professor Mhatre *Rasika Joshi as Mrs. Moolchand Nahata *Sanjay Narvekar as Venkat *Saurabh Shukla as Landord Godbole *Neha Dhupia as Sara (Special Appearance) *Anjana Sukhani as Anita (Special Appearance) ==Music== The music was conducted by the duo Vishal-Shekhar. ===Track listing=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" ! # !!
