    "text": "The M-K TE70-4S was a four-axle B-B diesel-electric locomotive built by Morrison-Knudsen. The locomotive was a rebuild of the GE U25B with a Sulzer V-12 prime mover installed. Morrison-Knudsen rebuilt four for the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1978. The experiment proved unsuccessful and no additional units were rebuilt. == Design == The prime mover for the M-K TE70-4S was a Sulzer 12ASV 25/30. Normally found in marine or stationary uses, the 12ASV 25/30 had been in production since 1969. The four-stroke turbocharged engine was rated for a maximum of at 1000 RPM. The locomotives retained the GE GT598 D3A generators and GE 752 traction motors from the U25B. The capability of the prime mover notwithstanding, the locomotive was rated at . The new prime mover required substantial alterations to the cab, carbody, and underframe. The locomotive measured long by wide, and stood high. It weighed . == History == Southern Pacific sent four GE U25Bs ( 7030\u20137033), then at the end of their service life, to Morrison-Knudsen for rebuilding. Morrison-Knudsen rebuilt the four locomotives in its Boise, Idaho, shops in 1977\u20131978. The first revenue run occurred beginning March 1, 1978, when the four locomotives handled a Seattle\u2013Los Angeles trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) train between Portland and Los Angeles. Inauspiciously, one of the four locomotives broke down during the trip. The locomotives carried a unique paint scheme featuring the red-and- orange of the SP's famed \"Daylight\" passenger trains, albeit in a different style. The color scheme led to the nickname \"Popsicle\"; unreliability led to their retirement in 1987. == Notes == == References == * * * * * * == Further reading == * * == External links == * Southern Pacific TE70-4S on My Espee Modelers Archive TE70-4S Category:B-B locomotives Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1978 Category:Freight locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ",
