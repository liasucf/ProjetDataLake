    "text": "Anjaane: The Unknown is a 2005 Bollywood horror film. The main cast is Manisha Koirala, Sanjay Kapoor, Tejaswini Kolhapure, Helen, Tanwi Gouri Mehta, and Anand Mehta. The film was directed by Harry W. Fernandes and is based on Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's ghost story film The Others. ==Synopsis== This film is the third release of Holland-based Anil K. Mehta. The chief protagonists are Shivani (Manisha Koirala) and Aditya (Sanjay Kapoor), a married couple with 2 children, Tanwi Gouri Mehta and Anand Mehta. They are wealthy and live in a mansion. Their idyllic life is shattered with the arrival of Sonia, who has an affair with Aditya. Eventually, Aditya leaves his family for Sonia, leaving the wife and two kids alone. When it is found out that Sonia is barren, Aditya demands custody of his children from Shivani and approaches the courts for a custody battle. Eventually, the courts rule against Shivani and award custody to Aditya and Sonia. The movie changes its ambiance from the family dispute to one of suspense and horror shortly after. ==Reviews== The film was not well received. It was criticized for being a \"copycat\" of the Spanish film The Others, and the acting of Koirala was described by reviewers as \"uninterested\" and \"mechanical\". The direction under Fernandes was \"devoid of passion\", although the cinematography was praised. ==Music== #\"Kis Kadar Chahate Hai Ham Tumko Sanam\" - Alka Yagnik, Jayesh Gandhi #\"De Do Re De Do\" - Jayesh Gandhi, Sunidhi Chauhan #\"O Maahive Re O Maahive\" - Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan #\"O Soni Re O Sayyoni Re\" - K.
