Harding was born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, and received his B.S. from Bridgewater State College in 1939, M.A. from the University of North Carolina in 1947 and a Ph. D. from Rutgers University in 1950. ==Career== Harding spent most of his career at SUNY Geneseo, where he arrived in 1956, although he previously taught at the University of Virginia, Rutgers University, and the University of North Carolina. He served as the chair of Geneseo's English Department for six years and was awarded several of SUNY's highest honors. He became a University Professor in 1966 and Distinguished Professor in 1973. In 1983, one year after his retirement, he became the first SUNY faculty member to be granted an honorary doctorate from SUNY itself.Second Annual Walter Harding Lecture Highlights Thoreau and Emerson Experts, August 24, 2005, http://www.geneseo.edu/news/nrap.php?pg=HardingLecture.html ==Scholarship== Harding authored more than twenty-five books and many articles on Thoreau and his circle. Harding's biography of Thoreau, The Days of Henry David Thoreau, is considered a definitive study of Thoreau's life. Harding also edited an edition of Thoreau's Walden that restores Thoreau's sketches to the text and includes copious footnotes.Harding's publications at Amazon.com, https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author- exact;=Walter%20Harding&rank;=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/103-0377273-1996615 Harding helped to found the Thoreau Society, serving as the society's first secretary. He also served as president of the group. During his career Harding amassed the largest and most comprehensive research collection of Thoreauviana. The extensive collection of more than 15,000 books, pamphlets, articles and other Thoreau memorabilia was donated to the Thoreau Society and is housed at the Walden Woods Project's Thoreau Institute Library in Lincoln, Massachusetts. The Milne Library at SUNY Geneseo also has copies of some items in the Harding collection.The Walter Harding Collection in the Thoreau Society Collections at the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Library_Collections/Harding ==Legacy== In addition to the research collection that bears his name, Harding's impact on Thoreau scholarship and SUNY Geneseo is registered in several ways. Harding's wife, Marjorie Brook Harding, endowed an annual lecture at SUNY Geneseo that bears his name. Each fall, the Walter Harding Lecture brings a distinguished scholar of American literature related to Thoreau and his circle of transcendentalists to the campus. In 2009, Mrs. Harding increased the annual lecture's endowment.http://www.geneseo.edu/news/nrap.php?pg=HardingGift2009.html Geneseo's English Department holds meetings, special events, and lectures in the Walter Harding Room of Welles Hall, and the department annually awards the Walter Harding American Studies Award to a graduating senior in the American studies program.
