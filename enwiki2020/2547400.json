    "text": "The Hues Corporation was an American pop and soul trio, formed in Santa Monica, California in 1969. They are best known for their 1974 single \"Rock the Boat\", which sold over 2 million copies. ==Group name and background== Before achieving mainstream success they were the opening act for a list of headliners that included Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle, Nancy Sinatra, and Glen Campbell. The original band had a lineup of three singers and three sidemen. The sidemen were Joey Rivera from the Checkmates; Monti Lawston; and Bob \"Bullet\" Bailey, formerly of the Leaves. Bailey, Rivera, and Lawston left the band to form Goodstuff. The group's name was a pun on the Howard Hughes Corporation, with the 'hue' (a synonym of 'color'). The band's members at the time of their first album were St. Clair Lee (born Bernard St. Clair Lee, April 24, 1944, San Francisco, California; died March 8, 2011), Fleming Williams (born December 26, 1943, Flint, Michigan; died February 15, 1998) and Hubert Ann Kelley (born April 24, 1947, Fairfield, Alabama).More Hues Corporation info The original choice for the group's name was The Children of Howard Hughes, which their record label turned down. ==Career== The group was formed in 1969.Rhythm and Blues, Rap, and Hip-hop by Frank Hoffmann Page 127 Hues Corporation Songwriter Wally Holmes founded the group with his friend Bernard St. Clair Lee.

Retrieved 12 Juli 2018., the group's first big break came in 1972, when they were invited to appear in the blaxploitation film, Blacula, starring William Marshall. They were also asked to record three songs for the film's soundtrack: \"There He Is Again\", \"What The World Knows,\" and \"I'm Gonna Catch You.\" After their participation in the Blacula-project Karl Russell was replaced by Fleming Williams and the group signed with RCA Records; their second single for the label, \"Freedom For The Stallion\", from the album of the same name, became a moderate hit, reaching #63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The third single from the album, \"Rock the Boat,\" became a #1 hit on the Billboard chart and the group's signature song. The bass player on the session for \"Rock the Boat\" was Wilton Felder, not James Jamerson as previously reported. \"Rock the Boat\" was written by Holmes, who also wrote the Blacula songs, and was released in the U.S. in February 1974 and in the UK in July of that year. It went to #1 for one week in the U.S. and #6 for two weeks in the UK, staying for 18 weeks in the U.S. chart with a gold disc awarded by the RIAA on 24 June 1974. The track sold well over two million copies. The song is considered one of the earliest disco songs. Some authorities proclaim it to be the first disco song to hit #1, while others give that distinction to \"Love's Theme\" by the Love Unlimited Orchestra, a chart-topper from earlier in 1974. After the success of \"Rock the Boat,\" the Hues Corporation's other charted singles on the Billboard Hot 100 included \"Rockin' Soul\" (1974, #18), \"Love Corporation\" (1975, #62), and \"I Caught Your Act\" (1977, #92). The group was unable to duplicate the success of their earlier hits and disbanded sometime around 1980.
