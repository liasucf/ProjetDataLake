    "text": "Crumb is an American indie rock band, founded in Boston. The group is a collaboration of Brooklyn-based musicians Lila Ramani (guitar, vocals), Jesse Brotter (bass, backing vocals), Brian Aronow (synthesizers, keyboard, saxophone), and Jonathan Gilad (drums), who met while attending Tufts University. == History == Ramani, Brotter, Aronow, and Gilad, met at Tufts University and, prior to the formation of Crumb, had collaborated on Boston- based projects, including Bad and Blue, JG and The Funky Bunch, and The American Symphony of Soul. In 2016 they came together to develop and record a collection of songs Ramani had started writing in high school and college, ultimately resulting in the band\u2019s first two EPs, Crumb (2016) and Locket (2017). Both EPs were independently released, with physical cassettes released by DIY label Citrus City Records. Crumb went on to release their debut full- length album, Jinx, on June 14, 2019. The album received positive reviews from music critics. == Music style == Indie Current described Crumb's sound on 'Locket' as psychedelic slacker-rock. Paste Magazine called their sound a meld of \"60s psych, loose jazz, and freeform indie rock into a soothing pop amalgamation.\" Their sound has been compared to Melody's Echo Chamber, BadBadNotGood, Quilt, Tame Impala, and Broadcast. == Discography == Crumb released a self-titled EP in 2016. In an interview with Sound of Boston, Ramani explains that the EP was a response to a music teacher's comments about playing the guitar: \u201cWhen I was 14, one of my music teachers told me to stop playing guitar like \u2018a girl,\u2019 so I would consider this EP to be a response to that teacher \u2013 me shredding guitar like a girl for all my ladies.\" In 2019, the band released \"Jinx,\" their first full-length album. Pitchfork.com gave the album a 7.8/10 rating, describing it as a \"buzz of stoic anxiety.\" == References == Category:Musical groups from Boston ",
