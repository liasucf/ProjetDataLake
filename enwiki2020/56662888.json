    "text": "The Bombardier Omneo is a family of electric multiple units (EMU) developed and built by Bombardier Transportation. The Omneo was developed in response to a request by French rail operator SNCF for a new EMU to serve its growing regional routes. It was first ordered by SNCF in February 2010; since then, multiple follow-on orders have been received. Testing of the first trainset commencing during early 2012, and had largely been completed by September 2013, the month in which the first example was handed over to SNCF. In SNCF service, it is branded Regio 2N and classed as Z 55500 or Z 56500, depending on configuration. ==History== The Omneo had been designed by Bombardier's facility at Crespin in response to a request issued by SNCF, which had sought to equip itself with a new generation of regional EMUs. Between 2002 and 2009, SNCF had experienced a 40% increase in passengers on its TER regional services, averaging around 800 000 passengers per day, and further growth in demand had been forecast over the following decades; the procurement of new trainsets was financed primarily by various regional authorities rather than SNCF itself. Following the receipt of several bids, during November 2009, an SNCF spokesperson stated that Bombardier was the preferred bidder at that stage. On 24 February 2010, Bombardier announced that it had been awarded a firm order for 80 trainsets. The contract, which included additional options for up to 860 total trainsets worth a total of \u20ac8 billion, called for deliveries of the initial batch to occur between June 2013 and December 2015. In February 2012, static testing of an early trainset commenced; by September of that year, testing had proceeded to the trial running phase, which was conducted at the Velim railway test circuit. Between September 2012 and September 2013, the test fleet of nine pre-series trainsets accumulated 100,000km of single-unit operations and 20,000km of multiple-unit operations. In September 2013, a ceremony was held at the Crespin manufacturing plant, where Bombardier build the Omneo, at which the first trainset was delivered to SNCF; it was attended by company president Guillaume Pepy and various representatives of the regions that had funded the order--by that time expanded to 129 trainsets--ahead of delivery and testing across SNCF's own network. At the time, Bombardier stated that the test programme was 90% completed, the remainder largely focusing upon electromagnetic compatibility, air conditioning, and general multiple-unit operations; production was also ramping up from one trainset per month to three per month by January 2014. In January 2014, SNCF exercised its option to procure a further 30 trainsets; these were followed by eight more Omneos during October 2015. In February 2016, four additional trainsets were opted for, resulting in a total of 213 trainsets being on order at this point. In November 2016, SNCF ordered 40 trainsets in the Premium configuration, this batch being the first to be equipped as such, featuring improved onboard amenities and a higher top speed; by August 2018, dynamic testing of the first Omneo Premium trainset was underway. By February 2018, a total of 382 trainsets had been ordered. In November 2018, 19 Premium trainsets were ordered for service from Paris to Hauts-de-France points. The Omneo is set to replace various older trainsets, including the Z2N, V2N, Vo-VR2N, RRR-Rio and Corail trains for both regional and intercity services across the French Regions. ==Design== The Bombardier Omneo is a double-deck electric multiple units (EMU). It features a modular design approach, allowing the trainset to be readily adapted for suburban, regional and intercity traffic. According to Bombardier, it is the world's first double-deck EMU to be articulated. Each trainset comprises both single level and double level cars; propulsion equipment, such as the braking resistors and electrical transformers, are installed on the roofs of the single level cars; the double level cars are dedicated to passenger seating alone. The Omneo typically comprises between six and ten individual cars in each trainset, giving a total length of between and and a width of and for twin and single level cars respectively. Dependent upon both length and seating configuration, a trainset can have a maximum passenger capacity of up to 1,380 people, being able to seat 780 of these. Individual cars of a trainset can be exchanged to change the ratio of double-deck to single-deck cars as to better suit a particular service. The interior configuration is reconfigurable, allowing it to be adapted to suit the trainset's intended use and customer specifications. It has been anticipated that a common intercity configuration would feature a 2+1 seating configuration, dedicated luggage spaces, increased toilet capacity, greater seat pitch, individual reading lights and electric sockets, and footrests for greater comfort. The double level cars lack doors, as well as several common conveniences such as toilets and spaces for bicycles and wheelchairs, these can only be found within the single level cars. For passenger safety, an onboard CCTV system is also installed through the cars. The gangways between cars are also double level as to maximise passenger's accessibility and movement; the cars are wider than those of most conventional trains. The Premium variant of the Omneo features various improvements in passenger amenities over the Base model, these include spacious reclining seats with individual armrests, wider doors and a more luxurious interior. Omneo trainsets can be specified with a or a top speed, these being available as the Base and Premium configurations respectively. SNCF classifies the base version as Z 55500 and the Premium as Z 56500. Omneo trainsets have a base power output of with three powered bogies; the customer can specify a fourth powered bogie for an output of . The trainsets are powered by 1.5 kV or 25 kV AC catenary. The trainsets are composed of relatively lightweight materials, which minimises axle loads; the Omneo is claimed by Bombardier to be 95% recyclable. It was designed to minimise both noise and vibration levels. The Omneo incorporates Bombardier's ECO4 technologies, comprising the four cornerstones of energy, efficiency, economy and ecology; examples include a permanent magnet motor (PMM), a thermo- efficient climate control system, aero-efficient exterior shaping, and an energy management control system, which reportedly reduce both energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Due to its high level of French-sourced content, the Omneo has received a Guaranteed French Origin label, the first to be granted within the rail industry. ==Distribution of Orders== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; |+ Distribution of orders and deliveries |- ! scope=col | R\u00e9gions (before merger) ! scope=col | R\u00e9gions (after merger) ! scope=col | Ordered ! scope=col | Delivery ! scope=col | Series ! scope=col | Length ! scope=col | Number of Cars |- |Aquitaine||New Aquitaine||40||40||Z 56300||Short (S)||6 |- |Brittany||\u2013||7||7||Z 55500||Short (S)||6 |- |Brittany||\u2013||14||14||Z 55500||Long (L)||8 |- |Center-Loire Valley||\u2013||14||14||Z 55500||Long (L)||8 |- |Center-Loire Valley||-||2||2||Z 56500||Long (L)||8 |- |Center-Loire Valley||-||32||1||Z 56700||Long (L)||8 |- |Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es||Occitanie||18||12||Z 56300||Short (S)||6 |- |Nord-Pas-de- Calais||Hauts-de-France||18||18||Z 55500||Medium (M)||7 |- |Pays de la Loire||\u2013||11||11||Z 56500||Long (L)||8 |- |Picardie||Hauts-de-France||7||7||Z 55500||Extra-Long (XL)||10 |- | - ||Hauts-de-France||19||0||-||Extra-Long (XL)||10 |- |Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur||\u2013||16||16||Z 55500||Long (L)||8 |- |Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes||Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes||40||40||Z 55500||Short (S)||6 |- |Rh\u00f4ne- Alpes||Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes||19||0||Z 55500||Long (L)||8 |- |Intercit\u00e9s Normandy||Normandy||40||6||Z 56600||Extra-Long (XL)||10 |- |Intercit\u00e9s Normandy||Normandy||27||0||-||Extra-Long (XL)||10 |- |Ile-de- France||\u2013||73||5||Z 57000||Long (L)||8 |- |Ile-de-France||\u2013||42||42||Z 57000||Long (L)||8 |- |Ile-de-France||\u2013||19||19||Z 57000||Long (L)||8 |- |Total||||447||249 |} ==Operators and Routes== Regio 2N in TER Center-Loire Valley livery on a train from Paris to Le Mans.
