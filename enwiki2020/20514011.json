He took 13 hours on the southbound journey, 11 hours going north.Cycling Weekly, UK, 18 January 1990 He said: Of his ride against Mockridge, he said: By three-quarter distance, Mockridge was struggling so badly that he gave up when he was 50 yards behind. As well as the gold medal, Cartwright received a certificate for the fastest time ridden in New Zealand. Cartwright remembered: \"As we boarded his ship [for the journey home], the captain didn't say 'Congratulations, nice work.' His words were: 'I've locked those rollers of yours in the hold for the voyage home. You were nothing but a nuisance on the way here but we don't want to have to put up with it on the way back.\". He stopped racing after not being selected for the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952.Cycling Weekly, 23 January 1993 == References == Category:English male cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 1950 British Empire Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for England Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for England Category:People from Dukinfield Category:1924 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in cycling ",
