He didn't feature competitively for the club, though was an unused substitute for a Primera Divisi\u00f3n fixture against Racing Club on 8 February 2014. In the succeeding June, Bellone moved to Torneo Federal A's Juventud Antoniana. His senior bow arrived on 29 August versus Central C\u00f3rdoba. His first goal came in 2015 during a draw with Altos Hornos Zapla. Bellone joined Gimnasia y Tiro the following year, but missed the 2016 campaign after suffering a serious kidney injury, which put him into intensive care and threatened his career, on his Copa Argentina bow on 31 January. A return to Juventud Antoniana for Bellone was confirmed on 21 July 2017, though he was on the move once again eleven months later after agreeing terms with Villa D\u00e1lmine of Primera B Nacional on 18 June 2018. His first appearance was in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Independiente Rivadavia on 7 October. ==Personal life== Bellone is the brother of professional footballer Mauro Bellone, while Lucas Acosta is his brother-in-law. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Col\u00f3n |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Juventud Antoniana |2014 |rowspan=\"2\"|Torneo Federal A |12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2Appearance(s) in the Torneo Federal A play- offs||0||14||0 |- |2015 |26||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0||29||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !38!!1!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!5!!0!!43!!1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Gimnasia y Tiro |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|Torneo Federal A |0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2016\u201317 |18||1||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||21||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !18!!1!!2!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!2!!0!!22!!2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Juventud Antoniana |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Federal A |23||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||25||2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Villa D\u00e1lmine |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !80!!4!!4!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!7!!0!!91!!5 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from San Crist\u00f3bal Department Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Torneo Federal A players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Col\u00f3n footballers Category:Juventud Antoniana footballers Category:Gimnasia y Tiro footballers Category:Villa D\u00e1lmine footballers Category:Crucero del Norte footballers ",
