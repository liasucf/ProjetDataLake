He is most associated with the reconstruction of Trondheim, Norway after the great fire of 1681.Cicignon, Johan Casper, - 1696 (Dansk biografisk Lexikon0 ==Biography== Section of Cicigon's city plan for Trondheim, after the great fire of 1681 Johan Caspar von Cicignon was born in Oberwampach, a village in the commune of Wincrange, in northern Luxembourg. He was the son of Georg Friedrich de Cicignon til Mechern og Oberwampach and Marie de Lachen dite Wampach. Dating from 1657, he was in the Venetian military service. In 1662 he entered the Danish-Norwegian service and rose to the position of Major General. He became commandant at the Bergenhus Fortress in early 1664. As such he was involved in the Battle of V\u00e5gen in 1665, when an English flotilla attacked a Dutch treasure fleet sheltering in the bay of Bergen.Johan Caspar De Cicignon \u2013 utdypning (Store norske leksikon) During the Scanian War from 1675\u20131679, he served first in Mecklenburg, where he distinguished himself at the siege of Wismar in 1675. Cicignon was commander in Fredrikstad and engaged in the Battle of R\u00fcgen in autumn 1677. A fire in Trondheim on 19 April 1681 (Hornemansbrannen) led to an almost total reconstruction of the city. Johan Caspar von Cicignon laid out plans for the reconstruction of Trondheim and fortifications. Kristiansten Fortress was built after his plans. Cicignon's baroque style is still used as a guideline in much of Trondheim's city centre and in later years there have been quite the debate over whether or not the plan's intentions are being stretched by entrepreneurs trying to profit from infringing the plan's strict building boundaries.Johan Caspar de Cicignon (Gamle murhus i Fredrikstad)Johan Caspar Cicignon (1625*-1696) (300 \u00e5r med Cicignon.

Cicignon made the plans for the construction of Kristiansten Fortress in Trondheim in 1681-1685. It was built after the city fire of Trondheim in 1681 to protect the city against attack from the east. Construction was finished in 1685. It fulfilled its purpose in 1718 when Swedish forces laid siege against Trondheim. The fortress was decommissioned in 1816 by king Charles XIV John. ==References== Category:Luxembourgian soldiers Category:Danish generals Category:Norwegian Army generals Category:1620s births Category:1696 deaths Category:People from Wincrange Category:Knights of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:Date of birth unknown ",
