    "text": "Denny Flynn (born April 21, 1951) is a bullrider from Charleston, Arkansas, who was inducted in the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in 2017. ==History== In 1969, Flynn won the Arkansas High School All-Around Rode title. He earned his Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association card in 1973. In 1979, in Palestine, Illinois, Flynn rode Steiner's Red Lightning to a score of 98 out of 100. This broke the previous record for roughstock competition, and now is the second highest ever recorded in pro rodeo history at a roughstock event. In Salt Lake City in 1975, Flynn was gored by a bull. The horn penetrated ten inches into his body, missing his heart by a half-inch. Flynn rode to the hospital in a truck holding his intestines in his hands. He qualified for the National Finals Rodeo ten times, winning three. In 1981 he suffered a concussion on his sixth ride, but managed to ride 9 of 10 bulls to win the championship. In 1983, he broke his ankle on his ninth bull ride. He needed to ride a tenth bull to win, so he rode it with a broken ankle. He was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in 2017. In 2019 he was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. Flynn was inducted into the Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends Ring of Honor in 2002, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame and the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2010. He retired at the age of 34 in 1985. When Red Lightning retired in 1987, Flynn rode one more ceremonial ride on the bull that almost killed him in Salt Lake City. ==References== Category:ProRodeo Hall of Fame inductees Category:Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends Category:Bull riders Category:Sportspeople from Arkansas ",
