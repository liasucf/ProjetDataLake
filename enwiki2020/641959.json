On May 15, 1999, Dick drove his car into a utility pole in Hollywood. He was charged with the possession of cocaine, cannabis, and drug paraphernalia, driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs, and hit-and-run driving. He later pleaded guilty to the felony of cocaine possession and two other misdemeanor charges: cannabis possession and possession of a \"smoking device\". After Dick completed an 18-month drug diversion program, a judge dismissed the felony and misdemeanor drug charges against him. On December 4, 2004, Dick was arrested for indecent exposure after he exposed his buttocks at a local McDonald's. On July 16, 2008, Dick was arrested in Murrieta, California, on suspicion of drug possession and sexual battery.

Dick pleaded not guilty during a formal arraignment in Cabell County Circuit Court in Huntington on July 29, 2011. After receiving the not guilty plea, Judge Paul Ferrell set a trial date of January 17, 2012. After several delays, on May 21, 2012, Dick was given a six- month pre-trial diversion. An assistant prosecutor said that the agreement stated that if Dick would stay out of legal trouble for six months, the criminal charges would be dismissed. In January 2012, the two alleged victims filed a civil suit against Dick for unspecified damages. In March 2018, Lena Sved obtained a restraining order against Dick requiring him to stay at least 100 yards from Sved and the couple's children, Jacob and Meg, the order remaining in effect until March 13, 2023.

In December 2006, Dick upset an audience at The Improv in Los Angeles by shouting \"You're all a bunch of niggers!\" following an improvised set with comedian Ian Bagg. This was a direct reference to Michael Richards' use of the same epithet to insult hecklers two weeks earlier.(2006). \"Andy Dick apologizes for racial slur\", USA Today. Retrieved December 6, 2006. He later issued an apology via his publicist: In February 2007, Dick was forcibly removed from the stage during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, after repeatedly touching guest Ivanka Trump. Jimmy Kimmel called in his security guards, Uncle Frank and Veatrice Rice, who assisted as Kimmel dragged Dick off by his legs. Kimmel later said \"Andy did a segment, he was a little out of it. [When Ivanka] came out, he wanted a big, wet kiss. It was time for Andy to go, so I escorted him out by his feet.\" Kimmel added, \"He always makes me a little uncomfortable, you have no idea what he's going to do next.\" Kimmel also said he had spoken to Dick afterwards and that Dick was not upset about the incident. In October 2010, Dick was seen exposing himself and making a commotion at Caf\u00e9 Audrey in Hollywood.

The organizers claimed that this caused thousands of dollars of damage and considered suing Dick over the incident. In August 2011, Dick was a guest on Greg Fitzsimmons' radio show and made antisemitic statements about Howard Stern. Dick said Stern was a \"money- grubbing Jew\" and repeatedly called him a \"hook-nosed Jew\". Dick later stated he had written an apology letter to Stern. In October 2017, Dick was fired from a role in the independent film Raising Buchanan due to allegations of inappropriate behavior which, according to The Hollywood Reporter, \"included groping people's genitals, unwanted kissing/licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production\". While he denied most of the allegations, he said \"I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. That's my thing \u2013 I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. It's me being funny.\" It would later be revealed that in the same month he had also been fired and escorted off the set from another film, Vampire Dad, due to what was referred to as \"multiple, flagrant acts of improper conduct and inappropriate contact with several crew members\". He later said \"I overtook my medication and took too many Xanax and I was a bit loopy\". He said \"I won't do it anymore. I won't lick anyone's face anymore. We have an agreement.\" === Feud with Jon Lovitz === Dick has had an ongoing dispute with former NewsRadio costar Jon Lovitz concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartman's wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartman's house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, fell back into drug use, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of NewsRadio as Hartman's replacement, he and Dick got into an argument in which Lovitz reportedly said \"I wouldn't be here if you hadn't given Brynn coke in the first place.\" Lovitz reportedly later apologized to Dick for the remark. In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said \"I put the Phil Hartman hex on you\u2014you're the next to die.\" On July 10, 2007, Lovitz got into a physical confrontation with Dick at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartman's death. Lovitz then smashed Dick's head into the bar. == Discography == === Albums === * Andy Dick & The Bitches of the Century (2002) * Do Your Shows Always Suck?
