March 1922 E G Wrigley & Co Limited was a British tool maker, car component, and mechanical parts manufacturer, located at Foundry Lane, Soho, Birmingham active from 1897 to 1923. ==Foundation== Edward Greenwood Wrigley established a tool making business at 232 Aston Road, Birmingham in 1898. He expanded in 1902 by moving some operations to Foundry Lane, Soho, Birmingham. They manufactured high- speed twist drills and made a specialty of milling cutters, taper and adjustable reamers and gear cutters.The Olympia Show, The Commercial Motor, 22 November 1906, page 13 ===Small tools and Gears=== In addition to the small tools mentioned Wrigley's made gears of many types for all mechanisms but the engine and they assembled gears into boxes making a number of products. Their reputation for high quality was excellent though Dr Lanchester went on record as saying the one use for a Wrigley Worm was for fishing. ===Transmission sets=== A range of three speed gearboxes and worm-driven back axles with propellor shaft and torque mechanism and transmission brakes and front axles with steering gear. In 1906 Wrigley's showed a complete car gearbox at that year's Olympia Show and were manufacturing front and live-rear axles. ==Developments== In 1912 at the opening of a new building at Soho Foundry Lane core activities were: * Manufacture of twist drills, cutters and small tools of all kinds * the machining of toothed gearing * assembly of gearboxes and other complete units Other special tools made in large numbers were: hobs, metal-splitting saws and all kinds of special cutters and gauges. At that time it was reported there were now eighteen draughtsmen, 47 staff and 280 men in the workshops.The Birthplace of the Wrigley Worm, The Commercial Motor, 7 March 1912, page 12 After the war, due to ill health, Wrigley handed over the running of his business to F G Woollard. Wrigley died in January 1941. ===Cars=== Wrigley cars were only made during 1913. In 1913 they began experimenting with a cyclecar with a two-cylinder, air- or water-cooled engine and two-speed gearbox. Very few were built before the business was involved in war work, including making aircraft parts.L P Jarman and R I Barraclough, The Bullnose and Flatnose Morris, David & Charles, Newton Abbott, UK 1976 ==Morris Commercial Cars== Wrigley's continued building, among other products, engines and gearboxes. At the end of 1923 it was placed in receivership following the failure of principal customer (undercut by Morris), Angus-Sanderson for whom they had geared up for large-scale production. On 1 January 1924 William Morris bought from the receiver the complete assets, including the buildings, and on 4 February of that year, the former Wrigley business, now incorporated as Morris Commercial Cars Limited, began the manufacture of light commercial vehicles with a 1-ton truck. By 1930 trucks of from 10 cwt up to 5 tons capacity were being made and Dictator and Imperial single and double-decker buses. ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== Category:Defunct companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Manufacturing companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:Automotive companies of the United Kingdom Category:Cyclecars Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:British companies established in 1898 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1898 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1924 Category:1898 establishments in England Category:1924 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1924 ",
