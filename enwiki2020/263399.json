Clopyralid is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes aminopyralid, picloram, triclopyr, and several less common herbicides.Staff, Virginia Tech Cooperative Extension. Revised May 14, 2012 Pyridine Herbicide Carryover: Causes and Precautions Accessed May 27, 2013Bob Hartzler, extension weed management specialist, Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University. February 21, 2006 Aminopyralid - New herbicide for pastures, roadsides, etc. Accessed May 27, 2013 For control of creeping thistle, Cirsium arvense, a noxious, perennial weed, clopyralid is one of the few effective herbicides available. It is particularly damaging to peas, tomatoes and sunflowers and can render potatoes, lettuce and spinach inedible. It does not affect grasses of the family Poaceae. Clopyralid is known for its ability to persist in dead plants and compost, and has accumulated to phytotoxic levels in finished compost in a few highly publicized cases. This first came to light in Washington, when during 2000 and 2001, residues of clopyralid were detected in commercial compost, and compost made at a municipal site damaged tomatoes and other garden plants planted in it. Word quickly spread to other local and state governments, and in 2002, DowAgro, the manufacturer of clopyralid, voluntarily deregistered it for use on domestic lawns in the USDavid E. Haskell , California Department of Pesticide Regulation Clopyralid in Compost 2003 Proceedings of the California Weed Science Society 55:163-166 and it is banned in several US states but it is found in consumer products in Europe such as Scotts Verdone Extra and Vitax Lawn Clear 2. Clopyralid is licensed for lawn use in France and under these names: Bayer Jardin: D\u00e9sherbant jeune gazon and Scanner S\u00e9lectif gazon Vilmorin: d\u00e9sherbant Gazon LONPAR.
