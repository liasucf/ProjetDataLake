It serves Baton Rouge and other cities in the parish. ==History== The East Baton Rouge Public Library was established in 1939 with the donation of second-hand collected books from the city. Quick to expand, the library had eight branches within its first three years as a system. Since 1986 the library has been funded by a 10-year dedicated property tax. This tax, funded at $11.1 million, provides funding for all library operations, improvements, and salaries. While the tax was lowered to $10.78 million in the early 2000s it was raised back to $11.1 million in 2015. Its most recent renewal was on October 24, 2015. ==Libraries== *Main Library *Baker Branch Library - Baker *Bluebonnet Regional Branch Library *Carver Branch Library *Central Branch Library - Central *Delmont Gardens Branch Library *Eden Park Branch Library *Fairwood Branch Library *Greenwell Springs Regional Branch - Monticello (unincorporated area) *Jones Creek Regional Branch Library - Shenandoah (unincorporated area) *Pride-Chaneyville Branch Library - Pride (unincorporated area) *River Center Branch Library *Scotlandville Branch Library *Zachary Branch Library - Zachary ==References== ==External links== * East Baton Rouge Parish Library Library Category:Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:Public libraries in Louisiana ",
