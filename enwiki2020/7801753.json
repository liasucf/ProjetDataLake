The Ch\u00e2teau de Tanlay at Tanlay (Yonne) is a French ch\u00e2teau built in Burgundy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, famous for its beauty and the setting. The walls are of limestone under tall sloping slate roofs \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, surrounding three sides of a central court with cylindrical towers at its four corners. The ch\u00e2teau is entirely encircled by its rectilinear moat and approached on axis across a bridge marked by paired obelisks through a gatehouse (illustration) built in 1558, which straddles the low balustrade and projects forward into the moat. The perfect symmetry of the cour d'honneur is part of Tanlay's serene charm. Frescoes in the Tour de la Ligue The foundations are in part those of the thirteenth-century ch\u00e2teau-fort. The rebuilding in Renaissance style is owing to the brother of the Admiral de Coligny, Fran\u00e7ois de Coligny d'Andelot (1521\u20131569), who inherited the site in ruinous condition in 1547 and whose construction campaigns of 1555-1568 during the Wars of Religion, when Tanlay was a center of Huguenot resistance, left the residence uncompleted. Building was recommenced afterwards by Michel Particeli d'Hemery, the surintendant de finance under Mazarin, who completed the ch\u00e2teau to designs by Pierre Le Muet between 1643 and 1649.The dates are given by Claude Mignot. Since 1700 the property has remained in the family of the man who was created marquis de Tanlay in 1705.
