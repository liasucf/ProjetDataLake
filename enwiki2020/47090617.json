    "text": "The Ministry of Electric Power (; abbreviated MOEP) administers Burma's electric power policies. The Ministry is currently led by Win Khaing who is the minister for both MOEE and MOC. Myanmar Engineering Society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilized resource. Financing Geothermal projects in Myanmar use an estimated break even power cost of 5.3-8.6 U.S cents/kWh or in Myanmar Kyat 53-86K per kWh. This pegs a non-fluctuating 1$=1000K, which is a main concern for power project funding. The main drawback with depreciation pressures, in the current FX market. Between June 2012 and October 2015, the Myanmar Kyat depreciated by approximately 35%, from 850 down to 1300 against the US Dollar. Local businesses with foreign denominated loans from abroad suddenly found themselves rushing for a strategy to mitigate currency risks. Myanmar\u2019s current lack of available currency hedging solutions presents a real challenge for Geothermal project financing. == History == On 1 October 1951, Electricity Supply Board (ESB) was organized under the Ministry of Industry.
