    "text": "The Charles N. Vilas Bridge is a two-span concrete deck arch bridge over the Connecticut River between Bellows Falls, Vermont and North Walpole, New Hampshire. It was built in 1930 and has been closed since March 19, 2009. ==History== Colonel Enoch Hale built a wooden covered toll bridge on this site in 1784, the first bridge over the Connecticut River.Hard, pp. 143-144 The toll was 3\u00a2 for a man on horseback, double if he were in a chaise. If he were in a two-horse chaise, the toll was 20\u00a2. Captain Isaac DamonAllen, p.66 replaced it with the lattice truss Tucker Toll Bridge in 1840. He built lattice truss covered bridges all over New England and New York, including 11 over the Connecticut River. Vilas Bridge dedication plaque The Vilas Bridge was built in 1930, rehabilitated in 1974, and closed on March 19, 2009. It is a two-span, concrete arch bridge with open spandrels and \"turned\" concrete bolsters holding up its railing. A plaque is mounted on the bridge containing a section of \"The Bridge Builder\" by Will Allen Dromgoole. The final stanza of the poem \"The Bridge Builder\" by Will Allen Dromgoole as engraved on the Vilas Bridge ===Rehabilitation effort=== Concrete railing of the Vilas Bridge in 2008. The condition of this bridge has been a concern of the community for some time because it has been crumbling. New Hampshire delayed repairs due to financial restrictions on the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDoT). The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) has made overtures to the NHDoT to get the bridge open sooner, as the NHDoT was in the middle of a financial crisis. VTrans' commissioner Brian Searles made the offer to Chris Clement at the NHDoT in December 2013 to front the repair money if NHDoT would fund Vermont's part of other repairs later. Opponents of repair state that there are other bridges nearby which serve this community, so the Vilas Bridge is not needed, while other bridges without any nearby alternatives are also in need of maintenance. New Hampshire rejected Vermont's offer. New Hampshire bill HB 1205 was created in 2014 to split the estimated $5M repair cost evenly with Vermont, instead of the usual 7 percent from Vermont and 93 percent from New Hampshire by ownership percentage. Further action will mean putting the Vilas Bridge back on New Hampshire's 10-year plan, which requires New Hampshire legislative action. == See also == * List of crossings of the Connecticut River ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Bridges over the Connecticut River Category:Buildings and structures in Bellows Falls, Vermont Category:Walpole, New Hampshire Category:Bridges completed in 1930 Category:Bridges in Cheshire County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Windham County, Vermont Category:Road bridges in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:Concrete bridges in the United States Category:Open- spandrel deck arch bridges in the United States Category:Lattice truss bridges in the United States Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States ",
