He lives in the United States, where he is a Professor and writer in residence at Bard College. He left Romania in 1986 with a DAAD-Berlin Grant and in 1988 went to the US with a Fulbright Scholarship at the Catholic University in Washington DC. Manea's most acclaimed book, The Hooligan's Return (2003), is an original fictionalized memoir, encompassing a period of almost 80 years, from the pre-war period, through the Second World War, the communist and post-communist years to the present. Manea has been known and praised as an international important writer since the early 1990s, and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages.Manea's books have been reviewed in the American, British, French, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, German press.

He has received more than 20 awards and honors. ==Early years== Born in the neighborhood of Suceava (Bukovina, Romania), Manea was deported as a child, in 1941, by the Romanian fascist authorities, allied with Nazi Germany, to a concentration camp in Transnistria, together with his family. He returned to Romania in 1945 with the surviving members of his family and graduated with high honors from the high school (liceu) Stefan cel Mare in his home town, Suceava. He studied engineering at the Construction Institute in Bucharest and graduated with master's degree in hydro-technique in 1959, working afterwards in planning, fieldwork and research. He has devoted himself to writing since 1974. ==Literary career== In 1966, his literary debut took place in Povestea Vorbii (The Story of Speech), an avant-garde and influential magazine that appeared in the early years of cultural liberalization in communist Romania and was suppressed after six issues. Until he was forced into exile (1986) he published ten volumes of short fiction essays and novels. His work was an irritant to the authorities because of the implied and overt social-political criticism and he faced a lot of trouble with the censors and the official press. At the same time that sustained efforts were made by the cultural authorities to suppress his work, it had the support and praise of the country's most important literary critics. After the collapse of the Ceau\u0219escu dictatorship, several of his books started to be published in Romania. The publication in a Romanian translation of his essay Happy Guilt, which first appeared in The New Republic, led to a nationalist outcry in Romania, which he in turn has analysed in depth in his essay \"Blasphemy and Carnival\". Echoes of this scandal can still be found in some articles of the current Romanian cultural press. Meantime, in the United States and in European countries, Manea's writing was received with great acclaim. Over the past two decades he has been proposed as a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature by literary and academic personalities and institutions in the United States, Sweden, Romania, Italy and France. Important contemporary writers expressed admiration of the author's literary work and his moral stand before and after the collapse of communism: the Nobel laureates Heinrich B\u00f6ll, G\u00fcnter Grass, Octavio Paz, Orhan Pamuk, as well as Philip Roth, Claudio Magris, Antonio Tabucchi, E. M. Cioran, Antonio Mu\u00f1oz Molina, Cynthia Ozick, Louis Begley and others. ==Honors== *1979 \u2013 Literary Prize of the Bucharest Writers' Association (Romania) *1984 \u2013 Literary Prize of the Romanian Writer's Union (withdrawn by the Communist authorities) *1987 \u2013 DAAD Berliner K\u00fcnstler Programm Grant (Germany) *1988 \u2013 Fulbright Scholarship, Catholic University, Washington, DC (USA) *1989\u20131992 \u2013 International Academy for Scholarship and the Arts Fellowship, Bard College (USA) *1992 \u2013 Guggenheim Fellowship (USA) *1992 \u2013 MacArthur Fellows Award (USA) *1993 \u2013 The National Jewish Book Award (USA) *1996 \u2013 The Marie Syrkin Jerusalem Fellowship in Letters (Israel) *1997 \u2013 The Bukovina Literary Prize (Romania) *2002 \u2013 The International Nonino Prize (Italy) *2004, 2005 \u2013 American Academy Fellowship in Berlin (Germany) *2004 \u2013 The Napoli Literary Prize for foreign novel (Italy) *2005 \u2013 Holtzbrinck Prize of the American Academy in Berlin (Germany) *2005 \u2013 Best foreign book in Spain (El Regreso del Huligan / The Hooligan's Return) *2006 \u2013 Lux Mundi, the Cultural Award of Radio Romania Cultural (Romania) *2006 \u2013 Elected jury member of the International Nonino Prize (Italy) *2006 \u2013 Finalist, Prix Femina (France) *2006 \u2013 Prix M\u00e9dicis \u00c9tranger (France) *2006 \u2013 The Cultural Prize of Romanian International Television (Romania) *2006 \u2013 Elected member of the Berlin Academy of Art (Germany) *2007 \u2013 Finalist, Latinity Prize of the Association of Latin Countries *2007 \u2013 Awarded the Order of Cultural Merit (in rank of Commander) by the President of Romania (Romania) *2008 \u2013 Honorary degree in literature, University of Bucharest (Romania) *2008 \u2013 Honorary degree in literature, Babe\u0219-Bolyai University (Romania) *2009 \u2013 The Literary Award of the Fondation du Judaisme Fran\u00e7ais (France) *2009 \u2013 Finalist, Literary Prize of Fundaci\u00f3n Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias (Spain) *2009 \u2013 The Observator Cultural Lifetime Award Opera Omnia (Romania) *2009 \u2013 Commandant dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres(France) *2011 \u2013 Nelly Sachs Prize (Germany) *2012 \u2013 Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature *2012 \u2013 Honorary Degree in Literature, Al.I.Cuza University of Iassy (Romania) *2012 \u2013 Fellow of the Institute for Humanities (New York University) *2012 \u2013 The National Prize for Literature (Romanian Writers Union) *2012 \u2013 The Palau i Fabre Prize for Essay (Spain) ==Works (Romanian)== *1969 Noaptea pe latura lunga (Night on the Long Side) (short fiction), Editura pentru literatur\u0103 *1970 Captivi (Captives) (novel), Editura Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103; 2011 \u2013 second edition, Polirom *1974 Primele porti (First Gates) (short fiction), Albatros *1977 Cartea Fiului (Book of the Son) (novel); 2011 \u2013 second edition, Polirom *1979 Anii de ucenicie ai lui August Prostul (The Apprenticeship Years of Augustus the Fool) (documentary novel); 2012 \u2013 second edition, Polirom *1981 Octombrie, ora opt (October, eight o'clock) (short fiction); 1997 \u2013 second edition, Apostrof *1984 Pe Contur (On the Edge) (essays) *1986 Plicul negru (The Black Envelope) (novel); 1996 \u2013 second edition, Editura Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103; 2003, 2006 \u2013 Polirom *1997 Despre Clovni: Dictatorul si Artistul (On Clowns: The Dictator and the Artist) (essays); 2005, 2006, 2013 \u2013 Polirom *1999 Fericirea obligatorie (Compulsory Happiness) (novellas), Apostrof; 2005, 2011 \u2013 Polirom *1999 Casa melcului (The Snail\u2019s House) (interviews), Hasefer *2003 Intoarcerea huliganului (The Hooligan\u2019s Return) (novelistic memoir), Polirom; 2006, 2011 \u2013 Polirom *2004 Plicuri si portrete (Envelopes and Portraits) (essays), Polirom *2006 Textul nomad (The Nomad Text) (interviews), Hasefer *2008 Vorbind pietrei (Talking to a Stone), Polirom *2008 Inaintea despartirii (Before Parting) (conversation with Saul Bellow), Polirom *2009 Vizuina (The Lair) (novel), Polirom; 2010 \u2013 Polirom *2010 Laptele negru (The black milk) (essays and interviews), Hasefer *2010 Curierul de Est.
