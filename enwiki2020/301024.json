It also was used as a contraceptive by ancient Greeks and Romans. It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin (laser, laserpicium, or lasarpicium). Silphium was an important species in prehistory, as evidenced by the Egyptians and Knossos Minoans developing a specific glyph to represent the silphium plant. It was used widely by most ancient Mediterranean cultures; the Romans who mentioned the plant in poems or songs, considered it \"worth its weight in denarii\" (silver coins), or even gold. Legend said that it was a gift from the god Apollo. The exact identity of silphium is unclear. It is commonly believed to be a now- extinct plant of the genus Ferula,J.L. Tatman, \"Silphium, Silver and Strife: A History of Kyrenaika and Its Coinage\" Celator 14.10 (October 2000:6\u201324). perhaps a variety of \"giant fennel\". The still-extant plants ' and Ferula tingitanaDid the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?, The Straight Dope, October 13, 2006 have been suggested as other possibilities. Another plant, asafoetida, was used as a cheaper substitute for silphium, and had similar enough qualities that Romans, including the geographer Strabo, used the same word to describe both.Dalby, page 18. ==Identity and extinction== A coin of Magas of Cyrene circa 300 - 282/75 BC. Rev: silphium and small crab symbols. The identity of silphium is highly debated. It is generally considered to belong to the genus Ferula, probably as an extinct species (although the currently extant plants ', Ferula tingitana, Ferula narthex, and Thapsia garganica have historically been suggested as possible identities).Alfred C. Andrews, \"The Silphium of the Ancients: A Lesson in Crop Control\"., Isis 33.2 (June 1941:232\u2013236). Theophrastus mentioned Silphium as having thick roots covered in black bark, about 48 centimeters long, or one cubit, with a hollow stalk, similar to fennel, and golden leaves, like celery. The cause of silphium's supposed extinction is not entirely known. The plant grew along a narrow coastal area, about , in Cyrenaica (in present-day Libya).\"Off this tract is the island of Platea, which the Cyrenaeans colonized. Here too, upon the mainland, are Port Menelaus, and Aziris, where the Cyrenaeans once lived. The Silphium begins to grow in this region, extending from the island of Platea on the one side to the mouth of the Syrtis on the other.\" (Herodotus, iv.168\u2013198 on-line text) Much of the speculation about the cause of its extinction rests on a sudden demand for animals that grazed on the plant, for some supposed effect on the quality of the meat. Overgrazing combined with overharvesting may have led to its extinction.Pliny, XIX, Ch.15 Demand for its contraceptive use was reported to have led to its extinction in the third or second century BCE. The climate of the Maghreb has been drying over the millennia, and desertification may also have been a factor. Another theory is that when Roman provincial governors took over power from Greek colonists, they over-farmed silphium and rendered the soil unable to yield the type that was said to be of such medicinal value. Theophrastus wrote in Enquiry into Plants that the type of ferula specifically referred to as \"silphium\" was odd in that it could not be cultivated.Theophrastus, III.2.1, VI.3.3 He reports inconsistencies in the information he received about this, however.Theophrastus, VI.3.5 This could suggest the plant is similarly sensitive to soil chemistry as huckleberries are, which when grown from seed are devoid of fruit. Similar to the soil theory, another theory holds that the plant was a hybrid, which often results in very desired traits in the first generation, but second-generation can yield very unpredictable outcomes. This could have resulted in plants without fruits, when planted from seeds, instead asexually reproducing through their roots. Pliny reported that the last known stalk of silphium found in Cyrenaica was given to the Emperor Nero \"as a curiosity\". ==Ancient medicine== Many medical uses were ascribed to the plant.Pliny, XXII, Ch. 49 It was said that it could be used to treat cough, sore throat, fever, indigestion, aches and pains, warts, and all kinds of maladies. Hippocrates wrote: > When the gut protrudes and will not remain in its place, scrape the finest > and most compact silphium into small pieces and apply as a cataplasm. The plant may also have functioned as a contraceptive and abortifacient. Many species in the parsley family have estrogenic properties, and some, such as wild carrot, are known to act as abortifacients. ==Culinary uses== Silphium was used in Greco-Roman cooking, notably in recipes by Apicius. Long after its extinction, silphium continued to be mentioned in lists of aromatics copied one from another, until it makes perhaps its last appearance in the list of spices that the Carolingian cook should have at hand\u2014Brevis pimentorum que in domo esse debeant (\"A short list of condiments that should be in the home\")\u2014by a certain \"Vinidarius\", whose excerpts of ApiciusA generic term for a cookery book, as Webster is of American dictionaries. survive in one eighth-century uncial manuscript. Vinidarius's dates may not be much earlier.Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, Anthea Bell, tr. The History of Food, revised ed. 2009, p. 434. ==Connection with the heart symbol== Drawing of Heracleum sphondylium, showing its heart-shaped mericarp Ancient silver coin from Cyrene depicting a seed or fruit of silphium There has been some speculation about the connection between silphium and the traditional heart shape (\u2665). Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6\u20135th century BCE bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant, and is understood to represent its seed or fruit.T. V. Buttrey, \"The Coins and the Cult\", Expedition magazine vol. 34, Nos. 1\u20132 \"Special Issue: Gifts to the Goddesses\u2014Cyrene's Sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone\", Spring\u2013Summer 1992. Some plants in the family Apiaceae, such as Heracleum sphondylium, have heart-shaped indehiscent mericarps (a type of fruit). Contemporary writings help tie silphium to sexuality and love. Silphium appears in Pausanias' Description of Greece in a story of the Dioscuri staying at a house belonging to Phormion, a Spartan, \"For it so happened that his maiden daughter was living in it. By the next day this maiden and all her girlish apparel had disappeared, and in the room were found images of the Dioscuri, a table, and silphium upon it.\"Pausanias, 3.16.3 Silphium as Laserpicium makes an appearance in a poem (Catullus 7) of Catullus to his lover Lesbia (though others have suggested that the reference here is instead to silphium's use as a treatment for mental illness, tying it to the \"madness\" of loveA.
