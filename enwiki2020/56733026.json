Hammarbyleden is an artificial waterway in Stockholm which connects Lake M\u00e4laren with Saltsj\u00f6n, the westernmost bay of the Baltic Sea. The waterway is located along the southern edge of S\u00f6dermalm, one of Stockholm's many islands. The waterway is composed mostly of interconnected natural bodies of water, which were expanded and dredged in the late-1910s and 1920s; the waterway was opened in 1929. A water lock was constructed as part of the project to account for the water level variation between Lake M\u00e4laren and the Baltic Sea. ==Route== The waterway begins at Liljeholmsviken (near the eastern edge of Lake M\u00e4laren) where it flows east into \u00c5rstaviken. At the eastern end of \u00c5rstaviken is the water lock, called , which lowers the water level from \u00c5rstaviken into Hammarby Sj\u00f6 (Hammarby Lake). The final connection between Hammarby Lake and Saltsj\u00f6n is made through the . The canal meets Saltsj\u00f6n near the wharf of Masthamnen. ==References== Category:Waterways in Sweden Category:Geography of Stockholm ",
