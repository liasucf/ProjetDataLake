    "text": "Paul Edward Draper (born 26 September 1970 in Liverpool) is an English singer- songwriter, musician and record producer, formerly the frontman of the rock band Mansun. == Biography == ===Early days=== Paul Draper grew up on Garmoyle Road in Wavertree, Liverpool before moving with his family to Connah's Quay, Deeside. Draper described it as \"the absolute nothing of Great Britain\", adding \"Deeside is just the bit where the Welsh people really aren't Welsh because they were infiltrated by the English in the Fifties and Sixties. It's where everyone from Liverpool ended up. Basically, just after the war, Liverpool had 800,000 people; now it's got 390,000 people, and the missing 400,000 all live in Deeside. It's a horrible, horrible place. In Liverpool, if you're 15 and you pick up an acoustic guitar in school and play a song, then people would listen. But in my school when I tried to take in a guitar, I was just a poof and a queer, and that was that\". Draper attended St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School, Flint and Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich) where he formed Grind with Steve Heaton and drummer Carlton Hibbert who regularly played around London and released one 12\" single before splitting. ===Mansun=== Draper returned home to study at Wrexham Art College before forming Mansun with bassist Stove King, and guitarist Dominic Chad. The band signed to Parlophone and released three studio albums before splitting in 2003 whilst recording their fourth. The bands debut album Attack Of The Grey Lantern was released in the UK on the 15th February 1997 and was released in Japan 9 days prior to the UK release with bonus tracks.The album spent a total of 19 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number one. Mansun's second album Six was released in the UK in September 1998 and peaked at number 6. Little Kix , Mansun's third album, was released in the UK in August 2000 and peaked at number 12. In 2004, Draper compiled Mansun's aborted fourth album recordings for release in the Kleptomania box set. On 16 May 2006, Draper announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer during fourth album sessions at Rockfield Studios. After a blister appeared on his left hand middle finger that kept bleeding, Draper visited a local doctor who took a sample of tissue from the finger. He was informed that it was a malignant tumour known as a \"Bowenoid Malignancy\", and responded positively to five cycles of chemotherapy. However, he was unable to play for several months after the tumour was cut out and his finger swelled up following treatment. === Musical influences === ==== The Beatles/ Prince ==== As a young man, Paul cited The Beatles as his favourite band and referenced Abbey Road as an influence with the song structures of their 1969 album (in particular tracks like 'She's So Heavy') - \"It wasn't standard verse chorus, verse chorus and that really interested me\". He also listened to his sister's copy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side Of The Moon to which he affectionately described as 'odd'. Prince is his all time number one artist with Purple Rain being a particular favourite . \"There is real elements of progressive rock in that\" says Draper . 'Attack Of The Grey Lantern' and 'Six' would later come to reflect these influences. In 2018 he said \"If you put my Dad's and my sisters' record collections together, well, I reckon that's how you get Mansun\" ===Post-Mansun career=== ==== Production work==== In October 2005, \"Alone in My Room\", a single by Skin (Skunk Anansie), co-written and co-produced by Draper, was released; his first involvement in any musical project since Kleptomania. He worked on a version of the 2006 Ibiza anthem \"Exceeder\" by the Dutch DJ Mason, which was uploaded to his MySpace page, and in 2009 produced and appeared on a track by The Joy Formidable, which was made available as a free download from the band's official website. Draper performed a version of Mansun's \"Wide Open Space\" at London Astoria's last ever gig before it closed on 14 January 2009 with My Vitriol. The two acts had toured together previously in 2000, along with King Adora. In October 2013, Draper stated that he was considering releasing material from his abandoned unrecorded solo album \"Spooky Action At A Distance\" which only existed in demo form, if there was enough interest. After a petition was set up on Facebook, he responded that he was going to give the idea of releasing solo material some \"very serious consideration\". On 5 May 2014, the debut single \"What Goes Around\" by The Anchoress was released. A collaboration between Draper and singer-songwriter Catherine AD (Catherine Anne Davies), the duo have recorded an album's worth of material with Draper having co-written several of the songs and co-produced the whole album. A follow up to the single is due for release on 20 October in the form of EP \"One For Sorrow\". In 2017, Davies reciprocally co-wrote 5 tracks on Draper's solo album Spooky Action. ===Solo career=== Draper's first solo song \"Feeling My Heart Run Slow\" was premiered at a Mansun convention held at The Live Rooms in Chester on 23 August 2014. Recorded especially to play at the convention, Draper with the help of musicians from The Anchoress sessions, recorded five songs from his unrecorded solo album with a view to completing a whole album's worth. Draper announced his first solo single would be released via monthly subscription service 'The Too Pure Singles Club' in April 2016. It was announced that the official release of his EP One would be on Kscope on 10 June 2016. On 25 November 2016, Draper released EP Two featuring lead track \u2018Friends Make The Worst Enemies \u2018 which was met with more praise - \"A sprightly, electro-infused solo single\" - NME, Tracks of the Week\" ...a significant step back into the spotlight from a generally underappreciated talent.\" - Prog Magazine and \"...an unmistakable voice and an ear for utterly addictive melody whatever the musical setting.\" - Louder Than War . His full length album, Spooky Action, was released on 11 August 2017.With huge fan support, the album was nominated for Album of the Year at the annual Progressive Music Awards. Spooky Action emerged to rave reviews and Top 20 chart success with the response so strong that the singer/guitarist's label, Kscope, decided to embark on a major Mansun reissue campaign. EP Three was released as a digital download only on March 16, 2018 featuring a reworked single version of \u2018Jealousy Is A Powerful Emotion\u2019 backed with acoustic versions of \u2018 Jealousy Is A Powerful Emotion\u2019 and \u2018Things People Want\u2019 .A Public Service Broadcasting remix of \u2018Friends Make The Worst Enemies\u2019 completed the EP. === Touring : 2017 - present === Ben Sink/ Paul Draper Band / Steven Wilson Draper undertook his first sell-out UK solo tour in September 2017 including a triumphant headline show at London's Scala which was recorded for the Live At Scala album and subsequently released on 16 February 2018.

A second solo tour in February/March 2018 saw Draper ambitiously take on doubleheader style gigs in which he performed his solo material and after a short interval, a second set playing Mansun's debut album Attack of the Grey Lantern in its entirety . Whilst the tour was a huge success ( even overcoming the chilling \u2018Beast From The East\u2019 weather ) there was some controversy at the Rescue Rooms in Nottingham where he appeared intoxicated, disoriented and forgot lyrics before exiting the stage . The following day, Draper issued a press release apologising for the show and claimed that a \"personal issue raised its head just prior to the gig\" that had upset him. Despite the difficulties with travel caused by the weather, the tour reached its conclusion in London in early March. In April 2018, Draper toured the U.S as support to Steven Wilson.
