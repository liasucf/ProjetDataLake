He hails from Porsgrunn, but joined Stab\u00e6k as a youth player and also featured for Norway internationally. He made his Norwegian Premier League debut in May 2016 against IK Start, but tore a cruciate ligament in June 2016. A year later he faced another surgery, this time in both shins. He never returned to Stab\u00e6k's first team, and ahead of the 2018 season he trialled with Lyn. After four matches for Lyn he retired because of the injuries. Former footballer Thomas \u00d8stvold is his uncle. ==References== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:People from Porsgrunn Category:Norwegian footballers Category:Norway youth international footballers Category:Eliteserien players Category:Stab\u00e6k Fotball players Category:Lyn Fotball players Category:Association football midfielders ",
