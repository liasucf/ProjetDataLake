Air racing is billed as \"the world's fastest motor sport\" and Reno is one of the few remaining venues. The event includes races in 6 classes and demonstrations by airshow pilots. ==History== Control Tower during the 2016 National Championship Air Races Pylon Racing Seminar Static aircraft on display at the 2014 Reno Air Races Begun in 1964, the Reno Air Races feature multi-lap, multi-aircraft races among extremely high performance aircraft on closed ovoid courses which range between about (Biplanes and Formula One) and about (Jet, Unlimited) in length per lap. The chief organizer is the Reno Air Racing Association (RARA). The first Reno air races, in 1964 and 1965, were organized by World War II veteran Bill Stead. They took place at Sky Ranch airfield, a dirt strip barely long, which was located in present-day Spanish Springs. After Stead Air Force Base (20 miles to the west, and named in honor of Bill's brother, Croston Stead) was closed in 1966, that field was turned over for public use, and the races have been held there since then. Aircraft in the Unlimited class, which consists almost entirely of both modified and stock World War II fighters, routinely reach speeds in excess of 400 miles per hour. In 2003, Skip Holm piloted Terry Bland's modified P-51D Mustang, Dago Red, and reached an all-time Unlimited class speed record of 507.105 mph in a six-lap race around the eight-and-a-half mile course. The recently added Sport Class racers, mostly homebuilt aircraft, are reaching speeds in excess of 400 mph. In 2009, Curt Brown set a record of 543.568 mph in his jet-engine L-29 Viper. The Reno Air Races include two and a half days of qualifying, followed by four and a half days of multi-aircraft heat racing, culminating in the Unlimited Class Gold Race on Sunday afternoon. The event also features civil airshow acts and military flight demonstrations between races, plus vendor areas and a large civil and military static aircraft display. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused the 57th annual race to be cancelled & deferred to 2021. ==Classes== *Unlimited *T-6 *Biplane *Formula One *Sport *Jet == 2019 Race Results == ===Unlimited Gold=== *Race 8, Dennis Sanders, Ione, California. \"Dreadnought\" TMK 20 Sea Fury \u2014 403.274 mph ===Jet Gold=== *Race 24, Pete Zaccagnino, Park City, Utah. \u201cJust Lucky\" L-29 Delfin \u2014 495.106 mph ===T-6 Gold=== *Race 14, Chris Rushing, Van Nuys, California. \"Barons Revenge\u201d AT-6B \u2014 235.081 mph === Sport Gold === *Race 30, Andrew Findlay, McCall, Idaho. \"One Moment\u201d Lancair Super Legacy \u2014 390.744 mph ===Biplane Gold=== *Race 62, Andrew Buehler, Olalla, Washington. \"Phantom\u201d Modified Mong Sport \u2014 (Gold race cancelled due to high winds - Heat 3A speed: 227.755 mph) === Formula One Gold === *Race 31, Lowell Slatter, Buhl Idaho. \"Fraed Naught\u201d Gilbert DG2 \u2014 243.442 mph == 2018 Race Results == ===Unlimited Gold=== *Race 8, Joel Swager, Ione, California. \"Dreadnought\" TMK 20 Sea Fury \u2014 417.735 mph ===Jet Gold=== *Race 5, Mike Steiger, Cypress, Texas. \u201cAmerican Spirit\" L-39 Albatros \u2014 486.208 mph ===T-6 Gold=== *Race 88, John Lohmar, Dallas, Texas. \"Radial Velocity\u201d SNJ-5 \u2014 228.612 mph === Sport Gold === *Race 30, Andrew Findlay, McCall, Idaho. \"One Moment\u201d Lancair Super Legacy \u2014 402.716 mph ===Biplane Gold=== *Race 62, Andrew Buehler, Olalla, Washington. \"Phantom\u201d Modified Mong Sport \u2014 221.721 mph === Formula One Gold === *Race 34, Justin Meaders, Fort Worth, Texas. \"Limitless\u201d Sno shoo SR-1 \u2014 239.521 mph == 2017 Race Results == ===Unlimited Gold=== *Race 7, James Consalvi, Lakewood, Colorado. \"Strega\" P-51D Mustang \u2014 481.340 mph ===Jet Gold=== *Race 5, Rick Vandam, Reno, Nevada. \"American Spirit\" L-39 Albatros\u2014 494.210 mph ===T-6 Gold=== *Race 14, John Lohmar, Dallas, Texas. \"Radial Velocity\" SNJ-5 \u2014 225.470 mph === Sport Gold === *Race 39, Jeff LaVelle, Mukilteo, Washington. \"Race 39\" Super Glasair III \u2014 388.313 mph ===Biplane Gold=== *Race 62, Andrew Buehler, Olalla, Washington. \"Phantom\" Modified Mong Sport \u2014 226.725 mph === Formula One Gold === *Race 31, Lowell Slatter, Buhl, Idaho. \"Fraed Naught\" Gilbert DG2 \u2014 242.104 mph ==2016 Race Results== ===Unlimited Gold=== *Race 5, Steven Hinton, Jr., Chino, California. \"Voodoo\" P-51D Mustang \u2014 460.306 mph ===Jet Gold=== *Race 5, Rick Vandam, Reno, Nevada. \"American Spirit\" L-39 Albatros \u2014 497.921 mph ===T-6 Gold=== *Race 14, Chris Rushing, Northridge, California. \"Baron's Revenge\" AT-6B \u2014 231.193 mph === Sport Gold === *Race 39, Jeff LaVelle, Mukilteo, Washington. \"Race 39\" Super Glasair III\u2014 383.397 mph ===Biplane Gold=== *Race 23, Jeff Rose, Carmichael, California. \"Reno Rabbit\" Mong Sport \u2014 217.858 mph === Formula One Gold === *Race 31, Lowell Slatter, Buhl, Idaho. \"Fraed Naught\" Gilbert DG2 \u2014 256.728 mph ==Prior Unlimited champions== ===2015 Unlimited Gold=== * Hoot Gibson, Murfreesboro, Tennessee. \"Strega\" P-51D Mustang \u2014 488.983 mph ===2014 Unlimited Gold=== * Steven Hinton, Jr., Chino, California. \"Voodoo\" P-51D Mustang \u2014 462.926 mph ===2013 Unlimited Gold=== * Steven Hinton, Jr., Chino, California. \"Voodoo\" P-51D Mustang \u2014 482.074 mph ===2012 Unlimited Gold=== * Steven Hinton, Jr., Chino, California. \"Strega\" P-51D Mustang \u2014 477.523 mph ==Significant participants== ===People=== Steven Hinton, Jr., 2014 Reno Air Races champion *Lee Behel *Robert Lee \"Hoot\" Gibson *Darryl Greenamyer *Steve Hinton *Steven Hinton, Jr. *Skip Holm *Bob Hoover *Gary Hubler *Rod Lewis *Doug Matthews *Thom Richard *Bill \"Tiger\" Destefani *Clay Lacy ===Aircraft=== *Dreadnought *232 September Fury *Dago Red *The Galloping Ghost *Nemesis *Nemesis NXT *Precious Metal *Rare Bear *Red Baron *Tsunami *Voodoo *Strega ==Fatalities== ===Before 2011=== From 1964 through 2010, 19 aviators lost their lives due to crashes and collisions in the course of the competition and airshow.
