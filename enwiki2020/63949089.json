    "text": "Philippines's 10th senatorial district, officially the Tenth Senatorial District of the Philippine Islands (), was one of the twelve senatorial districts of the Philippines in existence between 1916 and 1935. It elected two members to the Senate of the Philippines, the upper chamber of the bicameral Philippine Legislature under the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands for each of the 4th to 10th legislatures. The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the central Visayas province of Cebu. The district was represented by a total of five senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large. It was last represented by Sergio Osme\u00f1a and Manuel Briones of the Nacionalista Dem\u00f3crata Pro-Independencia. ==List of senators== {| class=wikitable |- ! colspan=7 | Seat A | rowspan=99 | ! rowspan=3 | Legislature | rowspan=99 | ! colspan=7 | Seat B |- style=\"height:3em\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history |- !Start!!End !Start!!End |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Filem\u00f3n Sotto | rowspan=\"2\" | October 16, 1916 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"2\" | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1916. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4th | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Celestino Rodr\u00edguez | rowspan=\"3\" | October 16, 1916 | rowspan=\"3\" | June 2, 1925 | rowspan=\"2\" | Nacionalista | Elected in 1916. |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5th | rowspan=\"2\" | Re-elected in 1919. |- | rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2 | style=\"background-color:#B22222| | rowspan=\"5\" | Sergio Osme\u00f1a | rowspan=\"5\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"5\" | September 16, 1935 | Nacionalista Unipersonalista | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1922. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6th | style=\"background-color:#B22222| | Nacionalista Unipersonalista |- | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Nacionalista Consolidado | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7th | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | 2 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Pedro Rodr\u00edguez | rowspan=\"2\" | June 2, 1925 | rowspan=\"2\" | June 2, 1931 | rowspan=\"2\" | Nacionalista Consolidado | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1925. |- | rowspan=\"2\" | Re-elected in 1928. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 8th |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9th | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3 | style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Manuel Briones | rowspan=\"2\" | June 2, 1931 | rowspan=\"2\" | September 16, 1935 | Nacionalista Consolidado | rowspan=\"2\" | Elected in 1931. |- | style=\"background:;\" | | Nacionalista Dem\u00f3crata Pro-Independencia | Re-elected in 1934. | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 10th | style=\"background:;\" | | Nacionalista Dem\u00f3crata Pro-Independencia |} ==See also== *Legislative districts of the Philippines ==References== Category:Senatorial districts of the Philippines Category:1916 establishments in the Philippines Category:1935 disestablishments in the Philippines Category:Politics of Cebu ",
