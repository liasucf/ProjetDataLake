The film is the tenth movie installment based on the television sitcom Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!. The film was announced on August 2016 with Marlon N. Rivera and Tony Y. Reyes attached as directors. The film was submitted as an entry for the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival but was not included as finalist. This will be the first Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!/Enteng Kabisote film that will not featured in the Metro Manila Film Festival. The film was released in theaters on November 30, 2016, together with The Super Parental Guardians. ==Plot== Enteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) has been living the comfortable life even without his other companions: Aiza (Aiza Seguerra), who is living in a faraway town; his wife Faye (Pauleen Luna) still in Encantasia; and Amy (Ruby Rodriguez) and her husband gone. But he was torn between his son Benok (Oyo Boy Sotto) and his pampered grandson (Alonzo Muhlach). He argues with Benok over who is right to raise his own son and goes to Bohol to tour it, meeting a member of \"Abangers\" who has the power of iron. He approaches a hotel attendant Georgia (Ryza Cenon) and Nicomaine (Maine Mendoza) and thinks the tour guide Richard (Alden Richards) is a handsome man, but disappointed, he continues the tour. Three old triplets (Jose Manalo), (Wally Bayola) and (Paolo Ballesteros) run a factory until the workers go into a strike and are exiled as punishment. Kwak Kwak (Epy Quizon) is one of those so-called OEWs that is banished by the leaders, hatches a plan to eliminate the Abangers and eventually Enteng so that his vengeance will be complete. He has sidekicks with duckfaces and other of his minions who are also Encantados who were exiles. Enteng was given a powered suit by the Abangers when they meet, but Kwak Kwak and his minions attacks and captures him and the group. They are put in stasis when Enteng pleads with the scientist to renege. The group later faces and defeats Kwak Kwak and his minions. The closing scenes depict what happened to the Abangers: one (Jerald Napoles) has owned a gym, another (Sinon Lloresca) became a comedy bar owner; another (Cacai Bautista) built a fortune teller shop in Makati that caters to the elite; the three Lolas became Eat Bulaga!'s characters (a nod from Kalyeserye's Explorer sisters); and the tour guide built his own shop. Enteng reunites with his family while talking to somebody on his phone. ==Cast== ===Main cast=== * Vic Sotto as Enteng Kabisote * Epi Quizon as Doctor Kwak Kwak * Oyo Boy Sotto as Benok Kabisote ===Supporting cast=== * Jose Manalo as Tinids/Lola Tinidora * Wally Bayola as Nini/Lola Nidora * Paolo Ballesteros as Tidi/Lola Tidora * Ryzza Mae Dizon as Bubu * Bea Binene as Allaine/A2 * Alonzo Muhlach as Benokis Kabisote * Ken Chan as Allan/A1 * Ryza Cenon as Ruth * Cacai Bautista as Ora/Oring * Jerald Napoles as Lucas Malakas * Jelson Bay as Remo/Remy * Sinon Loresca, Jr. as Beki/Bistika * Atak as Bibe * Max Collins as Bubu's Mother ===Special participation=== *Joey de Leon as Pandoy *Alden Richards as Richard/Aldrin *Maine Mendoza as Nicomaine/Divina *Pauleen Luna-Sotto as Faye Kabisote *Aiza Seguerra as Aiza Kabisote *Mikylla Ramirez as Ada Kabisote *John Feir as Security Guard#1 *Mike \"Pekto\" Nacua as Security Guard #2 *Ate Gay *Pilita Corrales *Freddie Webb *Allan K as Fake Faye *Jaya as Herself *Ervic Vijandre as Cute Guy at the airport ==Production== ===Development=== On 10 August 2016, a story conference was held announcing the return of Enteng Kabisote in the silver screen.
