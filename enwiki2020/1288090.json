They had introduced their original material into their cover sets years before they were signed to Atlantic Records, including \"The La La Song\", \"Free\" and \"Bears\" (originally entitled \"The Bears are Hibernating\"). Zebra had been noticed by local colleges and even had some of their early original performances recorded by Long Island FM radio station WBAB, culminating in the inclusion of one of their songs on a release of \"WBAB Homegrown Album\", which commemorated local acts and performances culled from the station's on-air \"Homegrown Hour\" program. Zebra's mainstream debut on Atlantic Records was in 1983 with their eponymous album, produced by Jack Douglas and featuring the singles \"Tell Me What You Want\" and \"Who's Behind The Door?\" The band continued to tour throughout the 1980s, but took a temporary break in the early 1990s after being dropped by Atlantic Records.

Although Zebra has not released any studio material since 2003's Zebra IV, the band continues to perform live, mostly in the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States, including New Orleans and New York City.
