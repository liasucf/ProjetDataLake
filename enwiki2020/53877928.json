    "text": "The Ungererstra\u00dfe is a street about 2.5 km long in the Schwabing district of Munich. It leads (parallel to the English Garden) from Leopoldstra\u00dfe at the M\u00fcnchner Freiheit in the north-east direction past the Ungererbad and the Nordfriedhof to Freimann past the Studentenstadt to Freisinger Landstra\u00dfe at the corner of the Frankfurter Ring. In the northern part, west of the road, lies Neuer Israelitische Friedhof. The street's subway stations are: Dietlindenstra\u00dfe, Nordfriedhof, Alte Heide and Studentenstadt. The Ungererstra\u00dfe was formerly called Landshuter Stra\u00dfe and Freisinger Landstra\u00dfe, before it was renamed after August Ungerer (1860-1921), the engineer and owner of the Ungererbad. In 1886, August Ungerer opened the Ungerer Tramway in the Freisinger Landstra\u00dfe, which was the first electric tram in Munich to link Schwabing's W\u00fcrmbad (today Ungererbad) to the horse-drawn railway network at the Schwabinger Gro\u00dfwirt. In 1895, the Ungererbahn was replaced by a new horse-drawn carriage track, which continued on the Freisinger Landstra\u00dfe to the Nordfriedhof. In 1900, the tram line in the Ungererstra\u00dfe was the last Munich horse-drawn railway line to be converted to electric operation. In 1917, the tram was extended from the Nordfriedhof on the Ungererstra\u00dfe to the Frankfurter Ring. In the course of the construction of the subway, the since 1935 driven \"Stra\u00dfenbahnlinie 6\" route was moved between the M\u00fcnchner Freiheit and Schenkendorfstra\u00dfe to the parallel Leopoldstra\u00dfe and Berliner Stra\u00dfe in 1965, at the same time, the section from the Nordfriedhof to the Freimanner platz was stopped. In 1967 the section from Schenkendorfstra\u00dfe to the Wendeschleife at the Nordfriedhof was the last tram line on the Ungererstra\u00dfe to be closed down. Since 1970, the subway line 6 runs to the subway station Alte Heide under the Ungererstra\u00dfe and in the north section parallel to the Ungererstra\u00dfe. From 1901 to 1949, the railway connection of the locomotive factory J. A. Maffei in the Hirschau at the Munich-Schwabing station, crossed the Ungererstra\u00dfe south of Schenkendorfstra\u00dfe with a railway crossing. Through this, a rail crossing was created with the tram rails.
