The season began with the team trying to improve on their 5\u20139 record from 1962 under new head coach Weeb Ewbank. The Jets finished the season 5\u20138\u20131, while playing their final season of home games at the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan, before relocating to Shea Stadium in the borough of Queens the following season. 1964 game program showing the original Jets uniform, established in 1963. The helmet is not shown. In rebranding itself as the Jets, the club abandoned its navy-blue and gold uniforms in favor of kelly green and white. The jerseys had opposite-colored sleeves with thick stripes on the shoulders and cuffs, above and below the TV numerals. The pants were white with two parallel green stripes on each side. The new helmets were white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo on each side was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. ==Roster== ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
