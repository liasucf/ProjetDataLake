Realizing their fragile existence, immediate efforts were made to protect the herd. The government deployed five staff members, providing four of them with arms. A guard post was also established in the same year. This particular herd is the northernmost surviving herd of blackbucks in the world. In 2009, the herd numbered 202 comprising 73 males, 111 females and 18 calves. During 1995\u20131997, the Government of Nepal obtained private land for blackbuck conservation.Bhatta, S. R. (2008).
