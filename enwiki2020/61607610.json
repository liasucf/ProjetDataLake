    "text": "WXZE was a radio station on 1540 AM in Sylvester, Georgia, operating between 1963 and the late 1980s. ==History== 1540 kHz in Sylvester went on the air on December 16, 1963 as WOGA, owned by Worth County Broadcasters. It was a 1,000-watt, daytime-only station with studios in the historic First National Bank Building at 102 North Isabella Street. The original owners of Worth County Broadcasters, James Rouse and James Sutton, sold their stakes in the station to William R. Crews in 1972. The Crews family sold the station for $250,000 to Feldman Broadcasters, Inc., in 1979, and the new owners changed the call letters to WRSG on October 2. WRSG aired middle-of-the-road music. In 1984, WRSG was sold to a group known as 5-Star Media; several of its members worked at radio stations in Atlanta. WRSG relaunched as WXZE on January 18, 1985; the new station branded as \"Wixieland Country\". In 1987, however, WXZE flipped to classic rock. The rock format flip received national attention because of the protest of one of the station's DJs. Kurt Andrews, upset at the change in format, barricaded himself in the control room, refused to answer the telephone, and proceeded to play Bob Seger's \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" for seven hours, stopping only for commercials and newscasts. While Andrews's contract precluded him from quitting or being fired, station manager Bryan O'Bryan quipped, \"It doesn't say anything about what happens if I shoot him.\" The station folded not long after. ==References== ==External links== *FCC History Cards for WXZE Category:Radio stations established in 1963 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1989 XZE Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:1963 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1989 disestablishments in Georgia (U.S. state) XZE XZE ",
