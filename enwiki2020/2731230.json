He succeeded Bela ben Beor in the apparently elective kingship of the Edomites. He ruled from Bozrah. He was succeeded by Husham. Although Adam Clarke maintains a different position, many notable Bible scholars identify Jobab with the biblical figure Job. A book by David J. Gibson entitled Whence Came the Hyksos, Kings of Egypt offers a detailed defense of the theory based on numerous Scriptures from the Book of Job, personal names, geography, occupation, and contemporaries. The same identification is present in Russian Orthodox Church's tradition: Church Slavonic versions of Book of Job and Russian Synodal Bible include a postscript in which Jobab is identified with Job, the anonymous author of the postscript refers to a \"Syriac book\"\u0412\u0435\u0442\u0445\u0438\u0439 \u0417\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442: \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0418\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 42. // \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c. \u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u0442\u0430 The date of his reign are unknown, and there is much dispute concerning whether the supposed connection with Job is even valid. == See also == * Hyksos == External links == * Kings of Egypt *Land of Edom *The Hyksos, Kings of Egypt and the land of Edom == References == Category:Kings of Edom Category:Job (biblical figure) Category:Book of Genesis people ",
