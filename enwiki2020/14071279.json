    "text": "IMI Systems, previous Israel Military Industries, also referred to as Ta'as (), was an Israeli weapons manufacturer. It manufactured weapons, munitions and military technology mainly for Israeli security forces (especially Israel's army, the Israel Defense Forces or IDF). On 25 November 2018, Elbit Systems completed acquisition of IMI Systems and then renamed it as Elbit Systems Land. The historical logo of IMI Systems until January 2016 == Small arms == Manufacturing gun barrels in an IMI factory, 1955 Israel Weapon Industries' small arms are some of the most popular in the world. The Uzi submachine gun is arguably the most popular submachine gun in the world, because of its compact nature and reliability. Overall, the Uzi has the highest sales statistics of all modern submachine guns, worldwide. The IMI Galil is a compact assault rifle, along with integrating some other design features. The Negev is IMI's main light machine gun. The Jericho 941 is a semi-automatic pistol, while the Tavor is a bullpup assault rifle. In the 1980s an American firearms designer, Magnum Research, contracted IMI to re- design and manufacture a Magnum caliber (.44 Magnum, .357 Magnum and .50 AE), semi-automatic pistol. The result was the Desert Eagle, a very powerful handgun made famous by Hollywood and first-person shooters. Other products are created, mainly for use by the IDF. The Uzi, however, is popular with many forces worldwide, while the Galil and Tavor are popular with counter-terrorist forces. In 2005, Israel Military Industries sold its Magen division (Small Arms Division) to Israeli privately owned holding company SK Group and renamed Israel Weapon Industries. ==Other products== Entrance to IMI headquarters IMI has dedicated factories manufacturing ammunition for firearms, artillery (both explosive rounds and rockets), tanks and air-to-ground (both stand-off and direct attack). Many of its products are standard NATO-compatible, but IMI also produces eastern bloc-caliber munitions. However, for the past the weapons have not been STANAG compliant. Besides small arms, the IMI also produces heavy weapons. IMI engages in many upgrade projects for military vehicles (tanks, APCs and other armoured fighting vehicles). Upgrade components include firepower, survivability and maneuverability. IMI also produces a wide range of defensive products such as vehicle add-on armor packages, landmine clearing systems, and reconnaissance systems and bridges. It also produces aircraft countermeasures, such as flares, decoys and electronic countermeasures control systems, some of which IMI now offers also for land- and sea-based platforms. ==Products== ===Vehicles=== *Wildcat APC MRAP *COMBATGUARD armored combat vehicle ===Rifles=== *Romat *Galil ACE *Galil *Tavor *Tavor X95 ===Machine guns/pistols=== *Negev *Uzi ===Semi-automatic pistols=== *Jericho 941 *SP-21 Barak *IMI Desert Eagle ===Missiles and Launchers=== *MAPATS *Delilah *MARS *MAR-290 *LAR-160 *Romach *ACCULAR *EXTRA *Predator Hawk *MSOV ===Tank guns=== *IMI 120 mm gun \u2013 Tank Gun ===Bombs and Grenades=== *FASTLIGHT *MPR500 *Refaim bullet-trap rifle-grenade ===Accessories=== *CornerShot and attachments ===Armor add-ons=== *Armor plating coat *Explosive reactive armour *Tractor protection kit (TPK) for Caterpillar D7 *Armor kit for Caterpillar D9 bulldozer (L\\N) *Iron Fist active protection system - Active protection system (APS) ==Security training== IMI also provides military training to the Israeli citizens. IMI contracts its services to outside countries that need security and military training. The clients come to IMI in Israel for months of security and V.I.P. training. IMI does not produce cluster weapons. Cluster weapons have allegedly been proven to cause civilian casualties - in Lebanon in 2006, and in the 2008 South Ossetia war. Users claim that defective munitions were responsible.Human Rights Watch charges Georgia used defective Israeli-made cluster bombs ==Metropolitan College of New York== Israel Military Industries also has a partnership with the Metropolitan College of New York (MCNY) in New York City. Metropolitan College of New York offers a classroom based Master's In Public Administration in Emergency Management and Homeland Security. In addition, all students go to Israel for an intensive study abroad seminar covering Homeland Security and Anti-Terrorism topics with Israel's top security and military experts. ==See also== *Israel Weapon Industries *Ashot Ashkelon *Military equipment of Israel ==References== ==External links== * *Israeli Weapons Industry (formerly IMI small arms division) Category:Firearm manufacturers of Israel Category:Defense companies of Israel Category:Formerly government-owned companies of Israel ",
