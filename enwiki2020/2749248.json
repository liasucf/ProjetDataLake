The 17th edition of the festival in 2016 featured 160 films in the program. The festival leader is Tor Fosse, and BIFF is owned by Bergen Cinema. The festivals main venue is Bergen Cinema's Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre, with additional screenings taking place at the local art film theatre at Georgernes Verft and at the student cinema at Kvarteret. ==History== The Magnus Barefoot Cinema Centre i Bergen, the main venue of BIFF. In 2000, Bergen was a European Capital of Culture. Due to the occasion, Bergen Cinema arranged Bergen International Film Festival, with the most important films from the festival circuit of the year and many sneak previews of movies already picked up for Norwegian distribution. BIFF was one of the most successful events to take place during the celebration of the Cultural City with almost 20,000 visitors, and was arranged again the year after. Over the years the festival has grown to be one of the biggest in Norway, with more than 160 films and 64,000 admissions in 2016. ==Programmes== Bergen International Film Festival is organised in various sections: * Checkpoints, the main program at BIFF, hosted with the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights, consisting of documentaries focusing on human rights. Since 2010, a jury has selected a winner. * International Documentary Program, with a special selection competing for the best international documentary award. * Norwegian Documentary Program, with a special selection competing for awards for best Norwegian documentary and best Norwegian short documentary. * Norwegian Short Film Competition, a special program of short films, where filmmakers have to apply before being accepted. ==BIFF and education== Bergen International Film Festival has an extensive program for high school and junior high school students in Bergen. BIFFs offers schools in the area to participate in two different programs: ===BIFF for Schools=== The festival offers free showing of documentaries that covers important subjects in history, democracy and human rights. BIFF also tries to bring filmmakers and even the characters the films portray to the screenings, making it possible for the students to converse with the talent afterwards. In 2010, former mayors of Bogot\u00e1, Antanas Mockus and Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa held strong appeals to students of the power of local democracy after the showings of Bogota Change. ===The School Film Festival=== BIFF also offers a crash course film school for junior high schools, with professional filmmakers holding seminars.
