On 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after it was found that data provided by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency had been manipulated by Russian authorities with a goal of protecting athletes involved in its state-sponsored doping scheme. As at the 2018 Winter Olympics, WADA will allow individual cleared Russian athletes to compete neutrally under a title to be determined (which may not include the name \"Russia\"). Russia has filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). == Ice hockey == Russia has qualified 25 male and 23 female competitors to the ice hockey tournaments as part of their two teams. ===Men's tournament=== Russia men's national ice hockey team qualified by being ranked 2nd in the 2019 IIHF World Rankings.
