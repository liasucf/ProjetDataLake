It runs on a Core-2 Duo processor of 6GB RAM with another additional processor for hardware control. Ribo is controlled by Ubuntu and Windows based Operating System. The OS powers the robot's multimedia system including a camera, a microphone array with an RGB and depth camera. The microphone array of the Kinect device was used as the sound source for 3D sound localization.

The eyelids help Ribo to blink like a human being and the eyebrows help to show different facial expressions. By using a support vector machine, Ribo can understand facial gestures. ===Specifications=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Ribo |- | Height || |- | Weight || |- | Power supply || AC, Li-Po 11.1V 25C |- | Degrees of Freedom || 24 (Face: 8; Arm: 7\u00d72; Torso: 2) |- | Processor || Intel Core 2 Duo, Arduino Mega |- | OS || Ubuntu, Windows |- | Programming language || Python, Java, C++, C# |- | Sensors || Motion sensors, RGB cameras, Microphone array, Touch sensor |- | Language || Bengali |} == Public appearance == Ribo made its first public appearance at the Bangladesh Science Fiction Festival held on December 2015.
