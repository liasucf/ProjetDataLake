    "text": "Lutetian limestone (in French, calcaire lut\u00e9cien, and formerly calcaire grossier) \u2014 also known as \u201cParis stone\u201d \u2014 is a variety of limestone particular to the Paris, France, area. It has been a source of wealth as an economic and versatile building material since ancient Roman times (see Mines of Paris) and has contributed markedly to the unique visual appeal of the \u201cCity of Light\u201d. (It has been hailed as \u201cthe warm, elusive, cream-grey stone of the French capital\u201d.Lichfield, John (2007), \u201cThe Stones of Paris\u201d, The Independent, (22 Sept issue).) Its formation dates to the Eocene epoch's Lutetian age (between ). The name \"Lutetian\" derives from Lutetia (French, Lut\u00e8ce) which was the city's name in ancient times. ==History== Between the 17th and 19th centuries, Lutetian limestone was extracted by tunneling through hill-sides south of Paris. The stone comprises many of the grandest Paris buildings from the 17th century onwards, including parts of the Louvre, the Place de la Concorde and Les Invalides. Haussmann's grand renovation of Paris (1853-1870), which provided a sweeping and uniform style and an elusive coloring \u2014 ranging from bright white to butter-yellow to a dull nicotine-yellow/grey \u2014 for the city, relied upon buildings faced with Lutetian limestone. In the 20th century, open-cast quarries were developed which uncovered thinner layers of harder limestone closer to the surface north of Paris. A now fashionable variety of Lutetian limestone from about 25 miles north of Paris is known as \u201cOise stone\u201d or \"Saint-Maximin limestone\" and has become popular internationally for upscale building projects. In 2007, the quarries in southern Oise, around Saint-Maximin and Chantilly, applied to the French government to become the first to be granted a building stone Appellation Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e \u2013 the badge of official French regional excellence \u2013 as if it were a wine or a cheese. According to a 2007 article in the UK's The Independent: \u201cThe harder, sliceable limestone sells for around \u20ac2,000 a cubic metre. The different grades of softer building stone sell for between \u20ac550 and \u20ac150 a cubic metre, which is very competitive with other building stone all around the world.\u201dLichfield, Op. cit.. ==References== ==See also== *List of types of limestone The \"City of Light\" owes much of its uniformity and visual appeal to the many buildings faced with Lutetian Limestone.
