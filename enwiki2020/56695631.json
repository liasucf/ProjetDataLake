    "text": "Monster Magic is an out-of-print collectible card game by Trio Toys. It was released in 1995. The first and only set was called Alpha Series and had 104 cards. The packaging for the game suggested that four more expansions may have been released which would bring the total to 520 cards, however its unlikely they were ever released. The game was reviewed by Scrye and gameplay was described as little more than a set of playing cards. Cards had a horror motif, with glossy cards using rock star puns for the card names, such as \"Axel Rhodes\" that depicted a skeleton with a microphone. ==References== Category:Collectible card games Category:Card games introduced in 1995 ",
