References to it appear in documents dating from the ninth century. Originally built in Mud\u00e9jar style (of the structure only the campanile survives), it was rebuilt in 1645. ==History== Belfry of the San Gin\u00e9s Church. The church was one of the churches of the medieval Madrid, of Mozarab origin, from between the 12th and 13th centuries, and its name comes from the fact that it was dedicated to the patron saint of notaries and secretaries, Saint Genesius of Arles (San Gin\u00e9s de Arl\u00e9s).MADRID HIST\u00d3RICO - Historia Fallen Christ (1698), designed by Nicol\u00f2 Fumo. It was declared Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural in 1982. ==Description== The church is preceded by an atrium enclosed by railings. It has a Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles separated by semicircular arches and several side chapels and the altarpieces belong to the Neoclassical-Romantic school. It was, however, reconstructed after suffering several fires, so few remnants of the original church, such as the bell-tower, remain. In 1870, the loggia and atrium were added. The tower has a beautiful Madrid-style slate spire that incorporates great verticality into the construction. In the Sant\u00edsimo Cristo Chapel there are artworks by Alonso Cano, Luca Giordano and el Greco. In fact, the painting by El Greco is not to be found in the chapel of the Sant\u00edsimo, it is situated in the main church but covered by wood and it is only on display on Saturdays from 11.30 am to noon.
