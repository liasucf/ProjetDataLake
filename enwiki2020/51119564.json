Ljubljana: Dr\u017eavna zalo\u017eba Slovenije, pp. 35, 36, 47. Jovsi is a flood-zone wetland of exceptional natural interest, distinguished by its great diversity of flora and fauna. About 80 species of birds nest here, which has provided ornithologists with the opportunity to collect extensive data. Certain important European species are regularly or intermittently found in Jovsi: the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), European roller (Coracias garrulus), black stork (Ciconia nigra), white stork (Ciconia ciconia), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), corn crake (Crex crex), and lesser grey shrike (Lanius minor). Because of its importance for nature conservation, the area is protected as a nature park. ==References== Category:Wetlands of Slovenia Category:Municipality of Bre\u017eice Category:Lower Sava Valley ",
