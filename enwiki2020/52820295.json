    "text": "Ma Maison was a restaurant opened by Patrick Terrail in the fall of 1973 at 8368 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, California. Backers included Gene Kelly. It is credited with getting Wolfgang Puck's career off the ground, for starting the trend called California cuisine but they called \"California nouvelle\" and being a hot spot for celebrities. Terrail arranged for many famous artists to paint the menu covers designed by David Hockney. (One menu was featured in an art exhibition at the Los Angeles Central Library). It closed on November 1, 1985. Their phone number was unlisted, supposedly because \"If you don't have the number, we don't want you.\" One source stated the \u201cfall from greatness\u201d began when sous chef John Sweeney strangled his actress girlfriend (Dominique Dunne) to death. Many believed Terrail supported Sweeney leading \u201cthe glamorous clientele\u201d to stop frequenting the restaurant. Besides being a hotspot for celebrities, they attracted \u201cbusinessmen and lawyers ... for what became known as Ma Maison's \"drunk lunches.\" Debauchery ensued, and conspicuous consumption to the highest degree was commonplace.\u201d ==Notable former employees== *Suzanne Goin *Gordon Hamersley *Mark Peel ==References== ==External links== *Closing of Ma Maison Restaurant End of an Era Category:Defunct restaurants in Greater Los Angeles Category:French restaurants Category:1973 establishments in California Category:1985 disestablishments in California ",
