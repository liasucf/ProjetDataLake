The unit was commanded by a former sergeant of the Polish Army, the self-proclaimed captain Danii\u0142 Trepli\u0144ski (\u00abBaszta\u00bb). == History == The unit was created after the arrest of the commander of the Home Army District of Polesie colonl Henryk Krajewski \u00abLe\u015bny\u00bb, in December 1944. The organizer of this unit was sergeant Danii\u0142 Trepli\u0144ski, who unauthorizedly appropriated the rank of captain. The unit was autonomous, not subordinate to any of the structures of the Home Army and the Polish Underground State. They fought against the establishment of Soviet in Polesie, ideologically they were supporters of Polish statehood until 1939. The very first action took place on 22 January 1945, when a squad of 200 partisans under the command of \u00abBaszta\u00bb attacked a temporary prison near the village of Zelenets and released the prisoners there and joining them to his unit. Among them was the criminal authority Aleksander Rusovski, who, subsequently, was one of the commanders of the unit. In June-September 1945, in the Brest region alone, 23 attacks were made on military units, 4 of them in the Brest region and 1 in Zhabinkovsky. In February-June 1945, 28 people were killed in the territory of the Brest District mainly activists of the Communist Party with their families, including their children. \u00abBaszta\u00bb conducted active recruitment into the unit and by June 1946 the number of detachments had grown to 500 partisans. Also, members of the squad committed acts of murder of residents of Ukrainian ethnicity and migrants from the Ukrainian SSR. In March 1946, the detachment of \u00abViktor\u00bb in the Zhabinka District got into a fight with the UPA unit of commandant \u00abSokil\u00bb. After this clash, on 11 March, a detachment of 30 partisans attacked the village of Saleiki and staged a pogrom against the Ukrainians, killing several people. In September 1946, at the entrance of a military operation in the Brest region, conducted by the MVD, serious damage was caused to the unit and the conspiratorial network. After that, the partisans no longer made attacks on large squads, however, they continued to attack small groups of Soviet militioners, liquidate individual officers of the Soviet special services and party activists.(In Russian) \u0412\u043e\u0438\u043d \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0438 \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0430. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, 2017 \u0433\u043e\u0434. There was also usual gangsterism, for example, shop robberies, for example, on 3-8 May 1949, the Rusovski squad robbed shops in Pokry, Skoldychi and Kholmichi, in the territory of the Brest Region. The last major action carried out by the unit took place on 12-14 March 1950, before the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, by blowing up electoral precincts in Thelmy, Cherni, Zaberezie and Zhabinka. In December 1949 Rusowski was liquidated, in December 1950 \u00abViktor\u00bb was liquidated. In January 1951, \u00abBaszta\u00bb dissolved the formation and gave \u00abSzary\u00bb the authority to organize the withdrawal of partisans to Poland. However, \u00abSzary\u00bb was liquidated in February, and on March 6 Treplinsky himself was eliminated along with his wife near the village Sherbin. On 20 March 4 former partisans from the detachment who tried to cross the border were detained on the Polish-Soviet border near the village of Kleiniki, and on 11 April, the last partisan Danii\u0142 Dubrowny was liquidated in the village of Cherni. == References == == External links == * (In Russian) \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u044c\u0435. \u0411\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430 \u201c\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u201d.
