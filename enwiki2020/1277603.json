It was originally known as the Mitsubishi Airtrek when it was introduced in Japan in 2001, and was based on the Mitsubishi ASX concept vehicle exhibited at the 2001 North American International Auto Show. It was sold at Mitsubishi Japan dealership chain called Car Plaza. The ASX (Active Sports Crossover) represented Mitsubishi's approach to the industry wide crossover SUV trend for retaining the all-season and off-road abilities offered by a high ground clearance and four-wheel drive, while still offering car-like levels of emissions, economy, and size.\"Mitsubishi Motors' ASX Concept at Detroit Show gives sneak peak at the next generation Global Multi- Activity Vehicle\", Mitsubishi-Motors.com press release, 10 January 2001 The original Airtrek name was chosen to \"describe the vehicle's ability to transport its passengers on adventure-packed journeys in a 'free-as-a-bird' manner\",Fact & Figures 2005 , p.33, Mitsubishi Motors website and was \"coined from Air and Trek to express the idea of footloose, adventure-filled motoring pleasure.\"\"MMC announces smart all-rounder AIRTREK model\", Mitsubishi- Motors.com press release, 20 June 2001 The Outlander nameplate which replaced it evoked a \"feeling of journeying to distant, unexplored lands in search of adventure.\" The second generation of the vehicle was introduced in 2006 and all markets including Japan adopted the Outlander name, although production of the older version continued in parallel. It was built on the company's GS platform, and used various engines developed by Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, and PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn. PSA's Citro\u00ebn C-Crosser and Peugeot 4007, which were manufactured by Mitsubishi in Japan, are badge engineered versions of the second generation Outlander.\"New Peugeot/Citroen off-roader\", Motoring.co.za, 30 October 2006 Global sales achieved the 1.5 million unit milestone in October 2016, 15 years after its market launch. As part of the third generation line-up, Mitsubishi launched in January 2013 a plug-in hybrid model called Outlander PHEV. Global sales passed the 250,000 unit milestone in May 2020, and according to JATO Dynamics, the Outlander PHEV is the world's all- time best selling plug-in hybrid since December 2018. , Europe is the leading market with over 126,000 units sold through January 2019, and the Outlander plug-in hybrid has listed as Europe's best-selling plug-in hybrid car for five years running, 2015 to 2019. == First generation (CU/ZE/ZF; 2001) == 2001 Mitsubishi Airtrek (JDM) 2003 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SE The Airtrek was first introduced to the Japanese market on 20 June 2001, priced from \u00a51.7\u20132.3 million. It offered a choice of either a 4G63 2.0 L or a 4G64 2.4 L GDI, mated to a standard INVECS-II 4-speed semi-automatic transmission. Both front- and four-wheel drive were available. The four-wheel drive version uses open differentials for the front and rear axles, with a viscous coupling unit for the center differential. A high performance model, called the Turbo R, was introduced in 2002 and used a detuned version of the Lancer Evolution's 4G63T 2.0 L I4 turbo.\"Mitsubishi Motors exhibits at 37 th Tokyo Motor Show\", Mitsubishi Motors press release, 15 October 2003 The engine produced and , although in export markets the Outlander version's output was reduced to and . The return of four-cylinder engines under 2.0 liters offered Japanese buyers a vehicle that was in compliance with Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, however, the exterior dimensions exceed Japanese regulations for the \"compact\" designation. The Outlander arrived in 2003 in North America, replacing the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, with a modified front grille and headlights which increased the overall length by approximately , and the two models were manufactured in parallel thereafter. It shared its platform with the Mitsubishi Grandis, also introduced in 2003. A version of the 4G64 powerplant was offered first, while a 4G69 2.4 L SOHC MIVEC I4 producing and , and the turbocharged 4G63T appeared in 2004. All had the option of front- or four-wheel drive. In several South American markets it was known as the Montero Outlander, to benefit from an association with the strong-selling Mitsubishi Montero Sport. == Second generation (CW/ZG/ZH; 2006) == On 17 October 2006, Mitsubishi launched the second generation model, dropping the Airtrek in Japan in favour of adopting the global name.\"Mitsubishi Motors launches all-new Outlander\", Mitsubishi-Motors.com press release, 17 October 2006 It features a new DOHC 2.4 L 16-valve MIVEC engine; INVECS-III continuously variable transmission (CVT), Mitsubishi's AWC system which features electronically controlled four wheel drive and stability control, on a stretched Mitsubishi GS platform. The North American version, powered by a newly designed 6B31 3.0 L V6 SOHC MIVEC was shown in April 2006 at the New York Auto Show prior to its release in October the same year. Due to the availability of a V6 engine, Mitsubishi returned to offering a shorter version of this vehicle, and reintroduced the Mitsubishi RVR on 17 February 2010. The usage of a four-cylinder engine under 2.0 liters offers Japanese buyers a vehicle that was in compliance with Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, which has tax advantages, giving buyers the ability to purchase a vehicle capable of seating seven people without paying the tax penalty of a larger engine. Second facelift Mitsubishi Outlander GT (US) Interior The Outlander, which features Mitsubishi's RISE safety body, received a four star rating from the Euro NCAP car safety performance assessment programme. One of its unique features is something Mitsubishi calls a \"Flap-Fold Tailgate\"; it is a two-piece tailgate integrated into the rear bumper that folds down for easy loading, while serving as a bench when the tailgate is open, able to accommodate up to Mitsubishi Sales Brochure printed January 2011 In its home market of Japan it was the best- selling SUV from October 2006 to March 2007,\"New Mitsubishi Outlander Japan's Best Selling SUV\", WorldCarFans.com, 21 April 2006 while in the U.S. market it achieved 1,694 and 2,108 sales in November and December 2006, the first two full months it was available;\"All-New Outlander Leads Mitsubishi To November Sales Increase\", Mitsubishi Motors North America press release, 1 December 2006\"December Auto Sales: Mitsubishi\", Associated Press/BusinessWeek, 3 January 2007 Mitsubishi hoped for at least 4,000 sales per month in the United States,\"New products need to be hits for Mitsubishi to stay in U.S. market\", Kathy Jackson, Automotive News, 30 May 2006 and after the cancellation of the Mitsubishi Grandis in model year 2011, the Outlander was Mitsubishi's only MPV capable of carrying seven passengers with all wheel drive. In Chile, where both generations were on sale simultaneously, the new model was badged Outlander K2. Increased demand for the new Mitsubishi Lancer, and the consequent effects on the capacity of the company's Mizushima production facility, have obliged Mitsubishi to reassess production of the Outlander. In September 2007, they announced that from 2008, production of European market Outlanders would be transferred from Nagoya to its NedCar plant in the Netherlands, while the Citro\u00ebn C-Crosser and Peugeot 4007 would have their production transferred from Mizushima to Nagoya.\"Mitsubishi Motors transfers Outlander production for Europe\", Mitsubishi Motors press release, 18 September 2007 The model was facelifted for the 2008 model year, although the 2007 grille carried over in the United States and Canada for 2008-09 until another facelift in the 2010 model year. At the 2007 SEMA Show in Las Vegas, the company displayed a Mitsubishi Evolander (now known as Mitsubishi Outlander Ralliart) concept, powered by a supercharged version of the vehicle's 6B31 V6 engine and equipped with suitably uprated suspension, brakes, wheels/tires, body kit and interior.\"Mitsubishi Evolander\", Josh Jacquot, Inside Line: 2006 SEMA Show, Edmunds.com A second show car, an Outlander GT Prototype with a front grille based on the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, was exhibited at the 2009 New York International Auto Show,New York: Mitsubishi Outlander GT Prototype gets a EVOplasty snarl, Autoblog, 8 April 2009 and formed the basis of the facelifted model introduced in late 2009.\"New Mitsubishi Outlander Reveals Aggressive Styling And Upgraded Features\", Voxy.co.nz, 10 November 2009 Along with a major facelift for the 2010 model year, the top end Outlander XLS (GT in the US) introduced a new colour multi-function display and the Mitsubishi S-AWC AWD system.

Two 60 kW electric motors independently power the front and rear wheels, while the gasoline-powered engine can be used as a generator for the motors, and/or power the vehicle directly. Located on the left side of the engine (positioned transaxle-style), the front motor is a smaller, lighter, and higher output version of the permanent magnet synchronous electric motor used in the i-MiEV. The Outlander PHEV has a 12 kWh lithium-ion battery pack capable of delivering an all-electric range of under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the Japanese JC08 test the all-electric range is , with a top speed of . The battery pack is located in a dust- and waterproof encasement positioned beneath the passenger compartment subfloor and between the front and rear axles, with no intrusion into the passenger compartment. It consists of 80 cells configured in series. Mitsubishi's target was to achieve a combined fuel economy for Japan in \"EV Drive\" mode of 67 km/l equivalent, or equivalent to about 157 miles per U.S. gallon (MPGe). Fuel economy in hybrid mode for Japan is . Regular (left) and CHAdeMO quick charging (right) sockets The plug-in hybrid comes equipped with two charging sockets, regular and quick charging CHAdeMO. When charging at home the driver can choose between a standard 3-pin plug socket or via a dedicated EV charging point. The vehicle comes with a charging cable for connection to a standard plug socket. From a standard plug, charging from empty to full charge takes about five hours. From a dedicated charging point at home or at a public charging point, it takes about 3.5 hours for a full charge. The DC rapid charging socket can be used at CHAdeMO charging stations. Rapid charging allows for an 80% charge in approximately 25 minutes. The 2019 model Outlander has a 13.8 kWh battery, which increases the range to and the top speed to .Mitsubishi Motors employs higher-capacity battery for PHEV - Hideyoshi Kume, Nikkei xTech/Nikkei Automotive, 2 November 2018 ;Driving modes The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV features three driving modes: \"EV Drive\", \"Series Hybrid\", and \"Parallel Hybrid\". The drivetrain automatically selects one of three drivetrain modes for optimal performance and efficiency. In \"EV Drive\" mode the vehicle is driven in an eco-friendly performance mode by the two electric motors, with energy being supplied exclusively by the lithium-ion battery pack, and becomes a 100% electric-powered zero-emission vehicle. In Series or Parallel drive modes, the generator produces electricity from the engine and stores it in the battery pack. Plug-in Hybrid EV badge The engine is fitted with what Mitsubishi calls Innovative Valve timing Electronic Control (MIVEC), which claims to maximize power production, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce exhaust emissions. The system works by continuously varying the timing of the intake valves, according to engine speed, when operating in \"Parallel Hybrid\" mode. The engine functions solely to generate electricity in \"Series Hybrid\" mode and is mainly used to provide motive force in \"Parallel Hybrid\" mode. The drivetrain switches to \"Series Hybrid\" when the energy level remaining in the battery pack is low or when the need arises for additional acceleration. In this mode the two electric motors are powered by the battery pack and the gasoline-powered generator. The vehicle can also switch to parallel hybrid mode. In this drive mode, the plug-in hybrid uses its full complement of available resources: the gasoline engine, the two electric motors and gasoline-powered engine generator. The \"Parallel Hybrid\" mode is the most commonly utilized when driving in a long-haul/high-speed steady-state cruise manner, such as on the open road or freeway. This is the most efficient drivetrain mode under these types of driving circumstances. ;Variable regenerative braking Regenerative braking paddle The Outlander PHEV features regenerative braking during normal deceleration (braking or coasting), with the front and rear electric motors working as generators so that electricity can be generated and fed back into the main battery pack. In addition, the plug-in hybrid has a set-up that allows the driver to control the strength of the engine braking with paddles behind the steering wheel. The driver switches on regenerative braking either by sliding the central selector to the \"B\" position, or by operating the paddles. Variable regenerative braking is achieved by tapping the paddles, the strength of the regenerative braking system could be stepped through six different settings\u2014B0 to B5\u2014allowing the driver to adjust how much power is restored into the battery, and to balance the amount of braking carried out with the amount of momentum the driver wants to maintain. For example, down a long but shallow slope it is better to keep rolling with a small level of recuperation, while down a steep hill, the driver can set the system to maximum regeneration. At its most aggressive setting, the regen system would easily hold the Outlander at down a moderate downhill slope. With minimum regen, the car would conserve momentum and coast without any power draw. ;Driver-activated modes The Outlander PHEV features three driver-activated modes: * ECO Mode: in this mode the vehicle reduces both fuel and electricity usage for increased efficiency simply with the touch of the button. * Battery Save Mode: In this driver-activated mode, the vehicle automatically conserves the energy within the drive battery pack by operating the vehicle in hybrid mode, running the engine when necessary to maintain the state of charge at around the same level as when the Save button was pressed. The \"Battery Save Mode\" will only operate once the battery pack's energy level falls below 90% full. For example, this mode would allow the vehicle to be driven in urban traffic with the engine/generator on to maintain a higher level of battery charge; it could then be deactivated, allowing the vehicle to be driven through a neighborhood silently at an appropriate speed in EV Drive Mode. * Battery Charge Mode: when activating, whether the vehicle is in motion or at a standstill, the engine will generate electricity to be fed into the battery pack, forcing the vehicle to operate in hybrid mode. For example, if the engine is idling and the vehicle is not moving, selecting this mode will replenish a low energy level within the battery pack back up to 80% fully charged in approximately 40 minutes. ;Features of the plug-in hybrid EV File:Mitsu Outlander PHEV 02 2016 BSB 5190.JPG|Screen showing driving mode (Normal or Eco) and range available: EV (battery only) and hybrid.

Retail prices vary from () to (). The engine displacement of the largest version was kept below 2.5 litres so as to avoid having Japanese buyers having to pay more annual road tax which would affect sales. The European version was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The European version is similar to the Japanese model except for minor adjustments to comply with EU requirements, and Mitsubishi expected an emission rating of 44 g/km.

The introduction in the United States was initially scheduled for January 2014, but was delayed. Due to California's regulations that require a battery-monitoring unit (BMU), Mitsubishi delayed the market launch in the US for the last quarter of 2015. The BMU conducts onboard diagnosis of the Outlander's lithium ion battery capacity and output, and it alerts the driver to possible degradation, which might affect the vehicle's emissions. In January 2015 it was rescheduled again. Mitsubishi introduced a redesigned version as model year 2017. The latest delays were due to production constraints of the lithium-ion battery pack which could not keep up with worldwide demand. U.S. deliveries were scheduled to begin by August 2016, however, in July 2016, the release in the American market was postponed one more time, being rescheduled to mid-2017. , the Outlander plug-in hybrid was available for retail sales in 50 countries.

Nobody was injured in the incident. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for battery problems. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall but halted production and sales until it determined the cause of the battery problems. The carmaker advised the 4,000 owners of the Outlander plug- in hybrid to drive only on gasoline mode for the time being. On 19 August 2013, after changing a production process to avoid damaging any batteries, Mitsubishi restarted production of the Outlander plug-in hybrid. == Production and sales == Global Outlander sales achieved the 1.5 million unit milestone in October 2016, 15 years after its market launch. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=2 style=\"width:6em\" | Year ! colspan=2 | Production ! colspan=4 | Sales ! colspan=\"2\" |Total (Year) |- ! style=\"width:8em\" | Airtrek ! style=\"width:8em\" | Outlander ! style=\"width:8em\" | Airtrek (Japan) ! style=\"width:8em\" | Airtrek (export) ! style=\"width:8em\" | Outlander (Japan) ! style=\"width:8em\" | Outlander (export) !Produced !Sold |- | 2001 | 21,245 | - | 19,160 | 601 | - | - |21,245 |19,761 |- | 2002 | 68,431 | - | 14,132 | 45,845 | - | - |68,431 |59,977 |- | 2003 | 77,331 | 60,512+ | 7,427 | 7,917 | N/A | 60,512 |137,843+ |75,856+ |- | 2004 | 60,817 | 56,997+ | 3,198 | 320 | N/A | 56,997 |117,814+ |60,515+ |- | 2005 | 49,596 | 21,173 | 1,030 | 302 | 18,919 | 48,822 |70,769 |69,073 |- | 2006 | 31,326 | 81,883 | 10 | 248 | 16,734 | 91,693 |113,209 |108,685 |- | 2007 | 10,857+ | 170,084 | N/A | N/A | 11,194 | 157,292 |180,941+ |168486+ |- | 2008 | 5,714+ | 129,383 | N/A | N/A | 6,531 | 115,849 |135,097+ |122,380+ |- | 2009 | - | 98,718 | - | - | 7,638 | 89,919 |98,718 |97,557 |- | 2010 | - | 124,345 | - | - | 6,852 | 116,672 |124,345 |123,524 |- | 2011 | - | 96,261 | - | - | 4,249 | 93,828 |96,261 |98,077 |- | 2012 | - | 105,995 | - | - | 8,439 | 95,305 |105,995 |103,744 |- |2013 | - |N/A | - | - |9,608+ |8,197+ |N/A |17,805+ |- |2014 | - |N/A | - | - |10,064+ |21,072+ |N/A |31,136+ |- |2015 | - |N/A | - | - |N/A |N/A |N/A |N/A |- |Total (separate) |264,500+ |1,000,599+ |44,957+ |55,233+ |93,376+ |956,158+ |1,382,608+ |1,149,724+ |- |Total (Combined) | colspan=\"2\" |1,382,608+ | colspan=\"4\" |1,149,724+ | colspan=\"2\" |232,884+ (not sold) |} (sources: Facts & Figures 2005, Facts & Figures 2009, Facts & Figures 2013, Mitsubishi Motors website) == References == == External links == * (Japan) * (Japan; PHEV) * (United States) * (United States; PHEV) * (Indonesia; PHEV) * 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander US-Version * Outlander official page (Japanese) Outlander Category:Compact sport utility vehicles Category:Crossover sport utility vehicles Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Mid-size sport utility vehicles Category:2010s cars Category:Cars introduced in 2001 Category:Plug-in hybrid vehicles Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission Category:Partial zero- emissions vehicles Category:VDL Nedcar vehicles ",
