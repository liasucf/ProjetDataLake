The park is adjacent to the present day ghost town of Winehaven. ==History== The Beach Park - originally part of the Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot - was leased to the City of Richmond in the early 1970s for $1.00/month and developed by the Navy as a gesture of goodwill to local residents and to provide recreation for the Navy and their families stationed at Pt. Molate. Subsequent budget concerns and cleanup needs led to a complete closure of the park in 2001. The park reopened in April 2014 after another round of cleanup.Point Molate Beach, Citizens for a Sustainable Pt.
