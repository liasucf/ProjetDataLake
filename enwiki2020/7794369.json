    "text": "The Michigan Competing Band Association (MCBA) is a sanctioning body for high school marching band field contests in the state of Michigan, established in 1974. Not only does it host a great number of local competitions around the state, MCBA holds the only statewide marching band championships in Michigan. Previous championships were held at the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Varsity Stadium in Canton, Michigan, Rynearson Stadium at Eastern Michigan University, and at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. They are currently held at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. Prior to the 1992-93 school year, MCBA was known as the Michigan Competing Band Director's Association, or MCBDA. ==Classification and scoring== Bands are separated into \"Flights\" by the number of students enrolled in the high school itself (based on MHSAA second semester totals) and are not a measurement of band or program size. This has been in place since the 1992-93 school year. In late July of 2020, the MCBA announced the cancelation of the 2020 Marching Competitive Season. The flights for the 2019 season are as follows: *Flight I: Higher - 1632 *Flight II: 1631 - 1210 *Flight III: 1209 - 978 *Flight IV: 977 - 672 *Flight V: 671 - Lower Bands are judged completely separately in their respective flights. Bands are given a score, placement, as well as caption awards for \"Outstanding Music Performance\", \"Outstanding Visual Performance\", and \"Outstanding General Effect\" in their respective flights. The judging system is as follows: Field *Visual Field Judge Able to move around the field *Music Field Judge Able to move around the field Each judge awards a maximum of 12.5 points, for a maximum total of 25 points. Ensemble *Visual Ensemble Judge Judges from press box or high vantage point in the stands *Music Ensemble Judge Judges from press box or high vantage point in the stands Each judge awards a maximum of 15 points, for a maximum total of 30 points. General Effect *General Effect Music Judge 1 *General Effect Music Judge 2 *General Effect Visual Judge All G.E. judges view from the press box. Each General Effect judge awards a maximum of 15 points, for a maximum total of 45 points The scoring for each band is as follows: MCBA currently utilizes the Bands of America judging system in combination with several MCBA constructed judging sheets and criteria. Seven adjudicators are utilized in the scoring system: *General Effect Music Judge 1 15 pts *General Effect Music Judge 2 15 pts *General Effect Visual Judge 15 pts *Music Field Judge 12.5 pts *Music Ensemble Judge 15 pts *Visual Field Judge 12.5 pts *Visual Ensemble Judge 15 pts Total possible = 100 pts ==Previous champions== 2017 Flight I: Rockford High School Marching Band Rockford, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Stevensville-Lakeshore Marching Band Stevensville, MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2016 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths- Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Stevensville- Lakeshore Marching Band Stevensville, MI Flight IV: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI 2015 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Stevensville-Lakeshore Marching Band Stevensville, MI Flight IV: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI 2014 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Byron Center High School Marching Band Byron Center, MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2013 Flight I: Walled Lake Central High School Marching Band Walled Lake, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2012 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight IV: Newaygo High School Marching Band Newaygo, MI 2011 Flight I: Walled Lake Central High School Marching Band Walled Lake, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching band Ferndale MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2010 Flight I: Walled Lake Central High School Marching Band Walled Lake, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI Flight IV: Newaygo High School Marching Band, Newaygo, MI 2009 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2008 Flight I: West Bloomfield High School Marching Band West Bloomfield, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Lakeshore High School Marching Band Stevensville, MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2007 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths- Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI Flight IV: Columbia Central High School Marching Band Brooklyn, MI 2006 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI Flight IV: Durand Area High School Marching Band Durand, MI 2005 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Reeths-Puffer High School Marching Band Muskegon, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI Flight IV: Durand Area High School Marching Band Durand, MI 2004 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Ferndale High School Marching Band Ferndale, MI Flight IV: Godwin Heights High School Marching Band Wyoming, MI 2003 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Mona Shores High School Marching Band Norton Shores, MI Flight III: Lakeshore High School Marching Band Stevensville, MI Flight IV: Durand Area High School Marching Band Durand, MI 2002 Flight I: Plymouth- Canton Educational Park Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Lakeshore High School Marching Band Stevensville, MI Flight IV: Durand Area High School Marching Band Durand, MI 2001 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Jenison High School Marching Band Jenison, MI Flight III: Harrison High School Marching Band Farmington Hills, MI Flight IV: Durand Area High School Marching Band Durand, MI 2000 Flight I: Plymouth-Canton Educational Park Marching Band Canton, MI Flight II: Mona Shores High School Marching Band Norton Shores, MI Flight III: Mt.
