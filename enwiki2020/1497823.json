    "text": "Serra da Capivara National Park (Portuguese: Parque Nacional Serra da Capivara, , locally ) is a national park in the Northeastern region of Brazil. The area has many prehistoric paintings. This area has the largest and the oldest concentration of prehistoric sites in the Americas. Scientific studies confirm that the Capivara mountain range was densely populated in the pre- Columbian Era. ==Location== It is located in northeast state of Piau\u00ed, between latitudes 8\u00b0 26' 50\" and 8\u00b0 54' 23\" south and longitudes 42\u00b0 19' 47\" and 42\u00b0 45' 51\" west. It falls within the municipal areas of S\u00e3o Raimundo Nonato, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o do Piau\u00ed, Coronel Jos\u00e9 Dias and Canto do Buriti. It has an area of 1291.4 square kilometres (319,000 acres). The Capivara-Confus\u00f5es Ecological Corridor, created in 2006, links the park to the Serra das Confus\u00f5es National Park. ==History== Pedra Furada The park was created to protect the prehistoric artifacts and paintings found there. It became a World Heritage Site in 1991. Its head archaeologist is Ni\u00e8de Guidon. Its best known archaeological site is Pedra Furada. Scientific studies confirm that the Capivara mountain range was densely populated in the pre-Columbian Era. A newer site is Toca da Tira Peia, where the stone tools found may date to as early as 22,000 years ago. The site has been dated through optically stimulated luminescence. Other important archaeological sites in the area are Toca da Pena, Baxao da Esperanca, and Sitio do Meio. Lapa do Boquete site is located directly south.German Dziebel, THE TOCA DA TIRA PEIA SITE AND THE END OF AN ICE AGE IN AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY. Anthropogenesis, April 24, 2013 (see map) ===S\u00edtio do Meio=== S\u00edtio do Meio is the second most important rock shelter in the area after Pedra Furada. It features fully Pleistocene dates and artefacts. The stone artefacts are better preserved because of the absence of waterfalls here. At least 98 stone tools seem older than 12,500 BP. They belong to the Upper Pleistocenic phase of Pedra Furada 3.AIMOLA, Giulia et al.
