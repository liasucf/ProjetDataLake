Since Britain is Ireland's main trading partner, Brexit will have a huge impact on Ireland's agri-food sector. Britain was the market for 270,000 tonnes of Irish beef export. The tariff rates will \"virtually wipe out\" agri-food trade to Britain, according to the Irish Farmers' Association president Joe Healy. ==History== The Department of Agriculture was created as a department of the Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at one of the first meetings of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in 1919 with Robert Barton as the first Minister for Agriculture, Horace Plunkett as the department's first Vice-President, and T. P. Gill as its first Secretary. In 1899, Plunkett had established the Department's forerunner, called the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction (DATI).
