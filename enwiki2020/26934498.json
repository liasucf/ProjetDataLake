    "text": "{| |} The Yellowstone class was a class of four destroyer tenders in service with the United States Navy from 1980 to 1996. ==History== The Yellowstone class was a repetition of the preceding , so that sometimes all ships are put in one class.Stefan Terzibatschitsch: Seemacht USA, Volume 2, Bechterm\u00fcnz Verlag, Augsburg (Germany), 1997, pp. 652\u2013655. All ships were commissioned in 1980 to 1983 to replace the ageing . However, the end of the Cold War in 1990 led to the retirement of the Yellowstone class after only 13 to 16 years of service. After spending about another 15 years in the Reserve Fleet, three ships were scrapped and one was sunk as a target. ==Ships== {| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" |----- bgcolor=#006699 | Name | Number | Builder | Launched | Commissioned | Decommissioned | Status | NVR |- | | AD-41 |National Steel and Shipbuilding Company |27 January 1979 |28 June 1980 |31 January 1996 |Sold for scrap 17 December 2014 | |- | | AD-42 |National Steel and Shipbuilding Company |28 July 1979 |6 June 1981 |16 December 1994 |Sunk as target 20 September 2010 | |- | | AD-43 |National Steel and Shipbuilding Company |2 August 1980 |17 April 1982 |29 September 1995 |Sold for scrap 16 February 2012 | |- | | AD-44 |National Steel and Shipbuilding Company |6 February 1982 |15 August 1983 |3 September 1996 |Sold for scrap 20 November 2014 | |- | | AD-45 | | | | |Planned, never builtPaul Silverstone, The Navy of the Nuclear Age, 1947-2007 | |} ==References== Category:Ships built in San Diego Category:Auxiliary depot ship classes ",
