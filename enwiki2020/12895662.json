    "text": "Brand aversion is an antonym of brand loyalty. It is a distrust or a dislike of products from a particular brand on the basis of past experiences with that brand and its products, similar to taste aversion. Brand aversion can be the effect of obtrusive marketing strategies, bad press, a mass product recall, or other poor product launches. Psychologically, the reasons for brand aversion have been explained by the attachment-aversion model using the same three dimensions (\"3 Es\") that characterize a product: #enticing/annoying the self #enabling/disabling the self and #enriching/impoverishing the self (benefits/liabilities). The more annoying/disabling/impoverishing a brand \"feels\", the more aversion will be produced and vice versa. As is the case with all brands, the conceived qualities need neither correspond to real assets nor shortcomings. ==See also== * Brand architecture * Brand equity * Brand management * * Customer engagement * Employer branding * Evangelism marketing * Semiotics and globalization == References == Category:Branding terminology Category:Behaviorism Category:Brand management ",
