    "text": "Frederick William Fisher (11 April 1910 \u2013 26 July 1944) was an English professional football forward who played in the Football League for Barnsley, Chesterfield and Millwall. He won a wartime international cap for England in a 4\u20131 victory over Wales on 16 April 1941. == Military service and death == Fisher was married and served as an air gunner with the rank of sergeant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War. On 25 July 1944, Fisher took off from RAF Kirmington in an Avro Lancaster piloted by Flying Officer Bernard Singleton to conduct a raid on Stuttgart, along with another 412 Lancasters and 138 Hailfaxes. Over Yonne, German-occupied France, Fisher's Lancaster was intercepted by a German Junkers Ju 88 night fighter, and it was shot down over Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye. The night fighter pilot is thought to have been Oberleutnant Herbert Schulte zur Surlage, who was forced to bail out of his Ju 88 after taking return fire from Fisher's Lancaster. All seven on board, including Fisher, were killed when the plane crashed near Taingy. He was buried in Taingy Communal Cemetery. == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Chesterfield |1937\u201338 | rowspan=\"2\" |Second Division |13 |1 |0 |0 |13 |1 |- |1938\u201339 |3 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |3 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !16 !1 !0 !0 !16 !1 |- |Millwall |1938\u201339 |Second Division |12 |6 |1 |0 |13 |6 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !28 !7 !1 !0 !29 !7 |} ==References== Category:English footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Association football forwards Category:1910 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Footballers from Barnsley Category:Association football outside forwards Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Monckton Athletic F.C. players Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:England wartime international footballers Category:Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II Category:British military personnel killed in World War II ",
