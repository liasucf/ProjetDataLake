It was launched at the Cavendish Arms in Stockwell, London on 23 November 2014. ==Reception== Reviewing Country Girl for Uncut magazine, Mick Houghton gave it 8 of 10, describing it as \"another delightful batch of tunes\" and adding: \"The title track sets the tone, a jaunty, bass-driven, tongue-in-cheek look at city life, 'Ruby' is sung to her daughter and would have fitted snugly on any Carpenters\u2019 album.\" The title track was played on BBC Radio 2 by Janice Long and by Robert Elms on his BBC London 94.9 radio show. Jamie Cullum played the song \"Light\" on his BBC Radio 2 programme on 3 March 2015, saying \"a great singer who I love very much... a real great listen from start to finish... this great, great album\".
