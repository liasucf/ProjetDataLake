Due to its migration patterns and place in the American West, Montana has a heritage of pioneer folk music and cowboy songs and poetry. The state also has a tradition of baroque, classical, and romantic era music: two prominent musical institutions, both classical, are the Great Falls Symphony Orchestra, which was established in 1958, and the Bozeman Symphony Orchestra, which was established in 1963. The Helena Symphony was founded in 1955 and is known to be one of the premier symphonies of Montana and the Northwest. Montana has two official state songs: \"Montana\" and \"Montana Melody.\" ==Native American music== Montana is home to several Indian reservations and traditionally to more than two dozen distinct tribes, each with their own forms of music. These include the Blackfeet, Crow, Flathead, Cheyenne, Chippewa-Cree, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, and Sioux.
