    "text": "History of A Cuban Struggle Against the Demons History of a Cuban Struggle Against The Demons ( Historia de una pelea cubana contra los demonios in Spanish) is a book written by ethnlogist Fernando Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez, published in 1959 by the university of Santa Clara city: Universidad Central de Las Villas. In this voluminous essay, the author explores the colonial history of the town of Remedios. Fr. Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez de la Cruz, a priest, alarms the people of the town with news that Lucifer, the prince of darkness, commands an army of demons against them. He proposes that they move the settlement to another place in his own lands. These events took place near the end of the seventeenth century, when the interior towns of the Cuban island were largely ignored by the Spanish Monarchy and colonial government. Like the people of Trinidad and Sancti Sp\u00edrirus, those in Remedios suffered incursions and frequent raids by pirates and cosairs, who were mostly devoted to smuggling. Many of the people of Remedios feared them and sided with the priest's suggestion to move. In the end, a part of the people of Remedios left to hatos de cupey a nearby region, where they developed what is known as the city of Santa Clara. In the 21st century, it is the capital of the Villa Clara province. == Movie adaptation == Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Miguel Barnet adapted the book and wrote the screenplay for a Spanish-language film, which Gutierrez Alea directed.
