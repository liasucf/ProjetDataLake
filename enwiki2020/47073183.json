    "text": "The Beast in the East was a professional wrestling event produced by WWE, an American-based promotion, that aired live on the WWE Network. It took place on July 4, 2015, at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan. It aired live internationally on the WWE Network and live on J Sports in Japan. The replays of the event aired on J Sports 4 in Japan. Additionally, it would be available on demand on both the WWE Network and J Sports. To date, the show is the only time in WWE's history that an event was broadcast live from Japan. It was available to subscribers of the WWE Network, in over 140 countries. Seven matches were contested at the event, with two of the matches shown exclusively on J Sports. The main event saw John Cena and Dolph Ziggler defeat Kane and King Barrett. In other matches, Chris Jericho wrestled his first televised match since Night of Champions, defeating Neville, Finn B\u00e1lor defeated Kevin Owens to win the NXT Championship, and Brock Lesnar defeated Kofi Kingston. == Storylines == The card consisted of five matches, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers. Storylines played out on WWE's primary television programs, Raw, SmackDown and NXT. On May 28, 2015, it was revealed that Brock Lesnar was scheduled to appear at the July 4 live event in Japan. This would mark Lesnar's first non-PPV match for WWE since 2004. Lesnar reportedly requested a spot on the show so he and Brad Rheingans could go to Tokyo to visit Masa Saito, who was in bad health. WWE then released a promotional video announcing that the show would no longer be a house show, and would be broadcast live on the WWE Network. One day later, WWE revealed the entire match card for the show. One of the matches scheduled for the event, The New Day vs. Tyson Kidd and Cesaro, could no longer take place due to Tyson Kidd suffering an injury, which was expected to take him out for over a year. Kidd & Cesaro were replaced by The Lucha Dragons. Kevin Owens defended his NXT Championship against Finn B\u00e1lor at the event. At NXT TakeOver: Rival in February 2015, Owens had captured the NXT Championship while B\u00e1lor won a tournament to become number one contender. On the March 25 episode of NXT, Owens prevailed over B\u00e1lor, who had dispensed with his 'Demon' facepaint, saying that he didn't need the 'Demon' to beat the champion; in the match Owens took advantage of a (kayfabe) leg injury. However, B\u00e1lor earned another title shot at NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable in May when he beat Tyler Breeze. B\u00e1lor vowed that at Beast in the East Owens would 'meet the Demon'. Hideo Itami and Tatsumi Fujinami were also advertised to appear. == Event == {| class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\" |+Other on-screen personnel |- !Role !Name |- |rowspan=2|Commentators |Byron Saxton |- |Michael Cole |- |rowspan=1|Ring announcer |Eden Stiles |} ===Preliminary matches=== Dark matches were held, where Cesaro defeated Diego by submission and The Lucha Dragons (Kalisto and Sin Cara) defeated The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods). The first match was Chris Jericho facing Neville. Neville kicked out of a mid-air Codebreaker. However, after Jericho countered a Red Arrow attempt, Jericho forced Neville to submit to the Liontamer for the victory. Next, Nikki Bella defended the Divas Championship against Tamina and Paige. In the middle of the match, Paige executed the Rampaige on Nikki, only to get a near-fall. Tamina superkicked Paige, which was the last of Paige for the match. Nikki pinned Tamina after a forearm smash for the victory to retain the title. After that, Brock Lesnar faced Kofi Kingston. Lesnar dominated though being dropkicked to the turnbuckles twice, but it didn't stop him from executing three German suplexes. In the end, Lesnar pinned Kingston after a F-5 for the victory. After the match, Lesnar would deliver more German suplexes and another F-5 on Kingston. Big E and Xavier Woods appeared, but Lesnar ultimately executed F5s on both Big E and Woods. Finn B\u00e1lor celebrating his victory after defeating Kevin Owens for the NXT Championship. In the fourth match, Kevin Owens defended the NXT Championship against Finn B\u00e1lor. Owens mocked John Cena, with whom he had a running feud, with Cena's trademark shoulder tackles, spin-out powerbomb, and Five Knuckle Shuffle. However, Owens became one of the very few people to kick out of the Coup de Gr\u00e2ce. Balor pinned Owens after a second Coup de Gr\u00e2ce for the victory to win the title. ===Main event=== The main event was WWE United States Champion John Cena and Dolph Ziggler facing Kane and King Barrett. Barrett and Kane pretty much dominated throughout the match. In the end, Ziggler performed a superkick on Barrett and Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Kane for the pin. ==Reception== The Beast in the East received generally positive reviews from critics. The Owens-B\u00e1lor match was highly praised. PWInsider.com's Mike Johnson called it \"a great main event level\" match. PWTorch.com's James Caldwell gave the match a four-and-a-half-star rating, the highest rating of the night. 411Mania.com's Larry Csonka praised the look of the show, saying it was far away from \"the usual and sanitized WWE TV event\". == Results == == Aftermath == At the 2015's San Diego Comic-Con International on July 9, a B\u00e1lor-Owens rematch for the NXT Championship was scheduled for the next NXT TakeOver show in August 2015. Owens later requested for the stipulation of a ladder match, saying that he did not want to suffer NXT General Manager William Regal costing him the title in a situation alike the Montreal Screwjob. Though B\u00e1lor never had competed in a ladder match before, he accepted the stipulation and defeated Owens. ==Footnotes== == References == Category:2015 WWE Network events Category:2015 in Japan Category:Events in Tokyo Category:Professional wrestling in Tokyo Beast ",
