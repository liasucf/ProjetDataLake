    "text": "NOS Audiovisuais (formerly ZON Lusomundo) is a Portuguese integrated media corporation founded in 1953, which has major interests in movie distribution, cinema theaters and media assets. It was founded with the purpose of movie distribution, and had a very close relation with the biggest studios (it is currently the Portuguese licensee of United International Pictures, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Warner Home Video, Miramax Films and DreamWorks SKG). In the 1980s Lusomundo started acquiring newspapers, including Com\u00e9rcio do Porto, Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias and Jornal de Not\u00edcias. In the early 1990s, it acquired TSF R\u00e1dio Not\u00edcias and minority stakes of TVI. In 2000, PT Multim\u00e9dia made a successful takeover of Lusomundo. Since then, Lusomundo was split into two companies with different owners: *Lusomundo Audiovisuais, which controls the cinema and movie distribution assets *Lusomundo Media (now owned by Global Media Group), which controls other media assets Until 2007, the Lusomundo brand was used on four premium subscription television movie channels. Nowadays these channels are named TVCine. In 2007, PT Multimedia separated from PT Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es and became ZON Multim\u00e9dia and this corporation was renamed ZON Lusomundo, in May 2014 it was renamed NOS, officially retiring the 61-year-old Lusomundo name. ==External links== * Category:Mass media companies of Portugal Category:Cinema chains in Portugal ",
