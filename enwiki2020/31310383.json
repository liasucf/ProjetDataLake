    "text": "Intermediates and enzymes in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism The Leloir pathway is a metabolic pathway for the catabolism of D-galactose. It is named after Luis Federico Leloir. In the first step, galactose mutarotase facilitates the conversion of \u03b2-D-galactose to \u03b1-D-galactose since this is the active form in the pathway. Next, \u03b1-D-galactose is phosphorylated by galactokinase to galactose 1-phosphate. In the third step, D-galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase converts galactose 1-phosphate to UDP-galactose using UDP-glucose as the uridine diphosphate source. Finally, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase recycles the UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose for the transferase reaction. Additionally, phosphoglucomutase converts the D-glucose 1-phosphate to D-glucose 6-phosphate. ==References== Category:Metabolism Category:Galactose ",
