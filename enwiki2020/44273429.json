    "text": "Secrets of Life is a 1956 American documentary film written and directed by James Algar. The documentary follows the changing world of nature, the sky, the sea, the sun, planets, insects and volcanic action. The documentary was released on November 6, 1956, by Buena Vista Distribution. ==Plot== The fourth in Walt Disney's True-Life Adventure series, the 1956 film Secrets of Life features previously rarely-seen film footage of nature's \"behind-the-scenes\" goings-on that play a huge role in making the planet what it is. From bees to ants and the flora and fauna surrounding us, Secrets of Life reveal a sometimes startling glimpse into nature's wonders that we often take for granted. Accompanied by remarkably appropriate musical selections, viewers find themselves mesmerized by the metamorphosis of air-borne seeds into glorious plants and flowers with the help of time-lapse photography. Bees are seen as they go about the non-stop business of pollination, giving adage to the saying \"busy as a bee.\" Ants are shown in their various classifications, from workers to warriors to the regal \"queen.\" Countless protozoa are viewed in a single drop of water as the voice-over describes their role in the \"big picture\" of unseen nature. The close-ups provide an intimacy which gives these oft-neglected organisms a \"face.\" The folks at Disney once again bring subjects to life that heretofore were neglected. ==Awards== * 1957 Berlin Film Festival: Golden Bear (Best Documentary) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1956 films Category:Disney documentary films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:American documentary films Category:1956 documentary films Category:Films directed by James Algar Category:Documentary films about nature Category:Films produced by Ben Sharpsteen ",
