In 2019 and 2020 the campaign has received funding from Climate Justice Resilience FundClimate Justice Resilience Fund which will be used to strengthen and expand the work of building climate resilient communities in East Africa. This involves building earth dams and irrigation projects as well as the community screenings with farmers. We aim to use the film as a tool to create an arena where farmers, NGOs and local decision makers can meet to identify local challenges and discuss suitable climate solutions. Another aim of the impact campaign is to help students around the world better understand the issue of climate change, through educational toolkits available to be used with the film, linked to national curricula in the UK, the US, Canada and Norway. There have also been a large number of community screenings organized by NGOs, activists and civil society groups around Europe. Feedback from organizers suggests that Thank You For The Rain's personal approach to climate change makes a powerful impact on the audiences, and helps bring home an issue that is often seen as complex or distant. == References == == External links == * * Category:2017 films Category:2017 documentary films Category:English-language films Category:2017 in Kenya Category:2017 in the environment Category:Documentary films about environmental issues Category:Films set in Kenya Category:Films set in Africa Category:Films shot in Kenya ",
