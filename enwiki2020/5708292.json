    "text": "Daeodon shoshonensis life restoration Agate Springs Fossil Quarry in Nebraska. See text for nomenclature history Daeodon is an extinct genus of entelodont artiodactyl that inhabited North America between 29 and 19 million years ago during the middle Oligocene and early Miocene epochs. It had a broad distribution across the United States, but it was never abundant. The type species is Daeodon shoshonensis, the last and possible largest of the entelodonts; known adults of this species possessed skulls about in length. Another huge member of this family, similar in size and morphology to Daeodon, is the Asian Paraentelodon but it is known by very incomplete material. == Etymology == Although not specified in Cope's original description, the name Daeodon comes from the Greek words , meaning \"hostile\" or \"dreadful\" and , meaning \"teeth\". == Classification == The genus Daeodon was erected by the American anatomist and paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. He classified it as a perissodactyl and thought that it was closely related to Menodus. This classification persisted until the description of \"Elotherium\" calkinsi in 1905, a very similar and much more complete animal from the same rocks, which was promptly assigned as a species of Daeodon by Peterson (1909). This led to Daeodons reclassification as a member of the family Entelodontidae. The exact relationships between Daeodon and other entelodonts are not well understood, some authors (Lucas et al., 1998) consider the greater morphological similarity of Daeodon to Paraentelodon rather than to earlier North American entelodonts, like Archaeotherium, as evidence for Daeodon being a descendant from a Late Oligocene immigration of large Asian entelodonts to North America. However, the existence of distinct specimens of Archoetherium showing characters reminiscent of those present in both Paraentelodon and Daeodon raises the possibility of both genera actually descending from a North American common ancestor. === Species === The type species of Daeodon is D. shohonensis, which is based on a fragment of a lower jaw from the John Day Formation of Oregon. Several other species were assigned to the genus in the subsequent decades, like D. calkinsi, D. mento and D. minor. Since 1945, it had been suggested that two other taxa were actually junior synonyms of Daeodon, but the formalization of this referral didn't take place until the work of Lucas et al. (1998). Ammodon leidyanum, named by Cope's rival, O. C. Marsh, and Dinohyus hollandi, a complete skeleton from the Agate Springs quarry of Nebraska, were found to be indistinguishable from each other and in turn both were indistinguishable from D. shoshonensis. With the exception of D. calkinsi, which was tentatively excluded from Daeodon, the other previously recognized species of Daeodon were also synonymized to D. shoshonensis. That same year, an obscure entelodont, Boochoerus humerosum, was also synonymized to Daeodon by Foss and Fremd (1998) and, albeit its status as a distinct species was retained, they note that the differences could still be attributed to individual or population variation or sexual dimorphism. == Description == Skeletal restoration Daeodon shoshonensis is the largest-known entelodont; known adult individuals had skulls about long and were about tall at the shoulders. It's differentiated from other entelodonts by a suite of unique dental characters, the shape and relatively small size of the cheekbone flanges of its skull compared to those of Archaeotherium, the small size of its chin tubercle, as well as features of its carpus and tarsus and the fusion of the bones of the lower leg. Like other entelodonts, its limbs were long and slender with the bones of the foreleg fused together and with only two toes on each foot. It also had a relatively lightly constructed neck for the size of its head, whose weight was mostly supported by muscles and tendons attached to the tall spines of the thoracic vertebrae, similar to those of modern-day bison and white rhinoceros. == References == Category:Entelodonts Category:Miocene even-toed ungulates Category:Miocene mammals of North America Category:Oligocene mammals of North America Category:Arikareean Category:Hemingfordian Category:White River Fauna Category:Burdigalian genus extinctions Category:Chattian genus first appearances Category:Fossil taxa described in 1878 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope ",
