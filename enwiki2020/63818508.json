It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds, and drives away his fear. 2 It makes the wounded spirit whole and calms the troubled breast; 'tis manna to the hungry soul, and to the weary, rest. 3 Dear Name! the Rock on which I build; my shield and hiding-place; My never-failing treasury, fill'd with boundless stores of grace, 4 By Thee my prayers acceptance gain, although with sin defil'd; Satan accuses me in vain, and I am own'd a child. 5 Jesus, my Savior, Shepherd, Friend, my Prophet, Priest, and King, my Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, accept the praise I bring. 6 Weak is the effort of my heart, and cold my warmest thought; but when I see Thee as Thou art, I'll praise Thee as I ought, 7 Till then I would Thy love proclaim with every fleeting breath; and may the music of Thy name refresh my soul in death. ==References== ==External links== *Hymnary.org - How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds *Hymnal.net - How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds Category:Hymns by John Newton Category:18th-century hymns ",
