    "text": "Inner Mongolia Zhongyou Football Club (), commonly referred to as Hohhot (), is a professional Chinese football club that participates in the China League One division under licence from the Chinese Football Association (CFA). The team is based in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia and their home stadium is the 51,632 capacity Hohhot City Stadium. Their majority shareholders are the Hohhot Sports Bureau and Shanghai Zhongyou Real Estate Group. ==History== On 8 October 2011 Shanxi Jiayi football club was officially established by the Shanghai Zhongyou Real Estate Group who formed a senior team predominantly comprised from players from the Taiyuan University of Technology. With the aid of the Sports Bureau of Shanxi Province a youth team and women's team was also established and the Shanxi Sports Centre Stadium was chosen to be the club's home ground. They registered to play within the third tier of the Chinese football league system in the 2012 league season while the club chose white shirts and black shorts as their home uniform. In their debut season they however decided to move to the artificial turf ground Wanbailin Stadium and later Taiyuan Institute of Electrical Engineering Stadium to play their home games. On the field the club made their debut in the 2012 Chinese FA Cup where they were knocked out in the first round by Shanghai Pudong Zobon F.C. 3\u20131 while in their first season they finished ninth within their group. The club owners decided not to compete within the 2013 league season after a disappointing debut campaign. Wang Bo replaced Wu Jianwen as the club's manager and the team went through an extensive rebuilding process in preparation for the 2014 league season as well as changing the club's name to Taiyuan Zhongyou Jiayi. The rebuilding process would be a big success and the club would come runners-up within the league to Jiangxi Liansheng F.C. that saw them gain promotion to the second tier for the first time. Despite the promotion the club officially admitted the financial difficulties required with the higher level of professionalism and would consider relocating the team to gain the necessary investment. On 5 January 2015 the Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Government Information Office held a press conference to announce that the Hohhot Sports Bureau would be investing and relocating the team to their city, which resulted in the name change of Nei Mongol Zhongyou. ==Name history== *2011\u20132013: Shanxi Jiayi () *2014: Taiyuan Zhongyou Jiayi () *2015\u2013present: Inner Mongolia Zhongyou () ==Current squad== As of 13 September 2020 ===Reserve squad=== As of 5 March 2019 ===Out on loan=== ==Coaching staff== ===Managerial history=== * Wu Jianwen (2012) * Wang Bo (2014\u20132017) * Ra\u00fcl Agn\u00e9(2018) * Wang Bo (2018) * Chen Yang (2019) * Choi Jin-han (2020\u2013) ==Results== All-time league rankings As of the end of 2019 season. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:Center;\" |- !Year !Div ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !Pts !width=2%|Pos. !width=4%|FA Cup !width=2%|Super Cup !|AFC !Att./G !Stadium |- | 2012 || 3 || 24 || 8 || 4 || 12 || 31 || 36 || \u22125 || 28 || 9 || R1 || DNQ || DNQ || 715 || Wanbailin Stadium/Taiyuan IEE Stadium |- | 2014 || 3 || 19 || 11 || 6 || 2 || 30 || 10 || 20 || 33 || style=\"background:silver;\"|RU || DNE || DNQ || DNQ || 2,500 || Shanxi Sports Centre Stadium |- | 2015 || style=\"background:#ffffe0;\"| 2 || 30 || 12 || 7 || 11 || 38 || 32 || 6 || 43 || 6 || R3 || DNQ || DNQ || 18,238 || align=center rowspan=5 |Hohhot City Stadium |- | 2016 ||bgcolor=#FFFFE0|2 || 30 || 12 || 5 || 13 || 37 || 35 || 2 || 41 || 7 || R3 || DNQ || DNQ || 9,468 |- | 2017 ||bgcolor=#FFFFE0|2 || 30 || 9 || 8 || 13 || 40 || 47 || \u22127 || 35 || 10 || R4 || DNQ || DNQ || 7,656 |- | 2018 ||bgcolor=#FFFFE0|2 || 30 || 10 || 4 || 16 || 36 || 54 || \u221218 || 34 || 13 || R3 || DNQ || DNQ || 5,553 |- | 2019 ||bgcolor=#FFFFE0|2 || 30 || 15 || 6 || 9 || 35 || 30 || 5 || 51 || 7 || R2 || DNQ || DNQ || |} Shanxi Jiayi did not compete in 2013. * in North Group.
