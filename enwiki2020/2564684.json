Missiles are used to destroy ground enemies, while laser-like weapons are used for aerial opponents.

With a pair of LS-30 rotary joysticks, Ikari Warriors can be played on the same hardware. == Ports == Alpha Mission was released on the Nintendo Switch in the Nintendo eShop on 25 October 2018 by Hamster Corporation as part of their Arcade Archives series. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed Alpha Mission on their December 1, 1985 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year. ==See also== *List of Famicom games ==External links== * Alpha Mission at Arcade-History * == References == Category:1985 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Science fiction video games Category:SNK franchises Category:SNK games Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
