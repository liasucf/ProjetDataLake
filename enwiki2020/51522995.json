    "text": "Christians Plejehus is a former military retirement home for war veterans in Store Kongensgade in Copenhagen, Denmark. The building complex is listed. ==History== Seal from Christians Plejehus In the early 1760s, Christian Carl Pflueg. an officer in the engineering troops, proposed an improvement of the conditions in the home for war veterans at Ladeg\u00e5rden. In 1764, the fieldmarshal-general assigned him as an assistant to the director of the institution. The following year he left the engineering troops to assume a position as director of a new institution which was given the name Christians Plejehjem after Christian VII. Kammerr\u00e5d Gilles Vilhelm Faenen's former factory site in Store Kongensgade was chosen as the location of the new institution and Plejehus designed the buildings which were completed in 1769. The complex contained a linen weaving mill operated by the residents using yarn made by soldier wives and daughters. Other crafts were also practiced in the facility. The complex was originally intended for 300 residents but was home to 500 by 1772 approximately half of which were children. The building in the late 19th century In 1775, Christians Plejehus was moved to S\u00f8lvgade Barracks together with Almindelig Hospital and Pflueg was placed under supervision of a director general since his administration was deemed to costly. The move hadm however, disturbed the operations of the weaving mill and deteriorated the institution economy even further. In 1782, Pflueg was fired without pension and Christians Plejehus moved to Eckernf\u00f8rde in Schleswig-Holstein in 1785. When Christians Plejehus moved to S\u00f8lvgade in 1775, its old buildings in Store Kongensgade were taken over by Det kgl. Opfostringshus. It was based there until 1880 when a new building in Randersgade in \u00d8sterbro was inaugurated in 1880. The Salvation Army rented the chapel from 1886 until 1948 and became home to several house share collectives in the 1960s. It has later been converted into a housing cooperative. The buildings were renovated in 2009. ==Building== The rear side of the main wing One of the two courtyards The building is 15 bays long has a median risalit with rustication and the ground floor is decorated with 10 lesenes.
