He returned to training in January 2009, and played half a game for the reserve team on 2 February 2009, and left Heerenveen that summer when his contract was not renewed. On 10 August 2009, he returned to his former Bod\u00f8/Glimt, signing a short term contract for the remainder of the season. On 3 March 2010, Hanssen signed a three-year contract with Str\u00f8msgodset IF.
