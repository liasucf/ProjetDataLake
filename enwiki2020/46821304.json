    "text": "There are 116 libraries within the University of Cambridge. These include the main University Library, twenty-one affiliated libraries, departmental and faculty Libraries, College Libraries, and various other specialist libraries associated with the University. Across all libraries, the University houses approximately 15 million books. == University Library == Cambridge University Library, referred to within the University as \"the University Library\" or just \"the UL\", is the central research library. It holds around 8 million items (including maps and sheet music) and, in contrast with the Bodleian or the British Library, many of its books are available on open shelves. It is one of the six legal deposit libraries in the United Kingdom, and is therefore entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland. Through legal deposit, purchases and donations it receives around 100,000 books every year. == Affiliated Libraries == There are twenty-one affiliate libraries associated with the main University Library, for the purpose of central governance and administration. The affiliated libraries are a growing network, with a remit to \"maximise efficiency while catering to the diverse range of user needs.\" {| class=\"wikitable\" | * African Studies | * Asian & Middle Eastern Studies | * Art and Architecture |- | * Criminology Library | * Education | * English |- | * Haddon Library | * Marshall Library | * Medical Library |- | * Mill Lane Library | * Moore Library | * Pendlebury Library of Music |- | * Casimir Lewy Library (Philosophy) | * Seeley Historical Library | * Social and Political Sciences |- | * South Asian Studies | * Squire Law Library | * Whipple Library |- | * Classics | * Divinity | * Modern & Medieval Languages Library |} == Departmental and Faculty Libraries == {| class=\"wikitable\" | * Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Library | * Applied Economics Department Library | * Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics Library | * Astronomy Library | * Balfour and Newton (Zoology) | * Bullard Laboratories Library |- | * Cambridge University Collection of Aerial Photography | * CUCAP | * Careers Service Library | * Centre for International Law | * Centre of International Studies | * Chemical Engineering |- | * Chemistry Library | * Colman Library (Biochemistry) | * Computer Laboratory | * Cory Library (Botanic Gardens) | * Department of Psychology Library | * Development Studies |- | * Earth Sciences | * Engineering Library | * English Faculty Library | * Experimental Psychology | * Fitzwilliam Museum | * Fitzwilliam Museum: Department of Coins and Medals |- | * Fitzwilliam Museum: Department of Manuscripts and Printed Books | * Genetics Library | * Geography Library | * Hamilton Kerr Institute | * Herbarium Library (Plant Sciences) | * History and Philosophy of Science |- | * History of Population and Social Structure | * Institute of Continuing Education | * Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Superconductivity | * Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences | * Judge Business School Information Centre | * Kanthack and Nuttall |- | * Land Economy | * Language Centre | * Latin American Studies Centre | * Lauterpacht Research Centre | * Materials Science Library | * Oriental Studies |- | * Physiology Development and Neuroscience Library | * Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics Library | * Rayleigh Library (Physics) | * Scott Polar | * Social Anthropology Library | * UCLES Library (Cambridge Assessment) |- | * Veterinary Anatomy Library | * Veterinary Medicine | | | | |} == College Libraries == There is at least one library in every college within the University. All Colleges have a working library, generally to support undergraduate teaching. Material in the College libraries will typically cover all Tripos subjects. Many of the Colleges also have special collections such as early printed books and manuscripts, and are often kept in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library holds more than 200,000 books printed before 1800, while the Parker Library at Corpus Christi College, has one of the greatest early medieval European manuscript collections in the world, with over 600 manuscripts. {| class=\"wikitable\" | * Christ's College (Working Library) (Old Library) | * Churchill College | * Clare College (Forbes Mellon Library) | * Clare Hall | * Corpus Christi College (Taylor Library) (Parker Library) | * Darwin College |- | * Downing College | * Emmanuel College | * Fitzwilliam College (Olisa Library) | * Girton College | * Gonville & Caius College (Upper Library) (Lower Library) | * Homerton College |- | * Hughes Hall | * Jesus College | * King's College | * Lucy Cavendish College | * Magdalene College (College Library) (Pepys Library) | * Murray Edwards College |- | * Newnham College | * Pembroke College | * Peterhouse | * Queens' College | * Robinson College | * Selwyn College (Selwyn College Library) |- | * Sidney Sussex College | * St Catharine's College | * St Edmund's College | * St John's College | * Trinity College (College Library) (Wren Library) | * Trinity Hall (Jerwood Library) |- | * Wolfson College (Lee Seng Tee Library/Lee Library) | | | | | |} == Other Libraries associated with the University == {| class=\"wikitable\" | * Ancient India and Iran Trust | * Blackfriars | * British Antarctic Survey | * Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme |- | * Cambridge Centre for Christianity Worldwide | * Cambridge Theological Federation | * Centre for Jewish-Christian Relations | * Henry Martyn Centre |- | * Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies | * Institute of Biotechnology | * MRC Human Nutrition Research | * Margaret Beaufort Institute of Theology |- | * Molecular Biology | * Needham Research Institute (East Asian History of Science Library) | * Ridley Hall | * Strangeways Research Laboratory |- | * Tyndale House | * Union Society | * Wesley House | * Westcott House |- | * Westfield House | * Westminster College | * Woolf Institute | |} ==See also== * Books in the United Kingdom == References == == External links == * http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/libraries_directory/libraries_directory.cgi Cambridge University ",
