It is the main venue of the larger Morodok Techo National Sports Complex. ==Construction== The Morodok Techo National Sports Complex which includes the main stadium was constructed specifically for Cambodia's hosting of the 2023 Southeast Asian Games. Construction of the sports complex began in April 2013 while the construction of the main stadium began in August 2017. The groundbreaking ceremony for the stadium was held earlier on April 4, 2017. The Chinese government provided 1.1 billion Chinese yuan (about $160 million) aid for the construction of the stadium which was developed by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. Around 340 Chinese engineers and 240 Cambodian workers and technicians were involved in the construction. By January 2019 the installation of seats was completed. ==Architecture and design== The structure of the Morodok Techo National Stadium was designed to resemble a sailing ship as a commemoration of Cambodia-China relations; due to Chinese people used to visit Cambodia by sailing in ancient times. The stadium is planned to be tall with two \"prow\" structures rising high which were designed to allude to the Khmer gesture of Sampeah. The stadium is to be surrounded by an Angkor-style moat and ornated by a motif based on the Rumdul flower (Mitrella mesnyi) which is the national flower of Cambodia. The stadium will have a capacity of 75,000 people. ==References== Category:Sport in Phnom Penh Category:Proposed stadiums Category:Football venues in Cambodia ",
