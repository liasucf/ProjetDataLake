The members used to describe their musical style as \"wonky rock,\" later changed to \"fabloo,\" in an effort to not let their music be defined by any particular genres.MTV interview with Tally Hall, where Cantor described the band's dropping of the \"wonky rock\" genre in favor of a less-restrictive title. Tally Hall has five members, distinguished by the color of their neckties: vocalist and guitarist Rob Cantor (yellow), drummer Ross Federman (gray), vocalist and guitarist Joe Hawley (red), vocalist and keyboardist Andrew Horowitz (green), and vocalist and bassist Zubin Sedghi (blue). Once under the Atlantic Records recording label, Tally Hall was, again, signed to indie label Quack!Media,Tally Hall announced the release date of Good & Evil under Quack who previously helped finance and nationally distribute their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum. They released their second album, Good & Evil, on June 21, 2011. Tally Hall also provided the vocals and music for all of the songs in Happy Monster Band, a children's television series that aired on Playhouse Disney. == History == ===Early years=== Horowitz, the only member not originally from Michigan, began writing songs when he was eight years old, and attended the University of Michigan, studying composition. There he met Cantor, who had both attended high school with Sedghi and joined Hawley's film production group. When Tally Hall's original drummer, Steve Gallagher, left the band in 2004, they recruited Federman, who had gone to high school with Hawley. The name \"Tally Hall\" comes from its use as the name of an indoor shopping plaza on Orchard Lake Road in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, the arcade whose name shares the title of their debut album, remains there, though the shopping center has changed names. In 2005, the band released their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum. Violinist Jeremy Kittel contributed strings to the album. The band has received national media attention, performing their song \"Good Day\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on August 2, 2006, as well as appearing in MTV's segment You Hear It First in September 2006.

They performed \"Welcome to Tally Hall\" in newly donned black vests over top of their traditional colored ties, white shirts, and black pants. The band worked on several projects after the completion of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, including covering the song \"Smile Like You Mean It\" by The Killers for the sixth The O.C. soundtrack: Music from the OC: Mix 6.
