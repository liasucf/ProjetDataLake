ISSN 1809-452X Moreira was the first Brazilian university professor to cite and use the psychoanalytic theory in the teaching of medicine. == Life and career == Juliano Moreira was born on January 6, 1872, in Salvador, capital of the then province of Bahia. He studied at the Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia (Faculty of Medicine of Bahia), today the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), graduating in 1891 with the thesis S\u00edfilis maligna precoce (Early malignant syphilis). In 1896 he became a professor of psychiatry at his alma mater. From 1895 to 1902, he attended mental illness courses and internships and visited many asylums in Germany, England, France, Italy, and Scotland. In addition to study trips, he was often required to seek out specialists and clinics to treat his own tuberculosis. When the disease got worse, he took a new license and traveled to Europe for better treatment and later went to a sanatorium in Cairo, where he met Augusta Peick, a German nurse from Hamburg. The two married in the early 1910s and came together to Brazil.Santos, Raquel Pinheiro dos.

S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo: Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, 2014, p. 99. From 1903 to 1930, Moreira was the director of the Hosp\u00edcio Nacional de Alienados (National Asylum for the Insane), currently Hosp\u00edcio Pedro II, in Rio de Janeiro. During his tenure, he humanized the patients' treatment and ended their imprisonment. Moreira spoke against the pseudoscientific racist beliefs espoused at the time, such as that racial miscegenation caused mental illnesses; he defended that they were due to physical and situational factors such as poor hygiene and lack of access to education. Moreira was the first researcher to identify mucosal cutaneous leishmaniasis and sought to prove that the racial issue did not motivate the disease. Moreira joined the Brazilian Academy of Sciences in 1917 and was its president from 1926 to 1929. == Death == Moreira died in 1933 in Petr\u00f3polis, in a sanatory to treat his tuberculosis.
