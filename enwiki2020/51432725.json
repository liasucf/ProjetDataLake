    "text": "The council of the Overstrand Local Municipality in the Western Cape, South Africa is elected every five years by a system of mixed-member proportional representation. Half of the councillors are elected by first-past-the-post voting from individual wards, while the other half are appointed from party lists so that the total number of party representatives is proportional to the number of votes received. By-elections are held to replace the councillors elected by wards if a vacancy occurs. ==December 2000 election== The Overstrand municipality was created in 2000 by merging the Hangklip-Kleinmond, Hermanus, Stanford and Gansbaai municipalities. The council consisted of 18 members, 9 elected to represent wards and 9 from party lists. The election was held on 5 December 2000; the Democratic Alliance won a majority of 12 seats. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\" !colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| Overstrand local election, 5 December 2000 |- !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Party !!colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| Votes !!colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| Seats |- !
