In 1989, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT). In the early 1990s, when the PCT's single-party rule collapsed and multiparty politics was introduced, Oba lost his post as Director-General of Public Security; subsequently he served as aide-de-camp to Sassou Nguesso.John F. Clark and Samuel Decalo, Historical Dictionary of Republic of the Congo, fourth edition (2012), Scarecrow Press, page 329. Along with Colonel Michel Ngakala, he created the \"Cobras\", a militia loyal to opposition leader Sassou- Nguesso, in 1993.Mbow M. Amphas, Political Transformations of the Congo (2000), Pentland Press, page 102. ==Political career since 1997== Oba participated in the June-October 1997 civil war on Sassou Nguesso's side and was wounded in the fighting. After Sassou Nguesso's Cobra militia returned him to power in October 1997, Oba was appointed as Minister of the Interior, Security, and Territorial Administration on 2 November 1997.Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social, and Cultural Series (1997), pages 12,887-12,888.John F. Clark, The Failure of Democracy in the Republic of Congo (2008), Lynne Rienner Publishers, page 260. He was the only member of the government who did not stand as a candidate in the May-June 2002 parliamentary election.\"Elections l\u00e9gislatives : le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Int\u00e9rieur publie la liste officielle des 1 199 candidats\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 14 May 2002 . After the election, in the government named on 18 August 2002, Oba was appointed as Minister of Security and Police.\"Le nouveau gouvernement a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place\", La Semaine Africaine, 22 August 2002 .\"Old guard, new guard\", Africa Confidential, volume 43, number 17, 30 August 2002. Oba was believed to have been marginalized by Jean-Dominique Okemba, another influential security official and Sassou Nguesso relative, during the mid-2000s.Paul Soni-Benga, Les non-dits des violences politiques du Congo-Brazzaville (2005), L'Harmattan, page 303 .\"Nepotists' nirvana\", Africa Confidential, volume 45, number 9, 30 April 2004.

Le Congo a un premier ministre\", Congo-Media, 12 January 2005 . the move decreased Oba's prominence. Following the death of Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard, the Minister of State for Hydrocarbons, in July 2009, Oba additionally managed his portfolio in an interim capacity.Willy Mbossa, \"Parlement : le S\u00e9nat adopte la r\u00e9glementation sur la p\u00eache, le partage de production p\u00e9troli\u00e8re, et la propagande anticonceptionnelle\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 30 August 2009 . He was retained as Minister of Mines and Geology in the government appointed on 15 September 2009, but was released from his interim responsibility for the hydrocarbons portfolio.\"Gouvernement - La nouvelle \u00e9quipe compte trente-sept membres\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 16 September 2009 . In August 2013, he was probed by French authorities for the alleged role he may have played in human rights abuses during the 1997 civil war.\"Human rights abuse suspect Pierre Oba pulls out of Perth conference\", WAtoday, August 30, 2013. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Republic of the Congo military personnel Category:1953 births Category:Government ministers of the Republic of the Congo Category:Congolese Party of Labour politicians Category:People from Plateaux Department (Republic of the Congo) ",
