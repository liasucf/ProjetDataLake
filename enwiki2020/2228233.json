    "text": "Ready an' Willing is the third studio album by English hard rock band Whitesnake, released on 31 May 1980. It was the group's first album to feature singer David Coverdale and keyboard player Jon Lord's former Deep Purple colleague Ian Paice on drums. It peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart, it was also the band's first to chart outside of the UK, reaching No. 32 in Norway and No. 90 in the US. The album featured two of the band's UK single- hits from that year: \"Fool for Your Loving\" had reached No. 13 in the charts on 26 April 1980, and the title-track, \"Ready an' Willing (Sweet Satisfaction)\" made No. 43 in July of the same year. On 2 August 1980 \"Fool for Your Loving\" peaked at No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100; the song would later be re-recorded for the Slip of the Tongue album. The track \"Blindman\", initially from David Coverdale's first solo album White Snake, was re-recorded for this album. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Whitesnake=== *David Coverdale \u2013 lead and backing vocals *Micky Moody \u2013 guitars, backing vocals *Bernie Marsden \u2013 guitars, backing vocals *Neil Murray \u2013 bass *Ian Paice \u2013 drums *Jon Lord \u2013 keyboards ===Production=== *Martin Birch \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\"; rowspan=\"4\"|1980 |align=\"center\"|UK Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"center\"| Norwegian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|32 |- |align=\"center\"| Billboard 200 (USA) |align=\"center\"|90 |- |align=\"center\"| Japanese Oricon LP Chart |align=\"center\"|160 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"500px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|1980 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\"Fool for Your Loving\" |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|13 |- |align=\"center\"|Billboard Hot 100 (USA) |align=\"center\"|53 |- |align=\"center\"|\"Ready an' Willing\" |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|43 |} == Certifications == {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- |Country |Organization |Year |Sales |- |UK |BPI |1981 |Gold (+ 100,000) |- |} == Accolades == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
