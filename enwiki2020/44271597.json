    "text": "Rolando Mandragora (; born 29 June 1997) is an Italian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Serie A club Udinese, on loan from Juventus. He began his professional career at Genoa, making five Serie A appearances and playing more frequently on loan at Pescara in Serie B. In 2016 he joined Juventus, where he made a sole appearance and was loaned a year later to Crotone, where he played regularly. He signed for Udinese in 2018. He rejoined Juventus in October 2020 and was immediately loaned back to Udinese. Mandragora represented Italy at every age group from under-17 to under-21. He made his senior international debut in June 2018. == Club career== ===Early career=== Mandragora is a native of the Naples quartiere of Scamp\u00eca. His father ran the local football school established by Paolo and Fabio Cannavaro. Mandragora was scouted by Serie A clubs while at Mariano Keller and joined the youth sector of Genoa at age fourteen. He made his Serie A debut on 29 October 2014 against Juventus in a 1\u20130 home win. He played the first 69 minutes of the game, before being substituted by Juraj Kucka. ===Juventus=== On 19 January 2016, Juventus confirmed the signing of Mandragora on a five-year contract for an initial fee of \u20ac6 million, potentially rising to \u20ac12 million based on performance. He spent the rest of the 2015\u201316 season on loan at Serie B side Pescara. In April 2016 he suffered a fractured metatarsal in his right foot which required surgery. His recovery was hindered due to complications and he was forced to undergo a second surgery that August. Mandragora returned to Juventus for the 2016\u201317 season and was given the number 38 shirt. He made his Juventus debut on 23 April 2017, coming on as a substitute for Claudio Marchisio in the 86th minute of a 4\u20130 home win against his former club Genoa, in Serie A. On 5 August 2017, Mandragora was loaned to fellow top-flight team Crotone for the season. He played all but two of their league games, starting each one as the Calabrian club suffered relegation, and contributed two goals; the first of his career was on 24 September to open a 2\u20130 home win over Benevento. ===Udinese=== On 2 July 2018, Mandragora was sold to fellow Serie A side Udinese but Juventus kept a buy-back option for \u20ac20 million. Mandragora received a one-match retrospective ban for blasphemy from Lega Serie A in August 2018; after having a shot saved against Sampdoria he shouted insults towards the Virgin Mary and God. On 22 December 2018, Mandragora scored his first goal for Udinese to open a 1\u20131 home draw with Frosinone. A week later, he was given a straight red card by the video assistant referee in a 2\u20130 win over Cagliari also at the Stadio Friuli. On 3 October 2020, Juventus announced that Mandragora was rejoining the club on a five-year contract for \u20ac10.7 million, while remaining with Udinese on loan for the remainder of the 2020\u201321 season. The deal also included an optional one-year extension of the loan and a potential \u20ac6 million extra payment to Udinese based on his performances. ==International career== A regular youth international, Mandragora made his debut for the Italy U21 team on 12 August 2015, in a friendly match against Hungary. He was named in the team for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in South Korea. Mandragora made his senior international debut for Italy under Roberto Mancini, starting in a 3\u20131 friendly loss to France in Nice on 1 June 2018. He took part in the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, as the team's captain.https://www.figc.it/it/nazionali/news/nazionale-under-21-parte- avventura-europea-di-biagio-ufficializza-la-lista-dei-23-azzurrini/ ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Club ! rowspan=2 | Season ! rowspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup1 ! colspan=2 | Europe2 ! colspan=2 | Other Cups3 ! colspan=2 | Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | Genoa | 2014\u201315 | Serie A | 5 || 0 || 0 || 0 || colspan=\"2\" | \u2014 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || 5 || 0 |- | Pescara (loan) | 2015\u201316 | Serie B | 26 || 0 || 1 || 0 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || 27 || 0 |- | Juventus | 2016\u201317 | rowspan=\"5\"|Serie A | 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 |- | Crotone (loan) | 2017\u201318 | 36 || 2 || 1 || 0 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || 37 || 2 |- | rowspan=\"4\"| Udinese | 2018\u201319 | 35 || 3 || 1 || 0 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || 36 || 3 |- | 2019\u201320 | 26 || 0 || 2 || 3 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || 28 || 3 |- | 2020\u201321 | 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 || 0 || 0 |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Total ! 61 !! 3 !! 3 !! 3 !! colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 !! colspan=\"2\"| \u2014 !! 64 !! 6 |- ! colspan=\"3\"| Career total || 129 || 5 || 5 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 134 || 8 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Italy |- |2018||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total||1||0 |} ==Honours== ;Juventus *Serie A: 2016\u201317 *Coppa Italia: 2016\u201317 Italy U20 *FIFA U-20 World Cup bronze medals:2017https://web.archive.org/web/20170519214906/http://www.figc.it/it/204/2537620/2017/05/News.shtml ==References== ==External links== * * Profile at Lega Serie A * Profile at FIGC Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Italian footballers Category:Italy international footballers Category:Italy under-21 international footballers Category:Italy youth international footballers Category:Serie A players Category:Serie B players Category:Genoa C.F.C. players Category:Delfino Pescara 1936 players Category:Juventus F.C. players Category:F.C.
