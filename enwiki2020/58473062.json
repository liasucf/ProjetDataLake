    "text": "Mississauga MetroStars (briefly known as MetroStars Canada in 2019) were a professional indoor soccer team which played its home games at the Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The team joined the Major Arena Soccer League for the 2018\u201319 season. The club featured former Toronto FC players Dwayne De Rosario, Molham Babouli and Adrian Cann on the roster in its first season. Just as the 2019\u201320 season began, it was announced the team would cease operations. ==History== ===Background=== Historically the Canadian professional indoor soccer landscape consisted of Canadian franchises in American leagues particularly in the North American Soccer League (NASL) and the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). The height of Canadian participation in indoor soccer occurred during the 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 NASL seasons when four Canadian clubs participated simultaneously. The height of Canadian participation in the NPSL would eventually expand to include four teams, which consisted of the Edmonton Drillers, Montreal Impact, Toronto Shooting Stars, and Toronto ThunderHawks. After the demise of the NPSL in 2001 the country was without a professional league structure, until the creation of the Canadian Major Indoor Soccer League (CMISL) in 2007. The league served as the first exclusively Canadian professional indoor soccer league, and was primarily based in Western Canada until it ceased operations in 2012. In 2017, the Canadian Arena Soccer Association (CASA) was founded as the governing body for the sport in Canada. The CASA sanctioned the developmental Youth Arena Premier League and the semi-professional Arena Premier League \u2013 both based in Mississauga. The purpose of the Arena Premier League was to develop and provide talent to the Canadian national indoor team, and later to the MetroStars. ===Formation and dissolution=== The MetroStars were founded in 2018 and were one of 17 participants in the 2018\u201319 Major Arena Soccer League season. They made their debut on December 1 against the defending league champion Baltimore Blast. According to team owner Gladiator Sports, the MetroStars payroll for the year was about $500,000. The team finished the 2018\u201319 season 15th in the league with a record of 4 wins, 20 losses, and ranked 14th in attendance with an average of 1,020 per game. For the 2019\u201320 season, the team rebranded as MetroStars Canada. They planned to play their 12 home games in six cities across Ontario (St. Catharines, Kingston, Oshawa, Windsor, Sarnia, and Brampton) to spread awareness for the sport. Before playing a single game that season, the Major Arena Soccer League published a revised schedule that did not include the MetroStars. Six days later, the team confirmed that they would not be participating in the season due to issues coordinating their home matches. ==2018\u201319 roster== ===Active players=== *As of 24 August 2019 ===Inactive players=== ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Defunct Major Arena Soccer League teams Category:Soccer clubs in Ontario Category:Sport in Mississauga Category:Canadian indoor soccer teams Category:2018 establishments in Ontario Category:Association football clubs established in 2018 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2019 Category:2019 disestablishments in Ontario ",
