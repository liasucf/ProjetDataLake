    "text": "The 2015\u201316 NCAA Division I men's basketball season began on November 13. The first tournament was the 2K Sports Classic and ended with the Final Four in Houston April 2\u20134. Practices officially began on October 2. ==Rule changes== The following rule changes were proposed by the NCAA Men's Rules Committee for the 2015\u201316 season, and officially approved by the NCAA Men's Playing Rules Oversight Panel: * Reducing the shot clock from 35 to 30 seconds (same as the women's game). * Providing offensive players the same verticality protections as defensive players. * Extending the restricted-area arc from 3 feet to 4 feet from the basket. * Reducing the number of team timeouts from 5 to 4, with a limit of no more than 3 timeouts in the second half. * Ending the practice of coaches calling timeouts from the bench in live-ball situations. * Tightening the 10-second backcourt rule, under which the offensive team has 10 seconds to advance the ball from the backcourt to the frontcourt. The following situations, all of which resulted in a reset of the 10-second count under previous rules, no longer reset the count: ** The defense deflects the ball out of bounds. ** A held ball situation in the offensive backcourt in which the possession arrow favors the offense. ** A technical foul against the offensive team during possession in its own backcourt. * Eliminating the five- second \"closely-guarded\" rule while the ball is being dribbled. * Allowing for technical fouls to be called on players who are determined to have faked a foul while reviewing for a flagrant foul. * Allow video replay of shot-clock violations throughout the game. Previously, this type of review was limited to only the final 2:00 of the game and in overtime. * \"Class B\" technical fouls, such as hanging on the rim and delay of game, now result in one free throw by the non-violating team instead of the previous two. * Requiring that a timeout taken 30 seconds or less before a scheduled media timeout break (which are at 16:00, 12:00, 8:00, and 4:00 of each half) become the media timeout. This particular change had been made in NCAA women's basketball effective with the 2013\u201314 season. * Stricter enforcement of resumption of play after timeouts, and reducing from 20 seconds to 15 seconds the time allowed to replace a disqualified (fouled out) player. Teams will receive a delay-of-game warning after the first violation, and a Class B technical foul for each subsequent violation. * Dunking will be allowed during team warmups and halftime. * An experimental rule allowing players six personal fouls instead of five will be used in all national postseason tournaments except for the NCAA Tournament. == Season headlines == * May 27 \u2013 The NCAA announces its Academic Progress Rate (APR) sanctions for the 2015\u201316 school year. A total of 21 programs in 9 sports are declared ineligible for postseason play due to failure to meet the required APR benchmark, including the following four Division I men's basketball teams: ** Alcorn State ** Florida A&M; ** Stetson ** Central Arkansas * June 29 \u2013 Wisconsin head coach Bo Ryan announced he would retire at the end of the 2015\u201316 season. * August 13 \u2013 Ryan backed away from his previously announced retirement plans, saying that he was open to staying on beyond this season and that he would make his decision in the coming months. * September 29 \u2013 The NCAA announces penalties against SMU following an investigation into a wide array of violations: ** The Mustangs are banned from postseason play for 2015\u201316. ** Head coach Larry Brown is suspended for nine games. ** SMU loses nine men's basketball scholarships from 2016\u201317 through 2018\u201319. Since the team has only 11 scholarship players for 2015\u201316, two short of the NCAA limit of 13, the two unused scholarships can count toward the penalty. ** The men's basketball program is hit with three years' probation. * October 2 \u2013 Yahoo! Sports reveals that the University of Louisville is investigating allegations made in a soon-to-be-published book whose author, a self-described madam, claimed that she had been paid thousands of dollars by former Louisville graduate assistant and director of basketball operations Andre McGee to provide women to dance for and have sex with Cardinals players and recruits. * November 10 \u2013 The Associated Press preseason All-American team was released. Gonzaga forward Kyle Wiltjer was the leading vote-getter (51 votes). Joining him on the team were Iowa State forward Georges Niang (46 votes), Providence guard Kris Dunn (43), Oklahoma guard Buddy Hield (40) and LSU forward Ben Simmons (28). * December 15 \u2013 Bo Ryan announced his retirement after a win against Texas A&M;\u2013Corpus Christi, effective immediately, with associate head coach Greg Gard assuming the title of interim head coach. * December 23 \u2013 The NCAA announces penalties against Hawaii for significant violations of NCAA rules: ** Former head coach Gib Arnold, who had been fired shortly before the 2014\u201315 season, receives a three-year show-cause penalty. An assistant involved in the violations receives a two-year show-cause. ** The Rainbow Warriors will be banned from postseason play in 2016\u201317. ** The team will lose two scholarships in both 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318; it had previously announced a reduction of one scholarship for each of those seasons. * January 13 ** The NCAA Division I council approves the following changes to its rules regarding declaration for the NBA draft: *** Declaration for the draft no longer results in automatic loss of college eligibility. As long as a player does not sign a contract with a professional team outside the NBA, or sign with an agent, he will retain college eligibility as long as he makes a timely withdrawal from the draft. *** NCAA players now have until 10 days after the end of the NBA Draft Combine to withdraw from the draft. For 2016, the withdrawal date will be May 25, about five weeks after the previous mid-April deadline. *** NCAA players may participate in the draft combine, and will also be allowed to attend one tryout per year with each NBA team without losing college eligibility. *** NCAA players may now enter and withdraw from the draft multiple times without loss of eligibility. Previously, the NCAA treated a second declaration of draft eligibility as a permanent loss of college eligibility. ** Missouri admits to major NCAA violations dating to 2011. While the NCAA has yet to announce its findings, Missouri voluntarily imposes the following sanctions: *** The Tigers will not participate in any postseason play this season, including the SEC Tournament. *** All 23 of the Tigers' wins in the 2013\u201314 season are vacated. *** The Tigers will lose one scholarship in each of the next two seasons, and restrict recruiting in 2016\u201317. * February 6 ** Louisville self-imposes ban for 2016 postseason * March 10 ** The Ivy League announces that it will institute men's and women's conference tournaments effective with the 2016\u201317 season. The top four teams in the regular-season standings will qualify for each tournament. While the tournament winners will receive automatic bids to the NCAA men's and women's tournaments, the official conference champions will continue to be determined solely by regular-season results. The inaugural editions will be held March 11\u201312, 2017 at the Palestra in Philadelphia. * April 8 \u2013 The NCAA announces penalties against Southern Miss for a wide array of violations occurring during the tenure of former head coach Donnie Tyndall. The NCAA's findings indicate that mere weeks after Tyndall became head coach, he directed program staffers to complete fraudulent coursework so that several recruits would ostensibly be eligible to play. It was also found that Tyndall had arranged for cash payments to recruits, fabricated documents in an attempt to cover up the payments, and deleted emails relevant to the investigation. ** Tyndall receives a 10-year show-cause, and even after it expires in 2026, he will be suspended for 50% of his next full season as an NCAA coach. Three of his assistants receive 8-year, 7-year, and 6-year penalties. At the time, Tyndall planned to appeal his penalty. ** The NCAA accepts the school's self-imposed two-year postseason ban, but places the Golden Eagles on three years' probation. All wins in which ineligible players participated are vacated, and the Golden Eagles lose four scholarships over the next three seasons. ===Milestones and records=== *During the season, the following players reached the 2000 career point milestone \u2013 Evansville guard D. J. Balentine, High Point forward John Brown, Hofstra guard Juan'ya Green, Louisiana\u2013Lafayette forward Shawn Long, Iowa State forward Georges Niang, Old Dominion guard Trey Freeman, Oklahoma guard Buddy Hield, Stony Brook forward Jameel Warney, Louisville guard Damion Lee, Fresno State guard Marvelle Harris, Army swingman Kyle Wilson. and Iona guard A.

Retrieved on November 29, 2015. * January 26 \u2013 Virginia beats Wake Forest on a 9\u20131 run in the final fifteen seconds, including a buzzer beater three-point bank shot from Darius Thompson, in a comeback highly noted for its statistical improbability. *February 1 \u2013 Duke's streak of 167 appearances in the AP Poll ended as the 5th longest streak of all time. * February 5 \u2013 Yale's Brandon Sherrod, who entered the Bulldogs' game against Columbia one shy of the Division I record of 26 consecutive field goals made, makes his first five field goal attempts in Yale's 86\u201372 win to set a new record of 30. * February 8 \u2013 The 2015\u201316 Villanova Wildcats became the program's first team to reach number one in the AP Poll by climbing to the top of the 2015\u201316 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings. *March 16 \u2013 In BYU's 97\u201379 victory over UAB in the first round of the NIT, Collinsworth posts his sixth triple-double of the season, tying his own single-season record from last season and extending his NCAA career record to 12. ==Conference membership changes== After a tumultuous four years in which over 80 Division I schools moved to new conferences\u2014some more than once\u2014only two schools joined new conferences as full members for 2015\u201316: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !School !Former conference !New conference |- | NJIT Highlanders | Independent | Atlantic Sun |- | Northern Kentucky Norse | Atlantic Sun | Horizon |} Another change in membership involved the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). This did not involve a school moving to a new league, but rather a change in identity of a Division I school. During the summer of 2015, the University of Texas\u2013Pan American (UTPA) and the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) merged to form the new University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). The UTPA athletic program was inherited by UTRGV, which retained UTPA's WAC membership. Following UAB's decision to drop football at the end of the 2014 season, its future membership in Conference USA (C-USA) beyond 2014\u201315 was initially uncertain, as league bylaws require all member schools to either sponsor FBS football or be committed to establishing an FBS program. Due to ongoing efforts by boosters and other supporters to raise funds to bring UAB football back, C-USA indicated that UAB would be allowed to remain in the league for the 2015\u201316 season, but not beyond that time unless football was reinstated. On June 1, 2015, UAB initially announced that the football program would be reinstated in 2016, later pushing back the return of football to 2017; this was sufficient to satisfy C-USA, which announced that it would keep UAB as a member. The 2015\u201316 season was the last for Coastal Carolina in the Big South Conference. On September 1, 2015, the university and the Sun Belt Conference jointly announced that the Chanticleers would join the Sun Belt in July 2016, initially as a non-football member. The football team will join the Sun Belt in 2017, the second year of its transition from FCS to FBS football. ==New arenas== * The Omaha Mavericks left their home since 2012, the off-campus Ralston Arena, for the new on-campus Baxter Arena. The Mavericks' first game in the new arena was on November 13 against the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, with the Mavericks losing 60\u201359. * The Ole Miss Rebels also opened a new arena, but unlike Omaha, the move was from one campus venue to another. Tad Smith Coliseum, home to the Rebels since 1966, was replaced by The Pavilion at Ole Miss. The new arena, with a capacity of 9,500, opened on January 7, with the Rebels defeating Alabama 74\u201366. ==Season outlook== ===Pre\u2013season polls=== The top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls. {| |- style=\"vertical- align:top;\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !colspan=2| AP |- !Ranking !Team |- |1 | align=left|North Carolina |- |2 | align=left|Kentucky |- |3 | align=left|Maryland |- |4 | align=left|Kansas |- |5 | align=left|Duke |- |6 | align=left|Virginia |- |7 | align=left|Iowa State |- |8 | align=left|Oklahoma |- |9 | align=left|Gonzaga |- |10 | align=left|Wichita State |- |11 | align=left|Villanova |- |12 | align=left|Arizona |- |13 | align=left|Michigan State |- |14 | align=left|California |- |15 | align=left|Indiana |- |16 | align=left|Utah |- |17 | align=left|Wisconsin |- |18 | align=left|Vanderbilt |- |19 | align=left|Notre Dame |- |20 | align=left|UConn |- |21 | align=left|LSU |- |22 | align=left|Baylor |- |23 | align=left|Purdue |- |24 | align=left|Butler |- |25 | align=left|Michigan |} | {| |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !colspan=2| USA Today Coaches |- !Ranking !Team |- |1 | align=left|Kentucky |- |1 | align=left|North Carolina |- |3 | align=left|Maryland |- |4 | align=left|Duke |- |5 | align=left|Kansas |- |6 | align=left|Virginia |- |7 | align=left|Iowa State |- |8 | align=left|Oklahoma |- |9 | align=left|Villanova |- |10 | align=left|Arizona |- |11 | align=left|Gonzaga |- |12 | align=left|Wichita State |- |13 | align=left|Michigan State |- |14 | align=left|California |- |15 | align=left|Indiana |- |16 | align=left|Utah |- |17 | align=left|Wisconsin |- |18 | align=left|Notre Dame |- |19 | align=left|LSU |- |20 | align=left|Vanderbilt |- |21 | align=left|Baylor |- |22 | align=left|Butler |- |23 | align=left|West Virginia |- |24 | align=left|UConn |- |25 | align=left|Purdue |} |} |} ==Regular season== ===Early season tournaments=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !

The team with the best regular-season record in each conference is given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. All conferences also recognize regular-season champions, with co-championships being awarded in the case of ties. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. For the final time, the Ivy League did not hold a conference tournament, instead giving its automatic invitation to its regular season champion. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Conference !Regular season
