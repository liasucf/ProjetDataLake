    "text": "El Juicio (The Judgement) is an album by pianist Keith Jarrett recorded in 1971 and released in 1975. On four days in July and one in August 1971 Jarrett went into the Atlantic Recording Studios with his trio (Charlie Haden and Paul Motian) plus Dewey Redman on tenor saxophone and produced enough music for three albums The Mourning of a Star (released in 1971), El Juicio (The Judgement) and Birth (released in 1972). Accordingly, the 1971 sessions mark the emergence of what would be later called Jarrett's \"American quartet.\" As a full member, Redman would not join the working group until 1972 and the new formation's first album to make it into the public arena would be Birth. When Atlantic Records released \"El Juicio\" in 1975 the group had already signed with Impulse! and was steadily recording under that label. ==Track listing== :All compositions by Keith Jarrett # \"Gypsy Moth\" - 8:18 # \"Toll Road\" - 5:44 # \"Pardon My Rags\" - 2:43 # \"Pre-Judgement Atmosphere\" - 2:35 # \"El Juicio\" - 10:22 # \"Piece for Ornette (L.V.)\" - 9:16 # \"Piece for Ornette (S.V.)\" - 0:12 ==Personnel== *Keith Jarrett - piano, soprano saxophone, steel drums, percussion *Dewey Redman - tenor saxophone, alto sax (on Gypsy Moth), steel drums, percussion *Charlie Haden - double bass, steel drums, percussion *Paul Motian - drums, steel drums, percussion == References == Category:1971 albums Category:Keith Jarrett albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Albums produced by George Avakian ",
