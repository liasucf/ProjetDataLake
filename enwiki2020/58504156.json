Doris Turner, who began as principal of the Aquinas system circa 2003, became the principal of Holy Trinity after the merger. The Marquette building was chosen for junior high school while the Aquinas building was chosen for senior high school. At the time 131 students were at the secondary level in Aquinas. The merger was due to increasing costs and the declining population of Lee County, the latter of which meant reduced numbers of pupils. ==Athletics== The Herald-Whig wrote that \"Aquinas and Marquette have been spirited rivals for years.\" ==References== ==External links== * * - At Great River Area Education Agency 16 Category:Catholic secondary schools in Iowa Category:Catholic high schools in the United States Category:Catholic middle schools in the United States Category:Catholic elementary schools in the United States Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport Category:Schools in Lee County, Iowa Category:2005 disestablishments in Iowa Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2005 Category:Private middle schools in Iowa Category:Private elementary schools in Iowa Category:Fort Madison, Iowa ",
