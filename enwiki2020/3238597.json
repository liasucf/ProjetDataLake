    "text": "Telecom Argentina S.A. is the major local telephone company for the northern part of Argentina, including the whole of the city of Buenos Aires. Briefly known as Sociedad Licenciataria Norte S.A., it quickly changed its name, and is usually known as simply \"Telecom\" within Argentina. Together with Telef\u00f3nica de Argentina in the southern part of the country, was part of the national fixed telephone market duopoly, until 8 October 1999. Telecom also operates the mobile phone service Personal, the cable modem service Arnet- Fibertel and the cable operator Cablevisi\u00f3n. ==History== Telecom building in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. In 1990, Argentina started to privatize most of its state-owned utilities: power, water, trains, and telecommunications, just to name a few. The monopoly of state-owned phone service ENTel was split into two territories: France T\u00e9l\u00e9com was given the \"upper half\" of the country, from the middle to the north, and Telef\u00f3nica was given the southern part. Each company was given an initial 7 year monopoly beginning on November 8, 1990. Initially, other companies were given exclusive licenses for international long distance, as well as cellular phone service. France T\u00e9l\u00e9com later sold its part of the company to the Argentine Werthein Group. Its Puerto Madero headquarters were designed by the American architectural studio of Kohn Pedersen Fox, and inaugurated on February 18, 1998.https://www.emporis.com/buildings/119699/torre-telecom-buenos-aires- argentina Both local phone companies turned their systems into profitable operations in just a few years, despite the terrible conditions they inherited from ENTel. In the worst years of ENTel, a line activation would take several years. The telephone wiring layout across the country was undocumented. At privatization in 1990, the wait was still 4 years to get new service and 40 days for repair.https://institucional.telecom.com.ar/inversores/ Starting off Telecom Argentina invested into the country and during the first 8 years of strong investment in infrastructure deployment at a rate a little less than a billion u$s per year, with a complete restructuring of the copper access network and the deployment of one of the most advanced and large deployment of SDH long-distance fiber network at those times 2.5Gbit/s networks, and the upgrade of almost all centrall offices, most of them electromechanical and also some manual small exchanges. Some years later, all of the phone network was upgraded to a state-of-the-art system, from central telephone exchanges up to the wires going into homes; by 2005, 98% of the ENTel network infrastructure had been replaced. In 2005, the Bank of New York was appointed as trustee, registrar and paying and transfer agent for Telecom Argentina's $1.5 billion debt restructuring, the biggest Argentine debt restructuring to date. The restructure involved the exchange of $2.8 billion in outstanding debt for newly issued exchange notes and cash, and involved consent requests and instructions for over 1100 creditors. ==Personal== Logo of Personal, the mobile-phone division of Telecom Argentina. \"Telecom Personal\", owned by Telecom Argentina, is one of only 3 mobile phone companies in Argentina. Personal used a similar logo to Telecom itself until November 2011, when they switched into a new handwritten logo combined with nine brand colors.Personal presenta un nuevo logo y desarrollo de identidad de marca - iprofesional.com, November 7, 2011Telecom Personal se renueva con un logotipo personalizado para cada usuario - Pienso Logo Existo, November 14, 2011 Telecom Personal owns 67.5% of Paraguayan mobile provider N\u00facleo S.A., which started in 1998 and also does business under the brand name Personal. Telecom Argentina has agreed with Uruguayan state telcom ANTEL to operate as a reseller of Antel services in that country. Mexican mobile phone Claro has asked the national telecommunications regulating entity not to allow Personal to arrive to Uruguay.Un recurso de Claro traba ingreso de otra telef\u00f3nica m\u00f3vil en Uruguay - El Pa\u00eds, August 28, 2009 ==Ownership== As of 2019, current approximate ownership of Telecom Argentina is:Estructura del capital , Telecom Argentina. *31.53% Fintech Telecom LLC *18.75% Cablevisi\u00f3n Holding S.A. (CVH) *20.06% VLG S.A.U. *29.65% publicly traded *0.01% Class C shares ==Criticism== Critics of Telecom argue that, when it received government subsidies to provide service in remote areas, it either didn't provide the service, or just installed public telephones. Critics also point to the high prices charged by the company, and to the fact that, unlike much of the world, Argentine customers have to pay per minute, rather than a fixed price. In contrast, defendants of the system point out that the 011 area code (called AMBA, most of Gran Buenos Aires) provides local phone access to five to six million users (15-16% of the total population of the country), making a flat-rate type of service economically impossible. Due to the lack of long requested flat telephone rates for local calls, specially to connect to Internet, a lot of users installed ADSL services from Arnet, Telecom's Internet service provider. The company was heavily criticised when it decided to limit ADSL users to 4 GB per month and charge for extra traffic, a decision which was promptly reversed. Other critics to the company are centred on the lack of information on their offers, and obscure contracts with prices not including taxes, and other important information. ==See also== *Argentine telephone numbering plan *Communications in Argentina ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1990 Category:Companies based in Buenos Aires Category:Communications in Paraguay Category:Telecommunications companies of Argentina Category:Buildings and structures in Buenos Aires Category:1990 establishments in Argentina Category:Internet service providers of Argentina Category:Argentine brands ",
