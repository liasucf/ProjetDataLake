Journal of Japanese Botany 9(2): 83.Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database, University of Melbourne., Sorting Shibataea names It is a unique shorter bamboo with dark green leaves. This genus of small bamboos are more closely related to the genus Phyllostachys than other small bamboos. An excellent tall groundcover or short hedge, this species is especially suited to climates similar to that of the Pacific Northwest since it dislikes dry climates. The bamboo does not do well with alkaline or water- logged soil. It needs acidic conditions to prevent leaf burn. It is sometimes called Ruscus-leaved bamboo, as the shape of the leaves resembles that of the genus Ruscus. This bamboo is very resistant to bamboo mites. It is used to make canes.Flora of China Vol. 22 Page 161 \u9e45\u6bdb\u7af9\u5c5e e mao zhu shu Shibataea Makino ex Nakai, J. Jap.
