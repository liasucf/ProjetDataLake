Beginning in 1930, publications on the Gbe languages rapidly appeared, the vast majority on individual Gbe languages. Capo set out a classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the phonology of proto-Gbe. Much of the comparative research for this classification was carried out by Capo in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the 1970s and early 1980s as articles on specific phonological developments in various branches of the Gbe dialectal continuum, and notably as a standard spelling for Gbe languages. His first major work, Renaissance du Gbe (1988), published a classification of the Gbe languages for the first time. In 1991, he published Comparative phonology of Gbe. In this period, he also founded the Labo Gbe (Int.), the Laboratoire de recherche sur les langues Gbe (Research Laboratory on Gbe Languages) based in Benin, which promotes research and has published several articles and documents on Gbe languages. The Labo Gbe, in Gadom\u00e8 on the Cotonou-Lom\u00e9 road 40 km from Cotonou, has an impressive collection of documentation and a scientific journal titled Etudes Gbe \u2013 Gbe Studies. == Publications == * 1982: Hounkpati B.C.
