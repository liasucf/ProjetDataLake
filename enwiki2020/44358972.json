    "text": "John Holland (born 1944) is an American composer, author, performer, and recording artist. He is Professor Emeritus in the Studio for Interrelated Media at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. Holland headed the Electronic Music Studio and taught music and performance classes before he retired from teaching in 2009. ==Background== John Holland (website) grew up in midwest Ohio where he was surrounded by music and athletics. In the 1950s he was a boy soprano, soloing regularly in church and on television. His father Kenneth was a well-known conductor and composer, and a famed basketball star in high school and college. Before retiring from teaching in 2010, his brother David, a Big Ten quarterback at Indiana University in the 1960s, taught viola at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan and was conductor of the Traverse City Symphony Orchestra. Holland's sister, Marla Rathbun, is a professional violinist specializing in contemporary music. Growing up, American conductor Dennis Russell Davies, a contemporary and friend of Holland, conductor of the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra and principal conductor of the music of Philip Glass, was a regular at the Holland house, studying music theory with Holland's father, and playing chamber music. In the early 1960s, Holland befriended Joseph Kossuth, also a Toledo native, one of the pioneers of American conceptual art. Holland's artistic influences include Charles Ives, Elliott Carter, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen; music, literature, science, art. ==Music== Holland has produced a variety of acoustic, digital, and electronic music. Holland has composed electronic music since the 1970s. Some of the music is referred to today as \u2018mixups\u2019, often mixing unlikely musical elements. The popularity of some of these \u2018mixups\u2019 is due to their reflection of current world issues in which people are still learning to live together with differing cultures. Holland's music has been performed largely in Boston and New York City. He has produced a number of recordings, and has published music scores for most solo instruments (with and without digital modification), chamber music, songs, music for orchestra, concertos, operas. For a number of years Holland has produced a \u2018live\u2019 music series in Boston, New Music at the Pozen Center, that mixes contemporary and electronic music with innovative performative features. In addition he is founder and producer of The Chocolate Ear online music series. Holland has produced many online recordings, including Symbiotica - A Cross-Cultural Mixup Vols. 1 and 2., The Continents, Listen, and The Musical Landscape. The Adam and Eve Diaries, A Web Opera based on Mark Twain's The Diaries of Adam and Eve is perhaps the first opera of its kind to be composed for the Web. In many of these recordings, there are original complementary texts that precede various musical pieces and that were intended to be read aloud in a \u2018live\u2019 setting. The texts complement the music in ways that may change the way we hear the music. In 1997 Holland produced the first comprehensive full color poster-size Acoustic Wave Spectrum. It was later presented at the MIT Media Lab and in 2007 producer and composer DJ Spooky attached it to his audio CD companion to Sound Unbound. John Schaefer, host of New Sounds on WNYC Radio in New York cited Holland's Natural Phenomena as \u201cone of the notable CD\u2019s of 2005.\u201dRichard Perry, music critic, writes \u201cMr. Holland\u2019s music has a compelling, insistent fascination\u2026\u201d Tia Kimberk says \u201cJohn Holland\u2019s music is often based on extra- musical ideas related to science and nature. Listening to the music informs us about ourselves and our larger context in the world.\u201d In 1982 Holland was interviewed on National Public Radio for his recording of Music for a Small Planet in Three Parts. The composer's scores and texts are published by American Sound Press. All of Holland's online music recordings and writing projects are free, and whenever possible presented without advertisement. Many scores are freely downloadable. Website: === Integer music === In the 1970s Holland developed a compositional technique known as 'Integer Music' that features integer groups in which an integer represents a group of musical tones, each operating independently of other groups. The integer groups generally range from 1 thru 26 tones, which conveniently correlates with the English alphabet, making it possible to construct musical scores that are based on specific non-musical ideas. The player is asked to provide specific tones within each group, while the composer creates the form and structure of the work, typically supplying remarks as to how each group is to be expressed. Many of the composer's scores, including music for solo instruments (with and without signal processing), chamber music, and music for voice, involve the use of integer notation. In much of his piano music, integer notation is combined with fragments of standard notation, creating a mix of complexity and order, a theme found throughout Holland's music. There is also music with standard notation that explores the theoretical aspects of the western musical scale, such as Mapping the Musical Genome, and String Quartet No. 4. === Organizations === Holland founded the American Soundgroup in 1974, which was in residence at Massachusetts College of Art and Design from 1975 to 1985. In 1986 he founded and directed the Text-Sound Chorus in Boston. In the early 1980s Holland co-founded Nature and Inquiry, an artists group that met weekly to discuss ideas in art and science. The group has presented work at the MIT Media Lab, the Harvard Smithsonian Observatory, Habitat Institute, Copley Society of Art, and Axiom Gallery. He also taught a class for three decades that introduced artists to leading-edge ideas in science. == Works == ===Online recordings=== The online recordings (mp3's) are freely available to libraries on audio CD's (.aif\u2019s) with liner notes linked to the online sites. * The Continents http://jhthecontinents.wordpress.com * Change is Here To Stay Music for Fixed Media http://changeisheretostay.wordpress.com * Listen Music for Fixed Media http://jhlisten.wordpress.com * Incidents of Sudden Awareness Music for Fixed Media http://jhincidents.wordpress.com * A Piano Album http://jhpianoalbum.wordpress.com/ * Five Natures http://jhfivenatures.wordpress.com/ * The Musical Landscape http://themusicallandscape.wordpress.com/ * Symbiotica - A Cross-Cultural Mixup, Vols. 1 and 2 http://musicasymbiotica.com/ (Vol. 1) http://musicasymbiotica2.wordpress.com (Vol. 2) * Space and Time Music for Violin and Piano http://violinandpiano.wordpress.com * Pioneers of Electronic Music / Symphony of Etudes http://pioneersofmusic.wordpress.com * The Adam and Eve Diaries A Web Opera http://adamandeveopera.wordpress.com * The Nautilus An Online Video Opera http://thenautilusopera.com/ * Keyboard Etudes for Synthesizers Nos. 1-24 (Enhanced 2012 Version) http://keyboardetudes.wordpress.com * Robotic Dances / Inquiries for Computer- controlled Synthesizers http://roboticdances.wordpress.com * Music from a Small Planet (in Three Parts) http://musicfromasmallplanet.wordpress.com * The Chocolate Ear An Online Classical Music Series - Music of Interest Mixed with the Sublime http://chocolateear.com/ === Online writing projects=== Holland has created performance texts designed to be read aloud, including Phenomena: Simple Descriptions of Complex Phenomena, Complete Short Texts for Speaking Voice, Strategies for Survival (with Complementary Music), and Facts of Life (with Complementary Music), all of which contain subjects related to nature, science and art.
