    "text": "{| |} The Drottningholm is a Swedish steam ship that was built in 1909 at Motala Verkstads Nya AB as the Valkyrian, and was also briefly known as the Nya Str\u00f6mma Kanal. Given her current name in 1969, she now operates cruises and charters for the Str\u00f6mma Kanalbolaget and is a listed historic ship of Sweden. == History == Valkyrian was built by the Motala Verkstads Nya AB in Motala and delivered in May 1909 to the Stockholms \u00c5ngslups AB of Stockholm for use on a service between Stockholm and Liding\u00f6. She was a sister ship to Angantyr, built the same year. She was rebuilt in 1914 with an upper deck superstructure. In 1918, Valkyrian was sold to Waxholms Nya \u00c5ngfartygs AB, better known as Waxholmsbolaget. In the 1940s a new boiler was fitted, and the upper deck was remodelled with a large seating area in 1949. In 1964, she was sold back to Stockholms \u00c5ngslups AB, who sold her to J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gs AB Stockholm - Saltsj\u00f6n the following year. In 1968, she was sold to a private individual, who renamed her Nya Str\u00f6mma Kanal and hired her to \u00c5ngfartygs AB Str\u00f6mma Kanal, better known as Str\u00f6mma Kanalbolaget. In this guise, she was intended for use on the service between Stockholm and Sandhamn via the Str\u00f6mma canal, but she proved to have too deep a draught for that route. In 1969, Nya Str\u00f6mma Kanal was sold to Drottningholms \u00c5ngfartygs AB, who renamed her Drottningholm and remodelled her, with a dining room on the upper deck. The same year, she started serving the Stockholm to Drottningholm route. In 1980, she was badly damaged in a fire that broke out whilst she was moored at her berth in Stockholm; the fire also spread to the moored alongside. Drottningholm was subsequently sold to M\u00e4lar\u00f6arnas \u00c5ngfartygs AB, and, after reconstruction, returned to service with Str\u00f6mma Kanalbolaget in 1982. == Operation == The Drottningholm is operated by Str\u00f6mma Kanalbolaget in the Stockholm area, principally on services on Lake Malaren from Stockholm to Drottningholm Palace. She has a length of , a beam of and a draft of . She has a top speed of and carries 150 passengers. ==References== Category:1909 ships Category:Passenger ships of Sweden Category:Ships built in Sweden ",
