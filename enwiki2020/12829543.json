    "text": "Operation Pelikan (), also known as Projekt 14, was a German plan for crippling the Panama Canal during World War II. In mid-late 1943 the Wehrmacht had completed preparations to haul two Ju 87 Stukas with folding wings on two U-boats to an unnamed Colombian island near the coast of Panama, reassemble the planes, arm them with \"special bombs\", and then send them to attack the Gatun Dam. After completing the mission, the pilots would fly to a neutral country and seek internment. However, Germany called off the plan, for unknown reasons, at the last minute. Rumors among the Germans who planned the sabotage were that it had been called off due to betrayal. Most of these types of plans involved acts of sabotage using agents in place and/or landed by U-boat. ==See also== * Panama during World War II * Colombia during World War II * Panama Canal strike * Operation Bolivar ==References== Category:World War II espionage Category:Military history of Germany during World War II Category:Military history of Panama during World War II Category:Military history of the United States during World War II Category:1943 in Germany Category:1943 in Colombia Category:Nazis in South America ",
