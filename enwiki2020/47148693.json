The original inhabitants of the area are believed to have spoken Finnish, which was unique for the time. The name \"Kivist\u00f6\" was coined by them, and it is thought to be in reference to the inarable exposed granite bedrock common to the area. The existing farmland in Kivist\u00f6 has been in use since the 17th century, during which time the Linna Manor was constructed there. The first of the contemporary housing in the area was built in the early 1950s. The land was primarily sold by the construction firm Omakiinteist\u00f6 Oy, and settlers were unaware of a nearby radio station, which handled the Finnish government's international shortwave radio communications. Due to radio-frequency interference, the construction of electrical infrastructure in the area was banned, and the district spent its first years without electricity. After three years of complaints and protests, the ban was lifted, and Kivist\u00f6 was permitted electrical power. Protests included the construction of a roadside sign leading into district that read: \"\u00d6ljylamppukyl\u00e4\u2014jo 3 vuotta n. 200 taloa ilman s\u00e4hk\u00f6\u00e4\" or \"Oil Lamp Town\u2014already 3 years of about 200 houses without electricity\". ==Amenities== The Kivist\u00f6 school Kivist\u00f6 railway station Kivist\u00f6 has its two public schools, five day care businesses, and a nursing home specializing in dementia care. In 2015, the Kivist\u00f6 railway station was opened as a part of the Ring Rail Line. The rail connects Kivist\u00f6 to downtown Helsinki, as well as Helsinki Airport and Tikkurila. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Districts of Vantaa Category:Major regions of Vantaa Category:Vantaa ",
