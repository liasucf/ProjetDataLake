    "text": "Maria Hinze is a German visual artist with the main focus in painting and drawing. Born in 1981, she studied in Vienna at the Academy of Fine Arts under Walter Obholzer, in Leipzig at the Academy of Fine Arts in the class of Neo Rauch and Astrid Klein and in D\u00fcsseldorf in the class of Tal R. She has produced multimedia works and exhibited together with the light technicians Hans Leser (HAU) and Martin Schwemin (Rimini Protokoll) at Souterrain-Berlin, with filmmaker Johann Lurf and painter Florian Schmidt and other artists in the Pinacoteca Vienna. She has worked on interdisciplinary projects with Raymond Pettibon (for the art book \"Dem neuen Himmel eine neue Erde\"), Simon Faithfull, Taka Kagitomi and Camilla Richter and musicians such as Etkin Cekin (Istanbul), Mike Moya (Montreal) and M. Rux (Berlin). == Life and career == Hinze's artistic approach touches on contemporary and historical discourses about art and architecture, which she transfers into new formats, such as at the Archiv Massiv in Leipzig, at Acud Macht Neu and Plattenpalast in Berlin, the BMW branch at Alte Messe in Leipzig or at Haus Blumenthal, H\u00e4ndelallee 67 in Berlin's Hansaviertel district. She currently lives and works in Berlin (Germany) and Montreal (Canada) with her partner musician Mike Moya (Godspeed You! Black Emperor) and their family. == Education == 2009\u20132010 Studied painting, D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy, Prof. Tal R 2005\u20132008 Studied painting and graphic design, Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig, Prof. Neo Rauch \u2013 Degree in Fine ArtWeltkunst Contemporary, Ausgabe 03 September 2006 (pp 30/31) 2004\u20132005 Studied art, Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig, Prof. Astrid Klein 2002\u20132004 Studied art, Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, Prof. Walter Obholzer 2000\u20132002 Studied art history, Humboldt University Berlin == Work == In her work, Hinze tackles the complexity of varying methods and approaches in order to question pictorial spaces and visual content. She is interested in finding independent structural and aesthetic means, via which her work can challenge the power of drawing and painting to influence the observer, the materiality of the line in contrast to the pictorial surface and the possible multidimensionality of both media. The transition between media influences the very core of her work. She examines the potential meaning of drawing and painting in the liminal zones between the drawn line and the painted surface in tangible surroundings,Aesthetica Magazine issue 61, Oct/Nov 2014 (pp 141) ISSN 1743-2715 as she does between an artistic mind-set and a sphere of social activity. Thematically, her work deals with concepts such as presence and permeability, visibility and invisibility, and disappearance, all from the most variant perspectives. These aspects are examined as moments of motion, as moments of appearance and acts of concealment. Maria Hinze's work is concerned with the relationship between humans and their surroundings. The human body functions as a physical medium for storing both the conscious and subconscious. Hinze comprehends herself as a storage medium for images of a world of language and form, which is rooted in the subconscious and, as such, precedes her own thought structures \u2013 intangible knowledge is translated into language and tangible space.
