The Mountains of Wales (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1985)Nuttall, John & Anne (1999). The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. . == Features == Its appearance when viewed from the south-west, i.e. from the direction of Porthmadog, has earned it the sobriquet the \"Matterhorn of Wales\", albeit being 3,789 metres lower. In reality Cnicht is a long ridge and, at 689 m, is the fifth-highest peak in the Moelwynion mountain range. It can be easily ascended from Croesor, the village at its foot, or, with more difficulty, from Nant Gwynant to the north-west. Although rightly regarded by most people as a mountain in its own right, there are compilers of lists who consider that it does not in fact have enough prominence to separate it from its parent Allt-fawr in spite of over 110m of re-ascent and a distance of more than 4 km. Hence it is not regarded as a Marilyn. == Toponymy == The mountain gets its name from the old English word 'knight', the silent 'k' being pronounced at that time. It is said that the shape of the mountain bears a similarity to a knight's helmet. == In fiction == It appears as the \"Saeth\" in Patrick O'Brian's 1952 novel Three Bear Witness (published as Testimonies in the USA), which is set in a fictionalised version of Cwm Croesor. O'Brian and his wife lived in the valley between 1946 and 1949. ==References== ==External links== *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Cnicht and surrounding area Category:Mountains and hills of Snowdonia Category:Hewitts of Wales Category:Nuttalls Category:Mountains and hills of Gwynedd Category:Beddgelert Category:Llanfrothen ",
