    "text": "The MG ZR is an MG branded \"hot hatch\" version of the Rover 25 supermini class car, produced by MG Rover at their Longbridge plant in Birmingham from 2001 to 2005. Compared to the Rover 25, the ZR featured a number of styling modifications and performance enhancements, such as updated sports suspension and a less baffled exhaust. ==Reception== The MG ZR was one of Britain's most popular sporting hatchbacks throughout its production life, and in 2004, it was MG Rover's best selling car--the first time that any MG product had been the most popular product of any of the many combines that had owned the MG marque. Tens of thousands of MG ZRs were sold in Britain and proved particularly popular with young buyers who were attracted by deals such as free insurance and discounts that were the equivalent of VAT. The car was made until April 2005. While its handling was praised by reviewers, other aspects of the ZR were found to be inadequate. ==Performance== A five door MG ZR The entry level ZR 105 came with the 16 valve 1.4 K series engine which produced and torque giving a 0\u201360 mph time of 9.7 seconds and a top speed of .

The ZR TD 115 also came equipped with disc brakes at both the front and the rear sharing its brake set up with the ZR 120, whereas the ZR TD 100 had drums at the back, sharing its brake set up with the ZR 105. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:100%;\" |- !colspan=9|Petrol engines |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Years !Model !Engine !Power !Torque !Top Speed !0\u201362 mph (0\u2013100 km/h) !Economy |- |2001\u20132005||1.4 105 Manual||1,396 cc \u2013 L4 \u2013 NA||||||||10.0 s|| |- |2001\u20132005||1.8 120 Manual||1,796 cc \u2013 L4 \u2013 NA||||||||8.6 s|| |- |2001\u20132005||1.8 120 Steptronic||1,796 cc \u2013 L4 \u2013 NA||||||||9.5 s|| |- |2001\u20132005||1.8 160 VVC Manual||1,796 cc \u2013 L4 \u2013 NA||||||||7.4 s|| |- !colspan=9|Diesel engines |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Years !Model !Engine !Power !Torque !Top Speed !0\u201362 mph (0\u2013100 km/h) !Economy |- |2001\u20132005||2.0 TD Manual||1,994 cc \u2013 L4 \u2013 TC||||||||9.7 s || |- |2001\u20132005||2.0 TD 115 Manual||1,994 cc \u2013 L4 \u2013 TC||||||||9.1 s || |- |} ==MG Express== The MG Express was produced alongside the MG ZR as a car derived van. It had the same trim options and running gear as the MG ZR, with a reinforced loadspace floor and bulkhead fitted instead of the rear seats, and the rear side windows replaced with bonded panels. A total of 317 Express vans were produced.MG ZR 105 and MG Express Van, www.mgownersclub.co.uk Retrieved 11 May 2018 ==Facelift== Facelift MG ZR+ 105 Facelift MG ZR+ 105 In January 2004, the ZR was facelifted with the rest of the MG Rover range, the new design was created by Peter Stevens, who also designed the McLaren F1. A new, more modern look was given to the car through new front and rear bumpers, headlights, tailgate, and various other exterior features. The 2004 model also received a revised interior with new seat materials and a new dashboard design incorporating soft touch buttons. This gave the cars a far more modern feel and matched the clean, more angular lines of the exterior. The facelifted ZR also saw the introduction of the Trophy and Trophy SE models. The MG ZR Trophy features a sunroof, 16 inch 'Grid spoke' alloy wheels, new rear light clusters, leather steering wheel, and side sill and rear bumper extensions. The Trophy SE features 17 inch 'Straights' alloy wheels and has air conditioning in the place of a sunroof. Under the Monogram program, buyers could also select a wide range of options to customize their ZR, such as choosing optional extras from the Rover 25 list. An example of this is rear parking sensors or heated seats. == MG ZR in rallying == MG Sport & Racing developed a number of MG ZRs to be used in club and national rallying. MG Sport & Racing signed Gwyndaf Evans, Tony Jardine and Natalie Barratt to compete in a number of events. A number of MG ZR's still compete in national rallying events, and the 2007 Rally of GB event saw Luke Pinder racing a ZR in the N1 class, and despite not driving the car before the event, he led the class after day one and went on to win his class. == MG ZR in racing == The MG ZR facelift in competition MG Sport & Racing built two MG ZR 160's to Group N Specification for the 2003 National Saloon Car Championship. After only two events, and due to poor grids, the 'Team Airconstruct' cars were modified with dry break refueling systems and entered into the EERC Britcar Endurance Series run by James Tucker. Driven by car owner John Hammersley and teenager Andrew Dunlop, car #34 was a late entry into the Series, with only eight races remaining. In a remarkable season, the Hammersley/Dunlop pairing scored maximum points in Britcar Class 4 in seven out of eight events, missing out on the overall title, and a perfect score, by only two points to Andy Rouse in a DTM Mercedes, and Calum Lockie in a BMW M3. John Hammersley with son Mark took the Series win in the following year with the car, which had by then been upgraded to 'works' specification , Group N+ Spec. The MG ZR is now raced in the MGCC in two classes, 160s and 190. === MG Car Club MG Trophy Championship === The MG Trophy is a single make club championship in the United Kingdom offering close racing for the front wheel drive MG ZR in three classes. In 2014, the MG Car Club MG Trophy Championship saw the introduction of the \u2018new\u2019 160 class (D) for basic road-going ZR160 cars. The previous 160 class (C) was upgraded with an ECU remap and other changes and rebranded as the 170 class. Both these changes proved to be winners, with four of the new 160's and 19 170's racing. ==MG Rover collapse== In April 2005, MG Rover's proposed takeover by SAIC collapsed, and the company went into receivership. Nanjing Automobile eventually bought the company's assets three months later, but when the MG range was relaunched in April 2007, the ZR and ZS were not included in the model range. It was replaced by the MG3 SW in 2008, sold to the Chinese market only. In 2010, SAIC announced a new MG3 concept car to replace the ZR, which was due to enter the United Kingdom at the end of 2011. It was expected to come with a 1.3 or 1.5 engine. ==References== == External links == *Video HD prueba en banco de potencia MG ZR 160 MKII *Rovertech - The MG and Rover Enthusiast Community *The MG ZR Owners Club Forum *MGZR Forum *Official MG- Rover website *MG Car Club (MGCC) ZR/ZS/ZT register website *MGCC ZR/ZS/ZT register, ZR representative's website. *MG Owners Club website ZR Category:Sport compact cars Category:Cars introduced in 2001 Category:Hatchbacks Category:Hot hatches Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles ",
