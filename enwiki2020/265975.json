    "text": "Sid and Nancy (also known as Sid and Nancy: Love Kills) is a 1986 British biographical film directed by Alex Cox, co-written with Abbe Wool, and starring Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb. The film portrays the life of Sid Vicious, bassist of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols, and his destructive relationship with girlfriend Nancy Spungen. The film also features supporting performances from David Hayman, Xander Berkeley, and Courtney Love. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986, and was released theatrically in the United States later that year. Despite failing to recoup its production budget at the box office, the film was received positively by most critics and developed a cult following. ==Plot== On 12 October 1978, police are summoned to the Hotel Chelsea in New York City, where they find Nancy Spungen, dead. Her boyfriend, Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious, is taken into custody. Nancy's friend, Gretchen, mourns her as paramedics remove her body. Sid is driven to a police station and upon arrival is asked to describe what happened. Police officers become frustrated when Sid is visibly troubled and unable to speak. A little more than a year earlier, in 1977, close friends and band members Sid and Johnny Rotten meet Nancy, a heroin-addicted American groupie who had come to London to bed the Sex Pistols. Sid dismisses her at first, as her intentions are obvious, but begins dating her after feeling sympathy for the rejection she faces from fellow punk performers. The two swiftly bond over heroin use, and it is implied that Nancy introduces Sid to the drug. Sid and Nancy fall deeply in love, but their self-destructive, drug-fueled relationship frays Sid's relationship with the rest of the band. Nancy is distraught when Sid departs on a month-long American tour without her. The tour is notably disastrous, with Sid strung out of his mind, often drunk or on methamphetamine, and physically violent. Phoebe, Sid's friend and road manager, unsuccessfully attempts to help him stop drinking. Meanwhile, Nancy remains in London, staying with her friend Linda, a dominatrix. Although several of Sid's friends and acquaintances warn him of Nancy's devastating effect on his life, Sid stubbornly ignores these warnings. On 17 January 1978, in the midst of the group's American tour, the band breaks up. Sid reunites with Nancy in New York City, and he attempts to start a solo career with Nancy as his manager. The two visit Paris to begin recording sessions, but the trip is unfruitful. Sid is quickly dismissed in the music industry as a has-been, and he and Nancy descend deeper into heroin addiction; Nancy also begins suffering from severe depression, and the couple eventually make a suicide pact. Nancy brings Sid to Philadelphia to meet her family, who are horrified by the couple's reckless behavior and physical state. Sid and Nancy return to New York and settle in the Hotel Chelsea, where they isolate in squalor and depend on opiates supplied by their drug dealer, Bowery Snax. Their love affair ends tragically one night when, during an argument in which Sid announces his plans to stop using heroin and return to England to restart his life, a suicidal Nancy begs him to kill her. She attacks him and they fight in a drug-induced haze, leading to him stabbing her, although whether it was intentional is left to interpretation. They fall asleep and later Nancy awakes and stumbles into the bathroom, where she collapses and dies. Sid is bailed out temporarily by his mother, who is also a heroin addict. After getting a pizza, some kids convince him to dance with them. Some time later, a taxi picks Sid up and he believes he finds Nancy alive in the back seat. The two embrace as the cab drives off. A postscript says that Vicious died of a heroin overdose, and lastly reads: \"R.I.P. Nancy and Sid.\" ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== The film, originally titled Love Kills, is largely based on the mutually destructive, drug- and sex-filled relationship between Vicious and Nancy. Vicious' mother, Anne Beverley, initially tried to prevent the film from being made. After meeting with director Cox, however, she decided to help the production; for example, Beverley gave Oldman Vicious' own heavy metal chain and padlock to wear in the film. Some of the supporting characters are composites, invented to streamline the plot. ===Casting=== According to director Cox, he had originally considered Daniel Day-Lewis for the part of Sid Vicious; however, Cox offered Oldman the part of Vicious after seeing him play the lead role of Scopey in a 1984 production of Edward Bond's The Pope's Wedding. Oldman twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: \"I wasn't really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I'd never followed it. It wasn't something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and 'who cares' and 'why bother' and all of that. And I was a little bit sort-of with my nose in the air and sort-of thinking 'well the theatre \u2013 so much more superior' and all of that.\" He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent.Gary Oldman interview by Terry Gross. Fresh Air. National Public Radio. 12 February 1998. He lost weight to play the emaciated Vicious by eating nothing but \"steamed fish and lots of melon\", but was briefly hospitalized when he lost too much. Oldman later dismissed the performance, saying: \"I don't think I played Sid Vicious very well\". Courtney Love recorded a video audition for the role of Spungen. Cox was impressed by Love's audition, but has said the film's investors insisted on an experienced actress for the co-leading role. Therefore, instead, Cox wrote the minor role of Gretchen, one of Sid and Nancy's New York junkie friends, specifically for her benefit. Cox would later cast Love as one of the leads in Straight to Hell (1987). Chloe Webb, who had appeared in several small television roles at the time, was instead cast in the role of Spungen. In his 2007 autobiography, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash revealed that the casting director hired all five members of Guns N' Roses as extras for a club scene, having coincidentally scouted them in different locations without their knowledge. He said \"all of us showed up to the first day of casting, like 'Hey...what are you doing here?'\" However, Slash was the only one in the group to stay for the entire shoot. Webb and Oldman improvised the dialogue heard in the scene leading up to Spungen's death but based it on interviews and other materials available to them. The stabbing scene is fictionalized and based only on conjecture. Cox told the NME: \"We wanted to make the film not just about Sid Vicious and punk rock, but as an anti-drugs statement, to show the degradation caused to various people is not at all glamorous.\" The original music is by Pray for Rain, Joe Strummer, and The Pogues. A track by Tears for Fears (\"Swords and Knives\") was also recorded for the film but was rejected by the filmmakers for not being \"punk\" enough. The track later appeared on the band's Seeds of Love album in 1989. Prominent musicians made appearances in the film including Circle Jerks, Love, Iggy Pop, Nico and Edward Tudor-Pole of Tenpole Tudor. ===Filming=== The film was primarily shot in London and New York City, though additional photography (particularly the sequences of the Sex Pistols' North American tour) was completed in Los Angeles and El Centro, California. ==Release== ===Critical reception=== From the 65 reviews collected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an overall approval rating of 88%, with the consensus: \"Visceral, energetic, and often very sad, Sid & Nancy is also a surprisingly touching love story, and Gary Oldman is outstanding as the late punk rock icon Sid Vicious.\"Sid & Nancy Movie Reviews, Pictures. Rotten Tomatoes Roger Ebert gave Sid and Nancy four-out-of-four in his review for The Chicago Sun-Times, writing that Cox and his crew \"pull off the neat trick of creating a movie full of noise and fury, and telling a meticulous story right in the middle of it.\" Appearing on The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers, Ebert said, to agreement from Rivers and applause from the audience, that Oldman \"definitely won't be [Oscar] nominated \u2013 and should be\", this being for the reason that \"Hollywood will not nominate an actor for portraying a creep, no matter how good the performance is\". In a subsequent article on Oldman, Ebert referred to the movie's titular couple as \"punk rock's Romeo and Juliet.\"Ebert, Roger (1988) Roger Ebert's Four Star Movie Guide, Andrews & McMeel, p. 383. In his book Sid Vicious: Rock N' Roll Star, Malcolm Butt describes Webb's performance as Spungen as \"intense, powerful, and most important of all, believable.\" Oldman's portrayal of Vicious was ranked #62 in Premiere magazine's \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\". Uncut magazine ranked Gary Oldman as #8 in its \"10 Best actors in rockin' roles\" list, describing his portrayal as a \"hugely sympathetic reading of the punk figurehead as a lost and bewildered manchild.\" In 2011, Total Film said of the performance: \"It's an early high point in Oldman's varied career that showed just what the young actor was made of. Playing the part of an icon known and beloved by many comes with its own demands and risks, but Oldman more than rises to the challenge, completely transforming into the troubled punk bassist.\" The magazine described Oldman's rendition of \"My Way\" as \"fantastic \u2013 [it] might even be better than Sid's original version.\"Winning, Josh. Best Movies: The film chameleon\u2019s greatest moments. Total Film. 11 April 2011. Retrieved 4 October 2011. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Sid and Nancy as the third-best rock movie ever made, and in 2014, ShortList named it the ninth-greatest music biopic of all time. Not all reviews of the film were positive. Leslie Halliwell, in a negative appraisal, reiterated a line from a review that appeared in Sight & Sound: \"Relentlessly whingeing performances and a lengthy slide into drugs, degradation and death make this a solemnly off-putting moral tract.\"Halliwell, Leslie (1995) Halliwell's Film Guide: 11th Edition, John Walker (ed.). HarperCollins. p. 1033. . Andrew Schofield was ranked #1 in Uncut magazine's \"10 Worst actors in rockin' roles\", which described his performance as Sex Pistols lead singer Johnny Rotten (real name John Lydon) as a \"short-arse Scouse Bleasdale regular never once looking like he means it\".Uncut magazine, issue #117, February 2007 Commentary on the Criterion DVD dismisses the film's portrayal of Lydon as wholly inaccurate. Paul Simonon of The Clash also criticised the movie for portraying Lydon as \"some sort of fat, bean-slurping idiot.\" Although not a box office success, generating $2,826,523 in the U.S. on a $4 million budget Sid and Nancy has become a cult hit;Chloe Webb.

Retrieved 11 July 2012. ===John Lydon's reaction=== Lydon commented on the film in his 1994 autobiography, Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs: Strummer claimed to have met with Alex Cox for the first time after the completion of the film, at a wrap party,DEATH OF A PUNK \u2013 JOE STRUMMER (1952\u20132002) Clash co-founder dies of heart attack. hightimes.com (2003-01-02) but this is not entirely accurate. The wrap party was the conclusion of the London phase of the filming, which was followed by filming in Los Angeles and New York City, performed by a largely different crew. The pair's meeting involved discussion over soundtrack work for the film, not the film's script. In a later interview, Lydon was asked the question, \"Did the movie get anything right?\" to which he replied: \"Maybe the name Sid.\"Fine, Marshall. Rotten to the Core: An Interview With John Lydon. drdrew.com. Cox's attitude toward his subjects was negative; one of the reasons he was attracted to the project was that he was afraid that if someone else made it, it would portray its subjects as \"real exemplars of Punk, rather than sold-out traitors to it.\" He acknowledged that Lydon's hatred of the movie was \"understandable, given that it was based on incidents from his life and centred around one of his friends.\" Neither original bassist Glen Matlock nor guitarist Steve Jones have been as outspoken about the movie as Lydon, although Lydon claimed that drummer Paul Cook was more upset over the movie than he was. According to Cox, both he and Andrew Schofield (who played Lydon in the film) did meet with Lydon before the filming. According to Cox, Lydon noticed that Schofield was, like Cox, a Liverpudlian, rather than a Londoner like Lydon, and encouraged him to play the part as a Scouser rather than a Londoner. Cox took this as a sign that both of them agreed that it would be better to portray a more fictionalized version of the characters rather than a cold re-telling of facts. Cox claims that Lydon drank heavily at these meetings, which may explain why Lydon did not recall them. Cox stated in a book that contrary to Lydon's claims, his meeting with Schofield was not after the film's completion, but rather before Schofield had even been given the part. He was offered the part the next day. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! Award ! Category ! Recipient(s) !

Much of the film's soundtrack (as opposed to soundtrack album) was composed by Joe Strummer, who was contractually limited to contribute only two songs. He continued to contribute more (unpaid) work because of his interest in the project and composing for film in general. This additional material was credited to fictitious bands in the credits, so as to keep Strummer's label, Epic Records, from knowing what he had done. Another large portion of the music was composed by The Pogues. {| style=\"width:400px;\" class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:silver;\"| Song ! style=\"background:gray;\"| Artist |- | \"Love Kills\" (Title Track) || Joe Strummer |- | \"Haunted\" || The Pogues |- | \"Pleasure and Pain\" || Steve Jones |- | \"Chinese Choppers\" || Pray for Rain |- | \"Love Kills\" || Circle Jerks |- | \"Off the Boat\" || Pray for Rain |- | \"Dum Dum Club\" || Joe Strummer |- | \"Burning Room\" || Pray for Rain |- | \"She Never Took No for an Answer\" || John Cale |- | \"Junk\" || The Pogues |- | \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" || Gary Oldman |- | \"My Way\" || Gary Oldman |- | \"Taxi to Heaven\" || Pray for Rain |} ==Home media== Sid and Nancy was first released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in the late 1990s; this version has since gone out of print.
