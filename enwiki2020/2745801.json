Equipped with a bowed canvas or leather hood, it was used to carry passengers and mail in the days before railways and was one of the fastest means of transport available in the region. Cape carts were developed during the Boer War as a safe way to travel across even rough terrain. The name comes from the Cape of Good Hope. == See also == * Types of carriages Category:Carriages ",
