Judy started performing standup her freshman year at the University of San Diego in 1994. Her first time going up was because the opening act did not show up for a comedy night. She went up for 10 minutes, killed it and when she walked off the stage they handed her a check for $50 thus launching her professional career. She had caught the bug and has been working as a steady comedian ever since. She focuses on being a TV-ready comedian (all her jokes are clean) which enables her to work in front of a variety of audiences. She also is a Catholic Comedian.
