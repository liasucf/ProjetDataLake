Elected on the same ticket as Jesse Ventura in 1998, she became the first Reform Party member elected as lieutenant governor of any state (The party later changed its name to the Independence Party of Minnesota). Prior to her tenure as lieutenant governor, she was a teacher for 37 years. In his memoir, Ventura mentioned that he chose her to \"balance out all the testosterone.\" During her term in office, she visited schools throughout the state and frequently read to students as part of her efforts to encourage literacy and appreciation for reading among young people. In the 2000 presidential campaign, as polls showed Texas Governor George W. Bush and U.S. Vice President Al Gore tied in Minnesota within 2 weeks of Election Day, Schunk endorsed Gore at a rally held on Nicollet Avenue in downtown Minneapolis while Ventura committed himself to a third-party candidate, John Hagelin. In an interview with CNN, Ventura commented that Schunk had asked him before making the endorsement and that he had consented to her decision. Born to Croatian parents, Schunk lives with her husband, William Schunk in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota; they have a son, Benjamin Schunk. Schunk was educated at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.http://www.uwec.edu/newsbureau/release/past/1999/99-02/021699Schunk.html ==Electoral history== *1998 Race for Governor/Lieutenant Governor **Ventura/Schunk (Ref.), 37% **Coleman/Olson (R), 34% **Humphrey/Moe (DFL), 28% ==See also== *List of female lieutenant governors in the United States ==References== ==External links== *Minnesota Historical Society Category:1934 births Category:Lieutenant Governors of Minnesota Category:Living people Category:People from Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota Category:People from Greenwood, Wisconsin Category:American people of Croatian descent Category:Women in Minnesota politics Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire alumni Category:Reform Party of the United States of America politicians Category:Independence Party of Minnesota politicians Category:Schoolteachers from Minnesota ",
