    "text": "The southwestern Utah area is in the Colorado River Basin. Utah's Dixie is the nickname for the moderately populated, lower-elevation area of south-central Washington County in southwestern Utah. Its climate is very mild when compared to the rest of Utah, and typical of the Mojave Desert, in which it lies. Situated south of the Black Ridge and west of the Hurricane Cliffs, in the northeastern edge of the Mojave Desert, it was originally settled by the Southern Paiutes. When recently won from Mexico, it was inhabited by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Mormons in 1854, as part of Brigham Young's efforts to establish an Indian Mission in the region. During the later 1850s, the settlers began growing cotton and other temperate cash crops in the area of Santa Clara, Utah. The Paiute population that had been displaced by the new settlers began to decline due to diseases that the settlers brought and exposed them to. Utah History To Go, American Indians, Paiutes from historytogo.utah.gov accessed December 4, 2015. == The Cotton Mission == The area was first referred to as the \u201cCotton Mission,\u201d in response to Brigham Young\u2019s 14th General Epistle issued in October 1856. In spite of his determination that the Great Basin would be self-sufficient, it was not. He criticized the Saints as \u201cquite negligent in raising cotton and flax.\u201d His command was emphatic: \u201cAnd let our brethren who have the means, bring on cotton and woolen machinery, that we may be enabled to manufacture our own goods, so fast as we shall be able to supply ourselves with the raw material . . . .\u201d === The Origin of the Name \"Dixie\" === \u201c[The] first groups of settlers [arriving in Spring 1857] - the Adair and Covington Companies - were people from the Southern States, mainly from Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia, Texas, and Tennessee.\u201d While there is no indication of slavery in Utah\u2019s cotton farming, Robert Dockery Covington, the leader of the second company of saints, was formerly a slave overseer and owner of eight slaves in the 1840 Census, which made \u201cfarming a very profitable occupation.\u201d A contemporary said: \u201cHe was a strong Rebel sympathizer and rejoiced whenever he heard of a Southern victory.\u201d Covington was the first President of the Washington Branch of the LDS Church. Covington's first counselor was Alexander Washington Collins, who the contemporary says was a former slave driver, who boastfully, with humor, and in public, told horrific stories of whippings and rapes of his slaves. Andrew Larson's landmark history of the area states that in 1857, the area was already taking on the \"Dixie\" nickname: === Meeting Challenges Together === The hardships of this time are inconceivable in light of today's environment of golf courses, fitness spas, retirement, health care, outdoor recreation, vacation homes, an interstate highway, a regional airport, and air conditioning. \"[T]he harsh environment, the intense heat of summer, the continual toil, and the ravages of malaria . . . led some of the settlers to desert the place at the end of the first season.\"I Was Called to Dixie, p. 71. In the fall of 1858, it was reported \"that of approximately 400 acres planted to cotton only 130 acres could be counted a success.\"I Was Called to Dixie, p. 70. Cultivation of cotton and food crops depended on irrigation, which was a collective activity. There were regular food shortages, including \"the 'starving time' when many people were reduced to eating pigweed, alfalfa, and carrot top greens in lieu of a more substantial diet.\"I Was Called to Dixie, p. 75. But the sense of humor was not absent. George A. Hicks wrote a twelve stanza song which was a lament as well as wry comedy: > I feel so weak and hungry now, I think I'm nearly dead. \"Tis seven weeks > next Sunday since I have tasted bread. Of carrot tops and lucern greens we > have enough to eat -- But I'd like to change that diet off for buckwheat > cakes and meat.The Red Hills of November, p. 70. Charles L. Walker, a Latter-day Saint hymnist, wrote a song titled \"St. George and the Drag-on\" with a chorus first line meant to inspire singing along: \"Mesquite, soap root, prickly-pears and briars.\" This verse is the last: > The sun is it so scorching hot, It makes the water siz, Sir. The reason why > it is so hot, Is just because it is, Sir. The wind like fury here does blow, > That when we plant or sow, Sir, We place one foot upon the seed, And hold it > till it grows, Sir. The culture in the time, on a foundation of a shared religion, shared suffering and success, and even a collective economy for a time.I Was Called to Dixie, pp. 290-313. A Mormon Pioneer in a neighboring area gave this expression: This was a challenging task, in significant isolation, in the deserts of Southern Utah. This collective bond is a foundation of what is often called the \"Spirit of Dixie.\" === The End of the Cotton Mission === The Cotton Mission did not work out as well as Young had hoped. Yields in the test fields were not as high as expected, and economic viability of growing cotton was never achieved, although a cotton mill was built and used for a few years in the town of Washington. \u201c[C]onsistent operation of the Factory\u201d ended in 1897.I Was Called to \"Dixie' p. 232. == Widespread Use of \"Dixie\" == Sugarloaf in St. George Utah with 1914 D The name \"Dixie\" was used by residents and others in the state as a shorthand reference to the area. The former St. George Stake Academy officially became Dixie College in 1915.I Was Called to \"Dixie' p. 563. About that time, \u201cDixie\u201d was painted on a red rock on the hill above St. George commonly called the Sugarloaf. Previously, the hill had been painted with the year of the graduating class and a \u201cD\u201d. The \"Dixie Rock\" on the hill served to mark the name. In this time period, the nation was in a wave of nostalgic revisionism (including Lost Cause mythology) that made Dixie and the South an idealization of moonlight and magnolias \"by the many attentions of northern artists to southern mythology, the North's fascination with aristocracy and lost causes, the national appeal of the agrarian myth, and the South's personification of that ideal, to say nothing of the North's persistent use of the South in the manipulation of her own racial mythology.\" Now dozens of institutions and businesses use the name \u201cDixie.\u201d === Devotion to the \"Dixie\" Name === Strong ties to the \u201cDixie\u201d name are felt by descendants of the pioneers, by other long time residents, and by the thousands who are new to the area. \u201cIronically, the many newcomers . . . who recently have come . . . generally are more than pleased to identify with the term \u2018Dixie\u2019.\u201dA History of Washington County, p. 11. Those with long-standing ties to the area, and those who are newer, speak with deep affection of the land as giving you \u201cred sand in your shoes\u201d \u2013 something they feel is unique to that part of Utah. And they know those songs that resonate deep emotion, such as those by Hicks and Walker, mentioned above. A more well known song (adapted from a popular Southern song published in 1915 \"Are You From Dixie?\" ) sung by college students, school children, and former Mayor Daniel D. McArthur, is \u201cAre You From Dixie?\u201d > Are you from Dixie? I said from Dixie! Where the fields of cotton beckon to > me. We\u2019re glad to see ya To say \u2018How be ya?\u2019 And the friends we\u2019re longin\u2019 > to see. If you\u2019re from Santa Clara, Washington Or St. George, fine, Anywhere > below the Iron County line, Then you\u2019re from Dixie, Hurray for Dixie, \u2019Cause > I\u2019m from Dixie, too!\u201d ==== Residents and Descendants ==== Many of the advocates are fifth generation residents of the area, or descendants of those who lived here years ago, who now live in other areas. They speak with a patriotic fervor. Understanding their devotion comes from to understanding their history. They have for years heard stories \u2013 and experienced \u2013 the privations of living in Southwestern Utah. To them, \u201cDixie\u201d in the historical sense means cotton \u2013 a failing enterprise that exhausted their ancestors. Cotton was an expression of faith and solidarity; a commitment to a common cause. But after cotton, \u201cDixie\u201d means home. From the end of Cotton before 1900 to 1950 meant the unique low- lying desert surrounded by high red cliffs and black lava bluffs, bisected by the Virgin River that gave life to people, livestock, fields, and pastures. Utah\u2019s Dixie was so distant from the Wasatch Front, where most of Utah\u2019s population lives, and from the state capital in Salt Lake City that it was a separate existence. Utah\u2019s Dixie had no geographic ties with most of Arizona, only that near-wilderness of the Arizona Strip, north of the Grand Canyon. And while the Virgin Valley area of Nevada had close relations, the historically religious residents of Southwestern Utah did not feel connected to Las Vegas. The area was not connected to much. Roads were rough and rugged until the 1950s and Interstate 15 was only completed in 1973. Air service from St. George began in the late 1950s. Television service came about the same time. The community was small. St. George only had 5,130 inhabitants in 1960 and 11,350 in 1980.St. George, Utah#Demographics. It did not wield much political influence, but it was advanced by exemplary state legislators from the area, such as Orval Hafen. To these long-term residents or descendants, \"Dixie\" is flavored with the College, High School, and lifestyle of a unique area, unlike its state or surrounding states. The St. George UtahSugarloaf newly painted with the word \"Dixie\" ==20th century links to the Confederacy at Dixie State College == It does not appear that links of Southern Utah's Dixie to the Confederacy re-emerged until 1952, when \"Dixie Junior College sports teams adopted 'Rebel' as their nickname and the school made its mascot a Confederate soldier in 1956. By 1960, the Confederate flag was flown as a school symbol.\" This was about the time the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) adopted its \"Rebel\" name and mascot, \"a cartoon wolf with a Confederate uniform.\" This was also in a time when civil rights issues were emerging, between President Truman's integration of the Armed Services in 1948 and Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. On a \u201cparade float called 'Gone With the Plow,' dating from the late 1960s, a man with his skin painted black pushe[d] a plow while a white student, formally dressed with a top hat, [held] what appear to be reins or a whip.\u201d John Jones and Dannelle Larsen-Rife wrote on behalf of the Southern Utah Anti-Discrimination Coalition, listing many Confederacy-related activities at the College: \u201cblack-face minstrel shows (through October 2012), mock slave auctions (through the early 1990s),;;; Confederate flags (continuing to the present), and numerous other associations to the Confederacy prevalent on this campus (The \"Rebel\" mascot as recently as 2008, True Rebel Night is ongoing; The Dixie Confederate Yearbook into the 1990s).\u201d The Salt Lake Tribune recounted photos in old Dixie College yearbooks, called \"The Confederate.\" \u201c[A]s late as the early 1990s [w]hite students sing in black face, dress as Confederate soldiers, stage slave auctions and affectionately display the Confederate battle standard.\u201d The local newspaper 'The Spectrum' reviewed and published excerpts from local newspapers and Dixie College publications that contain Confederate related activities, photographs, and references. In March 1987 and 1988 the community was swept up in a Secession, presided over in 1987 by Governor Norman Bangerter and in 1988 by Wilford Brimley. Events included a Ball in grand Southern style, presided over by costumed Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, who also participated in many publicity photos. A 40-foot Confederate flag hung over St. George Boulevard. Confederate flags were abundantly displayed by city, county and school officials in promotional photographs, and the Washington County News masthead had the Confederate flag and cited its location as \"St. George, Confederate State of Dixie.\". == \"Dixie\" controversy == Controversy over the use of the name \"Dixie\" has repeatedly arisen in the Southern Utah community at large. ===2019-2020 national controversy=== In 2019, Miami-Dade \"county Commissioner Dennis Moss announced he intends to introduce legislation that would rename the portion of Dixie Highway that runs through Miami-Dade.\" \"Moss said the word 'is associated with the Confederacy, slavery, KKK, and those kinds of negative movements that have been a part of our past.'\" He said he was working on legislation that would change all roadways in the county \"that include the word 'Dixie,' which has a very derogatory meaning as it relates to African- Americans.\" In early 2020, the Commission unanimously voted to change the name to Harriett Tubman Highway. The singing group \"Dixie Chicks,\" dropped \"Dixie\" from their name June 25, 2020. The band \"pointed out that they had picked 'that stupid name' as teenagers, and had wanted to change it for years\" and \"said they were moved to change it when they saw the Confederate flag described as 'the Dixie Swastika' on social media in June 2020.\" quoted in The Chicks#2016-93present: MMXVI World Tour, Gaslighter, and name change ===Controversy at Dixie State University=== The Confederate flag was removed as a Dixie College symbol in 1993. In 2005 the Confederate soldier 'Rodney the Rebel' was eliminated as the mascot, and use of the nickname 'Rebels' was discontinued in 2007. In 2007, as Dixie College was considering affiliation with the University of Utah \u201cU. officials said dropping the 'baggage' of Dixie would be mandatory.\" \"'Dixie' has connotations of the Old South, the Confederacy, and racism,\u2019 Randy Dryer, then the U. trustees' chairman, wrote to The Chronicle of Higher Education.\u201d The affiliation with the University of Utah did not happen. In 2012, many articles appeared as the school was about to make \"the leap to university status next year.\" The Salt Lake Tribune editorialized that the school needed a new name based on the pioneer origin of the name, and Confederacy-honoring practices of the students. An African American student told the Tribune he was shocked to find old yearbooks with photos \"of students in blackface, holding mock slave auctions, dressed in Confederate uniforms and staging parade floats and skits that seem to ridicule blacks, such as a crowd in black face behind a white student dressed as a Col. Sanders-type figure. 'In 1968 they were still doing minstrel shows,'\" he said. The college student body president said in 2012 that when \"on recruiting trips to California that he encountered students unwilling to consider studying at a place called Dixie. \"One said, 'Your name makes me shudder,' and walked away ...\" Faculty members who raised the issue complained about being asked to leave the community. In 2015, following the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings by Dylann Roof, Dannelle Larsen-Rife again editorialized for renaming Dixie State University. She was interviewed on an episode of RadioWest (KUER) with professors from the University of Utah and University of Wyoming. A substantial statue of rebel soldiers and a horse, with a Confederate flag displayed, was returned to its sculptor. In 2020, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the emergence of a nationwide series of BlackLivesMatter protests, the issue again returned. Jamie Belnap, a former resident of St. George, wrote \"Now, seven years after the vote at DSU [to retain the Dixie name], murmurings about the name 'Dixie' have begun again. There\u2019s a new petition and, unsurprisingly, online detractors from the community have already begun to emerge.... Isn\u2019t it time DSU sends a message to its students of color that it cares more about equality than nostalgia?\" ===Controversy at Dixie Convention Center=== In 2020, controversy affected the Dixie Convention Center. After a rebranding study, the governing board voted to change the Dixie Center name to Greater Zion Convention Center, consistent with the area's Greater Zion Convention and Tourism Office, which had a name change in 2019. \"The vote to change [the Convention Center name] to Greater Zion on June 23 led to a flood of social media posts and an online petition that gathered over 17,000 signatures in favor of keeping Dixie as the name.\" \"[A]fter a public comment period in which multiple community members expressed strong support of the Dixie name, the Interlocal Agency amended the motion to temporarily revert to the Dixie Center name and to meet again on the issue in six months.\" ===Controversy in the community=== A substantial number of citizens gathered at the St. George City offices July 2, 2020 to advocate for retaining the \"Dixie\" names. Joey Sammons Ashby, who organized the event as part of the Protect Dixie effort,. said \u201cPeople in St. George are not racist . . . . We were never racist \u2014 never. . . .\" \"You\u2019re not going to get rid of racism, but, instead of complaining, think about the blessings black people have.\" \"Because of their ancestors, they\u2019re able to be an American, they were able to be born here, they\u2019re able to do something for themselves because this is America. This is America, and they can pull up their bootstraps and do it if they want to. There\u2019s plenty of people to help the blacks right now so instead of complaining, do something.\" \"We used to have minstrel shows here in St. George. It was in fun, it was nothing racist.\" \"I used to dress up with a blackface for Halloween. I think actually it was a compliment to want to look like a blackface.\" ===Name Change of Dixie Regional Medical Center=== On July 16, 2020, Intermountain Health Care announced the name of Dixie Regional Medical Center would change to Intermountain St. George Regional Hospital. Mitch Cloward, hospital administrator, said \u201cThe meaning of Dixie is not clear for everyone. For some, it only requires explanation; for others, who are not from this area, it has offensive connotations. . . . Our hospital name should be strong, clear and make everyone we serve feel safe and welcome.\u201d == Utah's \"Dixie\" today == The largest community in the region, St. George, was founded in 1861, when Brigham Young selected 300 families to take over that area and grow cotton, grapes, and other crops. Other communities in Washington County include Ivins, Santa Clara, Hurricane, LaVerkin, and Toquerville. The population is nearly 180,000 in the metropolitan area. ==See also== * Dixie * Dixie Center * Dixie High School (Utah) * Dixie National Forest * Dixie Regional Medical Center * Dixie State University * Dixie Technical College * St. George, Utah ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Regions of Utah Category:Geography of Washington County, Utah Category:Mojave Desert Category:1854 establishments in Utah Territory ",
