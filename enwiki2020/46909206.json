A 31-piece all-string orchestra provided music to supplement the verbal segments. The program was broadcast live every Wednesday evening for its entire run from March 19, 1930, until May 25, 1932. It originated in the studios of WEAF in New York and was carried nationally over the NBC Red Network. Some content from the program's broadcasts was released on Victor recordings CVE-59833 through CVE59839. ==See also== *Academy Award Theater *Author's Playhouse *The Campbell Playhouse *Cavalcade of America *CBS Radio Workshop *Ford Theatre *General Electric Theater *Lux Radio Theatre *The Mercury Theatre on the Air *The MGM Theater of the Air *The Screen Guild Theater *Screen Director's Playhouse ==References== Category:American sports radio programs Category:1930 radio programme debuts Category:1932 radio programme endings Category:NBC radio programs Category:1930s American radio programs Category:American variety radio series ",
