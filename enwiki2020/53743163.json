With residential, outpatient, and day school locations in Connecticut and California, Newport Academy uses forms of treatment such as music therapy, nutritional counseling, art therapy, equine therapy, meditation, and cooking therapy, among others. In 2016, the monthly fee was $40,000. It is a member of the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs. ==History== Newport Academy was founded in May 2009 by Jamison Monroe, who as a young teenager had been in rehab programs for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse issues. Newport Academy treats mental health issues and addiction. In 2012, Newport Academy received approval from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. In July and August of 2013 a judge sent Ethan Couch for teen substance abuse and mental health rehabilitation to Newport Academy, which cost upwards of $450,000 annually at that time. Couch's stay was a topic in the press. In January 2017, Monroe Operations, which does business as Newport Academy, was reportedly up for sale, with Moelis & Co advising on the auction. ==Treatment methods== The schools use a number of therapies to treat mental health issues, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Among the forms of treatment are music therapy, nutritional counseling, art therapy, equine therapy, meditation, and cooking therapy. At outpatient facilities there are daily yoga and meditation classes, with other regular treatments such as hiking and climbing. ==Programs and facilities== Newport Academy has locations in Connecticut and California, and facility types include residential, outpatient, and day school. The residential facilities are separated by gender. Outpatient locations, where teens transition to a home environment, are in Costa Mesa, California and Darien, Connecticut. The outpatient programs use smaller groups ages 13 to 19 for therapy. Newport Academy also operates a sober high school for teenagers going through rehab in New York City. == References == ==External links== *Newportacademy.com Category:Therapeutic boarding schools in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 2009 ",
