Development of the project was stopped after the first prototype crashed at sea while approaching for landing during a test flight.EADS Stops Barracuda UCAV Demonstrator Development , Air-attack.com, 13 September 2007 The program was resumed in 2008, with a second prototype being completed in November 2008. The rebuilt Barracuda underwent a series of successful flight tests in Goose Bay, Canada during July 2009,EADS press release on Barracuda flight tests in Canada, 2009 followed by further flight campaigns in 2010Cassidian Barracuda page and 2012.Cassidian press release on 2012 Barracuda flight campaign The Barracuda is primarily in competition with the Dassault nEUROn for strategic and defensive contracts. Both are stealthy and have a maximum air speed of around Mach 0.85. While Germany and Spain are behind the Barracuda, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Greece, and Spain are funding the nEUROn. Not much is known about the Barracuda as it is still in development; however, it is thought to have an operating ceiling of around and carries a maximum payload of 300 kg. == Development == The Barracuda originated as a UAV design study, intended to push EADS into the market for medium-altitude long-range UAVs, a market they view as dominated by the United States and Israel.Barracuda Its official debut was at the 2006 International Aerospace Exhibition, where military applications and specifications for the Barracuda were revealed. EADS' current focus is to get the Barracuda certified for unregulated flight in Germany's designated airspace, while the long-term goal is to have it certified for non-segregated airspace.One step beyond They also plan to develop the Barracuda as a modular platform, so that it can be refitted for various roles like maritime patrol.High-speed Barracuda could spawn modular UAV family - ILA show report Offensive capabilities are not planned, but it may be refitted to carry weapons if customers express interest for it. The Barracuda may also be capable of carrying weapon systems. The systems would be installed in the central payload bay. Germany is also discussing a partnership with Sweden and Italy for a multinational unmanned aerial vehicle effort in order to compete with the French-led Dassault nEUROn programme.Germany, Italy and Sweden hold project talks on 'Agile' advanced UAV in bid to beat French-led Neuron Spain, Italy and Sweden are already participants in the French-led effort.Important player in Neuron The Barracuda's maiden flight took place in April, 2006 at a remote location on the Iberian Peninsula.Air-Attack.com - EADS Barracuda The flight was a success but the prototype crashed into the water during a test flight just off the Spanish coast on September 23, 2006. == Design == The Barracuda is based on commercially available 'off the shelf' components, but also many refined systems. Its fuselage is constructed entirely from carbon fibre, but also has a greater strength to weight ratio than traditional aircraft materials such as Aluminum (the structure of the Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing 787 Dreamliner are also made significantly out of it). The only significant metal component is the wing spar, running through the middle and reinforcing the wings. The wing spar allows for easy removal of the wings for transportation. The Barracuda uses a specially shaped fuselage, including S-duct air inlet and V-tail, to scatter deflected radar, rendering the UCAV stealthy. == Specifications == == See also == == References == == Sources == * == External links == * EADS Cassidian Barracuda page * Air-Attack.com's page on the Barracuda Category:International unmanned aerial vehicles Category:2000s international military reconnaissance aircraft Category:Stealth aircraft Barracuda Category:Single-engined jet aircraft Category:Mid-wing aircraft Category:Unmanned military aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 2006 Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles Category:Unmanned experimental aircraft Category:V-tail aircraft Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of Spain Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of Germany ",
