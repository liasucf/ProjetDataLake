    "text": "Allianz Tower is a fifty-floor, skyscraper in Milan, Italy. In 2016, Il Dritto was nominated by Emporis as the third-best skyscraper that was completed in 2015. Il Dritto (The Straight One in English) or Allianz Tower is one of the tallest buildings in Italy at \u2014 with broadcast antenna\u2014and with its 50 floors is the tallest to the roof. It was designed by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki and Italian architect Andrea Maffei. The tower is composed by eight modules by six floors each one. The fa\u00e7ade of the module is composed by a triple-glass unit slightly curved to outside. The vertical succession of rounded forms create a feeling of slight vibration of the volume of the building as it rises upward. Elevations of the short sides are fully glazed and show the mechanical series of six panoramic lifts going up and down to the various floors of the building. The idea of an endless tower can be compared to previous ambitions of other artists such as Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, for example, who in 1937\u201338 installed one of his endless columns of T\u00e2rgu Jiu in the park to create repeatable systems indefinitely. The building serves as the headquarters of the Allianz Group and the Italian parent company Allianz SpA. == See also == * List of tallest buildings in Italy ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in Milan Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Italy Category:Office buildings completed in 2015 ",
