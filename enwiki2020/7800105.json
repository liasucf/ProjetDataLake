    "text": "Kayne Scott (born 21 June 1968 in Hamilton, New Zealand) started his motorsport career by competing in motocross at the age of 12. Scott is a five time New Zealand Trans-Am champion and won the 2005/06 New Zealand V8s series. He took a seven-year sabbatical from motor racing from 1996 to 2003 for business reasons. Scott has competed in the Bathurst 1000 five times, but has only finished once, in 2005, where he placed 11th in a Holden VZ Commodore. His four DNFs came in 1988 (BMW M3), 1991 (Ford Sierra RS500), 2006 (Holden VZ Commodore) and 2007 (Holden VE Commodore). ==Family== Scott is married to Kelli with three children: Cody, Paris and Jett. ==Team Kiwi Racing== Scott has signed with Team Kiwi Racing for the Australian V8 Supercar series. Scott struggled in the poorly funded team and he and endurance race co-driver Chris Pither both chose to leave the team after Bathurst round ten. The string of bad debts and unpaid crew took its toll on all involved. ==Career results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- ! Season ! Series ! Position ! Car !
