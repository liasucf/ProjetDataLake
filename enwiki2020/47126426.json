Zach Kelly of Pitchfork Media gave The False Alarms a 6.9 out of 10, saying: \"Detours into coldwave and seance-y Scandi-pop still feel like an attempt to steer things in a new direction, but the songs fall prey to the same kind of directionless, inertia-deprived trappings that helped sink Fol Chen's previous records.\" Heather Phares of AllMusic said, \"these songs are somewhat less enigmatic than before: the melodies are ever so slightly more direct, even though intricate arrangements and hooks that sneak up on the listener are still what make this band distinctive.\" ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 albums Category:Fol Chen albums Category:Asthmatic Kitty albums ",
