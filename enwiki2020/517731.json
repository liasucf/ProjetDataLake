As of 2006, the recorded population of towns has been published yearly by INSEE. The census is now based on the annual collection of information, successively covering all municipal territories over a period of five years. For towns with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, a census survey of the entire population is done every five years, while the populations of the years in between are estimated by interpolation or extrapolation. For Cairon, the first comprehensive census within the framework of this new system was carried out in 2008. In 2015, the commune totaled 1,947 inhabitants, a growth of 20.84% compared to 2010 (Calvados: +1.53%, France outside Mayotte: +2.44%). ==See also== *Communes of the Calvados department *Buron ==References== *INSEE Category:Calvados communes articles needing translation from French Wikipedia Category:Communes of Calvados (department) ",
