    "text": "Illeism (from Latin ille meaning \"he, that\") is the act of referring to oneself in the third person instead of first person. It is sometimes used in literature as a stylistic device. In real-life usage, illeism can reflect a number of different stylistic intentions or involuntary circumstances. ==In literature== Early literature such as Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico or Xenophon's Anabasis, both ostensibly non-fictional accounts of wars led by their authors, used illeism to impart an air of objective impartiality, which included justifications of the author's actions. In this way personal bias is presented, albeit dishonestly, as objectivity. Illeism can also be used in literature to provide a twist, wherein the identity of the narrator as the main character is hidden from the reader until later in the story (e.g. one Ars\u00e8ne Lupin story where the narrator is Ars\u00e8ne Lupin but hides his own identity); the use of third person implies external observation. A similar use is when the author injects himself into his own third person narrative story as a character, such as Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation, Douglas Coupland in JPod, and Clive Cussler's novels, beginning with Dragon. It can also be used as a device to illustrate the feeling of \"being outside one's body and watching things happen\", a psychological disconnect resulting from dissonance either from trauma such as childhood physical or sexual abuse, or from past outbursts that cannot be reconciled with the individual's own self-image. The same kind of objective distance can be employed for other purposes. Theologian Richard B. Hays writes an essay where he challenges earlier findings that he disagrees with: \"These were the findings of one Richard B. Hays, and the newer essay treats the earlier work and earlier author at arms' length.\"Richard B. Hays, \u201c\u2018Here We Have No Lasting City\u2019: New Covenantalism in Hebrews\u201d in Richard J. Bauckham et al. (eds.), The Epistle to the Hebrews and Christian Theology (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009), 151\u2013173, esp. 151\u2013152, 167. A common device in science fiction is for robots, computers, and other artificial life to refer to themselves in the third person, e.g. \"This unit is malfunctioning\" or \"Number Five is alive\" (said by Johnny Five in Short Circuit), to suggest that these creatures are not truly self-aware, or that they separate their consciousness from their physical form. Illeism may also be used to show idiocy, as with the character Mongo in Blazing Saddles, e.g. \"Mongo like candy\" and \"Mongo only pawn in game of life\"; though it may also show innocent simplicity, as it does with Harry Potter's Dobby the Elf (\"Dobby has come to protect, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door\"). ==In everyday speech== Illeism in everyday speech can have a variety of intentions depending on context. One common usage is to impart humility, a common practice in feudal societies and other societies where honorifics are important to observe (\"Your servant awaits your orders\"), as well as in Master\u2013Slave relationships (\"This slave needs to be punished\"). Recruits in the military, mostly United States Marine Corps recruits, are also often made to refer to themselves in the third person, such as \"this recruit\", in order to reduce the sense of individuality and enforce the idea of the group being more important than the self. The use of illeism in this context imparts a sense of lack of self, implying a diminished importance of the speaker in relation to the addressee or to a larger whole. Conversely, in different contexts, illeism can be used to reinforce self-promotion, as used to sometimes comic effect by Bob Dole throughout his political career (\"When the president is ready to deploy, Bob Dole is ready to lead the fight on the Senate Floor\", Bob Dole speaking about the Strategic Defense Initiative at the NCPAC convention, 1987). This was particularly made notable during the United States presidential election of 1996 and lampooned broadly in popular media for years afterwards. Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost noted that speaking in the third person \"is a classic technique used by generations of Bollywood scriptwriters to establish a character's aristocracy, power and gravitas\". On the other hand, third person self-referral can be associated with self-irony and not taking oneself too seriously (since the excessive use of pronoun \"I\" is often seen as a sign of narcissism and egocentrism), as well as with eccentricity in general. Psychological studies show that thinking and speaking of oneself in the third person increases wisdom and has a positive effect on one's mental state because an individual who does so is more intellectually humble, more capable of empathy and understanding the perspectives of others, and is able to distance emotionally from one's own problems. Accordingly, in certain Eastern religions, like Hinduism, illeism is sometimes seen as a sign of enlightenment, since through it, an individual detaches his eternal self (atman) from his bodily form; in particular, Jnana yoga encourages its practitioners to refer to themselves in the third person. Known illeists of that sort include Swami Ramdas, Ma Yoga Laxmi, Anandamayi Ma, and Mata Amritanandamayi. A number of celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe, Alice Cooper, and Deanna DurbinPrivate letter to film historian/critic William K. Everson in the late 1970s, referred to themselves in the third person to distance their public persona from their actual self. Young children in Japan commonly refer to themselves by their own name. This is due to the Japanese way of speaking, in which referring to another in the third person is considered more polite than using any of the Japanese words for \"you\". As a Japanese child grows older they normally switch to using first person references. Japanese idols also may refer to themselves in the third person so to give off the feeling of childlike cuteness. ==Notable illeists== === Real people === ====Politics==== * Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico (58\u201349 BC) present the author's exploits in the Gallic War in the third person. * Henry Adams, historian, author and descendant of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, throughout his autobiography The Education of Henry Adams (1918)See the Wikisource of the book: s:The Education of Henry Adams * General Douglas MacArthur (1880\u20131964) was known to refer to himself as \"MacArthur\" in telling stories involving himself * Charles de Gaulle (1890\u20131970) * Richard Nixon (1913\u201394) * Bob Dole (born 1923), during his United States presidential campaign in 1996 * Mikhail Gorbachev (born 1931), Russian politician * Paulo Maluf (born 1931), Brazilian politician * Bernie Sanders (born 1941) used third person in his presidential campaign in 2016. * Donald Trump (born 1946) used the third person repeatedly during his presidency. * Herman Cain (1945\u20132020), during his United States presidential campaign in 2012 * Narendra Modi (born 1950), Prime Minister of India * Anthony Garotinho (born 1960), Brazilian politician *Roy Kwong Chun-yu (born 1983), District Councilor and legislator of Hong Kong ====Sports==== * After pitching Game 5 of the ALDS, Johnny Cueto gave a post game interview in the third person. * Gregg Easterbrook, sports journalist, refers to himself as \"TMQ\" or \"your columnist\" in his weekly Tuesday Morning Quarterback columns. * Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 * LeBron James made several references to himself in the third person during The Decision program on ESPN in 2010. * Rickey Henderson occasionally referred to himself as \"Rickey\". * Karl Malone * Diego Maradona * Lothar Matth\u00e4us is quoted with the phrase: \"A Lothar Matth\u00e4us does not let himself be beaten by his body.
