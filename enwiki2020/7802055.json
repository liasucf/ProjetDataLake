A professional competitor from 2001 until 2013, he was the 2006 PRIDE Welterweight (183 lbs) Grand Prix Champion, and also competed in Sengoku, Pancrase, DEEP, and Strikeforce.

The original result of the match was a knockout victory for Misaki, but Akiyama protested the finish. The knockout kick came as Akiyama attempted to get back to his feet after being knocked down by Misaki. Akiyama contested that one or more of his hands were on the mat at the time of the kick, which would make the kick illegal under Yarennoka! rules.

Misaki was dominating the fight until he got taken down and submitted in the final round. On November 8, 2009 Misaki announced he was leaving his long-time gym GRABAKA. Misaki recently lost to K-1 fighter Melvin Manhoef via a controversial stoppage at Dynamite!! 2009.
