First launched on 17 December 1899, Frankfurt took frequent passages between Germany and the United States from 1900 to 1918. Many of its passengers were migrants. In 1919, Frankfurt was acquired by the White Star Line after it was surrendered to the United Kingdom in World War I. In 1922, Frankfurt was then sold to the Oriental Navigation Company in Hong Kong, where it was renamed Sarvistan, before its eventually being scrapped in Japan in 1931. In 1912, it was one of the first ships to respond to the distress signals from . ==History== The Frankfurt was built by Joh. C. Tecklenborg in Geestemunde (present-day Bremerhaven, Germany), and the second of its namesake to be launched for Norddeutscher Lloyd on 17 December 1899. Most of the ship's activity prior to the First World War was transporting mainly German and Austrian migrants to the United States. On 31 March 1900, its maiden voyage started from Bremen to Baltimore. On 25 December 1901, Frankfurt took the first trip to Galveston, Texas, after which it took frequent trips from Bremen to either Baltimore, Galveston, or both. In 1908, it sailed to South America. Then, starting in 1910, it started the first of many voyages from Bremen to Philadelphia to Galveston. In 1914, it took voyages from Bremen, to Boston, and then to New Orleans. At the conclusion of the First World War, Frankfurt was surrendered to the United Kingdom and was acquired by the White Star Line in 1919. In 1922, the ship was sold to the Oriental Navigation Company in British Hong Kong and renamed Sarvistan. In 1931, it was scrapped in Japan. ==Sinking of the RMS Titanic== At 12:18 AM on 15 April 1912, while eastbound from Galveston to Bremerhaven, Frankfurt was the first vessel to respond to distress signals from the . Under the orders of Captain Edward John Smith, Titanic's wireless operator, Jack Phillips, tried to reach out to Frankfurt to acknowledge his position. However, Frankfurt's operator, W. Zippel, had not heard the first distress call and was instead making routine calls for the night. Sixteen minutes after Phillips sent Titanic's second position report to Frankfurt, they responded, saying, \"What's up, old man?\" Phillips, frustrated that the Frankfurt had seemed not to have known the situation the whole time after receiving Titanic's first distress call, says back to them, \"You fool! You stand by and keep out!\" George Behe of the Titanic Historical Society pointed out that Zippel, at the time of Phillips' outrage, was well aware of the seriousness of Titanic's situation. At 1:35 AM, Titanic's wireless transmitter lost power, hence debilitating her communication with Frankfurt and many other ships responding to her distress calls. As Frankfurt was no longer receiving calls from Titanic, Zippel tried to regain contact with her with the message that had unintentionally angered Phillips. Regardless, once the Titanic's situation was realized, according to \u00dcberall (a German magazine), the Frankfurt's captain, Hattorff, steered toward the Titanic's position at full speed. He ordered the ship's galley to bake bread and the crew to provide blankets for the passengers they would rescue. At 1:28 AM, they confirmed that they are coming. Captain Hattorff estimated that by the given coordinates, he could make it to the site by 2:00 AM or earlier. Even though Hattorff did not know the actual scope of the situation, he assumed it to be the worst with the limited details he had. It was later revealed, however, that Phillips miscalculated Titanic's coordinates, and, at 1:47 AM, the Frankfurt expressed confusion. Ultimately, Frankfurt had not been able to come to Titanic's assistance despite being only 20 miles away and the closest ship to respond to the British liner. The Frankfurt was the first to notify the , the closest ship to the Titanic, that it had sank overnight. ==Annotations== ==References== Category:1899 ships Category:Steamships of Germany Category:RMS Titanic Category:Maritime incidents in 1912 Category:Steamships of the United Kingdom Category:Ships of the White Star Line ",
