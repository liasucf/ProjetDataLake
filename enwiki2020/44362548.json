The company specialized in aircraft plans for amateur construction.Plane and Pilot: 1978 Aircraft Directory, pages 142-143. Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. The company's original design, given the German name, Harmon Der Donnerschlag () is a simple, open cockpit, single-seat mid-wing aircraft, built with a welded 4130 steel tube fuselage and wooden- framed wings, all covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The aircraft was later developed into the Harmon Mister America, which uses the same construction methods and has a similar lay-out. Both designs also employ inexpensive automotive Volkswagen air-cooled engines. == Aircraft == {| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- |+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| Summary of aircraft designed by Harmon Engineering |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" !
