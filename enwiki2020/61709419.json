    "text": "The Dechi Laot'i First Nations is a T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb First Nations band government in the Northwest Territories. The band's main community is Wekwe\u00e8t\u00ec, known before 2005 as Snare Lake, where 173 of its 193 members live. In 2005, Dechi Laot'i became part of the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Government, and collectively holds title to 39,000 square kilometers of T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb land. The new Wekwe\u00e8t\u00ec Community Government has assumed most of the band's powers and responsibilities. However, the federal government still recognizes Dechi Laot'i for Indian Act enrollment purposes. ==References== Category:First Nations in the Northwest Territories Category:Dene governments ",
