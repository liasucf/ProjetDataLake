    "text": "The 1900 House is a historical reality television programme made by Wall to Wall/Channel 4 in 1999. In the show, a modern family tries to live in the way of the late Victorians in 1900 for three months in a modified house. It was shown on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and PBS in America (with American commentary). The series was accompanied by a book titled 1900 House: Featuring Extracts from the Personal Diaries of Joyce and Paul Bowler and Their Family by Mark McCrum and Matthew Sturgis.Macmillan, London, 1999. It won a Peabody Award in 2000 for being \"an often humorous, always perceptive, series about the realities of life in 1900 that reveals themes of perseverance, human adaptation and family dynamics.\"60th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2001. == The house == The 1900 House in question is 50 Elliscombe Road, Charlton, South- East London (). An 1890s-built two-storey terraced house with a drawing room, a dining room, a kitchen, a scullery, a bathroom, three bedrooms (there were actually four, but one was used as a safety room with a telephone) and an outside loo. To make it the 1900 house, all modern elements were removed, including electricity, insulation, indoor toilet, and central heating. Period fixtures such as a 'copper' (a large pot used for heating washing clothes over a fire), cast-iron oven and fireplaces were installed. Gas lighting was reinstalled using original remaining pipes. == The Bowler family == * Paul was the father of the family. In contemporary life, he was a Warrant Officer in the Royal Marines. In the house, he worked in the recruiting office in London (for two months; after that, he had to go to his regular job in the Marines). He felt that the role of \"Man of the House\" was difficult to act. * Joyce was the mother of the family. In her normal life, she was a civil servant for Somerset Social Services. She looked after the family and later in her free time she looked at the growing suffragette movement. She had problems with her hair (shampoo hadn't yet been invented in 1900) and difficulty with incorporating her vegetarian diet into the project. * Kathryn was a 16-year- old performing-arts student. In the house, she missed modern cleanliness, her friends and her social life. * Ruth and Hilary were 11-year-old twins. In the house, they missed their friends and their music. * Joe was a 9-year-old boy. In the house, he missed sweets and fast-food. == Other people == Daru Rooke was the consultant historian to the series who helped the family adjust to the 1900 lifestyle. He later visited the house for a dinner party with the family. He also equipped the family with a useful reference manual to aid their stay at the house, based on sources of the period such as Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management and Cassell's Household Guide. Because looking after the house became difficult, the Bowlers decided to hire a maid-of-all-work. Elizabeth Lillington was chosen, however after a few weeks the family sacked her as Joyce decided that she could not reconcile her views on women's emancipation with employing a woman as a domestic. However, being 'liberated' was not the view Elizabeth herself took of her dismissal. It was pointed out that a woman in Elizabeth's position in 1900 would have faced desperate poverty had she been denied housekeeping work. == Sequels == The success of 1900 House has since led to other related productions and co-productions: === UK === *The 1940s House \u2013 a family \"living\" through the Second World War. *The Edwardian Country House *Regency House Party *Coal House \u2013 a 1920s Welsh mining community *Coal House at war \u2013 a 1944 Welsh mining community *Victorian Slum House - London slum life during Victorian era *The 1900 Island - a 1900 fishing village in Anglesey === Australia === *Outback House \u2013 a family running a sheep station in 1861 Outback Australia *The Colony - Four families and several individual \"convicts\" try to live life in New South Wales of 1800. === New Zealand === *Pioneer House - essentially a New Zealand production of The 1900 House. *Colonial House - a recreation of the experiences of typical British immigrants to Canterbury, c. 1850; complete with a Sea Voyage from Auckland to Lyttelton, tramping over the Bridle Path to Christchurch with their children and belongings, setting up house in a canvas Tent, and eventually, building their own house. *One Land - Also a recreation of New Zealand in the 1850s.
