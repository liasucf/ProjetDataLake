It is endemic to the Barrington Tops area of New South Wales, where it inhabits streams, bogs and seepages. G. bucki is a medium-sized damselfly, black-green metallic in colour with pale markings, and slightly pruinescent. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae it rests with its wings outspread. G. bucki appears similar to Griseargiolestes albescens, which is found in coastal areas of north-eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland. ==Gallery== Griseargiolestes bucki female (11870790006).jpg | Tip of female tail Griseargiolestes bucki male (11870777816).jpg | Tip of male tail Griseargiolestes bucki female wings (34664977902).jpg | Female wings Griseargiolestes bucki male wings (34664982902).jpg | Male wings == See also == * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Megapodagrionidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by G\u00fcnther Theischinger Category:Insects described in 1998 Category:Damselflies ",
