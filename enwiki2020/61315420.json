Born in 1726 in Dedham, he was very smart but did not wish to follow his father, also named Samuel Dexter into the ministry at First Church and Parish in Dedham. He married Hannah Sigourney in 1748. His son, the third Samuel Dexter, served in the administrations of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Dexter moved from Dedham to Boston and earned \"a modest fortune\" with his \"mercantile pursuits.\" He retired back to Dedham at the age of 36 to the Samuel Dexter House. For the next 13 years he was active in the community and served in the Great and General Court and on the Massachusetts Governor's Council as well as several other offices. He was active politically during the Revolutionary War and kept a diary of his thoughts about the day's events. During this time he served in the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. He served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1764 to 1767 and again in 1765, and 1785. He was a selectman for fie terms beginning in 1764, justice of the peace, and town clerk in 1761. He was also town clerk for a total of five years. Following the evacuation of Boston, General George Washington spent the night of April 4, 1776 at Dexter's home on his way to New York. The house still stands today at 699 High Street. He resigned in 1776 in ill health and moved to Woodstock, Connecticut. In his will he left $170 to the Dedham Public Schools. ==References== ==Works cited== * * Category:People from Woodstock, Connecticut Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:1726 births Category:1810 deaths Category:Members of the colonial Massachusetts Governor's Council Category:Dedham, Massachusetts selectmen Category:Dedham Town Clerks ",
