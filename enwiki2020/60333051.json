Freda and her sister, Lillian, were raised by her widowed mother, Ida, who worked as a dress designer. Ida was also a noted anarchist, and close friend of activist Emma Goldman. Diamond attended the Women\u2019s Art School at the Cooper Union in New York city where she studied decorative design, graduating in 1924. Following her graduation, she worked for William Baumgarten. Dissatisfied with her assignments from Baumgarten, Diamond began a job as a manager and stylist for Stern Brothers where she became familiar with mass manufacturing. === Consultancy === After six years at Stern Brothers, Diamond opened her own consultancy. In 1942, she was commissioned to co-design glassware for Libbey Glass with Virginia Hamill. For the project, Diamond conducted a year-long market research survey of consumer preference in style, price and material. Diamond and Hamill's designs, first manufactured immediately following WWII, were incredibly popular, selling in the millions. She received significant recognition for her designs including the Museum of Modern Art's \"Good Design Award.\" In 1954, Life Magazine named her \"Designer for Everybody.\" Diamond spent much the following decades working as a consultant for a number of international companies. In this capacity, she traveled to Japan twice, providing insight on American consumer preferences. She died in 1998. == References == Category:1905 births Category:1998 deaths Category:American industrial designers Category:Cooper Union alumni Category:Artists from New York City ",
