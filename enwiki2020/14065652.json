    "text": "The Auckland Rugby League competition has been competed for since 1909 when the first organised match was played between North Shore and City Rovers (won 44\u201322 by North Shore). The following year an official champion was crowned for the first time, namely the City Rovers club who won the 1910 1st Grade title and were one of the 4 original teams at that time (City Rovers, Devonport United, Newton Rangers, and Ponsonby United). Over the following 110 years many team and individual trophies have been awarded. The following is a list of the clubs and individuals that they have been awarded to at the premier- grade level. ==Trophies== :For a full list of all Fox Memorial Grand Final winners go to Fox Memorial Grand Finals. There are approximately 24 trophies which have been competed for in Auckland Rugby League history by clubs. These include the following for teams; Fox Memorial Shield, Rukutai Shield, Roope Rooster, Stormont Shield, Kiwi Shield, A.R.L. Trophy, Sharman Cup, Lawson Cup, Walmsley Shield, ARL Cup, Norton Cup, Gillett Cup and the Autex Award. Several have also been awarded to players including the Lipscombe Cup, Rothville Trophy, Bert Humphries Memorial, Tetley Trophy, Painter Trophy, Hyland Memorial Cup, Doug Price Memorial Medal, Jack Counihand Trophy, Harry Mackwood Trophy and the Simons Scroll. ===Explanation of team trophies=== *The Fox Memorial is awarded to the grand final winner of Premier One and is considered the most prestigious trophy in Auckland club rugby league. It was named after Edward Vincent Fox who played for North Shore, and Auckland before going to fight in World War I. He was awarded a medal for bravery but suffered a leg injury ending his playing career. From 1910 to 1930 the trophy was named the Monteith Shield after the man who had donated it to the league. *The Rukutai Shield is awarded to the Premier One minor or premiership champions at the end of the regular season. It is named after Jim Rukutai who was an early player in Auckland Rugby League and later became the youngest-ever coach of New Zealand at the age of 33. *The Roope Rooster was first competed for in 1915. It was named after Dick Roope who donated the trophy when he was Auckland Rugby League Chairman. For the first few decades of its existence it was a knockout competition played after the championship was completed but later moved to being a pre-season competition. In 2006 it changed format when it became a trophy which only changes hand when the holder of the trophy loses a match on their home ground. *The Stormont Shield is named after Bill Stormont (William Devanney Stormont), a World War I veteran who played for the Marist club and for the Kiwis.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world- war-1/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503669&objectid;=11459371 The Shield is a champion of champions playoff between the Fox Memorial and Roope Rooster winners and has been competed for since 1925. *The Kiwi Shield is awarded to the Premier One club with the most points scored from Premiers and Reserves (x1). *Club of the Year. Awarded to the club in Auckland considered to have achieved the most in an all-round sense. ===Premier one titles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Fox Memorial ! Rukutai Shield ! Roope Rooster !

It was gifted to Auckland Rugby League in October of 1934 by Mr. Sharman of George Court and Sons. He was moving from New Zealand to live in England and wished to leave a happy memory behind of his involvement in Auckland rugby league. *The Lawson Cup was awarded to the Premier 2 Major Champions, and in essence it has been replaced by the Sharman Cup. *The Norton Cup was originally awarded to the Senior B Grade (second division) champions while the Phelan Shield has been awarded to the Premier 3 Major Champions. The Phelan Shield replaced the ARL Trophy (first awarded in 1989); however, from 2015 it was awarded to the Premier 2 Minor Champion as the competition reverted to a two-division structure. It was donated to the league in 1934 by Ted Phelan and was won in its inaugural season by Newton Rangers. At this point it was competed for by teams who were eliminated from the Roope Rooster in the first round. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Sharman Cup ! Lawson Cup ! Norton Cup !
