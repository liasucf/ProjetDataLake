    "text": "The Siege of Thionville was a conflict during the War of the First Coalition. It began at Thionville on 24 August 1792. A coalition force of 20,000 Austrians and 16,000 French Royalist troops under Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen failed to take the town, commanded by Georges F\u00e9lix de Wimpffen, and raised the siege on 16 October. One of the French royalist troops was Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, who was wounded in the battle.Robert Leggewie, Anthologie de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise, Tome II, troisi\u00e8me \u00e9dition, p. 11. In the aftermath of the siege the National Convention declared that Thionville had \"deserved well of the fatherland\" - it named Place de Thionville and Rue de Thionville in Paris after the victory. ==References== Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Conflicts in 1792 Category:1792 in France Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Battles in Grand Est ",
