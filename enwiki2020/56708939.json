It provides training and theological education to those preparing for lay and ordained ministries in the Scottish Episcopal Church. It also provides training for leaders of the United Reformed Church. The SEI was formally launched in October 2015, and replaced the Theological Institute of the Scottish Episcopal Church. ==Education== Since 2016, the Scottish Episcopal Institute has been involved in the Common Awards, and as such has its academic qualifications validated by Durham University. The SEI has four formation pathways: * Part-time study: three to six years, with ordinands and lay candidates continuing in their regular jobs * Full-time study: three years, with ordinands attending an ancient Scottish university to study for a theology degree and also training part-time with the SEI * Mixed- mode training: three years, with ordinands becoming part of a ministerial team for on-the-job training and also training part-time with the SEI * Tailored study: at least two years, for those with prior theological education who need practical and ministerial formation ==Journal== The institute has published The Scottish Episcopal Institute Journal since 2017. It is published quarterly, and is peer-reviewed and open-access. ==Notable people== * The Revd Canon Anne Tomlinson has been principal of the SEI since its foundation. ==References== == External links == * Category:Anglican seminaries and theological colleges Category:Bible colleges, seminaries and theological colleges in Scotland Category:Educational institutions established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Scotland Category:Scottish Episcopal Church ",
