    "text": "The Jackson County Courthouse, located at 413 4th Street in the city of Jackson, Jackson County in the U.S. state of Minnesota consists of a Bedford limestone Beaux Arts courthouse featuring a high, segmented dome adorned with a cast statue of Lady Justice, columns supporting a gable overhang, a shield pediment, and symmetrical pavilions. The building was built by Charles Skooglun of Saint Paul at a cost $117,435 in 1908-1909. The imposing structure is topped by a two-plus-story dome with stained glass windows. This sits over an octagonal atrium with terrazzo floors, marbled plaster walls, and a second- floor courtroom painted by immigrants with extensive murals; they depict scenes such as a frontier cabin, a railroad, Romans engaged in engineering and construction, and three women (justice, liberty, and equality) guarding a judge's bench. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Jackson County, Minnesota Category:County courthouses in Minnesota Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Government buildings completed in 1909 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Jackson County, Minnesota ",
