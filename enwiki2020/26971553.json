Still seems to possess an appeal and stands a chance of reaching further down the line than the more sophisticated yarns because it essays to point a moral.\" Variety Tuesday, February 16, 1932 \"Jean Harlow has often expressed a longing to play a 'good girl' In pictures, 'Three Wise Girls' (Beacon) grants her wish. In it she's just as good as good can be. But a good girl to picture audiences has to do more than act that way; she's got to look that way. However, it is a physical impossibility for Miss Harlow to assume the straight ascetic outlines which are the basis of virtue; to film audiences, her contours and manner of displaying them will never allow her to sneak into the good girl category no matter how sincerely she longs for it. Mae Clarke, who looks like a good girl and is cast for a bad one, and Marie Prevost, who doesn't aspire for a millionaire, but is happy with a chauffeur and a wedding band, complete the trio of girls laughingly called 'Wise' in this pleasant little yarn's title.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1932 films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films directed by William Beaudine Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films set in New York City Category:1932 romantic drama films Category:1932 drama films ",
