    "text": "The 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, also known as the Orange Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship reasons, was the 27th Africa Cup of Nations, the biennial football championship of Africa (CAF). It was held in Angola, where it began on 10 January 2010 and concluded on 31 January. In the tournament, the hosts Angola were to be joined by 15 nations who advanced from the qualification process that began in October 2007 and involved 53 African national teams. The withdrawal of Togo after a terrorist attack on their bus upon arriving for the tournament reduced the number of participating nations to 15. A total of 29 games were played, instead of the scheduled 32 games. Egypt won the tournament, their seventh ACN title and an unprecedented third in a row, beating Ghana 1\u20130 in the final. ==Host selection== Bids : *Angola *Gabon / Equatorial Guinea *Libya *Nigeria Rejected Bids : *Benin / Central African Republic *Botswana *Mozambique *Namibia *Senegal *Zimbabwe On 4 September 2006, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) approved a compromise between rival countries to host the Africa Cup of Nations after it ruled out Nigeria. CAF agreed to award the next three editions from 2010 to Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Libya respectively. They assigned Angola in 2010, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, which submitted a joint bid in 2012, and Libya for 2014. This edition was awarded to Angola to encourage the country to move towards peace after the Angolan Civil War. Two-time former host Nigeria is the reserve host for the 2010, 2012 and 2014 tournaments, in the event that any of the host countries fails to meet the requirements established by CAF. The 2014 tournament was pushed forward to 2013 and subsequently held in odd-numbered years to avoid year-clash with the FIFA World Cup. ==Qualification== The Confederation of African Football announced that the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification would also be the qualification for this tournament. Despite the fact Angola are the host of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, they also needed to participate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. A similar situation was true for South Africa. Although they will be the hosts for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, they still needed to compete in the qualification tournament in order to qualify for the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. ===Qualified teams=== A map of Africa showing the qualified nations, highlighted by stage reached. * * (hosts) * * * * * * * * * * * * (withdrew) * * ==Venues== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- !width=160|Luanda!!rowspan=8| !width=160|Cabinda |- |Est\u00e1dio 11 de Novembro||Est\u00e1dio Nacional do Chiazi |- |150px || 150px |- |Capacity: 50,000||Capacity: 20,000 |- !width=160|Benguela||Lubango |- |Est\u00e1dio Nacional de Ombaka||Est\u00e1dio Nacional da Tundavala |- |150px || 150px |- |Capacity: 35,000||Capacity: 20,000 |} ==Draw== The draw for the final tournament took place on 20 November 2009 at the Talatona Convention Centre in Luanda, Angola.

The remaining 14 teams were ranked based on their records in the three last editions of the competition. Cameroon and Ivory Coast had the two strongest records and so completed the top seeded Pot 1. The four seeded teams were placed into their groups in advance of the final draw. {| class=wikitable |- !width=25%|Pot 1 !width=25%|Pot 2 !width=25%|Pot 3 !width=25%|Pot 4 |- valign=top | | | (withdrew) | |} ==Match officials== The following referees were chosen for the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. {| class=wikitable |- !width=44%|Referees !width=44%|Assistant Referees |- valign=top | Mohamed Benouza H\u00e9lder Martins de Carvalho Coffi Codjia Noumandiez Dou\u00e9 Essam Abdel-Fatah Koman Coulibaly Rajindraparsad Seechurn Khalil Al Ghamdi Badara Diatta Eddy Maillet Daniel Bennett Jerome Damon Khalid Abdel Rahman Kokou Djaoupe Kacem Bennaceur Muhmed Ssegonga | In\u00e1cio Manuel Candido Desire Gahungu Evarist Menkouande Nasser Sadek Abdel Nabi Angesom Ogbamariam Ayuba Haruna Hassan Kamranifar Fooad El Maghrabi Moffat Champiti Redouane Achik Peter Edibe Mohammed Al Ghamdi Enock Molefe Celestin Ntagungira Bechir Hassani Kenneth Chichenga |} ==Squads== ==Group stage== ===Tie-breaking criteria=== If two or more teams end the group stage with the same number of points, their ranking is determined by the following criteria: # points earned in the matches between the teams concerned; # goal difference in the matches between the teams concerned; # number of goals scored in the matches between the teams concerned; # goal difference in all group matches; # number of goals scored in all group matches; # fair play points system taking into account the number of yellow and red cards; # drawing of lots by the organising committee.

In Angola, this animal is found only in the Cangandala National Park in Malange Province. ==Match ball== The official match ball for the tournament is the Adidas Jabulani Angola, a modified version of the Adidas Jabulani to be used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the colours of the flag of Angola. ==Marketing== Tournament had seven sponsors, Doritos, MTN Group, NASUBA, Orange, Pepsi, Samsung and only African corporate sponsor Standard Bank. ==Attack on the Togo national team== On 8 January 2010, the team bus of the Togo national football team was attacked by gunmen in Cabinda, Angola as it travelled to the tournament. A spokesman for the Togolese football federation said assistant coach Am\u00e9let\u00e9 Abalo and press officer Stanislaud Ocloo had died as well as the driver. The separatist group Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (FLEC-PM) claimed responsibility for the attack. The Togolese team withdrew from the competition the following day. The players initially decided to compete to commemorate the victims in this way, but were immediately ordered to return by the Togolese government. Following their departure from Angola, Togo were formally disqualified from the tournament after failing to fulfil their opening Group B game against Ghana on 11 January. On 30 January 2010, CAF banned Togo from participating in the next two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and fined the team $50,000 due to \"government involvement in the withdrawal from the tournament\". Togo were unable to compete until the 2015 tournament, but that ban was lifted on 14 May 2010 by a ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ==References== ==External links== * Results at CAF web site * Official Site * Dossier on African Cup of Nations \u2013 Radio France Internationale * African Cup of Nations Guide * African Cup of Nations \u2013 * 2010 Africa Cup of Nations at ESPN Category:International association football competitions hosted by Angola Nations 2010 Category:2010 in Angolan football Category:January 2010 sports events in Africa ",
