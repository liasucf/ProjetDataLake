    "text": "\"Treat You Better\" is a song by Australian alternative dance group R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol. The song was released on 9 November 2018, as the fourth and final single from the group's third studio album Solace. Upon release, the band said \"It felt like a song we wrote to ourselves and to our loved ones during what was a testing time for us all personally. We were originally going to get a gospel choir for the end of this song but thought better of it when we realized we had so many talented friends with amazing voices around us. We invited them to the studio and just spent a full day playing and recording with them. It's so special to share this song with such a talented and kind-hearted group of people.\" At the APRA Music Awards of 2020, \"Treat You Better\" was nominated for Most Performed Dance Work of the Year. ==Music video== The music video for \"Treat You Better\" was directed by Leah Barylsky & Katzki and released on 28 February 2019. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018\u201319) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Artist Singles (ARIA) | 18 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 158 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Artist (ARIA) | 45 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 96 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 9 November 2018 | rowspan=\"2\"| Digital download, streaming | Rose Avenue Records |- |} ==References== Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol songs Category:Songs written by Jason Evigan ",
