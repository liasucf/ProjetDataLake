    "text": "Benjamin Osgood Peirce (11 February 1854 Beverly, Massachusetts, USA \u2013 14 January 1914 Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) was an American mathematician and a holder of the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard from 1888 until his death in 1914... Osgood is buried at Beverly's Central Cemetery.\"Interesting Burials in Beverly Cemeteries\" by Thomas F. Scully Removed by several degrees, he was a cousin of Charles Sanders Peirce, whose father, Benjamin Peirce, worked as the Adcademic advisor to Joseph Lovering, Benjamin Osgood Peirce's predecessor as holder of the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. ==See also== * Benjamin Peirce (1809\u20131890) ==References== Chronology of Achievements: Peirce was elected to the Council of the American Mathematical Society, serving from 1896 to 1898. He was a founder of the American Physical Society when it began in 1899 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in 1906. He was honoured with election to foreign academies such as the Mathematical Circle of Palermo and the Physical Society of France. In 1910 he was awarded an honorary degree by Harvard University. In 1912 he represented Harvard University at the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Society of London.
