In the UK, The Independent declared, \u2018In her new novel, Bernardine Evaristo, never one to shrink from an experiment, has taken her boldest step to date and turned the whole thing on its head\u2026 One of the best things about this book is its bittersweet, riotous humour\u2026Running through these pages is not just a feisty, hyperactive imagination asking \u2018\u2019what if\u201d, but the unhealed African heart with the question, \u2018\u2018how does it feel?\u201d. This is a powerful gesture of thematic ownership by one of the UK\u2019s most unusual and challenging writers.\u2019 Meanwhile, the Publisher's Weekly in the US stated, \u2018British novelist Evaristo delivers an astonishing, uncomfortable and beautiful alternative history that goes back several centuries to flip the slave trade\u2026Evaristo\u2019s intellectually rigorous narrative constantly surprises..This difficult and provocative book is a conversation sparker.' === Honours and awards === * 2009: International Dublin Literary Award, nominated * 2009: Orange Prize for Fiction, nominated * 2009: Orange Prize Youth Panel Choice for Blonde Roots * 2009: Arthur C.
