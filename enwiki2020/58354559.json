    "text": "Hartford Mill is a Grade II-listed building located off Block Lane, in the Freehold area of Oldham, UK. == History == It was constructed as a cotton- spinning mill in 1907. Frederick Whittaker Dixon designed it for the Hartford Mill (Oldham) Company Ltd. It was extended in 1920 and 1924. It was Grade II- listed on 8 March 1993. In 1991, Littlewoods vacated the building, and it has been unoccupied since then. A fire significantly damaged it in 2014, and a teenager died after falling through the roof of the building in 2015. It was proposed for demolition in 2018. Demolition is currently taking place and is expected to finish by August 2020. The chimney will be dismantled piece by piece, as explosives would pose a risk to the neighbouring school and houses. == References == Category:Oldham Category:Grade II listed buildings in Greater Manchester ",
