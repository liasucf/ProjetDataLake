In the morning, MNLA mobile troops opened fire on both positions of terrorist groups in the area. The MNLA opens crossfire. The terrorist groups had initially sent the new recruits to the fire. The real terrorists stayed behind. It was only mid-day on November 16, when the terrorists noticed that their recruits were falling and that the terrorist ambulances quickly took over to evacuate a few dozen dead and nearly 60 to 70 wounded. Some terrorist leaders had come forward and engaged in hostilities. These are those who came to create the Mujao with the help, Pakistanis (instructors and strategists), Tunisians and Moroccans, including those who had been rejected by Western Sahara officials. Some fighters and heavy weapons belonging to the group of Benlmoctar entered the fights against the Tuareg towards the end of the day of November 16th. There was a coalition of terrorists coming from all over against the Tuaregs. It must be said that the MNLA Chief of Staff, Machkanani Ag Balla, went straight with his group to join the terrorist camp. And the other MNLA brigades also followed. The fighting was very violent. A huge fire blanket was coming from both sides. The MNLA, at the beginning of the day of 17 November, had taken account of its losses. Indeed, there were 3 seriously wounded and 6 light and no death was lamented in the ranks of Tuareg fighters during these fights.\"https://www.djazairess.com/fr/letemps/80917 According to Ibrahim Ag Assakeh, a member of an MNLA delegation in Ouagadougou , the ambush was happened 50 kilometers west of Ansongo , 13 MUJAO fighters were killed and 17 wounded, as against 9 wounded men on the MNLA side, including a serious one. He also added that the fighting continued . Colonel Mechkanine, number 2 of the MNLA staff, was among the wounded. The success of the MNLA, however, seems to have been only temporary and insufficient to stop the Islamist offensive, according to a security source from Burkina Faso, the same day the MUJAO attacked elements of the MNLA in the village of Idelimane to 80 kilometers of Menaka , the last bastion of the MNLA. According to the same source, \"The Mujao has taken a lot of prisoners and taken two vehicles, there have been deaths. \" http://www.toumastpress.com/actualites/liberation- azawad/858-defaite-cinglante-terroristes-mujao-aqmi- ansongo.htmlhttp://www.lepoint.fr/monde/nord-du-mali-combats-entre-islamistes- du-mujao-et-rebelles-touareg-du- mnla-16-11-2012-1530023_24.phphttp://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20121119-mali-hommes- mujao-s-emparent-menaka-mnlahttp://afrique.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/11/16/le-mnla- passe-a-lattaque-a-gao/https://www.algerie360.com/un-combattant-du-mnla- temoigne-au-temps-dalgerie-comment-sest-deroulee-la-bataille-contre-le-mujao/ ==References== Category:Mali War Gao Category:Gao Region Category:History of Azawad Category:2012 in Mali Category:June 2012 events in Africa ",
