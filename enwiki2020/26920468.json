The book that records the early history of the Dominican order is the Vitae Fratrum Ordinis Praedicatorum. This is to be distinguished from other works such as the Vitae fratrum eremitarum Ordinis Sancti Pauli Primi Eremitae, which is a fifteenth-century account of the Pauline Hermits in Hungary, or the Liber vitasfratrum of Jordan of Quedlinburg, which recounts the early history of the Order of Saint Augustine. ==History of the text== The Lives of the Brethren was written between about 1255 to 1260 by Gerard de Frachet.
