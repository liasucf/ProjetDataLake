    "text": "Clou was a Czech rock band from Prague, Czech Republic, formed in 2001. They released their EP First in 2004, which included 3 songs. After playing many concerts, they started to work on their debut album Postcards in 2005. The band achieved great success with the album due to the singles \"Island Sun\" and \"Lean on My Shoulder\". The video for \"Island Sun\" reached the Top 10 on MTV and it was the most played song in the Czech Republic. Bugsy, the band's former bass guitarist, left in July 2006. This created a difficult situation for Clou, who were only able to play acoustic concerts. At this point the band came close to breaking up. They decided to continue playing, with Stepan Farkas (ex Jaksi Taksi) stepping in on bass duties during a few summer concerts. The band discovered that Steph was a good bassist, and so they agreed to continue working together. == Discography == === EP === * First (2004) === Albums === * Postcards (2005) * Clou (2007) * For Tonight (2008) === Soundtracks === * Prachy D\u011blaj \u010clov\u011bka OST (2006) == References == * http://www.clouclub.cz * http://www.mtv.tv/mtv.tv/dynamo/shells/other_music.jhtml;jsessionid=JV5YDZMCO2BJRQFIAIICFFGAVABBCIV0?article=30122501 == External links == * Myspace Page * Official website == Notes == Category:Czech rock music groups ",
