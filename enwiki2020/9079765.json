    "text": "\"Eject\u2192Out\" is a single by The Mad Capsule Markets. The non-album single features the melodic punk sound which was later apparent on the Park album. The song is noted for having bizarre lyrics (vocalist Kyono refers to himself as variety of things and namechecks Albert Einstein and Adolf Hitler). The album came in a special box packaging, which was used for the \"Government Wall\" single and later the \"Walk!\" single. It peaked at number fifty on the official Japanese singles chart. ==Track listing== #\"Eject\u2192Out\" #\"Periodic Classic\" Category:1994 singles Category:1994 songs Category:Victor Records singles ",
