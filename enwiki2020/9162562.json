    "text": "The , also called the is a book of y\u014dkai illustrated by Japanese artist Takehara Shunsensai, published about 1841. The book was intended as a followup to Toriyama Sekien's Gazu Hyakki Yagy\u014d series. Like those books, it is a supernatural bestiary of ghosts, monsters, and spirits which has had a profound influence on subsequent y\u014dkai imagery in Japan. The author's pen name is ; however, in the preface it is written as . According to the Kokusho S\u014dmokuroku (Iwanami Shoten) this is considered to be a gesaku author from the latter half of the Edo period, . It can be said that this is a kind of hundred-tale kaidan (ghost story) book popular in the Edo period, as \"100 Tales\" is part of the title, but rather than being tales with story titles, y\u014dkai names are printed with illustrations of y\u014dkai, so it could be said that this work is a fusion of kaidan book and picture book. This book is also known by the title T\u014dsanjin Yawa because the title on the first page of each volume is \"T\u014dsanjin Yawa, Volume [#].\" Scholar of Japanese manners and customs Ema Tsutomu (Nihon Y\u014dkai Henka-shi, 1923) and folklorist Fujisawa Morihiko (Hentai Densetsu-shi, 1926), as well as magazines at that time, introduced this book by the name T\u014dsanjin Yawa, and so this title became famous. On the other hand, Mizuki Shigeru, in his 1979 Y\u014dkai 100 Monogatari describes it in his references as \"Ehon Hyaku Monogatari (Author: T\u014dsanjin, Year of publication: Unknown).\" It has also been recognized that a book with completely the same contents, titled Ehon Kaidan Zoroe, was published in 2005 by Yumoto K\u014dichi. The preface's title is changed, and the title of each volume is Ehon Kaidan Zoroe Volume [#] rather than T\u014dsanjin Yawa Volume [#]. Upon examination, it appears to be an earlier publication than Ehon Hyaku Monogatari, with the relationship that the inscriptions of \"T\u014dsanjin\" and \"T\u014dka Sanjin\" are mixed, and it also is generally suggested that the first edition of Ehon Hyaku Monogatari may have been published before 1841. == List of creatures == The illustrations below are numbered by volume and appearance order.
