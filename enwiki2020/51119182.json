    "text": "Alberto Fernando Cardoso (17 October 1906 - deceased), is a former Portuguese footballer who played as a forward. Cardoso joined Benfica in 1930, where he spent four years, scoring 23 goals in 62 matches, winning two Primeira Liga's and two Campeonatos de Portugal. ==Career== Born in Lisbon, Cardoso joined Benfica in 1930, making his debut on 26 October, against Belenenses. In his first year, he won the Campeonato de Portugal with Benfica, but the majority of his matches and goals were in the Campeonato de Lisboa. In his first years, he faced competition from Augusto Dinis and V\u00edtor Silva, so his playing time was reduced and mainly spent in the Campeonato de Lisboa. Later, it was Valadas, Rog\u00e9rio and Carlos Torres, who beat him to the first team, so Cardoso played only sporadically over the course of his eight\u2013years spell at Benfica, racking 23 goals in 62 appearances. ==Honours== ;Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1935\u201336, 1937\u201338 *Campeonato de Portugal:1930\u201331, 1934\u201335 *Campeonato de Lisboa: 1932\u201333 ==References== General * Specific Category:1906 births Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Year of death unknown Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
