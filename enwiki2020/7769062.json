    "text": "Front page of the first Avisa, Relation oder Zeitung (15 January 1609) Avisa Relation oder Zeitung was one of the first news-periodicals in the world. It was published in Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Germany, in 1609. The printer/publisher was Lucas Schulte. The first issue states that the news had been collected from various countries by 15 January. It is presumed that the issue was printed on or about that date.Morison, S. (1980) The Origins of the Newspaper. In Selected Essays on the History of Letter-Forms in Manuscript and Print, (Ed, McKitterick, D.) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Some books mention the Avisa as the world's first newspaper.For example: Chappell, W. & Bringhurst R.: Short History of the Printed Word, pp. 141-143. Hartley & Marks, Vancouver 1999. Before 2005 there was a dispute whether the Avisa or the Relation aller F\u00fcrnemmen und gedenckw\u00fcrdigen Historien, which was printed in Strassburg by Johann Carolus, was first. It was believed that both started in 1609. New evidence found in 2005, however, suggests that the Relation started as early as 1605.World Association of Newspapers: \"Newspapers: 400 Years Young!\" The last issue of the newspaper probably appeared on December 15, 1632. There is also a differing view, which does not regard either of these two publications as newspapers in a formal sense. Authors like Stanley Morison make a distinction between newsbooks (weekly news publications in a quarto format) and later folio-sized newspapers. == See also == *List of newspapers by date == References == == External links == Category:Newspapers published in Germany Category:1609 works Category:Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel Category:Wolfenb\u00fcttel Category:Publications established in 1609 Category:1609 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Publications disestablished in the 17th-century\u2032 Category:1632 disestablishments ",
