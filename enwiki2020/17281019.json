    "text": "\"Falling and Laughing\" is the debut single by Scottish post-punk band Orange Juice. It was the first single released by the independent rock label Postcard Records, owned by Alan Horne. \"Falling and Laughing\" marked a new shift of the post-punk sound in general, by using themes that were not normally used in the genre, such as love and innocence. It also had a brighter sound, contrasting with the music that their contemporaries, including Joy Division and Echo & the Bunnymen, were making at the time, while maintaining its roots in the experimentalism of the genre. A re-recording of the song appears on the band's 1982 debut album You Can't Hide Your Love Forever. The first 963 copies came with a free flexi-disc, containing an early version of Felicity, a song written by James Kirk and later covered by the Wedding Present. ==Track listing== # \"Falling and Laughing\" - (4:00) # \"Moscow\" - (2:01) # \"Moscow Olympics\" - (2:07) ==References== Category:1980 debut singles Category:Orange Juice (band) songs Category:Songs written by Edwyn Collins Category:1980 songs ",
