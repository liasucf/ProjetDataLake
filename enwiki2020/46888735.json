At the end of the track \"Vagabond from Heaven\", a large group, \"The Whistling Bishettes\", is heard. The group includes several famous non-musicians: actress Carrie Fisher, film director John Landis and then-Rolling Stone writer Cameron Crowe. ==\"Looking for the Right One\"== \"Looking for the Right One\" was the second single from Bish. It was released in both Canadahttp://www.45cat.com/bigartist/stephen-bishop/xa/2 and the UK,https://www.discogs.com/Stephen-Bishop-Looking-For-The-Right- One/release/3195884 but it did not chart. Three years earlier, Art Garfunkel had recorded the song. His original rendition of Bishop's composition was included as the B-side of his 1975 cover hit, \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" (U.S. #18, #1 AC). Bishop contributed backing vocals on Garfunkel's version, who returned the favor on Bishop's rendition. ==Track listing== All songs written by Stephen Bishop, except where noted. ==Personnel== * Hal Atkinson \u2013 drums (8, 12) * Stephen Bishop \u2013 lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitar (1\u20135, 9\u201313), trombone (1) * Ray Brown \u2013 bass guitar (1) * Artie Butler \u2013 string arrangements and conductor (1, 7, 11) * Natalie Cole \u2013 backing vocals (6) * Steve Cropper \u2013 guitar (6) * Paulinho Da Costa \u2013 percussion (4) * David Foster \u2013 electric piano (2), acoustic piano (3) * Art Garfunkel \u2013 backing vocals (10) * Keith Hollar \u2013 bass guitar (12) * The James Hoosett Choir \u2013 choir (7) * David Hungate \u2013 bass guitar (2, 3, 6, 8) * John Barlow Jarvis \u2013 electric piano (3), acoustic piano (4, 6) * Chaka Khan \u2013 backing vocals (6) * Leah Kunkel \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Abraham Laboriel \u2013 bass guitar (13) * Michael McDonald \u2013 backing vocals (2, 8) * Gene Page \u2013 rhythm arrangements (4), string arrangements and conductor (8) * Marty Paich \u2013 string arrangements and conductor (3, 13) * Ray Parker Jr. \u2013 guitar (4) * Bill Payne \u2013 electric piano (6, 8) * Greg Phillinganes \u2013 synthesizer (1, 4, 8), electric piano (4) * Steve Porcaro \u2013 synthesizer (7, 10, 12) * Raymond Pounds \u2013 drums (4) * Tom Scott \u2013 saxophone and horn arrangement (12) * Rick Shlosser \u2013 drums (2, 3, 6, 8, 9) * Michael Sembello \u2013 guitar (4) * Ed Shaughnessy \u2013 drums (1) * David Shields \u2013 bass guitar (8) * Leland Sklar \u2013 bass guitar (10) * Michael Staton \u2013 backing vocals (4, 8), guitar (8\u201311) * Jeffrey Staton \u2013 backing vocals (4, 8, 9), guitar (8\u201311), electric guitar solo (8, 12) * Tommy Vig \u2013 percussion (9) * Nathan Watts \u2013 bass (4) * \"The Whistling Bishettes\" on \"Vagabond from Heaven\" \u2013 Nancy Ames, Philip Ames, Michael Barackman, Dennis Bishop, Kathy Carey, Cameron Crowe, Kenny Farrell, Carrie Fisher, Mary Frampton, Richard Green, Trudy Green, John Landis, Mark Meyerson, Spencer Proffer, Michael J.
