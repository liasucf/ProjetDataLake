    "text": "\"I Can't Sleep\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Clay Walker. It was released in January 2004 as the second single from his album A Few Questions, it peaked at #9 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart, and features Chely Wright (with whom Walker co- wrote the song) on background vocals. ==Background== In an interview with Country Weekly, Walker said, \"It's an R&B; kind of song I started one day at the beach. Not long after that, Chely Wright and Lonestar's Richie McDonald came on my bus at a show in Colorado and we played songs we'd each started writing. When I played a piece of 'I Can't Sleep,' Chely said she could help me finish it. And when we played it at Chely's annual charity fundraiser during Fan Fair last June, it got a standing ovation.\"Holden, Larry Country Weekly Questions and Answers October 9th 2003 Wright told Jam!, \"The most creative thing happened the other night when we were in Colorado and Clay Walker was on the show as well. I popped up on his bus to say hi ... we got to talkin' about songs and we passed the guitar back and forth a couple of times and played some new stuff we'd written. We sat there and wrote a brand new song. It's moments like that which are the most exciting ... a song just pops out because you love music.\" Van Wyk, Anika Jam! Calgary has the Wright stuff (July 5, 2002) ==Content== The song describes a narrator who has been up all night long waiting for his wife to return home. In the second verse of the song, the narrator looks back at when his wife said, \"We couldn't last / [He] couldn't swallow [his] pride\", and that losing her wakes him up in the middle of the night. ==Critical reception== Mandy Davis of the St. Louis Post- Dispatch commented in her review of \"A Few Questions\", \"On \"I Can't Sleep,\" you can almost hear Walker pleading for the crossover success of Garth Brooks or Tim McGraw.\".Davis, Mandy St. Louis Post-Dispatch CD Review - Clay Walker (11 September 2003) ==Music video== The music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy.

I never realized how oppressive communism is. It was depressing to me. As Americans, we are all in 100 percent control of our attitudes. But when you live in a communist country, you have no hope. I don't care what you are, a conservative Republican or a liberal Democrat, before you open your mouth to run down this country, you should go spend a week in Cuba and see how things are in that country. There will be no food wasted on my plate. People have nothing to eat there.\"Tarradell, Mario The Dallas Morning News The molding of Clay A look at the things shaping Walker's outlook and career.
