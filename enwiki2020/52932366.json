    "text": "The Emperor Has No Balls is a series of sculptures depicting Donald Trump by the activist art collective Indecline. ==Description and history== The five statues were installed in Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle in 2016. Their collective installation was executed by 40 people; Rolling Stone described the precision with which the sculptures were erected: \"At exactly 11 in each city \u2013 8 a.m. on the West Coast \u2013 two people dressed as construction workers carried out a 6-foot-5, 80-pound object under a blue tarp, brushed away detritus from the ground, spread a thin layer of fast-acting, industrial-strength epoxy, held the object upright for a matter of seconds, and walked away, disappearing into the gathering crowds.\" The statues, made using clay and silicone, depicted Trump with abdominal obesity, an \"old man saggy butt\", varicose veins, a \"constipated\" expression, a micropenis and anorchia, and were titled The Emperor Has No Balls on engraved plates at the base; they were commissioned from Joshua \"Ginger\" Monroe, a Las Vegas artist who designs monsters for haunted houses and horror films. The Cleveland statue was in the Coventry section of Cleveland Heights; it was taken down within an hour. The New York statue, in Union Square, was removed early that afternoon; the New York City Parks Department made a statement that it \"stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small\". A bystander bit a piece out of the hair of the San Francisco statue, which was in the Castro District; it was removed early the next day, at a cost of about $4,000 because of damage to the sidewalk. The Seattle statue, which was in Capitol Hill, was claimed by a vintage store, No Parking on Pike, and the Los Angeles statue, on Hollywood Boulevard, by a local art gallery, Wacko, both before authorities could remove them. The following month, two more naked Trump statues, commissioned by a New Jersey arts collective, were installed on the roof of a warehouse overlooking the New Jersey entrance to the Holland Tunnel, where Indecline also placed an inverted US flag, and on top of a billboard in the Wynwood section of Miami; the Miami statue, which Indecline said was the same one originally placed in New York, was later moved by police request closer to the Wynwood Walls graffiti center. ==See also== * Donald Trump in popular culture * Dump Trump (statue) * Protest art * Protests against Donald Trump * Statue of Donald Trump * Trump Heights Settlement in Israel named after President Donald J Trump ==References== Category:2016 establishments in California Category:2016 establishments in New York City Category:2016 establishments in Ohio Category:2016 establishments in Washington (state) Category:2016 protests Category:2016 sculptures Category:Nude sculptures in the United States Category:Outdoor sculptures in Manhattan Category:Outdoor sculptures in Ohio Category:Outdoor sculptures in San Francisco Category:Outdoor sculptures in Seattle Category:Outdoor sculptures in Greater Los Angeles Category:Protests in the United States Category:Sculptures of men in California Category:Sculptures of men in New York City Category:Sculptures of men in Ohio Category:Sculptures of men in Washington (state) Category:Statues in California Category:Statues in New York City Category:Statues in Ohio Category:Statues in Washington (state) Category:Statues of Donald Trump ",
