In early March 2015 it was put into trial operation and opened on 6 April 2015, together with Bo\u0159islavka, Pet\u0159iny and Nemocnice Motol stations. ==History== N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Veleslav\u00edn station opened on 6 April 2005. Initially, the station did not have escalator leading to the vestibule to the street, so people arriving to or going from the airport had to be helped by special staff. Therefore, in 2017 a decision was made to build additional escalators at a cost of 33 million Czech crowns. The planned name for the station was initially just Veleslav\u00edn. Authorities later changed it to the current station name, due to it being next to the Praha-Veleslav\u00edn station as well as for the nearby tram and bus stop stops of the same name. ==General information== The station is adjacent to the Praha-Veleslav\u00edn railway station and a bus terminal which became the new end of the 119 bus line from V\u00e1clav Havel Airport and regional buses towards Kladno. The station is 20m below ground level. The station was designed by architect Hana Vermachov\u00e1. ==Gallery== Image:NadraziVeleslavin (02).jpg|Clock at the end of the station platform.
