She won re-election on April 7, 2009, defeating Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Randy Koschnick. In April, 2015 voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that changed the way that the chief justice of the Supreme Court was selected. Previously the justice with the most seniority held the position, but the amendment allowed court members to choose the chief justice. On April 29, 2015, the day the vote canvass was certified by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, the justices elected Justice Patience D. Roggensack as the new chief justice. According to Abrahamson's own opinion in the 2002 case, State v. Gonzalez, \"\"[U]nless a constitutional amendment provides otherwise, it takes effect upon the certification of a statewide canvass of the votes,\" Since that date, as there is no wording in the amendment saying it should not take effect after the canvass, and no stay or temporary restraining order on the amendment, Justice Roggensack became the Chief Justice, and she has acted in that position in court business since then. Abrahamson filed a federal lawsuit challenging the immediate implementation of the constitutional amendment, contending that she should remain chief justice until the expiration of her current term in 2019. Her lawsuit was heard on May 15, 2015. Five of the seven justices asked the federal judge to dismiss Abrahamson's lawsuit.Patrick Marley. \"State high court quickly ousts Shirley Abrahamson as chief justice\", The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 29, 2015. Retrieved May 1, 2015. That day, the federal court denied Abrahamson's request for immediate reinstatement as Chief Justice. U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson determined there was no harm in Roggensack serving as chief justice while Abrahamson's lawsuit continued. On May 27 she appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. However, she dropped the lawsuit on November 10, after deciding that, no matter what happened in her lawsuit, her term would be close to ending by the time the litigation finally ended. On May 30, 2018, Abrahamson announced she would not seek re-election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2019.Shawn Johnson. \"Longtime Wisconsin Justice Shirley Abrahamson Won't Seek Re-Election\".
