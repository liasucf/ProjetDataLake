    "text": "Civica Rx is a nonprofit generic drug manufacturer founded in 2018 in response to shortages and high pricing of urgently needed generic medications in the United States. Civica Rx was started by national philanthropies and leading US health systems. By the end of 2019, over 45 health systems representing 1200 hospitals were members of Civica. Member hospital pharmacists and clinicians help prioritize the medications Civica makes. The company's initial business plan was to produce 14 generic drugs for hospitals in 2019. By the end of 2019 Civica had 18 medications (28 SKUs) in production, and plans to bring over 100 medications to market in five years through various manufacturing approaches such as partnerships, developing ANDAs, and building its own manufacturing capability. The first shipment of Civica private-label medication was vancomycin, delivered to Riverton Hospital, a part of Civica founder health system Intermountain Healthcare, in October 2019. ==Partnerships and deals== In January 2020, Civica Rx announced a seven-year partnership with Thermo Fisher to produce nine drugs for emergency and critical care applications that are vulnerable to frequent shortages. This is the first deal in which a manufacturer would produce drugs under an ANDA owned by Civica Rx itself, rather than under the manufacturer's ANDA. In July 2019, it announced a supplier partnership with Hikma Pharmaceuticals to provide 14 essential medicines used daily by hospitals in emergency care, surgery, pain management and hypertension treatment.. By the end of 2019 Civica was working with five confirmed supplier partners and in negotiations with several more. In May 2019, Civica announced that Xellia Pharmaceuticals of Copenhagen, Denmark, was its first supplier partnership and would provide the antibiotics vancomycin and daptomycin. ==References== Category:Pharmaceutical companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 2018 Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:Generic drug manufacturers ",
