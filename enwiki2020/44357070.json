His debut album, Ya Zaman (\u00d4 Good Old Days), was released in 2011 to critical acclaim, praising the nostalgic melodies of the East, the rigorous harmonies of baroque, and the elemental roots of jazz rhythms. A collaboration between 32 Lebanese and Belgian musicians, Ya Zaman peaked atop of the Lebanese charts, earning Massy the Murex d'Or (Golden Murex award) for \"Innovation in Music\" in 2012.

Amidst the raging battles and the ugliness of war, he found a harbor of peace in the angelic voice of Feyrouz and the nostalgic melodies of Zaki Nassif. Soon, he was fascinated by the new world he had discovered and at the age of nine, he started his first piano lessons. Growing up, he was drawn to the French Chanson music genre, in particular the authentic poetry of Brel and the grandeur of Aznavour. At the age of twelve, Massy joined the National High Conservatory of Music where he continued his classical piano training. At seventeen, his deep natural curiosity and immense love of challenge pushed him to learn Arabic Opera and old Andalusian \u201cMouwachahats\u201d. He also trained in Oriental and Occidental singing. However, Massy\u2019s artistic thirst was not quenched. Driven by his passion for theatre, he joined the Faculty of Fine Arts where he graduated in Dramatic Art from the Lebanese University in Beirut. Simultaneously, he followed Jazz Ballet courses at the Arabesque dancing school, eventually joining its acclaimed troupe. Mike Massy\u2019s composing and singing started very early on, when he was a child behind his piano. His innate talent and solid musical and artistic education evolved into a new style marked with novelty, distinctiveness and refinement, remaining both simple and inimitable. == Bravo, the borderline album == After playing the r\u00f4le of \"Jesus\" in France, Mike Massy returns to the music scene with a 9th studio album, \"Bravo\", written, composed and produced by Massy himself.

His cover of \u201cYa Achikata l Wardi\u201d (Lover of the roses) by the great Zaki Nassif was highly acclaimed as reviving Lebanon\u2019s musical heritage in a modern, stylish and respectful way.

His own journey with the voice started 15 years ago. As he was seeking ways to overcome the technical challenges he faced as an artist; especially that he is both an actor and a singer. It was unthinkable for Massy to favour one facet of his artistic personality over the other. He instinctively knew that a voice is an instrument to be respected and treated the same way whether for speech or singing. To this end, he had to seek alternative ways to hone the skills he had acquired throughout his academic path. By doing so, he also realised the healing potential of voice work. From the soothing vibrations of a hum, to the strident liberation of a high note I learned to find refuge in those privileged moments. He actively listened to his heart, his body and his soul all becoming one in a breath of life creating a sound he can call my own. Throughout this process, Massy became increasingly aware of the lack of such workshops in the Middle-East and North Africa. Driven by his inspiring passion for voice he could not resist the desire to share this universe with those who generously allow him to enter their world and hopefully help them achieve well-being. Thus the birth of Voice Matters Workshop. ==Discography== * Ila ssama atba\u2019ouka (2003) * Itsy Bitsy Spider (Soundtrack) (2008) * Ya Zaman (2011) * Tannoura Maxi (Soundtrack) (2012) * B Beirut (Beirut Marathon Official song) (2012) * One Woman Song (UN Women theme song for International Women's Day) (2014) * Naseej (Mike Massy, Ayad & Sary Khalif\u00e9) (2014) * Kalbon Kabeer (BraveHeart NGO song) (2015) * Anta Houriyati [Remastered Version] (2016) * Kermali In collaboration with ABAAD NGO and women survivors of domestic violence (2016) * Le D\u00e9lire, EP french songs containing a cover of \"Ne Me Quitte Pas\" by the legendary Jacques Brel, adapted in Lebanese (2017) * J\u00e9sus de Nazareth \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem Soundtrack Musical in France (2017) * Bravo (2018) ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
