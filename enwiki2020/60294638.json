    "text": "Robbin Ami Silverberg (born 1958) is an American/Canadian artist specializing in artists' books. As a teacher, and a founder of both Dobbin Mill, a hand- papermaking studio, and Dobbin Books, an artists' book studio, Robbin has created great number of artists' books\u2014both on her own and in collaboration with other artists, all over the U.S., Canada, Europe, and South Africa. == Early life and education == Silverberg graduated from Princeton University in 1980 and began making her own paper in 1980. == Artist's books == While many of her works look like traditional books, some seem closer to sculpture. Her artists' books take months or years to create and involve a laborious process of producing, authoring and binding each book. In the article, \"Broaching texts and reading material: artist books by Robbin Ami Silverberg\" Lois Martin discusses four artists' books by Robbin Ami Silverberg that refer in some manner to cloth and clothmaking. Robbin Ami Silverberg, Brush (sequence of opening), 1995-1996 Robbin Ami Silverberg, Morning Prayer, 1997 Robbin Ami Silverberg, The Emperor's Clothes, 1997 == Paper-making == Silverberg runs a small papermaking studio called Dobbin Mill in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where she grows plants, using them for their fiber to make into paper. She also design, prints & binds her books and when needed writes the text. \"The paper I make is produced specifically for each book,\" says Ms. Silverberg, who also teaches book arts at the Pratt Institute in Clinton Hill. \"Since I'm starting from scratch, I might as well do everything from scratch.\" \"Basically you're taking a plant, pulling it apart in water, and then when you push out the water, the fibers try to bond together,\" she explains. \"It's just a chemical bonding that's going on. You're restructuring your plant into a paper form.\" == Exhibitions == Silverberg was featured in the 2016 \u2018Artists\u2019 Books and Africa,\u2019 exhibit at the Smithsonian Museum of African Art curated by Janet Stanley. She and Kim Berman worked with twenty-two African artists, each making a print of two people on the theme of creation, to create a surrealist \u2018Exquisite Corpse\u2019 work called \"Emandulo Re- Creation.\" Robbin's showed one work, a series of postings she put out in the streets of NYC, in the 2010 group show called, \"You Are Here \u2192 Mapping the Psychogeography of New York City\", at the Pratt Institute's Manhattan Gallery, guest curated by Katharine Harmonatt. On September 22, 2012, Silverberg participated on a panel at Yale University Art Gallery called, \"Ten Years Later: Artists Remember 9/11.\" == Selected awards == European University Flensburg, Germany, Dept Art & Media: Artist Residency, Summer 2017 Keynote speaker for Booknesses colloquium, Johannesburg, South Africa, Spring 2017 Pratt Institute Faculty Development Grant 2015 The College Book Art Association (CBAA), Oakland, CA 2012 == Reference == == External links == http://www.bookbindingnow.com/search/label/Robbin%20Silverberg http://robbinamisilverberg.com/ http://www.vampandtramp.com/finepress/d/dobbin.html Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American women artists Category:Papermakers Category:Princeton University alumni ",
