From an early age Istv\u00e1n was very good at drawing, and at the age of 14 he began his studies at Art College, which started his professional career. Teachers immediately took notice of his extraordinary personality and qualities of a leader and maximalist. In 1986 Istv\u00e1n began actively participating in regional, national and international exhibitions, and with his like-minded friends he organized a sensational imaginative association which they called \"Left Eye.\" Their exhibitions were a success and a great interest. This same group later organized a rock band, \"St. Pauli Guys,\" that was the start of a full-fledged creative, carefree. Of 1988 he took a job in the theater as a graphic designer, and began drawing again. In the works of Istv\u00e1n Moln\u00e1r, 1988\u20131989 was probably the most productive period of his life. During this time he created more than two dozen works that experts and critics associate to the Light period. In autumn 1989, Istv\u00e1n went to study at the Lviv Art Academy and rose to a whole new level in his development. The city of Lviv was the artistic center of Western Ukraine and the cradle of national traditions. The centuries-old history of Galicia was associated with the Russian Empire, Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and in it many cultures were interwoven. At the Lviv Art Academy, Istv\u00e1n finally decided on the art direction to take, and it was expressionism. Still, the academy staff did not support Moln\u00e1r in his choice and even complicated his life as they were able, but he was steadfast in his choice. He studied and practiced by drawing pictures in the style of European and world classics of the early twentieth century, often experimenting. He ended up falling in love with the outstanding work of Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele, engrossed once again, and this time for good. The creative association \"Left Eye\" was still developing. Istv\u00e1n and the others held exhibitions in Uzhhorod and Budapest, followed by collective exhibitions at the Lviv National Museum, Rzesz\u00f3w, Budapest, Berlin, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Madison. In the US, two of Istv\u00e1n's works were exhibited: \"Wolf-cub\" (1990) and \"Cats\" (1991). Istv\u00e1n did not part with his guitar even in the student dormitory. The music world of U2 walked beside him throughout his life and helped him reach new heights in creativity. The works of Egon Schiele influenced him on the deepest level and in 1992 a series of works were created, which Moln\u00e1r's contemporaries have yet to fully appreciate. It is important to remember that Istv\u00e1n was an exchange student. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Budapest one of the teachers encouraged his students to \"learn drawing from this guy.\" Many students took advantage of opportunity to stay in Budapest. In the end, Istv\u00e1n decided to return to Lviv and 1993, the last year of his life, was marked by a new series of paintings: \"Totem 1,\" \"Totem 2,\" \"Totem 3\" and \"Snail.\" A few days before his passing, he painted his \"tree of pain and bitterness\". Istv\u00e1n Moln\u00e1r died on June 21, 1993 in Uzhhorod. The artistic heritage of Istv\u00e1n Moln\u00e1r is disappointingly little. He drew no more than 60 paintings, which were sold to all corners of the world. But his exhibitions are still shown, from time to time there are publications, and TV programs about him have been aired. There is an interest in, and a need for his paintings. == References == == External links == * Istv\u00e1n Moln\u00e1r \u2013 Messenger of Eternity * Arck\u00e9pcsarnok \u2013 M\u0171v\u00e9szek: Moln\u00e1r Istv\u00e1n * YouTube- vide\u00f3: Moln\u00e1r Istv\u00e1n * Magyar m\u0171v\u00e9szet K\u00e1rp\u00e1talj\u00e1n (Moln\u00e1r Istv\u00e1n \u2013 299. old.) * \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0418\u0448\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0440 * In memoriam \u0418\u0448\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430: \u0432 \u0423\u0436\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 * \u0422\u043e\u0442, \u041a\u0442\u043e \u0421\u043f\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0416\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 Category:1968 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th- century Hungarian artists Category:Hungarian painters Category:Hungarian illustrators Category:20th-century Ukrainian painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Ukrainian illustrators Category:Soviet painters Category:Ukrainian people of Hungarian descent Category:Zakarpattia Oblast Category:Ukrainian male painters ",
