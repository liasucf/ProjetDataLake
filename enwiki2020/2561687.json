    "text": "The Temptations Do the Temptations is a 1976 album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. The Temptations' Motown contract was terminated after the release of the album. The group enjoyed the greatest creative control of their career, producing and writing most of the tracks. The album received virtually no promotional support from Motown, which didn't like that the Temptations had such creative freedom over the album. After four unsuccessful years at Atlantic Records, the group would return to Motown for twenty-four more years. ==Track listing== Side One #\"Why Can't You and Me Get Together\" (lead singers: Glenn Leonard, Richard Street, Melvin Franklin) - 4:54 #\"Who Are You (and What Are You Doing With The Rest Of Your Life)\" (lead singer: Dennis Edwards) - 4:34 #\"I'm On Fire (Body Song)\" (lead singer: Glenn Leonard) - 4:24 #\"Put Your Trust In Me, Baby\" (lead singer: Glenn Leonard, Melvin Franklin) - 3:58 Side Two #\"There Is No Stopping (Til We Set The Whole World Rockin')\" Producer/Writer/Arranger Michael Lovesmith (lead singers: Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, Melvin Franklin) - 5:02 #\"Let Me Count The Ways (I Love You)\" (lead singer: Melvin Franklin, Glenn Leonard, Richard Street) - 3:57 #\"Is There Anybody Else\" (lead singer: Glenn Leonard) - 4:55 #\"I'll Take You In\" Producer/Writer/Arranger Michael Lovesmith (lead singer: Dennis Edwards) - 5:01 ==Personnel== * Dennis Edwards - vocals * Glenn Leonard - vocals * Richard Street - vocals * Melvin Franklin - vocals * Otis Williams - vocals ==References== Category:1976 albums Category:The Temptations albums Category:Gordy Records albums ",
