Bowie (eldest brother of James Bowie) purchased land in the area in 1857. Construction of the Mississippi, Ouachita and Red River Railroad--the first chartered railway in Alabama--began in 1852, and of track had been laid west from Eunice by the start of the Civil War. The line passed through Bowie's land, and a stop there was called \"Bowie Station\". The railroad was completed after the war, but abandoned in 1875 after flooding on the Mississippi River damaged the railbed and bridges. Highway 208 between Eunice and Halley was built on the abandoned railbed. Bowie Station was later renamed \"Halley\" after early settlers, the Halley family. In 1901, a line of the Missouri Pacific Railroad was built through Halley. ==Infrastructure== The Halley Volunteer Fire Department is located in the settlement. ==Notable person== * Dewey Corley - musician in Memphis jug band ensembles. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Desha County, Arkansas Category:Unincorporated communities in Arkansas ",
