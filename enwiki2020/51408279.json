    "text": "Jean Pestr\u00e9, or Pestre, (1723, Saint-Geniez-d'Olt \u2013 1821, Paris) was an 18th\u201319th-century French theologian. He worked closely with the two encyclop\u00e9distes abb\u00e9s Claude Yvon and Jean-Martin de Prades. From 1751, all three shared an apartment in Paris and contributed to the first volume published in June 1751 of the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot and D\u2019Alembert. Abb\u00e9 Pestr\u00e9 wrote the articles signed \"C\", baconisme ou philosophie de Bacon, bonheur, cabale, calomnie, Campanella, Canadiens, Cardan, cart\u00e9sianisme and complaisance for volumes II and III. Marked by the philosophie des Lumi\u00e8res, his articles adopt a sensualist point of view. Pestre ceased to contribute to the Encyclop\u00e9die after the controversy surrounding the theory of the abbot of Prades which saw the temporary exile of the latter and Yvon. It is possible that, remained close to his compatriot abb\u00e9 Raynal, Pestr\u00e9 contributed anonymously to his Histoire des deux Indes. He later earned a living by giving private lessons, in particular to Antoine Allut, futur Encyclop\u00e9diste. == Bibliography == * * Matthias Gl\u00f6tzner: Wissen ist Macht - Die franz\u00f6sische Aufkl\u00e4rung im Spiegel der Encyclop\u00e9die.
