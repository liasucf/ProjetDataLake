Her agent recommended that she change her artistic name, resulting in the \"Lunna\" name. She met and became romantically involved with Puerto Rican rock and roll teen idol, Charlie Robles. This romance was highly publicized in Puerto Rico and soon they were married. Sockey and Charlie had a daughter, Lisa Marie, from this marriage; however, things didn't go well in the marriage and the couple ended up in divorce. ==Singing career== In 1982, Lunna traveled to Lima, Peru, to represent Puerto Rico at the OTI Festival, with the song \"Sin tu m\u00fasica\" (Without your music).

In 1992, Lunna reunited with Glen Monroig and they recorded the album Yo Que Te Ador\u00e9 (I, Who Have Adored You). In 2003, Lunna recorded Lunna de Bohemia, which included many classical boleros.
