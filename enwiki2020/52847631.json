Among his songs, one can find love songs, patriotic songs, songs about nature and about friendship and humorous songs. His song \"Ammunition Hill\" (Hebrew: Givat Hatachmoshet) is among many that struck a chord with the public due to its authentic description of the battle at Jerusalem's Ammunition Hill during the Six-Day War. \"Be My Friend, Be My Brother\" (Hebrew: Heye li Haver Heye li Ach) is about friendship and \"The Ballad of Yoel Moshe Salomon\" (Hebrew: HaBalada Shel Yoel Salomon) sung by Arik Einstein, which starts off with the words \"On a humid morning in 1878\" (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d7 \u05d1\u05e9\u05e0\u05ea \u05ea\u05e8\u05dc\"\u05d7 BeVoker Lach BiShnat Tarlach) is a description of an episode in Israeli history (the founding of the town of Petah Tikva). ===Secular reading of Holy books=== After writing hundreds of poems, Taharlev dedicated himself to reading and writing about traditional Jewishbooks and writings.

His slogan is \"learn with joy and smile\"! He stated \"If the religious and traditional books were being conveying to us in such way and a smile, we could find out much more about our roots and we wouldn\u2019t be so detached from them\". Israeli Prize laureate Eliyahu Ha'Cohen said, \"although being born in a kibbutz and a main lyricist of the army bands and pop songs, Taharlev drowns a lot of his motives and inspiration from the bible; he is the most 'Jewish' among the Israeli lyricists\". ===Songs=== During the agriculture Jewish Biblical holidays, the National memorial ceremonies, weddings and the earth reserving battles, his songs are played. \"Go and walkabout the country\", became the slogan of the Nature reserve associations, \"Be my friend, be my brother\" is sang at every memorial, \"Ammunitions Hill\" became a symbol of Independence day ceremonies, the \"Green mountain\" (about the Carmel mountain where Taharlev was born) is a symbol of the Tu be\u2019Svat holiday (the trees holiday).
