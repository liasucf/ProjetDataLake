    "text": "The 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup football tournament was the sixth FIFA Confederations Cup, held in France in June 2003. France retained the title they had won in 2001, but the tournament was overshadowed by the death of Cameroon player Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9, who died of heart failure in his side's semi- final against Colombia. Fo\u00e9's death united the France and Cameroon teams in the final match, which was played even though team players from both sides had explicitly stated that the match should not be played out of respect for Fo\u00e9. France went on to win the trophy with a golden goal from Thierry Henry. At the presentation of medals and trophies, two Cameroon players held a gigantic photo of Fo\u00e9, and a runner-up medal was hung to the edge of the photo. When French captain Marcel Desailly was presented with the Confederations Cup, he did not lift it up high, but held it in unison with Cameroon captain Rigobert Song. Fo\u00e9 finished third in media voting for player of the tournament and was posthumously awarded the Bronze Ball at its conclusion. ==Qualified teams== 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup participating teams Red \u2013 Participated in Group A Blue \u2013 Participated in Group B {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Confederation !Qualification method !Date qualification secured !Participation no. |- | |UEFA |UEFA Euro 2000 winners Hosts |align=center|2 July 2000 24 September 2002 |align=center|2nd |- | |CONMEBOL |2002 FIFA World Cup winners |align=center|30 June 2002 |align=center|4th |- | |AFC |2000 AFC Asian Cup winners |align=center|29 October 2000 |align=center|3rd |- | |CONMEBOL |2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica winners |align=center|29 July 2001 |align=center|1st |- | |CONCACAF |2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup winners |align=center|2 February 2002 |align=center|3rd |- | |CAF |2002 African Cup of Nations winners |align=center|10 February 2002 |align=center|2nd |- | |UEFA |2002 FIFA World Cup third place1 |align=center|22 October 2002Turkey accept Confederations Cup invitation |align=center|1st |- | |OFC |2002 OFC Nations Cup winners |align=center|14 July 2002 |align=center|2nd |} 1Italy, the UEFA Euro 2000 runners-up, declined to take part as did Germany, the 2002 FIFA World Cup runners-up. So did Spain, who were ranked second in the FIFA World Rankings at the time. They were replaced by Turkey, who came third in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. ==Bid process== Five bids came before the deadline at 1 May 2002. Australia, Portugal and the United States put in single bids, while South Africa\u2013Egypt and France\u2013Switzerland put in joint bids. The France\u2013Switzerland bid never materialized.
