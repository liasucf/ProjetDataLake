It is a key academic resource that supports the teaching, learning, and research goals of the university; its various materials can be accessed by students, scholars, and the general public. Almost 70% are books and periodicals, donated by individuals, institutions and organizations from around the world. Library is composed of several locations across the university campus. Amongst the collection are many rare items such as one of the four extant copies of The Travels of Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch by Paul of Aleppo. == History == Estimated date of creation of the Kyiv Mohyla book collection is unknown. Approximately, it began to function in times of Kyiv Brotherhood School, since 1615. Significant contribution to the formation of the Library later did Petro Mohyla, who showed special concern in enriching library collections. He bequeathed his own book collection a few days before he died. But the terrible fire in 1658 almost completely destroyed the Library. By the 18yh century the Library has totaled 3,500 books in different languages, especially in Latin. By late 18 century there were 12 000 items. In the 19th century library was transferred to Kyiv Theological Academy with total collection approximately 150 000 items. Since 1920s part of Library is transferred to Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine. In 1992 library was opened in renewed University. It was firstly located in Blagovischennia Church and then in rooms of the revived university. Closure of the Theological Academy in the early 20th century and events that followed the October Revolution, led to almost complete destruction of the Library. During the years of the totalitarian regime, most of the books were either lost or transferred to other institutions. Books that survived are now located in the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine. == Library locations and facilities == === Research Library === Research Library was in Old Academy Building till 2017 Old Academic Building is one of the architectural landmarks of the Kontraktova Ploscha which is located on Podil, the oldest district of Kyiv.
