He was born in B\u0103ile\u0219ti, Oltenia, and attended the Carol I High School. He later played at the Craiova Theatre, then at the Small Theatre, Nottara Theatre, Comedy Theatre and the National Theatre Bucharest, being also a professor at the Academy of Theatre and Film in Bucharest. Pellea played numerous comic and serious roles. In the cinema was most noted for his roles as historical leaders. His earliest leading roles were as Romanian national heroes, beginning with Decebalus in Dacii (1967) and Columna (1968). He also portrayed Michael the Brave in Mihai Viteazul (1971). His most famous comic role was as \"Nea M\u0103rin\" (Uncle Marin), a character representing the archetypal Oltenian peasant. M\u0103rin first appeared in TV comedy sketches. The character graduated to the cinema in Nea M\u0103rin miliardar (Uncle Marin, the Billionaire), in which Pellea played the dual role of the naive Marin and the American billionaire he is mistaken for. Nea M\u0103rin miliardar is ranked 1 in the top most viewed Romanian films of all time. He played other historical figures such as Vladic\u0103 Hariton in Tudor din Vladimiri and Voivode Basarab in Croitorii cei mari din Valahia. He also appeared in R\u0103scoala and Haiducii. In 1977 he won the award for Best Actor at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival for his role in The Doom. He is buried at Bellu Cemetery. In a 2006 poll conducted by Romanian Television to identify the \"100 greatest Romanians of all time\", Pellea came in 58th. ==Selected filmography== * Thirst (1961) * Dacii (1967) * Mihai Viteazul (1971) * Ulzana (1974) * Tat\u0103 de duminic\u0103 (1975) * The Doom (1976) * The Punishment (1976) * Mihail, c\u00e2ine de circ (1979) * Nea M\u0103rin miliardar (1979) ==References== ==External links== * * Web site dedicated to Amza Pellea Category:Romanian male actors Category:Romanian comedians Category:Carol I National College alumni Category:People from B\u0103ile\u0219ti Category:Burials at Bellu Category:1931 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th-century Romanian male actors Category:Male comedians Category:20th-century comedians ",
