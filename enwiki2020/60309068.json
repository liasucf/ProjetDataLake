    "text": "Anemone is a psychedelic pop quintet, styled \"ANEMONE\" mispronounced, which formed in Montreal, Quebec in September 2015. Named after the song \"Anemone\" by The Brian Jonestown Massacre, it is fronted by the multi-talented pianist and singer Chlo\u00e9 Soldevila, a Montreal native with classical music training in the flute and piano for which she received special mention in high school, the band's compositions feature both baroque influences and counter melody. Their current touring line-up consists of music veterans drummer Miles Dupire- Gagnon, guitarist Gabriel Lambert, bass guitarist Samuel Gemme, and finally guitarist and backing vocalist Zach Irving. They have been critically regarded as Montreal's best new psych band, and topped Paste magazine's list of the ten bands they were most excited to see at the 2019 Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho, as well as being second on Inlander's must-see list. They received a SOCAN Songwriting Prize nomination for the song \"She's the One\".\"SOCAN Songwriting Prize Unveils 2019 Finalists\".
