    "text": "Vladimir \"Vlado\" Pravdi\u0107 (born 6 December 1949) is a Bosnian musician most famous as the organist of the Yugoslav rock group Bijelo dugme from 1974 to 1976 and again from 1978 to 1987. Born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia as the only child of a Croat father and a Ukrainian mother, Pravdi\u0107's parents divorced during his adolescence as the youngster remained living with his mother. Pravdi\u0107 enrolled in musical school at the age of seven and learned to play the piano. After completing his secondary schooling, he studied Physics at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Pravdi\u0107's musical activity began during 1965 in Vokinsi, whom he was with until 1968. He would go on to play in Kost from 1968\u20131970, Ambasadori from 1970\u20131971 and Indexi from 1971\u20131973. While gigging with Indexi over summer 1973, he struck up a friendship with Goran Bregovi\u0107 who at the time had a band called Jutro. The two hit it off immediately, and Pravdi\u0107 decided to join Jutro, which would soon be transformed into the highly influential Bijelo dugme as of 1 January 1974. Pravdi\u0107 played on Bijelo dugme's first two albums Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme and \u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu before commencing his compulsory military service in fall 1976, when he got replaced by Laza Ristovski. He returned to Bijelo dugme in 1978 and went on to play until 1987. During the late 1980s, Pravdi\u0107 moved to Palm Desert in the United States where he has been living ever since. Pravdi\u0107 joined the rest of the band in the 2005 farewell tour. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina musicians Category:Rock keyboardists Category:People from Sarajevo ",
