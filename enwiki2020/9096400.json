He played there for a year, proving himself as one of the brightest young talents in the country, which recommended him for the Yugoslav youth basketball team. While in China with the national team, he signed a contract with KK Crvena zvezda. He stayed in Belgrade for 3 years, helping Crvena zvezda win the 2004 National Cup. Surviving tough competition in Belgrade, with Scoonie Penn and Igor Rako\u010devi\u0107 playing alongside him, he established himself as one of the top guards in the Adriatic League. After a very successful campaign in Belgrade, he moved to BC Dynamo Saint Petersburg, but failed to play a single game there, as the Russian club went bankrupt before the season started. At the peak of his career, without a contract in the middle of competitive season in Europe, he was offered a contract from the most successful Montenegrin basketball team, KK Budu\u0107nost. To his disappointment, the team did not compete in any of the European basketball competitions. It is, however, a highly competitive team in the Adriatic League, and Jeretin quickly became heart and soul of the talented, but extremely young squad. His average of 18 points per game was just a small piece of his great all around performance this year. He helped Budu\u0107nost beat KK Crvena zvezda, KK Partizan, KK Union Olimpija among others. His dominant performance in Adriatic League brought him to the attention of one of the greatest European teams, Maccabi Tel Aviv. He signed an 18-month contract with Israeli team in January 2007, playing his first game for the team on 1 February 2007. On 17 July 2007, Jeretin signed for the 2007\u201308 season with German club Alba Berlin.Goran Jeretin ist neuer Aufbauspieler der Albatrosse During the 2008\u201309 season, Jeretin played for Proteas EKA AEL and then BC Kyiv.

On 31 December 2012, Jeretin signed with the Cypriot team AEK Larnaca till the end of the season. ==National team career== While being one of the top guards in Serbia and Montenegro in past few years, he never had a true chance to show his skills in the senior national team, due to tough competition. In an interview given to Montenegrin TV station IN TV, he stated that he would play for the Montenegrin national team. == Post-playing career == Jeretin was a general manager of Sutjeska. ==Player profile== Standing at 192 cm (6 feet 4 inches), he is a combo guard. He is a good ball-handler and passer, and a very good shooter, making him very difficult to guard. He scores in clusters from the perimeter, medium range, as well as while driving to the basket. He is considered quick and strong for a guard, allowing him to play very tough defense. At Budu\u0107nost, he also showed his ability to perform under pressure, hitting several clutch shots. ==References== ==External links== * ABA League Profile * Euroleague.net Profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:ABA League players Category:AEK Larnaca B.C. players Category:AEL Limassol (basketball) players Category:Alba Berlin players Category:Artland Dragons players Category:BC Dynamo Saint Petersburg players Category:BC Kyiv players Category:BC Rytas players Category:Israeli Basketball Premier League players Category:KK Budu\u0107nost players Category:KK Crvena zvezda players Category:KK Lov\u0107en players Category:KK Olimpija players Category:Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C. players Category:Montenegrin expatriate basketball people in Lithuania Category:Montenegrin expatriate basketball people in Russia Category:Montenegrin expatriate basketball people in Serbia Category:Montenegrin men's basketball players Category:PBC Lokomotiv-Kuban players Category:Point guards Category:Sportspeople from Nik\u0161i\u0107 Category:T\u00fcrk Telekom B.K. players ",
