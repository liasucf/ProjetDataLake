He became a factory worker in 1969, where frequent power failures enabled him to read voraciously. He started writing poetry (free verse) at the age of twenty. He studied in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, at Yunnan University, and was a literary activist, organising events and editing publications. His career as a published poet took off when his poem \"6 Shangyi Street\" was published in China's leading poetry journal Shikan in 1986.
