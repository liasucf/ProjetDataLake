    "text": "The seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series range consists of the BMW G20 (sedan version) and BMW G21 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring') compact executive cars. The G20/G21 has been in production since mid-October of 2018 and is often collectively referred to as the G20. The M340i, one of the first models in the range became available for sale in the spring of 2019, with the 330e plug-in hybrid model scheduled for launch in 2020. The 3 Series Gran Turismo fastback body style was discontinued for the G20 generation. == Development and launch == At the end of November 2015, a final design proposal for the successor of the F30 3 Series by Alexey Kezha out of 3 total, was chosen by BMW management, as reported by Auto Bild in October 2015. The new 3 Series, internally called the G20, was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show on October 2, 2018, and was available for sale in March 2019. The G20 3 Series is based on the Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform and features increased use of high-strength steel and aluminium. The G20 has a MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension, with a hydraulic damping system to better absorb impacts. The G20 has a flat and covered underbody, resulting in a reduced drag coefficient from 0.26 to 0.23 for the 320d. Compared to its predecessor, the G20 is lighter, longer, and wider. The car retains a 50:50 weight distribution and has a 50% increase in body rigidity. Boot capacity is identical to the F30, at . The windshield uses double-glazed acoustic glass and the A-pillars have increased insulation. The handbrake is now electronically operated and no longer uses a manual lever. Engine coasting is also now available in both Eco Pro and Comfort modes, and both petrol and diesel models receive engine particulate filters. The 320d and M340i are available in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive (xDrive) variants. The Touring variant (G21) was launched on 12 June 2019. An electric version for the Chinese market is scheduled for release by 2023. === Equipment === The G20 is available in Advantage, Sport Line, Luxury Line, or M Sport package. Standard equipment includes full LED headlights and tail-lights, automatic climate control, automatic headlights and rain-sensing wipers, 40:20:40 split folding rear seats, and driver assistance systems including lane departure warning and collision warning with braking intervention. All models feature iDrive 6.0 with an 8.8-inch display. The system can be upgraded to Operating System 7.0 with a 10.25-inch display and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. iDrive 7.0 has over-the-air updates for the navigational maps and operating system, and features a voice-controlled digital assistant that can be activated by saying \"Hey BMW\". The assistant can control in-car functions and is integrated with Microsoft Office 365 and Skype for Business. The engine start stop system uses the navigation system to prevent unnecessary engine shutdowns. Optional equipment includes the BMW LaserLight, a BMW display key, self-righting wheel center caps, and a Welcome Light Carpet. A Digital Key system enables a smartphone to lock or unlock the vehicle using near-field communication, and will start the engine when placed in the wireless charging tray. The optional parking assistant system displays a three-dimensional 360 degree view of the car and its surroundings, which can also be remotely viewed in the BMW ConnectedDrive app. Only 318d and 320d models are available with a 6-speed manual transmission. BMW had controversially implemented a yearly fee for access to Apple CarPlay, a feature built into the car, and for which BMW pays no yearly fee or other ongoing expense. As of December 2019 it is reported that this fee will no longer be charged as BMW has backtracked on this decision. In March 2019 at the Geneva Motor Show the 330e iPerformance model was introduced, sharing its engine with the 320i and a electric motor, it has a maximum electric range of . It has a 12 kWh battery (9.6 kWh usable) along with a newly developed system called \"XtraBoost\" allowing a temporary power increase from the electric motor of up to . == Models == === Petrol engines === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Model !!
