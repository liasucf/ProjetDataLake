He suggested that longtime fans of Satriani's regular material may be disappointed, as well as those who dislike electronic sounds in guitar-based music, but praised Satriani for challenging himself to \"find ways of coaxing totally new sounds from his guitar\", and that \"his melodies and main themes have rarely been this angular and off-kilter, meaning that exploring this music has indeed helped Satriani refresh and re-imagine his signature sound.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Joe Satriani \u2013 guitar, keyboard, programming, arrangement, production *Eric Caudieux \u2013 keyboard, programming, bass, arrangement, editing, engineering, mixing, production *Anton Fig \u2013 drums *Pat Thrall \u2013 bass *Enrique Gonzalez \u2013 engineering assistance *Mike Pilar \u2013 engineering assistance *Mike Fraser \u2013 mixing *Howie Weinberg \u2013 mastering *Kevin Shirley \u2013 production ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
