Saeqeh aircraft were tested successfully in Iran 20 September 2007. ==Development== The first prototype of the jet was shown on state television making a test flight in July 2004. In that exercise, which began on August 19, 2006, the new fighter carried out actions described as \"a mission to bomb virtual enemy targets\" and \"a mock bombing mission\". Two prototypes, which appeared to differ from the one that had been shown previously, conducted a fly-past at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport on 20 September 2007. Three prototypes took part in a military parade on 22 September 2007. Iran has announced that it will test fly the other variants of the Saeqeh in the near future which will differ from the previous aircraft due to major changes in its weapon system, aerodynamics and operational range. In September 2010, Iran displayed the first squadron of Saeqeh fighter jets produced during an air show staged during the military parades at the beginning of the Iranian Sacred Defence Week according to the FARS News Agency. In May 2012 Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi stated that three new-generation Saeqeh fighters had been manufactured and delivered to the Air Force. On 26 August 2012, deputy Defence Minister Mohammad Eslami announced that an upgraded version of the Saeqeh would be introduced in the Iranian Air Force by the end of 2013. ==Design== Little information on the specifications of the Saeqeh has been released.

The airframe resembles a Northrop F-5 with two vertical stabilizers instead of one. In 2008, Iran announced the aircraft has a range of . The fighter-bomber has the ability to track down enemy aircraft, engage in combat, target locations on the ground and carry an assortment of weapons and ammunition. The visual differences between the Saeqeh and the original Northrop F-5E remain limited to two vertical tail stabilizers instead of one, additional wing strakes and altered jet intakes. Fuselage, landing gear, engines, weaponry and cockpit instruments appear identical to the F-5E, which indicates that the Saequeh is not a new-built jet fighter, but a modification of existing Northrop F-5s. ===Saeqeh-2=== A new version was introduced in 2015 with 2 seats, more advanced weapon systems, electronics and avionics. This model can also be used for training purposes. According to one Iranian military source: The IRIAF is believed to have 17 Northrop F-5F aircraft remaining in its inventory, which may be suitable for conversion to the Saeqeh-2 configuration. ==Operators== ; * Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force ==Specifications (Saeqeh)== 300px ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Citations ==External links== * \"New Iranian-made warplane revealed\" * * \"Saeqeh Specifications Persian\" * IHS Jane\u00b4s reports on 2-seater Saeqeh Saeqeh Category:2000s Iranian fighter aircraft Category:Twinjets Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 2004 ",
