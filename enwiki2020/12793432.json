    "text": "State Route 132 (SR-132) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah. It connects U.S. Route 6 (US-6) in Lynndyl to US-89 at Pigeon Hollow Junction, crossing Interstate 15 (I-15) in Nephi. ==Route description== SR-132 between Lynndyl and Nephi The route starts in Millard County at US-6 in Lynndyl, north of Delta and south of Little Sahara Recreation Area, and travels east through Leamington before turning northeast and entering Juab County. The route continues northeast, crossing the Sevier River, gradually turning east before entering Nephi and crossing I-15. Leaving Nephi, the route enters Salt Creek Canyon, where it intersects the Nebo Loop Scenic Byway, before turning southeast, entering Sanpete County. From here, the route turns south- southeast, passing through Fountain Green and Moroni, after which the route turns south through Chester before ending at the intersection with US-89. ==History== The route was formally established in 1933 with the purpose of connecting Nephi to US-50, which is now US-6. In 1945, the route was swapped with SR-148, forming the present route west of Nephi. In 1969, the route was extended east to Pigeon Hollow Junction along a roadway that had been signed as U.S. Route 189 in the 1930s. The road from US-91 (now SR-28) in Nephi to and beyond Pigeon Hollow Junction was added to the state highway system in 1910, and became part of State Route 11 in the 1920s. As the part south of Pigeon Hollow Junction was (and still is) marked as US-89, the Nephi-Pigeon Hollow Junction connection was marked as a branch, US-189, from about 1930 until 1938 (when a new US-189 was created). West of Nephi, State Route 132 was formed in 1933 to connect Nephi to US-50 (now US-6) near Jericho. State Route 148 was also formed at that time, connecting US-50 in Lynndyl to Leamington, and two years later it was extended to meet SR-132 west of Nephi. SR-132 and SR-148 were swapped in 1945, giving SR-132 its current route west of Nephi. SR-148 was removed from the state highway system in 1969, and at the same time, SR-132 was extended east to Pigeon Hollow Junction, replacing part of SR-11. (The next piece to the south became part of SR-32.) ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== 132 132 132 132 ",
