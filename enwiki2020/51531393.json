    "text": "Soul Mate is a 2016 Chinese romantic drama film directed by Derek Tsang, based on the novel of the same name by Anni Baobei. It stars Zhou Dongyu and Sandra Ma. It was released in China on September 14, 2016. ==Plot== Thirty year-old working woman Li Ansheng's life in Shanghai is suddenly disrupted by the publication of a novel, entitled \"Qiyue and Ansheng\", a chronicle of her friendship with Qi Yue during her youth. Coupled with an accidental encounter with Su Jia Ming, a past love, her long repressed memories are unleashed with the force of a tsunami. The two girls seemed destined to become friends from the moment they entered high school. Though they were unseparable and believed that their bond would last for the rest of their lives, the cruelty of youth eventually led them to separate paths. Even more shocking is the discovery of a long buried secret shared by the women - a secret that serves as an emblem of their youth and the proof of their friendship. ==Cast== * Zhou Dongyu as Li Ansheng * Sandra Ma as Lin Qiyue * Toby Lee as Su Jiaming ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 9 reviews. Edmund Lee of South China Morning Post commended the film for transcending its potentially cloying premise to tell a story of friendship and love that\u2019s at once melancholy and very emotional. Both Zhou and Ma were credited for the film's success with their skillful displays of raw emotion. Soul Mate received 7 nominations at the annual Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards in 2016, and made history with a joint Best Actress win. ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Awards !
