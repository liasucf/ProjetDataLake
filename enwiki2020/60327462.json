It was the world's fair in America that had hosted the most foreign exhibitors at that time, including China and Japan. Henry A. Peirce was the Special Commissioner for the Hawaii (then Kingdom of Hawaii) exhibition. Although a locally organized exhibition, Congress sanctioned the inclusion of exhibits without duty. Morris & Co. exhibited and occupied six rooms (total space forty-five feet by thirty feet) showing tapestries and carpets. ==References== Category:1883 establishments in Massachusetts Category:1884 disestablishments in Massachusetts Category:1890s in Massachusetts Category:Events in Boston Category:World's fairs in the United States ",
