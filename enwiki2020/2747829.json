He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1962 to 1970 for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Tartabull is well remembered by Red Sox fans for throwing out the Chicago White Sox' Ken Berry at home plate on August 27, 1967, to win a key game during the 1967 American League pennant drive. In the bottom of the ninth inning with Boston leading 4\u20133 with one out at Comiskey Park, in the first of two scheduled that day, the contending White Sox had the fleet Berry at third base with one out. Pinch hitter Duane Josephson lofted a fly ball to Tartabull in medium right field \u2014 a probable sacrifice fly that would have tied the game. Tartabull was not known for a strong arm, but his throw, though high, arrived in time to beat Berry to home plate, where Red Sox catcher Elston Howard made the catch while blocking the plate, then swept a tag on Berry to end the game.retrosheet.org The Red Sox would win the AL championship by a single game on the final day of the season. The play is the subject of a novel, Tartabull's Throw, by Henry Garfield, published by Simon & Schuster in 2001. Tartabull also was known for his speed and was always a threat to steal on the basepaths. In 749 games over nine major league seasons, Tartabull posted a .261 batting average (484-for-1857) scoring 247 runs, with two home runs and 107 RBI. A good outfielder, he recorded a .986 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions, committing only 14 errors in 980 total chances. Tartabull was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba. He and his wife lived in Puerto Rico before moving to the United States. Their son, Danny Tartabull, was an All- Star major league baseball player, primarily with the Seattle Mariners, Kansas City Royals, and New York Yankees. ==References== ==External links== *Retrosheet *SABR BioProject *Venezuelan Professional Baseball League Category:1938 births Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Eugene Emeralds players Category:Hastings Giants players Category:Iowa Oaks players Category:Kansas City Athletics players Category:Leones de Yucat\u00e1n players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Living people Category:Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Cuba Category:Mexican League baseball players Category:Michigan City White Caps players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:People from Cienfuegos Category:Pittsfield Red Sox players Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Rio Grande Valley Giants players Category:Vancouver Mounties players Category:Victoria Giants players ",
