It was released on April 27, 1993, through Epic Records. ==Overview== Brad formed officially in 1992, although the band members had been playing together for a long time before that. The band originally wanted to go by the name Shame, but the name was already taken by a band featuring musician Brad Wilson.Gumbuoy. \"Hang Out In Discovery Park With Brad\". fasterlouder.com.au. September 27, 2005. Instead, the band took the name Brad and decided to name their debut album Shame. The album was recorded in October 1992 in roughly 20 days at Avast Recording Co. in Seattle, Washington. Many tracks are taken from in- studio jam sessions. The band members produced the album themselves. The album was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. The album's cover art was provided by Seattle's Crocodile Cafe. Shame, featuring a raw sound and an eclectic mix of styles, was released to mixed reviews and moderate sales.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas and Torreano, Bradley. \"[ Brad]\". Allmusic. Retrieved on January 31, 2009. The track \"20th Century\" was a minor hit in the UK. The album charted at number 14 on Billboards Top Heatseekers chart. Deborah Frost of Entertainment Weekly said that \"Brad, a grunge-lite foursome Gossard tossed together during the odd fortnight off from his main gig, sounds as if he merely wanted to sharpen his riffing tools (and give some more locals a break) before plunging into Pearl Jam's second effort.\" Music videos were made for the songs \"Buttercup\" and \"20th Century\". In 2014, the album placed sixth on the Alternative Nation site's \"Top 10 Underrated 90\u2019s Alternative Rock Albums\" list.http://www.alternativenation.net/top-10-underrated-90s-alternative-rock- albums/ ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Brad *Stone Gossard \u2013 guitars *Regan Hagar \u2013 drums, cover and package design *Shawn Smith \u2013 vocals, piano, organ, guitar on \"Down\" *Jeremy Toback \u2013 bass guitar, lead vocals and organ on \"Down\" ;Additional musicians and production *Jenny Behe \u2013 mixing assistance *Brad \u2013 production *Greg Calbi \u2013 mastering *Crocodile Cafe, Seattle, Washington \u2013 cover photo *Brett Eliason \u2013 second engineer *Sony Felito \u2013 post-pro engineering *Bashiri Johnson \u2013 percussion *Eric Johnson \u2013 disc art *Stuart Hallerman \u2013 Avast assistance *Noel Lakey \u2013 first engineer *Mark Lindsay \u2013 painting *Lance Mercer \u2013 band photos *Brendan O'Brien \u2013 mixing *Joel Zimmerman \u2013 Epic art direction ==Chart positions== ===Album=== {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" !
