    "text": "The Cops were an Australian rock band that formed in late 2003 by songwriter Simon Carter and bass player/keyboardist Rebecca Darwon (ex-Fyreflyes, Del- Emmas) in Sydney, New South Wales. ==Biography== Initially, Simon Carter began recording songs in his parents' basement, which were unlikely to see the light of day, until he sat down with his bass-playing friend Bec Darwon and offered to play her his demos. The Cops' original line-up also included Simon Meli (The Widowbirds), Jimmy Stacks (who previously played with Carter in 'General Lee'), Andrew Gilbert (Whom Carter played with in 'Hush Honey') and Nick Kennedy (ex-Big Heavy Stuff). In early 2004, the band released their debut self-titled E.P. on Reverberation. In late 2004, The Cops signed with small independent record label Love Police Records, releasing the debut album Stomp On Tripwires in September that year. In 2005, the band undertook numerous tours, with support slots for bands such as Blondie, The Dirtbombs, The Distillers, The Donnas, Dallas Crane and The Von Bondies; while also receiving nominations for 'Best Newcomer' and 'Best Bass Player' at the 2005 Jack Awards. In May 2005, Jimmy Stacks left the band. This was followed by the departure of guitarist Andrew Gilbert and drummer Nick Kennedy. Carter and Darwon decided to rebuild the band, with Todd Smith being retained on keys, Jarrod Murphy, (ex-Major) on guitar and Nicholai Danko (78 Saab) on drums. The band also left their label, Love Police Records, and signed to Inertia Recordings in 2006 as the label's first exclusive recording artist. The new line-up of the band recorded and released an EP entitled 80 In The Shade in November 2006. The EP's lead single, \"Call Me Anytime,\" received significant airplay on numerous indie radio stations; with the video being played on MTV, Channel [V] and Rage. The song ended up placing at #33 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2006. Making Triple J's Hottest 100 was a significant achievement for the band, as founding member Simon Carter stated: In 2007, The Cops supported !!! (Chk Chk Chk) on their east coast tour; as well as Kaiser Chiefs in March, followed by a performance at The Great Escape Festival in April. The Cops released their second album, titled Drop It In Their Laps, on 28 April 2007, which was followed by a promotional tour and a national tour with Expatriate. The album spawned two singles, \"Cop Pop\" and \"The Message,\" the latter of which came in at number 88 in the 2007 Hottest 100. In early 2008, founding member Beck Darwon left the band because she no longer wished to tour. Rather than continue on, Simon Carter decided to put the band on indefinite hiatus and pursue a solo career. The demise of The Cops also saw the end of the working relationship between the band and Inertia. Carter released a solo record, The Black Book Of The Universe, on Rusty Hopkinson's Illustrious Artists imprint in 2010. In April 2015, Carter announced that The Cops would return for two headlining shows in Melbourne in May at the Northcote Social Club and Sydney in July at the Newtown Social Club. The shows intended to focus on the Stomp on Tripwires era of the band. Only Carter and Smith remained from the previous lineup; with Carter assembling a new line-up of Cec Condon (The Mess Hall) on drums, James Roden (The City Lights) on guitar and Archi Fires (Hell City Glamours, Black Ryder) on bass. Following the shows, Carter announced on Facebook that the new line-up and reunion of the band was permanent; and both a third studio album and further touring were both deemed \"imminent.\" The band were also announced for the 2015 Newtown Festival in Camperdown Memorial Rest Park. The band released a new single, entitled \"Move Over Money,\" in September 2015. On 6 October 2015, it was officially announced that founding guitarist Jimmy Stacks was to rejoin the band. Ultimately, the reunion ceased activity in 2016; with Carter returning to making music as a solo artist. ==Band members== * Simon Carter \u2014 lead vocals, guitar (2003\u20142008; 2015\u20132016) * Andrew Gilbert \u2014 guitar (2003\u20132005) * Jimmy Stacks \u2014 guitar (2003\u20132005, 2015\u20142016) * Nicholai Danko \u2014 drums (2005\u20142007) * Todd Smith \u2014 keyboard, synthesizer, percussion, backing vocals (2005\u20142008; 2015\u20132016) * Simon Meli \u2014 guitar, vocals (2003) * Rebecca Darwon \u2014 bass, vocals (2003\u20142008) * Nicholas Kennedy \u2014 drums (2003\u20142005, 2008) * Jarrod Murphy \u2014 guitar, vocals (2006\u20142008) * Cec Condon \u2014 drums (2015\u20132016) * James Roden \u2014 guitar, backing vocals (2015\u20132016) * Archi Fires \u2014 bass (2015\u20132016) === Timeline === ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:30 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:60 top:0 right:30 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/2003 till:06/01/2016 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:3 start:2003 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2003 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:keyboard value:purple legend:Keyboards id:lines value:black legend:Releases LineData = at:08/27/2004 color:black layer:back at:09/20/2004 color:black layer:back at:11/04/2006 color:black layer:back at:04/11/2007 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Simon text:\"Simon Carter\" bar:Bec text:\"Bec Darwon\" bar:Andrew text:\"Andrew Gilbert\" bar:SimonM text:\"Simon Meli\" bar:Jimmy text:\"Jimmy Stacks\" bar:Nicholas text:\"Nicholas Kennedy\" bar:Todd text:\"Todd Smith\" bar:Jarrod text:\"Jarrod Murphy\" bar:Nicholai text:\"Nicholai Danko\" bar:Cec text:\"Cec Condon\" bar:James text:\"James Roden\" bar:Archi text:\"Archi Fires\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Simon from:01/01/2003 till:01/31/2008 color:vocals bar:Simon from:01/01/2003 till:01/31/2008 color:guitar width:3 bar:Simon from:04/17/2015 till:end color:vocals bar:Simon from:04/17/2015 till:end color:guitar width:3 bar:Bec from:01/01/2003 till:01/31/2008 color:bass bar:Bec from:01/01/2003 till:01/31/2008 color:vocals width:3 bar:Andrew from:01/01/2003 till:06/01/2005 color:guitar bar:SimonM from:01/01/2003 till:06/01/2003 color:guitar bar:SimonM from:01/01/2003 till:06/01/2003 color:vocals width:3 bar:Jimmy from:01/01/2003 till:05/01/2005 color:guitar bar:Jimmy from:10/06/2015 till:end color:guitar bar:Nicholas from:01/01/2003 till:07/01/2005 color:drums bar:Nicholas from:01/01/2008 till:01/31/2008 color:drums bar:Todd from:01/01/2005 till:01/31/2008 color:keyboard bar:Todd from:01/01/2005 till:01/31/2008 color:vocals width:3 bar:Todd from:04/17/2015 till:end color:keyboard bar:Todd from:04/17/2015 till:end color:vocals width:3 bar:Jarrod from:05/01/2005 till:01/31/2008 color:guitar bar:Jarrod from:05/01/2005 till:01/31/2008 color:vocals width:3 bar:Nicholai from:07/01/2005 till:12/31/2007 color:drums bar:Cec from:04/17/2015 till:end color:drums bar:James from:04/17/2015 till:end color:guitar bar:James from:04/17/2015 till:end color:vocals width:3 bar:Archi from:04/17/2015 till:end color:bass == Discography == ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
