Hind wings are grey.Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description The larvae feed on Filipendula vulgaris, Rosa canina, Rosa pendulina, Rosa sempervirens, Sanguisorba minor and Sanguisorba officinalis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a strongly contorted, intestine-like corridor with brown and coiled frass. The last part of the corridor often follows the leaf margin for some distance. At the end, the corridor widens into an elongate blotch. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. ==References== ==External links== *bladmineerders.nl *Ectoedemia angulifasciella at UKMoths *Swedish moths *Nepticulidae from the Volga and Ural region *Ectoedemia angulifasciella images at Consortium for the Barcode of Life Category:Nepticulidae Category:Moths of Europe ",
