She made her debut with the book Sm\u00e4rtpunkten - Lars Nor\u00e9n, pj\u00e4sen Sju tre och morden i Malexander. The book was nominated for the August prize for non-fiction in 2009, and is translated into Polish. In August 2011 she released the book Och i Wienerwald st\u00e5r tr\u00e4den kvar based on 500 letters written to a young boy from his family in Vienna after he had fled to Sweden in 1939 as a refugee from the Nazis. The book received a lot of attention as it revealed new information about IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad that he had been placed under surveillance by the security police. In 1943 the police created a dossier on him under the heading \"Nazi\". The book also revealed that in an interview \u00c5sbrink made with Kamprad in 2010 he said that he had been loyal to the Swedish fascist leader Per Engdahl. \u00c5sbrink won the August prize for best non-fiction in 2011 for Och i Wienerwald st\u00e5r tr\u00e4den kvar, the Danish-Swedish Cultural Foundations annual Culture Prize 2013 and in May 2014 she received the Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski Award in Warsaw. The book has been translated into German, Dutch, Polish, Danish, Norwegian, Slovakian and Estonian. In 2012 she debuted as a playwright with the play \"R\u00c4LS\", based on the authentic minutes from a meeting convened by Hermann G\u00f6ring in 1938, and interviews with child refugees from Nazi Germany. This was followed by the plays Pojken och Det Sjungande Tr\u00e4det and Dr Alzheimer. On 13 July 2010, \u00c5sbrink was the host of the radio show Sommar i P1 on Swedish Public Radio, Sveriges Radio. In 2016, \u00c5sbrink published the non-fiction title 1947, which was nominated for the August Prize in that year.
