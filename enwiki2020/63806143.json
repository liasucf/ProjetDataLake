An accompanying martial arts-themed music video was premiered on March 4, 2020, two days before its worldwide release, following three additional remixes on May 8, 2020. Upon its release, \"Kick It\" received positive reviews from music critics for its \"darkness\" and \"anthemic\" return in contrast to their previous single releases which contributes further to their musical diversity. The song also attained commercial success in South Korea, becoming their first top-thirty entry on Gaon Digital Chart, and by far their longest charting performance on the chart. The song was also the unit's first top-ten and to date, their longest chart performance on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100, peaking at number nine for one week. It also entered at number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, becoming their eighth top five entry on the chart, while becoming the unit's second entry on the New Zealand Hot Singles chart as a lead artist, peaking at number thirty-eight. The group went on to promote the song on several South Korea television music programs, and later again on May 17 as part of their online concert via Beyond Live, titled Beyond the Origin. == Background and release == After wrapping up promotion activities in the United States by the end of November 2019, SM Entertainment uploaded a music video for \"Dreams Come True\", along with the release announcement for Neo Zone on January 27, 2020. The label further confirmed that member Jungwoo would eventually join the group and participate in promotion activities following his initial hiatus from August 2019. On February 12, a \"timeline\" video for the album was announced on all social media platforms of the group, including a release schedule and the title of the lead single to be \"\uc601\uc6c5 / \u82f1\u96c4 (Kick It)\". Following the video previews of other album tracks, the music video teaser for \"Kick It\" was uploaded on the official SMTOWN channel on March 3, 2020. The song had its official music video premiere one day later, while being released digitally along with its parental album on March 6, 2020. == Composition == === Writing and development === \"Kick It\" was produced by American producer Dem Jointz, South Korean songwriter Deez, Ryan S. Jhun, Mayila Jones and Rodnae Bell, with Yoo Young- jin took part in the song's arrangement. The song marked the second time that Dem Jointz, Deez and Yoo Young-jin collaborated together with the boy group since \"Cherry Bomb\" in June 2017. During an interview with music critic Kim Young-dae in March 2020, songwriter and producer Deez said that the song was originally prepared to \"gird the loins\" for \"Cherry Bomb 2.0\", with the outcome being \"stronger\" than the 2017 single according to the producer. He further revealed that the production team had to \"revise and multiply\" the song for about a hundred times from end of December 2019 to early February 2020. While fellow producer Abernathy created the song's beat loop, Deez took part in the R&B; arrangement for the track, having constructed and composed the bridge and the dance break section with the idea of \"maintaining\" the \"harmonic vocal color\" and \"extensively energetic\" chord work and arrangement to bring out a \"trendy and old-school\" color to the song. The rap recording process for member Taeyong and Mark was mostly the two members doing their respective parts in one-take to their preferences, and proceeded to arrange all the qualified cuts later. === Music and lyrics === Musically, SM Entertainment describes the song as a \"powerful\" Hip-Hop dance record with heavy metal guitar riff and R&B; elements throughout the song{{Cite web|title=SM Entertainment|url=https://www.smentertainment.com/PressCenter/Details/4156, while Tamar Herman of Billboard saw the track as \"high-energy\" with industrial beats, throbbing bass, whistling synths and chanting shouts. The song is composed in the key of G major and set in common time at a moderate tempo of 167 beats per minute. Excerpts of the song; including the harmonization and the main riff were also incorporated for the group's instrumental prelude, which was initially unreleased during its parental album release on March 6, 2020. Lyrically, the song sings about how the members overcome their own \"fears and traumas.\" The group also refers themselves like Bruce Lee when on stage, through chantings like \"Bass kicks swingin' like Bruce Lee\", amongst other references like jeet kune and the movie Enter the Dragon. It was penned by lyricist Wutan, Rick Bridges and danke, the latter whom is part of the writing team lalala Studio. == Music video == Directed by South Korean director Oui Kim, the music video for \"Kick It\" possesses a martial arts-theme combined with the group's unique martial arts choreography and performance. Set in the Neo Oriental mood virtual space of \"Neo Zone\", the video expresses the story of repulsing trauma by itself, while seeing the members reborn as powerful \"heroes\", living up to the original Korean title meaning. The martial arts, action movie-influenced choreography was created by choreographer Koosung Jung, whom later revealed that member Taeyong also contributed some of the \"action scenes\" to the overall performance. Three other video versions are also available on the group's Youtube channel, starting with the visualiser version on March 8, the vertical version on March 16 and finally the performance-only video on March 19. == Promotion == Following the music video release, the group shared their first performance for \"Kick It\" as NCT 127 The Stage through their official channel on March 5.
