    "text": "Sleeper are an English rock band formed in London in 1992. The group had eight UK Top 40 hit singles and three UK Top 10 albums during the 1990s. Their music was also featured in the soundtrack of the pop cultural hit movie Trainspotting. The band split up in 1998, but reunited in 2017. ==History== ===First three albums (1992\u20131998)=== Jon Stewart met Louise Wener at Manchester University in 1987 in a political philosophy class. They played in a number of bands at university, including jazz outfit the Lime Street Blues Band, then after graduating in 1988, moved to London to seek gigs. Wener later wrote that \"we sounded not unlike the Sundays, but as time went on our music became increasingly influenced by US bands such as Hole, Nirvana and, most especially, the Pixies\". They advertised for new band members in Melody Maker (\"Bass player and drummer wanted. Influences The Pixies and The Partridge Family\") and recruited Diid Osman and Andy Maclure. Wener solicited interest from record label representatives by sending out a fake NME review, a move she called \"pure cheek and cut-and-paste fakery.\" At one point, the band called themselves Surrender Dorothy, after the smoke trail in the sky from the Wizard of Oz movie, but abandoned this idea after discovering that several other bands had done the same thing. They subsequently chose the name 'Sleeper' after the Woody Allen movie of the same name, and also because the word has a number of different meanings (a spy, an unexpected hit, etc.). After moving to Camden and receiving interest from record labels, Sleeper signed to Indolent Records, which was an \"indie label\" in marketing only, in 1993 and released three EPs and singles before their breakthrough single release, \"Inbetweener\", which notably featured UK TV personality Dale Winton in the promo video. Prior to the release of \"Inbetweener\" Sleeper had been the opening act for Blur on that band's tour to promote the Parklife album, and became closely associated with Britpop as a result. The band's debut album release Smart was certified gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was followed by the platinum-selling (over 300,000 copies) release The It Girl which yielded four singles and airplay chart hits \"What Do I Do Now?\", \"Nice Guy Eddie\", \"Sale of the Century\" and \"Statuesque\". Sleeper recorded a cover of the Blondie song \"Atomic\", which was used in the film Trainspotting, after Blondie refused to allow the use of the original version. \"Statuesque\" also features in the movie and its follow-up soundtrack volume. The band\u2019s third album, Pleased to Meet You, was released to relatively lacklustre sales (although still a UK Top 10 hit and certified silver) and a public change of mood by the end of Britpop and its association with Cool Britannia, and the band split after a final headline tour around the UK. ===Post-split (1999\u20132010)=== After Sleeper split, Wener and Maclure recorded material for a new project, aimed at a more mainstream market and featuring a guest appearance by George Michael. However, the project was never completed,Just for One Day: Adventures in Britpop. Random House. 31 July 2012. pages 306-307 and Wener went on to have a career as a novelist. Her fourth book for Hodder & Stoughton was published in 2008. Wener also features prominently as an interviewee in John Dower's feature film documentary on Britpop, Live Forever (2003). Stewart moved to Los Angeles, California, where he played with West Coast band UFO Bro and contributed as a session guitarist to k.d. lang's album Invincible Summer (2000) and Mel C's album Reason. After returning to the UK he became Course Leader of the BA (Hons) Music Business and a lecturer in popular culture and music history at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute in Brighton, where his former students include The Kooks, James Bay, Black Honey (band), The Xcerts, Kate Walsh and Luke Sital-Singh, among others. Stewart also wrote a monthly column for Guitarist magazine from 2002 to 2010, and gained a PhD Music from the University of Southampton in 2018. In 2019 he joined The Wedding Present as guitarist during their thirtieth anniversary Bizarro UK and EU tour. Osman subsequently went on to become a session player with Parlophone records band Dubstar and later became an artist manager,with bands including Infectious Music outfit My Vitriol and Atlantic Records band The Glitterati, and helped writer-producer Justin Parker sign to Sony Music publishing. Maclure later ran a \"Punk Rock Karaoke\" enterprise with DJ Steve Lamacq. A greatest hits compilation, with a tracklisting selected by and artwork designed by the band themselves, was released on Sony/BMG in 2007. Their first two albums were reissued as deluxe versions on 29 November 2010, with second discs of B-sides and live tracks. By 2014, Wener and MacLure had formed another band, Huge Advance, although they only played in and around their residential suburb of Crouch End. === Reunion (2017\u2013present) === Sleeper reformed in 2017 to play in four British cities in July and August, as part of the Star Shaped Festival, alongside other Britpop acts including Space, Dodgy and The Bluetones. These dates saw Wener, Maclure and Stewart joined on bass by new member Kieron Pepper, previously known as live drummer for The Prodigy from 1997 to 2007, and were followed by an eleven-date headline tour of the UK in spring 2018. In the summer of 2018, Sleeper announced that they were recording a new album in collaboration with their old producer Stephen Street for release in early 2019 and that this would be accompanied by another headline UK tour. Lead single \"Look at You Now\" premiered on BBC Radio 6 Music on 4 December 2018, while presenter Steve Lamacq announced the title of the new album was The Modern Age. ==Image== Frontwoman Louise Wener, along with Elastica's Justine Frischmann, was one of Britpop's biggest female stars, and became one of its enduring sex symbols, placing highly in Melody Maker and NME \"Sexiest Woman\" polls two years running. Wener enjoyed significant media coverage, including an NME front cover and a slot as guest presenter of Top of the Pops, and multiple appearances on TFI Friday. Billboard described how Wener's \"forthright opinions on female sexuality, censorship, and other issues, have been manna for feature editors.\" The band was the inspiration for the phrase \"Sleeperbloke\", referring to the disparity between the glamorous singer Wener and the other frequently ignored members of the band (who tended to be far more anonymous and stood at the back). This pejorative term was used by music press journalists and musicians, to refer to any person of limited standing within a band or an especially drab and unremarkable individual. The \"Sleeperblokes\" themselves were reported to be highly amused by the phrase, and even produced an ironic \"Sleeperbloke\" T-shirt to go with Wener's \"Another Female Fronted Band\" T-shirt, both of which sold well. ==Members== Current * Louise Wener \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar (1993\u20131998, 2017\u2013present) * Jon Stewart \u2013 lead guitar (1993\u20131998, 2017\u2013present) * Andy Maclure \u2013 drums (1993\u20131998, 2017\u2013present) * Kieron Pepper \u2013 bass guitar (2017\u2013present) Past * Diid Osman \u2013 bass guitar (1993\u20131997) * Chris Giammalvo \u2013 bass guitar (1997) * Dan Kaufmann \u2013 bass guitar (1997\u20131998) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Certifications (sales threshold) |- !width=\"35\"|UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| Smart | *Released: 13 February 1995 *Label: Indolent (SLEEP 007) *Format: CD, CS, DL, LP | 5 | * UK: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| The It Girl | *Released: 6 May 1996 *Label: Indolent (74321 36477) *Format: CD, CS, DL, LP | 5 | * UK: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| Pleased to Meet You | *Released: 13 October 1997 *Label: Indolent (SLEEP 016) *Format: CD, CS, DL, LP | 7 | * UK: Silver |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Modern Age | *Released: 22 March 2019 *Label: Gorsky *Format: CD, DL, LP, CS | 18 | |} ===Compilation albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of compilation albums ! rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greatest Hits | * Released: 2007 * Label: Sony BMG (88697106042) * Format: CD, DL |- ! scope=\"row\"| Inbetweener \u2013 The Best of Sleeper | * Released: 19 February 2016 * Label: Master Club Deluxe (MCDLX216) * Format: CD, DL |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! colspan=\"1\"|Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! width=\"35\"|UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| Alice EP | 1993 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 | rowspan=\"6\"|Smart |- ! scope=\"row\"| Bucket & Spade | 1994 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Swallow\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 1994 |align=\"center\"| 76 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Delicious\" |align=\"center\"| 75 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Inbetweener\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 1995 |align=\"center\"| 16 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Vegas\" |align=\"center\"| 33 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"What Do I Do Now?\" |align=\"center\"| 14 | rowspan=\"4\"|The It Girl |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sale of the Century\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 1996 |align=\"center\"| 10 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Nice Guy Eddie\" |align=\"center\"| 10 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Statuesque\" |align=\"center\"| 17 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"She's a Good Girl\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 1997 |align=\"center\"| 28 | rowspan=\"2\"|Pleased to Meet You |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Romeo Me\" |align=\"center\"| 39 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Look at You Now\" | 2018 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 | rowspan=\"3\"|The Modern Age |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"The Sun Also Rises\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"More Than I Do\" |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |} ===Other appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center; width:33px;\"|Year ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Song ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Release |- | style=\"text- align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"|1995 |\"Pyrotechnician (I Think I Love You)\" (demo) | Sharks Patrol These Waters: The Best of Volume, Pt.
