    "text": "The Miramichi Bridge is a bridge crossing the Miramichi River at Newcastle, New Brunswick, Canada. It opened to traffic in 1995 as part of the Route 117 Chatham bypass project. It is located approximately upstream from the older Morrissy Bridge, which closed to all traffic in September 2008. The bridge is a continuous steel girder design carrying two lanes of highway traffic from Chatham Head on the south bank to Newcastle on the north bank. One construction worker was killed during the project. == External links == Category:Road bridges in New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Miramichi, New Brunswick Category:Transport in Miramichi, New Brunswick ",
