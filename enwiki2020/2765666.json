Cassab began painting as a twelve year old and began studying at the Academy of Art in Prague in 1938 but was forced to flee the German occupation in 1939. Cassab worked in a factory under an assumed name and put her artistic skills to use after hours forging papers and passports. Her husband, Jancsi Kampfner, was put in a forced labour camp by the Nazis in World War II, and returned to Hungary in 1944. Cassab, her husband and two sons emigrated to Australia in 1951 and settled in Sydney. Cassab became an Australian citizen in 1957. ==Career == Cassab was the first woman to win the Archibald Prize twice: * 1960 for a portrait of Stan RapotecArchibald Prize Winner for 1960, Art Gallery of NSW * 1967 for a portrait of Margo Lewers.Archibald Prize Winner for 1967, Art Gallery of NSW She held more than fifty solo exhibitions in Australia, as well as others in Paris and London.
