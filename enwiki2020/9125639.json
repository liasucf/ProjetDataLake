    "text": "In 356, after leaving Cologne, Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate wintered in Senonae (possibly modern Sens) in Gaul. Following desertions from his German federated troops, hostile Germanic warbands learned that his force was under- strength and moved to attack the town. However, lacking advanced siegecraft, they were not able to break into the town and could only prevent Julian from venturing outside the walls. After a month, they withdrew.Goldsworthy, Adrian. In the Name of Rome, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2003, p. 345 > Finally, after a month the savages withdrew crestfallen, muttering that they > had been silly and foolish to have contemplated the blockade of the city. > But \u2014 a thing to be regarded as a shameful situation \u2014 while Caesar was in > jeopardy, Marcellus, master of the horse, although he was stationed in > neighbouring posts, postponed sending him reinforcements; whereas even if > the city alone was endangered, to say nothing of the prince's presence > there, it ought to have been saved from the hardships of blockade by the > intervention of a large force. ==References== Senonae Senonae Category:356 Senonae Category:350s in the Roman Empire Category:4th century in Roman Gaul Category:Julian (emperor) ",
