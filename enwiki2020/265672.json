    "text": "The laughing gull (Leucophaeus atricilla) is a medium-sized gull of North and South America. Named for its laugh-like call, it is an opportunistic omnivore and scavenger. It breeds in large colonies mostly along the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. The two subspecies are: L. a. megalopterus \u2013 which can be seen from southeast Canada down to Central America, and L. a. atricilla which appears from the West Indies to the Venezuelan islands. The laughing gull was long placed in the genus Larus until its present placement in Leucophaeus, which follows the American Ornithologists' Union. ==Name== The genus name Leucophaeus is from Ancient Greek leukos, \"white\", and phaios, \"dusky\". The specific atricilla is from Latin ater, \"black\", and cilla, \"tail\". Linnaeus appears to have misread his note atricapilla (black-haired), which would have been much more appropriate for this black-headed, but white-tailed, bird. ==Range== It breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Northernmost populations migrate farther south in winter, and this species occurs as a rare vagrant to western Europe. The laughing gull's English name is derived from its raucous kee-agh call, which sounds like a high-pitched laugh \"ha... ha... ha...\". Laughing gulls breed in coastal marshes and ponds in large colonies. The large nest, made largely from grasses, is constructed on the ground. The three or four greenish eggs are incubated for about three weeks. ==Description== This species is easy to identify. It is long with a wingspan and a weight range of 203\u2013371g (7.2-13.1 oz). The summer adult's body is white apart from the dark grey back and wings and black head. Its wings are much darker grey than all other gulls of similar size except the smaller Franklin's gull, and they have black tips without the white crescent shown by Franklin's. The beak is long and red. The black hood is mostly lost in winter. Laughing gulls take three years to reach adult plumage. Immature birds are always darker than most similar-sized gulls other than Franklin's. First-year birds are greyer below and have paler heads than first-year Franklin's, and second-years can be distinguished by the wing pattern and structure. ==Subspecies== The two subspecies are: *L. a. megalopterus \u2013 (Bruch, 1855): coastal southeast Canada, eastern & southern United States, Mexico & Central America *L. a. atricilla \u2013 (Linnaeus, 1758): West Indies to Venezuelan islands Like most other members of the genus Leucophaeus, the laughing gull was long placed in the genus Larus. The present placement in Leucophaeus follows the American Ornithologists' Union. ==Gallery== Image:Laughing Gull - mating plumage.jpg|Mating plumage includes black head and red bill Image:Larus atricilla1.jpg|Definitive alternate plumage Image:Flying Laughing Gull.jpg|Adult in mid-May (definitive alternate plumage) Image:Laughing- gull.jpg|Laughing gull, alternate plumage, North Carolina, US, 2016 Image:Laughing Gulls on sand.jpg|Adult in winter (definitive basic plumage) Image:Laughing Gull juvenile.jpg|Juvenile Image:Laughing gull St Thomas.JPG|Adult at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands (definitive alternate plumage) Image:Laughing gull Porthmadog.jpg|Vagrant in definitive basic plumage in the UK in late 2005 Image:Caneel Bay Seagulls By Caneel Beach 15.jpg|Preparing to land on beach Image:Guanaguanre (Larus atricilla) de los Roques Venezuela 000.jpg|Los Roques Venezuela File:Larus atricilla MWNH 0343.JPG|Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Image:Trim.F419E503-74D1-4BE4-90FA-31A0C888E761.webm|Laughing Gulls following a shrimp boat off the coast of Jacksonville Florida ==References== ==External links== * Laughing Gull - Larus atricilla - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter * Laughing Gull Species Account - Cornell Lab of Ornithology * Field Guide on Flickr * Laughing Gull Bird Sound at Florida Museum of Natural History * * * laughing gull Category:Native birds of the Northeastern United States Category:Native birds of the Eastern United States Category:Native birds of the Southeastern United States Category:Birds of Central America Category:Birds of the Caribbean Category:Birds of the Dominican Republic Category:Birds of Venezuela laughing gull laughing gull ",
