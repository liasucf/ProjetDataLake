    "text": "Major Dad is an American sitcom television series created by Richard C. Okie and John G. Stephens, developed by Earl Pomerantz, that originally ran from September 17, 1989, to May 17, 1993 on CBS, starring Gerald McRaney as Major John D. MacGillis and Shanna Reed as his wife Polly. The cast also includes Beverly Archer, Matt Mulhern, Jon Cypher, Marisa Ryan, Nicole Dubuc, and Chelsea Hertford. ==Synopsis== The first season is set at the fictional Camp Singleton (meant to represent Camp Pendleton), where hard-charging United States Marine Corps Major John D. \"Mac\" MacGillis is commander of the infantry training school's acquisition division. MacGillis's life is changed when he falls in love with a liberal journalist, Polly Cooper. The show follows Mac in his work life, where he deals with Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (Matt Mulhern), Sgt. Byron James (Marlon Archey), and Merilee Gunderson (Whitney Kershaw), as well as his home life, as he learns to live with Polly's three daughters, Elizabeth, Robin, and Casey. At the beginning of the second season, the MacGillis family moves to Camp Hollister (based on Marine Corps Base Quantico), where Mac must adapt to the role of staff secretary (or, \"staff weenie\") and the crazy antics of Commanding (Brigadier) General Marcus C. Craig, Aide-de-Camp 1st Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (who transferred with Major MacGillis from Camp Singleton), and Gunnery Sgt. Alva \"Gunny\" Bricker, the General's secretary, a no-nonsense Marine, who despite her brusque nature and unprepossessing physical appearance, is the target of many enthusiastic (and unseen) suitors. Character development increased during the second season, such as the revelation that MacGillis is a former member of the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon. ==Cast== ==Episode guide== ==Awards and nominations== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Year ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Award ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Result ! style=\"background- color: #BCBCBC\"|Category ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\"|Recipient |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA;\" | 1992 || BMI Film & TV Award || Won || BMI TV Music Award || Steve Dorff |- | 1992 || Emmy Award || Nominated || Outstanding Individual Achievement in Main Title Theme Music || Steve Dorff |- | rowspan=2|1990 || rowspan=8|Young Artist Awards || Nominated || Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series || Chelsea Hertford |-style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA;\" | Won || Best New Television Series || - |- | rowspan=4|1991 || rowspan=4|Nominated || Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series || Marisa Ryan |- | Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series || Chelsea Hertford |- | Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series || Nicole Dubuc |- | Best Young Actor Supporting or Re- Occurring Role for a TV Series || Chance Michael Corbitt |- | 1992 || Nominated || Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series || Marisa Ryan |- | 1993 || Nominated || Outstanding Actress Under Ten in a Television Series || Chelsea Hertford |} ==References== ==External links== * * * *Major Dad introduction (video clip) Category:1989 American television series debuts Category:1993 American television series endings Category:1980s American sitcoms Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:CBS original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Military comedy television series Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in California Category:Television shows set in Virginia Category:Television shows about the United States Marine Corps Category:Television series about families ",
