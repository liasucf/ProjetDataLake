Between 2009 to 2012, Uttaran was one of the top ranking show of Indian Television and one of number one TRP rated show in Colors TV (along with Balika Vadhu). ==Synopsis== Uttaran follows two friends from different socio-economic backgrounds - Ichha Bharti (Sparsh Khanchandani / Tina Datta), a maid-servant's daughter, and Tapasya Thakur (Ishita Panchal / Rashami Desai), the child of a wealthy landlord. Ichha is kind, caring and helpful, while Tapasya is spoilt, selfish and jealous. ==Plot== The story set in Mumbai starts with Tapasya Thakur, a young 8 year-old girl becomes friends with her family maid Damini's same aged daughter Ichha Bharti, and they share a sister-like bond. Tapasya's grandaunt Sumitra influences her to see Ichha differently. Tapasya hits jealousy when her parents Divya and Jogi care for Ichha as their own child, unaware that Jogi was responsible for Ichha's father Rajendra's death. ===13-16 years later=== Ichha and Tapasya grow up. Tapasya rejects her rich prospective simpleton groom Veer Singh Bundela. He falls in love with Ichha who now feels the same for him, and their wedding is fixed. Tapasya realizes her feelings for Veer and attempts suicide. So on Ichha marries Veer's brother Vansh, a drug addict, as Tapasya marries Veer. Tapasya tries to get rid of Ichha whose past with Veer is found out by Vansh. Tapasya manipulates and misleads Vansh into thinking he is responsible for Ichha's suffering. As a result, he kills himself. Veer and Vansh's mother Gunvanti blames Ichha for Vansh's death. Soon Tapasya's true nature is exposed by Veer. He secretly marries Ichha in Vrindavan. After some friction, the family accepts them. Tapasya meets businessman Raghuvendra Rathore and gets pregnant with his child. Raghuvendra leaves Tapasya without knowing her pregnancy. She returns to Veer saying that she is pregnant with his child. Veer doesn't trust her. Ichha figures that Tapasya isn't carrying Veer's child. Everyone refuse to believe her. Veer comes to know that the child is Raghuvendra's. Tapasya is banished from Bundela Mansion and delivers a daughter whom she unintentionally abandons. Veer and Ichha raise Tapasya's daughter (not knowing it\u2019s Tapasya\u2019s) named Mukta. Ichha delivers a baby boy, Sumitra and Pushkar steal the baby. They bribe the nurse to tell Ichha and her family that the baby was stillborn. Sumitra instructs Pushkar to dump Ichha's baby at a filthy place so that he may live a poor life. Mr Rathor bumps in to Pushkar and the baby and he takes the baby from him. Tapasya and Rathore adopt the baby and name him Yuvraj. Ichha is pregnant again. She saves Veer from Avinash, a cruel who vows revenge on him for winning his property. He attacks Veer who loses his memory. Ichha kills Avinash and is jailed for 18 years. Ichha gives birth to a baby girl in prison, Ichha tells Damini to raise the baby and they name her Meethi. ===18 years later=== Yuvraj, Meethi and Mukta are grown up. Meethi and Mukta are best friends just like their mothers. Ichha returns but the arrogant, selfish and insolent Yuvraj hates her. Meethi also grew up presuming Ichha dead. Avinash's nephew, Kanha who was raised by Damini is a successful CEO and happily married to Surbhi. Meethi and Yuvraj were brought up by Gunvanti and Damini individually, as Gunvanti brainwashed Yuvraj against Ichha. Sumitra reveals to Meethi that Ichha is alive, but lies that she ruined Tapasya's life since childhood. Initially, Meethi is in denial. But during a college field trip, she runs into a saint who not only confirms that Ichha is alive, but was also in prison for murder, Meethi then develops an negative opinion towards Ichha, believing her to be a murderer. Meethi tries to find out the truth regarding Ichha's incarceration. Despite knowing what the saint told her about Ichha is true, she still wants to hear it from Kanha. He reveals that Ichha was in prison for murder, but fails to mention that she killed Avinash to save Veer. Meethi confronts Ichha and cruelly rejects her believing her to be a murderer. Damini and Kanha try to convince Meethi to forgive Ichha. They state the reason behind this, but Meethi refuses to believe this as she saw Kanha destroying documents regarding Ichha being incarcerated for murder. Damini and Kanha try to convince Meethi to forgive Ichha, who becomes extremely hostile towards them every single time. Damini's attempt to repair Ichha and Meethi's relationship completely backfire, as Meethi further distances herself from Ichha and grows to hate her even more. Mukta and Meethi fall in love with their college friend, Aman Verma who eventually chooses Mukta, but they never get together as she breaks up with him; due to insecurities. Meethi comforts a distraught Aman. Sumitra brainwashes Mukta, who starts getting close to Yuvraj. Mukta takes Meethi to a party, spikes her drink and calls the cops stating that it is a rave party. In an intoxicated state, Meethi confesses her feelings for Aman and the cops arrest them. Yuvraj later, tries to rape Mukta but Ichha saves her. Mukta realises that she misunderstood Ichha and Meethi. She decides to help Ichha reunite with Veer. Shortly after Yuvraj is arrested, Gunvanti reveals Ichcha is his mother. His hatred further intensifies as Ichha testifies against him in court leading him to be incarcerated for 5 years. Veer having not regained his memory lives with Gunvanti and his new wife Amla. Tapasya who has genuinely reformed after living in U.S. for the last 18 years, restores his memory. Meethi is encouraged by Ichha's former orphan student Vishnu Kashyap and accepts her. Eventually, Veer and Ichha are reunited. Meethi marries Vishnu on Ichha's arrangement. He is revealed to be Avinash's son, Akash Chatterjee, who has married her to take revenge. Later, Mukta discovers Akash's identity (but she is unaware of his agenda) and tries to locate the real Vishnu Kashyap (Ajay Chaudhary) a humble blue-collar worker, who works for an NGO, in order to expose Akash, she also informs her father, Raghuvendra of this, regarding Akash's identity. Just as Mukta was about to meet the real Vishnu, Akash orders his goons to kidnap and kill Mukta, as she was getting close to exposing HIM. Fortunately, she is saved by Raghuvendra. At Akash and Meethi's wedding, Mukta tries to expose his identity, but unfortunately, Ichcha, Veer, Jogi, Divya and Tapasya (except for Sumitra) refused to believe her. Subconsciously they know she isn't lying, but consciously they refuse to accept the truth. Raghuvendra is completely enraged and disgusted by the fact that they did not believe Mukta, mainly at Jogi and Divya, who have raised Mukta since childhood. As he refuses to allow his daughter stay with people who do not trust and respect her, he cruelly states to everyone that \"when the truth is revealed\" (regarding Akash's identity) \"they will remember this night and bow their heads down in shame\". Jogi and Veer tried to convince Raghuvendra to send Mukta back to the Thakur mansion, and try to justify their reasons for not believing him and Mukta regarding Akash, but Raghuvendra not only (outright) refuses to send his daughter back to the Thakur mansion, but he also cruelly put them both in their place, as he coldly state \"that if he was in their positions, he would have believed Mukta, regardless whether or not there was any physical evidence\" as well as coldly pointing out that they do not know the meaning of the word trust and respect when it comes to relationships, otherwise they would have believed Mukta regarding Akash's identity; as Jogi and Veer are both hurt by what he says. Meanwhile, Ichha and Tapasya risk their life to save Mukta from Veer's uncle Tej who shoots Tapasya. Ichha is fatally hit by a truck and donates her heart to Tapasya before dying. Tapasya now takes care of Meethi and considers her as a daughter just like Mukta. Sometime after Ichha's death, Raghuvendra finally gets the evidence to expose Akash's identity (as he has been gathering the said evidence, ever since Mukta had informed him; regarding Akash's identity) he informs Veer, Jogi, Divya and Tapasya regarding the night of the wedding, when he and Mukta tried to warn everyone about Akash, just as Raghuvendra predicted, everyone (metaphorically) bow their heads down in shame for not believing Mukta, when she tried to warn them the first time. Surbhi is revealed to be Akash's maternal cousin. His mother, Ekadashi orders him to kill Meethi but he falls in love with her. Meethi who fell for Akash too leaves the house. Tapasya throws Surbhi out of the Thakur house. Pregnant, Surbhi repents for her actions. During childbirth, she dies. Kanha forgives her and promises to raise their son Ajitesh as good and honest. As Vishnu and Mukta love each other, they get married and she later gives birth to Manav. Meethi and Akash reunite. She is accepted by his family. Yuvraj, having undergone a plastic surgery, returns as Mukta's new boss for revenge. He eventually kidnaps and threatens to kill her. While saving Mukta, a pregnant Meethi loses her child and disowns Yuvraj for good; after finally seeing brother as the monster he truly is. Ekadashi banishes her. Meethi leaves for Srinagar. Caught up in a terrorist attack by a man named Asgar, Meethi slips into a river and is transported by the current across the border to Gilgit in Pakistan. There she is rescued by Asgar's brother, Aashfaq, a simple farmer who falls in love with her at first sight. Meethi gets back to India with Aashfaq's help. He bids her a tearful farewell. Akash and Meethi reconcile. She adopts Akash and his first girlfriend, Nandini's illegitimate daughter, Rani. Nandini saves Akash from his old enemy and murders him. She is imprisoned. Meethi and Akash adopt the enemy's daughter, Tamanna, who is hated by Rani. Sumitra reforms. Afraid that Tapasya and Ichha's story might repeat, she and Damini, eventually manage to convince Mukta and Meethi to reconcile. In the end, Sumitra and Damini, reflect the everlasting friendship of Ichha and Tapasya. ==Cast== ===Main Cast=== * Sparsh Khanchandani as Young Ichha (2008\u201309) * Ishita Panchal as Young Tapasya (2008\u201309) * Rashami Desai as Tapasya Rathore: Divya and Jogi's daughter;
