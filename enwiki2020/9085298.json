McClatchy Senior High School, the city's second high school. Construction financing came from local sources as well as the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a New Deal economic stimulus program instituted by President Franklin Roosevelt. The school's design was done by local architectural firm of Starks and Flanders, whose existing portfolio included downtown landmarks such as the Elks Temple, the U.S. Post Office, and the Courthouse. On May 20, 1937, local dignitaries and students from the city's junior high schools gathered to watch the laying of the school's cornerstone bearing the name of C.K. McClatchy, the late editor and owner of The Sacramento Bee. On September 19, 1937, the school was officially dedicated. Sitting on , the school included a shooting range, and a band room complete with soundproof practice rooms as well as dressing and music rooms near the auditorium. A nurse's suite with bathrooms and a sun porch and a quartered garden with central fountain in the Moorish style were also features of the new campus. The school has served students in the Sacramento area for over 70 years. Many local, state, national, and international figures have graduated from CKM. Current enrollment is around 2,400 students. In 2002, the school was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places. McClatchy's newspaper, The Prospector, has been serving students for 75 years. ==Statistics== ===Demographics=== 2016-17 {| class=\"wikitable\" !White !African American !Asian !American Indian !Latino !Two or More Races |- |24.4% |8.6% |15.8% |0.8% |41.6% |5.9% |} ===Standardized Testing=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |SAT Scores for 2015-16 |- | |Reading Average |Math Average |Writing Average |- |McClatchy High |524 |521 |500 |- |School District |465 |474 |452 |- |Statewide |484 |494 |477 |} ==Academics== In 2005, C.K.
