    "text": "Heaven and EarthJames Clover was born in Iowa in 1938. An internationally known sculptor and consummate academician, he taught drawing and sculpture for 30 years. His work is almost exclusively steel or bronze constructions with various welding, paint, and burnishing treatments. The whimsical forms are often a riotous chaos of white geometric shapes that climb into the air. Several U.S. cities boast sculpture parks which host the work of both Clover and, like Alexander Calder, Clover's creations are no strangers to College campuses. In 1998, a major Clover installation was completed by Emory University in Atlanta. == Monumental Sculptures and Public Works == ===United States=== ====Georgia==== * The Blade, 1972, Nancy Guinn Memorial Library, Conyers * Untitled, 1973, Frankie Allen Park, Atlanta * Untitled, 1967, West End Performing Art Center, Atlanta * The Wave, 1974, Emory University, Atlanta ====Michigan==== The River's Edge * Dancing Fish, 1993, Quarton Lake waterfall, Birmingham * Dragon, Roger Miller, Grand Rapids * Heaven and Earth, 1990, Grand Valley State University Campus, Allendale Charter Township * The Lake's Edge, 1990, Grand Haven * Looking to the Future, 1987, Grand Valley State University Campus, Allendale Charter Township * The Marsh, 1986, Edgewater Plaza, St. Joseph * The River's Edge, 1989, Grand Valley State Campus-Downtown, Grand Rapids * Sculpture with Stars, 1992, Federal Square Park, Muskegon * Study (Fish), 1991, Grand Valley State University Campus, Allendale Charter Township * Untitled, 1987, Grand Valley State University Campus, Allendale Charter Township ====Mississippi==== * Jackson Sculpture, 1971, Mississippi Museum of Art, Jackson ====Ohio==== * Wind Wave, 1977, Marion Technical College, Marion, Ohio == References == Smithsonian Research Information System - James Clover Category:American sculptors Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Allendale, Michigan ",
