    "text": "The Talampaya Formation is an Early Triassic (Olenekian) geologic formation in the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin of La Rioja Province in northwestern Argentina. The pink to red sandstones of the formation represent the oldest sedimentary unit in the basin, overlying basement rock and were deposited in a high-energy braided river environment. Ichnofossils, probably left by an archosaur chirotherian, were found in the formation. The formation crops out in the Talampaya National Park, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. == Description == The formation was first defined by Romer and Jensen in 1966,Caselli, 1998, p.22 based on a type section exposed in the Talampaya River canyon.Caselli, 1998, p.23 The Talampaya Formation belongs to the Paganzo Group.Leonardi, 1994, p.19 The formation represents the oldest sedimentary unit in the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin in the Talampaya National Park of La Rioja Province, overlying Paleozoic basement, formed by the Tuminico Formation.Aceituno Cieri et al., 2015, p.59 The Talampaya Formation is overlain by the arid fluvial sandstones and conglomerates of the Tarjados Formation, eroding the Talampaya Formation.Balabusic et al., 2001, p.26 The formation, reaching a maximum thickness of with a general thickness of approximately ,Aceituno Cieri et al., 2015, p.60Monetta et al., 2000, p.648 comprises pink to reddish sandstones,Talampaya Formation deposited in a fluvial environment, dominated by high-energy braided rivers producing sheet floods.Caselli, 1998, p.147Balabusic et al., 2001, p.25 The sediments were deposited under uniform climatic conditions with temperate to warm temperatures and high humidity.Balabusic et al., 2001, p.28 Other facies recognized in the formation are alluvial fan deposits with thin tuffaceous beds and conglomerates, covered by a section of basaltis and other volcanic agglomerates and eolian sandstones.Caselli, 1998, p.24 Tetrapod ichnofossils, probably belonging to a chirotherian (and possibly an archosaur), were discovered in the formation southeast of Pagancillo by Argentina paleontologist Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte in 1964. == See also == * Sanga do Cabral Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of the Paran\u00e1 Basin in southeastern Brazil * Katberg Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of the Karoo Basin in South Africa * Fremouw Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of Antarctica == References == === Bibliography === * * * * * == Further reading == * Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Triassic System of South America Category:Triassic Argentina Category:Olenekian Stage Category:Sandstone formations Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Aeolian deposits Category:Alluvial deposits Category:Fluvial deposits Category:Ichnofossiliferous formations Category:Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin Category:Fossiliferous stratigraphic units of South America Category:Paleontology in Argentina Category:Geology of La Rioja Province, Argentina ",
