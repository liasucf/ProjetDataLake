She has 10 CDs and 2 DVDs recorded, in one of the most solid careers in Catholic music. ==Biography== Her parents \u00e9 Jos\u00e9 de Arimat\u00e9ia and Dona Auxiliadora Maria, and Adriana says that the family had the habit of getting together to listen to music. Adriana's story of singing began at the age of 7, playing at the masses of the Bom Jesus chapel in her hometown of Cruzeiro (SP). She recalls that at that time there was no music at Mass. Mother and daughter played at the celebrations until the guitar teacher set up a children's choir, which Adriana attended for several years. As a teenager, he joined the youth group and became part of the band that animated the meetings. In 1982, Arydes began participating in the Rebanh\u00f5es, in Cruzeiro, organized by Father Jonas Abib and the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Community. 12 years later, Arydes would start his career in Catholic music. In 1994, she became part of the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Band, with which she animated the first camps, masses and Thursdays of worship of Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova. At that time, for the first time she entered a studio professionally, to record the LP \"Deus H\u00e1\", the first work of the band Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova. During this period, he also recorded backing vocals for Codimuc record albums. In 1999, she was invited to release her first solo CD by Codimuc. \"Reencontro\" opened the way for her solo career and hit the big hits \"Morte de Cruz\" and \"Abra\u00e7o de Pai.\" In 2001 she released her second work, also by Codimuc. \"Qual \u00e9 a Chave\" has leveraged the singer's career with the classic, \"A Chave do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o\", besides the super hits \"Chamado\", \"Quem Perder Sua Vida a Encontrar\u00e1\", \"Amor que n\u00e3o se cansa\", \"Se compreendesses dom de Deus\", \"Doce Jesus\", \"Pacto de Esperan\u00e7a\", \"Colo de M\u00e3e\", \"Pra te louvar\" and \"Ponto de Partida\". In 2003, Adriana left Codimuc and released her first album by Paulinas-Comep. In addition to the theme track, \"Lindo C\u00e9u\" also featured some of the hits that are still in the public memory to this day. Among them, \"Nova Un\u00e7\u00e3o\", \"Gl\u00f3ria e Majestade\", \"Nada \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel para ti\" and the beautiful \"Coroa\u00e7\u00e3o de Nossa Senhora\". In 2005, she launched \"Mais Feliz\". Her fourth album featured the tracks \"Humano Amor de Deus\", \"Consolo\", \"Nossa Miss\u00e3o\" and \"Nova Jerusal\u00e9m\", in addition to the re-recording of the classic \"Olhos no Espelho\" and the Italian version \"Lindo Cielo\". Her first DVD came in 2007. Bringing together the big hits of her career, \"Adriana Live\" brought two unreleased songs: \"Reunidos Aqui\" and \"Eternamente Grata\". The following year, the album won DVD and Gold Disc, surpassing 25,000 DVDs and 25,000 CDs sold. \"Jardim Secreto\", the singer's sixth work, came in 2009, featuring the hits \"Milagre\", \"Tocar em tuas vestes\", \"Eu sou um Jardim\" and \"Teu amor \u00e9 maior\".

Among them, \"Te farei vencer\", \"O Segredo\", \"S\u00f3 \u00e9 feliz quem ama\", \"Jesus, meu amigo\" and \"Tu \u00e9s Santo\".

A project specially produced to share the unique moment Adriana was living.
