However, his demon, who is a Brahma Rakshas, will not be a copy of its ancient idol in order to avoid hurting any religious sentiments. Due to this, Vikram Bhatt came up with his own imaginative take on the creature by using special effects in this film. In the film the Brahmarakshasha is depicted as a 10-feet tall animal like creature, which has a swishing tail, carnivorous teeth and nails. It is in the same league as the Yeti.
