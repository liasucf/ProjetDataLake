Carsten Cumbrowski, writing for Search Engine Journal, said of the book that, \"One of the unique aspects of the book is \u2026 how it is designed. It is geared towards the visual folks like myself and uses a tremendous amount of pictures to show things instead of just using words to explain. Virtually every page has a screenshot or illustration and is an integrated part of the book, beyond the simple use as decoration or reinforcement of the written text.\" ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Living people Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:Villanova University alumni Category:Albany Law School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
