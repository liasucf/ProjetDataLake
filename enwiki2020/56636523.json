    "text": "The Ukiyo-e Ruik\u014d (, \"Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e\") is a Japanese collection of commentaries and biographies of ukiyo-e artists. It did not appear in print during the Edo period in which it was produced, but was circulated in handwritten copies subject with numerous additions and alterations. The writer \u014cta Nanpo produced the first version in 1790. More than 120 variants of the Ukiyo-e Ruik\u014d are known. An edition with updates by Sant\u014d Ky\u014dden, Sasaya Shishichi Kuninori, and Shikitei Sanba in 1802 is the earliest extant copy, produced under the title Ukiyo-e K\u014dsh\u014d. This version lists 37 artists and focuses mainly on ukiyo-e painters and major print designers. The Ukiyo-e Ruik\u014d ranks artists regarded for their paintings higher than those mainly associated with their print designs, and highlights artists training in painterly schools such as the Kan\u014d or painting traditions such as Yamato-e, suggesting the prestige painting held over printing. ==References== ===Works cited=== * * * Category:Edo-period works Category:Ukiyo-e ",
