It is now part of the municipality of Bregaglia. ==Geography== The Hotel Bregaglia on the mountainside The municipality is located near the Swiss\u2013Italian border south of the river Mera in the Val Bregaglia (known as Bergell in German). It is located in the Bergell sub- district of the Maloja district. The valley floor is so deep that parts of the village do not receive any sunlight in winter. The Val Bondasca leads up from Bondo to Piz Badile and Piz Cengalo, two peaks of the Bregaglia Range.Kev Reynolds, Walking in the Alps (Milnthorpe: Cicerone Press, 2005), p. 248. The municipality of Bondo also includes the smaller village of Promontogno and, above that on a rocky outcrop, the ruins of the fort Castelmur. Additionally there are several abandoned settlements. Bondo has an area, , of . Of this area, 2.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 0.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (59.3%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). On 1 January 2010 the municipalities of Bondo, Castasegna, Soglio, Stampa, and Vicosoprano merged into the new municipality of Bregaglia.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 23 September 2009 ==History== View of Bondo from the north, c. 1870 Under the Carolingian dynasty Bondo belonged to the Ministerium Bergallia, which was a dependant of the early Bishops of Chur, though after 960 it was owned directly by the Bishop. The valley church of S. Maria at Castelmur is first mentioned in 988, while the village church for Bondo, S. Martino, was consecrated in 1250. During the High Middle Ages Bondo was part of several villages that were collectively known as di l\u00e0 dell'acqua ('across the water'), which were part of the district of Unterporta. In 1367 Bondo, together with the rest of Unterporta, joined the League of God's House (German: Gotteshausbund). In 1380 it was first mentioned under the name of Bondo. In German it was also known as Bundth while in Romansh it was known as Buond. In 1552 the Protestant Reformation reached the village. During the 16th century some of the population left Bondo to Italy, and later to eastern Europe (either as bakers or soldiers). This trend has continued into the 20th century, except many now leave for northern Graub\u00fcnden or the rest of Switzerland. During the Thirty Years' War the Three Leagues were rocked by the B\u00fcndner Wirren or Confusion of the Leagues, as the decentralized leagues fought each other over religion and politics. In 1621, during the Confusion, Spanish troops burned the entire town to the ground, destroying about 248 structures. The town was rebuilt along new central streets. ===2017 Landslide=== In August 2017 a series of debris flows from the adjacent mountain Piz Cengalo destroyed dozens of buildings and a bridge in Bondo, and resulted in the disappearance of eight hikers in Val Bondesca, up the valley from Bondo.

Maria in Castelmur was largely rebuilt in the 19th century, but still has its Romanesque campanile. S. Maria in Bondo also has a Romanesque bell tower. This church was restored in the 17th century but retains an important late 15th-century fresco cycle. The remains of the painter Varlin are interred in the nearby cemetery.Bondo at viabregaglia.com Further notable buildings include the Casa Molinari, the Palazzo Scartazzini of 1690, the Palazzo Scartazzini am Platz (formerly Cortini) of 1763 and the Palazzo Salis; this last was begun by Jerome de Salis-Soglio in 1765 for his wife Mary and completed by their son in 1774.
