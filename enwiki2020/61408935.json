She was the daughter of the actor and director Lewis Casson and the actress Sybil Thorndike. Casson was part of a theatrical family that included her brothers Christopher, John and a sister Ann.

Casson made her debut in the theatre at the age of six when she appeared as Belinda Cratchit in a 1921 production of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. She appeared alongside her mother as Astyanax in The Trojan Women in 1922 and was Warwick's page in Saint Joan in Paris in 1924. Three years later, Casson made the first of six successive appearances as Wendy Darling at the Christmas performance of Peter Pan in the Gaiety Theatre and returned there in 1928. That year, she also toured South Africa with her parents, playing in Medea, Jane Clegg, The Lie, and Saint Joan. In 1929, she appeared opposite Gerald du Maurier in J. M. Barrie's Dear Brutus, and made another appearances as Wendy Darling in Peter Pan at the St. James's Theatre from 1929 to 1931. Casson played the same character twice more in the same play at the Palladium Theatre between 1931 and 1933. She played the Second Witch in Macbeth in April 1932 at the Kingsway Theatre, and went on to portray more of William Shakespeare's characters, such as Juliet, Ophelia, Olivia in Twelfth Night, Nerissa in The Merchant of Venice and Bianca in The Taming of the Shrew for which her performances were praised for \"their sincerity and freshness.\" From 1936 to 1948, Casson was married to the actor William Devlin and the couple had a daughter.
