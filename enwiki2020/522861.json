    "text": "NCAA Division III independent schools are four-year institutions that compete in college athletics at the NCAA's Division III level, but do so independently of an established athletic conference. These institutions often compete as members of an intercollegiate athletic conference in some sports. The reason for independent status varies among institutions, but it is frequently because the school's primary athletic conference does not sponsor a particular sport. ==All-sport independents== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !Institution !Team !Location !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Football !Future Conference |- |Bob Jones University |Bruins |Greenville, South Carolina |1927 |Private |2,916 |No |TBA |- |Maranatha Baptist University |Sabercats |Watertown, Wisconsin |1968 |Private |1,169 |No | |- |Mississippi University for Women |Owls |Columbus, Mississippi |1884 |Public |2,479 |No | |- |Trinity Washington University \u2020 |Tigers |Washington, D.C. |1897 |Private |2,100 |No | |- |Warren Wilson College |Owls |Swannanoa, North Carolina |1894 |Private |650 |No |TBA |} \u2020 - Women's college, therefore not competing in men's sports. ==External links== * The Association of Division III Independents Independents Division III ",
