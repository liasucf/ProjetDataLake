    "text": "Wurstsalat (German, literally sausage salad) is a tart sausage salad prepared with distilled white vinegar, oil and onions. A variation of the recipe adds strips of pickled gherkin. It is normally made from a sort of boiled sausage like Lyoner, stadtwurst, Regensburger Wurst (two types of cooked sausage) or extrawurst. It is a traditional snack in southern Germany, Alsace, Switzerland and Austria, where in Austria it is called Saure Wurst. To prepare the dish, the sausage is cut into thin slices or strips and placed, along with raw onion rings or cubes, in a vinegar and oil marinade, lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes paprika. Common additional ingredients are finely cut gherkins, radishes, parsley or chives. Wurstsalat is normally served with bread and sometimes also with fried potatoes. Popular variants are the Schw\u00e4bischer Wurstsalat (Swabian wurstsalat), which is half composed of blood sausage, and especially the Schweizer Wurstsalat (Swiss wurstsalat), which like the Stra\u00dfburger Wurstsalat (Strasburg wurstsalat) or Els\u00e4sser Wurstsalat (Alsacian wurstsalat) also contains Emmental cheese and uses the traditional Swiss Servelat instead of Lyoner sausage. ==See also== * Fleischsalat is a similar meat salad, but is usually prepared with a mayonnaise dressing. * List of sausage dishes ==References== Category:Salads Category:Meat dishes Category:Swabian cuisine Category:Sausage dishes ",
