During its history, the brand has also been labeled Flor de Juan L\u00f3pez, only to return to the original name in time. In September 1960, the Cuban revolutionary government nationalized the Cuban cigar industry and seized the factory where Juan L\u00f3pez cigars were manufactured.Savona, David, The Exodus, Cigar Aficionado, Nov/Dec. 2002 Production was resumed, and today all Juan L\u00f3pez cigars are made by hand (totalmente a mano) at the La Habana factory in Havana.Suckling, James, Cuba\u2019s 21st-Century Factories, Cigar Aficionado, March/April 2003 ==Non-Cuban production== There is also a non- Cuban 'Juan Lopez' cigar made with Nicaraguan tobaccos, and marketed by Altadis S.A.
