As a Fulbright and Roberto Wirth scholar, he received his bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Film from Gallaudet University, Washington, D.C., the only liberal arts college for the deaf in the world, and his master's degree in mass communication, summa cum laude, from University of Rome La Sapienza.http://www.oggi7.info/node/2327/print/ Insolera speaks and read lips fluently even though sign language is his native language. He has an older brother, Humberto, himself deaf too. Upon completing his studies, Insolera settled down in New York City and worked for MTV, Time Out New York and ELLE. ==Career== Tim Burton and Emilio Insolera in Tokyo Insolera wrote, directed and produced the long feature superhero film Sign Gene. The film, shot between Japan, the US and Italy, centres on deaf superheroes who have the ability to create superhuman powers through the use of sign language.http://timetable.yanbe.net/pdv.cgi?d=20090816&p;=41&v;=1&c;=103162474200908161930 The characters are blessed with arcane powers \"- like those, when signing the word 'close', of being able to make doors close at will; or where, when signing the word 'weapon', hands actually metamorphose into bona fide weapons, replete with spewing fire and all sorts.\" Originally starting out as a short film, it garnered such a groundswell of interest with people offering to become involved, that Insolera, upon realizing it had the legs for a shot at the big time, had to rewrite the script into a feature- length.https://www.kansaiscene.com/2009/12/emilio-insolera/ The casting came by way of word of mouth: Insolera was especially looking for native signers fluent in Sign language.http://tokyojournal.com/component/k2/item/743-issue-267-summer-2009-father- of-sign-genehttp://news.cinecitta.com/IT/it-it/news/53/42467/15-24-sign-gene- un-film-tutto-da-guardare.aspx The film had its world premiere on September 8, 2017 in Milan, was released in theatres by the UCI Cinemas on September 14, 2017, had its US debut on April 13, 2018 and was released in Japan on September 14, 2018.

On Los Angeles Times, Michael Rechtshaffen describes the \u201cfresh, unique filmmaking voice\u201d as a \u201cfast-paced potpourri of stock footage combined with sign-language and stroboscopic action sequences performed by a deaf cast, video effects simulating grainy, scratchy film stock and that aforementioned all-enveloping sound mix, with an end result that proves as wildly inventive as it is empowering\u201d. On Avvenire it reads the film \u201cwill mostly like to the younger generation accustomed to the rapid and psychedelic language of video games or Japanese cartoons\u201d. Writing for ASVOFF, Giorgia Cantarini says the story is intricate and \u201cvery fascinating. The sounds create an unexpected important part, sometimes overwhelming who is watching. All happens very fast and astonishes you with a vibrant energy\u201d. On Corriere della Sera, Michela Trigari calls Sign Gene an \u201cexperimental film\u201d that uses the science fiction as a medium to capture the imagination and \u201cmake visible what is invisible to the eyes\u201d.
