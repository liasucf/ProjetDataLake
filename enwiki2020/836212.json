His rule was a period of consolidation for the Empire. Huvishka's territory encompassed Balkh in Bactria to Mathura in India, locations were it is known that he minted his coinage. His reign seems to have been essentially peaceful, consolidating Kushan power in northern India, and moving the center of the Kushan Empire to the southern capital city of Mathura. ==Religion== Huvishka was the son of Kanishka. His reign is also known as the golden age of Kushan rule. The reign of Huvishka corresponds to the first known epigraphic evidence of the Buddha Amitabha, on the bottom part of a 2nd-century statue which has been found in Govindo-Nagar, and now at the Mathura Museum. The statue is dated to \"the 28th year of the reign of Huvishka\", and dedicated to \"Amitabha Buddha\" by a family of merchants. There is also some evidence that Huvishka himself was a follower of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. A Sanskrit manuscript fragment in the Sch\u00f8yen Collection describes Huvishka as one who has \"set forth in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\"Neelis, Jason. Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks. 2010. p. 141 Compared to his predecessor Kanishka, Huvishka was worshipper of Shiva. Coin of Kushan ruler Huvishka diademed, with deity Pharro. Circa CE 152-192 He also incorporates in his coins for the first and unique time in Kushan coinage the Hellenistic- Egyptian Serapis (under the name \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf, \"Sarapo\"Serapis coin), and the Goddess Roma (thought to represent \"Roma aeterna\"), under the name \"Riom\" (Greek: \u03a1\u0399\u039f\u039c).Mario Bussagli, \"L'Art du Gandhara\", 225 Some of the coins of Huvishka also featured Maaseno on his coins, the Kushan incarnation of the Hindu god Karttikeya, or Skanda, whose epithet was \"Mahasena\". This god being particularly important to the Yaudheyas, it may have been incorporated into Kushan coinage when the Kushans expanded into Yaudheya territory in order to establish control of the Mathura area. It may also have been adopted as a way to appease the warlike Yaudheyas. In effect, the Kushans became the suzerains of the Yaudheyas in the area.Classical Numismatics GroupIndian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pratapaditya Pal, University of California Press, 1986, p.78 ==Coinage and statuary== The coinage of Huvishka is characterized by a great variety of designs and the large quantity of gold coins that were minted: more gold coins from Huvishka are known than from all other Kushan rulers combined. The location of his mints was mainly in Balkh and Peshawar, with smaller mints in Kashmir and Mathura. One of the great remaining puzzles of Huvishka's reign is the devaluation of his coinage. Early in his reign the copper coinage plunged in weight from a standard of 16g to about 10-11g. The quality and weight then continued to decline throughout the reign until at the start of the reign of Vasudeva the standard coin (a tetradrachm) weighed only 9g. The devaluation led to a massive production of imitations, and an economic demand for the older, pre-devaluation coins in the Gangetic valley. However, the motivation (and even some of the details) of this devaluation are still unknown. {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:center; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" | style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"| ; Huvishka |- | File:Kushan king or prince.jpg|Kushan king or prince, said to be Huvishka, Gandhara art.
