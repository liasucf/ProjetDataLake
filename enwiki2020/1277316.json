    "text": "Truls Olaf Otterbech M\u00f8rk (born 25 April 1961) is a Norwegian cellist. == Biography == M\u00f8rk was born in Bergen, Norway to a cellist father and a pianist mother. His mother began teaching him the piano when he was seven. M\u00f8rk also played the violin, but soon switched to the cello, taking lessons from his father. M\u00f8rk began his studies with Frans Helmerson at 17 at Edsberg Music Institute. An admirer of Mstislav Rostropovich and the Russian school of cello, M\u00f8rk went on to study with the Russian cellist Natalia Shakhovskaya. In 1982, M\u00f8rk became the first Scandinavian musician to reach the finals of the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow since Arto Noras in 1966, and won the sixth prize. He subsequently went on to win second prize at the 1986 Naumburg Competition in New York City and, in 1986, the Cassado Cello Competition in Florence. In 1989, he embarked on his first major concert tour, soloing with many of the finest orchestras of Europe. In 1994, he toured the United States with the Oslo Philharmonic, including debuts at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. M\u00f8rk, Marriner, Orquesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, Auditorio Nacional, Madrid, 1 February 2015. M\u00f8rk's discography includes an award-winning recordings of the Shostakovich Cello Concertos and of Bach's Suites for Solo Cello. He has recorded for such labels as Virgin Classics and harmonia mundi. M\u00f8rk's interest in chamber music led to the foundation of the International Chamber Music Festival of Stavanger. In April 2009, M\u00f8rk experienced an infection of the central nervous system, presumably caused by a tick bite he received in the United States in 2006, with subsequent encephalitis, and paralysis in the shoulder muscles of the left arm. In the autumn of 2009, he expressed concern that he might never be able to perform again. After 18 months away from concert activity, during which time he was awarded the 2010 Sibelius Prize, M\u00f8rk resumed his career. M\u00f8rk holds a Professorship at the Norwegian Academy of Music, Oslo. He performs on a rare Domenico Montagnana cello (Venice, 1723), whose scroll was made by Stradivarius. Norway's SR-Bank purchased the cello, which is on loan to him. == Honors == *1991: Spellemannprisen in the category Chamber music, together with H\u00e5kon Austb\u00f8 for the album Verker av Franck, Chausson, Debussy, Poulenc *1992: Spellemannprisen in the category Orchestral music for the album Joseph Haydn: Cello concerts, with Det Norske Kammerorkester cond Iona Brown *1993: Spellemannprisen in the category Orchestral music for the album Dvor\u00e1k; Cello-konsert/Tsjaikovskij: Rokokko-variasjoner, with Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra cond.
