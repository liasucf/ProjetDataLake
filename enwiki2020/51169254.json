    "text": "GRB2 associated binding protein 3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GAB3 gene. ==Function== This gene is a member of the GRB2-associated binding protein gene family. These proteins are scaffolding/docking proteins that are involved in several growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways, and they contain a pleckstrin homology domain, and bind SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase and GRB2 adapter protein. The protein encoded by this gene facilitates macrophage differentiation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. == References == == Further reading == * * ",
