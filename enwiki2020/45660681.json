The \u0110ura\u0161evi\u0107 family was a branch of the Kalo\u0111ur\u0111evi\u0107 family. Its members held the most distinct positions in the court of Bal\u0161a III. After the death of Bal\u0161a III they refused Venetian invitations to switch sides and to accept Venetian suzerainty remaining loyal to new lord of Zeta, Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107. They controlled 10 salt ponds in Grbalj valley near Kotor. \u0110ura\u0111 and his brother Aleksa built the Kom Monastery in the period between 1415 and 1427, when Upper Zeta was held by the Crnojevi\u0107i. On 10 March 1420 Venetians promised to appoint \u0110ura\u0111 and his brother Aleksa (Lje\u0161) as governors of Budva. == References == == Sources == * * Category:15th-century Serbian nobility Category:Lords of Zeta Category:Crnojevi\u0107 noble family Category:People of the Serbian Despotate Category:15th-century deaths Category:Bay of Kotor Category:Year of birth unknown ",
