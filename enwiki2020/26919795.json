A new race team, Stewart-Haas Racing, created by a joint venture between Tony Stewart and Gene Haas, hired Gibson to lead the #39 of Ryan Newman.

In 2017, Gibson was the winning crew chief at the Daytona 500, with Kurt Busch winning the race. In 2018, Gibson came out of retirement and became the crew chief for the 4 of Kevin Harvick after crew chief Rodney Childers got suspended for the final 2 races of the season due to a L1 spoiler penalty. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:NASCAR crew chiefs Category:Sportspeople from Daytona Beach, Florida ",
