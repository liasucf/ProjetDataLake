    "text": "The Beira Railroad Corporation (CCFB) is a railway company formed by a lease from the Mozambique Ports and Railways (CFM) to the Indian Rites and Ircon International consortium to operate a railroad that originates from the port of Beira, Mozambique as a terminal. The Beira line is important as it provides port access for landlocked states such as Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Katanga Province. ==History== Originally the Beira railroad already established a connection to Salisbury, now Harare, in 1899 and had been a link in the rail system of southern Africa. Building of the Beira railway started in 1892, during the Portuguese rule of the territory of Mozambique. First, a narrow gauge railway was constructed from Beira to the border city Mutare (Umtali) in Zimbabwe, in total long and opened on 4 February 1898. In 1893 work started in Vryburg, Cape Province, South Africa, to construct a railway to the north, later to be connected to the Beira Railway. In 1898 a line from Salisbury to Mutare was opened, with subsequent conversion of the connecting narrow gauge stretch to Beira in 1900. In 1905, the railway was completed after the opening of the Victoria Falls Bridge at the border of Zambia. The narrow gauge locomotives were later acquired by the South African Railways to be designated to SAR Class NG6. ===Gallery=== Nineteenth-century narrow gauge steam locomotives of the Beira Railway.
