    "text": "Suicide By My Side is the third and final album by the power metal band Sinergy, released in 2002. It shows a substantial progress in their musical style; singer Kimberly Goss performs in a sharper, more aggressive vocal style, and guitarists Alexi Laiho and Roope Latvala perform more technical solos. Goss has noted that while the title (and the title track lyrics) are to an extent autobiographical, unlike she states in the music video, she has never attempted suicide.http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Sinergy.htm The clip at the beginning of the title track is from the stabbing scene of the film Sid and Nancy, which tells the tragic love story of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his toxic lover. The song \"Shadow Island\" is inspired by Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare. The last song, \"Remembrance\", is an instrumental dedicated to the people who died during the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. ==Track listing== #\"I Spit on Your Grave\" - 4:03 #\"The Sin Trade\" - 3:48 #\"Violated\" - 4:07 #\"Me, Myself, My Enemy\" - 4:15 #\"Written in Stone\" - 4:20 #\"Nowhere for No One\" - 3:11 #\"Passage to the Fourth World\" - 3:38 #\"Shadow Island\" - 5:03 #\"Suicide by My Side\" - 3:43 #\"Remembrance\" - 1:59 ==Credits== * Kimberly Goss - Vocals * Alexi Laiho - Guitar, Additional Vocals (on track 8, 9), spitting (on track 1) * Roope Latvala - Guitar * Marco Hietala - Bass * Tommi Lillman - Drums ==References== Category:2002 albums Category:Sinergy albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m ",
