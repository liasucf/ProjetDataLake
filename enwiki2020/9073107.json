    "text": "Life Time is the first full-length studio album by Rollins Band, fronted by ex-Black Flag singer, Henry Rollins. The album was produced by Ian MacKaye, well known in the genre of hardcore punk for his work with Minor Threat and as co-owner of the Dischord record label. MacKaye was also a childhood friend of Rollins, who acted as a roadie for MacKaye's band The Teen Idles. It was originally released in 1987 and included four live tracks recorded in Kortrijk, Belgium in October 1987. It was subsequently re-mastered and re- released in 1999 without the live tracks, but with the addition of three session tracks from the Do It album of 1987. The 2014 reissue on Dischord includes the live tracks but not the bonus tracks included on the 1999 reissue . ==Track listing (1987 original, 2014 vinyl reissue)== #\"Burned Beyond Recognition\" - 2:56 #\"What Am I Doing Here?\" - 3:21 #\"1,000 Times Blind\" - 2:57 #\"Lonely\" - 4:16 #\"Wreck-Age\" - 5:33 #\"Gun in Mouth Blues\" - 8:57 #\"You Look at You\" - 3:31 #\"If You're Alive\" - 2:42 #\"Turned Out\" - 5:57 #\"What Am I Doing Here?\" - 3:20\u2020 #\"intro\" - 1:19\u2020 #\"Burned Beyond Recognition\" - 2:51\u2020 #\"Move Right In\" - 8:34\u2020 #\"Hot Animal Machine II\" - 8:36\u2020 :: \u2020 \\- Recorded live in Kortrijk, Belgium (October 16, 1987) ==Track listing (1999 reissue)== #\"Burned Beyond Recognition\" - 2:56 #\"What Am I Doing Here?\" - 3:21 #\"1,000 Times Blind\" - 2:57 #\"Lonely\" - 4:16 #\"Wreck-Age\" - 5:33 #\"Gun in Mouth Blues\" - 8:57 #\"You Look at You\" - 3:31 #\"If You're Alive\" - 2:42 #\"Turned Out\" - 5:57 #\"Do It\" - 2:43 #\"Move Right In\" - 7:27 #\"Next Time\" - 3:20 ==Release and reception== In an AllMusic review, Chris True says \"When Henry Rollins emerged from the breakup of Black Flag, many thought he couldn't be successful without guitarist Greg Ginn. If nothing else, Life Time proves the detractors wrong. With Ian MacKaye of Fugazi in the production chair, Rollins Band was able to distance themselves from Black Flag with a tight, visceral, and sometimes bluesy album. While more abrasive than later Rollins Band releases, this is worth picking up to better understand the progression of Rollins Band's unique style of emotional funk metal. Remastered and re- released in 1999, the CD has a better sound, but it sacrifices the live tracks (which appear on the original Texas Hotel CD release). The outtakes from the Life Time sessions, however -- \"Do It,\" \"Move Right In,\" and \"Nest Time,\" originally released as the album Do It in 1988\u2014are included.\". ==Personnel== *Henry Rollins \u2013 vocals *Chris Haskett \u2013 guitar *Andrew Weiss \u2013 bass guitar *Sim Cain \u2013 drums *Produced by Ian MacKaye ==References== ==External links== *Dischord Records album page *Comeinandburn.com album page Category:1987 albums Category:Rollins Band albums Category:Buddah Records albums ",
