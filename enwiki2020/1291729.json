This area includes the twin cities of Wahpeton, North Dakota and Breckenridge, Minnesota. The Fargo\u2013Moorhead urban core is actually about forty-five minutes of highway travel from the Wahpeton\u2013Breckenridge core. The main connection between these two pairs of cities is the Red River Valley, the flat, fertile land that both depend upon for a major part of their economies. Potatoes and sugar beets are important crops in the region, in addition to most of the other crops produced elsewhere in Minnesota and North Dakota. ==See also== * Fargo-Moorhead media * North Dakota statistical areas ==References== ",
