    "text": "Philip Morgan (died 1435) was a Welsh clergyman who served as Bishop of Worcester (1419\u20131426), then as Bishop of Ely (1426\u20131435). Morgan had acquired the degree of Doctor of Laws some time before 1398, when he is mentioned in the Episcopal Registers of St. David's as rector of Aberedw, although not yet ordained priest. He became chaplain to King Henry V of England and accompanied him on his campaigns in Normandy in 1417-20. He was given a diplomatic role and was appointed Chancellor of Normandy in April 1418. Morgan was elected Bishop of Worcester on 24 April and appointed on 19 June 1419., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 279. He received possession of the temporalities of the Diocese of Worcester on 18 October and was consecrated on 3 December 1419 in Rouen Cathedral while still in France with King Henry. He was postulated to the archbishopric of York in November or December 1423, but the move was quashed on 14 February 1424., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 282. He remained Bishop of Worcester until he was translated to the bishopric of Ely on 27 February and received possession of the temporalities of the Diocese of Ely on 22 April 1426., Handbook of British Chronology, p. 244. Morgan died at Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire on 25 October 1435, and buried at the church of the Charterhouse in London. ==Citations== ==References== * Category:Archbishops of York Category:Bishops of Ely Category:Bishops of Worcester Category:Year of birth missing Category:1435 deaths Category:15th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:14th-century Welsh people Category:15th-century Welsh people Category:15th-century Welsh clergy Category:14th-century Welsh clergy ",
