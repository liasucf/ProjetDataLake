    "text": "The Hater () is a 2020 Polish thriller drama film directed by Jan Komasa and written by Mateusz Pacewicz. The plot centres around an expelled university student from Warsaw who attempts to steer the internet, causing widespread hatred and violence. It premiered on 6 March 2020 in Poland and went on to win the Best International Narrative Feature Award at Tribeca Film Festival. Whilst fictional, the film does relate to ongoing real-life situations such as the use of social media to psychologically manipulate users and navigate public opinion through fake news. It is a representation of how online- propelled hatred can lead to severe consequences and real-life casualties. Three weeks after the filming was completed, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, city mayor of Gda\u0144sk and a liberal politician frequently targeted by online haters, was stabbed to death during a live broadcast charity event. ==Premise== Tomasz Giemza, a disgraced law student obsessed with the progressive, upper-class Krasucki family, takes a job at a public relations company. What seemed like just another assignment turns out to be a quickly developing troll farm, where he excels in the business of spreading fake news and online hatred targeting famous personalities, internet celebrities and politicians. With time, Tomasz begins to use his newly acquired skills in order to stalk, harass and ultimately control the Krasuckis. ==Cast== * Maciej Musia\u0142owski as Tomasz Giemza * Vanessa Aleksander as Gabriela 'Gabi' Krasucka * Agata Kulesza as Beata Santorska * Danuta Stenka as Zofia Krasucka * Jacek Koman as Robert Krasucki * Maciej Stuhr as Pawe\u0142 Rudnicki * Adam Gradowski as Stefan 'Guzek' Guzkowski * Jedrzej Wielecki as Staszek Rydel ==Production== Principal photography began on 28 October 2018 and ended on 22 December. It was primarily filmed in Warsaw and surrounding areas. The Hater is considered a sequel or a spin-off to Komasa's previous film Suicide Room (2011). ===Assassination of Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz=== On 13 January 2019, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, the liberal mayor of Gda\u0144sk in northern Poland, was stabbed in the heart while speaking on stage at the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity event. He was taken to Gda\u0144sk University Clinical Centre in critical condition, where he underwent five-hour long surgery. He died the following day. The detained killer was a 27-year-old man who was a vehement critic of the liberal and democratic Civic Platform party, of which Adamowicz was a member. The police confirmed he was widely active on social media. The film drew remarkable and unexpected parallels with the attack on Adamowicz. Similarly to the fictional character Rudnicki, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz was a long-time target of an overwhelming hate speech campaign fueled by politicians deriving from far-right and nationalist circles. ==Release== The Hater was released in Poland on 6 March 2020. However, a few days after its release, cinemas and movie theaters were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was distributed worldwide in streaming by Netflix on 29 July 2020. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 7.36/10. On Metacritic, it holds a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Ola Salwa on Cineuropa stated \"The Hater is a thrilling tale of an anti-hero and of the survival of the fittest, which in this case means those who have a strong and agile thumb and index finger.\" Brian Tallerico from RogerEbert.com praised the film's interesting moral narrative. Variety positively reviewed the plot, stating that it \"effectively integrates concerns about how easily people are manipulated\". ===Awards=== The Hater premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in the International Narrative Competition and won Best International Narrative Feature award. The jury comprised film professionals among whom were Danny Boyle and William Hurt. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020 thriller films Category:2020s political thriller films Category:2020s thriller drama films Category:Films about social media Category:Films set in Warsaw Category:Films shot in Warsaw Category:Polish films Category:Polish-language films Category:Polish thriller drama films ",
