Val-d'Or (, , ; \"Golden Valley\" or \"Valley of Gold\") is a city in Quebec, Canada with a population of 32,491 inhabitants according to the Canada 2016 Census. The city is located in the Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region near La V\u00e9rendrye Wildlife Reserve. ==History== Centrale Street in Val-d'Or in 1959 Gold was discovered in the area in 1923. The name of the town is French for \"Valley of Gold.\" While gold is still mined in the area today, base metals, such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) have become increasingly important resources. The ore is usually found in volcanic rocks that were deposited on the sea floor over 2.7 billion years ago. They are referred to as volcanic-hosted (or volcanogenic) massive sulphide deposits (VMS). The city is known for its vast parks, cycle tracks, and forests. Some other attractions include the City of Gold and the mining village of Bourlamaque, which were officially proclaimed historic sites in 1979. The city hosted the Quebec Games in 1987. The local hockey team, the Val-d'Or Foreurs, have played in the QMJHL since 1993, winning the league championship in 1998, 2001 and 2014 to claim a spot in the Memorial Cup. They play at Centre Air Creebec. The Foreurs' mascot is called Dynamit, named after dynamite which was extensively used by the mining industry of Val-d'Or. Val-d'Or was once home to CFS Val-d'Or, a Canadian Forces Station. In the municipal reorganizations of January 1, 2002, Val-d'Or was merged with the neighbouring municipalities of Dubuisson, Sullivan, Val- Senneville and Vassan.

The news propelled the town into the national spotlight, causing Qu\u00e9bec's Public Safety Minister, Lise Th\u00e9riault, to suspend the officers and launch an independent investigation led by the Montr\u00e9al police force. ==Demographics== Population: * Population in 2016: 32,491 ** 2011 to 2016 population change: +1.97% * Population in 2011: 31,862 * Population total in 2001: 31,430 ** Dubuisson: 1,686 ** Sullivan: 3,529 ** Val-d'Or: 22,748 ** Val-Senneville: 2,479 ** Vassan: 988 * Population in 1996: ** Dubuisson: 1,655 ** Sullivan: 3,312 ** Val-d'Or: 24,479 ** Val-Senneville: 2,408 ** Vassan: 988 Private dwellings (occupied by usual residents): 13,960 Mother Tongue: * English: 2.74% * French: 94.16% * English and French: 0.59% * Other only: 2.22% ==City council== City council (as of 2020):https://ville.valdor.qc.ca/la-ville/democratie/conseil-municipal * Mayor: Pierre Corbeil * Councillors: Denis Gigu\u00e8re, Karen Busque, \u00c8veline Laverdi\u00e8re, C\u00e9line Brindamour, L\u00e9andre Gervais, Sylvie H\u00e9bert, Lisyane Morin, Robert Quesnel ==Media== Almost all media in Val-d'Or and the nearby city of Rouyn-Noranda serves both cities.
