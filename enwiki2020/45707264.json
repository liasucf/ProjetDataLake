    "text": "Reem Al Marzouqi ( ) is an Emirati engineer and the first citizen of the UAE to be granted a patent in the United States of America for designing a car that can be driven without hands. ==Biography== She received a bachelor's degree in architectural engineering from United Arab Emirates University (UAEU). While studying at UAEU she worked with engineering consultants in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, including Musanada, a buildings construction management and design in facilities management firm. For hands-on engineering, she won second place in Emirates Skills national carpentry competition and she was the only and first female participating. Reem received the granted U.S. patent for her original invention, a \"Lower Extremity Vehicle Navigation Control System\"., and it has since been granted in Japan. The system uses a steering lever, an acceleration lever and a brake lever which are entirely foot-controlled, allowing people to drive a car without the use of their upper body. The system is the first of its kind, and the UAEU also has patents pending in China and the European Union. It has become one of the remarkable success of the Takamul program. The idea of Reem's invention crossed her mind when she watched a TV interview on Inside Edition with Jessica Cox, the world's first licensed armless pilot as she mentioned in her interview difficulties of driving cars for long distances using only her feet. Also she mentioned how it got suspended due to violation in safety rules. Reem has since participated in the Expo Science International exhibition. Her invention was included in the British Museum's A History of the World in 100 Objects exhibition, as displayed at Manarat Al Saadiyat, Abu Dhabi, from April\u2013August 2014. It represented the future, and was heralded by Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, as \"a brilliant example of human beings striving to find new things.\" Based on Reem's academic achievement and extracurricular activities, she was selected by the Academy of Achievement to participate as 2014 innovation and technology delegate at the 51st Annual International Achievement Summit in San Francisco, California.https://www.achievement.org/summit/2014/ Reem has featured in the Arabian Business 50 Most Influential Women in the Arab World in 2018https://www.arabianbusiness.com/lists/391091-2018-arab-women10reem-al- marzouqi and 100 smartest people in the UAE lists.https://www.arabianbusiness.com/lists/379383-100-smartest-people-in-the- uae-15reem-al-marzouqi == See also == *List of Emiratis *Women in the United Arab Emirates *Women in Arab societies ==References== Category:Emirati mechanical engineers Category:United Arab Emirates University alumni Category:Living people Category:Emirati inventors Category:Emirati architects Category:Emirati women engineers Category:Muslim inventors Category:21st- century women engineers Category:21st-century inventors Category:Women inventors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
