He graduated first in his class from the Chorillos Military Academy in 1915. He joined the army and as a Lieutenant Colonel was a war hero in the 1941 Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War. He soon achieved the rank of Major General. In 1945, Jos\u00e9 Bustamante had attained the presidency with the help of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). Soon, major disagreements arose between V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre, the founder of APRA, and President Bustamante. The President disbanded his Aprista cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. Odr\u00eda, a fierce opponent of APRA, was appointed Minister of Government and Police. In 1948, Odr\u00eda and other right-wing elements urged Bustamante to ban APRA. When the President refused, Odr\u00eda resigned his post. On October 27, 1948, he led a successful military coup against the government and took over as president. After two years, he resigned and had one of his colleagues, Zen\u00f3n Noriega, take office as a puppet president so he could run for president as a civilian. He was duly elected a month later as the only candidate. Odr\u00eda came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right. Like Juan Per\u00f3n, he followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, civil rights in the nation were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his r\u00e9gime. People feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely; they were surprised when Odr\u00eda legalized opposition parties in 1956 and called fresh elections. He did not run for office. He was succeeded by a former president, Manuel Prado. When national elections were held again in 1962, Odr\u00eda ran as a right-wing candidate for the Uni\u00f3n Nacional Odriista party. None of the three major candidates - Odr\u00eda, Haya de la Torre and Fernando Bela\u00fande - received the required one third of the vote to win with a plurality. It appeared that Odr\u00eda would win the Presidency in Congress, after having made a deal with Haya de la Torre, but a military coup removed President Prado from office a few days before his term ended. Elections were held again in 1963, with the same three major candidates. This time Bela\u00fande won with 39% of the vote.\"Peru, Revolution Within the Law,\" TIME Magazine: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940508,00.html During the Bela\u00fande administration, Odr\u00eda made an alliance with Haya de la Torre to create a single opposition block in Parliament, which became known as the APRA-UNO Coalition. As a political force, they managed to create strong parliamentary opposition to President Bela\u00fande, who was forced to make important concessions to the Coalition in order to get most of his party- sponsored legislation enacted. The Coalition suffered a setback after losing the elections for mayor in the capital, Lima. After the military coup that overthrew Bela\u00fande in 1968, Odr\u00eda kept a low profile in Peruvian politics until his death in 1974. == Descendants Currently Active in Peruvian Politics == Enrique Odr\u00eda Sotomayor == Notes == Category:1897 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Peruvian generals Category:Presidents of Peru Category:Odriist National Union politicians Category:Peruvian people of Basque descent Category:Grand Crosses Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ",
