June 1844 \u2013 9 April 1932). If so, they did not accompany him to Australia. Fellow- passengers included his business partner John Charles Lanyon, but also George Scarfe, who would years later be a partner, but whether he was known to the others is open to conjecture. Scarfe was not an emigrant at this stage; he would make a second voyage on the Frances Henty some four years later and their famous partnership a few years later still. Lanyon and Harris's first shipments arrived within a month and they set up shop as ironmongers at 43 Hindley Street opposite the \"Black Bull\" hotel. Their partnership was dissolved in March 1855, and Lanyon left South Australia by the barque Iris for London, where he started in business as a purchasing agent, servicing Harris and other Australian merchants. In 1864 Harris established a second store at Gawler Place, while Scotsman William Fraser and another employee, George Scarfe, ran the Hindley Street business as Scarfe & Fraser. They began selling off stock at discounted prices in March 1866 and the partnership was dissolved in August of that year, when it was revealed Harris had been a silent partner. Harris and Scarfe formed the partnership George P. Harris, Scarfe, & Co. in December 1866, at 58-60 Gawler Place, midway between Rundle and Grenfell streets, much later the site of Allan's music store. Around that time Richard Smith, their diligent salesman, was made a partner and their managing director. Harris and family left Adelaide by SS Balclutha on 14 January 1867, for Melbourne, and thence to London. He died six years later at \"Castle House\", Shooter's Hill, London. ==Other interests== *He was prominent in the 1864 establishment of the Jubilee Wesleyan Methodist church in Kent Town, and a dedicated worshipper and supporter.
