    "text": "2preciious was a Canadian alternative rock band featuring Lee Aaron.\"Karen/Lee brings out SoF's best\". The Province, August 22, 1996. ==Background== Aaron was increasingly disillusioned with big label mainstream rock music, feeling that the \"Metal Queen\" image of her earlier albums was now part of her past and that it was time to move in a new direction.\"She's no Lee Aaron: Former metal queen tries to escape her past with new name, band\". Ottawa Citizen, August 28, 1996. In early 1994 she met with Don Short and Don Binns of the Canadian band Sons of Freedom, who participated in the recording of Aaron's 1994 album Emotional Rain.\"Aaron still trying to shake pinup image\". Edmonton Journal, October 11, 1994. Following that album, they were joined by Sons of Freedom's Don Harrison on guitar to record the new songs \"Strange Alice\" and \"Concrete & Ice\", which were added as bonus tracks to the European edition of Emotional Rain. ==Release== In November 1995 the four musicians began recording a new album under the band name 2preciious. As part of the rejuvenation process, the name Lee Aaron was not seen on the original release of the album and Aaron's contributions were under her real name, Karen Greening.\"Goodbye Lee Aaron, and hello to Karen\". Kingston Whig-Standard, August 31, 1996. The album was released in 1996, and the band toured to support the album.\"Dons of Freedom find new team: They've joined former Metal Queen\". The Province, October 16, 1996. Critical response to the album was mixed: The Globe and Mail's Chris Dafoe dismissed it as crass and calculated, and labelled the single \"Crawl\" as a blatant copy of Alanis Morissette's \"You Oughta Know\";\"Recordings: Pop\". The Globe and Mail, August 31, 1996. while Peter Howell of the Toronto Star said that the album was uneven but showed potential, comparing it more to Garbage.\" The sound of Pearl Jam getting over itself\". Toronto Star, August 24, 1996. The band did not record another album. Aaron subsequently moved from rock to jazz singing,\"'Metal Queen' at 38: Lee Aaron goes jazz: Former 'sex symbol of the year' returns with new CD\". National Post, June 26, 2000. while The Three Dons moved into production and re-emerged as musicians with the band Jakalope in 2004.\"Dave Ogilvie Recruits Trent Reznor And The Sons Of Freedom For Jakalope\". Chart Attack, March 9, 2004. ==Discography== ===2preciious (1996)=== ====Track listing==== # Crawl \u2013 4:58 # Superbitch \u2013 3:53 # Come On \u2013 4:37 # My Machine \u2013 4:12 # Mascara \u2013 4:14 # Misenchanted \u2013 4:35 # Black Metal Jesus \u2013 3:01 # Here \u2013 3:49 # Obsolete \u2013 4:00 # Shed \u2013 4:23 # Strange Alice \u2013 4:48 # Dying Star \u2013 4:50 ====Personnel==== *Don Binns \u2013 bass *Don Short \u2013 drums *Don Harrison \u2013 guitar *Lee Aaron \u2013 vocals *Tim Ashworth \u2013 cello *Vince Jones \u2013 keyboards * Producer \u2013 John Albani Remix \u2013 Glen Reely * Music By, Lyrics By \u2013 Don Binns, Don Harrison, Don Stubbs, Karen Greening. * Producer \u2013 2 preciious* (tracks: 1 to 10, 12), Glen Reely (tracks: 1 to 10, 12), Lee Aaron (tracks: 1 to 10, 12) * Recorded By, Mixed By \u2013 Glen Reely (tracks: 1 to 10, 12) ==References== Category:Musical groups from Ontario Category:Canadian alternative rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1996 Category:1995 establishments in Canada ",
