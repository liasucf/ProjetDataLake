    "text": "Paolo Renosto (10 October 1935 \u2013 10 February 1988) was an Italian composer, conductor and pianist. Born in Florence, Renosto was educated at the conservatory of his hometown, where he studied piano and composition. He later became a pupil, a collaborator and a real-life friend of Bruno Maderna, who was the official conductor for the world premieres of two of the most important compositions of Renosto, \"Forma op.7\" (1968) and \"Nacht\" (1969). Renosto later dedicated to Maderna's memory the composition \"Concerto per pianoforte e orchestra\" (1975). Renosto was author of symphonic, choral, chamber, solo and incidental music compositions. He was also a musical critic and historian, and he collaborated with RAI as creator and host of several radio programs dedicated to contemporary classical music. He also composed, sometimes under the pseudonym Lesiman, theme music for films, TV-programs and documentaries. He died of heart attack. He taught on the faculty of the Bologna Conservatory where one of his pupils was Chiara Benati. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1935 births Category:1988 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:20th-century Italian composers Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini faculty Category:Contemporary classical composers Category:Italian classical composers Category:Italian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:Italian male pianists Category:Italian male conductors (music) Category:Italian film score composers Category:Italian male classical composers Category:Italian radio personalities Category:Male film score composers Category:People from Florence Category:20th-century Italian conductors (music) Category:20th-century Italian male musicians ",
