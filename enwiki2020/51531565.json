Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (literally:Stone bridge) is a combined regulator dam and bridge located in Bey\u015fehir district of Konya Province, central Turkey. It was constructed as a flood barrier as part of the irrigational Konya Plain Project on the ground of a ruined 8\u201310 arched bridge between 1908 and 1914. Its completion was delayed due to repeated flooding at the Lake Bey\u015fehir. The dam was commissioned by Albanian Ottoman Grand Vizier Mehmed Ferid Pasha of Vlor\u00eb (in office 1903\u20131908), (). Regulated water draining off the lake contributed to the rise of the formerly droughty and quaggy Konya Plain into a \"granary\". Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc is situated over the Bey\u015fehir- So\u011fla-Apa Canal close to the Lake Bey\u015fehir. The -long and -wide ashlar-masonry combined dam-bridge structure has two level of 15 arches and floodgates. The bridge was initially open to motorized traffic. After the building of a new road bridge west of it, Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc is used today as a pedestrian bridge only. With effect on July 12, 1980, the historic monumental structure was put under protection by the Cultural and Natural Heritage Protection Board. ==References== Category:Dams in Konya Province Category:Arch bridges in Turkey Category:Dams completed in 1914 Category:Bridges completed in 1914 Category:1914 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Pedestrian bridges in Turkey Category:Bey\u015fehir District Category:Ottoman bridges in Turkey Category:Stone bridges in Turkey ",
