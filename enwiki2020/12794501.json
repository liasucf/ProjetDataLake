    "text": "Survival training is a theoretical and physical practise where participants aim to survive in the wilderness with as little means as possible. Survival training is used to train survival skills or as recreational activity where individuals are generally challenged to sustain their basic needs, such as food, water and shelter, in a non-civilised area, with little or only natural resources. This could include taking long hikes, lighting fires, sailing in canoes or rafts, fishing, biking (for example with mountain bikes) and so on. Survival trainings are mostly held in forests, mountain ranges and hilly areas, such as the Alps. Different organisations coordinate recreational survival trainings, some of which are for children. They are popular as business excursions, team building exercises or as a holiday. Survival training in a recreational context has the intention to help expand team work or strengthen the bond of a group by challenging team members, but can also be practised alone or individually. == See also == * Survivalism Category:Outdoor recreation ",
