    "text": "\"Please, Please, Please\" is a rhythm and blues song performed by James Brown and The Famous Flames. Written by Brown and Johnny Terry, with music arrangement by Belford \"Sinky\" Hendricks, and released as a single on Federal Records in 1956, it reached No. 6 on the R&B; charts. The group's debut recording and first chart hit, it has come to be recognized as their signature song. ==Background== In 1952, James Brown was released from a youth detention center in Toccoa, Georgia after Bobby Byrd and his family sponsored him. Brown's warden agreed to the release on the condition that Brown not return to Augusta. After his release, Brown briefly pursued a career in sports before starting his musical career as a gospel vocalist with the group the Ever-Ready Gospel Singers. When a member of Bobby Byrd's vocal group, the Avons, died in 1954, Byrd asked Brown to join his group. A year later, after performing as the Five Royals, they became the Flames, playing all over Georgia and South Carolina. According to Etta James, Brown and his group came up with the idea for their first song, because Brown \"used to carry around an old tattered napkin with him, because Little Richard had written the words, 'please, please, please' on it and James was determined to make a song out of it\".Merlis, Bob; Seay, Davin; James, Etta (1997), p. foreword. Heart and Soul \u2013 A Celebration of Black Music Style in America 1930\u20131975. ==Reception== \"Please, Please, Please\" was released on March 4, 1956. Though it sold slowly at first, the record reached the top ten of the R&B; charts by late summer, eventually peaking at No. 6, selling between one and three million copies.White, Cliff (1991). Discography. In Star Time (p. 55) [CD liner notes]. London: Polydor Records. In 2011, \"Please, Please, Please\" was ranked No. 143 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". ==Live performances== The initial performances of the song were subpar though the group itself was received well. It took a number of years until the Flames developed a routine for the performance. Starting in 1959, Brown would perform the song to the point of feigned exhaustion, when he would drop to his knees and collapse on the stage. Meanwhile, a fellow Flame (sometimes Bobby Byrd and at other times Bobby Bennett) would drop either a blanket or big towel around Brown's back and help him offstage. Before completely exiting, Brown would rip the towel off and return to his microphone, adding to the excitement of his audience. Influenced by Little Richard and professional wrestler Gorgeous George, who both wore capes, Brown began wearing capes in his act. ==Personnel== * James Brown \u2013 lead vocal with the Flames: * Bobby Byrd \u2013 background vocals * Johnny Terry \u2013 background vocals * Sylvester Keels \u2013 background vocals * Nash Knox \u2013 background vocals * Nafloyd Scott \u2013 guitar plus: * Wilbert \"Lee Diamond\" Smith \u2013 tenor saxophone * Ray Felder \u2013 tenor saxophone * Lucas \"Fats\" Gonder \u2013 piano * Clarence Mack \u2013 bass * Edison Gore \u2013 drumsLeeds, Alan, and Harry Weinger (1991). \"Star Time: Song by Song\".

Brown also re-recorded the song several times later in his career. On his 1972 album Get on the Good Foot, he did an upbeat long version, which lasted over twelve minutes. 1974's Hell included a salsa version of the song that featured Brown speaking in Spanish. For Brown's 1976 album Hot, he recorded a more solemn, ballad rendition, which featured male background vocalists in the quiet storm style of Barry White's music. Ike & Tina Turner released a live version of \"Please, Please, Please\" as single on Kent Records, which was included on their 1964 album Ike & Tina Turner Revue Live. They also performed the song on The Big T.N.T Show in 1965. After their resurgence on the charts, Kent reissued the single in 1970. It reached No. 45 on Record World's R&B; chart. The song has been covered by many other performers, including The Residents and The Who on My Generation (1965). ==References== ==External links== * AllMusic review Category:1956 debut singles Category:1956 songs Category:Federal Records singles Category:Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Category:James Brown songs Category:Songs written by James Brown Category:The Famous Flames songs Category:The Who songs Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:1964 singles Category:Kent Records singles ",
