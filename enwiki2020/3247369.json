    "text": "Secret Gig (SG) 14 - Live in Mallorca was a DVD of a special gig played for a select group of fans by English rock band Embrace, whom they took on a cruise holiday to Majorca, and was released only through their official website. Highlights and documentary from this secret gig and a few others are also available on an updated version of their fourth album Out of Nothing. Embrace are one of few bands to play small, intimate gigs at rather strange locations for their more dedicated fans, whilst still managing to fill arenas and city centres. This DVD makes a point of that. They have also played the Big Brother house, Carnglaze Caverns in Cornwall, a custard factory, and even a fan's house. Usually fans have to enter a competition in order to go to one of these gigs. ==Track listing== ===Live On The Sunseeker=== *\"Wonder\" ===Live at El Cielo Caf\u00e9, Palma, Majorca=== *\"Someday\" *\"My Weakness Is None of Your Business\" *\"All You Good Good People\" *\"Gravity\" *\"Fireworks\" *\"Ashes\" *\"Come Back to What You Know\" *\"Wish 'Em All Away\" *\"Keeping\" ===Live in the Big Brother House (SG#16) - Hidden Easter Egg=== *\"Someday\" (Acoustic) *\"Ashes\" (Acoustic) *\"The Good Will Out\" (Acoustic) Category:Embrace (English band) albums ",
