    "text": "Agnes Hildegard Sj\u00f6berg (15 November 1888 Kauhajoki - 21 August 1964 Sein\u00e4joki) was a Finnish veterinarian. She graduated as a veterinarian and as the first woman in Europe and likely the first woman in the world to defend her PhD in veterinary medicine. During her career, Sj\u00f6berg worked as a municipal veterinarian in Somero and N\u00e4rpi\u00f6 and held a private reception for a long time. Sj\u00f6berg was subjected to prejudice and discrimination by colleagues, and her pioneering work as a female veterinarian was not recognized until much after her death. == Biography == === Early life and education === Agnes Sj\u00f6berg's parents were Johan B. Sj\u00f6berg and Karin Norrg\u00e5rd. They had an advanced model farm in Kauhajoki, which included a livestock school and strawberry plantations. Agnes first attended school at home under the guidance of a home teacher and in 1900\u20131905 at the Swedish girls' school in Vaasa. She would have liked to continue as a student, but due to his father's opposition, she continued her studies at the Vaasa School of Economics. After graduating, she took care of her parents' finances for three years, after which her father bowed and let her daughter read as a student. Agnes Sj\u00f6berg graduated as a private student in 1911 from the Swedish co- educational school in Kuopio. === Veterinary studies === As a child, Sj\u00f6berg had dreamed of becoming a veterinarian. Sge had followed the teaching of the cattle school at her home farm and got acquainted with, among other things, the anatomy of the cattle. With the help of her aunt, she was able to assist John Engdahl, Huittinen's district veterinarian, in following the work of the veterinarian. At the end of the internship, Dr. Engdahl admitted that he was prejudiced but recommended her to study in the field. On Engdahl's recommendation, Sj\u00f6berg was promised a place to study at the University of Zurich . Arriving in Switzerland, however, she was disappointed, as the university had just banned Russian citizens - that is, also Finns - from studying at the university for fear of revolutionaries. Sj\u00f6berg received a letter of recommendation from the University of Zurich, which allowed her to begin her veterinary studies in Germany at the University of Dresden in the autumn of 1911. The female student was admitted to study on an experimental basis among 300 male students. At the same time, there were thirty other Finnish veterinary students in Dresden who were hostile to Sj\u00f6berg. Due to pressure and to get rid of other Finnish students, Sj\u00f6berg moved to the University of Berlin the following year, where there were only a few Finnish students. In 1913, Sj\u00f6berg applied to the university for permission to complete a bachelor's degree in veterinary medicine. Sj\u00f6berg's gender again caused problems, as according to university rules, only a male student could complete a degree. The matter went to the level of the ministry, and in the summer of 1913 an official decision was made that a woman student could also graduate as a veterinarian in Germany. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 delayed Agnes's completion until the spring of 1916. During the war, however, she was able to work at the University Animal Clinic with men on the front lines. After graduating he began to work on and defend her dissertation in Leipzig 1918. The title of the dissertation was Klinische und chemisch- mikroskopische Untersuchungen des Augensekretes der Pferde . === Career in Finland === In the same year that Sj\u00f6berg received her doctorate, she returned to Finland. She took on the position of municipal veterinarian, first in Somero in 1918\u20131920 and then in N\u00e4rpi\u00f6 in 1920\u20131923. In 1923, she traveled abroad again to learn more, first to London, then to the United States, and finally to Germany and Austria. During her trip, she became acquainted with schools and clinics in the field, and engaged in work and further research. One result of the trip was a study on ruminant parasites. Sj\u00f6berg returned to Finland again in 1926, first opening a private veterinary practice in Kauhajoki where she operated in 1926\u20131932 and then in Kurikka in 1932\u20131935. After working as a meat inspector in Ilmajoki in 1935\u20131938, she eventually settled in Sein\u00e4joki, where she had her own animal clinic in 1938\u20131955. Among her clients Sj\u00f6berg had been popular, but this was not the case with many other veterinary colleagues. Early in her career, she quarreled with Rainer Stenius, long-time chairman of the Veterinary Association and advisor to the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the Ministry of Agriculture. After the Board of Honor of the Veterinary Association accused Sj\u00f6berg of uncollegial conduct, she resigned from the association, embittered. In 1918 the Finnish news magazine Suomen Kuvalehti made the following remarks: > \"Her medical practice in Germany, where she has cared for even large > domestic animals, horses, cows, etc., thus proves that a woman's strength is > sufficient for this profession as well.\" Sj\u00f6berg's pioneering work as a female veterinarian was not recognized until much after her death. A street close to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in the Viikki district of Helsinki was named Agnes Sj\u00f6berg Street in 2001, and in her native Kauhajoki S\u00f6\u00f6p\u00e4rintie is named after her. === Personal life === Agnes Sj\u00f6berg married Veikko Klaavu in 1928. It was a short-lived marriage; she had twin sons, whom she raised alone. == Works == * Clinical and chemical- microscopic analysis of the growth of the pens .
