He worked as a doctor in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Australia (in the latter case, for the Royal Flying Doctor Service). He later obtained an MBA from London Business School in 2000, and returned to New Zealand the following year. He worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers as consultant on health sector issues and as a part- time general practitioner in Otara. He entered the selection for the National Party candidacy for Tamaki but was defeated by Allan Peachey before successfully contesting the candidacy for Northcote. He has a 170-year family connection to his Northcote electorate and \u201ca bit of tangata whenua thrown in\u201d to his bloodline. ==Member of Parliament== In the 2005 election, Coleman stood as the National Party's candidate for the Northcote seat. He was also ranked 35th on the party's list. Coleman was successful, defeating Ann Hartley of the Labour Party. This was the only Auckland seat to change hands between Labour and National in the 2005 election. In 2006, Coleman (then the National Party's associate health spokesman) caused controversy when he accepted British American Tobacco's \u2013 an active lobbier on health sector issues \u2013 offer of sitting in their corporate box during a U2 concert. It was alleged he blew cigar smoke at a woman during the concert. Coleman admitted he made a mistake by sitting in British American Tobacco's corporate box and smoking at a U2 concert.

In 2012, Coleman made a secret visit to Afghanistan to visit New Zealand troops. Coleman said the visit was a \"chance for him to offer his support to the troops for the important work they were doing providing security in the province\". As Minister of Defence, Coleman led the implementation of the 2010 Defence White Paper. He commissioned the Defence Mid-Point Rebalancing Review which set out the long term approach, balancing funding, capabilities and policy.

On 20 May 2015, a meeting in Alexandra organised by Central Otago Health Services Ltd supported a vote of no confidence in Health Minister Jonathan Coleman. When Russell Garbutt moved a motion of no confidence in the minister and emailed him the following morning, he did not expect Coleman to pick up the phone and call [him]. They spoke for more than 10 minutes, with Coleman telling Mr Garbutt the Southern District Health Board (SDHB) was his number 1 priority in respect of its budget woes. ====Leadership campaign==== Coleman announced his intention to seek the National Party leadership in 2016 after John Key announced his intention to resign. He was unsuccessful, with Bill English becoming the new PM. ====Resignation==== On 22 March 2018, Coleman announced he would resign from Parliament, thereby triggering the 2018 Northcote by-election. ==References== ==External links== * * Profile at National Party website * |- |- |- |- |- Category:1966 births Category:Government ministers of New Zealand Category:Living people Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand MPs for Auckland electorates Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:People educated at Auckland Grammar School Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:21st-century New Zealand politicians Category:Candidates in the 2017 New Zealand general election Category:New Zealand defence ministers ",
