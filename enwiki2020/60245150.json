The museum was named in honor of Mikhail Nesterov, a Russian painter and Ufa native. The museum's collection includes works by David Burliuk, Alexey Kuznetsov, Ilya Repin, Mikhail Vrubel, Ivan Aivazovsky, Valentin Serov, Isaac Levitan, Alexei Savrasov, and Boris Kustodiev, among others. == History == Mikhail Nesterov M.Nesterov Art Museum (Ufa) In 1913 at Mikhail Nesterov, a native of Ufa, presented his native city with a unique collection of works by Russian painters of the second half of the XIX - early XX centuries, as well as about thirty of his own paintings. The collection included the works of such famous masters as Ivan Shishkin, Isaac Levitan, Nikolai Yaroshenko, Konstantin Korovin, Alexander Benois, Vasily Polenov, Abram Arkhipov and many others. The exposition of the Ufa authorities was supposed to be placed on the squares under construction Aksakov\u2019s People\u2019s House (now the Opera and Ballet Theater), but its construction was significantly delayed due to the events of World War I and revolutions of 1917. Therefore, until 1919, the Nesterov assembly was kept in Moscow. November 7 1919 and, after the liberation of Ufa from Kolchak\u2019s troops, the provincial Revolutionary Committee in Ufa established by special resolution the foundation of the October Revolution Artistic Proletarian Museum in the city. Since the Aksakov People\u2019s House was not completed, the house of the merchant-timber merchant M. A. Laptev was allocated for the museum. The discovery was preceded by a difficult transportation of the Nesterov collection to Ufa from Moscow, through all of Russia destroyed by the Civil War. This case was entrusted to a friend and fellow countryman of the artist, the famous architect Ilya Bondarenko. Upon arrival in Ufa, he was entrusted with the management of the museum, which was opened for visiting in January 1920. I.E. Bondarenko diligently searched for new works for the museum and by May 1920 the museum collection consisted of 1,500 exhibits, and the library - 2,500 volumes. In the 1920s and 1930s, the museum was actively replenished with exhibits from the Moscow and Petrograd museum funds.
