    "text": "Charles Pierre P\u00e9guy (; 7 January 1873 \u2013 5 September 1914) was a noted French poet, essayist, and editor. His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism, but by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy agnosticism, he had become a believing but non-practicing Roman Catholic.\"Peguy's Catholicism was closely allied with his love of France. Of him, as also of Psichari, it might almost be said that they were Catholics because they were Frenchmen. A non-Catholic Frenchman seemed a monstrosity, something cut off from the true life of his country. Some Catholicism is international or indifferent to country, with almost the motto, 'What matters country so long as the Church survives?' But that is not the Catholicism of these young Frenchmen, nor the Catholicism of the recent religious revival.\" \u2013 Rawlinson, Gerald Christopher (1917). \"Charles P\u00e9guy,\" in Recent French Tendencies from Renan to Claudel. London: Robert Scott, p. 121.\"In France the classic type of the fervent but non-practising Catholic was probably best represented by Charles P\u00e9guy\". \u2014 Kuehnelt-Leddihn, Erik von (1952). Liberty or Equality. Caldwell, Idaho: The Caxton Printers, Ltd., p. 194.Ralph McInerny. \"Charles P\u00e9guy\" , 2005. From that time, Catholicism strongly influenced his works. ==Biography== P\u00e9guy was born to poverty in Orl\u00e9ans.MacLeod, Catriona (1937). \"Charles P\u00e9guy (1873\u20131914),\" The Irish Monthly, Vol. 65, No. 770, pp. 529\u2013541. His mother C\u00e9cile, widowed when he was an infant, mended chairs for a living. His father D\u00e9sir\u00e9 P\u00e9guy was a cabinet maker, who died in 1874 as a result of combat wounds. P\u00e9guy studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal in Sceaux, winning a scholarship at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris), where he attended notably the lectures of Henri Bergson and Romain Rolland, whom he befriended. He formally left without graduating, in 1897, though he continued attending some lectures in 1898. Influenced by Lucien Herr, librarian of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, he became an ardent Dreyfusard. In 1897, P\u00e9guy married Charlotte-Fran\u00e7oise Baudoin; they had one daughter and three sons, one of whom was born after P\u00e9guy's death. Around 1910 he fell deeply in love with Blanche Raphael, a young Jewish friend; however, he was faithful to his wife. From his earliest years, he was influenced by socialism. He joined the Socialist Party in 1895. From 1900 until his death in 1914, he was the main contributor to and the editor of the literary magazine Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine, which at first supported the Socialist Party director Jean Jaur\u00e8s. However, P\u00e9guy ultimately ended this support after he began viewing Jaur\u00e8s as a traitor to the nation and to socialism. In the Cahiers, P\u00e9guy published not only his own essays and poetry, but also works by important contemporary authors such as Romain Rolland. His free-verse poem, \"Portico of the Mystery of the Second Virtue\", has gone through more than 60 editions in France. It was a favorite book of Charles de Gaulle. When the Great War broke out, P\u00e9guy became a lieutenant in the 19th company of the French 276th Infantry Regiment. He died in battle, shot in the forehead, near Villeroy, Seine-et-Marne on the day before the beginning of the Battle of the Marne.Schmitt, Hans (1953). \"Charles P\u00e9guy: The Man and the Legend, 1873\u20131953,\" Chicago Review, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 24\u201337. There is a memorial to P\u00e9guy near the field where he was killed. Charles P\u00e9guy Memorial ==Influence== Cover of Die Aktion with P\u00e9guy's portrait by Egon Schiele Benito Mussolini referred to P\u00e9guy as a \"source\" for Fascism. During the Second World War both supporters and opponents of Vichy France cited P\u00e9guy. Edmond Michelet was the first of many members of the French Resistance to quote P\u00e9guy; de Gaulle, familiar with P\u00e9guy's writing, quoted him a 1942 speech. Those who opposed Vichy's anti-Semitism laws often cited him. By contrast, Robert Brasillach praised P\u00e9guy as a \"French National Socialist\", and P\u00e9guy's sons Pierre and Marcel wrote that their father was an inspiration for Vichy's National Revolution ideology and \"above all, a racist\". It has been written that P\u00e9guy would likely have been horrified by his future influence on fascism.Zaretsky, Robert (1996). \"Fascism: the Wrong Idea,\" The Virginia Quarterly Review, pp. 149-155. The English novelist Graham Greene alluded to P\u00e9guy in Brighton Rock, while The Heart of the Matter has as its epigraph a quotation from P\u00e9guy.Grahame C. Jones, \"Graham Greene and the Legend of P\u00e9guy\". Comparative Literature, XXI(2), Spring 1969, pp. 138\u201340. In The Lawless Roads Greene refers to P\u00e9guy \"challenging God in the cause of the damned\".Quoted by Grahame C. Jones, in \"Graham Greene and the Legend of P\u00e9guy\", fn2, p. 139. The Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, in the course of describing the history of art as an ongoing, sometimes more and sometimes less successful approximation of God's creativeness, noted that Peguy's Eve was a \"theological redemption of the project of Proust\", meaning that where Proust was gifted with memory and charity, the Eve of Peguy \u2013 not necessarily Peguy himself \u2013 was gifted with memory, charity, and direct knowledge of the redemption of God. Catholic University Press, 1998 Geoffrey Hill published a poem in 1983 as a homage to P\u00e9guy, entitled The Mystery of the Charity of Charles P\u00e9guy.Hill, Geoffrey (1985). Notes \u2013 Collected Poems. London: Penguin Books. ==Famous quotations== \"The sinner is at the very heart of Christianity. Nobody is so competent as the sinner in matters of Christianity. Nobody, except the saint.\" This is the epigraph to Graham Greene's novel The Heart of the Matter (1948). \"It will never be known what acts of cowardice have been committed for fear of not looking sufficiently progressive.\" (Notre Patrie, 1905) \"Tyranny is always better organised than freedom\". \"Kantian ethics has clean hands but, in a manner of speaking, actually no hands.\" \"How maddening, says God, it will be when there are no longer any Frenchmen.\" \"There will be things that I do that no one will be left to understand.\" (Le Myst\u00e8re des saints Innocents) \"It is impossible to write ancient history because we do not have enough sources, and impossible to write modern history because we have too many\". (Clio, 1909) \"Everything begins in mysticism and ends in politics.\" (Notre Jeunesse, 1909) ==Works== Essays * (1901). De la Raison. * (1902). De Jean Coste. * (1905).
