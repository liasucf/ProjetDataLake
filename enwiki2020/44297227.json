The Robin Hood Gang is a team of six members led by the Master, Indrajit Roy (Sudip Mukherjee). The team was created by the Master for the good of poor people, in fact, it was built for taking a strong vengeance against some people of the past. Abhi was given a mission on capturing the Robin Hood Gang, and he almost does so by finding the path to becoming a member of the team. Abhi, eventually realizes that the team was full of mystery, and his curiosity fastened him to disguise as a member of the team until he is accomplished in revealing the entire mystery of the team. Delay of the arrest sent threat to Abhi from the police department, and finally the order comes to killing all the members of the team. Abhi does not do so \u2013 rather he keeps on finding the mystery behind the team. As a result, the department suspends Abhi. In fact, the act of suspending was committed by a Minister. The Minister, a lawyer (Ramen Shikder) and a doctor (Kamalesh Chatterjee) was once involved in a crime of framing two persons, one was the father of Kotha (Shounak Mitra) and the other was the Master himself. As a matter of fact, Master was a police officer who tried to uncover the real truth behind their act against Kotha's father, but the three of the master-villain frames him in an act of molestation over a woman, which results in execution. But fortunately Master survives, and creates the Robin Hood team for retaliation. Abhi tried to help find Kotha's mother, who was lost from her when she was a child. As the case was related of Kotha's father and the Master was the same, Abhi seems to reach to uncover the truth at an astonishing pace. The whole mystery was related to an NGO called Banerji NGO. Master tries to scare the three villains by prank calls, which leads to a thought to the Minister that the whole problem of prank was done by Abhi due to suspending him, consequently trying to kill him. But every time he tries to do so, he fails to accomplish because of Abhi's quick-witted talents. Eventually Doctor Kamalesh, one of the three villains, was killed by the Minister. Furthermore, he killed Jiban Shomaddar (uncle to Kotha), who was the only evidence of the Banerji NGO in Abhi's opinion \u2013 later Abhi realizes that that was not the only option. Minister's wishes to kill Abhi and Kotha brings an officer Bhashkor in the series, who constantly attempts to do so for in vain. Eventually Abhi solves the whole mystery and learns what actually instigated Master to form Team Robinhood. Abhi's paternal aunt, Malabika Banerjee, who was the head of the Banerjee-NGO, along with the Minister, the Lawyer (Ramen) and the dead doctor (Kamalesh) was engaged in trafficking. Sounak Mitra, Kotha's father, had somehow learnt the truth and so the three had caused ample harassment to him \u2013 got him arrested on false charges of molestation, following which Sounak had committed suicide. The three had also molested Amrita Das Majumder, a woman working in the NGO. Indrajit Roy (Master), who was then an honest police officer was investigating the case but the minister and his troops had even trapped Indrajit and Indrajit was prosecuted. But Indrajit somehow escaped death and formed team Robinhood in order to punish the Minister and help the common masses. Later we come to know that Master is Abhi's real father and Abinash Mukherjee had adopted him. After completing the investigation, Abhi vows to punish the actual criminals and give justice to Master. Therefore, he has the team arrested. The whole team gets angry with Abhi and calls him a betrayer. But at the end, the Minister and Ramen get punished. Leela, Kotha's mother, who, after her husband's death, had been forced to take up prostitution, shoots the Minister to death. At the end, Abhi introduces Kotha to her mother. Kotha, after a year, gets released from the jail, which brings a new plot to the story. While returning to her convent school in Darjeeling , she comes across Anindya and Tanaya. They meet with a car accident and so by twist of fate (in which Tanaya dies), Kotha has to come back to Kolkata as Tojo's (Tanaya's son) governess. There she wins the heart of everyone and finally marries Abhi. In the meantime, Ananya (sister to Tanaya) and Shima (mother to Tanaya) tries to trigger conspiracy on Kotha, but Kotha is intelligent enough to fight back. However, the actual identity of Master, that is, Master or Indrajit Roy is himself Abhi's real father was not revealed to Abhi.Based on the chapters of the serial episodes as made by Star India. ==Cast== * Farhan Imroze as Abhimanyu * Joyeeta Goswami as Katha * Anindita Bose as Sania * Sudip Mukherjee as Master * Manoj Ojha as Anindya Mukherjee * Mohua Haldar as Tanaya Mukherjee * Swagata Mukherjee as Leela ==References== * http://www.startv.in/channel/star-jalsha/15 * http://www.startv.in/show/kanamachi/887 * http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/bengali/Farhan-jealous-of-Raj- Chakrabortys-gift-to-his-heroine/articleshow/40006084.cms ==External links== * on Hotstar Category:2014 Indian television series debuts Category:Bengali- language television programming in India ",
