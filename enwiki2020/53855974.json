    "text": "The Fear is a five-part television drama produced for Thames Television by its subsidiary company Euston Films. Transmitted on ITV in 1988, The Fear is the story of Carl Galton (Iain Glen), the enterprising leader of a criminal gang running a protection racket in North London. Young and ambitious, Galton represents a new breed of criminal who seeks to expand his underworld empire and takes on the old East End firms. 1980's materialism clashes with old school London villainy as Galton rises to power, yet his ruthlessness carries a personal cost, especially on his wife Linda and best friend Marty. ==Cast== * Iain Glen \u2013 Carl Galton * Susannah Harker \u2013 Linda * Anthony Valentine \u2013 Tony Slater * Jesse Birdsall \u2013 Marty * Jerome Flynn \u2013 Freddie * Fergus Brazier \u2013 Nicky * Mario Kalli \u2013 Mario * Denis Lill \u2013 George Klein * Adrian Dunbar \u2013 Con * Linda Marlowe \u2013 Pat Klein ==Home media== The Fear is available on DVD in the UK through a DVD release from Network.
