The album was produced by Nick Launay, with additional production by Calvi. The album features Adrian Utley from Portishead and Martyn P. Casey from Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. Calvi announced the album on 6 June 2018. At the same time she released a single, \"Don't Beat the Girl Out of My Boy\", and announced a European tour in support. Calvi enlisted director Matt Lambert to produce the video for title track \"Hunter\". Dazed labelled it \"an exploration of queer intimacy and self-love.\" ==Critical reception== Hunter was well-received by critics. In The Guardian, critic Michael Hann praised Hunter as \"glorious and triumphant\" and \"a record that succeeds on any terms you try to force upon it\". Cameron Cook of Pitchfork noted Calvi's \"remarkable evolution\" and found that she \"pushes her artistry to another level\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Hunter. ===Musicians=== * Anna Calvi \u2013 vocals, guitar, synths, bass, piano, percussion * Mally Harpaz \u2013 vibraphone, glockenspiel, percussion, piano * Alex Thomas \u2013 drums, timpani, percussion * Adrian Utley \u2013 Solina, Moog synthesizer, Oberheim synthesizer, EBow, Mellotron, Swarmatron * Martyn Casey \u2013 bass * Ming Vauze \u2013 bass, synths, space station FX pedals * Gillian Rivers \u2013 viola, violin * Fiona Brice \u2013 violin; string arrangements on \"Wish\" * Ellie Stanford \u2013 violin * Rachel Robson \u2013 viola * Vicky Matthews \u2013 cello ===Technical=== * Nick Launay \u2013 production, recording, mixing * Anna Calvi \u2013 additional production on \"Indies or Paradise\" and \"Wish\" * Isabel Gracefield \u2013 engineering assistance * Josh Green \u2013 engineering assistance * Mark Knight \u2013 engineering assistance * T.
