    "text": "Tux Typing is a free and open source typing tutor created especially for children. It features several different types of game play, at a variety of difficulty levels. It is designed to be fun and to improve words per minute speed of typists. It is written in the C programming language and is available in the repositories of some Linux distributions such as Fedora. == Interface == There is a practice mode for learning basics of typing. There are also two games. In the first, fish are falling from the sky. Each fish has a letter or a word written on it. When the player presses the corresponding key, or types the appropriate word, Tux will position himself to eat the fish.http://www.pcworld.ca/downloads/details/152332.htm The second game is similar, but the goal is to prevent comets from falling on a city. When a comet lands on the city, the shield will be removed, then if it is hit again without the shield, it disappears. If it is hit by a comet while the city is destroyed, points will be deducted. In both games, different languages can be selected as a source for the words. == See also == * Tux, of Math Command * Tux Paint == References == ;Notes * Tina Gasperson (September 8, 2008) Three typing tutors and a boy, linux.com == External links == * Category:Software for children Category:Typing software Category:Linux games Category:Open- source video games Category:Free educational software Category:GNOME Kids Category:Touch typing tutors for Linux Category:Free software that uses SDL Category:Software that uses Cairo Category:Typing video games ",
