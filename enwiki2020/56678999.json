    "text": "\"Quiet\" is a song co-written, co-produced, and performed by MILCK, the stage name of the Los Angeles artist Connie Lim. It received national attention after she organized a capella performances of the song at the 2017 Women's March in Washington D.C., after which she made the sheet music publicly available and organized further activity around the song. == History== MILCK wrote \u201cQuiet\u201d with her co-writer Adrianne \u201cAG\u201d Gonzalez in 2015. While the song draws on the artist\u2019s adolescent experiences of domestic violence, depression, and anorexia, it was inspired by \u201ca nightmare in which she was being assaulted and a bystander in her dream told her she just needed to stay quiet until it was over.\u201d The lyrical structure of the song breaks with the most common pop music song structure, taking the form of verse, pre-chorus, chorus, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus. MILCK organized 26 singers from various choirs around the U.S. into the #ICANTKEEPQUIET chorus, to perform an a cappella version of her song flash mob style during the 2017 Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C. One performance with the singers from the GW Sirens & Capital Blend went viral on the internet and MILCK was featured in several publications for having authored the \u201cunofficial anthem\u201d of the Women\u2019s March. Within a week, MILCK and other performers reprised the Women's March version on the television show Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. In response to the attention given to \"Quiet\" as a result of the Women's March, MILCK publicized the song on Twitter using the hashtag #ICANTKEEPQUIET. This was intended to allow people to share their stories and access the sheet music for the a cappella version for free, so that they could create their own #ICANTKEEPQUIET choirs. ==Personnel== *MILCK \u2013 composer, lead vocals *Adrianne Gonzalez \u2013 composer, background vocals *Rod Castro \u2013 guitar *Matt Chamberlain \u2013 drums *Patricia Bahia - background vocals *Kyler England - background vocals *Keely Bumford - background vocals *Dia Frampton - background vocals *Mary Osborne - background vocals *Iljeoma Njaka - background vocals *Sophia Dion - background vocals *Hungarian Studio Orchestra - orchestra ==References== Category:2017 songs Category:Women's rights in the United States ",
