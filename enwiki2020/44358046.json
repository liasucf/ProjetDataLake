    "text": "Skeptic is a promotional single by American heavy metal band Slipknot from their fifth major label studio album .5: The Gray Chapter. The song was first released as a promo/digital single on October 17, 2014. It was released on the same day as \"Killpop\". It was the sixth promotional single and eighth overall single released from the album. The song is a tribute piece to late bassist Paul Gray who died from a drug overdose in May 2010. ==Background== The song was uploaded to their official YouTube channel on the same day as the Japan release of .5: The Gray Chapter on October 17, 2014. It featured original cover art; it is unknown at this time whether \"Skeptic\" will be a radio single and have a music video or will remain as a promotional single. ==Critical reception== Loudwire stated \"Today, we treat our ears to \u2018Skeptic.\u2019 Fans will automatically zone in on the track\u2019s chorus: \u201cThe world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you / The world will never know another man as amazing as you.\u201d Additional lyrics such as, \u201cYou were a gift,\u201d \u201cHe was the best of us\u201d and \u201cI will keep your soul alive\u201d point further toward Gray as the man referenced in \u2018Skeptic.\" Metal Insider said \"With a line like \u201cthe world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you, the world will never know another man as amazing as you,\u201d we\u2019re inclined to agree with that statement.\" \"Skeptic\" was also included at number 99 on Spin magazine's list of the 101 Best Songs of 2014. Describing the song as \"one of the year's most affecting love songs\" that takes Slipknot \"to surprisingly maudlin heights on the scream-along chorus\", the magazine also noted it as \"a rare unmasked moment for the enduring septet\". Despite this, the review concluded that \"the song is far too pulverizing to ever be considered their \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\"\". ==References== Category:Slipknot (band) songs Category:2014 songs Category:Songs written by Corey Taylor Category:Songs written by Jim Root * * * * ",
