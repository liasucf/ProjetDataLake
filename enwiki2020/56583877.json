    "text": "', provisional designation ' with cometary number 362P, is a Hildian asteroid and rare main-belt comet from the outermost regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 8 April 2008, by astronomers of the Spacewatch program at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. The presumably carbonaceous body has a rotation period of 10.7 hours. == Orbit and classification == ' is classified as a member of the dynamical Hilda group, as well as a main-belt comet that shows clear cometary activity, which has also been described as a \"quasi Hilda comet\". Orbital backward integration suggests that it might have been a centaur or trans-Neptunian object that ended its dynamical evolution as a quasi Hilda comet. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9\u20135.1 AU once every 7 years and 11 months (2,883 days; semi-major axis of 3.96 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 16\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in October 2001, more than 5 years prior to its official discovery observation by Spacewatch. ' has a Jupiter Tisserand's parameter (TJ) of 2.926, just below Jewitt's threshold of 3, which serves as a distinction between the main-belt asteroids (TJ larger than 3) and the Jupiter-family comets (TJ between 2 and 3). == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 16 February 2016 (). As of 2018, it has not been named. == Physical characteristics == ' is an assumed C-type asteroid. === Rotation period === In August 2017, a rotational lightcurve of ' was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a small brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude (). === Diameter and albedo === The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous body of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 14.64 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.9. Other estimates, taking into account several published magnitude measurements and a large range of albedo assumptions, estimate a diameter range of 5.5 to 24.7 kilometers. == Notes == == References == == External links == * COMETARY ACTIVITY IN (457175) 2008 GO98, Minor Planet Electronic Circular, Minor Planet Center * It's an Asteroid, It's a Comet, It's\u2026 well, Both for Now!, Catalina Sky Survey, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory * Cometary activity in (457175) 2008 GO98, The Virual Telescope, 23 August 2017 * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (455001)-(460000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 457175 457175 457175 20080408 ",
