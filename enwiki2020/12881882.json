    "text": "Heptacodium miconioides, the seven son flower, is a species of flowering plant. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Heptacodium, of the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae. The common name \"seven son flower\" is a direct translation of the Standard Chinese name \u4e03\u5b50\u82b1 qi zi hua. Endemic to China, this species was discovered for Western horticulture in 1907 by the British plant hunter Ernest Wilson on behalf of the Arnold Arboretum. It was growing on mountain cliffs at 'Hsing-Shan Hsien' in present day Xingshan County in the west of Hubei Province in central China.Heptacodium miconioides Rehder - online article in the series 'Tree of the Year' by Grimshaw, John http://www.dendrology.org/publications/tree-of-the-year/heptacodium- miconioides-2012/ Retrieved 11.14 on 16 May 2018 Considered rare even at that time, only nine populations are known to remain in the wild (e.g. one on Tiantai Mountain), all of them in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces and threatened by habitat loss. The species is now under second-class national protection in China. The Sino-American Botanical Expedition of 1980 collected viable seeds and sent them to the Arnold Arboretum where it was found to be readily cultivated. The plant is now grown as an ornamental around the world. ==Description== Heptacodium miconioides is a deciduous large shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of . The bark of the trunk is papery and thin, light tan in colour, and exfoliates in strips or sheets. The upright, spreading, quadrangular branches give the plant a rounded, often irregular shape. The dark-green cordate leaves are opposite, 8\u201310 cm long by 5\u20136 cm wide, with entire margins and deeply impressed venation running parallel to the margin. In September, H. miconioides produces large shows of small fragrant white blooms attractive to butterflies and bumblebees,https://afrenchgarden.wordpress.com/2012/09/02/heptacodium- jasminoides-the-bumble-bee-tree/ the flowers five-petalled, < 13 mm across.Stebbings, G. (2011). Autumn Glory - Late Developers. Garden Answers, p. 48, September 2011. Bauer Media, London. When the white corollas have fallen, the calyces develop into deep red expanded lobes which persist into November. The plant may be found in scrub, woodlands, and on the margins of broadleaved evergreen forests, often on cliffs, at altitudes of 600-1000 metres.Heptacodium miconioides Rehder - online article in the series 'Tree of the Year' by Grimshaw, John http://www.dendrology.org/publications/tree-of- the-year/heptacodium-miconioides-2012/ Retrieved 11.14 on 16/5/18 ==Six flowers, not seven== Noted plantsman John Grimshaw, director of the Yorkshire Arboretum, relayed the following observation of H. miconioides from distinguished botanist Allen J. Coombes, (formerly of the Hillier Gardens and currently coordinator of scientific collections at the University Botanic Garden Puebla, Mexico): > 'Seven' is actually misleading, for the flowers in each capitulum are held > in two rows of three clustered around a central bud, which is not a flower > bud but in fact a continuation of the inflorescence axis, which will push up > as the flowers fade and develop a new ring of six flowers, again around a > central bud. Three such iterations have been observed. ==Cultivation== Readily propagated from either seed or by softwood cuttings, the species has since become widely available in North America and Europe, and was stocked by 26 nurseries in the UK alone in 2011. H. miconioides is extremely hardy, and tolerant of temperatures as low as . It is also fast- growing, and can reach a height of in just five years; it is also very shade tolerant. All six of the first H. miconioides planted in the United States in 1980 at the Arnold Arboretum are still alive, indicating an expected lifespan greater than 40 years. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. ==Notable trees== In the UK, a specimen 8 m high (2012) planted in 1981 grows in the Flagpole Bed alongside Jermyn House at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens, Ampfield, near Romsey. ==Etymology== The generic name of Heptacodium has sometimes been said e.g. by the Missouri Botanical Garden http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=k450 Retrieved at 11.41 on 17/5/18 ( erroneously ) to mean 'seven bells' ( with a second element derived from Greek \u03ba\u03ce\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd ( codon ) - 'bell' ), but was in fact coined by Arnold Arboretum taxonomist Alfred Rehder from the Greek \u03ba\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac ( codeia ) - 'poppy head' with the prefix \u03ad\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac ( Hepta- ) 'seven', giving the meaning 'having seven structures resembling poppy heads'. The specific epithet miconioides alludes to the similarities of the plant ( particularly its boldly-veined leaves ) to certain species belonging to the unrelated genus Miconia ( family Melastomataceae ). The common name in Standard Chinese \u4e03\u5b50\u82b1 ( qi zi hu\u0101 ) is composed of the characters \u4e03 ( qi ) 'seven', \u5b50 ( zi ) 'son' / 'child' and \u82b1 ( hu\u0101 ) 'flower' - whence 'Seven Son(s) Flower' ( 'Flower with seven children' ). Approximate pronunciation ( not allowing for tonality of Chinese language ) 'Chyee-dzu-waa'.Google translate.
