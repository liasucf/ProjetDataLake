    "text": "Floored by Four is the debut album by experimental music band Floored by Four. The band consists of Mike Watt (Minutemen, fIREHOSE, The Stooges) on bass and vocals, Nels Cline (Wilco) on guitar, Yuka Honda (Cibo Matto) on keyboard, bass, and glockenspiel, and Dougie Bowne on drums. The album is divided into four tracks with each titled after a band member. All four were written by Watt. ==Track list== #Nels (Watt) #Miss Yuka (Watt) #Watt (Watt) #Dougie (Watt) ==Reception== The Wall Street Journal called the album \"New York avant- garde music down to its raw, improvisational core.\" Catherine Lewis of The Washington Post credited Watt's leadership for saving the album \"from being a scatterbrained, last-minute affair\" and found the track \"Yuka\" to be the standout of the album. John Payne of The Los Angeles Times called their work \"risk-taking, spontaneous and thought-provoking electric music\". Tal Rosenberg of Pitchfork was less impressed with the album saying \"it sounds like directionless and purposeless noodling.\" ==References== ==External links== *Floored by Four on Chimera Music Category:Nels Cline albums Category:Mike Watt albums Category:2010 albums ",
