    "text": "William Forbes (1806 \u2013 ) was a British Conservative politician. Forbes was elected Conservative MP for Stirlingshire at the 1835 general election. However, after winning the seat again at the 1837 general election, he was unseated on petition in favour of George Abercromby in 1838, after at least one vote had been wrongly ascribed to the wrong candidate. He later regained the seat, at the 1841 general election, and held it until his death in 1855. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Stirling constituencies Category:Scottish Tory MPs (pre-1912) Category:UK MPs 1835\u20131837 Category:UK MPs 1837\u20131841 Category:UK MPs 1841\u20131847 Category:UK MPs 1847\u20131852 Category:UK MPs 1852\u20131857 Category:1806 births Category:1855 deaths ",
