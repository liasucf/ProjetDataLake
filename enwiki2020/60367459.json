    "text": "\"Tourniquet\" is a song by American rock band Breaking Benjamin. It was their third single off of their album Ember. The band made a video for the single, completing a trilogy of videos for the singles from the album. ==Reception== The Daily Cardinal described the song as \"a welcome and natural progression from their earlier works, signaling a very promising future for a band that is now two decades old\" and that it features \"a driving bass heavy drum line, a beautiful blending of tones and a textbook example of Burnley's vocal prowess, it stands as a gem of modern hard rock\". In a fairly negative review, The Heights said: \"Flutters of electric guitar notes cut through the saturated quality of the song's heavy instrumentation, and the raspy screams of the chorus have a ringing, auto-tuned quality that give the song a much-needed, distinguishable melody.\" MTSU Sidelines said the band \"blend heavy intros and bridges with verses that build up to melodic choruses\" with this song. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
