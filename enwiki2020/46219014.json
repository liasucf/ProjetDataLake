One of the major issues they had with the script was that it explicitly included dialogue about the potential dangers of childbirth. == Reception == Mordaunt Hall, critic for The New York Times, wrote that Dr. Monica is \"not especially suspenseful\", but it \"moves apace and the acting is excellent.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by William Keighley Category:Films directed by William Dieterle Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1934 romantic drama films Category:Melodramas Category:1934 drama films Category:1934 films ",
