    "text": "Nicholas Robert Schnebelen (born September 30, 1978) is an American blues rock musician from Kansas City, Missouri, United States. He has toured with Buddahead and was an original member of Trampled Under Foot. Schnebelen became a solo artist in 2015, and released two live albums the following year. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer stated that Schnebelen offers \"[e]chos of the blues like Freddie King, Buddy Guy... Nick Schnebelen\u2019s world-class guitar playing leads the way.\" His latest album, Crazy All By Myself (2019), entered the US Billboard Blues Albums Chart at number 13. ==Background== Trampled Under Foot was an American soul blues and blues rock band. The original trio consisted of the siblings Danielle Schnebelen (lead vocals and bass), Nick Schnebelen (guitars and vocals) and Kris Schnebelen (drums and vocals). The band was the winner of the International Blues Challenge in 2008. Their 2013 album, Badlands, reached number one on the US Billboard Blues Albums Chart. At the 2014 Blues Music Awards, Badlands won the 'Contemporary Blues Album of the Year' category. The band was also nominated in the 'Band of the Year' category. Trampled Under Foot split up in 2015. ==Career== Schnebelen was born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. His father and mother were both professional musicians. Nick's father, Bob, played in a blues band, whilst his maternal grandmother was a jazz singer, who got to sing with Count Basie. Prior to that, the family's musical heritage dates back to violin players living in Eastern Europe. Schnebelen was educated at Kansas City's Paseo Academy, where he studied both classical music and jazz. In 1997, Schbnebelen moved to Philadelphia and formed a jam band, K-Floor, who played predominately blues music. He later toured for a while with Buddahead. In 2000, he joined his brother and sister as founder members of Trampled Under Foot. When they won the 2008 International Blues Challenge, Nick Schnebelen was granted the Albert King Award as the competition's best guitarist. After the band's demise Schnebelen became a solo artist, and released the first of two live albums in 2016, Live in Kansas City. The second of them, Live At Knuckleheads, Vol. 1, was issued in June 2016, and credited to the Nick Schnebelen Band. On the recording and subsequent promotional tour, Schnebelen shared lead vocal duties with Heather Newman. He continued to play live and attempted to create an amalgam of various blues styles. Schenebelen stated \"The old school, new school, even Delta. I bring a lot of different styles together.\" This all paved the way for the recording and release of Schenebelen's debut solo studio album, Crazy All By Myself. The recording was produced by Tony Braunagel, and guest artists on the collection included the harmonica player Jason Ricci, guitarist Davy Knowles, and pianist Mike Finnigan. The songwriting was done by Schenebelen with Gary Nicholson, Jeff Paris and Dave Duncan. Crazy All By Myself was released on March 1, 2019 via Vizztone and included 13 tracks. Musical backing on the recording was provided by Taj Mahal's Phantom Blues Band. Schnebelen started his most recent touring schedule in 2018, which encompassed North America and Europe, performing at music festivals, and the annual Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise. He also opened dates for George Thorogood. Schnebelen and his band are currently touring in the US. Mike Finnigan will join for West Coast dates later in 2019. ==Current band members== *Nick Schnebelen *Cliff Moore - bass guitar *Adam Hagerman - drums ==Discography== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !Year !!Title !!Label || US Billboard Blues Albums Chart |- !| 2016 | Live in Kansas City|| Vizztone Records || align=center|- |- !| 2016 | Live at Knuckleheads, Vol. 1|| Vizztone Records || align=center|- |- !| 2019 | Crazy All By Myself || Vizztone Records || align=center|13 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * *Discography at Discogs.com *Video of live performance *Vizztone profile of Schnebelen Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American blues singers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Blues rock musicians Category:Musicians from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Singers from Missouri Category:Guitarists from Missouri Category:Songwriters from Missouri ",
