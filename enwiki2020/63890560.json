    "text": "Anthony Luis Echemend\u00eda Ordu\u00f1a (born September 10, 1999) is a Cuban freestyle and folkstyle wrestler. In his native Cuba, Echemendia was a two-time Senior National medalist, a U23 National champion and a five-time Age-Group National champion (two titles as a junior and three as a cadet). Since his arrival to the US, he has won the Fargo Junior Nationals in both, freestyle and Greco- Roman and an AIA state title in folkstyle. He is an incoming freshman at 141 pounds for the Ohio State Buckeyes. == Early life and career in Cuba == Echemend\u00eda was born in Cabaig\u00faan in Cuba. He started training gymnastics when he was 4 years old but ended up leaving the sport at the age of 8, following his father and brother\u2019s steps to start wrestling instead. He attended and won his first Cadet National Tournament at the age of 12 in 2012 and won two more titles (13' and 14') before bumping up to the junior division. Despite a runner-up finish at the 15' Junior Nationals, Echemendia racked up the 16' title and in 2017 he placed at the Senior Nationals, won a U23 National title and also claimed his last age-group National championship. In 2018, he reached the finals of the Senior National Tournament and then while preparing for the Junior Nationals and Pan-Ams with the Cuban Junior Pan American team in Guatemala, Echemend\u00eda defected from Cuba, sneaking away from his coaches and teammates to cross Guatemala, Belize and Mexico and finally get to the United States late in the year. == Folkstyle == === High School === When Echemend\u00eda arrived to Tucson, Arizona in late 2018, he was able to attend Sunnyside High School as a senior for one semester with the help of one of his Cuban coaches' friend Fernando Villaescusa. He started competing in folkstyle shortly after the arrival and dominated on his way to a Division II state title at 152 pounds compiling an unbeaten record of 26 wins and no losses. He graduated as a 2018-19 student. === College === After he won the Freestyle Junior Nationals in 2019, a lot of Division I coaches started reaching him out. In September, he announced that he had committed to the Iowa State Cyclones. However, it was later reported that he hadn't signed an NLI and a whirlwind recruitment started after that. He then visited Ohio State University, Arizona State University and finally University of Iowa. He ended up officially committing to the Ohio State Buckeyes. ==== 2020-21 ==== Freshman: Echemend\u00eda is expected to compete at 141 pounds in this upcoming season. == Freestyle career == === Youth Level === ==== 2019 ==== In April, he competed at the junior level US Open at 65 kilograms. He defeated two opponents on points before injury defaulting out of the tournament. While it is not confirmed why he did so, Echemend\u00eda affirms that he was kicked out due to legal issues with his ID and that it had nothing to do with his health. A few weeks later, Echemend\u00eda participated and won the AZ freestyle tournament, which qualified him for the USA Wrestling Nationals (Fargo). In July, he completely dominated Fargo in both international styles at 145 pounds. In freestyle, he won by technical fall in his first five matches and won by points in the semis and finals, claiming the championship. In Greco-Roman, he teched everyone on his way to the quarterfinals, where he won by points and same in the semifinals. In the finals, he once again teched his opponent to crown himself as a National double-champion. This huge accomplishment made him a sensation across the United States. In October, he competed at 65 kilograms and faced three-time MSHSAA champion Josh Saunders at Who's Number One. He stopped Saunders with a 10-0 technical fall. == Junior freestyle record == ! colspan=\"7\"| Junior Freestyle results (doesn't include matches he had while in Cuba) |- ! Res. ! Record ! Opponent !
