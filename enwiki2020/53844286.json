(1971) degrees from Osaka University, and D. Sc. (1975) degree from Tohoku University. He was a research associate (1971\u20131982) and an associate professor (1982\u20131988) at Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, and a professor (1988\u20131997) at Faculty of Engineering, Nagoya University, and a professor (1997\u20132010) at Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University. After serving as a director of Advanced Science Research Center in Japan Atomic Energy Agency(2010-2018), he became a senior advisor at RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science from April 2018. His main research topics include theory of electronic properties in strongly correlated electron systems, in particular, high-temperature superconductors and orbital physics in transition metal oxides and theory of spintronics. == Professional Experience == {| class=\"wikitable\" |2018\u2013present |Senior Advisor, RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science |- |2018\u2013present |Visiting Chair Professor, Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences |- |2018\u2013present |President, Honda Memorial Foundation, |- |2010-2018 |Director, Advanced Science Research Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency |- |2010\u2013present |Professor Emeritus, Tohoku University |- |2006-2008 |Deputy Director, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University |- |1997-2010 |Professor, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University |- |1988-1997 |Professor, Department of Applied Physics, Nagoya University |- |1984-1988 |Associate Professor, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University |- |1971-1984 |Research Associate, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University |- |2009-2011 |Guest Distinguished Professor (Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea) |- |2004-2008 |Advisory Board: National Institute of Natural Sciences, Institute for Molecular Science |- |2004-2008 |Science Adviser, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research |- |2002-2004 |Advisory Board: Materials & Structure Laboratory, Tokyo Institute of Technology |- |2001\u2013present |Guest Distinguished Professor, Max Plank Institute at Halle |- |2000-2004 |Advisory Board: The Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo |- |1997-2001 |Visiting Professor, Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University |- |1996-1997 |Visiting Professor, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University |- |1992-1995 |Visiting Professor, Department of Physics, University of Tokyo |- |1989-1990 |Visiting Professor, Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University |- |1984 |Visiting Scientist, Institute fur Festkorperforschung, Julich |- |1978-1985 |Visiting Scientist (Summer Faculty Member), IBM Watson Research Center, New York |- |1975-1976 |Post Doctoral Fellow, IBM Watson Research Center, New York |} == Awards == 2018 Highly Cited Researchers2018 2013 Honoris Causa Doctorate of University of Zaragoza, Spain 2012 Honorary Member of the Magnetic Society of Japan 2012 IUPAP Magnetism Award and N\u00e9el Medal 2008 the title of Distinguished Professor, Tohoku University 2008 Fellow of the American Physical Society 2005 the title of Honda Professor, Tohoku University 2003 Magnetics Society of Japan Award 2001 Humboldt Award (Germany) 1999 Fellow of Institute of Physics (UK) == References == Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American Physical Society Category:Japanese physicists Category:Living people Category:Date of death missing Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
