In 2016, following his Ulster minor title with Donegal, he became the eighth student from the school to win an Ulster Colleges All Star, succeeding \u2014 among others \u2014 Michael Murphy and Shaun Patton; O'Donnell played alongside Patton in the school team. ==Playing career== ===Club=== O'Donnell has captained his club at under-21 level.

He played against Kerry as a half-time substitute in the opening fixture of the 2018 National Football League at Fitzgerald Stadium.
