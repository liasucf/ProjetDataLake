    "text": "The quarry pond named after a former owner R\u00f6hmsee is a nature conservation area, designated by decree of the Regional Council Stuttgart of 16 November 1981, under the name Am Rank (R\u00f6hmsee) on the territory of the municipality Unterensingen in District Esslingen in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Together with the Sch\u00fclesee, the 13 hectare R\u00f6hmsee forms a protected area of about 25 hectares. The lakes are a supra-regionally important ecological compensation area with well-developed siltation zones. Lake R\u00f6hmsee is important as a resting place for migrating birds and as a refuge for endangered bird species. As the oldest quarry pond still existing in the Neckar river system, it has developed into an important breeding water for birds. Among others, the bittern, the marsh warbler, the coot and the moorhen breed here. The Unterensingen quarry ponds occupy an excellent position as a transit and resting area. In the meantime, 223 species have been recorded in this relatively small area. The area belongs to the Naturraum Filder in the Swabian Keuper-Lias-Land. == See also == * List of nature conservation areas in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg * List of nature reserves in the district of Esslingen == External links == * Category:Nature reserves in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Esslingen (district) Category:1981 establishments in Germany ",
