It is run at York over a distance of 1 mile 5 furlongs and 188 yards (2,787 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July. Prior to 2016 it was run as a handicap race and before 2018 it was also open to three-year-olds. In 2018 it was upgraded to Group 3 status and restricted to four-year-olds and up as part of the European Pattern Committee's commitment to improving the race programme for stayers in Europe. ==Records== Leading jockey (4 wins): *Kieren Fallon \u2013 Benatom (1997), Distinction (2004), Lost Soldier Three (2005), Mount Athos (2012) Leading trainer (3 wins): *Henry Cecil \u2013 Great Marquess (1991), Benatom (1997), Eminence Grise (2000) * Luca Cumani \u2013 Saxon Maid (1995), Lost Soldier Three (2005), Mount Athos (2012) ==Winners== ===John Smith's Silver Cup Handicap=== * Weights given in stones and pounds. {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:40px\" | Weight ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 1991 | Great Marquess | 4 | 9-08 | Paul Eddery | Henry Cecil | 3:25.75 |- | 1992 | Tyrone Bridge | 6 | 9-06 | Michael Roberts | Martin Pipe | 3:31.54 |- | 1993 | Brandon Prince | 5 | 8-07 | Frankie Dettori | Ian Balding | 3:24.18 |- | 1994 | Castle Courageous | 7 | 9-05 | John Reid | Lady Herries | 2:55.31 |- | 1995 | Saxon Maid | 4 | 9-05 | Jimmy Fortune | Luca Cumani | 2:55.70 |- | 1996 | Celeric | 4 | 9-07 | Willie Carson | David Morley | 2:57.09 |- | 1997 | Benatom | 4 | 8-07 | Kieren Fallon | Henry Cecil | 2:56.37 |- | 1998 | Sheer Danzig | 6 | 9-07 | Richard Hills | Robert Armstrong | 2:53.46 |- | 1999 | Rainbow Ways | 4 | 8-12 | Michael Hills | Barry Hills | 2:54.17 |- | 2000 | Eminence Grise | 5 | 9-00 | Richard Quinn | Henry Cecil | 2:58.80 |- | 2001 | Akbar | 5 | 9-07 | Kevin Darley | Mark Johnston | 2:58.23 |- | 2002 | Maycocks Bay | 4 | 8-07 | Seb Sanders | Michael Bell | 2:56.12 |- | 2003 | Hugs Dancer | 7 | 9-00 | Dean McKeown | James Given | 2:53.51 |- | 2004 | Distinction | 5 | 9-07 | Kieren Fallon | Michael Stoute | 2:58.44 |- | 2005 | Lost Soldier Three | 4 | 9-08 | Kieren Fallon | Luca Cumani | 3:00.61 |- | 2006 | Linas Selection | 3 | 8-10 | Kevin Darley | Mark Johnston | 2:57.57 |- | 2007 | Wing Collar | 6 | 9-02 | Paul Mulrennan | Tim Easterby | 3:08.04 |- | 2008 | Yellowstone | 4 | 9-09 | John Egan | Jane Chapple-Hyam | 3:07.94 |- | 2009 | Hits Only Vic | 5 | 9-00 | D Nolan | D Carroll | 2:56.37 |- | 2010 | Free Agent | 4 | 9-01 | Ryan Moore | Richard Hannon Sr. | 2:59.89 |- | 2011 | Tactician | 4 | 9-05 | Eddie Ahern | Michael Bell | 2:59.49 |- | 2012 | Mount Athos | 5 | 10-00 | Kieren Fallon | Luca Cumani | 3:02.15 |- | 2013 | Sun Central | 4 | 9-05 | Seb Sanders | William Haggas | 2:56.68 |- | 2014 | Continuum | 5 | 9-06 | Joe Fanning | Peter Hedger | 2:59.52 |- | 2015 | Astronereus | 4 | 9-11 | Pat Dobbs | Amanda Perrett | 3:00.18 |} ===John Smith's Silver Cup Stakes=== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 2016 | Pamona | 4 | Jim Crowley | Ralph Beckett | 2:57.91 |- | 2017 | Rare Rhythm | 5 | James Doyle | Charlie Appleby | 3:00.79 |- | 2018 | Dylan Mouth | 7 | Dane O'Neill | Marco Botti | 3:01.26 |- | 2019 | Red Verdon | 6 | David Allan | Ed Dunlop | 2:58.60 |- | 2020 | Eagles by Day | 4 | Daniel Tudhope | David O\u2019Meara | 3:03.39 |} ==See also== *Horse racing in Great Britain *List of British flat horse races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , , , *ifhaonline.org International Federation of Horseracing Authorities \u2013 John Smith's Silver Cup Stakes (2019).
