The series stars Don Lake, Christian Convery, Aria Birch, Gabrielle Miller, Riley O'Donnell, Chance Hurstfield, Dylan Schombing, and Brian George. == Premise == Charlie is a man who has established a secret academy for puppies in a parallel world where they are educated on how to become dogs. His grandson Morgan moves into his neighborhood and he enlists him to help educate the puppies, Spark, Corazon, and Whiz at the time when the bond between human and canine that is powered by the Canis Primus constellation starts to fade. This ties in to a prophecy involving a boy and a stray puppy in which the Dean of Graduates (or D.O.G. for short) has to find that special stray, save Pup Academy, and restore the bond between humans and canines. == Cast and characters == * Don Lake as Charlie, the founder of Pup Academy. * Christian Convery as Morgan, the grandson of Charlie who helps out at Pup Academy. * Aria Birch as Izzy, a girl who Morgan befriends. * Gabrielle Miller as Molly, Morgan's mother * Riley O'Donnell as the voice of Spark, a street-smart stray Boxer. * Chance Hurstfield as the voice of Corazon, a goofy Golden Retriever who is owned by Izzy. * Dylan Schombing as the voice of Whiz, a nervous and clever sheepdog who is owned by James. * Brian George as the voice of D.O.G., a Pup Academy Siberian Husky dean who looks for the stray of the prophecy. == Production == On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Disney and Netflix ordered Pup Academy, with a feature-length pilot, as well as 22 regular episodes. Serving as Air Bud Entertainment's debut television series on Disney Channel, the series is executive produced by Anna McRoberts and Robert Vince and directed by Robert Vince. On July 31, 2019, it was announced that the series would premiere on August 26, 2019; following the premiere, new episodes of the series resumed on September 4, 2019.
