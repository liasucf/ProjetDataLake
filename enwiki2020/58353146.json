After having coached every youth team of Benfica from 2004 to 2012 and more recently having been an assistant coach to Carlos Carvalhal at Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City, Lage returned to Benfica as manager of their reserve team in July 2018 to replace H\u00e9lder Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o. During Benfica's 2018\u201319 season, Lage took charge of the club's first-team as caretaker manager, replacing Rui Vit\u00f3ria on 3 January 2019. Lage managed his first Primeira Liga game in a 4\u20132 home win over Rio Ave on 6 January and was appointed permanent head coach eight days later. On 10 February, after winning two consecutive Lisbon derbies \u2013 including a 4\u20132 away win in the league \u2013 he led Benfica to the biggest Primeira Liga margin of victory since 1964 and to the league's highest scoring win since 1965, a 10\u20130 thrashing of Nacional, setting the record for the biggest win at the new Est\u00e1dio da Luz. In his UEFA Europa League debut, Benfica won in Turkey for the first time in their history, beating Galatasaray 2\u20131 in the first leg of the round of 32. As Benfica won 2\u20131 away in The Classic on 2 March 2019, Lage equalled Rui Vit\u00f3ria's 3 wins out of 16 matches against rivals Sporting and Porto. From matchday 16 to 34, Lage went on winning 18 league matches and drawing 1 to conquer his first major trophy, Benfica's 37th league title. With a 94% winning percentage, he surpassed Jimmy Hagan's record at Benfica and achieved Primeira Liga's all-time best second round: 49 points. In addition, he equalled Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's 1990\u201391 feat of beating Porto, Sporting, and Braga away in the same season. Lage also equalled Benfica's league scoring record of 103 goals in 1963\u201364. Lage then started a second season at Benfica with a 5\u20130 thrashing of Sporting CP in the Super Cup. On 17 September, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 2\u20131 home defeat to German side RB Leipzig, increasing Benfica's losses in the competition to 11 in the latest 14 matches. On 29 June 2020, Lage made his position available after equalizing Benfica's worst ever series of results \u2013 2 wins in 13 matches in the 2000\u201301 season \u2013 and establishing a record of 5 consecutive matches without a win at Est\u00e1dio da Luz, which included defeats to Braga and Santa Clara.https://www.abola.pt/nnh/2020-06-23/benfica-pior-serie-de-resultados-da- historia-em-jogos-na-luz/850520 He was replaced by his assistant coach N\u00e9lson Ver\u00edssimo on 30 June and had his contract terminated on 4 July.https://www.abola.pt/clubes/2020-06-30/benfica-nelson-verissimo-orientou- treino/851460/40https://www.slbenfica.pt/pt- pt/agora/noticias/2020/07/04/futebol-sad-benfica-informacao-cmvm-rescisao- contrato-trabalho-bruno-lage ==Personal life== Lage's son, Jaime (born April 2015), is named after Jaime Gra\u00e7a, Lage's biggest reference in football, as a mentor.
