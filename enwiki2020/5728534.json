    "text": "William Edwin Boardman (1810\u20131886) was an American pastor and teacher, and the author in 1858 of The Higher Christian Life, a book which as a major international success and helped ignite the Higher Life movement. Boardman's work attracted international attention, especially in England, where Boardman exercised great influence during 1873\u20131874. He was born in 1810 to Isaac Smith and Abigail Saltmarsh Boardman. In his youth he had religious training and had a knowledge of the gospel. He married Mary Adams in 1837, and she grew closer to god in their marriage. His ministry would continue until his death on the 4th of February 1886 in London. Dwight L. Moody and Ira Sankey had major led evangelistic campaigns and Boardman was speaking throughout England on Holiness and the Higher Life. This led to the establishing of the Keswick Conventions. Boardman also came to be a leader in the ministry of spiritual healing, and established Bethshan Healing Home in London. He joined with the Canadian pastor A.B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance in the 1885 Bethshan Conference on Holiness and Healing in London. This conference is regarded by many as a turning point in the origins of the modern Pentecostal movement. ==Works== *The Higher Christian Life, Boston: Henry Hoyt (1858) *He That Overcomenth: or the Conquering Gospel, London: James Nisbet & Co.
