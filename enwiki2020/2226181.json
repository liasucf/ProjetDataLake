He is the author of a calligraphic rendering of the Greatest Name, used by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world. == Background == thumb Mishk\u00edn-Qalam was born in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z but was a resident of Isfah\u00e1n, which is where he first heard of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. A few years later he travelled to Baghdad and learned in more detail from Zaynu'l-Muqarrab\u00edn and Nab\u00edl-i-A\u02bbzam, but was not confirmed until he later travelled to Adrianople and met Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Before becoming a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, he was a S\u00faf\u00ed of the Ni'matu'll\u00e1h\u00ed order. He was also a skilled astronomer. == Imprisonment == Mishk\u00edn-Qalam was sent by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h to Constantinople (Istanbul), where he began attracting people through his art and vigorously teaching the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. The Persian ambassador began to complain to the Sultan's vazirs and soon had him arrested. When Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was exiled to \u02bbAkk\u00e1, Mishk\u00edn-Qalam was exiled to Cyprus with the followers of Subh-i-Azal, where he remained a prisoner in Famagusta from 1868 to 1877. Cyprus eventually left Ottoman control and Mishk\u00edn-Qalam was released. He made his way to \u02bbAkk\u00e1 in 1886, and remained there until Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h died in 1892, after which he travelled to Egypt, Damascus and India. He remained in India until 1905, and then returned to Haifa until his death in 1912. == Calligraphy == Mishk\u00edn-Qalam was a renowned calligrapher. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 called him a second M\u00edr \u02bbIm\u00e1d, a 16th-century calligrapher of the Safavid dynasty who is perhaps the most celebrated Persian calligrapher. Mishk\u00edn-Qalam enjoyed a special position among the court ministers of Tihr\u00e1n, and he became widely known for being adept at every calligraphic style. When E.G. Browne was in Persia, he was told that Mishk\u00edn-Qalam's works :\"would be eagerly sought after by Persians of all classes, were it not that they all bore, as the signature of the penman, the following verse: ::Lord of calligraphy, my banner goes before; ::But to Baha'u'llah, a bondsman at the door, ::Naught else I am, Mishk\u00edn-Qalam. When visiting Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in Adrianople, he would often write out the phrase Y\u00e1 Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'l-Abh\u00e1 (O Glory of the All-Glorious) in many different forms, some taking the form of a bird, and send them everywhere. One of his renderings of this phrase is now one of the three common symbols of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, known as the Greatest Name. == Gallery == File:Mishkin-Qalam-01.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-10.JPG File:Mishkin- Qalam-15.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-87.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-40.JPG File:Mishkin- Qalam-23.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-83.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-21.JPG == See also == *Persian calligraphy == Notes == == References == * * * == External links == * ICOM: The Conservation and Restoration of a 19th-century Calligraphy of a Baha'i Writing in Arabic, by S.
