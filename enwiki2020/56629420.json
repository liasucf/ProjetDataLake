    "text": "Thomas Martinetz (born 2 January 1962 in Nettesheim) is a German physicist and neuro-informatic. == Life == Thomas Martinetz studied mathematics and physics at the Technical University of Munich, where he earned his doctorate in theoretical biophysics after several years as a guest at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After working in the central research and development department of Siemens AG, in 1996 he moved to a professorship at the Institute for Neuroinformatics of the Ruhr University Bochum and took over the management of the Center for Neuroinformatics GmbH. In 1999 he accepted a call to the University of L\u00fcbeck as director of the Institute for Neuro- and Bioinformatics. From 2006 to 2008 he was Vice-Rector of the University of L\u00fcbeck, and from 2008 to 2011 Vice-President for Research and Technology Transfer. Since 2013 he is chairman of the Senate of the University of L\u00fcbeck. His major contribution in the field of neuroinformatics is the so-called Neural gas, a variant of self-organizing maps. He is co-founder of the software companies Consideo, the Pattern Recognition Company and gestigon. == Awards == The Center for Neuroinformatics GmbH, whose management he took over in 1996, was awarded in the same year with the Innovation Award of the German economy. awarded him as a \"courageous entrepreneur\", and in 2011 he received the transfer award of the Innovation Foundation Schleswig-Holstein. == Publications == * * T.
