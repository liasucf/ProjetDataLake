France-Amerique first newspaper, May 23, 1943. Charles de Gaulle wishes good luck to France-Am\u00e9rique. This telegram is shown on the first page. ==History== France-Am\u00e9rique was created in 1943 by French exiles in New York City to raise awareness about Occupied France in the United States, and to support the Resistance movement led by Charles de Gaulle. In the 1960s, it became the property of the French daily, Le Figaro,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/magazine/they-find-us- formidable.html as a weekly international edition, and became the newspaper of reference for the French community in the United States. In 2007, France- Am\u00e9rique adopted a bi-monthly format when it merged with the monthly newspaper Journal Fran\u00e7ais, which was then the largest French-language publication in the United States. France-Am\u00e9rique became monthly and adopted a magazine format in May 2008. The magazine was purchased by French-American author and publisher Guy Sorman in June 2013 and adopted the monthly magazine style it has today. In May 2015, France-Am\u00e9rique eventually merged with France Magazine, a monthly English-language publication launched in 1985 by the French Embassy in Washington to promote French culture and l'art de vivre among Americans who loved France, but did not necessarily speak its language. France-Am\u00e9rique has been published in French and in English ever since. ==See also== * List of French-language newspapers published in the United States ==References== ==External links== * France-Am\u00e9rique official website Category:Publications established in 1943 Category:French-language newspapers published in the United States Category:Newspapers published in New York City ",
