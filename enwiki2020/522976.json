    "text": "Jean Baptiste Alphonse D\u00e9chauffour de Boisduval (24 June 1799 \u2013 30 December 1879) was a French lepidopterist, botanist, and physician. He was one of the most celebrated lepidopterists of France, and was the co-founder of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 entomologique de France. While best known abroad for his work in entomology, he started his career in botany, collecting a great number of French plant specimens and writing broadly on the topic throughout his career, including the textbook Flores fran\u00e7aise in 1828. Early in his career, he was interested in Coleoptera and allied himself with both Jean Th\u00e9odore Lacordaire and Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille. He was the curator of the Pierre Fran\u00e7oise Marie Auguste Dejean collection in Paris and described many species of beetles, as well as butterflies and moths, resulting from the voyages of the Astrolabe, the expedition ship of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de La P\u00e9rouse and the Coquille, that of Louis Isidore Duperrey. He left Paris, where he had lived for nearly 60 years, in 1875, to retire in Ticheville near his family. His brother was Adolphe-Armand d'Echauffour de Boisduval (September 26, 1801 \u2013 March 1, 1842), a doctor, naturalist, and health officer in their native Ticheville. Boisduval's Elateridae are in the Natural History Museum, London and the types of Curculionidae in Brussels Natural History Museum. His Lepidoptera were sold to Charles Oberth\u00fcr. The Sphingidae are in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ==Works== Species G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des L\u00e9pidopt\u00e9res plate 17 *Jean Baptiste Alphonse D\u00e9chauffour Boisduval and John Eatton Le Conte, 1829-1837 Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et iconographie des lepidopt\u00e9r\u00e8s et des chenilles de l\u2019Amerique septentrionale (in English, General history and illustrations of the Lepidoptera and caterpillars of Northern America) published in Paris.
