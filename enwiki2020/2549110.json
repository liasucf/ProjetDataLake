    "text": "The Crain Communications Building is a 39-story, 582 foot (177 m) skyscraper located at 150 North Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago, Illinois. It was also known as the Smurfit\u2013Stone Building and the Stone Container Building. The original name of the building was actually Associates Center, named after the initial tenant of the building, the Associates Commercial Corp.J. Linn Allen. \"Not that Stone Container Building, this one-got it?\" Chicago Tribune. February 23, 1993. 1. Construction of the building began in 1983 and was completed in 1984. The building, noted for its unusually slanted facade, was designed by Sheldon Schlegman of A. Epstein and Sons. It has 39 floors of tenant space and the two spires at the top cover the main roof and serve as mechanical rooms for HVAC equipment. ==History== Although the building looks as though it is split down the middle, the two sides are only slightly disjointed until nearing the top, where there is a gap between them. At times, its slanted roof\u2014which has been likened to a skyscraper pared with a knife\u2014displays local sports slogans on its face, such as \"GO BEARS\" and \"GO SOX\". It also displayed \"VOTE 2008\" during the 2008 election day rally at Grant Park. At the time of its construction, the Associates Center was considered to be a smart building, with sophisticated environmental and security controls. Three years after its completion, the building played a role in the Touchstone Pictures film Adventures in Babysitting. The building is also modeled in EA's SimCity 4, as well as being destroyed in the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon and in the videogame Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2. The building name was changed to the Crain Communications Building in March 2012, after Crain Communications moved its headquarters there. The building is popularly referred to as the Diamond Building or the Vagina Building (from the locally popular but apocryphal story that, with its prominent vertical slit up the front, the building was designed to be a yonic counter to the phallicism of most skyscrapers). ==Tenants== *Crain Communications * Consulate General of Sweden Chicago *Wells Fargo: Insurance Services *United Airlines: previously maintained a ticketing office in this building.\"Information on United Flights 93 and 175 United City Ticket Offices .\" United Airlines.
