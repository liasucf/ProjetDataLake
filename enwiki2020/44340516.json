His mother was Mehlika Sultan, a Russian lady. On Osman's way back he had received the news that he had a son born Now as a father, he had a successor and posed a threat against his brothers. He called her to Edirne where the two met and Osman had the chance to see his son, \u00d6mer. To celebrate the auspicious moment and possibly to impress her, he ordered a three day festivity to be held, to celebrate his return from the campaign as well as the recent birth of his son. ==Death== In the celebrations, imitation of the battle scenes was a part of the show. Yet the unimaginable happened and the baby suddenly died on 5 February 1622, under most unexpected circumstances. According to the Venetian bailo, when Osman and Mehlika, together with their son and other female members of the dynasty, were watching a re-enactment of the sultan\u2019s Polish campaign organized as a big show at the palace, one of the acemio\u011flans playing the role of a Polish soldier discharged his gun and caused a ricochet. His stray bullet found and killed Prince \u00d6mer instantly. This was a great trauma for Osman. He was not only devastated, but started to display a more brutal character. It is reported that, during first three days after he lost his son, the sultan did not speak a word and remained aloof from the public while contemplating in deep grief. Some history writers explain this event by the shock the infant had due to noises of the fired cannons. Hammer gives a more striking reason for the baby's death: \"To increase her joy festivities were held and some scenes of the Polish war were staged. The prince was present in these games and by the sudden shot from a rifle [by coincidence] he was wounded and died.\" Upon this tragic loss, Osman frequently travelled incognito in the streets of the capital and punished many wrongdoers, including several Janissary officers and common people. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:17th-century Ottoman royalty Category:1621 births Category:1622 deaths ",
