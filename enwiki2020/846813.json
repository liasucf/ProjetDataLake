She won the gold medal for javelin at the 1952 Summer Olympics (only an hour after her husband, Emil Z\u00e1topek, won the 5,000 m), and the silver medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics. She was the European champion in 1954 and 1958. She also set a world record in 1958 (55.73 m) when she was 35, making her the oldest woman to break one in an outdoor athletics event. Z\u00e1topkov\u00e1 and her husband were the witnesses at the wedding ceremony of Olympic gold medalists Olga Fikotov\u00e1 and Harold Connolly in Prague in 1957. Emil spoke to the Czechoslovak president Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd to request help in Olga getting a permit to marry Connolly. While it is not clear how much this helped, they did receive a permit a few days later. ==Achievements== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |1948 |Olympic Games |London, United Kingdom |align=\"center\" | 7th |39.94 m |- |1950 |European Championships |Brussels, Belgium |align=\"center\" | 5th |41.34 m |- |1952 |Olympic Games |Helsinki, Finland |bgcolor=\"gold\" align=\"center\" | 1st |50.47 m |- |1954 |European Championships |Bern, Switzerland |bgcolor=\"gold\" align=\"center\" | 1st |52.91 m |- |1956 |Olympic Games |Melbourne, Australia |align=\"center\" | 4th |49.83 m |- |1958 |European Championships |Stockholm, Sweden |bgcolor=\"gold\" align=\"center\" | 1st |56.02 m |- |1960 |Olympic Games |Rome, Italy |bgcolor=\"silver\" align=\"center\" | 2nd |53.78 m |- |} == References == * Biography at zivotopisyonline.cz ==External links== * * * Category:1922 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Karvin\u00e1 Category:Czechoslovak female javelin throwers Category:Czech female javelin throwers Category:Olympic athletes of Czechoslovakia Category:Olympic silver medalists for Czechoslovakia Category:Olympic gold medalists for Czechoslovakia Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:Recipients of Medal of Merit (Czech Republic) Category:Medalists at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
