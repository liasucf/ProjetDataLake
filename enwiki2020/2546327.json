    "text": "The Punkles were a German band performing songs by The Beatles in punk style. They formed in 1998 in Hamburg, Germany, and was a side project of Prollhead!. After a lot of touring around Europe they toured together with Beatallica in October 2005 and in Spring 2006. Unlike Beatallica they performed the Beatles songs \"as they are\", singing the same lyrics and playing cover versions of the originals, just a \"little\" faster and with a punk feeling. They were quite successful in Europe, as well as in Japan, where their best of CD The Punkles 1998-2003 (2003), and the following album, Pistol (2004), both entered the Top 50. Their final album For Sale! was released in April 2006. They have not appeared in public since. ==Band members== {| class=\"toccolours\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 style=\"width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border- collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | 1998-2002 | *Joey Lennon \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Dee Dee Harrison \u2013 lead guitar, vocals *Sid McCartney \u2013 bass guitar *Markey Starkey \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals |- ! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | 2002-2004 | *Joey Lennon \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Captain \u2018O Harrison \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals *Sid McCartney \u2013 bass buitar *Markey Starkey \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals |- ! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | 2004 | *Joey Lennon \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Stiff Harrison \u2013 lead guitar, vocals *Sid McCartney \u2013 Bass Guitar *Markey Starkey \u2013 Drums, Percussion, Vocals |- ! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | 2004-2006 | *Joey Lennon \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Rat Harrison \u2013 lead guitar, vocals *Sid McCartney \u2013 bass guitar *Markey Starkey \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals |} ==Albums== * The Punkles (1998 - Wolverine Records) The cover is a tribute to the album Black and White by The Stranglers. * Punk!
