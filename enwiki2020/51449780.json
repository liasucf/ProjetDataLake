The house is made of narra and yakal wood, designed in Victorian style with its wooden planks and gables and steep roof. The clan heads, Roberto and Victorina Laperal made the house as their vacation home. During World War II, the house was occupied by Japanese soldiers and was used as a garrison. The troops reportedly raped women, tortured and killed suspected spies working for the United States and their allies. The house transferred ownership after the death of the head of the Laperal clan. It was adequately maintained but despite being closed to the public over the years, it did not stop the persistent rumors of the unearthly sightings spotted near the house. The house withstood many natural and man-made casualties, such as the deadly earthquake in 1990 and many more. Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon Lucio Tan purchased the property in 2007 but never stayed in the place during some of his trips to Baguio. He instead had it renovated and refurbished with proper maintenance then made it into a tourist attraction. From then on, the house was opened to public. In 2013, the tycoon's Tan Yan Kee Foundation transformed the house to a Bamboo Foundation museum where Filipino artworks based on bamboo and wood. ==In popular culture== According to believers, the house is haunted. The house has been featured on television, especially during Halloween, by TV5, GMA, the ABS-CBN programme Magandang Gabi, Bayan, and i-Witness news. The 2010 horror movie White House featured the house. ==Photo gallery== File:Laperal House Master's Bedroom.JPG|Master's bedroom of Laperal House File:Laperal House Foyer.JPG|Foyer of the Laperal House File:Laperal House Stairs.JPG|2nd Floor Staircase of Laperal House ==See also== * List of reportedly haunted locations in the Philippines * Diplomat Hotel ==References== Category:Reportedly haunted locations in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Baguio Category:Historic house museums in the Philippines ",
