Holtreman is a spelling version of the Oultreman family name.Biographie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Depuis Les Temps Les Plus Recul\u00e9s - Tome Trente- Septi\u00e8me The Holtreman name was adopted in Portugal by an Oultreman\u2019s family branch originally from Valenciennes. In the early 17th century, a knight called Jean (John) Houltremant (or d\u2019Oultreman) served the Count of Vila Real in the reign of Philip III of Portugal (Philip IV of Spain). Jean Houltremant descended from an old lineage from the County of Flanders and the County of Hainaut being a grandson of Jacques d\u2019Oultreman dit Houltreman, adviser of his majesty at Namur. Jean married Ana Ant\u00f3nia Nunes, daughter of Manuel Nunes and wife Ana Nunes, landowners of the Anadia region in Portugal. After the Portuguese Restoration War, Jean descendency is believed to have adopted his wife's family name of Nunes, and moved to Pousaflores into his wife's family lands. The Holtremant name was later recovered in the 18th century by Bartolomeu Nunes Holtremant, Knight of the Order of Christ and by his cousin - and godson - Manuel Ribeiro Holtremant, Knight of the Order of Saint James. Due to Portuguese pronunciation, all their descendants have adopted the Holtreman spelling. In Portugal, the family is better known because of the foundation of Sporting Clube de Portugal (often erroneously known as \"Sporting Lisbon\"). The d'Oultreman family obtained several recognition of nobility from both the Habsburgs's Austrian and Spanish branches, and from Charles I of Portugal. In the County of Flanders and the County of Hainaut, both Flemish and French were spoken across both counties, explaining why the name suffered minor spelling changes depending on where the family member lived or was born. The most commons are Oultreman (or Houltreman) and Oultremant (or Houltremant). The family descends from the Knight known as the Oultreman of Ghent (or Woutreman van Ghent, in Dutch) \u2013 the family origins in Ghent are well documented.
