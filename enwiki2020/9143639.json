    "text": "The Peterborough Panthers are a British speedway team based in Peterborough, England. They were the Elite League champions in 1999 and 2006, and they have won the Premier League Four-Team Championship on five occasions. ==History== On 24 November 2010 following changes to the rules for rider averages made at the Annual General Meeting of the BSPA, the Peterborough Panthers and Coventry Bees walked out of the meeting. As a result, on 27 November 2010 the BSPA omitted both teams from the 2011 Elite League for failing to declare their intent to compete in the 2011 league at the AGM. The decision was the subject of a legal challenge by both clubs. On 17 February 2011, it was announced by the BSPA that both Coventry and Peterborough would not be competing in the 2011 Speedway Elite League. Both clubs rejected an offer from the BSPA issued on 31 January 2011, which would have permitted both clubs to continue with their proposed legal action (including claims for compensation from any losses) whilst resuming their league membership with immediate effect. On 15 March 2011 it was announced that both the Coventry Bees and Peterborough Panthers would be part of the 2011 Elite League season. However this was not officially confirmed by the BSPA despite announcements by Peterborough and Coventry bees co-promoter, Allen Trump. On 8 April 2011, the BSPA officially confirmed both teams had returned to the Elite League for the 2011 season. The team had a record Elite League victory on 23 August 2013, beating Coventry Bees by 70 points to 20.\"Panthers Power to Record Win\", speedwaygb.co, 24 August 2013.
