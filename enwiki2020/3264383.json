Broadly, there are four principal traditions within libertarianism, namely the libertarianism that developed in the mid-20th century out of the revival tradition of classical liberalism in the United States after liberalism associated to the New Deal; the libertarianism developed in the 1950s by anarcho-capitalist author Murray Rothbard, who based it on the anti-New Deal Old Right and 19th-century libertarianism and American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner while rejecting the labor theory of value in favor of Austrian School economics and the subjective theory of value; the libertarianism developed in the 1970s by Robert Nozick and founded in American and European classical liberal traditions;Van der Vossen, Bas (January 28, 2019). \"Libertarianism\".

In Honderich, Ted. The Oxford Companion to Philosophy. New York City: Oxford University Press. p. 516. . \"'Left- libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George. Recent exponents include Philippe Van Parijs and Hillel Steiner.\" It is also related to anti-capitalist, free-market anarchist strands such as left-wing market anarchism,Chartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W.

Murray Bookchin, a libertarian within this socialist tradition, argued that anarchists, libertarian socialists and the left should reclaim libertarian as a term, suggesting these other self- declared libertarians to rename themselves propertarians instead. Although all libertarians oppose government intervention, there is a division between those anarchist or socialist libertarians as well as anarcho-capitalists such as Rothbard and David D.

However, a 2014 Pew Poll found that 23% of Americans who identify as libertarians have little understanding of libertarianism.Kiley, Jocelyn (25 August 2014). \"In Search of Libertarians\". Pew Research Center. \"14% say the term libertarian describes them well; 77% of those know the definition (11% of total), while 23% do not (3% of total).\" Yellow, a political color associated with liberalism worldwide, has also been used as a political color for modern libertarianism in the United States. The Gadsden flag, a symbol first used by American revolutionaries, is frequently used by libertarians and the libertarian-leaning Tea Party movement. Although libertarian continues to be widely used to refer to anti-state socialists internationally,Bookchin, Murray (January 1986). \"The Greening of Politics: Toward a New Kind of Political Practice\".

We have even permitted these reactionaries to stake out a claim to the word libertarian, a word, in fact, that was literally devised in the 1890s in France by Elis\u00e9e Reclus as a substitute for the word anarchist, which the government had rendered an illegal expression for identifying one's views. The propertarians, in effect \u2013 acolytes of Ayn Rand, the earth mother of greed, egotism, and the virtues of property \u2013 have appropriated expressions and traditions that should have been expressed by radicals but were willfully neglected because of the lure of European and Asian traditions of socialism, socialisms that are now entering into decline in the very countries in which they originated\". its meaning in the United States has deviated from its political origins to the extent that the common meaning of libertarian in the United States is different from elsewhere.Goodway, David (2006).

The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Rothbard and Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition\".The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective (11 December 2008). \"150 years of Libertarian\".

They advocate a much smaller government; one that is limited to protecting individuals from coercion and violence. Libertarians tend to embrace individual responsibility, oppose government bureaucracy and taxes, promote private charity, tolerate diverse lifestyles, support the free market, and defend civil liberties\". == Definition == Since the 19th century, the term libertarian has referred to advocates for freedom of the will, or anyone who generally advocated for liberty, but its long association with anarchism extends at least as far back as 1858, when it was used for the title of New York anarchist journal Le Libertaire. In the late 19th century around the 1880s and 1890s, Anarchist S\u00e9bastien Faure used the term libertarian to differentiate between anarchists and authoritarian socialists. While the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism, its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups. As a term, libertarian can include both the New Left and libertarian Marxists (who do not associate with a vanguard party) as well as extreme liberals (primarily concerned with civil liberties). Additionally, some anarchists use the term libertarian socialist to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasize its connections with socialism.Gu\u00e9rin, Daniel (1970). Anarchism: From Theory to Practice. New York City: Monthly Review Press. p. 12. \"[A]narchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.\" . The revival of free-market ideologies during the mid- to-late 20th century came with disagreement over what to call the movement. While many of its adherents prefer the term libertarian, many conservative libertarians reject the term's association with the 1960s New Left and its connotations of libertine hedonism. The movement is divided over the use of conservatism as an alternative. Those who seek both economic and social liberty within a capitalist order would be known as liberals, but that term developed associations opposite of the limited government, low-taxation, minimal state advocated by the movement. Name variants of the free-market revival movement include classical liberalism, economic liberalism, free- market liberalism and neoliberalism. As a term, libertarian or economic libertarian has the most colloquial acceptance to describe a member of the movement, with the latter term being based on both the ideology's primacy of economics and its distinction from libertarians of the New Left. According to Ian Adams, \"all US parties are liberal and always have been. Essentially they espouse classical liberalism, that is a form of democratized Whig constitutionalism plus the free market. The point of difference comes with the influence of social liberalism\" and the proper role of government. Some modern American libertarians are distinguished from the dominant libertarian tradition by their relation to property and capital. While both historical libertarianism and contemporary economic libertarianism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through free-market capitalism. Historically, libertarians including Herbert Spencer and Max Stirner have to some degree supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of both government and private property owners. In contrast, while condemning governmental encroachment on personal liberties, some modern American libertarians support freedoms based on private property rights. Anarcho-capitalist theorist Murray Rothbard argued that protesters should rent a street for protest from its owners. The abolition of public amenities is a common theme in some modern American libertarian writings. == History == === 19th and 20th century === Individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner, whose No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority greatly influenced libertarianism in the United States In the 19th century, libertarian philosophies included libertarian socialism and anarchist schools of thought such as individualist and social anarchism.

The use of the term libertarianism to describe a left-wing position has been traced to the French cognate libertaire, a word coined in a letter French libertarian communist Joseph D\u00e9jacque wrote to anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1857.Marshall, Peter (2009). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. p. 641. \"The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work. The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph D\u00e9jacque as the title of his anarchist journal Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist S\u00e9bastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists\".D\u00e9jacque, Joseph (1857). \"De l'\u00eatre-humain m\u00e2le et femelle\u2013Lettre \u00e0 P.J.

Benjamin Tucker, an invidualist anarchist who contrapposed his anarchist socialism to state socialism Moving into the 20th century, the Libertarian League was an anarchist and libertarian socialist organization.

It was established mainly by Cassius V. Cook, Charles T. Sprading, Clarence Lee Swartz, Henry Cohen, Hans F. Rossner and Thomas Bell. In 1954, a second Libertarian League was founded in New York City as a political organization building on the Libertarian Book Club. Members included Sam Dolgoff, Russell Blackwell, Dave Van Ronk, Enrico Arrigoni and Murray Bookchin. This Libertarian League had a narrower political focus than the first, promoting anarchism and syndicalism. Its central principle, stated in its journal Views and Comments, was \"equal freedom for all in a free socialist society\".Libertarian League (1963). \"What We Stand For\".

Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, he argued that government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality. Moreover, the robber baron period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of laissez-faire, was not characterized by laissez-faire at all, but it was in fact a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital.On partnerships between the state and big business and the role of big business in promoting regulation, see Kolko, Gabriel (1977).

Mencken, one of the first people to privately call himself libertarian During the mid-20th century, many with Old Right or classical liberal beliefs began to describe themselves as libertarians. Important American writers such as Rose Wilder Lane, H. L. Mencken, Albert Jay Nock, Isabel Paterson, Leonard Read (the founder of the Foundation for Economic Education) and the European immigrants Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand carried on the intellectual libertarian tradition. In fiction, one can cite the work of the science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, whose writing carried libertarian underpinnings. Mencken and Nock were the first prominent figures in the United States to privately call themselves libertarians.Mencken, H. L. (1961). Letters of H. L. Mencken. Knofp, p. xiii and 189.Nock, Albert Jay (1949). Letters from Albert Jay Nock, 1924\u20131945: to Edmund C. Evans, Mrs. Edmund C. Evans and Ellen Winsor. Caxton Printers. p. 40. They believed Franklin D. Roosevelt had co-opted the word liberal for his New Deal policies which they opposed and used libertarian to signify their allegiance to individualism. In 1923, Mencken wrote: \"My literary theory, like my politics, is based chiefly upon one idea, to wit, the idea of freedom. I am, in belief, a libertarian of the most extreme variety\".Mencken, H. L. (1923). \"Autobiographical Notes, 1941\". Letter to George M\u00fcller as quoted by Marion Elizabeth Rodgers in Mencken: The American Iconoclast (2005). Oxford University Press. p. 105. As of the mid-20th century, no word was used to describe the ideological outlook of this group of thinkers. Most of them would have described themselves as liberals before the New Deal, but by the mid-1930s the word liberalism had been widely used to mean social liberalism.Tucker, Jeffrey (September 15, 2016). \"Where Does the Term \"Libertarian\" Come From Anyway?\" Foundation for Economic Freedom. Retrieved April 7, 2020. The word liberal had ceased to refer to the support of individual rights and limited government and instead came to denote left- leaning ideas that would be seen elsewhere as social-democratic. American advocates of classical liberalism bemoaned the loss of the word liberal and cast about for others to replace it. The word conservative (later associated with libertarianism either through fiscal conservatism or through fusionism) had yet to emerge as Russell Kirk's The Conservative Mind was not published until 1953 and this work hardly mentioned economics at all.

In May 1955, the term libertarian was first publicly used in the United States as a synonym for classical liberal when writer Dean Russell (1915\u20131998), a colleague of Leonard Read and a classical liberal himself, proposed the libertarian solution and justified the choice of the word as follows: Murray Rothbard, who popularized the term libertarian in the 1960s Subsequently, a growing number of Americans with classical liberal beliefs in the United States began to describe themselves as libertarian. The person most responsible for popularizing the term libertarian was Murray Rothbard, who started publishing libertarian works in the 1960s.Cantor, Paul (2012). The Invisible Hand in Popular Culture: Liberty Vs. Authority in American Film and TV. University Press of Kentucky (2). p. 353. Before the 1950s, H. L. Mencken and Albert Jay Nock had been the first prominent figures in the United States to privately call themselves libertarians. Nonetheless, their non-public use of the term went largely unnoticed and the term lay dormant on the American scene for the following few decades. In the 1950s, Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand developed a philosophical system called Objectivism, expressed in her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged as well as other works which influenced many libertarians. However, she rejected the label libertarian and harshly denounced the libertarian movement as the \"hippies of the right\".Rand, Ayn (September 1971). \"Brief Summary\". The Objectivist. 10. \"More specifically, I disapprove of, disagree with and have no connection with, the latest aberration of some conservatives, the so-called \"hippies of the right,\" who attempt to snare the younger or more careless ones of my readers by claiming simultaneously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism\".Rand, Ayn (1981). \"The Age of Mediocrity\".

Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q & A. \"[L]ibertarians are a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people: they plagiarize my ideas when that fits their purpose, and denounce me in a more vicious manner than any communist publication when that fits their purpose\". Nonetheless, philosopher John Hospers, a one-time member of Rand's inner circle, proposed a non-initiation of force principle to unite both groups\u2014this statement later became a required pledge for candidates of the Libertarian Party and Hospers himself became its first presidential candidate in 1972. Along with Isabel Paterson and Rose Wilder Lane, Rand is described as one of the three female founding figures of the modern libertarian movement in the United States. Although influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists, themselves influenced by classical liberalism.. \"[O]nly a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in Power and Market, and some article writers were influenced by [past anarchists like Spooner and Tucker]. Most had not evolved consciously from this tradition; they had been a rather automatic product of the American environment\". Rothbard thought they had a faulty understanding of economics because they accepted the labor theory of value as influenced by the classical economists while he was a student of neoclassical economics and supported the subjective theory of value. Rothbard sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics, arguing that there is a \"scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung\".Rothbard, Murray (1965) [2000]. \"The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View\".

The Vietnam War split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of self- identified libertarians and traditionalist conservatives who believed in limiting liberty to uphold moral virtues. Libertarians opposed to the war joined the draft resistance and peace movements and organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society.

The split was aggravated at the 1969 Young Americans for Freedom convention when more than 300 libertarians coordinated to take control of the organization from conservatives. The burning of a draft card in protest to a conservative proposal against draft resistance sparked physical confrontations among convention attendees, a walkout by a large number of libertarians, the creation of libertarian organizations like the Society for Individual Liberty and efforts to recruit potential libertarians from conservative organizations.Rebecca E. Klatch, A Generation Divided: The New Left, the New Right, and the 1960s, University of California Press, 1999, pp. 215\u2013237. The split was finalized in 1971 when conservative leader William F.

The first type is based on consequentialism, only taking into account the consequences of actions and rules when judging them and holds that free markets and strong property rights have good consequences. The second type is based on deontological ethics and is the theory that all individuals possess certain natural or moral rights, mainly a right of individual sovereignty. Acts of initiation of force and fraud are rights-violations and that is sufficient reason to oppose those acts.Bradford. R. W. (1998). \"The Two Libertarianisms\". Liberty. Deontological libertarianism is supported by the Libertarian Party. In order to become a card-carrying member, one must sign an oath opposing the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals.Yeager, Leland B. (2001).

Similarly, Charlotte and Lawrence Becker maintain that left-libertarianism most often refers to the political position that holds natural resources are originally common property while right-libertarianism is the political position that considers them to be originally unowned and therefore may be appropriated at-will by private parties without the consent of, or owing to, others.Becker, Charlotte B.; Becker, Lawrence C.

While holding that the important distinction for libertarians is not left or right, but whether they are \"government apologists who use libertarian rhetoric to defend state aggression\", Anthony Gregory describes left-libertarianism as maintaining interest in personal freedom, having sympathy for egalitarianism and opposing social hierarchy, preferring a liberal lifestyle, opposing big business and having a New Left opposition to imperialism and war.

Thick libertarianism goes further to also cover moral issues. Charles W.

Thick libertarianism is sometimes viewed as more humanitarian than thin libertarianism. Wendy McElroy has stated that she would leave the movement if thick libertarianism prevails.

Others also describe libertarianism as a reactionary ideology for its support of laissez-faire capitalism and a major reversal of the modern welfare state.Baradat, Leon P. (2015). Political Ideologies. Routledge. p. 31. . In the 1960s, Rothbard started the publication Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought, believing that the left\u2013right political spectrum had gone \"entirely askew\". Since conservatives were sometimes more statist than liberals, Rothbard tried to reach out to leftists.Raimondo, Justin (2000). An Enemy of the State. Chapter 4: \"Beyond left and right\". Prometheus Books. p. 159. In 1971, Rothbard wrote about his view of libertarianism which he described as supporting free trade, property rights and self-ownership. He would later describe his brand of libertarianism as anarcho-capitalismCasey, Gerard; Meadowcroft, John, ed. (2010). Murray Rothbard: Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers. 15.

The Irrepressible Rothbard. Lew Rockwell.com. Retrieved March 15, 2020. Anthony Gregory points out that within the libertarian movement, \"just as the general concepts \"left\" and \"right\" are riddled with obfuscation and imprecision, left- and right-libertarianism can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations\". Some libertarians reject association with either the right or the left. Leonard Read wrote an article titled \"Neither Left Nor Right: Libertarians Are Above Authoritarian Degradation\". Harry Browne wrote: \"We should never define Libertarian positions in terms coined by liberals or conservatives\u2014nor as some variant of their positions. We are not fiscally conservative and socially liberal. We are Libertarians, who believe in individual liberty and personal responsibility on all issues at all times\". Tibor R. Machan titled a book of his collected columns Neither Left Nor Right. Walter Block's article \"Libertarianism Is Unique and Belongs Neither to the Right Nor the Left\" critiques libertarians he described as left (C. John Baden, Randy Holcombe and Roderick T. Long) and right (Edward Feser, Hans-Hermann Hoppe and Ron Paul). Block wrote that these left and right individuals agreed with certain libertarian premises, but \"where we differ is in terms of the logical implications of these founding axioms\". On the other hand, libertarians such as Kevin Carson, Karl Hess, Roderick T. Long and Sheldon Richman consciously label themselves as left- libertarians. === Objectivism === Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably We the Living (1936), The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957), but also in later non-fiction essays and books such as The Virtue of Selfishness (1964) and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1966), among others. Leonard Peikoff, a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir,\"Leonard Peikoff\". Contemporary Authors Online. Retrieved March 2, 2008.. later gave it a more formal structure. Rand described Objectivism as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\". Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a \"closed system\" that is not subject to change. Objectivism's central tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness, that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form\u2014a work of art\u2014that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally. The Objectivist movement founded by Rand attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings. Objectivism has been and continues to be a major influence on the libertarian movement. Many libertarians justify their political views using aspects of Objectivism.Rand, Ayn (1961). For the New Intellectual. Random House.Peikoff, Leonard (1991). Objectivisim: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand. Dutton. However, the views of Rand and her philosophy among prominent libertarians are mixed and many Objectivists are hostile to libertarians in general. Nonetheless, Objectivists such as David Kelley and his Atlas Society have argued that Objectivism is an \"open system\" and are more open to libertarians.Kelley, David (1989). \"Truth and Toleration\". Although academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy, Objectivism has been a significant influence among conservatives and libertarians in the United States. == Criticism == Criticism of libertarianism includes ethical, economic, environmental, pragmatic and philosophical concerns,Friedman, Jeffrey (1993). \"What's Wrong with Libertarianism\". Critical Review. 11 (3). p. 427.Sterba, James P. (October 1994). \"From Liberty to Welfare\". Ethics. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Blackwell. 105 (1): 237\u2013241.Partridge, Ernest (2004). \"With Liberty and Justice for Some\". In Zimmerman, Michael; Callicott, Baird; Warren, Karen; Klaver, Irene; Clark, John. Environmental Philosophy: From Animal Rights to Radical Ecology (4th ed.). Pearson. . including the view that it has no explicit theory of liberty. It has been argued that laissez- faire capitalism does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome\"Complexity Economics Shows Us Why Laissez-Faire Economics Always Fails\". and that its philosophy of individualism as well as policies of deregulation do not prevent the exploitation of natural resources. Michael Lind has observed that of the 195 countries in the world today, none have fully actualized a society as advocated by libertarians, arguing: \"If libertarianism was a good idea, wouldn't at least one country have tried it? Wouldn't there be at least one country, out of nearly two hundred, with minimal government, free trade, open borders, decriminalized drugs, no welfare state and no public education system?\"Lind, Michael. (June 4, 2013). \"The Question Libertarians Just Can't Answer\". Salon. Lind has criticized libertarianism for being incompatible with democracy and apologetic towards autocracy. In response, libertarian Warren Redlich argues that the United States \"was extremely libertarian from the founding until 1860, and still very libertarian until roughly 1930\". Nancy MacLean has criticized libertarianism, arguing that it is a radical right ideology that has stood against democracy. According to MacLean, libertarian-leaning Charles and David Koch have used anonymous, dark money campaign contributions, a network of libertarian institutes and lobbying for the appointment of libertarian, pro-business judges to United States federal and state courts to oppose taxes, public education, employee protection laws, environmental protection laws and the New Deal Social Security program. === Left-wing === Libertarianism has been criticized by the political left for being pro-business and anti-labor, for desiring to repeal government subsidies to disabled people and the poor and being incapable of addressing environmental issues, therefore contributing to the failure to slow global climate change. Left-libertarians such as Noam Chomsky have characterized libertarian ideologies as being akin to corporate fascism because they aim to remove all public controls from the economy, leaving it solely in the hands of private corporations. Chomsky has also argued that the more radical forms of libertarianism such as anarcho- capitalism are entirely theoretical and could never function in reality due to business' reliance on the state as well as infrastructure and publicly-funded subsidies. Another criticism is based on the libertarian theory that a distinction can be made between positive and negative rights, according to which negative liberty (negative rights) should be recognized as legitimate, but positive liberty (positive rights) should be rejected.Sterba, James P. (October 1994). \"From Liberty to Welfare\". Ethics. Cambridge: Blackwell). 105 (1): 237\u2013241. Socialists also have a different view and definition of liberty, with some arguing that the capitalist mode of production necessarily relies on and reproduces violations of the liberty of members of the working class by the capitalist class such as through exploitation of labor and through alienation from the product of one's labor.Woods, Allen (2014). The Free Development of Each: Studies on Freedom, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy. \"Marx on Equality\". pp. 253\u2013266. Anarchist critics such as Brian Morris have expressed skepticism regarding libertarians' sincerity in supporting a limited or minimal state, or even no state at all, arguing that anarcho-capitalism does not abolish the state and that anarcho-capitalists \"simply replaced the state with private security firms, and can hardly be described as anarchists as the term is normally understood\".Morris, Brian. \"Global Anti-Capitalism\". Anarchist Studies. 14 (2): pp. 170\u2013176. Peter Sabatini has noted: \"Within Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist vendors. [...] Rothbard sees nothing at all wrong with the amassing of wealth, therefore those with more capital will inevitably have greater coercive force at their disposal, just as they do now\".Sabatini, Peter (Fall/Winter 1994\u20131995). \"Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy\". Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed (41). For Bob Black, libertarians are conservatives and anarcho- capitalists want to \"abolish the state to his own satisfaction by calling it something else\". Black argues that anarcho-capitalists do not denounce what the state does and only \"object to who's doing it\".Black, Bob (1984). \"The Libertarian As Conservative\". The Abolition of Work and Other Essays. p. 144. Similarly, Paul Birch has argued that anarcho-capitalism would dissolve into a society of city states.Birch, Paul (1998). \"Anarcho-capitalism Dissolves Into City States\" (PDF). Libertarian Alliance. Legal Notes. 28 (4). ISSN 0267-7083. Retrieved July 5, 2019. Other libertarians have criticized what they term propertarianism,Reeder, John P. (1988). Source, Sanction, and Salvation: Religion and Morality in Judaic and Christian Traditions. Pearson College Div. p. 113. with Ursula K. Le Guin contrasting in The Dispossessed (1974) a propertarian society with one that does not recognize private property rightsLe Guin, Ursela K. (2003). The Dispossessed: A Novel.

Lexington Books. p. xvii.Delany, Samuel R. (November 1990). \"On Triton and Other Matters: An Interview with Samuel R. Delany\". Science Fiction Studies. 52. Left-libertarians such as Murray Bookchin objected to propertarians calling themselves libertarians. Bookchin described three concepts of possession, namely property itself, possession and usufruct, i.e. appropriation of resources by virtue of use.Clement, Ellie; Oppenheim, Charles (January 2002). \"Anarchism, Alternative Publishers and Copyright\". Journal of Anarchist Studies. === Right-wing === From the political right, traditionalist conservative philosopher Russell Kirk criticized libertarianism by quoting T. S. Eliot's expression \"chirping sectaries\" to describe them. Kirk had questioned fusionism between libertarian and traditionalist conservatives that marked much of the post-war conservatism in the United States. Kirk stated that \"although conservatives and libertarians share opposition to collectivism, the totalist state and bureaucracy, they have otherwise nothing in common\" and called the libertarian movement \"an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating\". Believing that a line of division exists between believers in \"some sort of transcendent moral order\" and \"utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct\", he included the libertarians in the latter category. He also berated libertarians for holding up capitalism as an absolute good, arguing that economic self-interest was inadequate to hold an economic system together and that it was even less adequate to preserve order. Kirk believed that by glorifying the individual, the free market and the dog-eat-dog struggle for material success libertarianism weakened community, promoted materialism and undermined appreciation of tradition, love, learning and aesthetics, all of which in his view were essential components of true community. Author Carl Bogus states that there were fundamental differences between libertarians and traditionalist conservatives in the United States as libertarians wanted the market to be unregulated as possible while traditionalist conservatives believed that big business, if unconstrained, could impoverish national life and threaten freedom. Libertarians also considered that a strong state would threaten freedom while traditionalist conservatives regarded a strong state, one which is properly constructed to ensure that not too much power accumulated in any one branch, was necessary to ensure freedom. == See also == * American Left * Anarchism in the United States * Libertarianism in South Africa * Libertarianism in the United Kingdom * List of libertarian organizations * List of libertarians in the United States * Progressivism in the United States * Socialism in the United States == References == == Bibliography == * == External links == * Foundation for Economic Education.
