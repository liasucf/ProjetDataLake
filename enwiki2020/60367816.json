It has a new and an old part of the town; the old town of Huangyao (\u9ec4\u59da\u53e4\u9547) has a history of around a thousand years, and many of its buildings date from the Qing dynasty. ==History== It is believed that settlement of the Huangyao area began during the Song dynasty in the Kaibao era (968 \u2013 977) of Emperor Taizu. The name Huangyao was first recorded in the Huangyou era (1049\u20131053) of Emperor Renzong when general Yang Wenguang passed through Zhaoping to pacify Guangxi, and the place was named after the two most common surnames of the locals living in the area \u2013 Huang and Yao. The town first developed during the reign of Wanli Emperor (1572 \u2013 1620) of the Ming dynasty, and it prospered during the reign of Qianlong Emperor (1735 \u2013 1796) in the Qing dynasty. As a result, it has many buildings from the Qing and Ming eras, numbering at over 300. The town was part of a number of administrative divisions throughout its history; today Huangyao includes both an old town and a new district. Many of the buildings in the old town have stayed relatively unchanged in the modern era, and it began to develop as a tourist destination in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was listed as one the 50 most worthwhile places to visit in China in 2006. ==Description== View of Huangyao The karst peaks of Huangyao Huangyao is surrounded by karst peaks and traversed by streams.
