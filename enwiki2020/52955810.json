    "text": "Celestial Navigations was an American music and story-telling group with members Geoffrey Lewis, Geoff Levin, David Campbell, Eric Zimmerman, Betty Ross, and Chris Many. Their performances consisted of Lewis telling a story along with electronic music to enhance the story. Lewis received a Drama-Logue Award for his performances. ==Early beginnings== The group was formed in 1984 and was originally known as The Great American Entertainment Show. When they performed at the Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles, Lewis won a Drama-Logue Award for his performance. According to Lewis, he was inspired by a trip to Africa and the attention storytellers received, and therefore started to envision his own stories to tell. Over the next two decades, the group recorded eight albums. ==Albums== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! Year released !! Album !!
