    "text": "PPK () was a Russian trance duo that was based primarily in Rostov-on-Don. The group consisted of Sergei Pimenov and Alexander Polyakov. The name 'PPK' is the abbreviation of founding members' initials; K was for short-time member DJ Kordj (Roman Korzhov). ==Career== PPK became known internationally due to their single \"ResuRection\", which was available to download for free on mp3.com. A few million people downloaded it and such a wave of popularity brought to signing a contract with Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label and was used to celebrate the New Year 2003 in Warsaw, Poland (seen on Sky News Active, 31 December 2002). This song was the first from a Russian act or USSR act to ever enter the UK Singles Chart. The song reached number 3 in the UK and Sergei Pimenov, Alexander Polyakov and band's manager Yury Marychev were awarded with Silver Disc award certificated by British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and indicated sales of over 200,000 copies in the UK alone. \"ResuRection\" was based on the original melody written by Eduard Artemyev from the 1979 Russian (Soviet) movie Siberiade and contained, in some remix versions, vocal samples of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. The Artemyev melody was later played in the opening ceremony for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, with a small girl holding a red balloon. \"Reload\" was based on the melody \"Zodiak\" from an album \"Disco Alliance\" by Latvian electronic rock band Zodiaks. In early 2004 the duo released a remix of Minimalistix's 2003 hit Magic Fly. The group finally broke up in 2011 after rejoining for a small concert tour in Russia in 2010. On 23 February 2016, former member Roman Korzhov died from cancer. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * 1998 \u0427\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c! * 2002 Reload * 2002 Russian Trance: Formation ===Singles=== * 2000 \"I Have a Dream\" * 2001 \"Hey DJ!\" * 2001 \"ResuRection\" - UK #3 * 2002 \"Reload\" - UK #39 * 2002 \"Reload\" / \"Russian Trance\" ==References== ==External links== * * * mp3.com.au * PPK at Russmus.Net * Alexander Polyakov * pimenov.ru * iRecords \u2014 Alexander Polyakov's label Category:Trance music groups Category:Russian electronic music groups Category:Club DJs Category:Russian dance musicians Category:Russian musical duos Category:Russian techno musicians ",
