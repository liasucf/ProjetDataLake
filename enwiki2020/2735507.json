It begins in the town of North Castle, New York (east of Armonk) in a series of ponds at about altitude. Flowing northeast into the town of Bedford, it abruptly turns south and passes through the Mianus River Gorge, a nature preserve, before entering Stamford, Connecticut, where it is dammed into the Mianus Reservoir, officially known as the Samuel J. Bargh Reservoir ( altitude) of the Greenwich Water Company. From there, it flows south through Stamford and Greenwich into Long Island Sound, at sea level.
