Eventually, Elmer invites Paula to go to the circus with him, where she soon becomes enamored with the lead trapeze artist (George J. Lewis). In an effort to win her heart, Elmer attempts to become an expert in acrobatics as well by practicing in his backyard with a swing and mattress, but with very little success. In the end, though, he is able to show his true mettle, performing amazing athletic feats in order to save Paula from a deadly fire. ==Cast== * Buster Keaton as Elmer * Dorothy Sebastian as Paula Stevens * George J.
