    "text": "Excuse 17 was a punk rock band from Olympia, Washington, USA, that performed and recorded from 1993 to 1995. The band consisted of Becca Albee (vocals and guitar), Carrie Brownstein (guitar and vocals), and Curtis James (drums). The band recorded two full-length albums and a single, and contributed to several compilation albums. ==History== Brownstein, Albee and CJ Phillips (James) came together to form Excuse 17, a band that lasted only a few years would proved to be influential. Brownstein and Albee both played guitar and sang and CJ played the drums. The band quickly recorded a demo tape and then began recording for various compilations on independent record labels. Their first full-length recording, Excuse Seventeen, was released jointly on Atlas Records (LP) and the queercore label Chainsaw Records (CD). They released a second and final album, Such Friends Are Dangerous, on the indie label Kill Rock Stars in 1995, which displayed a boost in recording quality. The band often played shows with Heavens to Betsy, including touring, not surprisingly since both bands were an active part of the riot grrrl scene. They also both appear on the compilation LP/CD Free to Fight. Corin Tucker from Heavens to Betsy struck up a friendship with Brownstein and they dated for a time. They decided to form Sleater-Kinney, a side project that soon evolved into their main focus as their respective groups ended. However, Excuse 17's recordings are still valued by fans of Sleater-Kinney, those interested in riot grrrl and queercore recordings, and record collectors in general: Such Friends Are Dangerous was named one of the fifty best indie rock albums of the Pacific Northwest by online music magazine Pitchfork. Albee also recorded with Tucker as Heartless Martin, releasing a cassette on Chainsaw Records in 1993. Following the dissolution of Excuse 17, Albee has built a successful career in visual art. Her work has been praised by publications including Bomb, Tom Tom, Artforum, and Aperture. Her papers are being preserved by the Fales Library at New York University. As of 2017 she is a photography professor at the City College of New York. As of 2017 James lives in Olympia and plays drums for the rock band Nudity. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Excuse Seventeen on Chainsaw Records (CD) and Atlas Records (LP) (1994) *Such Friends Are Dangerous on Kill Rock Stars (1995) ===Singles=== *\"Youth On Fire\" split single with Lync on Candy Ass Records ===Compilations=== * \"Sevenwhateverteen\" on Periscope, Yoyo Recordings (1994) * \"Forever Fired\" on Free to Fight, Candy Ass - Chainsaw co- release (1995) * \"Carson\" on Yoyo A GoGo, Yoyo Recordings (1996) * \"I'd Rather Eat Glass\" on A Slice Of Lemon, Kill Rock Stars (1996) ==References== ==External links== *Excuse 17 fan site *Excuse 17 Poster 1994-05-21 Category:Punk rock groups from Washington (state) Category:Kill Rock Stars artists Category:Musical groups from Olympia, Washington Category:American musical trios Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1995 Category:Queercore groups Category:Riot grrrl bands Category:1993 establishments in Washington (state) ",
