    "text": "Bad North is a real-time strategy video game developed by Plausible Concept (a game studio in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, founded by Oskar St\u00e5lberg and Richard Meredith) and published by Raw Fury. The game was released on August 20, 2018, for the Nintendo Switch, then for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 28. A Microsoft Windows version was released on October 16, 2018. Versions for the mobile platforms Android and iOS followed on October 16, 2019. ==Gameplay== Bad North focuses on real-time tactics gameplay, having two game modes: normal and hard mode. The main goal is to defend the kingdom from the attacking Viking invaders who killed the king, and to guide the island's people to evacuate. Islands have different layouts so each poses a different challenge. They are divided into multiple tiles and have houses, with Vikings attacking from any corner, so the player's strategy must be well planned to get the opportunity to save the people from the enemy by protecting the houses. The Viking invaders will chuck torches into the houses, and if they burn completely the player will not earn coins for those houses. Gold is needed to get upgrades for units and level up commanders' defenses. The player can also pick up items (represented as question marks in the map) and add new commanders to the Army. == Expansions == On July 24, 2019 a free expansion for Bad North called \"Jotunn Edition\" was released. == Reception == The game was nominated for Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year at the D.I.C.E. Awards. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * == External links == * Category:2018 video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 4 Pro enhanced games Category:Xbox One games Category:iOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Windows games Category:Video games set in the Viking Age ",
