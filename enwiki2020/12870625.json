    "text": "The Delta Jackpot Stakes was an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Delta Downs in Vinton, Louisiana. A Grade III stakes open to two-year-old horses, it was raced in November over a distance of miles (8.5 Furlongs) on dirt. The inaugural running of the Delta Jackpot took place in 2002. Run over a distance of one mile (1.6 km), it carried a purse of $500,000. For the following year, the race was lengthened to miles and the purse was increased to $1 million to make it the second-richest race for two-year-olds in North America behind only the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. The 2005 running of the Delta Jackpot Stakes was cancelled due to Hurricane Rita. The 2017 running was cancelled due to Hurricane Harvey. Delta Downs management discontinued the race after an agreement regarding the race's future could not be reached.Delta Jackpot Will Not Be Renewed in 2018 Sponsored by Boyd Gaming, the Delta Jackpot Stakes was run as a graded race for the first time in 2006. It was run on the same day as the Delta Princess Stakes for two-year-old fillies. The 2007 running of the Delta Jackpot Stakes finished in the race's first dead heat, with Z Humor and Turf War stopping the timer in 1:45.43. As a result of the tie, both horses split $800,000 in purse money. Due to the 2008 economic downturn, the purse was reduced in the 2008 and 2009 runnings from $1,000,0000 to $750,000. The purse was increased back to $1,000,0000 in 2010. ==Records== Speed record: * 1:44.71 \u2013 Rise Up (2013) Most wins by a jockey: * 2 \u2013 Gerard Melancon * 2 \u2013 Kent Desormeaux Most wins by a trainer: * No trainer has won this race more than once.
