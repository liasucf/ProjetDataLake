Since the 1960s, 48 units were built in total, of which the last remaining units are currently in service with the Russian Navy. The Victor-class submarines featured a teardrop shape, which allowed them to travel at high speed. These vessels were primarily designed to protect Soviet surface fleets and to attack American ballistic missile submarines. Project 671 begun in 1959 and design task was assigned to SKB-143, one of the two predecessors (the other being OKB-16) of the Malachite Central Design Bureau, which would eventually become one of the three Soviet/Russian submarine design centers, along with Rubin Design Bureau and Lazurit Central Design Bureau. ==Versions== ===Project 671 Yorsh (Victor I)=== Soviet designation Project 671 Yorsh (ruffe)\u2014was the initial type that entered service in 1967; 16 were produced.Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies 1718-1990, Norman Polmar and Jurrien Noot, Naval Institute Press, 1991 Each had six torpedo tubes for launching Type 53 torpedoes and SS-N-15 anti-submarine missiles and mines could also be released. Subs had a capacity of 24 tube-launched weapons or 48 mines (a combination would require fewer of each). They were long. All disposed. ===Project 671RT Syomga (Victor II)=== Soviet designation Project 671RT Syomga (atlantic salmon)\u2014entered service in 1972; seven were produced in the 1970s. These were originally designated Uniform class by NATO. They had similar armament to the Victor I class and were the first Soviet submarines to introduce rafting for acoustic quieting. Production was truncated due to a decision to develop the improved Victor III class. They were long. All disposed. ===Project 671RTM/RTMK Shchuka (Victor III)=== Soviet designation Project 671RTM/RTMK Shchuka (pike)\u2014entered service in 1979; 25 were produced until 1991. Quieter than previous Soviet submarines, these ships had four tubes for launching SS-N-21 or SS-N-15 missiles and Type 53 torpedoes, plus another two tubes for launching SS-N-16 missiles and Type 65 torpedoes. 24 tube-launched weapons or 36 mines could be on board. The Victor III class caused a minor furor in NATO intelligence agencies at its introduction because of the distinctive pod on the vertical stern-plane. Speculation immediately mounted that the pod was the housing for some sort of exotic silent propulsion system, possibly a magnetohydrodynamic drive unit. Another theory proposed that it was some sort of weapon system. In the end, the pod was identified as a hydrodynamic housing for a reelable towed passive sonar array; the system was subsequently incorporated into the and SSNs. In October 1983 the towed array of , a Victor III operating west of Bermuda, became tangled with the towed array of US frigate . K-324 was forced to surface, allowing NATO forces to photograph the pod in its deployed state. The Victor-III class was continuously improved during construction and late production models have a superior acoustic performance. They were long. 21 disposed. ==Units== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Last active units ! # ! Name ! Project ! Laid down ! Launched ! Commissioned ! Fleet ! Status !

The event was covered up and never made public, though it nearly cost the lives of the sailors on USS Drum.Reed, Craig, \"Red November, inside the secret US-Soviet submarine war\" * On 21 March 1984, K-314 collided with the aircraft carrier in the Sea of Japan. Neither ship was significantly damaged. * The Soviet cargo ship Bratstvo collided with the Soviet submarine K-53 of the Victor I-class in position Latitude 35 deg 55 min North and Longitude 005 deg 00 min West, at the exit from the Gibraltar Strait in Alboran Sea, on 18 (as per ship's time) or 19 (as per submarine time) September 1984. * On 6 September 2006, the Victor III-class Daniil Moskovskiy suffered an electronics fire while in the Barents Sea, killing two crew members. The boat was 16 years old and was overdue for overhaul. It was towed back to Vidyayevo. ==In media== * A depiction of a Victor III-class submarine (Valentin Zukovsky's nephew Nikolai's own submarine) was used prominently in the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough as a key element in the film's antagonists (Elektra King and Viktor \"Renard\" Zokas)'s plan. ==See also== * List of Soviet and Russian submarine classes * List of submarine classes in service * Future of the Russian Navy * Cruise missile submarine * Attack submarine ==References== ==External links== *National Geographic: Victor-class *NATO Code Names for Submarines and Ships accessed March 14, 2004. *Article in Russian Language on Victor I *Article in Russian Language on Victor II *Article in Russian Language on Victor III *Victor III-class submarines - Complete Ship List in English *Article in English from FAS *Fire breaks out aboard Northern Fleet nuclear sub, killing 2 Category:Russian and Soviet navy submarine classes Category:Submarine classes Category:Nuclear-powered submarines Category:1990s ships ",
