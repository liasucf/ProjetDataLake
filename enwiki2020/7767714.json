    "text": "Megophrys parva is a species of horned frog found in South Asia and Southeast Asia, from eastern India and Nepal through Bangladesh and Burma to western Thailand and southern China (Yunnan and Guangxi) and northern Laos and Vietnam. Perhaps because of its wide distribution, Megophrys parva is known under many common names, including concave-crowned horned toad, lesser stream horned frog, mountain horned frog, brown horn frog, Burmese spadefoot toad, and small spadefoot toad. It inhabits evergreen broadleaf forests alongside streams. Males measure and females in length. ==References== parva Category:Amphibians of Bangladesh Category:Amphibians of Bhutan Category:Amphibians of Myanmar Category:Amphibians of China Category:Frogs of India Category:Amphibians of Laos Category:Amphibians of Nepal Category:Amphibians of Thailand Category:Amphibians of Vietnam Category:Amphibians described in 1893 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger ",
