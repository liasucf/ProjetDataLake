Scotland won the four-match series 2\u20130, with two games declared no-results due to rain. Originally planned as a three- match series, an extra game was added to the schedule after the second match was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. The tour was a warm-up for the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier which took place in Ireland the following month. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:35%; margin-left:25px\" |- ! style=\"width:50%\" | ! style=\"width:50%\" | |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Kevin O'Brien (c) * John Anderson * Andrew Balbirnie * Alex Cusack * George Dockrell * Tyrone Kane * Andrew McBrine * Graeme McCarter * ~~John Mooney~~ * Andrew Poynter * Stuart Poynter * David Rankin * Max Sorensen * ~~Paul Stirling~~ * Stuart Thompson * Craig Young | * Preston Mommsen (c) * Richie Berrington * Freddie Coleman * Matthew Cross * Josh Davey * Con de Lange * Alasdair Evans * Michael Leask * Gavin Main * George Munsey * Safyaan Sharif * Craig Wallace * Mark Watt |} On 16 June Ireland's Paul Stirling and John Mooney were removed from the squad.
