    "text": "The Waltham Gas and Electric Company Generating Plant is a historic power company generator building at 96 Pine Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. Built c. 1900\u20131909, this large concrete-and-stone building is an essentially unaltered early power generation plant, although all of its window openings have been filled with concrete. It originally housed a steam power generator, and was sold by Waltham Gas and Electric to Boston Edison, who converted it to an electrical substation in 1917, a role it continues to fulfill. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts ",
