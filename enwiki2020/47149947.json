    "text": "The Astronaut Wives Club is a 2013 New York Times Bestselling book by the American author Lily Koppel based on the experiences of the Astronaut Wives Club, who were wives of US astronauts. It was first published on June 11, 2013 through the Hachette Book Group and provided the basis for the 2015 television series of the same name. == Summary == The book centers upon the personal lives of the wives of the Mercury Seven astronauts who piloted the six manned space flights of Project Mercury between May 1961 and May 1963. The women were frequently the focus of public attention and also came into contact with influential people such as Jackie Kennedy. This rise to celebrity status would take its toll on these women and they ended up turning to each other for solace, calling themselves the Astronaut Wives Club. As a result, they formed the Astronaut Wives Club and met regularly to discuss their daily lives and various issues that only the others would truly understand. Some of the subject matter of the book was previously told in Tom Wolfe's classic novel The Right Stuff and the movie based on it. ==Reception== The Washington Post praised the work commenting that its anecdotes \"fill this breezy and entertaining book, which \u2014 like the women themselves \u2014 takes pleasure in both playing up and defying the stereotypes of the time.\" Dallas News also praised the work, stating that \"Koppel has done an impressive job of research and writing.\" == References == == External links == * Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:American history books ",
