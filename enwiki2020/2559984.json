    "text": "is a Japanese game producer and game designer. He is best known for his work on Final Fantasy and SaGa franchise of role-playing video games. He was the majority shareholder for The Game Designers Studio, a shell corporation founded in June 1999 by Square and re-purposed in 2002 to exploit a loophole with the company's exclusivity deal to develop for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation consoles. ==Biography== ===Joining Square=== Kawazu studied ceramics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Kawazu was invited by a friend to work at the gaming magazine published by Softbank called \"Beep\". He stated that he had always been interested in board games, and after a time joined Square Co. in 1985. ===Early years=== His first game at Square Co. was Rad Racer, creating the ending sequence showing a player's accomplishments. ===Final Fantasy=== He and Hironobu Sakaguchi had wanted to make a role playing game for a long time, and were fans of Wizardry and Ultima, but were concerned it would not sell. After the success in Japan of Dragon Quest, and the popular desire for an RPG proven, development began. Kawazu took over the development of the battle sequence and system, and tried to model it as much after Dungeons and Dragons as he could. Part of the development was to add western fantasy gaming rules, such as a fire monster being vulnerable to ice, which at the time were not features of Japanese gaming. ===Later games=== Production on The Last Remnant began after the remake of Romancing SaGa for the PlayStation 2 was completed. Kawazu was also involved in the development of \"It's New Frontier\" (sic). During the development of Final Fantasy XII, Yasumi Matsuno, who was the lead on the game, left half way through, and Kawazu took over. ===Game style=== Board games such as Avalon Hill and Dungeons & Dragons influence a lot of Kawazu's development process. When creating a new game, he examines the elements like a board game and makes that the working foundation. ==Gameography== *Rad Racer \u2013 Game design *Final Fantasy \u2013 Game design *Final Fantasy II \u2013 Game design *The Final Fantasy Legend \u2013 Director and scenario *Final Fantasy Legend II \u2013 Director and scenario *Romancing SaGa \u2013 Director, scenario, system design, and battle design *Romancing SaGa 2 \u2013 Director, scenario, and game design *Romancing SaGa 3 \u2013 Director *Rudra no Hih\u014d \u2013 Supervisor *SaGa Frontier \u2013 Producer and director *SaGa Frontier 2 \u2013 Producer *Racing Lagoon \u2013 Producer *Legend of Mana \u2013 Producer *Hataraku Chocobo \u2013 Producer *Wild Card \u2013 Game design *Unlimited Saga \u2013 Producer and director *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles \u2013 Producer *Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song \u2013 Producer and director *Code Age Commanders \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy XII \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord \u2013 Executive producer *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers \u2013 Executive producer, scenario writer *The Last Remnant \u2013 Executive producer, scenario writer *It's New Frontier \u2013 Design *Emperors SaGa \u2013 Executive Producer *Imperial SaGa \u2013 Executive Producer *SaGa: Scarlet Grace \u2013 Game designer and scenario writer *Imperial SaGa: Eclipse \u2013 Executive Producer ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:SaGa Category:People from Kumamoto Prefecture Category:Japanese video game designers Category:Final Fantasy designers Category:Tokyo Institute of Technology alumni Category:Square Enix people ",
