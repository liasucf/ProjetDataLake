Her research focuses on taking a look at women experience in higher education. With her research, she has published many books and articles on the concepts of women communication via technology, and how that can differ between genders. Kramarae is mostly known though, for her contributions to muted group theory, as well as A Feminist Dictionary. === Muted Group Theory === Kramarae is most widely known for her contributions to muted group theory (MTG). This theory looks at power and how different groups use it. This theory begins with the premise that language is culture-based, and since men are seen to have more power than women, men have been seen to have power over language, resulting with a male-biased language. MTG breaks down into three assumptions: * Men and women perceive the world differently because they have different perception shaping experiences. * Men enact their power politically, using their power to suppress women's ideas from gaining public awareness. * Women must then convert their voices into language that is considered male. Upon this definition of MGT, Kramarae made the widely accepted claim that language is a tool made by men and used by a dominant culture to marginalize other groups and to deter them from full participation in their given societies. === A Feminist Dictionary === Kramarae is also well known for co-authoring A Feminist Dictionary. This is an alternative dictionary compiled by Kramarae, Ann Russo, and Paula Tredichler. This dictionary includes over 2,500 separate words and definitions from a feminist perspective. This book has since been reprinted as Amazons, Bluestockings and Crones: A Feminist Dictionary. == Activism == In 1977, became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. == Other contributions == * Non- residential associate professor at the Centre for Research into Diversity in the Professions, Leeds Metropolitan University, UK [2008-current] * AAUW Educational Foundation Research Scholar-in-Residence, Washington, D.C.
