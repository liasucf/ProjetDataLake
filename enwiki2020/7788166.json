She sent the transcript to the famous Nigerian author Chinua Achebe in 1962, who replied with a very positive letter and even included money for the postage to mail the manuscript to the English publisher, Heinemann.Ainehi Edoro, Flora Nwapa and the Letter That Changed Nigerian Literature Forever, thejournalist.org.za, retrieved March 2017Ezenwa-Ohaeto, Chinua Achebe: A Biography, p. 93, (), via google-books It was followed by the other novels such as Idu (1970), Never Again (1975), One is Enough (1981), and Women are Different (1986).

Tana has been described as \"the first press run by a woman and targeted at a large female audience. A project far beyond its time at a period when no one saw African women as constituting a community of readers or a book-buying demographic.\"\"Flora Nwapa and the Letter That Changed Nigerian Literature Forever\" , Brittle Paper, 3 February 2016. At the beginning of Nwapa's literary career, as a result of the way feminism was viewed and the way it was portrayed, she had no interest in feminism because she felt it was prejudiced against men but she eventually came to terms with it. However, her struggle with feminism is representative of the present conversations about the movement in Africa and the world at large. Her work was anthologised in publications ranging from Pr\u00e9sence Africaine and Black Orpheus in the 1960s and '70s to Daughters of Africa in 1992.Berrian, Brenda F., \"Flora Nwapa (1931\u20131993): A Bibliography\", Research in African Literatures, Vol. 26, No. 2, Flora Nwapa (Summer 1995), pp. 124\u2013129. ===Later years=== Nwapa's career as an educator continued throughout her life and encompassed teaching at colleges and universities internationally, including at New York University, Trinity College, the University of Minnesota, the University of Michigan and the University of Ilorin.
