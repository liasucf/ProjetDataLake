To generate sympathy for Dalton and give him an advantage in the game, Dan would later be invited to Panama as part of a loved-one-related challenge, and he would dishonestly inform Dalton that his grandmother had died. On the season's eleventh episode, Dan did indeed appear on the island and, in accordance with the plan, informed Dalton in front of the remaining competitors that Dalton's grandmother had died. Seeing that Dalton was seemingly distraught at the news, the remaining competitors subsequently allowed Dalton to win the challenge in order to give him the opportunity to spend time with Dan and obtain more information about his grandmother's alleged death. Though the remaining contestants would not discover the truth until after the season had completed filming, it was quickly revealed to the television audience that Dalton's grandmother had not died but was, in fact, at home \"watching Jerry Springer\".
