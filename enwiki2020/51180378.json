In 1840 Bernard was ordained deacon and licensed to the curacy of Great Baddow, Essex. Ordained priest in 1841, he succeeded to the vicarage of Great Baddow, where he remained until 1846.

He was select preacher at Oxford in 1858, 1862, and 1882. In 1864 Bernard was appointed by Charles Simeon's trustees to the rectory of Walcot, Bath, a reflection of his strong evangelical sympathies. He increased the church accommodation and built St. Andrew's church and schools. In 1867 Robert Eden, the bishop of Bath and Wells, collated him to a prebendal stall in Wells Cathedral; and next year the dean and chapter elected him to a residentiary canonry. He succeeded to the chancellorship of the cathedral in 1879, and from 1880 to 1895 represented the chapter in Convocation. Bernard revived the cathedral grammar school, at his own cost provided buildings for it, and established a high school for girls.

In 1901 he retired from his canonry, retaining only the unpaid post of chancellor.
