In the late 20th century, this part of the East End emerged as a new arts quarter, famous for harbouring the YBA movement, with leading private galleries such as White Cube in nearby Hoxton Square. Both Iniva and Autograph were founded to reflect and promote cultural diversity in the visual arts, and it was hoped that the new building would advance this aim. The five-storey building was designed by leading architect David Adjaye and opened to the public on 5 October 2007. It cost \u00a38 million to complete and was the first publicly funded new-build international art gallery in London since the Hayward Gallery opened more than 40 years earlier. ==Function and activities== Primarily a free public gallery, for most of the year, the two exhibition spaces are used to show contemporary visual art shows. With of space, the venue also houses education facilities and seminar rooms as well as the offices Autograph. ==Significant exhibitions== Featuring in the programme of exhibitions held in the building have been shows by Ghanaian photojournalist James Barnor, British sculptor Hew Locke, French film maker Zineb Sedira and Nigerian/British fine-art photographer Rotimi Fani- Kayode.\"Iniva (Institute of International Visual Arts)\", Rivington Place. ==References== ==External links== *Official website for Autograph *Official website for Iniva Category:Arts centres in London Category:Contemporary art galleries in London Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Hackney Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Hackney Category:Art galleries established in 2007 Category:Shoreditch Category:2007 establishments in England ",
