In television, he is known for playing Joe DuBois, husband of psychic Allison DuBois, in the long running drama series Medium. In 2001 and 2002, Weber was a series regular in HBO's The Mind of the Married Man and made guest appearances on Law & Order: Criminal Intent and NYPD Blue. As of autumn 2016, Weber joined the cast, in a recurring role, of ABC's Secrets and Lies in its second season. After a recurring role on Fox's The Following, Weber has had series regular roles on Hell on Wheels and Homeland. ==Early years== Weber was born in London, to Susan Ann Caroline (n\u00e9e Coriat), a British socialite, and husband Thomas Evelyn \"Tommy\" Weber (originally Thomas Ejnar Arkner), a racing driver who also came from a wealthy family. His father was born in Denmark, of Danish and English descent. Jake's maternal grandfather, Robert Coriat, who was born in Mogador, Morocco, was of Moroccan Sephardic Jewish descent. Jake's maternal grandmother, Priscilla Weigall, was English, from an upper-class family. Priscilla's father was Sir William Ernest George Archibald Weigall, 1st Baronet, while Priscilla's maternal grandfather was Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0916617/bio Weber has one sibling, his brother Charley. Through his English maternal grandmother, Weber is a great-grandson of politician Sir William Ernest George Archibald Weigall, 1st Baronet and wife Grace Emily Blundell Maple, and a great-great-grandson of business magnate Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet and wife Emily Harriet Merryweather. Weber's mother, Susan, was diagnosed with depression and LSD- induced schizophrenia, and died of a drug overdose when Weber was eight years old. His father, who sold various illegal drugs and utilized both his sons in trafficking said drugs to numerous international destinations, struggled with substance addiction until his death in 2006. In 1971, Weber's father took him and his brother to stay for a period at Villa Nellc\u00f4te, where the Rolling Stones were recording Exile on Main St. In a 2010 article for The Times, Weber recalled that his \"father used him as a drug mule to bring cocaine out for Mick and Bianca Jagger's wedding.\" Weber attended Summerhill School, Leiston, Suffolk. Later, he went to the United States to study at Middlebury College in Vermont, where he sang a cappella with the Dissipated Eight and majored in English literature and political science, graduating cum laude with a B.A. degree in 1986. He attended The Juilliard School's Drama Division as a member of Group 19 (1986\u20131990), which also included Laura Linney and Jeanne Tripplehorn. He also studied at Russia's famed Moscow Art Theatre.http://www.jakeweber.com/ At the 2010 Cannes film festival, as part of the Directors' Fortnight at the launching of the rock 'n roll documentary, Stones in Exile, singer Mick Jagger spoke to the crowd about the months of drug-fueled recording sessions that produced the Stones' classic 1972 album Exile on Main Street. Jagger joked about the rarely seen original footage that reveals eight-year-old Weber rolling marijuana joints for them. Weber has reportedly stated that his drug-dealing father brought him to Keith Richards's rented French villa, Nellc\u00f4te, in the seaside town of Villefranche-sur-Mer near Nice, where the Stones were recording the album.'Stupid' Mick Jagger mouths off at Cannes, smh.com.au; accessed 19 January 2018. ==Career== Weber's roles were often bit parts in A-list films, beginning with that of Kyra Sedgwick's character's unnamed boyfriend in the Oliver Stone-directed period saga Born on the Fourth of July (1989) and continuing with work for such directors as Sidney Lumet (A Stranger Among Us, 1992), Alan J. Pakula (The Pelican Brief, 1993) and Martin Brest (Meet Joe Black, 1998). Weber scored one of his premier leads as Dr. Matt Crower, a kindly physician who takes charge of a young boy and protects him from a possessed sheriff in actor-turned- producer Shaun Cassidy's short-lived, but well received, supernatural drama series American Gothic (1995) on CBS. That programme did not last long; and neither did the Mike Binder sitcom The Mind of the Married Man (2001), in which Weber signed on as one of the leads, Chicago newspaper employee Jake Berman. After his prominent role in the 2004 remake of horror film Dawn of the Dead, Weber won the role of Joe Dubois on Medium as the husband of a woman (Patricia Arquette) plagued by psychic visions who uses her ability to help solve crimes. As of autumn 2016, Weber is a recurring guest-star as the psychotherapist husband of Detective Andrea Cornell (played by series lead Juliette Lewis) on the second season of the ABC murder mystery, Secrets and Lies. The series was picked up for a full second season by ABC after a successful limited run last spring as a midseason replacement.
