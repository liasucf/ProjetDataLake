Powell also played one season for the Kintetsu Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball in . As a big league hitter, Powell had three hits \u2014 all doubles \u2014 in 17 at bats (owing to the fact that he played mostly in the American League, during the designated hitter era), for a .176 batting average. The fact that all three of Powell\u2019s hits were two-baggers ties him with Earl Hersh and Verdo Elmore for the most hits in a major league career in which all the player\u2019s hits were doubles. ==External links== *Dennis Powell at Baseball Gauge *Dennis Powell at Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Professional Baseball League) Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:African-American baseball players Category:Albuquerque Dukes players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:American expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Baseball players from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Calgary Cannons players Category:Denver Zephyrs players Category:Gulf Coast Dodgers players Category:Kintetsu Buffaloes players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Nashville Sounds players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:People from Moultrie, Georgia Category:Piratas de Campeche players Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:San Antonio Dodgers players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Sultanes de Monterrey players Category:Tiburones de La Guaira players Category:Vero Beach Dodgers players ",
