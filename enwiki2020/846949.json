    "text": "The English Intelligencer was a mid-1960s magazine devoted to poetry and letters founded and edited by poets Andrew Crozier and Peter Riley. It played a key role in the emergence of many of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival, and was consciously conceived as an attempt to unite a scattered British avant-garde in response to similar developments in the United States. The Intelligencer was circulated to a mailing list of British poets; the number of correspondents varied between 25 and 65, with a constant core of about a dozen. It was mimeographed and appeared roughly every three weeks, with the total run amounting to 36 issues between January 1966 and April 1968. The poets and writers who contributed and/or corresponded with the Intelligencer included Tom Raworth, Douglas Oliver, Lee Harwood, Jim Burns, Tom Pickard, Elaine Feinstein, Barry MacSweeney, John James, J. G. Ballard, Donald Davie, J. H. Prynne, John Riley, C. H. Sisson, Chris Torrance, Gael Turnbull and Jeff Nuttall. ==References== ==External links== *Certain Prose of the English Intelligencer (Mountain Press, 2012) Category:1966 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1968 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:British Poetry Revival Category:Defunct literary magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1966 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1968 Category:Poetry literary magazines ",
