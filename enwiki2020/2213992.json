    "text": "The Thouless energy is a characteristic energy scale of diffusive disordered conductors. It was first introduced by the Scottish-American physicist David J. Thouless when studying Anderson localization,J. T. Edwards and D. J. Thouless, \"Numerical studies of localization in disordered systems,\" J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 5, 807 (1972), . as a measure of the sensitivity of energy levels to a change in the boundary conditions of the system. Though being a classical quantity, it has been shown to play an important role in the quantum-mechanical treatment of disordered systems.A. Altland, Y. Gefen, and G. Montambaux, \"What is the Thouless Energy for Ballistic Systems?\", Physical Review Letters 76, 1130 (1996), . It is defined by :E_{\\rm T} = \\frac{\\hbar D}{L^2}, where D is the diffusion constant and L the size of the system, and thereby inversely proportional to the diffusion time :t_D = \\frac{L^2}{D} through the system. ==References== Category:Mesoscopic physics Category:Condensed matter physics ",
