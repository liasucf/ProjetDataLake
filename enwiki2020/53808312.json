They played blues songs from the masters; Big Bill Broonzy, Skip James, Tampa Red, Mississippi John Hurt and many others. The McLerran family moved to Tulsa in 1998 where Joe and Jesse continued to play old blues songs. In 2004, during the final stages of mixing the CD Jesse died due to an accident at home. As a memorial and tribute to Jesse, the Pearly Gates CD was released in 2004 as Son Piedmont and the Blues Krewe on the Roots Blues Reborn label.
