The genre effectively ended with the French Revolution. Themes of libertine novels were anti- clericalism, anti-establishment and eroticism. Authors include Cyrano de Bergerac (L\u2019Autre monde ou les \u00e9tats et empires de la Lune, 1657) , Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr\u00e9billon (Les \u00c9garements du c\u0153ur et de l'esprit, 1736; Le Sopha, conte moral, 1742), Denis Diderot (Les bijoux indiscrets, 1748), Marquis de Sade (L'Histoire de Juliette, 1797-1801), Choderlos de Laclos (Les Liaisons dangereuses, 1782). Other famous titles are Histoire de Dom Bougre, Portier des Chartreux (1741) and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Philosophe (1748). Precursors to the libertine writers were Th\u00e9ophile de Viau (1590-1626) and Charles de Saint- Evremond (1610-1703), who were inspired by Epicurus and the publication of Petronius, and John Wilmot (Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery, 1684). . Robert Darnton is a cultural historian who has covered this genre extensively. ==English translations== In alphabetical order by author's last name: * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== In alphabetical order by last name: * * * * * ==References== Category:Literary genres Category:French literature ",
