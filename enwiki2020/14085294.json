    "text": "Aham, a concept of Kashmir Shaivism, is defined as the supreme heart ',, Jaideva Singh, page 78 transcendent Self, supreme I awareness , Jaideva Singh, page 131 or infinite consciousness.The Triadic Heart of \u015aiva, Paul Muller- Ortega, page 145 The space of Aham is where khecar\u012b mudr\u0101 (free movement in the space of the heart) is realised. Khecar\u012b mudr\u0101 is considered the supreme state of spiritual evolution. ==Substrate of creation== When \u015aiva wants to create, the first step is said to be the creation of an interior space (the space of his heart) - a matrix of energies that will be the substrate of the new world. This place is called Aham which means \"I\" in Sanskrit. Thus the absolute first creates the divine person, Aham, and from this divine person will appear the manifestation itself. Aham is identical to ' (the wheel of phonematic energies), essential nature of all categories from ' (earth) to ',. Jaideva Singh, page 194 Aham is the final resting place, dwelling place, abode of all beings, receptacle of the world.The Triadic Heart of \u015aiva, Paul Muller- Ortega, page 179 ==Ultimate mantra== Another definition of Aham is that of primordial mantra,, the energy of the depths, page 214 transcendental mantra,, Jaideva Singh, page 180 the so-called heart-b\u012bja (mantra of the heart) - force and power of consciousness.The Triadic Heart of \u015aiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 163 As the supreme mantra, Aham is closely related to matrav\u012brya (the potency of mantra).The Triadic Heart of \u015aiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 160 Thus the realization of Aham confers power over any mantra., Jaideva Singh, page 195 ==United form of Shiva and Shakti== In Aham, the supreme (para) aspect of \u015aakti is realized. Aham is the \u015aakti of \u015aiva or in other words, the expansion of \u015aiva., Jaideva Singh, page 127 Another way of describing Aham is as the union of \u015aiva and \u015aakti,, Jaideva Singh, page 194 the emittive (visarga) aspect of the Supreme (anuttara). ==Etymology== Aham is formed of A+HA+M, a triad of \u015ahiva (A), \u015aakti (HA) and bindu (M)., Jaideva Singh, page 55 M is the final point, union of \u015aiva and \u015aakti, where they dissolve into Parama\u015biva. The triangle of A+HA+M is the essence of the Trika system., the energy of the depths, page 32 A+HA+M form the ' (seed of emission), a mantra that is identical to the energy of expansion and creation., Jaideva Singh, page 13 Aham can also be defined as: A = abedha (non-differentiation), HA = bheda (differentiation) and M = bhed\u0101bheda (differentiation cum non- differentiation)., Jaideva Singh, page 30 ==Maha, the mirror image of Aham== On the other hand, Maha, mirror image of Aham,The Triadic Heart of \u015aiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 159 is formed of Ma+Ha+A, and represents the ' (seed of reabsorption) - the mantra that is identical to the process of spiritual evolution, or in other words reabsorption of the manifestation back into the absolute. In Maha, \u015aakti (Ha) enters bindu (M) (the limited being) and reunites it with the Supreme (A)., Jaideva Singh, page 182 ==See also== * Ramana Maharshi * The 36 tattvas ==References== Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Kashmir Shaivism ",
