Zutter's only event that did not result in a medal was in the horizontal bar. ChampaudWhich nation Champaud's results should be credited to is disputed. Champaud was a Swiss national living in Sofia. The Bulgarian Olympic Committee claims Champaud competed for Bulgaria, making that nation one of those debuting in 1896; however, most results list include Champaud as Swiss. The International Olympic Committee's official number of 14 nations at the 1896 Summer Olympics almost certainly includes Bulgaria, which would make Champaud's results credited to Bulgaria. (see Bulgaria at the 1896 Summer Olympics) entered three events, but did not medal in any. {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Score !Rank |- |rowspan=4|Louis Zutter |Vault |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Parallel bars |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Pommel horse |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Horizontal bar |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"|Unknown |} ==Shooting== Baumann took 8th of 42 in the military rifle competition. {|class=wikitable style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Hits !Score !Rank |- |Albert Baumann |200 m military rifle |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"|1294 |align=\"center\"|8 |} ==Notes== ==References== * (Digitally available at ) * (Excerpt available at ) * Category:Nations at the 1896 Summer Olympics 1896 Olympics ",
