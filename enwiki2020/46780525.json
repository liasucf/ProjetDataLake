    "text": "The equestrian statue of Frederick VII in front of Christiansborg on Slotsholmen in Copenhagen, Denmark, was modelled by Herman Wilhelm Bissen and completed posthumously by his son Vilhelm Bissen in 1873. It was created to commemorate King Frederick's central role in Denmark's transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy. ==Description== Closeup of the statue The statue shows Frederik VII of Denmark on horseback, wearing a long coat. The granite plinth is decorated with bronze plaques on all sides. That on the front features a gilt oak wreath and the inscription \"5/IUNI/1849\" in gilt letters.

The inscription on the right hand side reads \"FREDERIK D: SYVENDE/GRUNDLOVENS GIVER.\" (Frederik the Seventh, granter of the constitution). The inscription on the rear side reads \"F\u00d8DT 1808./KONGE 1848./D\u00d8D 1863.\u201d (Born 1808, King 1848, died 1863). ==History== Bissen's studio in Civiletatens Materialg\u00e5rd with parts of the statue second Christiansborg Palace as a backdrop The monument under construction in 1873, illustration from Illustreret Tidende The statue with the remains of the second Christiansborg in May 1908 When crown prince Frederick ascended to the Danish throne in 1848, following the death of his father, he became the ninth absolute monarch of Denmark since 1660. On 21 March 1848, a demonstration with 10,000 people gathered on the plaza in front of Christiansborg Palace, demanding a new government and democratic reforms. The king immediately agreed and the Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849. The statue was created on the initiative of a committee chaired by Carl Ploug to commemorate the monarch's role in ensuring Denmark's transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy. It was financed through contributions from the Danish state, the City of Copenhagen and private donations. Herman Wilhelm Bissen was charged with the design of the statue which was later completed by his son Vilhelm Bissen. It was cast by Parisian bronze casters at Vilhelm Bissen's workshop at Carlsberg. The monument was unveiled on 6 October 1873. It survived the fire of the second Christiansborg Palace in 1894. ==See also== * List of public art in Copenhagen * Equestrian statue of Christian IX ==References== ==External links== * Details Category:1873 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1873 Frederick VII Category:Monuments and memorials in Copenhagen Category:Outdoor sculptures in Copenhagen Category:Sculptures of men in Denmark Frederik VII Category:Statues in Copenhagen Category:Sculptures by Herman Wilhelm Bissen ",
