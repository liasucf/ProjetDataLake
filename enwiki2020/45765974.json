    "text": "Robert E. Sheriff (19 April 1922 \u2013 19 November 2014) was an American geophysicist best known for writing the comprehensive geophysical reference, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Exploration Geophysics. His main research interests included the seismic detailing of reservoirs, in 3-D seismic interpretation and seismic stratigraphy, and practical applications of geophysical (especially seismic) methods.Robert Sheriff faculty profile, CV. Retrieved 24 November 2014. Hua-Wei Zhou, Department Chair of the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, said about Sheriff: \u201c\u2026a giant figure in the world of exploration geophysics\u2026 When I think about Bob, a number of key words pop up in my mind: kindness, honesty, hardworking, seeking perfection, generosity and wisdom.\u201d Hua-Wei Zhou faculty profile. Retrieved 24 November 2014. == Career == Sheriff worked on uranium isotope separation for the World War II Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He worked on this project from 1943-1946.Robert Sheriff - Obituary. Houston Chronicle, retrieved 24 November 2014.Never Hold Back, Thomas Smith. Geo Profile, GEOExPro. Retrieved 24 November 2014. After receiving his masters and PhD in physics, Sheriff accepted a job at Standard of California (Chevron) to work in their new geophysical research lab. Serving in a variety of functions, including managing geophysical crews and drilling activity overseas, Sheriff worked at Chevron for 25 years. Sheriff went on to work 5 years as Senior Vice-President of Development with Seiscom-Delta Corporation before moving to academia at the University of Houston. He served as a tenured professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences for 23 years before retiring. He served as Professor Emeritus after his retirement. Sheriff was one of the originators of the geophysical topic, attributes, and is coauthor of what some consider the seminal article in the field,Complex trace analysis (GEOPHYSICS, 1979).M. T. Taner, F. Koehler, and R. E. Sheriff (1979). \u201dComplex seismic trace analysis.\u201d Complex seismic trace analysis, 44(6), 1041-1063. Dean Clark (2007). \u201dThe Sheriff Symposium.\u201d The Sheriff Symposium, 26(7), 898-900. == Society of Exploration Geophysicists == Sheriff served as First Vice President for Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) from 1972-73. In 1969, Sheriff received the SEG Virgil Kauffman Medal for his initial publication of the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Exploration Geophysics. Sheriff received SEG's highest award in 1998, the Maurice Ewing Award, for his lifetime achievements in geophysics. In 2006, SEG members voted the 1973 dictionary as the top geophysical book ever published for the industry, citing a copy could be found in every working exploration office. As Lee Lawyer pointed out in Sheriff\u2019s citation for the Maurice Ewing Medal, Sheriff was in the forefront of such major trends in geophysical theory as hydrocarbon indicators, sequence stratigraphy, and reservoir geophysics. In addition, he was responsible for the first poster session at an SEG Annual Meeting, arranged the SEG technical presentations at the first two Offshore Technology Conferences, and co- organized industry-academic seminars to expedite transfer of knowledge between campus and industry. === Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics === Sheriff created a 30-page pamphlet to support his training classes as well as help train employees on the latest concepts in geophysics. After a past SEG president received the pamphlet, the president recommended to the SEG membership that the document be expanded. This document served as the foundation for what would become the Encyclopedic Dictionary. It transformed from a 30-page glossary to 429 pages in its 4th edition. Each subsequent edition of the dictionary saw significant increases in the number of terms. The third edition (published in 1991) contained 20% more entries than the second (published in 1984). The fourth (published in 2002) had 61 more pages of definitions than the third. For over four decades Sheriff updated the dictionary to reflect the latest technology and research in geophysics. == Honors == * 1998: Maurice Ewing medal of SEG for lifetime work in geophysics * 1997: Quest for Excellence Award, University of Houston College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics * 1996: Special Commendation Award, Society of Exploration Geophysicists * 1993: Hayden Williams Fellow, Curtin Univ. of Tech., Perth, W.Australia * 1993: Distinguished lecturer, Australian Society of Exploration Geophy. * 1980: Honorary Membership in Geophysical Society of Houston * 1979: Honorary Membership in Society of Exploration Geophysicists * 1977: Distinguished lecturer, Society of Exploration Geophysicists * 1969: Kauffman Gold Medal of SEG for outstanding contribution to geophysics == Principle books == * Sheriff, Robert E., and Lloyd P.
