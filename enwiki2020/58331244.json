    "text": "The salivarius-1 RNA motif is a conserved RNA structure that was discovered by bioinformatics. The salivarius-1 motif occurs in various strains of the species Lactobacillus salivarius, as well as some metagenomic sequences that come from unknown species. salivarius-1 RNAs likely function in trans as small RNAs. While most salivarius-1 RNAs are upstream of protein-coding genes, which could suggest a function as cis-regulatory elements, the downstream gene is often located far away. Curiously, salivarius-1 RNAs are often located nearby to other salivarius-1 RNAs. ==References== Category:Non-coding RNA ",
