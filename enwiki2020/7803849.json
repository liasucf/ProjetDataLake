    "text": "The Maserati Sebring was a two-door 2+2 coup\u00e9 manufactured by Maserati from 1962 until 1968. Based on the Maserati 3500, the Sebring was aimed at the American Gran Turismo market and named after Maserati's 1957 racing victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring. A single two-seat spyder was built by Vignale in 1963 but did not enter production. ==History== ===Series I=== The Series I (Tipo AM 101/S) was shown at Salon International de l'Auto 1962 and again at the Salone dell'automobile di Torino in 1963. Employing all but the Maserati 3500's coachwork, it could reach and 0\u201360 mph (97 km/h) in 8.5 seconds on 185x16 Pirelli Cinturato tyres. A Borg-Warner automatic transmission was available as an option, When leaving the factory it originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72). A total of 348 Series I Sebrings were built between 1962 and 1965. The engine was updated in 1963, gaining 15PS for a total of . The 3700 engine first appeared in 1964, although only a handful of Series I cars were thus equipped. ===Series II=== Maserati Sebring Series II Maserati Sebring 3700 GT Series II rear view In 1965, the modified Series II (Tipo AM 101/10) was introduced. It had lightly redesigned headlamps, modernized bumpers, new turn signals in front, and new side grilles replacing the lower extraction vents used hitherto.Tabucchi, p. 248 It took minor design cues from the contemporary Quattroporte. At the rear, aside from the squared off bumpers, the taillights were now mounted horizontally rather than vertically and the bootlid opening was narrowed somewhat. The Series II rode on larger 205x15 Pirelli Cinturatos. A run of 247 units were made from 1964 until 1968. Along with the 3500 engine, the 3700 (lengthened stroke which enlarged it to 3,694 cc (245 cubic inches)) and the even larger 4000 were added. The 4000 GTiS has a 4,012 cc engine producing at 5,200 rpm. It remained in production until 1968, when financial constraints forced Maserati to drop its older models from production. No major updates took place over the last three years of production, except for a slight power gain for the 4000, now up to . It is believed that around 446 Sebrings were made in total from 1962 to 1969, with 348 units of the Sebring 3.5 and an estimated 98 of the 3.7 and 4.0 (combined). Anecdotal evidence related that according to the practice of marking interior panels and wood fitted pieces, the actual model number was only written in yellow grease marker on the rear surfaces of the interior bodywork. Evidence from assumed number 69 reveals parts with number \u201c69 di 96\u201d suggesting only 96 models were produced making them the rarest of the series 2 cars produced. Jeremy Clarkson named the Sebring as #77 on his Top 100 Cars list. ==References== ==External links== *maserati-alfieri.co.uk on the Sebring (archived page) *deutschemaseraticlub.de offers a chassis number analysis * offers a Maserati Sebring database * Sebring - First series official website * Sebring - Second Series official website Sebring Maserati Sebring Maserati Sebring Category:Cars introduced in 1962 ",
