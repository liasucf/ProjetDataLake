    "text": "Mangeliidae is a monophyletic family of small to medium-sized, predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Conoidea. Bouchet, P. (2011). Mangeliidae P. Fischer, 1883. In: MolluscaBase (2016). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=153853 on 2017-02-23Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P. (Ed.) (2005). \"Classification and nomenclator of gastropod families\". Malacologia 47(1-2). . 397 pp. Prior to 2011, both the subfamilies Mangeliinae and Oenopotinae had been placed in the family Conidae. In 2011, Bouchet, Kantor et al merged the two subfamilies into one taxon, which they elevated to the rank of family. This was based on anatomical characters and a dataset of molecular sequences of three gene fragments. Mangeliidae is a sister-clade to the family Raphitomidae As with their relatives in the family Conidae, species in the family Mangelidae use potent venoms to catch their prey. Through this characteristic, they are of interest in pharmacological research. ==Description== This family is characterized in general by usually the lack of an operculum, by a deep anal sinus on the subsutural ramp and with a heavy callus on the shoulder slope of the outer lip. The Mangeliidae are small to medium-sized gastropods (length usually smaller than 30 mm). The high-spired shell has a fusiform to an oval or biconical shape. The protoconch is helicoid, with a very small initial, and rapidly increasing subsequent whorls. The spire is usually comparatively low. The shoulders of the whorls are often angular. The axial ribs are dominant in the sculpture of the shell. The spiral sculpture often consists of fine striae with a microsculpture of spirally aligned granules (especially on the subsutural ramp). The texture of the adult shell is frequently \"gritty,\" from a sculpture of minute grains. The aperture is oval-elongated, usually narrow, terminating in a rather short, truncated siphonal canal. The aperture is only rarely denticulate. The outer lip (labrum) is reinforced. The varix is usually well developed, and the fasciole evanescent. A series of pustules on the columella is an ordinary feature. The toxoglossate radula has a weak basal ribbon and relatively short marginal teeth with very variable morphology (from semi-enrolled to true hypodermic). The tooth cavity opens laterally.Chen-Kwoh Chang, Small Turrids of Taiwan, chapter 12, p. 116; June, 1 2001, pls 42-56 However, the genera Neoguraleus and Liracraea are operculate; the operculum in these genera has a terminal nucleus. These exceptions mean that the reinforced outer lip is the most characteristic feature of this family. The species in this family occurred from the Paleogene to Recent. == Genera == This is a list of the accepted names of species in the family Mangeliidae : (the main reference for Holocene species is the World Register of Marine Species) * Acmaturris Woodring, 1928 * Agathotoma Cossman, 1899 * \u2020 Amblyacrum Cossmann, 1889 * Anticlinura Thiele, 1934 * Antiguraleus Powell, 1942 * Apispiralia Laseron, 1954 * Apitua Laseron, 1954 * Bactrocythara Woodring, 1928 * Bela Gray, 1847 * Belalora Powell, 1951 * \u2020 Belidaphne Vera-Pel\u00e1ez, 2002 * Bellacythara McLean, 1971 * Benthomangelia Thiele, 1925 * Brachycythara Woodring, 1928 * \u2020 Buchozia Bayan, 1873 * Cacodaphnella Pilsbry & Lowe, 1933 * Citharomangelia Kilburn, 1992 * Cryoturris Woodring, 1928 * Curtitoma Bartsch, 1941 * Cythara Fischer, 1883 (nomen dubium) * Cytharopsis A.
