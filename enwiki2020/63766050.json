Founding leader and self-styled \"Commander-in-Chief\" of the Namibian Economic Freedom Fighters, he was elected to the 7th National Assembly in 2019. The NEFF is known for its left-wing economic views, including calls to nationalize Namibia's vast natural resources, and right-wing, anti-LGBT social views. In the Presidential election, which coincided with the National Assembly election, Mukwiilongo finished in 11th and last place with 1,026 votes (0.1%). He is the nephew of Leonard Nangolo Mukwiilongo, who was the first governor of the Omusati Region. In 2004, he was named to the executive committee of the Congress of Democrats, which was the official opposition at the time. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Members of the National Assembly (Namibia) Category:21st-century Namibian politicians Category:Congress of Democrats politicians Category:Candidates for President of Namibia ",
