A wood-engraving of the Welcome Stranger published in The Illustrated Australian News for Home Reader on 1 March 1869. The scale bar across the bottom represents . Gold nuggets of various sizes have been found throughout the world. Historically, they are melted down and formed into new objects. The Welcome Stranger is the biggest alluvial gold nugget found, which had a calculated refined weight of . Three of the biggest nuggets come from the Brazilian Serra Pelada Mine. Most of the large nuggets were melted down into ingot form and so only have historical records of their size and mass. ==Formation== A gold nugget is a naturally occurring piece of native gold. Watercourses often concentrate nuggets and finer gold in placers. Nuggets are recovered by placer mining, but they are also found in residual deposits where the gold-bearing veins or lodes are weathered. Nuggets are also found in the tailings piles of previous mining operations, especially those left by gold mining dredges. Nuggets are gold fragments weathered out of an original lode. They often show signs of abrasive polishing by stream action, and sometimes still contain inclusions of quartz or other lode matrix material. A 2007 study on Australian nuggets ruled out speculative theories of supergene formation via in-situ precipitation, cold welding of smaller particles, or bacterial concentration, since crystal structures of all of the nuggets examined proved they were originally formed at high temperature deep underground (i.e., they were of hypogene origin). Nuggets are usually 20.5K to 22K purity (83% to 92% by mass). Gold nuggets in Australia often are 23K or slightly higher, while Alaskan nuggets are usually at the lower end of the spectrum. Purity can be roughly assessed by the nugget color, the richer and deeper the orange-yellow the higher the gold content. Nuggets are also referred to by their fineness, for example \"865 fine\" means the nugget is 865 parts per thousand in gold by mass. The common impurities are silver and copper. Nuggets high in silver content constitute the alloy electrum. Two gold nuggets are claimed as the largest in the world: the Welcome Stranger and the Cana\u00e3 nugget, the latter being the largest surviving natural nugget. Considered by most authorities to be the biggest gold nugget ever found, the Welcome Stranger was found at Moliagul, Victoria, Australia in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates. It weighed gross, over and returned over net. The Welcome Stranger is sometimes confused with the similarly named Welcome Nugget, which was found in June 1858 at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, Australia by the Red Hill Mining Company. The Welcome weighed . It was melted down in London in November 1859. Large size nuggets are still being found around the world. On 16 January 2013, a large gold nugget was found near the city of Ballarat in Victoria, Australia by an amateur gold prospector. The Y-shaped nugget weighed slightly more than , measured around 22 cm high by 15 cm wide, and has a market value slightly below 300,000 Australian dollars, though opinions have been expressed that it could be sold for much more due to its rarity. The discovery has cast doubt on the common rumour that Victoria's goldfields were exhausted in the 19th century. ==List of nuggets== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Name !Discovered by !Location of Discovery !Country !Date !data-sort-type=\"number\"| Mass !data-sort-type=\"number\"|Net return !Notes !style=\"width:5%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|References |- |Welcome Stranger |John Deason and Richard Oates | | |1869 | | | Found only below the surface, near the base of a tree | |- |Welcome Nugget |Red Hill Mining Company |Bakery Hill, Ballarat | |June 1858 | | |Melted down in London in November 1859 | |- | Cana\u00e3 nugget also known as the Pepita Canaa | Serra Pelada Mine | State of Para | | | | | Largest in existence | |- | | W.A.
