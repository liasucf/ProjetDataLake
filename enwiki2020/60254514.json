Writing for All About Jazz, Sammy Stein summarised the album by saying \"Circuits is a terrific recording, and what it does is show Potter at his show-stopping best. But it also incorporates modern electronic sounds, demonstrating that there is no line in jazz. Modern can match with traditional influences and merge to develop something verging on the extraordinary\". In the same publication, Roger Farbey described Circuits as \"an early contender for album of the year\", saying \"Circuits carries considerable visceral heft and largely thanks to Potter's multi-instrumental versatility there's an occasional big band feel to the tracks. In any event, this album demonstrates, once again, the mark of Potter's true virtuosity and ingenuity\". Dave Jones of Jazz Journal also gave a positive review, opining that \"This is definitely an album to savour, with strong compositions and excellent playing from a well-chosen team\". In The Times, Chris Pearson noted the stylistic departure from Potter's recent ECM Records releases, saying \"Chris Potter is one of the world\u2019s best saxophonists, a master at mixing modern musical genres with conviction, but it has been hard to embrace the diffuse, introspective discs he has recorded of late. With Circuits, his first release with the British label Edition, he consciously gets back to the groove and the result is a relief. His lyricism remains, but the music to which it is applied has far more grit and energy\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Chris Potter # \"Invocation\" \u2212 2:08 # \"Hold It\" \u2212 6:49 # \"The Nerve\" \u2212 8:30 # \"Koutom\u00e9\" \u2212 6:47 # \"Circuits\" \u2212 9:26 # \"Green Pastures\" \u2212 8:24 # \"Queens of Brooklyn\" \u2212 3:34 # \"Exclamation\" \u2212 7:16 # \"Pressed for Time\" \u2212 8:35 ==Personnel== *Chris Potter - soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, clarinets, flutes, sampler, guitars, keyboards, percussion *James Francies \u2212 keyboards *Eric Harland \u2212 drums *Linley Marthe \u2212 electric bass (tracks 3, 4, 5, 8) == References == Category:2019 albums Category:Edition Records albums Category:Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist) albums ",
