His great-uncle Stephen George Comyn had been naval chaplain to the English Admiral Lord Nelson.

Through this business he went to California where he settled and became a businessman in San Francisco. His father in law William Emil Gerber of Sacramento, California was a merchant and financier, and may have supported his enterprises.Sacramento County Biographies William Emil Gerber One of the ships he built was a five master sailing ship named Ann Comyn after his wife. During World War I Leslie Comyn, tried to persuade the United States Shipping Board (USSB) that they should build concrete ships. They were not convinced so in 1917, he founded the San Francisco Shipbuilding Company at Oakland, California. In January 1918 he started, on speculation, to build the first ship, called appropriately \"FAITH\" designed by Alan MacDonald and Victor Poss. The ship was an 8000-ton freighter, and, at the time, the largest concrete vessel with a sea-going capability in the world. The ship was launched successfully in March 1918.New York Times Mar 15, 1918 BIG CONCRETE SHIP AFLOAT IN PACIFICTimes Monday March 18, 1918 U. S.

In May 1918, Faith left San Francisco on her maiden voyage, with 4300 tons of salt and copper ore, bound for Vancouver, followed by other voyages to Honolulu, Balboa, Callao, Valparaiso and New York.

Signal Oil & Gas Co. of, 310 U.S. 268 (1940)\".FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code The question concerned is whether the Standard Oil were entitled to maritime liens for fuel oil delivered to Dannebrog's vessels. Dannebrog had chartered two ships - the 'Stjerneborg' and the 'Brand' - to W. L. Comyn & Sons in May 1933. Standard Oil had previously modified a contract with Anglo Canadian Shipping to include the fuel oil requirements of vessels owned, chartered or operated by W. L. Comyn & Sons. ==Family== Comyn married Ann Gerber, daughter of William Gerber, and had three children. His brother Hugh Comyn was a Wimbledon singles entrant in 1906 and 1907 as well as a Scottish Open (badminton) champion in 1908 and 1909.
