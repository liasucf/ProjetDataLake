Fitch was a two-time American champion in the discus (1942 and 1946) and was the winner of the 1942 NCAA Championships.

He went on to study at the University of Minnesota. He was part of the college football team as an end for the Minnesota Golden Gophers at a time when the team ranked first in the nation and overseen by coach Bernie Bierman.

After graduating college, he was drafted in the seventh round of the 1942 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, but chose not to pursue professional football. After graduating, he worked for the United States Coast Guard for several years before returning to education at Minnesota, starting a master's degree in physiology. It was in this second stint at the university that his discus throwing reached its peak. Under the guidance of Jim Kelly, Minnesota's track coach, he began experimenting with technique to find a better way of throwing the discus. Kelly credited Fitch with inventing a method of throwing called the \"Minnesota Whip\", which is now the accepted style worldwide. This was a development for the sport, which frequently still had rough earth in throwing circles. It was Fitch that mastered the technique first \u2013 on June 8, 1946 he threw a discus throw world record of 54.93 m (180 ft in), bettering the mark of Adolfo Consolini by more than half a meter. He secured the United States discus title for a second time that year.UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIPS (MEN 1943\u2013). GBR Athletics. Retrieved on November 8, 2014.

He asked the Indiana athletic director if he could stop coaching to focus on his doctoral studies. The director instead offered him a position to reorganise the school's golf course, which was becoming a financial drain. Fitch accepted the position, becoming the Indiana Hoosiers head coach for golf in the process. As the head of Hoosiers golf, he transformed both the team and turned the course into a profitable venture. He led the Hoosiers to the Big Ten Conference runner-up spot in 1958 and they won the title for the first time in 1962, then again in 1968. The team topped the Big Ten championships four times in the 1970s. On top of his six conference titles, he also led the Hoosiers to the runner-up spot ten times between 1958 and 1984.

His 32 years as Hoosiers golf head coach made him the longest-tenured coach in Indiana University history.
