    "text": "Ekatarina Velika (, ), sometimes referred to as EKV for short, was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade, being one of the most successful and influential Yugoslav music acts. Initially called Katarina II (, ), the band had built up a devoted following that greatly intensified and expanded after the death of its frontman Milan Mladenovi\u0107 in 1994, which caused the band to dissolve. The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi\u0107, keyboardist Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and bassist Bojan Pe\u010dar, with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods. == History == === Post- punk years (1982\u20131986) === ====Katarina II==== In February 1982, following the disbandment of \u0160arlo Akrobata, 24-year-old guitarist and vocalist Milan Mladenovi\u0107 decided to form a new band with an old friend \u2014 22-year-old guitarist Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107. Playing music together again after being bandmates a few years earlier at Limunovo Drvo, Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 decided to name their new band Katarina II after Mihajlovi\u0107's unrequited love \u2014 a girl named Katarina. Rounding out Katarina II's inaugural lineup were Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 (another former Limunovo Drvo member) on drums and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar. During late 1982, after their performance at the Top\u010diderska zvezda cinema, the band was joined by the 23-year-old classically trained pianist Margita Stefanovi\u0107. Shortly after, the rhythm section left with Radomirovi\u0107 joining Du Du A and Dejanovi\u0107 going over to heated rivals Disciplina Ki\u010dme. The vacant drummer position was filled by Branko \"Mango\" Ku\u0161trin (formerly of Grupa I), but after he left within a month, Milan's former bandmate from \u0160arlo Akrobata Ivan \"VD\" Vdovi\u0107 became the new drummer. At the same time, in early 1983, Bojan Pe\u010dar (former VIA Talas bassist) joined on bass. In spring 1983, the band took part in Zagreb Biennale, receiving positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by actor Svetislav Gonci\u0107 on tin whistles. The recording sessions for the material were completed in Enco Lesi\u0107's Druga Maca studio, however, the material was unusable due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the studio's inferior technical equipment. The following year, the band took the offer from fellow musician and RTV Ljubljana's musical director Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107 of re-recording their debut album material in the state-owned media company's studios. Katarina II's eponymous debut album was thus released in 1984 by RTV Ljubljana's in-house record label ZKP RTLJ. Mostly featuring Mladenovi\u0107's lyrics, except for the Mihajlovi\u0107-written tracks \"Vrt\" (\"The Garden\") and \"Platforme\" (\"The Platforms\"), while the music was a collaboration between the two, the material was produced by \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 featuring guest appearances by Mario \u010celik on congas and Film member Jurij \"Kuzma Videosex\" Novoseli\u0107 on saxophone. Only 3,000 copies of the album were released, indicative of label's low commercial expectations. Though it got good reviews, receiving praise for successfully linking Mladenovi\u0107's descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound on tracks like \"Aut\" (\"Out\"), \"Jesen\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Radostan dan\" (\"A Joyful Day\"), \"Treba da se \u010disti\" (\"It Ought To Be Cleaned\"), \"Ja znam\" (\"I Know\"), Katarina II album was not a commercial success. In a 1985 interview Mladenovi\u0107 complained about the album's poor sound quality, as well as what he felt to be lack of support from the label. Soon after their debut album, the band went through more lineup changes amid disagreements and personality clashes between Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107. Mihajlovi\u0107 also ran afoul of the law \u2014 a transgression that got him a jail stint \u2014 and after serving the punishment got informed by the rest of the band he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlovi\u0107 claimed rights to the \"Katarina II\" name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with Vlada Divljan before moving to the United States where he has been residing ever since. Additionally, drummer Vdovi\u0107 left due to drug abuse problems, later joining Du Du A and the band Heroji, being replaced by the former Luna drummer Ivan \"Firchie\" Fece. The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after Catherine II of Russia, or EKV for short. Due to constant SFR Yugoslavia-wide touring, with frequent stops in Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana, and occasional TV spots, the band's popularity had gradually grown. ====Ekatarina Velika==== In early 1985, the band recorded their second studio album at SIM studio in Zagreb. Produced by Vladimir Smolec featuring guest appearances by Massimo Savi\u0107 as well as Karlowy Wary member and SIM studio co-owner Tomo in der M\u00fchlen, Ekatarina Velika gave the band with its first bona fide hits, \"O\u010di boje meda\" (\"Honey Colored Eyes\"), \"Modro i zeleno\" (\"Indigo and Green\") and \"Tattoo\". In keeping with the theme of the \"Tattoo\" track, the album cover arranged by Du\u0161an Gerzi\u0107 features the band members painted in Native American ritual body art. After the album release on 22 March 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in Turin, Italy. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of Bolje vas na\u0161li Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange. Towards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve his mandatory Yugoslav People's Army service, later joining Laboratorija Zvuka, and was replaced by Ivan \"Raka\" Rankovi\u0107 from the band Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album S vetrom uz lice (Faced Against the Wind), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenovi\u0107, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and Dragan \u010ca\u010dinovi\u0107, extensively using the E-mu Emulator II 8-bit sampler. With the hits \"Budi sam na ulici\" (\"Be Alone on the Street\"), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (\"You Are All My Anguish\"), \"Novac u rukama\" (\"Money in the Hands\"), and \"Kao da je bilo nekad\" (\"As If It Had Once Been\") came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the Simple Minds. After the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club Kulu\u0161i\u0107, made on 2 November 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album 19LIVE86. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at Dom Omladine with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Rankovi\u0107 decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. Rankovi\u0107 was replaced by the actor Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, a former Disciplina Ki\u010dme member, as drummer, playing his first show on 9 April 1987 at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in Paris. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa award for the achievements on the second and third studio album. === Alternative rock years (1987\u20131991) === During the summer of 1987, the band released the album Ljubav (Love), co-produced by the band with the Australian musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist Vuk Vidor. Prominent tracks from the album include \"Zemlja\" (\"Earth\"), \"7 Dana\" (\"7 Days\"), \"Pored mene\" (\"Beside Me\"), \"Ljudi iz gradova\" (\"People From The Cities\"), and \"Ljubav\" (\"Love\"). It had also shown the first signs of Milan's depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song \"Tonemo\" (\"We Are Sinking\"). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade's Pionir Hall sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 of Oktobar 1864 and Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 from Van Gogh to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 before moving away to New York City in May 1988. In January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album Samo par godina za nas (Only a Few Years for Us), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by Mitar Suboti\u0107 (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include \"Krug\" (\"The Circle\"), \"Par godina za nas\" (\"A Few Years for Us\"), and \"Srce\" (\"Heart\"). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in Novi Sad, the 1990 Midem festival in Cannes and the first European rock music Bienalle held in Toulouse. After the tour, Todorovi\u0107 left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pe\u010dar also decided to leave the band moving to London. The new members became the former VIA Talas, D' Boys and Piloti member Mi\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107 \"Plavi\" on bass and the former U \u0160kripcu member Marko Milivojevi\u0107 on drums. The sixth studio album Dum dum (Bang Bang), released in 1991, featured the Plejboj member Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 and session musician Bata Bo\u017eani\u0107 as bass players, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 on backing vocals, Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 on guitar and Mitar Suboti\u0107 on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs \"Zabranjujem\" (\"I Forbid\"), \"Idemo\" (\"Let's Go\"), \"Dum dum\" (\"Bang Bang\") and \"Bledo\" (\"Pale\"), inspired by the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars and the general political and economic situation in the country. The following year, Mladenovi\u0107 participated in the anti-war project Rimtutituki, also featuring Elektri\u010dni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, releasing the single \"Slu\u0161aj 'vamo\" (\"Listen Up\"). During the anti-war protests in Belgrade, the band organized a concert on the Republic Square and also they performed anti-war songs in an open truck while circulating the Belgrade streets. === Mainstream rock years (1992\u20131994) === During the middle of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragi\u0161a Uskokovi\u0107 \"\u0106ima\", with whom they recorded the final studio album Neko nas posmatra (Somebody Is Watching Us), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs \"Ponos\" (\"Pride\"), \"Jadransko more\" (\"The Adriatic Sea\"), \"Just Let Me Play Some Modern R'n'R Music\" and \"Zajedno\" (\"Together\"). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, \"Istina Ma\u0161ina\" (\"Truth Machine\"), originally performed by the Yugoslav rock band Time. The album was produced by Mladenovi\u0107 and featured Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 and a childer choir as guest performers. After the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, Elektri\u010dni Orgazam, Partibrejkers and the Zagreb band Vje\u0161tice performed in Prague and Berlin on the concerts entitled Ko to tamo pjeva (Who's That Singing Over There). At the time, Mladenovi\u0107 and Stefanovi\u0107 held occasional unplugged club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107 \"Anton\" and various jazz musicians, until Milan's departure to Brazil, where he worked on a project called Angel's Breath, together with Mitar Suboti\u0107 and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist Goran Vejvoda, they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah An\u0111ela (Angel's Breath). === Breakup and post-breakup === The band resumed their activities when Mladenovi\u0107 returned to Yugoslavia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled Ponovo zajedno (Together Again), but the idea was shelved because of Milan's health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on 24 August 1994 in Budva at the Pjesma Mediterana festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had pancreatic cancer. Barely a few months later, on 5 November 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist. Margita Stefanovi\u0107 continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanovi\u0107, as an ambiental music duo EQV, she released the album Ti si sav moj bol (You Are All My Anguish), released by the Austrian record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the Vienna Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands Direktori, Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the Elektri\u010dni Orgazam unplugged live album \u017divo i akusti\u010dno (Live and Acoustic), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights signing, she appeared in Pula with Zoran Stojanovi\u0107, the leader of the Zagreb band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with Rambo Amadeus, the first Serbian musician to play in Croatia after the Yugoslav Wars. During the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled Live '88 was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club, were announced by the rock critic Dra\u017een Vrdoljak and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release. During the same year, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 founded the record label EKV Records and started reissuing EKV studio album with bonus material. The Ljubav reissue featured live bonus material made at the Belgrade Dom Omladine on 13 November 1991 and the 1988 Novi Sad SNP performance, Samo par godina za nas featured the live bonus tracks from the Avala fest held in September 1990 and Dum dum featured alternate and demo recordings and the 1991 Dom Omladine live tracks. PGP RTS also contributed the CD reissuing by releasing the compilation album Kao nada, kao govor, kao more... (Like Hope, Like Speech, Like the Sea...) in 1997, featuring selected material from the latter four studio albums. During 2001 and 2002, EKV Records and IPS music reissued the rest of the band's catalog, also featuring bonus live material. The label also released the live album Kao u snu - EKV live 1991 (As If in a Dream - EKV Live 1991) featuring the Belgrade Dom Omladine 1991 performance. During the same year, a tribute album Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u) (As If It Had Once Been) was released. The following year, a live tribute album Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV (A Very Good Tatto - Tribute to EKV) was released. In 2017, Mascom Records released the double live album Krug (The Circle), featuring the recording of Mladenovi\u0107's and Stefanovi\u0107's unplugged performance held in Pri\u0161tina in May 1994, only half a year before Mladenovi\u0107's death.\"Nikada objavljeni snimak Ekatarine Velike: Zatvaranje \u2018Kruga\u2019\", Rockomotiva.com Ivan Vdovi\u0107 died of AIDS on 25 September 1992 at age 31.
