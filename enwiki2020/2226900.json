    "text": "The Franco-German Brigade (; ) is a special military brigade of the Eurocorps, founded in 1989, jointly consisting of units from both the French Army and the German Army. ==History== The Brigade was formed in 1987 following a summit between President Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Kohl of Germany. The Brigade became operational on October 2, 1989, under the command of General Jean-Pierre Sengeisen. Currently, the FGB is stationed at M\u00fcllheim, Metz, Donaueschingen, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Sarrebourg, and Immendingen as part of the Eurocorps. In February 2009 it was announced that a German battalion of the force was to be moved to Illkirch near Strasbourg, the first time a German unit had been stationed in France since the German occupation of World War II. On 31 October 2013, France announced that in 2014 it would shut down the 110th Infantry Regiment based in Donaueschingen and thus withdraw around 1000 men from Germany. This would leave the brigade with 4000 men, but would put an end to each country having a major presence in the other, France would be left with ~500 troops in Germany and vice versa. Since 2016, French units are part of 1st Division and German units are part of 10th Panzer Division. ==Organisation== The Franco-German Brigade parade in Reims in honor of the 50th anniversary of Franco-German friendship.
