    "text": "\"Do What U Like\" is the debut single by English boy band Take That. It was released on 12 July 1991 as the lead single from their debut studio album, Take That & Party (1992). ==Background== The song was written by Gary Barlow and Ray Hedges, and it was produced by Hedges with additional production by Graham Stack. \"Do What U Like\" was released on 15 July 1991 as the lead single from Take That's debut album Take That & Party (1992). The single was released on then-manager Nigel Martin-Smith's record label Dance U.K. and distributed by BMG (to which, through RCA Records division, later signed). The song went down in history as the first song of the band that failed to enter any list and also the only single not to be included on the band's second greatest hits compilation, Never Forget \u2013 The Ultimate Collection (2005). Originally released only on 7\" and 12\" vinyl records and as cassette single, it received a CD single reissue in 1992, from their at-time home label RCA Records, only in AustraliaTake That - Do What U Like (1992, Card Sleeve, CD) | Discogs. ==In concert== During the band's early television appearances and outdoor shows, the song was a recurring number to play. They performed it during the \"Pops\" tour with Mini-Take That, a preteen group that sang the material of the band. For the \"Nobody Else\", and the subsequent \"Ultimate Tour 2006\" and \"Beautiful World Tour 2007\", the song was never played, because the band members felt that the high energy dance choreography was not possible for them to do. However, during Take That Present: The Circus Live, it was included in a medley of their earliest singles from Take That and Party with Jason and Howard performing the complicated moves and classic routines for \"Promises\", \"It Only Takes a Minute\" and \"Take That and Party\". ==Music video== The low- budget music video for \"Do What U Like\", co-directed by former BBC Radio 1 DJ and The Old Grey Whistle Test presenter Rosemary \"Ro\" Barratt (n\u00e9e Newton) and MTV Europe director Angie Smith, was shot at Vector Television studios in Heaton Mersey on 21 June 1991.Screen Stockport TV: Take That Documentary Preview. Vimeo. 16 June 2011. Featuring the band getting naked, bare buttocks and smearing jelly over themselves, the video was banned from daytime television, and at the time was only shown on Pete Waterman's late night show The Hitman and Her. Reaction to the video (and, to an extent, the song) among the bandmates has been somewhat negative. In the documentary Take That: For the Record, Barlow admits that neither the song nor video were brilliant, but they were important in helping the band getting noticed. The video was also omitted from the 2005 video compilation Never Forget - The Ultimate Collection. Otherwise, it became available in digital distribution, streaming services and on band's official YouTube channel. ==Personnel== *Gary Barlow \u2013 lead vocals *Howard Donald \u2013 backing vocals *Jason Orange \u2013 backing vocals *Mark Owen \u2013 backing vocals *Robbie Williams \u2013 backing vocals ==Track listings== ;Austrian CD single (CDDUK2) # \"Do What U Like\" (Club Mix) \u2013 6:14 # \"Do What U Like\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:06 # \"Waiting Around\" \u2013 2:56 ;UK 7\" vinyl (DUK2) # \"Do What U Like\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:06 # \"Waiting Around\" \u2013 2:56 ;UK cassette (CADUK2) # \"Do What U Like\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:06 # \"Waiting Around\" \u2013 2:56 ;UK 12\" vinyl (12DUK2) # \"Do What U Like\" (Club Mix) \u2013 6:14 # \"Do What U Like\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:06 # \"Waiting Around\" \u2013 2:56 ==Official versions== * Radio mix (3:06) * Club mix (6:15) * 12\" mix (5:06) ==References== Category:1991 debut singles Category:1991 songs Category:Take That songs Category:Songs written by Gary Barlow Category:Songs written by Ray Hedges Category:Song recordings produced by Ray Hedges ",
