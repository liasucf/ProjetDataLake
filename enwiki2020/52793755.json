    "text": "The 2016 All-Pro teams were named by the Associated Press (AP), Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA), and Sporting News (SN) for performance in the 2016 NFL season. While none of the All-Pro teams have the official imprimatur of the NFL (whose official recognition is nomination to the 2017 Pro BowlThe 2017 Pro Bowl represents the 2016 NFL season), they are included in the NFL Record and Fact Book and also part of the language of the 2011 NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement.https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/collective- bargaining-agreement-2011-2020.pdf Any player selected to the first-team of any of the teams can be described as an \"All-Pro.\" The AP team, with first- team and second-team selections, was chosen by a national panel of fifty NFL writers and broadcasters. For the first time, the nationwide panel of 60 sports writers and broadcasters who regularly cover the NFL voted for specific positions on the offensive line, a \"flex\" player on offense, a fifth defensive back, and a punt returner and special teamer. The Sporting News All-NFL team is voted on by NFL players and executives and will be released at a later date. The PFWA team is selected by its more than 300 national members who are accredited media members covering the NFL. ==Teams== {| border=0 |- valign=\"top\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=3 style=\"background:#e3e3e3\" | Offense |- ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Position ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|First team ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Second team |- |align=center|Quarterback |Matt Ryan, Atlanta (AP, PFWA) Tom Brady, New England (SN) |Tom Brady, New England (AP-2) |- |align=center|Running back |Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas (AP, PFWA, SN) David Johnson, Arizona (PFWA, SN) |David Johnson, Arizona (AP-2) |- |align=center|Flex |David Johnson, Arizona (AP) |Le'Veon Bell, Pittsburgh (AP-2) |- |align=center|Tight end |Travis Kelce, Kansas City (AP, PFWA, SN) |Greg Olsen, Carolina (AP-2) |- |align=center|Wide receiver |Antonio Brown, Pittsburgh (AP, PFWA, SN) Julio Jones, Atlanta (AP, PFWA, SN) |Odell Beckham Jr., New York Giants (AP-2) Mike Evans, Tampa Bay (AP-2) |- |align=center|Left tackle |Tyron Smith, Dallas (AP) |David Bakhtiari, Green Bay; (AP-2) |- |align=center|Left guard |Kelechi Osemele, Oakland (AP) |Marshal Yanda, Baltimore (AP-2) |- |align=center|Center |Travis Frederick, Dallas (AP, PFWA, SN) |Alex Mack, Atlanta (AP-2) |- |align=center| Right guard |Zack Martin, Dallas (AP) |David DeCastro, Pittsburgh (AP-2) |- |align=center|Right tackle |Jack Conklin, Tennessee (AP) |Mitchell Schwartz, Kansas City (AP-2t) Marcus Cannon, New England (AP-2t) |- |align=center|Guard |Kelechi Osemele, Oakland (PFWA, SN) Zack Martin, Dallas (PFWA) Marshal Yanda, Baltimore (SN) | |- |align=center|Tackle |Tyron Smith, Dallas (PFWA, SN) Joe Thomas, Cleveland Browns (PFWA) Trent Williams, Washington Redskins (SN) | |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=3 style=\"background:#e3e3e3\" | Special teams |- ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Position ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|First team ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Second team |- |align=center|Kicker |Justin Tucker, Baltimore (AP, PFWA, SN) | |- |align=center|Punter |Johnny Hekker, Los Angeles (AP, PFWA) Pat McAfee, Indianapolis Colts (SN) |Marquette King, Oakland (AP-2) |- |align=center|Kick returner |Cordarrelle Patterson, Minnesota (AP, PFWA, SN) |Tyler Lockett, Seattle (AP-2) |- |align=center|Punt returner |Tyreek Hill, Kansas City (AP, PFWA, SN) | |- |align=center|Special teams |Matthew Slater, New England (AP, PFWA) |Nate Ebner, New England (AP-2) |- |} | style=\"padding- left:40px;\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=3 style=\"background:#e3e3e3\" | Defense |- ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Position ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|First team ! style=\"background:#e3e3e3\"|Second team |- |align=center|Edge rusher |Khalil Mack, Oakland (AP, PFWA, SN) Vic Beasley, Atlanta (AP, PFWA-OLB) Jadeveon Clowney, Houston (PFWA, SN) |Cameron Wake, Miami (AP-2t) Olivier Vernon, New York Giants (AP-2t) Brandon Graham, Philadelphia (AP-2t) Jadeveon Clowney, Houston (AP-2t) |- |align=center|Interior lineman |Aaron Donald, Los Angeles (AP, PFWA, SN) Damon Harrison, New York Giants (AP, PFWA) Geno Atkins, Cincinnati Bengals (SN) |Ndamukong Suh, Miami (AP-2) Calais Campbell, Arizona Cardinals (AP-2t) Gerald McCoy, Tampa Bay (AP-2t) |- |align=center|Linebacker |Von Miller, Denver (AP, PFWA, SN) Bobby Wagner, Seattle (AP, PFWA, SN) Sean Lee, Dallas (AP) Luke Kuechly, Carolina (SN) |Lorenzo Alexander, Buffalo (AP-2) Luke Kuechly, Carolina (AP-2) Lavonte David, Tampa Bay (AP-2t) C.J.
