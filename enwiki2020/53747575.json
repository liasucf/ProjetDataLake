    "text": "\"Element\" (stylized as \"ELEMENT.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The fourth track on the album (eleventh on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song was written by Lamar, Mark Spears, Sounwave, James Blake, and Ricci Riera and produced by Sounwave, Blake, and Riera, with additional production by Tae Beast and B\u0113kon. The song charted in multiple countries in 2017. == Background == The song was first introduced by basketball player LeBron James on his Instagram story when he filmed himself dancing to the song prior to Damn's release. == Lyrics == The track opens with a skit from DJ Kid Capri, who refers to Lamar as \"Kung Fu Kenny\u201d. Afterwards Kendrick Lamar repeats the phrase \"I don't give a fuck\", before the first verse starts. Some sources have interpreted the song as a diss track on American rappers Big Sean and Drake. However, Andres Tardio of Rap-Up has stated the song's hook as a possible diss on Drake, Big Sean, or American recording artist Jay Electronica. The second verse of the song has been described to have a resemblance to Lamar's \"The Heart Part 4\", a song also theorized to have contained lyrics that diss Drake and Big Sean. The second verse as follows: == Production == The song features production from musician and producer James Blake, who before \"Element\" appeared as a featured vocalist on American singer Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Forward\" from her sixth studio album Lemonade and as a producer on singer Frank Ocean's second studio album Blonde. Ricci Riera, who previously worked as a producer on the Lamar-Schoolboy Q collaboration \"Collard Greens\", also worked as producer for the song. ==Music video== The song's accompanying music video premiered on June 27, 2017 on Lamar's Vevo channel on YouTube. The video was directed by Jonas Lindstroem and The Little Homies (pseudonyms for Lamar himself and Dave Free). Described as violent and powerful, the music video contains powerful imagery, some of which contains direct references to photographs of civil rights photographer, musician, writer, and director Gordon Parks. The video also mimics the imagery from the music video for \"Humble\", the first single from Damn. The music video has received positive reviews. Lawrence Burney of noisey called the video \"the masterpiece you anticipated.\" == Critical reception == Joe Price of Pigeons and Planes named \"Element\" as one of the best songs of the week, the week of April 14, 2017, saying the song has \"memorable verses and a sticky hook over some sparse but gorgeous production.\" Continuing, Price says \"Element\" is \"a prime example of what makes Damn an immediately appealing body of work that is just as rewarding as his more challenging output.\" Meave McDermott of USA Today, in a positive review, said the song \"still sounds sharp and unforgiving even when he's coining catchphrases.\" == Live performances == Lamar performed \"Element\" for the first time live at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 23, 2017. His performance at Coachella was highly acclaimed, with the L.A. Times describing his performance as \"simple, yet powerful.\" Lamar has performed \"Element\" on the Damn tour. == Sample == The song contains a sample of \"Ha\" by rapper Juvenile, from his third studio album 400 Degreez. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official Damn digital booklet. *Kendrick Lamar \u2013 songwriter *Mark Spears \u2013 songwriter, producer *James Blake \u2013 songwriter, producer *Ricci Riera \u2013 songwriter, producer *Tae Beast \u2013 additional production *B\u0113kon \u2013 additional production *Kid Capri \u2013 additional vocals *Matt Schaeffer \u2013 mixing *James Hunt \u2013 mixing *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mix assistant *Cyrus Taghipour \u2013 mix assistant *Zeke Mishanec \u2013 additional recording *Brendan Silas Perry \u2013 additional recording ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 17 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 23 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 16 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) !scope=\"col\"| Position |- !scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 76 |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) !scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 2157 |} ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by Sounwave Category:Songs written by James Blake (musician) ",
