    "text": "The Lithuanian Nationalist Union ( or LTS), also known as the Nationalists (), was the ruling political party in Lithuania during the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona from 1926 to 1940. The party was established in 1924 but was not popular. It came to power as a result of the December 1926 military coup. From 1927 to 1939, the Council of Ministers included only members of the LTS. In 1936, other parties were officially disbanded leaving LTS the only legal party in the country. In 1930s, the party became increasingly more radical and sympathetic to the Italian Fascism. The party was disestablished after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. The party under the same name (known as the Lithuanian Nationalist and Republican Union since 2017) was reestablished in 1990 and claims to be the successor of interwar LTS. ==History== The party was established during a conference in \u0160iauliai on 17\u201319 August 1924 as a merger of the Party of National Progress (established in 1916) and the Lithuanian Farmers' Association (established in 1919). The party did not enjoy popular support and in the May 1926 parliamentary elections won only 3 seats out of 85. However, its leaders Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras were popular and influential public figures. The party was conservative and nationalistic; it stressed the need for a strong army and a strong leader. During the December 1926 coup, the military deposed the democratically elected government and invited Smetona to become the new President of Lithuania and Voldemaras the new Prime Minister. The Nationalists and the Lithuanian Christian Democrats formed a new government. However, the relationship between the two parties soon became tense as Christian Democrats regarded the coup as a temporary measure and wished to hold new elections to the Seimas. In April 1927, Smetona dissolved the Seimas and Christian Democrats resigned from the government in May. New elections to Seimas were not called until 1936. The Nationalists remained the only party in the government until a political crisis after the German ultimatum regarding Klaip\u0117da Region forced LTS to admit two members of the opposition to the Council of Ministers. Voldemaras established Iron Wolf (Gele\u017einis Vilkas) as the paramilitary wing of the Nationalists. In September 1929, Smetona removed Voldemaras from the office of prime minister and installed his co-brother-in-law Juozas T\u016bbelis. The new constitutions of 1928 and 1938 established a presidential dictatorship. Political opponents were suppressed. In preparation for the June 1936 election, other political parties were banned leaving LTS the only legal party in Lithuania. In 1930s, the party became increasingly more radical and sympathetic to the Italian Fascism. Major periodicals published by the party included Lietuvis (1924\u201328), Lietuvos aidas (1928\u201340), M\u016bs\u0173 kra\u0161tas (1930\u201333), and Vairas (1914\u201340). ==Chairmen== The party's chairmen were: * Vincas Kr\u0117v\u0117-Mickevi\u010dius (19 August 1924 \u2013 29 June 1925) * Antanas Smetona (29 June 1925 \u2013 26 December 1926) * Liudas Noreika (26 December 1926 \u2013 4 August 1927) * Vincas Matulaitis (4 August 1927 \u2013 1 October 1927) * Aleksandras \u017dilinskas (5 October 1927 \u2013 1 February 1928) * Liudas Noreika (1 February 1928 \u2013 30 May 1928) * Vytautas Vilei\u0161is (30 May 1928 \u2013 2 October 1929) * Jonas Lap\u0117nas (2 October 1929 \u2013 1 June 1931) * Juozas T\u016bbelis (1 June 1931 \u2013 5 January 1939) * Vladas Mironas (5 January 1939 \u2013 2 December 1939) * Domas Cesevi\u010dius (2 December 1939 \u2013 19 June 1940) ==References== Category:Nationalist parties in Lithuania Category:National conservative parties Category:Political parties in Lithuania Category:Political parties established in 1924 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1940 Category:1924 establishments in Lithuania Category:1940 disestablishments in Lithuania Category:Parties of one-party systems ",
