The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Railway. ==History== The station was opened in 1859 on the Cannock Mineral Railway's line from to and taken over by the London and North Western Railway a decade laterCannock Chase History - Railways Stations around Cannock Chase www.cannockchasehistory.org; Retrieved 2013-08-30 (though the LNWR had worked the line from the outset). It closed to passengers on 18 January 1965 and to goods traffic on 6 September the same year as a result of the Beeching Axe, though the line that passed through remained in use for goods & mineral traffic, serving the power station at Rugeley and various local collieries. The station reopened in 1989 by British Rail, as the terminus of the first stage of the reopening of the Chase Line from Walsall to passenger trains. At first, there was just a single platform (the current Walsall-bound one); however when services were extended to Rugeley Town in 1997, a second platform was added. There is no ticket office so the Penalty fare scheme operates at the station, and passengers must buy a ticket or permit to travel from the machines at the station to avoid paying the \u00a320 surcharge.West Midlands Railway Penalty Fares West Midlands Railway; Retrieved 7 April 2019 Hednesford is the only station not located in the West Midlands to be part of the West Midlands Trains free travel zone, situated in Zone 5 of the West Midlands railway network.
