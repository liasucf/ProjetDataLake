    "text": "Virtual cinema is a video-on-demand streaming service facilitated by independent film distributors and art-house theaters to release new films and share profits. Under the service, part of the admission price supports a physically-located theater. As a result of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, movie theaters were closed down for public safety. In 2020 from March through April, virtual cinema proliferated during the theaters' closures. Several distributors of independent films, including Kino Lorber, Film Movement, and Music Box Films, were early adopters. The initiative grew to involve theater chains and film festivals that were affected by the pandemic. Major specialty chains Alamo Drafthouse and Laemmle Theaters began partnering with the distributors. The strategy is recognized as a way for distributors to make up for lost box office sales and to empower moviegoers to support their local theater. ==References== Category:Film distribution Category:Video on demand services ",
