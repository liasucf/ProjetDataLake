A disciple of Murata Juk\u014d, he was the recipient of Juk\u014d's treatise on the tea ceremony, Kokoro no fumi (\u5fc3\u306e\u624b\u7d19 \"Letter of the heart\"). He also received the Shinkei S\u014dzu Teikin, an essay on the composition of renga poetry, from Inawashiro Kensai. Ch\u014din was an acolyte at the temple at K\u014dfuku-ji, having been sent to study there at the age of 13. Ten years later, he became the leader of a group of warrior monks. He later became daimy\u014d of Furuichi, a small town near Nara, and his family developed a reputation as patrons of the arts. Ch\u014din and his brother Ch\u014dei developed the practice of rinkan chanoyu (combining the tea ceremony with the practice of communal bathing). ==References== Category:Chad\u014d Category:1452 births Category:1508 deaths Category:Daimyo ",
