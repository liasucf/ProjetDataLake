    "text": "Abbots Deuglie is a hamlet in the Scottish region of Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It is located in the Ochil Hills, in Arngask parish, about west of Glenfarg. Glenfarg Reservoir lies just to the west of the village, and was built in 1912. The site is noted for two Neolithic sites, Abbot's Deuglie stone circle, which is now virtually unrecognisable as an archaeological site due to the removal of the stones from it, and a single standing stone at West Blair, south of the village. ==References== Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross ",
