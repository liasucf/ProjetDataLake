    "text": "Theodora of Bulgaria (Bulgarian and ) was a Bulgarian princess and Queen consort of Serbia, the first wife of Stefan Uro\u0161 III De\u010danski. She was the second daughter of Tsar Smilets of Bulgaria and Smiltsena Palaiologina. She is best remembered as a patron of the Arts, Music and Literature. Among her heirloom, one of the most famous rings from the fourtheenth century was found, now on display in the National Museum in Belgrade. That golden ring has the carved inscription: \"May the Lord help the one who wears it.\"Jovan Jani\u0107ijevi\u0107, The cultural treasury of Serbia, IDEA Books, 1998 - History, pp. 249 Teodora married Serbian crown prince (later king) Stefan Uro\u0161 III (called De\u010danski) on 24 August 1296. They had two children: future Tsar (Emperor) Stefan Du\u0161an and Du\u0161ica. In 1314 her husband's father Stefan Milutin quarreled with Stefan, and sent him to Constantinople to be blinded. Teodora and the family went with him and established a household there until 1320 when they were allowed to return. She was present at the state assembly of 6 January 1322, when her son Du\u0161an was crowned Young king. In this period, De\u010danski and Teodora were divorced. It is very likely that, between the death of Milutin (29 October 1321) and the crowning of Du\u0161an, it was decided that Teodora be divorced from her husband due to the fact that Teodora's father's family had by then been expelled from Bulgaria, and De\u010danski sought to empower himself by marrying into the Byzantine royal family. He then married Maria Palaiologina. It is still unknown when Teodora died. She was alive on 6 January 1322, and according to M. Vuki\u0107evi\u0107 and S. \u0106osovi\u0107 died prior to January 1323. Historian Stojan Novakovi\u0107 earlier based the death in the winter of 1322\u201323 on the talks of De\u010danski marrying Phillip of Tarento in the beginning of 1323. Other believe she lived longer, possibly marrying Jovan Dragoslav between 1322 and 1326. It is believed she was buried in the Banjska monastery. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:13th-century Bulgarian people Category:14th-century Bulgarian people Category:14th-century Serbian royalty Category:Serbian queens consort Category:Bulgarian royalty Category:Bulgarian princesses Category:Medieval Serbian royal consorts Category:People of the Kingdom of Serbia (medieval) Category:Smilets dynasty Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1322 deaths Category:14th-century Bulgarian women Category:13th- century Bulgarian women Category:14th-century Serbian people Category:14th- century Serbian women ",
