According to her daughter, filmmaker Joan Churchill, Huettig \"was an activist who was named by the Senate McClellan committee as one of the 10 most subversive people in the country. She was considered a Commie and was harassed by HUAC. We had to move to Ojai, a valley directly east of Santa Barbara, when I was 11. We basically got run out of town.\" After the Watts uprising in 1965, Huettig became involved in political activism, focusing on police violence and voting abuses, researching and providing information to train young people to recognize and report discriminatory behavior by the police or other public agencies. Huettig also worked on campaigns to desegregate Pasadena Public Schools and to disband the LAPD's Public Disorder and Intelligence Division. == Personal life == In 1944, she returned to Southern California, where she divorced Lester Huettig. With her second husband, Robert Churchill, founder of Churchill Films (which produced educational films), she had two children, Joan and Jim. == References == Category:1911 births Category:American economists Category:American women economists Category:1996 deaths ",
