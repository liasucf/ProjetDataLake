Its objective was to deal with the issues arising from the military control of the country by mainly Italian and secondarily French troops and its political leadership by the pro-Italian Durr\u00ebs-based government. Held in the residence of Kaso Fuga it was attended by 56 delegates from Albania, adjacent Albanian-inhabited territories and representatives of Albanian emigrant colonies. Aqif Elbasani was elected president of the congress and Ferit Vokopola secretary. The congress declared the Durr\u00ebs government invalid and formed a new cabinet under Sulejman Delvina. The new government consisted of the High Council () the National Council (). The last decision of the congress was the designation of Tiran\u00eb as the new capital of Albania. The congress's decisions would eventually lead a few months later to the Vlora War and as a result to the total withdrawal of the Italian army from Albania and the final affirmation of the country's territorial integrity in 1921. The building where it was held became a museum in 1970. == Background == ==Preparations == ==Participants== Members of the initiatory commission are listed below: ==Event== January 28th 1920, after the meeting == Decisions == The Congress was also concerned with the Government of Durr\u00ebs that had the backing of the invading Italian army. It was alleged that Abdyl Ypi, the initiator of the Congress, had been assassinated by members of the Government of Durr\u00ebs, who wanted to scare off the other delegates to the Congress. During its first session, the Congress decided unanimously on the downing of the Government of Durr\u00ebs and the organization of armed against the Italian forces that were in control of part of southern Albania. The High Council was made up of Luigj Bum\u00e7i, Aqif Pash\u00eb Elbasani, Abdi Toptani, and Mihal Turtulli who would perform the function of the leaders of the new Albanian state, whereas the National Council would function as the Parliament. The congress's decisions would eventually lead a few months later to the Vlora War and as a result to the total withdrawal of the Italian army from Albania. == Aftermath == == Legacy == ==Cabinet== * Sulejman Delvina, Prime Minister * Ahmet Zogu \u2013 Minister of Internal Affairs * Mehmed Konica \u2013 Minister of Foreign Affairs * Kadri Prishtina \u2013 Minister of Justice * Ndoc \u00c7oba \u2013 Minister of Finance * Sotir Pe\u00e7i \u2013 Minister of Education * Ali Riza Kolonja \u2013 Minister of War * Eshref Frash\u00ebri \u2013 General Director of Public Works * Idhomen Kosturi \u2013 General Director of the Post-Telegraph Agency. ==See also== *Congress of Durr\u00ebs *Albanian Congress of Trieste *Congress of Dibra *League of Prizren ==References== Category:1920 in Albania Category:Modern history of Albania Category:1920 conferences ",
