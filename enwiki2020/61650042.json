The community is located northwest of French Settlement and east of Port Vincent. ==History== An early settler named Calvin Doris Bowman scouted the area sometime in the 1830s and exclaimed to his companions, \"This is just about the poliest place I ever saw.\" and that was the name given to the area. A post office was built here on December 31, 1909 and a man named Martin L. Bowman was appointed as the first postmaster. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Livingston Parish, Louisiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Louisiana ",
