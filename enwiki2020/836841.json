He was a weather god considered responsible for the fertility of vegetation and esteemed as King of the Gods. He was depicted as a bearded older man with curling ram's horns.Brouillet, Monique Seefried, ed. From Hannibal to Saint Augustine: Ancient Art of North Africa from the Musee du Louvre. Michael C. Carlos Museum, Emory University: Atlanta GA, 1994. Ba\u02bfal \u1e24ammon's female cult partner was Tanit.Serge Lancel. Carthage: A History. p. 195. ==Etymology== He is clearly identified as one of the Phoenician deities covered under the name of Baal. However, the meaning of his second name is unclear. Frank Moore Cross argued for a connection to Ham\u014dn, the Ugaritic name for Mount Amanus, a peak in the Nur Mountains which separate Syria from Cilicia. In the 19th century, when Ernest Renan excavated the ruins of Hammon (\u1e24ammon), the modern Umm al-\u2018Awamid between Tyre and Acre, he found two Phoenician inscriptions dedicated to El-Hammon. Others have proposed Hammon as a syncretic association with Libyan-Egyptian god Amun,S. G. F. Brandon, Dictionary of Comparative Religion, 1970, Littlehampton, 978-0297000440 while a last current has called instead for a connection with the Northwest Semitic word \u1e25amm\u0101n (\"brazier\"), suggesting the sense \"Lord of the Brazier\". ==Cult and attributes== The worship of Ba\u02bfal Hammon flourished in the Phoenician colony of Carthage. His supremacy among the Carthaginian gods is believed to date to the fifth century BC, after relations between Carthage and Tyre were broken off at the time of the Battle of Himera (480 BC).Moscati, Sabatino (2001). The Phoenicians. Tauris, p. 132. Baal Hammon was known as the Chief of the pantheon of Carthage and the deity that made vegetation grow; as with most deities of Carthage, his powers relied on child sacrifice. He has been identified with a solar deity,Walbank, Frank William (1979). A Historical Commentary on Polybius, Volume 2, Clarendon Press, p. 47 although Yigael Yadin thought him to be a moon god. Edward Lipinski identifies him with the god Dagon.Edward Lipinski, Dictionnaire de la civilisation phenicienne et punique (1992: ). In Carthage and North Africa Ba\u02bfal Hammon was especially associated with the ram and was worshiped also as Ba\u02bfal Qarnaim (\"Lord of Two Horns\") in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Boukornine (\"the two-horned hill\") across the bay from Carthage, in Tunisia.Roberto Peter Bongiovanni (2014). \"The Interchange of Plain Velar and Aspirate in Kronos/Chronos: A Case for Etymological Equivalence\". Master's thesis at City University of New York. The interpretatio graeca identified him with the Titan Cronus. In ancient Rome, he was identified with Saturn, and the cultural exchange between Rome and Carthage as a result of the Second Punic War may have influenced the development of the festival of Saturnalia.Robert E.A. Palmer, Rome and Carthage at Peace (Franz Steiner, 1997), pp. 63\u201364. Greco-Roman sources report that the Carthaginians burned their children as offerings to Ba\u02bfal Hammon. (See \"Moloch\" for a discussion of these traditions and conflicting thoughts on the matter.) Attributes of his Romanized form as an African Saturn indicate that Hammon (Amunus in Philo's work) was a fertility god.Serge Lancel (1995). Carthage: A History, p197. An incense burner depicting Ba'al-Hamon, 2nd century BC ==Location== Ba'al Hamon was a place mentioned in the Song of Solomon.. It was the location of a productive vineyard owned by Solomon, who let out the vineyard to tenants, each of whom was to bring him a thousand silver shekels. The locale has been supposed to be identical with Baal-gad, and also with Hammon in the tribe of Asher. ==See also== * Carthaginian religion ==References== ==External links== *On-line parallel Bible: Song of Solomon 8:11 Category:Hebrew Bible places Category:Child sacrifice Category:Carthaginian mythology Category:West Semitic gods Category:Cronus Category:Saturn (mythology) Category:Horned deities Category:Baal Category:Saturnian deities ",
