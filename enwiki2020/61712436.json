    "text": "Peter J. Uggowitzer (born November 24, 1950 in Klagenfurt) is an Austrian- Swiss metallurgist and materials scientist. == Academic Life == He studied materials science at the Montanuniversit\u00e4t Leoben until 1976, where he earned his doctorate in 1981 in the field of dual-phase steels. He then moved to ETH Zurich, where he earned his habilitation in 1993 and became a professor in 1996 . His scientific work includes Ni-free austenitic steels, which have found wide application in medicine and watch industries. He has also published significant works on the aging behavior of Al-Mg-Si alloys and on magnesium alloys . Peter and co-authors discovered late in 2019 that the phenomenon of ageing of aluminium alloys does not occur at the atomic scale. Uggowitzer is married and the father of three adult children. == Awards == * 1987: Masing Memorial Prize of the German Society for Materials Science * 2014: Tammann commemorative coin of the German Society for Materials Science == References == Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Klagenfurt Category:ETH Zurich alumni Category:ETH Zurich faculty Category:Austrian metallurgists Category:University of Leoben alumni ",
