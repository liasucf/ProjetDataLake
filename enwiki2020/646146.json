    "text": "Westfields Football Club is a football team from Hereford, England, formed in 1966 and currently playing in the . The club is affiliated to the Herefordshire County FA. ==History== Westfields FC were formed in November 1966 by a group of local youths who played friendlies on Widemarsh Common. One of the youths, Andy Morris, is still involved with the club and is now its chief executive. Westfields initially entered the Herefordshire Sunday League, where they played for ten years, winning a number of trophies. In 1973, they fielded their first Saturday team in the Worcester and District League. Two years later they moved their ground from the King George V playing fields to Thorn Lighting's Rotherwas headquarters where they gradually developed the ground over the subsequent years. In 1978 the club stepped up to the West Midlands (Regional) League, initially in Division Two. Promotion to Division One came in 1983\u201384, followed by a further step up to the Premier Division three years later. The 2002\u201303 season saw the Fields do a league and county cup double, becoming the West Midlands Regional League Premier Division champions for the first time and defeating rivals Kington Town to win the Herefordshire County Senior Challenge Cup. The title win saw them promoted to the Midland Alliance, where they finished sixth in their first season, although their second season saw them flirt with relegation before finishing in 20th position. In the 2015\u201316 season, Westfields progressed through to the Herefordshire County Cup Final at Edgar Street, but lost to newly-formed Hereford F.C. of the Midland Football League. During the 2016\u201317 season they qualified for the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history where they played Curzon Ashton and were knocked out after losing 3\u20131 in a replay after drawing 1\u20131 initially at home. ==Colours== Westfields took their claret and blue colours from West Ham United, as its founders admired Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Sir Geoff Hurst, who were part of the England squad that won the World Cup in the year they were founded. ==Ground== After playing for many years at the sports ground of Thorn Lighting on the Rotherwas Industrial Estate to the south of Hereford, Westfields began their first Midland Alliance campaign playing their home games at Stourport Swifts' Walshes Meadow ground. The Fields moved to a new \u00a3250,000 ground in the heart of the city in December 2003. The new ground gained the rather unusual name of allpay.park thanks to a sponsorship deal with Hereford-based firm allpay.net. ==Current squad== ===Backroom staff=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#00f;\"scope=\"col\"|Position ! style=\"background:#00f;\"scope=\"col\"|Name |- | Manager || Phil Glover |- | Assistant Manager || Paul Willetts |- | Coach || Scott Jackson |- | Goalkeeper Coach || Rory Hollingshead |- |} ==Club records== Coventry Sphinx *Best league performance: 2nd in Midland Football Alliance, 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313 *Best FA Cup performance: First Round Proper, 2016\u201317 *Best FA Vase performance: Fourth round, 1986\u201387, 2013\u201314 * Record attendance: 1825 against Hereford 31 August 2015 ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Official website Category:Association football clubs established in 1966 Category:Midland Football Alliance Category:Football clubs in Herefordshire Category:1966 establishments in England Category:Midland Football League Category:West Midlands (Regional) League Category:Football clubs in England Category:Hellenic Football League ",
