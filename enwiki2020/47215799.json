    "text": "Behind Enemy Lines is the debut album by the Christian metalcore band, Saving Grace. It is the only album the band released signed under the label Harvest Earth Records. ==Critical reception== Reception for the album has been generally positive, though its tendency to veer into predictability has been pointed out. Christian music website, New Release Tuesday praised the album, calling it \"Bold, brutal and 100 percent in your face... an album which will have hardcore and metal kids alike craving more.\" Erik Thomas of Lastrites wrote \"this kind of stuff has been done to death, but this is definitely one of the better examples I've heard, even more so considering the origin\". Sputnik Music commented that though the album falls into the trap of being too repetitive, as is often the case with its genre, \"this is a great band and album...the best part are the lyrics that advise listeners to believe in themselves no matter what.\" ==Track listing== ==Credits== Saving Grace * Nicholas Tauthi - Vocals * Vasely Sapanov - Guitar * George White - Bass * Benjamin Davidson - Drums Production * Colin Davis - Mastering * Dave Quiggle - Artwork ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Saving Grace (band) albums ",
