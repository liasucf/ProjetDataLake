It plays in the 1920 Olympic Games Stadium named the \"Kiel\". After many financial problems over the years, the club was forced to retire from competition and was dissolved in 1999. Shortly after, K.F.C. Germinal Ekeren moved from Ekeren in the north of Antwerp to the south in order to install at the \"Kiel\". The club changed its name and became Germinal Beerschot, before the name was changed again in 2011 to Beerschot AC. In 2013, Beerschot AC went bankrupt and dissolved. A new team emerged: Beerschot. == Honours == *Belgian First Division: **Winners (7): 1921\u201322, 1923\u201324, 1924\u201325, 1925\u201326, 1927\u201328, 1937\u201338, 1938\u201339 **Runners-up (7): 1900\u201301, 1922\u201323, 1926\u201327, 1928\u201329, 1936\u201337, 1941\u201342, 1942\u201343 *Belgian Second Division: **Winners (1): 1906\u201307 **Runners-up (3): 1981\u201382, 1992\u201393, 1994\u201395 *Belgian Second Division Final Round: **Winners (1): 1982 *Belgian Cup: **Winners (2): 1970\u201371, 1978\u201379 **Runners-up (1): 1967\u201368 == European cup history == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
