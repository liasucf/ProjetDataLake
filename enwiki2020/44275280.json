He and bassist P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m formed the band in 1999. ==Early life== Brod\u00e9n's father, Ulf Olof Brod\u00e9n, is from Sweden and his mother, Anna, is from former Czechoslovakia. He holds dual citizenship in Sweden and the Czech Republic. He has said that he became a metalhead when he was three or four years old because of the music video for Twisted Sister's \"We're Not Gonna Take It\". He was a competitive swimmer in his youth.https://www.youtube.com/xJk0KmXYniQ ==Career== Brod\u00e9n's first band was called Stormwind, in which he played keyboards. Brod\u00e9n founded Sabaton in 1999 with bassist P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m; he is the lead vocalist and keyboardist and an occasional third guitarist. He is also the one who came up with the name \"Sabaton\" for the band. Brod\u00e9n is known for wearing an unusual vest with metal plates when performing with Sabaton; it has been described as resembling a bulletproof vest. He is also known for his distinctive mohawk hairstyle and \"squared\" facial hair. He is a baritone. In 2015, Brod\u00e9n made a bet with his bandmates that committed him to traveling to Sabaton's next gig on foot; he had not realized their next engagement was in Trondheim, Norway, some 350 miles (560 km) away. Brod\u00e9n stayed in the homes of several fans along the way. On 26 November 2016, Brod\u00e9n entered the \u010cesk\u00fd slav\u00edk singing competition in the Czech Republic and was voted into fifth place with 9,286 points. The next year he entered again, but was removed from the competition due to a new rule that competitors had to primarily perform in the Czech Republic. ==Pinball== In 2016 and 2017, Brod\u00e9n took part in the Swedish national pinball championships, placing 167th the first time and 255th the second time. ==Discography== Brod\u00e9n performing at Wacken Open Air in 2013 ;Sabaton *Primo Victoria (2005) *Attero Dominatus (2006) *Metalizer (2007) *The Art of War (2008) *Coat of Arms (2010) *Carolus Rex (2012) *Heroes (2014) * The Last Stand (2016) * The Great War (2019) ;Guest appearances :{|class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Band |- |\"Lament for Soldier's Glory\" |Desert |- |\"Gates of Glory\" |Twilight Force |- |\"Rise of the Wise\" |Wisdom |- |\"Primo Victoria\" (Sabaton cover) |Van Canto |- |\"Call Me\" |Pain |- |\"Ibor & Aio\" |Hulkoff |- |\"Pumping Iron Power\" |Grailknights |- |\"Heroes of Mighty Magic\" |Twilight Force |- |\"Oh!
