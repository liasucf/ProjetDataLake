    "text": "The Kirti Chakra is an Indian military decoration awarded for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice away from the field of battle. It may be awarded to civilians as well as military personnel, including posthumous awards. It is the peacetime equivalent of the Maha Vir Chakra. It is second in order of precedence of peacetime gallantry awards; it comes after Ashoka Chakra and before Shaurya Chakra. Before 1967, the award was known as the Ashoka Chakra, Class II. == History == Established as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class II\" by the President of India, 4 January 1952 (with effect from 15 August 1947). The statutes were revised and the decoration renamed on 27 January 1967. To understand the award better, a sample recipient would be No. 18161 Naik Mukhtiar Singh, 4 J. & K. Infantry (to date from 19 March 1956). > \"On the night of 18/19 March 1956, the position occupied by our troops on > the Bela at Hussainiwala Headworks, near Ferozepore on the Indo-Pakistani > Border was attacked. Approximately one platoon of attackers managed to > secure a foothold on the Bela from the left flank. On being ordered by his > platoon commander to take his section to the threatened flank and stem the > advance, No. 18161 Naik Mukhtiar Singh personally led his section through > heavy automatic fire. He inflicted two casualties on the attackers, captured > their rifles and led his section up to the right Guide Bund and secured his > objective. Whilst his section was securing the objective on the Bund, a hand > grenade landed near him in the midst of his section. To save his section, he > lifted the grenade with his left hand and tried to throw it back on the > attackers. The grenade exploded in the meantime and his left elbow was blown > off. Though seriously wounded he continued to exhort his men to fight on and > refused to be evacuated. No. 18161 Naik Mukhtiar Singh by his high example > of personal leadership, courage and complete disregard for his personal > safety averted a disaster to his section and to the Bela Position.\"No. > 4-Pres/57 of 26 January 1957, in Gazette of India, part I, section 1, 26 > January 1957, p. 22. == Design == Medal : It is circular in shape and is made of standard silver, one and three eight inches in diameter.
