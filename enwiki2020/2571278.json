The route, a major non-freeway corridor connecting the Lehigh Valley to The Poconos in eastern Pennsylvania, is designated from U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Brodhead to the New York state line over the Delaware River at Hancock, New York. Commissioned on April 17, 1961, the route replaced the PA 12 and PA 90 numbers that were in place from the late 1920s to the 1960s. From 1961 to 1976, PA 191 was routed south of US 22 through Bethlehem and terminated at PA 309 in Center Valley. PA 378 replaced the designation from Center Valley to the Lehigh River crossing in Bethlehem. ==Route description== ===Northampton County=== PA 191 passes through the woods of Washington Township PA 191 begins at an interchange with the US 22 freeway in Bethlehem Township, Northampton County in the Lehigh Valley, where the road continues south as Nazareth Pike to the city of Bethlehem, where it becomes Linden Street.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the first 191 number was designated from the Baltimore Pike in Clifton Heights to Penrose Avenue in southwest Philadelphia. The first state highway numbers to be assigned on the modern PA 191 were Pennsylvania Route 12 and Pennsylvania Route 90. PA 90 was designated from Stroudsburg to the New York-Pennsylvania border. The section from Center Valley to Stockertown was designated as part of PA 12 (which then went north to Wind Gap and Saylorsburg). From the 1920s to the 1940s, the designation between Stockertown and Stroudsburg had no signed traffic route. When both routes were commissioned, several spurs were as well. For Route 90, the following spurs were assigned in The Poconos region: Pennsylvania Routes 190, 290, 390, 490, 590, and 690. For Route 12, the following spurs were assigned in The Poconos and Lehigh Valley regions: Pennsylvania Routes 212, 312, 412, 512, 612, and 712. In April 1935, PA 12 was extended north to US 611 in Bartonsville, filling a gap between Snydersville and Bartonsville. By 1950, PA 90 was extended south to Easton, including the highway between Stroudsburg and Stockertown. On April 17, 1961, PA 191 was commissioned from the New York state line to U.S. Route 309 in Center Valley. The route replaced PA 12 south of Stockertown (the rest would be superseded by the Route 33 freeway) and PA 90 north of Stockertown (the rest remained part of Route 115 until 1972). In Bethlehem, PA 191 was designated onto Wyandotte Street, crossed the Lehigh River, went onto Main Street, turned onto Elizabeth Avenue, and turned onto Linden Street or Nazareth-Bethlehem Pike north of the city. PA 191 was designated to replace PA 12 and PA 90 in order to provide a continuous route between Center Valley and the New York border as well as to reduce confusion with I-90 in the northwest part of the state. By 1970, when Pennsylvania Route 378 was commissioned, PA 191 moved designations slightly in Bethlehem. Southbound 191 came from Nazareth, as Linden Street, and in Bethlehem, it turned west onto Union Boulevard. After it passed underneath I-378, the route turned south onto 3rd Avenue then onto the I-378 freeway. I-378 terminated at the bridge that crosses the Lehigh River and it continued as PA 191 (Wyandotte Street). By 1976, PA 191 was truncated to end at its current location and Pennsylvania Route 378 (formerly I-378) replaced its former routing from the Lehigh River bridge to Pennsylvania Route 309 in Center Valley. ==Major intersections== ==PA 191 Truck== Pennsylvania Route 191 Truck was a route that followed PA 248, PA 33, and the exit slip-ramps at the PA 33-PA 191 interchange. It was signed in 2014. Signs were removed and PA 191 Truck was decommissioned in 2016. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Pennsylvania Highways: PA 151 - 200 *PA State Route 191 Ends *PA Routes 191-200 - Central PA/MD Routes 191 Category:Transportation in Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Wayne County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Pike County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Northampton County, Pennsylvania ",
