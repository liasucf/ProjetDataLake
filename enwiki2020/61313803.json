    "text": "Righter is a dating app targeted at American conservatives. It was founded by former banker Christy Edwards Lawton, in order to create a dating app for Trump supporters who felt rejected by apps like Tinder and Bumble. It is amongst a new wave of apps allegining discrimination against conservatives, including Donald Daters and Conservatives Only. The app is notable for embracing politically incorrect rhetoric, both in order to express conservative values and to draw media attention. For example, it is the expectation that men shall pay on the first date when Righter is used, and only two gender identities may be selected on the app (the binary 'male' and 'female'). The app garnered more controversy when the founder threatened to sue liberals who tried to \"infiltrate\" the app, a move that founder Lawton stands by. ==Values== Christy Edwards Lawton founded Righter in order to fill a void for conservative dating apps. With this, there were many conservative values that she saw as being a priority for the new app. Lawton has claimed that conservatives \"have better sex than liberals\", claiming \"more meaningful sex\" and \"better orgasms\". The app is against the transgender community, only allowing two gender identities on the app. Additionally, the app was built for heterosexual couples, and has been accused of being homophobic. The founder has said that women must \"close their legs\", and \"be feminine\" rather than feminist. ==See also== * Comparison of online dating services * Tinder * Conservatism in the United States ==References== Category:Online dating for specific interests Category:Online dating services of the United States ",
