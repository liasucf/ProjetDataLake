    "text": "is a town located in Ishikari, Hokkaido, Japan. As of September 2016, the town has an estimated population of 16,694, and a density of 39 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 422.71 km\u00b2. ==Geography== Located on the north part of Ishikari Subprefecture of Hokkaido, the shape of the municipality is elongated north to south. It overlaps with the catchment area of the T\u014dbetsu river approximately. T\u014dbetsu means \"river from marsh\" in Ainu language, and in Japanese it is called \"T\u014dbetsu Gawa (river)\". Low mountains occupy the northern area of the municipality. The southern area is a part of the Ishikari Plains. Sapporo, the largest city of Hokkaido, lies on southwest of T\u014dbetsu. The large river of Ishikari divided T\u014dbetsu from Sapporo until 1934, when the Sassh\u014d Line railroad connected the two cities. Several more bridges built in the latter half of 20th century have further reduced the traffic obstacle. T\u014dbetsu has produced rice and recently flowers. Residential buildings are increasing modestly because of its better access to Sapporo. ==History== *1902 - T\u014dbetsu village was founded. *1947 - T\u014dbetsu village became T\u014dbetsu town. ==Sister cities== * Leksand, Dalarna, Sweden (since 1987)Sister cities of Tobetsu * Osaki, Miyagi (since 2000) * Uwajima, Ehime (since 2009) ==Education== ===University=== * Health Sciences University of Hokkaido ===High schools=== * Hokkaido Tobetsu High School ==Transportation== * Sassh\u014d Line: Ishikari-Futomi - Ishikari-T\u014dbetsu - Hokkaid\u014d-Iry\u014ddaigaku - Ishikari- Kanazawa - Moto-Nakagoya - Nakagoya ==Notable people from T\u014dbetsu== * Tatsunori Arai, football player ==See also== * Sweden Hills ==References== ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ",
