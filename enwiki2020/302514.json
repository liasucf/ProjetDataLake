    "text": "Pierre Mertens (born 9 October 1939) is a Belgian French-speaking writer and lawyer who specializes in international law, director of the Centre de sociologie de la litt\u00e9rature at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, and literary critic with the newspaper Le Soir. Influenced by Franz Kafka, Mertens started to publish novels and short stories in 1969 and received the Prix M\u00e9dicis in 1987 for Les \u00e9blouissements. He nevertheless continued his activities as a lawyer, participating in many battles for human rights. In 1989, he entered the Acad\u00e9mie royale de langue et litt\u00e9rature de Belgique, and was also named Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. Mertens has reflected much on the social function of the writer. For him, private life, fiction, and history are inseparable. Thus he grants a central place to the memory in the creation of his works. To him the novelist finds his inspiration in their personal and the historical past. Mertens is particularly marked by the activities of his parents, his father a journalist and music lover and his mother a biologist and pianist. He was also much affected by the German occupation, the execution of the Rosenbergs or the tragedy of the miners of Marcinelle in 1956. Later as a scholar of international law he strongly denounces the genocide in Biafra, torture in Ireland, and the prisons of Pinochet. Another important inspiration is music. In his novels, one finds the influence of music, such as the leitmotifs which cross them (the figure of the tiger, for example). He is also the author of a booklet on opera, La passion de Gilles (1982). His many travels and his extensive education has given him an international perspective. In Les Bons offices (1974) and Terre d'asile (1978), for example, Belgian history is presented from a foreign perspective. Mertens often sees his country as a synthesis of Europe and its problems. He caused a major controversy in his homeland with his book Une paix royale, published in 1995, which tells a fictionalised story of Belgium's royal family, mixing fiction and reality. He was tried and forced to remove a couple of pages from the subsequent editions. ==Works== *L'Inde ou l'Am\u00e9rique \u2013 1969 *Le Niveau de la mer \u2013 1970 *L'Imprescriptibilit\u00e9 des crimes de guerre et contre *l'humanit\u00e9 \u2013 1974 *Les Bons offices \u2013 1974 *Terre d'asile \u2013 1978 *N\u00e9crologies \u2013 1979 *La F\u00eate des anciens \u2013 1983 *Terreurs \u2013 1983 *Perdre \u2013 1984 *Berlin \u2013 1986 *Les \u00e9blouissements \u2013 1987 *Uwe Johnson, le scripteur de murs \u2013 1989 *L'Agent double \u2013 1989 *Lettres clandestines \u2013 1990 *Les Chutes centrales \u2013 1990 *Les Phoques de San Francisco \u2013 1991 *Flammes \u2013 1993 *Une paix royale \u2013 1995 *Collision et autres nouvelles \u2013 1995 *Tout est feu \u2013 1999 *Perasma \u2013 2001 ==External links== * Pierre Mertens at ARLFFB Category:1939 births Category:Belgian writers in French Category:Belgian Marxists Category:Living people Category:Prix M\u00e9dicis winners Category:People from Watermael-Boitsfort ",
