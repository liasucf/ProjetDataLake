    "text": "This is a list of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (incomplete before the Restoration, 1660). The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty were the members of The Board of Admiralty, which exercised the office of Lord High Admiral when it was not vested in a single person. The commissioners were a mixture of politicians without naval experience and professional naval officers, the proportion of naval officers generally increasing over time. In 1940, the Secretary of the Admiralty, a civil servant, became a member of the Board. The Lord High Admiral, and thus the Board of Admiralty, ceased to have operational command of the Royal Navy when the three service ministries were merged into the Ministry of Defence in 1964, when the office of Lord High Admiral reverted to the Crown. ==1628 to 1641== *20 September 1628: Commission. **Richard Weston, 1st Baron Weston (Lord High Treasurer), First Lord **Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey (Lord Great Chamberlain) **Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset (Lord Chamberlain to the Queen) **Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington (Chancellor of the Exchequer) **Sir Henry Vane (Comptroller of the Household) **Sir John Coke (Secretary of State) **Sir Francis Windebank (Secretary of State) *10 April 1635: Commission. **Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey (Lord Great Chamberlain), First Lord **others *16 March 1636: Commission **William Juxon (Lord High Treasurer), First Lord **others *13 April 1638: Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, Lord High Admiral ==1641 to 1661== From the appointment of Warwick until 1660, appointments during this period were made by Parliament or a part thereof. *7 December 1643: Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, Lord High Admiral *15 April 1645: Commission (by the Committee of Both Houses). **Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex **Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick **William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele **Dudley North, 3rd Baron North **William Earle **Philip Stapleton **John Evelyn, Jr. **Christopher Wray, MP **John Rolle **Giles Grene **D.
