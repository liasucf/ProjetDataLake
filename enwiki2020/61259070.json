He again won 2012 and 2017 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election from the Danilimda Vidhan Sabha constituency. Both these constituencies are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes. A complaint was filed stating that Parmar's caste certificate declaring him to be of a scheduled caste was fake. The plea was dismissed by local court in August 2013. == References == Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Gujarat Category:Gujarat MLAs 2007\u20132012 Category:Gujarat MLAs 2012\u20132017 Category:Gujarat MLAs 2017\u2013 Category:1969 births Category:Living people ",
