    "text": "Blue is the debut studio album by American country singer LeAnn Rimes, released in the United States on July 9, 1996 by Curb Records. It reached No. 3 on Billboard 200, and No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Singles released from this album include, in order of release: \"Blue\", \"Hurt Me\", \"One Way Ticket (Because I Can)\", \"Unchained Melody\" and \"The Light in Your Eyes\". These songs all charted on Billboard Hot Country Songs charts between 1996 and 1997; \"Blue\" and \"The Light in Your Eyes\" both reached top 10, while \"Hurt Me\" fell short off top 40. \"One Way Ticket\" is Rimes's only No. 1 hit on the country music charts. When purchased at Target stores during the 1996 Christmas season, the album included a bonus single of \"Put a Little Holiday in Your Heart\", with \"Unchained Melody\" on the B-side. \"Unchained Melody\" peaked at number three on the Country Songs chart while \"Put a Little Holiday in Your Heart\" peaked at number 51 on the same chart in 1997. ==Reception== The album was met with some positive reviews. Allmusic rated Blue four out of five stars. Shawn M. Haney, who reviewed the album, called it \"a glorious free-for- all of sassy pick-me-up country\", and stated that \"perhaps people of any age or style of interest will feel youthful again after a good listen and a half.\" Similarly, Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that \"such raw, old-fashioned country music, with such a big, twangy, sexy voice at the center, wouldn't be making such a stir in bland '90s Nashville if LeAnn Rimes weren't 13. In other words, the hype machine has inadvertently coughed up a gem.\" Los Angeles Times gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of four and said that \"Rimes displays the unbridled power and freshness you'd expect from a teenager. In an ideal world, she'd bring all that to bear on songs that tap her youthful zeal. Instead, too many on this major-label debut require a level of experience that's clearly beyond her years. There's no question Rimes has been blessed with a magnificent voice. Let's hope she'll be given a few years --say, at least until she's out of high school--to let her natural talent mature.\" In his Consumer Guide, however, Robert Christgau gave the album a \"neither\" score, and said it \"may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Compiled from liner notes. ;Musicians * Eddy Arnold \u2013 duet vocals on \"Cattle Call\" * Kevin Bailey \u2013 harmonica * Brad Billingsley \u2013 drums * Bruce Bouton \u2013 steel guitar * Crista Carnes \u2013 background vocals * Mike Chapman \u2013 bass guitar * Perry Coleman \u2013 background vocals * Lisa Criss \u2013 background vocals * Chad Cromwell \u2013 drums * Milo Deering \u2013 steel guitar * Larry Franklin \u2013 fiddle * Paul Franklin \u2013 steel guitar * Fred Gleber \u2013 drums * Kelly Glenn \u2013 keyboards * Paul Goad \u2013 piano, keyboards, bass guitar * John Hobbs \u2013 piano * Dann Huff \u2013 electric guitar * Ladonna Johnson \u2013 background vocals * John Jorgenson \u2013 electric guitar * Jimmy Kelly \u2013 piano, keyboards * Mary Ann Kennedy \u2013 background vocals * Joy McKay \u2013 background vocals * Mike McLain \u2013 piano * Terry McMillan \u2013 percussion * Jerry Matheny \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Greg Morrow \u2013 drums * Johnny Mulhair \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar, steel guitar * Steve Nathan \u2013 keyboards * Kayla Powell \u2013 background vocals * Curtis Randall \u2013 bass guitar * LeAnn Rimes \u2013 lead vocals * Pam Rose \u2013 background vocals * Brent Rowan \u2013 electric guitar * Bob Smith \u2013 bass guitar * Michael Spriggs \u2013 acoustic guitar * Matthew Ward \u2013 background vocals * Dennis Wilson \u2013 background vocals * Glenn Worf \u2013 bass guitar ;Technical * Chuck Howard \u2013 production * Johnny Mulhair \u2013 production * Wilbur C.
