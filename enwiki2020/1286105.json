After the war, she was convicted of war crimes. ==Wartime== Born as Alice Minna Elisabeth Elling in Berlin in 1903, she began to train as a guard at the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp in Germany in 1941. In October 1942, she was selected as one of the Schutzstaffel (SS) Aufseherin to be posted at the Majdanek camp near Lublin, occupied Poland where, along with Hermine Braunsteiner, she came to be regarded as two of the most brutal overseers. They regularly loaded trucks of women destined for the gas chambers. When a child was left over, the two would throw him or her on the top of the adults like luggage, and bolt the door shut. Orlowski often awaited the arrivals of new transports of women. She would then whip the prisoners, especially across the eyes. In Majdanek, Orlowski was promoted to the rank of Kommandof\u00fchrerin (Work Detail Overseer) in the sorting sheds. As the SS Aufseherin, Orlowski supervised over 100 women, who sorted through items taken from prisoners who had been gassed: watches, furs, coats, gold, jewellery, money, toys, glasses, and so on. When the camp was evacuated, the Germans sent Orlowski to the notorious Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp near Krak\u00f3w, in Nazi-occupied Poland.The facts pertaining to Orlowski's crimes in Majdanek are detailed by Simon Wiesenthal in Justice Not Vengeance. In Plaszow-Krak\u00f3w, Orlowski was in charge of a work detail on the Camp Street (Lager Strasse) and was known for her viciousness. In early January 1945, Orlowski was among the SS women posted on the death march to Auschwitz-Birkenau and it was during this time that her behaviour, previously observed as being brutal and sadistic, became more humane. On the death march in mid-January 1945 from Auschwitz to Loslau, Orlowski gave comfort to the inmates, and even slept alongside them on the ground outside. She also brought water to those who were thirsty.The facts about her behavior on the death march come from Malvina Graf: I survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto and Plaszow Camp It is unknown why her attitude changed, but some speculate that she sensed the war was almost over and she would soon be tried as a war criminal. Orlowski ended up back at Ravensbr\u00fcck as a guard. ==Post-war== After the war ended in May 1945, Orlowski was captured by Soviet forces and extradited to Poland to stand trial for war crimes. The \"picture book SS woman\" stood accused at the Auschwitz Trial in 1947. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released in 1957 after serving only 10 years. In 1975, West Germany tracked Orlowski down, and placed her on trial in the Third Majdanek Trial. She died of natural causes during the trial in 1976 at the age of 73. ==See also== * Female guards in Nazi concentration camps ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Date of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:German people who died in prison custody Category:German prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp personnel Category:People convicted in the Auschwitz trial Category:Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp personnel Category:Prisoners and detainees of Poland Category:Prisoners who died in German detention Category:People from Berlin Category:Auschwitz concentration camp personnel Category:Majdanek concentration camp personnel Category:People extradited from the Soviet Union Category:People extradited to Poland Category:Female guards in Nazi concentration camps ",
