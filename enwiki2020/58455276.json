In response to controversial comments by Kendall Jenner, Knight was one of many fashion models who spoke about how difficult fashion week is to maintain 30 or more shows while possibly not getting paid or being able to have meals. Knight was chosen as a \u201cTop Newcomer\u201d by models.com, in 2015. == References == Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:American female models Category:People from St. Louis ",
