Collaborating with software company, LightScape, the MWD crew was able to simulate reflective effect of millions of neon lights from the 1970s-era Las Vegas strip.Barron, Craig. 1998. SIGGRAPH \"Matte Painting in the Digital Age - 3-D Lighting Techniques.\" Radiosity rendering provided a true simulation of bounce-light reflectivity in a computer-generated environment. Another 1970s-era film, David Fincher's Zodiac, needed shots to establish the grittier San Francisco of that era. Barron shot digital images of existing city- building textures and then added painted period details in the computer. One such shot features the Embarcadero Freeway alongside the Ferry Building and San Francisco Bay. The freeway had been demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake so MWD digitally rebuilt the structure, viewed from an overhead computer-generated \"helicopter-shot\" to introduce the City and timeframe. CG lighting techniques were applied for an sped-up animated sequence showing the Transamerica Pyramid being built, establishing the passage of time. Barron researched archival photographs and architectural drawings for the shot.Robertson, Barbara. March 15, 2007. \"Memories of Murder: VFX for Zodiac \u2013 Recreating 1970s San Francisco for Director David Fincher.\" Studio Daily. Retrieved on November 30, 2018. Barron worked with Fincher again to build several digital matte and CGI environments for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The interior of the film's New Orleans train station had to change and deteriorate throughout 29 shots representing different eras. MWD built one CGI station model using Next Limit's Maxwell rendering software\u2014software that was generally used as an architectural visualization and product-design tool. MWD revamped it to mimic real-world lighting as seen from multiple angles and light sources.Duncan, Jody.
