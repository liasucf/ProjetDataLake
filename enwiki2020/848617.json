Koskinen composed several songs based on lyrics from his friends. A group of singers and musicians was assembled and the new band won the contest with their song \"Ampukaa komissaarit, nuo hullut koirat\" (Shoot the commissioners, those mad dogs). In the summer of 1995, they released their first single, \"Houkutusten kiihottava maku\". Over the course of the recording sessions, they also came up with a name for the band: Ultra Bra (which means \"Very Good\" in Swedish). During 1995, many new people joined the band, while others left. However, the lineup started to become fixed towards the end of the year. By the end of the year Anni Sinnem\u00e4ki, Koskinen's wife who was to become the most celebrated of all UB's lyricists, began writing lyrics, starting with \"Sankaritar\" and \"Ken Saro-Wiwa on kuollut\". (The latter song refers to Nigerian environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, and the circumstances surrounding his execution. The statement he made before his execution is specifically referenced.) Their first real album, Vapaaherran el\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4, came out in the autumn of 1996. All the while, they had been doing a lot of touring and their live reputation had become substantial. In 1997, the second album Kroketti came out. With the release of this album Ultra Bra really started to gain fame. Kroketti sold very well, remains their best selling album and contains some of their biggest hits, namely \"Sin\u00e4 l\u00e4hdit pois\" (\"You Went Away\") and \"Min\u00e4 suojelen sinua kaikelta\" (\"I Shall Protect You From Everything\"). In 1998, they participated in the contest for a song to represent Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest. Ultra Bra didn't win, but their entry, \"Tytt\u00f6jen v\u00e4lisest\u00e4 yst\u00e4vyydest\u00e4\" (\"About Friendship Between Girls\"), became a hit song. The third album, Kalifornia, was released in the spring of 1999. In early 2000, Ultra Bra again participated in the Finnish Eurovision song selection process, with \"Kaikki on hetken t\u00e4ss\u00e4\" (\"In This Moment, Everything's here\") without reaching the final round. In the spring, they also released several new singles. The song \"Heikko valo\" (\"The Weak Light\") also featured in the Finnish movie Levottomat (The Restless). Their fourth album, Vesireittej\u00e4, came out on 13 October 2000. The week before it was released, numerous magazines and newspapers wrote articles about them, and they appeared on TV and on the radio. Vesireittej\u00e4 went number one \u2013 and gold \u2013 on its first week in the Finnish charts. ==The end of Ultra Bra== In the summer before the release of Vesireittej\u00e4, Ultra Bra decided they would continue for only about a year and then quit and start doing something else. In October 2001, they released a compilation album, Sin\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4n\u00e4 kun synnyin, that contained a few new songs and many rarities, along with a music video tape and music book. After this they did a small tour of seven gigs, quitting on 20 October 2001, with maximum media coverage, surrounded by thousands of fans. ==Comeback== Ultra Bra performed a comeback on 30 January 2012. It took place at Kokoaan suurempi Suomi 2012, a fundraiser concert for Pekka Haavisto's presidential campaign. Tickets to the concert sold out in two hours on 25 January and the rush crashed the online ticket service Tiketti. According to singer Vuokko Hovatta, the fundraiser was a one-off event and there are no plans for further Ultra Bra gigs. However, Ultra Bra did a small comeback tour in Finland in the summer of 2017. The band also performed for three ultimate concerts in Helsinki (Hartwall Arena) from 15 to 17 December 2017. ==Band members== * Kerkko Koskinen \u2013 piano, main composer and quasi- leader * Vuokko Hovatta \u2013 vocals * Terhi Kokkonen \u2013 vocals * Arto Talme \u2013 vocals * Olli Virtaperko \u2013 vocals * Antti Lehtinen \u2013 drums * Joel Melasniemi \u2013 guitar * Marko Portin \u2013 saxophone * Tommi Saarikivi \u2013 bass * Jan Pethman \u2013 percussion * Kari Pelttari \u2013 trumpet * Ilmari Pohjola \u2013 trombone * Anna Tulusto \u2013 vocals (until summer 1998) In many orchestral pieces Ultra Bra also had an additional string section and a chorus. ===Current projects=== * Kerkko Koskinen is a solo artist.
