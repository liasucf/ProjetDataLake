Their first two releases for the Parlophone label were Extended Plays, these were named One EP and Two EP. However, like most EPs the opening track was promoted as the key song. Subsequent singles were more focused around the opening track, but the band retained the EP label and with the exception of \"Taxloss\" and \"I Can Only Disappoint U\", all of their singles were numbered. The group's first single was paid and produced by the group on their own label; Sci-Fi Hi-Fi Records. The group's second single; \"Skin Up Pin Up\" / \"Flourella\" was released on the EMI affiliate Regal Records. All subsequent singles were issued by Parlophone/EMI. Their final single, \"Slipping Away\", was released after the group had disbanded was commercially released as a 7\" Vinyl and Download Release only {| class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Release Date !rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\"| Title !colspan=\"3\"| Chart Positions !rowspan=\"2\"| Album |-style=\"font-size:smaller;\" !width=\"35\"| UK !width=\"35\"| SCO Scottish singles: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * !width=\"35\"| US Mod. |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1995 | 25 September | \"Take It Easy Chicken\" |align=center| \u2013 |align=center| \u2013 |align=center| \u2013 | rowspan=\"2\"| \u2014 |- | 27 November | \"Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella\" |align=center| 91 |align=center| \u2013 |align=center| \u2013 |- | rowspan=\"4\"| 1996 | 25 March | \"Egg Shaped Fred\" (One EP) |align=center| 37 |align=center| 42 |align=center| \u2013 | Attack of the Grey Lantern |- | 3 June | \"Take It Easy Chicken\" (Two EP) |align=center| 32 |align=center| 34 |align=center| \u2013 | \u2014 |- | 9 September | \"Stripper Vicar\" (Three EP) |align=center| 19 |align=center| 25 |align=center| \u2013 | rowspan=\"4\"| Attack of the Grey Lantern |- | 25 November | \"Wide Open Space\" (Four EP) |align=center| 15 |align=center| 13 |align=center| 25 |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 1997 | 3 February | \"She Makes My Nose Bleed\" (Five EP) |align=center| 9 |align=center| 8 |align=center| \u2013 |- | 28 April | \"Taxloss\" |align=center| 15 |align=center| 18 |align=center| \u2013 |- | 6 October | \"Closed for Business\" (Seven EP) |align=center| 10 |align=center| 10 |align=center| \u2013 | \u2014 |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 1998 | 29 June | \"Legacy\" (Eight EP) |align=center| 7 |align=center| 8 |align=center| \u2013 | rowspan=\"4\"| Six |- | 24 August | \"Being a Girl (Part One)\" (Nine EP) |align=center| 13 |align=center| 14 |align=center| \u2013 |- | 26 October | \"Negative\" (Ten EP) |align=center| 27 |align=center| 29 |align=center| \u2013 |- | 1999 | 1 February | \"Six\" (Eleven EP) |align=center| 16 |align=center| 21 |align=center| \u2013 |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2000 | 31 July | \"I Can Only Disappoint U\" |align=center| 8 |align=center| 9 |align=center| \u2013 | rowspan=\"3\"|Little Kix |- | 6 November | \"Electric Man\" (EP 13) |align=center| 23 |align=center| 32 |align=center| \u2013 |- | 2001 | 29 January | \"Fool\" (Fourteen EP) |align=center| 28 |align=center| 34 |align=center| \u2013 |- | 2004 | 20 September | \"Slipping Away\" |align=center| 55 |align=center| 71 |align=center| \u2013 | Kleptomania |- |} ==B-sides== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
