    "text": "Rebecca Q. Ivers is an Australian academic known for her work in injury prevention research. ==Career and research== Ivers is the Head of the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of New South Wales, as well as an honorary Professorial Fellow at the George Institute for Global Health and a Senior Research Fellow at the National Health and Medical Research Council. She was awarded the 2018 Elizabeth Blackburn Fellowship and named on the Australian Financial Review and Westpac 100 Women of Influence Awards in 2014. She is an injury epidemiologist and a public health researcher. She has been credited with influencing Australian government legislation relating to graduated driver licensing. She has also been involved in a number of studies into injury management and prevention in Indigenous Australian communities, including analysis of driving behaviour and crashes and preventing avoidable injuries among children. Indigenous Australians are less likely to hold a drivers license than non-Indigenous Australians, a statistic which can impact on their ability to find employment. Ivers was involved in establishing the Driving Change program to help Indigenous Australians learn to drive and obtain a drivers license, a program which has been credited with helping participants find and keep jobs. Ivers has written editorials for the Sydney Morning Herald on topics including alcohol advertising and sports, gun laws, bicycle safety and helmets, and road safety in general. Ivers has overseen studies with a global reach examining the burden and risk factors for injury in low-income settings, including Vietnam, India and China. Current global projects involve a large scale initiative implementing community drowning interventions in Bangladesh, and work on scalable interventions for drowning in India and Vietnam. She also leads work on fracture care working with investigators from McMasters University on a NHMRC funded prospective study of 40,000 people examining the incidence and predictors of mortality in people sustaining traumatic fractures in low income country settings. == Selected publications == * * * * * == Awards == * Winner, Innovation: Australian Financial Review and Westpac100 Women of Influence Awards 2014 * NSW Public Health Associations' Public Health Impact Award.
