In that capacity he served much of the Lower East Side and the Financial District. A Democrat, he served as a lieutenant of Tammany Hall boss Thomas \"Big Tom\" Foley. After Foley's death he was a candidate for Tammany Hall leader of the first Assembly District but ultimately moved to have such position taken up by Assemblyman Peter J. Hamill. Martin F. Tanahey Playground in the Two Bridges neighborhood was named in his honor in 1952. Tanahey had previously broken ground for a new playground on Cherry Street in 1925. Born in the Lower East Side, he had previously served as chief clerk of the New York State Labor Department and later as assistant appraiser of the Port of New York. He had also served as an assistant government appraiser in President Wilson's administration. He died of pneumonia in his home in 1930. On May 27 the remainder of the Board of Aldermen elected David A. Mahoney to fill his vacancy. ==References== Category:New York City Council members Category:1874 births Category:1930 deaths ",
