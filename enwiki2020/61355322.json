Hal Horowitz with American Songwriter reviewed the album: \"Russell wrote 13 new songs, clearly in the style of those sung by Sinatra, Mel Torme and the crooners of the \u201830s-\u201850s. Co-producer Mark Lambert then worked with arranger Larry Hall to add full orchestral backing to the songs, including harps, swelling strings, bold horns and even angelic background vocalists.\" \"This is the album he wanted to leave as his legacy. As such, it\u2019s a significant, often impressive work from one of rock and roll\u2019s true icons who has chosen a unique and, to many, surprisingly starry-eyed way to say goodbye.\"americansongwriter.com, Leon Russell: On a Distant Shore, Written By Hal Horowitz, September 20, 2017 Russell in 2009 ==Track listing== *All songs performed and written by Leon Russell (Matt Harris joining Leon on # 3) *1 On a Distant Shore 3:16 *2 Love This Way 3:50 *3 Here Without You by Matt Harris and Leon 3:51 *4 This Masquerade 4:41 *5 Black and Blue 3:16 *6 Just Leaves and Grass 5:02 *7 On the Waterfront 3:31 *8 Easy to Love 4:07 *9 Hummingbird 3:10 *10 The One I Love Is Wrong 3:27 *11 Were Do We Go From Here 3:35 *12 A Song for You 3:35 ==Personnel== *Leon Russell Bass, Composer, Keyboards, Primary Artist, Producer, Vocals *Coco Bridges Cover Painting, Vocals *Sugaree Noel Bridges Vocals *Mike Brignardello Bass *Ray Goren Featured Artist *Larry Hall Guitar, Horn, Keyboards, Orchestral Arrangements, Strings *Tony Harrell Keyboards *Drew Lambert Bass *Mark Lambert Engineer, Guitar, Liner Notes, Mixing, Producer, Vocals *Chris Leuzinger Guitar *Greg Morrow Drums *Russ Pahl Guitar (Steel) *Andre Reiss Guitar *Eddie Kramer Engineer, Mixing *Shawn Davies Graphic Design Leon Russell taking time out to tell a story in 2016 ==References== ==External links== *Leon Russell discography *Leon Russell lyrics *Leon Russell NAMM Oral History Program Interview (2012) Category:2017 albums Category:Leon Russell albums ",
