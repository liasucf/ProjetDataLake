His older brother was Hermann Scheper, who was born on 3 April 1842.Landesarchiv Th\u00fcringen - Hauptstaatsarchiv Weimar, Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar, No. 146 1920 self- written curriculum vitae of Hermann Scheper p. 205 At the age of 7 Hinnerk was enrolled in the Protestant Volksschule in Wulften in 1904. After finishing school in 1912, he began an apprenticeship as a painter with Gustav Nehmelmann. With the simultaneous attendance of a further education school in nearby Osnabr\u00fcck, Hinnerk expanded his knowledge in the subjects drawing and mathematics. In 1915, after successful completion of his journeyman's examination, he found his first job in Quakenbr\u00fcck with painter Rudolf Engel and in 1916 he worked in the post office in Badbergen, as his master received a military service obligation to a shipyard in Bremen. In the preceding period Hinnerk managed to sell two of his paintings he had painted himself and used the money to buy his first camera. He developed the photos in his self built darkroom. == The time at the Bauhaus == From 1918 to 1919 he attended the School of Arts and Crafts (majoring in photography) in D\u00fcsseldorf and Bremen. From 1919 to 1922 he studied at the Bauhaus in Weimar in the preliminary course of Johannes Itten and Paul Klee as well as mural painting with Itten and Oskar Schlemmer. Hinnerk Scheper passed his master examination as a painter. In the same year he married his fellow student Lou Berkenkamp. From 1922 to 1925 Scheper worked as a mural painter and colour designer, also for buildings in Weimar and M\u00fcnster. From 1925, Scheper headed the workshop for mural painting at the Bauhaus in Dessau, succeeding Wassily Kandinsky, until the final closure of the Bauhaus by the National Socialists in 1933.Bersenbr\u00fccker Kreisblatt Also a Badberger influenced the Bauhaus Memories of Hinnerk Scheper and his work at the art school in Weimar Article 22 October 2019 by Alexandra L\u00fcders Hinnerk Scheper his wife Lou === The \u201cBauhaus Wallpaper\u201d === Three patterns of the Bauhaus Wallpaper, Bauhaus exhibition Nieders\u00e4chsischer Landtag Under the leadership of director Hannes Meyer, who succeeded Walter Gropius on 1 April 1928, a group was appointed to develop designs for the Bauhaus Wallpaper Collection; they were Hinnerk Scheper, Ludwig Hilberseimer, Josef Albers and Joost Schmidt. Hinnerk organized a design competition for the wallpaper patterns among his students in the mural painting workshop.With subversive glamour: Max Bill and his time. 1908-1939 Angela Thomas Verlag Scheidegger & Spiess, 2008 - 575 pages S. 184 (restricted view) Through Maria Rasch, sister of Emil Rasch, co-owner of the Wallpaper Factory Gebr\u00fcder Rasch in Bramsche, the production of the Bauhaus patterns was stimulated. The collection comprised 14 patterns, each with 5 to 15 colour variations, each with a structured, small-scale design that could be processed free of waste. After initial difficulties, the wallpaper became a complete economic success and through constant modernisation, the patterns also outlasted the Bauhaus closure up to today's Rasch range.Hanna Elisabeth Koch: \"Beauty has a new meaning today\" - On West German design of the 1950s using the example of the wallpaper industry, 2014, dissertation, p. 22 and p. 25 (PDF) == The Time in Moscow == Basil-cathedral-morning From 1929 to 1931, Scheper was on leave from the Bauhaus to work in Moscow, the Soviet Union capital to set up and manage a state consulting centre for colour design with associated teaching activities for the entire Soviet Union. Mrs Lou accompanied him to Moscow and supported him during this time. In addition, Scheper taught at the School of Design WChUTEIN\u2019. At the same time he created photo series about people and architecture in the Soviet Union. His Russian colleague in the \"Advisory Centre for Colour in Architecture and Cityscape\" (Russian Maljarstroj) became Boris Ender, a student of Michail Matjuschin.Scientific journal of the Weimar College of Architecture and Construction 26th year 1 1979 1 issue 4/5 Larissa A.

After 1934 he was engaged in freelance artistic work, colour design and restoration work. In 1934 the National Socialists refused Hinnerk the membership in the \"Reichsverband der Deutschen Presse\" (Association of the German Press). From 1942 to 1945 Scheper did military service in Germany. === After World War II === Forest Cemetery Zehlendorfer Hinnerk und Lou Scheper In 1945, the Berlin magistrate appointed him head of the Office for the Preservation of Monuments and Urban Planning and as State Conservator of Berlin. In the same year, he was one of the rescuers of the Neue Wache in Berlin, as was the architect and curator of monuments Selman Selmanagi\u0107 in 1949.Memories of Kurt Reutti (1900-1967), a German sculptor and art collector LII. Die Neue Wache DFG-Viewer p. 355-361 Die Bauwerke und Kunstdenkm\u00e4ler von Berlin Supplement 40 (PDF) p. 9 Preface During the division of Berlin, Scheper protested unsuccessfully against the eviction of the Berlin City Palacees by the German People's Police in October 1948.Although an official commission had declared it not to be in danger of collapsing the day before. One of Scheper's departments in the castle was also affected. For this and the following see Renate Petras: The Palace in Berlin. From the revolution of 1918 to the destruction in 1950 Verlag f\u00fcr Bauwesen, Berlin/ M\u00fcnchen 1992, p. 108f. The hopeless struggle against the demolition of the palace, which was being pursued by the East Berlin magistrate, caused him and the director of the Berlin Palace Department, Margarete K\u00fchn to move their offices to West Berlin. In 1951, Hinnerk attracted attention as an expert witness in an expert commission consisting of Professor Richard Sedlmaier from Kiel, Professor G\u00fcnther Grundmann and Dr. jur. G\u00fcnter Scheefe from Hamburg. The commission unmasked the forgeries in the Marienkirche of L\u00fcbeck.Kunstchronik, Volume 5H.

Hinnerk, like in the period up to the beginning of the war, remained responsible for its colour scheme. From 1952/53 the Rasch company modernised the collection and oriented itself towards Scandinavian designs. From 1952 Scheper held a teaching position for the preservation of historical monuments at the Technical University Berlin and from 1953 he held the title of Government Director. Hinnerk Scheper died on May 5, 1957 in Berlin. The couple's grave is in the forest cemetery Zehlendorf. == Family == On December 22, 1922 he married his wife Lou, n\u00e9e Hermine Luise Berkenkamp in the city church St. Peter and Paul in Weimar.

For the Senate in West Berlin, a transfer to the original location in East Berlin was out of the question, since by decision of the state leadership of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) the baroque Berlin Castle, in sight of the bridge, was simply blown up in September 1950 .Berlin Berlin in history and presentGebr.
