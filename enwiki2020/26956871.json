Rodef Sholom has been affiliated with the Union for Reform Judaism since 1957.

During the 1940s the Marin Jewish community would gather at houses in the community for Shabbat services. B'nai B'rith, Hadassah, and Council of Jewish Women also established chapters within the county, and in 1948, the Marin Jewish Community Center was opened at 1618 Mission Avenue.Battat, Lee, ed., Celebration 40: The First Forty Years of Congregation Rodef Sholom 1956-1996, October 1996 The JCC held kabbalat shabbat and shabbat services each week in its sanctuary, and out of these services grew Rodef Sholom in 1956 and Kol Shofar in 1962. Congregation Rodef Sholom was founded in 1956 by Harry Albert, Abe Blumenfeld, Sidney Braverman, Samuel B. Herst, David J. Rosenberg, Sidney Rudey, Aaron Schwartz, and Julius Selinger.Battat, Lee, Congregation Rodef Sholom: Twenty Fifth Anniversary 1956-1981: A Congregational History, Congregation Rodef Sholom, December 1981 The congregation grew from 64 families upon establishment to 143 by the high holy days. Rabbi Julius A. Liebert and Cantor Louis Roller, the congregation's first clergy, led services in the JCC sanctuary. The temple sisterhood, then called the Ladies Auxiliary, formed that same year. During its first year, membership was divided between a Reform or Conservative affiliation. However, in 1957, under the direction of Rabbi Morton Hoffman, Rodef Sholom formally became a Reform congregation by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
