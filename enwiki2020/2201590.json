    "text": "Solar Enemy was a British electronic and industrial band. Formed in 1990 out of the ashes of the seminal 1980s group Portion Control by founding members John Whybrew, Ian Sharp and Dean Piavani and released two albums on Third Mind Records and T.E.Q. Music respectively, with some songs that did some reasonable business in the clubscene at the time. Solar Enemy ceased activity in 1993. John and Dean reformed as Portion Control again in the early 21st century. ==Discography== ===EPs=== *Techno Divinity (1990) # \"Techno Divinity\" \u2013 4:00 # \"Virus Buster\" \u2013 4:50 # \"Dark Angel\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Techno Divinity (Version Messianic)\" \u2013 3:38 (CD only) ===Albums=== *Dirty vs Universe (1991) # \"Universe\" \u2013 3:46 # \"Welcome to Hell\" \u2013 5:51 # \"Inca Pisco\" \u2013 3:42 # \"Burn-Up\" \u2013 4:48 # \"Dark Angel\" \u2013 4:29 # \"Massive Radiation\" \u2013 4:37 # \"Carcajou\" \u2013 5:04 # \"Trojan\" \u2013 3:43 # \"Rotator\" \u2013 4:42 # \"Sundown\" \u2013 5:03 # \"Dirt\" \u2013 2:52 # \"Ultrasound\" \u2013 3:01 # \"CD3\" \u2013 3:16 # \"Damnation\" \u2013 3:59 # \"Certainly Mate\" \u2013 3:06 # \"Gigadrive\" \u2013 5:06 # \"Burn-Up P.C.
