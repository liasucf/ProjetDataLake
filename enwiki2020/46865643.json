He became in 1966 an assistant professor and in 1973 a full professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Orlik was in the academic year 1971/72 a visiting professor in Oslo. From 1967 to 1969 he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study.Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars Orlik is the author of over 70 publications. He works on Seifert manifolds, singularity theory, braid theory, reflection groups, invariant theory, and hypergeometric integrals. He was, with Louis Solomon and Hiroaki Terao, a pioneer of the theory of arrangements of hyperplanes in complex space. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society ==Selected publications== ===Books=== *Seifert Manifolds, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 291, Springer Verlag, 1972 *as editor: Singularities, 2 vols., American Mathematical Society, 1983 *Introduction to Arrangements, CBMS Regional Conference Series, American Mathematical Society, 1989 * * *with Volkmar Welker: Algebraic Combinatorics.
