This range separates Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts. Tirupattur district lies on the north-western side and Tiruvannamalai district lies on the south-eastern side of this range. The towns of Tirupattur, Vaniyambadi and Ambur of Tirupattur district are located on the north western side and the towns of Chengam and Polur of Tiruvannamalai district are located on the south eastern side. The hills consist of bluish- gray granites, with peaks averaging 3,800\u20134,000 feet (1,300\u20131,350 m). About 50 miles (80 km) wide and 20 miles (32 km) long, they are bisected into eastern and western sections by the Cheyyar and Agaram rivers, tributaries of the Palar. \"The Barahmahal hills to the west are somewhat bare, but the Jawadhi are clothed in verdure to the very summit on the east: towards sunset the whole range puts on a purple tinge like heather bloom. The sharper shadows mark out minor ranges and valleys, which in the midday merge in the mass of the range, and beyond Bommaikuppam, looking from Tirupatur, a silvery cascade may be seen, shining bright in the setting sun.\".le Fanu, Henry \"A Manual of the Salem district in the presidency of Madras\". 2 vols. Volume 2. Madras: Government Press, 1883 During the British colonisation of India, the Javadhu Hills appeared occasionally in government gazetteers and manuals,Garstin, John H.\"Manual Of The South Arcot District\".

Henry le Fanu, writing in 1883, admired the beauty of the Jawadhi hills. The Indian astronomer Vainu Bappu selected the hills as the site of the Kavalur Observatory (VBO), which began operations in 1967.

The weather and roads are very nice, thanks to Tamil Nadu government and its state highways department for maintaining the roads in good condition. Please Avoid driving at night or dark hours Safe timing for travelling is 6am-5pm, After polur town To jamuna marathur 40 km of Ghat roads, mostly one cannot see any shops or even people.
