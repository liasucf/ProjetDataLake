Broadbridge Brook runs off Mischa Hill west of the present-day intersection of Route 108 and the Merritt Parkway and flows southwesterly to Broadbridge Avenue in Stratford. The Captain the town recorder was referring to may have been Captain William Curtiss who was Captain of the first Train Band and owned a farm at Turkey Hill at this time. This hill was located two miles from the meeting house along the Farm Highway on the way north to Mischa Hill. The hill was also commonly called Second Hill, Good Hill and Grassy Hill.Genealogy of the Bostwick family in America: The descendants of Arthur Bostwick of Stratford, CT, p. 56, Bryan Printing Co., 1901 The Captain could have also been Joseph, Joseph Jr. or John Hawley who owned the farm, called Ephraim Hawley House, which bordered Zachariah Curtiss to the south.
