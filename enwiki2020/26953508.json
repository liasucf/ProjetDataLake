His joining of Sugada army was only nominally voluntarily as it was forced by the Japanese army for Korean males to join the army. He then was trained at China Central Officer School and became a warrant officer in the Chinese Central Army. In 1945, he visited Korean Liberation Army located in Suzhou and joined the army from the February as a commissioned officer. While serving the Korean liberation army, he participated activities with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS; the predecessor of the CIA). In November 1945, he came back to Korea via the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. ==In politics== After returning to Korea, Chang worked as a secretary of Kim Gu and participated in Lee Beom-seok's Chosun Ethnic Youth League. After the establishment of Republic of Korea, during the First Republic of South Korea, he worked for the government as a secretary. In 1950, he was in charge of citizen spirit reformation in the Ministry of Education and Culture (\ubb38\uad50\ubd80). In 1952, he was the directing manager of national ideology research institution. He also worked in two more positions in the Ministry of Education and Culture and founded a periodical called Sasangge. He established the Dong-in Literary Award in 1956. Sasangge acrimoniously denounced the \uc790\uc720\ub2f9 administration and became the starting fire of the 4.19 revolution. After the 4.19 revolution took place, he took positions in the Ministry of Munkyo during the second republic. After the May 16 coup, he opposed the South Korea\u2013Japan conference and the sending of troops to Vietnam War. During the 1967 South Korean presidential election, he made an issue out of the career of Yun Bo-seon on Park Chung-hee's pro-Japanese and Workers' Party of South Korea activities. He was then sent into prison for insulting the head of the state. After he came out of prison, he worked with Yun Bo-seon and New Democratic Party (South Korea) in the Korean National Party. From 1975, when he was preparing to fight against the Park Chung-hee administration, he died mysteriously in Pocheon, Gyeonggi-do. The South Korean government announced that Chang's death had been caused by loss of footing while climbing down a mountain. However, after Chang's death, continuous doubts were raised whether it was a homicide by Park's government. To such doubts, the Park administration declared the state of national emergency and arrested anyone who mentioned the death of Chang Chun-ha. The death of Chang Chun-ha has been re-investigated, but there have not been any clear conclusions yet. == Awards == Chang was awarded the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature, and the Creative Communication Arts.Awardees Ramon Magsaysay Award == See also == * Kim Kyusik * Chang Myon * Kim Young-Sam == References == == External links == * Chang Chun-ha Memorial Category:1918 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from Uiju County Category:Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea Category:Korean independence activists Category:South Korean anti-communists Category:South Korean democracy activists Category:Korean revolutionaries Category:South Korean Methodists Category:Civil rights activists Category:South Korean journalists Category:Korean religious leaders Category:Democratic Party (South Korea, 1955) politicians Category:Ramon Magsaysay Award winners Category:Jang clan of Andong Category:20th-century journalists ",
