On January 1, 1922, the club members took over the management by a contract signed with the company. The activities of the club included water polo, swimming, diving, squash, tennis, golf, cricket, hockey, bridge, bowling, soccer, handball, basketball, Volleyball, Speed ball, Ballet, Gymnastics, Snooker, Athletics and different kinds of dancing. In 1947, the area of the club was reduced to its present size (around 19 feddans) after the company took back the land of the golf course. Golf was cancelled after the frequent objections of club members to the large expenses incurred by the game, which, after all, was not played by many members. == Shorouk branch == Like other major sporting clubs in Egypt, Heliopolis Sporting Club has another branch, in Shorouk city. The total area of the Shorouk branch is three times bigger than the main club in Heliopolis. Thus, that area is more suitable for all developmental and improving future possibilities. ==Current sports== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"80%\" ! width=50% valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"font-weight:normal\"| * Aikido * Athletics * Basketball * Boxing * Diving * Football * Gymnastics * Handball * Judo * Kung- fu ! width=50% valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" style=\"font-weight:normal\"| * Speedball * Squash * Swimming * Table tennis * Taekwondo * Tennis * Volleyball * Water polo |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Clubs and societies in Egypt Category:Sports clubs established in 1910 Category:Sports clubs in Cairo Category:Sports venues in Egypt Category:Water polo clubs in Egypt ",
