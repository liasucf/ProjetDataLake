It contains 11 Christmas related songs co-written with Derrick Monk who also produced the album. Heather Phares, writing for AllMusic, felt the album was fun but not one of Brown's best. ==Reception== In a review for AllMusic, Heather Phares felt the album followed the same pattern of his other Christmas albums with his usual funk music and social commentary lyrics; she concludes that the album is festive fun, but not up the standard of his best work. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:James Brown albums Category:1999 Christmas albums Category:albums produced by James Brown ",
