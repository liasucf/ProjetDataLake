A stylistic trend was formed incorporating different varieties of European architecture, and eclectic environments had begun to be flavored with modernity. The first period of architectural development in Baku was about to end; in the new socio-economic conditions, the national-romantic direction opened itself to revival. Agabala Guliyev was one of the monarchs of Baku who often traveled to Western Europe. He decided to build a house in the traditions of local architecture. He owned several properties in the Icheri Sheher. He was against the European style used in urban buildings, so he hired Skibinsky and ordered him to employ the Shirvanshah's Palace, Middle East and Arabic architecture. As the Shirvanshahs Palace was nearby, Skibinsky acquired photographs of Middle Eastern architecture. This architecture had attracted the attention of European and especially German scholars; albums, trials and other iconographic material were accessible to Skibinski.Union of Architects of Azerbaijan.Nobel Brothers and Azerbaijani competition.
