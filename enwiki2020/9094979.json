    "text": "Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on 21 November 2006 between the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) at the end of the Nepalese Civil War, the United Nations received a request for assistance, and established the political mission United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) on 23 January 2007 to monitor the disarmament of Maoist rebels and the preparations for Constituent Assembly elections in 2007. In 2009 the mandate was renewed, but with a phased withdrawal of UNMIN staff, in line with a report by the Secretary-General. In passing Resolution 1909 (2010), the Security Council hoped to end UNMIN by May 15, 2010. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General leading the mission prior to the 2009 mandate renewal was Ian Martin. He gave his final briefing to the Security Council in January 2009 and was replaced by Karin Landgren. UNMIN ceased operations on January 15, 2011. ==References== ==External links== * Official UNMIN webpage Nepal Category:United Nations Security Council mandates Category:Foreign relations of Nepal Category:Organizations established in 2007 Category:Organizations disestablished in 2011 Category:Nepal and the United Nations ",
