    "text": "Illustration of the Gare Saint-Lazare in 1868 After working on rural landscapes, Claude Monet returned to Paris in 1877 and made a dozen oil paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare railway station in Paris. This was Monet's first series of paintings concentrating on a single theme. After considering working at the Gare du Nord, he sought permission from the director of the Compagnie des Chemins de fer de l'Ouest to paint en plein air, at the Gare Saint-Lazare. The Impressionist paintings capture the smoky interior of this Paris railway station, in varied atmospheric conditions and from various points of view. The works were in part a response to the criticism of his painting Impression, Sunrise, which was exhibited at the First Impressionist Exhibition in April 1874, and also fashionable depictions of technical progress: the modern steam train and the newly extended iron and glass train shed at the station constructed by engineer Eug\u00e8ne Flachat. Eight of the paintings were exhibited at the in Paris in April 1877, where they were admired by \u00c9mile Zola, who later wrote his 1890 novel La B\u00eate humaine about the railways. Examples of the works are held by many public collections. == List == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Museum ! scope=\"col\" | City ! scope=\"col\" | Country ! scope=\"col\" | Dimensions (cm) (in) ! scope=\"col\" | #1996, Daniel Wildenstein, Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 ! width=\"100\" class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" | Illus. |- | | Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay | Paris | France | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W438 | 100px |- | | Fogg Art Museum | Cambridge | United States | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W439 | 100px |- | | Chicago Institute of Art | Chicago | United States | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W440 | 100px |- | | National Gallery | London | UK | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W441 | 100px |- | | Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet | Paris | France | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W442 | 100px |- | | Private collection | | | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W443 | 100px |- | | Private collection | | | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W444 | 100px |- | | Pola Museum of Art | Hakone | Japan | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W445 | 100px |- | | Private collection | | | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W446 | 100px |- | | Private collection | | | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W447 | 100px |- | | Lower Saxony State Museum | Hannover | Germany | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W448 | 100px |- | | W\u00fcrth Collection | Rome | Italy | align=\"right\" | | align=\"right\" | W449 | 100px |} ==References== === External links === * L'histoire par l'image : Le chemin de fer, symbole d'une nouvelle r\u00e9volution industrielle - Claude Monet, La gare Saint-Lazare Category:1877 paintings Category:Paintings by Claude Monet Category:Trains in art Category:Paris in art ",
