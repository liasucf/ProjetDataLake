It is a parthenogenetic species, with males being extremely rare. The larvae feed on Populus tremula and Populus tremuloides (ssp. downesi). They mine the leaves of their host plant. It first bores in the petiole, resulting in a swelling. When the larva reaches the leaf disc, it makes an elongate blotch between the midrib and the first lateral vein. The frass is concentrated in two stripes parallel to the sides of the mine. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. ==Subspecies== *Ectoedemia argyropeza argyropeza *Ectoedemia argyropeza downesi Wilkinson and Scoble, 1979 (North America) ==References== Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description ==External links== *bladmineerders.nl *Ectoedemia argyropeza images at Consortium for the Barcode of Life *Nepticulidae from the Volga and Ural region *UKmoths *Swedish moths Category:Nepticulidae Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths of North America ",
