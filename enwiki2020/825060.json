As he is one of the pro-Chinese members of the LDP, he came under pressure domestically in the spring of 2005 when anti-Japanese movements in China became intense. K\u014dno is well known as a controversial figure within the comfort women debate, for the official statement he made in 1993, when he was Chief Cabinet Secretary. In his statement, made after historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi announced he had discovered in the Defense Agency library in Tokyo documentary evidence that the Imperial Japanese Army established and ran \"comfort stations\", he essentially admitted that the Japanese Imperial Army had been involved, directly and indirectly, in the establishment of comfort facilities, and that coercion had been used in the recruitment and retention of the women. His subsequent call for historical research and education aimed at remembering the issue became the basis for addressing the subject of forced prostitution in school history textbooks. == Footnotes == |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:People from Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Category:Waseda University alumni Category:Speakers of the House of Representatives (Japan) Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Japan) Category:Government ministers of Japan Category:Foreign ministers of Japan Category:Japanese racehorse owners and breeders Category:Liver transplant recipients Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians Category:New Liberal Club politicians Category:21st- century Japanese politicians ",
