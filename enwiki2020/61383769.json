It has the inventory number Cam\u00e9e 360.Often also called Babelon 360 according to the author of a catologue of the collection\u02d0 Ernest Babelon: Catalogue des cam\u00e9es antiques et modernes de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale. Leroux, Paris 1897, pp. 193\u2013195 no. 360 (Digitalisat) and was bought in 1893.Ernest Babelon: Sapor et Val\u00e9rien, cam\u00e9e sassanide de la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. In: Monuments et m\u00e9moires de la Fondation Eug\u00e8ne Piot. Volume 1, 1894, pp. 85 (online). The cameo is 6,8 cm high and 10,3 cm wide and made of sardonyx, and is thought to date to about 260 AD. For the carving, the different colored layers of the stone was used. The background is dark, the figures are white and details are again dark again as they are on the highest level. The cameo shows two riders. Both horses are in flying gallop. On the right side appears the Sasanian king Shapur I (reigned AD 241\u2013272). He wears a helmet with a globe crest. His shoulders also have attached globes. His right arm is holding the left arm of the Roman emperor Valerian (reigned AD 253\u2013260). The Roman emperor holds in his right hand a sword (gladius). He is beardless and has on his head a laurel wreath, identifying him as Roman emperor. Though the client was presumably Sasanian, the style is Greco-Roman, as the artist presumably was. The scene shows most likely the capturing of emperor Valerian by Shapur I in the Battle of Edessa in 260 AD. The battle was a huge success for the Sasanian troops as they managed to seize the Roman emperor, an event that was celebrated on several monuments. In 256 the Sasanians conquered the Greek city of Antioch and it seems likely that many craftsmen and artists were taken. It seems possible that the cameo was made by such an artist.Blair Fowlkes\u2013Childs, Michael Seymour: The World between Empires \u2013 Art and Identity in the Ancient Middle East, New York 2019, , p. 257, no. 183 Carved gems was a Ptolemaic invention and a common art in the Greco-Roman culture that was also adopted by the Sasanians.
