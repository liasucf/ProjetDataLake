    "text": "Edward Walton Anderson (17 July 1911 \u2013 23 March 1979) was an English footballer, who played at either full-back or wing-half. ==Career== Anderson was playing for Worksop Town when spotted by Wolverhampton Wanderers, moving to Molineux in December 1929. He made his league debut on 11 March 1931 in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale. However, the three games he managed during this season proved his only for the club and he moved to Torquay United in December 1931, where he made his debut on Boxing Day in a 3\u20131 defeat away to Queen's Park Rangers. He remained a regular that season, replacing Bob Smith, and was ever- present the following season as Torquay finished in 10th place in Division Three (South), their highest finish so far. In June 1933 he was signed by Second Division West Ham United, making 26 league appearances (2 goals) before moving again, this time to Chester in June 1935. In two years at Chester, he made only 23 league appearances, before leaving for Tranmere Rovers in July 1937. He helped Tranmere to the Third Division (North) title in his first season, making his debut in a 5\u20130 home win against Carlisle United on 18 September, and was a member of the team relegated straight back down again the following year, though only playing 7 games in the Second Division. The war interrupted his career, but he appeared more frequently for the Prenton Park side after the league restarted in 1946, going on to make a total of 73 league appearances for Rovers. As the 1947/48 season progressed, it appeared that Anderson had played his final game for Rovers. However, he finally reappeared in the league side on 3 January 1948 playing in a 4\u20130 defeat away to one of his previous clubs Chester. His final league appearance came on 27 March that year, playing at right back in a 3\u20132 home defeat by Stockport County. During the Second World War, Anderson had guested for New Brighton and Wrexham. After his playing career ended he spent time on the coaching staff at Tranmere and Stockport. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Tynemouth Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:English Football League players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Everton F.C. wartime guest players Category:Worksop Town F.C. players Category:New Brighton A.F.C. wartime guest players Category:Wrexham F.C. wartime guest players ",
