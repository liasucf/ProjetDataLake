    "text": "The Marianna Commercial Historic District encompasses the historic civic and commercial heart of Marianna, Arkansas, the county seat of Lee County. The district is focused on two blocks of Main Street and two blocks of Poplar Street, which cross at the northwest corner of Court Square, a city park in which the Gen. Robert E. Lee Monument is found, and extends south to include a few buildings on Liberty Street. The city was founded in 1870, and its economy developed around cotton and lumber, which were delivered to market by the L'Anguille River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. The downtown developed a short distance west of the city's boat landing. Its first brick buildings were built in the 1870s, although the oldest to survive now date to the 1880s, including the elaborate Italianate Hayes & Drake building at 38 South Poplar. Court Square Park has long been a major community meeting point, and is faced by the Lee County Courthouse. The district includes seventy buildings, of which forty eight are historically significant. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Lee County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Italianate architecture in Arkansas Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1884 Category:Lee County, Arkansas Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lee County, Arkansas ",
