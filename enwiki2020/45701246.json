He obtained his doctorate from Cornell University in 1938.Alfonso A. Narvaez, \"Bassett Maguire, 86, a Botanist and Expedition Leader, is Dead\", The New York Times, February 8, 1991. Accessed 17 March 2015. In 1931, he was appointed assistant professor of botany at Utah State University, where he started the Intermountain Herbarium and served as its principal collector and curator until 1942. He left his position in Utah when he got a job at the New York Botanical Garden in 1943. Maguire served at the New York Botanical Garden in many roles as Curator (1943-1958); Head Curator (1958-1961); Nathanial Lord Britton Distinguished Senior Curator (1961-1971); Assistant Director (1968-1969); Director of Botany (1969-1971, 1974-1975); Senior Scientist (1972-1974); and Senior Scientist Emeritus from 1975 until his death in 1991. While in Utah, Maguire started work on the Intermountain Flora, a flora on the vascular plants of the intermountain west, but he gradually relinquished work on this project to his former students Noel Holmgren and Arthur Cronquist (and Holmgren's spouse, Patricia Holmgren), as his own interests turned increasingly to tropical America. He led several expeditions to the Guyana Highlands, bringing back thousands of samples. In 1954 he discovered the botanically rich Cerro de la Neblina (\"Mountain of the Clouds\").Maguire, B.
