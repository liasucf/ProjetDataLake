    "text": "Mark of the Devil Part II, or in original German Hexen gesch\u00e4ndet und zu Tode gequ\u00e4lt (lit. \"Witches Are Violated and Tortured to Death\"), is a German horror film released in 1973. It is a sequel to Mark of the Devil. ==Plot== Young noblewoman Elisabeth von Salmenau (Erika Blanc) encounters a group of religious fanatics led by Balthasar von Ross (Anton Diffring) and his henchman Natas (Reggie Nalder). Her husband (Adrian Hoven) is killed and her young son Alexander (Percy Hoven) is deemed the devil's spawn. Elisabeth intends to plead the innocence of her son, but when she refuses Balthasar's advances, she is also deemed a heretic by the corrupt officials, and tortured. ==Production== Although sold as a sequel, the film has no real connection to the first film outside of a similar time period and instances of gratuitous torture. Reggie Nalder, villain in the first film, co-stars here but plays a different character. ==Release== The film was released theatrically in the United States by Hallmark Releasing, distributor of the first film, in 1974. It has been available on VHS in a multitude of releases from different companies, all varying in terms of the violent content, and never been officially released on DVD in the United States. ==External links== * * Category:1973 films Category:1973 horror films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films directed by Adrian Hoven Category:Films set in the 18th century Category:German horror films Category:German-language films Category:Splatter films Category:West German films Category:Witch hunting in fiction ",
