His mother Glaphyra was a Cappadocian Princess, who was of Greek, Armenian and Persian descent. She was the daughter of the King Archelaus of Cappadocia Dueck, Strabo\u2019s cultural geography: the making of a kolossourgia, p.208 and her mother was an unnamed Princess from Armenia,Syme, Anatolica: studies in Strabo, p.150 possibly a relation of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Alexander's name reflected his Hasmonean and Hellenic lineage. == Life == Alexander was born and raised in Herod's court in Jerusalem. After the death and burial of Alexander's father in 7 BC, Herod forced Alexander's mother to return to Cappadocia, forcing her to leave her children under the sole custody of Herod in Jerusalem. Alexander and his brother remained under Herod's guardianship so he could control their fates.Kasher, King Herod: a persecuted persecutor: a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography, p.349 Another son of Herod's Antipater, was concerned for Alexander and his brother as he expected them to attain higher station than their own late fathers, because of the assistance Antipater considered likely from their maternal grandfather Archelaus.Temporini, Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im spiegel der neueren Forschung, p.315 In the time Alexander lived in Herod's court, he was betrothed to the daughter of Pheroras.Kasher, King Herod: a persecuted persecutor: a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography, p.355 Pheroras was Alexander's paternal great-uncle and was Herod's brother.Temporini, Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im spiegel der neueren Forschung, p.315 Antipater persuaded Herod to call off Alexander's betrothal to Pheroras\u2019 daughter because Antipater convinced his father that closer ties between Pheroras and Archelaus of Cappadocia were liable to develop into a plot against Herod.Kasher, King Herod: a persecuted persecutor: a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography, p.355 After the death of Herod in 4 BCMillar, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B.C. - A.D. 135), p.327 in Jericho, Alexander and his brother decided to leave Jerusalem and to live with their mother and her family in Cappadocia. After Alexander and his brother arrived in Cappadocia, they disavowed their Jewish descent, deserted their Jewish religion and embraced their Greek descent, including the religion.Kasher, King Herod: a persecuted persecutor: a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography, p.298 However the family connections to the Herodian Dynasty weren't wholly broken. After Alexander and his brother disavowed their Jewish descent, they were considered among fellow Jews as gentiles.Moen, Marriage and Divorce in the Herodian Family: A Case Study of Diversity in Late Second Temple Judaism, p.233 There is a possibility that his maternal grandfather sent Alexander to be educated in Rome. Little is known of the adult life of Alexander. He appeared to be an administrator for the extensive land estates in Egypt that were owned by the Imperial family of Rome. He was a wealthy landowner in his own right, owing two estates in the Egyptian town of Euhemeria.Jerzy, Polityczne dziedzictwo Heroda Wielkiego. Palestyna w epoce rzymsko-herodia\u0144skiej, p.p.116-118 Alexander married an unnamed noblewoman who bore him a son called Tigranes.Temporini, Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im spiegel der neueren Forschung, p.794 Alexander named his son in honour of his brother. Tigranes later served as a Roman Client King of Armenia under the reign of Roman Emperor Nero (reigned 54-68).Redgate, The Armenians, p.79 Roman Empress Livia Drusilla and her daughter-in-law Antonia Minor were mentioned in Alexander's will. ==References== ==Sources== * Millar, Fergus, Sch\u00fcrer, Emil, Vermes & Geza, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B.C. - A.D. 135), Continuum International Publishing Group, 1973 * H.
