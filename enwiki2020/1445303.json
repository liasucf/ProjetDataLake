DeBarge was one of the members of the singing family vocal group DeBarge, who became famous with their mid-1980s songs \"All This Love\", \"Love Me in a Special Way\", \"Rhythm of the Night\", and \"Who's Holding Donna Now\". ==Early life and career== He is the seventh child born to Robert DeBarge Sr. and Etterlene Abney DeBarge. Like all of his siblings, he was born and raised on the East Side of Detroit, Michigan. The family later relocated to Grand Rapids, Michigan. As of 2000, DeBarge has worked with DJ Quik on such tracks as \"Tha Divorce Song\", as well as \"Get Nekkid\" by slain rapper Mausberg. Also, in 2004, DeBarge made a song with the \"Haitian Sensation\" Won-G for a remix called \"Nothing's Wrong\", using the instrumental for the Quik/DeBarge track \"Tha Divorce Song\".

They were featured in a \"Flashback to the '80s\" concert at San Manuel Casino in Highland, California along with Atlantic Starr, The SOS Band, and the Mary Jane Girls. In El's absence, James handled lead vocals. DeBarge performed three encores despite not being the top billed act. ==Personal life== DeBarge is also known for his 1984 marriage to pop singer Janet Jackson. The marriage was annulled in 1985 due to his cocaine addiction. During their marriage, they lived at the Jackson family home Hayvenhurst.
