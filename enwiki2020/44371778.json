    "text": "As of January 2019, there are 15 women currently serving as lieutenant governors in the United States. 100 women have served overall. Women have been elected lieutenant governor from 43 of the 50 states. The states that have not elected a woman are Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. __TOC__ ==History== The first woman to become lieutenant governor was Matilda Dodge Wilson (R), who was appointed lieutenant governor of Michigan in 1940 by Luren Dickinson. In 1978, Jean King (D) was elected as the first female Asian-American lieutenant governor, when she was elected lieutenant governor of Hawaii. In 2002, Jennette Bradley (R) was elected as the first female African-American lieutenant governor, when she was elected lieutenant governor of Ohio. In 2010, Jennifer Carroll (R) was elected as the first female military veteran lieutenant governor, when she was elected lieutenant governor of Florida. In 2014, Evelyn Sanguinetti (R) was elected as the first female Hispanic or Latino lieutenant governor, when she was elected lieutenant governor of Illinois. Kentucky was the first state to hold a transfer of power from one female lieutenant governor to another, when Martha Layne Collins was elected to succeed Thelma Stovall in 1979. Minnesota has had the most female lieutenant governors or other deputy leaders of any state in the Union, with nine consecutive female lieutenant governors since 1983. However, no female politician has been nominated for governor by any major statewide party in any of Minnesota's gubernatorial elections. No state has or ever had both a female governor and female lieutenant governor at the same time. From 1997 to 2009, Arizona had two female governors and two concurrently serving female secretaries of state. To date, in states without a lieutenant governor, no woman has ever changed parties during her term as a secretary of state or a state senate president, or been elected as a third party member or an independent. ==List of female Lieutenant Governors== *Italics denotes acting lieutenant governor {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name (lifespan) !Portrait !State !Party !Term start !Term end !Length of service !Left for |- | |Lt.
