    "text": "John Peter Fedorowicz (born September 27, 1958) is an American International Grandmaster of chess, and a chess writer from The Bronx, New York. He learned to play chess in 1972, inspired by the Fischer\u2013Spassky World Championship Match coverage on TV and as an enthusiastic youngster, made rapid progress to become co-winner of the 1977 U.S. Junior Championship (with Kenneth Regan) and outright winner in 1978. Fedorowicz, or \"The Fed\" as he is affectionately known on the chess circuit, continued to impress and in 1984 tied for third place in the U.S. Championships, tied for second place at Hastings in 1984\u201385, and tied for second place at Dortmund in 1986. He represented the U.S. at the 1986 Dubai Chess Olympiad and scored well, earning himself the grandmaster title the same year. Since becoming a grandmaster, he has established himself as one of the leading players from United States, chalking up victories at Cannes 1987, Sesimbra 1987, and 1990. He has also won open tournaments, including the New York Open 1989 and the U.S. Open and the World Open in Philadelphia. At Stockholm in 1990, he finished second to Alexei Shirov. Fedorowicz has captained the U.S. Olympiad team on two occasions and has frequently acted as a second to World Championship candidate Gata Kamsky. He has written or co-written a number of chess books and many articles for magazines and on-line publishers. By way of hobbies, he enjoys reading, cooking, playing, and watching sports and a number of other board games, including Monopoly, Risk and Scrabble. As an active 'New Yorker', he spends much of his time in the community, teaching chess to children, giving private lessons, and attending chess camps. ==Books== * * ==References== *U.S. Chess Online == External links == * *A Tribute to Chess and John Fedorowicz Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Chess coaches Category:American chess players Category:American chess writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Writers from the Bronx Category:Sportspeople from the Bronx Category:American sportsmen ",
