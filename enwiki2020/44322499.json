Born in Orimattila, he got a Cand.phil degree in 1881. In 1883 he became publicist of the small \u00c5bo paper Turun Lehti which was published in Finnish but at the same time Svecoman; it became the only newspaper with that combination to reach a wide readership. He also worked as a teacher in \u00c5bo.Johan Fridolf Hagfors Nordisk familjebok. Ugglaupplagen, supplement (1924) He composed several songs for male quartets. Modersm\u00e5lets s\u00e5ng was first performed in 1989 and is today considered an unofficial hymn for the Swedish-speaking population of Finland.Hagfors, Fridolf Uppslagsverket Finland.

In 1912 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Due to stiff competition, Turun Lehti ceased publication in 1919. Hagfors subsequently moved to Stockholm and obtained Swedish citizenship. He died in 1931. Fellow composer Erik August Hagfors was his half-brother. == References == Category:1857 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Finnish composers Category:Finnish male composers Category:Finnish publishers (people) Category:Swedish-speaking Finns Category:National anthem writers ",
