It comprises two words: kritsada (\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e32), from Sanskrit k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101, meaning \"supernatural powers, divine, celestial\"; and phon (\u0e1e\u0e23), meaning \"blessing, benediction, favour\". Often Thai first names are suffixed with phon, denoting \"a blessing from the Buddha\", referring to both the gift of a child, and the favour of particular attributes, referred to within the name, manifesting within the child. In Thai tradition, a child's name is chosen using complex Buddhist name giving rituals where Thai astrology is widely used, often in consultation with a Buddhist monk. Parents of a newly-born child named Kridsadaporn (\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23) may believe, or may accept, the name's meaning as, \"a blessing from the Buddha; a child, gifted with divine qualities and supernatural powers\". == See also == * Asteroid 7604 Kridsadaporn == Notes == == References == Category:Thai names Category:Thai language ",
