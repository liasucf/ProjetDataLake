He is one of just a few Americans to be shot down and captured as a prisoner of war on two occasions, first during World War II and again during the Korean War. == Early life and World War II == John Giraudo was born on October 2, 1923, in Santa Barbara, California. He was attending college in Santa Barbara when Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941. Giruado subsequently dropped out of college and enlisted into the United States Army Air Forces on March 25, 1942 and entered the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On March 10, 1943, Giraudo was commissioned as a second lieutenant and awarded his flying wings. Giraudo was assigned to the 720th Bombardment Squadron at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, where he flew B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators. By late 1943, Giraudo was a squadron leader flying missions with the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean Theater. On February 25, 1944, Captain Giraudo was flying a B-24 on a bombing mission over Regensburg in Bavaria, Germany. Giraudo's aircraft was shot down and he was captured by German troops and taken to Stalag Luft I in Barth. He would spend more than one year as a prisoner of war, until the camp was liberated by Russian troops on April 30, 1945. == Post-World War II == After World War II, Giraudo became the assistant director of flying at Mather Air Force Base, California. While there, he helped establish the first triple-rated (pilot-navigator-bombardier) training course in the United States Air Force. Giraudo graduated from the Air Tactical School in 1947 and Instructor Pilot School in 1948 before he was attached to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. He helped develop the first jet all-weather instrument flying program in the Lockheed T-33. Giraudo then flew F-80 Shooting Stars, F-89 Scorpions, and F-94 Starfires as part of the first all-weather jet interceptor program in the Air Force.

Arriving at Suwon Air Base in November 1952, Giraudo was made the commanding officer of the 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. Giraudo shot down two MiG-15s, and probably downed 1.5 more while flying an F-86 Sabre. While strafing enemy trucks during his 99th combat mission on June 16, 1953, Lieutenant Colonel Giraudo's aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire. Giraudo tried to nurse the F-86 to the sea, but he was forced to eject just one mile from the water. Giraudo landed near enemy troops and was successfully evading them when the life raft in his survival equipment unexpectedly inflated. He was shot through the shoulder and was captured by enemy troops for the second time. Giraudo's wingman, Marine Major John Glenn, circled over the area for a period of time while North Korean soldiers hid Giraudo from sight. Giraudo was taken to a prisoner of war camp, although neither his family nor the Air Force knew he had been taken prisoner and was alive. He was held until October 1953, when he was repatriated during Operation Big Switch. == Later career and life == After the war, Giraudo assumed command of the Aircraft Gunnery School, holding that position until May 1956 when he was assigned as the senior military advisor to the Hawaii Air National Guard. In 1959, he graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. He was then assigned to The Pentagon until 1963.
