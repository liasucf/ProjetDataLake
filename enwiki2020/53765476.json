    "text": "Russian Jews in Israel are immigrants and descendants of the immigrants of the Russian Jewish communities, who now reside within the State of Israel. They number around 900,000. This refers to all post-Soviet Jewish diaspora groups, not only Russian Jews, but also Mountain Jews, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks, Bukharan Jews, and Georgian Jews. ==Immigration history== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\" |- !

Israel is home to a core Russian-Jewish population of 900,000, and an enlarged population of 1,200,000 (including Halakhally non-Jewish members of Jewish households, but excluding those who reside in Israel illegally). The Aliyah in the 1990s accounts for 85\u201390% of this population. The population growth rate for Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants were among the lowest for any Israeli groups, with a fertility rate of 1.70 and natural increase of just +0.5% per year. The increase in Jewish birth rate in Israel during the 2000\u20132007 period was partly due to the increasing birth rate among the FSU immigrants, who now form 20% of the Jewish population of Israel.Wayne State University Press \u2013 Jewish Studies: \u2013 Page 1 96.5% of the enlarged Russian Jewish population in Israel is either Jewish or non-religious, while 3.5% (35,000) belongs to other religions (mostly Christians) and about 10,000 so-called \"messianic Jews\". The Total Fertility Rate for FSU immigrants in Israel is given in the table below. The TFR increased with time, peaking in 1997, then slightly decreased after that, and then again increased after 2000. In 1999, about 1,037,000 FSU immigrants lived in Israel, of whom about 738,900 immigrated after 1989.http://www.middle-east-info.org/league/israel/israelpopulation.pdf The second largest ethnic group (Moroccans) numbered just 1,000,000. From 2000\u20132006, 142,638 FSU immigrants moved to Israel. While 70,000 of them emigrated from Israel to countries like the U.S. and Canada, bringing the total population to 1,150,000 by 2007 January (excluding illegals). The natural increase was around 0.3% in late 1990s. For example 2,456 in 1996 (7,463 births to 5,007 deaths), 2,819 in 1997 (8,214 to 5,395), 2,959 in 1998 (8,926 to 5,967) and 2,970 in 1999 (9,282 to 6,312). In 1999, the natural growth was +0.385%. (Figures only for FSU immigrants moved in after 1989). An estimated 45,000 illegal immigrants from the Former Soviet Union lived in Israel during the end of 2010, but it is not clear how many of them are actually Jews. Currently, Russia has the highest rate of aliyah to Israel among any other country. In 2013, 7,520 people, nearly 40% of all olim, immigrated to Israel from the former Soviet Union. ==Political history== Russian Jews have been very dominant in Israeli politics, due to large number of Russian Jews occupied in the official positions of Israeli Government. Former Israeli Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, claimed ancestry from former Soviet Union's Moldova. Many Russian Jews maintain their tie with Russian motherland, and play an important role on the relationship between Russia and Israel. ==Demographics== Russian-speaking Jews in Israel include an enlarged population of 1,200,000, if including Halakhally non-Jewish members of Jewish households. 96.5% of the enlarged Russian Jewish population in Israel is either Jewish or non-religious, while 3.5% (35,000) belong to other religions (mostly Christianity) and about 10,000 identifying as Messianic Jews separate from Jewish Christians. ===Jews (of all Russian-speaking Jewish ethnic groups) === Soviet and Russian-origin Jews form a core population of around 900,000 in Israel, as of 2007. ===Mixed families=== Some 300,000 Halakhally non-Jewish members of Jewish households lived in Israel, as of 2007. ==Notable people== *Natan Sharansky *Yuri Foreman *Yuli-Yoel Edelstein *Nachman Dushanski *Boris Gelfand *Natasha Mozgovaya *Avigdor Lieberman *Roman Dzindzichashvili *Anastassia Michaeli *Haim Megrelashvili *Victor Mikhalevski *Evgeny Postny *Maxim Rodshtein *Tatiana Zatulovskaya *Maria Gorokhovskaya *Katia Pisetsky *Aleksandr Averbukh *Anna Smashnova *Jan Talesnikov *Vadim Alexeev *Michael Kolganov *Alexander Danilov *Evgenia Linetskaya *Marina Kravchenko *David Kazhdan *Leonid Nevzlin *Vadim Akolzin *Roman Bronfman *Michael Cherney *Victoria Veinberg Filanovsky *Arcadi Gaydamak *Sergei Sakhnovski *Roman Zaretski *Alexandra Zaretski *Larisa Trembovler *Boris Tsirelson *Daniel Samohin *Margarita Levieva *Diana Golbi *Neta Rivkin *Eliezer Sherbatov == See also == *Aliyah *Refusenik *1970s Soviet Union aliyah *1990s Post-Soviet aliyah *Russian language in Israel *History of the Jews in Russia *Jewish ethnic divisions *Israel\u2013Russia relations *Russians in Israel == References == Category:Israeli Jews by national origin Category:Israeli people of Russian-Jewish descent ",
