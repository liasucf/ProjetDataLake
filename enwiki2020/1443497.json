    "text": "Dixie Chicken is the third studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1973. The artwork for the front cover was by illustrator Neon Park https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/park_neon.htm and is a reference to a line from the album's third track, the song \"Roll Um Easy\". The album is considered their landmark album with the title track as their signature song that helped further define the Little Feat sound. This was augmented by two additional members (guitarist Paul Barrere and percussionist Sam Clayton) added to make the more complete and familiar lineup that continued until their 1979 breakup following the death of Lowell George. Bassist Kenny Gradney was brought in to replace original bassist Roy Estrada, who had left after the band's second album Sailin' Shoes to join Captain Beefheart's Magic Band. This new lineup radically altered the band's sound, leaning toward New Orleans R&B;/funk. It was voted number 563 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). ==Track listing== Lowell George lead vocals on all tracks, except where noted: Side One #\"Dixie Chicken\" (Lowell George, Fred Martin) \u2013 3:55 #\"Two Trains\" (George) \u2013 3:06 #\"Roll Um Easy\" (George) \u2013 2:30 #\"On Your Way Down\" (Allen Toussaint) \u2013 5:31 #\"Kiss It Off\" (George) \u2013 2:56 Side Two #\"Fool Yourself\" (Fred Tackett) \u2013 3:10 #\"Walkin' All Night\" (Paul Barr\u00e8re, Bill Payne) \u2013 3:35 (lead vocals: Barrere, Payne) #\"Fat Man in the Bathtub\" (George) \u2013 4:29 #\"Juliette\" (George) \u2013 3:20 #\"Lafayette Railroad\" (George, Payne) \u2013 3:40 (instrumental) == Personnel == *Paul Barrere \u2013 guitar, vocals (first album with group) *Sam Clayton \u2013 congas (first album with group) *Lowell George \u2013 vocals, guitar, cowbell, flute *Kenny Gradney \u2013 bass (first album with group) *Richie Hayward \u2013 drums, vocals *Bill Payne \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer, vocals Additional personnel *Bonnie Bramlett \u2013 backing vocals *Malcolm Cecil \u2013 synthesizer *Tret Fure \u2013 backing vocals *Danny Hutton \u2013 backing vocals *Milt Holland \u2013 tabla *Gloria Jones \u2013 backing vocals *Debbie Lindsey \u2013 backing vocals *Bonnie Raitt \u2013 backing vocals *Stephanie Spruill \u2013 backing vocals *Fred Tackett \u2013 guitar (joined band 1988) *Neon Park - cover art == Notes == == External links == *Rolling Stone review * - provided by Warner Music Group * - provided by Warner Music Group Category:1973 albums Category:Little Feat albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Albums produced by Lowell George Category:Albums with cover art by Neon Park Category:Albums recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders ",
