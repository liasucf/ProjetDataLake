    "text": "Jebediah is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Jebediah. It was recorded at Mangrove Studios, outside Sydney with producer Magoo, and released on 3 March 2002 by record label Murmur. The album debuted at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in the top 50 for five weeks. == Recording == Jebediah was recorded from June to August 2001 at Mangrove Studios, outside Sydney, with production by Magoo (Regurgitator, Spiderbait, Midnight Oil). == Content == Lead guitarist Chris Daymond explained the band's choice of an eponymous title: > Simply calling it Jebediah is something we wanted to do because it doesn't > really point in either direction. We've used some in-jokes in the past in > our work, things that are distinctly our style. Having a self-titled album > this time around is a way of us being the same sort of band, but slightly > older. > \u2014Chris Daymond Vocalist Kevin Mitchell clarified their musical direction: > It's got the raw, live feel, the way we perform songs musically and vocally, > but with more of a studio feel than the previous ones as well. We came in > with a pretty clear idea of what we wanted, just based on previous > experience and how we knew we wanted to change. After the last album [Of > Someday Shambles] we really wanted to breathe some life and spirit into this > one. > \u2014Kevin Mitchell == Promotion == The album's lead single, \"Fall Down\", was released in October 2001, reaching No. 24 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, \"Nothing Lasts Forever\", released in February 2002, peaked in the top 50. The third single, \"N.D.C.\", was released in July, reached the top 100. The fourth and final single, \"October\", released the same year, did not chart. == Release == Jebediah was released on 3 March 2002 by record label Murmur. It debuted at number 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart, but did not achieve Gold record accreditation. === Sony contract === Following the release and promotion of Jebediah, Murmur (a subsidiary of Sony) ceased contractual arrangements with the band. In 2000 the group and their management company, Naked Ape Management (with Heath Bradby as CEO), had created their own label, Redline Records. The label subsequently issued the group's own material, which was distributed by Shock Records. == Reception == Greg Lawrence of Whammo opined that it \"sees a band in their element, brimming with confidence. Led by the tracks 'Fall Down' and 'Nothing Lasts Forever'\". Ed Nimmervoll at Howlspace described their aim \"for the third album they resolved to try to have fun again, recorded relatively quickly\". == Track listing == == Personnel == ; Jebediah * Chris Daymond \u2013 lead guitar * Brett Mitchell \u2013 drums * Kevin Mitchell \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Vanessa Thornton \u2013 bass guitar ; Additional musicians * Dave Orwell \u2013 pedal steel on \"Country Holiday Song\" * Tylea Croucher \u2013 vocals on \"Country Holiday Song\" * Jim MacDonald \u2013 bagpipes on \"Fall Down\" ; Technical personnel * Magoo \u2013 production, recording, mixing * Mangrove Studios \u2013 recording studio == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2002) !align=\"left\"|Peak Position !align=\"left\"|Weeks In |- | Align=\"left\"|Australian ARIA Albums Chart | Align=\"center\"|8 | Align=\"center\"|5 |} == References == Category:2002 albums Category:Jebediah albums Category:Murmur (record label) albums ",
