He owned no property in his name in his native village, which he left in the late 1970s. ==Political life== Intelligence source said that Rao occupies strong military tactics in the form of guerrilla warfare and use of new forms of IEDs. He is not only aggressive on field strategy but strongly committed to Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism ideology. He was involved with the Naxalite movement since the 1970s. When the CPI (ML) Peoples War was formed in 1980 in Andhra Pradesh, he was one of the key organisers. He was the first commander to enter East Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts. Rao along with Mallojula Koteswara Rao alias Kishanji, Mallujola Venugopal and Malla Raji Reddy received training in the forests of Bastar from a group of former fighters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in ambush tactics and the handling of Gelatin in 1987.
