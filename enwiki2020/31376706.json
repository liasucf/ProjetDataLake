    "text": "Alfred Gelder Sir William Alfred Gelder (12 May 1855 \u2013 26 August 1941) was a British architect and Liberal politician. ==Family and education== Gelder was born in the village of North Cave in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the son of William Gelder, a joiner and wheelwright who later became a timber merchant.http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/k-victorian/people/alfred- gelder/alfred-gelder.pdf Although christened William after his father, Gelder was known by his middle name, Alfred. It is not clear how much formal schooling Gelder received and at the age of 15 he was apprenticed to his father. However he changed his mind about following his father's trade and later became an architect. In 1877 he married Elizabeth Parker from Hull. They had two sons and a daughter. Elizabeth Gelder died in 1934 and Alfred did not remarry.Who was Who, OUP 2007 ==Career== Gelder in 1904 in mayoral robes Gelder wanted to be an architect and he went to Hull to seek out opportunities. He must have acquired some qualifications because in the year after his marriage to Elizabeth Parker he established an architectural practice. It is known that he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree and he later became a Fellow of the Royal Societyhttp://www.ebooksread.com/authors- eng/charles-a-manning-press/yorkshire-leaders-social-and-political- ser/page-6-yorkshire-leaders-social-and-political-ser.shtml as well as being a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.The Times, 2 November 1922 p5 In 1892 he formed an association with Llewellyn Kitchen, the son of a commercial traveller from Manchester and set up the firm of Gelder and Kitchen in which he was the senior partner.http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/k-victorian/people/alfred- gelder/alfred-gelder.pdf Gelder had entered the architectural profession at the time of the Victorian era development of Hull. According to one source it was largely thanks to Gelder's ability and energy that Hull was a city transformed \u2013 with old buildings removed, new wide streets introduced and attractive shops and public offices erected. Under Gelder's supervision, Hull was being hailed as one of the country's finest citiesWilliam Andrews & Elsie Lang, Old English Towns, Volume 1; T W Laurie, 1931 p187 with the slums and disorder of the Victorian city giving way to broad, straight thoroughfares.Keith Brooker, The Hull strikes of 1911; East Yorkshire Local History Society, 1979 p1 During Gelder's time the city centre was reconstructed and a new bridge, the Drypool Bridge, was built across the River Hull. In recognition of Gelder's contributions, the new road built through the city centre to link with this bridge was named Alfred Gelder Street. In the 1930s Gelder was associated with the works to transform Queen's Dock into Queen's Gardens. One of Gelder and Kitchen's specialisms was the design of flour mills and oilseed crushing mills at a time when Hull was a major European centre for the industry. One of the firm's most famous clients for its revolutionary roller mill was Joseph Rank who, like Gelder, was a noted Methodist and Gelder also did architectural work for Joseph Rank's son, the industrialist and film producer, J Arthur Rank.Michael Wakelin, J Arthur Rank: the man behind the gong; Lion Publications, 1997 p38 His devout attachment to Methodism caused Gelder to design numerous chapels, including the Brunswick Chapel on Holderness Road in 1890 and the Princes Avenue Chapel in 1904. As well as in Hull, there were commissions for chapels and flour mills, from all over the country.http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/k-victorian/people/alfred- gelder/alfred-gelder.pdf ==Politics== Gelder in 1904 in mayoral robes Like many self-made men of non-conformist religion in Victorian and Edwardian England, Gelder gravitated to Liberal politics.Stephen Koss, Nonconformity in Modern British Politics; B T Batsford, 1975 esp. Ch 1 The Victorian Prelude In 1892 he became a member of the Hull School Board and three years later joined the City Council.http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/charles-a-manning- press/yorkshire-leaders-social-and-political-ser/page-6-yorkshire-leaders- social-and-political-ser.shtml From 1899-1903 Gelder was Liberal Mayor of HullThe Times, 11 November April 1902 p12 and in all was a member of the council, later in the office of Alderman, for 43 years. In 1930 he received the Honorary Freedom of the City.Justice of the peace and local government review, Vol 94 p637 In 1910, Gelder was selected as Liberal candidate for Brigg in north Lincolnshire. Since its creation in 1885, Brigg had been mostly a Liberal seat but it had been lost to the Conservatives in a by-election in 1907 when the Liberal candidate was Frederick Guest. Guest was then selected to fight East DorsetF W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918;Macmillan Press, 1974 p337 and the Brigg constituency Liberals turned to Gelder as their candidate.
