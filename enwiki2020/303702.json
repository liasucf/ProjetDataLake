    "text": "Caersws Football Club () is a football team, playing in the Ardal Leagues North East. The club was founded in 1887 as Caersws Amateurs, and adopted the present name when amateur status was dropped in 1974. The team plays at the Recreation Ground, Caersws, which accommodates 4000 spectators (375 seated). The team's first choice strip is blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. The second choice strip is orange shirts, black shorts and orange socks. == History == Although founded in the late 19th century, the club enjoyed little if any success until the 1960s when it won the Mid-Wales League in 1959\u201360, 1960\u201361, and 1962\u201363, and appeared in three Welsh Amateur Cup finals, winning the cup in 1960\u201361. They also won the cup (now renamed the Welsh Intermediate Cup) in 1989. In the league, the team's fortunes waned until they won the title again in 1978, and four more times before they were invited to join the Cymru Alliance in 1990. In 1992 they became founder members of the League of Wales. Caersws won the League Cup in 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302, and played in the Intertoto Cup, being defeated 3\u20131 on aggregate by PFC Marek Dupnitsa of Bulgaria. == Biggest victories and losses == *Biggest win: 20\u20131 v.
