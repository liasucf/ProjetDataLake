Tracks 1 to 7 are from No Mercy, No Remorse and tracks 8 to 14 are from The X-Factor. Track 15 is an untitled hidden track.Notes: No Mercy, No Remorse. Discogs. Retrieved on 2010-01-09. == Reception == Allmusic - \"Four years after his debut album, The RBX Files, RBX resurfaced on Street Solid with his sophomore effort, No Mercy, No Remorse/The X-Factor. While a four-year wait between albums wouldn't be as big of a deal in jazz, blues, pop, or country, it's an eternity in hip-hop -- a genre in which trends and tastes can change radically in the course of a few years. And when you consider that the release of The RBX Files was delayed a few years because of RBX's problems with Dr. Dre in the early 1990s, you're really talking more than a four-year gap between albums. But delays and all, RBX's rapping style still sounds quite fresh on this 1999 CD...No Mercy, No Remorse/The X-Factor is a respectable, long overdue follow-up from an MC who should have recorded a lot more often in the 1990s.\" == Track listing == == References == == External links == * No Mercy, No Remorse at Discogs Category:RBX albums Category:1999 albums Category:Gangsta rap albums by American artists Category:G-funk albums ",
