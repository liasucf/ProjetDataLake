    "text": "The Newberry 1919 lynching attempt was the attempted lynching of Elisha Harper, Newberry, South Carolina on July 24, 1919. Harper was sent to jail for insulting a 14 year-old girl. ==Attempted lynching== Elisha Harper, 25 years old, was the son of the Rev. T. F. Harper, a respectable and \"well-behaved preacher\" living in Helena. He fought in the army during World War I and just returned from Europe. On July 24, 1919, while walking the streets of Newberry, South Carolina he allegedly insulted a 14-year-old girl who promptly reported him to the authorities. He was arrested and thrown in jail. Soon a white mob had gathered and would have lynched Harper if it wasn't for Sheriff Blease who bundled and hid him away. ==Aftermath== This uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer, of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars. ==See also== *Washington race riot of 1919 *Mass racial violence in the United States *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States ==Bibliography== Notes References * * * Category:1919 in South Carolina Category:1919 in military history Category:1919 riots in the United States Category:July 1919 events Category:African-American history between emancipation and the civil rights movement Category:History of racism in South Carolina Category:History of the United States (1918\u20131945) Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Riots and civil disorder in South Carolina Category:White American riots in the United States Category:Lynching attempts ",
