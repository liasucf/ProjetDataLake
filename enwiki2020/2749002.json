As the only black reporter covering the story for a national newspaper, Rowan struck a special friendship with the boycott's leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr. When news of an unlikely compromise settlement of the boycott came to Rowan's attention across the Associated Press wire, he notified King, who made quick steps to discredit the story, which was about to appear in a Montgomery newspaper, thus ensuring the continuance of the boycott. ==Project Excellence== Founded in 1987 by Rowan, Project Excellence was a college scholarship program for black high-school seniors who displayed outstanding writing and speaking skills. Rowan founded Project Excellence to combat negative peer pressure felt by black students and to reward students who rose above stereotypes and negative peer influence and excelled academically. Chaired by Rowan, a committee of journalists, community leaders, and school officials oversaw the program. Participants were African- American students in their senior year of high school from public, private, and parochial schools in the metropolitan Washington area, including the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. By 2000 the program had given out $26 million in scholarship money to over 1150 students. ==Shooting controversy== Rowan gained public notoriety on June 14, 1988, when he shot an unarmed teenage trespasser, Ben Smith. \"The interloper was a near-naked teenager who had been skinny-dipping with friends in Rowan's pool, and the columnist's weapon was an unregistered, and thus illegal, .22 caliber pistol.\"Carl M. Cannon, \"Columnist Rowan Shoots Young Intruder\", Philly.com, June 15, 1988. From People magazine: \"When Rowan heard the police arrive, he stepped outside to let them in. It was then, he says, that he was confronted by \"a tall man who was smoking something that I absolutely was sure was marijuana.\" Rowan says he repeatedly warned the intruder that he was armed and would shoot. \"My first words were: 'Freeze! Stay where you are!' \" says Rowan. \"Then I said, 'I have a gun.' \" Rowan says the man kept coming and that he finally felt forced to shoot in self-defense. He says he aimed at the intruder's feet but hit him in the wrist when the man lunged forward. The intruder, Chevy Chase, Maryland, teenager Benjamin Smith, 18, tells a different story. \"I was in my underwear,\" he told a radio interviewer. \"I just climbed out of the pool. It was pretty innocent. I never spoke with him. He just shot me and closed the door and went back hiding in his house. I mean, I guess I was trespassing. But that's no reason to shoot a person, is it? For swimming in their pool?\"Susan Schindehette, \"By Plugging a Teenage Intruder, Columnist Carl Rowan May Have Shot Himself in the Foot\", People, July 4, 1988. Rowan was charged for firing a gun that he did not legally own. Rowan was arrested and tried. During the trial, he argued that he had the right to use whatever means necessary to protect himself and his family. He also said the pistol he used was exempt from the District's handgun prohibition law because it belonged to his older son, a former FBI agent. He was called out for hypocrisy, since Rowan was a strict gun control advocate. In a 1981 column, he advocated \"a law that says anyone found in possession of a handgun except a legitimate officer of the law goes to jail--period.\" In 1985, he called for \"A complete and universal federal ban on the sale, manufacture, importation and possession of handguns (except for authorized police and military personnel).Cal Thomas, \"Arms And The Columnist: The Making Of A 'Gun Nut'\", Philly.com, June 22, 1988. Rowan was tried but the jury was deadlocked; the judge declared a mistrial and he was never retried. In his autobiography, Rowan said he still favors gun control, but admits being vulnerable to a charge of hypocrisy.More Use Guns In Self Defense ==Bibliography== * South of Freedom (1952) * The Pitiful and the Proud (1956) * Go South to Sorrow (1957) * Wait till Next Year: The Life Story of Jackie Robinson (1960) * Just Between Us Blacks (1974) * Breaking Barriers: A Memoir (1991) * Growing up Black: From The Slave Days to the Present - 25 African- Americans Reveal the Trials and Triumphs of Their Childhoods (contributor, 1992) * Dream Makers, Dream Breakers: The World of Justice Thurgood Marshall (1993) * The Coming Race War in America: A Wake-Up Call (1996) ==Notes== ==External links== *\"Carl T.
