    "text": "Charles John Carter (died 1851) was an architect and surveyor working in Louth, Lincolnshire. Sir Howard Colvin suggests that he may have come to Louth from Brereton in Staffordshire around 1832. Colvin notes that the plan he made in 1832 of Louth Vicarage is signed \u2018\u2018Charles John Carter of Brereton, Staffs. surveyor.\u2019\u2019 \u201dColvin\u201d (1995) , pg.226 Most of the work that he undertook was the building or restoration of churches and designing rectories and vicarages. He also appears to have been closely connected with the laying out and construction of houses at Cleethorpes, following the Enclosure Act in 1842. This was a period of rapid development at Cleethorpes, as it developed into a popular sea bathing resort. He had a house in Upgate, Louth and also an office in Westgate, Louth. He was a great collector of antiquities and had an extensive architectural library and collection of drawings. Following his death an auction sale was held of his possessions, which lasted for four days. Following his death, he may have been succeeded in his Louth practice by Maughan and Fowler. ==Architectural work== ===House=== *The Sycamores, Westgate, Louth. (1837). Re-modelled for the Revd.
