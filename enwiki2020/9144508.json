    "text": "The Brigg by-election, 1948 was a by-election held on 24 March 1948 for the British House of Commons constituency of Brigg in Lincolnshire. The by- election was triggered by the resignation of the constituency's Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) Tom Williamson, a trade union leader who had held the seat since the 1945 general election. The result was a victory for the Labour candidate Lance Mallalieu, who held the seat with a reduced majority, and represented Brigg until he retired from the House of Commons in 1974. == Votes == == References == * * == See also == * List of United Kingdom by- elections * Wansbeck constituency Category:1948 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1948 in England Category:March 1948 events Category:20th century in Lincolnshire Category:Brigg Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Lincolnshire constituencies ",
