    "text": "Boo Boo Runs Wild is a stand-alone special parody of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series The Yogi Bear Show. It was made by The Ren & Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi and his company Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8. Boo Boo Runs Wild originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 24, 1999, along with A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith, a similar Yogi Bear-themed stand-alone special. Despite Boo Boo being the arguable star of this short, it is title carded as \"A Ranger Smith Cartoon\". The short is dedicated to Ed Benedict, the original character designer for The Yogi Bear Show and other Hanna-Barbera properties of the 1950s-1960s. Since its original debut in 1999, Boo Boo Runs Wild has aired multiple times on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. Strangely, whenever aired on Adult Swim, it retains its original TV-Y7 rating and was never rerated to TV-PG. From January 2006 until April 2006 Boo Boo Runs Wild aired every Sunday on Adult Swim. On April 1, 2006, following the normal Neon Genesis Evangelion bump, Adult Swim aired Boo Boo Runs Wild as an April Fool's Day joke, despite all TV listings showing Evangelion in its normal time slot. Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo Runs Wild on Halloween night, October 31, 2008, as part of an advertised \"Halloween Stunt\" night, where obscure or randomly seen shows preempted the usual programming for that Friday night. In 2011 Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo Runs Wild every night from January 10 until January 14, as part of their \"DVR Theatre\". It aired again on the nights of August 12, 2016, September 5, 2017 and January 6, 2019. ==Plot== Just when Ranger Smith is making sure everything in Jellystone Park is in order, Boo Boo enters a feral state due to his impatience with all the rules, much to the displeasure of Ranger Smith, who expected Yogi Bear to do this. Boo Boo's actions go from clawing the backsides off trees to savagely devouring honey from a hive, which even convinces Cindy Bear to go feral as well. After Ranger Smith is alerted to this, he is ordered to put Boo Boo down by his chief. Yogi and the Ranger get into a physical altercation over this, finally Yogi ends up beating Ranger. When Boo Boo witnesses this, he tries to stop the fight, but is knocked out by Yogi. This, along with Ranger Smith throwing water on him returns him to normal, much to everyone's' delight and the cartoon ends. ==Voice cast== * John Kricfalusi as Boo Boo Bear, Tree * Stephen Worth as Yogi Bear * Corey Burton as Ranger John Smith, Moose * Mary Ellen Thomas as Cindy Bear * Michael Pataki as The Chief ==See also== * A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith * Boo-Boo Bear * Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1999 television specials Category:Animated television specials Category:American parody films Category:Yogi Bear Category:Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 Category:1990s American animated films Category:American films ",
