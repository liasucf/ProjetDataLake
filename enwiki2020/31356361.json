    "text": "Judith Stacey (born 1943) is an author and Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and Sociology at New York University. Her primary focus areas include family studies, gender studies, queer studies, and sexuality. Her book Unhitched explores family configurations that deviate from the standard Western concept of \"marriage\", including polygamous families in South Africa, the Mosuo people in southwestern China, and intimacy and parenthood among gay men in Los Angeles, California. She has published many works. Her paper, co- authored with Timothy Biblarz, \"How Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter?\" found that children with gay or lesbian parents \"are well-adjusted, have good levels of self-esteem and are as likely to have high educational attainments as children raised in more traditional heterosexual families.\" Stacey received her bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1964. She received her Master of Arts in history from the University of Illinois in 1968, and her Ph.D. in sociology from Brandeis in 1979. In 1971, Stacey founded the women's studies program at Richmond College (which became the College of Staten Island, City University of New York).Love, Barbara J.
