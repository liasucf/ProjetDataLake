She is famous for her participation in the Inconfid\u00eancia Mineira for Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1789. She is also known for her engagement to Neoclassical poet Tom\u00e1s Ant\u00f3nio Gonzaga and his _Mar\u00edlia de Dirceu_ , in which he immortalized her as the object of his love. While Gonzaga extolled Mar\u00edlia's physical beauty at length, her younger first cousin, the poet Beatriz Francisca de Assis Brand\u00e3o, tells us Mar\u00edlia was also a lively, quick-witted, and well- spoken person who tended toward sarcasm. She has been the subject of a TV series and a film and have been featured on a stamp. ==References== * SCHUMAHER, Maria Aparecida. Dicion\u00e1rio mulheres do Brasil: De 1500 at\u00e9 a atualidade.
