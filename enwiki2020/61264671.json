His highest score came in his second match, when he scored 12 and 64 and took 2 for 45 and 3 for 56 against Wellington in the Plunket Shield. His best bowling figures came a year later against Auckland, when in Canterbury's four-wicket victory he took 4 for 21 and 2 for 73 and made 35. When there was speculation about the possible addition of a 15th player to the New Zealand team to tour England in 1931, Lester was one of the players in contention; however, only 14 toured. A year later he was twelfth man for New Zealand in the First Test against South Africa in 1931-32, played in Christchurch.R.T. Brittenden, New Zealand Cricketers, A.H. & A.W.
