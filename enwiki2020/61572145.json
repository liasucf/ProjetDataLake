The i and The Daily Mirror were not impressed with the opening episode; Sara Wallis wrote \"This soap opera-style comedy was not my cup of Yorkshire. But let\u2019s hope it warms up.\" Emily Baker, writing in The i, said \"BBC One\u2019s new comedy Scarborough is missing one key element \u2013 humour\", continuing with \"Scarborough\u2019s complete lack of laughs is more frustrating than upsetting.\" Michael Hogan, writing in The Daily Telegraph, was more positive about the start of the sitcom stating that whilst it was \"not an unqualified success\", but that it was \"...a promising start.\" Of particular note for Hogan was Claire Sweeney as Hayley; \"[Sweeney] hammed it up Dynasty-style as the local man-eater, all hairspray, leopardskin and cat-clawed one-liners (\u201cI might be a slag and a home-wrecker but I\u2019m very good at both\u201d).\" Likewise, in The Guardian, Graeme Virtue was in admiration of Sweeney's on-screen character, saying \"...Sweeney brings some powerful energy as the local man-eater.\" ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2019 British television series endings Category:2010s British sitcoms Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:BBC high definition shows Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Yorkshire Category:Scarborough, North Yorkshire ",
