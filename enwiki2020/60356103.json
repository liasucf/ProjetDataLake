Luca Carboni through the official social network Instagram unveiled the title and cover of the new album on 26 April 2018, while the day after the release date and the tracklist. Nineteenth overall album of the artist, Sputnik was produced by Michele Canova Iorfida and arrives three years after the last pop-up album. The album consists of nine unreleased tracks, including the single forerunner Una Grande Festa extracted on April 27, 2018 and Io non voglio on September 14, 2018. For the title of the album Carboni was inspired by the name of the satellite Sputnik 1 (which means traveling companion) (of the Sputnik Program) launched into orbit by the Russians in 1957. The cover was designed by Carboni himself and depicts himself dressed as an astronaut, with the Russian satellite behind him, the moon and other objects. The album contains nine pieces to recall the measure of the old vinyls to which the artist has remained attached and the thread that links all the songs is love is sometimes dashed with irony (Digital Love), sprayed with quotes by Charles Bukowski (I do not want) and sentences of the poet Wis\u0142awa Szymborska traced here and there. The album version is published in CD format and also in LP format with purple colored vinyl. ==Track listing== # Una grande festa \u2013 3:10 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Federica Camba, Valerio Carboni, Daniele Coro \u2013 music: Valerio Carboni, Federica Camba, Daniele Coro) # 2 \u2013 3:16 (lyric: Luca Carboni \u2013 music: Christian Rigano) # Amore digitale \u2013 3:05 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Alessandro Raina \u2013 music: Alessandro Raina, Dario Faini, Vanni Casagrande) # Io non voglio \u2013 2:57 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Calcutta \u2013 music: Calcutta, Dario Faini) # Ogni cosa che tu guardi \u2013 3:42 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Alessandro Raina, Lorenzo Urciullo \u2013 music: Alessandro Raina, Dario Faini) # I film d'amore \u2013 3:17 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Alessandro Raina, Lorenzo Lombardi \u2013 music: Alessandro Raina, Dario Faini) # L'alba \u2013 3:11 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Flavio Pardini \u2013 music: Flavio Pardini, Luca Serpenti) # Prima di partire \u2013 3:31 (lyric: Luca Carboni, Giorgio Poti, Dario Faini \u2013 music: Giorgio Poti, Dario Faini) # Sputnik \u2013 4:14 (Luca Carboni) ==References== Category:2018 albums ",
