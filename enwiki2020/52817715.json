    "text": "Chakrulo (, transliterated: chak'rulo) is a Georgian polyphonic choral folk song. It is a three-part drinking song from the region of Kakheti, dramatising preparations for a battle. It is characterized by two highly ornamented individual vocal parts, against a slow moving drone chorus. When Georgian vocal polyphony was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Heritage masterpiece in 2001, Chakrulo was cited as a prime example of this. Chakrulo was one of 29 musical compositions included on the Voyager Golden Records that were sent into space on Voyager 2 on 20 August 1977. == See also == * UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists * Music of Georgia (country) ==References== Category:Songs of Georgia (country) Category:Contents of the Voyager Golden Record ",
