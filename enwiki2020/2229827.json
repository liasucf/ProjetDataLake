    "text": "Bailrigg FM (formerly known as University Radio Bailrigg (URB) and Radio Bailrigg) is a student radio station at Lancaster University. It operates in a music format predominantly featuring pop, but also broadcasts news, drama, comedy, and entertainment. During evening and weekend hours, programming moves to specialist content where presenters are free (within reason) to play whatever they wish. Bailrigg is one of the oldest student radio stations in the country,Although a contentious and hard to verify claim, this student society has long claimed it was the first of the UK student stations permitted a licence to actually start broadcasting. The claim of \"first permanent FM student station\" is a matter of interpretation. Radio Station Management reported back to society members during the negotiations that the Radio Authority believed the station to be the first to have a permanent FM licence. Oxford University later made the same claim. However, Bailrigg FM was from 1996 onwards limited to the campus of Lancaster University and broadcast initially only during term-time, whereas the colleges of Oxford University are spread across the city of Oxford, which made it the first permanent FM radio station run by students and available to the general public (and a rival to local independent radio for advertising revenue). Potentially the only way to verify any of the claims would be to access the archive of the Radio Authority (which is now a part of Ofcom). as well as being the first student station to broadcast on FM. It airs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year round. Bailrigg first broadcast on FM as part of a one-month, 25W Restricted Services Licence in March 1994 under the directorship of Paul Dale. It had previously applied for a licence in September 1993 but was turned down by the Radio Authority due to the launch of The Bay in March of that year. It originally broadcast to the university on 312m Medium Wave using an inductive loop aerial system around the various halls of residence. Now listeners can tune in on campus on 87.7 MHz, or listen anywhere in the world using the station's live webstream. Bailrigg holds several large events throughout the year, including a seven-day Freshers' Week outside broadcast and coverage of the Lancaster University Students' Union (LUSU) sabbatical elections. During the Roses Tournament the station joins with University Radio York (URY) to provide programming across both campuses. The station has received several national Student Radio Awards over the years, including Best Website, Best Station Sound and more recently Best Technical Achievement.Winners announced for Student Radio Awards - http://radiotoday.co.uk/2012/11/winners-announced-for- student-radio-awards/ It was announced in April 2019 that LUSU would stop funding the license required to broadcast FM frequencies, and as such the station would only be available online from August onwards. After protest over the decision however, funding was given in August for the license to be renewed. ==History== * 1968 \u2013 Students at York University get permission to test-transmit programmes on Medium Wave, inspiring Lancaster to follow suit. * 1969 - After problems with an over-eager student starting his own pirate radio station, permission is finally given to proceed with the project. * 1971 - The initial aerial and studio equipment is installed. * 1972 - URB is forced off air by the government for transmitting without a full licence. * 1973 - A new antenna system is installed and URB gains a full licence from the government. * 1974 - Twin studios are built in Fylde College. * 1994 - First four-week 25W licence to broadcast on 87.7 MHz (under the name Bailrigg FM) is received.
