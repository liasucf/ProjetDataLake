    "text": "Home for the Holidays is the sixth studio album and first Christmas album by American recording artist Anthony Hamilton. It was released on October 21, 2014, by RCA Records. ==Critical reception== Allmusic editor Andy Kellman found that \"Hamilton delivers a mostly upbeat mix of original material and renditions of traditional secular and religious Christmas-themed songs [..] The singer adds his typically hospitable tones to each of the selections, whether it's a faithful version of James Brown's \"Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto\" or an energized spin on \"Little Drummer Boy.\" This is more imaginative and festive than the average Christmas album.\" ==Track listing== ==Credits and personnel== Credits are taken from the album's liner notes. ;Managerial * A&R; \u2013 Adonis Sutherlin * Executive producers \u2013 Anthony Hamilton, Kelvin Wooten, Eli Davis * Management \u2013 Eli Davis * Project coordinator \u2013 Kimrie Davis ;Visuals and imagery * Photography and design \u2013 LaVan Anderson * Styling \u2013 Charity Luvs ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014) ! scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 92 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 Christmas albums Category:Anthony Hamilton (musician) albums Category:Christmas albums by American artists Category:Contemporary R&B; Christmas albums Category:RCA Records Christmas albums ",
