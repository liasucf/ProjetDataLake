    "text": "Jaguar is a 2016 Indian Kannada-language romantic action film, produced by H. D. Kumaraswamy under his banner Channambika Films and directed by Mahadev. It features Nikhil Gowda, who is the son of the producer H. D. Kumaraswamy, and Deepti Sati in the lead roles, while Tamannaah made a debut in Kannada- language and was seen in an Item number. The music was composed by S. Thaman, and the fight scenes were choreographed by Ram-Lakshman masters. The film was released worldwide on 6 October 2016 and was dubbed into Hindi under the same title. == Plot == The movie opens with a lawyer suggesting his friend over the phone to watch \"SS News Channel\" to watch a live murder being shown. He cuts the call, saying that he will call after watching the murder and switches to that channel, when the power is cut. He commands a computer repairman who had come to repair his PC to check out what happened to the power and tells him to turn it on when lightning strikes and the repairman's face is shown. The repairman (Nikhil Kumar) then reveals that he is the one who hacked the channel and put that notification there and tells the lawyer that he is the one who is going to die and eventually manages to kill him while broadcasting it through a drone camera and escapes after defeating all of the security guards. The next day, a CBI officer (Jagapathi Babu) arrives to solve the case and names the case and the killer as Jaguar. The next day, there is an speech ceremony by SS Medical College's topper Arya (Aadarsh Balakrishna), who gets elected as the student leader and vows that there will be no ragging in the college hereafter and proceeds to welcome the first years. One of the first years happens to be Krishna (Nikhil Kumar) or \"SS Krishna\", as he likes to call himself, and stages a drama saying that ragging is essential to a college since it bridges the senior-junior gap and provides a platform for juniors to display their talents, to which the rest of the first years agree. Krishna then walks towards Arya and tells him that he will go after his sister Priya (Deepti Sati) next and bets that he will make her fall in love with him to which Arya's friend, who is apparently in love with Priya, gets enraged and is about to attack Krishna when Arya prevents him, saying that his sister is not that innocent. The next day, Krishna follows Priya, gets a pizza, and proposes to her friend (Vidyullekha Raman), to which Priya gets enraged and tells that she knows his techniques and that she will not fall for him. Krishna then acts like crying and leaves the place while the other girls tell Priya to apologize. The next day, Krishna makes fun of Priya in class and also teases Arya. Priya later reciprocates his love after he treats a poor man, which was impossible, and gives the credit to Arya. Later, Krishna murders a police officer in same way. It is later revealed that Krishna is the son of Dr. Ramachandra (Rao Ramesh), a person who cared for poors and was cheated in the name of sexual harassment by Sreekar Prasad and Somnath Prasad (Sampath Raj and Adithya Menon), for which he committed suicide. His mother (Ramya Krishna) then looked after him. Finally, Krishna kills both the villains (Sreekar and Somnath) and reconciles with his mother, Priya (who had left him thinking that he will leave her for money), and Arya, who now accepts to give Priya to him. ==Cast== * Nikhil Kumar as Krishna * Deepti Sati as Priya * Jagapathi Babu as CBI Officer * Aadarsh Balakrishna as Arya * Rao Ramesh as Dr. Ramachandran, Krishna's father * Ramya Krishna as Krishna's mother * Sampath Raj as Sreekar Prasad * Adithya Menon as Somnath Prasad * Vidyullekha Raman as Priya's friend * Avinash as College Principal * Raghu Babu as CBI Officer Raghu * Saurav Lokesh as Ajay * Supreeth as \"Encounter\" Shankar * Ravi Kale as Judge * Brahmanandam (Telugu version) as Fake Jaguar * Sadhu Kokila (Kannada version) as Fake Jaguar * Prashanth Siddi * Kavita Radheshyam (Guest Appearance) * Tamannaah as an item number \"Sampige\" ==Production== In December 2015, it was revealed that Nikhil Kumar, son of H.
