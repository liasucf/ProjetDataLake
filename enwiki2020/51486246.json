    "text": "\"Ain't My Fault\" is a song by Swedish singer Zara Larsson. It was released on 2 September 2016, by TEN Music Group, Epic Records, and Sony Music, as the third single from her second and international debut studio album, So Good. The official remix features American rapper Lil Yachty. ==Background== In an interview with Shazam, Larsson said about the first version of the song: \"The topic is me talking to a girl about her man, and I basically stole her man, and I'm like, 'It's not my fault that I'm better you'.\" The song was written in a few hours with MNEK for fun and never intended as a single, but when the studio loved it, her reaction was, \"Whoa whoa whoa I can't sing this.\" So she changed the lyrics of the song to reflect her values: \"I would never be proud of stealing a girl's man and sing about it, it would be very not me.\"Interview with BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 1 ==Music video== The music video was released on 30 September 2016 via Larsson's official Vevo account. It was directed by Emil Nava and primarily features Larsson performing dance moves with her girlfriends. ==Critical reception== Robbie Daw of Idolator stated the song is \"a sexy departure from the somber dulcet tones of 'Never Forget You' and the sassy pop swagger of 'Lush Life'\" and went on to call it a \"Rihanna-esque banger\" and a \"saucy gem\". Entertainment Weeklys Nolan Feeney called the song \"bold\" and \"club-ready\". ==Track listing== *Digital download #\"Ain't My Fault\" \u2013 3:44 *Digital download #\"Ain't My Fault\" (J Hus & Fred VIP Mix) \u2013 3:31 *Digital download #\"Ain't My Fault\" (R3hab Remix) \u2013 2:38 *Digital download #\"Ain't My Fault\" (Remix) (featuring Lil Yachty) \u2013 3:58 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016\u201317) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20) | 18 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mexico Airplay (Billboard) | 42 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Romania (Media Forest) | 8 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
