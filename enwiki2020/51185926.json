    "text": "Jeolikote is a hill station in the Nainital district of the state of Uttarakhand, India. Jeolikote is situated at an altitude of 1,219 meters. It is also known as the Gateway to Naini Lake. It is an ideal place for those who are interested in floral culture and butterfly catching. It acts as a pit stop for not only the tourists en route to Nainital, but also for the daily commuters who travel back and forth between Haldwani and Nainital. A glass of tea with 'bread pakora' at the 'Verma Jalpan Grah' with the picturesque views of the mountains and the blistering sunshine, is the perfect trailer to the beauty which lies ahead (Nainital). In the pre-independence era, it used to be halt point for British to acclimatize before moving to the summer capital Nainital. This place is very fertile for vegetable and fruits. You will find many old British structures in Jeolikote. ==References== ==External links== https://uttarakhandtourism.gov.in/destination/jeolikot/ Category:Hill stations in Uttarakhand Category:Nainital district ",
