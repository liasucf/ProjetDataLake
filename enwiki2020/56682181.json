    "text": "Courtney Anne Webb (born 30 November 1999) is a cricketer and Australian rules footballer from Launceston, Tasmania. A right-handed batter and right-arm medium-pace bowler, Webb currently plays for South Australia in the Women's National Cricket League and for the Melbourne Renegades in the Women's Big Bash League. == Cricket == Webb made her Women's National Cricket League debut for Tasmania in the first match of the 2017\u201318 season, scoring four runs with the bat and finishing with bowling figures of 2/28 in a seven-wicket loss to Western Australia. Ahead of the 2020\u201321 season, she declined to re-sign with Tasmania and instead accepted an offer to play for South Australia. In February 2018, Webb was selected in the under-19 national women's squad, set to tour South Africa during April. She was named vice-captain of the 50-over team which played in a tri-series against South Africa Emerging Women and the England Women's Academy. Webb signed with the Melbourne Renegades in the Women's Big Bash League ahead of the 2018\u201319 season. She debuted on 8 December 2018 at the Junction Oval in a six-wicket win against the Adelaide Strikers, though she was not required to bat. Her most significant contribution of the season came on 29 December at Docklands Stadium, when she scored 21 not out and helped the Renegades narrowly defeat the Melbourne Stars with one ball to spare. It was just the second one-wicket victory in the league's history. The Renegades re-signed Webb ahead of the 2019\u201320 season. She delivered a breakout performance on 17 November 2019 against the Sydney Sixers at Drummoyne Oval by scoring 34 not out, hitting a six off the final ball to clinch a two-wicket victory and earning Player of the Match honours. == Football == Webb played two matches for Carlton in the AFL Women's (AFLW) competition. After being passed over in the 2017 national draft, Webb was ultimately drafted by Carlton with their third selection and the 17th overall pick in the rookie draft. She made her debut during round four of the 2018 season in a 73-point loss to the Western Bulldogs at VU Whitten Oval. In April 2019, Webb was delisted by Carlton. Despite injuries and the struggle to balance two sports, it was reported she would continue to play football at local level for Launceston and hadn't ruled out attempting to return to AFLW in the future. == References == == External links == * *Courtney Webb at Melbourne Renegades * * Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Melbourne Renegades (WBBL) cricketers Category:South Australian Scorpions cricketers Category:Australian women cricketers Category:Sportswomen from Tasmania Category:Carlton Football Club (AFLW) players Category:Australian rules footballers from Tasmania ",
