    "text": "Rab\u012b' al-Awwal (, ') is the third month in the Islamic calendar. The name Rab\u012b\u2018 al-awwal means \"the first [month] or beginning of spring\", referring to its position in the pre-Islamic Arabian calendar. During this month, many Muslims celebrate Mawlid - the birthday of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Although the exact date is unknown, Sunni Muslims believe the date of birth of Muhammad to have been on the twelfth of this month, whereas Shia Muslims believe him to have been born on the dawn of the seventeenth day. In the Ottoman Empire days, the name of this month in Ottoman Turkish was R\u00e8bi' ul\u00e8vv\u00e8l, with the abbreviation Ra. In modern Turkish it is Rebi\u00fclevvel. \u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647\u0647 \u062c ==Meaning== The word \"Rabi\" means \"spring\" and Al-awwal means \"the first\" in Arabic language, so \"Rabi' al-awwal\" means \"The first spring\" in Arabic language. The name seems to have to do with the celebration events in the month as \"spring\" is the end to winter (symbol of sadness) and consequently the start of happiness. The Arabic calendar being lunar calendar, the month is naturally rotating over years and Rab\u012b\u2018 al-awwal can be in spring or any other season every now and then, so the meaning can not be related to the actual season.\u064eAl-Monjed dictionary and encyclopedia - the word Rabi' al-awwal ==Celebrations== Indian Muslims with green flags for Mawlid Although historians and scholars disagree on the exact date of Muhammad's birth,What is the Authentic Date of Birth and Death of Prophet Muhammad? it is commonly celebrated on 12th or 17th of Rabi' al-awwal. The celebration of the Mawlid is done differently depending on the country. In some areas celebrations begin as early as the first of the month and can continue till the end of the month. Muslims generally put coloured lights on roads, streets, and their homes and put green flags as well to celebrate. In many countries a procession is also conducted on 12th or 17th of Rabi' al-awwal night and day. On these occasions sweets and drinks are also distributed widely from home to home and to the general public. In some areas Muslims also exchange gifts. It is the month of blessings. For the first time in 457 years, both the 12th Rabi' al-awwal and Christmas shared the same date on December 25, 2015. ==Timing== The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Rab\u012b\u2018 al-Awwal migrates throughout the seasons.
