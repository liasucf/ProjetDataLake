Chuyev states that despite the ending, OUN achieved its ultimate goals - 600 members of their organization had received military training and had battle experience and these men took positions as instructors and commanders in the structure of the newly formed Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Chuyev, Sergei Ukrainskyj Legion - Moskva, 2006 pp. 179-184 S. Bandera wrote: \"The end of OUN was such: the revolutionary columns were commanded by Roman Shukhevych with a small party of officers who had not only undergone military training, but had come to a clear understanding of military tactics. The most important, they brought with them - an understanding of organization, strategies and tactics of partisan fighting, and the German method of dealing with partisan groups. This knowledge was very useful in the formation and activities of the UIA and in its future conflicts. During its short history the Nachtigall Battalion had 39 casualties and had 40 wounded soldiers. ==Controversy== KGB document on action against Theodor Oberl\u00e4nder and Ukrainian Nachtigall (1959)..(\u0413\u0414\u0410 \u0421\u0411\u0423 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434 1, \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441 4 \u0437\u0430 1964 \u0440\u0456\u043a, \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440 3, \u0442\u043e\u043c 5, \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0448 195 \u0420\u043e\u0437\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e: 24/376 \u0432\u0456\u0434 05.02.2008 \u0440. - original sygnature of document).In accordance with your indication of the Office of the KGB under the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR in Lviv region in the period from October 1959 to April 1960 measures were taken to document and collect evidence of atrocities in the city of Lviv and the region, committed by Oberl\u00e4nder and the battalion \"Nachtigall\". In order to compromise Oberlander and Ukrainian nationalists, KGB collected materials are widely used in the local and national press, newsreel and the press-conference in Moscow. In addition, they have been identified and trained accordingly witnesses who spoke of the case at a press conference in Moscow on the court in Berlin. Given the positive results achieved in the special events on Oberlander, I ask you to award the badge \"Honorary Officer of State Security\" (name not disclosed) Declare gratitude and reward valuable gift. A Ukrainian postage stamp (2007) honouring the Ukrainian Commander of the Nachtigall Battalion - Roman Shukhevych on the 100th anniversary of his birth Accusations have placed the Battalion in Lviv in July 1941 and claimed that the unit participated in the pogrom that took place. Some members of the unit did indeed participate in the pogrom, which implicates the unit as a whole. World opinion: An international commission was set up at The Hague in the Netherlands in 1959 to carry out independent investigations. The members were four former anti-Hitler activists, Norwegian lawyer Hans Cappelen, former Danish foreign minister and president of the Danish parliament Ole Bj\u00f8rn Kraft, Dutch socialist Karel van Staal, Belgian law professor Flor Peeters, and Swiss jurist and member of parliament Kurt Scoch. Following its interrogation of a number of Ukrainian witnesses between November 1959 and March 1960, the commission concluded: \"After four months of inquiries and the evaluation of 232 statements by witnesses from all circles involved, it can be established that the accusations against the Battalion Nachtigall and against the then Lieutenant and currently Federal Minister Oberl\u00e4nder have no foundation in fact\".Alfred M. de Zayas, The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945 , University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London, 1979, pp. 214-227 The Ukrainian side states that none of the allegations have been proven by any documents, and that the Battalion's main priority was securing the radio station, newspapers and proclaiming Ukrainian independence. Canadian Investigation: Involvement of any members of the Nachtigall Battalion in the war crimes have not yet been established. The Canadian Commission on War Criminals in Canada (Desch\u00eanes Commission) that look into allegations of war criminals residing in Canada, has not named any of the members of the Nachtigall Battalion. Moreover, it concluded, that units collaborating with the Nazis should not be indicted as a group and that mere membership in such units was not sufficient to justify prosecution.Wasyl Veryha. Along the Roads of World War II. War Criminals in Canada? (Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals Report) The Simon Wiesenthal Center contends that between June 30 and July 3, 1941, in the days that the Battalion was in Lviv the Nachtigall soldiers together with the German army and the local Ukrainians participated in the killings of Jews in the city. The pretext for the pogrom was a rumor that the Jews were responsible for the execution of prisoners by the Soviets before the 1941 Soviet withdrawal from Lviv. The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust states that some 4,000 Jews were kidnapped and killed at that time.Gutman, Israel. \"Nachtigall Battalion \". Encyclopedia of the Holocaust. Macmillan Publishing Company: New York, 1990. It further states that the unit was removed from Lviv on July 7 and sent to the Eastern Front. The Polish side contends that members of the Nazi-led Nachtigall battalion also participated in the massacres of Polish professors, including the ex-Polish Prime minister Kazimierz Bartel, Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski and others, in Lw\u00f3w in 1941. See Massacre of Lviv professors. The activities of the Nachtigall Battalion continue to remain controversial. A study of the massacre in Lviv based on documents of the time was made by de Zayas in his book The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945 University of Nebraska Press, Rockport, Maine, 2000 edition.
