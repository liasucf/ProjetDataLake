    "text": "Warwick Furnace Farms is a historic district in northern Chester County, Pennsylvania that includes the ruins of an early iron furnace owned by Samuel Van Leer, the ironmaster's house and workers' houses, as well as a historic farm house and barns now used in the operation of a working farm. The furnace was a center of colonial iron making and is associated with the introduction of the Franklin Stove, and the retreat of George Washington's army following its defeat at the Battle of Brandywine. The furnace operated through the 1860s and supplied the iron used in the iron-clad ship the USS Monitor during the Civil War.M. Bennett, M. Busenkell, F.L. Edmunds, E. Morris, K. Murphy, and V.
