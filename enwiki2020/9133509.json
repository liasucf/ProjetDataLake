    "text": "This List of communities using the Tridentine Mass includes priestly societies and religious institutes which use some pre-1970 edition of the Roman Missal or of a similar missal in communion with the Holy See. In the following list, all societies are in communion with the Church. Most use a pre-1970 edition of the Roman Missal, but some follow other Latin liturgical rites and thus celebrate not the Tridentine Mass but a form of liturgy permitted under the 1570 papal bull Quo primum. The use of a pre-1970 Roman Missal has never been prohibited by the Catholic Church. Despite being suppressed by the Church post-Vatican II, its use was greatly liberalized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum issued in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI. Many of these communities describe themselves as traditionalist. ==Male religious== Exclusively Extraordinary Form Mass For religious institutes affiliated with the Society of Saint Pius X, see SSPX-affiliated religious orders.

N.B. The Abbey of Our Lady of the Annunciation of Clear Creek along with their motherhouse of Fontgombault Abbey uses the 1965 transitional mass with the modern calendar of Paul VI. Changes from the 1962 Missal include but are not limited to 1) omitting the prayers at the foot of the altar, 2) During the Liturgy of the Word, the priest is at the sedilia, 3) The reading are sung facing the people, 3) The Secret is sung, 4) The final doxology of the Canon (Per ipsum...) is sung, 5) The Pater Noster is sung by the congregation, with the priest, 6) The final blessing is sung, 7) The last Gospel is omitted, 8) Omitting the feasts of some saints whilst adding others, 9) Reducing octaves within the temporal calendar, and 10) Concelebrating for the Solemnities of Corpus Christi and Holy Thursday.
