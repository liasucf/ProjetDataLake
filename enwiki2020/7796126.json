In the Week 16 Monday night game, Brett Favre threw four touchdowns in a 41-7 win over the Oakland Raiders, one night after his father died of a heart attack. The Packers won the division on the last play of the season. Needing a win and a Minnesota Vikings loss to clinch the division, the Packers routed the Denver Broncos 31-3, while the Vikings lost 18-17 on a last second touchdown by the 3-12 Arizona Cardinals. ==Offseason== The Packers were able to add Al Harris to their starting lineup from a trade with Philadelphia. They lost starters Terry Glenn to a trade and Vonnie Holliday to free agency.Offseason Overview: Green Bay Packers, espn.com obtained 2009-03-12 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Additions || Subtractions |- |FB Nick Luchey (Bengals) || LB Nate Wayne (Eagles) |- |LB Hannibal Navies (Panthers) || S Matt Bowen (Redskins) |- |C Grey Ruegamer (Patriots) || CB Tyrone Williams (Falcons) |- |DE Chukie Nwokorie (Colts) || CB Tod McBride (Falcons) |- |OT Reggie Coleman (Bengals) || DE Vonnie Holliday (Chiefs) |- |RB Lamar Smith (Panthers) || WR Terry Glenn (Cowboys) |- |OT Marcus Spriggs (Dolphins) || LB Hardy Nickerson (retirement) |- |CB Al Harris (Eagles) || |} ===NFL Draft=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ 2003 Packers Draft Selections !

Jackson helped the Packers allow only 95.38 rushing yards per game over the final 8 games, after allowing over 117 yards per game in the first 8 games. Jackson signed a two-year contract extension on December 29, 2003. ===Favre's Monday night performance=== Lambeau Field on a game day, December 2003 The day before the Week 16 game, Irvin Favre, father of Brett Favre, died suddenly of a heart attack. Favre elected to play and passed for four touchdowns in the first half, and 399 yards in a 41\u20137 defeat of the Raiders. Afterwards, Favre said, \"I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight.\" ==Playoffs== ===vs. Seattle Seahawks=== Packers defensive back Al Harris returned an interception 52 yards for the game-winning touchdown 4:25 in overtime. The game was sent into overtime on Seahawk running back Shaun Alexander's third touchdown of the day. Ahman Green scored two touchdowns for Green Bay, and Bubba Franks caught a 23-yard touchdown in the second quarter. The game is memorable for Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck's ironic comment after winning the coin toss for the start of overtime, telling the referee \"We want the ball and we're going to score.\" http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20040104_SEA@GB This game remains one of two times in NFL history that an NFL playoff game has ended with a defensive touchdown in OT. The other being the January 10, 2010 Wild Card game between the Arizona Cardinals and the Green Bay Packers./index.php?ntid=266179 Packers quarterback Brett Favre completed 26 of 38 passes for 319 yards and a touchdown. ===vs. Philadelphia Eagles=== Ahman Green's franchise postseason record 156 rushing yards was not enough to lift the Packers to victory. Facing fourth down and 26 yards to go, with 1:12 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers leading 17\u201314, Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 28-yard pass to Freddie Mitchell on a famous play now known as \"4th and 26\". The play set up David Akers' 37-yard field goal to send the game into overtime. In the overtime Favre's deep pass was intercepted, and Akers then kicked a 31-yard field goal, giving the Eagles the victory. McNabb had a spectacular performance in the game, completing 21 of 39 passes for 248 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also rushing for 107 yards on 11 carries. ==Standings== ==Awards and honors== * Brett Favre, NFC Leader, Completion Percentage (65.4) * Brett Favre, NFC Leader, Touchdown Passes (32) ==References== ==External links== *2003 Packers results and recaps Green Bay Packers Category:Green Bay Packers seasons Category:NFC North championship seasons Green ",
