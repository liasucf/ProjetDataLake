    "text": "Pope Pius II Veram semper et solidam is a papal bull issued by Pope Pius II in 1458. Due to the increasing naval strength of the Ottoman Empire, Pius, in this bull, founded a new religious order of knights to protect the Christians in Greek waters. They were to be modelled on the Knights Hospitaller and to be called the Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem, with their headquarters on Lemnos.Ludwig Pastor, The History of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages, Volume III (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, & Co., 1894), p. 46. However, it is not known if this order ever came into existence. ==Notes== Category:15th-century papal bulls Category:Documents of Pope Pius II ",
