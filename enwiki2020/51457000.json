The story begins with a border incident that is followed by an Israeli invasion of Jordan. ==Critical reception== John Graham, writing in The Canberra Times, noted changes in the writer's style: \"The atmosphere of dramatic fiction which pervades this novel is a far cry from his earlier works, notably Children of the Sun and The Devil's Advocate. Since those admirable and essentially simple studies of the Christian conscience he has moved towards the political novel with more enthusiasm than aptitude. His simpler themes earned him his original reputation.\"\"Morris West settles into role of seer\" by John Graham, The Canberra Times, 30 March 1968, p10 The reviewer in Kirkus Reviews found the novel less than impressive: \"Easy to read, easy to forget. Written to formula, devoid of inspiration. Coated over with a shopworn eloquence which only serves to undermine the author's long-standing and convincing moral concerns.\"Kirkus Reviews - The Tower of Babel by Morris West == See also == * 1968 in Australian literature == Notes == * Dedication: In Memoriam/ Stanley L.
