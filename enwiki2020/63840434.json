    "text": "Predicted tertiary structure of TMEM81 (extracellular region only) from I-TASSER.I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) server The structure was visualized using PyMol. Transmembrane Protein 81 or TMEM81 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TMEM81 gene. TMEM81 is a poorly- characterized transmembrane protein which contains an extracellular immunoglobulin domain. ==Gene== TMEM81 is also known as HC3107, UNQ2788, KVLA2788,GeneCards entry on TMEM81 or MGC75217.GeneNames entry on TMEM81 In humans, TMEM81 is located on chromosomal band 1q32.1 between the genes CNTN2 and RBBP5 on the reverse strand.BioCyc database entry on TMEM81 The TMEM81 gene is 1332 base pairs long and encodes one transcript containing a single exon.ENSEMBL Genome Database entry on TMEM81 The predicted promoter region (GXP_180875) for TMEM81 is 1158 bp long and extends from 205,084,360 to 205,085,517 on the reverse strand. ElDorado from Genomatix ==Protein== Schematic illustration of the TMEM81 peptide The TMEM81 precursor peptide is 255 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 28.5 kDa and pI = 8.92.NextProt entry on TMEM81 The protein contains a helical transmembrane region, an extracellular immunoglobulin domain, and an N-linked glycosylation site. A disulfide bridge is predicted to form between residues Cys104 and Cys156. ===Protein composition=== Illustration of the human TMEM81 peptide created using ProtterProtter interactive protein visualization tool The mature form (signal peptide removed) of TMEM81 has a slightly increased valine and somewhat decreased methionine composition relative to average proteins.Statistical Analysis of Protein Structure TMEM81 also contains three charge runs, each of which are three amino acids long: {| class=\"wikitable\" !Charge !! Amino acids !! Location |- | align=\"middle\" | + || Arg-Arg-Lys || 71\u201373 |- | align=\"middle\" | - || Asp-Asp-Glu || 131\u2013133 |- | align=\"middle\" | + || Lys-Lys-Lys || 221\u2013223 |} ===Secondary structure=== The extracellular region of TMEM81 is predicted to be composed of beta sheets while the intracellular region likely assumes an alpha helix conformation. The transmembrane region of TMEM81 is helical. An alignment of mature TMEM81 peptide sequences in H. sapiens, M. musculus and G. gallus was used to predict the secondary structure of TMEM81 using Ali2D.Ali2D from the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit Secondary structure of TMEM81 (predicted by Ali2D) In predication results given above, blue indicates beta strands while red indicates alpha helices. Color saturation is proportional to the confidence of the predication. ===Tertiary structure=== TMEM81 predicted tertiary structure (Phyre2) The tertiary structure of TMEM81 has been predicted using izumo sperm-egg fusion protein 1 as a template. The image on the right depicts a model of residues 19 to 152 with 97.3% confidence with 56% coverage obtained using Phyre2.Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) The red-to-blue color gradation indicates the N- to C-terminus directionality of the structure. ===Post-translational modifications=== Experimental evidence has been found for an N-glycosylation site located at Asn45 indicating that TMEM81 is a glycoprotein.NCBI Nucleotide entry on TMEM81 Several tyrosine residues within TMEM81 have been predicted to undergo sulfation.ExPASy Sulfinator ===Subcellular location=== TMEM81 is predicted to be localized to the plasma membrane. However, immunohistochemistry experiments using TMEM81-specific antibodies found localization to intermediate filaments and microfilaments.
