He is mentioned in the 13th Platonic Epistle,Platonic Epistles, xiii. 360c and Theopompus even claimed in his Attack upon Plato that Plato stole many ideas for his dialogues from Bryson of Heraclea.Athenaeus, xi. ch. 118, 508c-d He is known principally from Aristotle, who criticizes his method of squaring the circle.Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, 75b4; Sophistical Refutations, 171b16, 172a3 He also upset Aristotle by asserting that obscene language does not exist.Aristotle, Rhetoric, 3.2, 1405b6-16 Diogenes La\u00ebrtiusDiogenes La\u00ebrtius, i. 16, vi. 85, ix. 61 and the SudaSuda, Pyrrhon, Krates, Theodoros refer several times to a Bryson as a teacher of various philosophers, but since some of the philosophers mentioned lived in the late 4th-century BCE, it is possible that Bryson became confused with Bryson of Achaea, who may have lived around that time.Robert Drew Hicks, Diogenes Laertius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers, page 88. Loeb Classical Library ===Pi and squaring the circle=== Bryson, along with his contemporary, Antiphon, was the first to inscribe a polygon inside a circle, find the polygon's area, double the number of sides of the polygon, and repeat the process, resulting in a lower bound approximation of the area of a circle. \"Sooner or later (they figured), ...[there would be] so many sides that the polygon ...[would] be a circle.\"Blatner, page 16 Bryson later followed the same procedure for polygons circumscribing a circle, resulting in an upper bound approximation of the area of a circle. With these calculations, Bryson was able to approximate \u03c0 and further place lower and upper bounds on \u03c0's true value. But due to the complexity of the method, he only calculated \u03c0 to a few digits. Aristotle criticized this method,Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, 75b37-76a3. but Archimedes would later use a method similar to that of Bryson and Antiphon to calculate \u03c0; however, Archimedes calculated the perimeter of a polygon instead of the area. ===Robert Kilwardby on Bryson's syllogism=== The 13th-century English philosopher Robert Kilwardby described Bryson's attempt of proving the quadrature of the circle as a sophistical syllogism\u2014one which \"deceives in virtue of the fact that it promises to yield a conclusion producing knowledge on the basis of specific considerations and concludes on the basis of common considerations that can produce only belief.\"Robert Kilwardby, De ortu scientiarum, LIII, \u00a7512, pp. 272f. His account of the syllogism is as follows: ==Notes== ==References== *Blatner, David. The Joy of Pi. Walker Publishing Company, Inc. New York, 1997. *Kilwardby, Robert. De ortu scientiarum.
