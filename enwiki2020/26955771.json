    "text": "Vineyard Vines is an American clothing and accessory retailer founded in 1998 on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, by brothers Shep and Ian Murray. The brand markets upper market ties, hats, belts, shirts, shorts, swimwear, bags for men, women, and children. It has grown to a collection of retail stores and outlets across the United States. The company's main logo is a pink whale. Their clothing is considered preppy. ==History== Shep and Ian Murray grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut and spent their summers on Martha's Vineyard, where they were introduced to the coastal lifestyle of sailing, fishing, and boating. The two brothers originally held jobs in New York City, but soon grew tired of the corporate lifestyle. Ian claims the duo \"traded in [their] business suits for bathing suits\" and \u201cstarted making neckties so [they] didn\u2019t have to wear them.\u201d Before quitting their jobs, the two brothers opened credit cards so they could buy silk and launch Vineyard Vines. The company's entire startup capital was raised from the brothers' accrued credit card debt. Shep and Ian sold their neckties on Martha's Vineyard, selling out of a backpack from their boat or Jeep rather than a storefront. Initially, they offered four different styles of ties. After they sold 800 ties on a single weekend in July, Shep and Ian quickly re-ordered more, paid off their accrued debt, and moved into a new office. The Murray brothers claim that the business was founded through a philosophy of \"living the good life,\" which is reflected by their slogan \"Every day should feel this good.\" Shep Murray claims his goal is to be \"a cross between Warren Buffett and Jimmy Buffett\" in building the \"lifestyle brand\" he founded. Vineyard Vines is still owned outright by the two Murray brothers. ==Expansion== Since the summer of 1998, the Vineyard Vines company has expanded nationally, particularly along the East Coast. Vineyard Vines has opened numerous company, outlet, and retail stores. In addition to these traditional channels, Vineyard Vines has expanded its sales to online shoppers. The company manufactures licensed NFL and MLB product, which it sells through its retail channels. Vineyard Vines also manufactures licensed college apparel, which is sold primarily through campus stores. Vineyard Vines was placed on Inc. magazine's list of the 5000 fastest-growing businesses in the U.S. in 2007. Between 2004 and 2007, the relatively new company's revenue tripled. In 2015, the company inaugurated a new headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. In January 2018, sportscaster Jim Nantz announced a partnership with Vineyard Vines to create a golf-oriented lifestyle clothing line set to launch in spring 2019.Hennessey, Stephen. \"Yes, Jim Nantz will have his own Vineyard Vines golf apparel line\", Golf Digest.com, 24 January 2018 (retrieved 8 February 2018). ==Stores== A Vineyard Vines store in Manhattan The first stores were opened in Northeastern locations associated with the sea such as Martha's Vineyard. The first was in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard, followed by Greenwich, Connecticut. The company has expanded to more than 59 stores as well as 15 outlet locations across the U.S. states. ==Legal Matters== An age and gender discrimination lawsuit was filed in mid June 2020 in federal court in Connecticut by a former senior vice president. The lawsuit also names the co-founders and co-CEO\u2019s of the privately held company. \u201cIt appears to be an environment increasingly marked by age and gender discrimination and that was by design. As the complaint states, it was coming from the founders and the president of the company.\u201d The complaint details the particulars of the firing of the company\u2019s head of stores and the company culture that she alleges led to it, including a desire by the founders to replace older, female store employees with younger men. A group of consumers filed a lawsuit on Sept. 9 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Vineyard Vines LLC. The lawsuit alleges Vineyard Vines misleads shoppers about quality, pricing of outlet products. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant's outlet and retail products, despite their similarity in appearance and classification, are misleading in pricing as the outlet products' pricing does not truly display the real suggested retail price identical to the price for the comparative product in the retail store. The plaintiffs allege the \"invented price disparity\" induces customers to purchase the outlet products and creates a feeling of savings, and increases the consumers' likelihood to purchase the product. The plaintiffs also allege consumers are led to believe that the outlet products are identical to the retail products without being informed that the products come from different manufacturing batches and are of lower quality than the true retail products. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Clothing retailers of the United States Category:Clothing brands of the United States Category:Clothing companies established in 1998 Category:Retail companies established in 1998 Category:Martha's Vineyard Category:Private equity portfolio companies Category:Companies based in Stamford, Connecticut Category:American brands Category:Lawsuits Category:Discrimination ",
