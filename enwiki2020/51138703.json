The online magazine also has freely available podcasts. ==History== The formal journal of the IChemE was the \u201cTransactions\u201d which was initially an annual publication. In order to keep members informed a \u201cQuarterly Bulletin- Institution of Chemical Engineers\u201d was issued. When the Transactions became quarterly, the Bulletin was issued as a supplement. In 1956 both changed to bi-monthly and the title was changed to \u201cThe Chemical Engineer\u201d with the sub-title \u201cBulletin of the Institution of Chemical Engineers\". According to the editorial it would contain news and \u201carticles and comments by members, handled less formally than in Transactions, relating both to practical matters arising from experience and to broader aspects of professional life.\u201dThe Chemical Engineer issue 125, June 1956 p xxxiv \u201cOur Publications\u201d From 2002 it was published as \u201cTCE\u201d but reverted to its original title with issue 894 in December 2015.The Chemical Engineer issue 894-5 December 2015 ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Science and technology magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Chemical industry in the United Kingdom Category:Chemical engineering journals Category:Magazines established in 1956 Category:Professional and trade magazines ",
