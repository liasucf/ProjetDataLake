The town of Esk is contained in the Queensland electoral district of Nanango. ==History== Jagara (also known as Jagera, Yagara, Yugarabul, Yuggera and Yuggerabul) is one of the Aboriginal languages of South-East Queensland. There is some uncertainty over the status of Jagara as a language, dialect or perhaps a group or clan within the local government boundaries of Ipswich City Council, Lockyer Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council. Esk formed part of the southern border of the Garumga clan of the Dalla tribe. The land around Esk was first explored by Captain Patrick Logan in 1830. The town was established to service the short- lived copper mines of Eskdale and Cressbrook Creek. Settlers moved into the region during the 1840s. Mount Esk Post Office opened on 1 February 1874 (a receiving office had been open from 1873) and was renamed Esk by February 1881. Mount Esk State School was opened on 1 November 1875 and was renamed Esk State School in 1887. In 1886, the Brisbane Valley railway line reached Esk from Lowood. Several sawmills were built and in 1904 a butter factory opened. The timber industry declined in the 1920s. St Agnes' Anglican Church was dedicated on Monday 28 October 1889 by Bishop William Webber. In July 1941, a Lutheran church was opened. Dairying slowed from the 1960s onwards, which has eventually led to the decline of the town's importance as a major rural centre. At the 2006 census, Esk had a population of 1,166. The Esk Library opened in 2009.
