    "text": "The white-cheeked pintail (Anas bahamensis), also known as the Bahama pintail or summer duck, is a species of dabbling duck. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae under its current scientific name. ==Distribution and habitat== It is found in the Caribbean, South America, and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It occurs on waters with some salinity, such as brackish lakes, estuaries and mangrove swamps. There are three subspecies: * A. b. bahamensis\u2014lesser Bahama pintail\u2014in the Caribbean, and a vagrant to southern Florida * A. b. rubirostris\u2014greater Bahama pintail\u2014in South America; it may be partly migratory, breeding in Argentina and wintering further north. * A. b. galapagensis\u2014Galapagos pintail\u2014in the Galapagos ==Description== Like many southern ducks, the sexes are similar. It is mainly brown with white cheeks and a red-based grey bill (young birds lack the pink). It cannot be confused with any other duck in its range. ==Behaviour== The white-cheeked pintail feeds on aquatic plants and small creatures obtained by dabbling. The nest is on the ground under vegetation and near water. ==Aviculture== It is popular in wildfowl collections, and escapees are frequently seen in a semi-wild condition in Europe. A leucistic (whitish) variant is known in aviculture as the silver Bahama pintail. ==Gallery== File:Duck pato 005eue.jpg| File:white.cheeked.pintail.750pix.jpg| File:Anas bahamensis -Santa Cruz highlands.jpg|Adult on left with red at the base of its beak and a juvenile with an all black bill on the right File:Anasbahamensisberlin.jpg File:White- cheeked Pintail white morph RWD.jpg|Whitish variant File:Two ducks in the galapagos islands - santa cruz, ecuador.JPG|Two white-cheeked pintails on the Island of Santa Cruz in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands File:White-cheeked Pintail in pond.JPG|Taken in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands ==References== == External links == * White-cheeked pintail videos, photos, and sounds on the Internet Bird Collection white-cheeked pintail Category:Birds of the Caribbean Category:Birds of Hispaniola Category:Birds of the Dominican Republic Category:Birds of Haiti Category:Birds of South America Category:Gal\u00e1pagos Islands coastal fauna white-cheeked pintail white-cheeked pintail ",
