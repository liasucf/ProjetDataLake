An algorithmic paradigm is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.p. 702p. 9 == List of paradigms == === General === *Backtracking *Branch and bound *Brute-force search *Divide and conquer *Dynamic programming *Greedy algorithm *Prune and search === Parameterized complexity === * Kernelization * Iterative compression === Computational geometry === * Sweep line algorithms * Rotating calipers * Randomized incremental construction. == References == Category:Algorithms ",
