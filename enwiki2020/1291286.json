    "text": "An alpha privative or, rarely,Ngram Viewer privative a (from Latin ', from Ancient Greek ) is the prefix a- or an- (before vowels) that is used in Greek and in words borrowed from Greek to express negation or absence, for example the English words atypical, anesthetic, and analgesic. It is derived from a Proto-Indo-European syllabic nasal *', the zero ablaut grade of the negation *', i.e. /n/ used as a vowel. For this reason, it usually appears as ' before vowels (e.g. an-alphabetism, an-esthesia, an-archy). It shares the same root with the Greek prefix ' or ', in Greek or , that is also privative (e.g. '). It is not to be confused with, among other things, an alpha copulative (e.g. ') or the prepositional component ' (i.e. the preposition ' with ekthlipsis or elision of its final vowel before a following vowel; e.g. '). ==Cognates== ===Sanskrit=== The same prefix appears in Sanskrit, also as \u0905- ' before consonants; and \u0905\u0928- ' before vowels. ===Latin=== In Latin, the cognate prefix is '. The prepositional prefix ' is unrelated. ===Germanic languages=== In English and other West Germanic languages, the cognate is un- (or on-). In North Germanic languages, the -n- has disappeared and Old Norse has ' (e.g. ), Danish and Norwegian have ', whereas Swedish uses ' (pronounced [u]), and Icelandic and Faroese use the related '. ==Homonym== The prefix ' (also - ' from psilosis), copulative a, is nearly homonymous with privative ', but originates from Proto-Indo-European *. ==See also== * Copulative a ==References== Category:Indo-European linguistics Category:Greek language ",
