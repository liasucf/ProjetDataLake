    "text": "Nanoionic supercapacitors belong to new class of nanoionic devices, i.e. devices operating due to fast ion transport at nano-scale. An example of such a device is a nanoionic switch with quantum conductance. All solid state micrometre sized supercapacitors; based on advanced superionic conductors i.e. nanoionic supercapacitors, have of late gained recognition as critical electron components of future sub-voltage and deep sub-voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies. Supercapacitors based on advanced superionic conductors were developed several decades ago, however the capacity density of their functional heterojunctions (disordered crystal structure) is 100 -10 microF/cm2 at frequencies ~0,01\u20131000 Hz. Low operation frequencies of such heterojunctions are the result of violations of fast ion transport conditions in molecular-thin double electric layer on the heterojunctions. The major approach to nanoionics of advanced superionic conductors is to retain the concentration and potential barrier heights to mobile ion jumps on functional heterojunctions at the level of those in the volume. Nanoionic supercapacitors should be devices with fast ion transport in double electric layer and record high capacity-frequency characteristics. ==References== *Banno N., Sakamoto T., Iguchi N., Kawaura H., Kaeriyama S., Mizuno M., Terabe K., Hasegawa T., Aono M.
