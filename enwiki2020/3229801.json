    "text": "Hundreds of copies of a Provisional Constitution were found among John Brown's papers after his 1859 raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia. ==Creation of the constitution== The Provisional Constitution and Ordinances for the People of the United States was written by Brown while a guest in Frederick Douglass's house in Rochester, New York, in 1858. \"He later described it as \"of my own contriving and getting up.\" This constitution was adopted at a convention Brown held in Chatham, Ontario, on May 8\u201310, 1838. Although this document was dismissed by contemporaries as evidence of Brown's madness, David Reynolds points out that at the time, the U.S. Constitution itself was \"a highly contexted text\". It was rejected by the abolitionists Wm. Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, who called it \"a covenant with death and an agreement from hell\" because it indirectly sanctioned slavery, as the Dred Scott decision had just confirmed. The first Constitution of the Confederacy was a Provisional Constitution. ==Projected use of the constitution== Just what the provisional constitution was for is not completely clear. It was not intended for use in Harpers Ferry, as it was not distributed there. We have no record of any comments by Brown on how and when it was to be distributed and used. \"John Brown never...communicated his whole plan, even to his immediate followers. ...With characteristic reticence Brown revealed his whole plan to no one, and many of those close to him received quite different impressions, or rather read their own ideas into Brown's careful speech.\" http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvmemory/images/jb/SC02-0019C.jpg It was not the constitution of a projected new state, made up of the mountanous regions of the mid-Atlantic states, that would join or seek to join the Union. He also denied, in his trial, the intent of revolting against the United States, of creating a new country. Sometimes he seems to want the same United States\u2014he does describe it in the constitution's title as \"for the people of the United States\"\u2014buf with a better and anti-slavery constitution. This proposed one was only \"provisional\", which implies some sort of procedure to create a new, permanent constitution. Under Brown's provisional constitution, there would be a unicameral legislature of no less than 5 nor more than 10 members, all chosen at large. There would be no senate. Brown did not see setting up another government with a different constitution to be a revolt against the United States. The Provisional Constitution was cited during the trial as evidence of his intent to commit treason. It called for a new state in the Appalachian Mountains, a sort of West Virginia, populated by escaped slaves from plantations, which were at lower altitudes. Not one of the copies was ever distributed; even nearby enslaved persons did not receive copies. The reason for this has never been explained. Although it was reprinted, always with scorn, in the press, Brown was not asked about it by any of the many visitors he saw during the month (November 2\u2013December 2, 1859) between being sentenced to death (in Virginia v. John Brown) and his execution. Much of the Constitution was reprinted in the Wheeling Daily Intelligencer shortly after his arrest. In the pockets of William H. Leeman, one of the rebels killed at Harpers Ferry, was found a commission as captain \"in the army established under the provisional constitution\". It was signed by John Brown, Commander in Chief, at the \"War Department, near Harpers Ferry\", dated October 15. The commission was a preprinted form, with Lehman's name filled in by hand. ==References== ==External links== * John Brown's Provisional Constitution - Full Text Category:John Brown (abolitionist) Category:Provisional constitutions Category:1858 documents ",
