She uses Pro Tools, Logic, Ableton and various analog synthesizers to produce. Fusion, who added Jones to their The best 25 songs of 2016 list wrote, \"Simonne uses her background in scientific theory to write electro-pop songs that lyrically reference complex concepts like relativity and gravity while sounding both otherworldly and like a hymn you\u2019ve always known.\" Lena Dunham's newsletter Lenny Letter described, \"Jones, who is a lover of science and a former biomedical researcher, cites her interest in concepts like the theory of relativity and other natural phenomena in her music as being fueled by her fascination with the \"unknown mysteries of the universe.\" Jones describes a production technique in Popular Science, \"In Spooky Action I used sounds from a UK researcher who translates star pulses into audio waves to better understand them [...] I created a sound library where I can play the stars on a keyboard.\" The music production software company Native Instruments released a Simonne Jones drum kit in the virtual instrument plug-in called Battery of sounds specific to her production style. Her style has been compared by industry critics and fans to PJ Harvey, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, and Depeche Mode. ==Discography== ===Singles=== ====As a lead artist==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
