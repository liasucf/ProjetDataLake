    "text": "Arrupe College, El Salvador, was founded by a Jesuit in 1997 in a high- density, low-income area near the El Salvador capital city, San Salvador. It was built and remains largely supported by charitable contributions. It includes infant through baccalaureate and vocational, and has ranked at the top on national exams. == History == The school is situated in Soyapango. In 1997 Juan Ricardo Salazar-Simpson founded the school on his own initiative. He hoped that the Jesuits would take over the school, but he died two years after its founding and Jos\u00e9 Panad\u00e9s, a businessman and friend, took over for him. The school was adopted by the Salazar-Simpson family who sponsored the \"Padre Arrupe Foundation\". In 2000 the Spanish baccalaureate was introduced. In 2001 the middle school (ages 10\u201312) was added to compensate for the students' educational deficiency. The school has since expanded to all educational levels including two technical cycles similar to the Spanish FP, and enrolls more than 1500 children between the ages of 3 and 18 years. ==Recognition== In 2015, Padre Arrupe Spanish School was placed first nationally in the government's Learning and Skills Test for Graduates of Middle Education (PAES) 2015. ==References== Category:Jesuit secondary schools Category:Roman Catholic schools in Central America Category:Educational institutions established in 1997 ",
