After the 2003 invasion of Iraq he remained in Russia with his family. He died in 2013. ==Quotes== * \"Many people like to say that he oppressed Shi'ites. I'm a Shi'ite, not from his city, not from his clan. When I hear such things I can say from my own experience that it's an exaggeration.\" * \"He was just in his injustice to everyone. I mean, if there was any opposition, Shi'ite or Sunni, he crushed it. For him, it didn't matter, Shi'ite, Sunni, Kurd, Arab. If they raised their heads, he put them in their place.\" According to https://web.archive.org/web/20090830124804/http://ustreas.gov/press/releases/js1821.htm The U.S. Government has identified Abbas Khalaf Kunfuth (Kunfuth) as the former Iraqi Ambassador to Russia and a senior official of the former Iraqi regime, as described in Executive Order 13315 and in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483. Information available to the U.S. Government indicates that Kunfuth may have used his senior position to embezzle funds of the former regime. ==References== ==External links== * Saddam's ex-translator recalls chilling prediction * Iraqi Ambassador to Russia, Abbas Khalaf Kunfud Proud of His Nation * Iraqi Ambassador to stay in Moscow as long as possible * Category:2013 deaths Category:Iraqi diplomats Category:Iraqi translators Category:Ambassadors of Iraq to Russia Category:Russian\u2013Arabic translators Category:Year of birth missing ",
