The Committee expects that such lapses, as admitted by him, > shall not recur ==References== ==External links== * The Washington Diplomat Newspaper - Ambassador profile * Profile on website of Indian embassy * Ronen Sen lobbying for Dow Chemicals Category:Indian diplomats Category:Ambassadors of India to the United States Category:Ambassadors of India to Russia Category:Ambassadors of India to Mexico Category:Ambassadors of India to Germany Category:High Commissioners of India to the United Kingdom Category:1944 births Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Living people Category:Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in civil service ",
