Positions are indicated in travel distance from Bern in [km].R\u00f6ll, V. Freiherr von: Enzyklop\u00e4die des Eisenbahnwesens, Band 2. Berlin, Wien 1912, p. 256 on www.zeno.org/Roell-1912 The L\u00f6tschberg Tunnel is a long railway tunnel on the L\u00f6tschberg Line, which connects Spiez and Brig at the northern end of the Simplon Tunnel cutting through the Bernese Alps of Switzerland. Its ends are at the towns of Kandersteg (2 km away) in the canton of Berne and Goppenstein in the canton of Valais. The top elevation of the tunnel is above sea level, this is the highest point of the main Swiss railway network. Construction began in 1907 and suffered delays by several severe accidents. * February 1908: An avalanche destroyed a hotel that the workers lived in, killing 13. * July 1908: The tunnel broke into a deep fissure below the Gasterntal valley and flooded with water and glacial deposit from the fissure, killing 25, and 1554 meters (5100 feet, 0.9656 mile) of the tunnel had to be abandoned and sealed off and replaced by a curved bypass. * March 1911: Breakthrough was achieved * 3 June 1913: Finalization * 15 July 1913: Regular service through the L\u00f6tschberg Tunnel began in 1913. The tunnel is a single bore twin track. The BLS AG company offers a car transport service through the tunnel, between Kandersteg station and Goppenstein station, for accompanied vehicles. The journey time of approximately 20 minutes, passengers remain in their cars in open sided car transport vehicles. At peak times, the car transport service operates in each direction every 7\u00bd minutes. The new L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel, opened on June 15, 2007, has been constructed some below the level of the current L\u00f6tschberg Tunnel as part of the NRLA (New Railway Link through the Alps) project. {| |- | North portal south of Kandersteg (1200 m a.s.l.) | South portal from Goppenstein (1216 m a.s.l.) | Car transport through the L\u00f6tschberg tunnel (Kandersteg) |} == See also == *L\u00f6tschberg *L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel *Simplon Tunnel *NRLA == References == ==Further reading== * Baumgartner, B., and M.
