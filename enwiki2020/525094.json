Born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin, Schneider moved to New York City with the staff of The Onion in 2001. Her contributions include writing humor columns as a variety of characters: T. Herman Zweibel, Jean Teasdale and Herbert Kornfeld. Schneider's comic strip, Pathetic Geek Stories, illustrates tales of pain and humiliation, usually during adolescence, sent to her by readers. In 2004, Pathetic Geek Stories formally ceased to be a feature in The Onion, moving to its own website. As of September 2013, the site had not been updated since November 2008. ==Books== In 2010, The Onion Presents A Book of Jean's Own!, a book- length collection of new material written by Schneider as Jean Teasdale, was published by St. Martin's Griffin.
