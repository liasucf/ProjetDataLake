    "text": "Caciques de Humacao is a professional basketball team that is based in Humacao, Puerto Rico. The club competed in the National Superior Basketball (, BSN). ==History== The team was founded in 2005, when the now extinct Toritos de Cayey franchise was relocated as the Grises de Humacao. In 2010, Antonio \"Tonin\" Casillas, the team owner decided to give the franchise a makeover and changed the name to Caciques de Humacao. The main reason was to reflect a more positive image on a city which has always been known as the \"gray\" city. The change also shifted the public opinion on to the Taino heritage of the city and honors the great chieftain Jumacao who fought a rebellion against the Spanish over 500 years ago. In 2017, the team was relocated in the middle of the season to Isabela and became Gallitos de Isabela after the owner of the Caciques, Daniel Maes, was banned from the league. In 2018 owner Rafael Rivera moved his team \"Brujos de Guayama\" to the town and changed the name of the team to Caciques de Humacao, thus reviving the franchise. ==Arena== The Caciques' homecourt is the new Humacao Arena. ==Players== ===Current roster=== ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:BSN teams ",
