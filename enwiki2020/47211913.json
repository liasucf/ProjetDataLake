Mathematical Biology: an introduction. third edition. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics. Mathematical Biology. Spring: 2002. It was first presented by Anderson Gray McKendrick in 1926 as a deterministic limit of lattice models applied to epidemiology, and subsequently independently in 1959 by biophysics professor Heinz von Foerster for describing cell cycles. ==Mathematical formula== The mathematical formula can be derived from first principles. It reads: :\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} = - m(a)n where the population density n(t,a) is a function of age a and time t, and m(a) is the death function. When m(a) = 0, we have: :\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} It relates that a population ages, and that fact is the only one that influences change in population density; the negative sign shows that time flows in just one direction, that there is no birth and the population is going to die out. === Derivation === Suppose that for a change in time dt and change in age da, the population density is:n(t+dt,a + da) = [1-m(a)dt]n(t,a)That is, during a time period dt the population density decreases by a percentage m(a)dt. Taking a Taylor series expansion to order dt gives us that:n(t+dt,a + da) \\approx n(t,a) + {\\partial n\\over{\\partial t}}dt + {\\partial n\\over{\\partial a}}daWe know that da/dt = 1, since the change of age with time is 1. Therefore, after collecting terms, we must have that:{\\partial n\\over{\\partial t}} + {\\partial n\\over{\\partial a}} = -m(a)n ==Analytical solution== The von Foerster equation is a transport equation; it can be solved using a characteristics method. Another way is by similarity solution; and a third is a numerical approach such as finite differences. To get the solution, the following boundary conditions should be added: : n(t,0)= \\int_0^\\infty b (a)n(t,a) \\, da which states that the initial births should be conserved (see Sharpe\u2013Lotka\u2013McKendrick\u2019s equation for otherwise), and that: : n(0,a)= f(a) which states that the initial population must be given; then it will evolve according to the partial differential equation. ==Similar equations== In Sebastian Ani\u0163a, Viorel Arn\u0103utu, Vincenzo Capasso. An Introduction to Optimal Control Problems in Life Sciences and Economics (Birkh\u00e4user. 2011), this equation appears as a special case of the Sharpe\u2013Lotka\u2013McKendrick\u2019s equation; in the latter there is inflow, and the math is based on directional derivative. The McKendrick\u2019s equation appears extensively in the context of cell biology as a good approach to model the eukaryotic cell cycle . ==See also== *Finite difference method *Partial differential equation *Renewal theory * Transport equation *Volterra integral equation ==References== Category:Diffusion Category:Parabolic partial differential equations Category:Stochastic differential equations Category:Transport phenomena Category:Equations of physics Category:Mathematical and theoretical biology Category:Ecology ",
