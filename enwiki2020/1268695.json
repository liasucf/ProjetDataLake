(Star Apple).\" Journal of agricultural and food chemistry 2002 50:6 (1379-1382)Einbond L.S., Reynertson K.A., Luo X.-D., Basile M.J., Kennelly E.J.,\"Anthocyanin antioxidants from edible fruits\" Food Chemistry 2004 84:1 (23-28) The bark is considered a tonic and stimulant, and a bark decoction is used as an antitussive.

The purple fruit has a denser skin and texture while the greenish brown fruit has a thin skin and a more liquid pulp; the yellow variety is less common and difficult to find.
