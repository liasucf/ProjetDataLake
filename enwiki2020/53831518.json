The gods and immortals are in hiding or oppressed by demons as well. A scholar secretly concocts a plan to bring together a few warriors and a monk, named Tripitaka, to undertake a quest to resurrect the Monkey King and find the Heavenly scrolls that were stolen by Monkey 500 years ago and hidden away secretly on earth. Anyone who finds the scrolls would gain unlimited power. However, the night the group is about to start on their quest, a demon attacks the scholar's home and kills everyone inside except for the scholar's adopted daughter. In his last moments, the scholar entrusts his daughter with the quest. She takes on the identity of Tripitaka and ventures out into the world, narrowly escaping death herself. In a town she gives charity to a monk and ends up forced to work for a tavern owner, thus gaining a job and a room to sleep in. When the same demon that killed her adoptive father shows up, she secretly steals the magical crown and makes a run for it. When demons begin searching the town for her and the magic crown, she is disguised as a monk by the same monk she helped and successfully makes her way out of the city. In an opening along the side of a mountain, she finds the stony visage of the Monkey King's face, and puts the crown on his head. Finally, the Monkey King is free but he soon discovers that the crown is repressing most of his godly abilities. The pair return to the town and join up with Pigsy and Sandy, who are also gods, and the four of them begin their quest of finding the lost scrolls and gaining enough power to overthrow all the demons. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Chai Hansen as Monkey (Son Gok\u016b / \u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a) * Luciane Buchanan as Tripitaka (Sanz\u014dh\u014dshi / \u4e09\u8535\u6cd5\u5e2b) * Josh Thomson as Pigsy (Cho Hakkai / \u732a\u516b\u6212) * Emilie Cocquerel as Sandy (Sa Gojo / \u6c99\u609f\u6d44) ===Recurring=== * Jarred Blakiston as Font Demon (season 1) * Josh McKenzie as Davari (season 1) * Jordan Mooney as Raxion (season 1) * Rachel House as Monica (season 1-2) * Daniel Watterson as Shaman (season 1) * Bryony Skillington as Princess Locke (season 1) * JJ Fong as Lusio (season 1) * Jayden Daniels as Gaxin (season 1-2) * Chelsie Preston Crayford as Gwen (season 1) * Atticus Iti as Kaedo Zef (season 2) * Michelle Ang as Lord Khan (season 2) ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2018)=== ===Season 2 (2020)=== ==Broadcast== The first three episodes debuted in Australia on 28 January as a single 90-minute telemovie.
