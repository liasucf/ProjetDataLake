    "text": "Stylocheilus striatus is a species of sea hare with a circumtropical distribution living from the intertidal zone to a depth of 30 metres. Mature animals can reach sizes up to 65 mm and are brown in colour with blue spots. Their diet mainly consists of blue algae. They play an important role in controlling toxic blooms of the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula numbers. Recent work has shown that the survival of both eggs and veligers can be negatively impacted by anthropogenic noise pollution, but the developmental rate of eggs is not. == References == Category:Anaspidea Category:Gastropods described in 1832 ",
