    "text": "The City of Newcastle is a local government area in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. The City of Newcastle incorporates much of the area of the Newcastle metropolitan area. The Lord Mayor of City of Newcastle Council is Councillor Nuatali Nelmes, a Labor politician. Nelmes was elected at a by- election on 15 November 2014 following the resignation of Jeff McCloy, the former Lord Mayor. The Awabakal and Worimi peoples are acknowledged by Council as the traditional custodians of the land and waters of Newcastle. ==History== Following the passing of the Municipalities Act 1858 by the New South Wales parliament, the Municipality of Newcastle was proclaimed on 7 June 1859. The new Municipality was divided into three wards - City, Macquarie, and Honeysuckle. Eight years later, the Municipalities Act 1867 classified the Newcastle Municipality as a \"Borough\". The Greater Newcastle Act 1937 merged the City of Newcastle with 10 of its suburban municipalities to form the City of Greater Newcastle. The Act also transferred parts of the Lake Macquarie Shire and Tarro Shire to the new city. The amalgamations and transfers took effect from 2 April 1938. The newly created City of Greater Newcastle was subsequently renamed to City of Newcastle on 23 March 1949. {| class=\"wikitable\" | rowspan=2|Municipality | rowspan=2|Date established | colspan=4|PopulationDocherty, p. 299 |- |1891 |1901 |1911 |1921 |- |Adamstown |31 December 1885 |2,030 |2,420 |2,660 |3,959 |- |Carrington |28 March 1887 |2,137 |2,547 |2,685 |3,115 |- |Hamilton |11 December 1871 |4,844 |6,124 |7,908 |14,196 |- |Lambton |26 June 1871 |3,436 |3,159 |2,796 |3,691 |- |Merewether |20 August 1885 |4,399 |4,547 |4,151 |5,908 |- |New Lambton |1 August 1889 |1,548 |1,578 |1,827 |3,550 |- |Stockton |12 October 1889 |2,417 |2,549 |2,106 |4,598 |- |Wallsend |27 February 1874 |6,945 |6,997 |6,007 |6,446 |- |Waratah |23 February 1871 |2,718 |3,080 |4,419 |12,192 |- |Wickham |25 February 1871 |6,582 |7,752 |8,434 |12,151 |} ==Proposed amalgamation== After a 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal found that Newcastle City Council was not \"fit for the future\", it was recommended that the City of Newcastle merge with Lake Macquarie City Council.

The outcome of an independent review was completed by mid\u20132016. On 14 February 2017, the NSW Government announced it would not be proceeding with further regional council mergers, including the Newcastle City Council and Port Stephens Council merger. ==Demographics== At the 2016 census, there were people in the City of Newcastle local government area, of these 49.3 per cent were male and 50.7 per cent were female.
