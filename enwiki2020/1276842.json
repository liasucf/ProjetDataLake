    "text": "French personal pronouns (analogous to English I, you, he/she, we, and they) reflect the person and number of their referent, and in the case of the third person, its gender as well (much like the English distinction between him and her, except that French draws this distinction among inanimate nouns as well). They also reflect the role they play in their clause: subject, direct object, indirect object, or other. Personal pronouns display a number of grammatical particularities and complications not found in their English counterparts: some of them can only be used in certain circumstances; some of them change form depending on surrounding words; and their placement is largely unrelated to the placement of the nouns they replace. ==Overview== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+French Personal Pronouns |- style=\"background- color: rgb(255,216,153)\" ! colspan=\"2\" | || colspan=\"6\" | Function |- !

See Elision (French). # The pronoun il and its forms refer to males (like English \"he\"), while the pronoun elle and its forms refer to females (like English \"she\"). However, as all French nouns (even inanimate and intangible objects) are either grammatically masculine or feminine, these pronouns can also refer to masculine and feminine nouns. In this case, both il and elle translate to the English pronoun \"it\". Il can furthermore be used as the direct equivalent of English \"it\" in order to refer to unspecified neuter things such as facts and ideas (e.g. Il pleut \u2013 \"It's raining\"). # In formal French, the pronoun on is often replaced by l'on after a vowel (in particular after et, ou, qui, que, quoi and si); in particular, formal French often replaces si on and qu'on with si l'on and que l'on, respectively. This does not affect the meaning, only the pronunciation. In modern French, on has replaced nous as pronoun for the plural first person. Nous is used in formal usage. # In French, a group containing at least one male or one masculine noun is considered masculine, and takes the pronoun ils. Only exclusively female or feminine groups take elles. # Broadly speaking, lui and leur are used to refer to people, and y (see below) is used to refer to things. Lui and leur, however, will sometimes also be used to refer to things. ===The second person=== French has a T-V distinction in the second person singular. That is, it uses two different sets of pronouns: tu and vous and their various forms. The pronoun tu is informal and singular, spoken to an individual who is equal or junior to the speaker. The pronoun vous is used in the singular (but with second-person plural verb forms) to speak to an individual who is senior to the speaker or socially \"more important\" than the speaker. Vous is also used in the plural for all groups of people, whether junior, equal or senior. ==Subject pronouns== As noted above, the personal pronouns change form to reflect the role they play in their clause. The forms used for subjects are called the subject pronouns, subjective pronouns, or nominative pronouns. They are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2 | !! singular !! plural |- ! colspan=2 | first person | je || nous |- ! rowspan=2 | second person !! informal | tu || rowspan=2 | vous |- ! formal | vous |- ! rowspan=2 | third person !! masculine | il || ils |- ! feminine | elle || elles |} When the predicate is \u00eatre (\"to be\") plus a noun phrase, the pronoun ce (c' in elision contexts) is normally used instead of the other third person subject pronouns. For example, \u00ab C'est un homme intelligent \u00bb (\"He is a smart man\"), \u00ab Ce sont mes parents \u00bb (\"Those are my parents\"). Ce is primarily used as a \"neuter\" pronoun to refer to events and situations: \u00ab J'ai vu Jean hier. C'\u00e9tait amusant. \u00bb, \"I saw John yesterday. It was fun.\" ===On=== The subject pronoun on (from Old French [h]om, homme \"man\", from Latin homo \"human being\") is equivalent to the English indefinite pronouns one, you, and they (as in, \"One is pleased to see...\", \"You never know what will...\", and \"They speak French in...\"). It takes third-person singular verb forms in the same way that il and elle do, and is used: * In the same way as English \"one\", \"you\" and \"they\", where the subject is generalised or otherwise unclear or unimportant: : \u00ab C'est en forgeant que l'on devient forgeron. \u00bb \"It is by blacksmithing that one becomes a blacksmith.\" : \u00ab penser que l'on a raison \u00bb \"to think that you are right,\" i.e. \"to think oneself right.\" * As an extension of the above, it is often used to avoid the passive voice in French: : \u00ab On me l'a donn\u00e9. \u00bb \"[Someone] gave it to me.\" In English, it would be more common to say, \"It was given to me.\", which would be rendered as \u00ab \u00c7a / il / elle m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9(e). \u00bb in French. * To replace the subject pronoun nous in informal speech. In this case, on takes plural adjectives, even though it always takes a third-person singular verb. The corresponding reflexive object pronoun, se, is also third-person, but first-person possessive pronouns must be used when on meaning nous is the antecedent. The associated disjunctive pronoun in this context is nous. : \u00ab On est sur le point de partir. \u00bb \"We are about to go.\" : \u00ab Nous, on est am\u00e9ricains, et vous, vous \u00eates fran\u00e7ais. \u00bb \"We, we are American, and you, you are French.\" : \u00ab On se d\u00e9barrasse de nos bagages ? \u00bb \"Shall we get rid of our luggage?\" {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+Colloquial replacement of nous by on |- style=\"background- color: rgb(255,216,153)\" ! colspan=\"3\" | || colspan=\"6\" | Function |- ! Number !! colspan=\"2\" | Person !! Subject !! Reflexive !! Direct object !! Indirect object !! Disjunctive |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Plural ! rowspan=\"2\" | 1st !! formal | colspan=\"5\" | nous |- ! informal | on || se || colspan=\"5\" | nous |- |} It is never used for the number one, or as in one of them. As in English, numbers can be used as pronouns, and this is also true of the French word un(e): : \u00ab Deux sont entr\u00e9s et un est ressorti \u00bb \"Two went in and one came back out.\" On has limited pronoun forms: it has only a reflexive form, se, and a disjunctive form soi (which is also only used when the sense is reflexive). The pronoun quelqu'un (\"someone\") can sometimes be used to fill the roles of on: : \u00ab Quelqu'un m'a dit... \u00bb \"Someone told me...\" ==Direct-object pronouns== Like the English him, her, it, and them, the pronouns le, la, and les are only used with definite direct objects. For indefinite ones (e.g., \"some juice\"), en is used; see \"The pronoun en\" below. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2 | !! singular !! plural |- ! colspan=2 | first person | me || nous |- ! rowspan=2 | second person !! informal | te || rowspan=2 | vous |- ! formal | vous |- ! rowspan=2 | third person !! masculine | le || rowspan=2 | les |- ! feminine | la |} Le, la, and les are not used when the direct object refers to the same entity as the subject; see the section on the reflexive pronouns, below. Examples: * (I have a book.) I am giving it to the teacher. \u00ab Je le donne au prof. \u00bb * (Danielle is my sister.) Have you seen her? \u00ab Est-ce que tu l'as vue ? \u00bb ==Indirect-object pronouns== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2 | !! singular !! plural |- ! colspan=2 | first person | me || nous |- ! rowspan=2 | second person !! informal | te || rowspan=2 | vous |- ! formal | vous |- ! colspan=2 | third person | lui || leur |} In French, an indirect object is an object of a verb that is introduced using a preposition (especially the preposition \u00e0). For example, in the sentence \u00ab J'ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Jean \u00bb (\"I spoke to Jean\"), Jean is the indirect object in the French sentence. Indirect-object pronouns (or dative pronouns) generally only replace indirect objects with the preposition \u00e0. When an indirect object pronoun is used, it replaces the entire prepositional phrase; for example, \u00ab Je lui ai donn\u00e9 un livre \u00bb (\"I gave him a book\"). Broadly speaking, lui and leur are used to refer to people, and y (see \"The pronoun y\" below) is used to refer to things. However, lui and leur will sometimes also be used in referring to things. Lui, leur, and y are replaced with se (s' before a vowel) when the indirect object refers to the same entity as the subject; see the section on the reflexive pronouns below. As mentioned above, the indirect object pronouns are not always used to replace indirect objects: * They are not used when the preposition is de rather than \u00e0; but see the section on the pronoun en, below. * Some verbs are incompatible with indirect object pronouns, such as penser (\"to think about\") and all reflexive verbs. For example, one says, \u00ab Je me fie \u00e0 lui \u00bb (\"I put my trust in him\"), not \u00ab * Je me lui fie \u00bb. ==Reflexive pronouns== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2 | !! singular !! plural |- ! colspan=2 | first person | me || nous |- ! rowspan=2 | second person !! informal | te || rowspan=2 | vous |- ! formal | vous |- ! colspan=2 | third person | colspan=2 | se |} In French, as in English, reflexive pronouns are used in place of direct- and indirect- object pronouns that refer to the same entity or entities as the subject. A verb with a reflexive pronoun is called a reflexive verb, and has many grammatical particularities aside from the choice of pronoun; see French verbs. There are four kinds of reflexive verbs: # Verbs that are inherently reflexive. For example, the verb se souvenir (\"to remember\") has no non- reflexive counterpart; the verb souvenir has no meaning on its own. # Verbs whose direct or indirect objects refer to the same entities as their subjects. For example, \u00ab Je m'ach\u00e8terai cela \u00bb (\"I shall buy myself that\") is just a special case of \u00ab Je lui ach\u00e8terai cela \u00bb (\"I shall buy him that\") that happens to be reflexive. # Verbs indicating reciprocal actions. For example, \u00ab Ils se parlent \u00bb means \"They are talking to each other.\" In cases of possible ambiguity, the reciprocal interpretation can be reinforced by adding \u00ab Ils se parlent l'un \u00e0 l'autre \u00bb. # Verbs indicating a passive action. For example, one might say, \u00ab La porte s'ouvre \u00bb, which literally means, \"The door is opening itself,\" but really means, \"The door is opening.\" All four kinds use the reflexive pronouns, and exhibit the grammatical particularities of reflexive verbs. ==Disjunctive pronouns== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2 | !! singular !! plural |- ! colspan=2 | first person | moi || nous |- ! rowspan=2 | second person !! informal | toi || rowspan=2 | vous |- ! formal | vous |- ! rowspan=2 | third person !! masculine | lui || eux |- ! feminine | elle || elles |} Disjunctive pronouns are the strong forms of French pronouns, the forms used in isolation and in emphatic positions (compare the use of me in the English sentence \"Me, I believe you, but I am not sure anyone else will\"; for more, see Intensive pronoun). In French, disjunctive pronouns are used in the following circumstances: * as the objects of prepositions: \u00ab Je le fais pour toi \u00bb, \"I am doing it for you.\" * in dislocated positions: \u00ab Toi, je t'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, moi. \u00bb, \"You, I have seen you before, I have.\" * in cleft sentences: \u00ab C'est toi qui as tort \u00bb, \"It is you who are wrong.\" lit. \"It is you who have error/wrong.\" * in compound noun phrases: \u00ab Lui et moi sommes am\u00e9ricains \u00bb, \"He and I are American\" (though one might equally say, \u00ab Lui et moi, nous sommes am\u00e9ricains / on est am\u00e9ricains \u00bb). * they are used as emphatic subjects (3rd person only): \u00ab Lui sait le faire \u00bb, \"He knows how to do it\" (though one might equally say, \u00ab Lui, il sait le faire \u00bb). The reflexive disjunctive form soi can be used as the object of a preposition, if it refers to the same entity as the subject. For example, \u00ab Un voyageur sait se sentir chez soi n'importe o\u00f9 \u00bb, \"A traveller knows how to feel at home anywhere.\" Note that this does not make the verb reflexive. ==The pronoun y== The pronoun y has two distinct uses: * It is the indirect-object pronoun used with things introduced by the preposition \u00e0. For more on this use, see above. * It is used to replace a spatial prepositional phrase. In this sense, it might be translated as there. For example: *: \u00ab Je vais \u00e0 Paris. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'y vais. \u00bb (\"I am going to Paris.\" \u2192 \"I am going there.\") *: \u00ab Est-ce que tu travailles dans ce bureau ? \u2014 Non, je n'y travaille plus. \u00bb (\"Do you work in that office? \u2014 No, I do not work there anymore.\") * It is used idiomatically with certain verbs, without replacing anything: *: \u00ab Il doit y avoir une erreur. \u00bb (\"There must be a mistake.\") *: \u00ab Je commence \u00e0 y voir un peu plus clair. \u00bb (\"I am starting to see things more clearly.\") ==The pronoun en== The pronoun en has the following uses: *It is the indirect-object pronoun used with things (including infinitives) introduced by the preposition de. It is also sometimes used in the same way with people (however, it is more common to use disjunctive pronouns rather than using en in the case of people).: *:\u00ab Je parle du probl\u00e8me. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en parle. \u00bb (\"I am talking about the problem.\" \u2192 \"I am talking about it.\") *:\u00ab Je parle de Jean. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en parle. \u00bb or \u00ab Je parle de lui. \u00bb (\"I am talking about Jean.\" \u2192 \"I am talking about him.\") *It is used to replace a spatial prepositional phrase introduced by de (\"from\"). In this sense, it might be translated as from there: *:\u00ab Je viens de France. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en viens. \u00bb (\"I come from France.\" \u2192 \"I come from there.\") *It is the direct-object pronoun used to replace indefinite direct objects; that is, direct objects that are: **introduced by the partitive article (including the plural indefinite article) **:\u00ab J'ai bu du jus de pomme. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en ai bu. \u00bb (\"I drank some apple juice.\" \u2192 \"I drank some.\") **introduced by de when the verb is negated **:\u00ab Je n'ai pas vu de vaches. \u00bb \u2192 Je n'en ai pas vu. (\"I did not see any cows.\" \u2192 \"I did not see any.\") **introduced by a numeral (including the singular indefinite article) or a plural expression (d'autres, certains, quelques) **:\u00ab J'ai mang\u00e9 une pomme. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en ai mang\u00e9 une. \u00bb (\"I ate an apple.\" \u2192 \"I ate one.\") **:\u00ab J'ai mang\u00e9 quelques pommes. \u00bb \u2192 J'en ai mang\u00e9 quelques-unes. (\"I ate a number of apples.\" \u2192 \"I ate a number of them.\") **introduced by another expression of quantity (usually an adverb + de) **:\u00ab J'ai vendu beaucoup de jus de pomme. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en ai vendu beaucoup. \u00bb (\"I sold a lot of apple juice.\" \u2192 \"I sold a lot.\") **:\u00ab J'ai achet\u00e9 trois kilogrammes de pommes. \u00bb \u2192 \u00ab J'en ai achet\u00e9 trois kilogrammes. \u00bb (\"I bought three kilograms of apples.\" \u2192 \"I bought three kilograms.\") *It is used idiomatically with certain verbs, without replacing anything: *:\u00ab J'en veux \u00e0 Jean. \u00bb (\"I am mad at Jean.\") *:\u00ab Je vais en finir avec lui. \u00bb (\"I am going to finish things off with him.\") ==Clitic order== French personal pronouns, aside from their disjunctive forms, are all clitics, and the order of pronominal clitics as well as the negative clitic ne is strictly determined as follows. Only one clitic can be used for each slot. Where one wishes to express an idea that would involve slots that cannot coexist or multiple pronouns from the same slot, the indirect object is expressed as the object of \u00e0 or pour (thus Je me donne \u00e0 toi \u2013 \"I give myself to you\"). The use of more than two clitics beyond the subject and, where necessary, ne is uncommon; constructions such as Je lui y en ai donn\u00e9 may be perceived as unacceptable, and other constructions must then be used to express the same ideas. ;Proclitic order: Slots 3 and 5 cannot coexist. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"3\" | Number ! rowspan=\"3\" | Person ! colspan=\"7\" | Slot |- | 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 |- | Nom || Neg || Obj || || || Loc || Gen |- ! rowspan=\"5\" | Singular ! 1st | je || rowspan=\"9\" | ne || me | rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | |- ! 2nd | tu || te |- ! rowspan=\"3\" | 3rd | il || rowspan=\"3\" | se || le | rowspan=\"3\" | lui || rowspan=\"2\" | y || rowspan=\"2\" | en |- | elle || la |- | on || le/la | rowspan=\"3\" | || rowspan=\"3\" | |- ! rowspan=\"4\" | Plural ! 1st | nous || nous || rowspan=\"2\" | |- ! 2nd | vous || vous |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | 3rd | ils || rowspan=\"2\" | se || rowspan=\"2\" | les || rowspan=\"2\" | leur || rowspan=\"2\" | y || rowspan=\"2\" | en |- | elles |- |} ;Enclitic order: Used only for positive imperatives. Slots 2 and 3 cannot coexist. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"3\" | Number ! rowspan=\"3\" | Person ! colspan=\"7\" | Slot |- | 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 |- | || || Obj || Loc || Gen |- ! rowspan=\"4\" | Singular ! 1st | rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | || -moi1 || rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | |- ! 2nd | -toi1 |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | 3rd | -le || rowspan=\"2\" | -lui || rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | (-z)-y1 || rowspan=\"2\" | (-z)-en1 |- | -la |- ! rowspan=\"3\" | Plural ! 1st | rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | || -nous || rowspan=\"2\" | || rowspan=\"2\" | |- ! 2nd | -vous |- ! 3rd | -les || -leur || || (-z)-y1 || (-z)-en1 |} # The clitics -moi and -toi become -m' and -t' respectively when followed by either -en or -y. In colloquial French, however, it is possible to keep -moi and -toi intact and change -en and -y to -z-en and -z-y respectively, or to put slot 5 before slot 3, or less commonly, before slot 1 or 2. #:ex.
