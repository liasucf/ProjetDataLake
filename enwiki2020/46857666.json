He is considered the first white settler in what is now Worcester, Massachusetts. As such, he became intimate in the customs of local Native Americans and was able to interact with them. However, when King Philip's War broke out in 1675, he was forced to leave the area. He was soon commissioned as a lieutenant. Woods, Henry Ernest. (1907). The Family of Henry Curtis.
