As a young man he studied to become a baker. Penava was in love with the craft of baking, but was never attracted to getting up early and working in high temperature kitchens. His passion for music was stronger. After serving his military service in Sombor in 1939, Penava composed his first songs: \"Sa prozora\" (From the Window) and \"U ba\u0161tici, kraj bijele ru\u017eice\" (In a Small Garden, by the White Roses). He enrolled in a music school where he gained musical knowledge. Penava was one of the founders of Radio Sarajevo in April 1945 after World War II. Penava led the tambura orchestra of Radio Sarajevo for more than twenty years. ==Songs== *\"Sve behara i sve cvjeta\" *\"Sjetuje me majka\" *\"Cvati ru\u017eo moja\" *\"Sarajevo, behara ti tvoga\" *\"Gledala sam sa prozora\" *\"Na mezaru majka pla\u010de i ni\u0161ane ljubi\" *\"Golube poleti\" *\"Pokraj ku\u0107e male\" *\"Saraj\u010dice hajdemo\" *\"Pjesma Kiseljaku\" *\"Ismihana du\u0161o moja\" *\"Mene moja zaklinjala majka\" ==References== ==External links== *Jozo Penava discography at Discogs Category:1909 births Category:1987 deaths Category:People from Kiseljak Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Sevdalinka Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina musicians Category:Musicians from Sarajevo ",
