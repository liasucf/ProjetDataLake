    "text": "Ludovico Zuccolo (1568-1630) was an Italian writer and political theorist. ==Life== Ludovico Zuccolo was born into a noble family in Faenza. He was educated at Bologna University, where he studied philosophy at the Faculty of Arts. He was briefly a lawyer and philosophy professor at Bologna University. From 1608 to 1617 he served as a courtier in Urbino. From 1617 to 1623 he taught philosophy at Bologna and Padua University. In 1623 he accompanied the apostolic nuncio Innocenzo Massimo on a diplomatic mission to Spain. He returned to Italy in 1625, dying in Bologna in 1630. Zuccolo is remembered as a theorist of reason of state: against Scipione Ammirato, Zuccolo argued that reason of state did not necessarily involve breaking the law, but included any action aiming at conserving a particular form of government. He is also remembered for the attention he gave to utopia in three pieces of writing included in his 1625 Dialogues: 'Aromatario, or the Republic of Utopia'; 'Porto, or the Republic of Evandria'; and 'Belluzzi, or the Happy City'. ==Works== * Della ragion di stato, 1621.
