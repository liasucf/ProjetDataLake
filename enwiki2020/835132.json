His father was the brother of the last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus, who saw in his nephew a possible successor and heir to the throne of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Both, Kazimierz and the monarch were born from Konstancja Czartoryska, (January 29, 1700 \u2013 October 27, 1759), in-laws of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Czartoryski philo-Russian family. Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski became the Knight of the Order of the White Eagle on December 8, 1773. Very well educated and particularly interested in the finances and economy of the country, as well as the arts, Poniatowski was not a very popular figure among the nobility, the so-called szlachta, who perceived him as being arrogant and competitive. He commissioned about 2500 engraved precious gems to a group of gem-engravers in Rome who turned to Classical literature for inspiration. In 1830, Poniatowski published a summary catalogue of his gems, Catalogue des Pierres Gravees Antiques de S.A. le Prince Stanislas Poniatowski, which contained elaborate descriptions. His collection was sold after his death at a Christie's auction in 1839 and has been dispersed ever since.http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/poniatowski/default.htm Following the Partitions of Poland, Poniatowski emigrated to Italy, where he lived in Rome, and then in Florence. He is the ancestor of the present members of the Poniatowski family bearing the title of F\u00fcrst Poniatowski or Principe Poniatowski di Monterotondo. Some sources state that he married Cassandra Luci (Rome, 1785 - Florence, 1863) in 1806,The Nathaniel Hawthorne review, Vol. 22, II, Nathaniel Hawthorne Society, Hawthorne-Longfellow Library, 1996, p. 32 but apparently that has never occurred as she was married to Vicenzo Venturini Benloch. Among his descendants are the Princes Poniatowski of the Empire of Austria and Counts and the Princes of Monterotondo in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany: * Isabella Luci (Rome, 1806 - Florence, 1896), married firstly in January/February 1821 to Count Prospero Bentivoglio (- 1821), without children, and secondly in 1822 to Count Zanobi di Ricci (- October 16, 1844), their daughter was Marie-Anne Walewska. Then, she married Marquess Filippo De Piccolellis. * Carlo Luci (Rome, 1808 - Florence, 1887), later Poniatowski, legitimized in 1847, made Conte di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany on November 20, 1847, Principe di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany and Prince Poniatowski by the Emperor of Austria both on November 19, 1850 (Rome, August 4, 1808 - San Pancrazio, July 23, 1887), married in Florence, September 21, 1831 to Elisa Napoleone Montecatini (Lucca, November 4, 1808 - Lucca, April 18, 1893), without children. * Costanza Luci (Rome, 1811 - Florence, 1851), married to Count Daniele Zappi. * Giuseppe Michele Saverio Francesco Giovanni Luci(Rome, February 21, 1816 - London, July 4, 1873), later known as J\u00f3zef Micha\u0142 Poniatowski, legitimized in 1847, made Conte di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany on November 20, 1847, Principe di Monterotondo by the Grand Duke of Tuscany and Prince Poniatowski by the Emperor of Austria both on November 19, 1850.W. L. Hubbard, The American History and Encyclopedia of Music, p. 168 He was a composer and a singer, and was sent to Paris as plenipotentiary by Grand Duke of Tuscany Leopold II. In 1834, he married Countess Matilda Perotti (1814 - February 1875) in Florence, and they had one son, Stanislaus August Friedrich Joseph Telemach Luci. * Michele Luci (Rome, 1816 - Florence, 1864), founder of Imparziale fiorentino. ==Gallery== File:Bacciarelli Apolonia Ustrzycka and her son.jpg|Apolonia Ustrzycka and her son, by Marcello Bacciarelli File:Stanislaw Poniatowski young.jpg|Prince Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski File:Kauffman Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski.jpg|Portrait of Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski, by Angelica Kauffman, 1786 File:Cassandra Luci.jpg|Cassandra Luci File:Costanza Luci.jpg|Costanza Luci File:Isabella Luci.jpg|Isabella Luci File:Luci-Poniatowscy 2.jpg|Carlo, Giuseppe and Michele Luci-Poniatowski File:Photo-pierre.JPG|Print from the \"Catalogue des Pierres Gravees Antiques de S.A. le Prince Stanislas Poniatowski\" depicting some of the mythological scenes carved on the gems of the prince's collection ==References== ==Bibliography== * AA.VV, Polonia- Italia: relazioni artistiche dal medioevo al XVIII secolo, Polska Akademia Nauk Stacja Naukowa w Rzymie, Zak\u0142ad Narodowy imienia Ossoli\u0144skich, 1979 * The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Vol. 22, 1911, p. 61\\. * Category:1754 births Category:1833 deaths Category:Nobility from Warsaw Stanislaw 1754 Category:18th-century Polish people Category:Grand Treasurers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Category:Politicians from Warsaw ",
