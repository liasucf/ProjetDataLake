It has been spelled a number of different ways over time, Boondi, Bundi, Bundye. Aboriginal rock carvings can still be seen on a rocky surface between the sewerage ventilation shaft near Bondi Golf Course and the cliff. A nearby group of carvings were done by Europeans; these were examined in 1910 by Lawrence Hargrave, who considered them to be the work of Spanish sailors who arrived in 1595.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au However, more recent study has suggested that the carvings were in fact the work of quarrymen working at the nearby Murriverie Quarry, and were created between 1890 and 1915.State Heritage Registertimalderman.com Another Aboriginal carving can be found at Ben Buckler, the headland immediately east of Bondi Beach. It is approximately a metre long and represents a turtle. The whole Bondi area was part of an land grant to road-builder William Roberts in 1809.
