Georgetown's official records do not include any games prior to 1887, however media guides prior to 1950 included this season's result. Despite issuing a challenge to Georgetown, the Alexandria High School team did not appear for the game, resulting in a forfeit. This marks the only win credited to Georgetown against Alexandria High School, as match-ups in 1887 and 1888 resulted in defeats for Georgetown. ==Schedule== ==References== Georgetown Category:Georgetown Hoyas football seasons Category:College football undefeated seasons Georgetown football ",
