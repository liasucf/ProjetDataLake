He is known for his punching power and currently holds a 92.9% knockout-to-win ratio. As an amateur, he was a five-time national junior titlist and British amateur champion. ==Amateur career== His father took him to the boxing gym at the age of nine to stay out of trouble in South London. He trains at the Peacock Gym in Canning Town, working under Tony and Martin Bowers. Dubois had around 75 amateur bouts. He won two English schoolboy titles, two junior ABAs plus the CYPs. Won the British Seniors. He spent a year and a half as part of the GB Elite set-up in Sheffield and boxed for England around a dozen times, competing at the European Youth championships twice and winning gold medals at multi-nations in Tammer (Finland) and Brandenburg (Germany). He left the amateurs early with only a handful of senior amateur bouts. He was on the Great Britain Olympic team with the plan to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, however he opted to turn professional instead, signing with boxing promoter Frank Warren of Queensberry Promotions. ==Professional career== Dubois' first fight as a professional was a knockout win in the first 35 seconds of the first round against Marcus Kelly in April 2017. In his fourth fight, he knocked out Mauricio Barragan, a late substitute, in the second round to win the vacant WBC Youth heavyweight title. In October 2017, he knocked out AJ Carter in the first round to claim the Southern Area heavyweight title. He won the English heavyweight title in his eighth fight in June 2018, beating journeyman Tom Little by stoppage in the fifth round. He won the WBO European title in March 2019, beating former WBO heavyweight title challenger, Razvan Cojanu, in two rounds. Dubois was taken the full distance for the first time by veteran Kevin Johnson in October 2018, winning on points after ten rounds, and beat Richard Lartey in the fourth round in April 2019. In July 2019, he beat Nathan Gorman by knockout in the fifth round to improve his record to 12 wins, 11 by stoppage, and win the vacant British heavyweight title. Boxing journalist Steve Bunce said he \u201c...fought like an old, seasoned bruiser, his feet flawless, his jab a stiff weapon inherited from relics of the ring\u201d. BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello described him as \"...one of the brightest prospects in the sport at the moment.\" ==Personal life== Dubois' younger sister Caroline Dubois is also a boxer. She has represented Great Britain and in 2018 became the -60kg European Junior, World Youth and Youth Olympic champion.https://www.teamgb.com/news/dubois-looking-forwards-after-incredible- year == Professional boxing record == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |16 | | |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joe Joyce | |\u2013 (12) |28 Nov 2020 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ricardo Snijders |TKO |2 (12), |29 Aug 2020 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kyotaro Fujimoto |KO |2 (12), |21 Dec 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ebenezer Tetteh |TKO |1 (12), |27 Sep 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nathan Gorman |KO |5 (12), |13 Jul 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Lartey |KO ||4 (10), |27 Apr 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| R\u0103zvan Cojanu |KO |2 (10), |8 Mar 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kevin Johnson | |10 |6 Oct 2018 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Tom Little |TKO |5 (10), |23 Jun 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| DL Jones |TKO |3 (10), |24 Feb 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Dorian Darch |TKO |2 (10), |9 Dec 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| AJ Carter |KO |1 (10), |16 Sep 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mauricio Barragan |KO |2 (10), |8 Jul 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| David Howe || |1 (4), |20 May 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Blaise Mendouo |TKO |2 (4), |22 Apr 2017 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Marcus Kelly | |1 (4), |8 Apr 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |} == References == == External links == * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:People from Greenwich Category:English male boxers Category:Boxers from Greater London Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:British Boxing Board of Control champions Category:Commonwealth Boxing Council champions ",
