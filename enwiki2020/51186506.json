    "text": "Rain Forest is a 1966 album by Walter Wanderley. == Reception == Billboard magazine reviewed the album in their September 3, 1966 issue and wrote that the \"young Brazilian organist plays superbly\" and that \"\"Summer Samba\" has the power to pull this delightful package right up the LP chart\". Judith Schlesinger reviewed the reissue of the album for Allmusic and wrote that the album \"does evoke strong water images, like \"poolside\" and \"ice skating rink.\"\" and that the listener is \"catapulted straight back to the '60s when bossa nova was new in the U.S. and everyone wanted a piece of it\". Schlesinger commented that the shortness of the songs left the \"jazzmen...underutilized\", but praised Urbie Green's work on \"Rain\" and \"Beach Samba\". == Track listing == # \"Summer Samba (So Nice)\" (Norman Gimbel, Marcos Valle, Paulo S\u00e9rgio Valle) \u2013 3:07 # \"It's Easy to Say Good-Bye\" (Tito Madi) \u2013 2:03 # \"Cried, Cried\" (Luiz Antonio) \u2013 2:26 # \"Rain\" (Durval Ferreira) \u2013 3:48 # \"The Girl from Ipanema\" (Norman Gimbel, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Vin\u00edcius de Moraes) \u2013 2:38 # \"Beloved Melancholy\" (Madi) \u2013 2:42 # \"Taste of Sadness\" (Luiz Antonio, Ferreira) \u2013 2:54 # \"Bossa Na Praia (Beach Samba)\" (Geraldo Cunha, Pery Ribeiro) \u2013 3:54 # \"Call Me\" (Tony Hatch) \u2013 2:26 # \"Cry out Your Sadness\" (Oscar Castro-Neves) \u2013 2:46 # \"The Great Love\" (Jobim) \u2013 3:04 # \"Samba do Avi\u00e3o (Song of the Jet)\" (Jobim, Gene Lees) \u2013 2:43 == Personnel == *Walter Wanderley \u2013 arranger, electronic organ, piano *Claudio Slon \u2013 drums *Jose Marino \u2013 bass *Joe Grimm \u2013 flute *Bucky Pizzarelli \u2013 guitar *Urbie Green \u2013 trombone *Bobby Rosengarden \u2013 percussion Production *Creed Taylor \u2013 producer *Tony Bennett \u2013 liner notes *Deborah Hay \u2013 editing, text editor *Sung Lee \u2013 art direction, design *Acy Lehman \u2013 cover design *Suzanne White \u2013 design coordinator *Val Valentin \u2013 engineer, director of engineering *Rudy Van Gelder \u2013 engineer *Richard Seidel \u2013 executive producer *Kevin Reeves \u2013 mastering *Smay Vision \u2013 package layout *Tom Greenwood, Carlos Kase, Bryan Koniarz \u2013 production coordination *Ben Young \u2013 reissue research, restoration *Jerry Rappaport \u2013 reissue supervisor == References == Category:1966 albums Category:Albums produced by Creed Taylor Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Walter Wanderley albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
