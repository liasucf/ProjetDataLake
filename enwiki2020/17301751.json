    "text": "Bristol Ferry Light with the base of the Mount Hope Bridge on left Bristol Ferry Light is a historic lighthouse in Bristol, Rhode Island, United States. It is located on the shores of Narragansett Bay at Bristol Point, the northern land point of Mount Hope Bay at the base of the Mount Hope Bridge. The two- story square brick lighthouse was built in 1855, along with an attached story brick keeper's house. Its use was discontinued in 1927 with the construction of the Mount Hope Bridge, and a replacement automated beacon across Ferry Road. Prior to the construction of the bridge, a ferry operated between Bristol and Aquidneck Island, and the light assisted the ferry service. The Bristol Ferry Lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, at which time it was a private residence. == See also == *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, Rhode Island ==References== ==External links== * * Lighthouse info site * National Register site link *1855 Plans for Bristol Ferry Lighthouse Category:1855 establishments in Rhode Island Category:Buildings and structures in Bristol, Rhode Island Category:Lighthouses completed in 1855 Category:Lighthouses in Rhode Island Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Narragansett Bay Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bristol County, Rhode Island Category:Tourist attractions in Bristol County, Rhode Island Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Bristol County, Rhode Island ",
