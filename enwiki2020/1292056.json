It was reformed in the present shape in 1972 as an organ of Tribhuvan University.IOE runs professional diplomas, undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs. The institute has four constituent and ten affiliated campuses in the country.It has five constituent campus namely Purwanchal Campus, Pashchimanchal Campus, Thapathali Campus, Pulchowk Campus and Chitwan Engineering Campus. == History == The history of engineering education in Nepal can be traced to 1930, when a Technical Training School was established. The engineering section of the school offered only trades and civil sub-overseers programs. In 1959, the Nepal Engineering Institute, with the assistance of the government of India, started offering civil overseer courses leading to a Diploma in Civil Engineering. The Technical Training Institute established in 1965, with the assistance from the Government of Federal Republic of Germany, offered technician courses in general courses in General Mechanics, Auto Mechanics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Drafting. In 1972, the Nepal Engineering Institute at Pulchowk and the Technical Training Institute at Thapathali were brought together under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University to constitute the Institute of Engineering. The Nepal Engineering Institute and the Technical Training Institute were renamed as Pulchowk campus and Thapathali Campus respectively. The technician programs in Electrical, Electronics, Refrigeration/Air-conditioning Engineering were started at Pulchowk campus, with the assistance from UNDP/ILO. The Architecture Technician program was started by the IOE. With the assistance of the World Bank and UK, later, the existing technician level courses were strengthened and a bachelor's degree level course in Civil Engineering was started. Similarly, with the assistance of the World Bank, the Swiss government, and the Canadian government, Bachelor's degree level courses in Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical engineering and Architecture were started in the Pulchowk campus. In 1998 IOE started a bachelor's degree program in Computer Engineering. In 1996, the Pulchowk campus, with support from the Norwegian government, started M.Sc. courses in Urban Planning, Structural Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Engineering. Pulchok Campus started M.Sc. courses in Renewable Energy and Geothermal Engineering, Information and Communication and Power Systems Engineering effective from December 2001. The diploma level programs at the Pulchowk Campus have been transferred to other three IOE campuses. The Pashchimanchal Campus in Pokhara of IOE became operational from 1987, with the assistance from the World Bank and UNDP/ILO. Initially trades and technician courses were offered. It offered diploma level courses in Civil, Electrical, Electronics, Automobile and Mechanical Engineering up to 2012. In 1999 a bachelor's degree program in Civil Engineering was started. Now it offers bachelor's degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics & Communication, Computer, and Geomatics Engineering (started in 2012).
