    "text": "L'Accord\u00e9e de Village is a painting by the French artist Jean-Baptiste Greuze, first exhibited at the 1761 Salon, where it was unanimously praised by the critics, notably by Diderot. It was the first example of the 'moral painting' genre, to which Greuze often returned. It is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. It was part of a series of 6 paintings. Caroline de Valory, a former pupil of Greuze, collaborated with the writer Alexandre Louis Bertrand Robineau to produce L'Accord\u00e9e de Village, a one-act comedy based on the paintings. ==Bibliography== *Denis Diderot, Salon de 1765, Hermann, Paris, 1984 *Denis Diderot, H\u00e9ros et martyrs, Hermann, Paris, 1995 *Denis Diderot, Essais sur la peinture, Salons de 1759, 1761, 1763, Hermann, Paris, 2007 *Edgar Munhall, Jean-Baptiste Greuze 1728\u20131805, catalogue of an exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, 1977 category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists category:1761 paintings Category:Paintings by Jean-Baptiste Greuze ",
