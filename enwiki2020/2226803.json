    "text": "Katharine Fraser, Mistress of Saltoun, DL (born 11 October 1957) is the daughter of Captain Alexander Ramsay of Mar and Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun. ==Biography== She was born Katharine Ingrid Mary Isabel Ramsay in Fraserburgh, Scotland. Her mother, Lady Saltoun, is the suo jure Lady Saltoun and the Chief of the name and arms of Fraser. Her father was great-grandson of Queen Victoria. As the eldest daughter without any brothers, Fraser is the heir presumptive to the chiefship and the lordship held by her mother. Since one cannot become the chief of a clan without taking the clan's surname, Lord Lyon King of Arms recognized her use of the surname Fraser in 1973. On 20 April 2005, Fraser was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. ==Marriage and children== In February, 1980, the engagement between Fraser and Captain Mark Malise Nicolson (b. 29 September 1954) was announced.
