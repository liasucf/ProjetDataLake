Under a new playoff format, the San Juan Knights, the MPBL Northern Division champion, and Davao Occidental Tigers as the MPBL Southern Division Champion, competed for the inaugural Datu Cup championship and the second overall championship contested by the league. Davao Occidental, which finished with the better regular season record, held the homecourt advantage for the series. The San Juan Knights won the championship after defeating the Tigers in five games, 3 games to 2. == Background == === San Juan Knights === The San Juan Knights entered the season as heavy favorites to win the national championship, as they are loaded with a mix of ex-pro players, collegiate players and homegrown players. They finished the regular season with a 20-5 win loss record, tying with the Manila Stars for third place as both teams had an identical record. The Knights were able to clinch the third seed as they defeated the Stars in the eliminations. In the first two rounds of the playoffs, The Knights easily dealt the Navotas Clutch and the Quezon City Capitals both in just two games each series. The Division Finals saw their sister team, Manila Stars battling them for the Northern Division title. The series went to a decider, where the team would eventually defeat the Stars in Game 3 to clinch North Division title and move to their first ever MPBL Finals appearance. === Davao Occidental Tigers === Davao Occidental Tigers came in to the tournament as the 2018 Preseason Champions winning over the Manila Stars in the finals. The Tigers ended their regular season with 20\u20135 win-loss record, to become the top seed in the South Division and clinch homecourt advantage for the division playoffs. They easily defeated the Cebu City Sharks and the Bacoor City Strikers in the first round and in the division semifinals, both sweeping in two games each series. In the division finals, they faced the defending 2018 MPBL Rajah Cup Champions Batangas City Athletics but were pushed to the limits, even forcing Game 3 decider before escaping the Athletics, to claim its division title and advance to its first ever MPBL Finals appearance. == Road to the Finals == {| style=\"width:100%; font-size:90%\" class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=top ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"| San Juan Knights (Northern Division Champion) !! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"| Davao Occidental Tigers (Southern Division Champion) |- |align=left| 3rd seed in the North, 4th best league record !colspan=2|Regular season | 1st seed in the South, 3rd best league record |- |align=right|Defeated 6th-seeded Navotas Clutch, 2\u20130 !colspan=2|First Round |align=left|Defeated 8th-seeded Cebu City Sharks, 2\u20130 |- |align=right|Defeated 7th-seeded Quezon City Capitals, 2\u20130 !colspan=2|Division Semifinals |align=left|Defeated 5th-seeded Bacoor City Strikers, 2\u20130 |- |align=right|Defeated 4th-seeded Manila Stars, 2\u20131 !colspan=2|Division Finals |align=left|Defeated 2nd-seeded Batangas City Athletics, 2\u20131 |} === Head-to-head matchup === Since both teams have an identical 20\u20135 win-loss record, the Davao Occidental Tigers will hold the homecourt advantage for the title series as they defeated the San Juan Knights in the eliminations. == Series summary == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
