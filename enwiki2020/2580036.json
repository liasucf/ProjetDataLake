    "text": "is a district in K\u014dt\u014d, Tokyo, Japan, consisting of an artificial island built using waste landfill. It is not the first such island in the bay (See Umi-no- mori :ja:\u6d77\u306e\u68ee\u516c\u5712), however at current fill rates there will be no more room for waste landfill in the bay without affecting shipping lanes by around 2050, likewise Osaka Bay and Ise Bay also are slowing being consumed by waste landfill islands, e.g. Rinku Town. ==History== The island was originally conceived in the 1930s as a site for a new Tokyo Municipal Airport to replace Haneda Airport. The airport plan was finalized in 1938 and work on the island began in 1939, but fell behind schedule due to resource constraints during World War II. The airport plan was officially abandoned following the war, as the Allied occupation authorities favored expanding Haneda rather than building a new airport. A public beach opened on the island in 1947, at which time the \"Yumenoshima\" name was adopted. The beach closed in 1950, and from 1957 the island was used for garbage disposal. ==Places== Shin-Koto Incineration Plant Yumenoshima is a fairly small district, and contains: * Yumenoshima Park, a public park with an array of facilities, including a tropical botanical garden, a sports complex, a barbecue area, a colosseum, a yacht marina, and a track and field stadium * Yumenoshima Stadium, a football and athletics stadium used for youth competitions and lower league football matches. * Yumenoshima Baseball Field, a baseball field for local youth teams * Koto Incineration Facility, an incineration facility for Koto ward Today, Yumenoshima also houses the Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru, a wooden fishing boat exposed to nuclear fallout during the Bikini Atoll test in 1954; the boat was modified as a training vessel following the exposure, and later abandoned near Yumenoshima. == 2020 Summer Olympics == Yumenoshima Park is set to be the venue for archery events in the 2020 Summer Olympics. It will also host archery events for the 2020 Summer Paralympics. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Artificial islands of Tokyo Category:Districts of K\u014dt\u014d Category:Islands of Tokyo ",
