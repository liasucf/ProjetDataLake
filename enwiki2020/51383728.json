It is organized by Hamburg Konzerte agency. ==History== The festival takes place on the compound of the Hamburg Wholesale Market. The first edition of the festival was sold out completely in a very short time with 14,000 tickets.Metal Hammer: Elbriot Festival 2013 mit Slayer ist komplett ausverkauft, metal-hammer.de, in German It faced some organizational problems partly due to the high number of visitors, such as unnecessary barriers or lack of supply of drinks. In the subsequent years, a revised approach was introduced, such as a changed entrance situation and fewer barriers. The metal core band As I Lay Dying had to cancel their appearance in 2013, because their frontman Tim Lambesis was arrested shortly before. Caliban filled in in 2013, and Wovenwar, founded by three former members of As I Lay Dying, played in 2014.Metal ohne Feuerpause auf dem Gro\u00dfmarkt, Die Welt, 14 August 2014, in German The second festival was overshadowed by cool temperatures, gusts of wind and some rain showers.
