    "text": ":For more information on the pre-1947 corps, see Indian Armoured Corps. The Indian Army Armoured Corps is one of the combat arms of the Indian Army. Formed in 1947 from two-thirds of the personnel and assets of the Raj's Indian Armoured Corps. It currently consists of 67 armoured regiments, including the president's bodyguards. The naming of the regiments varies. The terms \"Cavalry\", \"Horse\" and \"Lancers\", which have been dispensed with in the case of units raised post-independence, are historical legacies from the raising and renaming of these units when part of the East India Company's army and/or later the British Indian Army. The Armoured Corps School and Centre is at Ahmednagar. As a matter of tradition, each Armoured Regiment has its own \"Colonel of the Regiment\", an honorary post for a senior officer who oversees the regimental issues concerning the unit. The Armoured Corps celebrates 1 May as its Corps Day. ==List of regiments== Sherman III tank in the Middle East, March 1944.
