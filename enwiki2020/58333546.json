    "text": "Steven Jeffrey Seddon (born 25 December 1997) is an English footballer who plays as a left back for club AFC Wimbledon, on loan from Birmingham City of the Championship. Seddon was on the books of Reading as a youngster before joining Birmingham City in 2014 when he left school. He spent the first half of the 2018\u201319 season on loan to League Two club Stevenage, for whom he made his Football League debut, and the second half on loan to AFC Wimbledon of League One. In 2019-20 he was loaned to Portsmouth and in September 2020 he returned to AFC Wimbledon for the season. ==Club career== ===Early life and career=== Seddon was born in Berkshire, where he attended The Piggott School in Wargrave and then The Forest School, Winnersh, the partner school of Reading F.C.'s academy. He joined Reading after being spotted when playing for Twyford Comets. After a trial with Birmingham City in 2014, he took up a scholarship with the club that summer. Interviewed later that year, he assessed his strength as his left foot, and felt he needed to improve his tackling. He signed his first professional contract, of two years, in April 2016. In the 2017\u201318 season, he trained with the first team on occasion, and was included in the travelling squad for first-team fixtures, although did not make the bench. In December, with centre-back Harlee Dean suspended, Seddon was suggested by the Birmingham Mail as a possible addition to the squad for the visit to Fulham, and on 27 January 2018, he was given a squad number and included among the substitutes for the FA Cup fourth-round visit to Premier League club Huddersfield Town. He remained unused, and later in the season was an unused substitute for two Championship matches. In May 2018, Seddon signed a new one-year deal, with the option of a second year. He was a member of the first-team squad for their pre-season training camp in Austria, and was given a squad number for the 2018\u201319 season. He was an unused substitute for the 2018\u201319 EFL Cup first-round defeat away to Reading. ===Stevenage (loan)=== Seddon joined League Two club Stevenage on 30 August 2018 on loan until 15 January 2019. He made his Football League debut two days later in the starting eleven for the match at home to Cambridge United; he was substituted at half- time as his team went on to lose 1\u20130. Seddon made 25 appearances during his loan spell, of which 23 were in league competition. ===AFC Wimbledon (loan)=== The day after his loan at Stevenage expired, Seddon joined AFC Wimbledon of League One on loan until the end of the season. He went straight into the starting eleven, playing the whole of a 4\u20131 defeat at home to Barnsley, but suffered a minor hamstring injury that kept him out of the next match. He returned to the starting eleven for the visit to Sunderland, and stayed in it for the remaining 16 league matches, finishing with a 12-match unbeaten run that secured his team's League One status for the 2019\u201320 season. ===First- team football with Birmingham City=== Seddon made his first competitive appearance for Birmingham in the starting eleven for the opening fixture of the 2019\u201320 season, a visit to Brentford in the Championship. He marked his debut with a run and cross to set up Kristian Pedersen's matchwinning header. He started twice more in the league, and provided the assist for \u00c1lvaro Gim\u00e9nez' first goal for the club, in a 2\u20130 win against Barnsley, but played no part in the matchday squad after the end of August. ===Portsmouth (loan)=== Seddon joined League One club Portsmouth on 2 January 2020 on loan until the end of the season. ===Return to AFC Wimbledon=== Seddon was a unused substitute for two of Birmingham's first three matches of the 2020\u201321 season, before returning to AFC Wimbledon on 24 September on loan for the rest of the campaign. He marked his second debut, two days later away to Fleetwood Town, with the only goal of the match after \"a determined charge from the back\". ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Birmingham City |2017\u201318 |Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |Championship||4||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |2020\u201321 |Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !4||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |Stevenage (loan) |2018\u201319 |League Two||23||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||25||3 |- |AFC Wimbledon (loan) |2018\u201319 |League One||18||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||3 |- |Portsmouth (loan) |2019\u201320 |League One||12||1||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0||18||1 |- |AFC Wimbledon (loan) |2020\u201321 |League One||4||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||4||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !61||8||4||0||1||0||4||0||70||8 |} ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Birmingham City F.C. website Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Berkshire Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:AFC Wimbledon players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
