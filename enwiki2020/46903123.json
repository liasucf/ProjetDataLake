Her RITA-winning novel Leaves of Fortune received mixed industry reviews. Kirkus Reviews called it a \"murky brew, complete with ghostly visitations...\" Publishers Weekly said, \"Past and present collide predictably in a competent, though not especially exciting novel... The most compelling, evocative scenes take place in India... Otherwise, this is a largely overheated brew of incest, New Age mysticism and dark deeds.\" However, The New York Times listed it as a noteworthy book in 1990 and the original reviewer said \"it should be subtitled 'Something for Everyone.' The novel has 'channeling and crystals for the New Age crowd. And for mainstream readers, there is money, lots of it, as well as power plays, revenge, death and even eating disorders.'\" ==References== ==External links == * Author's Blog * Author's Website Category:Living people Category:American romantic fiction writers Category:RITA Award winners Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st- century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:Women romantic fiction writers Category:Novelists from Massachusetts Category:Boston College alumni Category:Wheaton College (Massachusetts) alumni Category:Harvard Extension School faculty ",
