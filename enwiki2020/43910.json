Captain Cook had been a hero of mine when I was a kid, and I thought it would be exciting to go to some of the places in the Pacific where he'd been.\" The success of Tom Jones enabled Finney to produce his next film, Night Must Fall, in 1964, which he also starred in and which was directed by Reisz. A remake of the classic 1937 film of the same title, the film was a flop and Finney's performance received poor reviews. ===1963\u20131974=== Finney in 1966 Finney undertook a season of plays at the Royal National Theatre, including Miss Julie by August Strindberg in 1965.https://passiton.cft.org.uk/archive/cast-list-miss-julie-1965/ He returned to films with Two for the Road (1967) co starring Audrey Hepburn.

H. WEILER. New York Times 12 May 1974: 49. Finney decided to take time off from features and focus on stage acting, doing classics at the National Theatre in London. \"I felt that it needed commitment,\" he later said. \"When you're making movies all the time, you stop breathing. You literally don't breathe in the same way that you do when you're playing the classics. When you have to deliver those long, complex speeches on stage, you can't heave your shoulders after every sentence. The set of muscles required for that kind of acting need to be trained. I really wanted to try and do justice to my own potential in the parts. I didn't want to be a movie actor just dropping in, doing Hamlet and taking off again. I wanted to feel part of the company.\"Finney comes back to film Farber, Stephen. New York Times 26 July 1981: A.1. Finney was at the National for over three years during which he played in Hamlet, Macbeth, Tamburlaine, and plays by Anton Chekhov.

The last two successful films he had made were Scrooge and Orient Express in which he was heavily disguised. \"Most Americans probably think I weigh 300 pounds, have black hair and talk with a French accent like Hercule Poirot,\" said Finney. \"So I thought they should have a look at me while I was still almost a juvenile and kind of cute.\" Finney decided to make six films in succession \"so that I could relax and get back into it again. In order to feel really assured and comfortable in front of a camera, you've got to do it for a while.\" The first three were thrillers: Loophole (1981), with Susannah York; Wolfen (1981), directed by Michael Wadleigh; and Looker (1981), written and directed by Michael Crichton.Albert Finney stages a film comeback, Blume, Mary. Los Angeles Times 19 Oct 1980: p67. He received excellent reviews for his performance in the drama Shoot the Moon (1982). Finney said the role \"required personal acting; I had to dig into myself. When you have to expose yourself and use your own vulnerability, you can get a little near the edge.\" Less well received was his performance as Daddy Warbucks in the Hollywood film version of Annie (1982), which was directed by John Huston. Finney said going into this film after Shoot the Moon was \"marvelous. I use a completely different side of myself as Warbucks. 'Annie' is show biz; it's open, simple and direct. It needs bold, primary colors. I don't have to reveal the inner workings of the character, and that's a relief.\" Finney went into The Dresser (1983), directed by Peter Yates, which earned him a Best Actor Oscar Nomination. He then played the title role in the TV movie Pope John Paul II (1984), his American TV debut.
