    "text": "Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque is a French cheese, originally manufactured in the area around the commune of Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, between Deauville and Lisieux in the Calvados d\u00e9partement of Normandy. It is probably the oldest Norman cheese still in production.Leanne Kitchen The Dairy 2008 - Page 149 \"Pont-l'\u00e9v\u00eaque - Named after the village in Normandy where it supposedly first appeared, this cheese is one of the most popular in France. An old cheese, it dates from at least the 12th century, when it was made by monks; it was once known as 'white meat' as it was eaten instead of meat on fasting days .. Pont l'\u00e9v\u00eaque is a cow's milk cheese, with a full, rich, sweet, slightly tangy flavour profile and a thin brownish rind; it is very similar to livarot, another washed-rind......\" Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque is an uncooked, unpressed cow's-milk cheese, square in shape usually at around square and around high, weighing . The central p\u00e2te is soft, creamy pale yellow in color with a smooth, fine texture and has a pungent aroma. This is surrounded by a washed rind that is white with a gentle orange- brown coloration. The whole is soft when pressed but lacks elasticity. It is generally ranked alongside Brie, Camembert, and Roquefort as one of the most popular cheeses in France. ==History== The cheese has been made in Normandy since at least the 12th century, and was allegedly first made by Cistercian monks who had settled west of Caen. Originally known as \"cherub\", it later took the name \"augelot\". Becoming popular across the country from the 16th century onwards, it then acquired the name of the village around which its production was centred. ==Manufacture== Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque was recognised as an Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) cheese on August 30, 1972, reaching full status in 1976. Its production was defined and protected with a decree of December 29, 1986.Le Petit Fut\u00e9 Normandie - Page 58 2011 \"Une Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e permet \u00e0 un fromage de se distinguer. ... Le meilleur du pont-l'\u00e9v\u00eaque vient du pays d'Auge; quant au livarot, il est fabriqu\u00e9 au sud- ouest du Calvados et au nord-ouest de l'Orne.\" Le Petit Fut\u00e9 guides commend that the best AOC Pont-l'\u00e9v\u00eaque comes from the Pays d'Auge, which includes the Canton of Pont-l'Ev\u00eaque itself.Le Petit Fut\u00e9 Deauville - Honfleur 2012 (avec cartes, photos + avis des lecteurs) - Page 44 2012 \"L'\u00e9tiquette \u00ab Fabriqu\u00e9 en Normandie \u00bb ne signifie pas, par exemple, que le fromage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 avec du lait normand !

The affinage lasts at least two weeks after production, though most are left for over six weeks. The cheese is around 45% fat as a percentage of dry matter and is manufactured throughout the year. Regulations currently allow either pasteurized or unpasteurized milk to be used for its manufacture. The annual production is around 3,500 tonnes, of which the majority is made by two large producers. Only 2% of the production is classed as fermier. Acclaimed manufacturers include Bisson et fils, Lanquet\u00f4t, Lepeudry, and Levasseur. Recipes include use in three-cheese fondue together with livarot and camembert, to accompany tournedos de veau.Le Petit Fut\u00e9 Rouen - Page 26 ed.
