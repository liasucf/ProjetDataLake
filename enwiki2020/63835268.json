    "text": "Jacob Ervin Holmen (born August 17, 1991) is an American former professional basketball player. He played four years of college basketball for North Texas, but his time on the court was restricted due to injuries, including his senior year where he sat out the entire second half of the season after sustaining a third concussion in just over a year. Upon turning pro, he played in Australia and Bulgaria, making a name for himself in the State Basketball League (SBL). He was named the SBL MVP in 2017 and won an SBL championship in 2018, but two knee injuries in less than a year saw his playing career come to an end. ==High school career== Holmen was born in Whitehouse, Texas. He attended Whitehouse High School and played for the school's basketball team. As a sophomore, he was named the 11-4A Newcomer of the Year. As a junior, he was the District 11-4A Defensive Player of the Year and a First-Team All-East Texas selection by the Tyler Morning Telegraph.

He was ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a third concussion in just over a year.

In the quarter- finals, Holmen helped the Hawks defeat the Lakeside Lightning 2\u20131 with a 33-point effort in game three. In game one of the semi-finals against the Rockingham Flames on August 18, Holmen suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first quarter as the Hawks lost 92\u201373.
