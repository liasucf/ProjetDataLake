The chronicle is now kept in Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich, where a facsimile can be viewed. It consists of a paper manuscript including some 230 coloured illustrations, most of them full page. Two hundred of the illustrations show war scenes; the remaining show everyday life, both rural and in towns, and also scenes in the royal court. In the epilogue, the two authors declare that the work was finished in 1470. Category:Swiss illustrated chronicles ",
