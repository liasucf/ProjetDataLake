    "text": "Barbara Retz (c.1885-25 May 1948), was a founder member of the Dublin Latter Day Saints as well as one of the women arrested in the Easter Rising in Dublin 1916. She was also arrested by the Nazis. ==Life and family== Born about 1885 in Stuttgart as Barbara \"Babette\" B\u00f6ger, daughter of forester John B\u00f6ger. Her family moved to Dublin where the family changed their name to Baker. They were Lutheran with an interest in the Latter Day Saint movement. They were baptised into the Church of Latter Day Saints by missionaries sent by the Preston England Temple and established a local branch. She married fellow German George Retz in 1904 with whom she had 2 children. Retz and her husband did not become UK citizens when her brothers got theirs in 1908. As a result, at the start of the War in 1914 George Retz was interned in the Isle of Man until 1919. Retz ran butcher shops, one on the South Circular Road and one in Rathmines. There had been an incident at one of the properties where a mob attacked the shop at the start of the war. The shops get a mention by James Joyce in Ulysses. ==Activism== There are few references to how Retz was connected to the Easter Rising but she may have been friends with Padraig Pearse. She was arrested and imprisoned with the other women in Richmond Barracks in 1916 and released at the same time on 8 May. She remained involved during the Irish War of Independence by arranging safe houses and medical treatment for the people on the run. Retz returned to Germany occasionally and in 1938 she was arrested for her part in an anti-Nazi rally in Berlin. Thanks to the intervention of the British embassy she was released after 14 days. She died in New York during May 1948 on her way to visit those family members who had emigrated to the United States. She is buried with family in California. ==References and sources== Category:1885 births Category:1948 deaths Category:19th-century German women Category:19th-century Irish women Category:20th-century German women Category:20th-century Irish women Category:German emigrants to Ireland Category:Irish Latter Day Saints Category:Irish religious workers Category:Women in Nazi Germany Category:Women in war Category:Women in war in Ireland Category:People of the Easter Rising Category:Women in war 1900\u20131945 ",
