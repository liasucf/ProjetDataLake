While he thought each episode of the series had \"elements of a basic procedural show like Law & Order\", he appreciated the \"little nuggets of an ongoing story about Liz\u2019s relationship with her husband and with Ray\". Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"D+\", noting that the episode \"represents a quantum leap in boringness for The Blacklist.\" He felt that the \"established supporting characters [didn't] get to show any new sides, and the imperiled guest characters who need rescuing from the bad guys [were] barely introduced\". Ross Bonaime of Paste gave \"Wujing\" a 5.3/10, stating that: \"The Blacklist keeps acting like it has all these fascinating cards up its sleeve, but it never shows them. Three episodes in, the mysteries that the show is holding out on aren\u2019t worth tuning in each week to solve, and the things it does reveal mean absolutely nothing to the viewer.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:The Blacklist (season 1) episodes ",
