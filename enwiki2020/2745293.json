Included on the album\u2014which is an Enhanced CD\u2014are three videos in QuickTime format. The album's title is a reference to an incident which occurred in 1988 on a flight to Tokyo during the Odyssey tour: having behaved obnoxiously whilst drunk, Malmsteen fell asleep and was later awoken by a woman pouring a jug of iced water on him. Enraged, he twice shouted \"You've released the fucking fury!\" (often misquoted as \"unleashed\"). The audio from this incident was caught on tape by drummer Anders Johansson, with bassist Barry Dunaway also being heard in the background.\"Yngwie Malmsteen Discusses the Infamous 'Unleash the Fucking Fury' Tape\".
