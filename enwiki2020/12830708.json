She's currently working on a new novel. ==Literary career== Pohl-Weary's second collection of poems, Ghost Sick: A Poetry of Witness won the 2016 Fred Cogswell Award for Excellence in Poetry. Canada's Parliamentary Poet George Elliott Clarke reviewed it thusly in the Halifax Chronicle: \"Like Holocaust witness poet Paul Celan, Pohl-Weary checks tabloids, billboards, newsflashes, for the language to bespeak domesticated violence.\" Her biography of Judith Merril, Better to Have Loved: The Life of Judith Merril (Between the Lines Books), won the Hugo Award for Best Related Book in 2003 and was a finalist for the Toronto Book Award. Asimov's Science Fiction magazine said in a review: \"Assembled from scraps, fragments, previously published essays, and polished manuscripts by Judith Merril's granddaughter, Emily Pohl-Weary has done a superhuman job.\" Pohl-Weary's first novel, A Girl Like Sugar, was published by McGilligan Books in 2004. It features a twenty-something girl haunted by her dead rock star boyfriend. She also edited a critically acclaimed female superhero anthology, Girls Who Bite Back: Witches Mutants, Slayers and Freaks (2004). Her subsequent books include a collection of poetry, Iron-on Constellations (2005) and the novel Strange Times at Western High (2006), featuring zine-publishing teen sleuth Natalie Fuentes, who teams up with a computer hacker and a graffiti artist to solve crime at her Toronto high school.Wilson, Julie (August 7, 2013). \"Emily Pohl-Weary on Turning Your Passions into Your Job\".

For three years, she led a weekly writing workshop for residents of Sagatay (Na- Me-Res), a long-term transitional home for First Nations, Metis and Inuit men in Toronto.
