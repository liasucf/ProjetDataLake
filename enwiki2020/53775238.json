    "text": "Ita was an ancient city and former bishopric in Roman North Africa, now a Latin Catholic titular see in Algeria. == History == Media was important enough in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis to become one of the many suffragan dioceses, but was to fade completely, no ruins being identified. Its only historically documented bishop was Lucius, who attended the Council of Carthage in 484 called by the Arian king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, after which he was banished like most Catholic participants, unlike the Donatist heretical counterparts. == Titular see == The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin titular bishopric of Ita (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Iten(sis) (Latin adjective). It is vacant, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank: * Tadeusz Stanis\u0142aw Szwagrzyk (1964.11.03 \u2013 death 1992.12.07) as Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of Cz\u0119stochowa (Poland) (1964.11.03 \u2013 1992.12.07) * James Anthony Tamayo (1993.01.26 \u2013 2000.07.03) as Auxiliary Bishop of Diocese of Galveston\u2013Houston (Texas, USA) (1993.01.26 \u2013 2000.07.03); later first Bishop of Laredo (Texas, USA) (2000.07.03 \u2013 ...) * Pedro Luiz Stringhini (2001.01.03 \u2013 2009.12.30) as Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) (2001.01.03 \u2013 2009.12.30); later Bishop of Franca (Brazil) (2009.12.30 \u2013 2012.09.19), Bishop of Mogi das Cruzes (Brazil) (2012.09.19 \u2013 ...) * Gabriel Edoe Kumordji, Divine Word Missionaries (S.V.D.)
