    "text": "Nude on the Moon is a 1961 science-fantasy nudist film co-written and co- directed by Doris Wishman and Raymond Phelan under the shared pseudonyms \"O. O. Miller\" and \"Anthony Brooks\". The film was produced in 1960 and theatrically released in 1961. Nude on the Moon is the second of eight nudist films produced and directed by Wishman. While most nudist films of the time were set within a conventional nudist camp, apparently as a promotional gimmick Wishman decided to set the story in a nudist civilization on the Moon. ==Plot== Scientist Dr. Jeff Huntley inherits a fortune from his uncle and invests it in the development of a rocket ship, built with the assistance of his mentor, Dr. Nichols. After landing on the Moon, the pair discover a civilization of topless extraterrestrials led by a Moon Queen with telepathic powers. Enamored of Dr. Huntley, the Moon Queen allows the men to take photos of the nudists during their everyday activities. Their oxygen running low, the two are forced to return to Earth, realizing in the process that they've left their camera behind and have no proof of the aliens' existence. Jeff is dispirited to learn that nobody believes their trip succeeded, but his spirits are lifted when he sees the resemblance between Dr. Nichols's secretary, Cathy, and the Moon Queen. The movie ends as the two embrace, signaling the beginning of a new romance. ==Soundtrack== Nude on the Moon features the original song \"I'm Mooning Over You (My Little Moon Doll)\" sung by Ralph Young (who also plays a principal role in Wishman's Blaze Starr Goes Nudist under the pseudonym \"Russ Martine\"). Young would soon meet Belgian singer Tony Sandler and form Sandler and Young, a successful easy-listening duo, with him. The lyrics and melody were written by Wishman's niece, Judith Kushner. According to Wishman, future Tonight Show bandleader Doc Severinsen arranged the orchestration but is not credited. ==Production== The Moon sequences in the film were shot at Coral Castle in Homestead, Florida. ==Reception== In a review for AllMovie, Fred Beldin wrote, \"Charming and bubble-headed, Nude on the Moon is a good-natured fantasy for bawdy kitsch lovers.\" ==Legacy== Nude on the Moon is considered a cult film. References to it in pop culture include: * Nude on the Moon: The B-52's Anthology, a two-disc CD anthology of music by The B-52's, was released on Rhino Records. Lead singer Fred Schneider was a friend of Wishman's in her later years. * \"Nude on the Moon,\" a 1996 single by electronica duo Tipsy, also appears on the album Trip Tease. One of the remixes is called the \"naked volleyball mix.\" ==See also== * List of American films of 1961 *List of films featuring extraterrestrials *Nudity in film ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1961 films Category:1960s erotic films Category:1960s science fiction films Category:American films Category:American science fiction films Category:English-language films Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films directed by Doris Wishman Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Moon in film Category:American sexploitation films ",
