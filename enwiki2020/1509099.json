    "text": "The Portuguese presidential election of 1980 was held on 7 December. Incumbent president General Ramalho Eanes gathered the support of the Socialist Party, despite the objection of their leader, M\u00e1rio Soares, and also the support of the Portuguese Communist Party, whose candidate, Carlos Brito, withdrew the week before the election giving his support to Eanes. The Communist Party of the Portuguese Workers also gave support to Eanes, whose picture became a feature on numerous walls around the country, painted by Communist Party activists. One of the major players in the democratic revolution of 1974, Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, was also a candidate, for the second time, but finished far behind his previous result of 1976. The newly-founded Workers Party of Socialist Unity presented its own candidate, Aires Rodrigues. His main opponent, General Soares Carneiro, was known for his right-wing views and was branded by opponents as a hardliner, with links to the dictatorial regime that had been overthrown only six years earlier. He was supported by the Democratic Alliance, a centre-right coalition of the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Social Center, and the smaller People's Monarchist Party. Two days before the election, two of Soares Carneiro's leading supporters, Prime Minister Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro (no relation) and Defence Minister Adelino Amaro da Costa, died in the 1980 Camarate air crash while they were heading for a rally in Oporto. Despite the accident, the election went ahead as planned, and predictions that a second round would be needed were shown to be wrong, with Ramalho Eanes winning with almost 57 percent, against 40 percent for Soares Carneiro. ==Procedure== Any Portuguese citizen over 35 years old has the opportunity to run for president. In order to do so it is necessary to gather between 7500 and 15000 signatures and submit them to the Portuguese Constitutional Court. According to the Portuguese Constitution, to be elected, a candidate needs a majority of votes. If no candidate gets this majority there will take place a second round between the two most voted candidates. ==Candidates== ===Official candidates=== *Ant\u00f3nio Ramalho Eanes, Incumbent President since 1976 and eligible for a second term, Independent candidate supported by the Socialist Party, Portuguese Communist Party and the Portuguese Workers' Communist Party; *Ant\u00f3nio Soares Carneiro , Military officer, supported by the Democratic Alliance; *Carlos Galv\u00e3o de Melo, General officer, Member of the National Salvation Junta, Independent candidate; *Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, Military officer, Independent candidate; *Ant\u00f3nio Pires Veloso, Major general of the Portuguese Army, Independent candidate; *Ant\u00f3nio Aires Rodrigues, supported by the Workers Party of Socialist Unity *Carlos Brito, Official candidate of the Portuguese Communist Party, Left the race to support Ramalho Eanes; ==Campaign period== ===Party slogans=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:left;\" |- ! style=\"text- align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Candidate !
