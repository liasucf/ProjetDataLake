    "text": "The word HIMO comes from the Syriac old language which is a dialect of Middle Aramaic that was once spoken across much of the Fertile Crescent and Eastern Arabia. Classical Syriac became a major literary language throughout the Middle East from the 4th to the 8th centuries. The world HIMO written( \u071a\u0718\u0712\u0710 ) in the Syriac language is literary translated into \u201clove\u201d in English and its roots are still obvious in the Arabic language as the World HIYAM (\u0647\u064a\u0627\u0645) means someone deeply in love and it is known to be the highest level of love in the Arabic language, however the Arabic word changed the letter O of HIMO into A as the Syriac language didn't have an A and most of the words taken from the Syriac language had their Os changed into As to match a more modern Arabic alphabet. HIMO Jewelry is a jewelry company that was established in 1973, and currently has twelve branches that spread all over the city of Beirut and over a hundred shops that sell its jewelry all over Lebanon. ==References== * * * * * Category:Aramaic languages ",
