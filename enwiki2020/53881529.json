His first marriage was to Dona Isabel D\u00edez de Aux. After her death he married dona Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Calvillo, Lady of Malon and Bisimbre. She was from a wealthy Jewish house who converted to avoid expulsion. Therefore his descendants all had Jewish blood. He had 1 legitimate son born in 1500: Juan III Francisco Coloma: 3rd Lord of Alfajarin, 2nd Lord of Elda, Salinas and Petrer. His illegitimate daughter became abbess of the monastery of Poor Clares in Zaragozza, where he is buried in the monasterymonasterio de Jerusal\u00e9n en Zaragoza that he founded. == Career == At a young age, he was sent to the royal court of Juan II de Arag\u00f3n; He became a close confidant to the king and from 1462 was his royal secretary. He took office between 1462 \u2013 1479. His career continued during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, in which he accompanied the court during the war to Granada. There he designed one of his major acts, the Alhambra Decree. He was requested to give counsel concerning the foundation of the Holy Inquisition in Aragon and sent a royal diplomat to the king of France Charles VIII. At the request of his patrons, he designed the conditions that Columbus could receive the royal patronage for his expedition. He concluded the important document with the royal approbation for Columbus in 1491. This concluded in the Capitulations of Santa Fe.The Book of Privileges Issued To Christopher Columbus By King Fernando and Queen Isabel 1492-1502 Ferdinand was grateful and bestowed noble status to his first wife in 1506.Carlos Coloma: 1566-1637, espada y pluma de los tercios / Miguel \u00c1ngel Guill Ortega However he wanted to climb higher and bought the Barony of Elda, Salinas and Petrer in 1512. This made possible that his descendants could ascend the hierarchy of the Spanish nobility. After the King's death in 1506, he retired to his palace in Zaragoza, where he became the second lord of Alfajarin. He then returned to Borja, where he died. == Memorial == The Centro de Estudios Borjanos organised in 2017 the A\u00f1o Coloma in honour of the 500th anniversary of his death. http://cesbor.blogspot.be/search/label/A%C3%B1o%20Coloma == See also == * Treaty of Barcelona * Alhambra Decree * Capitulations of Santa Fe == books== * Alfaro Lapuerta, Emilio: \u00abDon Juan de Coloma, caballero de Borja\u00bb; Fernando el Cat\u00f3lico y la Hispanidad, Zaragoza, 1952, pp. 37-50. * Gasc\u00f3n de Gotor, Anselmo: \u00abArag\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica: el Magn\u00edfico D.
