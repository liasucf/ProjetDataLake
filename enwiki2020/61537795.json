    "text": "A rugged smartphone is a smartphone which is completely sealed within a thick housing to protects it against damage from, among other things, water, shock, dust, and vibration. == List of rugged smartphones == * AGM X2 * AGM X3 * Doogee S60 *Doogee S90 * *Sonim XP7 *Doogee S40 *Doogee S70 * * Cat S41 *Cat S60 *Cat S61 * Ulefone Armor 2 == Classification == There are three general types of Rugged Phone: * Outdoor sports * Military * Stylish == Functional requirements == === Primary standard === IP56 - 5 dust level, 6 level waterproof, 1.5M drop, conventional vibration. === Intermediate standard === IP57 - 5 dust level, 7 level waterproof level, 3M drop, conventional vibration. === Advanced (professional) standards === IP68 - 6 dust level, 8 level waterproof, 5M drop, conventional vibration. IP69K - In the IEC 60529 rating system, IP6 refers to the product\u2019s ability to resist ingress of dust. The 69K refers to the product\u2019s ability to resist ingress of high temperature (steam) / high pressure water. If the device passes all these test then it can be considered as IP69K rated smartphone and can be used in harsh environments with high pressure / steam cleaning. === Testing procedure per ISO 20653 === \u2022 A spray nozzle that is fed with 80 \u00b0C water at 80\u2013100 bar (~1160-1450 psi) and a flow rate of 14\u201316 L/min. \u2022 The nozzle is held 10\u201315 cm from the tested device at angles of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0,60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 for 30 seconds each. \u2022 The test device places on a turntable that rotates once every 12 seconds. == MIL-STD-810G == MIL-STD-810G is a U.S. military specification that guarantees a level of durability for a piece of technology. Specifically, it means the equipment has gone through a series of 29 tests, including shock tests, vibration tests, and more. This means it should be field ready, or even \u201ccombat ready\u201d in principle. A lot of technology sold to the U.S. military must be MIL-STD-810G compliant. == See also == * Emerging technologies == References == Category:Smartphones Category:Consumer electronics Category:Information appliances ",
