    "text": "Kumeyaay traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Kumeyaay (Ipai, Tipai, Kamia, Diegue\u00f1o) people of southern California and northwestern Baja California. Kumeyaay oral literature is very similar to that of their Yuman relatives to the south and east, as well as to that of their Uto-Aztecan neighbors to the north. Particularly prominent are versions of the Southern California Creation Myth and of the long Flute Lure myth. (See also Traditional narratives (Native California).) ==On-Line Examples of Kumeyaay Narratives== * \"The Mythology of the Diegue\u00f1os\" by Constance Goddard DuBois (1901) * \"The Story of the Chaup\" by Constance Goddard DuBois (1904) * \"Mythology of the Mission Indians\" by Constance Goddard DuBois (1906) * \"Ceremonies and Traditions of the Diegue\u00f1o Indians\" by Constance Goddard DuBois (1908) * The North American Indian by Edward S.
