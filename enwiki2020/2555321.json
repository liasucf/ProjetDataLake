It was adopted by an Executive decree the 27th of January 1911. ==Lyrics in Spanish Language== Chorus Alto timbre de honor ostentamos de la patria en la invicta bandera; es de mayo la luz que surgiera al nosotross gritar \u00a1Libertad! I Una vez se pobl\u00f3 mi llanura con heroico tropel de guerreros que esgrim\u00edan sus limpios aceros de un deseo magn\u00e1nimo en pos. II Sus alforjas llen\u00e9, generosa e inmol\u00e9 mi reba\u00f1o, aquel d\u00eda, a esa hueste inmortal que emprend\u00eda la conquista del Templo del Sol. ==Lyrics in EnglishLanguage== Chorus High seal of honor we make flaunt of from the homeland in the invincible flag; it is from May the light that suggests when we shout Liberty! I Once my plains were populated with an heroic army of warriors that wielded their clean steels in pursuit of a magnanimous desire. II I filled their knapsacks, generously and immolated my herd, that day, to that troop that set up to conquer the Temple of the Sun. ==See also== * List of anthems of Venezuela Category:Anthems of Venezuela Category:Spanish-language songs Category:Year of song missing ",
