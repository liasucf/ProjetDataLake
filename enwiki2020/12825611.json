Of the other nine, excpting USS Hydra (AK-82), all were transferred within months or days of shipyard delivery to Navy to the Army. Hydra was transferred to Army shortly after commissioning and trials. Navy had assumed the administration of contracts for these ships from the Maritime Commission on 1 January 1943 during or before construction and thus most were only administratively Navy, including names and numbers, during construction. was never commissioned and thus never bore the USS designation.http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq63-1.htm | Navy History & Heritage Command - Ship Naming in the United States Navy The ship was transferred to the Army to become the Engineer Port Repair Ship Joe C.

The Army named her for Medal of Honor recipient Joe C. Specker of the 48th Engineer Combat Battalion. Unlike most port repair ships the Joe C.
