She was the second and final member of the , which were built as scouts for the main Italian fleet. She was equipped with a main battery of six guns and had a top speed in excess of , but her engines proved to be troublesome in service. Marsala spent World War I based at Brindisi; she was involved in the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917, where she briefly engaged Austro-Hungarian cruisers. Marsalas career was cut short in November 1927 when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap, the result of her unreliable engines and drastic cuts to the naval budget. ==Design== Line-drawing of Marsala Marsala was long at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full load. Her crew consisted 13 officers and 283 enlisted men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of three steam turbines, each driving a screw propeller. Steam was provided by fourteen mixed coal and oil firing Blechynden boilers. The engines were rated at for a top speed of . She had a range of at a cruising speed of .Gardiner & Gray, p. 263 Marsala was armed with a main battery of six L/50 guns mounted singly.L/50 refers to the length of the gun in terms of caliber. She was also equipped with six L/50 guns and two torpedo tubes. The ship was only lightly armored, with a thick deck, and thick plating on her main conning tower. ==Service history== Marsalas keel was laid down at the Castellammare shipyard on 15 February 1911, the same day as Nino Bixio. Work on Marsala proceeded slower than on her sister, and she was launched on 24 March 1912, where she was named for the city where Giuseppe Garibaldi launched the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 4 August 1914. Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers.Halpern A Naval History of World War I,, p. 140 Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern A Naval History of World War I,, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.Halpern A Naval History of World War I,, pp. 141-142 Marsala, Nino Bixio, and the cruiser were based at Brindisi during the war, where they could patrol the path from the narrow Adriatic to the Mediterranean.O'Hara, Dickson, & Worth, pp. 183-184 By May 1917, the reconnaissance forces at Brindisi had come under the command of Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton.Halpern The Battle of the Otranto Straits, p. 20 On the night of 14-15 May, the Austro-Hungarian cruisers Helgoland, , and and several destroyers raided the Otranto Barrage--a patrol line of drifters intended to block Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats.Halpern A Naval History of World War I, pp. 162-163 Marsala was the only Italian cruiser with steam up in her boilers when word of the Austro-Hungarian attack reached Brindisi.Halpern The Battle of the Otranto Straits, p. 50 The British cruisers and departed first, along with five Italian destroyers. Marsala, the flotilla leader , and three destroyers followed thereafter.Halpern A Naval History of World War I, p. 163 Marsala briefly engaged the fleeing Austro-Hungarians in the Battle of the Otranto Straits, before Acton broke off the pursuit and ordered a return to port.Halpern A Naval History of World War I, p. 165 Following the end of the war in November 1918, the Regia Marina demobilized; severely reduced naval budgets--the result of a weakened Italian economy in the early 1920s--led to further draw-downs.Gardiner & Gray, p. 254Goldstein & Maurer, p. 225 Marsalas engines were plagued with problems throughout her career, which made the ship an obvious target in the effort to trim the Regia Marinas budget. She was stricken from the naval register on 27 November 1927 and subsequently broken up for scrap. ==Footnotes== ;Notes ;Citations ==References== * * * * * Category:Nino Bixio-class cruisers ",
