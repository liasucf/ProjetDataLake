    "text": "Jane English (was born 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts) is a philosopher, physicist, photographer, journalist and translator. English received her B.A. in Physics from Mount Holyoke College in 1964 and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison for her work in high energy particle physics. She taught courses in Oriental thought and modern physics at Colorado College. English is known for her collaborative translation of the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tsu which she illustrated through photography, in collaboration with her spouse Gia-Fu Feng. ==Philosophy== English is the best-known proponent of the \"friendship theory\" in the philosophy of filial obligation.https://www.iep.utm.edu/fil- obli/#H3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7cOwQQDI7o This is the view that we do not, contrary to popular opinion, owe our parents anything simply by virtue of being raised by them, because they made a choice to have us as children and all the effects of this choice should have been considered by them: they are merely fulfilling their immediate decision by raising us. We were unable to enter into any contract with our parents when we were being conceived, and so the decision is entirely theirs. English models a perspective that states that parents should be like friends to us: people that we choose to have a relationship with without any obligation. However, if we do not wish to be friends with them, then this is our choice and we are perfectly justified in choosing thus if we so wish. == Bibliography == * \"A Rainbow of Tao\" (Earth Heart 2018) * \"The Ceremony Cards:A Living Introduction to the Traditional Teachings of the Far North from Greenland\" (Earth Heart 2014'' * \"Lao Tsu - Tao Te Ching\" in collaboration with Gia-Fu Feng (Random House 1972 and 2011) * \"Chuang Tsu - Inner Chapters\" in collaboration with Gia-Fu Feng (Random House 1974, Earth Heart 1997, Amber Lotus 2000, Hay House 2014) * Co-editor with Ben English, Jr. of \"Our Mountain Trips, Parts I & II\" (Bondcliff Books 2005 & 2007) * \"Different Doorway: Adventures of a Caesarean Born\" (Earth Heart 1985) * Illustrated \"Waterchild\" (Hunter House, 1980).
