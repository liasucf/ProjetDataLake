    "text": "Stanstead is a township municipality of about 1,000 people in the Memphr\u00e9magog Regional County Municipality in the Estrie region of Quebec. It is not to be confused with the city of Stanstead, which is nearby although not directly adjacent (the municipality of Ogden lies in between). Formally, the township consists of two villages: Fitch Bay (founded in 1855) and Georgeville (founded in the 1890s). Both villages formed as a result of English-speaking migrants from the United States state of Vermont until borderline customs stations were established after 1920. Today, the population is bilingual with predominance in French language (about 57%). == See also == * List of township municipalities in Quebec ==References== ==External links== * Category:Township municipalities in Quebec Category:Incorporated places in Estrie ",
