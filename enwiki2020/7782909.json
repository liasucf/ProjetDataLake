    "text": "\"Monsieur\" was Luxembourg's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1989. It was performed in French by Park Caf\u00e9, a six-piece band fronted by the American singer Maggie Parke. The song is an up-tempo number, with the lead singer describing a man who \"lives in a dream\" (or even \"in Tooneland\", according to the backing vocals) and believes that he will make it big in Hollywood. She sings, further, that \"I believe/that I'm his star\", seemingly regardless of the success he might enjoy. The song was performed eleventh on the night, following Sweden's Tommy Nilsson with \"En dag\" and preceding Denmark's Birthe Kj\u00e6r with \"Vi maler byen r\u00f8d\". At the close of voting, it had received eight points, placing it 20th in a field of 22. It was succeeded as Luxembourg's entry in the 1990 Contest by C\u00e9line Carzo with \"Quand je te r\u00eave\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1989 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"Monsieur\".
