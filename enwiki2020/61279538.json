In 1984, his friend Gerardo Velez, Fern\u00e1ndez's collaborator on various projects and the percussionist for Spyro Gyra at that time, told him the band was looking for a new guitarist. Fern\u00e1ndez auditioned and was hired the next day\u2014an event he described as \"one of the happiest days of my life.\" Except for a short hiatus at the end of that decade, Fernandez has continued in that position.
