    "text": "The American Samoa women's national under-20 football team is the highest women's youth team of women's football in American Samoa and is controlled by the Football Federation American Samoa (FFAS). ==History== American Samoa is known as one of the worst football teams in the world. In that perspective their debut at the OFC U-20 Women's Championship was quite good. They made their debut in 2002 at the first tournament ever held. They managed to draw two times with only one loss: just 2-0 against giants New Zealand. The team managed to score two goals in their 2-2 draw against Samoa. They ended up 3 out of 4 in the group, above Fiji. Eight years later, in 2010, the team struggled a whole lot more. They lost all their three games: two 4-0 defeats against Tonga and the Cook Islands and an 8-0 defeat against New Zealand. After two tournaments the American Samoa team has never won and just scored two goals. However they will participate again in 2019. ==OFC Championship Record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=10|OFC U-20 Women's Championship |- !width=80 |Year !width=120 |Round !width=60 | !width=60 | !width=60 | !width=60 | !width=60 | !width=60 | !width=60 | !width=60 | |-bgcolor= | 2002||Group Stage||3||0||2||1||2||4||-2||2 |-bgcolor= | 2004||Did not Participate|||||||||||||||| '''''' |-bgcolor= | 2006||Did not Participate|||||||||||||||| '''''' |-bgcolor= | 2010||Fourth Place||3||0||0||3||0||16||-16||0 |-bgcolor= | 2012||Did not Participate|||||||||||||||| '''''' |-bgcolor= | 2014||Did not Participate|||||||||||||||| '''''' |-bgcolor= | 2015||Did not Participate|||||||||||||||| '''''' |-bgcolor= | 2017||Did not Participate|||||||||||||||| '''''' |- | 2019||Group Stage||3||1||0||2||3||21||-18||3 |- |Total||0 Titles||9||1||2||6||5||41||-36||5 |- |} ==Current squad== The following players were called up for the 2019 OFC U-19 Women's Championship from 30 August \u2013 12 September in Avarua, Cook Islands.
