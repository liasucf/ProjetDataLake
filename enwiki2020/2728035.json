    "text": "In mathematics and theoretical physics, resummation is a procedure to obtain a finite result from a divergent sum (series) of functions. Resummation involves a definition of another (convergent) function in which the individual terms defining the original function are re-scaled, and an integral transformation of this new function to obtain the original function. Borel resummation is probably the most well-known example. The simplest method is an extension of a variational approach to higher order based on a paper by R.P. Feynman and H. Kleinert. In quantum mechanics it was extended to any order here, and in quantum field theory here. Kleinert, H., \"Critical exponents from seven-loop strong-coupling \u03c64 theory in three dimensions\".
