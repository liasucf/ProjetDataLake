    "text": "Princeton Junction (signed as Princeton Junction at West Windsor) is a railroad station in Princeton Junction, New Jersey, located in West Windsor Township. It serves NJ Transit (NJT) and Amtrak on the Northeast Corridor (NEC), and NJ Transit on the Princeton Branch. ==History== Amtrak Metroliner passing through the station in 1978 Station signs include the name of the township, West Windsor Princeton Junction's origins can be traced back to the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company, the predecessor of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the 19th century. The original station was built in 1864, in preparation for Princeton Branch service to begin in 1865. Albert Einstein, who lived at 112 Mercer Street in Princeton, used to enjoy sitting at the station and watching the trains go by. More than once, he employed trains to explain the practical effects of his General Theory of Relativity. In 1965, a prototype for the high-speed Metroliner passed through the station at the record speed (at that time) of on a short demonstration run. Very few sections of the Northeast Corridor were capable of handling that speed, and most had to be upgraded before Penn Central's Metroliner service was introduced in 1969. A speed of was achieved on the same portion of track on December 20, 1967, when the U.S.-built UAC TurboTrain set the rail speed record in North America. A plaque at the station commemorates the event. The present station house was built in 1987. Most of Amtrak's Princeton Junction service prior to 2005 was Clocker service commuter traffic to New York, Newark, or Philadelphia. On October 28, 2005, the Clockers were replaced by NJT trains that run only as far south as Trenton. ===Transit village=== Princeton Junction has been designated the core of the West Windsor transit village, a smart growth initiative to promote transit-oriented development which can include government incentives to encourage compact, higher density, mixed-use development within walking distance of the station. Development adjacent to the station permits higher densities and will include retail end entertainment elements. ==Service== Princeton Branch \"Dinky\" in 1971 As of 2017, Princeton Junction was the 6th-busiest station in the NJ Transit rail system, with an average of 6,817 weekday boardings. In addition to the Northeast Corridor Line, NJT operates a spur line, the Princeton Branch, to Princeton station located at the Princeton University campus in Princeton. The shuttle is colloquially known as the \"Dinky\", and has also been known as the \"PJ&B;\" (for \"Princeton Junction and Back\"). Two train cars, or sometimes just one, are used. A single switch connects the branch to the Northeast Corridor tracks north of the station. Service on the Princeton Branch was suspended from October 14, 2018 through May 11, 2019, replaced by shuttle buses, as part of NJT's systemwide service reductions during the installation and testing of positive train control. Amtrak provides two early-morning trains to Washington, D.C., and two evening returns, as well as one morning train to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and one evening return, all of which call at Philadelphia. Many more Amtrak trains stop at the nearby Trenton Transit Center. Until 2007, all Amtrak Pennsylvanian trains stopped at Princeton Junction. The southbound Amtrak Palmetto began stopping in Princeton Junction in October 2015. The Central Jersey Route 1 Corridor BRT is a proposed bus rapid transit system which would use Princeton Junction as its hub. ==Station layout== The station has two high-level side platforms. Most of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor lines bypass the station via the inner tracks, except for select Keystone and Northeast Regional trains and the weekday westbound Palmetto. The next northbound station is , but all northbound trains originating in Trenton skip this station and service , with other trains originating at Jersey Avenue. {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=8 width=75|P Platform level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Shuttle |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward (Terminus) termination track \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the left or right |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |- |Track 4 |\u2190 toward () \u2190 limited service toward Northern Virginia (Trenton) \u2190 limited service toward () \u2190 weekday service toward (Trenton) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 services do not stop here |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 2 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| services do not stop here \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| limited service toward New York () \u2192 limited service toward Boston (New Brunswick) \u2192 toward New York (New Brunswick) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|G |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|Station building, parking, buses |} ==References== == External links == *West Windsor Parking Authority *Princeton Junction Amtrak & New Jersey Transit Station (USA RailGuide \u2013 TrainWeb) *Princeton Junction, NJ - Great American Stations *Station from Google Maps Street View Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations Category:Stations on the Northeast Corridor Category:Amtrak stations in New Jersey Category:Railway stations in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Rail junctions in the United States Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1864 Category:West Windsor Township, New Jersey Category:Stations on the Princeton Branch Category:Former Pennsylvania Railroad stations ",
