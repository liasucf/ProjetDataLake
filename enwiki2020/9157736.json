He was a member of the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in 2013,Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars where he was invited to join the Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics.IAS school of mathematics: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics == Research == He discovered Kripke\u2013Joyal semantics,Robert Goldblatt, A Kripke-Joyal semantics for noncommutative logic in quantales; Advances in Modal Logic 6, 209--225, Coll. Publ., London, 2006; the theory of combinatorial species and with Myles Tierney a generalization of the Galois theory of Alexander GrothendieckA. Joyal, M. Tierney, An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck, Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society 51 (1984), no. 309, vii+71 pp. in the setup of locales. Most of his research is in some way related to category theory, higher category theory and their applications. He did some work on quasi-categories, after their invention by Michael Boardman and Rainer Vogt, in particular conjecturingA. Joyal, A letter to Grothendieck, April 1983 (contains a Quillen model structure on simplicial presheaves) and proving the existence of a Quillen model structure on sSet whose weak equivalences generalize both equivalence of categories and Kan equivalence of spaces. He co-authored the book \"Algebraic Set Theory\" with Ieke Moerdijk and recently started a web-based expositional project Joyal's CatLab Joyal's CatLab on categorical mathematics. == Personal life == Joyal was born in Drummondville (formerly Saint-Majorique). He has three children and lives in Montreal. ==Bibliography== * Andr\u00e9 Joyal, Myles Tierney, An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck, Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society 51 (1984), no. 309. * Andr\u00e9 Joyal, Quasi-categories and Kan complexes, (in Special volume celebrating the 70th birthday of Prof. Max Kelly) J.
