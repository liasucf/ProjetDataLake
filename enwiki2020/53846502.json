Mainard made donations to the monastery of San Solutore in Turin and the house of canons at San Lorenzo in Oulx in Turin. Alongside Margrave Boniface del Vasto, Mainard tried unsuccessfully to settle a long-running dispute between the monastery of San Pietro in Turin and the sons of Viscount Vitelmo-Bruno of Baratonia (located c.21 km north-west of the city of Turin).G. Colombo and A. Leone, eds., Documenti di Scarnafigi (Pinerolo, 1906), Appendix, no. 5. The dispute was about the control of tithes in Scarnafigi. ==References== *F.
