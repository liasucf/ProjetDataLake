    "text": "The Patriot is a fireboat operated in Tampa, Florida from 2009 to 2015. The vessel cost $3.8 million. She was built in Kingston, Ontario. She is long, and displaces 52 tonnes. The vessel was paid for through a FEMA Port Security Grant. So, in addition to being able to fight fires, her cabin is sealed, so she can respond to chemical, biological or radiological threats. According to WFLA she has not been put into use since 2015, when her engines became fouled by barnacles. She is propelled by waterjets. WFLA reported fire officials were criticized that her high tech propulsion system had to be hauled out the barnacle infested water, when not it use. ==References== Category:Fireboats of the United States ",
