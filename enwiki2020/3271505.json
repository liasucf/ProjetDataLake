Each representative represents a district of at least 172,000 people. The House convenes in the legislative chambers at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix. The next election will happen on November 3, 2020. ==Leadership of the House== The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus along with the Majority Leader, the Assistant Majority Leader, and the Majority Whip.
