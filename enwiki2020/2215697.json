Lavinia Mary Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk (n\u00e9e Strutt; 22 March 1916 \u2013 10 December 1995) was a British noblewoman. ==Life== Born Lavinia Mary Strutt, she was the only daughter of Algernon Strutt, 3rd Baron Belper, and his wife, Eva. She was educated at Abbot's Hill School. On 27 January 1937, she married Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk at the Brompton Oratory. She did not convert to Roman Catholicism, her husband's religion. They had four daughters, only one (the youngest) of whom has children: * Lady Anne Fitzalan-Howard, later 14th Lady Herries of Terregles (1938\u20132014); married Colin Cowdrey, Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge * Lady Mary Fitzalan-Howard, later 15th Lady Herries of Terregles (1940\u20132017); married Anthony Mumford * Lady Sarah Fitzalan-Howard (1941\u20132015); married Nigel Clutton * Lady Theresa Fitzalan-Howard, later 16th Lady Herries of Terregles (b. 1945); married Michael Kerr, 13th Marquess of Lothian At the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, the Duchess of Norfolk was one of four duchesses who held the canopy above Queen Elizabeth during the latter's anointing. In 1953, she took the part of Queen Elizabeth II during dress rehearsals for the coronation at Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Norfolk was hereditary Earl Marshal, and organised both coronations as well as important state events in later years. ===Charities=== The Duchess was involved with many charities and was appointed a CBE in 1971 for her work. Among firsts for women, she was the first woman Lord Lieutenant as Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex from 1975 (a post she took over from her husband after his death that year), first woman steward of Goodwood from 1975 and the first non-royal Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter. The Duchess was Princess Anne's predecessor in the presidency of the Riding for the Disabled Association. The presidency passed from the Duchess to the Princess in 1986. ===Sport=== For many years, the traditional curtain-raiser to the English international cricket season was a match between Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI and the visitors, played at Arundel Castle. It played on in the Duchess' name after the Duke's death in 1975, reverting to its original name after her own death in 1995. The Duchess was an owner of racehorses: her best winners included Moon Madness, Sheriff's Star and Lucky Moon (Goodwood Cup). ==References== ==External links== *Entry at ThePeerage.com Category:1916 births Category:1995 deaths Lavinia Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Daughters of barons Category:Ladies of the Garter Category:Lord-Lieutenants of West Sussex ",
