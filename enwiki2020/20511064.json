    "text": "Jonathan Kahne T\u00e9hou\u00e9 (born 3 May 1984) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is known as a super-sub amongst Leyton Orient fans, having scored nine goals after the 85th minute of various matches since he joined the club. ==Club career== T\u00e9hou\u00e9 was born in Paris. He previously played for SC Bastia in France, APOEL in Cyprus, R.E. Virton and FC Brussels in Belgium. He transferred to Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa S.K. in August 2007 and moved to Konyaspor in February 2008. ===Huddersfield Town=== After a successful trial, English Football League One club Huddersfield Town signed him subject to international clearance on 2 February 2009, but, because of a contractual dispute between T\u00e9hou\u00e9 and Konyaspor, this was not forthcoming. FIFA became involved, but no decision was reached in time for the deal to be completed in the 2008\u201309 season. ===Leyton Orient=== Upon leaving Konyaspor, T\u00e9hou\u00e9 had a short spell with French side UJA Alfortville. On 12 January 2010, he was signed by League One club Leyton Orient on a short-term contract until the end of the 2009\u201310 season after impressing on a trial with the club.O's Complete Tehoue Transfer On 2 February 2010, T\u00e9hou\u00e9 scored his first goal in English football, converting Sean Thornton's cross from close range to score the fifth in Orient's 5\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers. On 12 March 2010, he signed a 2\u00bd-year deal with the club which would keep him at The O's until 2012. T\u00e9hou\u00e9 scored his first goal of the 2010\u201311 season against Hartlepool United on 16 October 2010, smashing home from six yards in the 89th minute to earn the O's a 1\u20130 victory. On 7 December 2010, T\u00e9hou\u00e9 scored a late equaliser in the FA Cup Second Round against Droylsden and went on to complete a hat-trick in extra- time. His teammate Scott McGleish also achieved a hat-trick in extra-time, ultimately guiding Orient to an 8\u20132 victory and a place in the third round. On 20 February 2011, T\u00e9hou\u00e9 came off the bench to score the late equaliser in Orient's fifth round 1\u20131 draw against Arsenal to earn Leyton Orient a replay at the Emirates Stadium. After four months out with a broken wrist, Tehoue made his comeback with two goals in his first two games, coming on as a substitute to score in the 74th minute to round off a 3-0 win against Exeter before netting Orient's second against Notts County in the 85th minute (again as a sub). ===Swindon Town=== On 7 March 2012, T\u00e9hou\u00e9 went on loan to Swindon Town until the end of the season, stating that he did not get on well with Orient manager Russell Slade, and that he hoped to stay at Swindon and score against Orient in League One the following season. However, after one start and two substitute appearances for the Robins, manager Paolo Di Canio said that T\u00e9hou\u00e9 would not play for the club again, claiming, \"He's not as good as I thought he was.\" ==Personal life== Contrary to reports, T\u00e9hou\u00e9 is not related to former Arsenal defender Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9. T\u00e9hou\u00e9 has confirmed that they are just good friends and share Ivorian heritage. He is also friends with the many French players in the Arsenal squad, such as Abou Diaby, and has known Alex Song since they played together at SC Bastia. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:French footballers Category:Footballers from Paris Category:Association football forwards Category:Stade Malherbe Caen players Category:SC Bastia players Category:APOEL FC players Category:R.E.
