The library is at Kurilpa Point, within the Queensland Cultural Centre on the Brisbane River at South Bank. == History == The Brisbane Public Library was established by the government of the Colony of Queensland in 1896, and was renamed the Public Library of Queensland in 1898. The library was opened to the public in 1902. In 1934, the Oxley Memorial Library (now the John Oxley Library),John Oxley Library . State Library of Queensland. Retrieved 14 June 2019. named for the explorer John Oxley, opened as a centre for research and study relating specifically to Queensland. The Libraries Act of 1943 established the Library Board of Queensland to manage the Public Library of Queensland; three years later, under the terms of The Oxley Memorial Library of Queensland Act, it took over management of the Oxley Memorial Library as well. The old State Library with extension, built in the late 1950s In March 1947, James L. Stapleton was appointed Queensland's first State Librarian. Stapleton advocated for a new building for the library and that library services should be free to the public. He remains the longest-serving CEO, and has been followed by five others: Sydney Lawrence (Lawrie) Ryan from 1970 to 1988, Des Stephens from 1988 to 2001, Lea Giles-Peters (the first woman to be appointed to the position) from 2001 to 2011, Janette Wright, from 2012-2015 and from 2016, Vicki McDonald. In 1971, the \"Public Library\" became the \"State Library.\" The following year, the Public Library Service was established to liaise with Queensland local authorities regarding their public libraries; a subsidy for employing qualified staff in public libraries was also established. A few years later the Country Lending Service was established to provide book exchange and other services to public libraries in Queensland's smaller local government areas. Under the new name of Rural Libraries Queensland, the service is still going strong today, administered by the State Library's Public and Indigenous Library Services program. In 2003, the State Library began a new mission of establishing Indigenous Knowledge Centres (IKCs) in the Cape York and Torres Strait areas. There is now a network of 22 IKCs in remote and regional communities: across Cape York, the islands of the Torres Strait, Central Queensland and at Cherbourg in South East Queensland.Indigenous Knowledge Centres .

This building had formerly been occupied by the Queensland Museum. The Library originally shared accommodation in the building with an art gallery. In the late 1950s, an extension, with a distinctive tiled mural on the exterior, was built onto the building to provide more space. The mural was the winning design in a national competition held in 1958. In 1988, the State Library of Queensland moved to a new home within the Queensland Cultural Centre at South Bank, near the Queensland Museum and the original Queensland Art Gallery. In 2004, work began on the Millennium Library Project - a major redevelopment of the existing State Library building. After three years of extensive redevelopment, the South Bank building officially re-opened on 25 November 2006 as \"a new cultural and knowledge destination\" and a fitting showcase for the collections. New services include the kuril dhagun Indigenous Knowledge Centre, and The Corner, an activities area for children under 8, their parents, carers, educators and friends. The newly-redeveloped building was designed by Brisbane-based architecture firms Donovan Hill and Peddle Thorp. Their work earned them the prestigious RAIA Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 2007 (award for best public building in Australia),2007 RAIA National Architecture Awards: Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture: State Library of Queensland Architecture Australia Vol 96 No 6 Nov/Dec 2007 pp 74\u201375 the RAIA Emil Sodersten Award for Interior Architecture, 2007,2007 RAIA National Architecture Awards: Emil Sodersten Award for Interior Architecture: Architecture Australia Vol 96 No 6 Nov/Dec 2007 pp 86\u201387 the RAIA Queensland Architecture Award for Brisbane Building of the Year 2007, the RAIA FDG Stanley Award for Public Buildings Architecture 2007 and the AIB Queensland Awards - Project of the Year + Sustainability Commendation 2007.
