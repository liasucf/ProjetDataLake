It was named for Howard Douglas (1850-1929), a park superintendent credited with greatly expanding its size. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1958 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Bourgeau, to the north-northwest. __NOTOC__ ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Howard Douglas is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Howard Douglas is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below -30 \u00b0C.
