Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of \"talk[ing] down\" to young black men about their style of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, \"Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches.\" When the audience responded to Buress's accusation with incredulity, (Philadelphia being Cosby\u2019s home town,) he encouraged everyone to search for \"Bill Cosby rape\" on Google when they got home. Buress had been doing the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his set, a \"Teflon image\" despite more than a decade of public sexual-abuse accusations. Comedian Eddie Murphy later referenced Buress's role in the allegations coming to light while impersonating Cosby during his 2015 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor acceptance speech, mockingly playing Cosby as threatening Buress' life. ==Personal life== Buress is an atheist. After living in New York City, he moved back to his hometown of Chicago in 2017 and settled in its Wicker Park neighborhood. In December 2017, Buress was arrested in Miami for disorderly intoxication. Bystander footage of the arrest showed Buress mocking the police officers and demanding to know why he was being arrested. The arrest report revealed that Buress was detained because he approached the police officers and would not stop asking them to call an Uber for him. Buress later stated, \"I asked the [officer] to call me an Uber, and he said, 'No.' He told me to leave the street. I go into this bar to get a phone charger for an Uber. He follows me into the bar, and told me I'm too drunk to go inside. [...] 'If I can't be on the street, where do you want me to be?' I ask him. I was in a state of trying to get home. [...] I don't really believe I was at fault.\" The case was later dismissed. The Miami New Times reported that the arresting officer has an alleged history of violence and was previously disciplined by internal affairs for an alcohol- fueled assault. This report was cited by Buress as part of a televised stand- up routine at the Olympia Theater in Miami in August 2019. Buress quit drinking after the incident, saying that he wants to \"end the messy shit.\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw434j/hannibal-buress-on-quitting- drinking-to-end-the-messy-shit ==Filmography== === Film === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
