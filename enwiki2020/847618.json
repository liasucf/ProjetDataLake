Starting with his 1999 debut album Who Needs Pictures, he has released eleven studio albums and a Christmas compilation on the Arista Nashville label, with all of his albums certified Gold or higher by the RIAA. He has scored 32 Top 10 singles on the US Billboard Country Airplay chart, 19 of which have reached number 1.

He is the only child of Douglas Edward \"Doug\" Paisley, who worked for the West Virginia Department of Transportation, and Sandra Jean \"Sandy\" (n\u00e9e Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher. He has stated that his love of country music stems from his maternal grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a Sears Danelectro Silvertone,\"Biography Today\", pp. 128 and taught him how to play at eight years old. In third grade, he performed for the first time in public by singing in his church. Initially, they were just going to have him play the song on the guitar instead of a piano. But then the adults heard him sing the tune and said, \"forget the choir, let's just have Brad do the whole thing.\" After that, he never had to ask for a gig until he left Glen Dale. He later recalled that \"Pretty soon, I was performing at every Christmas party and Mother's Day event. The neat thing about a small town is that when you want to be an artist, by golly, they'll make you one.\" At age 13, he wrote his first song, \"Born on Christmas Day\", which later appeared on his album Brad Paisley Christmas. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence \"Hank\" Goddard. By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called \"Brad Paisley and the C-Notes\", with the addition of two of Paisley's adult friends. While in junior high, his principal heard him perform \"Born On Christmas Day\" and invited him to play at the local Rotary Club meeting. In attendance was Tom Miller, the program director of a radio station in Wheeling, West Virginia. Miller asked him if he would like to be a guest on Jamboree USA. After his first performance, he was asked to become a member of the show's weekly lineup. For the next eight years, he opened for country singers such as The Judds, Ricky Skaggs and George Jones. He would become the youngest person inducted into the Jamboree USA Hall of Fame.

Paisley performing live in Providence, Rhode Island, September 27, 2008 Paisley and Kimberly Williams began dating in 2001. The singer had first seen the actress 10 years earlier in her feature film debut while on a date to see Father of the Bride with a local girl. Four years later, and after his date left him for his best friend, he went to see the sequel alone. Paisley stated that he watched Williams' performance and thought \"She seems like a great girl \u2014 smart and funny and all those things that are so hard to find.\" Paisley's sophomore album, Part II, featured several songs he'd written about the old girlfriend, including one about going to see Father of the Bride. When it came time to cast the music video for \"I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song),\" Paisley said, \"It felt natural to ask [Williams, the girl from the movie] to be in it.\" The two began dating soon after and were married on March 15, 2003, at Stauffer Chapel on the campus of Pepperdine University after a nine-month engagement. They live in Franklin, Tennessee, and had another home in Pacific Palisades that was sold in 2013. Paisley and Williams' first son, William Huckleberry, or \"Huck\", was born on February 22, 2007, in Nashville. Their second son, Jasper Warren (named after his grandfather, who bought Paisley his first guitar), was born on April 17, 2009. ===Hobbies and other interests=== Paisley is an active Freemason, a member of Hiram Lodge #7 in Franklin, Tennessee. Paisley is a member of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and a Noble of the AAONMS, also known as Shriners. He was accompanied by his father, Doug Paisley (33\u00ba), for the ceremony on October 28, 2006, and has done a number of recordings supporting the virtues of Freemasonry and DeMolay International. He is also a lifelong fan of the Cleveland Browns and Los Angeles Dodgers. Paisley sang the National Anthem at Dodgers Stadium before Game 2 of the Dodgers vs Astros World Series in 2017, and again before Game 3 of the 2018 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. Paisley also sang the national anthem before a game during the 1999 season, and stated in an interview with ESPN his dream job would be to play football for them. He also invited former Browns Quarterback Brady Quinn to a concert at the Blossom Music Center, in 2008. Paisley is also a fan of West Virginia athletics. In 2014, Paisley appeared as a celebrity guest picker on the popular ESPN show College Gameday, when it was held on the campus of West Virginia University. In late 2009, it was announced in Variety that Paisley would enter the world of scripted television as an executive producer of a new hour-long drama series for The CW network called, appropriately, Nashville. The plot was written and created by Neal Dodson and actor Matt Bomer. The creator of the series One Tree Hill, Mark Schwahn directed the pilot and was to oversee the series had it been picked up. Actor Zachary Quinto was also an executive producer on the series, along with Dodson, Bomer, and Corey Moosa. The pilot was not picked up for a series when The CW's fall schedule was announced in May 2010. The CW project was completely unrelated to the ABC/CMT series, of the same name, even though his wife had a recurring role in it, and he had two cameo appearances himself. ==Instruments== Paisley with his blue Fender Telecaster Paisley's first guitar, a gift from his grandfather, was a Silvertone Danelectro 1451, which came with an \"amp-in-case\". His next guitar, which he got at the age of 10 or 11, also from his grandfather, was a Sekova copy of a Gibson ES-335, with a Fender Deluxe Reverb. The instrument most often associated with him is a 1968 Pink Paisley Fender Telecaster. Brad's main guitars are Crook Custom Guitars. These guitars are designed by Bill Crook and feature the paisley wallpaper in a variety of colors. Like many Nashville-based musicians, he lost a number of instruments and other gear in the 2010 flood in Nashville, including a 1970s Gibson Les Paul and the prototype for a Z Wreck, one of the signature Paisley Dr. Z amplifiers. The insurance money, however, allowed him to buy (from George Gruhn's store) an exclusive 1937 herringbone Martin D-28. In 2010, Paisley and Wampler Pedals released the Brad Paisley signature Paisley Drive, a guitar overdrive pedal designed to his specifications. Paisley has also used Audiotech Guitar Products ABY Selector's for controlling his wireless receiver units. In 2015 Santa Cruz Guitar Company introduced the Brad Paisley Signature Model, B/PW, acoustic dreadnought guitar. Paisley is often seen playing this model of guitar, such as in the 2017 Netflix original Brad Paisley's Comedy Rodeo. In 2016 Paisley and Dr. Z Amplification collaborated and released the DB4 model. The name DB4 is thus named because it is \"Doc & Brad's fourth amp design\".
