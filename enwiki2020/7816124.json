    "text": "Plymouth Adventure is a 1952 Technicolor drama film with an ensemble cast starring Spencer Tracy, Gene Tierney, Van Johnson and Leo Genn, made by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer,Variety film review; October 22, 1952, page 6.Harrison's Reports film review; October 25, 1952, page 170. directed by Clarence Brown, and produced by Dore Schary. The screenplay was adapted by Helen Deutsch from the novel The Plymouth Adventure by Ernest G\u00e9bler. The supporting cast includes Barry Jones, Dawn Addams, Lloyd Bridges and John Dehner. The film was veteran director Brown's final one. ==Plot== The film tells a fictionalized version of the Pilgrims' voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to North America aboard the Mayflower. During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones (Spencer Tracy) falls in love with Dorothy Bradford (Gene Tierney), the wife of William Bradford (Leo Genn). The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion. Ship's carpenter John Alden (Van Johnson)\u2014said to be the first person to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620\u2014catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins (Dawn Addams), one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford. Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish (Noel Drayton). Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the first to see land. Keep me eye peeled, I will. Then I\u2019ll be the first. It\u2019ll be like the Garden of Eden and I\u2019m going to be the first to see it\u201d. ==Cast== * Spencer Tracy as Christopher Jones * Gene Tierney as Dorothy Bradford * Van Johnson as John Alden * Leo Genn as William Bradford * Barry Jones as William Brewster * Dawn Addams as Priscilla Mullins * Lloyd Bridges as First Mate Coppin * Noel Drayton as Miles Standish * John Dehner as Gilbert Winslow * Tommy Ivo as William Button * Lowell Gilmore as Edward Winslow * Paul Cavanagh as Governor John Carver (uncredited) * Don Dillaway as Stephen Hopkins (uncredited) * Elizabeth Flournoy as Rose Standish (uncredited) * Ivis Goulding as Alice Mullins (uncredited) * Harvey M.

The pilgrims had to be tough and lusty to accomplish what they did. So that's the kind we cast in the film.\"Hopper, H. (1952, Jul 27). MAN WITH A MISSION! Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/178268967 ==Reception== According to MGM records, the film earned $1,909,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,116,000 elsewhere; but, because of its high cost, ended up incurring a loss of $1,856,000. Paul Mavis, reviewing Warner Archive's release of Plymouth Adventure for Movies & Drinks, wrote, \"Plymouth Adventure doesn\u2019t provide much more than a Classics Illustrated view of the Pilgrims\u2019 theology or psychology. However, the color-soaked, detail-rich production design, composer Miklos Rozsa\u2019s beautiful, powerful score, and a few ripe turns from the familiar cast\u2014along with that meticulous, action-filled voyage and sea storm middle section\u2014all converge to give us first, a reasonably entertaining sea epic, and second, a tantalizing (if fanciful) primer on a seminal story from our shared past\" ==Awards and honors== The picture won the Oscar for Best Effects. The actual model of the Mayflower ship from the movie is on display at the Original Benjamin's Calabash Seafood restaurant in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The model was purchased in an auction in the mid 1980s. ==See also== * Plymouth Colony * List of passengers on the Mayflower ==References== Notes ==External links== * * * * Category:1952 films Category:1950s historical films Category:American historical films Category:American films Category:Films based on actual events Category:Films based on Irish novels Category:Films directed by Clarence Brown Category:Films set in the 1620s Category:Films set in Massachusetts Category:Films set in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Films set in England Category:Films that won the Best Visual Effects Academy Award Category:Mayflower Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Sea adventure films Category:Films scored by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa ",
