    "text": "Voodoo Tiki tequilas Voodoo Tiki is a brand of tequila, produced by Voodoo Tiki Tequila Corporation, made of 100% blue agave, and available in the US other several other Countries including, Canada, The Caribbean, Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands. ==Production== Voodoo Tiki Tequila is 100% Weber blue agave tequila distilled in the small Mexican town of Capilla de Guadalupe in the Coraz\u00f3n de Los Altos (highlands) region of Jalisco, Mexico. While all tequilas are derived from the agave plant, Coraz\u00f3n de Los Altos is known for producing top-quality agave which is allowed to grow for 10\u201312 years. Once harvested the pinas (the large \"heart\" of the plant) are steamed slowly in hornos (traditional ovens) for 50\u201372 hours, until the desired sweet agave flavor is reached. The baked agave is pressed to release its juices, which are then fermented, distilled twice and barreled as tequila. Voodoo Tiki's production is based on the model used by boutique wineries, focusing on smaller quantities of handmade product that are made using high-quality ingredients and marketed to connoisseurs. Voodoo Tiki produces three main types of tequila: Platinum Silver (blanco), Reposado and A\u00f1ejo. A\u00f1ejo (Aged) \u2013 this tequila is aged for a minimum of one year in white oak casks. The tequila takes on the properties of the oak casks, lending it a unique flavor. Reposado (Rested) \u2013 A silver (blanco) tequila that has been kept in white oak casks for a minimum of two months, and a maximum of one year. Platinum Silver (Blanco) This is clear, transparent tequila that has been bottled immediately after distillation. It remains true to the flavor of blue agave, is strong and traditionally drunk in a caballito \u2013 a small, narrow shotglass. Voodoo Tiki also produces an A\u00f1ejo Three Years, a tequila that has been aged for at least three years and which is available in limited quantities (only 1,000 cases a year are produced). Extra-a\u00f1ejo tequilas (aged three years or more) are a new type of tequila allowed by the CRT: the Mexican Tequila Regulatory Council, since 2006. Infused Tequilas There are also a series of flavor infused tequilas, including Blue Dragon (kiwi-infused), Green Dragon (lime-infused) and Desert Rose (prickly pear-infused). Flavored, or infused, tequilas have been allowed by the CRT: the Mexican Tequila Regulatory Council, since 2006. Voodoo Tiki is sold in colorful glass bottles which are handmade by Mexican glass artist Alejandro Nuramo. Each bottle contains a glass Tiki; are signed and numbered for authenticity; and are labeled with 1 of 100 possible \"magic words\". ==Management and distribution== The product line was developed in 2001 by writer-director John Taddeo. The company's CEO and President is Donna DeCunzo-Taddeo, former EDiets.com co-creator and dietitian. In April 2008, a group of about 25 on the Blue Agave Forum tour visited the distillery during their week-long exploration of the tequila industry. These tours continue every year. ==External links== *Voodoo Tiki official website Category:Tequila ",
