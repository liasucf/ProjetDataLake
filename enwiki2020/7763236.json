Eugen Steinach (28 January 1861 \u2013 14 May 1944) was an Austrian physiologist and pioneer in endocrinology. ==Life and career== He was born on 28 January 1861, in Austria. Steinach was a physiologist, hormone researcher and biology professor who became the Director of Vienna's Biological Institute of the Academy of Sciences in 1912, the year in which he conducted experiments in the transplantation of a male guinea pig's testes into a female and the castration of the male.Eugen Steinach (1940) Sex and Life: Forty Years of Biological and Medical Experiments. (New York: Viking Press), p. 66 The testes secretion, now known as testosterone, resulted in the female guinea pig developing male sexual behaviour such as mounting the partner. This led Steinach to theorize that the gland's secretions were responsible for sexuality.Steinach (1940), p. 8 He developed the \"Steinach operation,\" or \"Steinach vasoligature,\" the goals of which were to reduce fatigue and the consequences of ageing and to increase overall vigor and sexual potency in men. It consisted of a half-(unilateral) vasectomy, which Steinach theorized would shift the balance from sperm production toward increased hormone production in the affected testicle. Famous Steinach surgeons in the 1920s and 1930s included Victor Blum, Robert Lichtenstern and Norman Haire. The procedure was later discredited, but even at the peak of its popularity there were medical sceptics such as Morris Fishbein, who edited the Journal of the American Medical Association and in 1927 likened rejuvenation cures to finding gold: once the \u2018cry of \u201cgold, gold\u201d was taken up by Steinach enthusiasts\u2019 and famous actors, doctors and financiers had the operations, the newspapers reported their good news stories and there was an additional rush of applicants.Diana Wyndham. (2012) Foreword by the Hon. Michael Kirby AC CMG. (Sydney: , p. 92 Gertrude Atherton's 1922 novel Black Oxen involves a fictional endocrine treatment attributed in the novel to Steinach. William Butler Yeats had an outburst of lyrical poetry and a 'second puberty' after Haire 'Steinached' him on 6 April 1934.Wyndham (2012), pp. 245\u2013263 Steinach received six nominations for the Nobel Prize in Physiology from 1921 to 1938, although he never received the prize.{Chandak Sengoopta (2000), 'The Modern Ovary: Construction, Meanings, Uses', History of Science, 38 (Pt 4) (122), p. 456 |url=https://www.academia.edu/192187/_The_Modern_Ovary_Constructions_Meanings_Uses_} He died on 14 May 1944, during exile in Switzerland. Harry Benjamin, in a June 1944 obituary for his colleague, attributed the melancholy of his final years to his enforced exile in Z\u00fcrich and the \u2018unjust criticism\u2019 of his rejuvenations and emphasised the \u2018enormous impetus\u2019 his work had for biochemists to concern themselves with all the endocrine glands.Wyndham (2012), p. 90, quoting Harry Benjamin ==References== ==External links== * Category:1861 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Hohenems Category:Austrian Jews Category:Austrian scientists Category:Austrian sexologists Category:Transgender and medicine ",
