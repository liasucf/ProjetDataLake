The channel was originally hosted solely by Thompson, but is now hosted by Nate Bonham, Calli Gade, Kennen Hutchison, Grace Dirig, and Kevin DeBruin. , the channel had around 13 million subscribers. ==History== At the age of 29, Thompson, who was a former airline pilot, was semi-retired in Farmington, Utah, and decided to spend the next seven years studying the way things worked. Eventually, Thompson realized that his friends were becoming interested in his projects, and decided to teach himself to produce videos and begin uploading them to YouTube.https://www.thekingofrandom.com/about The channel's name was originally \"01032010814\", the exact date and time Thompson created the channel.

On October 25, 2018, the channel introduced Calli as co-host.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-nH426wgaw Thompson reportedly stepped away to spend more time with family, but still owned the channel and was involved in its day-to-day operations until his death.

Facing a maximum of 15 years in prison, Thompson agreed to a plea bargain deal. In exchange for dropping the charges to a suspended sentence of misdemeanor recklessness with an incendiary device charge, Thompson agreed to create two YouTube videos educating viewers about the \"physical safety and/or the legal risks associated with experiments that could be dangerous\". ==Death of Grant Thompson== On July 29, 2019, Thompson died in a paramotoring crash near Hurricane in Washington County, Utah.
