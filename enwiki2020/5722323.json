Owned by Entravision Communications, it is a sister station to NBC affiliate KMIR-TV (channel 36, also licensed to Palm Springs) and Indio- licensed Univision affiliate KVER-CD (channel 41) and UniM\u00e1s affiliate KEVC-CD (channel 5). KPSE and KMIR share studios on Parkview Drive in Palm Desert; KEVC and KVER maintain separate facilities on Corporate Way, also in Palm Desert. KPSE's transmitter is located atop Edom Hill in Cathedral City. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 20. ==History== KPSE's logo as \"My 13 Palm Springs,\" used from September 2006 until January 2014 The station signed on January 3, 2000 as KPSE-LP on channel 50, the market's first locally based UPN affiliate. Owned by Mirage Media, it immediately replaced Los Angeles' KCOP-TV on Coachella Valley's Time Warner Cable system; until KPSE's launch, KCOP had served as UPN's de facto affiliate for Palm Springs. After UPN and The WB shut down and merged in 2006 to form The CW (which affiliated with KCWQ-LP and a subchannel of ABC affiliate KESQ- TV), KPSE joined MyNetworkTV. On September 26, 2007, Journal Communications (owner of KMIR) announced its purchase of KPSE from Mirage Media for $4.7 million with the transaction receiving approval January 28, 2008. In October 2013, Journal reached a deal to sell KMIR and KPSE to OTA Broadcasting, LLC (a company controlled by Michael Dell's MSD Capital). The sale was completed January 1, 2014.Consummation Notice, CDBS Public Access, Federal Communications Commission, Retrieved 8 January 2014. Along with other major Coachella Valley stations, KPSE-LP formerly identified itself on-air using its cable designation (at that time, channel 13) rather than its over-the-air analog channel position. This unusual practice (also common in the Fort Myers\u2013Naples, Florida market) stems in part from Palm Springs's exceptionally high cable penetration rate of 80.5% which is one of the highest in the United States. The station now brands simply as \"KPSE My TV.\" Until recently, the station offered programming from TheCoolTV in a secondary arrangement. That network could be seen weekday mornings from 6 until 9, Saturday mornings from 5 to noon, and Sundays from noon until 2:30. On September 22, 2011, Journal was granted a construction permit for a new low-power digital station on channel 29, which was immediately issued the call sign K29KF-D. On September 3, 2014, OTA Broadcasting changed K29KF-D's call letters to KPSG-LD and applied for a license to cover the permit; a week later, channel 29 became KPSE-LD, while KPSE-LP on channel 50 took the KPSG-LP call sign. On May 26, 2015, the KPSG-LP license was canceled. On July 21, 2017, it was announced that Spanish-language broadcaster Entravision Communications (minority owned by Univision Communications) was acquiring KPSE and KMIR-TV for $21 million. The sale to Entravision will make both stations a sister stations to KEVC-CD, KVER-CD and KVES-LD.Entravision Buying 2 Palm Springs Stations - TvNewsCheck The transaction was completed on November 1.Consummation Notice - Federal Communications Commission ===2013 Time Warner Cable compensation dispute=== Due to its low-power status, the station was pulled from Time Warner Cable systems at midnight on July 11, 2013 in a retransmission consent dispute with Time Warner; KMIR continued to air on the system due to rules disallowing full-power stations from being pulled during a sweeps period. KMIR, along with all Journal stations, was pulled at midnight on July 25, 2013 off Time Warner systems at the end of the sweeps period. On September 20, 2013, a deal was reached to return Journal's stations, including KMIR and KPSE, to Time Warner Cable; as part of the deal, KPSE moved to channel 20, ceding its former channel 13 slot to KMIR (which lost its longtime channel 6 position to Game Show Network). ==Digital channels== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
