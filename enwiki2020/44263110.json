It is performed by men bearing swords and shields and follows the movements and steps of Kalarippayattu. ==History== The origin of the art can be traced back to ancient days when Kalarippayattu, a martial art of Kerala, was in vogue. ==Performance== The dancers are usually dressed in a white loin cloth with red wrist bands and sing in chorus as they dance. The performers dance with sword and shield on their hands. The group is usually headed by a leader called Asan around whom the rest of the dancers perform. The dance used to be performed as a religious offering but is nowadays gaining popularity as a Syrian Christian entertainment art. ==Current situation== Currently both Parichamuttukali and Margamkali are included in the State Youth Festival of Kerala. This makes these art forms a competitive item in the Four-tier system (i.e. School, Sub District, Revenue and State level) Youth festival. ==See also== * Margamkali ==References== Category:Dances of India Category:Arts of Kerala ",
