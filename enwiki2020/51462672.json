    "text": "Reflective learning is a form of education in which the student reflects upon their learning experiences. A theory about reflective learning cites it as an intentional and complex process that recognize the role of social context and experience. The goals of the process are the clarification and the creation of meaning in terms of self, which then lead to a changed conceptual perspective. == Development == This is a development of the concept of experiential learning as propounded by John Dewey, who wrote Experience and Education in 1938. Later theorists include David Kolb, David Boud and Donald Sch\u00f6n. In a professional context, this is known as reflective practice, wherein the use of the reflective process allows one to understand experiences differently and take action accordingly. ==References== Category:Experiential learning Category:Learning methods Category:Learning theory (education) ",
