KCYE broadcasts a country music format branded as \"The Coyote\". The station's studios are located in Spring Valley in unincorporated Clark County, while its transmitter is on Black Mountain in Henderson. KCYE broadcasts in HD Radio. ==History== ===Early years=== The license for KCYE was originally applied for in 1981. The FCC granted a construction permit in 1986, and the callsign KJUL was adopted in 1987. KJUL finally took to the air in 1991, playing adult standards music. ===104.3 The Coyote=== On October 3, 2005, KJUL dropped the adult standards format for country music as \"The Coyote\"; on October 10, KJUL officially became KCYE. (The old callsign was immediately adopted by a station in St. George, Utah.) Ironically, just a few months before changing formats to country, KJUL was awarded station of the year honors at the National Association of Broadcasters' Marconi Awards. ===102.7 The Coyote=== On August 25, 2009, KCYE and KFRH swapped frequencies, with KCYE moving to the higher- powered 102.7 frequency, while KFRH's Top 40 format moving to the lesser- powered 104.3 frequency. On April 13, 2015, Disney announced that the Radio Disney network would become distributed through affiliations with HD Radio subchannels. KCYE was the first HD Radio affiliate of the network, and launched the format on their HD2 sub-channel. After re-branding on November 30, 2015 as \"102.7 Rodeo Radio\" during the National Finals Rodeo, on December 13, 2015, KCYE began stunting with Christmas music, branded as \"102.7 Santa FM\". However, the station returned to its country music format as \"102.7 The Coyote\". On June 1, 2017, KCYE's HD2 subchannel changed their format to adult contemporary, branded as \"Lite 101.5\" (simulcast on translator K268CS 101.5 FM Las Vegas). On June 10, 2017, Radio Disney programming moved from KCYE's HD2 sub-channel to a newly activated HD3 sub-channel, only for it to be replaced by NOAA Weather Radio in June 2018. On June 21, 2018, KCYE's HD2 subchannel changed their format from adult contemporary to a simulcast of talk-formatted KDWN 720 AM Las Vegas. ==Raiders football== On June 1, 2017, it was announced that KCYE and sister AM station KDWN (720) would be the Las Vegas radio affiliates for Oakland Raiders football broadcasts, for preseason and the regular season. This was in light of the pending relocation by 2020 of the franchise from Oakland to Las Vegas. In 2019, games moved to KYMT. ==References== ==External links== *KCYE official website * * CYE CYE Category:Radio Disney stations Category:Radio stations established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in Nevada CYE Category:Las Vegas Raiders broadcasters ",
