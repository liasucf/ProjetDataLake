He turned the company into a wholesaler in 1915, then became a drug manufacturer in 1925, acquiring a 50 percent interest in Wernet's Dental Manufacturing Company. Block Drug moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey in 1938. Although Alexander Block built the company largely through acquisitions, he developed the Polident brand internally during the 1930s. In 1948, Block Drug rolled out the Ammi-i-Dent tooth powder, and in the early 1950s, the company developed Nytol. After Alexander Block's death in 1953, his son Leonard N. Block (1911\u20132005) took over, eventually becoming the company's chairman. The last major new product the company introduced was Tegrin, in 1964. ===Timeline=== *1971 - The company went public, trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol BLOCA and raising $5.2 million in its initial offering. Two years later, another stock sale generated $23 million.

Block. In 1988, James became chairman as his uncle, Leonard N. Block became senior chairman. At the same time, Leonard N.
