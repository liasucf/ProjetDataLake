She spent most of her life abroad, having lived only 16 years in Serbia. Never forgetting her homeland, Katarina started her humanitarian work during the Balkan Wars. Thanks to her work, the Swiss Red Cross sent its mission and hospital in 1914, when the World War I broke out. She participated in the founding of the Department for Serbian Soldiers at the Swiss Red Cross and the \u201cZurich Bureau for the Location of Missing Persons\u201d, which was re-established during the World War II. She helped locate the missing, and organized distribution of humanitarian aid for the sick, wounded and imprisoned Serbian soldiers, their families and the families of the soldiers fighting at the Salonika Front. Jovanovi\u0107 also helped Serbian schoolchildren and students, orphans and all those who found themselves far away from their homeland. Her kindness earned her the nickname \u201cLittle Mother\u201d (Mamica). She died in Zurich on 31 May 1954. ==References== Category:1869 births Category:1954 deaths Category:20th-century Serbian philosophers Category:People from Belgrade Category:Serbian translators Category:Serbian literary historians Category:Public relations people Category:Serbian women philosophers Category:Serbian journalists Category:Serbian humanitarians Category:20th-century Serbian women writers Category:Serbian women in World War I Category:Women literary historians ",
