    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1904 and 1905 were elections that coincided with President Theodore Roosevelt's landslide election to a full term. Party share of seats remained roughly the same, when including vacancies and appointments, and the Republicans retained a significant majority over the Democrats. As these elections were prior to ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, senators were chosen by state legislatures. This was the last election cycle until 1996 which featured a presidential candidate who won re- election without securing coattails in the Senate in either of his presidential runs. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 59th Congress (1905\u20131907) * Majority Party: Republican (58) * Minority Party: Democratic (32) * Other Parties: (0) * Total Seats: 90 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === At the beginning of 1904. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=5 | | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | R | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=2 | R |- style=\"height:1em\" | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- style=\"height:1em\" | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=5 | | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |} === Result of the general elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=5 | | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | V | | V | | V | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=2 | R |- style=\"height:1em\" | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- style=\"height:1em\" | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=5 | | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |} === Beginning of the next Congress === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=5 | | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | V | | V | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=2 | R |- style=\"height:1em\" | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- style=\"height:1em\" | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=5 | | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |} {| |- valign=top !

Depew had been elected to this seat in 1899, and his term would expire on March 3, 1905. At the State election in November 1904, large Republican majorities were elected for a two-year term (1905-1906) in the State Senate, and for the session of 1905 to the Assembly. The 128th State Legislature met from January 3, 1905, on at Albany, New York. Late in 1904, Ex-Governor Frank S. Black tried to be nominated to succeed Depew. Black was supported by Governor Benjamin B. Odell, Jr., but after intense fighting behind the scenes, Odell finally dropped Black and accepted Depew's re- election which had been supported by his fellow Senator Thomas C. Platt and Speaker S. Frederick Nixon. The Republican caucus met on January 16. They re- nominated the incumbent U.S. Senator Chauncey M. Depew unanimously. The Democratic caucus met also on January 16. They nominated again Smith M. Weed who had been the candidate of the Democratic minority in the U.S. Senate election of 1887. {| class=wikitable |+1905 Democratic caucus for United States Senator result |- bgcolor=lightgrey !

Incumbent Philander C. Knox was elected by the Pennsylvania State Assembly to his first full term in the United States Senate. Republican Matthew Quay was elected by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to the United States Senate in the previous election in January 1901. He served until his death on May 28, 1904. In June 1904, Republican Philander C. Knox was appointed to serve out the remainder of Quay's term, ending on March 4, 1905, when he began a term in his own right. The Pennsylvania General Assembly, consisting of the House of Representatives and Senate, convened on January 17, 1905, to elect a Senator to serve the term beginning on March 4, 1905.
