Encouraged by his parents, he turned to music and learned to play the santorini with Azita Hajian as a child. After Santour, he turned to guitar and piano. Together with Ali Pahlavan, he formed Arian, which was originally a traditional music group. == Reading Arian's songs with Mohammad Reza Golzar == Mohammad Reza Golzar was once the guitarist of Arian, but later left the group. A few years after the end of Arian's activity, he performed the parvaz piece in a concert in the United States with Payam Salehi, which caused dissatisfaction between Ali Pahlavan and Arian's agents, because the single was performed without the permission of the band members at the concert. == References == == External links == * * Category:Iranian singers Category:1975 births Category:Living people ",
