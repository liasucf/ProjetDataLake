    "text": "James Cobbett (12 January 1804 \u2013 31 March 1842) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1826 to 1841 for Middlesex, Surrey and Sheffield Cricket Club (aka Yorkshire). Considered by many - according to The Cricketer and Wisden - to be \"the finest allrounder of his day\", Cobbett was a right-handed batsman, occasional wicket-keeper and right arm slow roundarm bowler. Cobbett began as an MCC ground staff bowler who occasionally stood as umpire. He started a playing career with Middlesex in 1826, as Surrey - the county of his birth - featured little in first-class cricket at the time. He played only once for them in 1839, as well as matches for Yorkshire in 1835. He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series and the South in the North v. South series. But it was for the MCC between 1830 and 1841, that he made most of his appearances: 47 in all, scoring 78 runs and taking 311 wickets. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1804 births Category:1842 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1826 to 1863 Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Surrey cricketers Category:Married v Single cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Left-Handed v Right-Handed cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:Fast v Slow cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricketers ",
