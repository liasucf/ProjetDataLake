She previously taught at Case Western Reserve University and the University of Maryland, College Park. Lee specializes in American politics with particular interest focusing on the U.S. Congress and institutional behavior. Lee is co-editor of Legislative Studies Quarterly and is the first editor of Cambridge University's American Politics Elements Series. Her 2009 book Beyond Ideology was the first academic work to define the role of partisanship in voting behavior within the US Senate and has been cited since then over 400 times in contemporary political science. Lee is also a co-author of the seminal textbook on congressional study, Congress and Its Members, currently in its sixteenth edition. Lee graduated with honors from the University of Southern Mississippi with a B.A. in English in 1991 and then pursued graduate studies at Vanderbilt University, from where she graduated with a Ph.D. in political science in 1997 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"The enduring consequences of the Great Compromise: Senate apportionment and congressional policymaking\", under the supervision of Bruce I.
