    "text": "Jerzy Ilicz was the Polish ambassador to Safavid Iran during the reign of king W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa (r. 1632\u20141648). He was accompanied by the Dominican Father Antonio da Fiandra, who was given a letter addressed to the then incumbent Safavid king Abbas II (r. 1642\u20141666). Da Fiandra had received the letter from the Venetian diplomat Giovanni Tiepolo, on behalf of the Venetian Senate. The French Jesuit Fran\u00e7ois Rigordi (1609\u201379), who was sent by the main branch of the Jesuits in the Near East based in Aleppo to the Safavid Empire, arrived in early 1646, shortly before Jerzy Ilicz' arrival, and presented the latters' recommendation to the court. ==Sources== * * Category:Diplomats of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Ambassadors of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth to the Safavid Empire ",
