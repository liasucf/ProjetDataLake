    "text": "The Twentieth Century is a 2019 Canadian comedy-drama film written and directed by Matthew Rankin in his full-length directorial debut. The film portrays a fictionalized portrait of the rise to power of former Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King as played by Dan Beirne. It won three Canadian Screen Awards. ==Historical divergence== The film is not a realistic or literally accurate depiction of Canadian history, instead mixing and matching elements of real history with invented fantasia in a stylized manner reminiscent of the films of Guy Maddin, and taking place largely on deliberately unrealistic sets influenced by German Expressionism, 1940s melodrama and wartime propaganda films. Rankin himself described it as \"one part Canadian Heritage Minute and one part ayahuasca death trip\". Although most of the film's major characters are at least loosely based on real Canadian historical figures, not all of their careers actually coexisted. In reality, although Mackenzie King and Arthur Meighen already knew and disliked each other by 1899, neither man had even entered electoral politics at all yet, let alone being candidates for Prime Minister, as of that time \u2014 while the real Bert Harper was never a political rival to either man, but merely a government bureaucrat. Harper did genuinely die by drowning, albeit not until 1901, and he drowned while attempting to rescue Bessie Blair, the daughter of New Brunswick premier Andrew George Blair. The real Lord Minto, further, was a benign figure who distinguished himself in Canadian history primarily as a patron of amateur sports, and his term as Governor General had already ended by the time either King or Meighen were in politics \u2014 whereas Lord Muto, his fictionalized portrayal in the film, is an openly fascist dictator with much more control over political affairs than Canadian Governors General actually have, who oversees Canadian politics in a manner more reminiscent of The Hunger Games than the real Canadian electoral process, and who is openly conspiring to draw the Canadian military much more deeply into the Boer War. Minto really did have daughters named Ruby and Violet, although both were only teenagers, not adult women, as of 1899. Joseph-Isra\u00ebl Tarte was also a real political figure, although he did not serve concurrently with either King or Meighen and was not strongly associated with the Quebec nationalist movement. According to Rankin, \"I wanted everything to feel artificial all the time. The conceit of the film is that Canada might just be totally fake and in this person\u2019s head. And the film is about his head. Everything in the film is drawn from Mackenzie King\u2019s diary and reprocessed. I describe it as a nightmare that he might have had in 1899.\"Kevin Ritchie, \"Director Matthew Rankin plunges into the depths of Canadian shame\". Now, December 12, 2019. He has also described the film as a satire on the overly earnest way that Canadian history is often presented in film and television, contrasting it against both Heritage Minutes and Sullivan Entertainment costume dramas. The film also makes use of both cross-gender acting, with three significant characters (King's mother, J. Isra\u00ebl Tarte and Lady Violet) portrayed by cross-gender performers in drag, and colour-blind casting, with two White Anglo-Saxon Protestant characters (Bert Harper and Dr. Wakefield) portrayed by Asian- Canadian actors. Rankin has described this aspect of the film by saying that \"I wanted to take a school-play approach that you don't see so much in film for some reason. In a school play you can have a Filipino Captain von Trapp and a transgender Artful Dodger and it's fine. In film, I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s this pressure to always link an actor to their exact demographic profile.\" == Cast == Sean Cullen plays the role of the Governor General. ==Release== The film premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival in the Midnight Madness program, and won the festival's award for Best Canadian First Feature Film. The film was subsequently screened at the 2019 Los Cabos International Film Festival, where it won the festival's Premio Competencia award. ===Critical reaction=== Film critic Peter Howell described the film as \"Monty Python by way of Rankin\u2019s fellow Winnipegger Guy Maddin\", while David Friend of The Canadian Press said the film \"subverts the mystique around politicians by mocking patriotism, propaganda and Canadian identity.\" For The Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Mintzer described the film as \"Guy Maddin meets John Waters by way of Powell and Pressburger\". ===Accolades=== In December 2019, the film was named to TIFF's annual year-end Canada's Top Ten list. The film received eight Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 8th Canadian Screen Awards in 2020. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" | Berlin International Film Festival | 20 February \u2013 1 March 2020 | FIPRESCI Prize (Forum) | Matthew Rankin | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=8| Canadian Screen Awards | rowspan=\"8\" | 28 May 2020 | Best Motion Picture | M\u00e9na\u00efc Raoul, Gabrielle Tougas-Fr\u00e9chette | | rowspan=\"8\" | |- | Best Actor | Dan Beirne | |- | Best Director | rowspan=\"2\" | Matthew Rankin | |- | Best Original Screenplay | |- | Best Art Direction/Production Design | Dany Boivin | |- | Best Costume Design | Patricia McNeil | |- | Best Hair | Nermin Grbic | |- | John Dunning Best First Feature | rowspan=\"4\" | Matthew Rankin | |- !scope=\"row\" | Directors Guild of Canada | 26 October 2019 | Discovery Award | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Los Cabos International Film Festival | 13 \u2013 17 November 2019 | Best Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=8| Prix Iris | rowspan=\"8\" | 10 June 2020 | Best Director | | rowspan=\"8\" | |- | Best Art Direction | Dany Boivin | |- | Best Sound | Bernard Gari\u00e9py Strobl, Sacha Ratcliffe, Lynne Tr\u00e9panier | |- | Best Editing | Matthew Rankin | |- | Best Costume Design | Patricia McNeil | |- | Best Makeup | Adriana Verbert | |- | Best Hairstyling | Nermin Grbic | |- | Best First Film | rowspan=\"6\" | Matthew Rankin | |- !scope=\"row\" | Toronto International Film Festival | 5\u201315 September 2019 | Best Canadian First Feature Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=7| Vancouver Film Critics Circle | rowspan=\"7\" | 7 January 2020 | Best Canadian Film | | rowspan=\"7\" | |- | Best Director of a Canadian Film | |- | One to Watch | |- | Best Screenplay for a Canadian Film | |- | Best Actor in a Canadian Film | Dan Beirne | |- | Best Supporting Actor in a Canadian Film | Louis Negin | |- | Best Supporting Actress in a Canadian Film | Catherine St-Laurent | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2019 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Matthew Rankin Category:Films about prime ministers Category:Canadian political satire films ",
