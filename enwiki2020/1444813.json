After winning in 1849 the horse failed to complete the course during the next three years before winning again in 1853 at the age of 15, the oldest ever winner. Peter Simple was a 9/1 shot in his 1853 victory at Aintree and was trained by Tom Olliver who was also the jockey. Josey Little was the owner. ==References== Category:National Hunt racehorses Category:Grand National winners Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Non-Thoroughbred racehorses Category:1838 racehorse births ",
