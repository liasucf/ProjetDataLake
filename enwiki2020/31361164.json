One of the figures originally intended for this installation was held back at the time due to concerns that it would be found too controversial. These fears were seen to have some foundations when Shaw's 2007 version of the figure, a three-metre high, \"naked, portly, and proudly erect\"'Is this the new brutalism?' The Times rendering of Silenus, was attacked during its exhibition in a Vyner Street gallery in London's East End by a man wielding an iron bar, shouting \"You're worshiping the wrong God!\"'Penzance turns regeneration into a fine art' The Observer. The influence of myth, seen in Shaw's early work, is once again present in his 2008 sculpture, Minotaur, a piece that was commissioned to mark the opening of Harrison Birtwistle's Opera, The Minotaur.'No bull, the Covent Garden monster' This is London After this, however, the more political side to his work becomes increasingly evident with a number of sculptures responding to issues such as terrorism and the war in Iraq.'Casting a dark democracy' Dazed & Confused At this time Shaw was working in London as a Fellow sculptor at the Kenneth Armitage Foundation. The main works he produced during this 2006 to 2008 residency were Man on Fire: What God of Love Inspires Such Hate in the Hearts of Men, Tank on Fire (awarded the selectors' choice Threadneedle prize in 2008), and the multi-sensory installation Casting a Dark Democracy \u2013 Shaw's haunting response to the now infamous image of the Abu Ghraib prisoner, described as \"one of too few works to engage unequivocally with the reality and human cost of the Iraq war.\"'Fallen Victorian Star Shines Bright', Financial Times ==Public and private commissions == * * Drummer (2009\u201311), Lemon Quay, Truro, Cornwall. * The Minotaur (2008), The Royal Opera House, Bow Street, London. * Rites of Dionysus (2000\u20134), The Eden Project, Cornwall. ==Awards and prizes == *The Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture at The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition (2015). * Threadneedle Prize Shortlist (2009), Mall Galleries * FBA Selectors' Choice Prize: Threadneedle Prize (2008), Mall Galleries'Now for a real art prize', This is London * Kenneth Armitage Sculpture Fellowship (2006) * The Mullan Prize (2005), Royal Ulster Academy Annual Exhibition * Prince of Wales Bursary (2005), The British School at Athens * Millfield Summer Open Exhibition (2003), \u2013 First Prize * Discerning Eye (1997), Mall Galleries \u2013 Prize Winner * Delfina Studio Trust Award (1996) ==References== ==External links== *Tim Shaw Official Website *Tim Shaw Official Blog * Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century sculptors Category:Sculptors from Northern Ireland Category:British contemporary artists Category:Artists from Belfast Category:Royal Academicians Category:British installation artists Category:British male sculptors Category:Alumni of Falmouth University ",
