    "text": "The brown-mantled tamarin (Leontocebus fuscicollis), also known as Spix's saddle-back tamarin, is a species of saddle-back tamarin from South America. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. The brown-mantled tamarin is sympatric with the pygmy marmoset, sharing the same habitat in South American counties, and will often raid the gum holes of this species. It sometimes associates with the red-bellied tamarin. Brown-mantled tamarins occupy an extensive area of northern Amazonia. There are 4 subspecies: *L. f. avilapiresi, Avila Pires' saddle-back tamarin *L. f. fuscicollis, Spix's saddle-back tamarin *L. f. mura, Mura's saddleback tamarin *L. f. primitivus, Lako's saddleback tamarin Cruz Lima's saddle-back tamarin, Lesson's saddle- back tamarin, Illiger's saddle-back tamarin, the red-mantle saddle-back tamarin, the Andean saddle-back tamarin, Geoffroy's saddle-back tamarin and Weddell's saddle-back tamarin were all formerly considered subspecies of the brown-mantled tamarin. ==References== == Further reading == *Dunbar (1995). \"The mating system of callitrichid primates: II.
