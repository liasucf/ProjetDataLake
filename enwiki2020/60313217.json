    "text": "\"Mi Persona Favorita\" (English: \"My Favorite Person\") is a song by Spanish singer Alejandro Sanz and Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello, from Sanz's twelfth studio album El Disco. The song was released by Universal Music Spain on 28 March 2019 as the album's third single, accompanied with its music video firstly premiering on Sanz's official Vevo channel, which was directed by American director Gil Green. The composition and lyrics of the song were written by Sanz and Cabello. The track was produced by the former and music producers, Alfonso P\u00e9rez and Julio Reyes. The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra played orchestra for the song, which was conducted by Czech conductor Adam Klemens, who also played the piano for the song. Spanish flamenco guitarist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carmona, lead guitarist from Spanish new flamenco musical group Ketama, played the flamenco guitar. Twice Grammy Award- winning American drummer Larnell Lewis played drums for the song. The song topped the charts in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama. ==Background== Cabello revealed how the collaboration was born, stating that Sanz invited her to Miami in summer 2018 to record the song and film the music video together: She continued, adding that she dedicated the song to her little sister, Sofi, who she considers her \"favorite person.\" ==Composition and lyrics== \"Mi Persona Favorita\" is a flamenco pop ballad, featuring Spanish flamenco guitarist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carmona, lead guitarist from Spanish new flamenco musical group Ketama playing the flamenco guitar in the song. As Jeff Benjamin of Forbes opined, musically, it delivers the kind of quality duet longtime Sanz fans love for the singer and his penchant for flamenco inspired music style, and layers the two singers' distinct vocal timbres\u2014both raspy with the slightest bit of native twang\u2014into a soothing, snappy acoustic cut. Lyrically, it's easy enough for any of the performers' young fans to sing along with\u2014regardless of their native language. ==Commercial performance== The song debuted at 22 on Spanish official single chart in 8 March 2019 and reached number-four on Billboard\u2018s Spain Digital Song Sales chart in 11 May 2019. This song later reached number-one on Spanish official airplay chart. The song is certified as Platinum for selling over 40,000 digital copies in Spain in May 2019, and certified as Gold (Latin) in the United States and Puerto Rico by RIAA in 31 July 2019. Internationally, the song became a great success in Central America, reaching number one in Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama. ==Music videos== The official music video of the song was released on 28 March 2019. It\u2019s directed by American director Gil Green, who formerly collaborated with Cabello on the video of \"Hey Ma\". The video shows both Sanz and Cabello singing and vibing together at the recording studio, but the larger story is the couples featured throughout the visual. Couples pose in front of a white backdrop. The visual begins and ends with pairs expressing what they love most about their partners. The viewer sees a truly diverse group of lovebirds\u2014ranging in their skin colors, sexualities, ages, body sizes and more\u2014speaking in English, Spanish and French, and displaying their different means of affection. It once again embraces a larger, more universal message that can help this song reach more people. Also, the positive portrayal of two different gay couples is a much- appreciated co-sign. A vertical video was released on 29 March 2019 on Spotify. ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! class=\"unsortable\"| Year ! class=\"unsortable\"| Organization ! class=\"unsortable\"| Award ! class=\"unsortable\"| Result ! class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"|2019 | LOS40 Music Awards | Song of the Year | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=3|2019 |rowspan=3|Latin Grammy Awards |Record of the Year | |style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=3| |- |Song of the Year | |- |Best Pop Song | |} ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal.
