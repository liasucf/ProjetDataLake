Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \"C+\" grade and wrote, \"Instead of picking one serialized element and providing some kind of conclusion or any answer, this finale introduces even more new questions. Sure, Nick's mom being alive can be construed as kind of an answer to Nick's sudden interest in his parents' murder case that started a few weeks ago with Juliette as instigator and lead investigator. But really it just opens a door to tons of new queries, none of which the show seems interested in committing to, since we still have no idea what Renard is, what kind of hierarchy is in place, who the Reapers are, or any of the other overarching mythology. Grimm is now densely layered, with the Portland cases, Nick's past and his parents murder, and international Wesen issues building outwards, but in shooting for a big, ambitious design, the small things are getting lost in the shuffle.\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \"If there is one gripe I have about tonight's episode it's the time limit. So much of the episode felt rushed, as we hurried from one character to the next, and from one quick burst of story to the next, and if given room to breathe, the plot might have been better served. It felt like Akira, Renard, Adalind, and Team Nick all got pushed to the side for the big reveal of Mama Burkhardt. There's nothing wrong with that, but there was just too much to tell and not enough allotted time to do it.\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind wrote, \"A lot of good stuff got introduced in 'The Woman in Black', stuff that I have the fullest confidence in saying will pan out beautifully in season two, but the finale was a missed opportunity, to me. It could have been a major revelation, an episode that laid all the cards out on the table, but instead, we have a confession that didn't really count, a reveal that was good (but not great), and a one-note villain that only left the most ancillary of bodies in his wake.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Grimm (season 1) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ",
