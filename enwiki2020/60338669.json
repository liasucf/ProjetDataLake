His career began in academia where he worked at College of Art, Science, and Technology (CAST) for 16 years, before entering public life by joining the Ministry of Energy. He now owns and manages a variety of businesses in the health industry. == Early life and education == Henry Lowe was born on April 9, 1939 in St. Andrew, Jamaica. His family was \u201cfar from being wealthy\u201d and were devout Catholics. His father David was a Cabinet Member and his mother Josephine was a part-time tailor and a homemaker. Lowe was the fourth of ten children. At 4 years old Lowe was enrolled at the Woods\u2019 infant school. Though it was located on Metcalfe Road, a neighborhood which was considered affluent at the time, his school hosted its classes in sheds behind a house. Lowe attended primary school in Port Maria and later attended Excelsior High School. Lowe was accepted into the University of the West Indies in 1959 with scholarship, where he graduated with a bachelor of Science and Honours degrees in natural science. Lowe obtained a Master's in Pharmaceutical and Medicinal chemistry from the University of Sydney and his Ph.D. at Manchester University. To both universities Lowe was awarded a British commonwealth scholarship becoming \u201cthe first Jamaican, and maybe the only one ever, to be awarded two commonwealth Scholarships\u201d. He pursued post-doctoral studies at the Bolton Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. == Career == === Academia === The year after graduating from Excelsior high school Lowe was himself hired as a science teacher at Holmwood high school. After graduating from the University of the West Indies, he taught chemistry at Excelsior high school and was appointed the head of the Science Department for one year, after which he began lecturing at CAST on September 10, 1964. His time at this institution was interrupted intermittently by educational pursuits. Lowe returned to the College of Art Science and technology in 1970 and was made the head of the science department in 1973 \u2013 the first native Jamaican to have held this position. Lowe returned again where he was made vice principal of academic affairs. Being persuaded by Jamaica's then Ambassador to the U.S., Douglas Fletcher, Lowe left his position at CAST to join the Ministry of Energy to help manage the severe energy crisis Jamaica was experiencing. === Research === Lowe's research is focused on ascertaining medicinal and pharmacological qualities of Jamaican plants; in particular Cannabis and Tillandsia recurvata. Lowe has been involved in Cannabis research \"since 1972\". His Ph.D. focused on examining \u201cthe structure activity relationships of some of the cannabinoids in ganja\u201d. Lowe, in collaboration with various colleagues has produced experimental findings which demonstrate the efficacy of cannabis flavonoids in combating illnesses such as hepatitis c. Lowe's interest in Tillandsia recurvata began during his doctoral studies. Lowe and his research team have since shown that it can be potent medicine for prostate cancer through its cytotoxic properties towards cancer cell lines (P-3C and P-45). Lowe produces a variety of health products based on his discoveries in these areas. === Public Service === Lowe developed the first National Energy Policy and Management plan for Jamaica as the director of its Ministry of Energy. It included an agreement with Venezuela that 25% of the revenue generated from Jamaica's purchase of Venezuelan oil would be re- directed towards various Jamaican development projects aLowe also achieved the reduction of Jamaica's use of oil by 20 percent. After this, Lowe helped establish the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, before joining the Ministry of Agriculture, and then the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport. === Business ventures === ==== Blue Cross Jamaica ==== Lowe had been a consultant for Blue Cross of Jamaica since the 1970s, and was appointed to the board of trustees in 1988.

Lowe sold his shares in 2008 to Sagicor. ==== Eden Gardens ==== In 2000 Lowe purchased a two-acre property on 39 Lady Musgrave road. Lowe used this land to create the \u201cEden gardens wellness center and spa\u201d \u2013 a business venture which also aligns with his ideals of promoting wellness and health in Jamaica. More property was purchased across from 44 lady Musgrave road which was being used for an expansion as of 2012. Novlet green took over management of the facility in 2006. ==== Pharmaceutical firms ==== In 2007 at a conference of the Caribbean poison information network (CARPIN), Lowe spoke of the commercial benefits possible from research into medicinal cannabis. In 2013 Lowe established Medicanja; a company to produce and commercialize products based on cannabis. He is the firm's Executive Chairman and chief scientist. Medicanja has a research facility at the University of the West Indies. On July 26th 2018, Medicanja released twelve nutraceutical products.
