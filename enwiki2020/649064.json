He received his B.A. from Amherst and his doctorate from the University of Chicago. ==Political science== Truman was a prominent political scientist and is known for his contributions to the theory of political pluralism. ==Administrative roles== He taught at a number of institutions before joining Columbia University in 1951. There, in addition to teaching political science, he undertook a number of administrative roles, serving successively as head of the department of public law and government (1959\u201361), Dean of Columbia College (1962\u201367), and Vice-President and Provost (1967\u201369). In 1969, Truman \"stepped down after a tumultuous year of student unrest. During the student-lead [sic] takeover of the University, Truman was continually mentioned as a University administrator who retained the student body's respect.\" Truman became president of Mount Holyoke College in 1969 and stayed until 1978. Truman oversaw the decision to remain a woman's college in 1971. His obituary from Mount Holyoke noted, \"both at Columbia and Mount Holyoke, Truman was involved in dealing with the significant student unrest of the late 1960s and 1970s. At both campuses he faced student protests and takeovers regarding such difficult issues as race and the Vietnam War. Despite these challenges, which were common on college campuses during the Vietnam Era, Truman left a lasting legacy as a warm and caring leader.\" ==Scholarship== * Administrative Decentralization (1940) * The Governmental Process: Political Interests and Public Opinion.
