    "text": "State Highway 28 (SH 28) is a New Zealand state highway in the Waikato region. The highway was gazetted in 1997 as a faster route for traffic travelling between and towards the Port of Tauranga. Prior to the formation of SH 28 the quickest route, only if using state highways, was via T\u012brau and SH 27. There are no towns on this route and due to the highway being mapped to existing rural roads there are several places were motorists need to give way to traffic from other roads. ==Route== SH 28 leaves SH 1 at Put\u0101ruru on Whites Road and after travelling north-east for 5.8 km the highway meets and shares a concurrency eastbound for 2.5 km. SH 28 then leaves SH 5 and travels northbound on Harwoods Road /Te Poi Road (South) for the next 10.7 km where it turns east at a T-junction onto Rapurapu Road. The last 5 km leads to its terminus at SH 29 just at the foot of the Kaimai Ranges.State Highway 28 on Google Maps ==See also== * List of New Zealand state highways ==References== ==External links== *New Zealand Transport Agency 28 Category:Transport in Waikato ",
