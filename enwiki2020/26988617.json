    "text": "The Third Zone District of Moanda lies south of the city of Moanda, Gabon. It is isolated from the city by the Miosso Swamp and its only connection remains the Moanda-Bakoumba road, which passes between Mounts Moanda and Boundinga and continues to the border with Congo-Brazzaville. ==Geography== The Third Zone district lies south of the city of Moanda. It lies along the Moanda-Bakoumba road, which passes the Miosso River and continues southwards to Mount Moanda and Mount Boundinga. The swampy Miosso River isolates the district from the city. The district lies nearest to Mount Moanda and Mount Boundinga. ==Trivia== * The Third Zone District is home to Rigobert Landji Public High School, the largest high school in Moanda. The high school is built on a previously unoccupied plateau, making Moanda a town built on four plateaus. * Local reports abound on the proliferation of witchcraft in the Third Zone District. That, added to its geographical isolation, has led to limited infrastructure in the district. Category:Populated places in Haut-Ogoou\u00e9 Province ",
