At the start of the season, the league which started during the previous season was completed, with the club finishing 11th (out of 14), which meant the club had to compete in a promotion/relegation play-offs against the 12th placed club, Hapoel Kfar Saba, and the two Liga Bet winners, Maccabi Jaffa and Hapoel Kiryat Haim. The club lost all three play-offs matches and was relegated to the second division, which was renamed Liga Alef, and played in this division during the remainder of the season, finishing 10th (out of 12), which meant that the club had to face another promotion/relegation play- offs, which were delayed and were played at the beginning of the next season. ==Match results== ===Legend=== ===1954\u201355 Liga Alef=== The league began on 6 February 1955, and by the time the previous season ended, only 20 rounds of matches were completed, with the final 6 rounds being played during September and October 1955.1955-1955 Liga Leumit Schedule dribblist.com ====Final table==== ====Matches==== ====Results by match==== ===Promotion/Relegation play-offs=== ====Table==== Beitar Jerusalem relegated to Liga Alef ====Matches==== ===1955\u201356 Liga Alef=== ====Final table==== ====Matches==== ====Results by match==== ===Promotion/Relegation play-offs=== ====Table==== ==References== Category:Beitar Jerusalem F.C. seasons Beitar Jerusalem ",
