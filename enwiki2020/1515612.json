It was enacted by Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Yoshimune in 1742. The book was used to determine appropriate judgements and punishments by servants of the daimy\u014d (\u5927\u540d), but these servants were not required to follow the guidelines of the Kujikata Osadamegaki. Rather, they were bound to mete out fair justice only by the Japanese Confucian directive to serve one's daimy\u014d well. ==References== *Yosiyuki Noda (1976).
