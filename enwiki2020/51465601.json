Haskell's opponent, Ben Tillman, sought to disenfranchise blacks in the state, and many white Republicans supported Haskell, but other black Republicans disagreed with Morris and opposed both Tillman and Haskell because Haskell had been involved in suppressing black votes in the 1876 gubernatorial election.
