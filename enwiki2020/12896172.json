    "text": "Mastixia is a genus of about 19 species of resinous evergreen trees, usually placed in the family Cornaceae. Its range extends from India through Southeast Asia and New Guinea to the Solomon Islands. Mastixia species have alternate or opposite simple broad leaves, many-flowered inflorescences, and blue to purple drupaceous fruits. The classification of Mastixia is inconsistent due to continuing investigation into its phylogenetic relationships. Although generally placed in Cornaceae, it has also been associated with the family Nyssaceae, when that family is removed from Cornaceae. Mastixia is also sometimes separated, along with the genus Diplopanax, into the family Mastixiaceae. Fruits of this genus are common Paleocene fossils. ==Species== the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families and The Plant List recognise about 30 accepted taxa (of species and infraspecific names). * Mastixia arborea ** subsp. macrophylla ** subsp. meziana * Mastixia caudatilimba * Mastixia congylos * Mastixia cuspidata * Mastixia eugenioides * Mastixia euonymoides * Mastixia glauca * Mastixia kaniensis ** subsp. ledermannii * Mastixia macrocarpa * Mastixia macrophylla * Mastixia microcarpa * Mastixia montana * Mastixia nimalii (M. nimali in IUCN) * Mastixia octandra * Mastixia parviflora * Mastixia pentandra ** subsp. cambodiana ** subsp. chinensis ** subsp. philippinensis ** subsp. scortechinii * Mastixia rostrata ** subsp. caudatifolia * Mastixia tetrandra * Mastixia tetrapetala * Mastixia trichophylla * Mastixia trichotoma ** var. clarkeana ** var. korthalsiana ** var. maingayi ** var. rhynchocarpa ==References== Category:Cornales genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
