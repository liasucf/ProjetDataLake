    "text": "The 2018 CAF Champions League (officially the 2018 Total CAF Champions League for sponsorship reasons) was the 54th edition of Africa's premier club football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and the 22nd edition under the current CAF Champions League title. Esp\u00e9rance de Tunis won the title for the third time, defeating Al-Ahly in the final, and qualified as the CAF representative at the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2018 CAF Confederation Cup in the 2019 CAF Super Cup. Wydad Casablanca were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals. ==Association team allocation== All 56 CAF member associations may enter the CAF Champions League, with the 12 highest ranked associations according to their CAF 5-Year Ranking eligible to enter two teams in the competition. As a result, theoretically a maximum of 68 teams could enter the tournament \u2013 although this level has never been reached. For the 2018 CAF Champions League, the CAF uses the 2012\u20132016 CAF 5-Year Ranking, which calculates points for each entrant association based on their clubs\u2019 performance over those 5 years in the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup. The criteria for points are the following: {| Class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! !CAF Champions League !CAF Confederation Cup |- !Winners |5 points |4 points |- !Runners-up |4 points |3 points |- !Losing semi-finalists |3 points |2 points |- !3rd place in groups |2 points |1 point |- !4th place in groups |1 point |1 point |} The points are multiplied by a coefficient according to the year as follows: *2016 \u2013 5 *2015 \u2013 4 *2014 \u2013 3 *2013 \u2013 2 *2012 \u2013 1 ==Teams== The following 59 teams from 47 associations entered the competition: *Teams in bold received a bye to the first round. *The other teams entered the preliminary round. This was the second highest number of teams in the history of CAF Champions League. The highest number was recorded in 2007 where 60 teams entered. Associations are shown according to their 2012\u20132016 CAF 5-Year Ranking \u2013 those with a ranking score have their rank and score indicated. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Associations eligible to
