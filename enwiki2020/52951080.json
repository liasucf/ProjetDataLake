    "text": "Coronation Street is a British soap opera first broadcast on 9 December 1960. The following is a list of characters introduced in 2017, by order of first appearance. All characters are introduced by series producer Kate Oates. The first notable character that appeared was the stillborn son of Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), Ruairi, in January. Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles) first appeared in February as a love interest for Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and left the series in May. She was followed by Trina Robson (Kerry Bennett), a drug dealer, who appeared in four episodes. The final character to join in February was Oliver Battersby, Steve and Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson) baby son. Neil Clifton (Ben Cartwright) arrived in March as an acquaintance of Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) who became involved in Bethany Platt's (Lucy Fallon) grooming and sexual exploitation storyline. Sally Metcalfe's (Sally Dynevor) online stalker, Leah Buckley (Molly McGlynn), arrived in April, which tied in with the return of Sally's sister, Gina Seddon (Connie Hyde). Pat Phelan's (Connor McIntyre) biological daughter Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp) arrived in June, alongside Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman), who is taken in by Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank). Moira Pollock (Louiza Patikas), the manager of the Medical Centre and Liz McDonald's (Beverley Callard) new boss, arrived in July. Mary Taylor's (Patti Clare) long-lost son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace) moved to Weatherfield in August, bringing his wife, Angie (Victoria Ekanoye), and their baby son, George (Romeo Cheetham-Karcz). In September, Colin Callen (Jim Moir) made his first appearance. In October, Seb's drug-addicted mother, Abi, played by former Shameless actress Sally Carman, first appeared. November introduced Rana Nazir's (Bhavna Limbachia) brother Imran Habeeb (Charlie de Melo), as well as Henry Newton (George Banks), a new love interest for Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell). ==Ruairi McDonald== Ruairi McDonald is the son of Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Ruairi is born prematurely at 23 weeks and dies when he is born. Steve and Michelle are further devastated that Ruairi will not be given a birth or death certificate, as he was born before 24 weeks. Michelle and Steve's marriage is strained and Michelle kicks Steve out when she thinks he does not care about his dead son. However, Michelle allows him back after talking to Steve's mother Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard), who also lost a premature child, Katie, 25 years before. Steve blames himself for Ruairi's death, thinking it is punishment for getting Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) pregnant six months earlier. Michelle contemplates suicide, unable to cope with life without Ruairi, but is talked out of it by Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). In December 2016, it was announced that the show would tackle the subject of late miscarriage and Michelle and Steve would lose their unborn child. Marsh, who lost her own child at a similar stage in her pregnancy, said \"I thought long and hard before agreeing to take on the challenge of this storyline. It is obviously a cause very close to my heart having lost my beautiful Archie at 21 weeks and 5 days. I discussed it with my family and friends, all of who were very supportive. In the end I felt it was an important story to tell in order to raise awareness of something which affects thousands of women every year. I have had to go to some very dark places in my mind whilst filming these heartbreaking scenes but my family, friends and colleagues have been incredible.\" She added that revisiting feelings in character was \"challenging\". Producer Kate Oates added \u201cThe subject of miscarriage will always be sensitive; but telling this story with Simon and Kym at the centre would always have an extra poignancy\" and hoped they \"are able to encourage discussion, understanding and compassion for those viewers affected by the loss of a baby. The cast were in safe hands with our amazing and empathetic director Tony Prescott, and it has been humbling to see all the actors involved being so selfless and generous in their performances\". ==Chloe Tipton== Chloe Tipton, played by Jo-Anne Knowles, made her first on- screen appearance on 1 February 2017, before departing on 15 May 2017. Chloe is a glamorous woman who orders a taxi from Street Cars and finds herself being driven by Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), who has just fallen out with his girlfriend Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor). Chloe witnesses Peter and Toyah arguing outside the cab office and when they arrive at her hotel, Chloe asks Peter if he is going back to reconcile with Toyah. Chloe is clearly attracted to Peter and asks to join her for a drink in the hotel. They talk in the bar, where she tells him that she is impulsive and he seems interesting to her. Telling her that he has a family conference to go back to, Peter makes his excuses to leave. Chloe asks him to stay with her, but he refuses and she gives him a generous tip, making it clear that she is unhappy to see him go. A week later, Chloe calls into the cab office and specially requests Peter as her driver to collect her from a dinnertime drinks appointment with a friend, telling him that she would pay him for his extra time and that her divorce would shortly be coming through. Chloe later deliberately bumps into Peter crying, and tells him that her ex-boyfriend has been following her. He takes her home, where there is obvious sexual tension, however Peter leaves, forgetting his mobile phone. He then returns to Chloe's house to return it, where they kiss, however Peter leaves immediately after. It is then revealed that Chloe has downloaded a tracking app on Peter's phone so she can observe his every move. After previously telling her that he is interested in purchasing the local pub The Rovers Return Inn, Chloe unexpectedly arrives and fakes showing an interest in buying the pub, where Peter is unnerved that Toyah may see her. Peter then threatens Chloe in the ginnel, ordering her to leave him and Toyah alone. However, they have been spotted by Peter's father Ken Barlow (William Roache), who takes Chloe inside and she lies to him that she and Peter are having an affair, so Ken informs Toyah of this, leading to her temporarily moving out. The following night, Peter is close to turning back to alcohol after battling alcoholism previously and declares that Ken is at the heart of all his problems. Later that night, Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant, with Peter and other members of his family being listed as suspects. After Peter's son Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) finds a voice message on his phone of Peter apologising and sounding frantic on the night that Ken was pushed down the stairs, everybody automatically assumes that he is behind Ken's attack. However, Peter tells Simon, Toyah and the rest of his family that he was visiting Chloe at the time that Ken was attacked, however her obsessive behaviour became violent and he pushed her away in self- defence, but she fell and cut her face, and threatened to lie to the police that he punched her. Peter then visits Chloe and pleads that she tell the police the truth, but instead she informs DS MacKinnon (Sandra Huggett) that Peter assaulted her in her own home as a result of their affair, and that this took place the day before Ken's attack, making him prime suspect in the investigation. Peter is later arrested and charged with assaulting Chloe and placed further in the frame for Ken's attack, which adds pressure to his relationship with Toyah. In the week when Peter is due to stand trial for attacking Chloe, he confides in his ex-wife and Toyah's stepsister, Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), about how he would never harm a woman and that Chloe is punishing him for something. Leanne subsequently pays Chloe a visit, threatening her to drop the charges, however Toyah later turns up to achieve the same purpose. Chloe is exceptionally rude towards Leanne and Toyah, and initially refuses to drop the charges against Peter, however Toyah and Leanne threaten to tell the police that Chloe attacked Toyah by throwing her to the floor, with Leanne offering to provide Toyah with bruises to reinforce their case. Chloe reluctantly agrees to drop the charges, however she states that Peter could still easily have returned to Weatherfield and pushed Ken down the stairs, which stuns Leanne and Toyah. Peter later receives a phonecall informing him that the charges have been dropped by Chloe, and Leanne provides him with a false alibi for the time when Ken was attacked. ==Trina Robson== Trina Robson, played by Kerry Bennett, is a receptionist at Walmsley Croft Solicitors LLP of Weatherfield where Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) went for a job interview. When the client, Ronan Truman (Colin Tierney), arrived Adam was intrigued about him, but Trina cited her confidentiality clause and refused to give any details, aside from saying he held wild parties. Adam took Trina for a drink to Nick's Bistro where he attempted to get information about Ronan. Adam took her back to his flat for the night. In January 2017, Bennett was pictured filming scenes with Robertson (Adam Barlow), the same week her departure scenes as Eva Falco in Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks had aired. ==Oliver Battersby== Oliver Battersby made his first on-screen appearance on 20 February 2017. He is played by twins Emmanuel and Jeremiah Cheetham and was also played by another baby, Toby, in 2017. He is the son of Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Leanne has a one-night stand with Steve, who is married to Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Leanne has a one-night stand with Steve in June 2016 and falls pregnant. When Steve finds out, he chooses not to be a part of their baby's life in order to protect his relationship with Michelle. Steve tells his mother, Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) about Leanne's baby and she is hurt by Steve's decision. In August 2016, Leanne reconciles with her ex-husband, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), and they agree to raise the baby as his. In February 2017, Leanne goes into labour whilst stuck in a lift with her stepsister, Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) and gives birth to her son. The Platt family and Michelle meet him. Leanne tells Nick that she has decided not to put him on the birth certificate, but changes her mind. At a family party organised by Nick's mother, Gail Rodwell (Helen Worth), at The Bistro to celebrate Oliver's birth, Steve announces that he is Oliver's father. Leanne allows Steve to be involved in Oliver's life after Steve decides to involve solicitors. In March 2017, at a meeting with a solicitor, Michelle sends a photo to Nick of Oliver with Liz and Steve taken by Leanne, leaving Nick hurt. Steve arrives at the registry office when Leanne registers Oliver's birth and Steve wants to be named. Nick is upset when he sees Oliver's birth certificate has Steve's name. In April 2017, on Ruairi's due date, Steve takes Oliver to the beach, where he and Michelle scattered Ruairi's ashes, hurting Michelle as she wanted the day to be about Ruairi. Leanne panics when Oliver fails to wake up and is barely breathing. He is rushed to hospital and Steve worries he may have accidentally overdosed Oliver. Oliver is kept in overnight and Nick is hurt when he sees Leanne so close to Steve. In May 2017, Oliver and his family spend a day at the beach to try and resolve the feud between Steve and Nick, but Nick decides to leave Weatherfield in June 2017 and sells the flat. In August 2017, Steve invites Leanne and Oliver to stay with him. Oliver is central \"of an all-encompassing plot\" which is \"a multi-stranded storyline that involves practically half of Weatherfield\". Danson said acting her on-screen birth \"was weirdly exhausting\" and Leanne's \"birth is very, very different from others we have seen on Corrie, but it is Leanne's first baby and the birth situation is not ideal\". Danson also added that when Oliver is born, \"the realisation that Nick is not his dad hits home\" and although Nick \"will be there for him and be his dad, but they both know that there is this obstacle and it's become very real. Oliver is a child that is not Nick's yet again, like Simon\". Oliver's true paternity will prompt the \"decision that Nick's name shouldn't be on the birth certificate as it just doesn't feel right.\" In May 2020 Oliver is diagnosed with mitochondrial disease. which then became incurable, risking death. At home when Oliver suffers from a seizure and his medication doesn\u2019t work he is rushed to hospital. He is placed on a ventilator when his seizures are relentless. The doctor later tells Leanne and Steve that Oliver is unlikely to ever come of the life support machine as his seizures are continuous and that he cannot breathe on his own, and that there is nothing that can be done for him. As they have been told that it is time to take him off the ventilator when extensive brain damage and other complications are likely to occur, Leanne and Steve try to explore other treatments abroad. ==Neil Clifton== Neil Clifton, played by Ben Cartwright, made his first appearance on 15 March 2017. Cartwright was tempted to turn the role down after reading through the character breakdown, saying \"I had major concerns and thought about how it could affect me as a person.\" After speaking with his friends, he accepted the role. Neil is a friend of Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) and a police officer. Neil takes a shine to Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon), who he knows Nathan is grooming. Wanting Bethany to himself, Neil pays Nathan a lot of money, but becomes impatient when Nathan repeatedly delays the date Neil can have sex with Bethany. Meanwhile, Neil becomes Craig Tinker's (Colson Smith) mentor at the station. Nathan pretends that Neil is part of his business at Supreme Tanning, and that it is his money that paid for all of Bethany's vlogging equipment. Nathan warns Bethany that she should be kind and polite to Neil, especially after a number of electronic goods supposedly belonging to Neil are stolen from the flat. Suggesting that Bethany make up the loss to Neil by going to dinner with him, Nathan later watches on and does nothing as Neil takes Bethany into the bedroom and rapes her. Neil, Nathan and the other members of the grooming gang are later arrested. Neil tells Craig that he was not actually part of the gang, he was just working undercover. Neil is found guilty of rape and sent to prison. Neil appeals his sentence and is visited by his daughter Kayla Clifton (Mollie Winnard), who believes that he is innocent and wants to prove it. Neil's appeal request is denied and he is later beaten up by some of the inmates, leading to his hospitalisation. Kayla confronts her father, having realised that he is guilty after all. She asks him to admit to his crime, but he refuses and she has to be restrained from hitting him. Kayla then disowns Neil and leaves. ==Leah Buckley== Leah Buckley, played by Molly McGlynn, is the stepdaughter of Gina Seddon (Connie Hyde), the sister of Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor).

Leah visits the Websters and asks Rosie and Sophie if Sally is okay. After Sophie tells Rosie about Sally's state, Rosie goes to see Leah and is surprised to spot her aunt, Gina, realising she is Leah's stepmother.

Sally and Tim force Leah to leave but she visits Gina, despite Gina telling Leah she loves Leah as much as her own children, Leah leaves. The return of Gina was announced in March 2017. Producer Kate Oates explained the circumstances of Gina's return, saying that Sally and Tim will face struggles and \"in the midst of all this, though, there will be another face from the Webster past making a return.

Seb is sacked by Phelan when Seb finds out Phelan has been reading articles about Nicola. Seb gets Nicola to meet him, pretending the reason he was sacked is because he thinks Phelan is dying.

Nicola soon finds out she is pregnant with Gary's baby and later goes to confide this secret to her mother's old neighbor: Lydia Hartman (Susan Twist). She then tells Lydia that Phelan is her biological father and shows her a photograph of being with him; this surprises Lydia, whom Nicola notices is left shaken by this - though Lydia covers up her worries by reassuring Nicola about her reaction. When Seb falls from a ladder and is hospitalized, Nicola ends up being in the same room as Anna and the two quickly bond over his situation as well as confiding to each other about their personal problems.

Nicola then visits Lydia, who reveals that Phelan raped her mother, and that this is how Nicola was conceived. Nicola then confronts Phelan at her parents' bench, where she continually brands him a rapist for what he did to her mother and Anna, and claims she never wants to see Phelan again. Nicola returns a few weeks later and makes amends with Phelan, but she lets Gary know that Seb is with her due to him finding out Phelan killed Luke Britton (Dean Fagan) and that she will bring Phelan down.

A source explained that \"Nicola is Seb Franklin's case worker. Phelan knew her mum but wasn't aware they had a child together\", but \"he recognises Nicola's surname, does the maths and realises the truth. The crux of the story is how she will react, because Nicola was in the dark too.\" Nicola's arrival \"will make Phelan take a good hard look at himself\", however, it's \"not certain anything can put Phelan on the straight and narrow.\" Nicola's \"head is understandably all over the place\" with the revelation that Phelan is her father and that Phelan's wife, Eileen, \"can see how much building a relationship with Nicola means to her husband.\" ==Summer Spellman== Summer Spellman, played by Matilda Freeman, made her first on-screen appearance on 16 June 2017.

Producer Kate Oates announced in May 2017 that the show had cast the role of Summer, calling the actress \"amazing\". She added that it \"should be an interesting sight\" seeing Todd as a father and says having \"two guys bringing up Summer [...] will be a very different dynamic.\" Brocklebank said that \"the dynamic\" of Billy and Todd's relationship \"will change\", although Brocklebank hopes that caring for Summer will bring Billy and Todd \"closer together.\" Brocklebank added that even though Billy and Todd did not have \"time to prepare for parenthood\", he hopes that their characters \"are spontaneous enough to be able to cope with the things that it throws at them.\" In August 2017, Freeman was longlisted for Best Young Actor at the Inside Soap Awards.
