    "text": "Nordfold is a former municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1906 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality surrounded the Nordfolda branch off of the Folda fjord in what is now Steigen Municipality, plus a small portion of the present-day S\u00f8rfold Municipality. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Nordfold, where the Nordfold Church is located. ==History== The municipality of Nordfold was established on 1 January 1906 when the old Nordfold-Kjerring\u00f8y Municipality was split into two new municipalities: Nordfold (population: 1,485) and Kjerring\u00f8y (population: 857). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Nordfold municipality ceased to exist. The eastern M\u00f8rsvikbotn district surrounding the M\u00f8rsvikfjorden in Nordfold (population: 268) was merged into the neighboring S\u00f8rfold Municipality. The rest of Nordfold (population: 1,212) was merged the following locations to create a new, much larger Steigen Municipality: the Brennsund area of Kjerring\u00f8y (population: 30), all of Leiranger Municipality (population: 1,397), a small part of Hamar\u00f8y Municipality (population: 77), and all of Steigen Municipality (population: 1,829). ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Nordfold, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council of Nordfold was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows: ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:Steigen Category:S\u00f8rfold Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:1906 establishments in Norway Category:1964 disestablishments in Norway ",
