    "text": "Halsfjorden is a fjord arm of Stokkafjorden in Vefsn municipality in Nordland. The fjord is 8 kilometres long to the village of S\u00f8rfjorden at the bottom of S\u00f8rfjorden. Fjorden has its entrance between Skonsengodden to the south and Merra and Halsneset to the north. The fjord runs easterly. Grenda Husvik lies on the north of the fjord. From Husvik, Alsneset goes southwards of the fjord, and from there, the fjord splits in three. Halsan heads north, Gryt\u00e5fjorden goes southeast, and S\u00f8rfjorden goes south. S\u00f8rfjorden is a few hundred metres longer than Halsan. == References== Halsfjorden at Norgeskart.no from Statens kartverk Category:Fjords of Nordland ",
