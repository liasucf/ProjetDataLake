    "text": "Happy Trails is a video game programmed by Carol Shaw for the Intellivision console and released by Activision in 1983. The player must navigate a character through a broken maze to collect gold. Shaw previously wrote River Raid for the Atari 2600. Happy Trails is a clone of the 1982 Konami arcade game Loco-Motion. Mattel was working on an official port, but Happy Trails was published first, resulting in Loco-Motion being sold at a discount and without any marketing support. ==Reception== Joystik magazine wrote, \"This is a great game.
