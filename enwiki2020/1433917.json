    "text": "Judith Scott (May 1, 1943 - March 15, 2005) was an internationally renowned American fiber sculptor. Judith was born into a middle-class family in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1943 along with her fraternal twin sister Joyce. Unlike Joyce, Judith was born with Down Syndrome. During her infancy, Judith suffered from Scarlet Fever, which caused her to lose her hearing, a fact that remained unknown until much later on in her life. At the age of seven, she was sent to an Ohio state institution where she remained until her sister became her guardian 35 years later. In 1987 Judith was enrolled at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, California which supports people with developmental disabilities.\"Entwined: Sisters and Secrets in the Silent World of Artist Judith Scott\" Beacon Press, Boston There, Judith discovered her passion and talent for abstract fiber art. An account of Scott's life, Entwined \u2013 Sisters and secrets in the life of artist Judith Scott has been written by her twin sister. ==Upbringing== Judith Scott spent her first seven and a half years at home with her parents, twin sister and older brothers. Although the developmental gap between the two girls was apparent, \"the parents consciously sought to treat these youngest members of the family alike.\"Joyce Wallace Scott: \"Entwined:Sisters and Secrets in the Silent World of Artist Judith Scot\" Beacon Press, Boston However, when it was time for the girls to start attending school, Judith was found to be \"ineducable.\" There was only one classroom for children with disabilities, and Judith was not able to pass the verbally-based entrance tests, due to her still undiagnosed deafness. Consequently, on medical advice, her parents placed Judith in the Columbus State Institution (formerly the Columbus State School), an institution for the mentally disabled, on October 18, 1950. This separation had a profound effect on both twins. The records from Judith Scott's first few years at the Institution indicate that she had an IQ of 30 (based upon oral testing before her deafness was recognized). For this reason she was denied any training opportunities. Deprived of her twin, Judith became severely alienated, and behavioral problems soon surfaced. Her Clinical Record states that \"She does not seem to be in good contact with her environment. She does not get along well with other children, is restless, eats messily, tears her clothing, and beats other children. Her presence on the ward is a disturbing influence.\" Soon after, she was moved to a smaller state institution at Gallipolis, Ohio. In 1985, after 35 years of complete separation and lengthy and difficult negotiations, Joyce Scott became her sister's legal guardian, and brought Judith to live with her in California, a state where all mentally disabled citizens are entitled to an ongoing education. Judith Scott died of natural causes at her sister's home in Dutch Flat, California, a few weeks short of her 62nd birthday. She outlived her life expectancy at birth by almost fifty years. ==Art== On April 1, 1987, Judith Scott began attending the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, one of the first organizations in the world to provide studio space for artists with disabilities. For almost two years, Judith showed little interest in any artistic activity. She was unexceptional with paint. She scribbled loops and circles, but her work contained no representational imagery, and she was so uninterested in creating that the staff was considering ending her involvement with the program. It wasn't until Judith casually observed a fiber art class conducted by visiting artist Sylvia Seventy, that she had her artistic breakthrough. Using the materials at hand, Judith spontaneously invented her own unique and radically different form of artistic expression. While other students were stitching, she was sculpting with an unprecedented zeal and concentration. Her creative gifts and absolute focus were quickly recognized, and she was given complete freedom to choose her own materials. Taking whatever objects she found, regardless of ownership, she would wrap them in carefully selected colored yarns to create diverse sculptures of many different shapes. Some resemble cocoons or body parts, while others are elongated totemic poles. Many of her works also feature pairs, reflecting Scott's experience as a twin. Judith worked on her art five days a week for eighteen years, producing over 200 pieces in total. Judith had her first exhibition in 1999, which coincided with the publication of John MacGregor's book Metamorphosis: The Fiber Art of Judith Scott. Together, these events helped propel her to worldwide recognition. Scott's work has become immensely popular in the world of outsider art, and her pieces sell for substantial sums.Artist Emerges With Works in a 'Private Language', by Evelyn Nieves, New York Times, June 25, 2001 Scott is now hailed as a contemporary artist, no longer just an outsider.\"Judith Scott - Bound and Unbound\" Brooklyn Museum, 2015 Her art is held in the permanent collections of many museums, including: Museum of Modern Art (Manhattan, New York), the American Visionary Art Museum (Baltimore, Maryland), Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA, Museum of American Folk Art (Manhattan, New York), Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art (Chicago, Illinois), Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, The Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA.

In the same year, Lola Barrera and I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1afiel released the feature-length documentary \u00bfQu\u00e9 tienes debajo del sombrero? (What's under your hat?) about Scott and Philippe Lespinasse released Les cocons magiques de Judith Scott, a documentary filmed a few weeks before Scott's death. In 2009, Scott Ogden and Malcolm Hearn produced the documentary Make that examined the lives and art-making techniques of Judith Scott and self-taught artists Royal Robertson, Hawkins Bolden and Ike Morgan. ==Exhibitions== Sculpture by Judith Scott Permanent exhibitions: * American Visionary Art Museum, Baltimore, MD * Collection de l'Art Brut, Lausanne, Switzerland * Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA * ABCD Collection (Art Brut Connaissance & Diffusion) Paris & Prague * Museum of American Folk Art, New York, NY * Intuit (The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art), Chicago, IL * Collection de l'Art Brut, Lausanne, Switzerland * Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland * The Museum of Everything, London, UK. * Oakland Museum of California, Oakland, CA. * Museum of Modern Art, NYC * Lille M\u00e9tropole Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne, d'art contemporain et d'art brut (LaM), Lille, France Former Exhibitions: 2017 * Viva Arte Viva, The 57th Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy, May 13 - November 26, 2017 * Inextricabilia, Maison Rouge, Paris, June 23 - September 17, 2017 2015 * Judith Scott\u2014Bound and Unbound, Brooklyn Museum, New York October 24, 2014 \u2013 March 29, 2015 * Le Maison Rouge/ABCD Paris * Forget Me Not: Judith Scott at Zuckerman Museum of Art, Kennesaw, GA, August\u2013December, 2015 * A Rare Earth Magnet, Derek Eller Gallery, Los Angeles, CA, July\u2013August * The Heart is a Lonely Hunter: Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco, CA, June\u2013August, 2015 2013 * Creative Growth: Dan Miller and Judith Scott, Louisville, KY, Sept. 2013 * Rosemarie Trockel: A cosmos, New Museum, New York, NY * Create: Exhibition at Boca Raton Museum of Art, Florida, 2013 * Extreme Art, The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, CT, March\u2013August, 2013 2012 * CREATE: Part II, Cantor Art Gallery \u2013 Oct 22- Dec 8, 2012 * UNRAVELED, Creative Growth, Oakland, CA, Oct-Nov 2012 * DOWNrightART Exhibition, United Nation s - A Celebration of World Down Syndrome Day, March 2012, New York, NY * Judith Scott at Richard Telles Fine Art, Los Angeles, CA * Perfect Man: White Columns, New York, NY * Everyday Abstract, Abstract Everyday, James Cohen Gallery, New York, NY * Rosemarie Trockel: a cosmos, Museo Nacional Centro Arte, Madrid, Spain 2011 Sculpture by Judith Scott * Create, UC Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley, CA * Objets Secrets.
