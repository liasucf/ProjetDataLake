He belonged to the Conservative Party of Nicaragua. He was born in Nandaime and was a member of the politically powerful Chamorro family. His father was Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Alfaro. ==Presidency== Diego was praised for his performance under president Adolfo D\u00edaz from both conservative and liberal politicians. Don Diego was elected President of Nicaragua in 1921, following his nephew Emiliano in that office. The elections faced significant interference from the United States, and was characterized by irregularities. His government faced hard times with questions of electoral fraud, and lack of legitimacy. During his presidency, he crushed an invasion by rebels from Honduras and initiated an agreement between himself and the presidents of Honduras and El Salvador to prevent such invasions in the future. He also signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship among the Central American countries. Like his predecessor, he continued being obsequious to United states.https://library.ucsd.edu/research- and-collections/collections/notable-collections/latin-american-elections- statistics/Nicaragua/elections-and-events-19071924.html The war had a negative impact on the Nicaraguan economy, which was in deep recession since his taking oath of office.https://www.ecured.cu/Diego_Manuel_Chamorro President Diego Manuel Chamorro died in office in 1923, in Managua, aged 62. ==Genealogy== He was married to his twice cousin Dolores Bola\u00f1os Chamorro and had 5 daughters and 3 sons: * Carmen Chamorro Bola\u00f1os, married to Clarence A.
