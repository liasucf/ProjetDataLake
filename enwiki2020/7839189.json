    "text": "A Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) is a proposal to create a free- trade agreement covering Europe and North America, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Such proposals have been made since the 1990s. Since 2013 an agreement between the United States and the European Union (EU) has been under negotiation: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. If an agreement is reached and ratified on both sides, it could at least in theory be expanded to include the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Canada and Mexico both have free trade agreements with both the EU and EFTA. == Current and pending trade agreements between proposed members == * Trans-Pacific Partnership (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam) \u2013 pending approval * North American Free Trade Agreement (US, Canada & Mexico) \u2013 took effect in 1994 * Canada\u2013European Free Trade Association Free Trade Agreement (Canada & EFTA) \u2013 took effect in 2009 * Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Canada & EU) \u2013 substantial parts are provisionally applied since September 2017 * Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and the European Union (Mexico & EU) \u2013 took effect in 2000 * Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and the European Free Trade Association (Mexico & EFTA) * European Economic Area (most of EU & EFTA) \u2013 took effect in 1994 * Various bilateral free trade agreements of Switzerland == EU-US trade == * Transatlantic Economic Council ==See also== * Free trade areas in Europe * List of bilateral free trade agreements == External links == * EU negotiations site * European Commission, DG Trade - In focus Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) * USTR Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership * The Transatlantic Colossus: Global Contributions to Broaden the Debate on the EU-US Free Trade Agreement A collaborative publication with over 20 articles on the global implications of the TAFTA | TTIP Transatlantic Category:United States\u2013European Union relations Category:Proposed free trade agreements Category:Treaties entered into by the European Union Category:Free trade areas Category:Canada\u2013European Union relations Category:Mexico\u2013European Union relations ",
