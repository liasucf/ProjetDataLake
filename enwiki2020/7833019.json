It is a quiet Riverina wheat town on the Burley Griffin Way, with characteristic silos, and functions primarily as a service centre for the surrounding agricultural area. ==History== An aerial view of Barellan in February 2014. The railway reached Barellan in 1908 and a post office was opened on 1 April 1909. The Commercial Hotel, \"a typically large and rather gracious hotel with an impressive upper verandah\", was built in 1924. Barellan was also the first town to have a Country Women's Association (CWA) rest house, built in 1924, the same year as the hotel. In 2009, Barellan celebrated its centenary. ===Demography=== Unlike many rural localities in the area, the population level has fluctuated over a number of years, evidenced as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=6|Selected historical census data for Barellan state suburb |- !colspan=3|Census year !!2001!!2006!!2011 |- |colspan=\"2\"|Population ||Estimated residents on Census night ||align=\"right\"|359 ||align=\"right\"|513 ||align=\"right\"|644 |- |} :Note : The data covers just the urban locality of Barellan, while the 2006 later data covers the urban locality and surrounding rural properties. == Heritage listings == Barellan has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Yapunyah Street: CWA Rest House ==Evonne Goolagong== Barellan is notable as the childhood home of the tennis-player Evonne Goolagong (now Evonne Cawley). There is a small plaque honouring her in the main street. Evonne Goolagong was born in nearby Griffith on 31 July 1951 and attended Barellan Primary School. Although Aboriginal people faced widespread discrimination in rural Australia at this time, Evonne was able to play tennis in Barellan from childhood thanks to Bill Kurtzman, a kindly resident, who saw her peering through the fence at the local courts and encouraged her to come in to play. Goolagong left Barellan to attend Willoughby Girls High School in Sydney where she developed her tennis-playing skills. ===The Big Tennis Racquet=== A long replica of a tennis racquet used by Evonne Goolagong has been built in Evonne Goolagong Park. Goolagong unveiled the exact scale model of the wooden Dunlop racquet during Barellan's centenary celebrations on 3 October 2009.Dennis Passa, NSW town makes a racquet for Goolagong', Brisbane Times, 3 October 2009 ==Barellan Central School== Barellan has a central school that goes from kindergarten to year 12 and has about 129 enrolled students.
