Norra Bankogr\u00e4nd (Swedish: \"Northern Bank Alley\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. Connecting Skeppsbron to \u00d6sterl\u00e5nggatan and J\u00e4rntorget, it forms a parallel street to Tullgr\u00e4nd and S\u00f6dra Bankogr\u00e4nd. The alley passes north of S\u00f6dra Bankohuset, the former building of the Bank of Sweden, constructed by the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder (1615\u20131684) during the period 1666\u20131682. On various maps it is recorded as Banco-gr\u00e4nden (1729) and Norra Bancogr\u00e4nd (1733). The part of the building facing Skeppsbron was rebuilt later. The covered bridge passing over the alley was added when the northern bank building was built during the 1770s. The bank moved to Helgeandsholmen in 1906. == See also == * List of streets and squares in Gamla stan == References == == External links == * hitta.se - Location map and virtual walk Category:Streets in Stockholm ",
