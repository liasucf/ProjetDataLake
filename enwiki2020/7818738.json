It is a translator of Cheyenne, Wyoming-licensed CTN owned-and-operated station KQCK (channel 39) which is owned by the Christian Television Network. KQDK's transmitter is located near East Iliff Avenue and South Emporia Avenue (near SH 83) in southeastern Denver; its parent station maintains studios on East Lincolnway (near US 30) in Cheyenne. ==History== The station was founded on October 30, 1990. In 2008, under Equity Media Holdings ownership, KQDK became an affiliate of the Retro Television Network (RTN). On January 4, 2009, a contract conflict between Equity and Luken Communications (which had acquired RTN in June 2008) resulted in many RTN affiliates losing the network's programming.What\u2019s Wrong with MyTV? As a result, Luken moved RTN's operations to its headquarters in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and dropped its affiliations on all Equity-owned affiliates, including the then-KQDK-CA, immediately.TV Newsday: \"Financial Dispute Disrupts RTN Diginet\", 1/5/2009. RTN would eventually sign with KCDO-TV that May. KQDK then switched its affiliation to AMGTV, and later to @SportsTV. KQDK was sold at auction to Valley Bank on April 16, 2009. Valley Bank, in turn, filed to sell KQDK and KQCK to an ownership group connected to Fusion Communications on September 9. KQCK/KQDK- CA logo during its affiliation with VasalloVision In January 2010, VasalloVision announced that it would affiliate with parent station KQCK. KQDK-CA was acquired by Casa Media Partners in April 2012. The station switched its affiliation to MundoFox on August 13, 2012. Concurrent with the launch of the station's digital signal, on February 12, 2013, the station modified its call sign to KQDK-CD. In late 2014, KQDK dropped MundoFox for the Christian Television Network. Casa Media Partners filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 14, 2015. On April 12, 2017, CTN's parent company, the Christian Television Corporation, agreed to purchase KQDK-CD outright for $750,000; CTN had earlier agreed to purchase sister station KQCK. The sale was completed on June 30, 2017. Sometime in 2019, KQDK-CD's city of license was moved from Aurora, Colorado to Denver. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
