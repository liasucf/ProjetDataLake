    "text": "Rudolf Haag (17 August 1922 - 5 January 2016Physikjournal 15 (2016) Nr. 4, 53 (obituary).) was a German theoretical physicist, who mainly dealt with fundamental questions of quantum field theory. == Biography == Haag's father, Albert Haag, was a Gymnasium teacher in mathematics. His mother was the writer and politician Anna Haag. Haag stayed in England at the beginning of World War II and was interned as an enemy alien in Canada, where he studied self-taught physics and mathematics. From 1946, he studied at the Technical University in Stuttgart, where he graduated as a physicist in 1948. In 1951 he received his doctorate at the University of Munich under the supervision of Fritz Bopp (Die korrespondenzm\u00e4\u00dfige Methode in der Theorie der Elementarteilchen) and completed his habilitation in 1954 (Zur relativistischen Quantentheorie wechselwirkender Teilchen). From 1951 to 1953, he was an assistant at the University of Munich (from 1954 as a private lecturer) and in 1953/54 he attended the theory group at CERN, which at that time was still based in CopenhagenPoggendorff Lit.-Biogr. Handw\u00f6rterbuch Exakten Wiss., 1958.. In 1956/1957, he worked with Werner Heisenberg at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in G\u00f6ttingen. After being a visiting professor at Princeton University and at the Universit\u00e9 de Marseille, he became professor of Physics at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Afterwards, he was professor for theoretical physics at the Universit\u00e4t Hamburg until his retirement in 1987. After his retirement, he moved to the Schliersee, where he worked on the concept of events in quantum physics until his death. Together with Res Jost, Haag was the founder and, from 1965 to 1973, the first editor of the leading journal Communications in Mathematical Physics. Among his students are: Huzihiro Araki, Detlev Buchholz, Volker En\u00df, Klaus Fredenhagen, and Bert Schroer. == Academic career == Even at the beginning of his career, Haag contributed significantly to the concepts of quantum field theory, including Haag's theoremHaag's theorem states that the usual Fock space representation cannot be used to describe interacting relativistic quantum fields with canonical commutation relations. One needs inequivalent Hilbert space representations of fields; see also Encyclopedia of Mathematics.. From this theorem it follows that the interaction picture of quantum mechanics does not exist in quantum field theory. Therefore, a new approach to the description of the scattering processes of particles was necessary, which he developed in the following years (Haag-Ruelle scattering theorySee e.g. the review Scattering in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory, .). During this work, he realized that the rigid relationship between fields and particles that had been postulated up to that point did not exist. The decisive factor for the particle interpretation is rather the Einstein locality principle, transferred to quantum field theory, which assigns operators to regions of spacetime. These insights found their final formulation in the Haag-Kastler axioms for the local observables of every quantum field theory. This framework uses elements of the theory of operator algebras and is therefore referred to as algebraic quantum field theory or, with a view to the physical content, as local quantum physics. This concept proved fruitful for understanding fundamental properties of any theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space. Without making assumptions about the existence of fields that are not directly observable (since they change the charge), Haag, in collaboration with Sergio Doplicher and John E. Roberts, has elucidated the possible structure of the superselection sectors of the observables in theories with short-range forcesThe only additional assumption to the Haag-Kastler axioms for the observables in this analysis was the postulate of the Haag duality, which was later established by Joseph J. Bisognano and Eyvind H. Wichmann in the framework of quantum field theory; the discussion of infinite statistics was also dispensed with.. Sectors can always compose, each sector satisfies either the para-Bose or para-Fermi statistics and for each sector there is a conjugate sector. These insights correspond to the additivity of charges in the particle interpretation, to the Bose-Fermi alternative for particle statistics and to the existence of antiparticles. In a special case (simple sectors) a global gauge group and charge-carrying fields could be reconstructed from the observables, the charged fields generate all sectors from the vacuum state. These results were later generalized for arbitrary sectors by Doplicher and Roberts (Doplicher-Roberts duality theorem). The application of these methods to theories in low- dimensional spaces also led to an understanding of the occurrence of braid group statistics and quantum groups. In quantum statistical mechanics, Haag, together with Nicolaas M. Hugenholtz and Marius Winnink, succeeded in generalizing the Gibbs-von Neumann characterization of thermal equilibrium states using the KMS condition (from Kubo, Martin, and Schwinger) in such a way that it also extends to infinite systems in the thermodynamic limit. It turned out that this condition also plays a prominent role in the theory of von Neumann algebras (Tomita\u2013Takesaki theory). This theory has proven to be a central element in structural analysis and recently also in the construction of concrete quantum field theoretical modelsAn overview of the construction of a large number of models using these methods can be found in: Gandalf Lechner, Algebraic Constructive Quantum Field Theory: Integrable Models and Deformation Techniques, pp. 397\u2013449 in: Advances in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, Springer, 2015.. Together with Daniel Kastler and Ewa Trych-Pohlmeyer, Haag also succeeded in deriving the KMS condition from the stability properties of thermal equilibrium states. Together with Huzihiro Araki, Daniel Kastler and Masamichi Takesaki, he also developed a theory of chemical potential in this context. The framework created by Haag and Kastler for studying quantum field theories in Minkowski space can be transferred to theories in curved spacetime. By working with Klaus Fredenhagen, Heide Narnhofer and Ulrich Stein, Haag made important contributions to the understanding of the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation. Haag had a certain mistrust towards what he saw as speculative developments in theoretical physics, but occasionally dealt with such questions. The best known is the Haag\u2013\u0141opusza\u0144ski\u2013Sohnius theorem, which classifies the possible supersymmetries of the S-matrix that are not covered by the Coleman\u2013Mandula theoremThe theorem of Sidney Coleman and Jeffrey Mandula excludes a nontrivial coupling of bosonic inner symmetry groups with geometric symmetries (Poincar\u00e9 group). The supersymmetry, on the other hand, allows such a coupling.. == Honors and awards == In 1970 he received the Max Planck Medal and in 1997 the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Prize. He was a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (since 1980) and the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences. He was a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. == Publications == * On quantum field theories, Matematisk-fysiske Meddelelser Kong.
