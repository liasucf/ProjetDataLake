    "text": "John \"Keoni\" Sai Keong Kauwe III (born April 10, 1980) is an American geneticist and academic administrator serving as the 11th president of Brigham Young University\u2013Hawaii (BYU\u2013Hawaii), a position he has held since July 1, 2020. Kauwe served previously as chair of the Department of Biology and as dean of Graduate Studies at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He is a researcher who specializes in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. == Early life and education == The oldest of seven children, Kauwe was born in Provo, Utah, to John Sai Keong Kauwe Jr. and Rhonda Beth King Kauwe. He is of mixed ethnicity, including Native Hawaiian (k\u0101naka maoli), Chinese, Portuguese, Maori, and Northern European ancestry. He was raised in Orem, Utah, and Hawaii, graduatinghttps://themolokaidispatch.com/mhs-alum-named-byu- hi-president/ from Moloka\u02bbi High School (formerly Molokai High and Intermediate School) in Ho\u02bbolehua, Hawaii in 1996. He earned a bachelor's degree in molecular biology (1999) and master's degree in population genetics (2003) at BYU. From 1999 to 2001, he served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Japan Fukuoka Mission. He received a PhD in evolution, ecology and population biology in 2007 from Washington University in St. Louis, where he also completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Alzheimer's disease genetics at the Washington University School of Medicine in 2008. == Career == Kauwe joined the BYU faculty in 2009 and obtained the rank of full professor in 2018. Kauwe served at BYU as chair of the Biology Department (2018 to 2019) and as dean of Graduate Studies (2019 to 2020). Kauwe has been the principal investigator on two multicenter grants from the National Institutes of Health Institute on Aging that have included international and multi-institutional collaborations. In 2014, he served as the scientific lead for the international Alzheimer's disease Dream Challenge, a computational crowdsourced project to assess the capabilities of predicting cognitive outcomes in Alzheimer's disease based on high dimensional, publicly available genetic and structural imaging data. Over 3,000 submissions were received and more than 500 scientists worldwide from more than 50 institutions and 10 countries participated in the challenge. This project, an invaluable first-of-its kind contribution, provided a snapshot of both the strengths and limitations in big data analytics of Alzheimer's research. On May 12, 2020, Jeffrey R. Holland, chairman of the Executive Committee of the BYU\u2013Hawaii Board of Trustees, announced that Kauwe would succeed John S. Tanner as the institution's president on July 1, 2020. === Research === Kauwe's professional focus has been primarily studying Alzheimer's disease genetics using a variety of study designs and approaches. He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed papers in the past decade including publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Nature Genetics, PNAS, and PLoS Genetics. He is a Senior Editor for the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia and was a panelist for the 2015 National Institutes of Health Summit on Alzheimer's disease Research. He currently holds a position on the Scientific Program Committee for the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. He has had continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health National Institute on Aging since 2012. Kauwe has mentored over 100 undergraduates in his research lab. His research efforts have been conducted with an intentional focus on outreach to populations that are underrepresented in biomedical science. === Service === His recent work in linking the Utah Population Database and Cache County Studies and developing reliable methods for pedigree identification has led to important findings about the relative risk for Alzheimer's disease and novel factors for its resilience. Since 2013, he has served as the Principal Investigator of Rheumatic Relief, a comprehensive program for public health education, screening, and genetics research designed to prevent and reduce suffering caused by rheumatic heart disease in Samoa. The program has also provided training to indigenous medical professionals. As of 2019, the Rheumatic Relief team, which includes over 50 people each year, has screened more than 20,000 Samoan children for rheumatic heart disease and published significant findings from the first genome-wide association study of rheumatic heart disease susceptibility. He also conducts research on the genetics of other human traits and diseases (height, biomarkers of inflammation) as well as work on de novo genome assembly and population genetics of marine fish, including bonefish, giant trevally, and bluefin trevally. Kauwe has an ongoing relationship with Moloka\u02bbi High School, including funded projects to provide scientific mentoring experiences and resources to teachers and students. He also speaks frequently to communities and academic organizations that serve underrepresented populations, including recent engagements in Samoa, Hawaii, and Alaska. == Personal life == Kauwe married Monica Shana Mortensen in 2003 and they have five children. Kauwe is a direct descendant of Kaleohano, who was among the first Native Hawaiians baptized into the LDS Church by George Q. Cannon in the early 1850s. ==Sources== ==External links== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American biologists Category:Alzheimer's disease researchers Category:American geneticists Category:American Mormon missionaries in Japan Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Brigham Young University faculty Category:Human geneticists Category:Latter Day Saints from Hawaii Category:Native Hawaiian scientists Category:People from Molokai Category:People from Orem, Utah Category:Washington University in St. Louis alumni ",
