She is known from her burial next to the pyramid of king Amenemhat II at Dahshur. The burial was found intact and contained a decorated wooden coffin and canopic box with longer religious texts including her name. Some personal adornments were found in the tomb too.Jacques de Morgan et al.: Fouilles a Dahchour 1894-1895. Volume II, Holzhausen, Vienna 1903, pp. 71\u201374 The location of the tomb might indicate that she was a daughter of Amenemhat II, but a final proof is missing.Biri Fay: The Louvre Sphinx and Royal Sculpture from the Reign of Amenemhat II, von Zabern, Mainz 1996, , pp. 45. Remarkable is the wooden statue of a swan found in her burial apartments.de Morgan: Fouilles a Dahchour 1894-1895.
