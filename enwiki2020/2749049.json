    "text": "The Brazilian Women's Articulation (in Portuguese Articula\u00e7\u00e3o das Mulheres Brasileiras) is a Brazilian feminist organization that links women's organizations in Brazil's 26 states and its federal district. It was created to organize the Brazilian feminist movement's preparation and follow-up to the 1995 Beijing Women's Conference. In 2008, the AMB organized video conferences in order to publicise and promote awareness of the Lei Maria da Penha, a Brazilian anti-domestic violence law. ==References== ==External links== * AMB website - in Portuguese * CRONOLOGIA FEMINISTA - in Portuguese Category:Feminism in Brazil Category:Political advocacy groups in Brazil ",
