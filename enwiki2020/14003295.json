    "text": "Firekind was a comics strip published in the British weekly anthology comic 2000 AD for 13 issues in 1993. It was written by John Smith, with art by Paul Marshall. ==Publication history== Firekind came about as part of the \"Spring Fever\" promotion at 2000 AD after a change in distribution saw a big drop-off in sales.Bishop (2007) pages 158-159 The assistant editor Alan McKenzie had contacted John Smith and suggested he might want to write a story involving dragons to make up for the lack of fantasy in the comic. According to Smith: The story was originally serialised in 2000 AD from issues #828 to #840. Part 7, however, which should have appeared in issue #834, was accidentally omitted. According to John Tomlinson, another assistant editor: Paul Marshall spotted the error but the production staff were running sufficiently far-ahead that they were putting together issue #839 and the missing episode had to be run after the final installment. The story was entirely reprinted in its proper order in 2000 AD Extreme Edition #8 (2005). ==Plot synopsis== The self- contained story concerns a human xeno-botanist named Larsen who travels to the alien jungle planet Gennyo-Leil whose atmosphere is a toxic hallucinogen. Though he initially gains the inhabitants' trust, his mission is compromised by the arrival of a merciless gang of mercenary poacher / torturers. But Gennyo-Leil is not without defences... James Cameron's film Avatar, released sixteen years later, has a number of similarities with Firekind. (Archived by WebCite\u00ae at ).
