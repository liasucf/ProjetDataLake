    "text": "The John Lewis & Partners Christmas advert is a television advertising campaign released by British department store chain John Lewis & Partners and since 2019, also Waitrose & Partners in the build-up to Christmas. John Lewis & Partners launched their first Christmas advert in 2007. It has since become something of an annual tradition in the UK, and one of the signals that the countdown to Christmas has begun. The adverts tend to attract widespread media coverage and acclaim upon their release. Since 2019, the advert has promoted both John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners. The songs used in the advertising campaigns are (excluding 2018) covers of existing songs by different artists. They have often reached high positions on the UK Singles Chart, and the original versions often receive a sales boost. Ellie Goulding, Gabrielle Aplin, Lily Allen, Aurora, Tom Odell and Vaults are among the artists whose music has appeared in a John Lewis Christmas advert. In 2018, Sir Elton John became the first artist to perform and star in the advert. London-based agency Adam & Eve/DDB have conceived the adverts since 2009. The adverts have led to some fierce competition, most notably from Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and Boots. ==Campaigns== ==Official singles== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Release date !
