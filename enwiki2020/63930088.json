Nandu (Skanda) is an unemployed graduate who is suffering because he was unsuccessful in getting a job and is about to attempt suicide. A man convinces him that he will give Nanu money if he kills Satya (Sachin Khedekar). Nanu later wakes up and realizes that all of this was a dream. Although it was a dream, whatever he dreamt so far happened in real life. He uses what he learned from his dream to fall in love with his girlfriend, Madhu (Kalyanee), and save Satya from the killer. == Cast == * Skanda as Nandu * Kalyani as Madhumathi Satyanarayana * Sachin Khedekar as Satya * Venu Madhav * Brahmanandam * Krishna Bhagavaan * Ravi Prakash * Fish Venkat * Melkote * Apoorva * Dr. Bharath * Master Bharath == Production == Raaj Aditya, who previously directed Pourudu (2008), directed this film.
