    "text": "The Murtuza Mukhtarov mosque () is a mosque in Baku, Azerbaijan. == History and facts == Construction of the mosque was initiated in 1901 by local residents. Due to material deficit, construction was suspended. The residents asked Murtuza Mukhtarov for financial aid. Mukhtarov hired several architects (including the main architect Ziver-bey Akhmedbekov) and took over the construction costs. Construction lasted for 8 years and was completed in 1908. The mosque was used as a weaving workshop in the Soviet Union. Between 1985 and 1989, it was used as a hall for an exhibition of works of Sattar Bahlulzade. Since 1989, the building has functioned as a mosque. Mukhtarov gave a Quran with golden Arabic calligraphy to the mosque as a special gift. It weighs 25 kilograms. The mosque has two minarets that are 47 meters tall. Each has 140 steps. The mosque also has a prayer room for women. Murtuza Mukhtarov's grave is located in the courtyard of the mosque.
