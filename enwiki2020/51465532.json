Yeung of AllMusic said \"Honing in on contemporary production trends, \"Words\" sounds like a tropical-influenced relative of something from Justin Bieber's Purpose or Sia's 'Cheap Thrills'.\" Buzznet's Tina Roumeliotis stated \"'Words' leaves a haunting Banks meets Bieber (believe it or not) feel in the air, making us curious as to what the next album may entail, despite it being way too soon to tell.\" ==Live performances== Daya performed \"Words\" at the 2016 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016\u201317) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Worldwide | October 7, 2016 | Digital download | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | November 15, 2016 | Top 40 radio | | |- |} ==References== Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:Daya (singer) songs Category:Songs written by Melanie Fontana Category:Songs written by Jonas Jeberg ",
