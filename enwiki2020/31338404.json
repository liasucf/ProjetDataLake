Singapore were the defending champion, but failed to qualify from the group stage. Thailand won the tournament 4\u20133 in a two-legged final against Malaysia, with manager Kiatisuk Senamuang being the first man to win the competition as a player then manager. ==Hosts== Singapore and Vietnam were declared as co-hosts at the AFF Council on 3 April 2013. Initially the Philippines and Indonesia were also considered as possible co-hosts. ==Venues== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !colspan=2| Kallang, Singapore !colspan=2| Hanoi, Vietnam |- | National Stadium | Jalan Besar Stadium | M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium | H\u00e0ng \u0110\u1eaby Stadium |- | Capacity: 55,000 | Capacity: 8,000 | Capacity: 40,192 | Capacity: 22,500 |- | National Stadium | Jalan Besar Stadium | M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium | H\u00e0ng \u0110\u1eaby Stadium |- |colspan=4| |- !

It was to involve the five lower ranked teams in the region, with games taking place between the dates of 12\u201320 October 2014. In August 2013, Football Federation Australia became a full member of the AFF, thus making them eligible to compete in the ASEAN Football Championship starting with this edition of the tournament. However, Australia had no plans to compete against lower-ranked teams in AFF Championship and that they would continue to play in future editions of the EAFF East Asian Cup. ===Qualified teams=== The following eight teams qualified for the tournament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country !

Other incidents occurred soon during the first semi-final between Malaysia and Vietnam in Shah Alam Stadium, where some of the Malaysian fans were seen pointing green laser lights on the field, as recorded on the match video in television camera. The laser incident is a continuation from Malaysian hooligans, as it also happened during the previous edition of AFF Championship semi-final against Vietnam and in the final against Indonesia in 2010. At the end of Malaysia 1\u20132 loss to Vietnam, some Malaysian hooligan fans began attacking Vietnamese fans, resulting in injuries. The hooligans rushed to assault Vietnamese fans, who tried to flee and had no intention of fighting back. Bottles, smoke bombs and other dangerous objects continued to get thrown even after the Royal Malaysia Police arrived at the scene to quell the scuffles. This was heavily criticised by the Vietnamese side for the rioting shown by some of the Malaysian supporters. As a result, the website of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) had been hacked in a denial of service attack, perhaps from Vietnam. Other Malaysian supporters together with the Malaysia Minister of Youth and Sports, Khairy Jamaluddin condemn the hooligan fans attitude and has offer their apologies to all Vietnamese fans, adding that five of the perpetrators had been arrested. Another nine people's was arrested for the same offence between 11\u201312 December. The Philippines team received a death threat before their 2nd semi- final match against Thailand. Sources say the threat has something to do with the scuffle during 1st leg between Filipino defender Amani Aguinaldo and Thai striker Adisak Kraisorn, which led to Adisak being red-carded and suspended for the 2nd leg. In the semi-final between Malaysia and Vietnam, the Vietnam had won the first-leg in Malaysia with a 2\u20131 score. However, in the second-leg played in Hanoi, Vietnam lost 2\u20134, thus losing 4\u20135 on aggregate with Malaysia advancing to the finals. After that defeat, the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) launched a probe into the defeat, citing potential match-fixing due to the seemingly apathetic performance of the players compared to the first-leg. However, the AFF said that the match was not fixed and went on to say that through Swiss-based sports integrity specialist Sportradar, no unusual betting had taken place during the match. ==References== ==External links== * Tournament Website The Official Tournament Website * ASEAN Football Federation The Official Federation Website Category:AFF Championship AFF Championship AFF Championship AFF Championship 2014 2014 ",
