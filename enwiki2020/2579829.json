    "text": "Viva, born as Janet Susan Mary Hoffmann (August 23, 1938), is an American actress, writer and former Warhol superstar.Watson, Steven (2003), \"Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties\" Pantheon Books, pp. 342-348 ==Life and career== Viva was born in Syracuse, New York, the daughter of Mary Alice (n\u00e9e McNicholas) and Wilfred Ernest Hoffmann. Hoffmann was the eldest of nine children born into a family of strict Roman Catholics. Her father was a prosperous attorney, and her parents were stalwart supporters of the Army\u2013McCarthy hearings held to expose Communist government infiltration. The Hoffmann children were required to watch the televised proceedings. Raised in devout Catholicism, she considered becoming a nun. Viva began her career in entertainment as a model and painter. She retired from both professions however, claiming that she believed painting to be a dead medium, and describing her time as a model as \"...a period of my life I would rather forget.\"\"Viva Viva Viva\". Women's Wear Daily [New York] February 29, 1968: 10. Print. She was given the name Viva by Andy Warhol before the release of her first film but later used her married last name (Auder). She appeared in several of Warhol's films and was a frequent guest at the Factory. Viva's film career began in 1967, when she began filming Ciao! Manhattan, which was not completed until 1972. Viva approached Andy Warhol about being in one of his films, on the suggestion of her friend, actress Abigail Rosen McGrath. Warhol agreed, but only on the condition that Viva take off her blouse for the role. Viva responded by adhering bandaids to her breasts and visiting Andy at The Factory. Viva appeared in many of Warhol's films. The first, Tub Girls, consists of Viva lying in a bathtub with various people of both sexes, including Brigid Berlin and Rosen McGrath.Tub Girls, IMDb.com, August 2015. She appeared in Bike Boy, a film centered around a motorcyclist trying to find himself;\"'Bike Boy' Opens at the Hudson Theater\", The New York Times, October 6, 1967, pg. 31 and The Nude Restaurant, in which she played a waitress, opposite Taylor Mead.Viva Hoffman. \"Warhol Superstar Viva Remembers Andy, His Mother & The Artist's Early Brush With Death\", Bio.com, August 11, 2015. By far, Viva's most controversial role was in Blue Movie (1969), a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn that helped inaugurate the \"porno chic\" phenomenon in modern American culture. Viva played opposite Louis Waldon. The film consists of improvised dialogue between Viva and Waldon about a multitude of topics, including The Vietnam War, President Nixon, and various mundane tasks. These conversations are interrupted by the main event of the film, in which Viva and Waldon actually perform sexual acts in front of the camera. The film was seized by New York City Police for obscenity, and the theater manager, projectionist, and ticket-seller at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre arrested for possession of obscene materials. Viva was on the phone with Andy Warhol when he was shot by Valerie Solanas in 1968.The Shot That Shattered The Velvet Underground Village Voice June 3, 1968 Following Solanas' attempt on Warhol's life, Viva developed a close, personal friendship with Warhol's mother, Julia Warhola. Returning from the hospital, however, Andy accused Viva of utilizing his absence to spy on his work and his mother, creating a rift in a relationship that was never repaired. Viva never saw Mrs. Warhola again after that. Viva's first starring role in a non-Warhol film was in Agn\u00e8s Varda's Lions Love in 1969. The film features Viva in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Gerome Ragni and James Rado.Armes, Roy. \"Three Women Directors.\" London Magazine February 1, 1970: 104-08. Print. On November 1, 1968, Viva appeared on The Tonight Show on an evening that was guest-hosted by Woody Allen. Four years later Allen cast her in his 1972 film Play It Again, Sam in the role of Jennifer. Blake Gopnik points out in his Warhol (book) that she had a bit role as happening/party giver, standing in for Warhol who was recuperating in the hospital, in John Schlesinger's film Midnight Cowboy.Blake Gopnik, Warhol: A Life as Art, London: Allen Lane. March 5, 2020. p. 629 After she began making films for other directors she also began writing. Her first book, Superstar, was an insider's look at the Factory scene, a partly fictional autobiographical account of her time there. It was distinguished from other \"tell-all\" memoirs by virtue of her writing, which incorporated various stylistic effects, including the use of taped conversations. She also wrote for various publications, including The Village Voice and New York Woman. Viva incorporated the use of video tapes into her second book The Baby. These tapes were later released by her former husband, video artist Michel Auder, as Chronicles: Family Diary in three parts. She was the narrator for Carla Bley's 1971 experimental jazz composition Escalator over the Hill. Viva was one of the early pioneers in video art. During the 1970s Viva was a guest participant in Shirley Clarke's Teepee Video Space Troupe, which she formed in the early 1970s. ==Personal life== With former husband Michel Auder, Viva made and kept film diaries which included the birth of her first daughter, Alexandra (Alex) Auder. She was briefly engaged to the actor Anthony Herrera. They had one child together, the actress Gaby Hoffmann. Though artistically successful, Viva was never very successful financially. In 1993, she was taken to housing court by the Chelsea Hotel, where she lived with her two daughters, for not paying her $920 a month rent for two years.Speers, W. \"Basinger Told to Pay $8.9 Million for Quitting Film.\" Philadelphia Inquirer March 25, 1993: n. pag. Print. Her daughter, Gaby, reflects, \u201cWe lived in a classless society. We\u2019d spend a summer at Gore Vidal\u2019s house in Italy, but we were on and off welfare.\u201dBrodesser-Akner, Taffy. \"The Chelsea Hotel Had Its Own Eloise.\" The New York Times July 8, 2013: n. pag. Print. Viva wrote a book about Gaby called Gaby at the Chelsea, a riff on Eloise at the Plaza, as yet unpublished. Viva currently lives in Palm Springs, California, where she paints landscapes. == Filmography == *The Nude Restaurant (1967) The Waitress *Bike Boy (October 1967) Girl on couch *Tub Girls (1967) *Lonesome Cowboys (1968) Ramona D'Alvarez *San Diego Surf (1968) Susan Hoffman *The Loves of Ondine (August 1968) Girl in Bed *Lions Love (1969) Viva *Blue Movie (1969) Girl in Bed *Sam's Song (1969) Girl with the Hourglass *Midnight Cowboy (1969) Gretel McAlbertson \u2013 The Party *Keeping Busy (1969) *Trapianto, consunzione e morte di Franco Brocani (1969) *Necropolis (1970) Countess Bathory (as Viva Auder) *Cleopatra (1970) Cleopatra *Play It Again, Sam (1972) Jennifer *Ciao!
