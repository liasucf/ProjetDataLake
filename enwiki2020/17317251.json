It is a short, low-lying shrub with minuscule thorns lining its stems like hairs. Its leaves are sensitive, meaning that, when touched, they close quickly, similarly to Mimosa pudica. It can be differentiated from Mimosa pudica in that its leaves are bipinnate, there are more than four subbranchlets and these originate from more than one point on the branch. Mimosa somnians's leaflets are 4-5 mm long. The flowers form pink balls. It propagates by seeds. ==Forms, subspecies and varieties== *Mimosa somnians f. viscida *Mimosa somnians subsp. longipes *Mimosa somnians subsp. viscida *Mimosa somnians var. aquatica *Mimosa somnians var. deminuta *Mimosa somnians var. diminuta *Mimosa somnians var. glandulosa *Mimosa somnians var. lasiocarpa *Mimosa somnians var. leptocaulis *Mimosa somnians var. longipes *Mimosa somnians var. lupulina *Mimosa somnians var. possensis *Mimosa somnians var. somnians *Mimosa somnians var. velascoensis *Mimosa somnians var. viscida ==Uses== In Guyana, it is used to calm down irritable children via washing.
