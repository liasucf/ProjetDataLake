Fillol was always the image of professionalism and seriousness; \"Madman\" Gatti, on the other hand, looked eccentric, unorthodox. ==Trivia== At the 1978 World Cup, Fillol wore the number 5 jersey, instead of 1 which is the standard for goalkeepers. This happened because Argentina, at that time, gave players their numbers alphabetically. The number 1 jersey was worn by offensive midfielder Norberto Alonso. For the same reason, Fillol wore the number 7 jersey at the 1982 tournament while Osvaldo Ardiles (another midfielder) wore the number 1. This practice was last permitted in 1986, when FIFA stated that the number 1 shirt should only be worn by goalkeepers. ==Honours== ===Club=== Fillol celebrating the 1988 Supercopa Libertadores won with Racing Club ;River Plate *Primera Divisi\u00f3n (7): 1975 Metropolitano, 1975 Nacional, 1977 Metropolitano, 1979 Metropolitano, 1979 Nacional, 1980 Metropolitano, 1981 Nacional ;Flamengo * Ta\u00e7a Guanabara (1): 1984 * Ta\u00e7a Rio (1): 1985 ;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a (1): 1985 ;Racing Club * Supercopa Sudamericana (1): 1988 ===National team=== ;Argentina *FIFA World Cup (1): 1978 ===Individual=== *Footballer of the Year of Argentina (1): 1977 *FIFA World Cup All-Star Team (1): 1978 *Silver ball South American Player of the Year (3): 1978, 1983, 1984 *AFA Team of All Time (published 2015) ==See also== *Ubaldo Fillol Award ==References== ==External links== *Fillol official Twitter * * *Biography at planetworldcup.com *Biography Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Buenos Aires Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentinos Juniors footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate footballers Category:Racing Club de Avellaneda footballers Category:Quilmes footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield footballers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:La Liga players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:1974 FIFA World Cup players Category:1978 FIFA World Cup players Category:1982 FIFA World Cup players Category:1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:Argentina international footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Brazil Category:Argentine beach soccer players Category:Argentine football managers Category:Racing Club de Avellaneda managers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentine people of French descent Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Brazil Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Spain ",
