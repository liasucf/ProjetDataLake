The township was amalgamated in 1975 from two historic county townships, Blandford and Blenheim. == Communities == The town of Blandford-Blenheim comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Blandford, Blandford Station, Blink Bonnie, Bond's Corners, Bright, Canning, Chesterfield, Creditville, Drumbo, Eastwood, Etonia, Forest Estates, Gobles, Maple Lake Park, Park Haven, Perry's Corners, Plattsville, Princeton, Ratho, Richwood, Showers Corners, Washington, Windfall and Wolverton. == Demographics == Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 census * Population in 2016: 7399 * Population in 2011: 7359 * Population in 2006: 7149 * Population in 2001: 7630 (or 7442 when adjusted to 2006 boundaries) * Population in 1996: 7455 (or 7409 when adjusted to 2001 boundaries) * Population in 1991: 7266 Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 2616 (total dwellings: 2716) == Attractions and cultural resources == === Drumbo Public Library === On June 10, 2005 the Oxford County Library Board closed the Drumbo branch. When letters of appeal and a public meeting organized by Carl McLean failed to reverse this decision, the Access Committee Group \u2013 Robbie Savage, Valerie Johnston and Paul Jacobson \u2013 was formed to maintain a community library with internet access. A new entity, the Drumbo Opportunity Centre, was born. This group applied for charitable status, approached the County of Oxford for use of the library building and applied to the Community Access Program. Charitable status was granted in June 2006 and a lease with the County (for rent and connectivity) was signed in May 2006.

A century later the area was being used for hunting grounds primarily by the Mississaugas First Nation, and it was from them that the land was acquired by the Crown through two treaties, the first signed in 1784, and the second in 1792. known as the Between the Lakes Treaty, it corrected an error in the earlier treaty which failed to properly describe the western boundary intended. The names of Blandford and Blenheim were given in the 1790s as part of Gov. Simcoe's program to make the new colony of Upper Canada a \"mirror of Britain\", using place names familier from England. Upon his arrival in the province in 1792, the first proclamation issued by Gov. Simcoe, while still at Kingston, announced the names and boundaries he had decided upon for county boundaries. For areas lying to the west of Kingston, he decided that the sequence of names for counties along Lake Ontario would be Northumberland, Durham, York and Lincoln, and for counties along Lake Erie, the names became Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent. (This was the same sequence of county names in place along the eastern seacoast of England, running from the Scottish boundary down to the English Channel.) The proclamation defined the northern boundary of Norfolk County as being the Thames River, but the area which became Blandford and Blenheim was originally designated as being part of the western end of York County for election purposes.Proclamation of July 16, 1792 circa 1800 map of townships following creation of Oxford County Gov. Simcoe with several other government officers, guided by a party of Six Nations warriors, conducted a wilderness tour on foot down and back up the length of the Thames River in February 1793 and decided to assign additional place names to mirror those they knew along the Thames River in England. Middlesex County was the name to be used for the area around a town site reserved at the \"lower forks\" in the river, to be called London; Dorchester was the name for a town site at the \"middle forks\"; and the area around the \"upper forks\" was to be Oxford - the same sequence of names as found along the Thames in England. Just as in Oxfordshire in England, Blandford and Blenheim were names at the northerly end of the county, around Woodstock, adjacent to the towns of Oxford and Burford. When legislation was passed in 1798 in Upper Canada to implement these new divisions by Gov. Simcoe, Norwich and Dereham were separated from Norfolk County and added to the new Oxford County, which included also Burford, Blenheim, Blandford and Oxford townships. Blenheim Township was opened up to settlement in 1793 when Gov. Simcoe agreed it should be granted to Thomas Watson from New Jersey who promised to bring in settlers and build mills. This was the start of what became the life's work of his nephew Thomas Hornor, who with Watson's son Thomas Jr. and various others were active developing a settlement around Princeton by 1795. Within the course of the next decade, Hornor was appointed a justice of the peace, then as the land registrar for the county, then as the resident commanding officer for the county militia. He carried on as a leading citizen of the county until his death from cholera in 1834.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hornor_thomas_6E.html Blandford Township was held in reserve by the government until a village began to develop along its southern end in the early 1830s, which took the name Woodstock.Thomas Shenston, Oxford Gazetteer (Hamilton, 1852) The official town plot was surveyed in 1834 by the prolific Crown surveyor Charles Rankin. == Historical events == In 1890, a body was found in a Princeton swamp that would lead to the Reginald Birchall murder trial that took place in Woodstock, Ontario.
