    "text": "Arthur Avenue, a Little Italy in the Bronx, New York Little Italy is a general name for an ethnic enclave populated primarily by Italians or people of Italian ancestry, usually in an urban neighborhood. The concept of \"Little Italy\" holds many different aspects of the Italian culture. There are shops selling Italian goods as well as Italian restaurants lining the streets. A \"Little Italy\" strives essentially to have a version of the country of Italy placed in the middle of a large non-Italian city. This sort of enclave is often the result of periods of immigration in the past, during which people of the same culture settled together in certain areas. As cities modernized and grew, these areas became known for their ethnic associations, and ethnic neighborhoods like \"Little Italy\" blossomed, becoming the icons they are today. ==List of Little
