Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions.PW, \"Stallius\". ==Origin== The nomen Stallius seems to be of Oscan derivation, as most of the Stallii found in inscriptions came from Campania and adjoining regions in southern Italy. The first of the Stallii appearing in history bore the distinctly Oscan praenomen Sthenius. ==Praenomina== Besides the early instance of Sthenius, the Stallii mentioned in epigraphy all bore very common praenomina, including Gaius, Marcus, Quintus, Publius, and Lucius. ==Members== * Sthenius Stallius, a general of the Lucanians against Thurii in 285 BC.
