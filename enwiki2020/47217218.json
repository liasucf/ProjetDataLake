Broadcasting on 88.7 FM, XHJX is the local transmitter for Radio F\u00f3rmula programming. ==History== XEJX- AM 1450, later 1250, signed on air on October 11, 1941, after receiving its concession on July 8 of that year. General Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Familiar, a former governor of the state of Quer\u00e9taro, obtained the concession through the company Radio Emisora Queretana, S. de R.L. In 1949, the company added a new station, XENA-AM 1450 (now XHNAQ-FM 104.9). In 1962, XEJX and XENA moved to new facilities in Quer\u00e9taro, inaugurated by Governor Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Cossio, known as the Edificio Desarrollo Radiof\u00f3nico (Radio Development Building). The building later came to serve as the company's namesake. The station was known as \"Radio D\u00f3lar\", referring to the then-exchange rate of one U.S. dollar for 12.5 pesos. In the 1980s, the station became \"La Divertida 1250\", but the Radio D\u00f3lar name returned in 1988 only to disappear again in 1993. Later on, the station turned toward various other formats: talk Antena 1250 and later grupera-formatted Radio Lobo Quer\u00e9taro, a franchise of the Celaya station. In 1999, three months after changing formats to romantic music, Desarrollo Radiof\u00f3nico (later renamed Multimundo Radio) sold XEJX to Organizaci\u00f3n Radio F\u00f3rmula, which changed its format to Radio F\u00f3rmula programming. XEJX carried the Segunda Cadena of Radio F\u00f3rmula with some local programs. In 2012, XEJX began direct operation from Mexico City, and the FM station launched. On April 11, 2014, 1250 AM went off the air permanently. ==References== Category:Spanish-language radio stations Category:Radio stations in Quer\u00e9taro Category:Radio F\u00f3rmula ",
