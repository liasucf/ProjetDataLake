Scenes of Yamin singing in a wallpapered room are intercut into the video. There are scenes of Yamin driving through streets and walking on a sidewalk, trying to find the girl he loves, at the same time many signs he pass say \"Amazing\". At the third verse, he is singing in a totally white room, wearing white clothes and surrounded by a few chandeliers. His lover comes into the room and they kiss. Then the scene of Yamin walking on the sidewalk returns, and he finds his lover and they kiss once again, and separate and smile at each other. Yamin is chasing the girl he loves in this video, opposed to waiting for her, like he did in the \"Wait for You\" video. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2007 singles Category:Elliott Yamin songs Category:Song recordings produced by Stargate (record producers) Category:Pop ballads Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:Songs written by Espen Lind Category:Songs written by Tor Erik Hermansen Category:Songs written by Mikkel Storleer Eriksen Category:Song recordings produced by Espionage (production team) Category:Songs written by Amund Bjorklund Category:2007 songs ",
