By 1864 the old church was in such a dilapidated state that it was unsafe to enter. The new church was designed by the architect Samuel Rollinson of Chesterfield. The foundation stone was laid by Rev. H.K. Cornish, vicar of Bakewell, on 31 May 1864 and built by Mr. Gyte of Ashford. It was consecrated on 7 October 1864 by the Bishop of Lichfield. ==Parish status== The church is in a joint parish with: *All Saints\u2019 Church, Bakewell *Holy Trinity Church, Ashford-in-the-Water *St Anne's Church, Over Haddon *St Katherine's Church, Rowsley ==References== Sheldon Sheldon Category:Churches completed in 1864 ",
