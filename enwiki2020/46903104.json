Most of the buildings in the street date from the years after the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The Carlsberg Foundation is headquartered at No. 5. ==History== Gedde's district map of Copenhagen The street was originally called Benickestr\u00e6de. In 1543, it is referred to as Per Broliggers Str\u00e6de. The name refers to Per Jensen \"Brol\u00e6gger\" who from 1486-1510 owned the lot where No. 14 stands today. He was the first master cobble layer in Copenhagen. His son, Jens Brol\u00e6gger, was mayor of Copenhagen from 1520. The Taylors' Guild was for a while based where No. 4 and 6 stand today. Their building was also used as a venue for German comedies. From the 1650s, the street was also home to breweries. Knabrostr\u00e6de connected the south side of the street to the coast at Gammel Strand. Endel\u00f8sstr\u00e6de (\"Endless Alley\"), a short cul-de-sac, extended northwards a little further to the east. When the street was rebuilt following the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, Knabrostr\u00e6de was extended northwards to Vimmelskaftet and Endel\u00f8sstr\u00e6de was later connected to its east side. In 1795, the street was destroyed by the second great fire that hit Copenhagen. Endel\u00f8sstr\u00e6de disappeared when the houses were rebuilt. ==Notable buildings and residents== All the buildings in the street date from the years immediately after the fire of 1795 and all of them are listed on the Danish registry of Protected buildings and Places. The gate at Brol\u00e6ggerstr\u00e6de 11 Carlsberg-founder J.C. Jacobsen's first brewery, known as Bryggerg\u00e5rden, is located at No. 5. The complex also comprises Knabrostr\u00e6de 11 and 13 as well as several interconnected rear wings. It was built 1796-99 for another brewer, Nicolai Rindom. J. C. Jacobsen's father, Christian Jacobsen, purchased the brewery in 1826. A plaque above the gate commemorates J. C. Jacobsen and his son Carl Jacobsen. The inscription reads: \"Brygger, dr.phil. Carl Chr. H. Jacobsen f\u00f8dtes her den 2den marts 1842. Brygger, kaptajn J. C. Jacobsen foretog her \u00e5ret 1838 de f\u00f8rste fors\u00f8g med fremstilling af underg\u00e6ret \u00f8l\". The building was refurbished by the architect Viggo Steen M\u00f8ller in the early 1950s and now houses the Ny Carlsberg Foundation. Brol\u00e6ggerstr\u00e6de 2 The brick building at No. 11 on the opposite side of the street was built for another brewer, Andreas Tronier. A brass plaque to the left of the gate commemorates the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions which had its first home in the building from 1898 until 1950.
