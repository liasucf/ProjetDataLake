    "text": "\"Icy\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by South Korean girl group Itzy from their debut EP, titled It'z Icy. It was released by JYP Entertainment as the lead single on July 28, 2019. ==Composition== \"Icy\" was written by J. Y. Park and Penomeco. It has been described as a \"fiery and energetic summer song that promotes the quintet's passions about music.\" In a showcase, Itzy described the song as an extension of the group's first record, \"Dalla Dalla,\" sharing similar meanings but having a more festive and upbeat air. The pre-chorus lyrics, consisting of lines such as \"Icy but I'm on fire\" and \"Look at me, I'm not a liar,\" serves as the lead-up to the dynamic chorus of the song, and according to Billboard's Tamar Herman, \"may as well be the girl group's anthem.\" ==Critical reception== Pop Crush included \"Icy\" in their best songs of 2019 list, writing that \"it's a song that should sound overwhelming in theory, but instead is balanced perfectly with strong vocals, creating an effervescent dance track that empowers listeners to be confident and believe in themselves.\" ==Music video== The music video for the title track was released at midnight of the same day and accumulated 18.1 million views within 24 hours. The music video was ranked at No. 7 on 2019 YouTube's Most Popular Music Video in South Korea, the group's second song to enter the list, with \"Dalla Dalla\" ranked in second place. As of August 2020, it has over 170 million views and 2,6 million likes on YouTube. ==Chart performance== \"Icy\" debuted at No. 11 of the Gaon Digital Chart, later peaking at No. 10 the second week, giving the group their second top ten song. \"Icy\" also debuted at No. 2 of the Gaon Download Chart. It also peaked at number 1 and 7 on the Billboard K-pop Hot 100 and World Digital Song Sales charts, respectively. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japan (Japan Hot 100) | 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Philippines (Philippine Hot 100) | 38 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Singapore (RIAS) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| South Korea (Gaon) | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\"| South Korea (K-pop Hot 100) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US World Digital Song Sales (Billboard) | 7 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| South Korea (Gaon) | 99 |} ==Accolades== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center\" |+Year-end lists !Critic/Publication !List !Rank !Ref. |- |YouTube | Top 10 Most-viewed Music Videos of 2019 within South Korea | 7 | |- |} ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
