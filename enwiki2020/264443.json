    "text": "True is the third studio album by the English new wave band Spandau Ballet. It was released on 4 March 1983 on Chrysalis Records. While Spandau Ballet's first two albums earned them European popularity, True made them worldwide stars and was heavily influenced by jazz, soul and R&B.; It reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, the Top 20 on the US Billboard 200, and charted in numerous other countries around the world. The title track spent four weeks at number 1 in the UK Singles Chart and went to number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was also Spandau Ballet's first album to be recorded outside of London (at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas). Other singles from the album included \"Gold\" (a no. 2 UK hit and a Top 30 hit in the US), \"Lifeline\", \"Communication\", and \"Pleasure\". Later album releases by the band never equalled the success of True. A remastered version of \"True\" was released on 3 July 2003 to commemorate its 20th anniversary. It was re-released as a single CD with the original eight tracks along with the music video for \"Gold\" and some home video footage of the band. The original 8-track album was also issued on the high-resolution super audio CD format as a Hybrid SACD (in stereo only). In 2008, the album was given away free with copies of the Daily Mail newspaper. In June 2010, a special edition was released on 2 CDs and DVD as part of the 2010 Spandau Ballet reissues series, featuring remastered 12\" remixes and B-sides, plus a live concert. ==Tracklisting== ==Personnel== *Tony Hadley \u2013 vocals *Gary Kemp \u2013 guitars, piano, synthesisers, vocals *Martin Kemp \u2013 bass, vocals *Steve Norman \u2013 saxaphone, percussion, vocals *John Keeble \u2013 drums, vocals ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1983/4) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|4 |- |Canada |align=\"center\"|8 |- |New Zealand (RIANZ) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |United Kingdom (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard 200 |align=\"left\"|19 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:Spandau Ballet albums Category:Albums produced by Jolley & Swain Category:Chrysalis Records albums ",
