    "text": "Revan () is a fictional character in the BioWare video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, in which they are the playable protagonist. They also appear in related media in the now non-canonical Star Wars Legends continuity. Revan is a former Jedi who turned to the Dark Side of the Force and became the Sith Lord Darth Revan, forming their own Sith Empire alongside their best friend and fellow Sith Darth Malak to contend with the army of the Old Republic. Following a battle, Revan was left with amnesia, which the Jedi used to their advantage, brainwashing them and leaving them with a false Jedi identity to serve their cause. Revan's true identity isn't revealed to the player until later in the game, prior to which the playable protagonist lacks any predefined identity and \"Darth Revan\" is believed to be dead. Revan (who is, per above, not identified as such during the character creation process) is customized by the player in terms of appearance, sex, and actions; canonically, Revan follows the light-side path during the events of the game, and is male in Star Wars Legends continuity. Revan's story is further explored in Drew Karpyshyn's 2011 novella Star Wars: The Old Republic: Revan. The book details the events of Revan's life after the events of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, in which Revan attempts to recover their lost memories from the period of the Mandalorian Wars and from their travels alongside Malak to discover the Sith empire, both ultimately revealed to have been captured and previously brainwashed by the Sith Emperor prior to the first game's events, Revan themselves captured towards the end of the novel, sacrificing themselves to hide the diminished state of the Jedi.Karyshyn, Drew. (2011) Star Wars: The Old Republic: Revan. Del Ray, USA. In the massively multiplayer online game Star Wars: The Old Republic, a corrupted remnant of Revan serves as the titular antagonist of the Shadow of Revan expansion. The character was voiced by Rino Romano in Knights of the Old Republic and by Jeff Bennett in Star Wars: The Old Republic. ==Appearances== ===Legends works=== ====Knights of the Old Republic series==== Revan is depicted as a former Jedi who, along with Alek (later Darth Malak), left the Order to lead the fight in the Mandalorian Wars due to the Jedi's inaction. One year after the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Darth Revan returned to Republic space at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Calling themselves the Sith, they declared war on the Republic. Since their intention was to unite the galaxy under one ruler so they could attack the ancient Sith Empire, they avoided attacking key places such as Coruscant, Onderon, and Dantooine. The Sith won the battle and as the Dark Lord prepared to battle with the Jedi who boarded their flagship, Darth Malak, in the hopes of destroying both Revan and Bastila Shan (as well as the Jedi accompanying her), betrayed his Master, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge. Though Malak believed himself to have been successful in killing Revan, they survived. Revan, severely injured from the turbolaser blasts, was then taken by Bastila Shan and her Jedi strike team to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine where the Jedi Council members chose to wipe Revan's memory, and imprint them with a false identity that the player creates at the beginning of the game. Knights of the Old Republic begins with Revan awaking on a starship under attack. Throughout the game, Revan learns of their forgotten history and assembles a band of followers as they search for \"Star Maps\" that lead them back to the Star Forge, which Revan used to make their army. Revan encounters Malak, who tells Revan of their former identity as a Sith lord. At one point Malak captures Bastila and turns her to the dark side. Her ultimate fate depends on player choices. In the game, the player can choose whether to turn Revan to the dark side or the light side of the Force. Regardless, Revan confronts Malak at the game's conclusion. According to canon, Revan returned as a Jedi Knight who stopped the Sith forces under Malak's control and destroyed the Star Forge. The last scene of the game's canonical ending shows the principal characters, including Revan, being honored by the Republic at the site of the temple on Rakata Prime; a picture of later events has emerged from subsequent games and novels. The sequel Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords reveals that a year after the defeat of Malak, Revan recalled a threat from their time as the Dark Lord, and left known space to deal with it. Clues to the nature of the threat emerge from in-game dialogue with non-player characters (including Canderous and Kreia); this varies according to alignment and sex. Prior to the events of the sequel, Revan bade farewell to the nine comrades who had accompanied them on their quest, knowing that none whom they loved could safely accompany them in the places they had to walk; the only NPC with certain knowledge of where and why (their navigation droid, T3-M4) won't say. Also, at the ancient tomb of Ludo Kressh in Korriban, the Jedi Exile fights a silent vision of Darth Revan, in which they appear to wield two lightsabers, one red and one violet. The game lists the color crystal of the lightsaber the player obtains from them as a unique red color. This is Revan's only appearance in the entire game. Additionally, the Jedi Exile can speak with several companions and non-player characters within the game to learn more about the history of Revan, and their journey into the Unknown Regions. ====The Old Republic: Revan==== Revan appears as the primary focus of Star Wars: The Old Republic: Revan, a tie-in book to Star Wars: The Old Republic that was released by Bioware and EA on December 20, 2011. ====The Old Republic==== Revan re-emerges in Star Wars: The Old Republic after a team of Republic heroes manages to rescue them from the Emperor's Maelstrom Prison with the help of the ghost of the Jedi Exile. It is learned that they were kept alive for centuries as a prisoner by the Emperor to channel Revan's strength in the Force. Revan's link with the Emperor was two-way, however, and they were able to keep the Emperor's darker urges in check, thereby preventing the Emperor from unleashing his full power upon the galaxy before the Republic and Jedi Order had grown enough again to be able to stand a chance against the Sith Empire. Though thankful to the Republic for rescuing them, Revan decides to fight the Emperor on their own terms and takes control of a Rakatan installation called \"The Foundry\" and engineers a droid army (led by HK-47) programmed to identify and eliminate any target with Sith DNA, which not only included Dark Lords of the Sith but also the majority of citizens of the Empire. Revan's plan is thwarted when a group of Imperials manages to infiltrate the Foundry and destroy the droid army and HK-47 before confronting Revan. After a vicious battle, Revan is defeated but disappears before a killing blow can be delivered. Revan appears again in the \"Legacy of Rakata Prime\" flashpoint as the mastermind behind the conspiracy in the \"Forged Alliances\" plotline. They are the primary antagonist of the fourth digital expansion to The Old Republic, entitled Shadow of Revan. During the digital expansion, Revan returns to destroy the Republic and Empire. They lead a group of followers, called Revanites, into infiltrating both galactic powers and influencing them into annihilating each other. Some Republic and Imperial forces also declare themselves for Revan. Revan then draws the Empire and Republic into a battle with his Revanite ships over the planet Rishi, so that neither the Republic nor the Empire can interfere when they confront the Emperor. However, their plan is thwarted when the player's character sends a communication to Republic and Imperial ships informing them of Revan's plan and to cease fire. Revan later is cornered on Yavin 4 where they try to raise the Emperor but is confronted and defeated by the player and an alliance of Republic and Imperial characters. After the Emperor makes his presence known and leaves Yavin 4, an apparition of Revan appears and reveals that when they were defeated in the Foundry, their light side became one with the Force, but their dark side, fueled by hate for the Emperor, survived, setting off the \"Forged Alliances\" plotline. The two sides of Revan, one Jedi, the other Sith, then reunite, and their now whole spirit warns the player and his allies that they must un-do what they have done or the Emperor will see his evil plans through and everything will be lost. ====Other appearances==== Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, Revan appears as a holographic avatar for a holocron discovered by Darth Bane. In celebration of KotOR 15th anniversary, Electronic Arts added Jedi Knight Revan to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes as a playable character on October 18, 2018. Months later, their Sith version, Darth Revan, came to the game as the first unlockable Dark Side mythic character, then followed by Darth Malak. ===Canon works=== Revan was originally slated to appear in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. In the third-season episode \"Ghosts of Mortis,\" Revan would have appeared as a Sith Lord alongside Darth Bane as advisors to the Son, a dark side embodiment. Revan was cut from the episode in late production since their presence would conflict with Lucas' view of the Force at the time.Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Complete Season Three The visual dictionary guide for the 2019 film Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker contains a reference to one of the Sith Eternal's legions being named after Darth Revan. ==Relationships== ===Mentorship tree=== ==Merchandising== In 2007, Hasbro toys released an action figure of Darth Revan. Revan received the second-highest number of votes in the 2006 ToyFare Fan's Choice Poll to determine the most requested Star Wars action figure. The highest number of votes was for Quinlan Vos, a Jedi who appeared in comic books and who Hasbro had already slated to be released in 2007 before the poll was conducted.
