    "text": "\"Never Leave You\" is a song composed and performed by Tinchy Stryder. The song, written by Taio Cruz is the fourth single from Stryder's second studio album, Catch 22 as a digital download on 2 August 2009 and then as a CD single on 3 August 2009. It features guest vocals by Amelle Berrabah, a member of British girl group, the Sugababes and received airplay on many radio stations in the UK including BBC 1Xtra. \"Never Leave You\" has also reached \"The A-List\" on the BBC Radio 1 playlist. The music video was released on Stryder's official website on 24 June 2009. The song immediately rushed into the UK and Ireland charts, charting at #1 in the UK and #2 in Ireland. The song knocked The Black Eyed Peas's song \"I Gotta Feeling\" off the UK top spot on 2 August 2009, but failed to knock \"I Gotta Feeling\" off the Irish top spot, and charted behind it. ==Background== \"Never Leave You\" is a midtempo alternative hip hop-Europop song with grime influences. The song was originally picked to be Stryder's first single from his album Catch 22, but \"Number 1\" was chosen instead. The song was Amelle's first solo release outside of the Sugababes. The song became Stryder's second number 1 single from Catch 22. It also became Amelle's first number one single as a solo artist making her, to date, the only member of the Sugababes to achieve a number one single outside of the group. ==Writing and inspiration== On the surface \u2018Never Leave You\u2019 is about Stryder telling a girl how he\u2019s going to be with her forever, but beneath the surface its sentiments are directed towards his original fans, his East London roots, to grime music and to memories of growing up in his neighbourhood. According to the producer Fraser T Smith, \"it's a song about success and staying true to yourself.\" ==Critical reception== \"Never Leave You\" received positive reviews from music critics. David Balls from Digital Spy said: \"Rewind eight months and the name Tinchy Stryder would have been met with blank expressions by all but a core of grime fanatics in East London. Now, having bypassed the critics and trend-setters, the rapper has become one of the year's biggest success stories thanks to a winning combination of pop hooks and hip-hop rhymes. Building on the momentum of his recent chart-topper 'Number One', Stryder's back with summer smash-in-waiting 'Never Leave You'.\" \"It finds him sticking to the Europoppy sound of his previous singles, but this time he's drafted in his starriest sparring partner yet - Sugababes singer Amelle Berrabah. He powers through the verses in his distinctive London twang, she croons the glorious chorus, and Fraser T Smith keeps the production as fresh and sharp as a grapefuit breakfast. Stryder may have started the year as the so-called \"Prince of Grime\", but... wait for it... he's fast establishing himself as the King of the Charts.\" and he gave the song four out of five stars.Digital Spy reception to Never Leave You ==Promotion== Stryder and Amelle performed the song together for the first time at BBC Sound.
