    "text": "\"Sexy MF\" is a song by Prince and The New Power Generation from their 1992 album Love Symbol.http://www.discogs.com/Prince-The-New-Power-Generation-Sexy- MF/release/463407 The song and its refrain \"You sexy motherfucker\" caused some controversy,Sexy M.F. Video Review, Entertainment Weekly, July 24, 1992 and edited versions were produced for radio, the music video and the US version of the album. The song was released as the first single from Love Symbol, with \"Strollin'\", from the previous year's Diamonds and Pearls, as a B-side. In the United Kingdom, the CD single also contained a third track, \"Daddy Pop\", also from Diamonds and Pearls. \"Sexy MF\" was recorded in Paisley Park Studios' Studio A. The song is a merger of \"old school\" funk and modern R&B; music. The song also carries a strong Hip-Hop influence in Prince's delivery of the lyrics. The song is built around the bass, drums and guitar. Added to this is a consistent electric rhythm guitar undertone and horn stabs from the NPG Hornz. Throughout the song, the horns are given the chance to shine, along with a sax solo from Brian Gallagher. Musical solos are also provided by Levi Seacer, Jr. (guitar) and Tommy Barbarella (organ) who Prince mentions in the song's lyrics (\"Tommy Barbarella in the house\", \"Come here, Tommy. Yeah!\", and \"Levi... Levi... Fly\"). The music and most of the lyrics were composed by Prince, while Seacer came up with the chorus and the song's title. Tony M. delivers a rap which he wrote. It has been covered by the Dave Matthews Band as an outro from their song \"Jimi Thing\". ==Recording== While specific recording dates are not known, basic tracking took place in early December 1991, at Paisley Park Studios, Chanhassen, MN, USA (during the same set of sessions that produced \"Love 2 The 9's\", \"The Sacrifice Of Victor\", \"The Morning Papers\", \"Arrogance\", and \"And God Created Woman\"). \"Sexy MF\" was placed as the opening track of the Symbol album for a while, until Prince later added the track \"My Name Is Prince\", recorded a few months previously. It was included as the third track (second song) on the March 1992 and Summer 1992 configurations of Love Symbol, before the Album Intro segue was removed. ==Critical reception== Music Week commented, \"The prodigious Prince is back with Sexy M.F. It's a very sparse, basic groove not dissimilar to those churned out by James Brown in the Sixties, with lyrics that are alternately facile and controversial, the latter of which will keep airplay to a minimum. His fan base is such that it should, however, make significant inroads into the chart.\" Johnny Dee from Smash Hits noted the \"grunting and grinding in the usual Paisley Park sassy funk style with some gorgeous jazzy brazz-n-stuff\". ==Chart performance== The song was released in an edited version in the US, where it peaked at number 66 on the Hot 100 chart and number 76 on the R&B; chart. In the UK, the song sold significantly better, peaking at number 4. ==Single formats== The single was available in multiple formats, including a Love Symbol-shaped vinyl disc. It was also included on The Hits 2, which was also a part of The Hits/The B-Sides. In addition, the \"My Name Is Prince\" maxi single included a club mix of \"Sexy MF\". ==Cover versions== Dave Matthews Band have been known to play a rendition of \"Sexy MF\" (specifically the \"sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass\" line) during live versions of their song \"Jimi Thing\", then in 2016, after Prince's death, began playing a shortened version of the actual song, segued from Jimi Thing. Bruno Mars covered the song for his Moonshine Jungle Tour. Rammstein Guitarist Richard Kruspe sung a lyric of the song during their Festival Tour in 2016. Ween played a shortened version of the song during their show at the Charlottesville Pavilion on April 20th, 2017. Hometown band Phat Phunktion covered this song during a benefit at Funk Out Cancer benefit the High Noon Saloon, Madison WI 2013. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1992) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |8 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Greece (Pop + Rock) |3 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi) |4 |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Spain (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|12 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1992) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |82 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop) |82 |- !scope=\"row\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |67 |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |48 |- !scope=\"row\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) |24 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Prince (musician) songs Category:1992 singles Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Songs written by Prince (musician) Category:Paisley Park Records singles Category:Warner Records singles Category:Obscenity controversies in music Category:Song recordings produced by Prince (musician) Category:1992 songs ",
