In the following 2015\u201316 season, while in his final season of junior with the Wildcats, Garland was signed to a three-year entry-level contract by the Coyotes on December 24, 2015. Garland joined the Coyotes American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners, for the 2016\u201317 season.
