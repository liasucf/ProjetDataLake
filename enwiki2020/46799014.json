Born in Hanau, he was the fourth child and only son of Philipp Charles, Count of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau and his first wife Caroline Amalie, a daughter of Johann Dietrich, Count of Kunowitz. ==Life== After the death of his father in 1736, he inherited all the Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau lands jointly with his two surviving half-brothers, but because they are minors at that time, Johann William ruled alone over all the territories. Johann William died suddenly in Hildburghausen aged 35 while visiting his older sister Caroline Amalie, Duchess consort of Saxe-Hildburghausen, and was buried in Michelstadt. Because he never married or had issue, his half-brothers inherited the Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau lands.Johann Wilhelm, Graf zu Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau in: geneall.net [retrieved 25 May 2015]. ==Notes== Category:Counts of Germany Category:House of Erbach Category:1707 births Category:1742 deaths Category:18th-century German people ",
