She now runs an educational charity, Vinjeru. == Early years == She grew up in a devout Christian family in Kayiwonanga in Mzimba.\"Malawi's first female writer, Walije Gondwe!\" The Nation, 30 October 2011. Some years after leaving school she started secretarial training and won a scholarship to complete her studies in the UK. Because of political problems in Malawi the scholarship became invalid but Gondwe stayed in the UK. == Writing == Gondwe began writing in England. Her book called Will the African Flowers Bloom, due to be published in London in the 1970s, was abandoned when a branch of Oxford University Press ran into difficulty.Caroline Davis, Creating Postcolonial Literature: African Writers and British Publishers, Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.
