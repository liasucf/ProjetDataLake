    "text": "\"Scared to Be Lonely\" is a song recorded by Dutch DJ Martin Garrix and English singer Dua Lipa. It was released on 27 January 2017. Garrix premiered the song at the AVA Festival 2017 in Myanmar in January for New Year. \"Scared to Be Lonely\" is included on the Complete Edition of Lipa's eponymous debut studio album. The first volume of the official remix EP for the song was released on 17 March 2017, featuring remixes from Brooks, DubVision, Zonderling, Alpharock, Funkin Matt, and Julien Earle. The second volume of the official remix EP was released on 24 March 2017, featuring remixes from Gigamesh, Medasin, Loud Luxury, Conro, LOOPERS and Joe Mason. The artists released an acoustic version of the song on 7 April 2017. == Background == The song was described by Garrix as a follow-up to his 2016 collaboration \"In the Name of Love\" with American singer Bebe Rexha. Garrix described that the song gives the same euphoric feeling (as \"In the Name of Love\") and has 'deeper lyrics', which he thought was important. === Artwork === The artwork was released on 19 January 2017. The artwork has the two artists (Garrix and Dua Lipa) standing side-by-side on a hill with the title text right above them. Garrix is standing to the right, looking left at Dua Lipa on the artwork, similarly to \"In the Name of Love\". ==Music video== The official music video of the song was released at the same day through Martin Garrix's YouTube channel. It was directed and written by Blake Claridge, produced by Craft London and Lois Newcombe, and was accompanied with the release of the single. The video has over 530 million views as of March 2020. == Composition == The song was written by Garrix along with Giorgio Tuinfort, Nathaniel Campany, Kyle Shearer, Aziza Guseynova and Georgia Ku featuring the vocals from British singer Dua Lipa. The song was described as a 'pretty pop-heavy' track with a big build and a 'playful' synth hook. The song was compared to another one of Garrix's singles \"In the Name of Love\" with Bebe Rexha, as it was similar to the latter with future bass bassdrop and 'poppy' female vocals. == Track listing == ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Dua Lipa: Complete Edition. ===Recording and management=== * Recorded at The Record Plant (Hollywood, California) / Studio Strings Attached (Collendoorn, NL, USA) * Published by Universal Polygram Int.
