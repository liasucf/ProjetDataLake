    "text": "Seria () is a town on the north-east coast of the island of Borneo, in the Bruneian district of Belait. It is the birthplace of the country's petroleum industry, where oil was struck here in 1929. Seria is governed as a municipality (), as well as two village-level subdivisions under the mukim of the same name. The postcodes of Seria include KB1133 and KB4733. == History == Seria was originally known as Padang Berawa which is Wild Pigeon's Field in Malay. \"Berawa\" is also Javanese for \"swamp\". The place is known to be swampy before it was developed into an oil town. According to the Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam, the name 'Seria' was given by the British authorities, an acronym for the South East Reserved Industrial Area. The Industrial Area is located near the place where oil was first discovered in the area in 1929. The correctness is however doubtful given the fact that Seria is geographically located in the north west of Brunei and not the south east. What is known too is that the nearby river that flows into the South China Sea near the site at the beach where oil was first discovered is then and to this day still called \"Seria\". More correctly, the town took its name from the river. The first commercial oil well Non-commercial quantities of oil were discovered in the Jerudong area and in the Labi area before 1929 was spudded in 1929 in Padang Berawa on the west bank of the Seria river (Sungai Seria).The river has since changed its course since then so that the first well is on the eastern side of the mouth of the river. Due to beach erosion the location of the first well is also underwater for part of the day and is only located on land during low tide. The name of the river has since lent its name to the town that grew up supporting the oil industry Seria area was gazetted as a municipal area in 1936. The town came under the authority of the Kuala Belait Sanitary Boardnow the Kuala Belait/Seria Municipal Board, or Lembaga Bandaran Kuala Belait dan Seria in Malay, with a Seria branch office at Lorong Bolkiah which also had responsibility for the municipal area of Kuala Belait. The first landing of the Japanese invasion force during World War II in Borneo was at Seria where the Left Flank of the Kawaguchi Detachment came ashore about 04:40 on 16 December 1941, nine days after Pearl Harbor. They were faced with a scene of devastation of the oilfields due to \"Operation Denial\" carried out by employees of the British Malayan Petroleum Company (now Brunei Shell Petroleum) and the 2nd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, and British Army Royal Engineers. The invasion force continued oil drilling units and restoration of the oilfields began immediately under Sato, Chief Engineer. Over the next three years, the Japanese restored production to nearly pre-war levels, the activity being hectic as other sources of supply to the Japanese war machine were closed off, so much so that most of the oil fueling the Japanese in the last six months of the war came from Seria. Operation \"Ha-Go 2\", the Japanese denial exercise commenced on 10 June 1945, the day of the Australian liberation forces landing at Muara. The fires could be seen 100 km out to sea. When the Australian 9th Division as part of Operation Oboe Six eventually entered Seria on 29 June 1945, the situation was chaotic, with 38 oil well fires, demolished buildings and wrecked installations. By 17 August 1945, when American fire fighting teams (Patton and son) arrived, 26 of the fires had been put out by oilfield staff assisted by a detachment of the Australian Royal Engineers. By November, production was restored, albeit stored in temporary tanks, and oil export to Lutong recommenced on 11 December 1945. Seria was also one of the centres of a small rebellion against the monarchy on 8 December 1962, which was suppressed by the British Army. This event became known as the Brunei Revolt.Brunei Uprising - retrieved 04-06-2007 Under the rule of His Majesty the late Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, the town blossomed as commercial buildings such as the current shophouses along Jalan Sultan Omar Ali. ==Location== Map of Brunei Seria is located in the Belait District, in the mukim of the same name.

Seria is the heart of the oil industry in Brunei, and also the site of the first commercial onshore oilfield discovered in Brunei. The town sits atop the Seria Field, which was discovered in 1929 and has been continuously in production since then with the exception of short periods after the Japanese invasion and Allied liberation of Brunei in the Second World War. There are numerous nodding donkeys in and around the town and this has become the unofficial symbol of the town. Pumpjack located in Seria near the Billionth Barrel Monument. Reports circulate of a major oil well blowout in 1953, which resulted in well liquids flowing out of fissures in the ground. (Cited in Tingay 'et al.', \"Present-day Stress orientation in Brunei...\", Jnl.Geol.Soc.Lond. vol. 162 pp39\u201349, 2005) This has led to inevitable comparisons with the LUSI mud volcano in Java, which has been flowing from 2006 to the time of writing. The Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) Company Limited is headquartered in Panaga and has various facilities related to the oil and gas industry in Seria. The Seria Refinery is the only refinery in Brunei and is located in the Sungai Bera area together with the Seria Crude Oil Terminal(SCOT), the New Gas Compression Plant(NGCP) and the New Industrial Area(NIA). The open-air oil water treatment facility at the Sungai Bera Holding Basin has since been discontinued due to environmental reasons. ==Tourist attractions== The Billionth Barrel Monument * Pekan Seria Mosque - the first mosque in Brunei to have a dome in its architectural design * The Oil and Gas Discovery Centre - an interactive museum run by Brunei Shell Petroleum * The Billionth Barrel Monument - commemorating the billionth barrel of crude oil produced from the Seria Field. * The roundabout at the intersection of Jalan Maulana and Jalan Tengah. * The roundabout at the intersection of Jalan Maulana and Jalan Utara.

Craig Adams of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins was born in Seria, though raised in Calgary, Alberta. Adams won a Stanley Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006, and with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009. == Power Generation == Electricity used to be locally generated with a natural gas fired power plant. This has since been demolished and replaced with a solar plant, with a generation capacity of 1.344 MWh. Local demand is higher than the generation capacity and electricity from the Lumut Power Plant is sent to Seria. The solar installation is the only functioning clean energy source in Brunei to date (November 2013). == Climate == The Seria Coast has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. ==Transportation== ===Road=== Most of the roads within the municipality are surfaced. However, not all the roads are level to encourage effective drainage during a downpour. The main commercial street in the municipality is Jalan Sultan Omar Ali and shops and other commercial buildings can also be found in the vicinity. Seria is connected by roads west through Panaga towards Mumong and Kuala Belait, east through Sungai Bera and Anduki to Lumut, Labi and Bandar Seri Begawan and south besides the Housing Scheme area towards the Seria Bypass. The main highway from the Malaysian border west of Kuala Belait to Muara Town passes south of the municipality. This section is known as the Seria Bypass. The taxi stand and bus depot is located at the south-east quarter of the intersection between Jalan Sultan Omar Ali and Jalan Bunga Pinang. Taxis fares start from B$3.00. Tourists are advised to negotiate the price for the trip before hiring the taxis. There are three scheduled bus services from the bus station, these are: * a regular shuttle towards Kuala Belait (B$1-one way) - thrice hourly except lunch and at night. There are three routes, Laluan 1, Laluan 2 and Laluan Keliling Kuala Belait. * hourly to Bandar Seri Begawan (B$6-one way) - the last bus departs at about 3:10pm * an intermittent service to Sungai Liang (These are correct as of July 2011) ===Rail=== There are no working railways or light rail in Seria. The route and remnants of a wooden railway from Seria to Badas that was built by the British Malayan Oil Company (now Brunei Shell Petroleum) before the war to service the water supply to Seria from the Badas pumping station on the Sungai Belait are still visible. BMP staff hid essential components of the railway from the Japanese during World War II who therefore were unable to restore it so it fell into disrepair. When the liberation forces of the Australian 9th Division arrived, these components miraculously re-appeared and the railway was quickly restored to action to carry two 25 pounder guns and ammunition to Badas, to harry a Japanese contingent that was still in the area. George William Percival Clark ran the pump station before, during and after the war. He was also president of the Shell Recreation Club in Seria in 1951. Two of his daughters, Patsy and Gracie, were drowned in the Badas river in 1951 as a result of a boating accident. ===Ferry and River, Ports=== There are no ferry services, river services or port services in Seria.
