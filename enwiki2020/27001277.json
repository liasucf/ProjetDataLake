    "text": "Bushido: Der Weg des Kriegers, translated to Bushido: Way Of The Warrior is a game based in feudal Japan where competing Daimy\u014ds aim to gain enough honor to become the next Emperor of Japan. Played between three and five people, these competing Daimy\u014ds attempt to gain 50 Daimy\u014d honor through territorial conquest, samurai honor, or a surplus of combat katanas. During play, the current Daimy\u014d assigns role cards to the other players which last until the end of the current Daimy\u014d's turn. These role cards are: Samurai who will lead the Daimy\u014d's forces into combat, Bushi who will be defending their territory, Sensei who will be providing council and utilizing effects, and (only in 5 player games) Hatamoto who has the option to lead a revolt against the Daimy\u014d. The players have 12 months to reach 50 Daimy\u014d honor, although this time may be extended by effects. == Equipment and set up == Bushido utilizes a vast array of tiles and chips to provide a unique gaming experience to the players. Bushido comes with 32 Hexagonal squares to be used as the playing board, a smaller score board, a variety of square support tiles and circular tactics tiles, 33 troop markers in 5 colors, and 5 character cards. Bushido is played on a Hex map made up of several different tiles. These tiles are shuffled and arranged face down so that the game has a different board each time. Players then take turns picking a base (which they leave face down), and then flipping tiles they want until all players control 6 tiles. Play begins with the oldest player, going clockwise. To offset the benefit of going first, while the first person draws 10 support tiles, the second person draws 11, the third twelve, and so on. All player count up their Daimy\u014d honor on the board (the green symbol), and then add up their rice and swords. Players then place a number of troops on the board equivalent to their rice total. All this information is recorded on a small board provided with the game. Players then draw 4 tactics tokens each, and place their samurai honor at 10. Players must always have 4 tactics tokens, and if they lose one they must immediately draw back to 4. Play then begins == Game play == On each Daimy\u014d's turn, they first draw a number of support tiles equal to their sword count, and ensure their troop total is equal to their rice total. They then have the option of calling a tea ceremony to exchange Daimy\u014d honor for Samurai honor, although this is usually only done if the Daimy\u014d has a significant amount of samurai honor. The Daimy\u014d then passes out the character cards to the other players, assigning the Bushi as the target of his attack. The Sensei is now allowed to play any effects he wishes, such as looking at another players hand or skipping the current Daimy\u014d's turn. Other players may then do the same, although it is twice as costly for them to do so. If Hatamoto is present he draws two additional tokens, and can place Ronins on the board. Hatamoto then has the option of leading the Ronin into revolt against the Daimy\u014d, causing combat between Hatamoto and the Daimy\u014d. If the Daimy\u014d wins the Ronins are removed, but if Hatamoto wins the territory becomes neutral. The Daimy\u014d can then position his troops to where he wishes to invade. Combat then begins between the Samurai- led Daimy\u014d's forces and then Bushi, with the winner collecting samurai honor. If the Samurai wins the territory falls under the control of the current Daimy\u014d and scores are adjusted. If the Samurai loses he faces the council of the Sensei, where the Sensei decides how to punish the Samurai. punishments range from 0, 2-10 honor points or Seppuku, although the Daimy\u014d has final say on if he agrees. The Sensei then determines if all players should 'call to arms' and receive additional support tokens, and if any player had the emperors symbol they may meet the emperor for aid. The game then progresses to the next player, and the time chart advances one month. == Combat == Combat in Bushido is resolved by a mix of tactics and katana. The tactics follow a rock- paper-scissors style, although other factors may make certain tactics more effective. The katana amounts are adjusted by the tactics and troop amounts then compared, with the player with the highest total winning. Only the Battle tactic allows players to include their troop totals. Generally, Duel defeats Battle, Battle defeats Ambush, and Ambush defeats Duel, with the Traitor tactic defeating all three. Other tokes result in automatic loss. Combat provides Samurai honor based on troops killed, honor of the territory being fought over, and any incentives the Daimy\u014d may have provided. Combat between Hatamoto and the Daimy\u014d does not award honor points to either participant. == Honor and winning the game == Except for the beginning, at no point can two players have the same Daimy\u014d or Samurai honor. If one player moves onto another players honor amount, the moving player progresses one additional square. Daimy\u014d honor is gained in three ways: Selling Katanas, acquiring territory, and converting Samurai honor. At the beginning of the Daimy\u014ds turn they may place three yellow triple katana tokens back in the support tile bag in order to progress up one Daimy\u014d honor. the Daimy\u014d may do this as many times as they wish, although it must only be done at the beginning of their turn. When the Daimy\u014d gains territory they also gain the honor that territory provides, while if they lose a territory they lose any honor it provides. Samurai honor may only be converted to Daimy\u014d honor through a Tea Ceremony. The initiator (usually the Daimy\u014d) must invite another player to the tea ceremony. If the other player agrees the initiator gives them 5 samurai honor. the tea ceremony initiator may then convert as much samurai honor as they wish to Daimy\u014d honor, at a rate of two to one (i.e. 4 Samurai honor for 2 Daimy\u014d). If the other player refuses, they lose 10 samurai honor as well as one Daimy\u014d point for the disgrace. If players have less than 10 Samurai points they are not able to refuse a ceremony. Once a Daimy\u014d reaches 50 honor, they become the new emperor and win the game. Should no one reach this by the end of month 12, the Daimy\u014d with the highest honor total wins. == Strategy == The difficulty in Bushido is that all players are constantly regulating each other making it difficult to win. A samurai may throw a battle that would allow a Daimy\u014d to win, while players may save their best effects for the crucial last couple months. Overall, players whom hope to win have to aim to do so suddenly and without appearing as a threat, or face the wrath of the other players. In this way Bushido favors a diplomatic player over a militaristic player. == Sequels == Tanin the Stranger has recently been released in Europe as an expansion to the Bushido game.http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38707/bushido-der-weg- des-kriegers ==External links== * == References == Category:Board games introduced in 2008 ",
