    "text": "Rockin' Revival is the second album by Servant, released by Tunesmith Records in 1982, and was also the first album with Matt Spransy in the lineup. The original cover featured a picture of a revival meeting using a fisheye lens, but was later replaced by a number of concert photographs. The songs \"Ad Man\" and the high-energy \"I'm Gonna Live\" both quickly became concert staples.
