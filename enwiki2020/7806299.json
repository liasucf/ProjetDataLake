The algorithm runs in O(|R||S|) I/Os, where |R| and |S| is the number of tuples contained in R and S respectively and can easily be generalized to join any number of relations ... The block nested loop join algorithm is a generalization of the simple nested loops algorithm that takes advantage of additional memory to reduce the number of times that the S relation is scanned. ==Index join variation== If the inner relation has an index on the attributes used in the join, then the naive nest loop join can be replaced with an index join. algorithm index_join is for each tuple r in R do for each tuple s in S in the index lookup do yield tuple The time complexity for this variation improves from O(M * N) to O(M * log N). ==See also== *Hash join *Sort-merge join ==References== Category:Join algorithms ",
