When Jennifer Giraldi (Tara Westwood) visits her father (Carlo Fiorletta) to announce she is relocating to start a new career, she realizes her father has not left the house since the death of his wife (Kim Director), except for bare necessities, and he has yet to dispose of her mother\u2019s ashes.

She convinces Dan to tackle the relocation with her and her automated friend, Joe, her GPS with above-average artificial intelligence. == Cast == * Tara Westwood as Jennifer Giraldi * Carlo Fiorletta as Dan Giraldi * Paul Sorvino as Joe DiMaria * Richard Kind as Sam Jacobson * Michael Cerveris as Bob O\u2019Connor * Kim Director as Grace Giraldi * Phyllis Somerville as Annie Delaney * Deirdre O\u2019Connell as Beth * Vanessa Aspillaga as Megan O\u2019Malley * Michael Pressman as Tom McKinnon == Production == Detours was shot over 20 days in September and October 2014.
