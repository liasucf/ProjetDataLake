Retrieved 2015-09-22. The redshift was z = 7.2, meaning the light of the galaxy took nearly 13 billion years to reach Earth and therefore its formation dates back to 750 million years after the Big Bang . It has a high rate of star formation, at a rate of 100 solar masses per year, or about 30 times more than the Milky Way that is 5 times larger and 100 times more massive. ==See also== *List of the most distant astronomical objects ==References== Category:Galaxies Category:Ursa Major (constellation) Category:Dwarf irregular galaxies ",
